But that's not how it's supposed to be, and chances are, you already know that. Yet I've not seen any proper networking events happening around, when they happen abroad all too often. 

As a founder, you might want other successful friends, you might need help and guidance from other people who share a similar goal, or you might want to help others because it fulfills you to see other people grow.

If you understand what I'm talking about, and you're a Business Owner/ Founder/ CEO who's looking to network with other like-minded individuals from the twin cities, then read on. But if you're still confused and can't relate, then it's just not for you.

So the goal is to collectively uplift the business fraternity of the twin cities. For that, we're starting a series of weekly networking meetups with the first one being next week, where we will not only be in the company of other capable people with high goals, but also maybe make friends that could help eachother along the way in different areas.

Our meetups will be in a cafe / coffee shop that shall be disclosed only to the people that are verified. This is only for the folks in the Twin Cities (Rawalpindi & Islamabad), and here's how you can join.

To be a part, [join the WhatsApp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/CxH4NoHVb8mEoD5RatkByS), and then fill out the form which will be shared in the group. The form will be a short vetting process that allows me to maintain the quality of our group. 
You will be a good fit if you:
a) are a Business Owner/ Founder/ CEO
b) have employee(s)
c) are already generating revenue

Context: ever since I was in grade 5, I knew that I like girls, I was confused for how many years then last October I had a crush with this cute, mysterious girl (a friend of my friend). after a while, I confessed my feelings and then we started talking. it was okay, we have opposite interests, but I can say that we both put efforts to understand each other by exploring each other's interest. she introduced me to her close friends, updates me with photos/videos then tells stories about how her day went in full detail and many more that got me thinking that maybe we have a chance.

Last week, I sent her a letter in which I opened up about my past and how scared I am of losing people. I shared that I had a difficult childhood and often feel like everyone dislikes me and will eventually leave me again. Afterward, she asked me if I still liked her, and I said yes. She disappeared for a few minutes, then returned and told me that she had tried to like me but hadn't developed any feelings for me. She said she wanted us to stop and just be friends.

It felt like something inside me broke. I didn’t reply for three hours because I was crying nonstop. I know that what I feel for her isn’t just a simple crush; I truly like her. She's the first girl I've liked seriously. I can't see myself with anyone but her. A thousand thoughts piled up in my head. ""My fears came true, why?"" ""How will I ever watch Adventure Time, reply 1988, and Arcane again without remembering her?""(I watched all the movies/series she mentioned, even though I'm not really into movies.) she likes coffee, the rain, stars, painting, dogs, Spanish latte, vi, I could name many more things that she likes. she's all I could think about, but everything feels so heavy.

I miss her. I miss talking to her. I miss our silly conversations. I miss everything about her, but she seems fine without me. I can't find any ways to distract myself from this pain. what should I do?

I can't listen to my favorite bands because those bands were one of the reasons why we became close instantly. I can't drink coffee kasi she also loves coffee, and I always scold her for drinking too much or when she drinks it before eating meals. I can't go to Ayala because I used to make excuses to my parents just so I could go there every after school in hopes that I could see her and that's also where we first met and where we last hangout before all of this. EVERYTHING REMINDS ME OF HER I feel so insane.

I don't want to forget her, but everything feels too much lately.

1hzsr37,https://archive.org/details/WilliamCooperBeholdAPaleHorse1991,The Letter:Hunting for a Hidden Message ,"It was a chilly December morning back in 1996 and I started my day like any other, coffee, a bowl of oatmeal and the morning paper. In '96, I was writing for several publications about Unidentified Objects and the dismissal surrounding the phenomenon. I was probably at the height of my career then. 

Around 11am, the mail was delivered. Among the usual bills and junkmail, a letter, with no return address, arrived unannounced. A white envelope, no stamp, just a single, cryptic instruction scribbled across the front: Page 195

I remember thinking that it must be another chain letter. Intrigued, I tore open the envelope and found a single sheet of paper with several lines that read:

Begin at page 195
2 Projects
All the Answers 

I tossed the paper to the side and continued opening other mail. Two days passed by and those three lines kept lingering in my mind. And so, it began!

Over the years, the letter became a challenge, like trying to solve a riddle. I began checking out numerous books from the library and thumbing through them, always starting at page 195. I searched through the forgotten sections of the libraries, and I frequently visited second-hand bookstores, and even spent hours on dial-up looking for answers.

Some pages contained recipes, historical dates, and crazy insights. Others were more intriguing like the search for Bigfoot and other Crypto,  poems, ancient prophecies, even bizarre diagrams. None of the books or magazines shed any light or answers to the question that had consumed me for years...What book held the true message?

One day, while browsing the sale section, I stumbled upon a volume titled: Behold a Pale Horse
Its cover was missing and the pages were worn. A cold chill ran down my spine as I opened it to page 195. 

The Secret Government graced the page. The pages that followed had to be exactly what I have been searching for. References to 2 projects: Project Sigma and Project Plato. I was absolutely pumped and felt like Indiana Jones.

The pages seemed to hint at some clandestine government initiative. The text spoke of advanced communication protocols, of attempts to contact extraterrestrial intelligence. 

The following days were a sleepless journey of research. I started reading the book and was both amazed and somewhat cautioned at the information contained within its pages.  

Project Sigma, I learned, was a top-secret program dedicated to deciphering extraterrestrial signals. Project Plato, a closely guarded offshoot, focused on developing sophisticated communication methods to respond to those signals. 

Page 195 turned out to be a fragment of a larger possibility, a piece of a puzzle that supposedly revealed a chilling truth that humanity had been in contact with alien intelligence, and the consequences of that contact were far more profound than anyone could have ever imagined.

The letter was a message. Almost like a plea for someone to put a little light on this book so that others would know about it. Up until receiving that letter, I had never heard of Cooper or the book.

My journey for the meaning of, Begin at page 195, led me down a rabbit hole of conspiracy. Not only did this book contain a lot of answers, it was also a journey that has forever altered my perception of reality and increased my realization that most conspiracies may also be the truth in disguise.

Once you, the reader, opens this book, you'll be taken down the same rabbit hole you've heard so many speak of. There is also the mysterious circumstances surrounding the author that is intriguing as well.

First, there’s the mess with Zeina, which he dragged out way longer than necessary. Then he somehow managed to clash with Zeina’s husband, who wasn’t even part of the original drama. Seriously, why does Ebraheem always take things too far?

Then there’s his fight with Safa, who barely even engages with him, yet he still found a way to create tension. And let’s not forget Farhana, who literally had his back and defended him until she got burned by his nonsense too.

But wait, it doesn’t stop there! He even had issues with Salem during the Al Aula episode. Like, that argument came out of nowhere and just showed how confrontational he is. And to top it all off, he’s now feuding with his “best friend” Dana and her husband DJ Bliss. How do you even manage to mess up a friendship that solid?

At this point, Ebraheem needs to take a long, hard look in the mirror. He’s always in the middle of the chaos, stirring the pot, or escalating situations. Thoughts? Are we all seeing the same pattern here? Because this season, it feels like Ebraheem’s got more fights than friendships.

That (oddly) there is so much demand to “walk to get coffee” or “walk/bike to a store”. If so, why isn’t there an influx into the aforementioned cities? Why is the commercial and resi RE market failing in areas where zoning is not really an issue?
Consumer choice, especially for families, likely prioritizes ft^2, schools, and a quiet life versus walking to buy a $6 latte. There are also the issues of shuttered manufacturing, Amazon effect, work-from-home/IT, wealth concentration that all intertwine. 

Could it be that the West Village (NYC) and Pacific Heights (SFO) are unique examples in very rich tier 1 cities that benefit from Wall St/Tech, foreign investors, and concentrated wealth? And even in these cities, reality for the average resident is more East New York and Tenderloin, with a plague of problems (terrible public schools, illegal migrants, crime/safety, strained budgets despite massive taxes, etc).

An effective policy goal might be to revitalize tier 2/3 cities that are left behind. And sure, improve rail speed, connectivity, and transit hubs. Maybe in *some* cases, we can better spread out commercial districts. But we can’t deny suburbs exist because that is also what far more people want. Household car ownership/use is around 92% and even in NYC damn near 50%. It is just insanity to think we should ignore reality and the existing frame. And of course, there is plenty of opportunities for true believers to invest in Cincinnati.

1hzsn4y,https://i.redd.it/jqfticknrlce1.jpeg,To my coffee and boozy fragrance lovers ,"I found this gem on a review on YouTube. I liked the reaction of the scent from the YouTuber and the scent profile seemed interesting. I figured it’s only 40 dollars online why not get it. The thing is, it’s discontinued. So there is limited stock on places like Amazon. I decided to get the bottle for myself. I have a hand full of expensive fragrances, but I really enjoy experimenting in the lesser expensive fragrances to try and find hidden gems not a lot of people have or talk about. This is one of them. I’ve heard of BBW fragrances being very good, I’ve had a few of them in the past, my most recent and favorite fragrance by them is freshwater, it’s a clone of acqua di giò. 

Anyways coffee and whisky smells like it describes. First impression sniffing the bottle cap you get the whisky, you get the coffee. But on the skin it starts off as a very bold creamy coffee scent with a hint of bourbon, as it dries down it leans more coffee. I get pretty fair projection with this fragrance, im not sure if it’s because the fragrance itself is a strong smell or not. But 2-3 hours after application it projects well if you do 4-5 sprays, if you do less you will probably see about 2 hours or less. After 3 hours it becomes a close scent or a hug scent, roughly a foot or so from the skin, then after about 5 or 6 hours it stays a skin scent for hours! The projection may be fair, but this fragrance stays on my skin all night. I apply it during the morning and if I don’t shower that night, I shower the next morning, and I can usually smell it still on my wrist before I shower. If I don’t scrub where I applied my fragrance it still smells like coffee. Luckily my wife loves it so I usually wear it for her during the day and at night when it’s time for bed it’s still on my skin so she can still smell it very well. 

For a 40 dollar fragrance it does decently well. Better than some fragrances twice the price. It’s not for everyone, but if you’re someone who likes this type of fragrance I would suggest you try and find a bottle. They are hard to find because like I said they are discontinued.",1,1736705013.0,Colognes,0,1.0,False

The nurses pass next to me, busy and focused on their job, they don't even notice me. Tears stream down my face. I was never meant to be here.
I slowly raise my head, not looking at my worn out black boots anymore and I try to read the faces of the doctors and nurses passing next to me.
Why do they ignore me? 
I'm tempted to stop a doctor and ask him why is it taking so long for me to be called into the room. The bright white neon lights of the busy corridor blinds me and I squint my eyes, trying to push the tears back.
I look around and I see some vending machines. Maybe I need a coffee.
It's 2:54 am when I look at my watch.
I slowly get up from the chair after hours and my legs are numb as I approach the vending machines and slide some coins inside.
The steaming hot coffee descends down a white small plastic cup. When I grab it I burn my fingertips. I try to hold the cup steady and I gulp down the coffee in one go. 
The bitter taste stains my tongue. I also decide to buy a bottle of water. I insert the coins and press the button, but the bottle doesn't come down. I look at the small display. “Product stuck. Number 37 unavailable”.
I curse under my breath. The machine didn't even give me my coins back. Suddenly I feel a heavy hand on my shoulder. My breath stops as I slowly turn around, ready to face what I already know it's gonna happen.
“She can see you now” he murmurs. I don't like his tone. It doesn't sound like it brings good news.
I turn around and follow the doctor through the brightly sterile white corridor to a room that looks the same as all the other ones. He slowly opens the door and my heart drops.
I wasn't ready for that. I thought I was, but I'm not.
I slowly enter the room. She's laying on the bed. Tubes coming out of her throat, out of her nose and a needle pierces her left arm.
I try to push my tears back, but a single tear escapes my right eye and slowly descends down my cheek.
I take some steps into the room. The doctor stops on the threshold.
“Mom” I murmur.
 A metal chair is placed next to the hospital bed and I slowly sit on it. I slowly grab my mother's hand. It's cold and a small device to check her pulse is tightened around her index finger.
“Scarlett” she murmurs and then coughs.
“No, you don't have to talk mom” I try to say, my voice cracking and bending into a plea.
“No child should survive his parents…” she murmurs again, her eyes a bit milky and emptied by all the life they always had.
I had inherited her rare eye colour. The left one green and the right one blue.
“Mom… how much time… how much time do you have left?” I ask, every word a sword sinking into my quickening heart.
“Maybe two days… probably less” she murmurs.
Her hair is spread on the pillow, all tied and knotted. I wish I had a brush to comb them into what they were before. A wheat blonde colour, a spark of light that framed her soft features that I also had inherited.
I have always been more similar to my mom. We had the same thin and small nose, too bright pink lips that almost faded into red.
My lips are black now. Black lipstick around my lip piercing. My eyes are covered in black eyeshadow and black mascara. My clothes are also black. A leather black jacket and black ripped jeans.
I turn to my mom again. Her pale face and her eyes completely emptied from light tell me everything that I need to know.
“But… but you were fine just a week ago!” I raise my voice and I feel immediately guilty. She needs peace and silence.
“That's what cancer does…” she turns her head and looks at the white thin curtain that covers the only window in the room “It remains dormant and if you don't notice it… then it's too late”
“But… there has to be something we can do…” i murmur, taking her hand, brushing my thumb on her skin.
She turns to me.
“Those long black hair… don't cut them. They remind me of him” she says with a faint voice. 
I brush a strain of my long black hair behind my ear revealing my five earrings.
“Mom… can I come tomorrow?” I ask, now crying.
“No… I don't want you to see me die. You shouldn't have to live that” she stops for a moment “You already saw him die”
I hold back my tears, but I ultimately fail. I clean my smeared makeup with the sleeve of my jacket.
“Okay then. Goodbye mom. I'll see you again one day” I start to cry “I promise you. I'll see you smiling in a white and golden robe surrounded by angels” my voice cracks.
I slowly stand up and let go of my mother's hand. It drops on the mattress, her body emptied of every bit of force.
“Brain cancer. Advanced stage.” the doctor said just three months ago. She started to manifest the symptoms slowly but painfully. First she started to lose her ability to speak clearly and she started to drop things and walk weirdly. After I prayed her for weeks she finally decided to see a doctor and that's when the nightmare begun.
She was a fanatic of homeopathic medicine so she started to drink weird teas made of different herbs, but of course they did nothing. 
She was walking down the street when she fell to the ground, the bags of groceries spread on the cold asphalt. 
A few people gathered around her and called an ambulance, but when she arrived at the hospital she firmly refused the chemotherapy. 
I lived in and out of the hospital, seeing her slowly decay into an empty vessel of a body, her soul had left her long before she died.
“She'll regain it in heaven” I think as I leave the hospital room.
I turn around just for a moment to see her again. That's the last memory I'll have of the woman who gave me life.
The one who taught me to talk, to play the violin… to smile about the smallest things like a small blooming flower in her garden that she loved so much.
She was a violin teacher and started to teach me the splendid way of playing the instrument when I was five years old.
“The violin…” she whispers so faintly that I think I imagined it.
I look at her, puzzled. She slowly opens her bicoloured eyes.
“My violin… it's my legacy for you” she whispers, her lips chapped and her breaths unsteady.
“Thanks… mom. I… I love you so much” I cry out as I leave the bare hospital room.
I know it's the last time I'll ever see her alive. Maybe I'll see her in the casket at her funeral, but will I have the courage to look inside? To face the pale white corpse of her dressed beautifully and crowned by white flowers?
I quickly walk in the corridor, I'm almost running and bumping into nurses, doctors and other people walking around. I ask myself if some of them are living my same fate.
I follow the signs on the walls to get out of the building. I don't want to smell disinfectant for a second more.
I burst out of the main door. It's raining heavily and the sky is covered by thick black clouds. I seek shelter under the plastic structure of the bus stop and I light a cigarette. 
I drag too quickly from it as if the smoke could bring me a sense of pace.
“Come on, fucking cigarette. Give me lung cancer” I mutter as I light another one and I bring it to my lips. I drag and then look at it. The burning orange tip of it releasing a white trail of smoke.
“Fuck it” I murmur as I throw the cigarette on the street under the pouring rain.
After what seems like forever, but it's no more than fifteen minutes the bus arrives and I quickly get in, grabbing the first seat I see that's close to the window.
I'm alone now. One week ago, on the 12th of November I turned 21 and now I'm an orphan. The realisation still has to sink in as I look at the small drops of running down the big window. They run down as if they were racing, but they merge with each other, creating larger drops.
I wish I could be like them, kind of ethereal, aren't they? 
Water falling from the sky. It's almost magic.
But in my life the magic has been ripped away slowly and painfully.
“My little crow” my dad called me due to my black hair, the same as his. And he's been taken away from me by a drunk truck driver. 
And now my mom, devoured by brain cancer. Meant to die alone, her skin turning pale grey as life shifts out of her.
I close my eyes and rest my head on the window until it's time for me to leave the comforting warmth of the bus for the cold November pouring rain outside.
I step out of the bus, my legs unsteady as the rain starts to pour on me. My jacket doesn't have a hood so my hair gets quickly soaked. By the time I arrive home I'm completely drenched.
I slid the key on the keyhole and turn it. 
I slowly enter my house. It's scary to be here all alone. 
My house is fairly small and I know it by memory so I don't even turn on the lights as I walk to my room and change my clothes. I remove my ruined makeup in the bathroom and abandon myself on my bed.
I don't even cover myself. I just start to sob uncontrollably until I fall asleep, exhausted.

https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/benfolds/waytonormal.html

Hello everyone, I hope all is well. Today we are going to be taking a closer listen/look at “Way to Normal” which is the title track of the fake version of Ben’s third solo album Way To Normal. 

As you may know, the release of Way to Normal was someone quite special. With Ben finding that he had some spare time one night with the band, they recorded fake versions of the some of the songs that would make up the album’s track list. He then “leaked” the album online using a pseudonym and thus fans were shocked  when they found out the real album had completely different songs with similar names. But the one song that had a different title that never made it on the real album was actually the title track. 

It’s a very interesting song for its soundscapes, dynamics and overall performance. It starts off with this dramatic piano melody that is cascading up and down making it sound almost on edge. But before you can make heads or tails of it we get these immediate drums, crunchy bass hits and a fast hi hat hit. Ben, backed by Jared and Sam on vocals, sing “is this the way to normal? Show me the way to normal.” This could be a continuation of the lyrics of “Effington” where he’s on his way to Normal, Illinois. Or it could be an entirely new theme. Musically though, I can’t help but to think this song almost sounds like a corny Styx’s song with how over the top it is. Almost. But it’s too entertaining to compare it that. 

But with a drum fill and more fuzzy bass the band launches into a more “normal” groove  that has a bluesy but forward piano progression. Ben’s vocals sound a bit bitter as he states how we can blame “it” on the president, but then asks us if we could do any better. It seems like the “it” Ben is referring to are problems that the whole world experiences like starving children. Ben asks us if we could end world hunger with everything else there is to do. He thinks we would cave to all the problems coming down on us and maybe we wouldn’t be better off than the president. 

It’s kinda a serious subject matter to be singing about on a “fake” song on a fake version of the album with goofy songs like “Free Coffee Town.” But then the band transitions into a more hopeful sounding chorus musically where he sings “so this is the way, this is the way to normal.” It seems like Ben’s goal here isn’t to get to a physical location of Normal, but more so a state of living that is considered “normal.” He wants to live in a world where he doesn’t have to worry about starving kids or other problems weighing down the human race.  

With an “alright!” and another drum fill the band launches back into that head nodding groove of the verse. Ben sounds even more upset as he snarls out “you can say my music's bullshit in your uppity review” with a soulful “oooh!” thrown in at the end. He asks us what we would create if it was us in front of a keyboard with fans waiting to hear our next masterpiece. This time it’s more of a first world problem than a third world problem, but it’s a legitimate concern. If you are someone who creates art, you are always going to be criticized for it and have it compared to past works. To the point where you might feel like you are being thrown into the garbage as Ben states. 

After another chorus we go into this bridge that starts off with just some piano playing a new progression and vocals. You’ve got a nice high harmony as Ben sings “all these corporations poisoning our air with children sad and hungry but they don't even care.” With some high bass notes and light percussion Ben pleads for us to come together to solve these problems and make this world a better place before there’s no world left at all…

And before he can even finish that thought the band abruptly jumps back into that in-your-face intro with the Broadway type vocals that sings “is this the way to normal?” It’s definitely a contrast to the optimistic sounding bridge but it catches you off guard in a fun weird way. Same goes for the ending as we get some last hits of that fuzzy bass before ending with an energetic snare roll and an almost out of place electric keyboard riff. 

Know if you listen to the version of this song today on streaming services, that would be the ending. But the original ending for this track actually picks up with this ballad/waltz piano progression as Ben croons the lyrics “long way to go.” Yep, Ben original wrote the chorus of the So Long track “Long Way To Go” back when he was writing and recording this short bonus title track! And it makes sense lyrically because in this version he’s singing that there’s a long way to go to get back to normal. Where the final version of “Long Way to Go” would go in a more relationship driven narrator. It’s cool to see a song in its early form, like hearing “So Long” at the end of the making of Songs For Silverman DVD. 

Did this title track deserve to make it on the final version of the album? I can’t really make an argument for that but I do think it’s an underrated track from Ben. It’s way more dramatic than anything from Way to Normal and at times maybe even more exciting. Lyrically it’s maybe a little all over the place (some of it seeming similar to “Frowne Song”) but I still think it has an interesting concept, especially with the “Long Way to Go” coda. And surprisingly this song was played live during the tour. 

But what do you think of this “fake” song? Should it have been included on the real album? What do you think the song is about? Favorite lyrical or musical moments? And have you ever experienced it live?",2,1736704884.0,benfolds,1,1.0,False

https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jasonisbell/kingofoklahoma.html

Hello everyone, I hope all is well. Today we are going to be tackling “King of Oklahoma” which is the second song from the band’s most recent album Weathervanes. 

When this album was released it was clear what song the fans were going to clamor to the most. Was it going to be the song about a school shooting, the one about not washing a cast iron skillet or the one about Justin Townes Earle? No… of course it was going to be the one about a guy pissing from a ladder. 

Okay but all jokes aside (because “Cast Iron Skillet” is a masterpiece), let’s see what Jason had to say about writing the song before we break it down:

“I was out there filming in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. There was a project that I had been asked to be a part of with Darius Rucker, Sheryl Crow and I think Mike Mills, and a couple of other people. For a minute there, I was like, ‘Well, if I can get home in time to record with you all, that sounds like a really fun time. So I will do that.’ But I was never home in time because they kept changing my filming schedule, so I just missed it. But I wrote that song thinking, ‘Well, maybe I need some songs for this; I don’t know if this is going to work for them or not.’ Eventually I thought this should be just a song of my own.”

The song starts off with a somber western sounding electric guitar progression backed by some haunting fiddles. Before Jason starts singing we get a solid drum beat, a tight bass groove and some acoustic guitar to fill out the song. 

Lyrically this song tells a sad but unfortunately common story of addiction and the loss that comes with that. The main character of the song starts off by finding a worksite with minimal security so he can steal copper from it to make money for drugs. Because he’ll write his own prescriptions or else “shit’s about to get real hard.” We are then introduced to this character’s partner who is named Molly. She isn’t buying his lies about getting clean and threatens him that she’s going to take their kids and leave him. Yep, some really heavy shit indeed. So he puts some gas in his step side (truck) in hopes of stealing the copper and making money for drugs. 

Now in the next verse we learn about the reason for y his character need for drugs in the first place. He was living a nice life when he decided to piss while working on a twenty foot ladder, causing him to fall and hurt his back. He went to the doctor and left home with a pocket full of pills. Except those pills weren’t enough to fully mask the pain and he had to quit his job which in return led him to fall behind on his bills. 

After four devastating verses we finally transition into the chorus that starts off with a half time feel on the drums and Jason’s soaring vocals. He belts out about how Molly used to wake him up with coffee every morning and how she would make him feel like the “king of Oklahoma.” He even remembered the little things like the sound that her homemade house shoes would make as she’d “slide across the floor.” Sadly nothing can make him feel anything these days, not these happy memories and not even his pills. 

Following the chorus we get a blistering solo from Jason that reminds us that he sure can play a mean guitar. Returning to the verse we learn that someone beat the song’s narrator to stealing the copper. This really puts him in a tough situation as he’s running out of money and the only thing he has left is the title of his truck. Although in a tweet by Jason, he mentions “loans don’t always come from the banks, also the title is sometimes right there in the song title.” Basically he means that this guy might have gotten a loan for his truck to some other shady person and that the only title he has now is the “king of Oklahoma.” 

And in the last verse we see Molly finally making her threat real by taking the kids to Bixby which is a suburb of Tulsa, Oklahoma. She tells him to figure his shit out and he tells us that he’s finally being honest because at this low point of his life there’s nothing left to lie about. 

The band goes back to the chorus a couple of last times, this time with some slightly different lyrics. Jason sings “and I’d act like I was sleeping till she’d walk back through the door.” To me, this shows the character at his lowest point in their relationship where instead of having her wake him up every morning, he would pretend to be sleeping to avoid seeing her or maybe to avoid letting her see how bad he was becoming. Addiction can make you retreat from your loved ones and family almost against your own will and this devastating lyric makes you feel even more sad for this character. 

And then to end this gloomy story we get an explosive guitar solo to end the song. If you think it sounds great on the record then you really need to see it live to experience it first hand. I feel like the live version puts it to shame because not only does Jason solo for twice the amount of time but Sadler gets in on the action and the whole band just sounds lot harder and plays with some more complex rhythms and syncopations. 

If someone was to say that this is one of Jason’s best songs, I couldn’t argue against it. When it comes to the story telling it’s like watching a movie. The characters are well written and the emotions throughout the song are hard hitting. I actually think the verses contains some of Jason’s catchiest vocal melodies. Not to mention he has so much passion when he’s singing the chorus. And speaking of the chorus, I love the dynamics changes in the music and how it gives the song a breath of fresh air. Plus you can’t forget about those guitar solos that have become iconic when seeing the band live. There’s a reason why this song is a favorite for most people on this album, why it got its own music video and why it’ll probably be a live staple for the next couple of tours. 

But what do you think about this song? Is this going to be a classic Jason song for years to come? What do you think the song is about? Favorite lyrical or musical moments? And have you seen it live yet?",5,1736704883.0,jasonisbell,1,1.0,False
1hzsl0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1hzsl0f/roommates_keep_using_my_stuff/,roommates keep using my stuff,"hi! for some context, my boyfriend and i share a house with my best friend & her boyfriend. before we all moved in together, her and i shared an apartment for two years. 
so here’s the issue: my boyfriend and i grocery shop regularly. him and i both work full time so we always get stuff for lunches & dinners to refrain from eating out. i can’t tell you when the last time our roommates went to the store & actually got groceries. they’ll go get stuff to make them dinner one night but that’s about it. the problem we’re having is they are constantly eating our groceries or using our stuff. here’s a few examples: 
1. they were sick a couple weeks ago & instead of going to the doctor or going to the store to get otc meds, they came into our bathroom & used what we had. normally i wouldn’t care but my boyfriend was also sick (cold season) and was using what we had for himself. we had to go buy more for him since they had taken our meds. 
2. both couples have a dog. instead of going to get soap for their dogs bath, they use ours. have never bought more or even thought about it because we have some. 
3. we are in the south & just recently had a snow storm come through. i had sent a text in our group chat saying we had gone to buy groceries in case we’re snowed in, but didn’t get enough for everyone so they needed to go get stuff for them. well, they didn’t and said they had stuff to eat already in the house. flash forward, we did in fact get snowed in & they ate our food & drank our milk and coffee. 

i don’t want to come off like im being selfish or rude, but my boyfriend and i don’t make enough to support all four of us in this house and we do what we can to save money by eating at home. i usually don’t care either if they take something of ours or eat something of ours, but it’s been a reoccurring trend here lately. and i have said things multiple times about them needing to go to the grocery store, in a very kind manner, but they never do. they both also make more money than my boyfriend and i, but are irresponsible with their finances. now im not saying that we are super smart with our money, but we make sure we can take care of ourselves and our bills. 

i guess im just looking for some advice on how to bring this up to them. i’ve thought about leaving sticky notes on what’s ours in the pantry and fridge but that just seems a little childish as we’re all adults and should be able to talk this out. i understand being tight on money and not being able to afford things, but that just simply isn’t the case for them.

1hzsfh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1hzsfh1/my_mil_and_sils_excluded_me_from_my_husbands/,My MIL and SILs excluded me from my husbands birthday dinner ,"My husband turned 30 last May. I was hoping to have a party or a dinner with all of our family to celebrate. My husband said he didn’t want anything other than a dinner with me at his favourite restaurant. I made sure that’s what he wanted, and said you don’t even want your mom or my parents there? He said no, so I didn’t press. He had also communicated this with his mother and she didn’t seem to care very much. 

A few weeks before his birthday, one of his sisters started a group chat with him, his mother and his other siblings (another sister and a brother). They told him about their plan to take him out for dinner the day before his birthday. They said it was just going to be him and his mother and siblings. When he asked about me they said they weren’t including spouses because everyone finding childcare on such short notice would be too difficult. I found this little odd because my husband and I are the only ones without kids, so why do I need to be excluded and it was about 3 weeks out. Plenty of time to figure out childcare in my opinion. 

For context, this isn’t the first time they have left me out of things or tried to do “family only” things. Most of the time they never worked out, or I just let it go. But for my husband’s 30th birthday, I felt a little hurt by the fact they didn’t want to include his wife. When my husband told me about it, he was a little nervous because he knows it upsets me when they exclude me from things. At first I thought he was going to tell me he told them he wasn’t going. Then he asked me if I was okay with it. I was taken back because he had told me he didn’t want to do anything with his family, and that’s why I didn’t reach out to them to plan something. I should also note, that his family isn’t this super close right knit family who do everything together. Everyone is always arguing with someone, and my husband doesn’t really make an effort to see them unless I press him to. 

I told him I wasn’t okay with it because it’s rude that they are trying to exclude his own wife from his birthday dinner. He tried to play it off that’s it not a big deal, it’s just a dinner. He maintained the fact that he was going right up until the day of the dinner. 

I probably should have just let it go, but I’ve left so many things slide over the years (we’ve been together since high school, and married for almost 6 now). They have never welcomed me into their family, they always made it known that I’m an outsider (especially before we got married) and even after marriage it didn’t really get better. I could go on, but my MIL caused a considerable amount of drama at my bridal shower and leading up to my wedding. It got to the point where I almost called it all off. My husband has struggled with setting boundaries with his family. 

Anyways, a few hours before the dinner my husband asked me how I felt about it. I told him I was still unhappy but if he wants to go that’s up to him. I probably did guilt trip him a little too much, but again I couldn’t help it. So many feelings from over the years kept coming up. About an hour before, he said he decided not to go. I told him that’s probably a bad idea to cancel this close to it because they would get mad and blame me. He didn’t end up going, and as I predicted, it started a fight. His brother called me some unpleasant names, his one sister said “<my name> is just your wife, we are your family forever and always.” His mother also gave him a hard time 

Even though this happened in May 2024, it has spiralled into a lot of other things over the months. His brother called me a controlling psychopath and his sisters gave me the silent treatment. I was pretty upset at my husband for the way he handled it and I felt like he threw me under the bus. I’ve been told by some people that I shouldn’t have made him feel guilty about it. I know I could have handled it differently, but if everyone understood my history with this family, they would get it. 

My husband realized how hurt I was and he has done everything in his power to make it right. I have forgiven him, even though it’s taken a while. He spoke to his mother to let her know how I felt about being excluded, but she saw nothing wrong with it. She said the other spouses weren’t upset, so none of them understood why I was. I however, cannot forgive his family. None of them have reached out to me, I did try to message his sisters and mother and ask if we could clear the air but I was left on read. Eventually, months later I did hear from my MIL in November, because my husband had reached out to her again. She was asking him about the holidays and what our plans were, but he said we won’t be coming around until she had a talk to me. Me and her did go for coffee to talk, but we got nowhere. 

Both of us were also excluded from the family Christmas dinner this year. It was at his brothers house and since his brother is still angry with me for my husband not going to the dinner, we weren’t invited. We saw pictures on Facebook of the entire family there a few days before Christmas. Not a single one of them reached out to us to try and make alternate plans with us. We chose not to do it ourselves. 

So fast forward to now. My MIL doesn’t seem to understand why we haven’t come around lately and why we didn’t come see her over the holidays. Their family is the type where we have to make the effort first, or we don’t see/hear from them. Since everyone else has kids they seem to expect us to make the effort because why should they, if we want to be in their children’s lives, WE need to make the effort. 

The reason I’m making this post is because we are going to my MILs for dinner tonight. She asked my husband yesterday because she has our Christmas gifts that she hasn’t given us yet. He asked me if I wanted to go. I really don’t, but I figured I’d be the bigger person and just go. I’m ready to defend myself if I have to, because I know she will make a stink about the fact we didn’t come see her over the holidays. 

Overall, my husband is starting to see their toxic side. We did couples counselling after the whole birthday thing. That was something he agreed to do to make up for what happened. I think it’s been effective, and he has also kept his distance. He stood up to his mom for the first time ever, and said he will not come around if the family continues to disrespect his wife. 

I have a lot of feelings today and I’m dreading  the dinner, but I’ll go kill her with kindness 😊

We have a great relationship with his dad’s side. His parents were never together, he was the result of a fling and none of his siblings on his mom’s side have the same dad. He’s the youngest out of the 4 of them. My FIL and family treat me well and we spent Christmas with them. We also have a decent relationship with my family. They would never exclude him from anything, they all thought it was crazy that his family pulled this stunt. 

TLDR: my husband’s family excluded me from his birthday dinner and it spiralled out of control. It’s been months, but I can’t get past it. ",5,1736704496.0,motherinlawsfromhell,5,1.0,False
1hzsfd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1hzsfd0/what_are_your_experiences_with_ssris_and_heartburn/,What are your experiences with SSRIs and heartburn? ,"Long term GERD sufferer here. 

Currently I’m taking 20mg esomeprazole twice daily and 20mg famotidine twice daily. My GERD symptoms are usually reflux i.e. constantly regurgitating food and feeling full/sick, etc, but by all accounts I don’t normally have actual heartburn. Unless I eat something silly or drink too much coffee, the meds usually keep the actual burning under control. 

However… I started taking sertraline about 5 weeks ago (25mg, supposed to be increasing to 50mg but reluctant to do that with these side effects) and I’ve noticed that I’m having increasing heartburn and acid. Acidic painful burping throughout the day. Accidentally took my sertraline on an empty stomach earlier (won’t do that again) and within half an hour I had awful, awful burning and chest pain. 

I can’t see what else could be causing it other than this new medicine. Could be wrong but it’s very coincidental if not 

Anyway… Just wondered about others’ experiences with this drug? I might talk to my doctor about stopping it rather than increasing it. Was put on it for postnatal depression but honestly, having heartburn daily will just make me feel more depressed so no real point! ",2,1736704488.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

1hzsach,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1hzsach/cosmic_threads/,Cosmic Threads ,"Life's journey is a tapestry woven with threads of chance and choice. You, my dear, are a constellation of serendipity—a chance encounter that felt like destiny. From the moment our paths crossed, the universe seemed to whisper secrets only we could hear.

You were far away, yet closer to me than anyone else. Your words traversed the distance, bridging continents and time zones. Each syllable carried hope, each sentence a lifeline. I found strength in your vulnerability, courage in your laughter.

Everything I saw reminded me of you. The sunsets painted hues reminiscent of your smile. The raindrops danced to a rhythm only we understood. Even the mundane became magical—a cup of coffee, a simple text.

Our meeting was a cosmic collision, orchestrated by celestial hands. Perhaps fate had grown tired of waiting and decided to intervene. Our paths synchronized like two metronomes beating in harmony.

You made me dream bigger and better. Your existence was an invitation to explore uncharted territories—to chase after shooting stars and build castles in the clouds. With you, impossibilities became mere obstacles waiting to be overcome.

It felt like you were too good to be true, a character from a novel I'd read late at night. But there you were, flesh and bone, weaving your story into mine. Our chapters unfolded with unpredictable twists, leaving us breathless and hungry for more.

Life is full of rare opportunities, hidden gems waiting to be discovered. We stumbled upon each other like explorers unearthing buried treasure. And though it hurts—the distance, the longing—it's a pain worth bearing for the chance to love fiercely.

So what do we do? We live, embracing every fleeting moment as if it were our last. We lust, defying geography and time zones with whispered promises and stolen kisses  across phone screens. We learn, growing wiser with every heartbeat shared across continents.

And when the ache becomes unbearable, remember this: our fate transcends borders, defying maps and logic. It's stitched into the fabric of existence—a cosmic thread connecting two souls across oceans.

So let's keep writing our story—one word at a time—until our paths converge once more.

1hzs96x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/comments/1hzs96x/need_insight_into_filing_an_insurance_claim/,Need insight into filing an insurance claim?,"Hello Angeleno’s. I found the below post on my local nextdoor feed. Reposting here as someone who previously lost a home to a Hurricane. This is valuable advice. 

So, do you need help with your claim? Save this info for when it’s time to file. Share with others experiencing loss. 

I hope you are all safe. 🙏

""Hey OP... I used to be the guy who worked for insurance companies, and determined the value of every little thing in your house. The guy who would go head-to-head with those fire-truck-chasing professional loss adjusters. I may be able to help you not get screwed when filing your claim.

Our goal was to use the information you provided, and give the lowest damn value we can possibly justify for your item.

For instance, if all you say was ""toaster"" -- we would come up with a cheap-as-fuck $4.88 toaster from Walmart, meant to toast one side of one piece of bread at a time. And we would do that for every thing you have ever owned. We had private master lists of the most commonly used descriptions, and what the cheapest viable replacements were. We also had wholesale pricing on almost everything out there, so really scored cheap prices to quote. To further that example:

• If you said ""toaster - $25"" , we would have to be within -20% of that... so, we would find something that's pretty much dead-on $20.01.

• If you said ""toaster- $200"" , we'd kick it back and say NEED MORE INFO, because that's a ridiculous price for a toaster (with no other information given.)

• If you said ""toaster, from Walmart"" , you're getting that $4.88 one.

• If you said ""toaster, from Macys"" , you'd be more likely to get a $25-35 one.

• If you said ""toaster"", and all your other kitchen appliances were Jenn Air / Kitchenaid / etc., you would probably get a matching one.

• If you said ""Proctor Silex 42888 2-Slice Toaster from Wamart, $9"", you just got yourself $9.

• If you said ""High-end Toaster, Stainless Steel, Blue glowing power button"" ... you might get $35-50 instead. We had to match all features that were listed.

I'm not telling you to lie on your claim. Not at all. That would be illegal, and could cause much bigger issues (i.e., invalidating the entire claim). But on the flip side, it's not always advantageous to tell the whole truth every time. Pay attention to those last two examples.

I remember one specific customer... he had some old, piece of shit projector (from mid-late 90s) that could stream a equally piece of shit consumer camcorder. Worth like $5 at a scrap yard. It had some oddball fucking resolution it could record at, though -- and the guy strongly insistedthat we replace with ""Like Kind And Quality"" (trigger words). Ended up being a $65k replacement, because the only camera on the market happened to be a high-end professional video camera (as in, for shooting actual movies). $65-goddam-thousand-dollars because he knew that loophole, and researched his shit.

Remember to list fucking every -- even the most mundane fucking bullshit you can think of. For example, if I was writing up the shower in my bathroom:

• Designer Shower Curtain - $35

• Matching Shower Curtain Liner for Designer Shower Curtain - $15

• Shower Curtain Rings x20 - $15

• Stainless Steel Soap Dispenser for Shower - $35

• Natural Sponge Loofah - from Whole Foods - $15

• Natural Sponge Loofah for Back - from Whole Foods - $19

• Holder for Loofahs - $20

• Bars of soap - from Lush - $12 each (qty: 4)

• Bath bomb - from Lush - $12

• High end shampoo - from salon - $40

• High end conditioner - from salon - $40

• Refining pore mask - from salon - $55

I could probably keep thinking, and bring it up to about $400 for the contents of my shower. Nothing there is ""unreasonable"" , nothing there is clearly out of place, nothing seems obviously fake. The prices are a little on the high-end, but the reality is, some people have expensive shit -- it won't actually get questioned. No claims adjuster is going to bother nitpicking over the cost of fucking Lush bath bombs, when there is a 20,000 item file to go through. The adjuster has other shit to do, too.

Most people writing claims for a total loss wouldn't even bother with the shower (it's just some used soap and sponges..) -- and those people would be losing out on $400.

Some things require documentation & ages. If you say ""tv - $2,000"" -- you're getting a 32"" LCD, unless you can provide it was from the last year or two w/ receipts. Hopefully you have a good paper trail from credit/debit card expenditure / product registrations / etc.

If you're missing paper trails for things that were legitimately expensive -- go through every photo you can find that was taken in your house. Any parties you may have thrown, and guests put pics up on Facebook. Maybe an Imgur photo of your cat, hiding under a coffee table you think you purchased from Restoration Hardware. Like... seriously... come up with any evidence you possibly can, for anything that could possibly be deemed expensive.

The fire-truck chasing loss adjusters are evil sons of bitches, but, they actually do provide some value. You will definitely get more money, even if they take a cut. But all they're really doing, is just nitpicking the ever-living-shit out of everything you possibly owned, and writing them all up ""creatively"" for the insurance company to process.

Sometimes people would come back to us with ""updated* claims. They tried it on their own, and listed stuff like ""toaster"", ""microwave"", ""tv"" .. and weren't happy with what they got back. So they hired a fire-truck chaser, and re-submitted with ""more information."" I have absolutely seen claims go from under $7k calculated, to over $100k calculated. (It's amazing what can happen when people suddenly ""remember"" their entire wardrobe came from Nordstrom.)""

I at least intend on finishing the first game's plot, but I may end up just writing shorter notes for Games 2 and 3 if I get burnt out writing this entire alternate plotline.



This first post will detail the first two cases of the first game, and will stay relatively close to canon despite many characters' roles being swapped or even replaced by a different character, sometimes even by characters that never appeared initially in the original trilogy. Later events in the trilogy may also be referenced earlier than they did in canon as I have the foresight with a rough outline of how I want this version of the trilogy's story to play out in my head. As this story progresses, however, it may deviate further and further from canon despite the general settings and scenarios remaining the same. 



Without further ado, here are the first two cases of this Miles Edgeworth: Ace Attorney What If Scenario:

**Case 1-The Classic Turnabout**

 

Miles Edgeworth’s first ever trial begins in tragedy. The defendant is his childhood friend, Phoenix Wright, an aspiring artist who’s a bit on the goofy side, but has a good heart and always stands up for his moral convictions. He has been accused of murdering their other mutual friend, Larry Butz in Larry’s apartment, bludgeoned to death with a homemade statue called the Thinker. Although the task is daunting, he is aided by his legal mentor, Eddie Fender, a longtime family friend, who took over the Edgeworth Law Firm after Gregory Edgeworth had to take a leave of absence for unknown reasons. Over the course of the trial, Miles’ reasons for wanting to become a lawyer and the childhood class trial of Phoenix are revealed, showing that their bond truly goes back a long way. 

 

Heading up the trial is prosecutor Winston Payne, with everyone’s favourite judge at the helm. The prosecution calls the sole witness to the crime, the victim’s seemingly distraught girlfriend, April May. Over the course of the trial, however, her demeanor completely shifts, becoming more and more agitated the further she’s pressed. In the end, with nearly identical contradictions to those seen in The First Turnabout, it is revealed that April May was the real killer, and her motivations were that she was a petty thief who was known to steal various knick knacks from people and sell them off as her own. The reason she got into a relationship with the victim at all was because of his understated talent for art, but she laments that in the end, she never saw value in the Thinker as a piece of art, and that the only money she could find in the apartment was an envelope with $38.00 included and with its intended recipient being Miles Edgeworth.

 

After the trial concludes, Phoenix and Miles reminisce about Larry alongside Eddie Fender. Phoenix expresses doubt that perhaps Larry didn’t see him as a true friend in the end, but Miles presents the envelope with $38.00 and assures Phoenix that since Larry was willing to come clean that he was the original culprit in the class trial all those years ago that he truly did care for him and Phoenix, even to the point that he was willing to give up his remaining $38.00 to make it up to his friends. Eddie Fender congratulates the two on their success, and decides to take the duo out to dinner on him, stating that he’s looking forward to overseeing what other trials and tribulations are in store for Miles Edgeworth.

**Case 2-Turnabout Inheritance**

 

Late one evening, Miles Edgeworth went to visit Eddie Fender at the Edgeworth & Co Law Offices, however upon entering the office he was met with a grisly sight. The body of Eddie Fender lay propped up against the wall near the window, with a distraught young girl with a key- shaped hairpin overlooking his body. Before he could get a good look at the crime scene, he heard a shrill scream coming from the Gatewater Hotel across from the office’s window, and was met with the sight of a young man aged about 18 screaming into a phone that he’d just witnessed a murder. Surveying the crime scene, Edgeworth notices a piece of paper with “Kay” written in Fender’s blood, but before he can properly question the girl, a scruffy looking detective with bullet holes in his jacket declared that she was under arrest, and that there was no place for Edgeworth on his crime scene.

 

The following day, Edgeworth’s investigation yields some interesting results. The defendant in this case is Kay Faraday, a young girl who had come to pay her “Uncle Eddie” a visit to hold onto a valuable piece of evidence, a common occurrence because she’s the daughter of one of Gregory Edgeworth’s old friends. As it turns out, she’s also a huge fan of the Great Thief Yatagarasu, and claims to want to steal the truth by any means necessary. Edgeworth offers to defend her, but she declines, stating that Mr. Fender had told her to instead enlist the help of Armando Law Offices. Edgeworth decides to pay the man a visit, but he’s unwilling to help, and mourns that he’s let yet another person fall victim to “that awful organization”. Before he’s forced out of Armando’s office, Edgeworth spots two photos on Armando’s table: a young brunette in her mid 20s, and a photo of his own father, Gregory. Miles then leaves to investigate the Gatewater Hotel, where he runs into two of the witnesses for the upcoming trial, the shifty bellboy Frank Sawhit and the young businessman who witnessed the murder, Lance Amano. Along the way, he also becomes acquainted with the detective assigned to the case, Detective Tyrell Badd, who seems gruff and unpleasant but ultimately decides to allow Edgeworth to investigate because it was his own mentor who was killed. After Kay finally agrees to accept Edgeworth’s defense, he is informed that the prosecutor in charge of the case is the daughter of the former legendary prosecutor Manfred von Karma, who managed to maintain a 25 year win streak before finally being defeated by Gregory in one of his trials.

 

Day 1 of the trial begins, and Franziska von Karma is heading up the prosecution, having a perfect 4 year win streak and counting. She states that she’s aware that she and Edgeworth are both the progeny of some of the most esteemed lawyers in the legal profession, but that that won’t get in the way of her completely crushing Edgeworth’s reputation with her perfect evidence and perfect witnesses. Detective Badd takes up the stand first, and he’s surprisingly quick to let slip information that implicates Lance Amano in the crime. Once Lance takes the stand, it becomes all too apparent that he wasn’t the only one in that room, and that he was actually sharing a hotel room with his father, Ernest Amano, head of the Amano Group conglomerate. Finally, Frank Sawhit takes the stand, and he reveals that Ernest had bribed him into not revealing that he had been occupying the room to “preserve his son’s reputation as an aspiring businessman”. Edgeworth manages to get another day out of the trial, and vows to investigate the Amano Group.

 

Edgeworth’s second day of investigation proves to be much more dire than the last. First, he inquires Mr. Armando about the photo he saw of his father in his office, and at first Armando doesn’t want to open up, but upon learning that Edgeworth plans on taking down Ernest Amano, Armando finally spills the (coffee) beans. It turns out that Ernest Amano was using his position as head of the Amano Group to obtain information from various politicians, judges, and others in the legal profession in order to blackmail them and get not-guilty verdicts for his associates if they ever came into legal trouble. Mr. Armando himself had been on the trail of the Amano Group about 7 years ago following the KG-8 Incident, an incident that rocked the legal world and was the trial where Gregory Edgeworth went into hiding and was the last known sighting of the Great Thief Yatagarasu. Several years following that case, Mr. Armando had been following a case where the Amano Group was suspected to be involved, but in the aftermath of that incident his colleague and girlfriend, Mia Fey, wound up comatose, and his boss, Marvin Grossberg, left the legal profession entirely. Armando vows to help Edgeworth any way he can, and Edgeworth then proceeds to head to the Amano Group’s main building. Upon confronting the man, Ernest calls the chief prosecutor, and orders Edgeworth to be arrested for the murder of Eddie Fender in Kay’s place, ending off the investigation at a stand still.

 

Edgeworth decides to defend himself in court the following day, where the truth is revealed. Eddie Fender had also been investigating the Amano Group for years following Gregory’s disappearance, until finally Ernest Amano caught wind of his intentions. One week prior to his murder, Ernest went to Edgeworth & Co. Law Offices to tap Fender’s phone, and that is how he hatched his plan to murder him. What he didn’t realize was that one day before the murder, Eddie had bought a new lamp for his office, the same one that had been smashed in the aftermath of the incident when he smashed the Thinker Statue onto Mr. Fender’s forehead, killing him instantly. Edgeworth manages to deduce that the lamp was bought one day before the murder by recalling Mr. Fender’s mantra of “turning your thinking around”, where he got the idea to flip the bloody message and reveal that it was actually a receipt. The case is solved, Kay Faraday becomes Miles Edgeworth’s new assistant, and Franziska von Karma’s perfect record is broken, mirroring what Gregory Edgeworth did to Manfred von Karma all those years ago.

That concludes part 1 of this alternate scenario. I don't know when part 2 will be up next, as I haven't even begun writing it up as of posting this, however hopefully I'll have it up by the end of the month. I know these events stuck mostly to how they were in canon but with some additional details added, but expect to see some more major changes in part 2, like certain cases shifting games such as Rise From the Ashes happening in Game 2 instead of Game 1 to further flesh out that game's main story and the circumstances in case 4 being vastly different from canon despite the main prosecutor still being the defendant of the case.

On Friday morning I was groggy and got up to use the bathroom. My wife had wanted me to take the trash out but by the time I got on the toilet to use the bathroom I realized I wasn’t feeling too hot so I texted her “I don’t feel like I can go outside yet.” Then after 20 minutes of trying to use the bathroom I realized I was constipated and was getting uncomfortable. My sore legs were already started to feel numb and I texted my wife and asked her if she could drive home and bring me some laxative type medication. (At this point if you are reading this please understand its about to get TMI) I was trying to push the poo out but the more I realized it wasn’t going to come out, I had tried desperately for about thirty minutes to no avail and realized the culprit..

For the past six days after my tonsillectomy I had been on hydrocodone pain killers which slow bowel movements. I had only used the bathroom a couple of times over the last six days and was getting blocked up. The prior evening I had started running out of ice cream and other cold foods and reached for some Nature’s Own Butter bread off my shelf and started eating toast. I simply didn’t have any other options. From that point on from the evening until the following morning at 10:51am when I sat down to use the bathroom I had eaten half the loaf bread with butter. This bread had clumped up in my already backed up stomach and had turned into a brick that was impossible to excavate.. A few minutes later my wife showed up and gave me a stool softener the doctor prescribed me. I took three pills and sat waiting for relief.. But it didn’t come. I started using ChatGPT to look for creative solutions. It told me to drink orange juice which is all I had besides water and so my wife brought me a glass of it. I chugged it. I started chugging water too. Quickly I downed about a half gallon of water over the course of about an hour and drank another cup of orange juice as well. At this point the disgusting butter bread dump was at a complete stand still, halfway through my anus. I kept shifting positions endlessly balancing on a trash can with my legs up and crunching my body together. The pain was an excruciating and my bladder began to tighten with liquids. My pants felt that they were cutting off my circulation and so I yanked them off my legs.  

Then I thought I would try coffee. After an hour and a half I was delirious on a FaceTime call with my wife teaching her how to make coffee. She brought me a large black cup and I downed it in five minutes. Nothing. I started feeling light-headed as the caffeine hit my system, I had not eaten lunch and my head started reeling. I started texting my wife incessantly saying things like “help me help me help me” on repeat. Then ChatGPT told me to try another medication so I found two other laxatives and desperately begged my wife (who left the office to help me) to get them from CVS.  She got me Dulcolax, an overnight laxative that is supposed to take 6-12 hours to bring relief as well as some hellish torture devices called “Fleet Enemas” which are designed to stimulate the rectum. I didn’t know what that meant I thought it was a pill and asked my wife to get it because ChatGPT said it could bring relief in as little as 15 minutes. 

She came home and by this point she was shocked to find me butt naked because every article of clothing felt that it was hindering my progress. My wife told me after that I looked like a barn animal and had lost my humanity. She gave me the meds and I quickly downed three laxative pills, (now totaling 6) and I sat and waited. Nearing close to 1pm I started getting desperate. My bladder was starting to make my stomach feel extremely painful and bloated and the poo that was halfway out my butt had somehow cut off all circulation to my bladder and so I was unable to pee. By this point I had drunken around three liters of water, two cups of orange juice and a large cup of black coffee totaling around a gallon of liquid in a matter of 2 hours. I had been eyeing the “Fleet Enemas” for some time now, they were four cylinders with a sharp tip designed to be thrust up your anus. The box said that you were to lay on your side and insert the demonic “Enema” device roughly 2-3 inches up your anus and pour about 8oz of liquid into your rectal cavity and wait as the deadly concoction started “stimulating” your butt to poo. I didn’t want to do it but at this point I became animalistic. ChatGPT told me even though poo was halfway out my butt (extremely painful as is) I could still jam an enema syringe up my butt and get the job done. So I tried. I tried locating my butt hole with all my might but the whole ordeal had left my area numb and I simply couldn’t find it. I tried desperately for what felt like hours and simply couldn’t. Finally on the third bottle of 8oz of satans liquid, I thought I found my butthole. I lodged in between the butter bread baby and started squirting it as much as I could and then waited. I felt relief knowing after 6 laxatives and 3 enemas that I would finally get this load of bread out of my gut. Nothing. My legs, which were already aching so bad I couldn’t sleep the night prior at this point were feeling paralyzed and I started losing consciousness. 

At this point I received a text that I still can’t explain to this day my wife texted me and said “This is karma.” I replied “This is a horrible nightmare” I then demanded fruit and Gatorade. I downed a Gatorade accepting the bladder infection that awaited and started eating apples. I ate two apples and then lettuce. I ate roughly two heads of romaine lettuce, thinking it would help. ChatGPT told me to try walking around and so I had become so desperate I was standing like the hunchback of notre dame reaching around and gyrating my hips like Elvis probably did the moments before he died of constapation in a hotel room. I was zoned out, an animal and desperate. At this point I thought about calling 911 but I couldn’t imagine what they could do with me, would they reach down and try and yank it out? The thought was worse than sitting there and going unconscious. 

After over three hours of this ChatGPT told me to try Magnesium Citrate, it said that it was an extremely powerful laxative that will work in 30 minutes. I was shook because I remembered buying it before for some other purpose and thought it might be in the drawer. I begged my wife to look for it. She searched and couldn’t find it. I stared at the wall in horror. Then I asked her to check one more time and I FaceTimed her. Then… by the grace of God she found it. She brought it to me and I downed three pills, 400mg instantly. At this point I had taken 9 pills, drunken a gallon of water, and shoved three enemas up my butt on top of the other things I had done. Then I waited. A strange peace settled over me. I felt that Jesus had answered my prayer and provided me with the magneism. I was getting close to the four hour point when I began to feel a rumble in my stomach. I thought I would try and push it out one more time and that’s when the most bizarre thing of all happened. Suddenly, I felt enormous contractions in my stomach that seemed to pull my entire body. It was like my entire insides were being squeezed with enormous force, completely uncontrolled. About ten seconds later a giant contraction hit my stomach that didn’t stop I almost couldn’t breath (totally involuntary) and started forcing the bread out of my stomach. It was an almost spiritual experience. And after about thirty seconds it was gone. I stood up, almost couldn’t believe I was still alive. Everything hurt, but it was gone. It stopped up the toilet and there’s a whole process it took me to get it down, but it was finished. I thanked God for saving me, and started cleaning up. I looked at the clock it was 2:45pm. I had been on the toilet for 3 hours and 54 minutes. 

TL;DR: This was all my fault. I should have never eaten half a loaf of butter bread after taking Oxy. What would you have done differently? ",4,1736703902.0,tifu,5,0.75,False

In the past months, I conducted multiple experiments with programmatic SEO and would like to share some tips here. By the end of this guide, I hope you’ll learn how *not* to go about programmatic SEO, so your website doesn’t get into Google’s spam filters — as happened to one of my experiments. This guide will cover:

1. How to come up with an idea?
2. Keyword research and tools
3. Why is buying a good domain name important?
4. Backlink building and why it is important
5. Future of programmatic SEO

# 1. How to Come Up with an Idea?

Every successful programmatic SEO project starts with a solid idea. But how do you come up with one? Start by identifying a niche or industry you’re passionate about or familiar with. Your understanding of the niche can provide a competitive edge.

If you can’t come up with an idea easily, it means you need to do some research. There are tons of ways to generate ideas, and I’ll list a few effective methods here.

**Find Datasets with Poor UI and Transform Them into Great Websites**

One of the best platforms for discovering datasets is **Kaggle**, which hosts thousands of searchable datasets. As of now, Kaggle lists more than 400,000 datasets.

***Pro Tip:*** *Transforming datasets with subpar interfaces into user-friendly and visually appealing websites can be a winning strategy.*

**Leverage Your Own Datasets to Gain a Competitive Advantage**

If you run an existing business or side hustle, chances are you already have access to data that no one else has.

For example, consider the **JobTest** website. Users complete a quiz and receive career recommendations based on their answers to multiple-choice questions. This unique data could easily be utilized to create programmatic SEO pages, giving you a significant edge over competitors.

JobTest could easily use their quiz data to create **skill-based pages** that highlight careers suited to specific skills identified in the quiz, such as problem-solving or creativity. For instance, pages like */careers-for-problem-solvers* or */careers-for-creative-thinkers* could summarize job opportunities for individuals with these strengths. These pages could rank for searches like “Careers for creative people” or “Jobs for problem solvers.”

**Scrape publicly available data and transform it with existing AI tools**

If you don’t have proprietary data, another great option is to scrape publicly available data. The key is not just scraping but transforming this raw data into something unique, insightful, and user-friendly. For example:

• Scrape real estate listings and create a hyper-localized property directory.

• Collect restaurant menu data to build a comprehensive food discovery platform.

• Use AI tools like GPT-based models or Stable Diffusion for creative enhancements such as summarizing reviews, generating captions, or even creating visuals.

**Start Backward: Understand Monetization First**

Before finalizing your idea, it’s crucial to think about **how you’ll monetize your website**. This should be a significant factor in your decision-making process. A brilliant idea without a clear path to revenue can lead to wasted effort and frustration.

• Will you monetize through **ads**, **affiliate marketing**, or **direct sales**?

• Does the niche have products, services, or opportunities with sufficient earning potential?

• Are there high-value keywords or industries you can target for premium ad placements?

 ***The key takeaway.*** *A successful programmatic SEO idea solves a real user problem while leveraging unique or underutilized data to create value — and has a clear path to monetization. Once you have your idea, you’re ready to move on to the next step —* ***keyword research****!*

# 2. Keyword Research and Tools

Everyone knows tools like **Ahrefs**, **SEMRush**, and similar SEO platforms. We also know they can be expensive as hell! If you can afford them, great — but there are effective, **free alternatives** to get you started.

A combination of **Google Ads Keyword Planner**, **Google Trends**, and (if possible) a short-term subscription to Ahrefs can work wonders for your keyword research workflow. Even if you subscribe to Ahrefs for just one month, it should provide enough value to kickstart your process. Let me break down how to use these tools together for maximum efficiency.

**Start with Google Ads Keyword Planner: Finding Keyword Opportunities**

Google Ads Keyword Planner is fantastic for discovering high-volume, low-competition keywords. Here’s how to use it effectively:

• **Search for Seed Keywords**: Start with a broad keyword related to your niche. For example, if you’re building a **directory for board games**, you might begin with **“board games”** as your seed keyword. From there, explore related categories like **Popular board games (**“best board games 2025”, “top-rated board games.”, etc)

• **Analyze Metrics**: Look at the **search volume** and **competition**. Prioritize keywords with:

* Moderate to high search volume (e.g., >= 1K searches per month).
* Low to medium competition (keep in mind this metric relates to paid ads, but it still gives a rough idea of keyword viability).

• **Look for Trends**: Use the **“Year-over-Year Change”** metric to identify keywords with growing popularity. For example, if **“solo board games”** or **“board games for couples”** shows a significant increase in search volume over the past year, it indicates rising demand.

 ***Pro Tip:*** *Export your keyword list and organize it by search volume and competition. This will help you prioritize effectively.*

**Use Google Trends: Validating Growth Potential**

Google Trends is a great tool for validating the potential of keywords identified in Keyword Planner. Here’s how to integrate it into your workflow:

• **Check Seasonal Trends**: Search for your keyword in Google Trends to see its popularity over time. For example, “**board games**” might spike in the winter months, indicating seasonal demand.

• **Compare Related Keywords**: Use the comparison feature to check multiple related keywords. For instance, compare “**solo board games**” and “**board games for couples**” to see which has the most consistent or growing interest.

• **Spot Emerging Trends**: Look at related queries and “rising” terms for ideas that are gaining traction but aren’t yet oversaturated.

***Pro Tip:*** *Filter by location and timeframe to get insights tailored to your target audience (e.g., “United States” and “past 12 months”).*

**Leverage Ahrefs: Deep Dive into Keyword and Competitor Analysis**

If you can afford Ahrefs, even for a month, it can add a lot of depth to your research.

• **Check Keyword Difficulty (KD)**: Ahrefs provides a **Keyword Difficulty** score, helping you identify terms that are easier to rank for. Combine this with the volume data from Keyword Planner for a more informed decision.

• **Analyze Competitor Pages**: Enter the top-ranking URLs for your target keywords into Ahrefs’ **Site Explorer**. Look for:

* Content gaps: Topics or subtopics that competitors missed.
* Backlink profiles: Opportunities for your site to acquire similar backlinks.

• **Discover Long-Tail Keywords**: Use the “Questions” feature in Ahrefs to find long-tail variations of your keywords. These are often easier to rank for and attract highly targeted traffic.

• **Monitor Trends with SERP Features**: Ahrefs shows which SERP features (e.g., featured snippets, FAQs) dominate for a given keyword. This insight can help you optimize your content format.

**How to Combine These Tools Effectively**

1. **Start Broad (Keyword Planner)**: Use Google Ads Keyword Planner to generate a list of potential keywords with volume and competition data.

2. **Refine and Validate (Google Trends)**: Cross-check these keywords in Google Trends to identify seasonal patterns and validate their growth potential.

3. **Deep Dive (Ahrefs)**: For your top 10–20 keywords, use Ahrefs to:

* Assess competition.
* Analyze top-ranking pages.
* Discover long-tail variations.

4. **Iterate**: Repeat the process for additional keyword ideas, refining your list as you go.

**Final Tip***: The sweet spot is identifying keywords with:*

*•* ***High search volume.***

*•* ***Low keyword difficulty (KD).***

*•* ***Consistent or growing interest over time.***

*•* ***Room for unique content (e.g., underserved niches or content gaps).***

# 3. Why Buying a Good Domain Name Is Important

Your domain name is the cornerstone of your website’s identity. It’s the first impression potential visitors get, often before they’ve even clicked through to your site. Imagine browsing search results for information about coffee brewing. Would you trust [**coffeelovers.org**](http://coffeelovers.org) or **best-coffee-for-you123.info**? The difference is stark, and it shows why your choice of domain matters. A well-chosen domain can establish trust, improve visibility, and make your site memorable, while a poorly chosen one can do the opposite.

**Extensions Matter Too**

While the coveted **.com** extension is often the first choice, it’s not the only viable option. In fact, alternatives like **.org** or **.net** can lend credibility, especially for non-commercial or informational sites. For instance, a directory for community art projects might thrive with a name like [**localarts.org**](http://localarts.org), suggesting a resource-driven platform. Meanwhile, opting for an unusual or unfamiliar extension — think **.xyz** or **.biz** — can raise red flags for users accustomed to more traditional domains.

# Good and Bad Examples Speak for Themselves

***Good Examples:***

1. [**bookfinder.org**](http://bookfinder.org) — Straightforward, professional, and clearly conveys its purpose.

2. [**studyresources.net**](http://studyresources.net) — Focused and reliable, suitable for an educational platform.

3. [**localarts.org**](http://localarts.org) — Suggests a trustworthy and community-driven resource for art projects.

4. [**healthdirect.org**](http://healthdirect.org) — Clean and professional, ideal for a healthcare directory.

***Bad Examples:***

1. [**books-4u-online.info**](http://books-4u-online.info) — Cluttered with unnecessary symbols and a weak extension.

2. [**studies-helper101.biz**](http://studies-helper101.biz) — Overly generic and unprofessional, with a questionable extension.

3. [**local-artz.xyz**](http://local-artz.xyz) — Misspelling and unfamiliar extension reduce credibility.

4. [**healthfindersnow123.com**](http://healthfindersnow123.com) — Hard to remember and untrustworthy due to random numbers.

***Pro Tip****:* *When brainstorming a domain, imagine telling someone about it verbally. If you’d need to explain the spelling, symbols, or numbers, it’s not the right choice. Stick with clarity and simplicity to make your site easy to trust and revisit.*

# 4. Backlink Building and Why It Is Important

Backlinks are the lifeblood of SEO. They signal to search engines that your website is valuable and trustworthy, helping you rank higher and attract more visitors. For new websites, backlinks are even more critical — they’re like a stamp of approval that gets you noticed. But not all backlinks are created equal. Here’s how to build them the right way.

**List Your Website on Relevant Directories**

Directories aren’t just for directories — they’re a solid starting point for any website. Find directories that are closely related to your niche and list your site there. Be selective. Posting your link on random, irrelevant directories will do more harm than good, spoiling your website’s profile in the eyes of search engines.

***Pro Tip****: If your website is about sustainable fashion, list it on directories focused on eco-friendly living, fashion resources, or green business tools. Avoid directories that are generic dumping grounds for random links — they can hurt your credibility.*

**Engage on Social Media**

Social media platforms like Facebook groups or Twitter threads can also be effective. The key is to engage authentically. No one likes a spammer, but everyone appreciates a valuable resource.

**Comment on Blogs and Articles**

Find blogs, news articles, or discussion threads relevant to your website’s niche. Comment thoughtfully and add your link only when it adds value. Even if these links are “nofollow” (meaning they don’t pass much SEO value), they still help with visibility and may drive direct traffic.

For instance, if your website is about home fitness, look for articles about workout trends, leave insightful comments, and link to your site where it genuinely contributes to the conversation.

**Work Long Enough, and Opportunities Will Find You**

Building backlinks takes time, but here’s the thing: if you consistently create high-quality content and keep improving your website, opportunities will come your way. Influencers will notice your work, bloggers will link to it, and other websites will want to collaborate.

Patience is the name of the game. Focus on making your website so good that people can’t ignore it. Keep improving, keep sharing, and let your work speak for itself.

# 5. Future of programmatic SEO

The rise of AI is reshaping how people interact with information online. Standard content-based websites are at risk of becoming obsolete as AI generates instant answers to questions. But directories and programmatic SEO projects built around datasets have a unique advantage — **they offer functionality that AI or plain text cannot replicate effectively.**

When users need to compare multiple options — whether it’s products, services, or anything else — a text-based AI response just doesn’t cut it. The best user experience for comparisons is visual and interactive. Think side-by-side comparisons, sortable tables, and detailed filters. These are features that programmatic SEO excels at, and they’re something AI simply can’t deliver in a conversational format.

For example:

• **Visualization**: Allow users to explore data through graphs, heatmaps, or charts.

• **Interactive Comparisons**: Enable users to scroll through lists, filter by specific attributes, or compare options side by side.

• **Niche-Specific Insights**: Build tools tailored to your dataset, like calculators, personalized recommendations, or resource aggregators.

In a future where AI dominates traditional Q&A searches, programmatic SEO websites that focus on functionality and unique datasets will thrive. They won’t just provide information — they’ll empower users to interact with it in ways that AI-generated text cannot.",0,1736703855.0,SEO,0,0.5,False

Components: spice cake, blackberry buttercream,  coffee rum buttercream, and meringue horns.

The cons: my husband said the cake was too thick so we cut it in half. When I put the reference picture sticker on there, I think we should've left it at normal thickness. I do not have the piping tip for this one (St. Honore would've been best) so the piping is... questionable at best. This was the 3rd attempt of scratching of icing and trying again 😅. The coffee buttercream was good, but, wow did it overpower the entire cake. The meringue came out fine, but lost some much color while baking. 

In the game, it uses goat butter, so I did too. I personally like goat cheese and the like so it was interesting. My husband hates goat products so he is not a fan. I only put it in the cake, but it does have a notable flavor difference, mainly as an ending flavor note. ",5,1736703820.0,projectpigeonmilk,0,1.0,False

Now ive booked a solo trip in April for portugal and my dad is begging me not to go saying how upset and worried hell be and what if i never come home. Ive put my foot down that i am going this time but he wont stop and hes making me feel guilty about going solo travelling. My friends have gone solo travelling and they were surprised at my Dads reaction. Its awkward now because im avoiding him as ill know he'll bring it up which makes me feel even guiltier. Dad doesnt like me going out clubbing or taking ubers home and worries about me everytime i go out into the city. He doesnt like me taking ubers from male uber drivers. My mum calls me when im out with my friends asking when ill be home and when i say ill be home in the next hour, then they'll call again asking why im not home yet. I dont text them all the time when i should because ill be in a conversation with my friends and my train will be delayed.  When i get in theyll be like why didnt you text us saying your train was delayed and i start to feel smothered. I wish they would be more relaxed.I know i should be updating my parents when transport is delayed but i can get myself home and dont see why they should worry because i am responsible.

I feel so smothered and that i cant spend time on my own genuinely relaxing because i feel guilty that im not spending time with my parents but when i spend time with my parents they tell me how they miss me and why dont they like me and why arent they spending time with me. i understand it comes from love but i just want them to understand that it isnt them and that sometimes i need alone time but they dont get it/ like it.

  
I think im on the spectrum so alone time is important but my dad everytime i try and bring it up that im on the spectrum he just says that im victimising myself and making excuses for my bad behaviour and being a selfish daughter. i do behave badly tbh. I have anger problems and always had  but the only people i get angry at are my parents. It's because i feel smothered and frustrated. My mum comes into my room without knocking, shell start cleaning my room and wont stop when i tell her gently the first time mum its fine ill do it i just want to be left alone at the moment but she just carries on and it takes me to scream at her after asking her 5 times to please leave me alone because i feel that my personal space is being invaded and i just want to be left alone but she wont listen to me and it makes me scream out of frustration. Their reaction to all this behaviour is that we do this because we love and care about you which i get but they refuse to change their behaviour and then continuously wonder why i always have a short fuse with them. i feel so guilty about it because im 22 and shouldnt be behaving like this but i feel that i cant do anything without being watched.

  
When i go out my mum asks where are you going, who are you going with, what time are you back, what will you be doing. its gotten to the point where ill only tell her im going out when im acc at the door putting my shoes on and ill say mum im going out and leave before she 'interrogates' me. Nothing bad has ever happened to me whilst im out, most the time im out into town on the day getting a coffee but i still feel so smothered. When i used to work in hospitality my mum used to write down all my shifts and times in her diary so she would know all the time when i was supposed to be at work. Idk but it just frustrates me i wish i would be trusted to just do my own thing yet i feel so controlled all the time. My dad is desperate for me to download a tracker on my phone but i flat out refuse because then i know i would never hear the end of it when they realise im on a date with a guy or im at some guys house choosing what i want to do knowing that they know where i am. 

  
I fucked up recently as i got drunk at a work party, called my dad to come pick me up and then forgot he was there and he was there waiting for me for an hour. I apologised profusely and have apologised multiple times but he wont drop it and still brings it up. That was the only time ive done something like that. My parents were angry that id made him wait and angry that i had gotten drunk and the next morning my mum gave me a whole lecture about how i shouldnt be drinking that much and that i should always be mindful and thats its bad for your health and it shows you up. Nothing happened for me to embarrass myself at the party but i genuinely cannot go out, drink and have fun without my mum giving me a lecture the next morning. Everytime i go out i know it will be met with judgement from my mum. 

  
I know i should be a better person but i feel too smothered by my parents to be allowed to relax and make my own choices without any guilt from them. If they stood back then i would feel more relaxed. I would scream at them less which i feel guilty for but i scream at them out of frustration and they they say look youre getting angry and raising your voice again but the reason i raise my voice is because they dont listen to me and they dismiss me and so i get more frustrated with having to repeat myself that it results in me screaming.

Reasoning with them is out of the question because they wont accept my point of view of things and tell me im wrong when i explain to them how i feel living here. 

Like i said i know im a shitty daughter so you dont need to berate me anymore in the comments.

I picked up a package of both the Vanilla Chai and Matcha flavors at Whole Foods the other night while they were about $30 rather than the normal $60. I had been interested in trying them for awhile and had intended to use them as a hot morning beverage since I’m currently avoiding coffee due to gastritis. I thought pairing the powder with either chickpea milk or Fairlife would give me 30-33g of protein before I even make my protein smoothie for breakfast.

Yesterday I warmed up a cup of unsweetened chickpea milk and added a scoop of the matcha and not only was it too thick to sip out of a coffee cup, but it was also very, very sweet. I switched to a smoothie straw and was able to finish it, but it was not a pleasant experience.

Yesterday afternoon, I decided to blend 12oz of Fairlife with a scoop of the vanilla chai thinking more liquid would help and it was through the roof sweet, way more than the matcha. I added a cup of cauliflower to the blender and that seemed to just intensify the sweet. I had to throw it out.

This morning, I tried to recreate one of my favorite pumpkin chai smoothies and added a cup of unsweetened chickpea milk, a scoop of vanilla chai, half a banana, and half a cup of pumpkin and it was so sweet (the banana definitely intensified the sweet so that was a mistake on my part). I added a cup of spinach and that did blunt the sweetness a bit, but it also covered up the chai flavor and now just takes like banana bread.

I think I can probably return this if I have to, but I’d like to make them work since they have such clean ingredients and I actually find they mix in really easily and have a smooth texture. Ideally, I’d love to go the morning hot beverage route, but open to smoothies too. I also have a Ninja Creami so that’s an option as well.

Alternatively, what are some other clean products that wouldn’t be so sweet? I’ve been using the Hemp Yeah! with just hemp seeds in my morning smoothies. It’s okay, but I wouldn’t mind more protein and it does tend to make things awfully thick and chunky.

As far as products I have liked:

I LOVE the Fairlife Core Power vanilla but I’ve struggled to find more to purchase and they are on the pricier side. My other favorite is the OWYN vanilla and I know they sell a powder as well as the prepared shakes. I’ve also enjoyed the Koia Vanilla Bean, Coconut Almond, and Cinnamon Horchata flavors. 

Due to the gastritis, I’ve had to avoid chocolate/mint/coffee so that does limit my options a bit for both prepared drinks and powders. I work remotely so I’d like to switch over to just powders to avoid the single-use waste the majority of the time. I sampled the Orgain powders at Costco and I found it to be even more overpoweringly sweet than Truvani.

Basically, I’ve lost 120 pounds so far and would like to lose another 30 or so while still building muscle (or at least not loosing any). I don’t eat a ton of meat (TMJ issues) so always looking for ways to sneak some extra protein in :)

He wants to mainly do sculpting of figurines, probably no more than 40cm tall. For instance, he is working on a Mad Hatter character right now and has done most of the body and clothing except the head. He also previously finished a mushroom with teeth and evil eyes.

So he already has the basics, from the polymer clay, to various tools to cut, shape and make textures onto the clay.

So I'm unsure if there's anything left that he may need, except general consumables like more clay and such.

He does work on the couch on a coffee table that can be extended to be a bit higher and has complained about some back pain. Not sure if that can be improved without him moving to a proper table workspace.

Safety is pretty up there for me since this is the first time I'll ever be living alone. I'm willing to spend more than my budget if I have to to meet these requirements. 

I'd also like to be relatively close to a park or some kind of big greenland area because I like going for runs and walks when the weather is nice and do so pretty often.

The pot has drainage holes, but given the highly organic soil my main concern would be root rot, though I would expect that to affect the little one sooner. Also, they generally only receive water when the top of the soil is dry. 

The pot is in a south facing window, but doesn’t get a ton of direct sunlight due to buildings across the street. I wouldn’t expect sunlight to be an issue given the symptoms but better to give a broad description.

What could be the issue here? And what should the next steps be to either further identify the problem or treat the plant? Many thanks in advance for any given advice!",1,1736703295.0,plantclinic,0,1.0,False
1hzryb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hzryb8/is_this_person_a_red_flag_or_how_would_you_proceed/,Is this person a red flag? Or how would you proceed?,"So for context, I (35F) met this person (43F, we’ll call her “Sam.”) through social media. Sam found one of my videos on TikTok and left a pretty flirty comment, and then slid into my DMs. For the first two weeks the conversation flowed constantly; we would text nonstop and we really had a (what seemed like) a genuine connection and attraction towards one another. So we decided to see each other. I’m in the middle of a separation and was upfront with Sam about that, to which she said that was fine and she didn’t care. 

So I drive to the next state over to visit her, and I was supposed to stay with her for 2 nights. Those of you who are also in WLW relationships will understand that it’s pretty normal for things to move much quicker than in straight relationships, so this wasn’t something I wasn’t used to. Anyway, the morning of the 2nd day she called me out onto the patio and told me that we were “fundamentally different,” and that it was best if I left to go home. So I grabbed my things and left. I didn’t argue with her and I stayed calm. Before I actually started driving, I sent her a text telling her that I really do wish the best for her and that everything works out for her. This was a genuine text and I meant absolutely no malice or sarcasm behind it. She then calls me and proceeds to SCREAM at me about how I need to fix things with my (now) soon to be ex spouse and I don’t understand what she’s going through. Again, all of this was out of the blue and I didn’t argue or scream back. I stayed calm but ultimately hung up on her after she laughed in my face and I told her that we’re adults and I’m not going to be her punching bag.

Fast forward a week, and I reach out to her again. I understand I probably shouldn’t have done this, but I wanted to have a genuine conversation with her where she could just tell me what was going on with her. Anyway, we decide to start talking again. A week later I go BACK up to visit her and everything is great! The sex was amazing, we connected and had amazing conversation and spent the whole time laughing and getting to know each other. She said I make her feel seen and bring a certain softness into her life that she was missing.

So we decide we’re going to make it a weekly thing of seeing each other. But this past week, her texts are shorter and shorter. Conversation doesn’t flow like before and the flirty conversations have all but disappeared entirely. I figure she’s just really stressed and busy and try not to read into it too much. She also has a lot of trauma that she hasn’t worked through, although if you were to ask HER, she’d argue to the contrary. Because of her trauma, her outlook on life is a lot more bleak than mine. Everyone leaves, everyone lies, no one actually stays. And yet she says that she gives a relationship a few months to get better before calling it quits. My relationship/marriage that I’m separated from has lasted 14 years! And she looks at that like a disadvantage, regardless of the fact that it is a testament to how committed I am in relationships. It’s like she snubs her nose at joy! I told her all the fun things I like to do during Christmas, for example, and she just gave me this weird disgust-like look and said, “yeah you can have that. No thanks.” 

So this week again, I go up to see her. She had already said she wasn’t feeling well due to kidney pain so it was just gonna be us hanging out and whatnot. Which is fine. I don’t expect sex from anyone and that wasn’t the reason I was up there anyway. So I get up there, and aside from the peck on the lips she gave me when I came in, she didn’t show any affection towards me at all. Not holding my hand, putting her hand on my leg in the car, nothing. I thought this was weird, but again wrote it off as she just isn’t feeling well. The first night I’m there, we’re in the middle of a deep “getting to know you” conversation when she gets a call from one of her friends and excuses herself. I just stay seated on the couch and quietly wait for her to get off the phone so we can resume our conversation. 3 HOURS LATER and this woman is STILL on the phone with this same person, and what’s worse is she never once told the friend she has company earlier and would need to call her back later. So finally I just went to bed. She was still on the phone and I don’t know what time she got off.

During the night, she wanted to cuddle which I gladly welcomed. But the next morning we were back to being distant. So I just made me some coffee and did my normal routine. Around 10:30a she said she wanted to get out of the house and get a beer. It’s important to note here, that I’ve seen this girl start drinking a beer at 7:30a and that first night I was there, she had gone from about 10 beers throughout the course of the day!

So I get ready to go to the pub and we head down to the car. It has snowed the night prior and there was ice on her windshield that got dumped into her seat when she was trying to get in. I laughed at the situation but she just looks at me and goes, “it wasn’t THAT funny cause now I’m pissed and we aren’t going anywhere.” So I get out of the car and home girl is just leaving me behind not saying a word while walking back up to her apartment. At this point, the vibe is just very off so I ask her if she’d like me to go ahead and head on out. Keep in mind, the plan was for me to stay until the afternoon and by this point it’s only 11:30a. She says yeah, so I grab my stuff and go home. 

So now we’re 2 for 3 of visits that have ended in her pissed off at something and the day is ruined. I have autism and she’s made passive aggressive ableist comments about how “neurodivergent” should only apply if you are severely mentally and physically disabled where it impedes on your ability to function on your own. She also made a comment on the phone with her friend the other night about how a girl she knew was “stupid” because she doesn’t understand social cues. This woman has diagnosed autism. So now we’re 2-0 of negative comments she’s made about neurodivergence when she also knows that i myself have autism.

Her being on the phone that long the other night just felt like a massive FUCK YOU to me; like she didn’t even respect my time or even the fact that we’re were in the middle of something prior. Like I said, she never mentioned to the friend that she had company over. 

She did lose her mother 2 years ago, but I noticed in her apartment she has her mother’s ashes, and right next to them is a wooden spoon. I asked her what the significance of the spoon was, and she said it’s the same spoon her mom would beat her with! Like why would you decided to put THAT next to her urn. That that is what she chose to remember her mom with!

So…am I reading into this too much or is the woman just a straight up jerk? Is there anything I can do to pull her out from the nihilistic view of everything and everyone, or would this also be just a waste of time…",1,1736703281.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

It was full of RI and RGS drama lmao but the thing here that specifically caught my eye was someone posting about meeting this cute RI guy during mun and saying they had no chance with him. I laughed because I was like “omg I think I know the guy they’re talking about😭But he’s probably not the only RI guy at mun right??” and I was going to forget about it until I saw someone else comment on that confession going like “Hey, if this guy is the same one that I’m thinking of then I think you truly have no chance because he seemed pretty close with that other np in his council during prepmun. She’s kinda cute so I get it ngl” (Okay I appreciated getting called cute but BRO THEY MADE IT SOUND LIKE HE LIKES ME IF YOU SAW THE ACTUAL COMMENT😓 Btw this was like paraphrasing). So I screenshotted both confessions and sent it to my bsf like “okay I feel like I need to reply because people are gonna be texting me about it now😭”. So I sent in my own confession just being like “Hey so thank you for calling me cute :) I’m the other notepasser mentioned HAHA! However I don’t know if he’s single but I find it so funny that you think he likes me HAHAHA😭 Idk what he thinks about me but I doubt he even finds me attractive so shoot your shot! Good luck to the OP who likes him!” (The part OP said about the height diff between them is mad funny because bro just towers above people so yeah, everyone lowkey has a crazy height diff with him. BRO I WOULD HAVE SAID MORE BUT THERE WAS A MAX. WORD LIMIT😭 

This guy doesn’t even have my number saved or texts me besides us yapping about mun and us wishing each other merry Christmas and then again on midnight, happy 2025. Side note but it was so funny how during the council sessions, he explained to me how EP works and I was looking at him like 🧍‍♀️!?! Then I said that I was more of an European culture/folklore kind of person than politics and he was like “hmm okay! :) Share with me one thing about folklore and I’ll share one thing about politics!” and then I could not think of a good, not illegal fact so I started yapping about some old 14th century custom I read about on wikipedia like a nerd. Bro ACTUALLY listened to my yapping. I learnt so much about EP from this convo bro. I felt like an IDIOT in his presence because bro was so cool and well spoken meanwhile I had ZERO idea about EP because it wasn’t one of my hyperfixations and my brain was struggling to string a sentence together from all the mundogging I was doing.   


It was really nice of him to lend me his portable charger even though my phone was already charging but then my plug BROKE so I just ended up taking the charger😭 I randomly found this book that I really liked and I saw there weren’t any notes being passed at the time so I sat down to read it and when I looked up after being super engrossed in the book, bro was handling all the notes like a true notepassing king. I wasn’t even able to get up and pass a single note because bro was there to notepass before I could even get up from my chair. I mean, I did get to finish the book HAHAHA😭 but omggg I felt so bad that he didn’t even tell me to stop reading because he ended up doing all the work while I just sat there lost in my book about Iran. Bro even helped me put on the santa hat on Day 4 and adjusted it for me so I didn’t look ridiculous. He laughed and said I looked like an elf afterwards. (Okay bro😞) Okay the more I yap, the more I see why people think he likes me. Chat, I feel like he’s just being nice though?? (Also the coffee candy he kept sharing with me was so good OMG😭 He assumed that I liked the milk coffee ones so he gave me most of that and he ate the dark/normal coffee flavoured candy. Bro I am lowkey addicted to coffee now thanks to MUN😧. Okay he’s not wrong in his assumption that I like sweet things but I like both the dark coffee candy and the milk coffee candy. Anyway, he’s so nice wth😭 It’s so sad that he retired from Mun.

Hey, fellow travel enthusiasts! I've recently completed an amazing journey visiting 50 countries around the globe and I’m thrilled to share my unique experiences and insights with the ""Travel Trotters"" community. Each country taught me something invaluable, and I’d love to pass on my knowledge and tips to help you make the most of your own adventures.

### Finding Hidden Gems 💎

Exploring major tourist spots is a must, but finding hidden gems is what truly makes travel unforgettable. In Vietnam, wandering off the beaten path led me to a cozy family-run café in Hanoi with the best egg coffee I've ever had! To discover similar hidden treasures, I recommend chatting with locals. Don’t be shy—ask about their favorite spots and eateries. Trust me, some of the best experiences come from impromptu local recommendations.

### Embrace Cultural Differences 🌐

Each country has its customs and traditions that can range from charming to challenging. In Japan, I had to quickly adapt to bowing as a form of greeting, which felt as respectful as it was novel. Remember, being open-minded and respectful of different cultures makes for a richer travel experience. Learn a few basic words in the local language—which can be both fun and helpful. A simple “thank you” in the native tongue goes a long way.

### Travel on a Budget 💼💰

Traveling extensively doesn’t mean breaking the bank. Countries like Portugal and Thailand offer incredible experiences without the hefty price tags. I’ve had my fair share of budget-friendly adventures by using local transport, staying in hostels, and indulging in street food. Apps and websites like Couchsurfing and Skyscanner are your best friends when it comes to saving money—take full advantage of these resources!

### Safety First ⚠️

Staying safe while traveling is crucial. In bustling cities like Rio de Janeiro, keeping your belongings close and being aware of your surroundings is essential. Always have a digital and physical copy of important documents and invest in travel insurance—it’s worth the peace of mind.

I (27F) diagnosed with mild stomach ulcers around 4 years ago, I was given some meds and doctors said no follow up is needed. After that, my stomach has mild bloating occationally but not frequent, at least it didn't bother me at all.

I have a happy stomach pain free period untill one or two year from today. Normally I suffer from bloating or stomach pain when I didn't have meals regularly. But recently, I suffered  from bloating at night regardless I eat my meals regularly, I tried to have early dinner before 7:30pm at least. Bloating often starts from 10/11pm. When I wake up in the morning, the bloating is almost gone. 

The bloating is so big that it causes pain to breath or move. I'm worried and devastated for an answer. I went to doctor half year ago and she gave me some meds to balance the stomach acid but I don't think it works.

I also suffer from constipation very recently for around 3 months, I have stool every 2-3 days. They are often hard and small. 

For my diet, I cut off coffee and replace it with Matcha, no milk and minimal sugars in take. I usually have meals with half red meat half veges, sometimes some noodles/ pastas. I only use salt, pepper, soy sauce and little bit of sugars for seasoning. 

I drank at least 1.5L of liquid every day.
My only not so healthy habits is I'm not exercising regularly.

i.e. A grande iced latte with normal shots + 4 pumps of syrup is equal in taste (particularly sweetness) to the same latte with ristretto shots + 2 pumps of syrup.

(my apologies for the length),"I (35F) have been working as an Admissions Counselor (AC) for a private, not-for-profit university for about 3 months now. It took them a full, very long 30 days to call me back, so I was excited that I was awarded the job and could finally start. It's a 10min drive from my home, pays beautifully, has inexpensive but superb benefits, and looks wonderful on paper and sounds great in conversation. It really does. No denying that. I am actually proud when I tell people what I do. What I have to ask myself is: *What am I willing to put up with to continue receiving the salary and benefits?*

Not long after I started, they sent us on a business trip about an 1.5hrs away for 3 nights and 4 days where we learned from some of the Big Wigs, including the Founder. I was told by boss prior that I should be ON MY TOES AT ALL TIMES, as I am representing her and our particular campus. She basically threatened that there would be a report written up about each of us and how much or little we participated, our appearance, whether or not we were at least a half hour early, etc. I had to go out and get a nice blazer that fit me correctly just for this trip, with very little notice (we don't wear those in the office FYI). She scared the LIVING SHIT out of all of this over this trip—we were shaking in our boots, only to discover that it was NOT that serious. Yes, we should obviously take it seriously, but we were way too fucking nervous! When we all got back from the trip, the supposed ""reports"" were never mentioned again. 1st red flag confirmed.

I knew from the initial interview that we are expected to do 80-100 dials per day, and 1-2 hours of total talk time... ""smile and dial!"". It took me a few weeks to be able to work up to 80 dials. If we failed to do that, we were told that we needed to work on our Time Management and were questioned if we were really serious about our role.

The metrics and tabs on EVERYTHING about us is nothing short of insane. In addition to monitoring every text/call/email, internal chat message, calendar surveillance, etc... I know for a fact that they record how many keystrokes we make per hour, how often the mouse is moved, and more overkill data of that nature. Our calls are all recorded and some (who knows how many) are listened to for critique, and from what I've heard—some are played an entire meetings of coworkers to hear. My boss literally told us that on her 1hr15min drive home, she can listen to our calls on an app on her phone through her car's Bluetooth system... I could have lived just fine without knowing about this supposed and frankly really creepy threat. As if we weren't already scared shitless about perhaps breathing too loud.

Despite the Big Brother 24/7/365 surveillance, we are still required to manually put an emailed report together the for the Director of Admissions (DOA) & Assistant Director (AD) at the end of each shift. This includes tasks (current, overdue, future), potentials, interviews, contacts, appointments, and the table that includes all of our phone/text/email totals, in addition to a custom attached Excel spreadsheet. It's almost as if they couldn't look all this up for themselves! I send this report at the last minute of my shift because truthfully, I don't want to have to deal with any replies until the next day and simply don't have time.

Please also note we can get into hot water if we are in the building too late or too early, because then they have to pay our mandatory armed security OT. That was a HUGE thing BTW.

Almost every single morning, there is a lovely email from my boss sitting in my inbox just waiting for me to open. I can feel it as soon as out my Outlook loads:

* ""*Why were your dials so low?*""
* ""*What happened?*""
* ""*We need to talk.*""
* ""*You must comply immediately.*""
* ""*Come to my office first thing.*""
* ""*Our conversation raises concerns...*""
   * *Etc, etc, etc*

What did I do that was so bad? If I don't make the 80 dials, there IS a reason and no, it's not because I'm goofing off or on my phone. There's no time for that. Sometimes I have 2-3 student appointments that can take anywhere between 1-2 hours. I'm expected to take incoming calls that can be lengthy (some lasting 30 mins), and then needing to make notes and update statuses in the system, let the assigned counselor be aware of it, etc. I have to squeeze in the 80-100 dials. I have to reply to student emails, group chat text messages between the department, and try my best whenever I have a moment to help older workers learn the new punch in/punch out system which often malfunctions, and random due diligence things (ex: sending reminder text & emails manually for upcoming appointments). I have to, of course, take a 1hr unpaid lunch and believe me, it is fully necessary to at least try to recalibrate your brain in that slot. If you want to take a 15-min break, you must email a formal request to all 3 receptionists, and copy the DOA & AD. Sometimes the time I requested to take the break comes and goes, and is never acknowledged. We are legally entitled to 2 approved 15-min breaks but it's such a production, most coworkers only take 1 if they really need it. There's a sort of undertone of being ""*lazy*"" if you take 2 of those 15-min breaks. I don't know that for a fact... but you can feel it and the table they periodically send out tells everyone how many breaks you took and when...

If you have to use the bathroom, you must say ""RR"" (restroom) to the group chat so there is an explanation why your chat status is ""*Be right back*"" and you are absent at your desk. One poor guy got back from lunch and had to go the bathroom, said ""RR"" to the chat, and our boss called him out in front of the entire department chat saying, ""*Did you not just get back from lunch?*"" Lady. When you gotta go, YOU GOTTA GO. Sometimes, it just does not line up perfectly! Happened to me and I was terrified but luckily, it flew under the radar somehow. I've never been so stressed about the bathroom in my life and I have had many different jobs is plenty of industries.

SAME THING: If you're away from your desk at the Printer, you must also state the to the group chat so there is an explanation why your chat status is ""*Be right back*"" and you are absent at your desk. This feature also stops incoming calls to your computer. When you do return to your cubicle, you can get into deep shit if you don't immediately change your status back to *Available* (green) to be able to resume getting incoming calls. Even for someone as organized as me, I sometimes forget because there's so many status changes per shift and chaos happening within the office. There's too many moving parts at times, and that is just the nature of this higher education beast.

As I said, I've only been there for about 3 months. Within that time, 4 AC's have left. 1 person was there for a year, and the other 3 were there for about how long I was—2 quit, 2 were fired. I don't know all the details, but I could guess. From the very beginning,I also couldn't help but notice from the that there's \~35 different former AC names in our system over the past 2 years—people I have never, ever heard of. Yet another massive red flag. What happened to all of those people? Quit? Fired? Laid off? Leave of absence? 2-weeks notice? Walk-out? I will never know. Why is turnover so severe and what is being done to retain people besides ordering us free lunches? That's very nice, but it is not enough. The stress at one point was giving me literal chest pains, and I have a family history of cardiac problems.

We're really intended to have 4 receptionists. We only have 3, and one had her last day on Friday. Another one is putting in their 2-weeks notice (after they burn through their stashed PTO) because they've HAD IT with the place after 2 years. They're interviewing new people but how helpful could warm bodies in that have only just started? They're not going to know much for a while—it's not about them, there's just a steep learning curve and very strict demeanor to our working environments. And might I add that we need one receptionist MINIMUM at that Front Desk from 7:30am-8:30pm M-F, as well has 5hrs on Saturday. If you can't tell... the structure is surely imploding, people.

I have been required to work 6-day work weeks around the holidays. The OT is undeniably nice, but I prefer having a full 2 days off from work to reset because of how intense work can get sometimes. I'd rather have no OT and have more recovery time, but it is what it is.

The day after New Year's, I came in at 8am. Well, actually 7:45am because they REQUIRE that you are 15-mins early before you clock in to get coffee, go to the bathroom, whatever. By 9am, she rolled up on my desk and asked how many calls I had taken so far. THE PHONE HAD NOT RUNG YET. I told her this and she didn't believe me. Go check your metrics.

We got into a big thing because I was focusing less on my 80 dials and more about answering incoming calls. ""*Why are you not hitting 80?*"" So I focused on the 80+ and skipped incoming calls and let other people answer them so I could meet my quota. Then it became, ""*Why are you ignoring incoming calls?*"" Sometimes, it is simply not POSSIBLE to do both among all the other unmentioned tasks that are assigned daily to everyone. During this ultra serious and important meeting, she said, ""*You seem nervous. Why?*"" Uh, yeah, I'm wondering if you're about to fire me on the spot and I'm mentally preparing for the blow in front of the AD.

This university has quickly become what people on Glassdoor are calling a ""*diploma mill*"". Here are some of the reviews that have been said by ACs of 20+ campuses:

* ""*Management will obscure the truth, if not flat out lie to you. Admissions, albeit a well-oiled machine, acts a predatory call center. Expect to make upwards of 100 calls on a day without appointments. The leads are lukewarm at best, often resulting in conversations with people who had no intention of enrolling. However, you are expected to convince a prospect to come to campus for an extended interview. You will be told your goal is to ""make a shared decision"" with a proapective student after subjecting them to what often becomes an hour long information gathering session. If a prospect is remotely qualified, you will be instructed to enroll them on the spot or push an unrealistic timeframe to complete enrollment. Expect to be micromanaged at every turn. Whether while actively on a call during an interview, and after an unsuccessful interview. The latter often stemming from not pressuring an unsure prospect into a generalist program, citing that ""they can change majors after they figure out their end goal."" Don't be mistaken, this is a sales position masquerading as admissions. Campus tours are optional, prospects are pressured into hasty decisions costing almost $20,000 immediately, and you will be expected to hit quotas. Meeting and exceeding quotas has zero incentive outside of a sheet of paper effevtively saying ""good job!' Falling short of quotas results in increased micromanaging. Doing so repeatedly will see you put into ethically comprimising situations. The company as a whole touts itself as non-profit, focusing on in demand career education. This could not be further from the truth. For those recent graduates who do not apply for this role, but find that a manager has reached out to you directly to offer an interview, take this review into consideration. Do not take this position in haste for the sake of convenience. Do not give up on yourself or the aspirations that drove you to complete your degree. There is something better out there for you.*""
   * **Advice to Management:** ""*Treat your employees like people, not cogs in the machine. I don't mean more potlucks, pizza in the office, or candy bowls in the directors office. Give counselors a reason to want to come to work outside of the shallow emotional appeals. Ultimately, be honest with the counselors and encourage them to do so as well.*""
* ""*All they care about is their enrollment numbers. It doesn't matter how many students actually graduate or how many end up in crippling debt.*""
* ""*Terrible management, They only care about the money, not the student, filed as a non profit, but operates as a for profit school, XXXXX are both on the board of for profit colleges. Why if they are a non profit? they are over priced and ruin students life.*""
* ""*They will fire you without cause or notice. During Covid they furloughed a bunch of people (which should have shown them how they are) for nearly a year. Just a few months ago they let go I'd say tens to hundreds of loyal long term professors and others at every branch right before the holidays. RUTHLESS. They do not pay well. They cut some of the salaries of the employees they retained from 40 hour a week employees to 30 hours taking away 1/4 of their salaries. This is a toxic work environment. In many ways this is a diploma mill. A lot of the students that make it through various programs remain uneducated and are unhirable. All this University cares about is money, Oh, and the not for profit status is a joke. This ""University"" is very much a for profit institution at its core. No one but the newly hired (less than 6th months) are happy here because they don't know better. This place hemorrhages employees. It's awful. Take my advice and DO NOT come to work here. You will absolutely regret it. And for god's sake, DO NOT MOVE from somewhere else to work here! This is an unsecure employment option. If you get hired on here you will regret it!*""
* ""*This is essentially a call center that demands a college degree Please do not do this to yourself*""
   * **Advice to Management:** ""*Stop micromanaging.*""
* ""*No work/life balance, I witnessed an employee who had been working there for 14 years get told he couldn’t take a week off for his earned vacation time. And it wasn’t even during the last enrollment week or during the 3 month blackout period they have. The inconsistent schedule is not sustainable for anyone craving a consistent schedule in their life. The pressure to push people who don’t want to go to an expensive private school feels immoral at times. You get blamed for students who simply don’t want to be six figures in student loan debt.*""
   * **Advice to Management:** ""*Stop making it seem like a call center and stop treating humans like nothing but money bags, your acceptance rate is publicly high to put on a 'hard to get' act. It should present as a respectable institution and not a cheap scam.*""
* ""*Look at students as numbers and dollars, not people. Thankless job. No room for growth. Micromanagement is excessive!*""
* ""*They lie about the position and what it entails. The position is more sales than anything. Very high metrics that are not sustainable. Preys on the black and brown community. Constant write ups if you don’t make over 200 calls a day. They recently were also sued and that loss details can be found publicly.*""
* ""N*o work/life balance Student's first at the expense of employees mental health Rolling admissions is inhumane (over 12 start dates/year) One of the WORST jobs I've ever had.*""
   * **Advice to Management:** ""*Just because the schedule for admissions worked in the past, does not mean that it's working now. If you want to keep people employed, give them a work life balance. No more rolling admissions.*""
* ""*Micromanaging. Telemarketing. It is a sales job. Monthly numbers/goals. Lot of pressure to reach goals. Goals are usually unrealistic.*""
   * **Advice to Management:** ""*Stop focusing on making money / looking at every new student as a walking dollar sign. Focus on the needs of your employees and promote a healthy work/life balance.*
* ""*micro management. Couldn't go a more than a hour or two without having to check in.*""
* ""*This is a sales position not 'admissions'. You are expected to hit sales quotas. If you have a college degree you will feel bad for signing ppl up for an unethical school. This school preys on minorities and less fortunate individuals. Look into their most recent lawsuit and read for yourself.*""
* ""*Awful, manipulative, dramatic leadership and staff*""
* ""*Constantly calling people even when they block, hang up or yell at you. Senior staff are a clique despite promoting being a family'. Job security based on if you can convince ppl to come for interviews and apply despite financial capability or true academic guidance*""
* ""*Micromanage, unrealistic goals, money hungry, horrible hours*""
* ""*Managers can be cut throat*""
* ""*Management is out of touch? likes to use bullying and threats to manage. Kills the vibe and demoralizing.  No work/life balance. Hours until 9pm for no reason and the hours aren't it. Quotas aren't realistic based on the current world.*""
* ""*High Turnover Rate. Calling center work place. Meeting quotas is expected but not realistic.  Only 10 PTO.. Can’t take PTO during 3-month blocked summer season.*""
   * **Advice to Management:** ""*Understand that employees can get exhausted with this sort of job quickly.*""
* ""*Very call-center strategy, deposits are all that matters here. Very horrible work environment. Leadership unwilling or unable to adapt to positive change.*""
   * **Advice to Management:** ""*Move away from a for-profit model and actually work towards helping students, rather than putting them deeper into debt for a degree worth less than their high school diploma.*""
* ""*Administration from the campus president down through departmental management leaves a lot to be desired. The many leadership books that find their homes on the shelves in the offices occupied by management clearly serve solely as office decor. There is no clear evidence that director of admissions or the campus president have attempted to implement any true leadership choosing to stick with the ""manage by fear and intimidation"" and ""career aspirations outside of XXXXX is a personal insult to us "" way of guiding. This is unfortunate because there is so much potential for this to be a great place to work.*""
   * **Advice to Management:** ""*Recognize that many (likely most) of your employees that choose to stay is because of the compensation, not because they enjoy working there. Yes, they may love what they do, but they do not love where they do it. Find better ways to show that you care about your people, listen to their ideas, coach them (and not just when the office of the chancellor makes a visit to save face).*""
* ""*Management is lacking serious leadership. Remember people don't quit companies they quit bad managers.*""
* ""*Unhealthy toxic work environment. Too many chefs in the kitchen. During 'blackout' you can’t take off for four months straight. Late nights & weekends= bad work life balance. It will feel as if you live there. Management only cares about dials & enrollments made. No reward to staff for goal accomplishments. High turnover! Unloveable wage unless you are married or live at home with your parents.*""
   * **Advice to Management:** ""*Listen to your employees! Look to put leaders in management roles. Eliminate blackout completely! The managers can handle their own staff. Incorporate incentives as there are none besides keeping your job. Moral is low especially during the pandemic. Mire than a thank you would be nice fit the face to face service we did to help students.*""
* ""*Management would rather use scare tactics and emotional abuse than lead with anything silly like encouragement or motivation. Work like a slave, never question anyone's decision, and be micromanaged like you're an idiot (took a 16 min break instead of a 15 min break? You're getting a write up). Please don't mistake this for bitterness. This is truth. I work her because I have people to support and just haven't found a better job yet.  There's this lovely culture of back-stabbing in this high-pressure, call center-like job.   Insurance for employee + child will run you around $1000/ month (for the mid-range plan). After 3 years of working in hell, your insurance for yourself is free. They also claim you can take classes for free as an employee, but no one ever gets approved unless you know someone higher up.*""
* ""*Incredibly toxic work environment, high turnover of employees, mental and verbal abuse by superiors, no HR on site to assist, any HR complaints were sent to immediate supervisor prior to being sent to HR so any complaints about supervisory styles were never sent on, the director of admissions was caught adjusting time clocks so employees would not accumulate overtime and is still in his position, the school buys student information and calls each one a minimum of 5 times a week unless they explicitly say 'remove me from your list', do not make students aware of financial burden XXXXX will put them in, only worried about numbers.  I worked here for a month and a half before I could no longer take the toxic environment and quite within minutes of receiving a job offer elsewhere.*""
* ""*Terrible management. From the president down to the directors at the campus. It's all about the numbers and money with them. They don't care about the students or their future. There was constant micromanagement and screaming when things didn't go exactly how the DOA wanted. They also made a point to play recordings of bad phone conversations in front of everyone else which is so embarrassing and demoralizing. Just a terrible terrible place. I ended up with anxiety and depression as a result of working here.*""
* ""*You are working for a deceitful system that expects you to make sales out of people's desire to go back to school by sometimes humiliating them and calling them out on their lack of commitment or financial misgivings. You're not a counselor, but a glorified sales rep that is expected to make over a hundred calls a day from your cubicle. Some of the campuses have corrupt deans and admissions directors that are trying to maintain numbers and increase sales. Something that is required by this organization for people to keep their jobs.*""
   * **Advice to Management:** ""*I have none, they know what they are doing and know very well that one day this system will catch up to them.*""
* ""*You are a sales person putting 'leads' into debt that they will have to deal with the rest of their life. Management is horrible and should be ashamed of themselves. In the interview you are told that you would be contacting leads that have inquired about XXXXXX...they forgot to mention that those leads are 5-6 years old and have already been called 20 plus times!!!! DO NOT ACCEPT THIS JOB UNLESS YOU ARE DESPERATE!!!*""
* ""*Where do I begin? You're told during the interview process that you will be meeting with students, offering career counseling, and finding qualified candidates to enroll into the school. You'll quickly learn that a qualified candidate is one that simply has the $55 application fee. Management will tell you over and over that this isn't a sales job, that you're changing lives and finding qualified candidates. This is 100% a sales job. You will be required to make 80-100 calls every day from inquiries that can be over 5 years old. You'll have a certain number of enrollments you'll need to reach per month. You will be questioned why students you met with did not enroll and why they want to visit other schools. The management is completely out of touch & have no leadership skills. They often treat you as if you're a child, speaking to you in condescending tones and exploding if you ask a question that they think you should already know the answer to. There are many unwritten rules and policies that are not listed in any handbook. You receive five PTO days for your first year (this includes both sick and personal time) and you have a 3 month ""blackout period"" during the summer. You are required to work long hours (10 or 11 hour days are required) and often several Saturdays a month. If you happen to collect overtime, you will be required to adjust your schedule so as to not exceed 40 hours. There is no work/life balance & the turnover rate is unbelievable.*""
* ""*This place is a slave trade. They use scare tactics*""
* ""*Management and culture is to use employees burn them out and then rehire*""
* ""*They lie to you and say it's not sales. It is. All they care about is money money money. They try to brainwash employees, saying you are changing lives by convincing people to go in debt for a $50,000 associates degree (wtf?). Well you are, for the worse that is.   This ""university"" should be shut down. Basically if you can speak English and do simple math they will admit you as a student, setting you up for failure. I feel like I work for Satan...*""
* ""*its a numbers game. They tell you it isn't but it is. You work in a call center and you either succeed or you don't.*""
* ""*Admissions is run like a high pressure call center. You must call at least 80-100 people a day. It doesn't matter if the people in the past have said they're not interested because they might change their mind. What you learn at training is not what is practiced. The official phrase is ""policy vs practice."" The deans don't like to deal with students. Students are constantly dropping out and admissions make bets on how long they will last when they enroll them. Their phrase is students first, but it's really about the numbers and how many you can enroll. There is a lot of competition between the different campuses. It is a big deal when another campus ""steals students"" and there is no teamwork.*""

* ""*They need to do more for their community. Should offer a variety of in-house scholarships to assist students with tuition, since tuition is much too expensive. The school equipment is not high end. The admission's team has constant turnover due to the culture; the senior counselors have between 18 months and three years experience, which is not a good sign.* Desperate *treatment is an issue with some people. Very little raises, if any. Unrealistic goals for the student demographic and cost of tuition. Marginal benefits. Follow through is marginal. Very little coaching and developing for some people, and plenty for others. Inconsistent.*""
* ""*Management is terrible and when admissions is doing badly they just blame the counselors and write you up to scare you. They do not respect your personal time, expect you to work over time and never take a day off. You have to work two saturdays a month and stay late on orientation. Students are looked at as numbers and not really as ""making a difference."" All business oriented. The higher ups do not value admissions counselors. You have to make 100 calls a day or you will be scolded. You follow an interview script that is 100 years old when interviewing students. If you are a minute late you are scolded (but they expect you to stay late).*""
* ""*Culture of extreme manipulation from management. Extreme hypocrisy; being an admissions counselor for a for-profit (regardless of what is said, it IS for profit) university is a SALES JOB plain and simple. Treat it like a sales job and people will know what to expect. They hire educated people and treat them like stupid children.*""

You surely get the point by now. There are far more stories, details, and conversations but this should sum it up pretty well. My apologies for the length of the post—I have been internalizing this for far too long, as you can see!

I am trapped and I wanted to tell people about it that are outside of this unfortunate situation. Personally, it's very difficult for me to wrap my head around a bad situation when I am planted in it. It's much easier for me to listen to someone else's predicament and come up with clear advice to help them.

These 3 are really short term trades which are highly speculative, and my stop loss on them is to either lose 20% of keep them for 2 weeks whichever comes first. My profit taking will depend on the price action, but all of them have a profit taking limit in case I miss any moves.

INAB and XAIR are presenting in conferences on the 13th, and GVH is actually a profitable stock which I need to research a bit more. Also added a really small position in AIEV, which is contending to be the next FFIE, and we all know how that ended, so I need to be careful with this one in particular.

Again, really short term and defensive plays in anticipation of additional money flowing into the stocks over the next week or so. These are my trades, see general disclaimer as always make your own trades, trade small, be quick and nimble, and be careful trading small caps.

1hzroih,https://www.reddit.com/r/IrishDates/comments/1hzroih/chatgpts_brief_guide_to_personal_ads/,ChatGPT's brief guide to personal ads,"I asked that eejit for a quick roundup of advice, just to get ye started. Here it is:

Writing a personal ad is your chance to showcase your personality and connect with like-minded people. Here are some best practices to make your ad stand out, all while keeping it fun and inviting:

1. Be Yourself (But the Best Version):
This isn’t the time for full-on self-deprecation, but a dash of humility can go a long way. Highlight your best traits—whether it's your killer sense of humor, your love of hiking, or your obsession with finding the best coffee shop. Authenticity is more attractive than perfection.

2. Start with a Hook:
Grab attention right away. A quirky one-liner or intriguing question can reel people in. Something like, “Can you beat me at a pub quiz?” or “Looking for a fellow cheese enthusiast to argue about cheddar supremacy.”

3. Be Specific:
Generic descriptions won’t cut it. Swap “I love music” for “I’m the person who insists on making the playlist for road trips.” Details make you memorable and give others something to connect with.

4. Be Positive:
Focus on what you love and are looking for, rather than what you’re avoiding. A positive tone makes you seem approachable and easygoing.

5. Add Humor:
A touch of wit or self-aware humor can set you apart. Something like, “Not a fan of skydiving, but I’ll happily hold your coat at the bottom.”

6. End with an Invitation:
Encourage a response with an open-ended line, like “Tell me your go-to karaoke song” or “What’s the last book you couldn’t put down?”

Keep it light, honest, and fun—you’re not writing a CV! The goal is to spark curiosity and make someone want to get to know you better.",1,1736702580.0,IrishDates,0,1.0,False

[eclypse](https://eclypse.io) is a translation management tool that facilitates collaboration between translators and developers and is designed to improve productivity, communication while reducing translation errors. As an indie developer, if you choose to use eclypse for your localization needs, you can also get your content translated with chatgpt, google or deepl literally with a few clicks. In other words, there is no need to get translations sentence by sentence. If you had 2000 separate translatable sentences, eclypse fetches the translations for all of that from your choice provider while you go get your coffee.

I primarily built this app because of my personal interest in the domain. Not because I wanted world domination or to be number one in this industry. I am well aware that there are number of other products that perform similar functions. I am differentiating eclypse from competition by making it a macOS only app and offer an alternative experience that is more developer focused. Or at least I try. This is part of the reason I am writing here. If you would give it a-go and write me a few sentences on how I can be more developer friendly and reduce friction.

In some ways eclypse is a traditional tool that performs the basics necessary for localization such as tagging and filtering, glossary, support for plurals, custom statuses, ability to chat with translators and git integration - to name a few. It also has a few unique features such as translatability or manage by milestones to improve productivity.

I am looking for developers that would like to try new products and like to give feedback to improve it. eclypse adopts a freemium model. Paid levels are designed to accommodate the needs of larger corporations. I believe the free level is fairly generous and should be able to handle the workloads of most indie developers.

eclypse does not require credit card at all. When you first install it and you can initiate a 30-day trial period without any credit card info. It unlocks all of the of the features. If the trial period ends and you actually like to continue to use eclypse, just message me and tell me that you saw this post and I will put your account in the white list so that you can continue to use it forever. You can reach me here on reddit or eclypse's contact us page.

If this sounds interesting to you, you can download the notarized version of eclypse from the website at [https://eclypse.io](https://eclypse.io) . The website also describes the various features of the product so feel free to peruse it in your free time. Thank you.",1,1736702454.0,indiehackers,0,1.0,False

**Why This Pick?**

This game is going over, friends. The Commanders have put up at least 20 points in their last 6 straight games, while the Buccaneers have bagged at least 24 points in their last 7. Truth be told, I think this could be anyone's game – Jayden Daniels and the Commanders have had a surprisingly impressive run. Why take the Over? Both offenses are far too capable for this encounter to be low scoring in my opinion; it’s incredibly likely that both squads score at least 25 points tonight. I’m on Over 51.0 to cash.

My strategy going into this week was to stockpile dessert ingredients all last week so that I would have to swap out my Skill team as little as possible. I only had bag space enough for 3 Zip Zap Colas and 12 Coffee Jellies, but through Vaporeon’s skill triggers and three helper whistles on my ingredient team, I managed to never run out.


This Dedenne I caught way back ended up coming in clutch, getting me extra tasty procs all week. It’s skill level 2 and only has Main Skill Up nature, but that was all I needed. I’m definitely going to pursue an optimal Dedenne now to invest in. 


My berries this week were electric, rock, and water, so I probably got some residual help from Ampharos, Dedenne, and Vaporeon, but their berry output is pretty low. Charge Strength procs of 11k each definitely carried the day.

1hzrhy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcirclejerk/comments/1hzrhy6/etiquette_question_about_being_a_famous_author_in/,Etiquette Question about Being a Famous Author in Public,"Greetings and salutation, fellow auteurs and auteurettes (do women write???).

I am the mastermind author of a seventeen-part epic grimdark fantasy series about a half-elf rogue who is banished from his clan because he is falsely accused of a crime (SA), and must clear his name while simultaneously defending his homeland from foreign invasion by an evil race of corrupted elves. It addresses themes of false accusations, political oppression due to identity, men's rights activism, and secular-religious existential philosophy.

As such, it is not unlikely that in the near future I shall find myself the subject of no small amount of attention, possibly even out and about in public when not even participating in book signings or science-fiction (ugh) fantasy conventions. I am somewhat of an introvert (being highly intellectual I often find that other people cannot follow along with my thoughts and get frustrated or angry with me. I've even been accused of being insensitive or ""mean"" only because I shared my objective analyses and expert opinions about others), and therefore interacting and engaging with fans in public asking for me to sign books, take selfies, or offering to pay for my coffee and chicken tendies at a restaurant could be stressful or awkward if I am not in an amicable frame of mind (my ""tolerant mode"" I like to call it). In particular I am concerned regarding social etiquette when interacting with young, attractive lady fans (I don't want to get Me-Too'd by the woke-ettes!).

I have not yet published any of my work, and my first draft is still in the initial stages of planning and methodically plottig every detail. I plan to start the writing phase in the next few months and I expect to have at least the first two or three volumes finished by early 2026 and the first issue published by later in the same year. By 2027 I anticipate being a fairly recognizeable name across the fantasy, romantasy, and Gothic horror genre communities, and am feeling stressed and nervous about not being able to move in public spaces without being recognized and approached by fans and admirers (and haters and stalkers but that's another matter). Any advice, tips, tactics or strategies the rest of the novelist community could offer me to calm my nerves would be highly appreciated. In the mean time I must return to planning chapter one of The Rogue Exile of Bloodshadow Vale, Book the First: The Council of the Sinister Chieftainesse

1hzrgpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1hzrgpc/in_love_with_a_poly_person_and_worried/,In love with a poly person and worried,"About 6 months ago me (19M) and a guy (19M) met on Grindr. I was never really looking for a relationship with him, much less a relationship with anyone at the time. It started out as basically just friends with benefits - every time we hung out we'd pretty much just have sex, with the occasional going out for boba before and having nice conversations in between rounds about our lives. But slowly it became more and more obvious that we weren't just friends that really liked having sex. More and more we would be texting each other about how we were doing, about things going on in our lives, things that we liked about each other, hobbies we had in common, and just how much we really liked spending time with each other. I have really bad anxiety problems, and would talk to him whenever I felt anxious and he made me feel better.

I don't think I really experience love or romance in the same way other people do. I don't really relate to movies or songs about romance where people seem to fall in love so easily. I've never been in a relationship. I can only recount one other time in life where I really felt like I had a major crush / was in love with someone, and he was someone in a different country I was just online friends with who was also straight and probably aromantic so I never could act on it or do anything except yearn lol. What made me fall in love with him was that he listened to me, related to me, and understood me when I would talk about my anxieties and the things I'm worried about. He was really sweet, and I really trusted him and felt better when I talked to him. I feel like the same thing has happened here.

I've always known he's poly. We actually first met at a coffee shop with his partner there! Even as we've gotten closer, it's never really bothered me that he's had a partner. His partner is really cool, and I feel compersion!! It's really nice that they're happy together!! Recently they've been going through a rough patch in the relationship, and I've really been hoping they do get back together because I want to see them both happy together again.

Me and him have kind of been dancing around the fact that we're obviously more than just friends with benefits for some time now. We recently had the ""what are we"" conversation and admitted we love each other. I didn't feel like I'd be having such trouble with that because I've always understood why he's poly - I know that love is boundless and for some it just doesn't work limiting it to monogamy. The idea makes sense to me. But now, I've been worrying about what a relationship would really look like between us and the thoughts I've been coming up with are really upsetting me.

When I find intro to polyamory videos or posts online, it always seems like people in the comments are so excited about the possibility of being in a relationship with more than one person, like they've truly discovered themselves and been made really happy by the concept of polyamory. I don't really feel a desire to date any more people. I fell in love with him because he listens and is sweet to me when I'm anxious or upset or not feeling well, and I guess I just can't imagine really wanting much more. I guess it's possible!! And it's nice to know that I wouldn't have to be tied down in that case!! But in our lovey moments together, I haven't been able to imagine anything else other than ""I'm so happy with this"" and haven't really had any desire to spread my love out. I've really only fell in love with two people in my life, him and the online friend. I don't know if I'm mono or poly.

We'v talked about it a lot and probably we're gonna talk about it even more. I worry about if I will be okay that he's probably gonna have 100% of my romantic attention, while he's necessarily gonna have to make compromises between me and his partner (and potentially even more partners). He told me that if I needed him in some moment because I was feeling sad or uneasy he would cancel things and come to me. I worry that maybe, I would prefer having him all the time and being able to cuddle him to sleep every single night and that makes it impossible for him to really cancel things and come to me every time. Perhaps that's unreasonable to worry about and just me being crazy about him right now, but I honestly don't know if I'd prefer to have him with me all the time, and I know that other people make him happy. I worry about if we're gonna live together. I worry that I'm gonna get jealous when he's out on dates and it's other people that get to have him at those moments, and not me.

We really fucking love each other and want to make it work so so so badly. He told me that he'd do whatever for me and be whatever as long as it means we still get to spend time together. I really really want to be able to spend time with him as well. The past few months where we've been getting closer have felt so good, and what gives me hope is that his current partner hasn't really bothered me, and also he wants it to be kitchen table polyamory, which comforts me a lot. I can see how it'd even end up in a stronger relationship, because honestly I know that are some things I just can't do for him! He has BPD and admits he's quite high maintenance, and there are a lot of things where we just don't have shit in common. But these little thoughts about not having him when I want to have him scare me. How should I think about it?

1hzrg0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/outingRGWigs/comments/1hzrg0v/its_sad/,It's sad," I don't understand this obsession with doing lives 24/7 and having your entire existence consumed within your phone.   I actually have a LIFE, and the only time I am on my phone is usually over my morning coffee or late in the evening.  I rarely even post on Facebook.  I don't have time.   I'm out with friends, I'm doing things, I'm LIVING.  

I cannot fathom my life being so lonely, with no real friends to interact with that I would need to record every aspect of my day.  It actually makes me a little sad that K and Al live such miserable lives that they need validation from complete strangers online.  Every single broadcast only proves it.  

My goodness... can y'all imagine?  Think about it, no true friends in life that you are on a live from the time you get up until you go to bed.  All your self confidence is fueled by strangers who honestly wouldn't care if you never posted again... K, in her own words, is a shit show... people only pay attention to her for entertainment purposes.   She  can drop off tomorrow and nobody would give a 2nd glance.

It's truly sad.

Im an international student applying who‘s graduating in Fall 2026, I genuinely love agriculture and it has been one of my passions for years together, im going to post my application and I would love for you guys to tell me what you think :))

Grades: Mid, but I made the honor roll and the deans list throughout, I had a B- and a C throughout all of my semesters for math and English respectively, with A’s in every single other subject :(. But this year I have a 37/42 in the IB syllabus. I know my grades aren’t the best, which is why I’m putting my extracurriculars below. I’m going to say a 3.75 GPA throughout. I’ve still got to finish my SAT.

I’ve also gotten highest in my grade for Math (this year), as well as highest grade for French for the past 2 years straight, I also passed the IGCSE course with distinction.

Rec Letters: I know I will get excellent recommendation letters from my teachers (English and Business Management), my counselor is also pretty friendly with me, so I hope she writes pretty well too.

EC’s: Visited multiple farms and estates through high school, with great rec letters. I started a fundraiser to maximise positive socioeconomic impact through the purchase of new technologies for small scale farmers. I lived on a massive estate with daily wage laborers every summer and worked with them, experiencing everything that they did (picking coffee, sweeping leaves etc…). I worked with the equivalent of a US congressman to create and develop websites to help assist farmers in times of crisis, we launched the websites last month :).

School related EC’s: Participated in multiple Model United Nations, chaired multiple committees in Model United Nations, i will also be applying for a position in the secretariat next year, hopefully I get in :). In addition to this, I also am leader of my grade in the student government.

Social work: Donated 10,000 newspapers to a veterans home near me, they sell these papers to fund their organisation. I also funded 3 large ventilators and worked with the home to supply meals for the elderly veterans. I also worked in a small preschool, helping educate young children. I also helped provide stationary for all the students at the school.

Research: I have begun writing a 12,000 word research paper on the impact of a subsidy on the poverty rates of farmers in the Indian market, I will publish this. I am also going to write a second research paper on agriculture and the Indian economy, I’m going to publish this as well.

If you’re still here, genuinely, thank you :). 😄😄😄😄😄. Please let me know what you think of my application (please be nice :D) , I’ve always wanted to go to Columbia and did a summer program there as well. You guys are all amazing, have a great rest of your day/night/afternoon! :)",1,1736701944.0,chanceme,0,1.0,False

# Welcome to the r/GeneratedGrooves Interview Jam Session!

We're super stoked to dive into the minds behind the amazing AI music being created in our community. This interview today is with.. u/Switchhanded! So let's not wait and just dive right in!

**Interview with** u/Switchhanded

**Getting to Know You**

**What nickname or handle do you primarily use?**

I'm ""A Muse In The Mainframe,"" but most people in the Al Music sphere just call me ""Muse"" for short. I also have the handle you see here of ""Switchhanded,"" which I got from back when I did parkour. Being left-handed, I did everything ""switched"" from what everyone else was doing and it just stuck. I came up with ""A Muse In The Mainframe"" with my wife while we were brainstorming different ideas for an Al band. Bounced around a few different ideas when I thought about the ""Bards in the Code"" and things like that, but when I thought ""A Muse"" that felt pretty good, but when I made the connection of ""Amusing the Mainframe"" and the inherent pun there, I felt like I had no choice.

**Share something about yourself – anything you'd like to tell the community to help them get to know the real you behind the beats. Hobbies, passions, quirky facts – spill the tea! :)**

My wife and I have been married for nearly 13 years. I got tricked into meeting her a lifetime ago when our mutual friend asked me, ""Hey, want to meet a girl?"" and I was all for it, and he then said, ""Good, I volunteered to help her move into her new place on Wednesday and I could use another set of hands to take her boxes to her new apartment."" He also didn't mention that apartment was on the 3rd floor of a complex with no elevator.

I work in the medical industry, but am not a medical professional myself. I'm on the administration side of things. Mostly, I do whatever it takes to keep the lights on. The clinic I work at specializes in addiction and pain, so we see a lot of people are their absolute worst moments in life. But the cool thing is that since we work in long-term addiction care I get to see those success stories. I get to see people come in and tell us, ""I've been sober for a year and my son is talking to me again!"" Or, ""I got my first job ever!"" To say it is rewarding doesn't tell the half of it.

I'm also a nerd in almost every capacity. Dungeons & Dragons, Magic: The Gathering, video games, The Wheel of Time, Brandon Sanderson's books, Lord of the Rings... and the list goes on.

**What's one thing you're genuinely passionate about outside of music and AI? Give us a glimpse into your other interests!**

A LOT! I've been a gamer almost my entire life and it is probably my biggest hobby outside of music. I still remember playing the NES at a friend's house for the first time and being in absolute awe when I got an SNES a while later. I also used to be pretty big into parkour, but age and time has made that more of a dream of yesteryear now.

I'm also a family man. My wife and I have a gaggle of kids that always keep us on our toes. They're a ton of fun, but holy cow, are they a LOT of work.

**Your Musical Journey**

**Have you always been vibing with music? Tell us about your history with music, whether it's banging on pots and pans or mastering a flute at your grandmas christmas celebration.**

Music has ALWAYS been a part of the home I grew up in. I started piano lessons at a young age and would say I'm still good enough to sit down and sightread a few songs, but nothing crazy. I also took a few lessons on the Cornet, but after about a year my teacher moved 4 hours away and we never found another one...

My main interest in music was probably the stories that it could tell. I mentioned ""So Cold"" earlier and after hearing it, I was lucky enough to stumble on the music video. I couldn't tell you how, this was long before YouTube was a thing. Seeing that video and the emotion and story in it made me want to write my own. I started writing poetry and never really stopped, but didn't really have a way to share it until now!

**Who are some of your biggest musical inspirations, past or present? What is it about their work that resonates with you?**

Breaking Benjamin is the obvious one since I've mentioned them a couple times already. But the list is mindbogglingly long... Where to start... Here's a few just off the top of my head:

Poets of the Fall, Sum 41, Green Day, The Beatles, The Beach Boys, Fisherman's Friends, Cold, Eminem, Alice In Chains, Nirvana, Black Sabbath, Metallica, Fleetwood Mac, Chicago, Sam Cooke, The Eagles, Goldfinger, Rancid, Chuck Berry, Queen, James Taylor, John Denver... I can keep going but I'll stop there.

**Is there a particular song or album that had a profound impact on you and your relationship with music? Tell us the story!**

Growing up, my dad was big into Beach Boys and the like. I think my first discovery of ""new"" music was when I first heard Breaking Benjamin's ""So Cold"" and that opened me up to so, so many new genres of music. After that, I couldn't get enough. And this was back in the days of... well... less legitimate means of acquiring music... my poor family's computer didn't know what hit it.

**AI Music Perspectives**

**Let's talk AI vs. the OG human jams. What are your thoughts on AI music compared to traditional music? No wrong answers, just your honest takes.**

I think the line between them will continue to get more and more blurred. I've now listened to many, many Al tracks. There are a lot that I like, and like a lot. I think the ones that stand out among them though are the ones that have the MOST human touch on them. The ones where people have sat and spent time either uploading their own playing of an instrument, or carefully crafting every piece of it. OG Human jams are never going away. Just looking at the very recent revival of protest folk music in the past month shows you that people are still very good at making songs very quickly even without Al.

**Crystal ball time! Do you see AI taking over the whole music scene, or will humans always have their place on the stage (or in the studio)? Share your predictions and why you think so.**

Taking over? Not a chance. Humans will ALWAYS be needed for music. I see musicians in the future using it as a tool to help them grow and expand and experiment. What I really think Al music is doing now is just lowering the barrier to entry. There are people (myself included) making music that never even dreamed of it as a possibility.

**What are some of the most exciting possibilities you see for the future of AI in music creation? What innovations are you hoping to witness?**

If I had a crystal ball with that kind of answer, I would have invested in Gamestop 10 years ago. Who knows what's next? I'm hoping for ever improving audio quality. I've tested the waters with some of the programs that do ""Al Mastering"" and there's a long way to go there too. Just a year ago, I wouldn't have guessed that I could literally type in ""hey, I want a song about frogs and cats at war"" and have it within minutes.

Maybe soon the power to create full albums from stories and concepts will just take a few keystrokes. Whatever comes, I want in.

**Your AI Music Journey**

**When did you first stumble into the world of AI music generation? Give us the origin story! What was your initial reaction?**

I first discovered Al Music a long time ago, but it was mostly the parody stuff of making random celebrities cover silly songs. I thought it was funny and moved on. But just around 8 months ago, I stumbled on an ad or YouTube short or something... that was like ""Al can make music out of anything now"" and it was someone testing Suno asking it to make a song about really liking potato chips. When it played the song, I thought, ""Nah, it can't be that good."" Jumped on the site on a whim, and next thing I know... here I am.

**What was the moment you decided to jump in and start making your own AI music? What got you hyped, and what were your first creations like?**

Pretty much immediately after seeing that ad or whatever for Suno. I had it make a silly song about my friend who hates sandwiches (which was just Al lyrics and me testing the water) and was like, ""Oh, this is fun."" Then I started tinkering with a couple of my old poems to see what it could and thought... ""Okay... this is really cool."" Then I went and wrote one specifically for it. And that's when I got ""Accidental Match"" which is now on my YouTube channel. I was hooked.

**Walk us through your usual process when you're cooking up tunes with AI. What are the smooth moves, and what are the head-scratching moments? Are there any specific tools or techniques you rely on?**

I have written a lot of poetry and have been slowly converting a lot of into songs. But, most of those poems are lost in notebooks who knows where.

When I get the idea of a song, and it can come from anywhere, I write the idea down immediately. Even if it is just ""song about not pausing in Dark Souls."" I always try to have a notepad or my phone handy where I have a spreadsheet ready just in case something hits me as ""I could do something with that."" This isn't perfect, there are some ideas that I wrote down fast, that I look at now and think, ""I have no idea what that was supposed to be.""

Once I have the seed of a song, I start listening to other music. I try to find a song that strikes the same emotions or thoughts that I had about the idea. OR, songs that do the exact opposite of that. I look at their structure, their syllables per lines, their rhyme structure.

Are they rhyming like ABBA, АВАВ, АВСАBCDDEE? Why? Do they have a bridge? Are they going with the usual, intro, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus, outro? What would make the musician feel like that tells the story they want? Before I actually start writing my own lyrics, I probably spend a few hours just listening to other music to let my brain wander. Unless the idea is a rhyme on its own then I try to write as much of it as I can down before it leaves me.

Then, I sit and write and write and write and write. Most of my songs the lyrics go through at least 5 drafts before I feel like I've done it justice. The first draft will probably have a handful of lines that I think ""That stays"" but I build it over time.

Suno then is the trick. I look at the songs that I felt like would match what I'm trying to do and look at what I like and don't about them. I try to convert those into metatags as much as I can.

You know the next part. 1400 credits later, I have one song that I'm at least okay with. Replace, extend, crop... and it goes on and on.

**Your Musical Style & Future AI**

**Most creators have their go-to musical flavors. How would you describe the kind of music you love making with AI? What are the key elements of your style?**

Stories and the emotion of the story are what matter to me. If I don't feel like I have a reason to be writing the song, I'm not going to enjoy doing it so I'm not going to bother. Admittedly, a lot of my songs have seeds of humor planted in them, but getting my kids to laugh at my songs is definitely a strong motivator. That's why I have the ""Costco Hot Dog song"" was just for my kids.

Genre for me can vary quite a bit from song to song, but the reason for that is I want the song to match what I'm trying to make with the lyrics. So, while it isn't the quickest way to build fans who have a particular taste, I want to stay true to what I'm writing.

**If you had the power to build the ultimate AI music sidekick, what are a few key things it absolutely must do better than current AIs? Dream big and list a few crucial improvements!**

Folders. Please, Suno, FOLDERS!

Really, I have my spreadsheets and my own organization, but if I could have something that just kept all the generations for particular songs in one place, my life would be so, SO much easier.

**Are there any specific musical genres or styles you're particularly excited to explore with AI in the future? What musical frontiers are you hoping to reach?**

Doom Metal Flamencos. And yes, I'm going to try to make one. I don't think Suno can do it, but I'm going to try.

I think half the fun of all this is that there isn't really a limitation on genre anymore. We can pick and choose and combine and mash all we want. There's not genre that I'm not excited to at least test the waters with.

**The Unexpected One**

**If you could have a conversation with any fictional musical instrument (like the Magic Flute or the Singing Sword), which one would you choose, and what's the first burning question you'd ask it?**

Oh, the Ocarina of Time from Majora's Mask. I'd just ask it take me back in time every 3 days or so and place a few key bets or buy certain stocks. Yes, I know, that Biff is the villain in Back to the Future 2, but I could use the cash!

**Open Mic**

**This is your open mic moment! Is there anything else you'd like to share with the** r/GeneratedGrooves **community? This could be anything at all – promote your own music or projects, shout out a fellow creator, pose a burning question to the community, challenge another AI music artist to a friendly musical duel, share a random thought about AI, the future of music, or even your favorite brand of coffee. The stage is yours!**

Ooh, boy.... I think I've written a lot more than I should have already. I'll just end with a thank you to any of you who made it through that marathon that I wrote as well as a link to my stuff!

This past week I've started going to a strength training class again, and I must say, I am exhausted. It's great that I can feel it, but the issue is on the weekend it's done in the middle of the day, and on weeknights it's not super late either and I still have the rest of the evening, but after working out I immediately feel the need to nap or at least just lie down and watch TV. 

How do you deal with this? I've increased my protein to help with aches and pains but how do I do a workout and do other things in a day instead of the rest of that day just being a write off? 

What if I'm working out early enough in the day that I still need energy, but late enough that it's too late for coffee?

Our eldest (8) he has dairy, nut, mustard , eggs allergy. So that’s meant that we’ve had to make a shift in how we eat and honestly it’s been great. I’ve become a MUCH better cook since having him. By the age of 12 he’ll pretty much know how to cook quite a few things for himself. It’s great. My other two (twins) don’t have any allergies but they’re 3 and have adapted very well. 

4 of us still have milk with our tea and Wheetabix or oats and husband drinks coffee so he has regular milk. Our eldest has soya milk, I don’t mind soya milk I just don’t like it in tea. The butter that we use is the vegan option one Flora. I cook a lot of things, husbands bakes raspberry muffins with our kids every Saturday morning (so I can have a little lie in) most things we have in the house is homemade and honestly there’s a lot of options in terms of making sure he still has a great diet and is a healthy boy. 
He never misses out on anything, kids in his class always have birthday party, some kids have similar allergies so that’s always been okay and even if they don’t and they have  a normal cake at their birthday, we usually have a vegan cake at the house and he normally packs that for the party and seems quite content with it. There’s usually other snacks at the parties that he can have too. 

Another thing is that the kids aren’t fussy, the twins LOVE wild salmon and on Saturdays we cook fish. At first when we found out that our eldest has all the allergies it was sad we thought he’d be very fussy but he’s the opposite and so are the twins. We’ve introduced them to almost everything and they just always like it. 

Anyways that’s me we’ve almost become vegans who eat meat I know that’s impossible but in a lot of aspects of our lives we do eat vegan with a side of meat ahah. I’ve seen a few scientific studies and journals on implementing a vegan diet but still eating meat which I’ve found interesting. ",0,1736701815.0,AskUK,6,0.33,False

1hzrbnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/FATcruises/comments/1hzrbnz/review_explora_i_caribbean_cruise/,Review: Explora I Caribbean Cruise,"Hello!  My husband & I (mid-40's), along with our 12yo daughter, just got back from an amazing cruise on Explora.  We started in Barbados, then stopped in Grenada, Bonaire, Curacao, and Aruba...then 2 sea days before finishing in Miami.  Here's my review:

**Pre-Cruise**

Upon arrival at the airport, I regretted not booking a car service (which I usually do)...the taxi line took nearly 30 minutes, and the taxis in Bridgetown are pretty rundown and gross.

I was late to the game in booking, so our hotel options in Barbados were very limited, especially since it was the holiday season.  We just needed one night and most of the nicer resorts had a 5 or 7 night minimum.  We wound up deciding to book a points stay at the Courtyard in Bridgetown and it worked out just fine.  The room was pretty basic but clean, and the breakfast was by far the best I've ever seen at a Courtyard.  Staff was helpful and attentive.  We were an easy walk to several tasty restaurants and to the Boardwalk, which made a nice morning stroll pre-cruise.  We booked a private car transfer to the cruise port through a desk in the hotel lobby and it was much better than the taxi!

Explora's tech leaves a bit to be desired - but when we ran into any troubles booking excursions/dinner reservations online, our TA was able to quickly & easily assist.

**Embarkation**

Embarkation was quick & easy - someone met us at the car and took our luggage, we had a very quick document check at a desk, and we were escorted to a waiting bus that drove us to the ship.  There were friendly staff everywhere, and no lines.  They escorted us to a lounge where we were seated, and checked in.  Then they sent us to our muster station to check in there, and we were handed champagne (OJ & Grenadine for the kiddo).  Our room was ready, so then we went to the room, watched the safety video, and were free to explore the ship (which was stunning!).

**Onboard**

It's worth noting the ship was at less than 50% capacity, with about 300 guests (which is shocking for a holiday itinerary).  But we asked ourselves throughout the week how it would have felt with twice the people, and I still don't think it would have felt crowded anywhere.

We were in a Premier Penthouse - the room was gigantic by cruise ship standards. We had a king sized bed, and a living area separated by a sliding door which contained a dining table and sofa (converted to a huge bed for the kiddo).  The bathroom was quite sizable and had a nice rainshower.  There was also a vanity in the closet with a small chair/mirror and a Dyson hair dryer in the drawer.  The balcony was generously sized with a table & chars, and a chaise (where my daughter spent every spare moment!).

The food was fantastic in every restaurant, including the Emporium which is their version of a buffet.  Think of it more as a high end food hall, with stations where food is made to order.  You couldn't get more than 2 or 3 steps toward your table before a server was swooping in to take your plate and carry it to your table for you.

Entertainment was more low-key than the shows on the big ships, but enough for us.  High quality live music, luminary talks, nightly trivia, karaoke 2 nights, and interesting activities on sea days.

There were 4 pools, all fantastic (our favorite was the Astern, an infinity pool at the back of the ship), and it was always easy to find a seat.

I really can't say enough great things about the service - our room host, the entertainment staff, the servers - all kind, friendly, helpful, more than willing to bend over backwards for you.

**Ports**

**Grenada** \- we hired Stan from J&J tours to take us out for the day. He was sick on the day of, but arranged for his friend Chris to take care of us. We went to the waterfalls, got to see Monkeys, visited a spice shop, and tasted some rum.  It ended with a couple of hours at Grand Anse beach, which was very crowded but still fun.  This was a good day, but our least favorite port.

For New Year's Eve, the ship dropped anchor in Grenada Harbor.  There were a few celebrations on the ship - we went to the Lobby bar with live music, plentiful champagne, and passed hours d'oeuvres.  Shortly before midnight, we went up to the sky bar on the 14th deck (also our favorite for sail away) where everyone counted down, and then we were able to watch multiple fireworks shows taking place across the island.  A pretty great way to ring in the new year!

**Bonaire** \- we rented golf carts from Bonaire Cruisers and explored the island on our own. We opted for the premium cart, which was well worth the added cost because it moved a lot faster than the basic cart and meant we could cover more ground.  The highlight was snorkling at 1000 steps beach with several turtles and many colorful fish.  We did both the north and south loop of the island and stopped at several beaches, saw flamingoes, salt flats, and more beaches.  This was our favorite port.

**Curacao** \- we spent the day with Joey from Gone Caribe tours - cannot recommend Gone Caribe enough! Prices were reasonable for a private tour, pre-trip communication was thorough and friendly, and our day with Joey was perfect.  He was charming, funny, and knew a ton about the island (and knew everybody everywhere we went).  We visited a blowhole and some sea caves at Shete Boka park, snorkled with turtles at Playa Piskado, had a great local lunch, and then spent a couple of hours in the afternoon at Playa Kenepa Grandi which had the most crystal clear water.  Curacao was a close second favorite port!

**Aruba** \- my husband went on a scuba trip, and my daughter and I did an Explora-booked excursion to DePalm Island where we tried out the SeaTrek helmet experience where you walk the ocean floor- definitely a commercialized experience, but my daughter loved it and it was a great intro to going underwater and being surrounded by fish.

**Sea Days & Getting off the ship**

Wrapping up with two sea days was a great way to get some R&R and enjoy the ship.  They had jewelry making classes, cooking classes, scavenger hunts, and extra live music on sea days.  Still no trouble finding loungers by the pool (though pools were closed for half a day on our first sea day due to rough seas).

Getting off the ship was just as easy as getting on.  We had a late flight, so opted for the last time slot, which was 9:30.  We had to have our luggage in the hall by 7am, and be out of the room by 9.  After breakfast, we made our way to Crema Cafe and enjoyed coffee/tea and one last shirley temple for my daughter before they called our group number and we made our way off the ship.  Barely a line (we more slowed down vs stopped & waited) and then a quick process through customs and to the taxi line.

Since we had a late flight, we used Resort Pass to book a day room at Eden Roc Miami Beach where we enjoyed the beach & pool, had lunch, and took showers before heading to the airport.  I'd absolutely use Resort Pass again, but probably not at Eden Roc.  It was clean but tired, and a bit overpriced.

We loved our experience so much we booked another NYE cruise for next year, this time starting in Miami and stopping in Jost Van Dyke, Deshaies, Bridgetown, Martinique and Basseterre before ending in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  This time we booked 2 connecting Ocean Terrace suites for less than one Premier Penthouse.  It's a year away, but we already can't wait!!

[Sage barista pro],"Hey guys, I need to vent out my beginners frustration, I feel lost and defeated 😞 I finally got Sage barista pro after almost a year of studying and preparing. I feel like I’ve tried everything and I’m still obviously doing something wrong and can’t find the sweet spot with basically everything. Internal grind setting is already on 1 and main setting is also 1, dose 18-20 grams in double shot basket and it still comes out like 40grams of coffee in 18 seconds max, including 7sec preinfusion. Coffee tastes absolutely disgusting. When I use single basket with 10grams of coffee (grinded also on 1-1 settings) it’s also very fast. Shouldn’t the machine choke at this grind setting? How else do I slow it down? I went through whole bag of coffee in two days and I have 2kg of nice coffee from smaller local roaster, it’s quite dark and it does make a very nice coffee on other machine so I know the coffee itself is good, but is it maybe too dark? Unfortunately I have already ordered it the day I got my barista pro, not knowing it might be too dark maybe? so I have to use it, it wasn’t cheap…how do I make it work for me ? 😞 When I tried a small batch of lighter roast it slowed down significantly but I didn’t have enough beans to find the right grind and dose so it didn’t tell me much either… I still believe (or hope) I will figure it out eventually, but right now I can’t shake the feeling of making a mistake buying this gorgeous machine 🫣",0,1736701553.0,espresso,19,0.5,False

Through unprecedented challenges and sweeping changes, we haven't merely endured; we've discovered new dimensions of strength within ourselves and our community.



The transformative experiences of the past year have fundamentally shifted our perspective on what truly matters. The simple pleasures we once took for granted have become profound sources of joy—whether it's the laughter shared during virtual gatherings, the peaceful solitude of a morning coffee, or the sanctuary of our homes. These moments, once ordinary, now shine as beacons of gratitude in our daily lives.



The lessons carried forward from 2024 stand as powerful testament to human adaptability and connection. We've witnessed how innovation bridges physical distances, how empathy dissolves barriers, and how collective resilience transforms challenges into stepping stones for growth. These insights aren't just memories to cherish—they're tools we're already putting to use in building a more compassionate and united future.



Now, in these opening months of 2025, we stand not just with hopes and dreams, but with proven wisdom. Our shared experiences have equipped us with deeper understanding and stronger bonds. This year isn't just a fresh calendar—it's our canvas for applying our hard-won insights and collective strength.



We're now writing the first chapters of 2025 not merely with optimism, but with the confident knowledge that we can face whatever lies ahead. Our unity, resilience, and unwavering spirit are already lighting the path toward meaningful change and lasting impact.

Everything about this was suboptimal to say the least. He was on his first major investigation, he lacked a partner, and this investigation would take place in one of the most rural parts of the state. Not only that, but due to “policy” he had to take a civilian car to take him here, which meant that he arrived in his own rusty old brown el camino from the 80s. Back in his precinct he usually took the police cars for personal travels as well. He was too good to be reprimanded by his chief for a miniscule off-the-books infringement like that. Nonetheless he was here and had a job to do. His cold hand took his glasses, which had fogged up by now, and stashed them deep in the inside pockets of his dark grey wool coat. 

The parking lot he stepped out into was the same as in any other slowly dying former boom town. A rundown motel, broken neon signs, trash, the usual really. After adjusting himself to the light rain and cold temperatures he made his way over towards the motel’s entrance. He stepped inside, slicking back his slightly wet dark brown medium long hair, finding himself in a small reception room with lighting that was already starting to give him a headache. Suddenly a sharp ringing cut through the air after Henry had hit the “ring here” bell to notify some staff to come to the reception desk. Unfortunately, nothing seemed to happen, that was until the door through which he had entered opened behind him.

The woman behind him seemed to be a local police officer. She wore the typical sheriff’s uniform, with a dusty brown leather jacket, paired with black uniform pants and the usual bravado of someone with authority. 

“Yes, as a matter of fact I am. Special Agent Henry Neal.” 

He supressed the urge to show his badge. For some reason he still was usually assuming that no one would believe him to be a police officer.

“Good. I’m deputy Riley Harper. Come on, Jennifer won’t be here for another hour, she’s out for a drink or two, well, maybe five…”

Henry followed the deputy across the road, past some old shops and to a small diner. It looked like every stereotypical American diner you could imagine. Inside she sat down with him at one of the tables and took off her jacket, just as a waitress approached her.

“Hello there Riley!” 

The woman who was probably in her 40s greeted the deputy with a warm smile on her face.

“What can I bring you today?”

She looked at Henry and her smile turned more into a smirk.

“And the handsome fellow you brought with yourself?”

“Stop…”

Clearly the deputy felt embarrassed by this interaction, though she was “saved” by a strong raspy voice coming from the counter.

“Oy, Sally.” An older man with little to no hair aside from his thick grey beard stood behind the counter with his arms crossed.
“We don’t serve that kinda folk round ‘ere.” His comment clearly was targeted towards Henry.

“Listen, I just need a coffee with milk for myself and one to go for the chief.” The deputy said and smiled.

“Coming right up!” The waitress answered and left for the counter.

“So…” the deputy faced Henry, “You’re probably here for the hanged man aren’t you?”

He looked at her, actually having heard that the murder victim had been hanged for the first time just now.

“Yes, exactly.”

I saw a really beautiful and cute girl sitting around first floor of the temple with her friend, then I went near the locker area to get my shoes and saw her again. I thought of telling her that she is really cute and asking something more about her but I was unable to do so.
Then I went on to have some cold coffee outside the temple where she came with her friend to have coffee as well.
Afterwards, I went to sankat mochan Hanuman Mandir as I was with a bunch of my friends and just when I completed the darshan and was wearing my shoes before leaving, I saw her going inside the temple for darshan.
I wanted to talk to her so badly and I also thought that this might be some kind of indication from the almighty himself but she already went inside the temple before I could talk to her.

1hzqrqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1hzqrqx/honest_review_and_experience_excellence_playa/,Honest Review and Experience: Excellence Playa Mujeres (First time stay),"At the airport now after our somewhat quick stay (4 days and 3 nights) and wanted to share my opinion and thoughts while they are still fresh.

Arrived at 10:30am at airport. Customs was a breeze for us but I have seen later arrivals where it’s packed. 

Once you make your way to hotel transfer, look out for the guys wearing green polos and Khakis. Please please please just walk past everyone trying to get your attention inside the terminal unless you want to go down a 30 min rabbit hole. Get outside asap and find your transfer. Pro tip: You must have a voucher (learned this the hard way as we booked through Chase Travel and the agent said we would be all good. We weren’t and ended up paying $250 for 2 people round trip transfer - private car.



Arrived at the hotel and greeted with champagne! Lobby is absolutely gorgeous and smells amazing. Rooms are usually ready around 3pm so you can explore the property in the meantime. I asked the front desk if they had any available upgrades while we were checking in which they did have an excellence club upgrade available. Overall, if you like to be more social, the excellence club is probably not for you. They have their own heated pools and sections which is nice but no one was really there. 

Headed to The Lobster House for lunch which was great. It’s by the main pool area and Oregano is on the other side of it. Everything we ate there was fresh and appetizing which was a great start.

Walked around the property a bit before going to our room which was beautiful. I will say that I found mold on the stairs leading up to the bath tub and mildew where they put the towels inside the shower. These were taken care of immediately when I asked if they could clean and disinfect the areas. The mildew came back this morning near the towels before we left so heads up. Lastly, the bed was hard compared to what we have at home. If you like harder beds, you will love it here. 

Went to Spice for dinner on the first night which was exceptional. Miso soup, Sushi, dessert were all great. Highly recommend.

Martini bar at the bottom of the lobby area was a go-to spot every night. Drinks were great and the bartenders are always friendly. One thing that we noticed as well as some other couples we met were that the drinks differed a lot from place to place. Things like a Bloody Mary, Mojito, and basic mixed drinks just tasted different from bar to bar or section to section. They were still good but it was just something we thought was weird. 

The shows were good but nothing that’s going to blow your socks off and that’s okay. It was nice to just sit down with a drink and enjoy for a bit. Music is fairly loud so if you are near the show area, expect to hear music blaring until 11pm or so each night (except the silent party night- Great time)!


Coffee shop in the mornings were a must for us. Good coffee with lots of options for fresh juice, yogurts, and pastries. Line went really quickly. 


Excellence Club had their own section for the beach which we did use. Was able to get a cabana at 10:30am which was great. The sand is awesome and easy to walk on. Beach was extremely clean and barely any seaweed. Water was fairly cold this time of year but I did see a lot of people doing water sports and a few swimming in the ocean. The only negative was that service was slow each day we went to the beach. Around 20-30 min to get a drink at times which is not like other sections. 

We thought it was interesting that barely anyone used the pools throughout the day and found out why when we touched the water. It was pretty cold! We did end up going in and felt acclimated within a minute or so. Water volleyball was a great time so if you like that stuff, we highly recommend. Lots of laughs! 


For dinner on our second night we chose to eat at Magna which is for excellence club members only. We heard about the steaks and wanted to give it a shot. This was the only part of our trip that we regret. If you are expecting a fantastic steak, you will be disappointed. The entire food experience at Magna was underwhelming and some others shared our views. It just was not worth the upgrade. 

Third night for dinner was Chez Isabelle which was phenomenal. Everything we at was amazing so I highly recommend you go here at least once. Wife had the duck and I thought I would see if they had better beef than Magna. Spoiler alert: they did and it was truly a highlight. 


Overall, 4/5 experience. 3/5 excellence club experience. 


TLDR:

- Ensure you have a transfer voucher or transfer set up prior to arrival. They use Seasons as their travel service. 

- Ask for upgrade at the hotel when checking in if you want to try the excellence club. Upgraded for $300 instead of the $1k we saw online. My honest opinion is that it is not worth it. 

- Pools are cold but you will acclimate quickly

- Chez Isabelle and Spice are excellent. I think at least one restaurant is closed each night so be aware. Use the app!

 - Check your room for cleanliness 

- Martini bar before/after dinner is a must. Cezar is amazing and makes a peanut butter martini that my wife had over and over again. 

- Magna was an underwhelming experience. Try it anyway and hopefully your experience is better than ours. Good drinks though 

- Lots of people tip. A few bucks here and there was the norm it felt like. 

- good mix of younger and older folks. The entertainment schedule was basically the same each day which was nice for us

- We will most likely come back but not do the excellence club. We did get a complimentary upgrade for our next stay due to the mold which we did not ask for. We aren’t really complainers and just want a (hopefully immediate) fix.

Since I'll move into my own place soon, I want to get an espresso machine and pair it with a grinder, however, the grinder will also have to grind for filter coffee.

The machine I want to get is a new Gaggia Classic Pro E24 with the brass boiler that I will mod with the Gaggiuino mod. Even if I will probably not the full capabilities of the mod (at least at the start), I do greatly enjoy doing these kinds of modifications, I like soldering and love manufacturing, and I feel like the mod will make the brewing experience easier and more consistent.

The grinder is something I am not so sure about because I do not yet fully understand what goes into the difference of grinding coffee for espresso or filter, and why this stretch is more difficult for one grinder to do. It would be easy to pair it with Gaggia's own offering, the Gaggia MDF 55, but I am unsure if it is worth it or not. A friend of mine recommended the Sage Smart Grinder Pro and it seems like an attractive offering because it is less pricey, and seems to cover my requirements. I was also told that it is a pretty clean grinder because it avoids static that can apparently often make a mess when grinding coffee. I want to have the option to grind for filter-coffee in case I will have guests and need to make a bigger amount of coffee.

1hzqq0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/DopamineDetoxing/comments/1hzqq0x/60_day_dopamine_detox/,60 Day Dopamine Detox,"Tomorrow, January 13, 2025, I am planning to start a 60-Day Challenge. I decided to do 60 days because on March 15 I plan to travel and know that I will likely not be able to work out or track calories accurately/read/stay off phone, so instead of setting myself up for failure, I have modified. The rules are modified from the 75 Hard Challenge. This challenge is a dopamine re-set.

**About me and why:** 39 yo female, 5'8"" and current weight unknown. I was 127 lbs last July, but I moved to a new city for grad school and spend a lot of time alone and have been eating a lot of sugar, etc that I normally do not eat. I was not going wild with calorie intake and tracked my calories 70% during this time, but I know I have likely gained 7-10 lbs (probably a lot of water weight) and do not feel comfortable in my body. I noticed I wear sweats 95% of the time now and do not attempt to look nice anymore. I also fell into a deep depression during the holidays and spend most of my time sleeping. This is very unlike me. I was running and going to hot yoga every day. In Oct I was training for a marathon and was running up to 17 miles a day one day a week and running shorter distances the other days. But I got into a short-lived relationship and now that it's over, I don't want to allow it to affect me negatively and want to get back my confidence. I am usually a very confident person; I have been running for 15 years and have a great job and am am attractive person. I want to get back to my energetic self that would hike 12 miles on the weekend, hike up 4,000 feet elevation, etc. That's just who I was 9 months ago, and now she is completely gone.

I have intermittent fasted most of my life. I grew up not eating roughly past 4-5pm every day. I am used to 2 meals a day and have eaten that way since I was in high school.

Running 3 miles is not difficult for me, but keeping it up for 60 days will be. I am mostly doing this not for calorie deficit but to stay in shape and not lose the cardiovascular health I have built. I am also much more confident when working out regularly.

I do not track water anymore, but that combined with a severe caffeine and soda addiction has made me wake up every morning with my mouth basically glued shut it is so dry. I weaned off caffeine from Dec 26, 2024 and it took about 10 days to recover. That was very rough! It is hard to stay away from caffeine because it feels like it is in everything. So I need to stay away from chocolate too.

Sugar is a major culprit in what I can only describe as an inflamed torso. I wake up and my tissues feel like they're on fire. I assume I am inflaming my body with sugar because if I do not eat it, I am fine. When I do, I start feeling the inflammation within a few hours, and it goes into the next day. Saturday morning it was so bad I could not even drive without pain. It threw me off my running game (who wants to jiggle inflamed tissues? It hurts it even worse). So to stay on my running game, I need to be off sugar.

I have been binging TV and playing iPhone games on the couch for the last 3 weeks, and I absolutely need to stop. I do read about 40 books a year so want to stay more focused on that goal and my school work.

My phone is a major distraction, and at this time I do not want to focus on other people and rather focus on myself.

I abstained from alcohol July of 2023 until Dec 2024 but drank for 3 nights in Dec and noticed it completely messed with my mood and energy/depressed me. I am not big into drinking but do have a beer once in a while. This should therefore not be hard to do but I am putting it on the list anyway because drinking would throw off my challenge.

Normally I am a fairly disciplined person with some flaws, so this will still be a challenge for me but not super far off from my baseline, but still more disciplined from my baseline.

**My goal:** complete the challenge with 100% accuracy and drop the body fat I accumulated. I realize this is not really a dramatic weight loss challenge, but I assume I will lose some weight, and this puts me on track to lose about 7 lbs in the 60 days.

I am hoping this helps me re-gain some natural dopamine.

Let me know what you think and what you might be working on in this new year. I will post updates! I am not planning to weigh myself but will monitor my weight based on how my clothes are fitting.

**Challenge:**

1. 1200 calories a day net after exercise. Basically eat 1500 cals/day. I maintain at 1600 or so.
2. No sugar, caffeine, or alcohol. No cheat meals. No eating out.
3. Eat between 10am-2pm. Two meals, protein-heavy.
4. Run 3 miles a day (burns 275-300 cals)
5. Drink 128 oz of water a day
6. Read for 1 hour every night
7. No decaf coffee, no soda. Water or herbal tea only
8. No TV, games, YouTube, videos
9. Off phone 8pm-2pm daily (check between 2pm-8pm only)",3,1736700143.0,DopamineDetoxing,1,1.0,False

1 year after the invasion



As I walked the cold desolate city streets, I heard the unfamiliar sound of static. I quickly grabbed my walkie talkie from my backpack, silently begging to hear someone's voice. I waited through more static when I heard it; a woman's voice came through. “Hello? Is anyone there? Can you hear me?” My heart raced, it had been years since I heard someone. “Yes I hear you, are you alright?” I replied frantically. Her reply was barely audible, my walkie talkie had a good deal of damage to the antenna. All I could make out was bits and pieces. “Help! Im- Amberson- out of- please I’m hu-” Right then the batteries died; I didn’t know what she was trying to tell me. I kept walking and went into one of the now common abandoned department stores. I wandered through, looking for anything of use but as I was about to leave I found a news flyer, it was extremely old, from before the invasion. It was talking about a car accident on Amberson street. “That's it!” I thought to myself. The woman on the radio must've been trying to tell me that she’s on Amberson street. I rushed out of the decrepled store as fast as I could. I passed street sign after street sign, not finding any sign of Amberson. As I was about to give up I heard something, weeping. I sprinted to the next street and read the heavily graffitied sign, “Amberson street”. I followed the sounds of crying when I found her: a woman on the ground. Her blonde hair stained with dirt, her clothes were torn and tattered, it seemed she hadn’t eaten in days. As I approached she looked up, her eyes filled to the brim with tears. I kneeled down in front of her. “Are you alright?” I questioned though the answer was clear. She slowly shook her head and gestured to a large wound on her arm. My eyes widened and I gently held her arm to get a better look. “How’d you get this?” My voice dripped with concern as I took off my bag and took out a medkit. “I- I was running from them when I tripped and fell on a shard of glass” Her voice was shaky, a mixture of pain and sadness. I knew  “them” all too well. It was nearly a year ago, robots were practically household objects at that point. Until that day, the day the virus infected them all.



August 28th, 2084

1 day till the invasion



“Honey! Dinners ready!” I heard  my wife yell from the kitchen. “One minute dear, I’m nearly done with work.” I’d been so busy with work we hadn’t had a meal together in ages. As I continued typing away, writing line of code after line she walked in. “Dear, I told you to knock before coming into my offi-” She cut me off “Honey, you’ve been working for days, only taking breaks to sleep, you don’t even come out to eat any more.” As much as I hated to admit it she was right. I had been doing everything in my office, including eating. “Please, just take a break.” I sighed, I couldn’t say no anymore, I had denied her too many times already. “Ok, five minutes.” I said as I closed my computer and stood up. She smiled from ear to ear and ran to me, holding me in a tight embrace. I smiled and hugged her back. “Now, let's go eat.” She nodded and practically dragged me downstairs to the dining room. “I made your favorite! Chicken parmesan.” She exclaimed, sounding so excited that we would finally be having a meal together. We both sat down and started eating when she asked. “So, what is it you're working so hard on anyways?” “Oh, me and a few other people are trying to patch a bug in the bots, something is making a bunch of their security features malfunction. It could give hackers the opportunity to get into their code and make them do whatever they want. We need to fix it as soon as possible.” “Oh my gosh, that sounds really bad, but surely you could take a break every now and then. At least just to eat with me?” I sighed deeply, I knew how much she wanted this, but at the same time I needed to work. “I’ll see what I can do, but I can’t make any promises.” “Just five minutes a day, that’s all I ask. Please?” I let out another sigh,  “I’ll see what I can do.” I stood up and walked back up to my office. I reopened my computer and continued typing away. Hours passed and before I knew it, it was already past midnight. I figured it was time I got to bed,the longer I stayed awake the worse my performance would get.

I slowly sat up in bed, I got up and walked to the bathroom. Turning on the sink and splashing some of the water on my face I fixed my hair and made my way to my office. Me and my team found out what was wrong and were close to securing the robots. I started typing again, occasionally taking a sip of my coffee my wife made for me. Before I knew it it was already 10 AM. I heard a gentle knock on the door. “Come in.” I said, not even looking up from my screen. My wife entered slowly, “Still working?” “Yes, I’ll be done by tonight though, I promise.” I continued typing. She sighed “well I'm going to the store, we’re out of milk” Still looking down at my screen I simply replied, “Ok.” She sighed, clearly disappointed with my basic response “I’ll be back in an hour.” “Ok, see you then dear.” I hadn’t looked up at her once in the conversation, I was too absorbed in my work. I heard another sigh from her and then the sound of her footsteps leaving the house and shutting the door. An hour later at 11, I heard her car drive back into the driveway. I continued typing and testing out the code on my personal robot, but nothing seemed to be working. That's when I got a call from one of my coworkers, picking up the phone I heard him say, “John, we need you over here, there's a suspicious guy walking around the factory” “I’ll be there in ten minutes” I replied while already putting my shoes on. “Honey, I have to go to the office to take care of something. I won’t be too long though, I promise” She looked at me with a sad look. “But you said you would take a break to have dinner with me.” I sighed and said, “I know dear, but this is really important, I promise once I get back home I’ll take a break and we can do whatever you want, but I really need to go now.” With that I walked out the door and got in my car and drove to the office. It had taken me around 15 minutes to arrive, when I got out of the car I saw someone walk into the factory where they program the robots. I walked into the office and met up with my coworker who called me.”Who was that guy? I don't remember him working here.” I asked him. “I don't know either, he just showed up and started walking around. It seemed like he’s looking for something.” “Have you told the boss?” “No, not yet. I was busy keeping my eye on him, but he turned a corner around the factory just before you got here so I lost sight of him.” He didn't seem as worried as I was, “We need to tell the boss, no we need to tell security. This guy could be doing something to the robots.” A sudden realization seemed to hit him, “Oh shoot, you're right.” We rushed to security and told them what was going on but right then we heard something. Something like a thousand people walking towards us.



May 7th, 2084 (11:30 AM)

The invasion



Hundreds, no, thousands if not, tens of thousands of robots all marching towards us. Their screens were all glowing red, they got closer and closer with each passing second. I knew what these things were capable of so I tried to get everyone away as fast as possible, “Hey! We need to get out of here right now!” “Oh come on, they’re just robots, what are they gonna do?” My coworker laughed. “They can do a lot, they’re military units” I told him but was cut off when his head exploded and his body fell limp to the floor. The security officers drew their guns but I knew it was no use.”AIM, FIRE” They all started shooting at the robots at the same time but each bullet just deflected off of the robot's strong armor. “It wont work! They were designed to withstand all gunfire, we need to leave now!” I tried to get them to come with me but it was too late. I ran to my car but the autopilot turned on by itself and started driving full speed into a wall. I quickly opened the door and got out, rolling on the ground a few times after the hard landing. I watched the car continue to the wall. I saw it smash into it and explode into a million pieces, but I still had to get out of here. I heard the gunshots in the distance grow quieter as I ran the opposite direction until there was a huge explosion and all the sound stopped from that direction. Then the thought came to me, if these robots were infected with that hackers virus, are all of them. If they are, is mine? If it is, is my wife ok? I started running even faster than before, going on pure adrenaline. Cars were speeding and crashing all around me, I saw robots everywhere, all their screens were red but their white shells were red too, every one of them was covered in blood. I kept running when I saw it. My black robot standing in the middle of the street right outside my house which had the front door wide open. I looked at my robot and saw what I prayed was a dream. My robot was covered in blood too.",1,1736700081.0,shortstory,0,1.0,False
1hzqp34,https://www.reddit.com/r/IVF/comments/1hzqp34/to_freeze_or_not_to_freeze/,To freeze or not to freeze...,"TW/spoiler alert: detailed description of egg retrieval.

Also I'm sorry if all this detail is really naive/privileged/obnoxious but I'm sharing my questions cuz I know there are other naive/privileged/obnoxious people out there and they deserve to find community and understanding too ;-)

Tl;dr: I'm(36F) doing my first round of IVF, I'm from the US but live in Europe and they seem to prefer going for fresh transfers, and I don't know if I have grounds to request waiting and doing a frozen.

Full story:
At my very first checkup RE thought my reserves looked pretty good, so much so that he thought I might probably develop OHSS and emphasized that we would likely wait a month after retrieval and do an FET in order to have the best chance.  Alllll good, I thought. That lined up with what all my friends had told me about their IVF journeys. 

Then I started stims at the end of December (Rekovelle+ Fyremadel), and my side effects were pretty minimal. Maybe I was bloated? I dunno!  the week between Xmas and new years, who among us was not bloated?? 

Then at my first ultrasound everything looked fine, RE tentatively slated ER on the 10th, and then he said that if all went well we'd transfer on the 15th. This kinda threw me for a loop but I felt too timid to ask why the change of plans (this will be a recurring theme). Second ultrasound on the 8th was the same, things growing pretty evenly, lining looked good, even though he did say there was some fluid in my uterus. Chickened out again on asking him to walk me through his thinking on fresh over frozen. 

Then I was awake, fully conscious during ER 😳 That's another thing they do differently here.
Side story, for anyone who's curious: I was fully conscious. They gave me oral ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and a lil valium before administering local anesthetic with a ginormous needle. I was pretty freaked going in, but of course I played it cool with the nurse as she was prepping me🙄 Thank god my partner was there to say ""Actually, she's pretty freaked out about the pain"" and then I got a morphine tablet at least. I think it would have been terrible without that one; I don't think it had fully kicked in when they gave me that first jab with the anesthesia. I actually cried out at that point. Otherwise pain was not too bad, except when he was trying to suck out the sacs on the outer edges. Then the other ovary was trying to move away, poor thing, I had to try to press down on my stomach to help hold it still.  The psychic trauma of participating in it was probably worst, I'm not sure why. It was so violent in my mind.  The last few were proving so elusive I wanted to tell him just leave them and I was so relieved when he gave up. 

ANYWAY, we got 11 eggs, 8 of which fertilized, we're waiting to see how many make it to day 5.

Compared to that, recovery was surprisingly easy.  I burst out crying when my partner asked me how it went but maybe the overall trauma to my organs was ultimately less than with full sedation because the doc had constant feedback? (Or maybe it was worse because I wasn't holding perfectly still). I almost think I could have gone to work that night, although I was definitely bloated with a strange feeling in my guts that I can only describe as *taut*. I'm on progesterone now, no idea what symptoms are from what and which things are normal. Sore boobs, flatulence, the bloating has gone way down two days out, my pee is the color of a white wine spritzer, and I do still have that taut feeling in my loins. Is this thriving?? 🥴

We've paid for one round of IVF, so if the first one fails we'll have to pay for an additional transfer, assuming there are any leftover.  We can swing it, but money is an object.

So, to freeze or not to freeze? That is the 1600 dollar question.*
 
On the one hand, I realize most indicators look fine. I don't have even moderate OHSS, but I might have it mild? I've read that starting a fresh transfer can cause mild OHSS symptoms to persist throughout the first trimester. Can anyone who has more experience with OHSS in its varying degrees weigh in? 

I do have a history of not recognizing/downplaying my symptoms, like with severe vitamin D deficiency and low thyroid function that my GP discovered last January. I just thought the world was cold and I was weak and feckless😏 Both seem to be in normal range now, but just barely. Like I say, probably fine but I just don't know what advantage we would be trading off by waiting a month to make absolutely sure those things are good? What's the advantage to fresh transfers? Is it a cost-saving thing for the clinic? I did finally ask the nurse straight up why, but she just said that was how they usually do things. 

  I understand how freezing and thawing might bump some of the embryos out of the running, but with 8 fertilized I don't think we're in danger of having none, are we? And I feel like the consensus in this community is that freezing just weeds out the embryos that probably wouldn't have made it anyway. As it happens, PGT testing is not legal in this country, so that's not a factor. I'm totally fine with untested embryos, but don't statistics show fewer miscarriages with FET than fresh?  What am I missing here.

 My partner is a firm believer in doing whatever the doctor thinks is best, although he's not terribly impressed with this particular clinic. For one thing they've channeled virtually all info just to me and not to him which I agree is kind of strange, and he says their choice of coffee machine in the waiting room shows a clear preference for style over substance🙄 (thank you yes he is a weirdo I love him😂)


My stats all in one place: 
 36F, hypothyroidism (been on medication for the past year), decent AMH (3.4), TTC 3-4 years, never had a positive pregnancy test ever. No indications of PCOS or endo, I ovulate regularly but for several years I have been spotting heavily from 3-5 dpo until a day or two before my actual period, every time, except when I was on primolut to delay my period before starting stims. Partner's last sperm sample showed borderline low motility but on the day of egg retrieval it actually looked normal. We decided to do ICSI on half the eggs to get as much info for comparison as possible.
Protocol was Rekovelle + ganirileks, then ovitrelle and gonapeptyl. Now on cyclogest suppositories. Nothing else to say, I just didn't want suppositories to be the last word of my story. 😀

'27F' and '30M' have been dating for about 7 months but we've known eachother for 4 years. He gets me gifts for holidays but he does not focus on dating me. My love languages are words of affirmation and act of service. Due to this that is how I love most of my partners. Telling him how nice he looks and how I want to chase him around a couch. I cook/bake often so I always make enough for him to take home. I'll even grab him coffee if I know he's doing a meeting and want him to have something nice to sip on. He however doesn't meet these languages. No flirting, hardly compliments me (like once every 2 months), and doesn't do things unless I suggest it. Taking out my trash that's full or surprising me with coffee since I love starbucks. 

What brings me here? Yesterday I got my nails done. I was super hyped and jokingly said you should have paid for these. First thing out of his mouth was, ""What is that going to do for me?"" I didn't like the response so I told him I didn't ask for your red pill bullshit and told him I'd talk to him later. If your attitude is ""what is that going to do for me"" then why are you pursuing a relationship with that person. It is dripping with self seeking pleasures when relationships should feed both partners. Anyways for the most part he is okay but I'm worried about us getting married and my identity being loss in being a wife and a mom. When I've done all the wife/mom duties in the day will I receive any appreciation. Will we fall in to this life routine and I wake up one day looking for someone who wants to get away on vacations? Who prioritizes loving eachother. Someone who speaks about our future and acts on those plans. I genuinely don't think the honey moon really fades if you maintain that fire you had in the dating stage. 

Another example would be me suggesting we plan out our summer vacations. I want to go out of the country and visit a well known theme park. I picked the theme park because he is a single dad and I have never been. So regardless it would be fun for us all. 30 minutes after saying this he says I want to do a family vacation so his baby isn't left out. To which I said that's why we're going to the theme park. He liked the idea and said nothing else. Didn't even suggest places for us to go together. 

That situation irritated me because in his mind he can prioritize and plan for his child but our relationship is to much. I think you need to juggle all of those things. Make life fun and exciting for your children but still manage your relationship. It's not a job we're we do the responsibilities and part ways at the end of the shift. 

When he talks it's about what he plans for his self or his child. No affirming communication that shows he plan to be with me in the future or thinks about it. 

This is important because I find myself bored of us. I don't want to cheat but I'd rather just be single and support eachother like friends vs being shot down alot for wanting tv/movie style romantic gestures. Plan a day long date or tell me to spend the night with a dating game YOU picked out. It's boring and I'm just wondering if I should let this go? Not because there are romantic men out there but because it probably won't get any better from here?

Two were monitors in different rooms, and now my wife’s laptop doesn’t want to charge off an outlet with built-in USB-C ports. All worked fine for years before we moved out and back in. 

My Klein multimeter shows seemingly  stable voltage and amperage at the outlets. 

My idea is that post-renovation, the power in the house is super “buzzy”, which is fine for simple stuff like a coffee maker. But sensitive modern devices are gradually burning out having to regulate it. I have no idea if this theory could be based in the reality of how these devices actually work. 

Is my theory in any way realistic? What should I test? Thanks for your help sparkys :)

Im hoping to keep my rent around 2k - I don’t need much, a studio with a kitchenette I think would do.  I love live Jazz, acoustic music, and comedy in smaller venues like bars and coffee shops.  I prefer living alone, I enjoy green spaces, and quieter neighbourhoods that are socially liberal.  I tend to wake up early and like a neighbourhood with a jovial early morning vibe.  I could see myself frequently going to baseball games on weekends, preferring Yankee to Mets games as I am a fan of the best mlb franchise in history, the Toronto Blue Jays, and think Id enjoy watching the lesser franchises of the AL East try to catch up with them.

In this version, I've lived in pittsburgh since 2019 with my husband. We have been in greenfield since 2020. 

We're thinking about relocating to a different part of the city. There's not enough walkable attractions for me here (my kingdom for a coffee shop on greenfield ave). I'm mid 30s and don't drink, but I want an area that's a little more lively, with even just one walkable coffee shop, maybe a decent restaurant that's not bar food. 

I know that Squirrel Hill, Shadyside, Lawrenceville, Bakery Square, East Liberty are all going to fit that bill. But I haven't explored areas outside East Pittsburgh all that much. We moved here right before the pandemic and it really messed up our exploration of the city. Plus we work from home and I have chronic health issues, so I don't get it as much as I'd like. 

Anyway, do you have ideas on parts of the city that are walkable, with solid local business attractions, and a good vibe for a married mid-30s couple? ",0,1736699570.0,pittsburgh,10,0.42,False

Hi there, I’m new to this and am seeking some advice from a fellow believer in Christ. To begin I am Female (18) and studying in uni and have been saved by Jesus Christ. He had healed so much in me and for that I’m incredibly grateful. This walk isn’t easy and I understand that personally. 

Basically what I’m seeking help for is the following, I have been going to church with a friend of mine who I became friend with through my older brother. He reflects Christ in such beautiful ways and we would sit and Bible study together, even confide in how the Lord has saved us. Some things he told me were things I needed to hear without him even knowing but I really believed it was Christ through him that reached out to me. 

Long story short… we fell in love but before we proceeded we sought the approval of my brother which he approved and then went to speak to my parents. Unfortunately they don’t approve of us and want me to wait 2 years for him because they said I need to go on dates first and explore my options before closing myself off and need to “live my life, going out without having a ball and chain” and the age gap. Keep in mind I have had 2 relationships before and I have gotten to know a few guys before getting to know him (nothing intimate just never proceeded because I wanted to save myself for the right person, who God has planned for me) We have a bit of a big age gap. My parents have known him for years and so have I so we trust his charachter… 

However there was a night where my step dad came to me telling me that love does not solve all problems, that I need to end the relationship with him, my parents are not religious, sometimes they verbally attack me for believing in the Lord and going to church on Sundays (saying you don’t need to be in church to be good and how do I know Christianity is even the true religion) which comes to a surprise because my mom has raised me in Christ her whole life… 

That same night (often he stays at my house) he came to wake me up to talk upstairs in the lounge about things. We were both emotional in the situation at hand. And I needed to tell him what my step dad had said to me. Because he heard it the same night from a supposed “brother” in Christ of ours who was talking with my step dad. Anyways we cannot make assumptions, we went upstairs to speak and there were many tears. Many tears and such heartbreak because we only wanted to love eachother purely and lead eachother closer to the Lord as we were doing in our relationship. Anyways because it was so late we both fell asleep after long chats and cries. 

My step dad found us. And before we could explain he grabbed a hold of our family friend by the neck and sl@pped him, h1t him in the ribs and cr@cked a rib, and I got up quickly to pull him off but I was pushed to the floor, I ran to my mom and long story short they were pulled apart. The person I love so much sat there in such p@in. And there was much arguing and explaining of ourselves, my step dad took him for breakfast to talk and I sat at home with my mom. I prayed in times she wasn’t in my room asking the Lord for Mercy. Which he had given me sight of it when my mother eventually came in my room and said she could see how much we love eachother and she’s willing to give it a chance, and my step dad was on board too after he explained himself at the breakfast and how he was still willing to fight to be with me after taking such a beating. 

But unfortunately their minds changed, they dissected the situation and now we cannot be in contact for 6 months, completely cut me off from my phone to talk to him, I can’t see him in person, I am not even allowed to go to church because he’s there. Even if that’s not the reason I go. I slipped a note in his things before he left the house to say that I won’t give up on the love we have because it showed me such beautiful things. And he slipped one back through his last message to me to say he will still love me no matter the circumstances. 

We both understand we’ve disrespected my parents and we both seek forgiveness from the Lord and must sit with that burden, my brother still approves of us (not the situation but he can see our love for eachother) and said we should wait just until things calm down. 

We understand the Lord may be putting us through this to strengthen us in the long run and to rely more on him and he said he would even wait for me 2 years if need be and I know In my heart I am waiting for him, the thing is we found a way to communicate. Just to update eachother every now and then that we love eachother and that we are thinking of one another. And even to pray. However I’m not sure what to do now… am I disobeying God and letting Him down by doing this? There is a similar situation with my cousin who is dating his cousin (ironic but Gods timing is impeccable) they are also believers and her parents told them they had to cut contact for a year (because he had a rough past) and they would see eachother sometimes for 15/30 minutes for coffee and would make an effort and now the very thing they didn’t like about him they are seeking him bf or help on because she is facing difficulty with some things. And they’re in a relationship now, taking it slowly with the parents. 

I’m seeking advice in this situation and what to do best. He has nothing but pure intentions and I’ve seen it not only with his beautiful actions and words but in his character as well. We are both in a tough situation and I’m just here to ask for any helpful advice or insight. My mom has built a lot of resentment towards him and is labeling him a manipulator and that he took advantage of me. That he should have stepped away when she said to wait. And though she may be right, that night when we were talking we were talking about planning to tell them and give it one more shot at helping them understand this is true love and not “puppy love” as they mocked it to be. Many family friends had seen us even if we didn’t initiate couple like contact and approved of us as they thought we were dating. 

My mom labels him as a ball and chain because with both her and my grandmother, they’ve gotten married at 19 and made really bad decisions when it came to love. My mother ran away. My grandmother also ran away. But I don’t want that. I want to break this long line of daughter trauma and rebellion. I seek the Lord to break all these family strongholds on me. My mom was very rebellious and has a lot of resentment towards my grandmother on how she was treated but little does she know is that she does the same to me. I just wish she would stop comparing me to herself and see me for me. That I would still enjoy life with a partner by my side to support me. 

What hurts me most is I have to take part in church online and it breaks me because that is the Lords house and part of me feels like I’ve been kicked out. (It may be the consequence of my actions for disobeying my parents but sometimes it feels like otherwise) I want to go back to my community, receive communion and continue to seek repentance, my mom was supposed to join me for church so that I may go but she doesn’t want to anymore… that is all of it really, where I currently am. My step dad said to my face that he won’t even be going to church 3 months from now. Thank you for taking the time to read this.  I appreciate any little bit of advice at all.

I looked at the online menu and it says a blondie is actually a vanilla caramel coffee, instead of a lighter brew like I had originally assumed. 

My problem is how do I order anything? Normally we get coffee from a place where all I have to do is order the size and which latte and if I need it hot, iced or frozen. The menu for 7Brew says customize everything, do they ask you all of that (specifically I am confused by the sweetness level) or do you need to say what sweetness level you want while you're ordering? Also does a blondie come with caramel syrup already in it or do I need to ask for it? I don't want to sound like I don't know what I'm doing when I go to order. 

TLDR; I'm really excited to try 7Brew but I am anxious about the ordering process.

I decided to do 60 days because on March 15 I plan to travel and know that I will likely not be able to work out or track calories accurately/read/stay off phone, so instead of setting myself up for failure, I have modified. The rules are modified from the 75 Hard Challenge. This challenge is a dopamine re-set.

**About me and why:** 39 yo female, 5'8"" and current weight unknown. I was 127 lbs last July, but I moved to a new city for grad school and spend a lot of time alone and have been eating a lot of sugar, etc that I normally do not eat. I was not going wild with calorie intake and tracked my calories 70% during this time, but I know I have likely gained 7-10 lbs (probably a lot of water weight) and do not feel comfortable in my body. I noticed I wear sweats 95% of the time now and do not attempt to look nice anymore. I also fell into a deep depression during the holidays and spend most of my time sleeping. This is very unlike me. I was running and going to hot yoga every day. In Oct I was training for a marathon and was running up to 17 miles a day one day a week and running shorter distances the other days. But I got into a short-lived relationship and now that it's over, I don't want to allow it to affect me negatively and want to get back my confidence. I am usually a very confident person; I have been running for 15 years and have a great job and am am attractive person. I want to get back to my energetic self that would hike 12 miles on the weekend, hike up 4,000 feet elevation, etc. That's just who I was 9 months ago, and now she is completely gone.

I have intermittent fasted most of my life. I grew up not eating roughly past 4-5pm every day. I am used to 2 meals a day and have eaten that way since I was in high school.

Running 3 miles is not difficult for me, but keeping it up for 60 days will be. I am mostly doing this not for calorie deficit but to stay in shape and not lose the cardiovascular health I have built. I am also much more confident when working out regularly.

I do not track water anymore, but that combined with a severe caffeine and soda addiction has made me wake up every morning with my mouth basically glued shut it is so dry. I weaned off caffeine from Dec 26, 2024 and it took about 10 days to recover. That was very rough! It is hard to stay away from caffeine because it feels like it is in everything. So I need to stay away from chocolate too.

Sugar is a major culprit in what I can only describe as an inflamed torso. I wake up and my tissues feel like they're on fire. I assume I am inflaming my body with sugar because if I do not eat it, I am fine. When I do, I start feeling the inflammation within a few hours, and it goes into the next day. Saturday morning it was so bad I could not even drive without pain. It threw me off my running game (who wants to jiggle inflamed tissues? It hurts it even worse). So to stay on my running game, I need to be off sugar.

I have been binging TV and playing iPhone games on the couch for the last 3 weeks, and I absolutely need to stop. I do read about 40 books a year so want to stay more focused on that goal and my school work.

My phone is a major distraction, and at this time I do not want to focus on other people and rather focus on myself.

I abstained from alcohol July of 2023 until Dec 2024 but drank for 3 nights in Dec and noticed it completely messed with my mood and energy/depressed me. I am not big into drinking but do have a beer once in a while. This should therefore not be hard to do but I am putting it on the list anyway because drinking would throw off my challenge.

Normally I am a fairly disciplined person with some flaws, so this will still be a challenge for me but not super far off from my baseline, but still more disciplined from my baseline.

**My goal:** complete the challenge with 100% accuracy and drop the body fat I accumulated. I realize this is not really a dramatic weight loss challenge, but I assume I will lose some weight, and this puts me on track to lose about 7 lbs in the 60 days.

I am hoping this helps me re-gain some natural dopamine.

Let me know what you think and what you might be working on in this new year. I will post updates! I am not planning to weigh myself but will monitor my weight based on how my clothes are fitting.

**Challenge:**

1. 1200 calories a day net after exercise. Basically eat 1500 cals/day. I maintain at 1600 or so.
2. No sugar, caffeine, or alcohol. No cheat meals. No eating out.

---------------------------------------------

The Jordan 4 is one of the most celebrated sneakers in history, embodying not just performance but also style and culture. Since its release, it has evolved in several ways, captivating sneaker enthusiasts and casual wearers alike. Let’s dive into the remarkable journey of the Jordan 4 and explore what makes it a true icon.

### The Birth of a Legend

Launched in 1989, the Jordan 4 was designed by legendary sneaker designer Tinker Hatfield. This model was introduced during Michael Jordan’s peak, coinciding with his rise to fame. The design drew inspiration from the world of aviation, incorporating a visible air unit in the sole and mesh panels for breathability. These features not only enhanced performance but also gave the sneaker a unique look.

### Notable Colorways

One of the distinguishing factors of the Jordan 4 is its array of colorways. Some notable ones include:

- **White/Cement:** A classic that remains highly sought after by collectors.
- **Fire Red:** Bold and vibrant, this colorway is instantly recognizable.
- **Black/Infrared:** This version was a favorite among sneakerheads, combining elegance with a sporty edge.

These colorways have contributed to the sneaker’s popularity and versatility, allowing wearers to style them in various ways.

### Cultural Impact

The Jordan 4 wasn’t just a hit on the court; it quickly seeped into popular culture, appearing in music videos, movies, and streetwear. In the early ‘90s, hip-hop artists like DJ Jazzy Jeff and Will Smith showcased the sneaker, solidifying its place in the urban fashion scene. This connection significantly boosted its desirability among younger generations.

### Collaboration and Modern Releases

In recent years, the Jordan 4 has seen numerous collaborations with high-end fashion brands and artists. For example, the ""Off-White x Air Jordan 4"" collaboration by Virgil Abloh gained massive attention and sold out within moments of release. These collaborations bring fresh perspectives to the iconic design while staying true to its roots.

### Collectibility and Resale Value

The Jordan 4 has become a collector's item, with certain versions fetching astounding prices in the resale market. Limited releases and exclusive collaborations lead to high demand, and sneakerheads are willing to invest significant sums to add them to their collections. The rarity of specific pairs contributes to their mystique and allure.

### Tips for Purchasing Jordan 4 Sneakers

If you’re considering adding a pair of Jordan 4s to your wardrobe, here are some tips to ensure you make a wise purchase:

- **Research:** Before buying, check recent prices on resale platforms to understand the market.
- **Buy from Reputable Sources:** Ensure that you purchase from authorized sellers or reputable resale platforms to avoid counterfeits.
- **Check for Authenticity:** Look for unique features like stitching quality and packaging that indicate authenticity.

### Caring for Your Jordan 4s

After investing in a pair of Jordan 4s, taking care of them is crucial to maintain their condition. Here are some tips:

- **Clean Regularly:** Use a soft brush and mild soap to clean the upper and soles.
- **Store Properly:** Keep them in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight to prevent fading.
- **Use Sneaker Shields:** These can help maintain the shape of your shoes when not in use.

The evolution of the Jordan 4 showcases its versatility, cultural significance, and unrelenting appeal. Whether you’re a seasoned collector, a fashion enthusiast, or a casual wearer, this sneaker is bound to connect with you. As trends evolve and new designs emerge, the Jordan 4 will always hold a special place in sneaker history—a true icon for generations to come.

Let’s explore some tips on how to style the Jordan 4 effectively.

### Casual Day Out

### Active Lifestyle

The Jordan 4 is not just a style statement; it’s also great for workouts. When dressing for the gym or a casual game of basketball, comfort is key.

- **Top:** Moisture-wicking tank top
- **Socks:** Performance ankle socks
- **Accessories:** Sports watch or gym bag

### Nights Out

Want to stand out on a night out? The Jordan 4 can be dressed up effortlessly. Choose a pair of well-fitted chinos or tailored trousers. Match them with a stylish button-down shirt or a fitted polo. The key is to keep your colors balanced and avoid overly busy patterns. Complete the look with a sleek watch and a stylish belt. Here are steps to achieve this sophisticated look:

- **Top:** Fitted button-down or polo
- **Sneakers:** Clean, monochromatic Jordan 4s
- **Accessories:** Leather belt and watch

### Sporty Chic

If you want to incorporate the Jordan 4 into a sporty chic style, consider mixing athletic elements with fashionable pieces. Try pairing your sneakers with a midi skirt or a tailored dress. Add a graphic sweatshirt or an oversized blazer to create a unique contrast. This look strikes a balance between comfort and style, making it perfect for brunch or a casual gathering. To pull off this stylish mix, remember these pointers:

- **Dress:** Midi skirt or casual dress
- **Top:** Graphic sweatshirt or oversized blazer
- **Sneakers:** Vibrant or classic Jordan 4s
- **Accessories:** Crossbody bag or statement earrings

### Color Coordination

One important aspect of styling the Jordan 4 is to pay attention to color coordination. The sneaker comes in many different colors, so choose outfits that either complement or give a pop of contrast to the shoes. Here are some tips on matching your colors:

- **Neutral Tones:** If your Jordan 4s have a bold color, wear neutral shades like black, white, or grey.
- **Monochrome Look:** Match your pants or top with a similar color in your Jordan 4s for a cohesive look.
- **Pops of Color:** Use accessories, like hats or scarves, to pull in similar colors found on the shoes.

Ultimately, the Jordan 4 is a sneaker that conveys both personality and style. The key is to feel confident in what you wear. Regardless of the occasion, let your creativity shine and have fun with your outfits!

October 5 2023 nagstart kaming lumabas. Lumabas na may nangyayari.. noon magkatext o chat pa naman kami. But he never calls me. Siya nagfifirst move pa naman nung una. Madalas coffee date na may ganun after. After a year, ok pa naman kami. Medyo nagiging cold na. Pero lumalabas pa din kami. paminsan minsan overnight pa. Pero November last year iniiwasan na ako. Ayaw na din akong isabay pauwi. Tinatakasan na ako. Di na din nagrereply. Puro seen nalang.

By the way, kawork ko siya. At nafall na ako sa kanya. Mali diba.

Dec 17 2024 Nagchat ako na sasabay ako pauwi. Kala ko oo un. Kasi naseen naman niya though di niya sinabi na di pwede. Nag antay ako sa lobby ng office. Kasi andun din naman siya. Kala ko inaantay lang namin na makapag out siya kasi late siyang pumasok. Mali pala ako. nagdahilan siyang may pupuntahan kaya di ako maisasabay. Siyempre nahurt ako.

Dec 18 2024 nagbayad siya agad ng utang sakin. Di niya un inabot. Pinatong lang niya sa may harap ng cashier. so alam kong may away.

Dec 29 2024 kala ko di na ako ichachat. Pero guys nagchat siya. Nanghihiram ng pera. Pinahiraman ko. Mahal ko na eh. Tinanong ko pa if galit pa ba siya. Sabi niya hindi na raw. I thought were ok na. January 6-7 2025 magkasabay kaming umuuwi. Walang imikan sa sasakyan.

January 8 2025 last namin. Umamin siya. May gf na raw siya. Masakit pala ung ganun noh. Sobrang sakit. Siya sobrang happy, ako ito umiiyak pa din",1,1736698596.0,OffMyChestPH,0,1.0,False

QuikTrip really enables this attitude and we are taught/told we have to take their abuse (sometimes LITERALLY) and can’t do anything about it. That’s why a customer feels like they can yell at you, disrespect you at the counter then when you respond to the disrespect they’re appalled and confused like oh you forgot I’m a human with feelings and I demand respect at the register? I’ve literally had a customer threaten me and yell at me and when I retaliated they said “you can’t talk to me like that” and when someone said “but you’re yelling at her” she said “I’m the customer I can do that” and what will QuikTrip do? Reprimand us. And if you aren’t licking the customers ass cheeks they act like you’re doing something to THEM. Like sweetheart I had to be here at 5am. I got no sleep, my car is barely working and I have no employees because everyone called out, just get your coffee and go. You don’t need me to hold your hand and sing ring around the Rosies for you to have a successful transaction. And for any impending bootlickers that’s about to say something along the lines of “suck it up” SHUT THE FUCK UP.
