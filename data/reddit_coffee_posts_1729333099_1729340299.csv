My ghoster and I hit it off quickly via hinge and moved to texting the same day, as he was asking so many questions and the conversation was flowing so naturally.
The Monday after we met up for coffee. He was devastatingly handsome. We met again Wednesday for another date. We stayed in touch so beautifully with well paced momentum and met up for a third date the week after. 
Ever since, the texting was dropping off and I noticed he unmatched me on hinge. He also said ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see‚Äù when I inquired about getting together on our upcoming days off. It made me feel so confused because I genuinely thought he was very interested based on all the kind things he was saying, the good morning and good night texts, how good time together felt in person. So texting slowly started dropping off. So I ended up sending message and said hey ‚ÄúI noticed things feel a little different and I just wanted to make sure you aren‚Äôt receiving mixed signals from my end. I‚Äôm still very interested in you but am just trying to be mindful of what I‚Äôm perceiving here (lessened interest) and wanted to make sure you don‚Äôt receive mixed signals from me‚Äù thats the gist of it. He told me he‚Äôs still interested in seeing me and I thought everything was good.  I didn‚Äôt hear back after that conversation. So a few days later I strike up another conversation and it went well and then he left it at that and stopped replying.
It hurts so much because I really was starting to like him and feel hopeful. I have thrown myself into the gym and tried to pour some love back onto myself but it stings so much to wake up each day and hope he reaches out, then to go to bed realizing he didn‚Äôt. Today is one week.

The previously named ‚ÄòTooges‚Äô but now getting renovated and called ‚ÄòTamp & Steam‚Äô was selling vegan waffles.

I have to systematically avoid restaurants and if I find one I have only one option on the menu and even then I have to make sure they leave the lactose out because the restaurants just seem not to be trusted or change recipes without changing the menu.

I'm experimenting to test the notion that weight loss is not simple math and that maybe there really is such a thing as 'high-calorie weight loss' - which sounds like nonsense - but I have the numbers below to look at.

I‚Äôm testing whether factors like meal timing, macro distribution, or metabolic adaptation might explain why I'm losing weight at this calorie intake.

Here's the table I use to track my weight, calories and macros as I ran my experiment in high-calorie weight loss:

You'll note something interesting. Look at my calorie intake. It averages over 2,700 calories per day.

I'm a male almost 62 years old, don't exercise, am 5'10"" - my caloric intake is well above what the 'calories in, calories out' (CICO) would predict.

So you see my calories and macros per day. They're too high for what CICO would predict would cause a 5 pound weight loss. What did I experiment with?

* Try to eat just one meal per day (OMAD)
* No exercise
* Intentionally vary my calorie and macros dramatically from day to day. It makes the diet fun.
* My protein and fat averages high.
* Eat mostly single-ingredient foods - eggs, hamburger, sardines, tomatoes, avocado, apples, grapes, brie cheese, potatoes, garbanzo beans, cucumbers, chicken thighs - stuff like this - but have anything I want for about 20% of my calories. Cookies, takeout pizza, bread and jelly, chocolate were part of it - and I don't eat diet foods - I eat the real things.

I take a few supplements like a multivitamin, vitamin d and a high quality fish oil. I can drink a pot of coffee per day. I don't take any weight loss drugs or supplements.

What factors do you think might explain this? Is it meal timing, high protein intake, or something else?

1g77axs,https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/1g77axs/why_is_the_only_local_storage_option_for_aurora/,Why is the only local storage option for Aurora PostgreSQL Graviton Processings the R6GD?,"Sunday's coffee time is dedicated to researching and writing about RDS Aurora PostgreSQL reserved instances.  I came across the snippet about I/O Optimized clusters having locale tiered NVMe caching and storage of temporary tables on the pricing page.  So I went to research which Graviton powered instance types have locale NVMe storage.  To my shock and surprise the only instance type with local NVMe storage using a Graviton process is the R6gd.  

I'm sitting here hoping the X8G instance type (Graviton 4) will be supported in the next two months before we have to commit to reserved instances on a project that goes live in January, but as it stands it looks like you would have to choose an older R6gd instance type if you wanted that locale caching.  I don't really find using a Graviton 2 all that appealing just to get the local NVMe storage option.  Maybe if the X2G (also Graviton 2) had it I would consider it just because that instance type has the highest RAM vs CPU ratio.

It just seems to me that if the desire is for customers to select I/O optimized to also receive the read caching and local temporary table support, you would offer all your Graviton instance families with the option of local NVMe storage.  The feature is over a year old at this point.  Here is the announcement:

Was diagnosed with diverticular (colonoscopy's) about 15 years ago and at the time I had quite a lot of flare ups, but found that taking 1 laxido a day solved the majority of my digestive issues and I‚Äôd largely forgotten about it and have been able to eat anything and everything and usually do.

However, 2 months ago I had a brain tumour removed and the trauma (and possible lots of drugs) to my body appears to have triggered something again in my lower abdomen which I (and my GP/physician) strongly suspect is diverticulitis.

I‚Äôm currently on my third time of doing a week long course of antibiotics, but so far each time a course ends, the pain and problems flare up again.

**Question One**

I‚Äôm currently on 7 day course of co-amoxiclav (maybe also known as Augmentin or Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid), but I can feel in my tummy that this flare up isn‚Äôt going to clear up by the time the course finishes. My first question is would you think it be fairly normal to go back to my GP and ask for another 7 days taking this to a two week course straight and not giving it a chance to flare up or is two weeks straight of antibiotics a bad thing?

**Question Two**

My next question is, because it‚Äôs been such a long time I‚Äôve been in this position, am I doing the right things and is there something else I can do better?

My current diet currently is basically:

Main meals:

Air fried fish plain (Cod/Basa/Salmon)

Air fried skinless chicken Breast

Plain boiled rice (maybe with a touch of soy to add some flavouring)

Boiled or mashed potatoes

Occasional simple slow cooked chicken stew (with peeled potatoes for bulk)

Lunches:

Sandwiches, very plain white bread, vegetable spread with fillings of tinned tuna, egg or thin slice of processed ham

‚ÄúTreat‚Äù:

Jelly/

Drink

Black coffee

Water

Clear Apple Juice

Anything I should remove from this diet or anything I should/could add (really getting bored of this diet)?

I woke up and like every day, I prepared my coffee and went outside for my first cigarette before I start work. I lit it and immediately as I inhaled, I gagged. I was convinced that I was gonna throw up right there in front of my door. So I tried one more time, just to see if I maybe was just tweaking. But it happened again. I took a sip of my coffee and tried again, but nothing changed. I couldn't finish that cigarette for the life of me. So I went back inside. I thought I might just have gotten sick and now my body was refusing to cooperate, so I thought I'll try again later.

Well, it did not get better. I tried again later in the day, and then once again in the evening, but there was just no way I could smoke a whole cigarette without almost throwing up. 

So I tried again the next day. Still the same. Here we are, a week later. I tried again yesterday and it was the same, again. I feel like I am having symptoms of withdrawal and it's driving me nuts, but not enough to make me overcome the gagging and sickness I get whenever I try to smoke.

So I've just decided to give up. My body doesn't want me to smoke anymore, so I won't. Maybe some time from now I will consider myself lucky that my body made this decision for me. ",14,1729338036.0,TrueOffMyChest,6,0.95,False

NZ needs to up the fight against Diabetes and other chronic metabolic diseases. NZ should try to follow the Singapore model.

Singapore has Nutri-Grade guidelines that all packaged food companies must follow (and even coffee shops like Starbucks). This is based on ‚ÄòSugar Content‚Äô. 

Singapore has declared war on Diabetes. And declared Sugar as Enemy No.1. 

Hence this rule.Guideline:

A = 0% Sugar, B = 4% Sugar, C= 8% Sugar and D= 12%. It is color-coded too. A is Green and D is Red. Informing, if D avoid.
But that‚Äôs not all. 

If your product is either a C or a D, the label must come in the front of the packaging. And if D, PRODUCT CANNOT BE ADVERTISED. You can‚Äôt market it.

Some of the products being advertised in New Zealand will NOT be allowed to be advertised in Singapore

Every NZ hone should start to apply some judgement. It is very simple. Overturn the pack, see nutritional information. If sugar is more than 8%, don‚Äôt get it home. If it is bad for a Singaporean kid, it is certainly bad for your kids. Kids are kids, right?",5,1729337643.0,newzealand,4,0.78,False

1g76wud,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmenopause/comments/1g76wud/fifties_adhd_is_no_walk_in_the_park/,Fifties + ADHD is no walk in the park. ,"First, I wish there was more activity here bc I can‚Äôt stand reading posts from 21yo‚Äôs on the adhd women sub. Sorry. Not to be age negative or anything. 

Now that that‚Äôs outta the way. I came here to - idk - rant. The year started out with:
Me being unemployed and on unemployment. My elderly mother transferred to a new nursing home after a scare of sepsis bc the home she was in was not taking good care of her. My nephew taking his own life. My sister/ his mom leaning heavily on me. While my other four sisters did nothing. My unemployment ran out in April. HRT is $150. Every 3months. Which I can barely afford. My Straterra is $50 a month. My psych is with Grow Therapy (virtual) and they either cancel appts or are unable to turn their camera on during call and blame it on me. They have no answers for me about the cost and my insurance won‚Äôt pay even though they had claimed to take my insurance. So now it looks like I have to look for a new psych‚Ä¶. Again. My 401k is being depleted. My cousin who was a good emotional support to me over the loss of my nephew was diagnosed with glioblastoma on the 4th of July and is now becoming a shell of her former self and has a one year prognosis. My only two ‚Äî who I thought were good ‚Äî friends have not been very supportive around the loss of my nephew (who was like the kid I never had). I‚Äôve been looking for a job for 6 months. Ive been visiting my cousin weekly and am now so burned out. I‚Äôm so physically and emotionally depleted I have not visited my mom‚Äôs since summer. She is in advanced stage dementia and no longer can recognize me and when she does she cries profusely.

And I can‚Äôt find a job to save my life. Ageism. Lots of it. 

The vitamins and supplements I‚Äôm supposed to take with my hormones: Dim and saw palmetto. I just forget to take them. Like every day. I‚Äôm lucky if I take my Prozac and Straterra.

I‚Äôm just so depleted. So exhausted. Find myself sleeping in my car at every errand I run. Even after drinking 8 ounces of coffee. Seriously.

And my psychiatrist just keeps chastising me for my bad sleep hygiene.

This year has been a dumpster fire. Why is everything so fucking hard?! I feel like I can‚Äôt gain any momentum or any progress. I‚Äôm too emotional. My ADHD just exhausts my brain. And I had to stop talk therapy because of money issues.

Thanks for listening. I just feel like my life is one big caldron of pain loss grief suffering. I fought so hard to get HRT and ADHD meds. Only to be shit broke and having to look for a doctor‚Ä¶.. again. 

I‚Äôm sorry I am TMI‚Äôing all over this space. But I just never had any idea my 50s were gonna be so so hard. üòûüò≠üòû",2,1729337631.0,adhdmenopause,1,1.0,False

1g76twv,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1g76twv/biggest_slacker_ever/,Biggest slacker ever,"I used to work at a governmental job where coming into work at 07:30 in the morning was the norm, some would come in at 08:00.

This guy who had worked in Stockholm (Sweden) moved back to my mid-sized city, a few hours away, where coming in at 09:00 wasn‚Äôt unusual. He came in at around 09:00 at this new job, and got some comments like ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre coming in a little late‚Äù or whatever, and since we worked fairly close together he‚Äôd say things to me like ‚ÄúDamn farmers, getting up early in the morning to milk the cows‚Äù and stuff like that (those comments where kind of funny to be honest). But, he fairly quickly kind of adapted and started coming in at around 08:00.

His boss where located in another city, and he really had no one in his team on site he worked close with. So, as time passed by, he started getting into work later and later, and I‚Äôm guessing it became clear to him that either no one noticed (certainly his boss didn't), or nobody really cared.

A few years later, the guy had started coming in at 09:00, and left at around 17:00, taking an hour long lunch break he‚Äôs working 1 hour less a day than he should be. At this time, we had the same boss, and my office had a window towards the entrance gate, so I would see people coming and going.

At this time, we had been working together for maybe 7 years, some 2 years having the same boss. The guy starts leaving at 16:30, still taking an hour long lunch break. So he should be working until 18:00, meaning he‚Äôs now working 1.5 hours less a day than he should be.

Most of us would still come in at 07:30 kind of out of habit, I also appreciated coming in early and finishing up early, so I would leave work at 16:00, taking a half an hour lunch break. This dude would now leave work with the rest of us (at 16:00), so now he‚Äôs working 2 hours less a day than he should be.

Adding to this, the social culture was to have a 15 minute coffee break at 09:00, and another one at 14:00. This guy would do both, only he would stay behind after those 15 minutes and then have another 15 minute break with those that took that break a little later. Same at lunch, he would take an hour long lunch break, then hang back and have a coffee for 30 minutes or so with those that came for lunch a little later.

So, he‚Äôs at work 2 hours less a day than he‚Äôs getting payed for. And, he‚Äôs in his office 1 hour less than he should.

Also, we had this awesome work benefit where we where encouraged to work out 3 hours a week on office hours (it was a government thing). So, needless to say, this guy would do that. And not only that, whenever someone asked him to tag along to the office gym, go for a walk or whatever, he‚Äôd tag along. The result being he wouldn‚Äôt just consume those 3 hours, more like 5 hours a week. 2 more than he should.

This guy now gets a new colleague who has the exact job description as him, and the two of them share the same office. This colleague of his has a young daughter, and to make things work at home, he comes in at 07:00 Usually being one of the first ones coming into the office in the morning. Being that early, and taking half an hour lunch break, he would leave at 15:30.

This freaking guy now reasons kind of like ‚ÄúWell if you‚Äôre leaving, what am I still doing here?‚Äù. So he now quits work at 15:30. I can see him walking out the gate.

At this point, this has become some sort of bad joke, with him being in the office 3 hours less a day than he‚Äôs getting payed for.

Let‚Äôs summarize. He‚Äôs in the office 15 hours a week less than he should. With the coffee breaks, he‚Äôs in the break room 2.5 hours a week more than he should, and taking ruffly 2 hours extra of those ‚Äúwork out‚Äù hours (I don‚Äôt know how to translate that correctly from Swedish). In total, that adds up to 19.5 hours less spent at the office. Effectively, he‚Äôs working 50% while getting payed for 100% (meaning a 40 hour work week).

Adding to this, when I say ‚Äúin the office‚Äù, that means physically sitting behind his desk. I don‚Äôt mean actually working. This guy is really bad at his job, bad as in close to being useless.

For those of you familiar with software like Microsoft Teams, you know there‚Äôs a status indicator that would be yellow, green or red. Green (‚Äúavailable‚Äù) meaning you‚Äôre actively working at your computer, when you leave and the Teams app notices you‚Äôre away, it automatically turns yellow as in ‚Äúaway‚Äù. This guy got approval to buy a non company managed laptop for ‚Äúeducational purposes‚Äù, so he‚Äôs surfin‚Äô the web on that thing all day, meaning his status indicator is very literately yellow (or ‚Äúaway‚Äù) all the time.

The result is, his colleague is doing all the work, meaning progress isn‚Äôt very impressive for this two man team. At our weekly team meetings, these two have the same status updates pretty much every the time. We work in IT, so their job at this point is to do things like monthly patching, which would be fine, if their job description weren‚Äôt system engineers, in charge of system development (not as in being programmers, more like introducing commercial off the shelf software into our IT systems).

A few years later I quit, not related to that I lost it at one of those weekly meetings. I was team lead for a group of engineers who where some of the freaking best in their respective fields, and just watching these two jokers doing pretty much nothing got the best of me, and I openly called them out on not doing much of anything. I kind of regret that, but then I also kind of not. After I blew up, pretty much all of my team members did come up to me telling me that it was about time somebody said something.

That was 2 years ago, and I‚Äôm 100% sure the guy still works 20 hour weeks, getting payed for 40. And, that his colleague is still doing the bare minimum.",0,1729337301.0,antiwork,7,0.4,False

Is a question I got asked today.

My answer is that I would, In a Heartbeat, I‚Äôm at the right age to start dating and I work part-time at one of my parents mobile coffee stall, but I still go to school though.

Even though I want to get into a relationship, I still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea, especially since we move states quite frequently.

I don‚Äôt want one that only lasts for a couple of months, I want one where I can see putting a ring on her hand, making her a cup of coffee every morning, taking her on a beach, a walk on the park, adopting a dog, and maybe break a few beds. But I can‚Äôt seem to see any possibilities for me to get into that type of relationship. Maybe I‚Äôm just hungry for some thrill,
The thrill of love.

It isn‚Äôt really much of a thrill if the distance between us is unending, I‚Äôve tried that, when I was about 14 years old, gosh, I was really stupid and immature than I am right now, I don‚Äôt even know why she liked me, I did ask but they were always the same answer no matter how many times I try asking again, ‚Äúbecause you have really long eye lashes, and a cute smile‚Äù, I look like an Alien to be honest, but if she only went for me because I looked ‚Äúcute‚Äù, then I want a bear to gnaw my face, she probably didn‚Äôt even know what I really was like, we both only really talked at school, maybe little bit outside but mostly at school, maybe I was more like a vanity for her, but its kinda hard to believe that because she would always have that smile on her face when she sees me, I like her, but I don‚Äôt know if she really does like me for who I really am and not just my face.

This feels more like vent really, but I also want to know the perspective of others, how they dealt with it, if there are others that is or has been in this type of predicament.

However, all these images look horrible, making the product look bad. Visit Amazon right now and search for something you need. You‚Äôll find the product you need but won‚Äôt like the visuals. Most sellers believe that basic lifestyle and product images are more than enough to attract potential buyers.

# Seeing is Believing

# Visuals Are Everything

Visuals matter more than anything! They carry your product listing. Informative and engaging copywriting is just a small part of the listing. It does not have the same effect as visuals. Seeing something attractive boosts the trust factor and creates a psychological anchoring effect. More importantly, product visuals such as lifestyle images also help induce positive emotions in customers. Hence, sellers must use visuals to lead the customers to the copywriting and other parts of the listing. Live-action shots, beautiful models, and storytelling could elevate your product images and increase sales. Without¬†[lifestyle product photography](https://www.amzonestep.com/portfolio), it is almost impossible to induce emotions through images.

# Influencing Emotions

Product visuals have the unique ability to tap directly into emotions, making products feel more relatable, desirable, and essential. Appealing product images evoke a sense of luxury, practicality, and comfort, depending on the product style. For example, a lifestyle image of a model wearing a blanket evokes a sense of comfort and warmth. Hence, visuals help create an emotional connection. Use product images and visuals to show buyers how the product enhances their lives. Create a powerful first impression, resonating with customers. If you connect emotionally with customers, almost half will immediately add the product to the cart.

# Better Trust Factor

Despite the return policies and helpful customer service, Amazon buyers are wary of buying something with bad visuals that cannot be replaced. Moreover, they want accurate visuals that correctly represent the product.¬†[Professional¬†Amazon photography](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-professional-amazon-product-photography-increases-sales/)¬†covers all product angles and features, removing doubts about misleading visuals. A professional look also helps to create a consistent branding feel. Lastly, showcasing the products in real-life settings ensures a higher trust factor. It assists the buyers in imagining how they would use the product.

# Comprehensive Storytelling



Through carefully chosen visuals, brands can tell a story that resonates with customers on a deeper emotional level. Photography also has the power to manipulate narratives, as it can highlight specific features while downplaying others. If you don‚Äôt want to highlight your product weaknesses, you can create visuals that wholly ignore those parts. On the other hand, photography can soften or downplay certain elements by focusing on different aspects, presenting the product in a way that aligns with what customers want to see. The control over visual elements helps frame the story in a desired manner. Therefore,¬†[professional product photography](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-does-amazon-product-photography-affect-conversion-rates/)¬†will assist you in subtly guiding customers‚Äô perceptions and emotions in a way that words alone cannot achieve.

¬†

Contextual images and comparisons are essential in removing confusion about sizing and usage. Display products alongside familiar objects, helping customers to understand the actual size. For example, a coffee mug can be shown next to a standard notebook or held in a person‚Äôs hand, making it easy for customers to visualize how it would fit into their daily routine. Similarly, contextual imagery can clarify how a product is intended to be used. Comparisons are also valuable for sizing and usage guidance. For instance, showing different sizes of the same product side by side can help customers choose the best option for their needs.

¬†

Sequential imagery is another reason why¬†[professional product photography](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-product-photography)¬†is a game-changer. Show the product at each step. Amazon sellers should demystify the process and make it feel manageable and straightforward. For example, a series of photos might begin with the product in its packaging, followed by images of the unboxing experience, and finally, step-by-step shots of the assembly process. Sequential images provide guidance, helping customers to understand each installation step. It can also highlight any included tools, accessories, or unique features that might go unnoticed in a single shot.

# Enhanced Ad Visuals

You must be asking how¬†[professional product photography¬†](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-product-photography)affects ads. The entire point of having attractive product visuals is to ensure effective marketing. Your video ads have a short window of opportunity to please the customer. Hence, product ads should have outstanding visuals, encouraging the viewers to click on the ad. Otherwise, there is no point in running ads on Amazon. The product will get buried behind the stiff competition on Amazon. Stunning product photography will help obtain better product visuals, which can be used to improve ad visuals. Before creating an ad campaign, you should ensure the product visuals look desirable.

# Improved Returns Per Ad

The return on ad spending (ROAS) significantly increases due to¬†[professional product photography toronto](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-product-photography). When ads feature high-quality, eye-catching images, they‚Äôre more likely to stand out in a crowded marketplace. Appealing visuals resonate with a more targeted audience, ensuring better ad spending. Hence, better visuals will improve the traffic quality and ensure the target demographic clicks on the product listing. Maximizing ad returns is a great way to optimize your campaigns.¬†

¬†

Mesmerizing potential buyers at first sight is essential as it leads to higher conversions. Stunning, high-quality visuals with enhanced lighting catch customer attention. Simply advertising a product is insufficient. Visuals have to tell a captivating story. Showcase the value and create an emotional connection with your ads. Your ads must feel like a compelling experience, encouraging customers to click on the ads. Appropriately utilizing visuals creates trust and action, transforming casual browsers into loyal buyers. Draw in customers with highly engaging product images created through product photography.

# Visual Appeal Leads to More Clicks

Product quality matters most on Amazon, but good visuals can make a product look much better. If the product quality is ordinary, you can raise it to an extraordinary status through visuals. Appealing professional Amazon listing images make a product appear more desirable and valuable than its actual features. It manipulates the purchasing decisions through a bias towards visually appealing products. The initial appeal helps increase conversions as customers are drawn to eye-catching visuals. However, while great visuals can boost sales in the short term, consistent quality and authenticity are essential for fostering long-term trust and repeat purchases.

# Showcase Product Value Through Quality Images



Amazon product photography is a powerful tool to show the product value by highlighting unique features, quality, and functionality. Detailed, high-definition images showcase the materials, design, and textures, helping customers to make an informed decision. Lifestyle images demonstrate the product in real-life settings, letting customers envision how it fits into their lives. Well-crafted visuals also allow you to showcase product details that might not be immediately noticeable, such as stitching, durability, or multi-functional features. Help your customers to have a better understanding of your product with professional photography!

# [Case Studies: Optimized Images Lead to More Sales](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/design-matters-a-b-test-uncovers-the-winning-main-image-formula-for-amazon-sales-and-conversions/)

A/B testing revealed a significant difference in sales when using¬†[professional product photography](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-product-photography)¬†versus a standard image on Amazon. According to our study, images made with professional product photography outperformed the regular image.¬†[Product listing](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-structure-your-listing-updates/)¬†with enhanced images had more sales. Results show how important it is to improve aesthetics because it directly impacts sales. Our test showed how investing in professional visuals can turn browsing customers into buyers, reinforcing the value of using quality images to drive success on Amazon.

# Anchoring Effect

# Amaze Buyers

Use enhanced visuals to amaze people and play with their psychology. It is all about creating a positive product perception. Evoke desire, stir emotions, and spark curiosity. Use strategic lighting, angles, and composition to make your product look irresistible, turning an ordinary scroll into a moment of wonder. It is essential to tap into the psychology of your buyers to make your product stand out. Make every detail count and let your visuals talk, leading customers down a path where they feel compelled to click, explore, and convert.

# Influence Customers

Influencing customers is the most essential part of the Amazon journey. Powerful images create aspiration, encouraging buyers to experience the product just by looking at visuals. Color composition, background, context, and other aspects affect specific emotions. Amazon photography will help you use visual cues to influence the motivations of your potential customers. Make customers feel your product is the solution to their problems. Lead them to imagine their lives enhanced and watch as the visuals you have carefully curated guide their purchasing decisions. Every product visual should tell a story instead of simply showing the product.

Professional product photographers use advanced equipment and techniques, producing higher image quality. They use high-end cameras with versatile lenses, enabling sharpness and detail that standard equipment often can‚Äôt capture. Experienced photographers understand how to use techniques like depth of field, macro shots, and optimal angles to create visually engaging images that tell a story. This combination of professional-grade equipment and refined techniques results in photos that stand out, conveying a level of quality that is difficult to achieve with basic or DIY setups.

¬†

The difference in post-processing and editing between professional and DIY photography is truly worlds apart. Professional photographers work together with graphics designers that have mastery over advanced editing tools like Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, allowing them to perfect every detail and create a polished, cohesive look across all images. They often adjust colors for accuracy, enhance lighting and shadows, removing product imperfections. In contrast, DIY edits often rely on simpler apps or limited knowledge, resulting in images that may lack consistency, refinement, and the impactful quality needed to capture a customer‚Äôs attention.

Time and efficiency are key advantages that professional product photographers bring to the table. With years of experience, they can quickly set up, shoot, and edit photos with a streamlined approach that ensures high-quality results in a fraction of the time it might take for someone to do it themselves. They know exactly which angles, lighting setups, and techniques will work best for each product, reducing the need for trial and error. DIY photography can be time-consuming, often involving extended periods of experimentation and editing to achieve even basic results. In business, time is money, and the efficiency of a professional photographer can save you both in the long run.

So I‚Äôm looking to make the leap from my current soundbar setup to a proper 5.1.2 home theatre system. Below is a quick rundown of what I currently have, what I watch/listen to, and what I‚Äôm prioritising in this upgrade.

Current Setup:

I project a diagonal length of 360cm. HDR10 support.
I have a 3mx4m shaggy rug on the floor, and 2 shaggy rugs on the wall opposing the viewing wall and to the left. The seating area has an L-sofa, there's a bookshelf, a vitrine, a coffee table, a lowboard, 2 rocking chairs and cinema-like thick blackout curtains. So acoustically, it is quite well treated. There's basically no echo. Oh, and the corners have foam bass-traps that I repurposed from discaaded lab foam packing material.

Soundbar: I‚Äôm currently using a 5.1 virtual atmos enabled soundbar. It‚Äôs been great for its simplicity, and I‚Äôve enjoyed the immersion (loving it when I catch myself looking behind me above me etc, enveloping and moving buzzing of bees etc). But I think its time to upgrade to a real setup!

What I Watch & Listen To:

Movies: I love cinema and watch films from all over the world and across all decades. Immersive sound really enhances these experiences for me, but of course in a lot of movies, dialogue is a huge priority.

Music: My taste in music is pretty diverse. I listen to a mix of classic rock, blues, orchestral soundtracks, jazz, and Indian classical and contemporary music‚Äîincluding ghazals, and indian film music of the past decades. I‚Äôm looking for a setup that can handle both deep, punchy bass and intricate instrumental sounds, but on a budget!

Priorities: I‚Äôm definitely not an analytical audiophile‚ÄîI don‚Äôt need to hear the breaths between each note or the minutiae of every high-frequency detail. I prioritse a wide sound-stage, immersive, room-filling sound that makes me feel like I‚Äôm part of the movie or fully surrounded by the music at an orchestra! So essentially, a good balance between cinema-like power and musical enjoyment is what I‚Äôm after.

AVR Choices:

I‚Äôm currently deciding between two AVRs, and I‚Äôm open to hearing your thoughts on them, particularly how they might match up with my speaker options below:

    Marantz SR6015: 749 ‚Ç¨
    Denon X3800H: 889 ‚Ç¨ 

They're either Ausstellungsst√ºck or Retourenware/B-Ware (exhibition piece or retunred due to opened package, or before 14 days etc). So, kinda new.

Speaker Setup Options (5.1.2):

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm lost, since I don't have any experience. I also live in an old German University town where there aren't many HiFi shops with a broad-range of offers to go and listen to. So I can only go by what i read online on various fora. 

I‚Äôve been looking at the following potential configurations. I‚Äôd appreciate any advice or insights on which might suit my needs best.

1g76h2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/1g76h2r/upgrading_from_a_soundbar_to_a_proper_512avr_and/,Upgrading from a Soundbar to a Proper 5.1.2‚ÄîAVR and Speaker Recommendations Needed!,"Hey everyone! 
So I‚Äôm looking to make the leap from my current soundbar setup to a proper 5.1.2 home theatre system. Below is a quick rundown of what I currently have, what I watch/listen to, and what I‚Äôm prioritising in this upgrade.

Current Setup:

I project a diagonal length of 360cm. HDR10 support.
I have a 3mx4m shaggy rug on the floor, and 2 shaggy rugs on the wall opposing the viewing wall and to the left. The seating area has an L-sofa, there's a bookshelf, a vitrine, a coffee table, a lowboard, 2 rocking chairs and cinema-like thick blackout curtains. So acoustically, it is quite well treated. There's basically no echo. Oh, and the corners have foam bass-traps that I repurposed from discaaded lab foam packing material.

Soundbar: I‚Äôm currently using a 5.1 virtual atmos enabled soundbar. It‚Äôs been great for its simplicity, and I‚Äôve enjoyed the immersion (loving it when I catch myself looking behind me above me etc, enveloping and moving buzzing of bees etc). But I think its time to upgrade to a real setup!

What I Watch & Listen To:

Movies: I love cinema and watch films from all over the world and across all decades. Immersive sound really enhances these experiences for me, but of course in a lot of movies, dialogue is a huge priority.

Music: My taste in music is pretty diverse. I listen to a mix of classic rock, blues, orchestral soundtracks, jazz, and Indian classical and contemporary music‚Äîincluding ghazals, and indian film music of the past decades. I‚Äôm looking for a setup that can handle both deep, punchy bass and intricate instrumental sounds, but on a budget!

Priorities: I‚Äôm definitely not an analytical audiophile‚ÄîI don‚Äôt need to hear the breaths between each note or the minutiae of every high-frequency detail. I prioritse a wide sound-stage, immersive, room-filling sound that makes me feel like I‚Äôm part of the movie or fully surrounded by the music at an orchestra! So essentially, a good balance between cinema-like power and musical enjoyment is what I‚Äôm after.

AVR Choices:

I‚Äôm currently deciding between two AVRs, and I‚Äôm open to hearing your thoughts on them, particularly how they might match up with my speaker options below:

    Marantz SR6015: 749 ‚Ç¨
    Denon X3800H: 889 ‚Ç¨ 

They're either Ausstellungsst√ºck or Retourenware/B-Ware (exhibition piece or retunred due to opened package, or before 14 days etc). So, kinda new.

Speaker Setup Options (5.1.2):

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm lost, since I don't have any experience. I also live in an old German University town where there aren't many HiFi shops with a broad-range of offers to go and listen to. So I can only go by what i read online on various fora. 

I‚Äôve been looking at the following potential configurations. I‚Äôd appreciate any advice or insights on which might suit my needs best.

The Benefits of Living in a Two-Storey Home with a Balcony
----------------------------------------------------------

Living in a two-storey home with a balcony offers a unique blend of comfort, style, and functionality. As many families seek a balance between indoor and outdoor spaces, such designs have become increasingly popular. With multiple advantages, these homes can cater to various lifestyle needs. Here are some key benefits that make two-storey houses with balconies highly desirable.

### Spacious Living

One of the significant benefits of a two-storey house is the ample living space it provides. By spreading your living area vertically, you can maximize your square footage.

### Increased Privacy

Having a two-storey layout enhances privacy within your home. The upstairs can be an ideal zone for bedrooms, away from the noise of the main living areas. A balcony offers a secluded outdoor retreat, providing a perfect escape when you want to enjoy a cup of coffee or read a good book without distractions.

### Enhanced Outdoor Living Space

A balcony expands your living space outdoors. It allows you to enjoy fresh air, scenic views, and the beauty of nature right from your home. Here are some points to consider:

Check Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/2-storey-house-designs-with-balcony  
  
- **Relaxation Zone:** Use your balcony as a space to unwind or entertain guests. Adding comfortable seating can create a cozy atmosphere.
- **Gardening Opportunities:** Small planters and pots can turn your balcony into a garden oasis, making it a lovely spot for planting herbs or flowers.
- **Entertaining Guests:** Host gatherings, cookouts, or barbecues with friends and family on your balcony, adding a delightful outdoor experience.

### Natural Light and Views

Two-storey homes usually benefit from greater exposure to natural light. Large windows on both levels can fill your space with warmth. The balcony can also serve as an observation deck, offering impressive views of your neighborhood or surrounding landscape. It provides a lovely space to watch sunsets, stargaze at night, or enjoy rainy days from a sheltered spot.

### Customization and Design

When it comes to two-storey house designs with balconies, there‚Äôs a wealth of customization options. From the shape and style of the balcony to the materials and colors used, homeowners can personalize every detail. You can choose from:

- **Eco-Friendly Solutions:** Incorporate green materials and energy-efficient technologies to lower energy costs.

### Increased Home Value

Investing in a two-storey home with a balcony can significantly increase your property‚Äôs market value. These homes often stand out to potential buyers due to their aesthetic appeal, versatility, and extra space. A well-designed balcony can make your home more attractive, helping it retain or appreciate its value over time.

### Ideal for Growing Families

If you have a growing family, a two-storey layout can accommodate your needs efficiently. As children grow, having distinct spaces for play, study, and sleeping becomes essential. The upstairs area can be transformed into a family oasis filled with bedrooms, while the first floor can remain for common areas. This setup allows for easy supervision while maintaining a sense of independence for older children.

### Connection with Nature

Living in a two-storey home with a balcony encourages a lifestyle that embraces the outdoors while respecting privacy. With the balcony serving as an intermediary between inside and outside, it offers a unique way to connect with nature. Morning coffee or evening tea can be enjoyed in the serenity of sunlight and fresh air.

In this increasingly urbanized world, incorporating outdoor living spaces within your home‚Äôs design is important. A two-storey house with a balcony can offer the perfect blend of indoor comfort and outdoor enjoyment. The allure of spacious living, privacy, customization options, and connection to nature is compelling. You can create a beautiful, functional space that genuinely feels like home.

But the problem is for me is that my boyfriend‚Äôs sisters are really strict and really have a strong personality. I‚Äôm really REALLY scared of them and I really care how they look at me because I want to give them a good impression of me. I‚Äôm starting to think that his sisters are starting to hate me and I keep overthinking this type of stuffs and it keeps me awake at night. Me and my boyfriend has only been dating for a week and yet the 4th day of me and him dating has left me overwhelmed because of what his sisters think of me. The start of why I think about this is because me and my boyfriend went out to hang out with my friends to go to the church and I asked him if he can pick me up from my house because I can‚Äôt come if I don‚Äôt and he agreed and his sister was cool with it but then we had plans afterwards and that was to go a near by park near the church. The original plan was to go somewhere more near the church but was changed and so we went to the park. It‚Äôs was getting late since it was almost 7pm. My boyfriend asked for my phone so that he can text his sister and then after minutes he had texted his sister, his sister was really blowing my phone when I got home. My boyfriend also chatted his other sister on my phone and I really feel like she was mad at me for letting him stay out let at night because of me. She didn‚Äôt really seen my text again after I texted that my boyfriend was otw back to their house. The second time was when I was really obsessed with coffee and I often ran out of coffee because I always drink one everyday. My boyfriend buys me coffee whenever we were at school and he would give it to me when it was lunch time. Then later I found out that he didn‚Äôt really have the money to pay those coffee so he owed his aunt (his aunt owns the store that he brought it from) money. Then his sister found out and I started to get worried because wouldn‚Äôt this is seem like his sister would hate me? I know these things are little things but sometimes little things eventually can become big when given enough time. So I thought of maybe just breaking up with the poor guy so that he wouldn‚Äôt do these things anymore. Can you guys tell me if I‚Äôm overthinking it or not?",1,1729335138.0,helpme,0,1.0,False

**Energy Consumption**: None

**Threat Level**: 1

**Summary**:

Have you ever wondered if Saiki could survive with coffee jelly? The answer is yes.

This is because Saiki's powers made his metabolism capable of extracting every possible nutrient from whatever Saiki eats: energy, emotions, thoughts, nuclear waste, are just Saiki's possible daily meals.

However, this has caused Saiki's palate to deteriorate towards human cuisine. So for Saiki it is the same for him to eat a piece of gold or his mother's food.

* The coffee jelly still has flavor for Saiki.

I kinda hate the concept of family in general tbh & I think it's because I was unlucky & put with the most NT Squidward Tentacles ass ppl in the world. actually my mom & dad aren't the worst, I know they like me at least a little bit, but most of my aunts & uncles SUCK. & I just HAD to be Native American which means anyone within a 5 mile radius is my ""aunt"" or ""uncle"" 

they don't understand the fact that not everything that I say or do has a double meaning. they'll sit there & ask me 99 questions about whatever it was that I said, & I have to sit there & say some shit like ""actually I said [xyz]"" 99 times back. then, when they run out of words to put in my mouth, they're either so confused or so shocked, as if I hadn't spent the last 10 minutes trying to reiterate my point like a broken record

& the loud whisper thing drives me fucking crazy. my parents do this a lot, & I guess I don't know if my other family members do this or not because I don't spend as much time with them nor do I pay enough attention to them to notice. but, my parents will ""loudly whisper"" (it's like a slightly quieter talking voice) obscenities about me. sometimes they act like it hasn't happened at all, but sometimes they (mostly my mom honestly) will explode & double down. &, my parents like have their own issues I think. my dad at the very least I think has BPD, & my mom I think has a lot of issues. I wouldn't know because neither of them ever go to the doctor that often. like they'll say something like ""fucking bitch..!"" when I'm still around, & I will sometimes ignore it, but sometimes I question it. I'll say ""what did you say?"" & most of the time they act like they haven't said anything but sometimes they do hit me with the loud asf ""YOU'RE SUCH A BITCH!!!!!!""

& most of the time it's over the dumbest thing in the world. right now my dad is mad at me because I haven't yet 'drank enough' of the diet soda that he bought for me/us yet (which he bought yesterday mind you) . I've had 1 so far. & I heard him yelling like ""what a fucking bitch, wasting soda I bought, too good to drink diet coke !"" & he's doing the thing where it's just like at talking voice & it's not yelling & it's so annoying. I don't feel like confronting him it's like 3:00 AM & honestly seething in private over it is far less stressful than causing an argument that goes on for like a week but it's also less satisfying. they think that I'm like them. idk why NTs just bottle everything up & let it explode. & yeah I guess I'm kinda exploding right now but I'm not talking out loud & trying to gaslight the people that hear it. I think my dad & I would both be in better moods if he could just be like ""hey, it actually upsets me that you haven't had enough diet coke to drink"" in a calm way. it's not normal to see that & immediately think 'my bitch child wants to watch me suffer & wants me to go into crippling debt' . no, I simply just had a lot of water & coffee today & yesterday, & I didn't have the urge to drink more diet coke. heaven forbid. but go ahead call me a bitch & gaslight me",11,1729334452.0,evilautism,2,0.92,False

So I'm 21M, a university student. I have a huge crush on my classmate. And have already told her but she has said she doesn't like relationship stuff (I belong to Pakistan, a rather conservative society where relationships before marriage are not considered good let alone physical relationships). She is quite introvert and seems of good character. So I was quite heartbroken but I try doing different antics to impress her but she just laughs them off(not irritated) She has a very good male friend (another classmate) , who is tall+attractive. I always suspected that they both are together but he is in a relationship with some other girl and she doesn't go out with boys alone.  
  
Now the main story is. 2 days ago, when our classes ended for the day, I saw them sitting in her car together and I got jealous AF so I put my scooty after them at a safe distance. They stopped outside some small house and went inside the gate. Now you can imagine my fury. I parked some yards away, and waited for a few minutes then climbed the wall.. I wanted to get inside the house at any cost, so I devised a quick plan and knocked on door. Till he came outside to check, I went to the back and hid there. He went back inside and then I knocked again and this time both of them scared and furious came outside and tried to check everywhere, leaving the main door open. I slowly slowly crawled away from wherever they were checking and when both of them were in backyard, I went inside the door. It was one bhk home, so I went quickly inside the only room and hid myself in the cupboard. They both came back and were in the living room. He was playfully teasing her. And she was saying that why he was with that other girl and didn't recognized her love earlier. Both were talking very sensually. (imagine my fury). Then she told him to be gentle as it was her first time and he said that he bet she wouldn't be able to walk on her legs afterwards. (imagine my fury). Then she asked him to wait there and she came to the room. She wore a very se#y make up and a sizzling bikini, and then asked him to come to the room. Then what i saw i couldnt believe my eyes, that she is the same naive girl. She danced for him on a really sensual song, and was literally behaving like a wh@re. I peeked in from the cupboard all the time and boy oh boy. For the next 4 hrs, he literally busted every hole that she had in multiple positions and not once gently, and she was enjoying it AF. She kept moaning and screaming loudly and he kept banging her from left, right and centre. Especially when they were trying the ""other hole"", she literally bled. And even then he pounded her in that hole one more time. On the bed, on the couch, leaning on wall from behind.. in missionary, in doggy,.. THEY TRIED EACH FUC\*ING THING...she even jokingly said to him ""forget walking, i wont be able to sit properly for weeks now""...thats the level of pounding she had recieved....  
  
I was like where the F did that introvert and shy girl has gone whom I loved. I used to be very respectful and gentle around her but during all this episode he wasn't once gentle with her and even slapped her hard when she was blowing him. So after all this (4 hrs had passed), they both went to the attached bathroom and she was literally not able to walk properly. After a minute or two, her moans started again. Here I was in the cupboard, with teary eyes and a huge boner. I quietly came outside and sneaked outside the main door and then climbed the wall again and got home. All the night I was having the worst wet dreams of my life involving both of them. Yesterday in the class, both of them arrived separately as usual and were behaving like nothing had happened. She was still not able to walk properly. She was with her female friends, and I was feeling the very urge to talk to her. So I asked her for notes and she gave me those. I couldn't control myself and asked if she would like a coffee in the Cafe and she smiled and said that I've told you earlier, I don't go out with boys alone. I kept quite.. But wtf bro... Tell me straight away that you don't like me rather not wanting a relationship with anyone.  
  
I don't know if I'm horny, sad or heartbroken since 2 days. Probably a mixture of all feelings. This event has probably given me a trauma for whole life... I can't even eat or sleep properly... She was the only girl whom I had ever loved in my life... Does this happen with all nice guys??,

During the week, when he (38) has to get up for work the next day, he doesn't go to bed early enough. The next morning, he snoozes his alarm for over an hour before getting out of bed. He is annoyed at himself for being at the office later than he wants to be... once again. Not to mention that I (F29) can't sleep ‚Äúthe last hour‚Äù whenever I'm at his place because his alarm goes off every 10 minutes. 

2. We have an LDR and call each other every morning. What used to be a fun and beautiful start to my day quickly turned into pure annoyance. He's pleading with me to let him sleep ten more minutes‚Ä¶ to call him again in ten minutes etc. I‚Äôm not his mum; he's a grown man. I find it ridiculous that an adult cannot find the discipline to get out of bed. (I know. I should stop calling him in the mornings.)

3. he takes forever to get ready when he's finally up. On bad days, it takes him two hours to get up to leave the house. What is he doing? I don't know. He showers for 30 minutes and takes long coffee breaks between the things he has to do to get ready. 

4. The weekends. He gets up around ten when I'm at his place, which is fair. However, when I'm not around, I can't reach him until noon‚Ä¶ at least. Because‚Ä¶ he is sleeping. It wouldn't bother me if he didn't complain that he didn't get anything done on the weekend. If you have important things to do, you have to get up, even on the weekends. Or you're fine with not getting things done and sleep in.

My first year of college I had a pretty intense crush on a guy in my dorm. During that time I had trouble not thinking about him constantly. Almost intrusively as he would come to mind even when I wasn‚Äôt thinking about him or didnt realize it. Between fall and spring semesters I managed to butt dial him over social media (snapchat) when he wasn‚Äôt even someone recent or high up in my messages list 

A few years later he would show up on a dating app (hinge) in his senior / my junior year of college. His 3 prompts were the same as mine, same question exact same answers. For all 3 prompts. I deleted the app that afternoon because I didnt want him to think I changed my answers to be like his because they weren‚Äôt similar they were exactly the same.

That same junior year another guy who had stuck out to me a bit on a dating app (bumble) but it never really went anywhere, one instance I run into him directly one night at my off campus apartment. MY campus is pretty big so it can be weird running into each other late at night in an apartment off campus but that‚Äôs not the big one. I decided to text some unsaved numbers in my phone and he happened to be one of them. I went through texting them out of pure boredom (and loneliness) one night (maybe I was trying to find an old sneaky link I really dont know) Apparently we had spoken a little earlier in the semester before matching on bumble about possibly living in a house together the next year. This was weird because I didn‚Äôt like him like him. But after matching he had been in my brain for a few days. Doesn‚Äôt happen with everyone. 


Finally this past summer I got into a situation where I liked a guy I was hooking up with and he wasn‚Äôt really feeling the same. I moved two a different city for a summer job opportunity and knew I would only be there for a few months.. at this point it had been some time that I hadn‚Äôt been anxious or depressed. He did like me at some point ands he admitted this but i believe he felt I was too soon in asking to see him more often. He lost interest or got scared but He didnt tell me this outright and  instead told me someone in his family had passed and he would be out of town. I didnt know wether to believe this to be true because on one hadn‚Äôt telling someone who likes u that this awful thing happened to you seems like it would just make them continue to be concerned for you. On another hand people can be messed up. When the day came to move out of my summer apartment and drive back to my home state, I had taken much longer to pack up my things, I also stopped to get coffee and then had to pull over again to write an emergency email in the car. After writing that email I turned onto the next block and as I was driving down this block I looked over and he was walking up the block. Throughout the whole summer of living less then 10 blocks away from him and hoping I‚Äôd run into himI see him by chance right as im about to leave. 

Now I move back to my college for my 5th year to find that a boy I had started having a little crush on last semester is best friends with my random roommate and now I see him constantly. Theres there‚Äôs 5 major off campus apartment complexes near my campus so for his best friend to be my direct roommate is crazy as I was just experiencing my first crush in a while on this guy. We spoke a little over instagram dm over something school related but I was too nervous to do any more then say hi in person. 

A few more things about me, I dont subscribe to the matrix or simulation theory simply because thinking about it would add more stress to my life. I grew up christian but have a complicated relationship with religion but I do believe in god I just dont know what I truly believe about him. I would love to hear your take.

I asked my mom to go home and upon arrival had found that a sick family member had passed which led me to believe he passed at the same moment I was filled with what I didnt know at the time was some form of dread.

Hi,
Am searching for my kindred spirits.
I find myself in an emotionally challenging situation atm and feel very lonely. I'm shy irl, I do have friends but they're few and are far away. I need kind, empathetic friends to talk to and not feel quite as lonely. 


When I'm not working, I'm mostly on my phone and am very responsive. Can talk about anything, life, experiences, interests, dreams. I open up fairly quickly so will have no trouble talking. All I want is to have constant companionship, friendship and support. I have a vibrant little world inside my head but in real life, I'm quite shy only until I start to get to know someone, after that, I'm a chatterbox.  I'm happy to talk about anything. Someone closer to me would be better but I'm happy to talk to anyone. I just need a kind friend to share my life with. I'm fascinated by different ways of life and currently, I'm looking for people closer to me, in England/Europe to diversify my social circle. 


I have used this sub before and found my very close friend on this sub and I'm looking forward to finding my community through this sub again. It is a good humbling experience talking to new people, understanding their diverse lives and sharing a snippet of our own. Life can be lonely but a positive mindset dictates that love and friendship is abundant and it is quite possible to find it if we keep looking in the right places. I never would've thought I'd find my kindred spirit but I did and I'm so happy but am on a quest to find more! I have a few kindred spirits in my 24 years of being alive and I'm sure, there are many others out there. 



For reference, I love reading, am a bookworm, journaling, going for walks, learning languages, passionate about coffees, learning new things, talking to people and nature. I love dogs, flowers, sunshine, old people, babies and anything that melts my heart. I've been told that I'm quite smiley with a happy face and I always try to make others around me feel warm and comfortable, I'm like a caring mum or a nan which also can be annoying to some. I'm emotionally quite aware and always I always analyse what I'm feeling and why. That's why I love writing in my diary too.  I'm also quite insecure in real life, self conscious and have self esteem issues but I'm working on them so if you're looking for someone quite perfect, please scroll down! That's a glimpse of my quiet little life, if you're interested, there's so much more, ordinary stories, chuckles from everyday life that I can share because something or the other keeps happening to me everyday haha. 


I'm a bit weird, nerdy, very plain looking but I try to be kind and I have a lot of warmth to give in a friendship so if you're up for it, shoot me a dm x

Main use will be espresso and pour over with occasional milk drinks for light-medium roast, prefering naturals/washed ethiopians.

For the machine we are set on the Lelit MaraX, for the grinder we already have a Fellow Ode 2. With the release of the new Mazzers Philos it made me rethink my original choice of the combination Ode 2 + DF64 v2.

To summarize, what would be the best setup for pour over and espresso?
- Ode 2 + DF64 v2
- Mazzers Philos with I200D burrs (sell Ode 2)

1g75zd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1g75zd6/experiencing_so_many_coincidences_that_dont_feel/,Experiencing so many coincidences that don't feel like coincidences ,"I brought it up to a friend recently that there are a ton of coincidences that occur to me‚Ä¶ I will say I dont really call these synchronicities because they happen more so externally then in my brain. I also apologize for any typos I‚Äôm off very little sleep but this has been bugging me especially the more recent ones.

My first year of college I had a pretty intense crush on a guy in my dorm. During that time I had trouble not thinking about him constantly. Almost intrusively as he would come to mind even when I wasn‚Äôt thinking about him or didnt realize it. Between fall and spring semesters I managed to butt dial him over social media (snapchat) when he wasn‚Äôt even someone recent or high up in my messages list 

A few years later he would show up on a dating app (hinge) in his senior / my junior year of college. His 3 prompts were the same as mine, same question exact same answers. For all 3 prompts. I deleted the app that afternoon because I didnt want him to think I changed my answers to be like his because they weren‚Äôt similar they were exactly the same.

That same junior year another guy who had stuck out to me a bit on a dating app (bumble) but it never really went anywhere, one instance I run into him directly one night at my off campus apartment. MY campus is pretty big so it can be weird running into each other late at night in an apartment off campus but that‚Äôs not the big one. I decided to text some unsaved numbers in my phone and he happened to be one of them. I went through texting them out of pure boredom (and loneliness) one night (maybe I was trying to find an old sneaky link I really dont know) Apparently we had spoken a little earlier in the semester before matching on bumble about possibly living in a house together the next year. This was weird because I didn‚Äôt like him like him. But after matching he had been in my brain for a few days. Doesn‚Äôt happen with everyone. 


Finally this past summer I got into a situation where I liked a guy I was hooking up with and he wasn‚Äôt really feeling the same. I moved two a different city for a summer job opportunity and knew I would only be there for a few months. He did like me at some point ands he admitted this but i believe he felt I was too soon in asking to see him more often. He lost interest or got scared but He didnt tell me this outright and  instead told me someone in his family had passed and he would be out of town. I didnt know wether to believe this to be true because on one hadn‚Äôt telling someone who likes u that this awful thing happened to you seems like it would just make them continue to be concerned for you. On another hand people can be messed up. When the day came to move out of my summer apartment and drive back to my home state, I had taken much longer to pack up my things, I also stopped to get coffee and then had to pull over again to write an emergency email in the car. After writing that email I turned onto the next block and as I was driving down this block I looked over and he was walking up the block. Throughout the whole summer of living less then 10 blocks away from him and hoping I‚Äôd run into himI see him by chance right as im about to leave.

I am devastated, I set a box of chocolates on the edge and barely leaned on it to stand up and a huge chunk crumbled off. I‚Äôve had this table for 7 years, it originally had a bronze band trim on the edge (it came loose 1 year ago and we ended up removing it and scraped the remaining adhesive off thereafter) Did this have anything to do with it crumbling now or is this material just of a sensitive nature?

Can I possibly scrap together the remnants and have it glued and rehoned or am I completely fucked? Do I just need to replace the whole thing and how much would that cost? 

Can anyone pinpoint what kind of marble this is exactly? It‚Äôs a dark grey finish with brown marbling. Was made from Lawson & fenning but I can‚Äôt find the finish anymore on their website. ",6,1729333602.0,fixit,13,0.81,False

Yes, these are all the things I didn't say to the person that just hit my car with their car door. So now I'm ranting on here.
