We were just laying there talking about nerd stuff (board games, card tournaments, etc) and in walks an ex girlfriend of mine who sees us and is criticizing us and saying how my wife and I don’t need to be fawning all over each other in public. 

The conversation continues and then the ex girlfriend leaves but before she leaves she wants a hug so I reach in for one of those side hug things, and she responds by hugging me with both arms, nuzzling my neck, and making my wife and I very uncomfortable.

The ex leaves and I have the sudden urge to pee. So, I go to bathroom in the game store and the bathroom is in the middle of being remodeled. There’s no walls, just an old shower curtain and some tarp for privacy and weirdly enough the door lock is broken. I go into the “bathroom” which is right next to where a MTG tournament is going on and I can hear everything and they can also hear me as well.

One of the guys who is in the tournament is a cop dressed in full uniform. I’m standing there trying to pee and when the stream starts, I’m peeing blood, and I can’t aim properly for whatever reason so I just start peeing blood on the toilet, around the toilet, the floor, trashcan, everywhere. The cop actually opens the shower curtain and ask me why I’m peeing blood but by the tone in his voice I can tell he doesn’t really care he’s just worried that I made a mess. So I just told him I had kidney stones (which was a lie, I actually had no idea why I was peeing blood but for some reason I thought it was safer to give him an explanation). Just then I jolted awake.

Overall, my recovery has been smooth. I was of course sore around my incision sites, my partner helped me sit up/stand up, and I had to walk really slowly for 5 days. I felt every step. I could lay on my side comfortably around 6-7 days post op, and as a belly sleeper, I could finally lay on my belly around day 10.

The gas pain was really uncomfortable, no one here is exaggerating :D It lasted for maybe 4 days overall, however, it was only bad around the collarbones and especially as I leaned/reclined back more. Felt like someone was pushing a finger with all their strength into the hollow where my collarbone meets my shoulder.

I had no issue passing gas, nor going to the toiler and did not need to take stool softeners or laxatives. Instead, I opted for warm tea or very weak coffee in the morning. I also walked around every hour or so. Not long distance, but I just kept moving.

I started taking supplements immediately after coming home from the hospital (which was 1 day post-op for me), especially zinc, which is supposed to help with recovery. 

I also started taking cough drops immediately after the nurse cleared me for it after surgery to help the post-intubation sore throat and avoid coughing. However, I did cough quite a lot anyway. That was uncomfortable, but I tried my best to stabilize my belly.

I had no vaginal bleeding after my surgery.

I had normal stitches, which were taken out 7 days post-op. I had them covered in gauze and second-skin like foil (like for tattoos). I was instructed to not remove those. Then they took out the stitches after a week, that was pretty uncomfortable as well. I had bruising, and they have to pull up the stitch to cut it.... Yeah. I cringe just remembering that. The belly button was the worst. I would not say it was painful, but veeery uncomfy.

I could finally wash the wounds in the evening and was told I could gently wash it with chamomile tea. Of course the sites have to be kept dry, I'd let them air out before bed and pulled up my shirt throughout the day. 

While the wounds looked angry for a few days, and I was pretty scared of infection, all was well. I only have small scabs now and only my right side is still a little bruised. I am scheduled for a visit with my gyno next week.

TMI, but I was horny and tried masturbating (only externally) 10 days post-op. There was no pain, but many warn against this. I was very careful and if anything started hurting I would have stopped immediately. So if you try yourself, listen to your body.

I work from home, so I only took 2 days off and then worked half-days Thu-Fri. However, I would recommend taking at least a week of if you can.

Started Adderall and it helped immensely. Mind went from busy city street to quiet coffee house w/ 2 folks chatting. Literally saved me with my work. 

1.5 months ago, I started hormone replacement therapy.

Is it possible my perimenopausal decrease in estrogen (which is a focusing hormone) caused all my issues, and that now that it’s back in my system, maybe I don’t need adderall?

After the disappointment of running triple Mclaren and have more points on my Costa Card than in my fantasy team, we arrive in the final sprint of the season. 

Qatar is one of those weekends that flips the Fantasy board on its head. A Sprint. A 25-lap mileage limit across *every* slick tyre. A left-front killer of a circuit. And a grid walking in with championship pressure on all three title contenders.

Here’s the simple version for Fantasy managers.

**• Mileage cap changes everything**  
Every slick set is capped at 25 laps. FP1, Sprint Quali, Sprint and the Grand Prix all count toward that total. There’s no room for long-run padding or burning tyres just to chase track evolution. Anyone who wastes mileage on Friday is compromised by Sunday.

**• Guaranteed multi-stop**  
Lusail already forces teams toward two-stop territory. The cap makes it a certainty. Medium becomes the race tyre. Hard becomes the anchor. Soft is a short tool. This brings strategy-driven risers into play.

**• McLaren might have to raise the ride height**  
The double DSQ in Vegas puts them under the microscope. If they lift the car, they lose their edge. That affects both qualifying pace and stint length. It’s relevant for anyone stacked with Norris/Piastri.

**• Verstappen walks in level on points and in form**  
 RB21 suits clear-load circuits. He’s the safest ceiling pick on the board and has improved 

**• Mercedes are the quiet threat**  
Lusail rewards restraint, and Russell/Antonelli fit that profile. Clean Sprint, clean Sunday, points on both days. Questions over engines in hot weather but in form.

**• Ferrari steady, not spectacular**  
Predictable temps help. Mileage discipline helps. They’re not boom-or-bust picks here and have been struggling.

**• Williams & Racing Bulls = value**  
Both manage mileage well. Both qualify well at medium-load tracks. If Saturday turns messy, they rise.

Throughout the week I’ll be posting the full breakdowns on Coffee Corner Motorsport — tyre allocations left per driver, compound availability for the Sprint and Grand Prix, and official notes as Pirelli send them through. If you want the deeper numbers, it’ll all be there. Let me know if you want them here as well. 

Good luck with your picks this week. Lusail tends to expose anyone who hasn’t done their homework.

1p5fjuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepThoughts/comments/1p5fjuj/we_chose_comfort_over_community_now_were_paying/,We chose comfort over community. Now we're paying for it.,"Even when I grew up in the Netherlands in the 90's and early 2000's it already felt my grandparents talked about a different world they lived through during the 50's until the 80's.

Neighbors walked into each other's homes for coffee (used the backdoor, which was always open and unlocked). When a mother in the village died, the families living next door all adopted a kid. They just did it. When a farmer went almost bankrupt, the entire village helped out financially. People helped because they felt *obligated* to their community.

Somehow, I feel that this sense of community is completely gone now. Not only in the Netherlands, but more widely in the West, especially in urban areas (am I right?). Parents raise kids alone. If businesses struggle they just go bankrupt. Elders die in institutions. We pay strangers for everything that used to come from community: childcare, therapy, someone to talk to, feeling like you belong. 

Something just feels rotten in modern society. And I believe (please correct me if I am wrong) almost everyone can feel it too. 

I believe there is a decay of social fabric that has happened since the second world war.

This decay didn't happen slowly. We chose it. At every moment, we picked what felt easier right then. Not because we're bad people. Because a strong sense of community requires us to do things that feel slightly uncomfortable, and we simply prefer or chose not to:

* **Showing up uninvited feels intrusive.** It's easier to text ""let me know if you need anything"" (knowing they won't ask) than to actually show up with soup.
* **Asking for help feels like being a burden.** It's easier to hire a babysitter than ask the neighbor (what if they feel obligated? what if they say no? what if I owe them?).
* **Showing feelings feels vulnerable.** It's easier to talk about struggles with a therapist than with neighbours who you might see again.
* **Being watched feels judgmental.** It's easier to parent alone than have other adults watching your kids (and judging your choices).

My grandparents didn't have these options. The backdoor was unlocked. Neighbours watched your kids. People just walked in and out. You couldn't opt out without the whole street noticing.

**Was that oppressive? Maybe.**   
**Was it uncomfortable? Without doubt.**

But it also meant nobody ate dinner alone. Nobody died without being found for weeks. Nobody raised kids without help. My grandparents even talked about the fact that things like depression barely existed (accepting that diagnosing was also more difficult, but the same has been proven for diseases like cancer).

In the meantime we chose freedom from effort and got loneliness instead.

For most of human history, communities were not optional. You belonged because you were born into it. Extended family, neighbors, shared rituals, shared responsibilities, yet in modern society it feels optional. I think technology doesn't help. Because I can still feel I am helping but not put the real effort (i.e. text vs. soup).

Humans are inherently social creatures, but also try to get out of anything that requires effort, even if that leads to long term decay (same problem with burning fossil fuels; short term ease > human preservation).

We collectively decided that social control was oppressive. We celebrated independence as the ultimate virtue: ""You do you."" ""I don't owe anyone anything."" ""Mind your own business.""

Walk around any Western city now and see what this has gotten us: people won't give up seats for the elderly. Everyone avoids eye contact on trains. People step over homeless people. Parents hover at parks because they don't trust anyone else with their kids.

Not because people are bad. I believe very few are. But because the unspoken norms of collective responsibility vanished. Our social fabric has completely decayed.

Our grandparents weren't better people. They just lived inside a system that made helping each other normal. And now we're shocked that we're lonely and mentally sick. Can you have real community where social commitment is optional? Where people only help ""when they feel like it""?

I don't think so. I think it requires short term sacrifices to reap the long term reward.

Real community requires:

* Seeing the same faces every week for *years*
* Showing up even when you're busy or tired
* Your contributions being visible (and your absence noticed)
* Standards (free-riders destroy everything)
* Actual obligation, not just good vibes

Obligation is the part modern people hate, but it is not the same as oppression. It's the price of belonging. The ""freedom"" to disengage whenever you want isn't freedom. It's just isolation pretending to be independence.

When I look at the loneliness epidemic, the mental health crisis among young people, parents drowning, elders dying alone... I can't help but wonder what life would look like if we all decided to do more for each other. I think the world would be a much, much better place. What if the social fabric was strong and people prioritized the long term health of the community over themselves?

What if we just... did the awkward thing? Showed up uninvited. Asked for help. Let neighbors see our mess. Accepted the obligation. What if the problem isn't that we don't know how to fix this? What if the problem is that we do know, and we're just not willing to be uncomfortable?

Maybe the real work of this century isn't inventing new technology.  
Maybe it's rebuilding the social structures we accidentally destroyed.

1p5fjpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedInMan/comments/1p5fjpj/focus_isnt_a_skill_its_a_dopamine_game_and_youre/,"Focus isn’t a skill, it’s a dopamine game (and you’re probably losing)","Everyone talks about focus like it’s some stoic discipline you can brute-force. Like if you just plug your phone in the other room and drink black coffee, suddenly you’ll enter monk mode and write 2,000 words or finally open that Excel sheet. But that’s not how it works. Most people around me, especially in high-pressure knowledge jobs, aren’t lazy. They’re operating with fried dopamine systems.

This post is for anyone who beats themselves up for being ""lazy"" or ""unmotivated"". It pulls together what neuroscience, behavior science, and elite performance research actually say about why focus feels so impossible today. Not the garbage you see in TikToks telling you to wake up at 5 am and take cold showers for hustle culture points.  

The truth? Focus isn’t willpower. It’s chemistry. And the good news is, you can \*train\* it. Here’s what actually works, backed by research from Stanford, Huberman Lab, Cal Newport, Gabor Maté, and more.

\- Dopamine is not just the ""pleasure"" chemical. It’s the motivation and \*anticipation\* chemical. Dr. Anna Lembke, psychiatrist at Stanford and author of \*Dopamine Nation\*, explains we don’t get addicted to outcomes, we get addicted to the \*chase\*. Every scroll on TikTok is a dopamine lottery ticket. Every tab switch is chasing tiny novelty hits. Which means your brain learns to \*expect\* stimulation every 30 seconds. No wonder a 20-minute task feels impossible.

\- If your brain is constantly stimulated by dopamine-overloading activities (YouTube shorts, IG reels, Reddit, junk food), your baseline dopamine level drops. This is called ""dopamine downregulation"". Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman says this is one reason why normal tasks feel ""boring"" or even painful  because your brain’s reward system got hijacked by too much stimulation. Focus doesn’t feel good anymore because NOTHING feels good unless it’s hyper-stimulating.

\- The fix isn’t quitting dopamine. It’s \*resetting your sensitivity\*. This is why Huberman recommends a 30-day ‘dopamine fast’ not from everything, but from \*high-frequency novelty\*. It means: delay gratification, restrict short-term highs (social media, sugar binges, even background noise while working). Over time, your brain starts to ""upregulate"" its sensitivity again. Focus starts to \*feel\* rewarding again.

\- The 45/15 rule works better than Pomodoro. According to peak performance researcher Steven Kotler (\*The Art of Impossible\*), the brain needs about 20 minutes of uninterrupted effort to shift into flow state  not 5 like Pomodoro fans think. But after about 90 minutes, mental energy crashes. So he recommends working in 45-minute deep blocks with 15-minute low-dopamine breaks (walk, journal, silence). That gives you dopamine regulation \*and\* recovery.

\- Start your day with “dopamine discipline”. First 60 minutes are sacred. No dopamine flooding. No phone, no social scroll, not even checking email. Instead: sunlight, movement, hydration. This stacks your brain to \*earn\* dopamine through internal rewards. Dr. Paul Conti (Stanford psychiatrist) argues that external dopamine is cheap, but internal dopamine builds long-term drive.

\- Novelty is not always bad. You can \*harness\* dopamine for focus by mixing in “intermittent novelty”  change work locations, listen to new (non-lyrical) music, or introduce a competitive timer. Your brain loves surprises. Brain scans from the University College London show that unexpected rewards spike dopamine more than predictable ones. Just make sure the novelty supports, not distracts.

\- Your inputs shape your chemistry. Diet and sleep aren’t optional. Low tyrosine foods (dopamine precursor) and poor sleep reduce dopamine receptor sensitivity. Magnesium, omega-3s, and regular movement support better dopamine regulation. Multiple studies in \*Nature Neuroscience\* show that even mild sleep deprivation cuts focus by up to 40% and weakens impulse control.  

\- Context beats willpower. The environment controls your cognitive load. From \*Deep Work\* by Cal Newport: willpower burns out fast, so you need to ""design for discipline"". That means: no more than 1 tab open. Pre-block all temptations. Set up a visual cue for your main task (notion doc open, post-it on screen). And use tech tools like Cold Turkey or the Forest app to automate restraint.

Focus is not some moral high ground. It’s a neurochemical state your brain enters when the environment, timing, and rhythms align. We’ve just been trained by bad platforms and worse advice to destroy our ability to access it.

You’re not broken or too weak. You’re just overstimulated. But chemistry can be rebalanced. And when you rebuild your dopamine system with intention? Focus becomes fun again. Not a punishment.",1,1763986650.0,LockedInMan,0,1.0,False

I've been thinking about how we tend to save our thankfulness for the big moments—the job promotion, the answered prayer, the crisis averted. But this verse doesn't say ""give thanks when something amazing happens."" It just says give thanks, because he is good.

What strikes me is that God's goodness isn't conditional on my circumstances feeling good. His love endures, on the mundane days, the frustrating days, the nothing-special-happened days.

Lately I've been trying to practice thankfulness in the small stuff. The hot coffee. The functioning car. My wife's laugh from the next room. These aren't dramatic blessings, but they're evidence of God's enduring love showing up in regular life.

I think we miss a lot when we only thank God for the highlights. His goodness is constant, even in the ordinary.

If you're just joining me, here's what I've exposed so far.

It started with a simple question: why do the same faces appear in every major production?

**The Introduction** set the stage, revealing the brutal gap between the on-set ideal of equality and the off-set reality of a deeply divided industry.

**Chapter 1** dismantled the ""level playing field"" and presented the data: a tiny handful of agencies form an oligopoly, controlling a massive share of the cast in shows like *The Crown*, *House of the Dragon*, and *The Witcher*.

**Chapter 2** exposed the ""Human Algorithm""—the informal coffees, social media signals, and the 30-audition head-starts for the chosen few, proving the data has a human cost.

**Chapter 3** revealed the master key: **The Private List.** I showed how the real casting happens in private spreadsheets, bypassing Spotlight entirely. I exposed how the agency chokehold extends from the writer's room to the director's chair, making a mockery of ""open auditions.""

**So, what's next in Chapter 4?**

You've seen how the roles are allocated. Now, I examine the farce of how you're expected to audition for the scraps.

**Chapter 4 is: ""The Self-Tape Farce.""**

I'm breaking down how the great ""democratiser"" became another stage for inequality, a source of unpaid labour, and a psychological trap that keeps actors isolated and guessing.

The curtain has been pulled back. Now, I show you the clown show behind it.

Full stop. And I completely get it. I mean damn, I’m not even halfway there and I already find myself questioning my motivation sometimes.

But while high school often sucks, and can get really difficult and confusing at times, there are a few things that may help change that. 

As teens, we have to wake up early, go to school all day, and then go home and study, amongst other things like working, extracurricular activities and having a social life. Despite being unable to make all that go away, I want to try and make it easier for both you and me.

Here I’ve compiled a list of my **‘Top School Life Hacks All High School Students Should Know!’** in order to make high school a bit less of a struggle.

Hope you enjoy!

# Smell Peppermint:

Did you know that the smell and taste of peppermint is actually beneficial to stimulating your brain and allowing you to concentrate. So, if you’re in class, an exam or studying at home, smell the scent of peppermint or chew on peppermint gum to allow you to focus!

# Google Translate:

After writing an essay of any kind, copy and paste it into Google Translate and listen to how the essay is read in order to find spelling or grammatical errors. 

# Use Highlighters:

When studying, use highlighters as a way to draw attention to information you’re unsure about. Not only will it help you memorise the information as it is seen as most important, but it will also make it easier to find when switching throughout topics. (I would also recommend colour-coding your highlighters based on subject!)

# Drink Water To Wake Up:

No matter how much sleep you get, you will always be tired when you wake up in the morning. That’s just how it is, especially when it comes to being a student. However, the scientific reason behind this is because you’re just dehydrated. As soon as you wake up, drink a large cup of water or two to replenish and re-energise your body, ready for the day!

# Memorize Pi:

In order to memorise the first 8 digits of Pi (𝝅) which are 3.1415926, count the amount of letters of each word in the phrase “May I Have A Large Container Of Coffee?”

For example, May=3 I=1 Have=4

This will help you remember pi!

# Use The Pomodoro Technique:

When studying for long amounts of time, our brain tends to lose focus as we lose interest. To ensure we study or work for a healthy length of time and vividly remember the details of the content, try to apply the pomodoro technique to all of your study sessions! To do this, you work without distraction for 25 minutes, followed by a 5 minute break. You repeat this 4 times before taking a longer 20 minute break. It works so effectively!

# Write In Blue Ink:

According to scientific research, you are much more likely to remember study notes written in blue ink than any other colour of pen. So, from now on, scratch black pens and lead pencils, use blue pens instead!

# Write It Down:

Did you know that writing any set of information down is equivalent to reading the same set of material 7 times?! If you want a quick and easy way to effectively study for a test or exam, make sure you write down your notes!

# Say It Out Loud:

As well as writing down your notes, it’s important to say any relevant study material out loud. While it starts off quite weird talking to yourself, research has shown that you are 50% more likely to remember something if you say it out loud instead of read it to yourself. 

# Lock Screen:

When it comes to high school, your phone lock screen becomes your best friend. In order to keep on top of your classes, place a photo of your schedule as your background photo to avoid getting lost. If not, put a motivational quote as your background to remind you how amazing you are everytime you turn on your phone!

# Take Notes Using Different Coloured Pens:

Take your notes using different coloured pens! Not only will using a set of different coloured pens make your notes look aesthetic and organised, but it will also make it easier to recall the content easily. However, if you’re not into coloured pens, stick to writing in blue ink and use highlighters to colour coordinate instead. 

# Watch Youtube And Play Games At School!:

I don’t know about you, but at my school, the wifi blocks loads of websites including gaming websites, youtube, clothing stores and shops. While I don’t 100% recommend this, if you are super bored at school, go into **incognito mode** on Google Chrome. Make sure you’re only google chrome and press the keyboard combination Ctrl-Shift-N for Windows and Command-Shift-N for Mac. This will allow you to look at whatever you want at school!

# Use Google Scholar:

Instead of using Safari or regular Google, use Google scholar! (With the URL scholar.google.com) Not only will you find more reliable and relevant sources of information to research from, but it also provides every type of citation for each web page!

# Take Notes In Class:

What to avoid spending hours before each exam gathering and writing down notes for your upcoming exams? Instead, write your notes in class! Every lesson when completing work, keep open another document where you write down any relevant information. When it comes time for preparing for a test or exam, you’ll be set with pages of information you can cut and paste accordingly. 

# Sound Smarter In Your Writing:

This is one of my favourite tricks! In order to sound smarter when writing any sort of essay or report, look up synonyms for any word replaceable with another! This is so you don’t repeat the same word multiple times! You can also use this tip to cut or increase your word count!

# Want To Simplify Wikipedia?:

Wikipedia is one of my go-to sites when it comes to research. In order to find a summary of those crazy long articles about almost anything, simply replace the ‘en’ in the wikipedia URL with ‘simple’ to get a simplified, summarised version of the article. 

# How Much Do We Learn?:

While I know this isn’t exactly a ‘hack’, this information is really great to know! Here is a list of all the ways we learn and how accurate they are. Screenshot the list below to keep in mind when studying for exams or conducting research. I promise you won’t regret it! Did you know that you learn…

* 10% of what we learn
* 20% of what we hear
* 30% of what we see
* 50% of what we see and hear
* 70% of what we discuss
* 80% of what we experience
* And 95% of what we teach others

  
For the most part, high school is great! But no matter how great it is, it can also be a really overwhelming and stressful aspect of a teens life. 

Using these hacks, I hope that *you* found some great tips and tricks in order to boost your productivity, motivation and happiness when it comes to school!

While you already may have known about some of these hacks, just remember that every step closer to reaching your ultimate goal, or every bit of time-saving, life-easing advice can be a huge help and play a massive part in your everyday life!

1p5f6yh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1p5f6yh/my_boyfriend_has_been_talking_to_my_best_friend/,My boyfriend has been talking to my best friend about our relationship behind my back for months,"i don't even know where to start. my hands are literally shaking typing this so sorry if it's messy.

I'm 25F, boyfriend Carter is 27M, we've been together for almost 2 years. My best friend Yolanda (25F) and I have been close since freshman year of college. She's the one who introduced me to Carter actually. They worked together at some point I think.

So last night. I was at Carter's apartment and we were watching something, I forget what. His phone was on the coffee table and a message popped up. I wasn't trying to snoop I swear but it was RIGHT there and I saw Yolanda's name and the preview said something like ""yeah I get it, she can be a lot sometimes.""

She can be a lot sometimes.

I asked Carter what that was about and he got weird. Like immediately defensive. Said it was nothing, just venting, not a big deal.

I made him show me the messages.

They've been talking. For MONTHS. Like since at least March?? Maybe longer I couldn't scroll forever. And it's all about me. About our relationship. He's been telling her when we fight. When I'm ""being difficult."" When he's frustrated with me.

And she's been responding. Agreeing with him. Giving him advice. ""Just give her space she gets like this."" ""Yeah she did that to me once too lol."" Like they have this whole private thing going on where they discuss what a handful I am.

I just sat there reading and I felt like I was gonna throw up.

I asked Yolanda about it this morning and she acted like I was overreacting. Said Carter just needed someone to talk to and she was ""being a good friend to both of us."" BOTH of us?? She never once told me any of this was happening. She never once said hey maybe you guys should communicate better or hey Carter's been saying some stuff you should know about.

I'm a speech therapist. I literally help people communicate for a living. And apparently everyone in my life has been communicating about me except TO me.

I don't know who I'm more mad at. Carter for going behind my back or Yolanda for letting it happen and never saying anything. Or myself for not noticing I guess.

carter keeps texting saying he's sorry and that he just needed to vent and didn't want to ""burden me with his frustrations."" what does that even mean.",8,1763985569.0,TwoHotTakes,8,1.0,False

Rule is simple: if it has a name on it, don't touch it. I buy expensive caramel vanilla creamer and always write my name on the bottle.  
  
It started disappearing much too quickly. One day I walked in and caught a coworker(let's call him Chad) chugging my creamer straight from the bottle. My name was right there. He just said, ""It's just creamer, relax,"" and walked out.  
  
So I ""relaxed""  
  
I poured my good creamer into a plain jar with my name on the lid and hid it in the back of the fridge. I filled the original fancy bottle with cheap creamer and put it back in the door. When that started vanishing, I upgraded to sugar-free, fat-free, nasty diet creamer in the fancy bottle. My real stuff stayed hidden.  
  
Whereby Chad just kept taking it, and then began to complain that the office coffee tasted weird. He even emailed the office manager about ""the creamer in the kitchen."" She replied to all to remind people that things with labels on them are personal property, and if people want creamer they should bring some in or buy some communal creamer.  
  
Soon a large bottle of the generic “Office” creamer materialized. That is what everyone now uses, including Chad. I still keep my real caramel vanilla in a plain jar in the back.

There's a rich bitter in some teas that's reminiscent of coffee or chocolate, and other times I find the bitter sharp, and hard to bear in large amounts, but nice as an accent.  Some of the more malty black teas also seem to have a bitter all their own, that comes on gradually, that I can't really even describe.  There's another bitter I get in some raw puer teas that's almost sickly and cloying.  And yet another that is followed by a sweet sensation.  

Anybody up to debating whether there is more than one bitter?  I'm sure someone could point out scientific proof that the same, certain taste receptors in our taste buds are going off, but that's doesn't describe the subjective experience any more than talk of rods and cones in our retina explains the what I experience watching a sunset.

First marriage ended because it was better for both of us to divorce and my first wife kind of tipped it over the edge with emotional cheating that she admitted was physical at some point (I didn't want all the details). My current wife knew this history when she met me. 

I met her through work (she was a cocktail actress and I was a bouncer). I was only four months out of my first marriage and this woman swept ME off MY feet. I didn't focus on myself before getting into a relationship, I was totally captivated by her. She had a rough past, most of which was described as the past when we were dating. But a lot of it followed us into our present. Every effort to put the past to rest was met by behavior that seemed to indicate her past wasn't so much the past; it was more of a footnote in her current story.

I don't want to lay it all out there but I suspected early on that she was cheating. She would create arguments and run back to her old neighborhood (where her sugar daddy had been paying for her to live - she had tried to steal ownership of the property from him btw) and then baulk when I said I'm not settling for that. She volunteered for a VSA over some of the things I told her I was doubtful of - like, that she would go back to that neighborhood and visit family, but the next time family saw her they'd be like ""I haven't seen you in forever! How have you been?"", but she'd be telling me that's where she was when she ran off a day or two before lol 

Anyway, I know a VSA or even a lie detector is just a tool - not admissable in court or even reliable. And I suspected she could believe her own lies, so I told the VSA administrator I'd like to know typical stuff - has she done anything she considers cheating, been with anyone, etc, but also asked him to ask her something she most likely wasn't prepared for - has she engaged in prostitution. She passed all the questions she was prepared to be asked, but failed the question about prostitution. 

At that point, I believed she was a liar who believes her own lies. I surmised she didn't have an answer prepared for that specific question because it was an unexpected suspicion I had not conveyed to her. However, I'm also an idiot who lets her explain away EVERYTHING. I stayed, chauling it up to ""she failed it because that was part of her past at one point and I convoluted everything by asking for that question to be presented."" She came out of that like a super liar and pretty much does whatever she wants. When we've argued about the results, she's said stuff like ""Then how'd I pass it (conveniently forgetting the prostitution fail)?!"" while deflecting with ""You probably think I blew him to pass"" etc, etc, which she now tells as a story which presents me as saying she ""blew the VSA administrator to pass"" - does a great job of making me sound crazy, while deflecting from the relevant details.

But she aaalllwaaaaysss made it easy for me to put the blinders on and manipulated me into feeling like I'm the asshole for impuning her character or inviting accountability or questioning anything. We couldn't have a real conversation without it immediately being turned back on me. She would make ""check in videos"" I NEVER ONCE asked for, NEVER ONCE wanted and she would spin stories to other people about how I was some control freak making her record everything she does. This went on and off for six years. Add to this that she wanted to be a stay at home Mom when our son was born and I have VA Disability benefits, so that's what she did. For six years. I admittedly have had problems finding work and keeping it (disabilities tend to do that to you). She never pays anything (well, she paid the water bill twice), but EVERYTHING is in her name (except our current lease which is in both our names). I started to feel I was finally at my wits end and wanted to do better for myself and all my kids (previous marriage and our son we have together). 

So, in 2022 I went back to school. I finished my AA in Business in May 2023 with a 4.0 GPA. She got jealous of my time (legitimately full blown, angry at my ""tunnel vision"" focus ANYTIME I tried to do ANY school work). But I finished it in SPITE of her. We both worked Amazon Flex through that + my VA Benefits, but mostly she'd get sick of driving and would hold out until I knew we needed the money and I'd pick up extra routes WHILE ALSO doing my coursework. Which also meant I couldn't get relevant experience for my degree. 

Anyway, she, on a whim, decides to go to college to be an elementary school teacher, which I supported. She starts her bachelor's as I'm finishing my AA and enrolled in my bachelors.  All of this is happening against the backdrop of my suspicions she is fooling around. But at this point I was too numb to it to care and almost had a ""can't beat em join em attitude"" wherein I wise cracked about her being gone two hours to get coffee or some crap (random example) by saying shit like ""well, I guess if I know about it it's not cheating"". Then, of course, that's sets off another cycle of her wounded dove ""how dare you"" and I don't even fight about it. I throw my hands up and almost encourage it, like just do the shit and stop lying. 

To compensate, I even encouraged camming when she brought it up - we dabbled, but it didn't stick for me. Well, it seemed to have stuck for her. She made multiple cam sessions after we had supposedly called it quits, and at a time when we really needed money. And maybe more...literally on the day we needed to pay rent (my benefit deposit didn't post in the morning and I was waiting for it to post in the afternoon as was the norm when it wasn't there in the AM), she picks up and Uber trip as a driver (I never saw the actual Uber trip pay in the Uber app or anything) to drive some couple to a destination 7.5 hours away. Doesn't even make sure our son and me are fine. Accepts the trip and calls me on the way, without even giving me an opportunity to take the little money we did have and go get food for the day. Leaves me and our son in the name of paying rent that would definitely have gotten paid that day, along with all our bills, and a months worth of groceries once my deposit hit. Anyway, she came back with twice the money she said she was gonna make and didn't really do anything except give conflicting details about who, what, when, where, and why for anything I asked. Which I definitely asked. That's pretty much been our entire marriage.



Anyway, I continued my degree program WHILE eventually getting work 50-80 hour weeks on a swing shift in a glass manufacturing plant. Meanwhile, she still wants to be a SAHM and go to school, but when no progress is made in her coursework and I press for whether she'll work once our son is in school, she flips her lid. Yells at me for not being supportive or supporting her. Yells at me for not doing enough around the house (mind you, I'm working up to 80 hour weeks AND finishing my degree AND still bringing in my benefits check AND pouring anything I have into doing as much as I physically and mentally can into caring for our son who is diagnosed with ASD). Oh, and I WAS cleaning the house - especially dishes because she ""hates"" doing dishes. ANY questions I asked, any goals I try to collaborate on, any accountability I present is met with resentment, hate, disdain, and false accusations (like I'm just getting my degree so I can get better opportunities and leave her or that I'm controlling and won't ""let her work"" and then she starts accusing me of cheating). 

She had full access to ALL of my finances (in the beginning I even split my paychecks with her 50/50, minus bills, the first three months). I stopped splitting it 50/50 after I worked a 70 hour work week and she helped herself to the entire check while leaving bills unpaid. She had full control of my phone. My livelihood. Everything. Her behavior made me suspicious - again. She procured numerous credit cards (6 or 7 at one point if I remember right) which I had ZERO access to. I challenged her on how impossible it would be for me to cheat and told her I don't even have the energy for myself - I definitely got nothing for anyone else. I suspected she was projecting and I said so. Then she threw out statements that I could track her, record her, do whatever, check whatever, that she's no cheater.

 Well, this always made me back down before because it's miserable for both of us. But this time, it felt different. She wasn't finishing her degree, she wasn't doing anything round the house, wasn't looking for work (got hired as a substitute teacher but never actually showed up for the job - not once). She ended up getting kicked out of her program. I started to wonder what she was doing with her time.

Long story short - I called her bluff. I gathered audio of her cheating while I was on night shift back in May. Continued to collect information (some circumstantial, but just as much concrete) that proved she was cheating. She had men at our marital home even when our son was home (May 21-23), I mostly stopped recording after finding that - it was rough. I got fired from my job right after this too. I started seeing a therapist. Then after two more months of being gaslit, I recorded again. She had men over on August 26, September 8, and September 19. A receipt plus a townie for a witness proves she had lunch with one AP while she was on her USPS route on October 18th. She placed a mobile order for a sub from Subway while she was on the phone with me, then he picked it up and brought it to her.

I confronted her with stuff that would be easy to deny, just to see if she would lie (didn't show her the rest and still haven't played the audio, just described it to her). Through all of this she still tells the same lies. And I let her. I told her I want a divorce, she said she did too. But then, she immediately turns into the love bombing Queen, and says she doesn't mean it and I'm stuck with her and that she ""hopes I know that"". I cowtail, and the cycle repeats. But the more we talked, the less I wanted to be here. 

Through all of this, I completed my BS in Psychology in September. I learned through therapy and through coursework that I wasn't being presumptuous about her, I was being observant and insightful. She had me convinced I was crazy - that's still the story she tells herself and her groupies - but learning and therapy have shown me a reality free of gaslighting mirrors.

Anyway, our anniversary was October 11th and I believe (some circumstantial, some concrete) she spent our anniversary day, plus the week before and the week after seeing the same dude on multiple occasions. I decided I was actually done. BUT I didn't believe it would be safe to actually say I'm leaving without having a place to go. So, I found one. In secret. But I wasn't sure how to leave. I paid all of our bills for the month of November. All of them (well, except her credit cards). I used the money I saved from school to live on and prepare. The timing was shitty but if I didn't leave then I wasn't going to be able to. 

I tried to bring up how bad things felt before I finalized the lease. The last words from her on that were that I'm crazy, she'd be better off, and she wanted to separate (but she also knows I don't believe in separation - it's either marriage or divorce). The reason I say the timing was shitty is because her birthday was November 2, 2025. But, in some kind of attempt at grasping for something and trying to give one last convo or choice, I did what I could for her birthday, then the next morning I presented her with two boxes, one box was labeled ""You"", the other box was labeled ""Us."" 

It was the only thing I knew to give her for her birthday and the only healthy way I knew to bring it up - a choice. Words weren't working. No forward motion was working. She kept moving the goalposts and I didn't know where they'd be moved to next. But I couldn't be disengenuous and ride out a week of silence or worse. In the ""Us"" box was the start of a conversation that led to a couples scavenger hunt that would help us talk about it. In the ""You"" box, was an opportunity for her to not have to say anything else about it, tell me what terms she wanted (house, car, etc) and be done - she could keep calling me crazy, I could leave her mask in tact, we'd just be done. I realize that's dramatic, but I had tried talking and art works for me - she hates that about me btw. And it was the only non-verbal way I knew to communicate without it blowing up. 

Well, she got pretty upset about it (which, I mean, I get it), but I'd didnt know what else to do. I went for a drive and when I came back it was like nothing happened. I had no idea what to do. She withheld and I withdrew. I had one phone for me and one for her if she chose ""Us"" - they were both new Google Pixel 10s she said she wanted (assuming that led to a conversation about fresh starts), but it didn't. The new phone for me was in the armrest (I would've ""given her my number"" in the moment she chose ""Us"" by handing her her new phone (pipe dreams). Anyway, my new phone went off with a ""time to set up your device"" kind of notification while we were driving later in the day. We were still in this weird twilight zone mood - wherein she avoids and I clam up. All I said was ""Well, no scavenger hunt I guess "".  She went about the rest of the night like everything was normal. I just kind of coasted. 



As the night started to wind down, she was in this love Bombay, white picket fence, head in the sand kind of mood and I felt like I was just sitting there in a daze, then it just came out. I said, ""I found a place."" She stood really still and I wasn't even sure she had heard me. Then she blew up, like the mask fell off and she lost it. No questions, no talk, just instant ""Get the fuck out! I knew you were gonna leave us with nothing! You're a piece of shit."" (Mind you, I had already paid ALL OF THE HOUSEHOLD BILLS FOR THE MONTH AND STILL HAD MONEY FOR GROCERIES). I barely got to kiss our son and she was hollering and yelling. For context, she has thrown crap at me then been the one to call the cops, only to back ou when I say ""Cool, I'd like to talk to them too"". I was concerned this would escalate further so I definitely didn't say anything extra or longer. I left. She made sure the whole neighborhood heard her accuse me of leaving them with nothing even though that wasn't true. The phone that was intended for her, I left at the door and told her to give it to our son so I could talk to him. It was brand new in the box and his favorite color (which is also one of her favorite colors). That was the backup purpose of the polhome if she chose the ""You"" box. Anyway, she threw it in the trash. Only admitted it after she needed me for something and I had asked if she activated it for him yet.

In the aftermath, I knew two things would be essential 1. I can not chip her narcisstic mask 2. I would have to show her that I truly have zero desire to take anything from her or deprive her or our son of anything (that I would keep paying bills as I had been doing).

So, I filed for divorce with all the terms I would agree to (she would have primary custody, we would split the rent for the remainder of the lease - even left it clear that if she chose for me to carry the lease, I wouldn't think it's fair but I would do it, and that I have no desire to be on the lease, and that I would agree to whatever she agrees to on transportation), which made public record that I would agree to all of that - only way I knew to prove it to her and to disprove any contrary claims she could make about me. I also texted her those terms so she would have her own documented proof that any lawyer could easily enforce in court.

Then, to ensure I didn't harm her ego any further, I waited til the end of the week after everything was officially filed and I VACATED THE DIVORCE and showed her proof of both (the filing that reflects all I would ask for AND the order to vacate that 1. Puts the ball in her court to be the one filing (narcissists don't like to be the ones left) while even leaving a little room for her to spew the ""I'm crazy"" part without really hurting me (because who does that, right?) and 2. Made it impossible for me to be the one to file, as the apartment I rented is in the neighboring county (close 28 minute drive for me to still see our son, but far enough that I would have to wait months as a continuous resident to file).



It sounds like a crazy move, but it's the only strategy that I believe would prevent her from making egocentric arguments or worse in the course of any ensuing narcissistic rage. I moved into my apartment and it seemed like that was that. But, then came short cycles of rage, lovebombing, come-rescue me, repeat. Each one following the other even faster if I gave neutral responses. But then...our son got sick with strep. She has to work and didn't agree to him being at my place when she worked. I recognized the guise of ""I don't think he should be over there"" as a control move to try to get me back into a pliable position. 

It snowballed from there and I feel like I'm sinking into the familiarity of this environment (been here pretty much most of the week). And I don't know if it's just the familiarity of the chaos, or believing that even with all the studying and personal growth I'm just an idiot, or if we're really just a turmoltuos love affair that will always be stuck in the same patterns. But I'm at my wits end. Someone with a MS or PhD or just a super solid street smart genius got any advice for me? I mean, she definitely spewed everything I believed she would spew - even on Reddit lol calling me crazy, lazy, non-achieving loser, deadbeat Dad, who is just out to rob, pillage, and destroy. 

But as soon as she saw the paperwork, it was like night and day. I'm not trying to sink into this, but she's never stayed ""normal"" this long. But I don't know if I can be normal or healthy here. I mean, I just got hired into a degree relevant position and I'm already doubting myself (was super confident before coming back here) and she's already made comments about wishing she could just stay home with our son all day. Which, yes that would be great if we were rich, but we are not. And full transparency - I'm hoping I don't suck at this new job and that I actually do some good. And she rreeeeallllyyy needs to keep her job. She tried to quit hers like a month before I decided I was leaving, leaving and I told her back then not to quit. 

It keeps me on the hook in an endless ""rescue me, you controlling asshole"" cycle if she quits. And I'm a better Dad away from all this. And she could do so much more if she put as much effort into living life rather than running through it - and I'm really convinced she needs a single life, but is genuinely afraid to be alone or knows it'll negatively affect the new image she's built up with her family (she was the black sheep, now they think she's turned a new leaf - which she mostly has, it's just that I think somehow ""family life"" is part of that impression). Like, on the one hand I think she only wants me here so she doesn't have to explain what fell apart (either because she chose a crappy husband or because she screwed up ""again"" - which I don't think she ""screwed up"", so much as we just each kind of helped each other through some crappy transitions, but maybe our best selves aren't with each other).

I mean, if stepping out made her happy, she's obviously lacking something in this marriage. And if I really were crazy and she's always been faithful, she also shouldn't be stuck here. Conversely, I want someone to love and be loved by - someone that I can explore sexuality and intimacy with confidently, knowing I'm not the cuck in their story. I do love her. We're both a little ""chemically unbalanced"", but am I screwing up by not going straight back to my apartment right now, setting my feet solidly in a new career, and focusing on being a better me for our son? Or am I betraying our son by stepping out into the world, apart from him and his mother because I have thin skin? ",1,1763984788.0,cheatingwivesbusted,0,1.0,False
1p5eyd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DispatchAdHoc/comments/1p5eyd6/my_thoughts_on_doing_a_perfect_mission/,My thoughts on doing a perfect mission playthrough after completing it,"First off HUGE shout out to HexStarDragon who wrote the perfect mission guide on steam, this would not even remotely be possible without them. As for perfect mission run, in my eyes at least its completing every mission without failing them (obviously) AND completing episode 8 without ever failing attacking coupe/sonar once

My thoughts post doing the run are as follows

* Heavily relies on abusing the game mechanic of waiting out mission timers. certain missions dont start till you complete a previous one so you can leave it up and let your heroes rest and then complete it. if this ever gets patched i genuinely dont think a perfect run is possible

* The ""instant fail too high stat mechanic""  means its actually better to NOT level up your heroes. I got to episode 8 with approx 20 spare points following the guide as you wanna keep them low to avoid triggering the fail and have them usable on all missions

* Even with a guide and perfect timing its still RNG, doing episode 8 took me over an hour of retrying

* shockingly you can actually do perfect missions even if you make choices that debuff your team or have heroes missing but its a VERY small window of error

* The rewards for hitting max dispatcher dont help other than the coffee since they only matter if youre heroes are injured/downed. and if youre doing it perfect than that never happens (save for scripted injuries and the final dispatch but even then your heroes probably have heal powers)

* I actually kind of wish there was a reward for doing this. granted its the most tedious thing ever but i kinda wish the story commented more on your success as a dispatcher

* thank the lord for the character specific quests that you auto succeed for sending the right person

* the game is very clearly NOT designed for you to actually complete every mission without fail.  it actually makes the narrative worse off at times as it make no sense at times when your team or someone else is complaining about failure right after you just did 30 calls perfectly

Ultimately this was just something I wanted to do and it was my 2nd playthrough anyways so might as well. I wouldnt recommend anyone do this. But it is possible for now, just know theres no reward/incentive. its also kinda boring as you sit around waiting for timers to run out to game missions and not level up your heroes so the auto fail mechanic doesnt fuck them.",3,1763984781.0,DispatchAdHoc,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I (41F) met Aspen (4? FTM) on an app a little under two weeks ago. Seemed like a cool person, we work in the same overall field, in two different areas locally. Aspen was up front about being a felon and in recovery and said he was divorced and had adult kids. He said he had practiced ENM with his ex and there were trust issues and “other things” happened which is why they broke up. He was ready to date again and was interested in polyamory and had already done some research.

I feel very weirded out right now and getting very bad vibes. 

When we first matched I was taking an instructor course related to our field. He said he’d taken it the class before. The day I completed the class, he messaged me with “I really need some help, it’s for my job and I’m wondering if you could do me a huge favor…” He wanted me to teach a class to him because his certificate expired.  I cannot do that and even if I could, this is a course that takes multiple hours. I declined because my agency has strict requirements for me to teach and the class has to be done a certain way. I gave him resources for an organization that offers the course in the county where he works instead. 

One evening I was driving a long distance and he offered to chat to keep me company. We talked about some things in our lives and general interests. Our pets, basic stuff. I volunteer with a youth group and I talked about it. He shared that he’s not *actually* divorced. He’s planning to divorce. He and his wife have been together for heard but have only been married for *under a year* and they’re also now good friends. They just can’t stay married. 

The very next morning (yesterday) he texts me to see if his friend’s son would be able to join in the youth program, and that I won him over on it because I am so passionate about it. He would be the person taking the child to the program. I gave him some information and sent him a link with contact info for that age group, because I work with a different age group. 

We were supposed to have a first date yesterday evening and I messaged him around 7:30 to ask when he’d like to meet up but I wasn’t feeling hungry so maybe coffee or something. He said 9:30, and wanted to take a walk in city park or swing at a playground. It is cold out and it was raining earlier, the city park is not well lit, and the playground closes at dusk. It is also not a place I want to be at night. When I declined, he offered to bring a towel to wipe the swings off but it was okay, we could meet somewhere. I ultimately cancelled on him because it would be too late for me (and because I felt like his suggestions were very weird.) 

This morning he texted me to tell me that he wanted to invite me over to his place the night before, and basically he’d like to hang out sometime at his place. I told him that I would prefer to meet for the first time in a public place and unfortunately this week coming is wild with work, existing commitments, thanksgiving, etc.  I haven’t even gone shopping much yet for thanksgiving. 

Wrong answer, apparently?

He immediately offered to *meet me at the grocery store* if I am there alone because he also does instacart and can *help me* and if nothing else he wants to see if we have good energy (?) A couple of hours later he texted to let me know that we don’t have to move so fast and that I’m right and it’s better to meet in a public place, he’s just excited to meet me in person and he really likes me. 

At some point this past week he mentioned that he got locked out of the dating app because he changed his number and didn’t verify something. I decided to check for it today, and his profile is absolutely gone. I genuinely don’t remember how old he said he was on Tinder but I’m getting the sense that he lied to me. 

I had some reservations from the get go, but thought he was a decent guy and we had a lot in common. All of this has happened in the last few days. It is way way too much.

daft, carefree kids one more time.” Iain’s eyes seemed misty with unshed tears.

“When Junior was born, David and Marie weren’t prepared for him: money was always tight,

they had no baby things, not even a cot. When I brought them home, we discovered that

Bryan had decorated the spare bedroom to make a nursery and he’d bought almost

everything they needed – probably bankrupting himself in the process.” He slumped wearily

in his wheelchair. “That’s the memory I cling to,” he stated, his face contorted by grief. His

shoulders shook, as if he were crying, but no tears ran down his face.

“Honestly Iain, there is no pressure to do this,” Nordale stated quietly.

“No!” Iain rasped. “I need to do this.”

Nordale adjusted his position on the hard chair then simply nodded and started the

recording.

O’Donnell, I: Session three.

So, I will re-stress, I did as I was ordered, then with a heavy heart followed them back on to

the trail by which we had arrived. We left water and some dried rations behind us for if my

brother or nephew were somewhere out there still.

Our conversation had all but died on our way back towards our first camp site. I had stormed

off ahead of the rest of the group to navigate – I needed to feel more in control – but I admit

that in that moment I felt betrayed by Bryan and Richard; I needed to find my family, dead or

alive.

Richard pushed his pace on to catch up to me. “Don’t cut me out, Iain,” he said. “You know

deep down if the shoe was on the other foot you would make me do the same thing.”



I sighed. “Yeah, I know you’re right, brother. I’m sorry. I just can’t stand the thought of Junior

out here. I need to see the boy home, whatever state he is in.”

“We all want that too, mate,” Richard said, putting his hand on my shoulder. “Something still

confuses me though: if everything else is dead, how did the dog escape here?”

I had questioned this myself but then I looked at everything surrounding us. “I can’t even

begin to wonder…”

“Alby was certainly glad to see us,” Richard commented, smiling. “But he was starving

hungry. On the one hand, if he’s ok, then they might be. But if they’d been together, there is

no way he wouldn’t have been fed…”

I knew Richard was just trying to reassure and distract me in his usual, kindly manner. For

the next hour, or so it seemed, he regaled me with reminiscences of Alby as a puppy,

Freddy, his childhood dog, Boots, the squadron mascot, and a dozen strays he had come

across in the course of carrying out his duty. He always had wanted to work with animals. I

wish we had spent longer reminiscing over the various canines close to his heart before the

peace was abruptly ended by a sight that chilled my blood.

We were near a small, natural clearing… where a quantity of fabric lay puddled on the

ground, almost concealed from sight in a dip in the rutted land. The now disturbed fabric of a

second tent was wrapped and secured firmly around what was the body of Daniel Booth. We

were back at my brother’s campsite. The food we had left still sat on top of the cooler.

“How in the hell are we back here?” Bryan asked, completely disorientated.

“I don’t have a clue,” I said, peering in a bewildered fashion at the map. “Not only have we

ended up back here, but despite walking west all afternoon we have arrived back here from

the opposite side to where we left.”

Allistair snatched the map. “Bullshit! You’ve just led us back here and you know it and don’t

want to admit it!”

“Alastair, calm down - this isn’t helping!”

“Don’t tell me to calm down!” he shrieked, spittle flying from his mouth, his eyes wide and

staring. “I’m beginning to think you guys are just deliberately fucking with me now! None of

this makes sense and as soon as I suggest we head back, suddenly, oh - we just magically

happen to arrive back in this camp? Well, I’m heading for base!” Alastair stormed back

towards the direction in which we left this place the first time.

“Come on, kid, it’s will be getting dark soon, long before you can make the rangers’ station,

don’t be reckless!” Richard yelled to him as he tried to catch up to him.

“No! I am done! This whole place is fucked! I can’t stay here! I won’t stay here!”

“Come on, son, you know the risks of trying to hike this place at night,” I interjected.

“Oh, of course you want to stay here! It’s what you wanted all along!” Alastair snapped at

me. “What is it then? The three of you mislead me in to thinking you’ll listen then do the

opposite and act all surprised?”

“Er guys…” Byran stammered, but his comment went ignored.

“Soon as we get back, I’ll make sure I never see any of you here again!” Alastair was yelling,

squaring up to me.



“Guys…”

“Calm down, lad, before I put you in line,” I threatened.

“Guys!” Bryan yelled.

“What, Bryan??”

“I feel… Something just grabbed my hand…”

The three of us turned around to where Byran was standing. He was drip white and

panicking, his rifle raised, but aimed in no particular direction.

“Okay Bryan, just put your gun down. What do you mean?”

Byran didn’t move his hands gripping his weapon tightly. “Something just grabbed hold of my

hand!” Abruptly, the gun seemed to fall – almost to be flung – from his hands. Bryan was

turning around, looking for something he could not see, then staring wild-eyed at us. “God -

can’t you hear the whispering!?”

We all looked around but could see and hear nothing. The dead forest offered no answers

as to what plagued Bryan. I held my hands out and stepped cautiously towards him.

“Byran, talk to me: what’s up?” I pleaded.

“Oh, for God’s sake, he’s just wasting time, so we have to stay here!” Alastair snapped.

Bryan stormed towards Alastair, pointing directly at him.

“It was right there! You must have seen it; it was right where you are now!” He gesticulated

wildly towards a space to the right of Alastair, his outstretched hand pointing.

Bryan stopped dead in his tracks as he stared at his hand: a blackish mark was spreading

on the top of it, staining his skin…

“Oh…”

Then, Bryan’s entire body seemed to fold over on itself. He started to convulse. His face was

contorted in agony. He grabbed his stomach and turned toward me.

\&quot;Iain... I...\&quot;

Suddenly, Bryan whipped backwards, violently, arched over impossibly until we heard

vertebrae grind together and dislocate. His eyes appeared milky, as though with cataracts,

then it was as if they shriveled in their sockets.

As he desperately flailed around, blind and in agony, Richard and I could do nothing but

watch the ungodly sight of our brother’s final moments...

Bryan was shrieking in agony, as his teeth were forced from his withered gums, seemingly

turning to dust before they even hit the ground. Bryan – the wretched remains of Bryan -

clutched at Alastair’s coat. An unearthly, animal wail of fear and agony seared his throat.

Alastair echoed his scream, as his mind locked into a catatonic state.

In front of the terrified youth, Bryan’s skin turned grey and leathery. It stretched across his

bones, splitting and vaporizing. His skeletal hands still clutched Alastair’s coat, and he fell

backwards, Bryan’s corpse landing on top of him. Bryan continued to contort, and with a



sudden, horrific rupturing noise, Bryan’s stomach burst open causing his shrivelled organs to

cover Alastair in a tsunami of dust.

The suffering finally ended, the dissonant sounds of the events echoing through the decayed

woodland…

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Iain was slumping in his chair, exhausted and distressed. Silently, Nordale poured more

coffee and pushed the mug towards him. “Can I… do you need anything else?” Nordale

questioned gently. He had no idea what could be the cause or origin of the events O’Donnell

was describing, but this account wasn’t the strangest he had ever heard, by a long way –

and, looking at the traumatized man hunched over before him in the wheelchair, Nordale had

no doubt of his absolute sincerity.

Iain exhaled, a deep, shuddering sigh of breath, then continued.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Before we knew what was happening, Alastair was on his feet, screaming, throwing the husk

of… what had been our friend… to one side. Then he ran off into the trees. He didn’t seem

to be heading in any direction – just ran, crashing through branches, cannoning off trees,

leaving a thick plume of dust swirling in the air behind him. We ran after him – there was no

discussion of it, there just seemed to be no choice, really.

With no time to grieve or even think, Richard and I tried to catch up with Alastair. We were

fearful of what could happen to him – what dangers were out there – and after all, he was

only there because of us. Or me, really. We were all there because of me…

It was Richard, finally, who drew close enough to rugby-tackle Alastair to the ground.

“Calm down! Snap out of it!” he ordered. “You’re going to get us all killed: we need to work

together if we’re going to get out of this,” he stated.

Alastair, wild-eyed and terrified, was still trying to shake him off, but abruptly seemed to

realise that he was still covered in dust; his panic shifted from Richard to ineffectually wiping

off the corpse-dust from his clothes and skin, scratching his face in his frantic efforts to wipe

the dust from his mouth and eyes.

“Oh, God, it’s death! This dust is dead things!” he shrieked. “I’m clarted in dead…things!”

Alastair was hauling at his clothes, tearing off his jacket and t-shirt.

Richard reached into his backpack, pulled out a bottle of water and gently, soothing Alastair

as a mother would her child, started to wipe the dust from his face. “Ok… I’ve got you… it’s

going to be fine, you’ll be ok…”

By the time we had finally calmed him down enough for him to change into clean clothes –

mine, as he had lost his gear in his panicked flight – we had lost the last of the light.

Far off the planned route and with map and compass back in a distant clearing with the

remains of our friend, we had no choice but to hurriedly pitch a single tent. Two would sleep

– or attempt to – whilst one kept guard. Though for what we didn’t know.

For about an hour, I sat in the silence. No night noises. No creatures. No stars. No sound of

river or breeze in the tree-tops.



Richard emerged from the tent. “Finally got the lad asleep,” he stated flatly. He stared at me

shrewdly through narrowed eyes. “Iain. You just led us back there, didn’t you? Deliberately.”

“How can you even suggest that?” I hissed, furious, but unwilling to rouse Alastair. “We

simply got lost!”

Richard stared at me impassively. “I hope you’re not lying – because we all have to live with

the results of our actions, however good or evil.” With that, he headed back to the tent,

leaving me to the profound silence.

I stayed on watch, as I had started. In fact, I wasn’t planning on waking either of them.

Alastair was in no state… and Richard? Letting him rest was the least I could do. If it weren’t

for me, he would be off fishing or birdwatching, enjoying the beauty of the Dales, or walking

in the Pennines. Not here.

I don’t know when the voices started. If they were voices. But in the darkest hours of the

night, I became aware of a feeling in the air, a movement, like a touch of a breeze, that

gradually solidified into a sound. You know when you strain your ears to hear something?

And you can not discern a single word or syllable, yet you know that the murmuring, the

whispering, is a voice, a voice full of significance and meaning, if you could only know what it

was saying… It scratches at your memory, your thoughts, as if… You could remember. You

could know. But it’s impossible…

“Iain, what are you doing?” Richard abruptly broke in to my thoughts. After how long, I can’t

say. Morning had crawled in, grey and hazy. My limbs were stiff and numb from remaining

motionless, fixed in the same attitude for… I can’t say how long. Had I slept? No. Yet time

had passed.

Richard looked at me shrewdly. “Can you hear that, too?” he demanded.

I looked up at him, but he was staring off in to the distance, his attention focused on the

vanishing point of perspective in the distant woods.

Richard and I looked at each other. “Do we…? I feel like I need to find out what that is,

where it’s coming from,” Richard stated, his expression earnest.

I didn’t argue – I felt that need also. But it was Alastair who moved the decision beyond

discussion – Alastair, who we suddenly realised was already some distance off, the grassy

green of his T-shirt bright against the fungoid grey of the forest.

We stumbled off after him through the forest, every step kicking up plumes of grey dust. With

every step, it seemed as if the voices, whilst still incoherent, became increasingly intense,

insistent, invasive. The noise seemed to take over every sensation and awareness I had,

sending waves of nausea through my head and stomach. Blood was oozing from Richard’s

nose and he looked gaunt, yet fixated on the way ahead. I became aware of blood trickling

from my nose also, the metallic taste seeping in to my mouth. And yet Alastair was still

ahead of us, and still we all ploughed on through dead trees, oblivious to the uneven ground

and the impeding branches in our way.

And as the sounds, the voices, grew in intensity, their noise becoming cacophonous, to my

horror I heard one voice – an inhuman growl – finally giving us distinguishable sounds.

“You killed me…”



The words felt as though they had been snarled into my ear – or as if they had been created

inside my ear – and I saw Richard flinch at exactly the same moment, and I knew he had

experienced the same.

“Look what happened to me: that was you!” the voice hissed. And I would have sworn that

the voice was Bryan’s, only distorted and somehow sullied, polluted. “Wasn’t my death

enough for you?” the voice continued, only with a cruel inflection that I knew was not my

friend’s voice, but only a mocking parody of it.

It seemed to me by now that the air was constantly torn through by different voices –

mocking, cruel, insidious - a demented choir destroying our capacity for thought. Richard’s

face was a grimace of pain, and continuing to follow Alastair was visibly costing him huge

effort. Then, just as Alastair’s broad-shouldered form approached a denser band of trees,

the voice seemed to boom out thunderously, stunning my consciousness:

“You’ve damned us all!” the voice that was so like Bryan’s condemned me.

Alastair had disappeared and was hidden from our sight. Richard and I ploughed

despairingly after him, and as I fought my way through the dense band of trees, I almost fell

into the sudden space –

Silence.

The voices had ceased. All three of us were in a small clearing. And in to the blessed silence

in my head crept a gradual awareness of Richard next to me and Alastair, who turned to face

us, his eyes shocked and blank, like a woken sleepwalker. We embraced like long lost

brothers, clinging momentarily to each other, our minds the clearest they had been since

entering the forest.

It was the cool freshness of the air that hit me first. And for the first time in days, I could

inhale air free from the cloying, choking dust. I can’t explain or rationalize it, but within this

clearing, bounded on all sides by a dense wall of trees, all was green and alive, verdantly

beautiful.

And full of false promise.

“What fresh… hell… is this?”

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

A rap at the door had once again interrupted Iain’s account. The door opened a few inches

and Skinner’s impatient, bony face peered round the door. “Seriously? You’re still on with

this?” he sneered, his vendetta against Nordale overriding his usual appearance of

professionalism in front of members of the public.

Nordale quickly snapped out of his chair and confronted Skinner, using his energy and

presence to almost force him back through the doorway. “It would be more quickly

concluded,” he hissed, “without needless interruptions.”

“Why are you giving credence to this….fairy story?” Skinner demanded. “It’s clear that he

murdered them! We just need to know where they are!”

“It’s by no means ‘clear’ that he murdered them!” Nordale snapped. “You have absolutely

nothing that you can charge him with - which is why he isn’t even under caution!” Nordale

failed to keep the note of sarcasm from his voice.



Both were abruptly called back to awareness of Iain, as he wheeled up to the door, his face

dark with venomous anger. “I’ll be going, now. I’m not here to add fuel to your squabbling.

Nor to be accused of murder – or fabrications…” And he left, leaving no time for Nordale to

convince him to stay, his departing wheelchair causing even the insensitive Skinner to

question the consequences of his actions…",1,1763984123.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

1p5eo3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1p5eo3g/the_final_confession_of_iain_odonnell_part_1/,The Final Confession of Iain O'donnell Part 1,"The room redefined grey: grey walls; grey table; grey carpet – hell, even a grey chair. The

building seemed devoid of sound or any other form of sensory stimulation – no pictures, no

discernable smells… Although it was a busy building in a bustling city, nothing indicated

signs of life outside of that room.

Iain O’Donnell sat motionless, his powerful hands clasped on the table in front of him in an

attempt to still the tremors that betrayed his apparent composure. Dark shadows under his

eyes, amplified by his unkempt stubble and overgrown hair, reflected a different man to the

one outlined in his service record - a man haunted and bewildered by recent events.

The room suddenly exploded into life as the door was kicked open and the aromas of strong

coffee and bacon rolls invaded the space. Coffees clutched in one hand, bakers’ bags in the

other and a manila file suspended from clenched teeth, the wiry frame of Francis Nordale

entered. He grinned around the folder as he kicked the door shut behind himself and mutely

proffered coffee and rolls to O’Donnell.

Nordale’s energy and practicality felt immediately reassuring. O’Donnell felt a sudden surge

of relief. Nothing had changed – that wasn’t possible – but Nordale’s presence somehow

signalled that normality – life - still existed after weeks of numbness and horror.

Nordale sat, fumbling with the case file and a small Dictaphone, then bit enthusiastically into

his roll. His eyes met those of O’Donnell, still holding his coffee and bag, untouched. “You

going to eat, then?” enquired Nordale, smiling encouragement. “I always find that I work

better on a full stomach – and don’t tell me that you’re not hungry, I can tell you’ve not been

in the right place to look after yourself.”

O’Donnell realized that he was, in fact, sick from hunger. Almost robotically, he forced

himself to bite into the roll, to release the tension in his jaw and throat sufficiently to eat.

Only after O’Donnell and he had both eaten and drank did Nordale break the silence.

“Now. Before we begin, I should make it clear that I do not think you’re crazy. I know you are

not crazy, however it might seem to others, or to yourself. Nothing you tell me can be more

outlandish or bizarre than other cases I have already seen – and the people who told me

those weren’t crazy either.” Nordale paused, smiled reassuringly. “Although I am an

investigator, I have no legal rights or jurisdiction. I am allowed to investigate these… cases,

precisely because no-one here gives me jurisdiction over anything! There are no penalties or

punishments for not answering my questions. Nor are there for admitting anything. But you

may just find that sharing with me what happened might be a relief. There are no trick

mirrors, no bugs – the only person listening here is me. I just need you to tell me what

happened in as much detail as you can – truthfully – however confusing, bizarre or

outlandish it seems.”

O’Donnell stared at him without speaking.

“Do you understand what I said? Do you have questions for me?” Nordale asked gently.

“This is for your benefit, really – just so you can get it off your mind. Think of it as being like a

confessional…”

O’Donnell nodded slowly, faintly, finally seeming to come to a decision. He dug deep into the

pockets of his combat trousers and fished out a small tin. Carefully stored inside it, wrapped

in fabric, were tattered pages from a notepad and a withered wildflower. His voice rusty from

disuse, he finally spoke to Nordale. “I’m going to need more coffee…..”



O’Donnell, I: Session one.

The wiper blades thrashed backwards and forwards against the driving rain. Muddy water

ran in rivulets down the windscreen of the truck each time the wheels hit a furrow in the road.

The wind seemed to have forced the damp outside in through the seams of the windows and

through the ventilation, so we felt scarcely any warmer or drier inside than it appeared

outside. Six hours of travel had exhausted conversation; we were a morose company that

travelled through the late afternoon towards the Cairngorms.

I glanced momentarily away from the road to look at the pale, drawn face of Marie, my sister-

in-law. “You OK?”

She nodded faintly. “Is it much further?”

“Another hour or so,” answered Bryan from the back seat, where he was huddled next to a

sleeping Richard.

I turned back to the road. I envied them their chance to rest. We had only just returned from

a tour of duty overseas and the last thing we needed was this ridiculous journey to the wilds

of Scotland. I had arrived home to a frantic phone message left by Marie, saying that David

was missing. To be honest, if that had been all it was, I would probably not have responded

– we were well used to him going off for days and sometimes weeks at a time, then rocking

up as if nothing had happened.

But this time was different: this time he had my nephew, David Junior, with him. In my mind,

he was scarcely out of nappies and, although David tended to idolize him and think he was

capable of any adventure, the lad was too young for his father’s hare-brained escapades… I

didn’t care that he was with his father: his mother was out of her head with worry and David

needed to treat her with more respect. As for Junior, he needed to be prepping for his

exams, not galivanting around the forest like a latter-day Indiana Jones.

Finally arriving in the car park of the rangers’ station after what felt like forever, we

scrambled stiffly out into the eternal rain and headed to the ranger’s office. The warmth was

welcome – but not as welcome as the sight of Alby - my brother’s dog - and the sound of his

excited whimpering. As I examined Alby under the guise of ear-tugs and tummy-rubs, I felt a

new sense of urgency rising inside of me: Alby was emaciated and filthy, his usually silky,

predominantly white fur was matted and bloody.

“Oh, you know this scruffy mutt, then?” the ranger enquired, laconically. “I was waiting for the

warden to take him to the kennels. It wandered in yesterday. Can’t have it molesting

wildlife…”

He was interrupted by Richard raising the latched entry and invading the ranger’s kitchen

area. When the ranger objected, Richard stared, stopping him in his tracks. He poured water

into a bowl, placed it in front of a grateful Alby, then stooped to peer in the fridge for dog-

friendly items.

Watching Alby devour a ham sandwich as if he’d never eaten in his life, I glared at the

ranger. “This dog belongs to my brother, David Donnell – the David Donnell who is out there

working for you lot. Did you at least see if anyone was out there?”

“Oh. That commission ended ages ago. I just thought he hadn’t checked in before leaving.”

The ranger shrugged, open-mouthed. “Happens all too often with these know-it-alls who

think they can do our jobs better than we ca…”



His words were silenced by Richard’s sudden grip on his shirt collar. “How long ago,

exactly?” he snarled.

“Um… um…” he stuttered. “Two weeks? Three? I’m not sure…”

“Iain – look at this.” Bryan, who had been gently examining Alby for injuries and coaxing

briars and other vegetation out from his fur and harness, held out the remnants of a notepad

that had been wedged between Alby and his harness.

The cover, once dark blue but now muddied and sodden, still bore David’s name. A few

pages remained inside – but as much as we needed answers, the pages were saturated and

would need to dry before we could read them. Bryan gently lifted Alby’s rangy frame and

cradled him in his coat, whilst Richard decisively escorted the ranger to his desk to verify

dates and details: we needed to find out as much as possible about my brother’s business

there and we needed to construct a timeline.

That being done, we headed for the cottage we had rented near Grantown. A log fire lit, a

newly washed and fed Alby snoring in front of it, and food warming, lifted our spirits

considerably. True, we hadn’t found David and Junior – but Alby’s return suggested that they

were still in the area.

Bryan’s efforts to recover information from the notebook indicated that it was David’s journal.

It also revealed that accompanying them was Daniel Booth, a zoologist from a southern

university.

Bryan used directory enquiries to acquire a number and rang. The call confirmed that he,

too, had not returned – but as he had applied for a sabbatical, that wasn’t entirely

unexpected and had not raised any alarm.

As we ate the hearty stew Bryan had brought from his freezer, we planned our course of

action.

“Well, the journal did mention that it should take them about six days,” Bryan stated. “And

the first entry was on March 1 st – so they are about two weeks overdue.”

Marie looked stricken. “But how could they be missing all that time and no-one know? It’s a

well-traversed area!”

I tried to reassure her. “Look, if one of them got injured, they would be seriously held up.

They couldn’t exactly call for help, could they? And they couldn’t log a route with the rangers,

given that their task was exploratory.” I paused, trying to mask my own anxiety. “Besides,

they know how to hunt and forage – they could survive for weeks out there…”

“The commission they were on was in an uncharted section of the national park anyway.”

Bryan explained between mouthfuls. “a section they’ve called “Aibheis”.”

“What the hell does that mean?” I asked.

“Abyss,” Richard said bluntly.

“Yes – abyss,” Bryan agreed. “I’ve recovered the majority of the information of the first two

days of their journey. They appear to have gone roughly fourteen miles into the section of

wood. But read this bit here, Iain.” Bryan handed me the diary with a marker indicating where

I needed to read from.



“…we made another discovery which has left all of us confused: early in the afternoon,

approaching a narrow gorge, Alby was alerted to something nearby and darted off. This was

sufficiently odd for us to react: unless commanded, he usually stayed glued to Junior’s side.

The way he was excitedly barking and scrabbling suggested that Alby was being summoned

by someone he recognised – but that was clearly impossible. When we finally caught up with

Alby, we found him digging eagerly at a humped mound covered by tussocks of coarse

grass. As we approached where he had scratched away the mud, there was a sudden thud

as a larger piece of turf fell. Beneath it, just visible, appeared to be a man-made structure;

this was no natural formation – that sharp corner could only have been created by the

careful placement of interlocking stones.

Birdsong was abruptly hushed. Our intrusion into their terrain had clearly disturbed them.

The short March afternoon was almost over. Failing light and the need to establish a camp

dictated that we must leave off further investigation. We set up camp hastily, abuzz about the

wonders that we might discover the following day…”



“So… they found something?” Marie asked, a glimmer of hope lighting her worry-dulled

eyes. “That explains it, they must be digging. Alby probably just got lost and they’re just

hoping he gets back to them.”

I stared at Marie. I felt awful about how my brother treated her at times. The worst thing

about it is that it’s not even intentional cruelty; he simply becomes so self-absorbed that he

doesn’t think about the impact on those around him. As messed up as it is, if he had been

hitting her, I’d know how to deal with him. But we’ve all tried to make him think about his

actions more and he’s never taken it on board.

I almost agreed with her hypothesis: however, the look on Bryan’s face suggested there was

something he didn’t want Marie to see. I didn’t have to wait long to get my answer as very

shortly after dinner Marie retired to her room, with the faint flicker of hope allowing her mind

to rest.

As soon as she was out of earshot Bryan pulled out another page and handed it to me. “She

doesn’t need to know this yet,” Bryan said. A much darker mood had taken over. “But if we’re

going in there we need to be ready.”

I opened the page; it was marked four days later than the second entry. Not all of the words

were legible, but the remnants weren’t words I wanted to see.



“…under any circumstance come to try find me or…”

“…I have allowed our son to fall victim to…”

“…me and I hope to see you again in the next life…”

“…brother, I know you….

“…sure Marie is okay…”

“…last stand will be tonight….”

“…DO NOT attempt to find… or the cairn…”



We all analysed these words for a long time. No one knew what to say; no one knew how to

describe how they felt.

“Is that all we have?” I asked Bryan.

“I’m afraid so, Iain,” Bryan said, downing his beer. “There are four days completely

unaccounted for. It’s your family, Iain, and I’m sorry I even have to say this, but we may well

be doing a recovery. Not a search and rescue.”

My mind was racing; I was too exhausted to process how much my life may well have

changed in the last twelve hours - but if I was going in there I needed to try to let it sink in.

“Last stand?” I said to myself, almost annoyed by the ridiculousness of the phrase. “He’s

dragged the boy out into the middle of God knows what. May have got him… killed? And

now is going to have some kind of last stand like he’s fucking Rambo?”

“Keep your head on, Iain,” Richard piped up. “We’ll get the answers we need.”

“I can’t ask either of you to join me on this, lads. If something really has killed them, I can’t

risk getting you two killed too.”

“You never ‘asked’ us to come up here with you, Iain. We just joined you because that’s what

we do.” Richard stood, staring me straight in the eyes, the flames reflecting in his. “If you’re

going in, we are too.”

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Iain’s face grimaced with remembered pain. “Richard should never have been out there with

me… should never have been in the forces, really – he just wanted to be around animals, to

work with them. And now I have robbed him of that chance…”

Nordale paused the recorder, giving Iain time to regain his composure.

Iain broke from the trance-like state in which he had been recalling the events.

“Take a break,” Nordale suggested. “Go and splash your face. I’ll arrange more coffee and

some food. Come back when you’re ready.”

Iain nodded quietly and wheeled towards the door. The hospital-issued wheelchair squeaked

constantly – a mocking reminder to the former soldier of all that had happened.

An hour later, Nordale was still sitting there, more than half-convinced that Iain had gone but

the morbid fanfare of the wheelchair’s squeaking could eventually be heard out on the

corridor, approaching the room.

The door swung open and Iain entered. “Sorry. Some prick hogged the disabled toilet for

ages,” he grumbled.

“Are you OK to continue? Or have you done as much as you can for today?”

“Let’s just push on. If I don’t tell you now…” his voice tailed off.

The implication was clear and Nordale was anxious not to miss the opportunity. He simply

switched the recorder back on and nodded assent towards Iain.



O’Donnell, I: Session two.



The following morning, we were up before the birds. All of us woke prematurely, still tired,

but subconsciously, after so many years of service, resuming the watchful alertness of being

on duty. This was an operation, not a holiday.

Bryan, Richard and I prepared the equipment we anticipated that we would need - and some

extras - with regimented precision. We were ready to depart even before Marie ordered us to

wait and breakfast before setting off.

Over bacon butties and hot tea, we assured Marie that we would work faster and safer

knowing that she and Alby were safe at the cottage. It was rented for the week and, if we

had not returned or contacted her by 1800 hours on the fifth day, she was to alert the

authorities on our behalf. This provision felt vital, under the circumstances.

After farewells, we drove the jeep to the rangers’ office where my brother’s expedition first

began. Somewhat to our surprise, the head ranger and two others were waiting for us.

Seeing our equipment and weapons, the ranger from the previous day was incensed. “What

do you think you’re doing?” he spluttered.

“I would have thought that was obvious,” I replied, calmly. “We’re going to find my brother.

Something you should already have been doing.”

He was about to add some comment when the chief ranger interrupted. His face and

demeanour suggested to me that he, too, had served in the forces. Although probably in his

fifties, his physique and alert expression suggested authority. “What regiment are you all

from?” he enquired.

“Royal Yorks,” I replied.

He smiled, extending a hand. “Scots Guards.”

After this momentary exchange of respect, he spoke quietly but insistently. “I am sorry that

you have had to resort to this. This is a lack of sense and duty I would not have expected

from one of my men.” He glared at the ranger, whose laziness and arrogance had abruptly

drained from him. “I am going to be as fair as I can be and allow you to go in – however,

without permits or a clear notion of your path, I’ll only permit this if Alastair, here, comes with

you.” He indicated a muscular, quiet young man with sandy hair and a thick beard. “He’s

knowledgeable about the area and can radio me if there are any problems.”

I examined Alastair for a moment, noting his backpack and bivouac tent. Clearly, he was

already prepared: this was not, it seemed, up for negotiation, so I simply nodded my thanks

to the head ranger.

We set off at 0800 hours, under grey skies, into the forest leading towards Abheis…

We set off, and within two kilometres it felt as though we had encroached upon a different

world. Any semblance of track beneath our feet disappeared; the tree canopy seemed to

close more densely above our heads; dim light and an unnatural stillness prevailed. Silence.

I strained my ears but could hear no birdsong; the dead leaves and pine needles strewing

the earth absorbed any noise our feet might make. The air felt stale, somehow, devoid of the

freshness of healthy woodland vegetation.

“Hear that?” Richard asked.

“What?” I asked.



“Literally anything that you would expect in a forest,” Richard replied. “Something is wrong

about this place.”

Strangely, not one of us disagreed or mocked his words…

We continued walking – or at some points scrambling – over the rutted, uneven ground.

Alastair was clearly no hindrance, being well acclimatized to the rough terrain, striding with

apparent ease between the trees. I recalled my brother’s comments about the man Booth

who was with them, and his slow pace. By the sound of it, they had not covered that much

ground on a daily basis so we would hopefully catch up with them soon.

Several hours later, however, absolutely no sign they’d passed that way. We saw no traces,

no accidental scrap of litter, no footprints, no flattened plants. Come to think of it, there were

few, if any, plants. Everything seemed to be smothered under a thick layer of dust – almost

like you might imagine volcanic dust smothering the features of the landscape close to an

eruption.

After a further two hours or so of strenuous walking, midway through the afternoon, we

paused for hot coffee, sitting on and around a fallen tree in a clearing, its dead roots

crumbling and hollow.

Bryan, on edge, turned to me. “We both examined the note-book last night, Iain – you know

none of this matches what your brother said.”

We exchanged concerned glances but said no more.

“Did I hear you just tell of a note-book?” Alastair enquired of me.

I hesitated before answering, but if Alastair was now a part of this, then he was probably

entitled to know what he was getting into. “Yeah – Alby had some of it. The dog, that is,” I

explained. “But this is so different to what he described, we can’t be in the same place.”

I fished the notebook out of my pack and showed Alastair David’s description:

…cover substantially more distance than the previous day. Aibheis was proving to be a gift

that kept on giving: the vast forest was spread out before us, and birdsong echoed from

every copse and break. A small stream ran down through a narrow, deep channel through

the heathers. It truly was a privilege to be one of the first to charter this natural wilderness.

Booth was finally in his element, having identified ptarmigan, capercaillies, and even

witnessing the low swoop of a female hen harrier. Every few metres, it seemed, Booth would

pause to exclaim over plants, mosses and lichens. Given that this was only day two, I was

concerned that Booth will consider the area too important to encourage more public

access…

As Alastair read, he glanced up and looked around him at the terrain, trying to find any echo

of my brother’s description in the land around us.

“We passed a stream, right enough,” he said, “but we’ve seen no sign of life otherwise.” He

shook his head, slightly puzzled.

I, too, was puzzled. From the ranger’s station it had looked like all the rest – teeming with

spring life, shooting plants and birdsong. We’d seen villages razed to the ground with more

sense of life than this.

“Come on: let’s keep going while there is still good light,” I suggested, and we resumed our

march, single file, Bryan and I leading the way, with Richard assuming his habitual place at



the back. Unfamiliar with our procedures and feeling a sense of responsibility for Alastair, we

kept him in the middle of our group.

As we continued on our way, we were strangely quiet – not just the quiet of concentration

and focus on the task in hand, but a quietness born of unease.

“Anyone else feel that we are being watched?” Richard laughed. Then suddenly, he barked,

“Take cover!” yanking Alastair back and to one side, as an unidentified mass fell from a

small, rocky outcrop of land to our side, on to the ground between us. As it landed, dust and

detritus billowed into the air and we were aware of a stale, foetid smell like nothing I had

ever encountered.

“What the…?”

“What is that?” Alastair asked.

We were looking at a tangle of dried hair, sinew, leathered skin and… hooves?

“The hooves are like… is that a deer?” I asked, incredulously.

Alastair stooped to examine it more closely. “Well. It was a deer. I think. But what the hell

has happened to it, I don’t know. It’s like, twisted, knotted – and that – is that – its guts?” He

pointed to where dried, leathery loops bulged through a split in the outer skin. “Just – how

did it get like that?”

We all slowly raised our eyes up rocks of the crag but there was nothing to indicate from

whence the thing had fallen.

Continuing on our way, we were all rather subdued. More than once, each member of the

party peered around but we saw nothing ominous. There was little conversation, however:

we were all too locked up in our own thoughts, too caught up in unspoken questions and

speculations.

Bryan made the call to make camp: he had been monitoring the level of daylight and the

position of the sun and thought we had probably only a good hour of light left. Setting up

camp was difficult as every time we put something down, dust erupted. Pegs were hard to

insert without further choking dust being stirred up and the miasma of dirt in the air made the

dimming light even weaker.



Richard was trying to build a fire from branches. True, we had a stove to cook, but the

cheery light and warmth of a fire would please us all. Alastair’s concerns had been noted

and dismissed: we knew how to control a fire safely, we weren’t ignorant townies!

He need not have worried. Every time Richard tried to pick up a branch, it simply crumbled

into smothering dust. Alastair – not without smugness – handed out head torches from his

pack.

We ate supper and drank some whisky, which inevitably led us into discussing past exploits,

regaling Alastair with exaggerated accounts of shared adventures and misdemeanours.



“How about you, Alastair?” Richard asked after a while. “Did you never fancy the forces?”

He smiled, wryly. “Thought about it, but I got into a spot of bother with the law.” His voice

was quiet, thoughtful. “We were just daft lads on a night out. Too much ale and not enough

sense – you know how it goes.”

I think each of us nodded in agreement: there but for the grace of God…

“Anyway, after a charge of criminal damage to a rich guy’s house and a cautionary couple of

months behind bars, Gordon – the chief ranger – took a chance on me. Never looked back.”

He downed his whisky, accepted another. “The dude whose house I damaged: turns out he

was a golf buddy of the procurator fiscal! Seems you should always check first who you’re

going to piss off, eh?” he laughed.

We joined him in that laughter and, on that cheerful note, readied ourselves to head to our

tents for the night. Bryan disappeared off a short distance to relieve himself and I made sure

all of our provisions were securely stowed away.

Bryan called out as he returned. “You need to see this. This can’t be the same one, but it

looks…” His voice tailed off, uncertainly.

“What? What are you looking at?” I asked.

“That’s the question….”

We walked over to where he was standing. As each of us turned our lamps towards the

mass on the floor, the light pooled over the dust-veiled husk of another deer. A deer

contorted into an impossible shape, its face a grimace of fear and agony, its abdomen split

and internal organs seemingly mummified.

Bryan knelt to examine it more closely, prodding at it with a stick, then turning its body over.

“Can’t see any gunshot. Can’t see any teeth marks. It’s like it’s just dried out so much it’s

split. Just seems odd, to find two like that. You’d expect the bodies to be predated,

scavenged…”

“Is that a burn mark?” Alastair asked, indicating a darker patch of skin.

“Dunno…. Never seen anything like it, to be honest,” Bryan responded.

Uneasily, we settled for the night. I don’t know about the others, but I was slow to sleep,

despite the exertions of the day.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Nordale spoke softly. “I hate to interrupt, but this mark – can you describe it to me?”

Iain shuffled in his wheelchair, adjusting his position, eyes downcast. His hand drifted,

apparently autonomously, towards his right thigh. The tremor in his hand was visible.

Nordale gazed at him steadily, his body language relaxed and unthreatening, but mentally

willing Iain to confide the truth.

Iain gulped down some coffee, now cold, and cleared his throat. “You know, I couldn’t tell

you the last time I didn’t feel exhausted. I can sleep for whole days, but…” His voice tailed

off. “The doctors can’t seem to give me any answers. Seem to think it’s psychosomatic…”

He looked off towards the corner of the room, forgetting Nordale’s question.

“The mark?” he repeated, quietly. “Tell me what it looked like, please, Iain.”



Iain, recalled to the present, answered. “About the size of a hand, I guess. Every corpse we

found had one…”

Nordale silently made a note on the pad in front of him. “An entry wound?”

“No. Just like… an imprint. Dark…”

“And you said, ‘every’ corpse, Iain. Roughly how many?”

Iain turned an anguished gaze towards Nordale. “Every…”

Nordale sat back, nodding acquiescence. He wasn’t ready to answer that yet. “Do you feel

able to continue?”

Iain didn’t answer, just continued his narration of the events.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I woke the following morning feeling drugged. I crawled towards the tent entrance yet

paused, one hand on the zip, as a feeling of uneasiness – threat? – assailed me. I crawled

out of the fug of my tent, knife in hand expecting morning freshness, yet the air was heavy,

polluted. I rapidly boiled the kettle on the stove, craving caffeine. Richard soon emerged,

equally on edge, glancing around warily as I proffered him a cup of coffee. “You look like I

feel,” I said.

“Couldn’t sleep. When I did, had weird dreams… Feel knackered,” he yawned, gulping down

coffee.

Bryan, similarly tired and on edge, grumbled, “So come on, then, what did you decide last

night? What did you find?”

We stared at him, bewildered.

“I heard you both talking – you needn’t pretend – but I wasn’t answering you nor coming out

at that time of night!” He glowered at us both, clearly annoyed.

“Bryan,” I answered, hesitantly, “neither of us called for you to come out. We were asleep.

We have both literally been awake for minutes. You must have been dreaming?”

“One of you shook my tent! I heard you calling me to come out! So if this is your idea of a

joke, you can bloody drop it!“

Alastair, clearly woken by our noise, also crawled out of his tent.

Bryan turned to him. “You must have heard them, your tent is next to mine!” he snapped.

“Unless you’re in on it…. Bloody whispering and calling half the night long…”

Alastair simply looked bewildered. “Bryan – why would any of us do that? Be reasonable –

sure, you must have been dreaming. Too much whisky?” he suggested lightly, turning to

rezip the doorway to his tent.

Bryan seized his shoulder, spinning him around so that he fell and had to scramble

inelegantly to his feet. “Don’t bloody patronize me, I know what I heard!” he yelled into

Alastair’s shocked face.

In the next instant, Richard was between them, squaring up to Bryan, who knew better than

to try to get past him. “Get a grip, Bry! Nothing happened!”



Bryan sat down sullenly, near the stove. I passed him coffee, but he remained silent and

morose, setting the tone for the morning.

We ate, packed up camp and set off once more, still in convoy, but with Bryan pushing the

pace so that although remaining in sight, he was out of earshot, clearly unwilling to

converse.

We walked throughout the morning, each of us focused on the march ahead of us,

constantly looking around us in search of anything that might inform our direction, anything

to indicate that David and his party had passed that way.

Alastair was concerned that he had somehow caused the dissent amongst us but I was

quick to reassure him that he was in no way to blame. “I don’t think I have ever known Bryan

to apologise,” I said, “but believe me, when he’s ready he’ll just drop it and carry on as

though nothing had happened.”

The words were hardly out of my mouth when Bryan turned and called back, “Alastair – can I

borrow your bino’s?”

Alastair quickly walked over to oblige him and Bryan stared through the binoculars fixedly for

a moment. He passed them back to Alastair: “Have a look – is that a bright colour at eleven

o’clock? Like – maybe the fabric of a tent?”

Alastair looked, nodded agreement and we hastened through the undergrowth in that

direction. We neared a small, natural clearing where a quantity of fabric lay puddled on the

ground, almost concealed from sight in a dip in the rutted land.

I ran ahead, breaking all of the procedures instilled in my head through years of practice, in

my anxiety to find any evidence of David or Junior. “David!” I yelled, stumbling into what had

clearly been a campsite. My eagerness was soon subdued by the realization that this was an

old campsite: no sign of life remained.

Worse was to come. The fabric of a second tent was wrapped and secured firmly around

what was distinctly a body-shaped mound.

I flung myself to my knees beside it and, with trembling hands, my heart thudding painfully in

my chest, I carefully unwrapped the head. Or what had been the head.

Like the deer, this was a contorted, desiccated… almost mummified, face, its mouth frozen

in a silent rictus. I heard Alastair gasp, horrified.

“Is that our boy?” Richard asked sombrely.

The face was unrecognizable, the brow discoloured by a blackish mark similar to that which

we had seen on the deer. I cautiously unwrapped the body a little further until I could see the

neck of a cagoule. The back of the collar showed the manufacturer’s logo. And a name tag.

Booth. These were the remains of the ill-fated naturalist…

I exhaled, the immediate anxiety for my family removed. But the fear returned almost

instantly. If this had happened to Booth, had the same fate befallen them? And… what had

transformed a living man into this empty husk? Nothing I had ever experienced or heard of

could make sense of what I was seeing, and I had seen far too many bodies over the years.

“Iain – take a look at this!” Bryan called out. He was kneeling by the coolbox. He had

removed its lid to find that it contained only a thick layer, some inches deep, of dust. The

wrappers, however, indicated that it had been food. Certainly, roughly three weeks could



have passed since they were here – but that could in no way explain this extraordinary

condition – not in a sealed cooling box – let alone explain the state of the body.

Alastair, his face white with shock, was turning on his radio with trembling hands. Although

physically strong, his role had never called on him to do more than caution inconsiderate

hikers. “I have to call this in! This needs the police – someone with more authority than us!”

he exclaimed.

We saw the power indicator on his radio flicker greenly for a few seconds – then fade to

nothing. No efforts on Alastair’s part could return it to action. “These were new batteries

yesterday,” he spluttered, confused. “They should be good for at least a week! That settles it:

with no radio, we need to head back to base and wait for assistance.”

“You can return, if you must. I’m not leaving,” I insisted.

Bryan and Richard, doubt on their faces, clearly thought that Alastair’s argument had some

merit.

“Can’t you see? The state of this – “I gestured towards the body – “David and Junior have

been out here so long already - I can’t go back – I can’t risk not staying and at least trying to

find them!”

“We have to regroup at the checkpoint,” Bryan reasoned. “Iain – I know what you’re thinking,

mate, but don’t be stupid. This is an operation. You know we have to regroup. The team

stays together,” Bryan quietly insisted.

Richard placed his hand on my shoulder in a mute gesture of understanding, then firmly and

insistently pulled me to my feet to start the return.

“Look, leave them a note in case they come back,” Bryan suggested. “Tell them, if they have

returned here, to stay put and wait for us.”

Reluctantly, but given no real choice, I did as I was ordered, then with heavy heart followed

them back on to the trail by which we had arrived. We left water and some dried rations

behind us. In case.

Sometimes I hate Bryan’s calm logic. I knew he was right: I also knew I wasn’t going back.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*



A knock on the door disturbed Iain’s account; Sergeant Emma Nicholls entered the room

and whispered into Nordale’s ear.

Nordale swore, as she left the room. “My apologies Iain, I need to attend to this matter…

would you be OK to come back tomorrow maybe? Same time?”

Iain shuffled in his chair, then nodded. “Uh… yeah, sure. I have time. I think…”

Nordale shook Iain’s hand and apologized again before leaving the interview room.

“You OK, sir?” Sergeant Nicholls asked.

“Yeah… just, his hand was freezing…” Nordale mumbled. He looked back down the corridor

at the former soldier lifelessly wheeling his chair out of the interview room.

First time I saw My SP on random shop. I literally didn't know her. But something clicked my inner self said "" She is the one "" 
She left the place. That moment I closed my eyes and Prayed.."" Hey Universe God..I wanna know her.. wanna meet her for once.. PLEASE 🙏 ""

April 2019
Few weeks later I received request on Instagram. when I checked profile she was the exact same girl I saw few weeks ago. She texted me "" Do we know each other ? "" 
I was shocked How on the earth is this possible ? 
We started talking ( not conversation but just talk ) 

July 2019 :First meet 
It was her last day in my city she was about to move to different city. Soo we met for coffee that evening n next day for breakfast. 
I was happy and felt amazing. Bcus god fullfilled my wish as I wanted to meet her. 

She moved to different city. Then I came to know she has Bf ( 3P ) they were in relationship for 5-6 yrs. Conversation was very rare as she moved to different city. I kinda lost hope. 

Then I came across law of Attraction 
It says "" Imagine person with you NOW..and Feel Good.."" that's it. 
I didn't know about other things. I was like ok. Let's do this fun activity as my end goal was to feel good inside. 

Soo I used to Imagine myself with her. Like at coffee shop. At bar counter. Having late night video call. Winter night walk holding each others hand. 
I denied all circumstances unknowingly. I wanted to feel good in that moment as she is with me. 
I did this fun activity for few months. 

Oct 2019
She decided to move to hometown. She moved to her hometown and Started living with 3P. Live in relationship. 
I kinda lost all hopes. I was like I am fooling myself. I am just day dreaming. Like idiot.
We almost lost all contacts. No text no communication. 
I decided to move on. I deleted all social media. All her contacts. 
I kinda moved on. 

Feb 2020 
Pandemic Happened.
I moved to my hometown . Then after that I got involved with my family. I forgot about her completely.
 I was like she is with her bf must be living happily together forever.

June 2021. ( After Two Years ) 
I moved back to city for my exams. 
I was like ok it's been two years let's get back to social media. I created new account in Sept 2021.

We met after 2 yrs. We started talking meeting over coffee breakfast lunch dinner. Things where completely different this time. 
She was the one who used to call text asking for dinner. 

Then one night she kissed me after romantic dinner date. She proposed me.We started dating. 

One moment something hit me hard. 
I was like wait a second.
Why does it feels like I have already experienced this things before ? 
Coffee ☕.. dinner.. winter night walk holding each others hand..

Then I realised.. omg It was all my imagination script playing out in reality. 
That's is MANIFESTION. 
Things I imagined once in my mind just for fun are playing out exactly as it is in 3D world.

Randomly tested a bunch of scents. 
There was Chanel Allure (meh), Dior Dune (I am still repulsed, no matter how much I want to like it), Dolce Vita (Seriously amazing peach accord wtf, I am kinda loving this). Lalique Soleil (oof) and Soleil Lunaire (seriously a lunar moon is such a stupid name, do these marketing people not even try anymore?! But the dark ombre bottle is pretty.)

And then I went home. Put my keys on the dresser in the hallway. Along with a used paper strip of one of those scents I tested. I threw the rest away as I went home. 

Fast forward to this morning when I go to make coffee and get hit by this amazing creamy sweet scent from the dresser... I didn’t think this could happen to me, but here I am. I need to go back, write what I tested on the strips and retrace my steps to find out who the culprit is.

March 2019
First time I saw My SP on random shop. I literally didn't know her. But something clicked my inner self said "" She is the one "" 
She left the place. That moment I closed my eyes and Prayed.."" Hey Universe God..I wanna know her.. wanna meet her for once.. PLEASE 🙏 ""

April 2019
Few weeks later I received request on Instagram. when I checked profile she was the exact same girl I saw few weeks ago. She texted me "" Do we know each other ? "" 
I was shocked How on the earth is this possible ? 
We started talking ( not conversation but just talk ) 

July 2019 :First meet 
It was her last day in my city she was about to move to different city. Soo we met for coffee that evening n next day for breakfast. 
I was happy and felt amazing. Bcus god fullfilled my wish as I wanted to meet her. 

She moved to different city. Then I came to know she has Bf ( 3P ) they were in relationship for 5-6 yrs. Conversation was very rare as she moved to different city. I kinda lost hope. 

Then I came across law of Attraction 
It says "" Imagine person with you NOW..and Feel Good.."" that's it. 
I didn't know about other things. I was like ok. Let's do this fun activity as my end goal was to feel good inside. 

Soo I used to Imagine myself with her. Like at coffee shop. At bar counter. Having late night video call. Winter night walk holding each others hand. 
I denied all circumstances unknowingly. I wanted to feel good in that moment as she is with me. 
I did this fun activity for few months. 

Oct 2019
She decided to move to hometown. She moved to her hometown and Started living with 3P. Live in relationship. 
I kinda lost all hopes. I was like I am fooling myself. I am just day dreaming. Like idiot.
We almost lost all contacts. No text no communication. 
I decided to move on. I deleted all social media. All her contacts. 
I kinda moved on. 

Feb 2020 
Pandemic Happened.
I moved to my hometown . Then after that I got involved with my family. I forgot about her completely.
 I was like she is with her bf must be living happily together forever.

June 2021. ( After Two Years ) 
I moved back to city for my exams. 
I was like ok it's been two years let's get back to social media. I created new account in Sept 2021.

Oct 2021. 
I received call from unknown number.
Guess what? It was SP.. she was like "" I am in the city where are you ? I was like ok I am the same city moved back few months ago. She was like ok let's meet. 

Nov 2021. 
We met after 2 yrs. We started talking meeting over coffee breakfast lunch dinner. Things where completely different this time. 
She was the one who used to call text asking for dinner. 

Then one night she kissed me after romantic dinner date. She proposed me.We started dating. 

One moment something hit me hard. 
I was like wait a second.
Why does it feels like I have already experienced this things before ? 
Coffee ☕.. dinner.. winter night walk holding each others hand..

Then I realised.. omg It was all my imagination script playing out in reality. 
That's is MANIFESTION. 
Things I imagined once in my mind just for fun are playing out exactly as it is in 3D world.

I just bought a DeLonghi Magnifica Start as a way of replacing our Nespresso due to the £300/yr subscription we had on it.

Just running some cheap supermarket coffee (£3.50/Sainsbury's) through it & wasn't overly impressed with the taste but at the same time didn't really know what it tasted like 'normally' (through my Mokka pot) so had no comparison.

So I tried out my costly (to me) coffee from a local coffee roasters (£12 per 250g). Set it on the coffee setting & it was just weak. Middle bean. Tried again on the espresso setting, middle bean once again & this was much closer to the taste of my Mokka pot & the actual local coffee shop itself (has a very unique taste I've not experienced in any other coffee shop in the country).

The original plan was Monday-Friday using cheap supermarket coffee & for the weekend using the expensive coffee, which is pretty much what I currently do, but that's where I ran in to the major issue - getting the old coffee beans out of the top so that there's not a mixture of beans.

The only way I could do it was take out the water tank, the tray & then upturn the machine & shake it in to a container. Very faffy.

**Which brings me to my question** \- is there a machine that allows the easy dumping of beans so you can switch to a different coffee when you want? Or do you basically have to finish what's in the container with ALL machines (unless you shake them out like I did)?



Side grumble - the top of the Magnifica has a picture of a spoon & says x1. So I thought you could only put 1 scoop of beans in there (which I thought strange). Thankfully YouTube showed me otherwise. Very poor from DeLonghi on that front.",0,1763983435.0,superautomatic,2,0.5,False

Some of you may know me by now as the owner of **The Flying Saucer**, a café & evening hangout in Birkirkara.

I’ll get right to the point - I am an Autistic adult and business owner.

Being on the spectrum influences how I run this business. It means our service is honest, direct, and free from unnecessary fluff. **I might not be everybody's cup of tea (or coffee), but for the right crowd, this place feels like home.**

A huge realisation over the last few months is that we have organically attracted a vast number of Neurodivergent (ND) patrons. It seems the ""no-mask"" nature of the space resonates with people who just want to relax without the pressure of social performance.

I am proud to see this growth. I want to openly encourage fellow neurospicy individuals who feel like an ""alien"" to know: **we are building a strong community, and you are safe here.**

**Upcoming Events:**

**Wednesday, November 26th – ND Entrepreneur Meetup at 7pm:** We are kicking off with a meetup for ND individuals in business or creative projects. This is a strength-based discussion, but also a safe space to discuss our unique difficulties and swap support strategies.

* **Special Guest:** We are partnering with **Meyn Energy** for this project, as the owner has ADHD and this cause is close to his heart.

**Future Plans:** We will be announcing a monthly meetup for fellow NDs to formally meet, unmask, and form connections in a low-pressure environment.

I'm back with a major update to Speakr (self-hosted audio transcription). For those who haven't seen it before, it's an Otter.ai alternative that keeps everything on your infrastructure.

This release (v0.5.9) is probably the biggest update since I started the project. The main focus was collaboration features since running it solo is fine, but most people wanted to use it with their team/friends/family.

You can now share recordings internally with specific users and set granular permissions (view only, edit, or allow them to reshare). There's also team/group management where you can set up auto-sharing rules based on tags. Like if you tag something ""Engineering Meeting"", it automatically shares with your engineering team. Each group can have its own retention policy too.

The other big addition is voice profiles. If you're using my WhisperX API implementation for transcription (instead of the previously recommended ASR companion app; see below), it now builds speaker profiles using voice embeddings. Once it learns who someone is from one recording, it'll recognize them in future recordings automatically. No more manually relabeling ""Speaker 1"" and ""Speaker 2"" in every meeting with the same people.

I also put together a [companion ASR webservice](https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/whisperx-asr-service) that runs WhisperX with the latest pyannote models. It's not production-grade, more of a reference implementation, but it gives you better diarization, improved time alignment, and enables the voice profile features. You can still use the originally recommended ASR webservice or OpenAI's API if you don't need those features.

I also added retention policies with auto-deletion. You can set recordings to auto-delete after X days, either globally or per-team. Individual tags can be marked as exempt if you have recordings you never want deleted. And there's markdown export that syncs to Obsidian/Logseq if that's your workflow.

Fair warning: this is a major release with schema changes. Definitely make backups before upgrading, and review the new environment variables since most features are opt-in.

If you're already running it, the upgrade is pretty straightforward with Docker (pull and restart).

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1p5eci3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p5eci3,Rancilio Silvia maintenance and upgrade project,"Work In progress.

This is a bit of a self motivational post - if I post then I kind of have to finish it.

Couple of months ago I [posted for some advice ](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1oato1z/looking_for_advice_fix_or_replace_silvia_5001000/)on whether to update or replace my v2 Silvia. After some excellent advice, and a little bit of diving down rabbit holes, I have decided to attempt to bring her up to scratch.

I bought my Miss Silvia v2 20 years back, imported from Italy to UK, and now lives in my kitchen in Poland. In that time, apart from occasional descaling and replacing the gasket twice, it's received zero love. I'm surprised it still works, to be fair.

So, I am going to ~~do~~ attempt the following (in no particular order):

1. Give it a good clean!
2. Replace the gasket, again.
3. Clean up and repaint the rusty chassis base (see photos).
4. replace the pump's mounting bracket.
5. Add in the butyl sound dampening
6. Replace the old steam wand with a v3 wand.
7. Replace the shower mesh in the brewer head with one with a countersunk screw.
8. ... and install Gaggi Mate.

In addition, I am pretty sure I will find a few other issues (like two of the feet have now just fallen off), which will need some work.

I hope to finish this before Christmas, in stages, so not in a rush as this is a bit of a low priority set of jobs. And it must remain functional throughout this period, as dealing with the 21st century without coffee is an unthinkable torture.

Any advice appreciated, wish me luck!

I’d love to get some advice on approach to building up a safety net as it’s something I’m really anxious about and I struggle to get on track with money. Also if you have any criticisms or feedback on what I can do to improve my position.

I want to build up a 3 month safety net - so for me this would be 9-10k. I have a decent salary (approx 63k annually) but my outgoings are pretty huge right now mainly I think because of childcare and kids, to where I’m actually losing 300ish a month from my savings. 

Current monthly expenses are:
600 mortgage
About 400 groceries
About 210 utilities
350 childcare
300 monthly train ticket
50 gym
Personal expenses - these only really consist of food that I buy when working in the office, though this can be coffees which I appreciate are a luxury and I’m trying to cut down. It also includes therapy which I consider an essential. I don’t really have any other expenses as I feel I can’t afford to buy anything for myself. This is about 250-300

These are my half of expenses which my wife also pays. I pay slightly more than her as I have a higher salary by 15-20k, but she seems to be saving so I think it needs to be balanced out a little bit.

I have credit card debt of £200, so not much. I pay at least £50-100 monthly. 

My salary is not the same every month as a big chunk of it comes quarterly as a bonus, but that seems to disappear quickly on ‘essentials’ for the house. I would say it’s usually about 2.9k after tax, should I see it as I should be able to save, but most months I find myself eating away at savings rather than increasing them. 

We have had a few big projects around the house this year which have drained my savings, but I still feel like I’m doing something wrong. I have a feeling it might be ad hoc spends which are causing the problem - like the need suddenly to buy something for the garden or house for storage which isn’t urgent, or desperately needing to buy a new table (recent example) where we could go longer without. I feel a little bit pressured about this as it’s mostly led by my wife and I can’t say no. I have raised this and she’s aware so hopefully understands I can’t keep doing it.

I can’t get a consistent period of saving enough to build up a safety fund and it’s making me anxious. I’m currently down to almost 3 figures in savings, which considering I’m a homeowner and have 2 small children is quite concerning.

Sorry for the lengthy post, would appreciate any help.",1,1763982585.0,UKPersonalFinance,3,1.0,False
1p5e9ws,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1p5e9ws/is_this_neuroborreliosis_doctors_deny_lyme_exists/,"Is this neuroborreliosis? Doctors deny Lyme exists, refuse treatment for years, destroyed my life – I look like I’m in alcohol withdrawal but I don’t drink","38M I am 38 years old. Since childhood I have been bitten by many ticks – practically every year, and scratched multiple times by cats.  
Anxiety started in childhood, then hand tremor appeared, later legs and eventually the head. I had fevers, severe and prolonged headaches and neck pain. My immunity was practically zero – drinking cold water was enough to get sick, or falling asleep with an open window – the same.  
Extreme reaction to stress: uncontrollable shaking and trembling of the entire body – it was enough for someone to just look at me and within a second my legs would shake like a drunk person. It happened at school, at the checkout, in church – everywhere, and it was deeply humiliating.

Years passed, doctors repeatedly refused to test me for Lyme disease (borreliosis), sent me away with nothing or prescribed antidepressants for years.  
I ended up in hospital many times with heart problems – they told me I was going to die, that my heart wouldn’t hold out, asked who to notify in case of death. The next day I was discharged with antidepressants again – and that was it, nothing else was done.

I did all possible tests to rule out essential tremor. One doctor asked about Lyme but didn’t test for it because earlier an infectious disease specialist had given me just one week of antibiotics.  
I had many tick bites, migrating erythema at the bite sites, and a positive Western Blot test for Lyme disease – 6 bands positive.

Doctors don’t believe in (chronic) Lyme disease. I have seen many neurologists and GPs – just mentioning the word „borreliosis” made them yell that „everyone has it!” and they did nothing.  
I was losing orientation – I would walk through the city for two hours on foot, then suddenly regain consciousness and have no idea where I was or why I was walking.  
I didn’t recognise my own mother’s face. Memory has been tragic since childhood – I can’t do 2 + 7 in my head without a calculator. I forgot how many years I had lived in a particular place, sometimes I didn’t know where I was in my own house.

A psychosomatic medicine doctor and a psychiatrist ruled out psychiatric causes. I fought with the psychiatrist that I don’t have depression – she sent me to a psychotherapist. He listened to me and explained to her that the only problem is that I cannot work because I have no control over my muscles.  
In stress I walked like a drunk, legs shaking violently – I looked like someone in alcohol withdrawal. Under stress, muscle tension or emotions the tremor was 10 times stronger. Sometimes I couldn’t use a computer mouse or type on a phone because my hands were shaking so much – but it is not essential tremor (as they suspected) because sometimes it almost disappears. It is always present to some degree, but essential tremor cannot disappear or improve and then suddenly get several times worse. After coffee it was a disaster.

They refuse to treat me for Lyme disease because a new IgM ELISA came back negative/within norms. I think these tests are not reliable at all and cannot rule anything out.  
One neurologist wanted to send me for a consultation before DBS (deep brain stimulation) surgery because he doesn’t know what is wrong with me – but for some reason neuroborreliosis terrifies them.

I have seen more than 7 neurologists: one said everything is fine, another Parkinson’s, another suggested I might be addicted to something, another essential tremor. Meanwhile I have been suffering every day for 38 years.  
I couldn’t catch parcels at the postal sorting facility – everyone thought I was drunk, but I don’t drink.  
I stopped all tremor and depression medications – they never helped anyway.

For the last 2 months I have been taking herbs for Lyme disease, Babesia and Bartonella – I clearly react (Herxheimer reactions), tremor gets much worse, heart beats irregularly, but when the Herx passes I sometimes see significant improvement – I can even walk better.  
I have been in many countries and always ended up in ambulances. In one hospital they removed 6 ticks from me – I begged for antibiotics, they refused. Six years ago in the UK I said it might be Lyme, the doctor replied that the bite was long ago, while I was writhing in back pain.

Memory is tragic – I don’t remember yesterday, I can’t orient myself in time – how long I have been somewhere: a month, a year, several years.  
When the tremor intensified I had extreme anxiety, panic, even auditory and visual hallucinations.  
Even without stress, in hospital I couldn’t walk straight – I looked like someone in severe delirium when going to the toilet. The staff looked at me with contempt as if I were a drug addict – antidepressants and end of treatment. Neurologists all said different things.

Now I am in Poland, but here they have even banned testing ticks removed from people „so as not to spread panic”. They don’t believe that neuroborreliosis/Lyme can be chronic.  
I feel like a person with a broken leg who is given antidepressants instead of real help.

In church it was enough for someone to look at me and my whole body shook – but for example today it didn’t happen. Sometimes it is there, sometimes not, sometimes extreme. Everything fluctuates – gets worse or better.  
For the first time in my life I found descriptions of people who had exactly the same symptoms as me – Lyme, or Bartonella, or Babesia, or all together – and after about a year of proper treatment (often 6 months to noticeable improvement) it went away. They also wrote that finally they can leave the house and be among people again.

I don’t know what to do – when I tell doctors, they don’t believe me, they think I’m crazy.  
Extreme fatigue sometimes lasted for years – after 16 hours of sleep I was still completely exhausted, had no strength for anything.  
In my medical records I have a positive Lyme test, I had migrating erythema and over 100 tick bites in my life.",1,1763982522.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1p5e9ue,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p5e9ue,V7 850 Touring in Winter,"Well, it started from the necessity of driving to a funeral in Bavaria while living just south of Luxembourg and the fact that my car was broken down and couldn‘t get fixed in time…but I have the pleasure of anouncing that yes, it is possible to make a trip of around 1300km in two days by negative temperatures on a V7 850.
Here is my return of experience :
- Windbuffeting : Not as much of a problem if you hide behind trucks or don’t drive over 110kph…but definitely a strain after two days of riding as my arms got a bit painful. A V85 would be definitely better suited for such endeavour.
- Cold : heated gripps are definitely a must. But beware, they don’t solve the problem completely and you will end up with cold fingertips whatever you do. I haven’t tried heated gloves, but I guess the problem will be the same, unless the heating components go all the way to your fingertips. A solution may be to use hand guards, but I used the excuse to regularly stop for some coffee.
They don’t make heated helmets, but there could be a market 🥶. I used chemically heated soles for the boots, they need air to heat properly, so next time I will invest in electric ones. 
- Salt : German highways are very salty. May be relevant for any other roads in winter, but some of the segments I had to take were literally white from it. When you arrive back home, don’t forget to thoroughly rinse your bike, whichever model it is.
On the way I had to also rinse my helmet because the salt dust had made it slightly blurry.
At last, suffering a bit from discomfort makes you feel alive, which fits the spirit of a purring V7 quite well.
Finally, to the Europeans amongst us, how fast is your top speed with A2 license version of the bike ? I thought it was 150 and got quite surprised to reach up to 162 on the gps. Is it may an effect of the cold on the injection ?",22,1763982517.0,MotoGuzzi,1,1.0,False

You're in the right place. The dental care market keeps changing, and there are some solid options available right now that actually work.

**What Makes Modern Teeth Whitening Kits Different?**

Today's whitening kits are way more advanced than the strips your parents used. Most newer kits use LED light technology combined with whitening gel to speed up results. The light activates the gel's ingredients, which helps break down stains faster than old-school methods.

The latest kits on the market typically include:

- LED mouthpiece devices that fit comfortably
- Peroxide-based whitening gel (usually around 10-35% strength)
- USB charging capabilities
- Treatment times of just 10-30 minutes per session

**Why People Are Switching to At-Home Kits**

Dentist visits for whitening can cost anywhere from $300 to $800. That's a lot of money. At-home whitening systems give you similar results for a fraction of the price. Plus, you can do it while watching TV or scrolling through your phone.

**What to Look For**

When shopping for a whitening kit, check these features:

- **Sensitivity protection** - Nobody wants painful teeth. Look for kits with ingredients like potassium nitrate that reduce sensitivity.
- **Easy application** - The simpler, the better. Complicated steps mean you probably won't stick with it.
- **Clear instructions** - You should know exactly how long and how often to use it.
- **Good reviews** - Real customer feedback matters more than fancy marketing.

**Where to Find Quality Options**

If you want to check out some of the newest teeth whitening products, [this collection](https://athomewave.com/teeth-whitening-kit) shows current options with detailed specs and customer ratings. It takes you straight to verified products so you don't have to worry about sketchy sellers.

**Realistic Expectations**

Most whitening kits can lighten your teeth by 2-8 shades with consistent use over 7-14 days. Results depend on your starting shade and what caused the staining. Coffee, tea, and red wine stains usually respond well to treatment.

Don't expect overnight miracles, though. Consistent daily use gives the best results. Most people start seeing changes after 3-5 applications.

**Quick Tips for Better Results**

- Brush your teeth before applying the whitening gel

**What I’m hoping to find:**

Someone who’s around during the day and wants a low-pressure, judgment-free spot to toss thoughts around. The kind of space where you can complain about a broken script, dissect some obscure article, or wander off into a rabbit hole that began with “Why does this even exist?”

I’m also hoping to find an accountability partner — or honestly, a gentle enforcer. If you naturally enjoy nudging someone to finish things, consider me extremely nudge-compatible.

If that sounds like your flavor of daytime companionship, here’s the rest:

**Who I am (and what I escaped):**

35M in Bangalore. A while ago I walked away from corporate madness — the managerial theatre, the politics, shithousery disguised as “collaboration,” and every little JTBD somehow being a deliverable due yesterday. Now I’m running a one-person setup where I’m both the boss and the only employee. Unsurprisingly, I’m not great at either role.

**What I** \***do\*** **miss:**

Fun colleagues. Water-cooler chats. Spirals into whether coffee after 4 p.m. is acceptable or a terrible idea (there is only one correct answer — there is never a wrong time for coffee). Debates about why Bangalore traffic deserves its own Nobel Prize category, deep dives into marine mammals, philosophy - do we have free will, and whatever else popped up — my ADHD makes me equally interested in everything, equally fittingly.

I’m putting together a playlist designed to create a relaxed, welcoming atmosphere for a mixed-age crowd — think college students all the way up to folks in their 50s. The vibe I’m aiming for is:
	•	Chill / relaxing
	•	A little psychedelic, ambient, or groovy is totally welcome
	•	Minimal or no explicit language
	•	Something you’d want playing at a coffee shop, lounge, or low-key hangout spot

I’d love help from the community to build this out.
What songs or albums do you think belong on a playlist like this?

Anything from mellow indie, downtempo electronic, ambient, soft psych, chill rock, soul, jazz, or global/folk stuff is fair game. If it helps, think: “music that makes everyone settle in and feel comfortable without putting them to sleep.”

1p5e4s1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vedalumen/comments/1p5e4s1/the_glitch_hunters_episode_1_the_duplicate/,The Glitch Hunters — Episode 1: The Duplicate,"The woman on the screen walked into the hospital at 09:17 a.m.

She was alone. Wind-tossed hair, dark blue coat, red canvas bag over her shoulder. At the sliding doors of St. Michael’s Medical Center in Chicago, she slowed to let an old man pass, smiled, nodded, then went straight to the elevators.

The time stamp in the corner of the footage held steady: **09:17:06**.

In the second video, the same woman unbuckled her airplane seatbelt at 09:17 a.m.

Different angle. Different lighting. Different city.

Gate C27, Denver International. She stood when everyone else did, blinking in the harsh cabin lights, reaching for the same red canvas bag in the overhead bin. A man behind her made a joke about turbulence, and she gave him the same quick, polite smile.

The time stamp in that footage was synced to NIST atomic time. So was the first.

Same woman. Same second. Two places.

Dr. Mara Imani watched both feeds on the wall screen, side by side, looping.

“Run it again,” she said.

Her assistant rewound with a flick of his stylus.

In Chicago, the woman passed under the camera bubble. The face-recognition overlay traced green bounding boxes around her features:  
**SUBJECT: PARK, ELENA MIN-SEO**  
**MATCH CONFIDENCE: 99.9984%**

In Denver, the overlay flashed the same data.  
**SUBJECT: PARK, ELENA MIN-SEO**  
**MATCH CONFIDENCE: 99.9987%**

“Genetic?” Mara asked.

The assistant, Quinn, tapped his tablet. “Swabs from both subjects processed independently at two labs. Full genome. They’re not just related. They’re identical down to rare polymorphisms.”

“Fingerprints?”

“Match.”

“Iris?”

“Match.”

“Dental?”

“Match.”

Mara pinched the bridge of her nose. Her headache had arrived ten minutes before she did, on the black sedan ride from the airport—an ache she’d learned to recognize as a kind of omen.

Glitches never came without a migraine.

“They weren’t separated at birth? No twin scenario?” she asked, more out of habit than hope.

“No record of a twin,” Quinn said. “Birth certificate lists one child. No adoption paperwork. Parents confirm she’s an only child.”

“And both claim to be Elena Park.”

“Yes.”

“Where are they now?”

Quinn hesitated. “One is in Interview Room Three. The other is in Neuro ICU. Car accident after landing in Denver. Mild concussion, some contusions, but she’s conscious and wants to know why DHS took her phone.”

Of course. Of course reality would choose chaos and paperwork.

Mara took a slow breath.

“Okay,” she said. “Let’s meet Elena.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The agency’s Chicago field office looked like any forgettable federal building: bad coffee, beige walls, fluorescent lights that hummed audibly once you noticed them. Officially it was the **Office of Cognitive Risk Assessment**—a name designed to bore curiosity to death.

Unofficially, they were the ones who got the calls when reality did something it wasn’t supposed to do.

Mara’s badge got her past three levels of security. Quinn trailed behind, flicking her a quick, nervous look as the last reinforced door hissed open.

Interview Room Three contained:

* One standard metal table bolted to the floor
* Two rigid plastic chairs
* A camera in the corner
* And a woman whose entire existence was a problem statement.

She stood when Mara entered, red canvas bag at her feet.

“Ms. Park?” Mara asked.

“That depends,” the woman said. “Am I under arrest?”

Her voice was steady, with a faint Chicago vowel stretch. She was in her early thirties, hair pulled back in a simple tie, face pale from lack of sleep. The anxiety, Mara noticed, sat in her shoulders rather than her eyes. The eyes were sharp.

“No,” Mara said. “You’re not under arrest. I’m Dr. Imani. This is my colleague, Quinn. We’re just trying to understand a…technical issue.”

“Technical,” Elena repeated, as if tasting the word. “Is that what it’s called when the universe duplicates you without permission?”

So she’d been told something. Good. Or bad. Depending.

“Please sit,” Mara said.

They did. A small recorder light blinked red at the center of the table.

“Elena, before we go further, I need to confirm some details,” Mara said. “Full name?”

“Elena Min-seo Park,” she said. “Born June 3rd, 1993, in Evanston, Illinois. Social begins 562-—”

Mara held up a hand. “That’s enough.” The details matched what she had.

“You work as…?” Quinn prompted.

“Senior data analyst at Viridian Health,” Elena said. “I help build risk models for hospital readmission. Before you ask, no, I don’t have clearance for anything classified or access to any biotech labs that might have cloned me as a prank.”

There was an edge of dry humor under the fear. Mara liked her already.

“Walk me through your morning,” Mara said. “From when you woke up.”

Elena’s fingers tightened around a paper cup of cold coffee.

“I woke up at 5:40 a.m., like I always do on flight days,” she said. “Checked my phone. No new messages. Showered. Put on this coat.” She tugged at the lapel of the dark blue wool. “Left my apartment at 6:20. Got a rideshare to O’Hare. TSA, coffee, boarding. Flight left at 8:00. Landed in Denver at…” She frowned. “9:14 local?”

“That’s correct,” Quinn said, checking.

“I waited for the ‘fasten seatbelt’ light to turn off. Stood up. Got my bag. Then half the passengers’ phones started pinging at once—alerts, notifications. People were saying something about Chicago.” Her gaze flicked up to Mara’s. “I didn’t know until later that I’d apparently walked into a hospital back home at the same time.”

She swallowed.

“I don’t remember the hospital,” she said. “I don’t remember leaving the plane twice. I remember one morning. One body.”

“You never blacked out?”

“No.”

“No moments of lost time?”

She hesitated.

“…Maybe,” she said. “There was one…strange thing.”

Mara leaned forward. “Tell me about it.”

“When the plane started descending, there was this…glitch,” Elena said. “The cabin lights flickered. I thought it was nothing. But for a second I had this feeling like…like when a video buffers on bad WiFi? Everything’s still, but you can sense it trying to move.”

She shook her head, frustrated at the inadequacy of language.

“It’s like my thoughts stuttered,” she said. “I was reaching for my water bottle, and my hand just…didn’t move. For a heartbeat. Or ten. Then everything snapped back, and we were a little lower, like maybe ten seconds had been skipped. No one said anything. The flight attendants kept walking. I figured I imagined it.”

“That’s all?” Mara asked.

“Well, I had a weird dream last night,” Elena said. “Does that count?”

Mara made a small go on gesture.

“I dreamed I was in the ICU,” Elena said. “But as a visitor, not a patient. There was…this sound, like machinery humming under water. I was standing next to a bed where…where I was lying. Same bruises I woke up with after soccer in college. Same scar on my wrist from when I was twelve. The me in the bed opened her eyes and looked right at me and said \`Which one of us is real?’ Then the heart monitor went flatline and I woke up. My alarm was going off. I laughed it off as stress.”

“Have you had déjà vu since?” Mara asked quietly.

Elena’s eyes widened.

“At the airport,” she said. “When I walked past a newsstand and saw my own face on a breaking news banner. That wasn’t supposed to happen to me. That happens to actors or criminals. Not risk analysts who still owe student loans.”

Mara noted the detail, though it wasn’t the kind she could write down: the specific shiver in Elena’s voice when the world betrayed its rules.

“Okay,” Mara said. “Thank you. We may need to ask more later. For now, I need you to know that there is…another Elena. Same name, same face. She’s stable, but injured. She was brought into St. Michael’s at the same time you were landing in Denver. She was hit by a car crossing the street near the hospital.”

Elena stared.

“She’s alive?” she whispered.

“Yes.”

“Can I see her?”

“Not yet,” Mara said. “We have to understand a few things first.”

“Is she me?” Elena asked. “Or am I her?”

The room was quiet except for the hum of the fluorescent lights.

Mara thought of all the neat, satisfying answers she did not have.

“That’s what we’re here to find out,” she said.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The second Elena looked smaller under the hospital blankets.

Same face, but with a purple bloom of bruising along the left cheekbone, a butterfly strip over the brow. Her hair was mussed, IV taped to one hand. The monitors traced calm, steady lines that beeped in slow time with her breathing.

She watched Mara with the wary focus of someone who knew too much had just happened to her body in too short a period.

“You’re the one from the video?” she asked. “From the airport?”

Mara blinked. “You’ve seen the footage?”

The woman shrugged one shoulder, then winced.

“The nurse had the news on,” she said. “It’s kind of hard to miss when you’re apparently headlining as \`Quantum Clone Woman’ now.”

Her nametag read **E. PARK**. Her chart confirmed the same birthdate, same address, same everything.

“Elena,” Mara said, “I—”

“Which one did you talk to first?” the woman asked.

The question hit with more force than any accusation.

“The…Elena who landed in Denver,” Mara admitted.

The woman’s jaw worked, as if she had bitten down on an invisible response and held it until it dissolved.

“Of course,” she said finally.

Mara frowned. “You…expected that?”

“Somebody always gets to be \`primary,’ right?” the woman said. “And somebody gets to be the duplicate, the error margin, the glitch. Makes sense you’d start with the one who made it to her meeting and didn’t get body-checked by a Subaru.”

Her voice was almost flippant, but her eyes were damp.

“I don’t see it that way,” Mara said carefully.

“I do,” Elena said. “At least my insurance will be a bureaucratic nightmare either way.”

“Can you walk me through your morning?” Mara asked.

“Sure,” the woman said. “I woke up at 5:40. Checked my phone. No new messages. Showered. Put on this coat. Different sweater, though.” She glanced down at the hospital gown draped over where a sweater would usually be. “I packed my red bag, called a rideshare, headed to O’Hare. Got to the airport, went through TSA, grabbed coffee at that place with the burnt croissants. Then…”

She looked toward the window.

“Then I realized I’d forgotten my laptop,” she said. “I never do that. I always triple-check. But I saw everyone else on the flight at the gate, remembered the time, and my stomach just dropped. I called a rideshare again and went home, grabbed my laptop, ordered another rideshare back. But the traffic was backed up on I-90, and by the time I got the notification that my flight was boarding, I knew I wasn’t going to make it. So I called my boss, told him I’d go straight to St. Michael’s instead of the conference. We have a pilot project there. I was crossing the street outside when…” She gestured vaguely. “Car. Air. Pain. Hospital.”

She turned back to Mara, expression sharp now.

“And apparently, in the version of me that didn’t forget her laptop, I caught my flight,” she said.

Mara felt her scalp prickle.

“You don’t ‘remember’ both,” she said.

“No,” Elena said. “I remember the panic of realizing the laptop wasn’t in my bag. I remember the curses. I remember the taste of the second bad coffee. I don’t remember descending into Denver.”

“In the other version’s story,” Mara said slowly, “she doesn’t remember forgetting the laptop at all. Her morning proceeds cleanly from flight to landing.”

“Yeah,” Elena said. “That tracks. She got the efficient timeline. I got the one with concussion.”

Mara scribbled notes.

Two divergent chains from a common origin point. A decision fork…except neither version felt like a deliberate choice. Just an error in packing.

“Did you experience anything unusual as you approached the hospital?” Mara asked. “Any sense of lost time, or things…stuttering?”

Elena’s brows knit.

“There was a crosswalk signal that seemed to flicker,” she said. “You know those little walking-man icons? It was lit, then I blinked and for a second it was like both red and white at once. Like my brain couldn’t decide if it should say stop or go. Then someone bumped into me, hard, from behind, and I stepped into the street without looking as carefully as I usually do.”

“A glitch,” Mara murmured.

“Is that the official term?” Elena asked. “Feels right.”

“Did you have any unusual dreams last night?” Mara asked.

Elena went still.

“Yes,” she said. “Weird question.”

Mara waited.

“I dreamed I was on a plane,” Elena said softly. “Descending into Denver. But the cabin lights flickered, and everyone froze. The woman next to me was mid-laugh, but there was no sound. It was like being in a photograph that knew it had been paused. And then…” Her voice faltered. “I saw myself stand up. I mean—that doesn’t quite make sense. I was both sitting and standing. The me who stood looked down the aisle and saw…something. A wall of static? White noise made solid? And then she walked forward and disappeared into it. I woke up to my alarm after that. Thought maybe I needed to stop doomscrolling before bed.”

Mara’s chest tightened.

One dream from the perspective of the visitor, looking at herself in a bed.

The other from the perspective of a passenger watching herself step into static.

Both dreams tied to the other version’s reality.

Symmetrical, like two mirrors trying to remember each other.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Back at the field office, Mara spread both timelines across the smartglass table.

Blue for Denver-Elena. Red for Chicago-Elena.

The first thirty-two minutes of their day were indistinguishable. Same alarm tone logged via smart speaker. Same playlist. Same shower duration. Same heart-rate pattern on the wearable band. Their phone’s step counters marched in perfect sync until **06:12:15**.

At 06:12:16, the data diverged.

In the blue timeline, Elena’s calendar reminder for “Laptop – CHECK AGAIN” popped up, and she dismissed it with a thumb swipe.

In the red timeline, there was a brief gap—half a second where the accelerometer and gyroscope data from the phone registered no movement at all. A microscopic freeze-frame.

Then the reminder never appeared. No alarm in the logs.

Blue-Elena checked her bag twice. Red-Elena didn’t.

Mara pinched out the view, watching the two paths fork and branch into:

* Rideshare A vs. Rideshare B
* Coffee stand vs. coffee stand
* Gate C27 vs. highway shoulder
* Denver International vs. St. Michael’s crosswalk

Reality as version control. One tiny missing dialog box cascading outward.

“Someone fat-fingered the save,” Quinn muttered, watching the divergence.

Mara rubbed her temple.

“Any chance this is a hack?” she asked. “Overlayed data feed, some kind of elaborate identity theft? We’ve had deepfake composite cases before.”

“Already checked,” Quinn said. “Our internal audit found no tampering in the logs. The biometric data is live-captured. DNA was tested twice. Airport footage came straight from TSA servers; hospital footage pulled from their internal system. The time stamps all sync with the atomic clock. If this is a hack, it’s one that rewrote literally everything at the physics level, including two human bodies. At which point I think we’re back to calling it a glitch in reality itself anyway.”

Mara grimaced.

“Legal is going to have an aneurysm,” she said.

As if summoned by the thought, her secure tablet buzzed with an incoming memo. She scanned it quickly.

“Speaking of,” she said. “The Department of Identity Assurance is very interested in not having two legally identical citizens walking around. They’d prefer a clean resolution. Their words, not mine.”

Quinn snorted. “Sure. We’ll just ctrl+Z one of them. Easy.”

Mara stared at the blue and red lines.

In previous glitches, there had been…

What? Objects that didn’t obey conservation of mass. Streets that looped on themselves for an hour. A commuter train that arrived at its destination twelve minutes before it left.

But those anomalies had been…impersonal. Weird, frightening, sometimes deadly, but not intimate.

Two Elenas was different.

This was continuity torn.

“What are the protocols?” Quinn asked quietly.

Mara knew them by heart. She’d helped write them.

**In the event of identity duplication with full biometric match:**

* **Assess for anomaly containment priority.**
* **Determine which instance has more consistent continuity with pre-glitch records.**
* **Designate primary.**
* **Arrange secondary for secure relocation or, in extreme cases, humane termination.**

She swallowed.

“Non-binding guidelines,” she said. “We’re not obligated to follow them if the anomaly is still in active flux.”

“You think it is?” Quinn asked.

She zoomed back in to 06:12:16.

That half-second void in the data stared back like a pupil.

“I think…something happened here that isn’t done with us yet,” Mara said.

On the corner of the glass, a notification blinked. She tapped it.

A graph popped up. Two EEG traces—one from Denver-Elena’s preflight medical check six months ago, required for corporate travel clearance. The other from Chicago-Elena’s ICU scan, taken an hour after the accident.

The pre-glitch patterns overlapped almost perfectly. Post-glitch, the ICU data showed alterations in several high-frequency bands.

Quinn leaned closer.

“Look at that gamma activity,” he said. “She’s more synchronized across hemispheres than ninety-nine percent of baseline scans.”

“That’s not the weird part,” Mara said.

She overlaid a third trace—a real-time feed.

“What’s that?” Quinn asked.

“Denver-Elena,” she said. “They put her in a voluntary research study after she agreed to cooperate. She’s wearing a portable EEG cap in our Denver office right now. Go back ten seconds.”

The graph rewound.

“We see reactive spikes here,” Mara said, pointing. “In blue, that’s the Denver instance responding to a visual stimulus—a series of flashing images. But see this red echo, thirty milliseconds later? That’s Chicago-Elena’s live ICU EEG. She’s resting. No stimulus. Yet her brain patterns are…mirroring.”

“Cross-brain correlation?” Quinn asked weakly. “Across nine hundred miles?”

“Non-local coupling,” Mara said. “At a magnitude that should not be possible.”

“You’re telling me their brains are entangled.”

“I’m telling you the word ‘entangled’ is starting to show up in my notes more often than I find comfortable,” she said.

She let the data play forward. Stimulus. Response. Echo.

Two people.

One nervous system, stretched thin across space.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The next day, with a dozen signatures and three layers of oversight, they granted both Elenas a single carefully controlled video call.

It was, according to protocol, a risk.

Shared information between duplicates could create…feedback.

But Mara argued that they couldn’t ethically keep them in the dark about each other’s existence. And, quietly, she wanted to see what would happen when two threads of continuity looked each other in the eye.

They set up the call in a secure room at the Chicago office. Chicago-Elena sat at the table, hospital wristband still on. On the screen, Denver-Elena appeared in a similar room, EEG cap like a strange metal crown on her head.

They stared at each other for a long, wordless moment.

“Hi,” Denver-Elena said finally.

“Hi,” Chicago-Elena replied.

Hearing her own voice from outside her body made her flinch.

“This is weird,” Denver said.

“No kidding,” Chicago said.

Mara sat off-camera, watching the EEG feed. Both lines trembled, then rose in uncanny synchrony.

“What’s the last thing you remember from being the same person?” Denver asked.

Chicago considered.

“The airport,” she said. “Standing at the departure board. You?”

“The plane cabin,” Denver said. “Descending. Everything froze for a second, then…moved.”

Chicago closed her eyes. “I didn’t make it to the gate.”

“Yeah,” Denver said. “I did.”

“I forgot the laptop.”

“I didn’t.”

They opened their eyes together.

“Do you feel like you’re…you?” Chicago asked.

“Yes,” Denver said. “You?”

“Yes,” Chicago said. “But also no. Like I’m half a sentence that keeps expecting the other half to catch up.”

Denver nodded slowly. “Same.”

They both laughed, a small, brittle sound.

“Do you remember the dream?” Denver asked.

“ICU?” Chicago said. “Yeah. You?”

“The plane,” Denver said.

Silence again. The EEG traces braided.

“Do you—” they both started, then stopped, then laughed again.

“You go,” Chicago said.

“Do you want to be…you, if I’m also you?” Denver asked. “I mean. If we can’t both keep the name, or the job, or the life—”

“Don’t,” Chicago said sharply. “Don’t start with scarcity. We didn’t ask for this.”

“I know,” Denver said. “But the world has forms. Systems. Boxes that only fit one person.”

“Then change the boxes,” Chicago snapped. “You’re good with systems.”

Denver blinked. “We’re good with systems,” she corrected gently.

Chicago’s jaw softened. “Right.”

On the EEG, both gamma bands surged.

“Ms. Park,” Mara cut in quietly. “Both of you. We have to consider practical implications, yes. But I want you to know something.”

Both heads turned toward the hidden camera, as if they could see her on the other side of the glass.

“You are both real,” Mara said. “You are both continuous streams of experience. Whatever happened at 06:12:16 did not make one of you fake. It made both of you…new. And as long as I’m lead on this file, no one is going to treat either of you as an error to be deleted.”

She hadn’t rehearsed that. The words came from somewhere deeper than professional oath, from the part of her that had been quietly terrified since the first time she saw a train arrive before it departed.

“Thank you,” Denver-Elena whispered.

Chicago-Elena’s eyes shone, but she tilted her chin up. “You say that now,” she said. “Wait until the lawyers show up.”

“They already have,” Mara said. “They’ll have to adjust.”

Quinn, watching from the booth, gave her a side-eyed look that said: That was not regulation language.

She ignored him.

On the screen, the two versions of Elena exchanged tentative smiles.

“Hey,” Denver said. “At least if I forget my own birthday now, I can call you to confirm.”

“Yeah,” Chicago said. “And if one of us dies, the other can keep the therapist bills going.”

“Dark,” Denver said, but she laughed.

“Realistic,” Chicago countered.

The EEG traces settled into a pattern that the algorithm flagged as **highly coherent**.

Two minds.

One shared waveform.

Three days later, a black car arrived outside the field office.

It carried a man with a government smile and a folder full of words like **canonical** and **consolidation** and **resource risk**.

In the conference room, he spread out his papers and made his case:

* Two Elenas were a liability.
* Identity frameworks weren’t built for this.
* Financial systems, health records, social contracts—insert any structure; it broke in duplicate.
* The longer both existed, the more edge cases would multiply.

“We are not designed to handle forks,” he concluded. “One of these instances has to be designated preeminent. The other must be…discontinued.”

“Like a product line,” Mara said.

“Like a redundant instance,” he said. “I’m sure you understand; you’ve worked on server clusters.”

“These aren’t servers,” she said. “They’re people.”

He spread his hands.

“Some realities are unsustainable,” he said. “Our job is to restore consistency.”

She opened her mouth, then closed it.

Consistency. A comforting god that accepted any sacrifice.

“What if the anomaly isn’t static?” she asked. “What if their continued co-existence is part of an ongoing event?”

“Dr. Imani,” he said mildly. “The glitch is over. We have two stable citizens. Our task is to collapse the wavefunction back to one.”

She thought of the EEG traces. The mirrored dreams. The half-second of frozen data that felt less like an end and more like a beginning.

“You’re sure the glitch is over,” she said. “I’m not.”

He sighed.

“Be practical,” he said. “Which instance has smoother continuity? The one who made her scheduled flight, or the one whose day diverged from every known record of her itinerary? From a probabilistic standpoint, the Denver instance is more consistent with the world as it ‘should’ have been. Chicago-Elena is the anomaly.”

She wanted to say: The world as it “should” have been according to who?

Instead, she said nothing.

“File your recommendation by Friday,” he said, gathering his papers. “We’ll move forward from there.”

When he was gone, the room smelled faintly of cologne and something else: ozone, like the air before a storm.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

That night, Mara sat alone in her apartment, lights off, city glow filtering through the blinds.

She had the two timelines open on her home tablet. Blue and red, looping. She could feel the pressure in her head like a barometer dropping.

Her career had been built on investigating ruptures in reality and then—what?—helping stitch them closed. That was the brief. That was the story she told herself about why her work mattered.

But somewhere between the frozen street and the duplicated woman, the story had started to fray.

Her phone buzzed.

Unknown number. Secure line.

She answered. “Imani.”

“It’s me,” said a voice. “Well. One of me.”

She recognized it instantly.

“Which Elena is this?” she asked.

“Chicago,” Elena said. “Don’t worry; I didn’t hack anything. The nurse owed me a favor to dial out. I just…I needed to ask you something before you make your report.”

Mara closed the timelines, suddenly ashamed to have them open while talking to the person they represented.

“I’m listening,” she said.

“If you had to choose,” Elena said, “purely personally, putting aside the systems and the forms—would you pick the version who made the flight, or the version who forgot her laptop and got hit by a car?”

Mara exhaled.

“Elena, that’s not a fair—”

“I know it’s not fair,” Elena said. “None of this is fair. I just…if one of us has to be turned into paperwork, I’d like to know if I was, at least for a moment, someone’s first draft of reality or just the cosmic typo.”

There was a harsh little laugh under the words.

“Listen to me,” Mara said. “You are not a typo. Neither of you is.”

“That’s not an answer,” Elena said.

“No,” Mara agreed. “It’s not.”

She looked out at the city, at a hundred thousand windows hiding a hundred thousand private improbabilities.

“The truth?” she said. “If I had to pick, I’d pick both.”

“That’s a cop-out,” Elena said gently.

“That’s the only honest answer,” Mara said. “You both have memories, pain, preferences, bad jokes. You both make faces when the coffee’s too bitter. You both breathe. Whatever ‘mistake’ reality made, it didn’t make you less real. It made my job impossible. That’s not your fault.”

On the line, she heard Elena take a shaky breath.

“Can you…bend it?” Elena asked. “The job. The rules. For once. For us.”

Mara thought of the man in the suit speaking about wavefunction collapse like a technicality. She thought of the EEG traces refusing to stay separate, pulsing in tandem no matter what the models said.

“I can try,” she said.

“And if you can’t?”

Mara hesitated.

“Then I’ll tell you the truth,” she said. “Even if it costs me my clearance.”

“Thank you,” Elena whispered.

The line clicked dead.

Mara put her phone down slowly.

Her headache pulsed like a second heartbeat behind her eyes.

She opened a blank report.

Under **RECOMMENDATION**, she began to type.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Three weeks later, a quiet note landed in her secure inbox.

>**SUBJECT:** PARK, ELENA MIN-SEO — RESOLUTION

>Per your recommendation and following multi-agency review, both instances have been placed under the **Parallel Identity Accommodation Protocol (PIAP)**, provisionally.

>LEGAL STATUS:  
– Denver-Elena retains full legal identity as ELENA PARK.  
– Chicago-Elena assumes legal identity as MIN-SEO PARK, with a new SSN and amended records, cross-linked but encrypted.

>Both instances will remain under observation. Further anomalies may require revision.

Mara read it three times.

She’d argued, in forty pages of careful language, that:

* The duplication event had not fully resolved.
* The non-local coupling suggested an ongoing phenomenon.
* Deleting or terminating one instance could have unpredictable cognitive and physical consequences on the other.
* The ethical risk of erasing a conscious stream of experience outweighed the bureaucratic inconvenience of accommodating it.

It had been, in places, less a report than a plea.

Somehow, it had worked.

Or perhaps the universe was simply in too much flux for anyone to pretend they could tidy it up with a memo.

She forwarded the result to both Elenas, through official channels.

Then she opened the latest EEG graphs.

The coupling persisted.

When Denver-Elena watched a video of ocean waves, Chicago-Elena’s pattern rippled in tandem, though she was reading a book.

When Chicago-Elena laughed at a joke her nurse told her, Denver-Elena’s gamma band spiked as if someone had told the same joke in another room.

Two streams.

One field.

“Maybe we’re the glitch,” Quinn said, looking over her shoulder.

“What do you mean?” she asked.

“Maybe reality was always like this,” he said. “Entangled minds, branching paths, superposed ‘what-ifs.’ And we’re just now starting to notice where the seams show. We call it a glitch because we thought the program was cleaner than it is.”

Mara considered that.

Her migraine eased, just a fraction.

On her tablet, an alert popped up: **NEW ANOMALY — PRIORITY TWO**.

Subject line: **TEMPORAL LOOP – URBAN BLOCK, PHILADELPHIA — “THE FROZEN HOUR”**

She clicked it open.

Doorbell cameras. Body cam footage. Security systems.

An entire city block reliving the same hour, over and over, before time lurched forward again.

Her stomach turned cold and electric.

The Glitch Hunters had another case.

She pulled up a new file, labeled it with the date and location, and then, without really knowing why, added a small subtitle under the case number:

>**NOTE: Observer continuity appears to be emerging as a key variable.**

She saved the file.

Outside her office, the world went on—planes landed, alarms rang, people forgot laptops and didn’t, streets flickered between walk and don’t walk.

Inside her headache, a thought formed, clear and quiet:

Maybe glitches weren’t just the universe breaking.

Maybe they were the universe…learning.

And someone, somewhere, watching very closely, was starting to wake up.

I am a 28 year old, woman living in the lovely city of Munich. I raised in Germany but my routes are Greek, so I sometimes feel like culturally not belonging neither there not here. I can say that I feel most comfortable expressing myself in german but English and Greek are a strong second. In spanish I only can say the basic things but I would be open to practice if someone prefers that language. 

In Munich I like to walk through the street, grap a coffee and some chocolate and sit in a cosy cafe to read a book. I like novels, modern classics and everything that either uses flattery language or has a deep meaning. Ok books with pro twist are also very fun to read. My favorite authors are Carlos Ruiz Zafon, George Orwell and Juli Zeh. Apart from that I am a huge lover of art and history.  I like to go to Museums, visit art galeries and explore the hidden corners of a place. I like traveling and sight seeing. I always get in love with the places I visit when I stayed  long enough and even such rainy and Beton build places like Glasgow have a place in my heart. 

Normally I am a summer girl, I like the sun and warmth weather, when everyone sits outside, dances in the park and swims in the river. I love Hiking and I trie to go almost every weekend when the weather is good. The mountains are nearby aber the nature is soothing an calming. I like small paths, deep abysses and the feeling of adrenaline. I like sports and I try to be a sporty person even if I don't feel like it compared to other people. I also like martial arts and dancing and do it on a regular basis, especially in winter when the weather is not suitable for hiking. 

I am also interested in philosophy and psychology even if I dont have deep knowledge in neither of the fields and I also don't have consciously choosen a way of life. You might things I am a person of arts by now but I can be analytical as well. I studied data science and I can be very calculated and fact based when I need to make a decision, but I also know how easily mistakes can be done in statistics so I am kinda balanced in my approach.

I would love to write to someone letters and postcard. I like long letters and  deep thoughts but also light postcards and funny jokes. I can write a letter once a month and I would like this to become something long term, but let's exchange a couple of letters and see where this goes.

The other day I was poking around my ISP’s captive portal. Captive portal is that page that pops up when you connect to university wifi, or airport wifi and prompts you to login in order to access the internet. Now my ISP uses that same trick to charge for wifi. When you connect, your MAC address is checked against a database to see if have a subscription. If not, you are taken to the payment page where you select the plan you want.

Three months subscription goes for Kshs 5300, a month for 2000 Kshs. The subscription packages are stored in the database and to get them a GET request it sent to `/getSubscriptionpackages`. It comes back as JSON.

In that JSON, each package has an **id** field. What happens when you try navigating to `/getSubscriptionPackages/{id}/`?. Now the API returns only one package with the id you specified.

You can see a cost field in the response

Months earlier I had found another issue in the same ISP and reported it and got some cash for coffee. I reported this one on Friday. They fixed it today.

Now, the whole purpose of sharing this isn’t to flex. It’s to nudge web developers to think beyond the happy path. When building an API, always ask:

Who is allowed to access this endpoint? What operations should be allowed on this resource?

The ISP’s biggest mistake was permitting PATCH, PUT, and DELETE on an endpoint that should have been read-only.

I don't think it's pulling too bad. I'm not that into espresso to go out and buy scales etc to assist but will rather go off of how long it's taking to pull through and the taste it produces. I do use a WDT before tamping.

If I grind finer it sputters loads and if I grind more coarse the water pisses through so I believe I've found the optimal for the beans at their current age (3 weeks after roast, it's steadily got finer over the last 2 weeks).

Северная Европа по-прежнему остается глобальным центром кофемании. Люксембург возглавляет мировой рейтинг с показателем 5,31 чашки в день на человека — значительно опережая более крупные экономики.

Показатель Люксембурга объясняется наличием огромного числа «кросс-бордеров» — людей, работающих в стране, но живущих за ее пределами. Почти половина всех работников (47%) проживают за границей, и их ежедневное потребление кофе учитывается в статистике Великого Герцогства.

Близко следуют давно известные своей сильной кофейной культурой Финляндия и Швеция. Все десять стран-лидеров рейтинга являются европейскими, что отражает как исторически сложившиеся предпочтения, так и высокую покупательную способность.

Несмотря на значительные абсолютные объемы потребления, такие крупные страны, как Соединенные Штаты, Япония и Бразилия, занимают в расчете на душу населения гораздо более низкие места.

США со средним показателем 1,22 чашки в день находятся на 24-й позиции. Япония, с ее процветающей сетью кофеен и культурой кофе в банках, в среднем выпивает чуть меньше одной чашки в день. Бразилия — крупнейший в мире производитель кофе — располагается в середине списка, на 18-м месте, с 1,58 чашки в день. Россия занимает 46-ю строчку рейтинга с показателем 0,5 чашки кофе в день.

В нижней части рейтинга расположились страны, где в повседневных привычках доминирует чай или другие напитки. Индия фиксирует самый низкий уровень потребления — всего 0,02 чашки в день, что эквивалентно примерно одной чашке каждые семь недель. Несколько африканских и южноазиатских стран также демонстрируют низкие показатели, как правило, употребляя менее 0,3 чашки в день.",2,1763981301.0,Popular_Science_Ru,2,1.0,False

I measured the distance between the group gasket and the shower screen, and that distance is around 10 mm. So I assume that to prevent the puck touching the shower screen, I need at least 10 mm headspace in the basket.

I've experimented with doses and actually measured the headspace in the basket as well. 16g gives me around 12 mm head space, i.e. a little room for puck screen + extra space for when the coffee expands once wet. Indeed, dosing above this results in contact even when dry.

Here's the thing: I'm using an 18-20g basket. Even at the low end of that range, I don't have enough headspace to avoid collision with the shower screen. I've tried several different coffees (for dark roasts the recommended range is 17-19g, for medium 18-20g), and still have had little success. Shots are running very fast (4-6g/s depending on grind), and I've experimented with different grinds from choking-the-machine fine and upwards i.e. even at fine grinds I'm unable to get a nice 1g/s flow rate. This sorta makes sense because I'm dosing below the recommended 18-20g, but how can I up my dose without crushing my puck into the shower screen?

Do I just need to get a bigger basket and dose below the recommended dose for the basket? Is this a known thing with GCs?

I posted here a little while ago about organising small group meetups in Perth and got surprisingly good feedback and a fair bit of interest. That response made me realise that creating an app to properly support this might actually be viable, so I’ve moved forward with building it - and now I want to sanity check what I’m doing, especially with locals who would actually use it (or not).

**The problem I’m trying to solve:**  
\- A lot of people here want to meet others / try new things / get out and do stuff, but organising it is a pain  
\- Group chats die, people flake, or it turns into something awkward  
\- Most apps are either dating apps, giant public events, or endless “we should catch up sometime” talk with no action

**What I’m building:**  
\- Small groups only, around 3 to 6 people meeting up for normal stuff: coffee, walks, hikes, runs, desserts, casual lunches / dinners, etc.  
\- Activity first, not profile first. You join a specific activity at a specific time, rather than swiping endlessly on people.  
\- Very roughly, think Tinder style swiping but instead of swiping on people, you’re swiping on activities / meetups.  
\- Perth only to start. The whole thing is designed around actually filling a limited number of local meetups instead of scattering people everywhere.  
\- **Not a dating app** \- the goal is to make it easier to do things and meet people in a low pressure way, not find a partner.  
\- For the first version, meetups are same-gender groups (men with men, women with women) to keep it feeling safer / more comfortable and clearly not like a dating app.

I’m already committing real time and money into this, so I’d rather get brutally honest feedback now than build something that only sounds good in my own head.

**What I’d really like to know from Perth people:**

\- Would you actually use something like this, even once? Or does it immediately feel like “nice idea but I’d never go”? Why?

\- Biggest hesitation/red flag? (Safety, awkward vibes, anxiety meeting strangers, same-gender groups only at first, etc)

\- What kind of meetup would you actually show up to in real life, not just say you’re “interested” in? (eg Saturday morning coffee, after-work walk, beginner gym session, board games, whatever)

\- How do you feel about the same-gender groups for v1? Does that make you more likely to try it, less likely, or doesn’t matter?

Not trying to sell anything here - the app isn’t live yet. This is genuinely a sense-check with the city I’m building it for.

If this sounds like something you’d realistically try when it’s ready and you want to be on a small early-access list for Perth, I’ve made a very simple interest form here (totally optional):

A while back, he started following several women on Instagram. When I asked about them, he said he met them at the gym. I shared that it made me uncomfortable, but he told me I was being paranoid, so I didn’t pursue it further.

He also still follows a woman he once expressed romantic interest in, from a few years ago when he was in a previous relationship. He says nothing ever happened, but recently she messaged him about going out for dinner/a double date. He told her it wasn’t a good time because we’re “going through some issues.” I’m unsure how to interpret this interaction.

Lately, he’s been more distant and sometimes speaks to me in ways that feel dismissive. He works night shifts and often has coffee with a female coworker. He has shared that he enjoys talking to her and finds her attractive, and has mentioned hypothetically that he would consider casual encounters if he were single.

He has also said that he believes I would not leave him even if he were unfaithful.

1p5drry,https://www.reddit.com/r/caloriecount/comments/1p5drry/how_tracking_my_nutrition_as_a_student_completely/,How tracking my nutrition as a student completely changed my health,"Hey everyone, Luka here.

I am a solo student developer who unexpectedly fell deep into nutrition over the past few years. I want to share my experience because calorie tracking genuinely changed my life. Maybe it can help someone who is in the same place I used to be.



**Who am I and what am I working on?**



My name is Luka and I am a university student who spends a lot of time coding, studying, and trying to stay awake. A couple of years ago I had low energy, inconsistent eating habits, and the classic student lifestyle: random meals, late night snacks, and days where coffee replaced actual food.



I did not think calorie tracking was for people like me. I assumed it was only for athletes or fitness influencers. I was very wrong.



**How it started**



The change began when I noticed that my energy was always low. Not the normal tired feeling that comes from school but something worse. My brain felt foggy, my mood was inconsistent, and I could not focus.



A friend suggested I try tracking my meals for just one day. I expected nothing.



The results shocked me:

	•	I was eating far fewer calories than I believed

	•	My protein intake was extremely low

	•	My meals were unbalanced

	•	Most of my calories came from snacks



For the first time I saw exactly what I was putting into my body. That one day changed everything.



**What changed after I committed to tracking**

I tracked for one week. Then one month. Then it became a habit that genuinely improved my life.



**1. Better energy levels**

Once I started eating enough and fueling myself properly, everything felt easier. I did not depend on multiple coffees just to function.



**2. A healthier relationship with food**

I stopped guessing and stopped feeling guilty about eating. Understanding my intake gave me control.



**3. Visible physical improvements**

I was not trying to get shredded. I simply cared about feeling better. Once I hit consistent protein goals, I began to put on muscle naturally.



**4. Better mental clarity**

Stable eating patterns created stable moods. This was a huge improvement for me.



**5. Improved productivity**

Studying on an empty stomach is completely different from studying when your body is fueled. The difference is massive.



**Why I built a nutrition app as a student with no budget**

As I tracked more, I noticed an issue. Many nutrition apps were:

	•	too complicated

	•	full of ads

	•	expensive

	•	distracting

	•	designed for hardcore fitness users rather than everyday people



I wanted something simple and minimal. Something clean and focused on awareness rather than pressure.



So I built it myself. This became [Yoa Nutrition](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/ai-calorie-tracker-yoa/id6753655800). I work on it alone and I am building it at my own pace.



The goal of [Yoa Nutrition](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/ai-calorie-tracker-yoa/id6753655800) is:

	•	simple calorie tracking

	•	fast meal logging

	•	a distraction free design

	•	helpful nutrition insights

	•	tools that help normal people build long term habits



I created it because this process changed my own life and I wanted a tool that reflected that reality.



**What I learned about nutrition**

After more than two years of learning and tracking, these ideas helped me the most:



**1. Consistency matters more than perfection**

Even a few weeks of tracking can permanently increase your awareness.



**2. Protein intake is extremely important**

It improves satiety, muscle retention, and energy.



**3. The 80 to 20 approach works**

Eat mostly nutritious food and allow flexibility. No guilt required.



**4. Many people accidentally under eat**

This was my biggest mistake for a long time.



**5. Your body responds to actual data**

Calories and nutrients matter because biology cares, not because apps do.



**Final thoughts**

I am not a nutrition expert or a fitness professional. I am just a student who discovered how much better life becomes when you eat with awareness and consistency.



If my story helps even one person feel more energized or more in control of their eating, I am happy.



If you want to check out the app that I built from this experience, it is called [Yoa Nutrition](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/ai-calorie-tracker-yoa/id6753655800). If not, that is completely fine. Even a single week of calorie tracking might teach you something important about your body.



I am happy to answer questions or talk about anything nutrition related.

Ode is an open-source, easily customisable platform for writers who are like me, who do not want bells and whistles, and who want people to enjoy reading their body of work like they would read a book with its Reader mode. Ode is under the MIT license, made intentionally. You are free to use it, fork it, customise it. I have already begun using it for my website.

>This is an ode. An ode to those who love the craft, an ode to the old internet, an ode to a time before numbers and figures dominated writing, an ode to a time where readers remembered their favourite writers, and an ode to the hope that all of it is still present, somewhere.

You can check out the [Git repository](https://github.com/DeepanshKhurana/ode) or a [demo here](https://ode-demo.vercel.app/). If you feel there is something good here, you can also Sponsor it.

P.S. The light switch button is my favourite feature of anything I have ever built.

**Features:**

* **Markdown-based content**: Write your pieces and pages in simple markdown files with front matter; push to publish
* **Reader mode**: Beautiful paginated reading experience with keyboard navigation (arrow keys)
   * **Checkpointing:** URLs for the reader mode track piece and position so even if you publish more and the collection gets updated, a bookmarked link will always send the reader to the right place in the ""book""
* **Collections/Volumes**: Automatically organize your pieces into themed collections for curated reading
* **Dark/Light mode**: Automatic theme switching with user preference persistence with a nice lamp reminiscent of olden times
* **RSS feed**: Auto-generated RSS feed with full content for your readers to use
* **Body of Work**: Chronological archive of all your pieces, organized by month/year; order is up to you
* **Random piece**: Let readers discover content serendipitously and the continue reading
* **Build-time generation**: Static pages and indexes generated during build for optimal performance
* **Fully customizable**: All UI labels, site metadata, and page order configurable via `config.yaml`
* **No tracking, no analytics, no boxes, no search, no media**: Just writing and reading

**Background:** I have always been a writer/artist first and then, a programmer. I have always been opinionated about writing, and how I feel modern ""writing"" is not how it should work even if you are publishing online. Comment boxes are an illusion of engagement. Part of the charm has always been to not be able to meet the writer of a book you are writing. At least, for me. I am somewhat of a purist when it comes to that side of the world and that is why both sides of me have always been so disconnected. It has been an exercise in intention. My website (journal.coffee) has always been a haven for anyone who wants to kill time by reading some prose but not ""interact"" in the way you would with a website.

I stopped writing regularly a year or so ago and there are many reasons for it but one was that I wanted to do a revamp and build it myself again instead of relying on a platform like WordPress. I wanted to do publish with more flexibility and, in a possible merger of my two selves, publish with a simple Git push but retain the rest of everything. This weekend, I finally sat down to learn React, not with just a course but with a project that has been in the works, mentally, for almost two years now. This is that project. Perhaps, I will begin my daily cadence again.

**The good part is even if you don't care for my motivations or opinion, you can customise it into how you want.**

1p5dnl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1p5dnl3/do_not_watch_this/,Do Not Watch This,"I’m writing this here now because I’m not sure when I’ll get another chance. I’m not sure I’ll live long enough to recount this event in its entirety. 

My name is Donavin Meeks. I’m 22 years old, and last month, I found a VHS tape. 

I had been rummaging through my attic, searching for some old Halloween costumes I could pull back out for old times' sake, just to get into the ol’ holiday spirit. 

I’ll preface by saying, much like many others, my attic was almost backroom-ish. 

The way the dust had collected amongst the clutter, and how the cobwebs seemed to decorate the beams that supported my roof, the atmosphere alone was unsettling enough. 

As I searched through box after box of old knick-knacks, photo albums, and stocking stuffers that nobody used anymore, I finally managed to find the cardboard box labeled “Halloween” with a little cutely drawn spider with a smiley face beside it. 

All hail the Gods of irony, because as soon as I lifted the box, the biggest black widow I’d ever seen came running out, its legs clicking against the hardwood.

I hate spiders, so this obviously caused me to jump backwards, tripping and falling over some other boxes and immediately flailing like a maniac in fear of a bite from the arachnid. 

Hopping to my feet and checking ferociously for any sign of the thing on any part of my body, I happened to glance down at the mess of boxes I had just created. 

Lying in the center of the scattered clothing and Christmas decorations, lie a VHS tape. 

Unlike the other items, the VHS tape was completely dust free, and seemed as though it had been watched to about the halfway point. 

I picked it up to analyze it and found that it had been labeled “Do Not Watch” in black permanent marker over white painters tape. 

Staring at the words, I couldn’t help but feel utter intrigue. 

Not only had I never seen the tape, I had never even OWNED a VHS player. 

I mean, I’m 22, honestly, what am I going to use one of those things for? 

The dams of curiosity broke within the first two minutes of my discovery, and off I went, down to the local pawn shop to find my VHS player. 

It cost me a solid $5.98. One of the perks of being obsolete, I guess.  Upon returning home, I was bewildered to find that the mysterious videotape was no longer on the coffee table where I had left it. 

Living alone, this turned out to be incredibly concerning to me. 

I began to rack my brain, thinking of how I could have misplaced the thing. 

I distinctly remembered placing it directly in the center of my coffee table. I mean, I checked under the couches, on the dining room table, my bedroom, bathroom, every room in my house had been checked. 

I began thinking that it was my mind that had been lost instead of that damn tape.

I stayed up into the early morning hours because the idea of something that distinct just vanishing like that; it irked me.

My mind already tends to wander and teeter on borderline paranoid schizophrenia, and this event did NOT help.

Once I finally DID choose to go to bed, my sleep was shakey at best.

I couldn’t have been asleep for more than an hour and a half when the abrupt sounds of what seemed to be footsteps awoke me.

I could have swore that I heard the sound coming from directly above me, yet, once I fully regained consciousness, they had stopped completely.

I had first put it off as a dream, a mere trick of the mind, similar that feeling you get when you’re falling in your sleep.

That thought gave me comfort, and allowed me to doze back into sleep. However, that comfort was quickly vanquished when the same sounds started up yet again.

This time I KNEW what I had heard, and I wasn’t about to just lay in bed defenseless.

I immediately threw the covers off of myself and grabbed the bat that I keep beside my bed in case of home intruders just like this one.

Being sure to make a lot of noise so the intruder KNEW that I was coming. I wanted them afraid, I wanted them to feel what I had been feeling.

I yanked the attic door down and began climbing the ladder, flashlight in one hand, bat in the other.

I hyped myself up as I ascended, preparing myself for whatever may lay within the plane of darkness which is my attic.

Once I got about 6 inches from the entrance, I called out.

“I know you’re up there! I hope you know I’m calling the cops, AND I’m armed. So just come on out please. Don’t make this any harder than it needs to be.”

I waited a few moments and received no response.

The silence was daunting, and cut through me.

The hot attic air seemed to grow chilled. A distinct drop in temperature that made me shiver.

“Just come on out, man. We can work this out just as soon as you come out and make yourself known!”

I waited a few moments once more, and once more, received no response.

“Alright, I’m coming up! I swear to God if I see any movement whatsoever from you, I am bashing your head in!”

I slowly began to ascend what remained of the ladder.

My right palm sweat profusely wrapped around the rubber grip of the bat, whereas my left hand shook the beam of the flashlight ever so slightly.

I began to scan the room with the beam, making sure light touched every surface possible from the attic entrance.

Everything seemed still. Calm. Untouched, if it weren’t for where the few boxes I had knocked over prior.

Though my light landed on no one, it did happen to fall upon a familiar plastic black rectangle, placed right back in the center of the spilled clutter.

“No fucking way…” I thought to myself.

Cautiously, I made my way towards the VHS tape, practically spinning in circles with my flashlight as I inched closer.

Still, no sign of an intruder.

I reached down and retrieved the VHS tape.

Just then, a whole wall of boxes came tumbling over from across the attic, followed by the sounds of swift footsteps that seemed to approach me at an inhuman pace, only to completely dissipate as soon as it was before me.

The flashlight and bat were both shaking wildly now as I spun around the room, sweating and petrified.

“COME OUT! COME OUT RIGHT NOW!” I screamed.

The attic was now eerily silent again.

As I stood there, shaking and on the brink of a panic attack, the sound of creaking floorboards scratched the back of my mind, and a deep, booming voice spoke from behind me.

“Boo.”

I flew across the attic at a speed I didn’t know I was possible of achieving,

I was down the ladder so fast that my foot ended up getting caught on the last rung, causing my ankle to twist, followed by a sickening POP that shot pain throughout my entire leg.

I had saved my videotape though, and this time, it wasn’t leaving my side.

I ended up having to spend the rest of the night and next morning in the hospital getting x-rayed and having my foot casted up.

I had ended up breaking my ankle, and all I could tell the doctors was I tripped while climbing out of the attic.

Anyway, I returned home as soon as I was cleared, anxious to finally watch this VHS that seemed to had randomly appeared in my home, as well as some sort of unwanted visitor.

I never really fed into the whole paranormal thing, but holy shit, man. The true horror that I felt in that moment up in that attic; it made me a believer instantly.

Well, I should say that it made me believe that things can be ATTACHED to objects. Whether it be holy or demonic. Attachments can happen.

And I believe that’s what the case was with this tape.

Once I arrived home, I was determined to finally view its contents.

Something that I had failed to notice upon retrieving the tape from the attic was that now, instead of being half way through, it was completely rewound to the very beginning.

Not only that, but the black marker had now been turned…red? It looked as though a completely new label had been placed on the tape. It looked…flashier. Like the CAUTION tag on a bottle of chemicals.

“DO. NOT. WATCH. THIS.”

Yeah, right. Who WOULD’NT watch this?

Arriving home, I found that my house had been completely trashed.

Cabinets were thrown open, couch cushions ripped off and strewn across the floor, pots and pans sat neatly across every counter top.

Luckily for me, my VHS player had remained untouched, and sat where it had been just below the TV stand.

Unbothered by the mess, unbothered by the clear red flags, I sat down in front of my television and popped the tape into the player.

Nothing happened at first. Just a black screen that lingered.

Suddenly, blasting white and black static came scratching across the display.

I jumped a bit, and felt my heart drop before steadying.

Slowly but surely, the picture began to become clear and smooth.

The first thing to come into view was a mailbox.

A mailbox that stood displaying my exact address.

My heart began to speed up again.

As the picture video became clearer, I was able to make out the sidewalk that led to my front porch.

Then my front door.

Then my stairs.

The attic door.

The ladder.

And then darkness as the person recording nestled into a dark corner within the attic.

The video then remained that way. Black stillness for an uncomfortably long period of time.

There was a sudden and harsh skip in the frames and now the camera was panned to the attic door from within the attic.

Distinct shadows could be seen through the cracks in the doorframe, shadows that seemed to be that of a certain 22 year old man, living alone.

There was another cut, and now the recorder appeared to be crouched in a new corner of the attic, filming as the door to the fell open and footsteps began to climb the ladder.

I watched in horror as my own head popped into frame, waddling up the stairs, completely oblivious, as I searched through box after box for a stupid Halloween costume.

The video then abruptly ended, right before the black widow came crawling out from under the package causing me to jump backwards and fall.

The next cut was a shot of my living room. It showed the camera slowly approaching the tape that lay on my coffee table.

Another sudden cut.

A hand was now in frame, pale and decrepit. It carefully placed my silver spaghetti pot atop the kitchen counter before patting it softly, then panning the camera around the room to reveal the mess that had been created.

The next and final cut revealed me, yet again, cautiously searching the addict with a flashlight. Eyes wide and apprehension painted clearly across my face.

I stared at the television in absolute dismay. Frozen. My jaw dropped cleanly to the floor.

I remained in a trance-like state for the remainder of the footage, broken only when the video abruptly ended, and was somehow replaced by live footage.

Live footage that showed a 22 year old man, who lives alone, sitting in awe, as he watched himself on the television.

My mind took longer than I care to admit for it to put the pieces together, but once it did, it was too late, and the sound of heavy footsteps began echoing from the television, and the live footage inched closer and closer to my spot on the sofa.",1,1763980325.0,scarystories,2,1.0,False

Here, I ask Gemini to write a guide about earning drops (virtual currency) in the Zwift game. So far, so good, it's a good guide. But when I ask it to illustrate the guide, it goes completely insane and draws me a coffee brewing guide:

3. Providing completely innacurate info:  
  
In this example, I'm asking it to find the best card for earning Emirates Skywards miles. It lists the Citibank Ultima as the best card - but here is a problem: you can't transfer its earned miles to Skywards, so that information is outdated and incorrect - which the Deepthink Gemini promptly agrees with:

4. Refusal to do price comparisons between sites.

Here, I am asking Gemini to compare the prices across different regional websites (EU, UK, AUS, etc) of a lingerie clothing company. Gemini simply for some inexplicable reason simply refuses to do this, while ChatGPT has zero issues:

5. Finally, no agent mode outside of the US, while ChatGPT has it worldwide, is also kind of weird.

I'll let you know,"I'm 51 years young, married with grown up kids and life sometimes gets a little blah, a little mundane if you will, chores and routines a never ending cycle of wake up (normally before the alarm goes off) head to work, avoid all the obnoxious idiots while trying to be productive, come home, prep and cook dinner, maybe ill wash up to if I've had a good day, tidy up, shower then relax in front of TV, although i have no control over the TV, that's the wife's domain because she doesn't like my type of things, which is horror/psychological, something a bit gritty. 

**Things that i like:**  
*Lazy mornings, people watching, the warm sun on my skin, fresh coffee, the smell of freshly cut grass, rum (spiced or dark), teasing, exploring castles and forests (not hiking), long drives in the countryside, 90's alternative music, cooking and trying new foods, psychological films, late nights and early lazy mornings, drawing/sketching, dogs.*

**Things i dont like:**  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

**My bad points:**  
*Over thinking, i have been called intense before, and i have a tendency to take things to heart.*
