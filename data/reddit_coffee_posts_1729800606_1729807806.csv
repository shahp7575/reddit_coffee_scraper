Good day everyone,

I noticed in the morning that my first shot always takes longer time compared to the shots that come after.

Tried pulling blank shot initially and purging the grinder (maybe due to the day old retention?), but it still persists. 

To provide an example:

Constant grind setting. 4 week old coffee beans.

First shot (of the day):

Time: 35-40s

Weight: 18g in 30g out

Succeeding shot:

Time: 30s +/- \~3

Weight: 18g in 30g out

Keep it mind I try to be consistent to my puck prep as much as I can. Machine is ON 30mins by this point. Portafilter pre heated as well.

Little or to minimal channeling is seen when I brew.

Also, I noticed that the first time I insert the portafilter its slightly restricted. On the second time, Its restriction lessens. Like the fresh puck compressed on the second time I inserted the portafilter. Maybe there is some thermodynamics into play.

Background: I am an amateur home barista. I have been brewing espresso since I first bought my Rancilio Silvia last year.

I have to have four wisdom teeth removed, I was told this years ago when I went in to check my teeth out and have a cleaning. 
They told me I was so nervous they would put me under for the procedure. Once they said that, I haven’t been back to the dentist for 6 years because I’m deathly afraid of being put under, and just of dental work in general. 

Now my teeth give me head aches, and body aches and make me feel sick often. I know I have to deal with my teeth, but like I said I have an extreme fear. 

Anybody have any advice or are you similarly afraid to the degree I am ? I just don’t know what to do. 

I’m afraid I could die from the anesthesia, I’m afraid of the epinephrine because I can’t even drink coffee. I’m afraid of being stuck not being able to move in a chair, I’m afraid of the pain and recovery process. I’m honestly just deathly afraid of everything with dentistry.

I work for a coffee equipment service provider, and our parts person ordered what was supposed to be a heating element for a La Marzocco 2-group steam boiler. The OEM element just has two points of connection for ring terminals with some nuts and lock washers. What I received from the parts people is an aftermarket element I've never seen before with 6 spade terminals leading to three tubes of various lengths.

The Marzocco element is rated for 3kW at 230V, giving an expected resistance of about 17Ω. This aftermarket element with the 6 spade terminals reads about 52Ω, regardless of which terminal pair you probe, which is suspiciously exactly triple what I would expect from the OEM element with just 2 terminals. I just want to be sure I'm not tripping in that using only one of the sets of terminals on this aftermarket element won't actually net me a third of the resistance. Like, my reading is 52Ω on all three terminal pairs, so it's gonna be 52Ω no matter which one I use, right? Things just aren't adding up and I think the aftermarket parts distributor just has this incorrectly listed as compatible. Any help is appreciated!",1,1729807017.0,AskElectricians,2,1.0,False

Thank you for replying, this issue has been in my head for the past 6 months.

When I met my current boyfriend, I knew that he was still very close to his ex. A few months in, he told me they still had a trip to France scheduled together.

I was fine with this, until I discovered they would be sleeping in the same bed. During the holiday, I did my best to be as open-minded as possible, but one day, he also posted a picture of the two of them together on Instagram and I lost it. It was a photo of her kissing his arm.

I felt so so so sad. I cried and cried and cried and that day my ex-boyfriend also called me to pick up some stuff at our old house (I had not been in contact with that ex for over a year).

I even burst out in tears while drinking some coffee at our old place. When I went home, I opened some wine, started drinking and I texted my ex boyfriend something like ‘Is there really no chance between us anymore?’

He replied kindly and told me no, and that he was surprised. I told him I was sorry and that he was right, a day later I also apologised for my drunk rant and thanked him again for his kindness.

We have not been in contact over since (nor do I want too).

With my boyfriend, things are cleared out after a really heavy talk. 

It’s now 6 months later, and I still feel so bad about that text, I wonder if I should tell him? Does this make me a bad person,?

Having multiple activities that need to be done in sequence can be annoying if you pause an activity. Follow-up activities start even though the previous one isn’t complete. Sometimes that can be good, but sometimes bad. I know the goal is to stick to a time schedule, but sometimes something unexpected happens and you need to pause the sequence of activities. Currently, if something causes you to pause your activity, more start and it just feels like chaos.

2. Another thing that was great about routines is that you group activities together. It was easy to drop my exercise routine or my morning coffee-walk routine in any day.

Now I have to either:
- add each activity from each previous routine manually, which leads to more time being spent fiddling around

Or:
-  make an activity with a huge checklist 

I don’t like the huge checklist idea because it’s hard to keep track of where I am using the focus visualiser",1,1729806895.0,TiimoApp,0,1.0,False

This was my first ""first date"" in about four years, so I was pretty nervous despite great initial conversation and enthusiasm before meeting. We took the train into the city and got coffee, chatted on a lovely rooftop terrace for a couple hours, and walked around the waterfront enjoying the abnormally nice weather.

The first half of the date was pretty much just my mind playing ""please don't screw this up"" on repeat, but about halfway through I calmed down and realized that I actually liked this girl and she seemed to like me too. After all, she came all this way with me to spend the afternoon together right? 

At the end of the date, we both talked about wanting to do date #2 and currently have plans for this weekend. I went home in a pretty great mood obviously, but the more I thought about how things went I realized I might actually be developing a real crush. I got out of a 6.5 year (off and on - thus the 4 years since last first date) relationship a few months ago and finally truly felt immense relief that it was finally over. I had definitely been ""over"" it for some time now (it had honestly been a long time coming), but this is the first time I feel like it's 100% true and not 75% true and 25% me just trying to convince myself that it was for the best. It truly, truly was. Even exploring the city by myself when I first moved here got me feeling happier than I have in a long, long time. 

She's really cute, super cool, interesting to talk to, and really seems genuinely excited about continuing to see each other. I've really been trying not to get too carried away since we've still only met once, but it's really hard to not feel optimistic and crush just a bit given all the good vibes so far. I really hope it keeps working out, I'm truly stoked to see where things go :)

Don't give up homies. One day, inexplicably, you'll realize that the bad times haven't just ended but have actually been over for a while. It's tough, but there's always the potential for better times ahead. You just gotta roll with the punches and keep trucking. Don't beat yourself up if  you backslide some days.

1gbe80y,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCCQE/comments/1gbe80y/passed_296/,Passed - 296,"Hi, guys. 

I was a very active member of this group in July-August, and met a lot of people through this. I was active on given solution and answers that I wished someone had given me. I confess that I got very scared about some horror stories after my test and just deleted my account. I hope the lot of you got important stuff from it, and I know some still use my slides and notes. I am glad. 

Either way, I've passed. And the number one thing that helped me was... Tumblr. It wasn't AceQBank or the MCCPractice test. Here I got less anxious, saw a bunch of people going through the same thing. And I got better because it. So I would recommend to use it. Use it to get one or other partner in crime - to bitch about it, to compare notes and tips.. To teach. Teaching makes you learn. Unfortunately, I am under the impression that the majority just come here to help themselves, without helping others.. You shouldn't. Helping someone else is the best thing you can do for yourself. 

This is my journey, yours is going to be different, and that is ok:  
**- Context:** 30yo, graduated 2018 in south America (not a good student), internal medicine specialist (good one), working in a hospital for the past 5 years, + 1 year as a GP. My strength: ethics and ortho (I know... I just knew ortho stuff out of nowhere...). My weak subject: gyneco and peds.  
**- Time studying -** 3 months, not working, but a lot of procrastination. 

**- Tools:** CMPA online learning, AceQBank, MCC practice tests (all), Tumblr, ChatGPT, Uptodate

CMPA is good to get the ethical part of the test. I did see some questions on the practice tests that were taken from the CMPA. 

AceQBank: I did 90% of it, but around 4000 questions (repeated), average of 65%. I was really bad in the beginning, getting between 40 and 50% right. But I took one tag at a time, did 100-200 questions on repeat, googling everything I didnt know and taking notes.. Suddenly I improved to an 70-80% average. By the end I had a 90% average (on repeated questions). If anyone is as lost as I was in the beginning - someone that didnt even remember how old should we start iron on a newborn... Just go slow. I did 4 days of only peds, 2 days of only gastro, and so on. There ate 21 subjects. Go one at a time, before blending everything in... 

MCC Practice tests: DONT WASTE IT. Don't waste it in the beginning of your preparation. Once you have gone through all the subjects and started doing a full test on Ace (or Uworld, etc), and have gotten your time to less than 80 sec per question, then you start the MCC. I used it as (1) source of questions (2) time management training. On test day, those time management plannings helped me to stay cool throughout the whole 4 hours. Yes, the questions are similiar in length and time taken to answer it. No, my test was not just like it. Will talk more about it later. My scores on the practices test were all over the place. I had my minimum of 68% and my maximum of 81%. The average was 72%. 

Tumblr: I helped a lot around here. I would transfer my notes highlights here and make posts. People would comment on it and find me on DMs so I could explain something. I am a teacher back home, so I taught. The best thing. I remembered a lot because of it. It is not studying together, it is helping each other. When I had trouble with something, people would also help me out. Our july-august party was pretty neat. 

ChatGPT: Of course, always take it with a grain of salt. But it can help you producing rationales on questions you didnt get it. Just copy the question, signal which one is right, which one you marked, and it will explain to you why your thought process was wrong. Sometimes, the why the other one is right is not enough, you need to know why you are wrong. ChatGPT for the rescue..

Uptodate: Ive noticed on MCC Practice test that the source they often listed was uptodate. So I started using it for concepts or quick reads on a subject I didn't know much about. Ive found it more helpful than TNotes. But that is me. Ive been using Uptodate daily for more than 2 years, so I know how to use it. Ps: you can always copy the full text from uptodate to ChatGPT and ask it to summarize. It is amazing what the AI can do once you feed it information. 

  
**My test day - remote proctoring** 

a) Everything went perfectly fine. No mishaps, no disconnections. I had my phone and a neighbour's wifi as a back up if needed. I started it 20 minutes before the set time - because I was anxious. It was great, I was immediately connected to a nice proctor that went throught the security check with me. I had my office emptied, it was just my desk, a foot stool and a mirror behind me. No decor, no nothing. Everything else on the tiny hallway outside. I had a glass of water. I didnt go to the bathroom during the first session. I took my lunch break (45min). Rushed to the bathroom, took a quick shower to wake up, ate 1 slice of pizza and came back for the second session. The second session was easy, I finished it 1 hour ahead of the stipulated time. The first session I finished it 20 min before, reviewed my flagged questions, and submitted it 1 min before I needed to. 

b) Dress code: loose T-shirt, jacket and no-pockets leggings. Best thing ever. I also used socks, which I took off in the first 5 minutes.  I used the most comfy thing I owned (fake - i used my partner clothes because she has better stuff hahaha). I did take a shower in the 45 min break and washed my hair before the test, in the middle of the test and after the test. What can I say, it helps me to wake up and wash away any stress... 

c) Eating: Just a toast and water. i had gastritis, so I didnt drink coffee, afraid it could give me pain. Lunch, I just reheated two pieces of pizza. Ate one. That was it. I bathed in the sun, so I suppose it produced enough ATP to get me going...

d) Exercising: I wish I could tell you I ran everyday during my prep-time.. I didnt.. I did walk the dog daily, is that enough?

e) Sleeping: I knew I would have to wake up at 5 in my test day. So I started going to bed at 8-9 and waking up 5-6 am in the month prior to the test, so that my body would get use to it. It worked. I also scheduled my study time to 210 minutes. So that I could train my brain to focus for that long, instead of the 40 min it was used to. 

f) Subject: I do think having the cultural knowledge helped. My home country and Canada have a lot of common ground regarding medical culture, so I just answered as I would in my normal practice - apparently it worked. I imagine people coming from other countries would find it difficult, while Canadians are just "" pff, this is easy af\*"". CMPA helps a lot with this. Read through it, go in the news session and check out the commentary that they add about a lawsuit, that kind of stuff. Try to immerse yourself into what Canadians thing is right and what that think it is wrong. Specially related to the rights of women and children - I know it is really different in other cultures (not saying right or wrong, this is not a political debate).  I will respect the confidentiality clause and not talk about it. Please, respect it.

1gbe49f,https://www.reddit.com/r/NerdDating/comments/1gbe49f/28_f4m_indianaonline_seeking_a_serious/,28 [F4M] Indiana/Online - Seeking a Serious Relationship ,"Introduction:
Hello! It’s nice to virtually meet you. My name is Kay. I am terrible at introductions, but I’m going to try my best here. 
To start: I don’t really know what all to say, so just bear with me. But If something in here catches your interest and you want to message me, please feel free to send an introduction of yourself 


About Me and Who I’m Looking for: 
As mentioned before, I’m a 28 year old woman living in Indiana. Online dating honestly terrifies me. I don’t like to have a large online presence, but I also don’t want to die alone. I can be very awkward and not always social, but I try. 

As for appearances: I am 5’7” and on the thicker side(like thick with two Cs). I have dark brown, type 4C hair down to my shoulders and dark brown eyes. I’m about the color of coffee with two touches of creamer. I don’t wear makeup (I know, weird right) so what you see is what you get. I don’t have any piercings or tattoos but sometimes I like to live on the edge and put on a temporary tatt. 
My style is all over the place. It can be sweats and a shirt or a dress with pockets and heels and then just about everything in between. Pictures can be shared on request. 

As for my personality: I’d say I’m pretty introverted, but I can be social when I need or really want to be (mostly around those I’m really close to). I won’t talk your ear off, but I’ll listen to you all day long. I can be sarcastic, but not in a mean way. I am knowing for being really caring and motherly to my friends. I like to help people becuase no one should have to go through troubles alone. People would probably describe me as having a serious demeanor, but I get playful when I am comfortable. I value building close relationship…. Quality over quantity! 

As for my hobbies: I can say they are all over the place. I absolutely love crafting! It’s relaxing and fun for me. I like to eat (although I am keto). Being Keto has really lead me to being a meat enthusiast so anything BBQ, smoked, slow cooked, I’m all over. With that being said, I also love cooking. I am always looking for new recipes to try. I feel like cooking and eating are both efficient ways of connecting with the soul. I enjoy watching cartoons and anime and doing puzzles and coloring. I like to laugh so I spend a lot of time looking at funny videos and memes as well. Getting outside of the house, I like to garden and observe nature. Haha but I am scared of bugs! Going to the park to take walks or on a picnic is such a fun activity. I’ve recently gotten into trying different local brunch spots (lol back to food we go). I also like to go bike riding on trails and spending time at museums. I do like to travel and would love to have a partner I could do more of that with. 

As for who I’m looking for: I would like someone who wants to be in a serious, committed relationship. I am monogamous, I know some people find that boring, but I think it’s exciting to have someone you get to spend your life with. I am looking for someone who wants to grow and build together. When life throws us curveballs, we work it out together. I would also like someone who’s family oriented. Family is very important to me. Speaking of family, I am interested in someone who wants to build a family. I don’t have kids, but I would like to with the right person. (Is it too soon to say that?) I’m a cheesy person… I would really appreciate someone who does the little things. I’m talking about writing letters, leaving notes, cooking together, little surprises, watching movies together, flowers and steak, planing date nights, etc. I just want to be given love, appreciation, and affection and I want to give that in return. I’m not sure how detailed I am supposed to get here, but I feel like this is a good start! 


My Deal Breakers: 
1.) No smokers! I don’t smoke and I have asthma so I would rather not deal with someone who smokes. 
2.) No heavy drinkers! I know heavy drinker can be subjective, but I would rather not deal with someone who gets black out drunk or so drunk they can’t control themself. I do drink so I don’t mind someone who drinks, just not heavily. 
3.) No illegal drug/substance users! I just don’t condone it 
4.) No polygamists! I am looking for a single lifelong partner that I can call mine and mine alone. I don’t want to be in a sharing situation. 
5.) Not family oriented! I really want to be with someone who cares about their family, will care about mine, and wants to build their own 
6.) Not citizens! This might be rude, but I am not looking to sponsor anyone. 


Your Deal Breakers: 
I’m not perfect and I do have flaws and traits that some might see as downsides so I’ll share what I think about there
1.) I’m keto. I really try to watch what I put in my body and carbs are my kryptonite. I know that bothers some people so to each their own 
2.) I have medical conditions: asthma, heart condition, etc. I try to eat right and exercise a bit, but not everything can be helped. 
3.) I can be really quiet. It does not mean I’m upset, I just tend to be an internalizer. 
4.) I’m agnostic. I grew up Christian and maybe to a degree that’s still rooted in me, but I consider myself to be agnostic. I will occasionally to go church, but I don’t go all the time. I would not however stop my partner from being religious. I truly believe that everyone is entitled to believe what they wish and that it should be respected. 


Conclusion: 
If you read this far, I curtsy to you! 
That’s me in a nutshell. Of course it’s not everything; I have 28 years of life behind me, but it’s a start. If you are interested, feel free to message me and introduce yourself :) ",1,1729805862.0,NerdDating,0,1.0,False

My friend and I, were in a homeless shelter in a city but he had to leave and went to a different city and got into the homeless shelter there but we kept contact with each other through text and he told me about this city he was in and feeling like I had exhausted my options on the city i was in I decided to move to the city he had gone to. I eventually got into the same shelter as his him, but he warned me that there are people there that aren't very friendly and it's common for fist fights to happen there. 

I soon found out what he meant because there's 3 people there who are openly antagonistic to people telling making open threats (one said he'd knock my head off my shoulders) because I fold him to shut the fuck up because they're constantly complaining or commenting on what other residents are doing. They loudly Tell others to wash their hands which normally wouldn't be a bad thing but they do it in a way that's very antagonistic and implying that everyone else is dirty telling people they don't like that thry stink onelady had a service animal, and the woman of the trio threw a fit because the dog laid on her bed she demanded new sheets over it and whined and complained for 20 minutes about it then sat next to the woman with her service animal in the dining area and told her she had to move to another seat when the woman with her service animal was already sitting there. Of you call them out they'll call you pussy loudly berating you getting in your face and trying to intimidate you .

So this is the environment we've been living in for the last couple of weeks I'm a pretty quiet person and try really hard to not cause problems but these people are even getting on my nerve. So last night another altercation happened they butted into a conversation that had nothing to do with them they got rowdy my friend spoke up one of the 3 on a guy with a cane because his leg's messed up the ringleade of this little group and from what my friend says he spit on my friend and my friend threw cold coffee at him resulting on a fight and my friend getting kicked out. Now I'm not asking the staff to reverse this however they seem blind to any wrong doing the m behalf of these 3 because the night staff are very friendly with them always joking and talking with them. I talked to staff above them but all they said was that they'd ""talk to the staff about it"" which I've heard before over a week ago when they were doing this shit then. I'm thinking about going as far up the chain of command to get these bullies dealt with bec for n my opinion they should be out on the streets not my friend. Any ideas on how to accomplish this?

I brew coffee at home and usually it's good. Since I upgraded my grinder, I brought my Ode gen2 to my office. I have a gooseneck kettle there too. And I brew a manual pourover.

And when I brew coffee there, it has this really really bad smell/taste. My wife said it reminds her of burnt plastic. I would describe it as somewhat bad bitter grass, maybe very stale coffee, something like that. It's driving me crazy and I can't find the source.

I bring the beans from home, and at home they brew fine; so it's not stale beans. I bring water from home, so it's not water (or jug). I brought a V60 from home, so it's probably not the dripper. 

If I pour water from the kettle to the mug and just drink it, I can't smell it. So if it's the kettle, it's not very prominent. But I do smell this almost as soon as I pour hot water on coffee grounds (and definitely towards the end of the brew).

I cleaned the grinder with Grindz, and in general I try to keep everything clean. I do not wash anything with smelly soap.

I do store the cup, kettle (with some water), carafe, and filters in my office; I prewet the filters in the sink, so not with TWW, but the water from the sink doesn't have this smell.

Is it just some smell from my office that I somehow get in the coffee but not in the air? What else can it be? I am sure I am not the one who is experiencing this (or am I?)

I haven’t told her I’m leaving to the Caribbean this weekend but reckon it’s over after no contact this week. We had tentative plans for a hotel and pool day prior to going no contact.

But I got to thinking, if you’re able to afford it, what is the dating budget for dating in the top 4-5 US city? Mathing: I alone $100-$200. 3 dates a week x 2 people = $600-$1200 per week.

Keep in mind when I say that we purchased tickets on a whim that we were there during the off season so I wouldn’t necessarily take this approach if you’re going during the peak season. Neither of us drink so we cannot comment on beer or anything of the sorts. 

This is just our ***opinion*** so take it fwiw. This is a basic summary so I’m sure I’m forgetting a lot. All of our photos are posted on Shutterfly and if you care for the links DM me and I will send you the links. 

* **London** 

We flew into/out of Heathrow. It was cheaper to book roundtrip tickets than it was to book two one ways so we started and ended in London. We arrived to Heathrow 90 minutes before our flight and still got to our gate 30 minutes early. This was on a Sunday for a 1340 departure time out of T5. 

**Getting around:** Amazing public transit system and affordable. Underground runs every few minutes, it’s a comfortable temperature and it’s not overly crowded. We also had a car but London charges a surcharge to drive into the city during peak congestion times. This wasn’t covered in our rental fee nor did they tell us about it when we picked up the car. We only drove two of the days so we had to pay about $50 USD. We took a TFL bus once for 2.5 miles but it took nearly 45 minutes due to traffic so in the end we should have walked, it would have been quicker. We didn’t use taxis or any type of ride share but they were all everywhere we went. 

**Weather:** London average just over 100 days of rain a year so pack a rain jacket! We had a mix of rain and sun. It was never cold. 

**Sites**: *London Eye:* Worth it for the views of the Elizabeth Tower alone! (The clock tower where Big Ben is located). Purchased tickets in advance. 

*Tower Bridge:* Tour was nice and informative. We purchased tickets as we were walking across it and they were able to get us in immediately. 

*Tower of London:* Also purchased tickets as we were walking by with no issue. We got there about two hours before they closed so it felt a little rushed but was enough time to see what we wanted to see. 

*Westminster Abbey:* Amazing place to visit. Also purchased tickets as we were walking by. 

*Buckingham Palace:* We didn’t get to see the Changing of the Guard unfortunately. It was canceled by rain one day and another it was canceled due to a half marathon. Other days we were out of town. But the palace itself is incredible to view as is Hyde Park across the street from it. 

*Lyceum Theater:* We saw The Lion King musical here and it was really nice. 2.5 hour show. Bought tickets the day before and it was sold out by the next morning. There are several theaters and different shows in the city. 

*Notting Hill:* Cute area to walk around in and do some shopping

*Abbey Road:* Very busy crosswalk so for flacks sake don’t stand in the middle of the road and impede traffic. It’s incredibly rude. 

*London Bridge:* Unimpressive. The original London Bridge spans Lake Havasu in Arizona, United States. 

**Food**: We mostly grabbed food from Sainsbury’s (the local grocery chain) and cooked at the flat we had rented. We did frequent Pret A Manger and Costa for coffee. Both were great. Pret also has good sandwiches. The only other place we ate at was Byrons Proper Hamburgers. The food was good but the service was miserable. We ended up leaving notes on our table when we couldn’t get a check and found out later that they don’t even take notes. So I kind of feel like we dined and dashed but technically we paid. **Two things to keep in mind;** 1. Because of the Sunday Trading Act any business over 280 square meters can only be open for a max of six hours on Sunday. 2. Some food is cheaper if you take it to go than if you eat it in due to the VAT (Value Added Tax). Every place we went had both prices listed and the workers will ask if you’re eating in or taking it to go. Sainsbury‘s were open 1100-1800 on Sundays but they have smaller markets called Sainsburys Local that were open normal hours, mostly 0700-2300 in our experience. Clever way of getting around the STA. 

  
**Overall**: One of the cleanest cities I’ve ever been in so kudos for that! Every one was polite and we really enjoyed our stay there. 

* **Windsor/Stonehenge/Bath**

We drove our rental car this day. 

**Windsor**: We had tickets for the castle but when we arrived at 0900 there was already 500 people in line and dozens of tour buses so we decided to skip the castle. Instead we did the Long Walk (five miles round trip) and walked around town. There are nice views of the castle from the outside. Some neat shops near the train station and a cool park behind where all the tour buses park. 

**Stonehenge**: It’s small so we didn’t spend a lot of time there the first time around but on our way back from Cardiff we stopped again to shoot the Milky Way over Stonehenge. You have to park at the visitor center and you can either walk 1.25 miles or take a shuttle. We opted to walk both ways and it was quicker than the shuttle. The visitor center is really nice. 

**Bath**: Super cool town! We went into the Roman Baths and had lunch at a cafe in the former train station. I think it was called Great Britain Burger. Either way it was good. Lovely architecture in the city and nice parks with gardens to walk around.

* **Cardiff** 

We drove here one morning and spent the day. Much quieter than London. 

**Getting Around:** We parked the car and walked the entire day. Only returned to the car when we drove back towards London. They do have trains and buses but cannot comment on any of them. 

**Sites**: *Cardiff Castle*. Purchased tickets last minute and spent awhile there. It was really cool. We didn’t book the guided tour and just did our own thing. The park next to the castle is pretty amazing and we enjoyed the gardens in the park.

*Cardiff Bay* is really cool to walk around. Our favorite building was the Pierhead Buidling. There’s a ton of shops in the plaza. We had a tour with Cardiff Boat Tours but they canceled last minute without warning or reason. The Cardiff Bay Giant Wheel was gone when we arrived. Unsure if it’s closed permanently or if it’s seasonal and will be back. Or maybe they moved it? We didn’t look too much into it even though it was on our agenda. 

*Cardiff Market* is a must. Great food and shops to poke around in. 

**Food**: We ate at The Welsh House and had there Cawl, which is lamb stew. Absolutely amazing.

* **Paris**

One of the people I was with speaks fluent French which made this part of the trip easier but we would have been fine had she not been with us. Most folks we ran into spoke English. 

We took EuroStar from London to Paris. Getting through immigration was quick and painless. We arrived an hour before departure and that was plenty time. I wasn’t impressed with EuroStar though. We purchased the tickets together six months ago and they sat us in different cars on both ends of the trip. We also requested one window and one aisle both forward facing (assuming we’d be sitting next to each other) and they put us both in aisle seats and rear facing on both ends of the trip.

  
**Getting Around:** They have a massive subway and bus system but we found the system to be miserable. It was overcrowded, expensive and uncomfortably hot, like sitting in a sauna. The trains do come every few minutes though and they’re signed well. However, both of our three day passes quit working several times. I had to wait in line four times to have it replaced and she had to wait three times over the course of three days. Only some announcements are in English unfortunately. We did not use buses, taxis or ride share but they were around. 

  
**Weather**: About the same as London except a lot more folks own umbrellas in Paris. It’s so bad that the sidewalks become uncomfortably crowded with umbrellas at the first drop of rain. Someone tell Parisian’s that they won’t melt when it rains. 

  
**Sites**: *Eiffel Tower:* The plaza under the tower is free and offers a nice view. We went to the summit which was worth it but they let all the tour groups go ahead of us which was annoying. Not sure if that’s common. We opted to take the stairs down but didn’t ask if we were allowed to take them up. I wishes we had because the elevators were so crowded. The tower twinkles for five minutes on the hour after dark. The pedestrian bridge across the Seine is a good place to watch it. We set up 45 minutes early to record it and three minutes after it started a group tried to push in front of us but we held our ground. The peddlers are persistent and annoying here. 

*Arc de Triomphe:* Very cool to see from the outside. We didn’t go in. There’s a pedestrian tunnel under the roundabout, don’t try to run across the road like we saw some folks doing. 

*Basilique du Sacre-Coeur de Montmartre*: Also worth seeing. We climbed the stairs to the top and there’s an amazing view of the city. The peddlers here are more persistent and one of them grabbed my girlfriends arm and I almost lost my temper. 

*The Louvre*: We had tickets for 0900, which is when they open. We arrived at 0815 to over 100 folks already in line. Once in we went straight to Mona Lisa and quickly saw as much as we could before the next two groups came in at 0930 and 1000. By the time we left at 1200 there were so many people in there it defeated the purpose of requiring reservations. 

*Seine River Cruise*: An hour cruise along the Seine. The tickets we booked were valid for a year and you could go any time between 1000 and 1700. Boats depart every 30 minutes. 

*Notre Dame*: Currently under renovations so covered in scaffolding. Expected to be completed by January 2025 but it seems like there’s a lot to do still. 

**Food**: We ate at several Boulangers and they were all amazing. The desserts especially. Carrefour was the best grocery store in the city IMO. We also shopped at Aldi and Monoprix. Both of the Aldi’s we went into were dirty and very unorganized. They also tried to make us open our backpacks on the way out but we just kept walking. They didn’t bother us either time. Monoprix was mostly empty shelves in the few we went into but sufficient for what we needed. I’m a coffee snob and all the coffee in Paris was the worst coffee I’ve ever had in my life. It didn’t matter where we went, it all tasted the same, burnt and nasty! One of the places we went to we ordered a caramel latte and the guy poured black coffee, added crème and mixed in caramel syrup in it. That, folks, tells you all you need to know about the coffee scene in Paris. 

**Overall**: Wasn’t too impressed with the city. It’s dirty, smells heavily of piss in areas and a ton of people smoke right outside the doors so even if you’re sitting inside you can’t avoid it. One of the store clerks was annoyed when I didn’t speak perfect French to her in a very touristy area of the city. My mistake. We should have rented a car here and not in London. 

* **Brussels**

We took EuroStar to/from Paris to/from Brussels. We were also sat apart despite purchasing our tickets together four months ago. Much quieter than Paris. 

**Getting Around:** We took EuroStar from Paris to Brussels/Midi. In the city we used their trains to get around. They run often and it was 8.65 euros for a day pass. 

**Weather**: While it was cold and rainy in Paris, it was nice and dry in Brussels. 

**Sites**: *Atomium*: The main reason we went. Built for the 1958 World Expo, it was the highlight of the day. We bought advanced tickets. 

*Grand Place:* Really cool to see both during the day and at night. Peddlers here but not as bad and they don’t bother you. 

*Parc du Cinquantenaire:* Super cool to see. Nice spot for photographs.

*Brussels Auto Museum:* I don’t even like cars but this museum was amazing. We bought tickets on the spot as we were looking for something to do and were already in the neighboring PDC. 

**Food**: You’re in Belgium, if you don’t eat Belgian waffles and Godiva chocolate, did you really go to Belgium? Anywhere we went had amazing waffles. We ate waffles twice that day and that was our lunch and supper. No shame. 

**Overall**: Another city where a lot people smoked and we were constantly dodging smokers. Fairly dirty as well. The architecture is amazing though. ",3,1729804908.0,Europetravel,4,1.0,False

I've been exploring ways how to generate the same character consistenly and make it as simple as possible without a need for 1000 node workflows with bunch of manual inputs.  
Now that FLUX is here, It pretty much solved most of the issues and simplified the workflows.

So I thought I might share my findings here.  
The workflow is not perfect and definitely could be adjusted, would love to hear your thoughts / suggestions.  
I will try my best to keep this as short as possible...

**There are 3 steps in this workflow:**

1. Generate images of your character using SD 1.5 workflow.
2. Use these images to generate a FLUX LoRa of your character.
3. Use your LoRa to generate images with FLUX workflow.

**Step 1:** SD 1.5 Workflow [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ug2pT-eYeTMhVX9xFGTsqFB3awslKfuG/view?usp=drive_link) / [Preview](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y1e7lIFVyLytIk3b6ptfZB2dLhcoG2ho/view?usp=sharing)  
Technically, if your PC can't run FLUX, you can get a consistent character in this step alone.  
Since you can achieve a lot with just a proper prompt structure, I found out that at the beginning of your prompt you need to input two different, full names next to each other, and SD 1.5 will give you a consistent face most of the times, it's not 100% accurate but it's close. **(This prompt logic also works with Auto1111)**

**Positive Prompt:** `photo of a woman on a white studio background, close-up portrait, Mia Smith, Lily Johnson, a woman with deep brown eyes, long flowing chestnut hair styled in loose curls cascading over her shoulders, possessing a heart-shaped face, she is in her early 30s, of Caucasian descent, and has an hourglass figure.

Age LoRa does a decent job but you really need to adjust the prompt for it work properly.  
Inside the file I provided above, where you can find prompt inputs, there you can also find recommended LoRa values for each age group. They are not super accurate but it will help you understand how it works.

**Step 2:** Create a LoRa using your generated images.

This step will be short, there are many ways how to generate a LoRa, I will only share the way I found most usefull, but I'm sure any other way will give you the same or even better results. (I might add some more details to this step in the future, if there will be interest)

I used **FLUX-Dev-LoRa-Trainer:** [Here](https://replicate.com/ostris/flux-dev-lora-trainer/train) to create a LoRa of my character. (Used around 30 images)  
You can also check out on twitter ""TheLastBen"" he shares interesting findings about FLUX LoRa generation and how to get more accurate results, his account: [Here](https://x.com/__TheBen)

**Notes:** SD 1.5 only generates images in 512x768 size but for FLUX LoRa it is recommended to have square images that are 1024x1024 in size... for me, the SD 1.5 default image size worked just fine.  
I had some minor technical issues when generating images in step 3... and I think it might have something to do with the image sizes.  
So cropping images in square might save you some headache down the road... but I'm not 100% sure, need to test it more.

**Step 3:** FLUX Workflow [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Jj9zTERu5TDPr-wzLiqYkvHsNsdZy15/view?usp=sharing) / [Preview](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rljx9XwrhyRoiC2w3-EF5Fc2WwQbmCrT/view?usp=sharing)

This workflow consists of basic image generator with LoRa (This is where you add your generated LoRa)

**Files you need for this workflow + where to put them:**  
My GPU can't handle the best FLUX models available, so that's why i'm using the model that i'm using...  
if yours can, feel free to adjust it to your liking.

**Sample prompt:** `Photo of a Mia woman sitting on the steps of a cozy café on a rainy day, medium shot, wearing a thick knitted sweater and jeans. She’s holding a steaming cup of coffee with both hands, her legs crossed, and a serene smile on her face as she watches the rain fall, her damp hair framing her face.`

`Foreground: A few scattered raindrops are visible on the camera lens, while wet leaves from nearby trees rest on the café steps. A black iron table is partially in view, holding a small plate with an untouched pastry.`

`Background: The street beyond is blurred by the rain, with the warm glow of nearby streetlamps reflecting off the wet cobblestone. Potted plants and hanging lights from the café add to the cozy, inviting atmosphere as the rain softly pours.`

**Notes:**

This is a good example of how to structurize your prompt to get really nice results, just like the ones you see above.

About ""hand fixing workflow"" sometimes it doesn't understand what part of the image is a hand and it actually can give you worse results, it's a hit or miss situation.

About ""face enhancer"" I only enable it when my subject is further from camera.  
It will do a good job on fixing the face.

**Also heres a chart for FLUX Sampler+Scheduler pairs.**

Hey everyone!

Hope everyone’s doing well. I’m just here bored at work lol.

I’m just looking for more friends that like to write/rp and draw! I’m honestly very open-minded with subject matters. I used to be the kind of artist that did a lot of self-inserts back in the day, and I even wrote fanfiction xD

I play a lot of single player games and FFXIV on my pc. I have a ps5 and am slowly going through FF7Rebirth. I get distracted a lot.

TV shows… let’s see. I watch a bit of anime; so stuff like Elusive Samurai, that one anime with crow people that has a name I can never remember. I also read manga too. Finally getting into Vagabond and Vinland Saga. Berserk and Witch Hat Atelier are my absolute favs.  
I’m watching ‘Dark Winds’ with my partner, and I usually end up just watching the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice as a comfort show. LoTR is my comfort movie as far as trilogy’s go. I’m a little picky with actual tv shows though and am totally fine with foreign ones too. Jordskott was a favorite of mine to watch!

I don’t read as often as I’d like sadly, kinda dropped the ball with it.

Anyways! Besides all that I like hot Cheeto fries and coffee (not together that sounds terrible for both ends lol). Botanical gardens, museums, observatories, the zoo or the aquarium, anything where I can be outside and just learn about stuff and see nature is always a good thing for me. Also coffee shops, I am not a coffee expert,  but I love the smell of it! Also with some pan dulce or something is good.

I’m a Latina and non-binary. Fashion style is kind of goth/alt and always sleepy lol. I speak Spanish and I’m looking to get back into practicing that and maybe Japanese or Swedish again.

Fun fact: I’ve been to Sweden a couple of times

I’m looking for friends closer in age that like joking around and can also be mature at times. I’m burnt out from being the therapy friend all the time so I just want people I can be a dork with and relax a little.

1gbdj8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1gbdj8d/10_years_of_life_after_the_first_psychosis_on_my/,"10 years of life, after the first psychosis. On my Mental Health Journey","My story started when I was 16 in 2013, and that year, two of my best High School friends passed away. One by a car accident, and then a close friend of mine committed suicide in grief concerning our friend dying, leaving in his Instagram bio for the rest of time to read, ""I'll see you one day, buddy""

Before my friend passed away, we went on a summer vacation with friends to another friend's house to stay over a weekend. We got in a huge fight, and we had a major falling out. I didn't talk to him before he died.

The last time I saw my best friend, who I had homeroom class with every day, was at my friend's funeral.

Then, before that, he was expelled from school for becoming behaviorally reckless and bringing a bottle of alcohol to school to drink through the day. Right before he was caught and arrested at school, he saw me in his last class of homeroom, where he tried to get me to take the bottle from him ""because they were onto him.""

I said no because I didn't want to get in trouble myself. I could've easily taken that bottle and stashed it or trashed it somewhere from my book bag, and he would've possibly never gotten caught with it. He was acting a fool, and his breath reeked. I still second-guess this.

\-

When I turned 17 in 2014, my Senior year of High School, a girl met me, and it was love at first sight. The week I met her, I experienced what the Doctor at the Hospital called a ""First break, prodromal psychosis.""

During my first ""episode,"" I experienced my first Command Hallucination phrases from auditory hallucinations and delusions.

In my new homeroom class, after being transferred from my friend passing away. Meeting all new people that year after - I met this girl over the weekend at a school soccer game. She was very shy the last time we met. She approached me without saying a word, outlined my stenciled ""Stussy"" shirt, and asked what it meant. She was very coy, didn't say a word to me, blushed, smiled like a child, and ran off laughing like a kid.

The people I sat with were talking about meeting her at a party over the same weekend that I met her at a soccer game.

They were talking about taking advantage of her and trying to get her drunk so they could ""Bring her to the back room and hook up with her."" One of the girls at the table exclaimed that one of the guys was ""All over her, and she wanted him off."" I jumped out of my skin emotionally and lashed out verbally. Attempting to fight one of my classmates,

These were the group and type of kids that my group and type of people hated morally, and we rivaled. One of my other best friends, and best friends with my now-dead friend. Kicked in this guy's car door because they came by his house to punk on him. The same guy, the owner of the house party, and his girlfriend cheated on him with me at age 15 because she said she hated him. We were considered ""Rat or trashy"" by this other ""In-group,"" and she was just meeting these people for the first time that night. I was attempting to protect her from these awful people, and that's simply what I was trying to do: save my love for her and me.

Also, the same guy that he and his friends showed up to my dead best friend's funeral uninvited to sit in the back, acting like they paid their respects. To come out with years later making a Soundcloud song mocking my dead best friend, saying that he should be dead.

I continued in my psychosis that day. Remembering, thinking I was a highly intuitive psychic time-traveler.

For some reason or the other. I had the rationale of believing that the girl that I met was endangered by these people after this incident that day in her classes, and I became concerned. Becoming so delusional that I left one of my classes to search for her in random classrooms.

I landed on a teacher who told me in the past, a year before after my friend's death. ""If I ever had an emergency, you can come to my classroom. I can take all the students out of the class. I can help you."" So this happened, and we called my parents. My parents were on the way from work to pick me up because I started to become concerned for my mental health. They were going to take me to the hospital. - During this encounter, the school police were involved and began questioning me when in the room after the call. I started to become paranoid, thinking I was under arrest and going to jail. I started to become delusional and verbally violent with the officer in disrespect without reason. The police officer ran at me, tackled me onto the floor, and arrested me.

I screamed for my life Bloody Mary, and every single surrounding classroom heard me. Students came to the door, trying to get into it to save me.

I got expelled from school for ""Fighting a police officer"" and resisting arrest, when never under any crime committed to arrest me. Only able to come back on a medical waiver from the hospital and on thin ice.

\-

When I arrived at the hospital, my first grandiose delusion was the Shutter Island theme. I fought with the nurses on admittance and became hostile because I was delusional and thought they were lying to my parents to separate me from them.

They held me down in an 8-point procedure and briefly held a plastic bag to prevent me from spitting on them. They injected Ativan into my IV, and my vision faded from colored vision to black, like turning off an old-school television.

\-

Coming back to High School a week later, experienced the daydream nightmare of the immaturity of teens in High Schools. Like me, Dorthy of bullying, dealing with hazing, and two-faced liars intentionally stigmatizing and creating mis-socialization-ally drama to misinform others about my false identity reputation. Marginalizing my life without chance or opportunity to show worthiness or growth. Stunting my whole lifeline,

Also, the day terror of sitting in front of all the people had just experienced everything that happened the week before during class like it didn't happen.

Whipped cream on top was going to a soccer game the next weekend. To watch the girl that fell in love with me at first sight. Walking up to her while she was sitting alone in the stands, attempting to sit around near her to start a conversation about what happened so I could explain it. She stood up and ran off without a word right as I sat down and said, ""Hey,""

The cherry on top was during my psychosis. I had the delusion that one of my friends at the lunch table across from me during my episode was texting this girl, I grabbed his phone out of his hand. He said, ""She's not in my contacts,"" I scrolled down his list and found her in his phone book. I got her # out of it and - then started to text her over the next month.

She started to reply, and I would text her every morning before school - like my dead best friend had taught me to do with girls. To wake them up with a smile every day, ... So I would text her ""Good morning"" and even do it normally without a reply. At one point after this, I asked her if she liked me, and she said, ""Yes.""

Over time, after this. I don't remember what happened because she just randomly stopped replying out of the blue one day. I still haven't talked to her in person, a whole conversation. Just a simple, Hello, Goodbye.

\-

After graduating High School in 2015, we followed each other on Instagram for 2 years. I got the Follwers+ app, and it showed my insights, her being my #1 liked on all photos.

I had not yet said anything about my Hospitalization up to this point and kept my experiences to myself with my trauma. Going to therapy and trying to resolve it. Unsuccessful, grieving the reality that would come if I became vulnerable to her when telling her the truth of my visit.

I saw her from time to time when I would go out and get something to eat. One time, when she was working at a Hostess job, she waved at me, and I put my head down in my hat and walked past her through the door. I saw her at a friend of friends, a foreign exchange student party. I guarded her in basketball and made her laugh, bouncing goofy on a trampoline. I saw her at two graduation parties, and we played volleyball together on a team. We also had an exclusive night, where all my old High School friends played soccer 5-5, where she showed up. I picked her to be on my team in line-up as captain. Also scored on her nutmeg while the goalie ran around with my shirt over my head. Victorious, her guy friend we played soccer with that night, was good friends with me and took her to prom, and told me, ""She was happy to see me that night""

In this era of my life, I was delusional. Dropped out of school due to trauma and paranoia. To start selling marijuana by the pound, to escape my judgmental Hometown. I planned to run away to Europe and become homeless & nameless. Sleeping on Euro-Star trains nightly traversing the country's borderlines, moving around enough to never been seen. My wish.

Robbed at gunpoint during a deal that went South one night over 3/4 a pound of weed.

\-

In 2016, I moved on to a new girl about a year after this. Meeting someone new online. She liked my photos on Instagram and was from my old High School. She followed me, and I DM'd her. We started to talk for a week,

Sympathizing toward her Dad's Stage 3-Terminal Lung Cancer, we began to bond over her struggle, empowering her strength.

My at-the-time best friend from High School. Knew this girl, and when I told him I was talking to her - He looked at me like he had seen a ghost and didn't say a word as the hair on my arms stood up in the deafening stare of silence.

He said, ""I shouldn't be talking to her,"" and wouldn't explain why. I thought it was because he was family friends with their family. It didn't make sense to me at the time, it was a very big head-scratcher.

Over the next few days, I was messaging her still, and she became less and less frequent in replies, reply text emotions, and length. I thought she was depressed because of her Father. The last messages I remember sending her were, ""You are strong,""

The next day, after waking up and realizing I was out of the blue, blocked. I received a random text message from an old High School classmate I used to sell weed to. He had made up some whole elaborate scheme of a lie of a story. Saying that, him, and this girl that I was talking to - for a whole week. ""Had a boyfriend, and I'm her boyfriend. You need to stop talking to her; she doesn't want you talking to her. Me bothering her and creeping on her.""

This conversation delineated and descended into madness. I rivaled him, knowing this wasn't the truth. Having zero photos on her Instagram of him or even mentioning him once during the week, she contacted me. He ended up telling me to ""Go hang myself,"" and I figured out it wasn't the truth. The last message I read from him was before putting my phone down and started calling people for days to find out where he lived.

Even worse, after this. I decided to further my investigation of what was going on with my reputation that I didn't know about wasn't my idea of my own life but others' disrespectful perception.

I took to Instagram to air out the dirty laundry of the conversation between me and the guy who texted me. Losing 500 followers in 2 days. I messaged the best friend of the girl who had just blocked me. She was my older brothers, Ex-girlfriends' younger sister. I thought I could trust her enough, having conversations with her in the past. She told me that ""in 1-2 years, her best friend who blocked me would be coming out as lesbian, and that she was unsure about her sexual emotions towards men and me"". She had said that she liked me, but I was starting to pressure her into love or romance because I thought she wanted a relationship by messaging me. - I believed it, and this was a 2-year long lie that I believed.

\-

After this lie was told to me in 2017, I thought that we all were literally ""Best friends forever"" because she just told me her best friend's deepest, darkest secret that she'd be coming out within 1-2 years.

This also led me into delusional thinking and thought that since now these girls were friends with me, she was a lesbian. I could move on to a new girl or what I poorly decided to do looking back. I went back to the first girl - her being friends with these girls. That I thought I had a second chance, her being a lesbian. I had feelings for in High School that I met at the Soccer Game, that I had my episode over.

This fooled me into delusional thinking that these people were my friends. Literally,

I made a Twitter account. Because I thought I was popular, and I started following all of these people who lied to me because I wanted to speak on the topic over social media so I could follow my friends and clear the air to get my reputation back.

I followed and messaged the first girl that I met in High School at the soccer game - trying to rekindle our relationship. Thinking we were friends now, us all being in on the know-how.

I started to Tweet, but this is when my first manic/depressive episode happened. Back when Twitter was 140 characters, I tweeted 500 tweets. Opening up about the Hospital because I felt comfortable about my new ""friends"" accepting me, and I wanted my whole community to know about this story now. Us being friends and feeling wanted and belong.

The girl from High School got a No-Contact Restraining order against me.

She didn't even read a single one of the Tweets I sent and just saw her name mentioned and filed it. Because now this was technical-ly ""harassment and cyber-stalking""

\-

I still was fully under the delusional, misinformed perception that this other girl was fully a lesbian and was coming out in College in 1-2 years. After he Father passed away, she had time to heal. Feel comfortable.

I tried to express this story to my old friends over social media. That had now ghosted me, unfollowed me, and blocked my number.

I didn't know what was going on; I was in the dark for 2 years. No one, not a single person. No old ""friend"" decided to tell me anything about it - likely such a well-hidden secret targeting character assassination that all these other people my old friends hung out with. Lied to them. To rid me,

I sat on Social Media over Twitter for two whole years, with 0 followers, tweeting my life and heart out away, trying to make up for the past and be forgiven. Through reconciliation, I went to church weekly for the whole time. Thinking that Jesus had ""Blessed Me"" - Waiting 2 years for this girl to never come out. To figure it was a lie.

One year of realization of this lie and no friends later. I attempted a suicide mission to talk to the girl from High School at the soccer game. On the address where it was put on the restraining order to stay away from. I wanted to die and prayed, too.

I got arrested after showing up at her College dormitory campus of 40,000 people. Twice, two days in a row. Searching for her name on the dorm doors. I was going to knock on her door and wished she was inside to speak to her. It was my dying wish, almost looking back. 7 years ago this week,

I went to Jail for 9 days only. Thinking it would be more severe ""Stalking"" charges, which I literally Googled and researched before because that's what I wanted to catch, to keep myself in jail long enough to be killed by an inmate.

My parents could've bailed me out on day two but hung up on me over the phone in a screaming match while staring at inmates who wanted to kill me over my charges.

I went to the Hospital for two weeks after this and was misdiagnosed as bipolar.

\-

I went to therapy monthly, which was mandatory for my plea deal while on probation back in 2017-18, with the same therapist for one whole year. Talking about this story and about how she was a ""Lesbian,"" and I hung out with one friend in this entire timeline of my probation of two years.

The night I hung out with my one friend from High School, an old best friend, was for 1 hour. His girlfriend at the time went to the College I showed up at. He harassed me deceptively in front of my face, to hang out with me to ""Figure out what's going on in my life,"" my guess, and poked around making fun of my life, all while calling me a friend.

At one point, making up a game and scenario where we would ""Imagine our future lives,"" He started to get sinister and said, ""I could see you being physically abusive towards your future wife and just lightly slapping her around.""... it got dark for no reason in particular. I didn't even say what I thought his life would be or look like. I didn't get it, and I couldn't believe he went all that way just to make it like that. In awe to this date, appalled,

He got cancer 2 years later and didn't let me visit him once while it was happening,

My other best friend, the one that looked like he saw a ghost when I was talking to the new girl. I hung out with him one night after this incident, when after I got diagnosed. I talked to him, and we bro'd it out. Apologized and agreed to disagree on the topic. He had changed drastically, and he and his girlfriend I knew from High School. Weren't even going to tell me they were planning on getting married together soon. I found out later after on Instagram, not hearing about it when we hung out together, and he didn't even tell me it was going to happen. Most likely, they didn't want me asking to come, or be invited, or even think of such ideas.

I had received a \*67 Caller ID prank call, with a girl disguising her voice as a man. I heard snickering and laughter from boys and girls in the background. They had asked me ""Did you get laid by that one girl at the cul-de-sac party?"", Putting the idea later together in time ""The Block Party"" .... Up to this point in my life I haven't talked to a girl in 5 years.

I started to make over-the-phone death threats, and then, over the internet on Social Media on Twitter, I had a mental breakdown where I name-called and put death threats on my social media to people I thought had my number and were messing with me.

The police were called, and I got in trouble by them filing a report! They interrogated me in front of my parents, and I told them what was going on with me. They believed me, but told me to not go about doing it that way, ... I was just triggered and exploded in rage.

I kept up the Twitter, unknowing of the idea that she wasn't lesbian, or not being real. Trying to communicate with the first girl with the restraining order, to reconcile forgiveness. Attempting to persuade her to love me again, and negotiate a deal between us to have happiness because it wasn't me, but my mental illness.

Speaking to no one about it, and thinking that I shouldn't come out with her lesbian secret because he Father passed away from Lung Cancer now. I didn't aim to disrespect.

I met an old High School friend I used to sell weed to at a gas station one night, ironically enough. His girlfriend at the time who was with him, was best friends with the girl who had the restraining order on me. He came up to me in line, behind me, and stuck out his hand to handshake, and say ""What's up"", like nothing happened.

I messaged him on Snapchat, and he filled me in on a major truthful update. He said that the girl I thought was a lesbian; wasn't. The girl with the restraining order was getting a second one, and she was also ""Happier without me""

Coming shortly later to find a couple months later, on her newly created Facebook. She was dating the guy who was the host of the party back in High School, best friends with one of the guys who tried to take advantage of her in High School. The guy that his girlfriend in High School Freshman year cheated on me because she hated him. The guy that got his car door kicked in by my best friend, and my now dead best friend. Also, the same guy that he and his friends showed up to my dead best friend's funeral uninvited to sit in the back, acting like they paid their respects. To come out with years later making a Soundcloud song mocking my dead best friend saying that he should be dead. Also found out she joined a sorority and started to become egotistically classy.

She had also stated that I was ""Visionless, and controlling"" and, I needed ""to be happy, to be in a relationship""

\-

I became suicidal again in 2019, but was hospitalized after writing a suicide note and put on medicine shortly after dropping out of college for the third time due to being symptomatic from stress.

I went to therapy for years after this, and after being discharged by my last therapist for ""inability to treat client, needs a higher level of treatment"" I bounced around from therapist to therapist.

One time being called a stalker, and then by another an ""Incel""

My parents started to fight so much over the last years, with this idea and with me. Talking of divorce, and fighting screaming at each other in death matches with me. My Mother stated to me out loud once in a fight over this topic where she chose their side for years against me. ""I don't know who you are anymore!""

Getting in a fistfight with my Father where I knocked him out unconscious when he told me ""I'm glad I kept you in jail for longer and didn't bail you out""

My brother abandoned me. Not talking to me for whole years. Disliking me If we already didn't get along before enough a verbal fight with him one night brought out the idea, and words that I was a ""Fuck up""

\-

In 2020, I had another hospitalization, this one being my fourth and fifth.

I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Originally, just diagnosed bipolar but it was a misdiagnosis. Unmedicated improperly for 4 whole years. In and out of psychosis, delusions, hallucinations. Etc,.

I had contacted the friend that met me at the gas station, that I used to sell weed to back in High School. He said that he can talk to her about it, and we talked back and forth for about a week.

He said that she said ""It had been so long since we met, and everything including us has changed. We weren't the same anymore, and we didn't have the same alignment that we used to have growing up.

That sunk me like a rock to the bottom, and I was told that she was moving states. 8 hours away.

4 years had passed on the restraining orders, and restraining orders only last 2 years til you have to decide if you need to refile. Or it becomes permanent if necessary.

She didn't renew the restraining orders. When she had enough evidence to.

Months later, I kept tallies of her Instagram over the years. Dreaming of being unblocked and happy together once again. I kept tallies on her friend's Instagram too, to check to see if she was in the photos; or if they left me little coded messages like they used to back in the restraining order to communicate how they felt towards me with what I was saying.

I found one day on her best friend's Instagram, saying ""You're not alone"", ""I set you free for freedom's sake :)!, Never give up, there are always brighter days around the corner.""

I deleted my Instagram, in rage and realization of a reversal in loss of time. I took it more than personally.

I was frustrated with life.

\-

During the next two years 2021, & 2022,

I took medicine and looked around for jobs. Couldn't find therapy. One friend at the time, who then suddenly passed away on his birthday night took him to the bars to drink.

He co-piloted me that night and wing-manned me because he knew about my story. I grew up being diagnosed with abandonment issues, trust issues, and avoidant personality disorder.

I had met a girl, with him. He let us be, and I got her number that night. Took him home and talked all about it, smoked a blunt before he went inside for the last time. Talked about music, and how art needs to be relevant,.

He left his lighter in my car that night by accident, and in the morning when I figured out he passed away. I found his lighter that reads ""Going Nowhere Fast""

He smoked about two packs a day and worked 80+ weeks, he passed away from a widow-maker heart attack. Age 25. Had an undiagnosed murmur. The military never spotted it in his service.

I worked around at my Dad's janitor's office for $3,600 a year. Couldn't get any jobs anywhere; not even Walmart with my misdemeanor ""Invasion of privacy"" charges. I wouldn't even get calls back after two interviews, and companies would flat out ignore me like I was obsolete.

I worked terrible, under-the-table jobs where I would make cash and often manipulated out of money.

Quitting wear house jobs on the spot multiple times because I was unable to keep up with demands.

\-

2023, &

I was talking to a doctoral-level psychologist, who was also a therapist. She was a trauma care specialist, and she also specialized in intellectual disability to name a few. She is no longer my therapist. She had me sign up for an Autism Screening Test, which I never ended up taking.

Before she dropped me as her patient.. she said after jail & the hospital ""I was trying to have a relationship with her""

?

In 2019 when I went to the psych ward at Methodist after a voluntary commitment for suicidal ideation, I got evaluated for a week for Autism.

The same dual doctorate resident who told me that she thought I was on the spectrum sat me down, and told me she wanted to take me out of the ward after the week's evaluation and take me to ""meet the other people just like me, to get to know myself better"". I told her ""No, I don't want to go"" because I had been there for 3 weeks and it was a day before my birthday that I got discharged, and told. 

I had an unmedicated delusion. Where I stopped taking medicine from when I started in 2021-2023 after my diagnosis.

I bought that same first girl that forgave me and had restraining orders on me a Tiffany Charm Clasp Bracelet for $1,500 off my parent's credit card, because I thought they were Satanists, and wanted to make it up to her and piss them off for messing up my life abusing me emotionally.

I got into a delusional fight about thinking my parents were living a double life as Free Masonic demonic worshipers. Which wasn't even close to the truth, just found an old Free Mason book on our bookshelf from 2000, where my Dad attended an introductory meeting with his friend when he was trying to sell him insurance.

I told my Father priest about this on the day of The Feast of Guardian Angels, and while my parents were out of town on vacation when I went into madness.

My priest gave me a holy water bottle blessed to smite Satan. With the book wrapped in a towel after touching it, reading 5 pages then, slamming it shut. An Angel appeared and took the book in the image. because I vacated my house thinking it was cursed terrified. He told me to douse the house with holy water to sleep & shower plus eat.

I got detained by my local police for disturbing the peace when getting into an argument with my parents, my Dad called the cops on me. At my house after they got home.

I was taken to the local hospital, by a police officer that heard out my story & gave me $100.

I took an Uber with the money he gave me after I got dropped off at the ER. Waiting for Secure Holding. The wait was 6 hours.

I went to my therapist's office in crisis and instead decided to go to the ER up there for me to try and get sleep medication because I hadn't rested in a week.

The medical staff at the hospital said they couldn't help me, or prescribe me any medicine. They instead diagnosed with me Anxiety Disorder and then discharged me from the ER at 4 am in 25 minutes. When it was 20 degrees outside, telling them I had nowhere to go; homeless. Other people were sleeping on the chairs in covers. (probably homeless too)

The Resource Security Officer started to threaten me. I started to argue with him, and I walked out.

For some reason -- My delusions, and hallucinations took hold of me spiritually. I was enraged by my self-evident situational outcome.

I filled up the Holy Water vial with water and marched up into the ER. Threw the water on the officer's face that kicked me out, and ran out. Getting away. Dropping my phone in the process,

I walked about a mile on the premises, into a building where I thought I was secure to catch my breath from running.

The police stormed in, and arrested me saying ""Hand's on Officer, Officer down"". Portraying that I assaulted the man physically with my body.

When I saw the Officer again he had red all over his face, I don't know what caused that. Maybe analgesic reaction

They took me to the County Jail, where I was put into Cell Block C, with accused charges to be arraigned of Felony Battery

I was met quickly with inmates checking me. I was punished being my size, and weight. Being in jail before, I knew this wouldn't be an easy trip.

Entering at exactly 7:07 am the Officer checked when held for 20 minutes at the gates, with my confirmation Saint Maximillion statue in my possession in my book bag that they detained me with.

I was getting out alive determined.

Not understand that the complex only allowed one five-minute call per inmate each week without pay. Having no money in my account, calling my parents to let them know, before being cut off unknowingly mid-conversation. 

A despot inmate, after me sneezing once from likely dust being in the facility; Accused me of having COVID-19, and started a fight that began with him charging at me to pull me off the 6ft top double bunk I was lying in.

I jumped off, scared from the drop. Him all in my personal space and area. Tried to chase him out of my bunk, to then be knocked out. I sprung back up, after hitting the back of my head on a metal bench seat.

An inmate behind me picked me up and led me back to my bed. Where I passed out for hours. 

I wake in the middle of chaos and have to defend myself from the guards, never noticing the camera.

The place was wild, with people smoking weed & spice in the showers. Passing lines of Coke through the neighboring cell block doors.

People were coming in, and multiple jumpers were being witnessed where these killers left other inmates bathed in blood and tears from head to toe.

I hid amongst the Fear of God with the other prayer group of inmates reading Bible study in the block. With rife Hell Raising gang members telling me now, ""Don't press charges against him,"" thinking this was the only way out of the block.

Being told, ""I was lucky because they stomped someone to death in this cell block here two weeks ago""

Now, knowing from other inmates if I went into the medical or the suicide room. I could save myself.

Talking to one of the guards about in the morning to check back on the cameras, honestly trying to get out alive with my life.

Going to medical to be evaluated for my wounds after being forced by a gang leader to leave the block or else, after realizing staying in the block wasn't my best bet.

They transferred me and put me into cold isolation, given food with no utensils. No toilet paper for half the day.

Officers came to my cell after my claims in medical. Stated that I charged after him, and the person trying to hurt me wasn't trying to hurt me ""On their million-dollar camera system,"" now me being the assailant when I never touched anyone. Knocked unconscious, apparently, ""I was never knocked out"" since I got up so quickly.

Then they tried to mitigate the situation by trying to force me to sign papers saying that I wasn't going to press charges on him when I was now being arraigned on more different charges, going to trial now for two cases, in jail.

In the meantime, while waiting, arraigned by the magistrate. I got my other charges lowered to A & B misdemeanors with a $500 bond.

Being moved into another block after medical & isolation, waiting until further notice. Realizing I was now transferred to the Sex Offender's block, behind two locked steel doors.

I was unable to call my parents, and now also I do not know my account login & password. The inmates in the other cellblock stole my paperwork, hacked my account, and took the other $40 in my possession that the first officer gave me out of my wallet into their commissary for coffee.

I was unable to manage to get an officer to help me for days, obviously ignored intentionally. Buzzing on the intercom for hours throughout the day to help me log into my account to make one final call.

Being only told over the intercom that I was being moved back into the same cell block that I started in.

I lucked out, and they had to sanitize the whole block head to toe because somebody complained about lice being found in their bunk. Shaving our heads off and making us shower naked in front of them to make sure no spread.

I managed to convince an inmate to give me a free 5-minute call off his account. After two days. Telling me, ""Never give up,"" after ringing me up a call.

My parents picked up, and I tried to calmly explain my situation. It ended with them telling me, ""We'll be there to pick you up in the morning, we're going to bed."" Hung up on.

I hadn't slept in 4 days straight, on top of the week in psychosis before. I wasn't eating food, only water fasting with Kool-Aide sugar packet water because the food was inedible.

In the morning, before breakfast is served. I got my call to be arraigned on my second-coming charges, and then I was supposed to be moved back.

Walking in the hallway and into the elevators.

Passing another Officer that had my RO (Release Out) paperwork. Noticed my face and said, ""Is this ""....., ....... ?"". The officer handling me was surprised, feet away from the courtroom.

Walked me in and asked the Judge if I was ""Free to go?"" and the Judge nodded.

""He's free to go.""

I also got my first charge dropped after two months out of jail, and I pleaded insanity.

\-

During my 3 1/2 week hospital visit after jail. Where I fought verbally and emotionally with the Head Doctor this time over my ""Autism misdiagnosis""

I made a ""friendship bracelet"" that said the girl's name that I fell in love with back in High School and the same one that got a restraining order on me. It was for a memory's sake because I was losing track of time.

Meeting a lady there for two weeks and on her last two days before getting discharged. She told me that she was diagnosed with Pulmonary Lung Cancer,

Another patient told me that he was going to kill himself, and I made friends with him. He had just been released from prison and moved here. He was depressed and shot himself in the mouth; a bullet ricocheted into his skull. Making him eyeless in one eye and not killing him.

During my inpatient stay, I was notified that my charges from 2017 were expunged.

\-

This year, 2024.

My Grandfather had been battling a five-year-long battle with his health in decline because of Alzheimer's'. Passing away this year.

My Dad got abusive drunk one night, saw that I spent $200 at a museum gift shop in a manic episode,

I came home, and me and I got into a fight where he attempted to choke me and grabbed me by the throat. The neighbors heard us fighting the whole night, and weirdly enough, right as my Dad grabbed my throat. The doorbell rang simultaneously, and a police officer heard me scream, ""HELP!"" My dad grabbed my neck, and my Mom tried to break us apart.

Police officer waving red beam dot in my face and all across my whole family chest,

Right after the police kicked in my Childhood home door

I had an NDE where I tried to take my own life. I drove at 100mph and crashed into a tree line on purpose, totaled my car, and salvaged it. I didn't have a seat belt on, and my kneecaps went under the steering wheel, coming out walking on my own with just getting two stitches to my right eye. 

I received a DUI that night but was only taken to the hospital because I was only high and not drunk, they took my blood level and found six months later that I had marijuana in my bloodstream. They let me go that night without arresting me. 

I received an EEG where it was for my ""Autism misdiagnosis"" and confirmed that I was still schizoaffective bipolar. 40x higher more sensitivity than the regular human to anxiety. OCD,

Also, a life-changing diagnosis. Amnestic Disorder. Or, Hereditary, Short-Term Memory Loss.

Six months later, at the start of the month. On the 2nd, I was issued my charges for my arrest for my DUI, but then the next day, I had two warrants for my arrest. 

I had been in communication with the local Crisis Intervention team at my local county police department after I was arrested, and trying to explain to her it was me trying to take my life. They sympathized and talked to the prosecutor, who talked to the judge who had my bail posted before being arrested and jailed.  So I wouldn't have to sit in jail for 24 hours until seeing a judge, getting my bail posted, and then being bailed out. 

The same guy that made fun of my dead best friend and dated the love of my life. Drove past me when I drove by his road the other day near his house. He laughed visibly from his windshield; I could see when spotting me driving in the opposite direction on the road from him going to his house.

I had posted about my most recent suicide attempt online to my social media, and the girl with the restraining order noticed. I posted about receiving the diagnosis of Short Term Memory Loss, and ironically enough. Her college's sorority's main donation focus is Memory loss, with Dementia & Alzheimer's. Have raised and donated more than $9 million to the Alzheimer’s Association.

I may be delusional again, but she seems receptive to the diagnosis but sad and concerned about the failed suicide attempt.

I deleted my Instagram recently to make a new one. I got blocked by her again, but she was her best friend. The same one that told me, ""You're not alone,"" & ""I set you free for freedom's sake! :). Never give up there are always brighter days around the corner."" ... She doesn't have me blocked, which she has for the last 5 years on my other Instagrams'.

I've followed her a lot and unfollowed her to notify her phone through Instagram follower request notifications for a silent alarm message to check my Instagram. I've been posting new photos.

I've been tagging her friend in posts and commenting on photos' atting her, allowing me to talk to her. Apologizing and trying to make her happy on her birthday month.",1,1729804316.0,schizophrenia,0,1.0,False

I'm an alumni back from 2001 aka before the current student population was even born. 

So I'm working as a care coordinator in vocational rehab/social services with people just getting off welfare benefits and back to work and I'm working with someone who just got a job working graveyard security shift at a shelter for unhoused people. Great gig for this individual. Very happy for them. Steady service work. They are a night owl who loves helping people. Awesome deal.

So the thing is they are a single parent of an 8 year old. Now, LA County provides childcare assistance to people receiving benefits. So, I figured it was reasonable compensation. Ha ha. It's $30 a day for a friend or family member. Not exactly a wage a non-friend or family member would sign up for. And this individual is unable to supplement currently. They haven't been able to make their rent the last couple months.

But I was thinking - they have something else valuable - which is an apartment fairly close to UCLA.  Sawtelle and Santa Monica. Surely there must be a nice college student with childcare or babysitting experience or even experience with siblings who would like a place to study and nap in exchange for taking an 8-year old to school a few mornings a week.

When I was going to UCLA we had housing boards and job boards. Now everything I'm seeing seems so official. Is there a place to post a job where the compensation is $30 and a place to study and sleep, and the duties are to wake a kid up, help him get fed, washed, brushed, dressed, and walk him two blocks to school?

Or is there anyone reading this who is like I NEED THIS?

Because I woulda loved something like this. I used to wake up at 5:00 am to beat the Valley traffic and go study at a coffee shop before class. 

Or is everyone in school online now anyway? (Get off my lawn vibes.)

Hours would be something along the lines of 11pm -  8am on Monday Tuesday Friday.

Thank you! Open to creative solutions! Or if anyone knows of childcare providers nearby that would be open to this sort of arrangement.

From the beginning this job has been a lot. I basically built the cafe from the ground up, I had to put together and code the espresso machine, code the ovens, unpack everything and make it look good, completely stock it, literally from the ground up. It’s been overwhelming to say the least. The cafe that occupied the cafeteria before had lost their chef a year prior, so one of old timers who’s been there for 20 years had to step up. Customers had the ability to order a burger at 7am for only 2 dollars, so imagine their distaste for when they came to me and god forbid I charge 3 dollars for a coffee. I mean really these are ppl living in the same 2024 economy as me and you working in corporate complaining about 3 dollars for a coffee and a 7 dollar breakfast sandwich. I was not trained in how to do anything other than my prior knowledge of coffee so the learning curve was big just because I was creating the learners manual myself. For a while I was just free falling into a sea of unhappy customers who wanted to old kitchen back and hated every cent they spent with me but would continue to return the next day. 

They had kept most of the old staff including the woman who had to step up as chef. Unfortunately she was unable to come in due to personal issues for 4 months, in that time I have met her a few times. The first time I met her she was in line with the director of the company and asked me how I’m doing with the job, I had said at first it was crazy but I feel like I finally got it. She then says in front of my director oh yea that’s what I heard everyone said you were struggling. So immediate distaste. On her first day back I have a rush I’m the only person working the coffee bar and breakfast for the whole building and I have line of 6 people. She comes over with bagels I had put in the fridge and was like where should I put these for you? I had left them in the fridge for a reason she then starts talking to my customer and says she hates what we’re doing now and begins to get in deep conversation with him mid rush. 

I now have customers asking about the old way we did things and complaining because she’s complaining to them. The next week she was trained to cover an important team member and took off the whole week, which really caused issues for the rest of us. She returned this week and idk I just can’t stand her everything she does pisses me off. 
She comes in late, she can’t cook, didn’t listen to the training and just insisted she knew how to do it, will just sit on the phone, and take a lunch break 10 mins before her service rush is about to start. She’s always asking me too many questions and I just don’t like that she doesn’t mind her business and she just talks like she thinks she’s the boss or something like idk I just can’t help it. 

I’ve stopped saying good morning to her but started saying it to everyone else, I make everyone coffee bc I know their orders and what they want but not her bc idk her and she never asks, anytime im talking to my boss she’ll come over and interrupt me mid sentence and then be like oh I’m sorry didn’t mean to so now I just interrupt her and say nothing I don’t even make eye contact with her. 
Today she did nothing while I had my rush she was taking smoke breaks and talking on the phone  but when I was standing around she’s like “oh could I help you with anything??” So then a few minutes later I was like “could you be helped with anything” and she was saying something but then I got a customer so I just walked away from her mid sentence. She came over later cut a customer in line to buy a candy bar for one of our coworkers we get everything for free and we all know that so I was just staring at her because like idk say something and she just stared until I said “can I help u with something” and she explained she wanted to buy it and I was like it’s free for us you’re good but idk at the same time

 I feel bad for even feeling this angry with her but I knew if I was nice she would be crossing my boundaries and be weird I just prefer she leaves me alone and stops doing all the nonsense but idk am I being too much of a bitch?  And how do I get over this feeling it doesn’t feel good to have to be like this. ",1,1729803045.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

We need a crosswalk at the Elliot Ave and 2nd St access to the IX complex NOW. This is a highly trafficked legal crossing with no markers to protect civilians from oncoming traffic. Elliot Ave is wide and straight with a steep hill that encourages people to accelerate — and they do!

Every year we have fatalities from speeding (both pedestrians and drivers) between 5th St and 6th down Elliot Ave. The 2nd St access to IX lies at the bottom of the hill. We have witnessed cars in this 25mph zone drive 40-50mph, letting gravity increase their speed as they prepare to go up another hill.

We have contacted the city about this issue and were quickly dismissed by the city’s acting traffic engineer. He suggested pedestrians walk a long loop out of their way and up the hill to Sixth Street or to 1st Street. This is his stock answer to requests for a marked crosswalk.

People DO NOT take inconvenient routes when there are already direct routes available just to use a marked crosswalk! The city’s traffic engineer’s suggestion is a great example of how Charlottesville city managers don’t understand how people actually use their streets.

The city’s traffic engineer has also used the ADA as an excuse for not installing a marked crosswalk at 2nd Street and Elliot Avenue. He claims that a marked crosswalk cannot be installed because there are no curb ramps there.

Fun fact: Curb ramps are missing there because of a violation of federal law by the city of Charlottesville! The city has neglected to obey Federal law and install curb ramps at that intersection when the street was repaved.

An online petition has been started as well as a paper petition — we will be collecting signatures until Nov 5th, where we will present our petition to the Mayor at a city council meeting. If you’d like to sign in person, come to the IX farmers market Oct 26th or Nov 2nd.  We'll be collecting signatures at Frolic Coffee, and  Kevin Cox will be by the market manager booth.

TLDR

We are asking the city to add a crosswalk to the Elliot Ave and 2nd st. entrance to IX. The city traffic engineer said no, but it is clear he doesn’t care that this legal crossing is highly trafficked and increasingly dangerous. Let’s pressure the city council to do something. Sign our petition!

I'm a current Mechanical Engineering student, and have found myself having a hard time having effective study methods and preparing for exams/doing homework. Although I don't think it's 100% effective, it's admirable and funny nonetheless, and wish I had the drive that Miss Chung does.   
  
If you aren't aware, Kay Chung is a student at UCLA studying dentistry, and her videos of her ""studying"" for exams have gone viral on social media.

I asked how much that was because I could tell that she was subtly implying I should pay for it. I sent her $100 to cover the lashes and then asked if her nails were already looking cute. She said no and I sent her another $100 for mani/pedi. Ugh. She is just the most gorgeous woman. 100% my type and I’m so desperate to be hers.

1gbcze8,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1gbcze8/new_owner_potentially_stupid_question/,New owner - Potentially stupid question ,"Hi all, recently purchased a Dinamica Plus. Went for the older model and no bluetooth, so customizing drinks isn’t done by the app but on pressing stop on the machine 

My potentially stupid question;

I’m trying to customize a flat white. My understanding is this is a 2:1 ratio, with a double shot of espresso 

My espresso shot (that I have dialed in and enjoy) is 30ml

When customizing, if I allow the coffee to pour up to 60ml, am I right in thinking this isn’t technically a double shot, just a longer extraction?

And if I truly wanted a double shot, I should just customize the flat white to be 30ml and 120ml milk, but pour an espresso shot prior to this? So I would have 60ml of coffee in total

She did stuff like standing back and letting us plebs get our coffees first, and also opening doors for us and letting us go through. Even though I am a ""hold doors open for women, and ladies first."" kind of guy I thought it was a nice thing that she did as she is the one who holds the balance of power in that situation.

One dude, though - well he wasn't having it. Basically he refused to go first and insisted on holding the door for *her*. Apparently that was him showing respect.

I am thinking about how that played out. Should chivalry be rigid - ""I am a man and therefore I always hold the door open for women"" or is it a contextual thing ""You are my boss and deferring to your desire to hold the door open for me is a sign of respect and acknowledgement of the power balance of that dynamic.""

Or am I just over thinking this?

Therefore you become the prime target for their negative feelings towards each other that they need to dissipate in order to fit in. I mean this in the sense of verbal abuse, put downs and passive aggression rather than the extremes of physical and sexual abuse which of course do happen, but are rarer in comparison.

So that suggests to me an ongoing/systemic fear of men amongst men themselves. Is this true? What are the root causes?

ETA: Another thing I just remembered that actually motivated this question is, today I saw a guy serving at a coffee shop and another guy came in. The guy serving had been acting normal, probably just bored obviously, and all of a sudden this big guy who was pretty loud (but not rude or mean, just very assertive sounding) came in. The guy had some issue with payment or something, and the guy serving went into full on fawn mode and was going ""don't worry man haha don't worry at all, we can give you this for free haha"".

**AN OLD FRIEND**

Me, Kristine, and our few friends used to hang out in the central park every weekend we got the chance to. A green island in the middle of the skyscraper forest that Manhattan is. An oasis where I find it easier to concentrate and think than in the streets of the 'City that never sleeps.' Aiden took me here on a few dates so...I guess what I'm trying to say is that the place is special for me.

The 'hangout spot', as Krissie called it, was actually a starting point for walking the park itself. And it couldn't be anywhere else than the [entrance to the famous zoo located inside.](https://pinterest.com/pin/371969250446218491/)

When I got there I saw my friend leaning against a brick pillar furthest to the left, brown eyes glued to the smartphone in her hands. She looked just as I remembered. Dark skin in the shade of bitter chocolate, and even darker eyes, with irises barely distinguishable from the pupils from a distance. Crow black hair cut short, most of it hidden under a light gray beanie, and...*am I tripping or did her uhh, her chest get bigger?*

So I got closer to see for myself, she wore the standard navy blue jeans and a black leather motorcycle jacket, with her feet adorned in white and lime green winter sports shoes. This was the moment she perked up from her phone and saw me.

""Ohh you're here! Haven't seen each other in...how long was it?"" She said as she bounced herself off the bricks to a standing position and closed the distance between us. As she neared I noticed that something was...off, mainly her chest. *Is it me or are they bigger than I remember?*

""Hmm...close to two years I think? The last time we talked face to face was about a few weeks after Aiden got deployed off-world."" Her warm smile vanished as soon as I said that.

""Ohh...sorry I forgot that you two are a thing still? It must have been hard.""

""Ehh, not as hard as a complete lack of contact would be! I get paper letters from time to time. Said he prefers it over digital because 'you'll my handwriting when you see it'. It also makes it easier to imagine him saying the words in his own voice. Mostly because he also attaches an audio file of him reading them, but still! The handwriting helps.""

""Uhh-huh...so, are we ready for a walk and talk, or wanna know 'bout something else while we're here? I know of the not-so-recent exploits of the Penguins of Madagascar, did a rewatch recently, and ahh...the memories..."" She trailed off as the thoughts of her childhood flooded her mind I assume, she then looked back at the iconic zoo entrance.

""Yeah...there is a thing. Related to you actually.""

""What is it?""

""Well, I noticed you look a bit...better than before."" I placed my hands in the air above my bosom and clutched the empty space. She understood. ""Is it like a diet? You *were* into exercising so I guess it would shape your butt nicely but...I didn't think it could make the upper *ymph* bigger!""

KT looked down at herself, then back at me, then back at herself, then back at me and she laughed like a horse.

""Ahh heh, well, it's a combination of muscle growth, a specific diet, and some special supplements, BUT, fear not! You'll find out soon. It's kinda a bonus related to the job offer I mentioned earlier.""

""Well, you piqued my interest. Come on! The penguins won't admire themselves!"" And on that note, we entered the gates of the zoo.

It was a cold winter morning, so the number of visitors wasn't the largest. For a time we simply strolled through the zoo together, talking about our daily lives, routines, and laughed at the occasional funny things that happened. Such as a pigeon shit bombing the hair of what seemed to be an off-duty imperial marine, specifically the way she swore vengeance upon all of the 'grey winged sea of souls worthy vermin' for this insult. 

Then as we got close to the sealion enclosure, Kristine put her hands on the [railing and turned to me with a serious face.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park_Zoo#/media/File:Central_Park_Zoo_area.jpg) 

""Jane, is everything alright with you? And I don't mean the 'incident' noo, I mean your general life.""

""Krissie! Bestie...look...it isn't all sunshine and roses but it's not that bad! You don't need to bother yourself with helping me like in high school. I'm a grown woman, and I can take care of myself!"" I subconsciously raised my voice without noticing. My friend just crossed her arms and squinted her eyes.

""Jane, I know you well enough to see when you're trying to downplay your problems. Spit it out, that's why I'm here after all, to hear you out. I mean...have you ever seen yourself in the mirror recently? The water's clear here, take a look.""

I looked down defeated, so I placed my hands on the railing and stared into the water of the sea lion enclosure. My long reddish hair was a total mess, completely forgot to comb it before leaving, my green hooded eyes had grey bags under them, and my face seemed skinnier than I thought it would be, there was even a scar on my forehead from that time it had a quick introduction with the floor tiles in the hotel. *Have...have I been eating properly? Sometimes I did have to skip breakfast and run on coffee but...*

""Look, Jane. Just tell me what your situation is. I can help."" She wrapped her arm around my shoulders and smiled. It was a kind, sympathetic smile, the same one she had when we met. I figured there was no point in resisting any longer.

""I...I do have a money problem, it's...bad. Remember that purchase of several residential areas in New Jersey a few months back? It was on the news.""

""Yeah?""

""Well, the new owners being a Shil company decided it would be a profitable idea to evict the people living there and demolish the buildings to replace them with something more 'civilized'. Housing on par with imperial standards, safer neighborhoods, better public transport, and all that. Well, for a few weeks of construction those who got evicted made through by living temporarily with friends and family, hoping they would get the chance to move into an apartment better than the one they left.""

""But that didn't happen, didn't it? People went crazy on the internet when most of the new apartments were reserved for off-world engineers, doctors, volunteers, and such. The only humans who got the chance to move in were those working in state institutions like the fire department, the Civic Protection Service, or government offices.""

""Yeah...and when people realized that, they began to desperately search for a new place to live in, to not strain their close ones much longer. With Manhattan being one of the most sought after due to proximity. As demand for a living space rose, the rent prices also did. As a result, I've been having trouble affording everything while keeping my two-person apartment. It's...special for me so I'd like to avoid leaving it if possible. Not until Aiden comes back at least.""

""Wait..."" Krissie let go of me and tilted her head. ""You mean the one you and him lived in since the end of high school days?"" I nodded. ""Damm, that's...that's not good."" *Saying lightly.*

We stared at the marine mammals playing in the water until one decided to rapidly resurface near us, splashing cold water in our direction. We backed out, laughing at the situation just like we always did. With no care if other people hear us.

Kristine stopped before I did, which doesn't happen often. After glancing where she pointed those focused eyes of hers I saw three Shil'vati women. Two adults, and a smaller, shorter, and seemingly younger than them. Probably a noble daughter excited with earth's fauna in the companion of bodyguards. The not-so-little girl pressed her legs against the reinforced glass and leaned in, causing one of the guards to pull her back and scold her.

When I looked back at my friend, she was still observing the alien trio with a careful look in her eyes. I snapped my fingers in front of them.

""Hey, hey! Why are you staring at the purplies over there? Never seen a Shil'vati in a zoo?""

Kristine woke up from her observative trance, shook her head left and right to then straighten her spine.

""Yeah, no. Didn't expect to see them, that's all. Anyway, let's bounce from here. Almost forgot to tell you about that solution to that money problem of yours."" I didn't say anything as we got away from the scene.

Kristine insisted we had to leave the zoo, almost like she didn't want to share an area with the Shil'vati. I opted to remain silent about this, she was never a fan of interacting with nonhumans to begin with, but...she never escaped from them like that. Soon we reached the east drive and started walking south of the zoo.

""So, the job.""

""It's about time.""

""Well, sorry for keeping you waiting. There's a company I've been working in since Aiden left. It's called GreenGrocer.Inc."" She pulled out her phone and showed me the logo. A simplistic cartoonish dude wearing a hat and holding a grocery bag, with the company's name stylized into his silhouette.

""Green Grocer? Haven't heard of it, but sounds like a food delivery service...kinda like DoorDash right?

""Yeah, kinda. With the rise of flying delivery drones, they found themselves a niche of personal deliveries for clients who prefer contact with real humans instead of robots. And the reason you haven't heard of them is probably because most of their advertisement is done by their satisfied customer's word of mouth. Some...strange company policies or values I dunno.""

""So...would I have to work full time driving around New York during rush hours? Is the pay decent? Do you think it'd conflict with my main job? Being an IT girl in a data center *does* require me to be there, new security regulations don't allow me to work from home, so I don't think I'd be able to just go out and drive into the streets on a whim during a workweek.""

""Ahh don't worry about that! First, you'd start working on weekends only since that's when most of the deliveries are scheduled. When people are home to pay with cash. So conflicting with your dream job it shouldn't. The pay isn't the biggest, but at the level of your work it should be that support beam your income needs."" She counted the positives on her hand, raising finger after finger like a proper salesperson. \*Well, she is one so that's expected.""

""There's also a progression system, after your first week I'll take you to help with bigger deliveries, for which of course you'll get paid adequately more."" *Hmmm, continue.*

""And to top it all off, also get a discount on those exclusive dietary supplements that helped me get into this shape."" She straightened her back and spun on her heels, presenting the true size of her...*assets*, from different angles.

*Hehehehe, if I get my hands on this then Aiden will be so surprised when he returns! Ahh, I can already imagine the face he'd make...*

""Come to think of it, I believe I heard about something similar being sold in Europe. But it has been proven to have some term health detriments, or so I've heard.""

""Heh...buncha liars! Them aliens got afraid of the honest competition.  The supplement was tried and tested many times before being pushed out into the market, and when the results started garnering attention they sowed disinformation to prevent us from evening the playing field."" Anyway, here's a link to the company's internet page. Check it out for details about the work and...heh, the benefits.""

Kristine then proceeded to explain what her standard workday looked like. ""Wake up, breakfast, head to the redistribution point, take my list and stuff from it, or reach the places to pick it up, then drive around delivering it to proper addresses, drive back the company van to HQ, and that's it. Simple, anyway, here's a link to the company's internet page. Check it out for details about the work. About the heh, *benefits* I'll arrange you a meeting with a wizardress responsible for *mine*.""

A series of taps on her phone and a text containing the link popped up on mine.

""Hmm, if it's even half as good as you say it is I'd say yes. I'll look them up and call you to say if we're coworkers or not. You can expect an answer tomorrow mo..."" I trailed off as we arrived at the last place I'd want to be.

""Hey, Jane! What happened?"" She looked where I did, and commented with an appropriate: ""Ohh."" Because we ventured to the Grand Army Plaza. Specifically from an angle where the [Plaza Hotel is perfectly visible.](https://wikimapia.org/6324464/es/Grand-Army-Plaza-Manhattan#/photo/7891972)

The main entrance was locked behind constriction barriers and yellow tape. Lots of people in workwear were walking inside in groups, and I could count up to twelve cops checking their IDs, all wearing white riot helmets and holding blocky laser guns. Aside from that, a few windows were boarded, probably because they were damaged by stray explosive ammunition, the fire, or literally anything else.

""Damm, HS-C9's? These are standard issue for human marines, cops don't get to hold them unless the purps get real mad."" KT spoke with a tone as casual as one she used to describe a drama back in the day.

""Krissie...these terrorist fuckers killed close to three hundred people in less than two hours. *I* could have ended up as one of them on several occasions! And even tho I lived, I still didn't get off scot-free, trampled by a panicked shil'vati running for her life. So the purps are certainly *NOT* the only ones mad here.""

As an answer, she looked at me with slightly raised eyebrows, trying to analyze my outburst. ""Sorry for that, you know...making it seem like you haven't lived through hell back there. Look...just check out the link sent you and consider my offer. I wasn't there to help you in that hotel, so let me help you now. I'll be bouncing back to my job, still have a few deliveries to make. Hang on out there.""

With that, my bestie gave me a sincere hug and waved goodbye. She walked away and disappeared into the crowded streets of New York, leaving me alone with the building from my nightmares, and a feeling.

Since the beginning of the meeting, I couldn't help but notice something...sadness? Pity? Melancholy? Radiating from her face between the forced smiles. She's not happy about something, I'll have to ask about that the next time we talk.

As for now, I need to come back home, rest, prepare the Monday tomorrow, and check out that GreenGroce company page. *Ehh Jane, take things one at a time...*

**THE OFFICE**

Part-time job aside, I still needed to attend my main one. I worked as a maintenance specialist in a data center responsible for processing and gathering data, mainly for the Civic Protection and to a lesser extent, certain Shil'vati organizations. That's why I can only work from the site, using secured equipment provided to me, in an environment where your boss knows about EVERY click on the screen you make. And speaking of bosses...

""Miss Leister! You think I'm planning to go easy on you just because your last work week was spent in a hospital? WELL YOU THOUGHT WRONG! You have a lot of catching up to do if you want to earn something this month, but before I let you go...could you kindly fetch me some of that coffee? The one I like, you know which.""

""Caffe Latte with six sugar packets, just like always Mrs. Sarl'iana.""

She gave me a smirk. ""Good, good that despite the fractured skull you still understand. Very well, carry on.""

That was our conversation at the entrance to my cubicle, she waited there with arms crossed, right leg outstretched forward, her foot tapping impatiently as if I did everything to stay away from her for as long as possible. Which I probably would if I didn't struggle to keep my apartment mine.

My workspace wasn't very large, but it didn't feel empty due to the almost complete lack of paper along with all the accessories used to work on it. Pens, pencils, rubber, paperclips, you'd be surprised how much space those things take! So when the Shil'vati digitalized everything they reasonably could, office spaces became more spacious even if they didn't get larger.

As I started my computer, also outfitted with imperial-made parts I began searching through the files to figure out what I was doing, what I was supposed to finish, the current deadlines, all that 'coming back to work' stuff.

A message from a C.P.S. officer stated that they needed to know why the recording got glitched around the suspect's faces. The machine was hovering in the air, silently suspended by the antigrav unit it's outfitted with, pursuing three armed men in plain clothes running into an alleyway.

One was large, around meter eighty in height, equipped with a shotgun, round belly, thick limbs, and a head covered by a dark fabric, probably a balaclava. *Damm, already a 'perfect' start.*

The second one was shorter but not by a lot, he carried something that looked like a battle rifle. (I know because some of Aiden's firearm knowledge rubbed off on me.) He wore a grey scally cap and a slimmer version of the armor I've seen insurgents use in the plaza hotel. It seemed to be possible to conceal under a hoodie or a suit, yet even on its own, it looked convincingly like a thick light reflective vest.

The last one was the shortest, his head was hidden under a scarf, his gaze locked on the surveillance drone as he leveled his AK-47 with it, a second later the recording cut off.

And sure enough, the areas blurred around the heads of all three, making it impossible to see any details useful for identifying the men.

""Ughh, this is going to be tedious. Just like always. Hmm, better get back to work before the boss figures out I took a thirty-second break...""

""And you haven't considered saying 'hi' first? Jane, you could've been more thoughtful than that.""

That was the voice of my old frienemy. I turned back on my spinny chair (I like them) to see her in full display. Blonde hair, sky blue eyes, slender silhouette, and yet still equipped with *curves* bigger than mine.

""Anika...don't you have supervising to do in your department? You don't visit us net combers unless A you need something from us, or B you feel like talking to me.""

""And how's that bad? I've come to compliment those tight jeans and hand-knitted sweaters of yours, they look as good on you as always. Now go ahead! Tell about your stay in the hospital and your heroic escape from a terrorist-ridden hotel! The gals from the call center are eager to hear it!"" She threw her arms wide and looked around. I suppose that some people began to stare at her disposition, she's always been an attention seeker, even back in high school.

""Look, I do have some topics I'd like to talk about...""

""Yes?""

""...but right now I have some catching up to do.  So please, leave me to my devices now. We could schedule a meeting sometime soon, and then I could tell you everything.""

""And I'd be more than willing to listen! Ehh, all right, but be warned, I'm not going to forget about your promise."" She walked just up to me and stared into my soul. ""I won't let it end like that time I asked you to go shopping with me. You're not getting away this time."" And with that she straightened her posture and joyfully marched out, hand already pushing a phone against her ear, probably one of her friends asking about my reply.

*Enough pondering, time to work!* And so, I did.

Aside from my duties, Erishna sent me some camera footage she wanted in higher quality. ""I couldn't find any program I could use to do it myself so could you help me out?"" And I might have a theory as to why. The Shil'vati may be so technologically advanced, that the days of using toasters for street cameras are centuries behind them.

*This would be quite funny if true...*

Then a panicked coworker of mine stormed into my cubicle begging me to help him *now*, he practically dragged me to the source of his problem, which happened to be a frozen screen, there was a small window with a green bar at 88 percent completion. I shook the mouse and expectantly, the cursor didn't move.

""See? It just happened when I started unzipping an...eh...important file I need for...*work*. Yeah...ugh...can you fix it fast?""

I groaned. ""Trevor, I haven't been here for more than two hours and you managed to break something before dinner break?""

""That's Trevy for ya!"" Scott shouted in response to the amusement of his closest friends.

""Hey! I'm not a complete failure! I just..."" Trevor tried to defend himself but he was cut off by a growing crowd of people.

""Jane! My computer froze too!"" Said one. ""Mine too!"" Said another.

I stood up to check how bad things looked, and it was about as bad as with Trevor's PC. My coworkers were understandably angry at the sudden malice of inanimate things, and afraid of potentially losing hours of work. They were shouting equally at each other as they did at me, meanwhile, I had my right index finger on my nose and a head busy trying to figure out what caused this mess.

And then it hit me.

""Trevor? You were the first to get your PC frozen, correct?""

""Ugh...yeah?"" He answered sheepishly.

""Didn't you by any chance happen to open up a suspicious file?""

""N-no! What are you talking about?"" He was avoiding eye contact and scratching the back of his head. Other people began to surround him.

""Trevor, I need you to be honest with me. With *us*. The thing you opened was probably a zip bomb, one that *you* allowed to open despite the system's warning. What caused you to do that Trevor?"" I had my arms crossed, eyes focused, and tone ice cold. The visual pressure from others finally pushed the idiot to spill the beans out.

""Ehh, okay it was...ehm...a folder with uhh, *pictures* from a uhh...dating site. To hook up. With...eh...ladies of otherwordly...physique...""

For a moment there was silence. Then came the cacophony of laughter. Eighteen people, laughing their ass off in an enclosed space. I had to grasp my ears, and Trevor looked as if he was ready to sink into the floor. Luckily the alarm caused the mass of office-dressed drones to regain their composure.

""***ATTENTION! Cybersecurity systems breached! All employees are asked to shut down their work equipment or any other smart devices to avoid further damage!***"" Shouted the Security lady on the building's intercom. The fire alarm turned on three seconds after she finished.

The panic set in, some people were running back to their cubicles to yank out the power cables, while others preferred to save their phones first. I was going for the room's power box. With a quick switch off, all power in the room was gone, including the one going to the lights because everything would turn black if not for the windows.

""Alright, IT'S HAPPENING! Everybody stay calm!

""Scott..."" I tried to calm the man.

""STAY FUCKING CALM!""

""SCOT! Stop panicking you...""

""What. The. FUCK! Happened here!? In the name of the Empress and all that's holy, can *SOMEONE* explain what transpired?"" There, at the entrance to the chamber stood Lady Sar'liana. The light from the corridor cast her large shadow in front of her, she looked as furious as my mom when she caught me playing with my computer late at night, which basically means *angry as fuck*.

""Trevor opened a virus-spiced zip bomb from a hook-up site."" I stood there, pointing my thumb to the right where the man in question stood, quivering with fear. It would probably feel like exposing what your sibling screwed up in front f your parents...if I actually knew what having one is like! *Heh heh, the spoils of being an only child!*

""TREVOR!""

""Ugh, yes ma'am?""

""My office, NOW! Rest of you, clean up this mess. Jane? Notify me when you're done.""

""Yes ma'am.""

Trevor Gulped as he followed the heavily stomping woman, probably thinking of words he'd put in his last will. Anyway, that's his problem now. *I have other things to worry about now.*

Making sure that every computer in the chamber was off took a good minute, then I instructed everyone to turn them on again in emergency mode. Then came the removal of any viruses and asking people working elsewhere if they had any problems...aaand that took me much more than I thought it would.

I had my tablet with the report of today's attack's results opened and ready to show. After taking a deep breath I knocked on the large metal door.

""Mrs. Sarl'iana, It's me Jane with the...""

""Come in."" The rectangular chunk of metal slid left, answering the command, I took three steps forward and they closed behind me with that same smooth yet heavy sound.

""*Ehk-hem.* You did come here for something more important than admiring the imperial door construction.""

*Ahh, right.* I turned my gaze towards the titaness of a woman. She was sitting in a large red luxurious leather office armchair, wearing a 'boss bitch' suit of a purple shade darker than her lilac skin. A large smart screen was built into the mahogany desk tall enough to support my arm bent at 90 degrees at the forearm, *while standing.* Yellow eyes focused entirely on the flying holographically displayed documents of great importance.

""Uhh...so, where do I even start-""

""From the beginning, I hope. Make this quick I am very busy as you can see.""

So I explained everything I gathered from the five other maintenance specialists. A number way too small for a building where employees are number in over hundred fifty, especially when 'incidents' happen at least twice a month. But of course, the lady didn't care.

""You made it before the closing hour, so what are you even complaining about?"" To then mutter: ""*Damm humans whining about everything.*""

What she did care about was our ability to continue the work. ""Some important files have been lost, today's progress thrown into the bin,  spirits shattered, but overall, nothing catastrophic. Our LAN (Local Area Network) wasn't completely compromised and I expect a return to full functionality by tomorrow.""

""Hmm...keep going like that and I might consider that raise you asked me for.""

""REALLY?"" I wanted this to be true, I wanted to have my money problem fixed like that, but of course, things are never that simple with my boss. Sarl'iana looked straight at me, sitting in my comically smaller chair, and laughed for a good minute.

""Wha-what?! Ahh, no, no, of course not! Doing your job right won't get you a pay rise, that's what you're *expected* to do. You'll have to give it your all if you want to get anywhere.""

*As if I wasn't doing that, SINCE THE FUCKING START!*

""Of course Lady Sarl'iana, do you want anything else from me?""

""No, nothing I can think of. Not in the mood for coffee now, so I think you can go.""

So I stood up, turned off my work tablet, and readied myself to leave when the door opened.

""Ohh, one more thing. The rest of my team wanted to know if that idiot Trevor will be still working with us. Most assume him to be fired already, is that the case?"" I said looking back as I stood right outside her office.

Sarl'iana looked up and thought for a bit, then grinned at me. ""Ahh, well, let's just say it's up to him now. Don't worry, even if he *accepts* my offer you won't have to deal with his not-safe-for-work antics since I'll be dealing with that. Bye bye!"" And the metal slid back into the frame.

*Ahh, an offer. I wonder what it could possibly be?*

And on that note with very disturbing implications I have little wish pondering, I returned home, made myself some chocky milk as a treat, and procrastinated for two hours to prepare myself for my tomorrow's first day at Green Grocer.

**GREEN SHIFT**

Kristine was waiting in the parking lot of my apartment building when I got back from work. She was wearing green work trousers with equally green suspenders. The shirt was white and the middle had a sewn-in logo of the company, which would probably look nice if her chest didn't distort it almost beyond comprehension. *I seriously want to know how she got that bonus.* The green cap is also nice, would look great with my eyes.

The vehicle parked behind her was a van that looked overwhelmingly mundane in comparison. If it were white it could pass for a 'free candy' one with no problems.

""Heya Janie!""

""Hi, Kriss!"" She hugged me as she always does during greetings.

""Your uniform is in the back, you can put it on there as I'll drive us where we'll get our items from today's lists. There's a light in there so lack of windows shouldn't be a problem, so hop in!"" I did as instructed and entered the van, my driver closed the sliding door behind me just as I found the light switch. After changing I took a look around the cargo which as of now wasn't that plentiful.

Three cardboard boxes sat under one of the two long shelves placed at a height where you'd expect a bench to be, if that's the case then it's a smart design choice, allowing for more employees to sit inside for...I dunno, maybe quicker loading of more boxes? You could fit about four people on one of those, or...just one in a laying position, which would be me. As expected...it wasn't that comfortable, especially with occasional bumps here and there.

My much more modern car has a high-tech suspension that takes care of this problem, so I guess that's why the turbulence caught me off guard, causing me to fall face-front on the floor. What's worse is that as I was about to put my arms to push myself up, the sliding door opened revealing my quite embarrassing position to Kristine, who made a shit-eating grin as a result.

""You tried to lay on the thing and fell off?""

I pouted my cheeks and continued to get up, and she just giggled for a second before helping me out of the van.

""We are here!""

Walmart. We were standing in the large parking lot of a Walmart. I...I guess it's appropriate since it's still the largest store chain in North America. I just...

""Expected something smaller?"" Krissie said, practically reading my thoughts. ""You were staring for a moment, so I figured as much."" *Still convinced she's a telepath.* ""Come on, we have stuff to get."" She pulled my hand and we crossed the concrete field, reaching the entrance.

It didn't look any different from what you'd see in a normal Walmart, I mean...anyone living in the post-USA area has probably seen this sight at least a dozen times, it's not exceptional. What is however is that when one of the cashiers saw us as we entered with our green shopping cart she greeted Kristine. ""Benny's waiting with your stuff in the back. Also is that a newbie?""

""Yeah, her first day. Thanks for everything again Martha!"" My friend waved her goodbye as we entered the labyrinth of stocked shelves and alleys.

""You're on the first name basis here?""

""Yeah, kinda a regular over here. You'll be one too in no time! Believe me, remembering the names of people who make your job easier comes on its own.""

Uhh...I'm not so sure about that. I worked in the data center for close to three years and there are still people I can't name. Recognize by face? Sure! But not by name, I was bad at remembering them since elementary. Mom scolded me for not putting in the effort to remember them. *Now I know what she tried to prevent.*

In the doorframe of a 'staff only' labeled door stood a man, probably that Benny the cashier spoke of. His hair was the color of greyish black, his belly as round as my dad's, and his smile as friendly as it was wrinkled. His brown eyes were focused mostly on Kristine as we approached.

""Ahh, the greengrocer girl! I see you brought a friend.""

""Yeah, she'll be helping me from now on. Here's the today's list. Want me to help you with...""

The man simply raised his open hand. ""Nahh, there's no need for that. I've got everything already picked and packed. Besides, just because I'm not the youngest doesn't mean I can't carry a few thingamagobs a short distance."" He took a breath and made quotation marks. ""Also, if the manager saw me let an 'outsider' inside the storage I wouldn't hear the end of it. Wait here for a moment."" And with that, Benny spun in place and vanished into the dimly lit restricted area.

""You remember how you said that remembering people helpful to you comes naturally?""

""Yeah?""

""Well, this guy would be memorable even as a stranger on the street.""

""Ahh, well, that's Benny for ya. If things go well you'll meet a whole crew of memorable personalities."" I was about to ask for an elaboration but Benny came quicker, his thick arms holding four bags and two shoebox-sized cardboard containers locked under his shoulders by the sizeable biceps. I wanted to help but he deposited the cargo into our cart with such ease that any assistance would be redundant.

After quick goodbyes, we were back in the van, with Kristine behind the wheel. The whole ordeal didn't take more than ten minutes.

""And...that's it? I thought we'd have to pay or...""

""The boss handled it as the order was made. We don't need to worry about all that, only the delivery and collection of money from the customer."" She rubbed her left thumb against the middle and index finger to emphasize the point.

""Well damm, if that's the case then this job may not be as bad as I thought it could be! I only need to see the first paycheck to decide...""

""Ahh don't worry about that! You'll get your paid in cash *today*, we get a cut of what the customer pays with. As long as we take as much as we are allowed, and the right amount of money flows into the company there aren't any other unnecessary procedures like 'paychecks'. That's why he hires people who can be trusted, and that's probably the reason for the lack of advertisement. Ehh...turn on the radio, I'm tired of all the money talk.""

Of all the things the radio could play...of all the genres available in the New York area...we got 'George Ezra - Shotgun'. I wanted to change but...""Nu-uhh! My car, my rules! Shotgun *stays*."" And that was the end of the discussion.

So instead I took the time to ponder. I thought this job was sketchy at first, I mean...the way how convenient it is. An old friend I hadn't seen with face to face for a year just materialized with the exact solution to my financial problems. But so far it's just...weird instead. It's almost like that company exists to deliver groceries first, generating profits second. Strange thing to see in America.

Anyway, I think now would be a good time to say a few things about the customers themselves. I expected most of them to be elderly but surprisingly they composed only a third of the people we visited.

One of them was an old lady who asked about Benny, his mom. That explains why he was so friendly to us back there. Even if he were to be an asshole, it wouldn't be too hard for him to be nice to people who supply his mother with groceries.

Another door was opened by a teenage girl, she had the exact amount of cash needed right in her hands. Her bag contained flower seeds, a can of bug spray, and a lot of packaged fertilizer. So much so that she dropped the bag on the floor when Krissie put it in her hands.

But the last visit was probably the strangest one, at least for me. There at the door stood a tall guy, at least meter eighty, (or about 5'11 in imperial units I will avoid) his belly was smaller than Benny's, yet still sizeable. The shoulders were wide and nicely formed as if they were exercised a lot, his smile had a trapezoid mustache hat, while the chin and jaw were covered by a short beard that went up to his dark brown and equally short-cut hair on the head.

And for some reason, I felt like I saw him before. Deja vu would be a good way to describe it.

""Heya KT! Ohh and...hey uhmm...""

""My name is Janette.""

""Jane! Oh, what a nice name. Mine's Oliver. Are you new? KT *rarely*  brings an unfamiliar face with her."" From his accent, I'd guess he is American of Italian origin. Well...he certainly looks the part. I could easily imagine him in a suit, a fedora, and a Tommy gun in the role of a James Bond antagonist.

""Yeah Ollie, she is new. Also not single if you're curious."" Oliver's smile died down but remained. The way Krissie said that is as if she did so numerous times.

""How are the others doing?"" Kristine asked, hanging the topic.

""You mean the rice eater and the handyman? Yeah, they doin' just fine. Mike was eagerly waiting for his..."" He looked over at me, then at Kristine, carefully choosing his words. ""...package. Heh, anyway, thank you as always."" He gazed at me. ""If you'll ever need a favor then feel free to ask. I'm responsible for some of the company's bonuses myself. Here's the money.""

After he paid the correct amount coming up to around five hundred credits, he took one of the boxes from me and brought it inside. It was heavy so I didn't complain. Soon after we were done, Kristine was riding me back to my place. This time the radio played 'House of Memories', which is appropriate since I remember this conversation even to this day.

""Krissie? Who were these people?""

""Uhh? What do ya mean? Our loyal customers of course!""

""No, I meant that Oliver guy. What kind of help he was offering? How did you two meet? You were on the first name basis with him over there.""

""I...I know the names of every customer I'm assigned to! Stop making it sound weird. Oliver is...let's say a friend. One that would wish for us to be more than that but I wasn't into the idea, he still teases me like that every time he can.""

""OoooUUUooohh!"" OoooUUUooohh indeed! I never really got to hear much about Krissie's love life! Ohh that's so exciting! To think that someone like her would...

""I know what's that your thinkin', stop. I won't be telling you more about that ever. Ehh...look, your apartment is getting close so get ready.""

So I did. Changed back into my clothes in the back, received my earnings in cash (*gotta count it properly later*), and began saying my goodbyes for the day. I was walking towards the door but Kristine wanted to say something else. She was sitting behind the wheel, window opened, arm resting on the car door.

""About that help offer of Ollie's...he meant it as you know...'hang on there' kinda thing. It's a dangerous world we live in so...I guess what I'm trying to tell you is...to stay safe. If anything happens I'll be there to help, so don't be afraid to ask."" She put her hand inside a pocket and pulled out a simple electric watch. ""You may have to start driving around on your own. If anything happens give it a proper squeeze and I'll know you're in trouble.""

Hmm. That's...unlike her. She isn't usually that caring of others, or rather she doesn't show it as plainly as here. *I mean, seriously? How is she giving me such an honest go-go-gadget out of the blue?*

""Ohhkay...you too! You can count on me too!""

She made her signature grin as she often does. ""Yeah, glad to hear that.""

And with that she drove off the parking lot, to then deliver the van to the company building or something. Leaving me with cash to count, a fancy watch, and a lot to think about.

He towered over the pulpit, arms wide as if expecting a soft embrace

Stifled beams of morning light filtered by stained glass and soot

Against his white vestments seem a technicolor coat

Shimmering, shifting, proclaiming a divine presence

Quiet punctuates his words, as what few in attendance listen intently

As if their lives and thereafter cling to each syllable 

Confidently punched into the stale air

Breaking, hammering like nails on a wooden cross

On which to hang high hopes and weary dreams

There was never much to dream for in this town

Only a desperate desire, a need to escape like animals caged

This was once a large congregation, full of sunny laughs and silent judgements

Most had left by now, either through riding age to its natural end

Or on the warped railroad tracks that carried freight by town

Or by following the winding, tangled back roads that surrounded the middle of nowhere

Nobody had stayed by choice, but some found comfort

Change is terrifying

Turmoil lurks outside at the loose ends of the railroad tracks and winding roads

Those uncertainties were always reason enough to stay

And stay they had, here, for this

For the people they had been forced to love as a tree grows around a fence

There was no leaving now

Their roots were too deep, reaching ever deeper for meaning in this life

Like the cottonwoods at the edges of their property

Blocking them from a grating foreign wind

Forcing through stiff soils hoping to find water 

Which was always just a bit too deep to reach

And so this town slowly revolves around a small white building

Paint chipped, weather worn, creaking under the weight of time

On the side of one of the twisting roads which led to nowhere

That hosts weekly gatherings of dust stained shirts 

Smelling of the caged animals they share a home with

Where he stands and insists the divine recognizes their lives

Their joy, their suffering, their prayers

Though the rest of the world is blind to them and their barren fields

And in a brief moment, he could be believed

The town huddles ever closer together

To protect the divine shard they've been given

Before shuffling off to the churchyard for coffee and homemade breakfast 

Color draining from his white vestments in perfect sun

This is where they belong, roughly clumped around an old white building 

Like the dried dirt they've been left to farm



The tiny cemetery, calmly waiting for it's next resident, lies in the churchyard

The congregation needs every member it can get, a captive audience

Always listening intently to the quiet in between the words of the preacher

Broken, hammered like nails on a wooden cross

I served as a TACP in the USAF  from 91-95 & was injured from a jump in Panama in 92 which required shoulder surgery. I had to have  it operated again in 01 because of more frequent dislocations . I was 22 when I got out and was basically told that I would be getting a hundred and some dollars​​ a month for my shoulder. I rarely went to the VA for any medical issues because I had private health insurance but when I did go I always complained about my left shoulder and the constant pain. Finally after talking to a fellow Vet over coffee one morning, he convinced me to reach out to a VSO. The VSO filed a claim within a week and I had a P&T exam the following week. I went from step 1 to Step 5 in a matter of days. The notes from my exam i believe are favorable I believe. The Dr. was very thorough and spent time talking to me about my left arm/shoulder which is pretty much useless. He stated that my range of motion is 30 % out of 180% ( flexion), 20% out of 180%  ( abduction) and 5% in both internal and external rotation that the max would be 90%. There were also 7 other tests he was unable to perform due to shoulder instability, dislocation and labral pathology.  He also stated "" That the veteran would be just as equally served with amputation and prothesis"" and also stated that the Veteran has complete loss of left shoulder and arm. He diagnosed me with a bicipital tear, a rotator cuff tear and  glenohumoral instability, severe atrophy of my shoulder and girdle muscles that day. ( my one arm is 3"" bigger than my bum arm/shoulder ) One more thing he noted was under the question "" regardless of the veterans current employment status, do the conditions of the diagnosis section impact the veterans ability to perform any type of occupational task and he checked yes noting that the Veteran has no functional use of his left shoulder and arm. I have MS which affects my lower body and no MS symptoms from the waste up so not sure if they would consider secondary conditions as far as my hip and back issues ( most likely MS related)I am basically reaching out to my fellow veterans for any input, advice or feelings how this might turn out.

So since I can get away with minimal manipulation on my hair between wash days, I was wondering if y'all have any recommendations on protective styles to avoid as much damage as possible.

I'm not interested in paying $300 for getting my hair done when I have nowhere to go. So my plan has just been two French braids, but I feel like my ends aren't protected that way. Originally I'd bobby pin them to the middle of the braids to keep them from fluttering in the wind but i imagine that's not very good for them either. So I was using a satin scrunchy but I wasn't sure if that was gonna cause breakage either. And then I was looking in the mirror and my hair is so broken off in the middle and in the front, so I'm like dang what should i do for that too? Plus I figure I should switch up the style to avoid tugging on the same spots every time. 

Do y'all have any suggestions? At this point I'm tempted to just wear my durag all day lol i used to wear my bonnet around the house all the time but I wasn't sure if that'd just be unnecessary friction (plus I ordinarily like taking it off when I get dressed so I don't feel like I'm about to go to sleep)",1,1729800856.0,relaxedhair,1,1.0,False

I've worked really hard at it, as I'm generally not very social to begin with. But I've kids and I wanted to be positive about it too. Anyway, I became friends with a sort of group, our common theme is unfortunately all our kids go to the same school. We are a mixed bag generally, but we mesh well. Or so I thought. I've organised parties, play dates and coffee dates just for the mothers, we've had deep conversations, they've shared really personal experiences and information with me and I likewise with them. We meet frequently, some of us walking a few times a week, dropping into each other for coffee etc.. 

All this to say, I thought these were friends of mine. I haven't really heard from them in a few weeks but just assumed we were all busy it happens every now and then. I met one of them today for coffee and she asked what was I wearing to the party on Saturday. I said what party and she said oh Christine's party? I felt like such a knob because clearly I wasn't invited and simply replied I hadn't been invited and moved the conversation along. But I've had such a yucky hard lump in my throat all day and then when my husband got home from work I just bawled crying because I thought I had friends but clearly I don't? My husband is heartbroken for me cause he's seen how hard I've worked at friendships, how kind and generous I am to them, how they reciprocated. Even he got involved in the friendships to a point, we've all hosted dinners in our houses for each other over the past few years. I had to drive past this persons house today to get somewhere with the kids and there's a huge marquee put up and so like it's obviously a big enough event... I just feel like shit. 

How do I move on from this? I don't want to be retaliatory, but I sort of feel like this door has closed for me. I don't want to start drama or anything, I'm a pretty quiet person and don't do well with confrontation. I'm thinking I just walk away, be polite but reserved, decline meet ups and walks and just move on?

*  Have you had any success combining chess with other activities such as: 'Chess and coffee'?
* Have you found any ways to involve families into club activities?
* What are some good ways to keep interest alive after initial excitement fades?

I was in Spain during August of 2024 and I got into a routine of having a beer with lunch then an espresso at the end. It was a pretty phenomenal way to live my life if you ask me. This is coming from someone with a very low regular caffeine intake (I don't drink coffee often, just 1 cup of breakfast tea). I even found that the espresso in Spain didn't have me buzzing or feeling overly caffeinated at all. 

Since coming back to Canada, I've tried a few working lunches having food then an espresso after and it was wickedly disappointing. I found the espresso in Canada to be bitter, harsh, acidic, and generally completely incomparable to the espresso I had in Spain.

What I'm asking is: **is it possible for me to have Spain-like espresso in Canada? If so, is it a TON of work, or is it attainable at home?**

Bonus points for: anyone know any good coffee shops in Calgary AB, Canada or at least some indicators that they might do an espresso that is closer to what I experienced when in Spain?
