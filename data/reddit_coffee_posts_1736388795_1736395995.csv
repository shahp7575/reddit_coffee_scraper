## Unlock Barista-Level Coffee at Home: Breville Barista Express Black Friday Deals

The aroma of freshly pulled espresso, the velvety texture of perfectly frothed milk – these are the hallmarks of a truly exceptional coffee experience.  And for years, the Breville Barista Express has been the go-to machine for home baristas seeking to achieve that cafe-quality cup without the cafe price tag.  Black Friday is fast approaching, presenting the perfect opportunity to upgrade your coffee game with significant savings on this highly-rated espresso machine.  This guide will explore the best Breville Barista Express Black Friday deals, helping you navigate the sales and find the perfect price for this versatile and powerful machine.


### Understanding the Breville Barista Express: More Than Just an Espresso Machine

The Breville Barista Express (BES870XL) isn't just an espresso machine; it's a complete home espresso system.  Its integrated conical burr grinder eliminates the need for a separate grinder, streamlining the espresso-making process and ensuring consistently fresh grinds for every shot. This all-in-one design, combined with its intuitive interface and advanced features, makes it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced baristas.  Let's delve into the key features that set it apart:

**Key Features Explained:**

* **Integrated Conical Burr Grinder:**  Forget pre-ground coffee! The built-in grinder offers 16 precision grind settings, allowing you to tailor the grind size to your specific coffee beans and desired espresso extraction. This level of control is crucial for achieving the perfect balance of flavor and crema.

* **Digital PID Temperature Control:**  Maintaining a consistent brewing temperature is paramount for consistent espresso quality. The Breville Barista Express boasts a digital PID temperature control system, ensuring the water reaches and maintains the optimal 200°F (93°C) for extraction.  This precision translates to richer, more flavorful espresso.  You can even fine-tune the temperature in 2-degree increments, up to 4°F, giving you complete control over your brewing parameters.

* **Pre-Infusion:** This clever feature gently saturates the coffee grounds before the full extraction begins. This pre-infusion process helps to ensure even extraction, preventing channeling and maximizing the flavor potential of your beans.

* **Low-Pressure Pre-infusion:**  The Barista Express uses a low-pressure pre-infusion, which gently blooms the coffee grounds before the full pressure extraction begins, ensuring a more balanced and flavorful cup.

* **Steam Wand:**  Crafting lattes and cappuccinos requires perfectly frothed milk. The Breville Barista Express's steam wand allows you to create microfoam with ease, transforming your espresso into a delightful masterpiece.  While mastering the steam wand takes practice, the machine's design makes it relatively easy to learn.

* **Volumetric Controls:**  The ability to program the shot volume ensures consistency.  Once you've found your ideal extraction time, you can program the machine to deliver the perfect dose every time.  This is especially helpful for those who prefer a consistent espresso volume.

* **19-22g Dose Control:** The machine is designed to handle a 19-22g dose of coffee grounds, which is ideal for a double shot of espresso.  This ensures sufficient coffee grounds for optimal extraction.


### Why Black Friday is the Perfect Time to Buy the Breville Barista Express

The Breville Barista Express is an investment, but Black Friday offers a significant opportunity to reduce that investment.  Here's why it's a smart purchase during this holiday shopping event:

* **Significant Price Reductions:**  High-end espresso machines like the Breville Barista Express rarely see deep discounts. Black Friday is one of the few times of the year when you can expect substantial price drops from both major retailers and the manufacturer itself.

* **Bundle Deals:**  Keep an eye out for bundle deals that include accessories like tamper, milk frothing pitcher, or even extra coffee beans. These bundles can offer excellent value, allowing you to save even more money.

* **Increased Availability:** While the Breville Barista Express is popular year-round, demand typically spikes during the holidays. Purchasing during Black Friday can help you secure your machine before it sells out.


### Where to Find the Best Breville Barista Express Black Friday Deals

Finding the best deal requires a bit of research, but the effort is well worth it.  Here are some places to start your search:

* **Major Online Retailers:** Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart are prime locations to find competitive pricing and potential Black Friday deals on the Breville Barista Express.  Check their websites regularly in the weeks leading up to Black Friday.

* **Breville's Official Website:** Check Breville's official website for any manufacturer-direct deals or promotions.  They sometimes offer exclusive bundles or discounts that aren't available through other retailers.

* **Specialty Coffee Retailers:**  Stores specializing in coffee equipment and supplies often participate in Black Friday sales.  Check local stores or online retailers that focus on coffee equipment.

* **Price Comparison Websites:**  Use price comparison websites like Google Shopping to easily compare prices across different retailers. This helps you ensure you're getting the best possible deal.


### Beyond the Price: Things to Consider Before You Buy

While the price is a major factor, consider these additional points when making your decision:

* **Read Reviews:**  Before purchasing, read reviews from other customers.  This will give you valuable insights into the machine's performance, ease of use, and potential issues.

* **Warranty and Customer Support:**  Check the warranty offered by the retailer and Breville.  A good warranty and reliable customer support can provide peace of mind.

* **Maintenance:**  All espresso machines require regular cleaning and maintenance.  Familiarize yourself with the cleaning process and ensure you're comfortable maintaining the machine.


###  Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q: Is the Breville Barista Express easy to use?**

A: While mastering espresso-making takes practice, the Breville Barista Express is designed for user-friendliness. Its intuitive interface and integrated grinder simplify the process, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced baristas.

**Q: How much does the Breville Barista Express typically cost?**

A: The standard retail price varies, but you can generally expect to pay between $700 and $900. Black Friday deals can significantly reduce this price.

**Q:  How do I clean the Breville Barista Express?**

A:  Breville provides detailed cleaning instructions in the user manual.  Regular cleaning, including backflushing, is essential for maintaining optimal performance and preventing clogs.

1hx3zyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1hx3zyj/a_new_flavor_of_anxiety/,A new flavor of anxiety,"I am coming here (hopefully) for reassurance. Years ago I was struggling with anxiety that would come about randomly with classic symptoms like racing heart, racing thoughts, feelings of needing to flee. I got a kolonopin script and used it sparingly and at some point without me noticing these feelings went away and never came back. Just as recently as mid October I told my therapist that I don’t really struggle with anxiety at all and it wasn’t even a thing that I thought about anymore. That’s how resolved I felt. Even in scary situations while pregnant, getting really sick, etc. I was fine. 

At the beginning of November I had a big change in my work situation and started my own business. That business is my families only income. Pretty stressful but I don’t think about it too much. However, I have since been experiencing pretty intense bouts of anxiety on and off. I thought it was all caffeine related, and quitting coffee helped for a bit, but I am having trouble coping and getting it under control. My symptoms are now heart palpitations, health related racing thoughts, and the most off putting feelings of internal jitteriness and and “off” feeling I can’t put my finger on. I’m not off balance, the room isn’t spinning, it’s just almost like I’m perceiving myself as dizzy. But I’m not. Ive looked into pppd and my symptoms seems very mild compared to what I’ve read about it. I’m pretty sure it’s all anxiety related because I have days where I don’t think about any of this and I feel totally fine. But I start to become hyper vigilant of any and all bodily sensations, which seem to create more sensations, and the cycle is hard to break. Asking myself “am I dizzy?” “Is my vision weird?” “Am I shaking?” Etc. 

I also had a migraine as soon as I woke up about 4 days ago, and since then my anxiety has been worse than ever. I can’t stop thinking this will never go away and that something is seriously wrong with me. 

I have a theory that the anxiety has returned because I have something major to live for now (15 month old daughter) and I am terrified of not being here for her. I’m also the main provider now so anything she needs is on me and my work performance. I don’t think about these facts on a daily basis but I’m wondering if the subconscious knowledge of all of this is messing with me. 

After going on and on I’m not sure if I am just venting or looking for advice or what. I’m mostly hoping for reassurance that others have experienced this “off” feeling I’m talking about and that it is just anxiety and I am feeding the loop (I am constantly googling) out of desperation to make it stop or find an answer. Knowing that these symptoms are normal for anxiety would be comforting for me because I can tell myself it’s just anxiety and not my body about to give out at any moment. 

Yes I am aware I should see my doctor. This also gives me anxiety. Taking my kolonopin seems to help. But not as much as it used to. And since it’s a benzo it doesn’t help with the “off” feeling, because it comes with a wooziness of its own. 

If you got this far, thanks for listening to me (anxiously) yap. Sometimes talking about it (instead of googling) helps me feel better! Interestingly I feel more normal after I cry as well lol. Anxiety is fucking weird. ",1,1736394548.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

So first of all, for others who will follow our path, don't be weirded out that from the outside it looks like a typical cutesy cafe (lattes on the menu, small tables and couches with free wifi). Step inside and look closer at the small menu above the cookies, you'll see that it's different! and that it has ""beef pho"" and ""chicken pho""! And if you order from that frikin secret menu, the owner will come out and setup the biggest table in the cafe for you to eat some damn good pho!

It took us a second visit to confirm the pho is good because looks like there is a rotating menu; as on our first visit, there was only the herbal chicken soup and the snail noodle soup. They were still very very good but not what we were there for (though did hyped us even more). Today, we called ahead, confirmed it's pho, booked ourselves a table, got it, and after eating and barely talking to each other, I can say I never thought I would get so emotional over some noodles.

My friends, I'm spreading the word because I need this place to survive and for the owner to keep making new dishes. I didn't see anyone else coming in to eat pho (or get coffee for that matter) and the owner did tell us she's getting more tables for pho eaters but it did feel a little weird being the only customers to such good food. Believe me when I say this is good, I grew up in northern Vietnam and the only pho I would recommend people meant they have to book a flight to California. And yes, we've been to almost all the places on recommended by our resident [/u/2u3ee](https://www.reddit.com/user/2u3ee/)'s [comprehensive guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1hiwu7v/my_top_list_for_vietnamese_food_in_nyc_from_a/) and they all are blown out of the water in terms of taste. The price is alright, all three noodle dishes we tried were $18 on the menu before tax and tip, but if taking into account the transportation to get there it's comparable to Di An Di.

Anyway, if I could turn all my fingers into thumbs to make thumbs up I would, because this place deserves them.

Teeth whitening is an increasingly popular cosmetic dental procedure that can transform your smile and boost your confidence. However, many patients are unsure about the crucial post-treatment dietary guidelines that can impact the effectiveness and longevity of their teeth whitening results. Understanding what and when you can eat after teeth whitening is essential to maintaining those pearly whites and preventing potential sensitivity or staining. This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about eating after teeth whitening, ensuring you protect your investment and maximize your bright, beautiful smile.

What Happens During Teeth Whitening?

Teeth whitening treatments temporarily make your tooth enamel more porous and sensitive. The whitening process opens up the pores of your teeth, making them more vulnerable to staining and potential discomfort. This is why dental professionals recommend a careful approach to eating and drinking immediately following the procedure.

How Long Should You Wait to Eat After Teeth Whitening?

The critical waiting period for eating after teeth whitening is typically **24 to 48 hours**. During this time, your teeth are most susceptible to staining and sensitivity. Here are the key guidelines:

1. Immediate Post-Treatment Period (0-2 Hours)
- Avoid eating or drinking anything
- Stick to room temperature water if needed
- Allow the whitening treatment to set completely

2. First 24 Hours: The White Diet
Stick to a **""white diet""** that includes:
- Plain yogurt
- White rice
- Clear broths
- Boiled chicken
- Cottage cheese
- White fish

Foods and Drinks to Avoid

During the first 48 hours after teeth whitening, completely avoid:
- Coffee and tea
- Red wine
- Dark sodas
- Berries
- Tomato-based sauces
- Colored condiments
- Chocolate
- Colored sports drinks

Why These Foods Matter

The whitening process temporarily makes your tooth enamel more porous, allowing pigments to penetrate more easily. Dark-colored foods and drinks can quickly stain your freshly whitened teeth, potentially ruining the results of your treatment.

Managing Tooth Sensitivity

Many patients experience increased sensitivity after teeth whitening. To manage this:
- Use sensitivity toothpaste
- Avoid extremely hot or cold foods
- Choose soft, mild-temperature foods
- Take over-the-counter pain relievers if recommended by your dentist

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

Long-Term Dietary Considerations

After the initial 48-hour period, you can gradually reintroduce other foods. However, to maintain your whitening results:
- Use a straw for potentially staining drinks
- Rinse mouth after consuming colored foods
- Maintain good oral hygiene
- Consider touch-up treatments

Professional Tips from Dental Experts

**Important recommendations from dental professionals include:**
- Drink water frequently
- Wait at least 30 minutes after eating before brushing
- Use a white-colored or clear lip balm
- Avoid smoking during the recovery period

When to Consult Your Dentist

If you experience:
- Extreme sensitivity
- Persistent discomfort
- Unexpected staining
- Unusual reactions

Contact your dental professional for personalized advice.

Maintaining Your Bright Smile

Teeth whitening is an investment in your appearance and confidence. By following these dietary guidelines and taking proper care, you can enjoy a brilliant, long-lasting smile that makes you feel incredible.

Conclusion

Understanding how long you can eat after teeth whitening is crucial for maintaining your results and preventing unnecessary sensitivity or staining. By following the recommended ""white diet"" for the first 24-48 hours and being mindful of your food and drink choices, you can protect your newly whitened teeth and enjoy a confident, radiant smile.

1 After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

2 Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.

3 In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.

4 For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.

5 And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.

6 When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him,Wilt thou be made whole?

7 The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.

8 Jesus saith unto him,Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.

9 And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.

10 The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.

11 He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.

12 Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?

13 And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.

14 Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him,Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.

15 The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.

***Commentary*****:**

Here in John’s testimony of the Gospel of Christ, we see a shift take place in how Jesus is perceived by the Jewish people. Until this point in time, the worst response Jesus has met with in his ministry is apathetic disbelief. Even where people do not honor Jesus as the Prophet or believe in him as the Christ or the Son of God, they still find him interesting and potentially useful for their agendas.

When he drove the money changers and the animals from the Temple, the worst response, that we are told of from the Pharisees and other religious bureaucrats of the day, is their demand to be told by whose authority—who instructed him—to take that extreme action. When he told them he could destroy the temple and in three days build it back, they scoffed at his reply and took no further action.(John 2:18-20) But now in chapter five, we see a storm brewing on the horizon as Jesus’ enemies—the powers that be who controlled the religious life of the Jewish people—begin to recognize that Jesus is a very real threat to their power and livelihoods; and their schemes to eradicate this challenge to their positions, those things that they want to do, increase exponentially.

We saw the first hint that the tide might be turning against Jesus in John 4:1–3, where the Pharisees began to pay more attention to his increasing popularity among the people. When Jesus learned this, he left Judea for Galilee, and now in John 5, when Jesus returns to Jerusalem, the religious leaders (“the Jews”) begin to oppose Jesus directly for a variety of reasons (John 5:18). Then, when Jesus returns to Galilee in John 6, he will experience the intense support of a large crowd of Jews who at one point seek to make Jesus king by force (John 6:15), but who ultimately turn against him and abandon him (John 6:66). In John 5–6, we see the opposition against Jesus rising in both Judea and in Galilee—opposition that will culminate in our Lord’s eventual condemnation and crucifixion.

The story of Jesus’ healing of the man at the pool of Bethesda, then, identifies the point where this opposition begins: with the healing of a disabled man on the Sabbath. The Jews begin opposing Jesus because they believe that he breaks the Sabbath and that he blasphemously claims equality with God in the process (John 5:18).

I personally have been blessed to know a significant number of the Amish people, a community known as “Old Order Amish” as they choose to live a more primitive lifestyle than their more progressive “theological cousins” Progressive Amish and Mennonite communities. My old order friends are very devout and will absolutely not work on Sunday, a day when they spend the entire day at church.

However, the women will still fix some sort of a meal at the beginning and end of the day while the men feed the livestock and even milk the cows. They do “home church” wherein fifteen families meet at a home for worship and then a communal meal; the ladies have to put out the food prepared the previous day. These are all some of the tasks, the Amish recognize as being necessities of life. The children must eat, the chickens must be fed, and the cows milked. Likewise Jesus often took the Pharisees to task for their irrational application of God’s law not to labor on the Sabbath.

It had been decided by their ruling body that anything beyond life-saving care qualifies as work or labor. For the Pharisees, this means it is forbidden by the fourth commandment about not working on the Sabbath (Exodus 20:8–10). Jesus, however, having been with God when the law was given to Moses knows the intentions of the Father. By healing the man at the pool of Bethesda and then telling him to “***take up your bed and walk***” Jesus was not breaking the law given to Moses by his Father or encouraging the healed man to do so, but rather, Jesus was only breaking the incorrect interpretation fallaciously applied to that law by mankind.

“***Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.***” (v. 10) Here we now see two indictments of Jesus by the Pharisees, \[1\] he had forsaken the Sabbath and \[2\] he had—in their opinion—the temerity, the bold audacity to equate himself with God. The ultimate act of blasphemy.

Matthew in chapter twelve, verses 9 through 14, cites an event in which Jesus went into their synagogue where he was confronted by the Pharisees. This event appears to have been later, chronologically, to our lesson today. Where there just happened to be a man with a withered hand standing conveniently nearby and the Pharisees used this man as bait to entrap Jesus. Like an overly aggressive prosecuting attorney in a court of law attempting to trap the accused in a statement on the witness stand, they demanded of Jesus, “***Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days***?” (Matthew 12:10 KJV)

Undoubtedly they expected Jesus to give a yes or no response, in a sort of “gotcha” no win situation. If he answered yes, then they could accuse him of heresy for advocating against the law, if he answered no, then they had him dead to rights as he had often been seen healing people on the Sabbath.

But Jesus denied them this simple pleasure when he asked them, “***What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out***? ”

An agrarian society, also known as an agricultural society, is a society that relies primarily on agriculture and the cultivation of large fields or husbandry of animals. In such a society the life of a single creature can be of great value to its steward, not just for the sake of ones conscience—the humanitarian aspect that inculcates concern for the lesser creature—but for its monetary value as well. This is the type of culture that was prominent in the time of Jesus’ ministry.

Knowing that many of the Pharisees were greedy, Jesus played on this fallacy, as he knew that not one of them would allow a single sheep to perish and thereby loose its monetary value.

I have wrote about Matthew Henry, the minister who lived over three centuries ago and who wrote a comprehensive commentary on the bible. In returning to Henry’s work regarding this passage from Matthew chapter 12 we find that he writes:

*The Jewish teachers had corrupted many of the commandments, by interpreting them more loosely than they were intended; a mistake which Christ discovered and rectified in his sermon on the mount: but concerning the fourth commandment, they had erred in the other extreme, and interpreted it too strictly. \[…\] Now that which our Lord Jesus here lays down is, that the works of necessity and mercy are lawful on the sabbath day, which the Jews in many instances were taught to make a scruple of.*

As I mentioned earlier, even my ultra-religious Amish friends will do that, which they perceive as a necessity on Sunday, the day set aside by Christian tradition as the Holy Day of the week. The Amish appear to concur with the opinion authored by Henry three centuries ago, “*the works of necessity and mercy are lawful on the sabbath day.*”

Jesus knew the intent of the Father. In this Gospel John goes out of his way to make the case that Jesus was the ***Word***; “***In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God.***” (John 1:1-2) In verse fourteen John adds; “***And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.***” Therefore, why would Jesus not know the intentions of his Father, God in heaven? Obviously, since he was there with God at the time, he would have an intimate knowledge of what God had in mind when he gave the fourth commandment to Moses. Based upon the example of Christ to heal in the Sabbath, it should be obvious to everyone, that as Henry wrote; “*The works of necessity and mercy are lawful on the sabbath day.*”

Now lets go back to our assignment for this day, chapter 5 where we read; “***When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he already had been in that condition a long time, He said to him, “Wilt thou be made whole***?” (v. 6) For some reason, Jesus selected this man, he singled him out from among the great multitude of sick people (see verse 3). Jesus was not about to conduct a healing crusade at the Pool of Bethesda, but He was about to miraculously meet this one man’s need.

“***Do you want to be made well***?” This seems like both a silly question and a rather innocuous one, both at the same time. After all, what crippled person doesn’t want to walk again, so to some it might seem impertinent, perhaps even cruel. But yet to others, the question might seem innocent enough, but with closer examination of the context it sets up an argument for faith in Jesus.

The man begins to argue, telling Jesus that he had no one to pick him up and put him in the pool where local legend maintained that some people had occasionally found healing. But Jesus told him, “***Rise, take up your bed and walk***.” Reading between the lines, Jesus is telling the man, “***Forget the legends about the pool, do what I tell you to do, get up, pick up your bed, and walk.***” He is saying do not have faith in a pool, butrather believe in me, and be healed. Jesus did not tell him—as we see in verse 13—who he was, he didn’t say I am the Son of God, or I am the Messiah, no he just told the man to get up and walk, then Jesus apparently walked away, into the crowd.

In verses 9 through 16 we see that the man did as Jesus told him, he got up took his bed and walked away. Keep in mind, this was a poor person, unable to work as he was disabled. He depended on others for coin and sustenance. His bed, the pallet he laid on while waiting for a miracle at the pool, was most likely his only possession. Jesus, performed a labor of mercy on that Sabbath day, and he told the man to perform a labor of necessity by taking away his only possession.

Then the Pharisees caught the poor guy carrying his bed; “***The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed***.’”

Keep in mind that these guys are so greedy that they would not allow a single sheep to perish on the Sabbath day, but rather rescue the poor animal, not because it was the right thing to do but because they were afraid they might loose something of value. They had no problem protecting that which was theirs on the Sabbath, but here they are ready to arrest a poor guy for carrying a dirty blanket or quilt, a pallet, he had lain on while crippled and destitute at the pool.

Apparently the man was terrified, being confronted by some of the most powerful men of the time and place; I ask you who wouldn’t be frightened. He informed them that he had been told to carry the bed by the man who healed him at the pool. (v. 11) When asked who it was that healed him, he couldn’t say. (v. 13) But later on, Jesus found the man and told him, “***Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee***.” (v. 14) We are to assume that Jesus then identified himself, as John tells us in the next verse that the man went to the Pharisees and told them who it was that had healed him and told him to carry his bed—to labor—on the Sabbath day; for this reason according to John, the Pharisees determined to persecute Jesus. (vs. 15-16)

In Matthew 23:27 Jesus says; “***Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.*** ”

In those days, and even today in some parts of the world, a deceased person is/was placed in a tomb, the more affluent wrapped in cloth and anointed with perfumes to hide the stench, until the flesh and organs had rotted away leaving the bones, which were them placed in an ossuary or box as a place of final internment. In places where burial space is scarce, this is a necessity. As you might imagine, the smell in such a tomb would be horrid, rotting bodily tissues and fluids, a place Jesus said was full of uncleanness.

It was a custom then as it is today to white wash or paint these tombs or mausoleums, as if the outward appearance of the tomb made the inside any less nasty. Jesus compared these men to such places, attractive on the outside but full of stench, rot and filth inside. So bad that their souls were dead to God.

In John chapter three, the Pharisee Nicodemus admitted to Jesus that they—or at least some of them—knew full well that he, Jesus, was indeed the Son of God, but yet they as a group set about persecuting, and eventually handing him over to Pontius Pilate for them (the Romans) to kill. How often do we see humans turning their backs on God, and his Word today, so that they might do as they want to do and not what is right? The Pharisees wanted things to go their way, and were willing to kill Jesus to protect their way of life.

How often do we see unbelievers cite Christian tradition and doctrine, using these as a cudgel, to attack the followers of Christ when they—the unbelievers—have no idea of what the words actually mean. A tactic that is most often that which is characterized as ""attacking a straw man” or introducing an argument in an attempt to justify their own sinful acts by claiming Christians do not abide by their own traditions. How are those that vehemently attack Christian today any different than the Pharisees that attacked Jesus?

For example, lets return to my Amish friends. An atheist neighbor, might look out his window on a Sunday morning while sipping coffee, and see that Schwartz—the Amish guy next door who refused to be hired by the atheist to work on Sunday afternoon—is out milking his cows before going to church, and think of Schwartz as a hypocrite for not agreeing to do ***what the atheist wanted done*** on Sunday but yet is now out “laboring” in the milk barn. The Athiest is not getting his way and is willing to accuse the Amish man of hypocrisy. For Schwartz, as he milks his cows, this is an ***act of necessity and mercy***, as the old milk cow Bessie, whose udder is swollen with milk, would suffer unnecessarily if not milked all day on Sunday. Don’t believe me, just discount how being swollen with milk is not painful in the presence of a nursing Mother who knows all too well about discomfort…

The lessons to take away from today’s assignment is that \[1\] common sense must prevail when necessity and mercy are called for, just as in the case of the healing at the pool of Bethesda. \[2\] Humans often twist the Word of God—just as the Pharisees did—to attack Christ and his followers; therefore it behooves you as a follower of Christ to know the meaning of the Word so that you can defend yourself and the Faith in general. And \[3\] sometimes blind faith in the power of God should prevail; the man at the pool started to argue, but then in an act of faith he attempted to stand up, and he found he had experienced a miracle!

Do you, or a Christian you know, have such faith?

**Benediction**

O God, who wonderfully created, and yet more wonderfully restored, the dignity of human nature: Grant that we may share the divine life of him who humbled himself to share our humanity, your Son Jesus Christ; who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.

Amen.

In verses 9 through 16 we see that the man did as Jesus told him, he got up took his bed and walked away. Keep in mind, this was a poor person, unable to work as he was disabled. He depended on others for coin and sustenance. His bed, the pallet he laid on while waiting for a miracle at the pool, was most likely his only possession. Jesus, performed a labor of mercy on that Sabbath day, and he told the man to perform a labor of necessity by taking away his only possession.

Then the Pharisees caught the poor guy carrying his bed; “***The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed***.’”

Keep in mind that these guys are so greedy that they would not allow a single sheep to perish on the Sabbath day, but rather rescue the poor animal, not because it was the right thing to do but because they were afraid they might loose something of value. They had no problem protecting that which was theirs on the Sabbath, but here they are ready to arrest a poor guy for carrying a dirty blanket or quilt, a pallet, he had lain on while crippled and destitute at the pool.

Apparently the man was terrified, being confronted by some of the most powerful men of the time and place; I ask you who wouldn’t be frightened. He informed them that he had been told to carry the bed by the man who healed him at the pool. (v. 11) When asked who it was that healed him, he couldn’t say. (v. 13) But later on, Jesus found the man and told him, “***Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee***.” (v. 14) We are to assume that Jesus then identified himself, as John tells us in the next verse that the man went to the Pharisees and told them who it was that had healed him and told him to carry his bed—to labor—on the Sabbath day; for this reason according to John, the Pharisees determined to persecute Jesus. (vs. 15-16)

In Matthew 23:27 Jesus says; “***Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.*** ”

In those days, and even today in some parts of the world, a deceased person is/was placed in a tomb, the more affluent wrapped in cloth and anointed with perfumes to hide the stench, until the flesh and organs had rotted away leaving the bones, which were them placed in an ossuary or box as a place of final internment. In places where burial space is scarce, this is a necessity. As you might imagine, the smell in such a tomb would be horrid, rotting bodily tissues and fluids, a place Jesus said was full of uncleanness.

It was a custom then as it is today to white wash or paint these tombs or mausoleums, as if the outward appearance of the tomb made the inside any less nasty. Jesus compared these men to such places, attractive on the outside but full of stench, rot and filth inside. So bad that their souls were dead to God.

In John chapter three, the Pharisee Nicodemus admitted to Jesus that they—or at least some of them—knew full well that he, Jesus, was indeed the Son of God, but yet they as a group set about persecuting, and eventually handing him over to Pontius Pilate for them (the Romans) to kill. How often do we see humans turning their backs on God, and his Word today, so that they might do as they want to do and not what is right? The Pharisees wanted things to go their way, and were willing to kill Jesus to protect their way of life.

How often do we see unbelievers cite Christian tradition and doctrine, using these as a cudgel, to attack the followers of Christ when they—the unbelievers—have no idea of what the words actually mean. A tactic that is most often that which is characterized as ""attacking a straw man” or introducing an argument in an attempt to justify their own sinful acts by claiming Christians do not abide by their own traditions. How are those that vehemently attack Christian today any different than the Pharisees that attacked Jesus?

For example, lets return to my Amish friends. An atheist neighbor, might look out his window on a Sunday morning while sipping coffee, and see that Schwartz—the Amish guy next door who refused to be hired by the atheist to work on Sunday afternoon—is out milking his cows before going to church, and think of Schwartz as a hypocrite for not agreeing to do ***what the atheist wanted done*** on Sunday but yet is now out “laboring” in the milk barn. The Athiest is not getting his way and is willing to accuse the Amish man of hypocrisy. For Schwartz, as he milks his cows, this is an ***act of necessity and mercy***, as the old milk cow Bessie, whose udder is swollen with milk, would suffer unnecessarily if not milked all day on Sunday. Don’t believe me, just discount how being swollen with milk is not painful in the presence of a nursing Mother who knows all too well about discomfort…

The lessons to take away from today’s assignment is that \[1\] common sense must prevail when necessity and mercy are called for, just as in the case of the healing at the pool of Bethesda. \[2\] Humans often twist the Word of God—just as the Pharisees did—to attack Christ and his followers; therefore it behooves you as a follower of Christ to know the meaning of the Word so that you can defend yourself and the Faith in general. And \[3\] sometimes blind faith in the power of God should prevail; the man at the pool started to argue, but then in an act of faith he attempted to stand up, and he found he had experienced a miracle!

Do you, or a Christian you know, have such faith?

**Benediction**

O God, who wonderfully created, and yet more wonderfully restored, the dignity of human nature: Grant that we may share the divine life of him who humbled himself to share our humanity, your Son Jesus Christ; who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.

Amen.

**Gospel: John 5:1–15**

1 After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

2 Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.

3 In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.

4 For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.

5 And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.

6 When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him,Wilt thou be made whole?

7 The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.

8 Jesus saith unto him,Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.

9 And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.

10 The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.

11 He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.

12 Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?

13 And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.

14 Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him,Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.

15 The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.

***Commentary*****:**

Here in John’s testimony of the Gospel of Christ, we see a shift take place in how Jesus is perceived by the Jewish people. Until this point in time, the worst response Jesus has met with in his ministry is apathetic disbelief. Even where people do not honor Jesus as the Prophet or believe in him as the Christ or the Son of God, they still find him interesting and potentially useful for their agendas.

When he drove the money changers and the animals from the Temple, the worst response, that we are told of from the Pharisees and other religious bureaucrats of the day, is their demand to be told by whose authority—who instructed him—to take that extreme action. When he told them he could destroy the temple and in three days build it back, they scoffed at his reply and took no further action.(John 2:18-20) But now in chapter five, we see a storm brewing on the horizon as Jesus’ enemies—the powers that be who controlled the religious life of the Jewish people—begin to recognize that Jesus is a very real threat to their power and livelihoods; and their schemes to eradicate this challenge to their positions, those things that they want to do, increase exponentially.

We saw the first hint that the tide might be turning against Jesus in John 4:1–3, where the Pharisees began to pay more attention to his increasing popularity among the people. When Jesus learned this, he left Judea for Galilee, and now in John 5, when Jesus returns to Jerusalem, the religious leaders (“the Jews”) begin to oppose Jesus directly for a variety of reasons (John 5:18). Then, when Jesus returns to Galilee in John 6, he will experience the intense support of a large crowd of Jews who at one point seek to make Jesus king by force (John 6:15), but who ultimately turn against him and abandon him (John 6:66). In John 5–6, we see the opposition against Jesus rising in both Judea and in Galilee—opposition that will culminate in our Lord’s eventual condemnation and crucifixion.

The story of Jesus’ healing of the man at the pool of Bethesda, then, identifies the point where this opposition begins: with the healing of a disabled man on the Sabbath. The Jews begin opposing Jesus because they believe that he breaks the Sabbath and that he blasphemously claims equality with God in the process (John 5:18).

I personally have been blessed to know a significant number of the Amish people, a community known as “Old Order Amish” as they choose to live a more primitive lifestyle than their more progressive “theological cousins” Progressive Amish and Mennonite communities. My old order friends are very devout and will absolutely not work on Sunday, a day when they spend the entire day at church.

However, the women will still fix some sort of a meal at the beginning and end of the day while the men feed the livestock and even milk the cows. They do “home church” wherein fifteen families meet at a home for worship and then a communal meal; the ladies have to put out the food prepared the previous day. These are all some of the tasks, the Amish recognize as being necessities of life. The children must eat, the chickens must be fed, and the cows milked. Likewise Jesus often took the Pharisees to task for their irrational application of God’s law not to labor on the Sabbath.

It had been decided by their ruling body that anything beyond life-saving care qualifies as work or labor. For the Pharisees, this means it is forbidden by the fourth commandment about not working on the Sabbath (Exodus 20:8–10). Jesus, however, having been with God when the law was given to Moses knows the intentions of the Father. By healing the man at the pool of Bethesda and then telling him to “***take up your bed and walk***” Jesus was not breaking the law given to Moses by his Father or encouraging the healed man to do so, but rather, Jesus was only breaking the incorrect interpretation fallaciously applied to that law by mankind.

“***Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.***” (v. 10) Here we now see two indictments of Jesus by the Pharisees, \[1\] he had forsaken the Sabbath and \[2\] he had—in their opinion—the temerity, the bold audacity to equate himself with God. The ultimate act of blasphemy.

Matthew in chapter twelve, verses 9 through 14, cites an event in which Jesus went into their synagogue where he was confronted by the Pharisees. This event appears to have been later, chronologically, to our lesson today. Where there just happened to be a man with a withered hand standing conveniently nearby and the Pharisees used this man as bait to entrap Jesus. Like an overly aggressive prosecuting attorney in a court of law attempting to trap the accused in a statement on the witness stand, they demanded of Jesus, “***Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days***?” (Matthew 12:10 KJV)

Undoubtedly they expected Jesus to give a yes or no response, in a sort of “gotcha” no win situation. If he answered yes, then they could accuse him of heresy for advocating against the law, if he answered no, then they had him dead to rights as he had often been seen healing people on the Sabbath.

But Jesus denied them this simple pleasure when he asked them, “***What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out***? ”

An agrarian society, also known as an agricultural society, is a society that relies primarily on agriculture and the cultivation of large fields or husbandry of animals. In such a society the life of a single creature can be of great value to its steward, not just for the sake of ones conscience—the humanitarian aspect that inculcates concern for the lesser creature—but for its monetary value as well. This is the type of culture that was prominent in the time of Jesus’ ministry.

Knowing that many of the Pharisees were greedy, Jesus played on this fallacy, as he knew that not one of them would allow a single sheep to perish and thereby loose its monetary value.

I have wrote about Matthew Henry, the minister who lived over three centuries ago and who wrote a comprehensive commentary on the bible. In returning to Henry’s work regarding this passage from Matthew chapter 12 we find that he writes:

*The Jewish teachers had corrupted many of the commandments, by interpreting them more loosely than they were intended; a mistake which Christ discovered and rectified in his sermon on the mount: but concerning the fourth commandment, they had erred in the other extreme, and interpreted it too strictly. \[…\] Now that which our Lord Jesus here lays down is, that the works of necessity and mercy are lawful on the sabbath day, which the Jews in many instances were taught to make a scruple of.*

As I mentioned earlier, even my ultra-religious Amish friends will do that, which they perceive as a necessity on Sunday, the day set aside by Christian tradition as the Holy Day of the week. The Amish appear to concur with the opinion authored by Henry three centuries ago, “*the works of necessity and mercy are lawful on the sabbath day.*”

Jesus knew the intent of the Father. In this Gospel John goes out of his way to make the case that Jesus was the ***Word***; “***In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God.***” (John 1:1-2) In verse fourteen John adds; “***And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.***” Therefore, why would Jesus not know the intentions of his Father, God in heaven? Obviously, since he was there with God at the time, he would have an intimate knowledge of what God had in mind when he gave the fourth commandment to Moses. Based upon the example of Christ to heal in the Sabbath, it should be obvious to everyone, that as Henry wrote; “*The works of necessity and mercy are lawful on the sabbath day.*”

Now lets go back to our assignment for this day, chapter 5 where we read; “***When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he already had been in that condition a long time, He said to him, “Wilt thou be made whole***?” (v. 6) For some reason, Jesus selected this man, he singled him out from among the great multitude of sick people (see verse 3). Jesus was not about to conduct a healing crusade at the Pool of Bethesda, but He was about to miraculously meet this one man’s need.

“***Do you want to be made well***?” This seems like both a silly question and a rather innocuous one, both at the same time. After all, what crippled person doesn’t want to walk again, so to some it might seem impertinent, perhaps even cruel. But yet to others, the question might seem innocent enough, but with closer examination of the context it sets up an argument for faith in Jesus.

The man begins to argue, telling Jesus that he had no one to pick him up and put him in the pool where local legend maintained that some people had occasionally found healing. But Jesus told him, “***Rise, take up your bed and walk***.” Reading between the lines, Jesus is telling the man, “***Forget the legends about the pool, do what I tell you to do, get up, pick up your bed, and walk.***” He is saying do not have faith in a pool, butrather believe in me, and be healed. Jesus did not tell him—as we see in verse 13—who he was, he didn’t say I am the Son of God, or I am the Messiah, no he just told the man to get up and walk, then Jesus apparently walked away, into the crowd.

In verses 9 through 16 we see that the man did as Jesus told him, he got up took his bed and walked away. Keep in mind, this was a poor person, unable to work as he was disabled. He depended on others for coin and sustenance. His bed, the pallet he laid on while waiting for a miracle at the pool, was most likely his only possession. Jesus, performed a labor of mercy on that Sabbath day, and he told the man to perform a labor of necessity by taking away his only possession.

Then the Pharisees caught the poor guy carrying his bed; “***The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed***.’”

Keep in mind that these guys are so greedy that they would not allow a single sheep to perish on the Sabbath day, but rather rescue the poor animal, not because it was the right thing to do but because they were afraid they might loose something of value. They had no problem protecting that which was theirs on the Sabbath, but here they are ready to arrest a poor guy for carrying a dirty blanket or quilt, a pallet, he had lain on while crippled and destitute at the pool.

Apparently the man was terrified, being confronted by some of the most powerful men of the time and place; I ask you who wouldn’t be frightened. He informed them that he had been told to carry the bed by the man who healed him at the pool. (v. 11) When asked who it was that healed him, he couldn’t say. (v. 13) But later on, Jesus found the man and told him, “***Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee***.” (v. 14) We are to assume that Jesus then identified himself, as John tells us in the next verse that the man went to the Pharisees and told them who it was that had healed him and told him to carry his bed—to labor—on the Sabbath day; for this reason according to John, the Pharisees determined to persecute Jesus. (vs. 15-16)

In Matthew 23:27 Jesus says; “***Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.*** ”

In those days, and even today in some parts of the world, a deceased person is/was placed in a tomb, the more affluent wrapped in cloth and anointed with perfumes to hide the stench, until the flesh and organs had rotted away leaving the bones, which were them placed in an ossuary or box as a place of final internment. In places where burial space is scarce, this is a necessity. As you might imagine, the smell in such a tomb would be horrid, rotting bodily tissues and fluids, a place Jesus said was full of uncleanness.

It was a custom then as it is today to white wash or paint these tombs or mausoleums, as if the outward appearance of the tomb made the inside any less nasty. Jesus compared these men to such places, attractive on the outside but full of stench, rot and filth inside. So bad that their souls were dead to God.

1hx3qkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/sterilization/comments/1hx3qkg/got_my_tubes_out/,Got My Tubes Out! ,"Success! I (29F) finally got my laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy and wanted to share my experience for those who might be feeling a little anxious. I got my copper IUD taken out also. I had never had surgery before so I was a little nervous. If you're feeling extra anxious you can tell your nurse and they'll give you something to help you relax in pre-op.

My partner was going to go in with me, but he's sick so my friend came with me instead. She recently had a hysterectomy so she was familiar with the surgery process which was super helpful.

They told me to get there at 6am, but we got there a little early just in case. There was no eating or drinking even water past 10pm the night before. I was able to check in and get my wrist band. Then they took me into a little pre-op room and I gave a urine sample and they had me brush my teeth in case of any leftover bacteria for anesthesia. Then I stripped into a gown, hairnet, and socks. If you're in NYC and go to NYU Langone, they give you your own duffle bag to put your clothes and belongings in. They also gave me a warmed up blanket to use for my legs.

Then my friend came in and we were able to hang out for an hour or so while they got my vitals and the Doctor, the assistant, and the anesthesiologist came in at different times and had me sign some extra consent forms. Everyone on the team was so nice and made me feel really comfortable.

After that I gave all my stuff to my friend. If you have no one with you they'll put your stuff in a locker for you. You can't have anything on you in the operating room. When I got in there, the hardest part was the IV needle. After that, they gave me oxygen and I passed right out. Before I knew it I was waking up in the recovery room.

Immediate symptoms from waking up, I felt a lot of burning in my urethra from the urinal catheter. Thats normal and mostly goes away in a few hours to a day. I also had gas pain and a little bit of discomfort from the incisions. They gave me fentanyl and one oxycodone which helped immensely. Once the pain meds kicked in I felt completely fine. The one thing I had to do before being discharged was pee, so that they knew my bladder was working properly. The nurse who was with me was so nice, she brought me 2 coffees, 2 waters, and 2 ginger ales. And some graham crackers and apple sauce too because I was so hungry. If you want to bring snacks with you, I highly recommend it.

Once you have to pee, they will disconnect your IV and walk you to the bathroom so you don't fall over. They'll also stay with you in there just in case. My nurse left the faucet running for ""inspiration"" xD Since they took my IUD out, I was bleeding a little bit and you can't use tampons so they gave me a pad.

After a couple hours I was free to go home! I have Tylenol 500, Ibuprofen 600, and Gabapentin. I cycle all of them every 3 hours to manage the pain. I also take gas-x to help with the gas pain. They also gave me a tummy wrap to help with compression. Overall, the first 12 hours I feel perfectly fine. The hardest part is not really being able to use my core muscles so rolling over in bed and picking things up are a little bit of a challenge. Tomorrow I'll take the bandages off. And I can't take baths for 6 weeks.

Have you ever had one of those lightbulb moments where you just *knew* you were making the right decision? This year has been full of ups and downs, but I think I finally cracked the code to *work smarter, not harder*! 💡

**So, what's the best decision I've made this year?** I decided to do less but do it better. Wait, that almost sounds too easy, right? But hear me out!

**Quality over Quantity:**  
We always hear that phrase, but do we ever actually follow it? I took a hard look at my to-do list and thought, ""Are all these tasks actually moving the needle?"" Spoiler alert: Nope! 🚫 So I cut out the fluff and focused on just a few key tasks. Guess what? My productivity skyrocketed.

**Scheduled 'Me Time':**  
Honestly, the idea of scheduling downtime felt scandalous at first. 🙊 But giving myself permission to rest made me *more* effective. Whether it’s a walk, a video game, or just staring into space – those breaks recharged my creativity.

**Embraced Saying 'No':**  
Like a lot of us, I was a yes-person. But learning to say ""no"" to things that don’t serve my goals has been liberating. Can I get an amen on that one? 🙌

**Laugh it Off:**  
Keeping things light-hearted helps too. Ran out of coffee? So what, have water! 🤣 Not every little setback needs to throw your whole day off.

**Gratitude Journaling:**  
Okay, this one sounds super corny, but it works! Ending my day jotting down three things I’m grateful for helps shift my mindset. It’s amazing what you notice when you stop to reflect. 🌟

I’m curious, what’s been your game-changing decision this year? Maybe it’s something small that led to a big impact, or perhaps a big move that’s turned your life around. Whatever it is, I’d love to hear what’s working for you.

At the end of the day, it’s all about finding what fuels your fire and sticking to it. Here’s to making choices that bring out the best in us all! 🚀

1hx3kjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1hx3kjv/hr_the_dish/,[HR] The Dish,"Sometimes Clark wondered, while lying semi-conscious on the kitchen floor, feeling his skin cells replicating and shedding and his toenails growing: if he could go back in time, to the start of all of this, if only to save Kristen and Isla, would he clean that frying pan?

*No*, he decided every time. It was a matter of principle.

He wasn’t unreasonable. He understood where Kristen was coming from; he saw all perspectives and weighed them equally. He was a very logical man with an abnormally high emotional intelligence. His boss always told him that.

They had long ago made a pact that Kristen would do most of the cooking for the family, and Clark would do the dishes. This served them well for several years of their marriage, even though Kristen had a tendency to use more dishes than were strictly necessary for the meal – and sometimes she would even swap out dishes mid-cook for one she liked better, creating an additional dish to clean for no good reason. Clark bought her a “One Pot Meal” cookbook, hoping to subtly correct the behavior; but Kristen made one half-hearted “spaghetti a la hot dog” and then continued using 4 or 5 pots and pans per dinner.

Clark could shake that off. He was very even-tempered. Friends often commented on how easy going he was. The one time he raised his voice even 1 decibel to Kristen was when he was working late and got fast food for dinner, so she made Velveeta shells and cheese for her and Isla. After 11 stressful hours in the office, he came home and the pot wasn’t even soaking. The fake cheese had already hardened into yellow cement, overcooked noodles burned onto the bottom so badly that he broke the spatula handle trying to scrape them off.

It’s not like they hadn’t talked about it. He very pleasantly would remind her to put some hot water and dish soap in the pots so they were ready to go when he did dishes. It would only take a few seconds for her, but it could be 10 minutes of extra scrubbing for him. A reasonable thing to ask, and she always agreed. At least verbally.

So, understandably, he was a little peeved, after working so long with barely any sleep, and after everything he did for the family and all the money he made for them, to come home to a pot that was completely ruined, all because of her carelessness. To just have zero thought of him at all; to care so little about what he’s going to go through when doing the dishes; it just showed an ungratefulness, a *disrespect*. So sure, he tossed the pot in her general direction (not “threw it at her*”*, like she claimed), and said, “Do you think I could get a little help here?” in a tone that was clearly half-joking. She said he screamed at her. She was always exaggerating to make him look bad.

That pot was not The Dish, but it was a precursor to The Dish. In a long-term relationship, nothing is ever just about one thing, it’s always about a dozen years of things, all flying around your brain and bouncing off one another like the balls in Hungry Hungry Hippos. You would like to just calmly collect one ball, but the opposing hippo wants it too, just as badly, so you end up chomping after all of them, slamming your fist down again and again, trying to score as many dumb arguments in your favor as you can so you can win the game.

Clark could see the fruitlessness of all this; relationship dynamics like that were obvious to him. When Kristen started bringing up old things he’d already apologized for, Clark would calmly ask her to stop and to focus on the one issue he needed to discuss with her. That’s how you have a conversation like an *adult*. And that’s what he was trying to do with The Dish. To his memory, it played out something like this:

Kristen: “Hey honey, would you mind clearing out the sink when you get a chance, I need to thaw out the chicken.”

Clark: “Oh, I already did all the dishes from dinner last night.”

Kristen: “Did you? I can see there’s a frying pan in there, a plate, maybe a glass. Some silverware.”

Clark: “Yeah, there is, that’s from your breakfast, remember?”

Kristen: “Okay, sure. Can you clean them when you get a chance.” \[this was not a question\]

Clark: \[chuckling to defuse the situation\] “I don’t see why I should clean *your* dishes, you didn’t make *me* any breakfast.”

Kristen: “You said you weren’t hungry.”

Clark: “I wasn’t.”

Kristen: “What’s the problem here? We agreed that you do the dishes.”

Clark: “Yeah, when you cook. You only cooked one dinner this week. Two nights ago, we had dinner with your parents. The rest of the days we had takeout or leftovers. I eat lunch at work and skip breakfast. So, every dish that’s been in that sink this week, except for a few coffee mugs, and last night’s dinner, has been yours.”

Kristen: “And your child’s!”

Clark: “Please, she barely eats anything except yogurt and Goldfish crackers. But sure, I’ll give you that one, I concede that I have been and will continue to wash all of Isla’s dishes. But the ones in the sink are yours and yours alone.”

Kristen: “Are you serious right now? You’re really doing this?”

Clark: “Honey, calm down, it’s not…”

Kristen: “Fuck you and your calm down. This is ridiculous. All the work I do in this house, all your dirty laundry, scrubbing your piss stains off the toilet, and you want to make it transactional? You want to start keeping score? You will lose that game, Clark. You will lose every time.”

Clark: \[with a strategically dumbfounded expression on his face\] “Honey, no reason to get so upset. We don’t need to exhume dead fights, you know I appreciate you and recognize how hard you work around the house. I’m just saying, when it comes to this one little thing about dishes I didn’t partake in…”

Kristen: “You can’t even wash a damn dish for me when you’re home all weekend doing nothing. Fine. I don’t care. I’ll thaw the chicken on top of it.”

And thus, a cold war commenced. The plate, glass, and silverware did end up getting washed the next time a load of dinner dishes came through; it was impossible to tell the offending items from the rest, and anyway, they were easy enough to rinse off. (Clark, in later arguments on the topic, chose to spin this as a gesture of goodwill, a meeting-halfway olive branch.) The frying pan, though, was covered in bacon grease, egg yolk, burnt bits of something or other. She could take care of that one. Even if it had been soaking – and it *hadn’t* been, which is really what started all this in the first place – it would have been a pain to scrub down. So it remained in the sink, getting in the way, becoming further contaminated by raw meat and spoiled milk, a constant irritant – a monument to their mutual pettiness.

It didn’t take long to start to smell. At first it was just the sour smokiness of bacon grease starting to turn, but soon enough, the stench got more and more putrid – rotten eggs, hot trash, corpses. Walking into the kitchen would trigger Clark’s gag reflex. But a man must stand by his principles. That’s called integrity. If you don’t have integrity, you don’t have anything in this world. The dish remained unwashed.

After a week or so a white mold started growing over the hardened egg yolk, the blackened bits of meat. Clark and Kristen both saw it. They raised eyebrows at each other, silently daring each other to cave in and wash the pan; but neither would flinch. They wouldn’t even speak of it. Hell, they were speaking very little about anything anymore. It was all business.

“You drop off Isla, I’ll go to the post office”, “We need to pay the oil bill by Thursday”. The sovereign nations of Clark and Kristen could negotiate in good faith on matters of trade and security, but all other matters had to be interlocuted through their ambassador, Isla.

“Daddy, mommy wants you to know she’s going out with Auntie Elise.”

“Tell mommy that’s fine, but she needs to be home by nine because you need her to put you to bed.”

“Mommy says you’re a grown up who is more than cape bull of putting me to bed.”

“Don’t you like when mommy reads to you and kisses you goodnight, Isla?”

“I love bedtime with mommy.”

“Go tell her that.”

Clark always had Isla’s best interest at heart. It bothered him that Kristen could be so selfish sometimes.

\*\*\*

A few days after the mold appeared, Clark’s mother came to pick up Isla while Kristen was at her part-time job. Just walking in the front door, she immediately noticed what the family had become nose-blind to.

“Yeesh, what reeks in here?”

“Is it that bad? It’s just a dirty dish.”

“Well, why don’t you clean it?”

“It’s a long story.”

“Oh, come now. I’ll clean it.”

Clark’s mom rolled up her sleeves and headed towards the kitchen, but Clark grabbed her arm – not enough to hurt her, just enough to let her know he wasn’t kidding around.

“Leave it. I’ll take care of it,” he said in a tone that may have come out more annoyed and serious than he intended. “Anyways, you’re here for Isla and she’s very excited. She’s all ready to go. Isla!”

Isla meandered down the stairs with her backpack on. Clark noticed she was acting sullen and dragging her feet; he instantly knew what she was playing at.

“Sweetie, you don’t need that backpack, I told you, you can’t stay at grandma’s this weekend.”

Clark’s mom tried to undermine him: “You know I really don’t mind dear.”

“No, she hasn’t been feeling well. She’s lucky I’m letting her go with you at all.”  

Isla slumped her backpack off and took her grandmother’s hand, still moving with that pouty walk of hers. Clark thought she must have got the manipulation tactics from her mother.

\*\*\*

A few weeks later, the mold had completely enveloped the pan and started creeping into the sink. It was still mostly an off-white, but other colors had tendrilled their way throughout: browns and yellows and greens. It had become self-evident that nobody was going to clean the pan, and so it had become a part of the house, like an ugly chair that had been in the guest room so long everybody just takes for granted that it belongs there.

Kristen wasn’t comfortable eating off of dishes that had been exposed to the mold, so they started using paper plates and plastic forks. They only cooked things that came in disposable packaging or ordered take out. Clark liked instant ramen, steamer bags of vegetables, and Chinese food just fine. He was happy to have a break from doing dishes. More time to pursue his hobbies, he reasoned. Hobbies make for a well-rounded man.

They went out to eat often. Isla was at an age where she caused too much commotion when she was in public, shouting and acting out, jumping out of her seat and running around. Her teacher even asked if anything was going on at home, but of course, there wasn’t. As a result of her rambunctiousness, it seemed easier to eat separately; Clark would stop somewhere on his way home from work and grab some food, maybe a few drinks. Then, he’d go home and sit with Isla while Kristen went out.

Kristen particularly liked her “me time” and would sometimes stretch her dinner to three, four hours. Usually, she made it home for bedtime. Clark didn’t mind the chance to watch his movies or play his games without being nagged at. He could relax with a nice whiskey or a six pack and just recharge while Isla played on her iPad. It seemed like a logical system. They all got what they wanted.

\*\*\*

The mold had overtaken the countertop and worked its way up to the windowsill when Kristen first brought up divorce. It came out of nowhere.

Clark was taken aback, and he said as much. Things had been going so well – they had finally found a harmony built on compromise and sound decisions. Fewer chores meant less stress on everybody. Isla was even starting to calm down at school. Why did Kristen want to blow up this perfect life they had created together? It was irrational and she was acting crazy. This was always the problem with Kristen, she was impulsive and couldn’t see the big picture. Clark recommended that she give it a couple weeks, maybe she could try counseling, and then see if she still feels like divorce is the right answer. Kristen reluctantly agreed.

It wasn’t long after that that Isla developed a cough. A deep, hacking cough, like a 40-year smoker, that kept her up at night. Kristen was worried, but Isla didn’t have a fever, and urgent care was very expensive. It was flu season, so Clark figured she was due for a little bug, and he decided to keep her home from school for a few days and see what happens. He even used what little paid time-off he had at work so he could tend to her, while Kristen worked her frivolous part-time job that barely made them any money. Happy wife, happy life, he reminded himself.

Isla slept a lot the first two days. Her voice was gravelly, and she said it hurt to breathe in too deep. Clark made sure she had plenty of fluids and cough drops. He put Vick’s Vape-O-Rub on her chest. He put a cold towel on her head, even though that felt stupid because she didn’t have a fever. At one point she got herself all agitated and even started crying; Clark had had colds that bad before, so he commiserated. He patted her shoulder, gave her a teddy bear, read her a story and soon enough, she was asleep. He smiled at her cherubic little face and thought, *I’m doing a good job. Time to go downstairs for a little relaxation*. It was stressful caring for a sick kid all day. He poured a finger or three of bourbon and sat down to watch highlights of the weekend’s football games.

You can’t really blame him for falling asleep. He’d been having a hard time sleeping at night and now, with the drone of the talking heads on TV, the comfy couch, the warm feeling in his belly – nothing wrong with a nap. If Isla needed anything, she’d call down. She was a big girl.

\*\*\*

He awoke to Kristen screaming his name from upstairs.

His first thought was that she had found his stash of booze in the luggage in the upstairs closet, and that spurred him off the couch and up the stairs in a panic. Later, he would choose not to remember the sense of relief he felt when he realized it wasn’t the stash, it was that their daughter was dead.

\*\*\*

An allergic reaction to the mold in her lungs, the doctor said. Anaphylaxis.

They spoke even less than before in the days leading up to the funeral. What was there to say? They both knew the other was to blame and it wasn’t worth rehashing it. There was nothing to salvage, here.

When asked about the source of the mold, they would shrug and comment on the age of the house, the pipes, the central air. They didn’t remove the pan from the sink, though. The layer of fuzz reaching for the ceiling, crawling over the runner in front of the oven felt like a punishment they deserved. Part of Clark hoped he had the same allergy and would go the same way Isla did.

Clark stopped going to work. He didn’t call in sick, he just didn’t leave the house and didn’t answer his phone. It seemed like such a pointless and silly endeavor, if you think about it logically. What was the goal? To make money. Why? To buy food and a place to live. Why? That’s where it all became so irrational.

He was sitting on the kitchen floor with his back to the oven, watching the mold, when Kristen said she was heading in to work. He had been watching it long enough that he was sure he could see it expanding in real time, picometer by picometer, spreading out in all directions at once. An entire universe comprised of spores with practically invisible, tubular hyphae elongating and branching past the edge of space and time. Tiny explorers, feeling no fear about what exists outside their borders, boldly encroaching onward to uncharted laminate tile.

Kristen was lingering, looking at him. She said, “I wasn’t at work that day.”

Clark idly wished he was a part of that network of fungi; to feel connected and courageous. To reach for something more even when you know it’s just more tile, more countertop, more filthy dishes; always hoping against hope there’s something else.

Kristen said, “I’ve been cheating you.”

*Does it all share one mind?* he thought. *Or are there trillions of individual minds working in synchronicity within the colony?* He didn’t know which would be more incredible to him. He wondered, if he could get on the correct cosmic wavelength, whether or not he could tap into their lines of communication.

Kristen said, “I should have just washed the fucking pan.” She went into the garage.

Clark heard her car start, but he didn’t hear the garage door open, and she didn’t come back in.

Clark reflected on her final admission and an inexorable smile stretched against the endless expanse of his face. *I won*, he thought, and the mold bristled and bloomed in celebration.",1,1736393311.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Long time lurker first time posting. I have come to Reddit for some advice.

We are looking to get it replaced since it is winter and would like to use it while it is cold. We saw on FB a used lopi cape cod from 2015 for sale. Asking price is $1500. I did some research on this particular stove and saw that the early models had some cracking issues, not sure of the later models. Is this stove worth purchasing? Anything to look for? Is it a good price? It looks in pretty good shape but the owner did mention a crack on the bracket/lip Infront of the andirons that is cracked (ash fettle?) but also said it works 100% still. This stove will not be our primary source of heat. We just want to burn wood and admire the fire while drinking coffee or beer. If this is too much stove for what we want, what else is recommended.

Life gets noisy, and sometimes, it feels like there's no way to turn down the volume.

That's where meditation apps come in. Trust me, these little gems are like having a pocket-sized retreat you can whip out any time things get too chaotic. I used to think they were just another app cluttering my phone—boy, was I wrong!

**Here’s how they’ve helped me shift gears and boost my mindset:**

- **Simple Start, Big Impact**: Skeptical about meditation? Me too! I thought I didn't have time, so I started with just 5 minutes a day using an app. The trick is, it's not about clearing your mind completely; it's about learning to *notice* the noise and gently turning down the volume. Five minutes turned into a morning ritual that I now can't imagine starting my day without. 🌅

- **Guided = Gold**: Ever tried meditating to the soundtrack of your own internal monologue? Yeah, it doesn't work. Guided sessions saved me. Having a soothing voice guide you through a meditation is like your own personal concert conductor, waving their baton for calmness instead of chaos.

- **Variety Is the Spice of Zen**: Boredom is the enemy of habit-forming, so mix it up! Meditation apps offer everything from *calming rainstorms* to *mindful breathing sessions*. Feeling anxious? There's a session for that. Need motivation? Yup, there's one for that, too. It's like the Swiss Army knife of mental health.

**So, why meditate with an app?** 🤷‍♂️

- You get to practice anywhere. Yeah, that includes the grocery store line when someone decides to pay with a check. Patience level: expert.
  
- It aligns with busy schedules, promising more ""me time"" without needing to book a weekend retreat in the mountains.
  
- It's approachable for all stages. Whether you're a zen master or someone whose idea of calm is a TV marathon, it's got you covered.

**Feel the love (and the awkwardness)**: You'll find that these apps even encourage a little self-love. Yes, it's weird at first to be told ""you're enough"" by a voice on your phone, but why not get cozy with the uncomfortable? It feels pretty good after a while.

1hx3ckz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chipotle/comments/1hx3ckz/manager_is_lying_about_me_getting_fired/,Manager is lying about me getting fired?,"I’ve been working at chipotle for about 10 months now, the pay is pretty decent and the crew members are mostly chill. My only issue with the job is they are giving me too much hours and we are getting out way too late. Mostly concerned about our closing time.

We close at 11, and they want us out by 12. When I first started, I would get out at 2am which was REALLY bad, but (I’m holding myself accountable) I wasn’t utilizing my downtime enough, and I was taking unnecessary bathroom/phone breaks. Now, when I go into work, I don’t look at my phone AT ALL, not even to check the time. I strictly only take 2 bathroom breaks because it’s an 8-9 hour shift, and I never spend more than 5 minutes when using the restroom. Still, I get out at 1-1:15, but I’m seriously doing what I can, the problem is, I can’t clean and take care of customers at the same time. Whenever I try to pre-close or do some early cleaning, a customer walks in, by the time I’m finished with that customer, another walks in, then a family walks in, then it sometimes turns into a rush, they rarely schedule any short shifts, so it’s usually just me on the line, if we get a rush, the cashier or the manager will come help, but other than that, I’m just getting constant customers and no time to clean. 

Theres this one manager that keeps bickering to me about the time I get off, and it makes me wonder if she thinks I WANT to get off as late as I do. As a nursing student, you think I like getting off at 1am and waking up at 7 everyday? Again, I’m doing what I can, but it’s really frustrating when customers keep coming in. What frustrates me even more is that I’m not the only person who gets out at 1am, cashier will get off around 12:30-12:45, and the cook will get out at 1-1:30 (depending on the day), but this manager only makes these comments about late closing towards me. 

Last week, she walked up to me and said “Hey if you continue to get off at 1am everyday, GM is considering replacing you” I was shocked. They schedule me 35-40+ hours a week (that may be little to you guys, but for someone who’s in school, I shouldn’t be working that much. I signed up for a part-time job), so I’m basically there everyday, I don’t get to see my friends or family. My life is study, school, work. My sleep schedule is fucked, I rely on redbulls and coffee almost daily. Regardless, I show up to work everyday, I don’t complain, never disrespectful to anyone and I don’t call out. I don’t know why I’m putting in unnecessary effort for a job that doesn’t care about me, but whatever. Anyways, the manager CLAIMED that the GM told her he’s considering replacing me because I get out so late, and I believed it for a little before I started to think.. Why is the GM sending a manager to tell me that he wants to fire me? You’d think he’d call me into the office and have a private conversation with me or something like that, right? I decided to ask the other manager, and she told me I needed to have 3 write-ups before anyone considers firing me, I have 0!! Then I decided to talk to the apprentice, she told me she hasn’t heard anything about me being replaced, and kinda reassured me that everyone was getting out late because this is a busy location. Nobody is getting fired. I think it is completely inappropriate that a manager is telling me false information, information that she has no business with, and the apprentice agreed. She said she will talk to her about that. 

Yesterday, I walked into work and the manager asked me what time I closed the previous night, I told her, 1AM, and she said “GM is gonna fire you if you don’t speed it up” and I said “I talked to apprentice and she said nobody is firing anyone.” but this manager is still claiming that I’m about to get fired because I’m slow. 

Did her and the GM have a secret meeting about replacing me or something? She’s the only one claiming I’m about to lose my job. 

What do I do?

I want to talk to the GM and see what he says, but I think this whole situation is just so stupid. If you want to fire me, what are you waiting for?Hypothetically, let’s say the GM is actually planning on firing me, threatening my job isn’t going to fucking magically make me get out at 12. How stupid do these people think I am? If you are “considering” firing me, I might as well quit, right? Why would I just stand around waiting to be fired?????

I don’t want to quit, I like the money, I like my co-workers, I like the free food. The job can be a pain in the ass sometimes, but it’s nothing I can’t handle. At the same time, I want to quit and go find a new job. If you feel the need to walk up to me and make false claims, then I obviously don’t fit the chipotle expectations. I haven’t been able to get out at 12am and the manager makes me feel stupid because of it. Maybe this job isn’t for me after all.",2,1736392692.0,Chipotle,24,0.75,False

But what if I told you that you can get more done without losing your sanity or sacrificing your precious Netflix time?

**Here’s the deal: It’s all about working smarter, not harder.** And no, this isn’t a cheesy infomercial promise—it actually works. Trust me, I've been through the wringer trying to balance back-to-back meetings, inbox explosions, and remembering to feed the cat.

Here's what’s been helping me not just survive, but thrive:

1. **Prioritize Like a Pro**: Try starting your day by listing three non-negotiable tasks. These are the must-do items that’ll make everything else *feel* less critical. Run out of coffee? Not ideal, but hey, lower on the list than submitting that report. 😉

2. **The Pomodoro Technique**: Sounds like a pasta sauce, right? 🍝 Basically, it’s chunks of focused work (say 25 minutes) followed by a short break. Rinse and repeat. I swear by this little trick to keep my ""productivity tank"" from hitting empty.

3. **Master the Art of Saying ‘No’**: Seriously, how good does it feel to politely decline a meeting that could’ve been an email? It’s like a superpower. Use it wisely.

4. **Batch Similar Tasks Together**: Like emails or phone calls. It turns out our brains love this efficiency party. Less context switching means more brainpower for the important stuff. 💪

5. **Reflect and Adjust**: At the end of the week, peek in that rearview mirror and ask yourself a couple of simple questions: What went well? What could be improved? It’s like a tiny weekly therapy session for your brain.

So, are you ready to hop off that unicycle and give these a try? Would love to hear about your own aha moments! Maybe you’ve cracked the code I haven’t even thought of yet.

⬇️

I have a 1950s ear in kitchen that's very small. The n (think upside down u shape) kitchen layout does not work for me. I am not going to open it up into open concept. It's approximately 8x8 feet.

My idea because I need way more dilirsge and counters than I have is switch to smaller appliances and make the work space area a L(a upside down L) keeping the window and sink on the wall they are on but shifting it over with new cabinets and putting the fridge and stove along one wall. On the wall across is have uppers and lowers with counter space and storage and have a place to set the coffee maker toaster toaster oven and microwave and still have work prep surface while having a designated breakfast/snack prep area.

Small issue is even with changing to a 24 inch fridge and stove that only leaves roughly 16 or 18 inch of counter as landing zone between the fridge and stove for short term setting down items because I want to be able to use the space in the corner and will need a lazy Susan there. 

I'm not sure about the 16-18 inches because I'm not sure if a lazy Susan is small enough to allow more and I'm not sure how wide the counter will be (I want it able to accommodate WQ18 inch platters)l o. The shelves not the lazy Susan nit sure if the uppers or lowers. 

I'm considering the type of lazy Susan where the doors swing I. As the shelves come out a kidney I think they call it.

There will theoretically be space for a dishwasher on the sink wall but there's a small issue of a step that is possibly  a stair bulkhead in the corner and I don't know if it can be got rid of or if it will have to be worked around with regards to sink placement.

I may put a pass through window behind the table in the eat I. End if I can and am thinking of pushing that wall into the living room to widen it so tgeee can be storage there under the pass through as well (there is no pass through currently).

Does this sound feasible? Remember there will be counter space beside the sink and across from the fridge and stove wall. I will consult a kitchen designer but want thoughts on my idea first.

Please don't say go open concept and remember the u doesn't have enough storage space as is.

Thoughts?

Edit notes:

1)I need to shrink the window.

2)There are doorways beside the cupboards where the shot ends I am thinking of closing off the one in the fridge side because 3 feet out of shot is another doorway at the front door and am thinking remove the closet put one beside the pass thru if I do one instead and have the side stairs landing at the front door by simply removing the closet and having one a few feet over.

If you looked at them during their early days, you would've thought ""poor bastards"". After all, they grew up in a galaxy quite literally riddled with black holes. So many black holes that they have legends about the black spots of the sky and the ""white spot clusters"" that go back to 003 P.S (Pre-Space).

However, if you looked at them now, you'd wonder why the hell they aren't the biggest economic power instead of a humble two-galaxy civilization.  
Why?

Because, very early on, they learned how to capture and use Hawking Radiation (or as they call it, Maz) as an energy source.  
Of course, before they could do that, they had to design structures that could withstand the mass gravity situation of black holes, which they managed by way of utilizing the gravity itself somehow, it's confusing, but my point is, they have so much Hawking Radiation nowadays that they had to start selling it because their storage units were struggling to hold such amounts of Maz.

They also sell it for dirt cheap, because they don't know that Maz is an incredibly rare substance for other civilizations. Dirt cheap is 32.8 Nula, which translates into 104,000 USD. They really have to sell it, because otherwise their storage units could risk a Class 10AUD event. AUD is Assured Universal Destruction. The number means how fast it happens. 1 is within a couple thousand years. 5 is within a mere month. 10 is in an hour.

Their top buyers are the Prominence Etei and the Yi Tyn Imperius, both of which use Maz for experimental engines, while the Daishang Cluster uses it to power everything from coffee machines to their biggest freighters lmao",7,1736391694.0,worldbuilding,2,1.0,False

After all, it was the Vikings who first graced North America with their presence long before any other European power decided to stake a claim. 

Imagine this: Denmark, with its rich Viking heritage, decides it’s time to reclaim what was once theirs. The headlines would read, “Denmark to Reclaim America: The Return of the Vikings!” It’s a bold move, but perhaps necessary in a world where geopolitical boundaries are increasingly fluid and absurd.

If Denmark were to pursue this path, they could argue that it’s not just about reclaiming territory; it’s about restoring historical justice. Think of the cultural revival! Danish pastries could become the new staple at every American gathering, and “hygge” would replace “Netflix and chill” as the preferred way to unwind. 

But let’s not stop there. Canada and Mexico could be invited to join this newly enlarged Denmark, forming a Scandinavian superpower in North America. Picture a continent where everyone wears cozy sweaters, drinks glogg, and engages in spirited discussions about the merits of socialism over coffee. 

Of course, this scenario raises serious questions about sovereignty and identity. Would Americans welcome their new Danish overlords? Would they embrace the idea of a government that prioritizes social welfare over corporate interests? Or would they rise up in protest against what they perceive as an absurd land grab?

It all came together after destinys stream today. I had no idea Trump had threatened Zuckerberg until today. Which is INSANE. Why was that not number one news for at least a day. I feel like we were talking about the Twitter files for weeks.

Anyway look at the timing of when everything happened.

The backdrop. Biden had just SHAT HIMSELF HARD on the debate stage against Donald Trump his opponent for the presidential election. This happened June 27th 2024. The entire left is now following dear leader Biden and start collectively shitting themselves. But, unlike biden, the collective left werent shitting themselves because they are all old, though it could be a contributing factor for a lot of them, they were shitting themselves because they saw the Trump win coming. It was the pretty well understood that after that debate Trump had a HUGE advantage in the race.

Fast forward 13 days to July 9th 2024, not even two weeks after the shit show that was the debate, Trump comes out with the threat to Jail Zuckerbucks.

In the climate we were in at the time, Trump was riding high on his debate win, as far as anyone reading that tweet was concerned Zuckerberg had just been threatened with Prison by the future president of the united states.

August 26th Zuckefucks comes out with his statement about the government pressuring him to censor facebook.

He also states that he is going to stop donating money to ""Widen election access for voters""

[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/zuckerberg-says-the-white-house-pressured-facebook-to-censor-some-covid-19-content-during-the-pandemic](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/zuckerberg-says-the-white-house-pressured-facebook-to-censor-some-covid-19-content-during-the-pandemic)

Two days later August 28th Politico comes out with an article that has passages from Trumps book set to release in September

>“Save America,” a Trump-authored coffee table book being released Sept. 3, includes an undated photograph of Trump meeting with Zuckerberg in the White House. Under the photo, Trump writes that Zuckerberg “would come to the Oval Office to see me. He would bring his very nice wife to dinners, be as nice as anyone could be, while always plotting to install shameful Lock Boxes in a true PLOT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT,” Trump added, referring to a $420 million contribution Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, made during the 2020 election to fund election infrastructure.

>“He told me there was nobody like Trump on Facebook. But at the same time, and for whatever reason, steered it against me,” Trump continues. “We are watching him closely, and if he does anything illegal this time he will spend the rest of his life in prison — as will others who cheat in the 2024 Presidential Election.”

Is it a bit insane that, two days before Politico writes their article, Zuckerberg comes out with a statement that address both of the things that Trump was threatening to put him in jail for life over? Keep in mind Politico had to have had that book long enough for a Writer to read it and write that article on it.

I could only read the headline for that article. Im going to assume its true.

Now fast forward to January 7th Zuckerberg announces that he is changing his moderation to be more like Twitter, the social media site owned by trump dick suck Elon Musk.

This little pink cookie store was a huge part of my young adulthood. When I was 20 I was on my own. I didn't have the most money, or the healthiest eating habits. While at work, I lived on string cheese, jerky, nuts—and then I'd get off work, and every week I'd go to Crumbl and get 4 cookies of my choice. Supplemented with those, and lots of coffee, to get me through strenuous work shifts. Weighed like 110-115 lbs at 5'4"". The Crumbl employees started looking at me funny after a while. But I think these cookies kept my body alive for about a year.

Was NOT a healthy time of my life physically or mentally. I have since gotten a boyfriend who knows how to cook really well, and I learned how to bake. So these days I bake my own cookies, for far less than $7.00 a cookie. And I'm at a healthier weight, taking in lots more nutrients from my diet.

 However, I still have fond memories of Crumbl. And a few times this year, four-five years after I first tried Crumbl—I tried to go back and get a cookie. It's just...different. Like everything, it's more expensive than before. But I feel like the cookies are also...smaller? And they taste less good? Is it just me? Does my body just no longer need these calorie bombs, and so they no longer seem as magical as they once did? Or has Crumbl been a successful company long enough, that now they're going the way of many big corps...ceasing to care about quality?

I also find weird the fact that they're trying to make cheesecakes and cakes and other things. You are a cookie company, Crumbl. I wish they'd kept focusing on what they did best: cookies. And also I don't love the weird, off-the-wall flavors. Like nothing against Olivia Rodriguez, but I look at a cookie named ""Gutz,"" and I'm not chomping at the bit to eat it. I miss when they used to make just regular cookies, really well, with regular food-inspired flavors and names.

Or maybe I just miss being young, with more years ahead of me and more time left to be stupid. ",0,1736390965.0,CrumblCookies,5,0.44,False

Firstly, this is my first reddit post but I prefer crowd sourcing information. Therefore I am very cautious and am heavily censoring everything to put my mind at ease. I am from the United States in a Suburban/Rural area. I am unsure the best course of action to take from the point I'm at... essentially:

* Unweighted GPA of 3.54902
* SAT 1260
* Grade Twelve
*  AP Classes
   * AP English Language and Composition
      * 4
   * AP US History

   * AP Chemistry
      * Currently Enrolled
   * AP English Literature and Composition
      * Currently Enrolled
   * AP Statistics
      * Currently Enrolled
   * My school is small/medium so they do not offer many AP courses however I am trying to get the AP International Degree
      * I am trying to see if I am able to test out of the one class I am missing for it. Every other requirement I meet as long as I pass my tests this year. (I am aware this would not come in until much later though)
* A middle range amount of volunteer hours (I do not see it necessary to list them all here)
   * One was with a Youth Council, however, that is relatively notable
* Captain of the Robotics Team
   * For One Year
   * The program was dead two years ago (two members including me and no money)
      * I have revived it for the most part
* (There is a name for it which is unnecessary for this post) Special Needs Helper
   * I work a coffee shop that is ran by the Special Needs Students every week which also counts as service hours
   * I meet once a week to have lunch with/give them all someone to talk to who is not in their class
* Recommendations
   * I am confident I can get a recommendation letter from the majority of my teachers. Multiple are AP teachers and a few have high seated positions in the School System. 
   * I have been at my job for two years and am in a very high standing view of the owners and manager.
* External Things
   * I have been in person to Imperial College
      * I accompanied my dad on a business trip and sat in on his meeting. I met a professor and had a tour of the Hydrodynamics laboratory
   * I received an email from the Professor who is the head of the discipline I am aiming for
      * I have replied and am trying to begin a conversation.
* Anything else that puts me in a marketable position
   * I am trans mtf
      * I am lesbian
   * I have divorced parents (I think this one just helps monetarily)

  
I need suggestion on anything really, however, the most important things are:

* What routes did (whoever responds) take to get from the United States into Imperial
* How do my credits, scores, tests, &c. transfer over
* Are there things I can do to make myself more marketable e.g. Volunteer Work, Interviews with recruiters, &c.
* What sort of monthly budget am I looking at if I do get in.
* Should I start reaching out for the recommendations and collect all of them, or only ones from the most decorated individuals?
* Should I make a Portfolio or Resume similar to this post?
* Are there any things I can do to help with the cost?
   * My grandmother is British and I am getting dual citizenship through her to lower the cost.
* Are there any ""backways"" in. What I mean is:
   * My school counselor is from Ukraine. She attended a University here that she did not meet the requirements for. She, instead, opted for a different major that she was able to get into and then transferred once she met the requirements after some time.



Thank you to anyone that responds!

Hear me out. This is going to require some backstory as well sprinkled in. Maybe to the point of TMI... but I always have questions when reading these and trying to answer what I would ask as I go.

My husband (will call him Jack) ""lent"" money to a female ex coworker (will call her Susan). 

Everyone in this story are early 40s. We have been together 12yrs and have 2 kids together, I helped raise his 3, now, adult children (19-23yo) 2 of them still live with us. In a tragic house fire also lost my oldest son almost 7yrs ago when he was 8yo. In short we have been through a lot together.

My husband worked at this company for 13yrs and honestly was miserable (as were/are most of the employees). Susan started 2 or 3yrs ago and they would chat occasionally when he WFH she would send some 😘 occasionally, which took note but didn't think too much of it. He started working in the office again and I knew they were work friends. Nothing really beyond that. Now one day Susan complained and asked for help to my husband of $100. He messaged me and asked me about it. I have helped others in the past & we have gotten help when in need (like when my son died). I said 'sure that hope for her to pay back half but the other half a gift and give her $200'. There was a whole sob story of he lazy husband, broken car, and kids etc. I thought little of it and I am at a point that make good money with my own business, and worked hard to get there. Double what he was making at this place. Well, eventually new managment and changes made this place of employment unbearable and would tell him to quit and just door dash to supplement, or at least look and apply elsewhere. After realizing how much I made this last year and my business has only been growing. He decided to to quit after 13yrs I told him  I support him and mental well-being worth more than that place/paycheck. In his finial weeks he found out that Susan and other newer employees were making more only solidifying his decision. He has been door dashing because he still wants to contribute to the household which I appreciate immensely. Jack has now been out of work for about a month. Applying and interviewing to different places, no luck yet. Susan reached out once to gossip about another employee leaving. Outside of that crickets from her. Today Susan reached out with a mini sob story and asked for $50. He told me when I got home from dropping off the kids at school and picked up coffees for us. He was heading out to do some door dashing (after taking 5-6days off due to snow). I scoffed, and he said I am going to 'no' and followed up with thoughts similar to mine - he not working right now. She also makes more than he did, and has not paid anything back from the last time... He then left to dash, and I went inside to work thinking nothing more of it. 

Side note - not that we need it back or even really expected it. I dont think anyone should expect it back when you loan money to people. To me paying back is sign of character.  

Later this afternoon as I was getting off a call with a client when I got a notification from Life 360  ""Jack arrived at (insert terrible job's name)"" having older kids that don't drive we all have life 360 and alert on places that were common like home and places of employment. I messaged him 'why are you at ""terrible job""?' he said he changed his mind and was trying to do the ""Christian thing"" and help someone in need. I saw red. Yes we are Christian and I like to help those in need, but we already agreed no. I feel betrayed. 

He then started gaslighting me. All within 5-10mins he said things along the lines of - ""I'm gonna get shit for this cause I wanted to be a good person"" ""We've gotten help in the past"" ""I am not betraying you, we have $X amount in the bank"" ""If I can't spend $50, you need to get an ""ok"" with me to spend anything"" Now he is a narcissist, not trying to be accusational, 2 thearpist agreed on that diagnosis, and we almost broke up all together a few years ago because of it. He knows he is a narcissist. He has worked on it. I worked on not being a door mat. I let him know I will not be taking his gaslighting bullshit but because I stress and basically overthink everything. We are not hurting for money, it wasn't the fact of how much, but who was asking tbh. AITAH?

Also, according to all I know they are not friends. Just ex coworkers at this point. Idk why was she comfortable enough to ask to begin with... that alone annoys me.",4,1736390500.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False
1hx2k8f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hx2k8f,"Thursday, January 09, 2025 | Word of The Day ""Beyond Words"" - When Actions Speak Louder: The Unspoken Power of What We Do • [Click to Expand] ","## Beyond Words: How Our Actions Define Who We Are


Have you ever had someone promise to help you out but then not follow through? Or maybe you’ve experienced the opposite—someone who didn’t say much but showed up for you when you needed it most. These moments stick with us because they tap into something fundamental about human behavior: actions speak louder than words. 

It’s a phrase we hear often, but what does it really mean? And why is it so universally true? Let’s dive into the idea, unpacking its meaning, exploring its implications, and seeing how it plays out in our lives.

### The Disconnect Between Words and Actions  
We live in a world filled with words. Social media posts, promises, speeches, and casual conversations are part of our daily lives. Words are powerful—they can inspire revolutions, convey love, or spark understanding. But they’re also easy to manipulate. You can say anything, after all. Saying, “I care about the environment,” is far easier than consistently recycling, reducing waste, or taking public transportation. 

This is where actions come into play. Unlike words, actions are tangible. They’re visible proof of our intentions and values. When there’s a disconnect between what someone says and what they do, it’s the actions we tend to believe. Think of a politician who preaches equality but supports policies that widen the gap between rich and poor. Their actions expose their true priorities, undermining their words entirely.

### Why Actions Resonate More Deeply  
Actions have a unique way of cutting through noise. They tap into our primal instincts, showing rather than telling us what’s real. For example, imagine two friends: one constantly assures you they’ll be there for you but never follows through, while the other quietly shows up when you’re in need. Who would you trust more?  

This is because actions create trust—or break it. They build relationships and reputations. A kind gesture, like helping a stranger carry heavy bags, speaks volumes about your character. It’s not what you say about yourself but what you do that shapes how others see you. 

On a deeper level, actions resonate because they involve effort. Words require little energy—actions demand commitment. They reflect priorities. Choosing to spend your time volunteering at a shelter rather than binge-watching your favorite show reveals what truly matters to you. 

### Personal Anecdotes: Lessons From Real Life  
Let me share a story. A few years ago, I worked with someone who always talked about being a team player. He had the jargon down: collaboration, synergy, mutual support—you name it. But when deadlines approached, he was nowhere to be found. Another colleague, though, rarely spoke about teamwork but consistently stayed late to help finish projects. Guess who everyone respected more?  

This experience taught me that people might forget your words, but they’ll remember how you made them feel. That colleague who quietly helped out earned the team’s trust—not because of what he said, but because of what he did.

Another example comes from my own family. Growing up, my parents emphasized the importance of kindness. They didn’t just say, “Be kind.” They showed it. I remember my dad mowing an elderly neighbor’s lawn every summer without expecting anything in return. That quiet act of kindness left a lasting impression on me, far more than any lecture ever could.

### Actions as a Measure of Integrity  
Integrity is a word we often associate with honesty and moral uprightness. But at its core, integrity is about consistency—aligning your actions with your words. When there’s a gap between the two, trust erodes. 

Take relationships as an example. If your partner says they love you but doesn’t prioritize spending time with you or supporting you, those words start to feel empty. Love isn’t just expressed in declarations—it’s demonstrated through care, patience, and effort.  

Similarly, in leadership, integrity is everything. Great leaders don’t just talk about their vision—they embody it. Think of someone like Mahatma Gandhi. He didn’t just preach nonviolence; he lived it, even in the face of immense personal suffering. His actions gave his words power and credibility, making him a global symbol of peace.

### The Ripple Effect of Actions  
What’s fascinating about actions is their ripple effect. One small deed can inspire others, creating a chain reaction of positive behavior. Consider the concept of “paying it forward.” If someone shows you unexpected kindness—like paying for your coffee—you’re more likely to pass that kindness on to someone else.  

I experienced this once during a particularly tough week. A stranger let me cut in line at the grocery store because I was in a rush. It was such a small act, but it shifted my mood entirely. That day, I found myself being extra patient and kind to everyone I encountered. Actions, no matter how small, have the power to multiply.

### When Words Do Matter  
This isn’t to say that words are meaningless. Words can clarify, inspire, and connect. A heartfelt apology can mend a broken relationship, and a genuine “I’m proud of you” can lift someone’s spirits. But even here, actions matter. Words are most powerful when backed by consistent behavior.  

For example, if a parent praises their child’s talents but never shows up for their games or recitals, those words lose weight. However, combine encouragement with presence, and the impact is profound. It’s the combination of words and actions that creates a meaningful connection.

### How to Align Words and Actions  
So, how do we ensure our actions speak louder than our words? It starts with self-awareness. Ask yourself: Do my actions reflect my values? Am I following through on my commitments?  

Here’s a simple practice: whenever you make a promise, write it down. Treat it as a contract with yourself. Whether it’s calling a friend, sticking to a fitness goal, or volunteering your time, seeing it in writing helps hold you accountable.  

Another tip is to start small. Grand gestures are great, but consistent small actions often have a bigger impact. Smiling at a stranger, holding the door open, or sending a “thinking of you” text are all ways to show kindness without overextending yourself.

### Closing Thoughts  
At the end of the day, actions are the truest expression of who we are. They reveal our priorities, shape our relationships, and leave a legacy. Words might echo for a moment, but actions create lasting change.  

So next time you find yourself making a promise or expressing a belief, pause. Ask yourself: what can I *do* to back this up? Because while words can build bridges, it’s our actions that carry us across them.

Months after working there, we started to understand each other, even if we don't agree we learned to meet eye to eye and even started having fun while bickering, and it sort of became a highlight to my weeks. I honestly learned a lot from him, having such different views, and I think so did him: we learned to found middle ground and became actual friends, who did have a lot of other interests in common. I never liked him romantically, and honestly not that much physically, but he was hilarious and we did have chemistry.

Any job I have becomes my life, I started working very young and always strived to be taken seriously, so I used to always do more and care too much. This is NOT a good thing, because most times it lead to me overworking myself and making mistakes. Hand to hand with this, because I put so much time in the job, it becomes my life emotionally as well, and it lead me to form VERY strong relationships VERY fast. Now: this isn't always bad. To this day, I have friends very dear to me who I met working and it's absolutely fine, but when this was happening, after I had just started working at this place (I was 20 years old) I went all in. I made a very strong friendship with two colleagues that then came crushing down (they got mad at each other because of unrelated issue, and I ended up being left behind) and I slept with another coworker who was in a relationship at the time (completely my bad, inexcusable). These two things, EVERYBODY found out, and the second one mostly it was embarrasing.

So, 6 months after I started working there, all of this had happened and I wanted to turn on a new leaf. This new girl starts working (25F) ""Kiara"" and we get along fine. Honestly, I hadn't learnt my goddamn lesson yet, because we speedran a friendship. Less than a month of knowing each other, we got along like a house on fire. And not only in our job, but we went out together, had dinners, made plans. I went with her to apartment's showings (even lend her money to move to her new place), I rambled to her for hours about my family problems, she did too about hers. We have a deep, strong friendship outside and in spite of our job. For the months we were friends, she truly became my person.

But, about a month after she started working, Kiara broke up with her boyfriend and immediately started a sexual relationship with Gave. This was unexpected, as she had never mentioned being interested in the guy, but I was glad she was taking her mind off the hard break up. The things with Kiara, she keeps things very close to her chest. She rather lie, both to other and to herself, before daring to lose something. So when I asked her if she liked Gave as something more, and she laughed and said no, I believed it.

Now it seems obvious that there was something there, but the two of us had know each other for such little time. And the time I felt I understood her completely, but I clearly did not.

At this point, I've been working here for about an year, so I've known Gave for a year, and Kiara for five months, roughly. And I knew I was attracted to both of them. Now, since they had been sort of friends with benefits since they had met, I had very much decided to NEVER act on any wish, because it would have been crossing a line. Even if Kiara and gave weren't together, I wouldn't get involve with him to respect her, and I loved her as a friend too much to risk it for a horny moment.

That's until, for some reason, they both thought it would be a good idea to invite me for a threesome. This is something that they talked about together, just the two of them, for a while before deciding ""yeah, let's bring this up to her"" as a collectively agreed upon idea.

Kiara first mentioned it to me as a passing comment during a call we where having. She said ""ooh and the other day Gave said it would be hot if the three of us had a threesome hahah!"" and I just hahaed back and pretended I hadn't heard it.

Then a second time, about a week after, she told me ""oh and I never told you about that conversation with Gave about the threesome hahah!"" and again I played fool.

Because the truth is, I had thought about it. Me and Gave, again, we had chemisty. And I had always find Kiara stunning, but I valued the friendships I had with them a lot, and because they were already friends with benefits, I just thought: this will never happen.

But then, Kiara mentined it a third time. She told me, first laughing, how her and Gave had been talking about how fun a threesome could be, and when thinking with who, they thought me. She was half joking, half serious, and I could have answered leaning on the joking part, but I said ""don't offer me a fun time!"".

This leads to a serious to god plan. Kiara mediated the whole thing, and she even admitted being the one making the plans turned her on. Me and Gave were pretending nothing was happening and wouldn't even talk about it together, but we talked about it with her and she told us what the other was saying.

Kiara and I even ""tested out"" our chemisty by making out one day, and then after a week, finally me and Gave talked about it and made out too. First red flag here.

You gotta understand, most of these things happened while, during and/or at our job. We have the freedom of taking some free time and walking around the neighborhood, so we have moments where we could go off, and this is when me and Gave kissed. But when he invited me to walkd around the block (I truly didn't know it would end up with us kissing) I didn't tell Kiara beforehand. I told her after it happened, and she got COMPLETELY insecure and mad/sad because she didn't like not knowning.

Now, in hindsight, this is when I say ""oh, there's something more complex here and maybe a threesome is not a great idea"". But I asked her if she was sure everything was okay, and when she said yes I chose to believe her easily. She said that she wasn't sure how she would feel about the threesome during it, even if she wanted it, and was scare to disappoint us, but I said she could always put a stop to it.

So, we pick a date. The day comes, I go to Kiara's house, then we both head to Gave's. We start off talking, drinking some wine, then things happen. It's great, really, the three of us just fell completely into it, had an amazing time, chemistry off the charts.

It was so, so good in fact, that both Gave and me thought ""this is a things now"". Kiara had seem to have an amazing time as well, even said so, and the whole things was hilarious, fun and hot.

Then next morning, we all went together to work (yes, we don't share weekends) and it all fell apart. Immediately Kiara got weird, she made an excuse to avoid us for a couple of hours, and druing the afternoon she took me and Gave to a part of the office where no one could hear us, and told us that the threesome was nice, but that it ""woke in her unrelated feelings that tinted her experience"", like her grandpa dying. Now, it's true that her grandfather had died a couple of months back, and a couple of weeks after this was happening she was traveling to see her family for the first time after this, so OF COURSE it was bringing a bunch of hard and painful feelings.

But it felt weird that it was coming to her during a threesome. Gave was completely in shocked, and almost pissed off because he had also felt the whole things was great, and then suddenly it wasn't, and he just knew there was something she wasn't telling us.

After work, me and Kiara talked, and she told me she had feelings for Gave, and that she couldn't share him, even when she wasn't willing to admit her feeling for him. Thing us: Gave is not a bad guy, but he chooses not to see, and thinks his limits are an excuse for being a bitch, sometimes. He only slept with Kiara when he wanted to, and would give her the cold shoulder at the office so no one would suspect. He is a very private person, and from moment one he had told her he wanted nothing serious, and always described their relationship to her as ""friends who sometimes fuck"". She's not the type to have that sort of relationship, but she stayed because it was better than not having him (her words).

So she tells me ""I know he's not mine, and I told him it was completely okay if he wanted to keep sleeping with you, but you have to know it would hurt me a lot if you did, and because it's not fair to ask you two to never have sex again, then I can't be with you either"".

Which was fine by me. I was shocked, yes, and sad because I did want to be with them again, but she was my best friend. I could put it all behind.

What happened, is that she wasn't doing okay. And she wouldn't talk about it with me, of course, because I was a part of this experience, but she talked about it with another coworker of us (29F) Lisa. I couldn't hear them, but I saw them. Our 9 hour shift, I saw them talking about this very personal experience of mine, and of course I don't blame Kiara for needing to talking about it (even though the three of us had decided to keep it secret, specially from the office). And we are there for so many hours, where else will she talked about it? But honestly is was maddening.

I felt trapped. Like I couldn't walk away, I had to stay at my desk and do my job while seeing just a couple of feet away from me my best friend (who was barely talking to me and pretending nothing had happened, while also looking depressed) and Lisa talking about a sexual experience I had been a part of for HOURS. I'm embarrassed to say how much this affected me.

There where other things going on in my life at this point, and this just took me over the edge. I looked distraught, really, it was clear that I was going through something, and that Kiara was going through something. Put two and two together and all our coworkers just knew something had happened between the two of us, and it all led to both of us saying hurtful things.

I said one horrible thing. Now, me and Kiara again where best friends before this, we knew a lot of personal things about each other and would often make jokes about it. She would joke about the issues I had with my parents, I joked about her ex. But of course, at that point things weren't great between us, it wasn't a moment to be joking about anything. But one afternoon we were all playing a Mortal Combat together at our office (it was a very slow day), and to fire her her up to beat her opponent in the game, I said ""Imagine the other fighter is your ex, who walked past you!""

That was a bitch comment. I was wrong to say that, and the worst part is, I didn't even notice. I was trying to make everything good between us, to go back to how we were, but that comment made her very, very mad. To the point she left home early, and the next day she invited me to have coffee.

This is when she said she had wanted to knock me down after I had said that, literally, because of how mad it made her. I apologized profusely, and said the truth, that I hand't even realized what I was saying and that I would never want to hurt her. I also said that her and Lisa talking about the threesome right in front of me had me going mad as well, that I feel trapped at our job, and she said textually ""I did notice it hurt you, but I really needed to talk about it, so I couldn't care about it, I'm sorry"".

It was a nice conversation, we both cried and said how much we valued our friendship. We really just came clean about everything and both said we wanted to work through everything.

So it was a shock when the next day, she starting being cold. She would be super nice one second, and then ignore me the next. She got all tense when me and Gave barely even talked, and again we all work together, and me and Gave had gotten along great before all this.

Actually, Gave had invited me to his home twice after the threesome, but I'd say no, because Kiara had told me she didn't want it, while she had told him that it was alright.

After some weeks of this, Lisa came to me. The two of us always got along very well, but I hadn't want to talk to her about this whole things because she had become Kiara's safe space. But Lisa came and quite literally told me: ""Kiara doesn't trust you, she's even asking me to pay attention to you and Gave to see if you are closer, she is desperate to know you two aren't sleeping together anymore, and ther's nothing you can do for her to trust you. You need to wait until she cools off.""

And this was my turning point. I cannot explain how much I adored Kiara. She was my person, my closest friend. But I clearly wasn't to her. I felt that she had sort of used me, not voluntarily, but she was afraid Gave was bored of her, and accept and insisted on the threesome so she could keep him. I felt like just means to an end. It's fine, it's her choice to pick him over our friendship, and I can respect it even if it hurts. But then, I wasn't going to keep choosing her either.

So me and Gave started sleeping together. Bad, bad decision. It went on for a couple of months. He said he wanted to talk to Kiara to say he didn't want the two of them sleeping together anymore because everything had become too complicated.

But then he started treating me as he had treated her, which is to say not at all like a gentleman. Now, because I didn't like him romantically, it was different for me. I knew that he could call me 11PM to go to his house, make some fuss for a while, and then had to go back to my home even if it was 2AM. I understood that's how it went, and for a while I was okay with it.

During those months, I didn't know much about Kiara. I know she started seeing someone else, then broke it off, she had some issues at her apartment, started therapy, barely that. My and Gave also didn't talk about her, and barely about anything at all.

The whole thing with him was steamy messages, then quick fucking, then me back to my house past midnight. We had some awkward moments, and without discussing it, we just stopped sleeping together. Honestly, it stopped being worth the while for me.

Which brings us to the present. I've tried to be the adult. Truth is, being near Kiara still breaks my heart. I miss her, I resent her for not choosing our friendship, I'm embarres for having done something she said she didn't want me to do, also pissed off at myself for still caring so much about her wellbeing when she didn't care about mine. But we work together, so I push it all to the back.

I am a good colleague. I'm a good coworker to both her and Gave (who basically ignores me every shift, and I ignore him back now). The thing that broke my heart the longest, was having lost the friendship I had with both, especially Kiara. But I remain civil.

Until now. I'm pretty sure they are back to sleeping together, maybe even in an actual relationship, and I'm pissed off. Jealous, even. I mean, I lost everything: my best friend, my good, the place I felt comfortable. I am never at ease when Kiara is around me. I'm so hurt by everything I've been looking for a new job, but nothing pays well and I can't just quit. I still feel so trapped, so alone, and now it seems like the two of them are back as if nothing had ever happened, maybe even better than ever!

I had made peace with everything falling apart between the three of us, but them two being alright? It super toxic of me, I know. And I feel like I'm going backwards with all the growth and the mature way I tried going about things.

Is it immature to want them to be unhappy as well? How much do I suck? I made many mistakes during this whole thing, but I wasn't the only one, right?",0,1736390377.0,relationship_advice,4,0.25,False

As more of us adopt an active, on-the-go lifestyle, it’s essential to make choices that are both convenient and in harmony with the environment. At Allwear, we believe in creating fashion that’s versatile, durable, and sustainably crafted to meet the demands of busy lives while caring for the planet. 

Whether you’re commuting, exercising, or simply enjoying life on the move, here’s how you can stay eco-friendly without sacrificing comfort or style.

# Why Choose Organic and Natural?

When it comes to sustainable living, the materials we wear matter. Conventional fabrics are often made from synthetic fibers that not only take centuries to degrade but also involve chemical processes harmful to both our health and the environment. Organic and natural fabrics, on the other hand, are crafted from materials that are biodegradable and free from toxic pesticides or dyes.

Here at Allwear, we design our clothing using organic and natural fibers that are not only good for the planet but are also lightweight, breathable, and perfect for your on-the-go needs.

# Essential Organic Clothing for Life on the Move

Living sustainably doesn’t mean sacrificing function or style, and our core products reflect this balance perfectly:

**Allwear Organic 5"" Sweat Shorts:** Made from organic cotton, these shorts are the ideal choice for an active lifestyle. Their breathable, soft fabric keeps you comfortable whether you’re running errands, hitting the gym, or lounging at home. Plus, organic cotton is cultivated without synthetic fertilizers or harmful pesticides, ensuring that your skin is free from irritation and that your choices are kind to the environment.

**Allwear Organic Half-Zip Hoodie:** A perfect companion for those brisk morning runs or casual meetups, this hoodie is crafted from organic cotton, blending style and sustainability seamlessly. Its versatility makes it an easy pick for any occasion, and its organic composition means you can stay warm and cozy without exposing your body to harmful chemicals commonly found in synthetic fabrics.

**Allwear Bamboo Bra Top 2.0:** Designed for comfort and mobility, this bra top uses bamboo fibers—a natural and highly renewable resource. Bamboo fabric is soft, moisture-wicking, and anti-bacterial, making it an ideal material for activewear. Whether you’re headed to a yoga class or just running around town, this top is as supportive as it is eco-friendly.

# Sustainable Fashion for the Modern Nomad

An on-the-go lifestyle calls for clothing that’s as adaptable as you are. At Allwear, we believe that less is more, which is why our garments are designed to be multifunctional, offering the versatility you need to move through life with ease. 

Our collection of organic essentials can easily transition from workout gear to everyday fashion, ensuring you have fewer pieces with more use. This not only simplifies your wardrobe but also helps reduce consumption, one of the key pillars of sustainable living.

# Packing Light, Living Green

Sustainable living isn’t just about what you wear—it’s also about how you live. When you’re constantly on the move, adopting sustainable habits like packing light and choosing multi-functional products can significantly reduce your environmental footprint.

Here are a few tips to incorporate into your on-the-go routine:

**Opt for Reusables:** Whether it’s a water bottle, shopping bag, or coffee cup, bringing reusable items with you on your travels is an easy way to cut down on single-use plastics.

**Mindful Packing:** Streamline your packing by investing in versatile clothing like the Allwear Organic Half-Zip Hoodie and Bamboo Bra Top 2.0, which can serve multiple purposes—saving you space while keeping your wardrobe sustainable.

**Natural Fabrics for Active Days:** Organic cotton and bamboo are excellent choices for active days, as they are naturally breathable and moisture-wicking, keeping you cool and dry no matter what your schedule demands.

# The Future of Sustainable, On-the-Go Living

At Allwear, our mission is to make sustainability a part of everyday life, even for those constantly on the move. We believe that every small choice, from the clothes you wear to the items you pack, contributes to a larger impact. With thoughtfully crafted pieces like the Allwear Organic 5"" Sweat Shorts, Organic Half-Zip Hoodies, and \*\*Bamboo Bra Top 2.0 , we’re committed to helping you live a life that’s both sustainable and stylish.

By embracing organic, natural materials and making mindful choices, you can stay connected to the earth—even when your life is fast-paced. The beauty of sustainable living is that it doesn’t have to slow you down. In fact, it makes your life lighter, simpler, and more in tune with the planet.",1,1736390301.0,allwearcom,0,1.0,False

I did my first injection last evening around 945 pm and went to bed about 45 minutes later.  I didn’t notice anything different right after the injection. I woke up at 5 and felt a little off, but not bad. Sluggish is probably the best way to describe it.  I usually get up at 5 to workout. This time, I could only muster up the energy to walk a mile and a half. What’s wild, though, is I had no desire for my morning coffee.  My morning coffee has been a diehard ritual for at least 8 years and it is one I look forward to very much. There have been long stretches of my life where having that cup of coffee alone in the morning was the only thing I looked forward to, so it’s a strong habit with deep roots in the dopamine forest. I didn’t drink my morning cup, nor did I have my typical second cup when I got to the office. Crazy.

I was so tired, though, that I actually sprawled out in the floor with the cats in front of the fireplace and took a 20 minute nap before I left for work. I had half of an Oikos Pro yogurt cup around 830. The exhaustion persisted throughout the morning and then the nausea hit.  It. Was. ROUGH. I ended up leaving work for a nap in my car for an hour around 12:15. I was finally able to entertain the idea of food again around 230, when I had a cup of strawberries, some mini carrots, and grilled chicken and mixed greens in a Mission Carb Balance tortilla. I was completely full and the nausea went away.  I had no cravings for my little mini chocolate afterward. 

I usually work out after work (yes, I workout twice a day), but I wasn’t sure if I had the energy to pull it off. I went anyway and settled for a medium paced one mile walk and ten minutes of yoga instead of strength training. There was just no gas in the tank. 

Dinner was homemade chicken pot pie, of which I had a modest serving. I was definitely in control of my portions and my appetite, with no post-dinner sweet cravings to contend with. 

So now it’s 9pm and I am very, very tired and can’t wait to go to sleep! I haven’t eaten enough calories today but I am hopeful that I can do better tomorrow. There’s no way I could choke down a protein shake right now, though I really want to for the extra hit of protein.

I just wanted to share this for anyone who is looking for information about that first day, as I was very curious before I began. I started with the lowest dose from Hallendale via LSH and I injected in the stomach this first time.  FWIW, I totally bent the needle on my first poke but in the end, I barely felt a thing. 

As of last evening, I was 162.2 and my goal weight is 140. I am perimenopausal and have had problems with weight settling in my midsection lately, though initially HRT did help me get some weight off. I am a very active person and love lifting weights, but I just couldn’t get any movement on this new excess fat and my cholesterol was getting high so I decided to just go for it.  Insurance doesn’t cover it, so I’m hoping that it will remain available to me via LSH for so long as I might need it.",4,1736390006.0,SemaglutideCompound,1,0.83,False

I’ve been living in Korea for around 4 years and I noticed that I’m getting lonelier as the years go by. Most of the friends that I’ve made, Korean and foreigners left. And I really mean most of them. I only have a handful who live between here and their home countries so it’s hard to reach them. I often contact my friends but I’d rather see them. 

Up until two years ago, I was very social. I barely stayed at home. Even when I was dating my husband, I was always out doing something somewhere. I was in a lot of group chats and always had someone to talk to and hang out with. Eventually everything stopped.

I just want to find friends. Preferably other women around my age. Single or in relationships I don’t really care. I love my husband a lot but I feel like my brain is rotting by only being around men all the time. I want to go out for brunch, coffee, drinks and shopping. I want to find people who I can talk to about anything. I feel like I lost myself a little and even my in laws have noticed it. It feels weird being felt sorry for not having any friends. 

I yearn for a sense of community. I tried looking around last year by asking several group chats that I was in. I asked to join in any events or parties they were advertising. The problem was, my profile picture on KakaoTalk at the time was a picture of my husband. A lot of the women in the group chat thought I was some random dude trying to infiltrate. I tried to explain and had people who knew me in person back me up but I had to leave. Since then I’ve been avoiding people. That quick judgement scared me off. Now I’m trying to get back out there but I don’t know where to start.

Digestively, today was . . . kind of a lot. If that makes sense. I didn't go yesterday, and when I went today . . . yeah.

Here's what I ate!

Breakfast: orange juice + coconut water, coffee and nutpods, Greenfield's bacon, two scrambled eggs, a quarter of an avocado, some frozen berries

Lunch: a mix of leftover hamburger + vegetable soup and leftover pot roast and potatoes

Snack: orange juice + coconut water + seltzer + lime, mango and apple slices, leftover scrambled egg.

Supper: shrimp crusted with egg white, unsweetened coconut, lime zest / dressing of cilantro, homemade mayo, lime juice, hot sauce, salt, avocado blended up together / slaw of red cabbage, cilantro, red onion, mango, some dressing / bit of guac (the rest of the family ate it as tacos, i just ate it separately) - THIS WAS SO GOOD

Per vet recommendation they needed to lose weight for long term health and to prevent joint issues. We didn’t really measure their food before but it is definitely less than half of what they were getting. 

It’s been about a week now and our dogs are constantly circling the food bowl, begging for our food, and whining. They are very clearly hungry after their vet recommended portions. My lab mix girl has always been slightly food aggressive but she has been out of control lately. 

The mix dog is 85 lbs and the vet said she needs to be 75 lbs. I don’t remember the exact weight on our golden retriever but he also needed to lose about 10 pounds, maybe a little more. 

Last night the Golden Retriever stole onion rings my wife set on the coffee table while she was eating them on and off. Tonight the lab mix stole food when we walked away for two seconds to deal with our toddler. Then she got very aggressive when we walked back into the room and caught her doing it. 

I tried googling info on this but all I got was articles about why is your dog not eating. My question is, what do I do? Will the hunger and aggression fade for them or will it continue to get worse? Should I take them back to their old portion and make smaller changes to the portions over time instead of doing it all at once? I don’t want to ignore the vet’s advice but I don’t want my dogs to be miserable. I also don’t want my wife or kid to get bit by our dog that is becoming extremely food aggressive.

* Are cheap thrills killing the essence of FinDom?
* Do you think these *Coffee Tribute Dommes* and their broke subs understand the power exchange, or are they just here to play pretend?

Hear me out. This is going to require some backstory as well sprinkled in. 

My husband (will call him Jack) ""lent"" money to a female ex coworker (will call her Susan). 

Everyone in this story are early 40s. We have been together 12yrs and have 2 kids together, I helped raise his 3, now, adult children (19-23yo) 2 of them still live with us. In a tragic house fire also lost my oldest son almost 7yrs ago when he was 8yo. In short we have been through a lot together.

My husband worked at this company for 13yrs and honestly was miserable (as were/are most of the employees). Susan started 2 or 3yrs ago and they would chat occasionally when he WFH she would send some 😘 occasionally, which took note but didn't think too much of it. He started working in the office again and I knew they were work friends. Nothing really beyond that. Now one day Susan complained and asked for help from my husband of $100. He messaged me and asked me about it. I have helped others in the past & we have gotten help when in need (like when my son died). I said 'sure and HOPE for her to pay back half but the other half a gift and give her $200'. Susan had a whole sob story of her lazy husband, broken car, and kids etc. Not to belittle her issues, it just didn't matter to me, I dont know her. I thought little of it and I am at a point that make good money with my own business and worked hard to get where I am. Double what he was making at this place. Well eventually new managment and changes made this place of employment unbearable and would tell him to quit and just door dash to supplement, or at least look and apply elsewhere. After realizing how much I made this last year and my business has only been growing. He decided to to quit after 13yrs I told him  I support him and mental well-being worth more than that place/paycheck. In his finial weeks he found out that Susan and other newer employees were making more only solidifying his decision. He has been door dashing because he still wants to contribute to the household which I appreciate immensely. 

Jack has now been out of work for about a month. Applying and interviewing to different places, no luck yet. Susan reached out once to gossip about another employee leaving. Outside of that crickets from her. Today Susan reached out with a mini sob story and asked for $50. He told me when I got home from dropping off the kids at school and picked up coffees for us. He was about to head out to do some door dashing (after taking 5-6days off due to snow). I scoffed, and he said I am going to say 'no' and followed up with thoughts similar to mine - he not working right now. She also makes more than he did, and has not paid anything back from the last time... (the audacity... I hear Charlotte in my head saying ""How are you not embarrassed!"")
He then left to dash, and I went inside to work thinking nothing more of it. 

Side note - We do not that we need it back, or even really expected it. I dont think anyone should expect it back when you loan money to people. To me paying back is sign of character.  

Later this afternoon as I was getting off a call with a client when I got a notification from Life 360  ""Jack arrived at (insert terrible job's name)"" having older kids that don't drive we all have life 360 and alert on places that were common like home and places of employment. I messaged him 'why are you at ""terrible job""?' he said he changed his mind and was trying to do the ""Christian thing"" and help someone in need. I saw red. Yes we are Christian and I like to help those in need, but we already agreed no. I feel betrayed. 

He then started gaslighting me. All within 5-10mins he said things along the lines of - ""I'm gonna get shit for this cause I wanted to be a good person"" ""We've gotten help in the past"" ""I am not betraying you, we have $X amount in the bank"" ""If I can't spend $50, you need to get an ""ok"" with me to spend anything"" Now he is a narcissist, not trying to be accusational, 2 thearpist agreed on that diagnosis, and we almost broke up all together a few years ago because of it. He knows he is a narcissist. He has worked on it. I worked on not being a door mat. I let him know I will not be taking his gaslighting bullshit, but because I stress and basically overthink everything. We are not hurting for money, it wasn't the fact of how much, but who was asking. AITAH?

Also, according to all I know they are not friends. Just ex coworkers at this point. Idk why was she comfortable enough to ask to begin with... that alone annoys me.",9,1736388939.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,5,1.0,False

I spent today at the aquarium with my parents, and yesterday I went to every coffee shop within an hour radius of my hometown. (8 total).

I’ve curated a loose daily routine, and although the cold is very rough for me, I have spent awhile sitting on a bench beside the pond on our land, shielded from the winters strong wind gusts. It’s allowed me to get some sunshine for the first time since summer.
