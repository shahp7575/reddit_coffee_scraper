Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

This may sound like a stupid question here, but do you guys really get stimulated by energy drinks? They seemingly all have Taurine and it seems to ENTIRELY cancel out the effect of the caffeine in my experience.

Warning to those interested in using Taurine after reading this: Be careful! It's easy to take too much and it WILL make your heart race, which is ironic when it chills me out so much. It interacts with how the heart uses calcium.

I had posted a while ago about my experience with the London AS diet, so here comes a story about my latest crusade: the carnivore diet.

Disclaimer. This is purely my own experience with the diet. This is not medical advice. I am not a doctor, I am not a nutritionist, please don't come after me. This is an extreme diet, and even trying it out might not be suitable for you. OK, back to the story.

I recently broke up with my girlfriend, and as social activity was coming down with the new year starting, I figured it was time to give it a go. Armed with internet knowledge about how the diet cures arthritis and inflammation, as well as the benefits of fasting/ketosis, I embarked on a 30 day journey of eating only steak, in one meal a day. The only things I consumed were: beef, salt, butter, olive oil, coffee (black), tea, and water (incl sparkling).

A benefit of OMAD is that you don't have to worry about the other meals. Buying just steak as lunch is pretty much impossible (and expensive), while cooking is a hassle. Also, OMAD gives you a great excuse to hide the diet from your colleagues/ social circle if other people's perception concerns you.

Before I discuss the AS-related symptoms, here are the overall positives and negatives:

Positives:

1. Weight loss. I was at a caloric deficit, fasting for 23 hours a day (with salt, electrolytes are very important), so I guess not surprised. Lost 16 pounds in 30 days. Yes, I know a lot of it was water, but I definitely shed some fat too.
2. Insane mental clarity. I felt incredibly sharp. I made so much progress on my personal projects since I didn't eat lunch and I was not sleepy after dinner. (By the way, if you live in New York or are visiting, check out newyorkcurated.com. it's a city guide and a buddy are putting together. still building it, so any feedback is welcome)

Negatives:

1. Going to the bathroom. Basically diarrhea the entire time. Tried changing the fat to protein ratio, couldn't figured it out. I just accepted it. Tea kinda helped I think, because I was only going once every 3 days towards the end. Your body just absorbs so much of it, and without fiber, there's very little to get rid of.
2. The social aspect. You come off as a madman (which is fair, and perhaps you are for trying this).
3. Not the same pump when lifting. Cardio felt fine, but I wasn't feeling 100% when lifting. Perhaps this is because I worked out after fasting for 22 hours or so. Unsure.

Surprises:

1. No hunger. I was not that hungry. Nowhere near I expected to be.
2. Low sex drive. I just wasn't feeling that sexual. Masturbated way less.

OK, now it's time to talk about it's effect on AS.

I am generally fine, I've done 2 MRIs (initial diagnosis and follow up) and they showed that most of the inflammation was gone, but I do feel stiffness in my lower back occasionally. It's like, there, kind of, more apparent some times than others. Which also makes it hard to test the effect of things (like a diet) because I'm overall pretty healthy (üôèüèº)

Time for the punchline: It worked. The stiffness was gone. The morning of day 5 I woke up and I realized arching my back didn't give me the same feeling. By day 20 my back felt incredibly well.

After the 30 days, I went back on eating regularly, 2 meals a day plus a snack, no restrictions. And the stiffness came back.

So the question is: what now?

The diet is incredibly restrictive, not fun at all, makes going to the bathroom very messy, and it makes me look like a internet weirdo, or flat out a psychopath. But at the same time... It works...?

I guess my biggest realization with this is that even though it works, I won't follow it. It's just too much. I'm sorry if this comes from a place of health privilege but... I rather feel a little stiff and have fun. I tried something and it was successful; but I guess in the grand scheme of things, also, meaningless?

Nevertheless, I think in general, long term, I will fast more and eat less starchy things.

Let me know your thoughts!

We matched just a few days before and messaged back and forth during the day. Neither of us responded immediately, but we were consistent. Things got a bit flirty, but all PG rated. 

We met up for coffee after work and had a really nice time. He greeted me with a handshake, which felt a little formal, but the rest of the date was relaxed. Lots of eye contact, both of us leaning across the table towards each other, and an easy flowing conversation. He asked for a second date at the end and I said yes. We swapped numbers and went our separate ways. I was disappointed he didn‚Äôt offer a hug at the end, but assumed he might be shy with touch. 

He left the next day for a week long road trip, so I didn‚Äôt expect constant communication. A few days into his trip, I texted to check in. He has been texting me once every 1-2 days since. He‚Äôs been back since Sunday now, and the texting hasn‚Äôt picked up in pace. I didn‚Äôt want to push scheduling another date while he‚Äôs adjusting back, so I‚Äôve been waiting on his lead. 

It felt like he was putting low effort into texting me. I intentionally didn‚Äôt ask him a follow-up question in my last text to him on Tuesday. He hadn‚Äôt included one in a few of his texts, and I was curious if he would keep pushing things forward. He hasn‚Äôt responded since. 

What is happening here? Is it possible he‚Äôs still recovering from his trip, or is he just not that interested? Do I cut my losses or send another text? If I do reach out, do I wait for him to ask about another date or ask for one myself?",1,1739504906.0,dating,6,1.0,False

 I am hoping by fasting to gain clarification on specific parts of something I feel called by God to do, it's a big huge giant life altering thing and I need His direction and am not getting it, so I'm fasting and praying.

I told God on Wednesday afternoon I wouldn't eat or drink anything but water until I take the Lords Supper, which I do after sundown Sabbath, so Saturday around 6pm. 

My problem is I normally drink about 1/2 gallon of black coffee every morning, and im about 30 hours into my fast and my head is pounding from caffeine withdrawal, I have a terrible headache, and don't know if i can make it, I am a stay at home dad and have to watch two toddlers and an 8 year old all day and it's near impossible like this. I probably made a mistake and should have dedicated only food to my fast, not drink, so that I could drink a cup to stop the headache.

I really super duper don't want to break my fast, I'm not even hungry, so far it's been easy if it weren't for the headache! I'm thinking about drinking a cup of coffee and seeing if that fixes it, but I'm gonna be so disappointed in myself! 

I don't think God will punish me for breaking my fasting, but I still think it's really bad since I told him I would keep it a specific time. I feel like I'm not going to get the direction I need if I break it.

1ip1n8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ip1n8q/hm_big_glass/,[HM] Big Glass,"The sunlight peaks around the edges of the heavy hotel room curtain, introducing dull illumination to the room. Bob Davis can feel the cool air on his whole body as he sits on the edge of the bed, the AC unit under the window rattling to keep the room a crisp 65 degrees, just as Bob Davis likes it. The room with one queen bed has the smell of hotel room freshness but has been diluted by lived-in room scents since Bob checked-in 16 days ago. The room has a mini-fridge (unstocked) and a coffee maker. Everything that a man like Bob could need in a three-star accommodation. Bob approaches the room‚Äôs coffee maker to realize that he is out of coffee pods and will be unable to wake himself up and fill his room with the scent of weak coffee before venturing out of his room for the day. It is 2PM and despite the ‚ÄòDo Not Disturb‚Äô sign on Bob‚Äôs doorknob, Bob has still been obligated to respond to the daily knocks of housekeeping at around 10AM and 11AM, with hungover, incoherently muttered ‚Äòya‚Äôs and ‚Äòhere‚Äôs; the answer they are looking for never having been established, just as when someone knocks on the door of an occupied bathroom. The inconvenient timing of room service‚Äôs visits are the reason that the room‚Äôs trashcan is overflowing with fast-food packaging, and that Bob is now going to shower with towels that have not been changed in over a week.¬†



Following his shower, Bob makes his way down the hotel‚Äôs bar and grill, where at this time he has missed the continental breakfast, but has fortunately avoided sharing the odd feeling of collective violation when the majority of hotel patrons emerge into common spaces in the morning, shortly after, perhaps only minutes after rising from sleep.¬†



Bob is eating his Belgian waffle and signalling to the middle-aged waitress for more coffee, while his phone rings through to Craig Brecken, the company owner. Craig picks up, as Bob is sitting comfortably with his legs spread with one hand resting on the back of his head.



‚ÄúBrecks, how‚Äôs the weather up there?‚Äù Bob asks.

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not as nice as sunny Miami,‚Äù Craig responds.

‚ÄúAh, you wouldn‚Äôt like it here.‚Äù

Craig laughs obligingly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure I wouldn‚Äôt. How are things coming? Starting to think you might never leave that DoubleTree,‚Äù Craig says somewhat playfully but also wondering whether their newly acquired star salesman would ever pay another visit to their HQ location in Ohio.

‚ÄúBrecks, I‚Äôm doing you guys a favour by staying in this place. Hardly wanna show my face here. A guy like me? I usually stay at the Ritz or the Marriott when I‚Äôm down here. Listen. I‚Äôm closing on those leads pal. Just gonna need a bit more time.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo worries.Take it easy on those comped dinners and alcohol. And bottle service? Accounting is starting to ask some questions.‚Äù

‚ÄúGotta grease these guys up. But we‚Äôll be closing soon. Don‚Äôt you worry.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot worried at all. You‚Äôre the man BD.‚Äù

Bob has a wide grin on his face.

‚ÄúSo, what ya‚Äô calling for BD?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh right, do you have Apple TV?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure,‚Äù Craig pauses, ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing to watch on TV here. If you could help me out Brecks. Guy like me, away from home, I‚Äôve watched nearly all the shows out there.‚Äù

Craig opens his Notes app on his phone, ‚Äúlet me just check here. Ok I‚Äôll give you my password. You ready?‚Äù

‚ÄúYep.‚Äù

‚ÄúPassword is ‚ÄòID8MOMS!‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say anything. Thanks Brecks. I‚Äôll talk to ya‚Äô later.‚Äù



Bob Davis‚Äôs and Craig Breckens relationship began at the Westgate Resort in Myrtle Beach. Bob had had himself a night with his friends at the hotel bar, and Craig had gotten away from his wife and three children for the evening. Craig was watching an NFL game at the bar top when Bob decided to make conversation with the lonely looking Craig Breckens. They got to talking.



‚ÄúSo, Craig, what do you do?‚Äù Bob asked.

‚ÄúWindows. Family company. We sell residential windows up in Ohio,‚Äù Craig replies.

‚ÄúWindows! That‚Äôs fantastic. You wouldn‚Äôt believe, Gordon Bunshaft, second skyscraper in NYC with a glass curtain wall. That‚Äôs my grandfather.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo shit! The Lever House?‚Äù Craig asks.

‚ÄúThe Lever House,‚Äù Bob confirms, smiling humbly as he takes a swig of his Corona.¬†

‚ÄúWow, an icon. And what do you do, Bob?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I used to sell glass panels for my family business. Riding on the coattails of old Gordy.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, Davis Glass?‚Äù Craig asks.

‚ÄúYep. That‚Äôs us. ‚ÄòTurn your building in-side-out, with Davis Glass‚Äô‚Äù, Bob says the jingle of his family business embarrassingly.

‚ÄúDamn, that‚Äôs so good. Family of glass huh,‚Äù Craig says.

‚ÄúYep. What‚Äôs your jingle?‚Äù Bob asks.

‚Äú‚ÄôIt ain‚Äôt broken glass, if it‚Äôs Brecken glass.‚Äô‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNot bad.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt ain‚Äôt no Davis Glass.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks. Half the glass buildings up in Toronto. That‚Äôs our glass. I sold most of that glass. Can nearly see through the whole fuckin‚Äô city because of me,‚Äù Bob says.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a hell of a lot of glass.‚Äù

‚ÄúOver $100 million in sales. Sold to the Toronto Zoo for their gorilla exhibit, too,‚Äù Bob says.

‚ÄúFuck me,‚Äù Craig says, thrusting his back against his bar stool and widening his eyes, ‚Äúand so what are you doing now?‚Äù Craig asks.

‚ÄúNot much, honestly. Had a falling out with the old man. Wasn‚Äôt getting the cut I thought I should be, to be honest. Not looking for any family handouts or anything. Just thought I deserved more.‚Äù

‚ÄúGod, I wish I could get my glass on some of those buildings,‚Äù Craig says.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you?‚Äù Bob asks.

‚ÄúMy brother, Barry. He‚Äôs the oldest of the bunch, and was handed the reins to the company from my father. They‚Äôve been dead set on residential windows. Always have and always will be,‚Äù Craig answers.

‚ÄúWell shit, that ain‚Äôt no way to be,‚Äù Bob responds.

‚ÄúHey BD, you cunt! Having another business meeting?‚Äù one of the drunk men from the group Bob had originated calls out.

‚ÄúSorry, gotta get back to the wolfpack. Here, take my number, we‚Äôll talk,‚Äù Bob says, putting his hand out for Craig‚Äôs phone.



It was true, Bob Davis had grown up in a life of glass, but unbeknownst to most, also of fraud. Innocently enough, Bob grew up cleaning the home windows of kind neighbours. But given the right opportunity, he would scam some of those neighbours into believing that their current windows were leaking cold air into the Massachusetts summer heat. He would know, he was an heir to Davis Glass. He would schedule a time when the neighbours would not be home to install their new, more energy efficient windows, for a reasonable charge, he could assure. But, in the end, little Bob Davis would just clean the windows, as originally commissioned, and either the innocent neighbours would believe the clean windows to be new ones, or Bobbie would preach that these state-of-the-art windows were so advanced, that you could hardly tell they were new at all.¬†



Bob Davis had taken to fraud just like his grandfather Gordon Bunshaft, and Bob‚Äôs father after him. Gordon Bunshaft was an astounding architect, and had begun designing buildings with the most noble intentions. He had ushered in an era of glass curtain walls on skyscrapers. But upon realizing that such designs were appealing to the pockets of big glass companies, he colluded with them, and began pushing these glass-heavy designs to developers, preaching the importance of natural light, and in turn getting a cut of the glass sales from the multitude of deals that were made. This scheme made Bunshaft very rich, and following the marriage of his daughter, Anna Bunshaft, to businessman Gary Davis, Bunshaft decided to cut Gary in on the scheme. Gary would begin a big glass business that would provide the glass for Gordon‚Äôs designs. This turned Davis Glass into the empire it is today, covering hundreds of skyscrapers worldwide. A family of glass.¬†



Craig returns drunkenly to his hotel room, stumbling in the dark as his wife lies in one queen bed, his three children in the other. His backside falls on his wife‚Äôs arm as he sits on the bed to take off his shoes.

‚ÄúBabe, babe,‚Äù Craig says, nudging his wife excitedly, hoping to tell her the news of his latest encounter.

‚ÄúBabe, are you drunk? Get in bed,‚Äù his wife says.

‚ÄúBabe‚Ä¶I met a guy.‚Äù

‚ÄúA guy? Uh huh.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, a guy.‚Äù

‚ÄúI heard ya‚Äô.‚Äù

‚ÄúA guy that does glass.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh huh.‚Äù

‚ÄúDavis Glass.‚Äù

Hearing this, his wife props herself up on her elbow, looking at Craig sleepy-eyed, but finally attending to the conversation, ‚Äú‚Äòturn your building in-side-out, with Davis Glass‚Äô. That Davis Glass?‚Äù his wife asks.

‚ÄúThat Davis Glass. Bob Davis. The son of the owner. He could come work for us. Big buildings,‚Äù Craig says, sliding off his golf shorts.

‚ÄúWould Barry be O.K. with that?‚Äù

Barry is Craig‚Äôs older brother, who has whole-heartedly maintained that the future of Brecken Glass will remain in residential glass, which Craig has for a long time opposed, but has been unable to challenge.

‚ÄúFuck it. It‚Äôs Bob Davis, how could we say no?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd why is he leaving Davis Glass?‚Äù

‚ÄúHad a falling out with his father. It‚Äôs gonna be great, honey,‚Äù Craig says, as he wriggles under the tightly tucked bed covers, laying his head on the pillow and closing his eyes with a wide smile on his face, ‚Äúit‚Äôs gonna be great.‚Äù¬†



Craig and Bob continue talking via text. Bob presents Craig with the idea that he could scale up and get his glass on those big buildings. And Bob could be his man. He would just want a fairer cut than he was getting with his family. And that Craig promised, they shook on it, electronically, happy as pigs in shit. Craig would have Bob up to his Ohio factory to give Bob the rundown of the Brecken operation.

What Bob did not tell Craig was that the falling out with his father, Gary, was the result of Bob selling off market Chinese glass under the name Davis Glass, and had sold it off of the books of Davis Glass, trying to claim all of the profit for himself. Only his father caught wind of this upon looking into the development of two glass buildings in Toronto, digging into Bob as to why their, Davis Glass, had not secured the deal for those buildings. When Gary learned from developers that in fact the building had secured a deal with Davis Glass, yet no inventory from Davis Glass had been moved, Bob owned up to his father about the scheme. From that point on, Bob was to take a break from Davis Glass, while his father worked to prevent any word of the scheme getting out. This off market glass remains clinging to the sides of two of the Toronto buildings, and for the sake of the Davis Glass empire, they pray none of it will fall.¬†



It may seem that this meeting with Craig Brecken was too good to be true for Bob Davis, an ultimate strike of luck at this moment in his life. It may seem that this meeting may be another part of his fraudulent ways. But, the meeting of these two men of glass was in fact an honest one, but, like the neighbours he used to scam, Bob Davis knew how to pounce on an opportunity when it arose.



Following Bob‚Äôs visit to Ohio, he provided Craig with a blueprint on how to scale up the operations to provide big glass for big buildings. Bob would start marketing Brecken Glass in Miami, a booming market for development which Davis Glass had not already infiltrated, where he would try to secure deals.



Bob‚Äôs phone rings on the iron deck table, accompanied by ambient music playing softly from the speakers tucked into the rock garden surrounding the pool deck‚Äôs perimeter. Bob‚Äôs underside is still slightly damp following his most recent dip into the DoubleTree‚Äôs outdoor pool, which has rehydrated the sunscreen lathered on his skin. The scent of his and others sunscreen wafts in the warm afternoon air, as Bob lies on the vinyl strapped deck chair. He takes the inaugural sip from his second Corona, before he pulls his hat over his eyes, picks up his cellphone from the deck table, and answers the call from Craig



‚ÄúBrecky. Breakfast. How we doing?‚Äù Bob says.

‚ÄúDoing good. Things are coming along up here. Just checkin‚Äô in on ya‚Äô,‚Äù Craig responds.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm closing on those two developments we talked about. One for the new art gallery. The other for the condo going up in the design district.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fantastic. Barry‚Äôs willing to take a shot at this. But before we go any further with the factory expansions, he just wants to be sure that we‚Äôre gonna‚Äô have a deal. I mean, I know we‚Äôre good, but‚Ä¶‚Äù Craig says.

‚ÄúJesus, big brother‚Äôs got ya‚Äô worrying up there ,huh. Craig, I could sell a goddamn window to a blind family in an underground bunker. Y‚Äôall ain‚Äôt gotta‚Äô worry.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI know. I know, BD. It's just, it‚Äôs been six weeks, and Barry is threatening to shut it all down if we don‚Äôt see anything. Wondering if we need to send any support for ya‚Äô down there.‚Äù

‚ÄúJesus, Brecks. Don‚Äôt insult me. You guys gotta‚Äô trust me. These things take time. I‚Äôm right there Brecks. I‚Äôll be closing in no time. But, if Barry needs something to show for it, I‚Äôll take care of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you will, BD,‚Äù Craig says, softly.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll get you an invoice in the next day or two.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great. And hey, BD.‚Äù

‚ÄúYa Brecks.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust, the Apple TV rentals.‚Äù

‚ÄúCraig, we went over this. Ain‚Äôt nothing else for me to watch. I‚Äôm all alone down here.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll good BD. Just lastly, this, ‚ÄòGreenlife Inc.‚Äô that came up on the company card?‚Äù

‚ÄúPersonal trainer. And masseuse. She‚Äôs great.‚Äù

‚ÄúBarry‚Äôs just been wondering if these sorts of expenses are necessary.‚Äù

‚ÄúBrecks, I don‚Äôt have any company benefits. You want me to waste away down here? You think it‚Äôs easy living at the DoubleTree for six weeks?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course not, BD. You take care of yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúI should really be taking it up with you the fact that the corporate credit card limit is only 20K. We should really get that up to 50K or 100K if we‚Äôre really tryna‚Äô do business. Show some real faith in me, Brecks.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll take it up with the team right away. You take it easy, BD.‚Äù



The next day, Bob‚Äôs Greenlife Inc. personal trainer, the self-employed Sasha, is demonstrating leg kickbacks on the cable machine when Bob‚Äôs phone bings text notifications from Craig for texts that are typed in all-caps, demanding to speak immediately. Craig puts his phone to his ear and lifts a finger to Sasha to excuse himself as he takes the call in the hotel gym, rolling his eyes.



‚ÄúHey Craig,‚Äù Bob answers.

‚ÄúA twenty five thousand dollar rolex?!‚Äù are the first words from Craig‚Äôs mouth.

Bob had headed straight for the Rolex boutique in the Miami design district as soon as the Brecken Glass corporate credit card limit had been increased.

‚ÄúWe needed a Rolex to close the deal for these guys down here, Craig. That‚Äôs how these things work. Gotta‚Äô lube them up,‚Äù Bob replies.

Immediately following the purchase of the Rolex, Bob had gone straight to a pawn shop just outside of the design district and pawned the watch for fifteen thousand dollars.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a lot of money, BD.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have a deal Brecks, I promise,‚Äù Bob says in an unconcerned tone, as he looks out of the full height gym windows. He is bathed in the cool air from the overly conditioned gym.

‚ÄúWe need to know we have a deal, or we‚Äôre pulling the plug.‚Äù

‚ÄúListen, Brecks, as soon as I'm done in the gym here, I‚Äôm going to finish up the paperwork, and you‚Äôll have twenty thousand transferred. The down payment for the first order of glass for the art gallery.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk BD, I‚Äôll talk to you later.‚Äù



Upon bringing the supposed good news to Barry, Craig is immediately informed that he has been scammed. In a state of shock and denial, Craig is provided by Barry more synonyms to help settle his denial: conned, schemed, ripped off.

‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù Craig asks.

‚ÄúStratagemmed, finessed, grifted, hustled, bunkoed.‚Äù

Craig throws his head in his hands in despair, on the brink of crying.

‚ÄúSwindled, flimflammed, gaffled, bamboozled.‚Äù

Craig‚Äôs future with Brecken Glass would be extremely limited following this incident. No more expansion exploits, no more fantasizing over big buildings. Brecken Glass would stay residential. Always has and always will.



Bob Davis is seated next to a fellow guest at the Miami DoubleTree‚Äôs poolside tiki bar. The palm trees are swaying in the gentle warm breeze, as children do handstands and spike a beach ball back and forth in the pool behind.

‚ÄúConcrete. That‚Äôs a hell of a business. Especially around here,‚Äù Bob says.

‚ÄúIt sure is,‚Äù the guest says somewhat reservedly.

‚ÄúCasey Bechtel,‚Äù Bob says, ‚Äúnice to meet you.‚Äù

The guest turns his upper body in a bit of surprise, ‚Äúany relation to the Bechtel Corporation? Hoover Dam?‚Äù the guest asks.

I was a few minutes early and had found a nice table in the far corner near a small fireplace 
She arrived half hour later and looked like she‚Äôd had to physically drag herself out of bed. 
I didn‚Äôt think she‚Äôd show up, and from the ghostly expression on her face it was evident she hadn‚Äôt expected me to either. 

She wore track pants and an oversized jumper, with a hood she refused to put down. I wore jeans and t-shirt, a neon pink beanie on my head drawing attention.  
She looked at me with a panicked expression, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre sticking out‚Äù she said ‚Äúplease take it off‚Äù 
I told her to stay true to her heart and express  herself to the fullest extent. She frowned. 

She looked at me puzzled when i ordered a caramel latte and cinnamon swirl, when she only ordered a hot chocolate because the thought of coffee makes her stomach turn she had said. I smirked, just wait until college my girl. 
I asked her what she expected me to be doing right now and she told me she hoped it was something to help perpetrators of crime better themselves. 
I smiled knowing I‚Äôm studying forensic psychology to better understand why crime happens in order to prevent it. 

She asked me if i had a better relationship with my mum and i told her that we had to stick with it for a while but that mum wasn‚Äôt the problem, it was actually us all along.  
She called me a liar and told me I‚Äôm just like everyone else 
I looked at her and explained that she didn‚Äôt realise it at the moment because we had lost sight of ourselves completely. 
She asked me if we found our way back 
I almost cried because if she could walk in the shoes I'm walking in now she‚Äôd see that we‚Äôd already made it.

Everyone else dreams of a white picket fence, my dream is waking up to cows mooing outside my window, being able to walk for miles and it just be green and warm and beautiful.  
She‚Äôd see that we no longer lived in fear like we did in London  
But rather that we live able to find love in every destination. 

I tell her to keep pushing and that it will get harder before it gets better, I knew she hadn‚Äôt seen the worst of it yet but that she was strong enough to endure it. 
I give her a hug and tell her that she‚Äôll be okay. 
I tell her I noticed she didn‚Äôt have a sip of her drink and she tells me that nobody notices but then she laughs noticing id finished my cinnamon swirl and left no crumbs. 

It was at that point that she realised we were free from the torment. 

I hope we meet again soon.

After the first roast using a classic hot-and-quick profile, I smelled some scents I wasn't expecting and thought I might have an undrinkable roast. It actually turned out pretty well, but I had to do some research and see how differently Sumatra is roasted-  
That brought me to Sweet Maria's where I read this [(LINK)](https://library.sweetmarias.com/indonesian-fundamentals-approaches-to-roasting-indonesian-coffees-and-a-look-at-rustic-sweetness/) and gave me a game plan for the next roast (using one of Behmor's preset profiles), which is what is pictured above.

Overall, I think this second roast shines as a classic Sumatra. The first one may have been underdeveloped but it tasted fine to me.

Your investment choices aren't too different! Let's crack the code on when to pick actively managed funds and when to stick with passive ones.

# Largecap: Why Passive Investing Wins

Here's a surprising truth - ***Most active largecap funds consistently underperform the Nifty 50***. Why?

Think of it like the Indian cricket team - it's already got the **Rohits** and **Kohlis**. How do you build a better team than that? here's why beating the Nifty 50 is tough::

* The Nifty 50 already includes India's best-performing companies
* These companies are **extensively researched** and mostly **efficiently priced**
* The risk of any single stock crashing is lower due to their **established nature**
* **Active Funds** face **higher costs** and fees, eating into potential returns

**Verdict:**¬†Stick to¬†**Nifty 50/100 ETFs or Index Funds**. Keep it simple, cheap, and let market efficiency do the work.

# The Midcap & Smallcap: Where Active Funds are Better Choice

But here's where it gets interesting! In the mid and small-cap space, skilled fund managers are like **expert treasure hunters in an unexplored territory**.

Why do active funds work better in terms of ***risk-adjusted return*** (no worries, will cover risks and risk-adjusted returns in future posts) here?

* Many **hidden gems** are waiting to be discovered
* Many companies fly under the radar of major research firms, means more **pricing inefficiencies**
* Fund managers can **dodge troubled companies** (indices can‚Äôt)
* During market **turbulence**, they can shift to **cash** or quality stocks
* Mid/Small-cap indices often include stocks that have fallen from higher market caps, which might be **value traps**

**Verdict:**¬†Go for¬†**carefully researched active funds**. Leverage professional expertise to navigate this wild space.

# The Best of Both Worlds üéØ

Here‚Äôs your winning strategy:

* **For Largecaps:**¬†Nifty 50/100 ETFs or Index Funds. Keep it simple and cost-effective.
* **For Mid & Smallcaps:**¬†Actively managed funds. Let the pros hunt for hidden gems.

Are these enough for your equity portfolio? Not really, stay tuned for our final post on equity portfolio in the coming week - *üì¢ Stop Guessing! Here‚Äôs the Best Way to Allocate Your Equity Investments*

# Final Thought

Just like you wouldn‚Äôt overcomplicate ordering a cappuccino, don‚Äôt overcomplicate your largecap investments. But for mid and smallcaps, having an experienced guide can make all the difference.

I spoke to her about it and she ranted on and on about not using incorrect words as I guess the ap graders are picky but that is right? I said something like ""the rate of change isn't increasing over the interval (t1, t2)"" but she wanted ""does not increase""?????

 also I remember one time, like a month ago, she refused to grade my classmate's test because the handwriting wasn't ""good enough"" even tho me, an English learner, could read and understand it, and she gave him a 50%. that is entirely unfair!! and also last week this guy turned in a quiz first and she accused him of cheating and poured her coffee over his paper and made him redo it. like what the hell? this is not normal?

so many people have complained about her to the office and my school's principal but we are so underfunded that the fact that they offer an ap math class is ""rare"". they won't do anything!! also so many times she will complain about grading homework because she rarely gets 8+ hours of sleep at night, BUT SHE ASSIGNS THE HW!! and I've talked to one of my online friends who is also taking ap pre-calc and her class is easy and they barely have hw and a high average grade for the class. my teacher goes out of her way to assign hw and she grades our homework like a test so there's no 'easy"" points. and if she suspects we used like photo math it's an automatic zero. not even with proof, if she suspects.

I don't know what to do and there are very few people who got an A in her class last semester, I am one of them, but she divorced over winter break and it has been terrible!!! oh and she constantly overshares about her life! like this is math im sorry I do not care. and after the election, she LEFT our class for a week and din't come back because she was so mad and upset. I get you don't like trump but seriously?? we had a pe teacher sub for us and he is as smart as a brick so I really struggled during unit 2.

she has really gotten worse and I don't know how to get an A in her class again. last semester, I got a 90.5%. the majority of the people I know passed with Cs and Bs, and there is a really smart boy who got a 93% last semester. he also ended Physics C and AP chem with a 97% and a 98% which shows how smart he is!!

please help me with like literally any advice. also English isn't my first language so im sorry if I made any mistakes. what do I do?? she's the only ap pre-calc teacher for our school!! and if I want to change teachers I have to go to regular pre-calc and I really don't want to because math is the subject I'm best at. you don't need English as much.

1ip1fbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/InterdimensionalNHI/comments/1ip1fbi/golden_light_beings/,Golden light beings,"Hello all. Does anyone have any experience with humanoid beings of golden light? I had an experience during a meditation regimen, focused on daily chakra meditation for cleansing and wholeness of the energy center system, augmented by mudras, mantras, and separately leading guided meditation practice with a group weekly, and herbs that tonify and nourish the brain and nervous system. 

After approximately 2 months of this practice, I was meditating outdoors and had a clear and foreign urge to ‚Äúask for a companion to teach me‚Äù. I asked for such out loud and had a feeling that something had happened. The evening after next, I went outside with my friend while he smoked a cigarette near sunset. This is in the low mountains east of Knoxville, TN for background. As soon as I sat down on a tractor tire, a disc shaped ufo swooped over a hill and directly over us, before swooping back. Its path was almost an ellipse, seemed to be flying very low, and was transparent from the bottom up, with red and green trapezoidal light panels around it. From the top it was not transparent and had yellow lights around a nipple shaped bump in the center of it. It looked like shiny reflective metal. Completely silent. 

The whole event probably took 10 seconds. Long enough to stare in shock and short enough to not react until we realized it was gone. We both asked each other if we‚Äôd seen the same thing. I was in awe and excited but my friend was very troubled. We went back inside and I wanted to talk about it but my friend was scared. He finally admitted again that he had seen it and his description matched mine but after that night, he would never acknowledge it again.  

That night, I felt anxious and on edge. I felt that something was going to happen but I didn‚Äôt know what. As I lay in bed, I had a sudden impression of a *presence*. It puzzled me and I tried to explain it away and I started to see this golden light on the bed covers. I was sweating with anxiety and anticipation and kept trying to convince myself nothing was really happening until I looked up and saw at the doorway, an entity that looked like it either entirely emanating soft gold light, or it was illuminated from behind so strongly that I couldn‚Äôt make out details.

Something about it was otherworldly, like it wasn‚Äôt really there but it was also the most real thing in the room. I literally pulled the covers over my head and wished for it not to be there because I was so freaked out. I could still see the golden light through the sheets and when I looked up again. It was still there but then it ‚Äúleft‚Äù. 

My friend came home and found me in my room with the lights on. We talked for a bit and I did not breach the subject of what I just experienced. I mentioned that I wanted to go upstairs to get a snack I left in the freezer. My friend said that he saw someone else throw it away and suddenly I felt the presence again, directly behind my right shoulder. It made my arm break out it goosebumps as if it were almost touching me. It whispered ‚ÄúLies‚Äù in a voice that sounded in my headand showed me a vision of my friend eating my magnum chocolate bar I had been saving. 

I freaked out and told my friend everything and he looked at me like he was scared. He said he ate my bar and didn‚Äôt want to tell me because he didn‚Äôt want me to be mad. 

When it spoke to me, with the accompanying vision, I had the distinct impression that it was showing me how it could help me. But it didn‚Äôt feel right. It scared me. Like letting a hulking mysterious stranger in your home because he said you can trust him. I started praying and envisioning myself enveloped in a sphere of light. The light of love emanating from the creator. As I started, the presence turned angry and started giving me strange urges, like to sexually gratify myself and to be violent with my roommate. 

I left the house and ended up in a coffee shop. I prayed for hours, reading holy texts, aligning myself with the creator as my knowledge permitted and I could still feel the anger and presence. I stumbled upon a website with words of Christ, for the purpose of exorcism. When I started reading out loud. I felt an angry rushing power surrounding me, until suddenly giving up like it had lost interest and vanishing. When I was praying, an old woman came in the shop and sat opposite me, with a terrifying grin on her face. I got a horrible intuition that she was a witch, aligned with malefic entities. When the presence vanished, she looked disgruntled and left. She didn‚Äôt buy anything and came and left with nothing.

Sorry for the enormous post. This has been on my mind for a while. This happened about 10 years ago and I haven‚Äôt discussed it publicly like this before.

i‚Äôve been brewing kombucha in my garage for the past year after getting into fermentation through my roommate‚Äôs sourdough obsession. it turned into a genuine hobby, and i got pretty good at it.



last month, i got an interesting bag of dried mushrooms at a small asian grocery store. the owner said they were some kind of traditional medicinal mushroom‚Äîhe even showed me a package with chinese characters i couldn‚Äôt read, but there were pictures of mushrooms that looked kind of blue-ish. i‚Äôd been reading about mushroom coffee and tea trending on tiktok, so i figured i‚Äôd try adding some to my kombucha for extra health benefits.



i made a test batch by adding the mushrooms to my already-brewed kombucha. the first taste test with my roommate went great‚Äîkind of earthy with a weird but pleasant tingling sensation on the tongue. since i had plenty of kombucha brewing and a lot of mushrooms, there was enough to share.



a few days later, my roommate‚Äôs girlfriend asked if they could host her yoga session at our place since their usual studio was being renovated. i figured it‚Äôd be nice to offer some refreshments, so i put out some fruit and my kombucha. eight people showed up, and everyone had some before the session.



what followed was the most intense yoga session i‚Äôve ever witnessed. people were crying tears of joy, hugging each other, and saying they could feel everyone‚Äôs energy. the class never actually ended‚Äîit turned into an incredible bonding session that went on for hours. even the neighbor‚Äôs cat showed up and just sat in the middle of the group while everyone talked about their deepest feelings and connections to the universe.



now it‚Äôs become a weekly thing. the original yoga group keeps coming back, and they‚Äôve brought others. last sunday we had twenty people in the backyard. someone even brought a drum. the neighbor‚Äôs cat always shows up and sits in the middle, and everyone‚Äôs convinced she‚Äôs some kind of spirit guide.



i still can‚Äôt recreate that original batch‚Äîthe mushrooms were a one-time find. kind of relieved about that since things are already pretty intense.



tl;dr: added some mystery mushrooms to my kombucha, served it at a yoga session, and now my backyard hosts a weekly spiritual gathering.",3,1739503579.0,tifu,5,0.58,False

3-day ice storm ravaged the rural power lines. Been out of power for 14 hours at ~32F (~0¬∞C) with increasingly windy weather, and with the earliest projected power restore in ~1 day. Used V2L to preserve food in a full-size refrigerator/freezer, for a toaster and coffee maker, and some LED lights in the evening, and used a gas fireplace to keep reasonably warm. After finding out that V2L can output up to 30 Amps (3.6kW, I presume at 120V AC), added TV and PS5 and connected it online via smartphone tether. Hosted a game (TMI:  Sniper Elite 4 a.k.a. SE4, IMO the best Sniper Elite of them all üòú) and played with 3 buddies over 2k miles apart. Together, we beat the Marina level in ~1 hour (useful data in the unlikely event you also happen to be an SE4 fan). Completely forgot that we lost power. Then, I shut it all off except for the fridge, and after 14+ hours of all that, ended up using only 8% of battery (48% left, down from 56%). At this rate, I should still have up to 4 days which will hopefully be enough until the power is restored.

tl;dr: Apart from the ICCUgate, EV6 continues to impress.",12,1739503305.0,KiaEV6,2,0.93,False

After the discard, her entire friend group turned against me. We don‚Äôt go out in public together and generally keep our ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù private. I‚Äôve made it clear to her on numerous occasions that I don‚Äôt feel comfortable yet telling other people we‚Äôve been seeing each other. She agrees.

Last week, my friends and I ran into her at a coffee shop. We walked past each other and I did not acknowledge her. 

At the coffee shop, my friends interpreted her looking at me in disgust. I agreed with them and went along with the lie that we aren‚Äôt on good terms. Had the typical exes can be crazy sometimes amirite conversation and moved on. 

About an hour later, she texts me and says that I am an asshole. She says that her friend overheard my entire conversation in the coffee shop. She told me to go fuck myself. 

She‚Äôs been ignoring me ever since. I haven‚Äôt reached out obviously. 

I don‚Äôt understand how I am to blame? I thought we had a mutual understanding that we would keep the details of our ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù private. How does she not understand this? She never reached out to me for any clarification and immediately jumped to some weird conclusion.

I tried to flirt and tease a bit here and there. She twirled her hair at times while smiling. But, towards the end, she said she had plans with friends so had to cut the date short.

Praying, just like my mother. 

I could sense Her already seeping inside them, malevolent and greedy. 

‚ÄúI can take it all away,‚Äù she murmured, filling my head with could-have-beens. 

It was just me and them, living in Bolivia House. There were no cults, no dead brothers, no hatred and disdain and endless pain neither of us could bury. 

I didn't realize how much I wanted it until I begged her, letting her pick apart my brain. 

My own voice faded as she dragged it from my mouth, filling me with bliss, with the life I had always craved.

‚ÄúBring them back!‚Äù I buried my head in my knees, sobbing.

Her glow was warm, soothing my aching bones.

‚ÄúIn any way I want?‚Äù she hummed. ‚ÄúAny shape I want?‚Äù

Her voice trickled through me. ‚ÄúI can shape and mold them in any way I desire?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I gritted out, digging my nails into the ground.

‚ÄúGive him to me,‚Äù she commanded. ‚ÄúThe King‚Äôs vessel.‚Äù The moon was greedy, almost moaning.

‚ÄúGive him to me, Nina.‚Äù

I did, gently pushing Rowan off my lap, letting the water envelope him.

She drew back with a melodic laugh, her light illuminating the water before dancing behind the clouds.

When the first prickles of dawn broke through the sky, I was sitting on the riverbank with my head balanced on my knees, a butterfly caught in the breeze. 

Confusion, swiftly followed by panic, crept down my spine. I couldn't remember why I was there so late.

Why, when I swiped at my eyes, I was *crying*.

‚ÄúNin? Come on, we‚Äôre leaving.‚Äù

Twisting around, Imogen Prairie stood behind me, shivering in shorts and a t-shirt, her sandals hanging from one hand. She pulled me to my feet, grinning.

‚ÄúThat is the last time we go moon-watching with the boys,‚Äù she laughed, tugging me closer. I found myself reveling in her warmth. ‚ÄúI can't feel my feet!‚Äù

We traipsed our way back to the car, where Kaz was waiting, a knitted blanket over his shoulders. Impatient, as usual, arms folded, like a divorced father of three.

I smirked at the Ray-Bans perched on his head. ‚ÄúYou're looking progressively more dad-like as the days go by.‚Äù

Kaz shot me the finger, his lips curving into a smirk.

‚ÄúYeah, but unlike others, I actually *rock* the look.‚Äù

I pulled a face. ‚ÄúYou're the most millennial Gen Z I've ever met.‚Äù

Kaz grinned. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take that as a compliment!‚Äù He threw the car-keys keys at Imogen. ‚ÄúSince you enjoy complaining, you can drive us home.‚Äù he jutted his chin, gesturing to Rowan, whose head was comfortably pressed against the back window. ‚ÄúSince our ‚Äòdesignated driver‚Äô has passed out.*

‚ÄúI'm not *passed out*,‚Äù Rowan grumbled from the car. ‚ÄúI'm clearly resting my eyes.‚Äù

I shoved Kaz with my hip. ‚ÄúImmie‚Äôs been with me, and she's barely complained.‚Äù

He shot me a pointed look. ‚ÄúWere you knocked on the head? She ranted about mosquitoes for three hours.‚Äù

Imogen took the keys, jumping into the driver's seat. ‚ÄúOf course I enjoy complaining! It's one of many things I'm good at.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe only thing she's good at,‚Äù Rowan grumbled from the backseat, his chin perched on Kaz‚Äôs seat once I wiggled in with him. 

When Imogen twisted around, thwacked him with her fly swatter, he groaned. ‚ÄúShe's just pissed I forgot the bug spray.‚Äù Rowan rolled his eyes, reaching for his flask and taking a long drink.

He spat it out immediately, all over his lap.

‚ÄúRowan, this is a new car.‚Äù Kaz spoke through his teeth. 

‚ÄúThat's disgusting.‚Äù Rowan swiped his mouth. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is *that*?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's coffee, Einstein,‚Äù Kaz twisted around in his seat, his eyebrows furrowing. ‚ÄúI made it earlier.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, it tastes like shit!‚Äù Rowan shoved the flask in Kaz‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúHere. Try it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't wanna taste shitty coffee, dude.‚Äù

Rowan groaned, bouncing in his seat like a little kid. ‚ÄúNo, seriously, try it!‚Äù

Kaz did, rolling his eyes, before he too lost his composure and spat it out.

‚ÄúUrgh!‚Äù

‚ÄúStop throwing up all over the car!‚Äù Imogen squeaked, gripping the wheel. ‚ÄúDo I really need to remind two grown adults not to make a mess?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's not my fault Kaz brewed expired coffee!‚Äù Rowan shot back.

I looked at Kaz for some kind of explanation, but he looked oddly sickly.

‚ÄúYou're serious,‚Äù I said when Kaz sent me a wounded puppy look.

‚ÄúRowan's right,‚Äù he stuck out his tongue. ‚ÄúThat tastes like literal ass.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou two are animals,‚Äù Imogen muttered, flicking on the radio.

Curious, I snatched the coffee from Rowan‚Äôs lap and took a hesitant sip.

*It was‚Ä¶ coffee*.

Sweet and bitter, running down my throat.

‚ÄúI have no idea what you're talking about,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt tastes fine.‚Äù

Rowan ignored me, tipping his head back, groaning.

I could have sworn, at just the right angle, his teeth looked‚Ä¶*sharper*?

‚ÄúHey, can we stop at a drive-thru?‚Äù he groaned. *‚ÄúI'm like, really fucking hungry.‚Äù*

‚Äì

Rowan's words lingered in my mind, the memory shattering into nothing. 

I was yanked back to reality.

This time, though, I wasn't in pain anymore.

Pain didn't exist.

Only the skylight above, the moon shining down on me, and their teeth ripping through me, their hands snapping my bones one by one, scooping up my insides and gorging on me. 

I was still alive, still breathing without lungs, without a heart, without a brain to think with, to form logical thought. 

Three shadows, three royals, drenched in red and bearing human flesh as shawls, human bones as jeweled crowns. 

With no mouth to scream with, I allowed them to rip me apart, over and over, trying to tear into the black and white static stitching me back together again.

They were merciless, never stopping or faltering, gorging themselves.

With me.

I think I started to understand when I could no longer recognize Kaz through the thick beads of red running down his face.

The slithering human flesh that was still alive, patching his skin back together.

Imogen‚Äôs empty eyes.

Rowan‚Äôs monstrous, grinning snarl as he choked on my pulsing flesh.

I couldn't save them.

However, thanks to my memories, I knew exactly how to kill them.

My eyes found Rowan, the most merciless, ripping me apart, even when I was barely together, tangled static.

Kill him.

For good.

‚ÄúThat's right,‚Äù the cult-woman's voice soothed the royals, coaxing them to continue. ‚ÄúThere you go. Eat, my darlings.‚Äù

I didn't react to the voice. I couldn't.

I wouldn't.

The woman with greying hair and a beautiful, youthful glow.

Who worshipped the moon and murdered my brother.

Maybe the moon was actually empathetic, ripping away my memories of her.

Mom.

‚ÄúIsn't this what you have always wanted?‚Äù Mom hummed. 

She knelt in front of me, placing a crown of adorned bone on my head.

I recognized it as what was left of Sam‚Äôs skull. She bowed, her lips splitting into a grin, her eyes leaking moonlight.

I tried medication for a month and did not like the side effects. To help combat my symptoms, throughout the past year I have:  
\- quit coffee (will drink matcha lattes for caffeine, also the occasional Diet Coke as a treat)  
\- quit alcohol (with a few annual binge-drinking exceptions like weddings and events)  
\- been working out 4-6x/week (mostly F45, pilates, and yoga)  
\- been taking a bunch of supplements

To reward my hard work, I decided to meet with a highly recommended naturopath to learn what I can improve upon. I had to complete a long intake form and had a 2hr preliminary meeting. Below are the recommendations my naturopathic doctor provided. Sharing for those who would find it helpful & also curious to hear any thoughts/feedback:

OVERVIEW OF VISIT

1. PCOS
2. ADHD

PLAN: Buy a pill organizer today. Integrate supplement intake with habits you're already doing (i.e. habit stacking), to support daily consistency. Support cognitive and hormonal health.

***Supplements***

*Foundational supplements:*

**Standard Omega 3 (AquaOmega 3x extra strength)** \- 4 capsules/day. Best taken before meals. Promotes brain, skin, eye, health and improves fluidity of cellular membranes. You're looking for at least 3:1 EPA:DHA ratio (4 or 5:1 is also great) for best results regarding ADHD & mood symptoms. Any fish oil product should be 3rd party certified for purity. Source of oil: anchovy. Or take the ones you have: **Webber Naturals Triple Strength Omega-3** \- 3 capsules/day.

**Magnesium bisglycinate** (whatever brand you have) - 200mg/day. Take with dinner or in the evening for best results. Helps to calm the nervous system, eases muscle tension. Helpful for cognitive function. Magnesium is a common nutritional deficiency.

**Inositol** \- Myo-Inositol (CanPrev or other brand) - Start with 0.5-1g/day. Increase by 0.5-1g/day every 4-5 days as long as you're not experiencing any gastric discomfort. This supplement can cause some bloating, so it's recommended to increase dose incrementally until you reach the therapeutic target dose of 4g-5g/day. Helps support insulin regulation and hormonal signalling. You can start with the capsules you have, and slowly increase your dose. A powder may be preferred to reduce pill burden.

**Hormone Balance TL (Cyto-Matrix)** \- 2 capsules/day. Helps to reduce testosterone, and support hormonal re-balancing in some types of PCOS.

**Vitamin D3** ‚Äì 2,500IU to 3,000IU/day. Essential nutrient key for gut, immune, brain, metabolic and emotional health and more. Use a liquid or gel cap for optimal absorption.

***Great additions (I already take these):***

**L-theanine** \- 250mg/day. Supports a sense of relaxation and moderated stress response.  
**Advanced B Complex** \- 1 capsule/day. Supports energy, immune and cognitive function. As well as liver function (including hormone regulation and detoxification functions).  
**Spearmint tea** \- 1 cup/day  
**Lion's Mane** \- 400mg/day.

***Diet & Lifestyle***

Focus on **adding** in nourishing activities, and rewarding yourself for improved sleep habits.

**Sleep -** A good night's rest is an essential factor in supporting a healthy immune system, bolstering resilience to stress, and maintaining long-term brain and body wellness. Underlining the importance of adequate time for deep rest, and the reality of how this supports your health-related goals may help to modify habits that don't serve your goals.  
**Stress Management -** Stress has an important role to play in every aspect of our health. It's key to schedule time for activities that nourish you. This may include relaxation, quiet time, alone time, time in nature, social time, time for play - basically, the things that help you enjoy life, and act as a counter-balance to stressors. Time to cultivate awareness of your embodied experience, time to nourish your spirit, time to recharge your batteries. This could be a bath, engaging in a creative (relaxing) hobby, some gentle stretching, a guided meditation, or just time for calm reflection. Essentially any activity that leaves you feeling more relaxed and nourished. Here are some avenues to explore and engage with:

* Grounding - any practices that help to bring you back into your body when the mind gets busy / detached
* Being in nature
* Sensory walks
* Sing-out / dance - can be structured or unstructured (as in whatever you feel like grooving to in your living room or bedroom or wherever you happen to be)

I have seen reality shift in front my eyes in mere minutes after some duas. Believe me I don‚Äôt entertain none of that superficial sufi nonsense I am far from that belief. The amount of times I have seen things happen in my favour to make my duas come true is insane. it‚Äôs like reality itself distorts in your favor.

I was going through a hard time recently. Didn‚Äôt have the right food for the gym had no money and even though my parents are wealthy they hardly ever entertain any of my ‚Äúprotein chahiye‚Äù so I have to buy them off of my own earnings.

I hade none left and was eating so less, Bukhaar sar dard everything was going wrong. Heck aik biryani ky paise nahi thy bahir hi nahi jasakta tha. All I had and i remember this 2000 rs and I had 20 days to stuff protein rich foods in that amount warna ghar pe tou saalan hi milna tha.

I remember eating all the strawberries from the fridge jhab bhi mujhe plate nazar ati fridge mai üòÖ. Ab itna bura time atleast money wise never came to me ever.

I did a dua in Tahajjud and the next day woke up knowing Allah will provide for me and I don‚Äôt need to worry anymore. 200 rupees aik maangnay walay ko diye who‚Äôs eyes were blind got a coffee and biryani too. Aglay din hi saray kharch diya hahaha.

2 din ghar se jo bhi mila kha liya. Out of know where I got an amount I could comfortably satisfy my needs with for the whole month. I knew this was gonna happen but I often think back to the times when I had severely low imaan.

How I used to be ungrateful all the time even when being given money ( a lot ) by parents. Now I am grateful for everything and get even more in return while expecting it because I made the dua and I know ky a miracle is coming.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

First, this listing was originally created on January 19th, and I paid that listing fee already. I know they charge the listing fee whenever something sells, but 4 fees? 2 of which don't even qualify because this is not a multi-quantity listing. It was listed with only 1 quantity. I went in to check my variations, and the quantity variation is not active.

I have not contacted Etsy yet, since I'm just finding out. Honestly, I'll trust the responses I get here before I let Etsy talk me into circles. I've only been selling on Etsy for less than a year and I want to make sure get feedback on what could be going on before I freak out about it.

Update: I am currently contacting Etsy about this. One of the transaction fees was refunded, but the listing fee issue has yet to be explained and was ignored in all my messages. I am still awaiting a response.

Update: Etsy is basically saying ""F off"" with charging 4 listing fees. They just can't explain it. The response is quoted here. ""As you can see that I have refunded to you now and each listing incurs a $0.20 fee when created or renewed. If your listing was auto-renewed due to a sale, that's another fee.

It just seems like she‚Äôs always looking for me or trying to get my attention whenever I‚Äôm close, like one time I ordered a latte from her and my friend noticed that as we were talking Jane kept looking over to me even while she was making my latte. Whenever I‚Äôm ordering something on the kiosk I would see her in my peripheral just staring at me and when I‚Äôd finally look at her she would smile and try to strike up a convo just about anything really which I don‚Äôt mind :) heck I could be just walking by while we‚Äôre both busy doing things for our own departments and she‚Äôll make a random comment about something that we can both see like ‚Äúhaha this grill sounds like it has pop rocks on it‚Äù and I‚Äôd laugh, ask about it more, and we‚Äôd get back to work

Jane always works so hard at her job, she mentioned once that certain customers stress her out so I told her ‚Äúoh I hope I don‚Äôt stress you out‚Äù and this girl literally says ‚Äúno, when I see you I get energized‚Äù 

And every time we talk she has a tendency to ‚Äúovershare‚Äù things like there could be a rush at her job and she‚Äôd still tell me about how she binged watch all these kdramas with her mom and gained weight during the winter break or how she had a really rough time at work last week because she got her period during a catering event. 

Lately though she started grabbing, touching, and tugging on my arm every time she gets excited or whenever she gets angry and rants about the other barista. Today I wanted to return the favor so after she grabbed both my wrists I loosened myself from her grip so I could grab her hands instead then I gently put them down while keeping the same beat and energy in the convo. I hope this didn‚Äôt tell her to stop doing it though

Another thing that happened today is that she came to my office just to tell me that she‚Äôs covering the other barista so she can make me my latte (the other barista is notorious for making shit coffee) so we walked together to the cafe and talked and talked. I randomly asked about the oranges they had at the counter and she looked through all of them and gave me the best looking one. 

Is there any reason for me to think that she doesn‚Äôt like me and she‚Äôs just being friendly? Well she seems friendly to everyone but every time I‚Äôm there she always approaches me and we start chatting it up

1ip0o70,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1ip0o70/seeking_advice_on_a_range_of_academic_questions/,Seeking Advice on a Range of Academic Questions,"Hi all,

I‚Äôm a fourth-year part-time grad student working full-time, but outside my field of interest. I have aspirations to pursue a PhD and contribute to the discourse, but lack academic research experience and faculty references or connections. I want to take steps toward this goal, but have questions about academia that have made it hard to progress without answers. I would greatly appreciate any insights from this community on the following.

1. How did you connect with your advisor? How did you address concerns about ‚Äútaking too much of their time‚Äù or fears of not being able to be useful enough to them?
2. When reaching out to a professor, it‚Äôs important to be clear about what you‚Äôre asking. But what if what you're asking for is advice, guidance, your research questions, or assistance in finding your place in the field? Or asking for positions or experience? This feels like a lot to ask of someone.
3. Once you connect with a professor, how do they engage with you? How do you gain ""experience"" from connecting with a professor? What is the typical ""trajectory"" people might go on when reaching out to a professor, i.e. is the end game going out for coffee or meeting online? 
4. I‚Äôve studied various theoretical approaches and have many research questions, but I feel overwhelmed by the abundance of methodological and theoretical choices to apply to my inquiry. Although some methods fit certain questions better, each has its own limitations. How did you choose your framework and methodology when starting out? Did an advisor help?
5. If no one at your institution is well-suited to advise you, is it okay to email professors at other institutions to ask for guidance or advising? Does this violate any ‚Äúunwritten rules‚Äù in the advising process? Would it be better to connect with an advisor at your institution even if their interests are only somewhat related to yours?
6. What advice would you offer someone who struggles socially in academic settings? While I have strong social skills and friendships, I find the academic social dynamics challenging, especially in relation to contacting professors whom I respect so much.

1ip0cxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1ip0cxu/i_had_a_career_as_a_professional_mourner_during/,"I had a career as a ""professional mourner"" during the 80s. The last assignment I ever accepted nearly got me killed. (Part 1)","*‚ÄúYou sure this is the right place, Hank?‚Äù*¬†I shouted from outside the limousine.

The husky chauffeur didn‚Äôt respond, attention transfixed on his handheld television, fiddling with the antennae to minimize static. A cold October wind howled through the valley, causing the slit of my black dress to flutter against my thigh. Frustration mounted behind my eyes as I waited for an answer, glaring through the passenger‚Äôs side window while shivering from the violent squall.

Getting the sense that he was intentionally ignoring me, I pulled trembling fists from the pockets of my wool coat and improvised a drum solo against the thick glass. My knuckles were so cold that I barely felt them make contact.

The amateur rendition of Van Halen‚Äôs¬†*‚ÄúHot For Teacher‚Äù*¬†was enough to get his attention. A scowl curled up the side of his face. Without moving his eyes away from the blinking screen, Hank leaned over to roll down the window, his beer gut flopping awkwardly over the central console like a pillowcase half filled with maple syrup. He gave the crank two lazy twists, and the window creaked down a few inches.

*‚ÄúRobin - what the fuck is the matter? It‚Äôs the goddamned World Series,‚Äù*¬†he said, pointing at the small TV and acting like I was unaware of that fact. Hank had nearly careened off the road multiple times on the thirty-minute drive over here, seemingly unable to drag his eyes away from the game for more than a handful of seconds at a time.

I felt a myriad of insults thump against the back of my teeth, begging to be unleashed, but I swallowed my annoyance.

*‚ÄúCan you please just look at the sign?‚Äù*¬†I pleaded, gesturing to the name listed above a picture of the deceased.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äô85 wasn‚Äôt our year, but ‚Äò87‚Ä¶‚Äô87 is for The Cardinals‚Ä¶‚Äù*¬†he muttered, still glued to the feed.

*‚ÄúHank, for the love of God, confirm that I‚Äôm walking into the right funeral or I‚Äôm getting back into the car. I was told the guy‚Äôs name was ""‚ÄòJohn‚Äô, not ‚ÄòJom‚Äô. The damn sign says ‚ÄòJom‚Äô.‚Äù*¬†I snapped.

Hank slumped his shoulders with childlike exaggeration and sighed. Reluctantly, he shoved a meaty claw into the breast pocket of his blazer, digging around for the instructions given to him by our escort agency. With a crumpled slip of paper in hand, his pupils finally detached from the game. Hastily, he scanned the name and date.

*‚ÄúLooks right to me,‚Äù*¬†he remarked. Before I could ask to see it too, he spat chewing tobacco that had been resting along his gumline into the slip. My eyes widened in disbelief as I watched Hank wrap the paper around the brown-black ichor, only to then toss the malformed lump into his coffee cup.

*‚ÄúChrist, Hank. You couldn‚Äôt have just handed it to me, like a human being? Or are you not a human being? Maybe you're actually some human-shaped donkey? Does that sound right?‚Äù*

The insult finally brought his eyes to meet mine. Instead of anger, he shot me a threatening grin. A wolf‚Äôs smile, bearing hungry canines in my direction.

*‚ÄúLook, doll - how about you tiptoe those fragile, porcelain feet up to the home‚Äôs concierge and ask about the service? I‚Äôll wait here. If it ain‚Äôt right, we‚Äôll go back to the office.‚Äù*

He expected a sheepish reply, but I sure as shit didn‚Äôt give him one, instead providing a thumbs up with my right hand and a middle finger with my left. I didn‚Äôt scare easy. Not only that, but I‚Äôve been in the escort business long enough to know the difference between an actual predator and a small man making empty threats.

When I turned to walk up the cobblestone path that led to the funeral home, my ears became filled with the sound of Hank slamming his foot down on the accelerator, tires screeching against asphalt. Didn‚Äôt even bother to turn back around, honestly. No point.

*‚ÄúAsshole.‚Äù*¬†I murmured, securing my purse under my arm to prevent it from blowing away as I approached the opulent, repurposed plantation house.

The mansion‚Äôs white pillars loomed over me as I carefully climbed the porch steps, stilettos clacking against the refurbished wood. As I stepped toward the front door, a surge of anxiety unexpectedly sprinted up the length of my spine and planted itself at the top of my neck, crackling around the base of my skull like electricity from an exposed wire. With my heartbeat galloping in my chest, I took a deep breath and twisted the knob, not willing to let nervous energy prevent me from earning my keep.

A lot of what happened to me was out of my control, but I did one thing wrong that day. My gut was screaming for me to turn around. It implored me to sprint back down those stairs and into the street like the devil themself was close behind me, nipping at my heels.

But I ignored the feeling, contorted my face into an expression of grief, and pushed on, unknowingly putting myself into the Cult of the Scarab's crosshairs, intruding on their rite of sacred renewal.

\----------

*‚ÄúRight this way, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù*¬†said the funeral director, leading me into a familiar narrow hallway behind the lobby. Only a week earlier I‚Äôd been at this funeral home, pretending to grieve over someone else. As we walked, I reviewed the details I‚Äôd received concerning the deceased, provided to my agency by his company‚Äôs board of investors.

*Pharmaceutical CFO. Passed in his late sixties. Very private. Had two previous marriages. Right hand was mangled during his tenure in Vietnam, doesn‚Äôt bother with a prosthetic. Months before his death, rumors of him being gay cropped up in the tabloids.*

*I‚Äôm playing his secret lover. An unknown buxom paramour, weeping over the loss of their sugar daddy, dispelling the whispers of his potential homosexuality.*

People purchased my time for an assortment of different reasons. Sometimes, I was hired by the soon-to-be deceased, arriving at their memorial service just to boost the overall number of attendees visibly present and grieving. Other times, the request was more specific and it wasn‚Äôt the deceased who was hiring me.

This was one of those¬†*other times.*

It wasn‚Äôt glamorous work, lying at some poor sap‚Äôs funeral on the behalf of someone else and their interests, but it was much preferable to the labor I performed when I was first hired. Think fishnet stockings and disagreements over the virtues of condom use.

All that said, it'd be disingenuous to say I wasn't proud of myself.

This was my niche, and despite the seediness, it was mine, and I was good at it. Considered an expert, actually. Anyone can show up and be a pretty face in the crowd; a twenty-something with running mascara and a nice ass cartoonishly¬†*boo-hooing*¬†into an open casket. But me? I played the assigned role with tact and nuance. I sold a narrative, and nine times out of ten, my marks bought it.

The key was you needed to be a proficient improviser.

Discretion was the name of the game in my line of work; I rarely got a lot of background information about the deceased to work with. Meant I had to be capable of thinking on my toes - bobbing and weaving through conversations like my life depended on it.

Ironically, though, if I wasn‚Äôt so damn convincing, I might not have ended up almost suffocating to death less than an hour after the funeral concluded.

\----------

I expected all the usual sounds of organized memorial would become audible as we approached the reception hall; sobbing, a pipe organ singing its quiet lamentations, hushed arguments over the division of an inheritance. Sounds most people associated with deep sorrow. To me, however, mourning sounded like work. It was ambient noise I had become so accustomed to that I barely even noticed it.

But that‚Äôs not what I heard as we drew closer to the service. Quite the opposite, actually. Joyful sounds reverberated down the hallway. As the funeral director opened the door to the reception hall, I heard laughing and the clinking of glasses. The sparkling timbre of a wedding filled my ears, not the joyless dirge of a wake.

I stepped in, and for a moment, I truly believed I was walking in on some kind of themed birthday party. Every attendee sported a pure white outfit, head to toe. The previously jubilant noise fizzled out into dead silence when they saw me enter, adorned in funerary black. I was nearly about to excuse myself back through the door when I spied a young man at the opposite end of the vast room, dressed in a black three-piece suit, leaning wearily against an enormous marble coffin.

*‚ÄúIs‚Ä¶is this Jom‚Äôs funeral?‚Äù*¬†I managed to sputter out into the motionless crowd.

The fifty or so funeral goers remained silent. I could tell that something about my arrival was intensely befuddling, with looks of confusion painted over the attendee‚Äôs faces. Eventually, the shrill squeaking of poorly lubricated metal wheels broke the silence. The crowd parted to reveal an elderly woman in a wheelchair pushing herself towards me. She peered from side-to-side as she approached, observing the still petrified mourners staring at me with a look of disapproval.

*‚ÄúOh, would you relax? Go back to what you were doing. I‚Äôll figure it out. Khepri save us, y‚Äôall would be startled shitless by a ladybug if it flew at you too fast,‚Äù*¬†she croaked. Slowly, the figures in white pulled their attention away from me, and the lively chatter resumed, albeit at a much lower volume.

With the funeral reanimated, the elderly woman brought her eyes to mine, converting her scowl into a toothy grin. A wispy white dress hung loosely from her skeletal frame, giving her the appearance of a mobility-challenged banshee. The weight of a golden broach pulled the front of her dress forward at the collarbone, revealing the outlines of her upper ribs through thin, liver spotted skin. The accessory was about the size of a golf ball, and it depicted a beetle with what looked like a lotus flower etched onto its wings.

*‚ÄúAnd you are, dear?‚Äù*¬†she asked, settling in front of me by using a levered brake to halt the wheelchair‚Äôs momentum.

Based on the woman‚Äôs command of the other mourners and her wizened appearance, I made an educated guess as to her identity.

*‚ÄúHi‚Ä¶you must be Jom‚Äôs mother?‚Äù*

She nodded, her brow furrowing and her grin melting away as her head tilted up and down. The matriarch studied me intensely, her expression now twisted into one of confusion, like those of the mourners when they first saw me.

Relief fluttered through my chest. I briefly savored the pleasurable rush that came after the anxiety of a calculated risk. Then I smiled, took a generous inhale, and continued, launching into an ad libbed speech I had given countless times before.

*""It is nice finally to meet you. I‚Ä¶I wish it wasn‚Äôt under these circumstances, and I wish I knew your first name, but you know how private Jom can be-‚Äù*

I paused and forced a chuckle, letting tears well up as I broke eye contact - body language that screamed ‚Äú*I‚Äôm struggling to use past tense now that he's dead, oh the sweet misery‚Äù*. A sigh fell from my lips, and then I picked up where I left off.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶you know how private Jom*¬†***could***¬†*be. I‚Äôm Tara. Your son and I were together for the last year or so. What‚Äôs your first name, ma‚Äôam?‚Äù*

Unexpectedly, I watched her eyes widen with some mix of alarm and disbelief.

*‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶it‚Äôs Akila‚Äù*

Without saying anything more, she abruptly pivoted her head and torso around, scanning the room for someone. Akila seemingly couldn‚Äôt locate them in the crowd, so she just started shouting a name.

*‚ÄúHorus! Hoooorus! Could someone bring my grandson over?‚Äù*

The figures closest to us leaped into action, clearly fighting to be the person that fulfilled Akila‚Äôs request. Within seconds, one of the attendees, a hulking middle-aged man with biceps like tree trunks, returned with the kid in the black suit that had been previously leaning against the coffin, practically dragging the miserable looking young man by the wrist to his grandmother.

*‚ÄúAh! There you are, Horus.‚Äù*¬†Akila cooed.

The boy barely responded, giving his elder an affirmative grunt. Before he was pulled from the crowd, I was laser focused on selling my story, constructing answers to questions that hadn‚Äôt even been asked yet. Seeing the anguish dripping off his features broke my concentration.

He looked to be in his early twenties, about six-feet tall, with a shaved head and a half crescent nose ring connecting his nostrils. His eyes were saturated with a deep, reflective sadness, his gaze empty and distant, like he was watching a memory rather than actually seeing anything physically in front of him. The corners of his mouth were collapsed into a rigid, immovable frown, the type of vacant expression that‚Äôs left over only after you‚Äôve already completely exhausted every other painful emotion.

My heart broke for him. Whatever familial weirdness was currently on display, with the perfect white dress code and the inappropriately cheery atmosphere, the kid seemed like he was the only one experiencing genuine grief. His dad was dead, and he looked hurt and alone.

That empathy would last about another ten minutes.

*‚ÄúHorus‚Ä¶this woman, Tara, is claiming to have been with your father, and she‚Äôs showing up here dressed like‚Ä¶dressed like that. Did you know anything about this?‚Äù*

*This might be game over,*¬†I thought to myself.¬†*Need to come up with a way to recover.*

He pointed his empty gaze at me. For a second, his eyes remained cold. But then, like the flash of blinding white light before the explosion of an atomic bomb, his expression instantly brightened and became animated. It wasn‚Äôt recognition that had reignited Horus; it was something else.

It was an idea. I didn‚Äôt know it at the time, but Horus was a pretty damn good improvisor as well.

*‚ÄúYeah, I know her. Dad mentioned her a few times in passing. Told me that she may or may not show up today. He wasn‚Äôt sure whether she really loved him or not, but I think he told her to show up if she did really love him.‚Äù*

He paused, calculating what to say next.

*‚ÄúTara‚Äôs an outsider. Dad wasn‚Äôt sure that we‚Äôd accept her, especially after what happened with Diane.‚Äù*

Akila turned back to me, now stone-faced and deathly serious.

*‚ÄúWell, Tara, is all that true? You‚Äôre here because you loved my son?‚Äù*

I didn‚Äôt have long to contemplate the strangeness that was unfolding in front me, so I acted on instinct.

Terrible call.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶yes! Yes, I loved Jom. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here.‚Äù*

Horus nearly crumbled to the ground, his immovable frown dissipating into a grin swollen with ecstasy.

*‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶well alright then. That‚Äôs very noble of you, to come here of your own volition, espousing your love from my son. Bassel, could you escort Tara to the front? Show her where family sits? The eulogy will be starting in a few minutes.‚Äù*¬†Akila replied.

The brawny gentleman with the tree-trunk biceps walked over, placing one massive arm forward to guide me and the other massive arm on my shoulder, as if to make sure I wasn‚Äôt going anywhere.

Behind me, I heard Horus cackling, doubling over and practically wheezing from whatever he found to be so goddamned funny.

\----------

There was a certain comedy to the way Akila had been positioned to deliver the eulogy. I couldn‚Äôt appreciate the humor of it at the time, with Bassel following me like a shadow, his looming presence causing a veritable chorus of alarm bells to ring loudly in my skull. But, in retrospect, I remember the juxtaposition of her in front of the casket being genuinely funny.

She was just so absurdly small, and the coffin was just so absurdly big. A marble torpedo behind a human earthworm, wrinkled skin flapping up and down as she spewed her ritualistic bullshit into the microphone.

*‚ÄúJom was a wonderful son, a loving father, and a devoted vicar of Khepri.‚Äù*¬†Akila boomed, voice tinged with bursts of static from cheap speaker systems.

*‚ÄúWhen Jom was on death‚Äôs door, we all felt his pain. In terms of renewal, he was without an ideal conduit. We all still grieve the loss of Diane, consumed by heresy, leaving him without love and Horus without a mother.‚Äù*

I turned to Bassel, pointing to my bladder and then pointing to the door. It was a lie; nature wasn‚Äôt calling. Not in that sense, at least. My subconscious was screaming, begging me to get the fuck out of that room through whatever means possible.

*Something is so fucking wrong,*¬†I thought, waiting for Bassel to respond to my pantomiming.

He smiled, but it wasn‚Äôt reassuring. The grin was patronizing, revealing his own bitter amusement rather than his willingness to help, like he was watching his cat trying and failing to jump onto a forbidden table.

The man shook his head¬†*no*¬†a few times, and then placed a hand over my scalp, manually twisting my head back in the direction of Akila.

*‚ÄúLittle did we know, however, that in the nick of time, Jom found love. He was scared to divulge his love to us, because she is an outsider, just as Diane was. But, by being here, she has proven herself worthy of Khepri‚Äôs embrace, unlike the heretic.‚Äù*¬†she said, gesturing a bony hand in my direction, long acrylic nails taking the shape of hawk talons.

*‚ÄúTara - we‚Äôre very grateful for your love, and your commitment to Jom. As you well know, passionate love is the best conduit. It's easier for Khepri to mold. But, of course, the love of youngest son will do if passionate love isn‚Äôt available. All that is to say, I‚Äôm sure Horus is very grateful, as well.‚Äù*

At that point, my heart was crashing against my rib cage like jackhammer, percussive and relentless. Bassel‚Äôs sturdy hand remained on my head, fixing my gaze on Akila.

Because of that, I couldn‚Äôt look away when the matriarch turned to face me, detailing what was to be my fate.

*‚ÄúYour black night, desolate and bare, will draw the death from Jom, granting him renewal.‚Äù*

Sweat poured over my body, drenching me with sticky fear.

*‚ÄúAre you ready, Tara?‚Äù*

Another white-clad figure appeared behind Akila, wrenching the heavy lid of the casket open.

Inside, Jom‚Äôs desiccated corpse laid flat, arms crossed over his shoulders, naked as the day he was born. But his body only covered half of the available space.

You see, the reason the coffin was so damn large is because it was built to house two separate people. The other half¬†*had*¬†been for Jom‚Äôs son, but now it was designated for me.

They were going to bury me alive in that marble tomb.

As if I even needed it confirmed at that point, I noted that the body had both of their hands. My actual assignment had lost one of his during their tour of Vietnam.

Hank had dropped me off on the wrong day.

When I didn‚Äôt move towards the casket, paralyzed by fear, Akila spoke into the microphone one more time, sharp static crackling through the speakers again like an electric tongue whipping invisibly through the air.

*‚ÄúBassel, it seems like Tara is having a bit of cold feet. Bring her over here, show our conduit how spacious it is inside, next to her beloved.‚Äù*

The man‚Äôs muscular paw pulled my head up, forcing me to my feet.

I tried to brainstorm even a fragment of an exit strategy, but for the second time that day, Horus broke my concentration.

Somewhere in the back of the room, I heard him snickering under his breath, downright elated with his unbelievably good fortune.

I wouldn‚Äôt let him distract me again after that.",2,1739500231.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ip0ck3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1ip0ck3/i_had_a_career_as_a_professional_mourner_during/,"I had a career as a ""professional mourner"" during the 80s. The last assignment I ever accepted nearly got me killed. (Part 1)","*‚ÄúYou sure this is the right place, Hank?‚Äù*¬†I shouted from outside the limousine.

The husky chauffeur didn‚Äôt respond, attention transfixed on his handheld television, fiddling with the antennae to minimize static. A cold October wind howled through the valley, causing the slit of my black dress to flutter against my thigh. Frustration mounted behind my eyes as I waited for an answer, glaring through the passenger‚Äôs side window while shivering from the violent squall.

Getting the sense that he was intentionally ignoring me, I pulled trembling fists from the pockets of my wool coat and improvised a drum solo against the thick glass. My knuckles were so cold that I barely felt them make contact.

The amateur rendition of Van Halen‚Äôs¬†*‚ÄúHot For Teacher‚Äù*¬†was enough to get his attention. A scowl curled up the side of his face. Without moving his eyes away from the blinking screen, Hank leaned over to roll down the window, his beer gut flopping awkwardly over the central console like a pillowcase half filled with maple syrup. He gave the crank two lazy twists, and the window creaked down a few inches.

*‚ÄúRobin - what the fuck is the matter? It‚Äôs the goddamned World Series,‚Äù*¬†he said, pointing at the small TV and acting like I was unaware of that fact. Hank had nearly careened off the road multiple times on the thirty-minute drive over here, seemingly unable to drag his eyes away from the game for more than a handful of seconds at a time.

I felt a myriad of insults thump against the back of my teeth, begging to be unleashed, but I swallowed my annoyance.

*‚ÄúCan you please just look at the sign?‚Äù*¬†I pleaded, gesturing to the name listed above a picture of the deceased.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äô85 wasn‚Äôt our year, but ‚Äò87‚Ä¶‚Äô87 is for The Cardinals‚Ä¶‚Äù*¬†he muttered, still glued to the feed.

*‚ÄúHank, for the love of God, confirm that I‚Äôm walking into the right funeral or I‚Äôm getting back into the car. I was told the guy‚Äôs name was ""‚ÄòJohn‚Äô, not ‚ÄòJom‚Äô. The damn sign says ‚ÄòJom‚Äô.‚Äù*¬†I snapped.

Hank slumped his shoulders with childlike exaggeration and sighed. Reluctantly, he shoved a meaty claw into the breast pocket of his blazer, digging around for the instructions given to him by our escort agency. With a crumpled slip of paper in hand, his pupils finally detached from the game. Hastily, he scanned the name and date.

*‚ÄúLooks right to me,‚Äù*¬†he remarked. Before I could ask to see it too, he spat chewing tobacco that had been resting along his gumline into the slip. My eyes widened in disbelief as I watched Hank wrap the paper around the brown-black ichor, only to then toss the malformed lump into his coffee cup.

*‚ÄúChrist, Hank. You couldn‚Äôt have just handed it to me, like a human being? Or are you not a human being? Maybe you're actually some human-shaped donkey? Does that sound right?‚Äù*

The insult finally brought his eyes to meet mine. Instead of anger, he shot me a threatening grin. A wolf‚Äôs smile, bearing hungry canines in my direction.

*‚ÄúLook, doll - how about you tiptoe those fragile, porcelain feet up to the home‚Äôs concierge and ask about the service? I‚Äôll wait here. If it ain‚Äôt right, we‚Äôll go back to the office.‚Äù*

He expected a sheepish reply, but I sure as shit didn‚Äôt give him one, instead providing a thumbs up with my right hand and a middle finger with my left. I didn‚Äôt scare easy. Not only that, but I‚Äôve been in the escort business long enough to know the difference between an actual predator and a small man making empty threats.

When I turned to walk up the cobblestone path that led to the funeral home, my ears became filled with the sound of Hank slamming his foot down on the accelerator, tires screeching against asphalt. Didn‚Äôt even bother to turn back around, honestly. No point.

*‚ÄúAsshole.‚Äù*¬†I murmured, securing my purse under my arm to prevent it from blowing away as I approached the opulent, repurposed plantation house.

The mansion‚Äôs white pillars loomed over me as I carefully climbed the porch steps, stilettos clacking against the refurbished wood. As I stepped toward the front door, a surge of anxiety unexpectedly sprinted up the length of my spine and planted itself at the top of my neck, crackling around the base of my skull like electricity from an exposed wire. With my heartbeat galloping in my chest, I took a deep breath and twisted the knob, not willing to let nervous energy prevent me from earning my keep.

A lot of what happened to me was out of my control, but I did one thing wrong that day. My gut was screaming for me to turn around. It implored me to sprint back down those stairs and into the street like the devil themself was close behind me, nipping at my heels.

But I ignored the feeling, contorted my face into an expression of grief, and pushed on, unknowingly putting myself into the Cult of the Scarab's crosshairs, intruding on their rite of sacred renewal.

\----------

*‚ÄúRight this way, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù*¬†said the funeral director, leading me into a familiar narrow hallway behind the lobby. Only a week earlier I‚Äôd been at this funeral home, pretending to grieve over someone else. As we walked, I reviewed the details I‚Äôd received concerning the deceased, provided to my agency by his company‚Äôs board of investors.

*Pharmaceutical CFO. Passed in his late sixties. Very private. Had two previous marriages. Right hand was mangled during his tenure in Vietnam, doesn‚Äôt bother with a prosthetic. Months before his death, rumors of him being gay cropped up in the tabloids.*

*I‚Äôm playing his secret lover. An unknown buxom paramour, weeping over the loss of their sugar daddy, dispelling the whispers of his potential homosexuality.*

People purchased my time for an assortment of different reasons. Sometimes, I was hired by the soon-to-be deceased, arriving at their memorial service just to boost the overall number of attendees visibly present and grieving. Other times, the request was more specific and it wasn‚Äôt the deceased who was hiring me.

This was one of those¬†*other times.*

It wasn‚Äôt glamorous work, lying at some poor sap‚Äôs funeral on the behalf of someone else and their interests, but it was much preferable to the labor I performed when I was first hired. Think fishnet stockings and disagreements over the virtues of condom use.

All that said, it'd be disingenuous to say I wasn't proud of myself.

This was my niche, and despite the seediness, it was mine, and I was good at it. Considered an expert, actually. Anyone can show up and be a pretty face in the crowd; a twenty-something with running mascara and a nice ass cartoonishly¬†*boo-hooing*¬†into an open casket. But me? I played the assigned role with tact and nuance. I sold a narrative, and nine times out of ten, my marks bought it.

The key was you needed to be a proficient improviser.

Discretion was the name of the game in my line of work; I rarely got a lot of background information about the deceased to work with. Meant I had to be capable of thinking on my toes - bobbing and weaving through conversations like my life depended on it.

Ironically, though, if I wasn‚Äôt so damn convincing, I might not have ended up almost suffocating to death less than an hour after the funeral concluded.

\----------

I expected all the usual sounds of organized memorial would become audible as we approached the reception hall; sobbing, a pipe organ singing its quiet lamentations, hushed arguments over the division of an inheritance. Sounds most people associated with deep sorrow. To me, however, mourning sounded like work. It was ambient noise I had become so accustomed to that I barely even noticed it.

But that‚Äôs not what I heard as we drew closer to the service. Quite the opposite, actually. Joyful sounds reverberated down the hallway. As the funeral director opened the door to the reception hall, I heard laughing and the clinking of glasses. The sparkling timbre of a wedding filled my ears, not the joyless dirge of a wake.

I stepped in, and for a moment, I truly believed I was walking in on some kind of themed birthday party. Every attendee sported a pure white outfit, head to toe. The previously jubilant noise fizzled out into dead silence when they saw me enter, adorned in funerary black. I was nearly about to excuse myself back through the door when I spied a young man at the opposite end of the vast room, dressed in a black three-piece suit, leaning wearily against an enormous marble coffin.

*‚ÄúIs‚Ä¶is this Jom‚Äôs funeral?‚Äù*¬†I managed to sputter out into the motionless crowd.

The fifty or so funeral goers remained silent. I could tell that something about my arrival was intensely befuddling, with looks of confusion painted over the attendee‚Äôs faces. Eventually, the shrill squeaking of poorly lubricated metal wheels broke the silence. The crowd parted to reveal an elderly woman in a wheelchair pushing herself towards me. She peered from side-to-side as she approached, observing the still petrified mourners staring at me with a look of disapproval.

*‚ÄúOh, would you relax? Go back to what you were doing. I‚Äôll figure it out. Khepri save us, y‚Äôall would be startled shitless by a ladybug if it flew at you too fast,‚Äù*¬†she croaked. Slowly, the figures in white pulled their attention away from me, and the lively chatter resumed, albeit at a much lower volume.

With the funeral reanimated, the elderly woman brought her eyes to mine, converting her scowl into a toothy grin. A wispy white dress hung loosely from her skeletal frame, giving her the appearance of a mobility-challenged banshee. The weight of a golden broach pulled the front of her dress forward at the collarbone, revealing the outlines of her upper ribs through thin, liver spotted skin. The accessory was about the size of a golf ball, and it depicted a beetle with what looked like a lotus flower etched onto its wings.

*‚ÄúAnd you are, dear?‚Äù*¬†she asked, settling in front of me by using a levered brake to halt the wheelchair‚Äôs momentum.

Based on the woman‚Äôs command of the other mourners and her wizened appearance, I made an educated guess as to her identity.

*‚ÄúHi‚Ä¶you must be Jom‚Äôs mother?‚Äù*

She nodded, her brow furrowing and her grin melting away as her head tilted up and down. The matriarch studied me intensely, her expression now twisted into one of confusion, like those of the mourners when they first saw me.

Relief fluttered through my chest. I briefly savored the pleasurable rush that came after the anxiety of a calculated risk. Then I smiled, took a generous inhale, and continued, launching into an ad libbed speech I had given countless times before.

*""It is nice finally to meet you. I‚Ä¶I wish it wasn‚Äôt under these circumstances, and I wish I knew your first name, but you know how private Jom can be-‚Äù*

I paused and forced a chuckle, letting tears well up as I broke eye contact - body language that screamed ‚Äú*I‚Äôm struggling to use past tense now that he's dead, oh the sweet misery‚Äù*. A sigh fell from my lips, and then I picked up where I left off.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶you know how private Jom*¬†***could***¬†*be. I‚Äôm Tara. Your son and I were together for the last year or so. What‚Äôs your first name, ma‚Äôam?‚Äù*

Unexpectedly, I watched her eyes widen with some mix of alarm and disbelief.

*‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶it‚Äôs Akila‚Äù*

Without saying anything more, she abruptly pivoted her head and torso around, scanning the room for someone. Akila seemingly couldn‚Äôt locate them in the crowd, so she just started shouting a name.

*‚ÄúHorus! Hoooorus! Could someone bring my grandson over?‚Äù*

The figures closest to us leaped into action, clearly fighting to be the person that fulfilled Akila‚Äôs request. Within seconds, one of the attendees, a hulking middle-aged man with biceps like tree trunks, returned with the kid in the black suit that had been previously leaning against the coffin, practically dragging the miserable looking young man by the wrist to his grandmother.

*‚ÄúAh! There you are, Horus.‚Äù*¬†Akila cooed.

The boy barely responded, giving his elder an affirmative grunt. Before he was pulled from the crowd, I was laser focused on selling my story, constructing answers to questions that hadn‚Äôt even been asked yet. Seeing the anguish dripping off his features broke my concentration.

He looked to be in his early twenties, about six-feet tall, with a shaved head and a half crescent nose ring connecting his nostrils. His eyes were saturated with a deep, reflective sadness, his gaze empty and distant, like he was watching a memory rather than actually seeing anything physically in front of him. The corners of his mouth were collapsed into a rigid, immovable frown, the type of vacant expression that‚Äôs left over only after you‚Äôve already completely exhausted every other painful emotion.

My heart broke for him. Whatever familial weirdness was currently on display, with the perfect white dress code and the inappropriately cheery atmosphere, the kid seemed like he was the only one experiencing genuine grief. His dad was dead, and he looked hurt and alone.

That empathy would last about another ten minutes.

*‚ÄúHorus‚Ä¶this woman, Tara, is claiming to have been with your father, and she‚Äôs showing up here dressed like‚Ä¶dressed like that. Did you know anything about this?‚Äù*

*This might be game over,*¬†I thought to myself.¬†*Need to come up with a way to recover.*

He pointed his empty gaze at me. For a second, his eyes remained cold. But then, like the flash of blinding white light before the explosion of an atomic bomb, his expression instantly brightened and became animated. It wasn‚Äôt recognition that had reignited Horus; it was something else.

It was an idea. I didn‚Äôt know it at the time, but Horus was a pretty damn good improvisor as well.

*‚ÄúYeah, I know her. Dad mentioned her a few times in passing. Told me that she may or may not show up today. He wasn‚Äôt sure whether she really loved him or not, but I think he told her to show up if she did really love him.‚Äù*

He paused, calculating what to say next.

*‚ÄúTara‚Äôs an outsider. Dad wasn‚Äôt sure that we‚Äôd accept her, especially after what happened with Diane.‚Äù*

Akila turned back to me, now stone-faced and deathly serious.

*‚ÄúWell, Tara, is all that true? You‚Äôre here because you loved my son?‚Äù*

I didn‚Äôt have long to contemplate the strangeness that was unfolding in front me, so I acted on instinct.

Terrible call.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶yes! Yes, I loved Jom. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here.‚Äù*

Horus nearly crumbled to the ground, his immovable frown dissipating into a grin swollen with ecstasy.

*‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶well alright then. That‚Äôs very noble of you, to come here of your own volition, espousing your love from my son. Bassel, could you escort Tara to the front? Show her where family sits? The eulogy will be starting in a few minutes.‚Äù*¬†Akila replied.

The brawny gentleman with the tree-trunk biceps walked over, placing one massive arm forward to guide me and the other massive arm on my shoulder, as if to make sure I wasn‚Äôt going anywhere.

Behind me, I heard Horus cackling, doubling over and practically wheezing from whatever he found to be so goddamned funny.

\----------

There was a certain comedy to the way Akila had been positioned to deliver the eulogy. I couldn‚Äôt appreciate the humor of it at the time, with Bassel following me like a shadow, his looming presence causing a veritable chorus of alarm bells to ring loudly in my skull. But, in retrospect, I remember the juxtaposition of her in front of the casket being genuinely funny.

She was just so absurdly small, and the coffin was just so absurdly big. A marble torpedo behind a human earthworm, wrinkled skin flapping up and down as she spewed her ritualistic bullshit into the microphone.

*‚ÄúJom was a wonderful son, a loving father, and a devoted vicar of Khepri.‚Äù*¬†Akila boomed, voice tinged with bursts of static from cheap speaker systems.

*‚ÄúWhen Jom was on death‚Äôs door, we all felt his pain. In terms of renewal, he was without an ideal conduit. We all still grieve the loss of Diane, consumed by heresy, leaving him without love and Horus without a mother.‚Äù*

I turned to Bassel, pointing to my bladder and then pointing to the door. It was a lie; nature wasn‚Äôt calling. Not in that sense, at least. My subconscious was screaming, begging me to get the fuck out of that room through whatever means possible.

*Something is so fucking wrong,*¬†I thought, waiting for Bassel to respond to my pantomiming.

He smiled, but it wasn‚Äôt reassuring. The grin was patronizing, revealing his own bitter amusement rather than his willingness to help, like he was watching his cat trying and failing to jump onto a forbidden table.

The man shook his head¬†*no*¬†a few times, and then placed a hand over my scalp, manually twisting my head back in the direction of Akila.

*‚ÄúLittle did we know, however, that in the nick of time, Jom found love. He was scared to divulge his love to us, because she is an outsider, just as Diane was.

*‚ÄúTara - we‚Äôre very grateful for your love, and your commitment to Jom. As you well know, passionate love is the best conduit. It's easier for Khepri to mold. But, of course, the love of youngest son will do if passionate love isn‚Äôt available. All that is to say, I‚Äôm sure Horus is very grateful, as well.‚Äù*

At that point, my heart was crashing against my rib cage like jackhammer, percussive and relentless. Bassel‚Äôs sturdy hand remained on my head, fixing my gaze on Akila.

Because of that, I couldn‚Äôt look away when the matriarch turned to face me, detailing what was to be my fate.

*‚ÄúYour black night, desolate and bare, will draw the death from Jom, granting him renewal.‚Äù*

Sweat poured over my body, drenching me with sticky fear.

*‚ÄúAre you ready, Tara?‚Äù*

Another white-clad figure appeared behind Akila, wrenching the heavy lid of the casket open.

Inside, Jom‚Äôs desiccated corpse laid flat, arms crossed over his shoulders, naked as the day he was born. But his body only covered half of the available space.

You see, the reason the coffin was so damn large is because it was built to house two separate people. The other half¬†*had*¬†been for Jom‚Äôs son, but now it was designated for me.

They were going to bury me alive in that marble tomb.

As if I even needed it confirmed at that point, I noted that the body had both of their hands. My actual assignment had lost one of his during their tour of Vietnam.

Hank had dropped me off on the wrong day.

When I didn‚Äôt move towards the casket, paralyzed by fear, Akila spoke into the microphone one more time, sharp static crackling through the speakers again like an electric tongue whipping invisibly through the air.

*‚ÄúBassel, it seems like Tara is having a bit of cold feet. Bring her over here, show our conduit how spacious it is inside, next to her beloved.‚Äù*

The man‚Äôs muscular paw pulled my head up, forcing me to my feet.

I tried to brainstorm even a fragment of an exit strategy, but for the second time that day, Horus broke my concentration.

My wife is worried that the used lelit might have ""mold"" or could have ""issues"", but I thought the photos look good and I would ask the seller to make me a shot so he can demonstrate that it works. Not sure what the smarter move is here.

FTR, I have only ever used a lelit anna before and loved it, but Im not a connoisseur ... mostly just want to make a nice latte every morning with good coffee and silky foam whole milk, and I like the ceremony of making it manually (vs one of those fully automatic machines).... Im not sure I'd be trying to dial in the exact perfect shot each time as Id likely never drink it straight, and would 99/100 times opt for a latte.

Also, I like the asthetic of these industrial looking machines and prefer the look of the lelit.

It was so uncomfortable I was googling if I could explode from constipation. 

Okay, so this time around I prepared myself. Full shelf of miralax, stool softeners, fleet enema (should an urgent situation arise again), you name it. I took a few a day prior to my ER and felt okay. Totally cool. This morning I woke up and again felt fine. The nurse hooks up my IV and immediately I feel my stomach make a small gurgle‚Ä¶ I figured I‚Äôm hungry? Fasting overnight and no morning coffee so makes sense, right? Five minutes later I feel a little bubbly, but nothing terrible. Maybe gas? I can hold it for a bit, no problem! Cool. Nurse comes in to take me into the OR and now I‚Äôm spread eagle, bare behind, ass cheeks and hoohaw open wide apart for the nurse, OR tech, embryologist, surgeon, and anesthesiologist to get started. Before I know it I‚Äôm waking up in the recovery area. Totally forgot about my potential back-end problems. Happy to be awake and merrily drinking my juice. Before I leave, I get up from the PACU bed to change clothes and get my bag and what do I see????? Shit stains down the sheets!!! Because how tf could that have come out of me when I feel totally fine, I go and take a closer look at it and get a whiff. OMFG it‚Äôs shit!!! I think I died of humiliation. The good people there never said a word to me but I am 100% sure I must have nuked that OR and taken no prisoners. I‚Äôm so sorry, to my fertility clinic. I feel absolutely terrible. You can add a toxic waste and exposure fee to my tab, as well as a laundering and cleaning fee. And I pray for anyone affected. My husband laughed at me when I told him what happened but I am mortified to show my poopy face back there. Alas, I may die from shame before ever having a viable embryo.

Anywho, I hate infertility and it all sucks so fricken much but hopefully this will make someone in the midst of the struggle smile today. I feel you all, thank you to my nonjudgmental community!",81,1739500099.0,IVF,20,1.0,False

The last assignment I ever accepted nearly got me killed. (Part 1)","*‚ÄúYou sure this is the right place, Hank?‚Äù*¬†I shouted from outside the limousine.

The husky chauffeur didn‚Äôt respond, attention transfixed on his handheld television, fiddling with the antennae to minimize static. A cold October wind howled through the valley, causing the slit of my black dress to flutter against my thigh. Frustration mounted behind my eyes as I waited for an answer, glaring through the passenger‚Äôs side window while shivering from the violent squall.

Getting the sense that he was intentionally ignoring me, I pulled trembling fists from the pockets of my wool coat and improvised a drum solo against the thick glass. My knuckles were so cold that I barely felt them make contact.

The amateur rendition of Van Halen‚Äôs¬†*‚ÄúHot For Teacher‚Äù*¬†was enough to get his attention. A scowl curled up the side of his face. Without moving his eyes away from the blinking screen, Hank leaned over to roll down the window, his beer gut flopping awkwardly over the central console like a pillowcase half filled with maple syrup. He gave the crank two lazy twists, and the window creaked down a few inches.

*‚ÄúRobin - what the fuck is the matter? It‚Äôs the goddamned World Series,‚Äù*¬†he said, pointing at the small TV and acting like I was unaware of that fact. Hank had nearly careened off the road multiple times on the thirty-minute drive over here, seemingly unable to drag his eyes away from the game for more than a handful of seconds at a time.

I felt a myriad of insults thump against the back of my teeth, begging to be unleashed, but I swallowed my annoyance.

*‚ÄúCan you please just look at the sign?‚Äù*¬†I pleaded, gesturing to the name listed above a picture of the deceased.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äô85 wasn‚Äôt our year, but ‚Äò87‚Ä¶‚Äô87 is for The Cardinals‚Ä¶‚Äù*¬†he muttered, still glued to the feed.

*‚ÄúHank, for the love of God, confirm that I‚Äôm walking into the right funeral or I‚Äôm getting back into the car. I was told the guy‚Äôs name was ""‚ÄòJohn‚Äô, not ‚ÄòJom‚Äô. The damn sign says ‚ÄòJom‚Äô.‚Äù*¬†I snapped.

Hank slumped his shoulders with childlike exaggeration and sighed. Reluctantly, he shoved a meaty claw into the breast pocket of his blazer, digging around for the instructions given to him by our escort agency. With a crumpled slip of paper in hand, his pupils finally detached from the game. Hastily, he scanned the name and date.

*‚ÄúLooks right to me,‚Äù*¬†he remarked. Before I could ask to see it too, he spat chewing tobacco that had been resting along his gumline into the slip. My eyes widened in disbelief as I watched Hank wrap the paper around the brown-black ichor, only to then toss the malformed lump into his coffee cup.

*‚ÄúChrist, Hank. You couldn‚Äôt have just handed it to me, like a human being? Or are you not a human being? Maybe you're actually some human-shaped donkey? Does that sound right?‚Äù*

The insult finally brought his eyes to meet mine. Instead of anger, he shot me a threatening grin. A wolf‚Äôs smile, bearing hungry canines in my direction.

*‚ÄúLook, doll - how about you tiptoe those fragile, porcelain feet up to the home‚Äôs concierge and ask about the service? I‚Äôll wait here. If it ain‚Äôt right, we‚Äôll go back to the office.‚Äù*

He expected a sheepish reply, but I sure as shit didn‚Äôt give him one, instead providing a thumbs up with my right hand and a middle finger with my left. I didn‚Äôt scare easy. Not only that, but I‚Äôve been in the escort business long enough to know the difference between an actual predator and a small man making empty threats.

When I turned to walk up the cobblestone path that led to the funeral home, my ears became filled with the sound of Hank slamming his foot down on the accelerator, tires screeching against asphalt. Didn‚Äôt even bother to turn back around, honestly. No point.

*‚ÄúAsshole.‚Äù*¬†I murmured, securing my purse under my arm to prevent it from blowing away as I approached the opulent, repurposed plantation house.

The mansion‚Äôs white pillars loomed over me as I carefully climbed the porch steps, stilettos clacking against the refurbished wood. As I stepped toward the front door, a surge of anxiety unexpectedly sprinted up the length of my spine and planted itself at the top of my neck, crackling around the base of my skull like electricity from an exposed wire. With my heartbeat galloping in my chest, I took a deep breath and twisted the knob, not willing to let nervous energy prevent me from earning my keep.

A lot of what happened to me was out of my control, but I did one thing wrong that day. My gut was screaming for me to turn around. It implored me to sprint back down those stairs and into the street like the devil themself was close behind me, nipping at my heels.

But I ignored the feeling, contorted my face into an expression of grief, and pushed on, unknowingly putting myself into the Cult of the Scarab's crosshairs, intruding on their rite of sacred renewal.

\----------

*‚ÄúRight this way, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù*¬†said the funeral director, leading me into a familiar narrow hallway behind the lobby. Only a week earlier I‚Äôd been at this funeral home, pretending to grieve over someone else. As we walked, I reviewed the details I‚Äôd received concerning the deceased, provided to my agency by his company‚Äôs board of investors.

*Pharmaceutical CFO. Passed in his late sixties. Very private. Had two previous marriages. Right hand was mangled during his tenure in Vietnam, doesn‚Äôt bother with a prosthetic. Months before his death, rumors of him being gay cropped up in the tabloids.*

*I‚Äôm playing his secret lover. An unknown buxom paramour, weeping over the loss of their sugar daddy, dispelling the whispers of his potential homosexuality.*

People purchased my time for an assortment of different reasons. Sometimes, I was hired by the soon-to-be deceased, arriving at their memorial service just to boost the overall number of attendees visibly present and grieving. Other times, the request was more specific and it wasn‚Äôt the deceased who was hiring me.

This was one of those¬†*other times.*

It wasn‚Äôt glamorous work, lying at some poor sap‚Äôs funeral on the behalf of someone else and their interests, but it was much preferable to the labor I performed when I was first hired. Think fishnet stockings and disagreements over the virtues of condom use.

All that said, it'd be disingenuous to say I wasn't proud of myself.

This was my niche, and despite the seediness, it was mine, and I was good at it. Considered an expert, actually. Anyone can show up and be a pretty face in the crowd; a twenty-something with running mascara and a nice ass cartoonishly¬†*boo-hooing*¬†into an open casket. But me? I played the assigned role with tact and nuance. I sold a narrative, and nine times out of ten, my marks bought it.

The key was you needed to be a proficient improviser.

Discretion was the name of the game in my line of work; I rarely got a lot of background information about the deceased to work with. Meant I had to be capable of thinking on my toes - bobbing and weaving through conversations like my life depended on it.

Ironically, though, if I wasn‚Äôt so damn convincing, I might not have ended up almost suffocating to death less than an hour after the funeral concluded.

\----------

I expected all the usual sounds of organized memorial would become audible as we approached the reception hall; sobbing, a pipe organ singing its quiet lamentations, hushed arguments over the division of an inheritance. Sounds most people associated with deep sorrow. To me, however, mourning sounded like work. It was ambient noise I had become so accustomed to that I barely even noticed it.

But that‚Äôs not what I heard as we drew closer to the service. Quite the opposite, actually. Joyful sounds reverberated down the hallway. As the funeral director opened the door to the reception hall, I heard laughing and the clinking of glasses. The sparkling timbre of a wedding filled my ears, not the joyless dirge of a wake.

I stepped in, and for a moment, I truly believed I was walking in on some kind of themed birthday party. Every attendee sported a pure white outfit, head to toe. The previously jubilant noise fizzled out into dead silence when they saw me enter, adorned in funerary black. I was nearly about to excuse myself back through the door when I spied a young man at the opposite end of the vast room, dressed in a black three-piece suit, leaning wearily against an enormous marble coffin.

*‚ÄúIs‚Ä¶is this Jom‚Äôs funeral?‚Äù*¬†I managed to sputter out into the motionless crowd.

The fifty or so funeral goers remained silent. I could tell that something about my arrival was intensely befuddling, with looks of confusion painted over the attendee‚Äôs faces. Eventually, the shrill squeaking of poorly lubricated metal wheels broke the silence. The crowd parted to reveal an elderly woman in a wheelchair pushing herself towards me. She peered from side-to-side as she approached, observing the still petrified mourners staring at me with a look of disapproval.

*‚ÄúOh, would you relax? Go back to what you were doing. I‚Äôll figure it out. Khepri save us, y‚Äôall would be startled shitless by a ladybug if it flew at you too fast,‚Äù*¬†she croaked. Slowly, the figures in white pulled their attention away from me, and the lively chatter resumed, albeit at a much lower volume.

With the funeral reanimated, the elderly woman brought her eyes to mine, converting her scowl into a toothy grin. A wispy white dress hung loosely from her skeletal frame, giving her the appearance of a mobility-challenged banshee. The weight of a golden broach pulled the front of her dress forward at the collarbone, revealing the outlines of her upper ribs through thin, liver spotted skin. The accessory was about the size of a golf ball, and it depicted a beetle with what looked like a lotus flower etched onto its wings.

*‚ÄúAnd you are, dear?‚Äù*¬†she asked, settling in front of me by using a levered brake to halt the wheelchair‚Äôs momentum.

Based on the woman‚Äôs command of the other mourners and her wizened appearance, I made an educated guess as to her identity.

*‚ÄúHi‚Ä¶you must be Jom‚Äôs mother?‚Äù*

She nodded, her brow furrowing and her grin melting away as her head tilted up and down. The matriarch studied me intensely, her expression now twisted into one of confusion, like those of the mourners when they first saw me.

Relief fluttered through my chest. I briefly savored the pleasurable rush that came after the anxiety of a calculated risk. Then I smiled, took a generous inhale, and continued, launching into an ad libbed speech I had given countless times before.

*""It is nice finally to meet you. I‚Ä¶I wish it wasn‚Äôt under these circumstances, and I wish I knew your first name, but you know how private Jom can be-‚Äù*

I paused and forced a chuckle, letting tears well up as I broke eye contact - body language that screamed ‚Äú*I‚Äôm struggling to use past tense now that he's dead, oh the sweet misery‚Äù*. A sigh fell from my lips, and then I picked up where I left off.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶you know how private Jom*¬†***could***¬†*be. I‚Äôm Tara. Your son and I were together for the last year or so. What‚Äôs your first name, ma‚Äôam?‚Äù*

Unexpectedly, I watched her eyes widen with some mix of alarm and disbelief.

*‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶it‚Äôs Akila‚Äù*

Without saying anything more, she abruptly pivoted her head and torso around, scanning the room for someone. Akila seemingly couldn‚Äôt locate them in the crowd, so she just started shouting a name.

*‚ÄúHorus! Hoooorus! Could someone bring my grandson over?‚Äù*

The figures closest to us leaped into action, clearly fighting to be the person that fulfilled Akila‚Äôs request. Within seconds, one of the attendees, a hulking middle-aged man with biceps like tree trunks, returned with the kid in the black suit that had been previously leaning against the coffin, practically dragging the miserable looking young man by the wrist to his grandmother.

*‚ÄúAh! There you are, Horus.‚Äù*¬†Akila cooed.

The boy barely responded, giving his elder an affirmative grunt. Before he was pulled from the crowd, I was laser focused on selling my story, constructing answers to questions that hadn‚Äôt even been asked yet. Seeing the anguish dripping off his features broke my concentration.

He looked to be in his early twenties, about six-feet tall, with a shaved head and a half crescent nose ring connecting his nostrils. His eyes were saturated with a deep, reflective sadness, his gaze empty and distant, like he was watching a memory rather than actually seeing anything physically in front of him. The corners of his mouth were collapsed into a rigid, immovable frown, the type of vacant expression that‚Äôs left over only after you‚Äôve already completely exhausted every other painful emotion.

My heart broke for him. Whatever familial weirdness was currently on display, with the perfect white dress code and the inappropriately cheery atmosphere, the kid seemed like he was the only one experiencing genuine grief. His dad was dead, and he looked hurt and alone.

That empathy would last about another ten minutes.

*‚ÄúHorus‚Ä¶this woman, Tara, is claiming to have been with your father, and she‚Äôs showing up here dressed like‚Ä¶dressed like that. Did you know anything about this?‚Äù*

*This might be game over,*¬†I thought to myself.¬†*Need to come up with a way to recover.*

He pointed his empty gaze at me. For a second, his eyes remained cold. But then, like the flash of blinding white light before the explosion of an atomic bomb, his expression instantly brightened and became animated. It wasn‚Äôt recognition that had reignited Horus; it was something else.

It was an idea. I didn‚Äôt know it at the time, but Horus was a pretty damn good improvisor as well.

*‚ÄúYeah, I know her. Dad mentioned her a few times in passing. Told me that she may or may not show up today. He wasn‚Äôt sure whether she really loved him or not, but I think he told her to show up if she did really love him.‚Äù*

He paused, calculating what to say next.

*‚ÄúTara‚Äôs an outsider. Dad wasn‚Äôt sure that we‚Äôd accept her, especially after what happened with Diane.‚Äù*

Akila turned back to me, now stone-faced and deathly serious.

*‚ÄúWell, Tara, is all that true? You‚Äôre here because you loved my son?‚Äù*

I didn‚Äôt have long to contemplate the strangeness that was unfolding in front me, so I acted on instinct.

Terrible call.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶yes! Yes, I loved Jom. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here.‚Äù*

Horus nearly crumbled to the ground, his immovable frown dissipating into a grin swollen with ecstasy.

*‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶well alright then. That‚Äôs very noble of you, to come here of your own volition, espousing your love from my son. Bassel, could you escort Tara to the front? Show her where family sits? The eulogy will be starting in a few minutes.‚Äù*¬†Akila replied.

The brawny gentleman with the tree-trunk biceps walked over, placing one massive arm forward to guide me and the other massive arm on my shoulder, as if to make sure I wasn‚Äôt going anywhere.

Behind me, I heard Horus cackling, doubling over and practically wheezing from whatever he found to be so goddamned funny.

\----------

There was a certain comedy to the way Akila had been positioned to deliver the eulogy. I couldn‚Äôt appreciate the humor of it at the time, with Bassel following me like a shadow, his looming presence causing a veritable chorus of alarm bells to ring loudly in my skull. But, in retrospect, I remember the juxtaposition of her in front of the casket being genuinely funny.

She was just so absurdly small, and the coffin was just so absurdly big. A marble torpedo behind a human earthworm, wrinkled skin flapping up and down as she spewed her ritualistic bullshit into the microphone.

*‚ÄúJom was a wonderful son, a loving father, and a devoted vicar of Khepri.‚Äù*¬†Akila boomed, voice tinged with bursts of static from cheap speaker systems.

*‚ÄúWhen Jom was on death‚Äôs door, we all felt his pain. In terms of renewal, he was without an ideal conduit. We all still grieve the loss of Diane, consumed by heresy, leaving him without love and Horus without a mother.‚Äù*

I turned to Bassel, pointing to my bladder and then pointing to the door. It was a lie; nature wasn‚Äôt calling. Not in that sense, at least. My subconscious was screaming, begging me to get the fuck out of that room through whatever means possible.

*Something is so fucking wrong,*¬†I thought, waiting for Bassel to respond to my pantomiming.

He smiled, but it wasn‚Äôt reassuring. The grin was patronizing, revealing his own bitter amusement rather than his willingness to help, like he was watching his cat trying and failing to jump onto a forbidden table.

The man shook his head¬†*no*¬†a few times, and then placed a hand over my scalp, manually twisting my head back in the direction of Akila.

*‚ÄúLittle did we know, however, that in the nick of time, Jom found love. He was scared to divulge his love to us, because she is an outsider, just as Diane was. But, by being here, she has proven herself worthy of Khepri‚Äôs embrace, unlike the heretic.‚Äù*¬†she said, gesturing a bony hand in my direction, long acrylic nails taking the shape of hawk talons.

*‚ÄúTara - we‚Äôre very grateful for your love, and your commitment to Jom. As you well know, passionate love is the best conduit. It's easier for Khepri to mold. But, of course, the love of youngest son will do if passionate love isn‚Äôt available. All that is to say, I‚Äôm sure Horus is very grateful, as well.‚Äù*

At that point, my heart was crashing against my rib cage like jackhammer, percussive and relentless. Bassel‚Äôs sturdy hand remained on my head, fixing my gaze on Akila.

Because of that, I couldn‚Äôt look away when the matriarch turned to face me, detailing what was to be my fate.

After a decade as an online business, we‚Äôve transformed the front of our roastery into a tasting room and coffee shop‚Äîa space designed to slow things down and explore coffee in a more interactive and intentional way.

We‚Äôve got a pour-over bar with tasting flights and single-origin pour-overs, plus an espresso bar. If you‚Äôre into coffee (or just curious!), we‚Äôd love for you to stop by.

To celebrate, we‚Äôre offering a free drip coffee this weekend Feb 15-16 for first-time customers‚Äîjust show this Reddit post!

Hope to see you soon!

This story was originally written in November 2004¬†



The birds twittered and tweeted. The lilacs were in full bloom and the air smelled of spring. The roosters chased the hens and the hens fled, but only out of coyness and modesty. The hens had seen spring before and knew their jobs well. The rooster danced this dance yearly and he too knew all of the steps. There would be baby chicks peeping soon.¬†



In the green pasture the cattle were restless. The steers acted hostile and possessive, as if their bodies were somehow unaware of the missing equipment. The cows, steers, and calves fled, chased, and bantered, although they all knew that all new calves on this farm came from a trailer.¬†



Man sat on the porch which had become his custom and waited for the trucks, trailers, and neighbors to arrive and gather up all of the stock.¬†



By the time that the sun, and dust had settled, the only remaining creatures on the farm were the man and the black dog.¬†



The man sat and rocked listlessly on the porch swing and the dog sat at his feet and waited.¬†



Waiting was what the dog did more than anything and he was willing to wait as long as it took. In the very core of his brain he knew that he and his ancestors had been waiting on, and for man, since they had shared caves, and he wouldn‚Äôt have changed it for anything.¬†



‚ÄúWhen the frost comes again and the leaves turn to gold and red perhaps I will have learned to breathe again without wanting to cry,‚Äù the old man mumbled as he absently scratched the head of the black lab and retreated into the house.¬†



The dog lay down again to wait; occasionally his waiting would be interrupted by the need to drink, or eat, or go to the yard to do his business, but for the most part he waited, and as he waited he thought in the abstract way that dogs do.¬†



His human was called different names by different people but to the black dog he was simply ‚Äòman‚Äô.¬†



The dog was black in color and his name was a simple one. He was called ‚Äôdog‚Äô or ‚Äôblack dog‚Äô, when a longer name was required.¬†



The man and dog had both been smirked at when his name was called, especially if they were in town. Both of them knew it and neither of them really cared. The man didn‚Äôt care much for town, or town people, so the dog didn‚Äôt either.¬†



The dog and the man had been together forever as far as the dog measured time, and their lives had been filled with work and companionship. These are really the only things required for a man or dog to be happy as far as the dog was concerned, and as far as he could see they always had been.¬†

Then things had changed.¬†



The change had happened when the woman was taken away in the white van with all of the lights. The lights had been flashing red and blue into the night, and the van made the most awful noise. The dog had tried to protect his home from the lights and wailing, he had been prepared to bite the men in the funny clothes and would have if the man had not shouted at him. The man had glared at him and yelled ‚Äúdog no !!‚Äù So the dog had sit still and only growled as the men carried the woman off. The dog was pleased to see the van leave, and very sad when the man had left to and he had been told to ‚Äústay‚Äù. The next day the man had returned, without the woman or the van.¬†



The dog and the woman had never been particularly close. The dog did not like or dislike her, any more than he liked or disliked any other creature that he shared the farm with. His loyalty however, lay with the man because that was who he belonged to.¬†



The dog was familiar with the woman because she would sometimes refill his water dish, or if it were very very cold, or rainy, she would sometimes call him into the mud-porch and allow him to sleep there on an old pair of the man‚Äôs coveralls, until the next morning when he and the man would go off to work.¬†



When the man would come they would finally get to do the things the dog had been waiting for all along. They would gather eggs, they would feed the cattle, sometimes they would go to the fields and the man would plow, while the dog lay on the floor-board of the tractor. The best times were when they would go somewhere. The back of the truck was a paradise for the dog. He would stand in the center of the flat bed truck with his nose held high, smells coming faster than he would ever have imagined, eyes watering as the wind and grit blew into them but oblivious to anything other than his nose. Just to think of it even now caused the dog to twitch in his sleep.¬†



Sometimes they had moved cattle from place to place and the dog had helped the man by keeping them all together without causing them to become frightened and panicked. The dog could smell the fear on them and always kept them moving without scaring them too bad. The dog had learned that he could only chase the cattle when the man said, although when he had been a pup he had sometimes chased them just for fun.¬†



But now things were different.¬†



All of the animals were gone. A stranger plowed the fields. The gate had been left open in the fields. The grass grew tall and unkempt, and the paint that has always been shiny and new was now beginning to crack and peel.¬†



The dog had no understanding of what had happened to bring on all of the changes. For many passings of the sun after the van and the woman had left the farm had been visited by many friends and neighbors. Black dog felt like he had done a good job dealing with the people. He had not bitten any of them, and had only growled at some of them. He was a smart dog, he could tell that the man didn‚Äôt want them there but the man had let him know with a look that he wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to chase any of them off. Late at night after all of the people had gone home the man had told him that it would only be a matter of time until they stopped coming. The man had been right because the moon had changed and changed again and no one had come.¬†



The dog and the man didn‚Äôt go anywhere any more. The truck now sat at a crazy angle because one of it‚Äôs tires was flat. The man didn‚Äôt care so neither did the dog. Together, the man and the dog sat on the porch and waited. The man waited for the pain to stop and the dog waited for the man.

¬†

Every day the man would feed him, and fill his water dish, and then he would sit on the porch and swing back and forth. Often the man would drink something that smelled like rotten grapes. The dog wrinkled his nose at the smell and waited.¬†



Time passed as it always did and it was measured as only a dog can measure it. The shadows raced along the ground and morning would turn to noon, noon would march into afternoon, and then surrender to evening. Night would hold court and then be chased away by morning again.

¬†

The dog waited for the man to heal from whatever had wounded him. He could not imagine what it might be as the man didn‚Äôt limp or smell like fever or infection. A dog can tell a lot about his person when they lick them. When black dog licked his human he smelt a little soap, some hamburger helper and a sadness. He could also smell something else. The something was like desperation but worse, as if he were stuck in a trap and couldn‚Äôt get out. Black dog could not place it. He couldn‚Äôt understand it. But he didn‚Äôt like it. He didn‚Äôt like it at all.¬†



Black dog knew about being wounded, and he knew that somehow his man had been.¬†



Once when he was a puppy he had been hit by a car. He had hurt all over. He had drug himself under the porch and that is where he had stayed. After about three days hunger had driven him out and he had begun to hurt a little less. As time passed the pain had become less and less. Eventually the pain had faded, but the memory never did.¬†



‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you this, black dog, I don‚Äôt see how I can go on without her.‚Äù the man said one day to the dog at his feet.

¬†

The dog stood and licked his hand. The taste was really bad and the dog studied his master for a moment. The mans hair was standing up in places on his head that it never had before, and it seemed the master had grown a decent coat of fur on his jaws and face. But even by the standards of a dog the fur was matted and filthy. The lick had been shocking. The man smelled more like an animal than black dog ever had. There was no taste of soap or cologne. The smell of desperation had begun to fade, and the other one without a name was much stronger. The dog didn‚Äôt care for any of these developments at all but he stood and wagged his tail in appreciation of this small bit of affection. The man again ignored his dog and went back to rocking and drinking from his cup of rotten grapes. The dog again settled down to wait. He waited and waited..¬†



The shadows passed and sometimes the man would fall asleep on his swing, he would snooze the entire night away. Once in awhile the dog would wake up to find his master humming a song and peeing over the porch rail into the weed filled flower bed. He seemed to notice the dog less and less and the dog would have to lean heavily against the mans leg and even whine to remind him that he needed some food and water.¬†



As the weather heated up the man became thinner and thinner. Black dog wondered if he might have a worm.

¬†

One day the man carried something new to the porch with him. In one hand he carried the bottle of rotten grapes and in the other was what the dog could only think of as the ‚Äòblack thing‚Äô.¬†



The dog didn‚Äôt know for sure what the ‚Äòblack thing ‚Äò was but he knew he didn‚Äôt like it. It was cold and hard, it reeked of smoke and made a very loud noise as the man pointed it at the empty bottles in the front yard.¬†



Now every day the man would come to the porch with his bottle of rotten grapes and the black thing. He would rock and hum and drink from his bottle. His eyes leaked all the time and black dog began to wonder if the man had forgotten him completely. Black dog waited..¬†



One night the dog on the porch did not sleep. The man was walking around his den and doing something. A good dog won‚Äôt sleep while his master is awake so the dog prowled back and forth outside while the man prowled back and forth inside.¬†



As the dog watched the sun break into another dawn he realized that summer had passed. The leaves in the early morning light had begun to turn red and gold and the frost looked a little like smoke as the sun burned it off of the grass.¬†



After awhile the man came out of the house and the dog was so thrilled and surprised that he wagged his tail so hard that the whole back end of him waved from side to side.¬†



The fur had been scratched off of the man‚Äôs cheeks. His clothes were clean, his hair was neat and combed. In his hand he held a heaping bowl of scrambled eggs, black dog couldn‚Äôt help it. He began to drool. The man held a hot cup of coffee in his other hand.¬†



With joy in his voice he said ‚ÄúHey Boy!‚Äù and the dog rushed over to lick his hand.¬†



Black dog jerked his head back as if he had been slapped. He snorted several times to clear out his sinuses and even then wrinkled his nose so much that his teeth showed. The taste was cologne and soap but it barely covered the other smell, the black smell, the smell like ashes and rot.

¬†

The dog was confused and worried, but that did not affect his appetite. He ate the eggs and licked the bowl clean. While he ate the man stroked his fur, and scratched his head. The dog could tell things were getting ready to change again. He held his nose high as if smelling the first cold front of the new season.¬†



Some time passed and the man went back into his den, he carried the bowl with him. Black dog took some comfort from the clinking that came from the kitchen. That was a sound he hadn‚Äôt heard for a long , long time.¬†



Some more time passed and the man again came to the porch. The man had the ‚Äòblack thing‚Äô in his hand.¬†



This morning it looked more blue than black and smelled much less like smoke and more like oil. It was still bad but not as bad as it had been.¬†



‚ÄúShe‚Äôs calling me boy.. She‚Äôs been calling me.. And today I‚Äôve got to go..‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm gonna do you right.. I‚Äôm not gonna leave you.""



‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking you with me.. We‚Äôre going home..‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúCome here boy.. Come here..‚Äù¬†



With a look of love and adoration black dog went to his master. His tail was wagging and he never even heard the shot.¬†



He didn‚Äôt hear the second shot either.¬†

https://cyberscoop.com/cyberattack-hits-georgia-county-at-center-of-voting-software-breach/

‚ÄúThe computer infrastructure of a Georgia county at the center of an effort to falsely claim that the state‚Äôs 2020 presidential election was marked by fraud was struck by a cyberattack earlier this month that prompted state officials to sever Coffee County‚Äôs access to statewide election systems. 

In a statement Friday, the Coffee County Board of Commissioners said that the county was notified by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on April 15 about unusual cyber activity in Coffee County‚Äôs IT infrastructure.‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄúWe took immediate action on April 16th, before Coffee County would acknowledge the issue, and cut them off from all of our systems immediately,‚Äù said Mike Hassinger, a spokesman for Georgia Secretary of State Raffensperger.‚Äù

They had access for a whole day to state wide voter info.

‚ÄúThe breach in Coffee County is the second incident in Georgia in which IT infrastructure has been breached in counties where former President Donald Trump or his allies are embroiled in legal battles related to his effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election.‚Äù


https://cyberscoop.com/georgia-election-officials-withheld-evidence-in-voting-machine-breach-group-alleges/
Then they with held evidence in the cases.

Georgia-based nonprofit that is suing the Coffee County, Georgia Board of Elections over an alleged breach of voting software weeks before President Joe Biden was sworn into office is asking a judge to sanction officials involved in the case, saying in new court filings that they repeatedly stonewalled and withheld crucial evidence during discovery.

In a 274-page filing submitted Tuesday, the group claims that Coffee County election officials withheld emails outlining what they knew about the alleged breach, relevant communications between the board and a lawyer associated with ‚ÄúStop the Steal‚Äù legal efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, and security camera footage of forensic experts visiting the Coffee County office where voting software was copied.


Although the breach dates back to 2021, neither the Georgia Bureau of Investigation or federal law enforcement have brought formal charges against any of the parties allegedly involved.

https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2023/09/02/politics/georgia-coffee-county-breach-voters

‚ÄúProsecutors allege that former county Republican Party chair Cathy Latham and former elections supervisor Misty Hampton helped to facilitate employees from a firm hired by Trump attorneys to access and copy sensitive voter data and election software. Surveillance video captured Latham waving the visitors inside, and Hampton in the office as they allegedly accessed the data. Both have pleaded not guilty.

Mike Clark, owner of some small businesses in Douglas, said he was struck by the way the surveillance footage showed the election officials entering the building in broad daylight. ‚ÄúYou walk inside the voter registration office with no mask on, and they just give you the votes. They just give them to you! Why? Why would that be?‚Äù Clark said. ‚ÄúThat shows you right there it ain‚Äôt just started. It‚Äôs always been just like that.‚Äù

https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2023/08/13/politics/coffee-county-georgia-voting-system-breach-trump

‚ÄúGeorgia prosecutors have messages showing Trump‚Äôs team is behind voting system breach‚Äù



Edit sorry for the formatting I made this on mobile.

This is insane. Free and fair election‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ sure. Why wasn‚Äôt this brought up ever in the debate? Why wasn‚Äôt this the only ad Kamala/Biden ran. There is no way they are not complicit for not bringing this up every time they were asked a question‚Ä¶.



Just read another article this one is EVEN WORSE:

https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/03/trump-infiltrate-voting-machines-georgia-2020.html#

While reporters were preoccupied with the spicier allegations threatening to derail the Fulton County DA‚Äôs case, the little-watched three-and-a-half-week trial revealed new information about the scope of the plot to take voting system software in Georgia by election deniers, and the jaw-dropping lack of action by Secretary of State Raffensperger to respond.

During the trial the plaintiffs presented substantial evidence showing that anyone paying attention would have noticed something was quite amiss in Coffee County, and that should have triggered an investigation by Raffensperger‚Äôs office, but didn‚Äôt. (Some of this evidence is outlined in an earlier Slate article.)

But the trial also revealed new information about attempts to gain access to Georgia‚Äôs voting machines in other counties. Plaintiffs revealed an email chain that showed that the election supervisor in Butts County had been contacted by Georgia‚Äôs (now) Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, requesting a forensic examination of the county‚Äôs voting software. (Willis‚Äô criminal investigation of Jones was derailed when she was disqualified from the case by a conflict of interest.) Bartow County‚Äôs election supervisor testified that he‚Äôd been asked by his local GOP chair‚Äîand several unidentified attorneys‚Äîfor access to copy his county‚Äôs election software. He replied with a hard no, and reported it to the secretary of state‚Äôs office.

Plaintiffs also presented a text message from a former member of the Coffee County Board of Elections to the attorney for neighboring Ware County, with a link to a story from the Gateway Pundit. The story claimed that the Trump team had obtained a voting machine from Ware, and the message said, ‚ÄúYou have anyone to verify through?‚Äù The Ware county attorney responds, ‚ÄúI will verify,‚Äù and responds with a jpeg labeled ‚Äúware-county-confirmation,‚Äù but the actual image was never provided to the plaintiffs, and can‚Äôt be viewed.

And yet, even with multiple attempts to access voting systems, which the secretary was alerted to, witnesses from the secretary‚Äôs office testified that there was no investigation opened into any of these events.

The lack of any investigation by the secretary‚Äôs office looks even worse when juxtaposed with a video of Raffensperger‚Äôs top aide, Gabe Sterling, dismissively telling an audience at the Carter Center in April 2022 that the alleged voting system intrusions in Ware and Coffee counties conclusively did not happen. How could the secretary‚Äôs office determine that the breaches didn‚Äôt happen when it didn‚Äôt even look?

It gets worse. Back in early 2022, when plaintiffs first presented evidence that the breach in Coffee County had likely occurred, the secretary of state claimed to the public and the court that an investigation had been opened.

But during the trial, the secretary‚Äôs investigator assigned to the Coffee County breach allegations testified that he had been told to ‚Äúhold off,‚Äù and that the secretary‚Äôs office never actually did any investigation of the Coffee County breach.

After months of holding off, the secretary‚Äôs investigators turned the matter over to the Georgia Bureau of Investigations and the state attorney general. The GBI has since been excoriated for doing a ‚Äúbadly inadequate‚Äù job, and the Georgia attorney general has not charged anyone involved.‚Äù

How did she not challenge at least in GA. There has to be something else going on‚Ä¶.. ",31,1739499590.0,somethingiswrong2024,8,0.92,False
1ip04ou,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ip04ou/friend_going_through_a_mental_health_crisis/,Friend going through a mental health crisis,"Hi Everyone,

A close friend of mine is going through a tough time and I need to offer support, keep firm boundaries, and generally just need some advice.

A couple weeks ago he mentioned that his family (he lives in a building his grandmother owns and his family lives on the other floors, he has the top floor apartment.) was having a ""sleepover"" the night before and he hadn't gotten any sleep. He was very upset by this but I chalked it up to it's a Latino family, they like to party and be loud, he doesn't drink so they don't invite him sometimes, whatever.

But, later in the week he told me that they've done this *every night* and they're doing it just to drive him nuts. I thought it a bit odd but didn't want to get involved in a family situation so just let it go. But then he started telling me that his family had escalated things. He said they were controlling the volume of his television, pressing up on the floorboards beneath his feet so he'd trip, whispering in a targeted way so he can hear it through the walls...

Then, last weekend, he called and asked if he could stay over for the night to get away from what was happening. I told him that that would be OK. He came in like a whirlwind, obviously flustered but sober (we are both in recovery). He told me that his family had hacked all his devices and that they'd been following him from place to place. I told him I wanted to go get a cup of coffee and he freaked out a bit, thinking I was taking him somewhere to be committed.

Several times I told him that this was a safe space, no one else was here, I'd not been in touch with his family... Anyways he pulled out his phone after telling me for about an hour about all the ways his family has been ""harassing"" him to show me all the ""evidence"" that he had. This is where things get concerning, he pulled out his phone and opened it up, and just jabbed around at it for a few minutes like he'd never used a phone before! Opening up menus, messing with settings, turning systems on and off, just flipping back and forth over and over. I saw this and thought ""this must be what he's been doing all week, and the 'hacking' must be in his head.""

Then he left at like 3 in the morning but left his laptop and computer charging offline in my apartment.

Then this weekend he showed up again, saying he wanted to show me on his phone how his family was hacking him. He came up to my place and again was jabbing at his phone like he'd never seen one before. He tried to call me and it went through and he immediately hung up and was like ""SEE?"" and I was like dude? See what?

Then I listened to him tell me about how they've been following him around, he'd been staying at hotels around town and they'd followed him and were in the room next to him. I asked him if he'd seen them. He had not. I asked him if he'd spoken to them. Not face to face. Ok, but he said he ""told them to back off, and told them he'd go to the police."" And I asked him ""So, when you say you 'told them' it was just you, in a room by yourself talking out loud and they can hear you because they're 'there?'"" This flustered him.

Then I told him that I was gonna give him some tough love, that I thought he was having a paranoid crisis, that I think he needs some serious help. And he freaked out. He said they're recording all his conversations, they know who I am, they'll use what I said against him. I told him what does it matter if they know who I am? I'm just his friend. There's no conspiracy I'm wrapped up in, I'm not involved in this at all, so why does it matter?

Then yesterday his Mom called me. She's very concerned. She says the family is NOT stalking him, that he's been hearing voices and acting erratically. She also agrees that he's not using. She found some Butane Fuel cannisters at his place, and a space heater was on, which I found very concerning.

She's asked me to help, and I don't know what to do. Are there any resources for people with schizophrenia? Is there any way I can intervene on his behalf and get him some help?

He does not want to go to a hospital and is convinced his family is harassing him.

We are in NYC if that helps.

Now I get approached by karens and they tell me to leave or buy something when all I came for was to pee and sit down in some heat/ac to use mediocre wifi to work on stuff.

If I'm not even looking your way, head down, focused on business, why do you feel the need to come karen me and say ""buy my hyperprocessed garbage or leave""? I know it's a private business and I can respect that and leave quickly and politely, but if I might as well be a fly on the wall, why go out of your way to kick me out? Really seems unnecessarily confrontational if nobody is breathing down your neck to do so.

So I'm done with starbucks and I hope yall are with me. I feel better using libraries I pay tax dollars for, I just don't like driving 10-15 more minutes if I don't have to just for wifi.

His human was called different names by different people but to the black dog he was simply ‚Äòman‚Äô.¬†



The dog was black in color and his name was a simple one. He was called ‚Äôdog‚Äô or ‚Äôblack dog‚Äô, when a longer name was required.¬†



The man and dog had both been smirked at when his name was called, especially if they were in town. Both of them knew it and neither of them really cared. The man didn‚Äôt care much for town, or town people, so the dog didn‚Äôt either.¬†



The dog and the man had been together forever as far as the dog measured time, and their lives had been filled with work and companionship. These are really the only things required for a man or dog to be happy as far as the dog was concerned, and as far as he could see they always had been.¬†

Then things had changed.¬†



The change had happened when the woman was taken away in the white van with all of the lights. The lights had been flashing red and blue into the night, and the van made the most awful noise. The dog had tried to protect his home from the lights and wailing, he had been prepared to bite the men in the funny clothes and would have if the man had not shouted at him. The man had glared at him and yelled ‚Äúdog no !!‚Äù So the dog had sit still and only growled as the men carried the woman off. The dog was pleased to see the van leave, and very sad when the man had left to and he had been told to ‚Äústay‚Äù. The next day the man had returned, without the woman or the van.¬†



The dog and the woman had never been particularly close. The dog did not like or dislike her, any more than he liked or disliked any other creature that he shared the farm with. His loyalty however, lay with the man because that was who he belonged to.¬†



The dog was familiar with the woman because she would sometimes refill his water dish, or if it were very very cold, or rainy, she would sometimes call him into the mud-porch and allow him to sleep there on an old pair of the man‚Äôs coveralls, until the next morning when he and the man would go off to work.¬†



When the man would come they would finally get to do the things the dog had been waiting for all along. They would gather eggs, they would feed the cattle, sometimes they would go to the fields and the man would plow, while the dog lay on the floor-board of the tractor. The best times were when they would go somewhere. The back of the truck was a paradise for the dog. He would stand in the center of the flat bed truck with his nose held high, smells coming faster than he would ever have imagined, eyes watering as the wind and grit blew into them but oblivious to anything other than his nose. Just to think of it even now caused the dog to twitch in his sleep.¬†



Sometimes they had moved cattle from place to place and the dog had helped the man by keeping them all together without causing them to become frightened and panicked. The dog could smell the fear on them and always kept them moving without scaring them too bad. The dog had learned that he could only chase the cattle when the man said, although when he had been a pup he had sometimes chased them just for fun.¬†



But now things were different.¬†



All of the animals were gone. A stranger plowed the fields. The gate had been left open in the fields. The grass grew tall and unkempt, and the paint that has always been shiny and new was now beginning to crack and peel.¬†



The dog had no understanding of what had happened to bring on all of the changes. For many passings of the sun after the van and the woman had left the farm had been visited by many friends and neighbors. Black dog felt like he had done a good job dealing with the people. He had not bitten any of them, and had only growled at some of them. He was a smart dog, he could tell that the man didn‚Äôt want them there but the man had let him know with a look that he wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to chase any of them off. Late at night after all of the people had gone home the man had told him that it would only be a matter of time until they stopped coming. The man had been right because the moon had changed and changed again and no one had come.¬†



The dog and the man didn‚Äôt go anywhere any more. The truck now sat at a crazy angle because one of it‚Äôs tires was flat. The man didn‚Äôt care so neither did the dog. Together, the man and the dog sat on the porch and waited. The man waited for the pain to stop and the dog waited for the man.

¬†

Every day the man would feed him, and fill his water dish, and then he would sit on the porch and swing back and forth. Often the man would drink something that smelled like rotten grapes. The dog wrinkled his nose at the smell and waited.¬†



Time passed as it always did and it was measured as only a dog can measure it. The shadows raced along the ground and morning would turn to noon, noon would march into afternoon, and then surrender to evening. Night would hold court and then be chased away by morning again.

¬†

The dog waited for the man to heal from whatever had wounded him. He could not imagine what it might be as the man didn‚Äôt limp or smell like fever or infection. A dog can tell a lot about his person when they lick them. When black dog licked his human he smelt a little soap, some hamburger helper and a sadness. He could also smell something else. The something was like desperation but worse, as if he were stuck in a trap and couldn‚Äôt get out. Black dog could not place it. He couldn‚Äôt understand it. But he didn‚Äôt like it. He didn‚Äôt like it at all.¬†



Black dog knew about being wounded, and he knew that somehow his man had been.¬†



Once when he was a puppy he had been hit by a car. He had hurt all over. He had drug himself under the porch and that is where he had stayed. After about three days hunger had driven him out and he had begun to hurt a little less. As time passed the pain had become less and less. Eventually the pain had faded, but the memory never did.¬†



‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you this, black dog, I don‚Äôt see how I can go on without her.‚Äù the man said one day to the dog at his feet.

¬†

The dog stood and licked his hand. The taste was really bad and the dog studied his master for a moment. The mans hair was standing up in places on his head that it never had before, and it seemed the master had grown a decent coat of fur on his jaws and face. But even by the standards of a dog the fur was matted and filthy. The lick had been shocking. The man smelled more like an animal than black dog ever had. There was no taste of soap or cologne. The smell of desperation had begun to fade, and the other one without a name was much stronger. The dog didn‚Äôt care for any of these developments at all but he stood and wagged his tail in appreciation of this small bit of affection. The man again ignored his dog and went back to rocking and drinking from his cup of rotten grapes. The dog again settled down to wait. He waited and waited..¬†



The shadows passed and sometimes the man would fall asleep on his swing, he would snooze the entire night away. Once in awhile the dog would wake up to find his master humming a song and peeing over the porch rail into the weed filled flower bed. He seemed to notice the dog less and less and the dog would have to lean heavily against the mans leg and even whine to remind him that he needed some food and water.¬†



As the weather heated up the man became thinner and thinner. Black dog wondered if he might have a worm.

¬†

One day the man carried something new to the porch with him. In one hand he carried the bottle of rotten grapes and in the other was what the dog could only think of as the ‚Äòblack thing‚Äô.¬†



The dog didn‚Äôt know for sure what the ‚Äòblack thing ‚Äò was but he knew he didn‚Äôt like it. It was cold and hard, it reeked of smoke and made a very loud noise as the man pointed it at the empty bottles in the front yard.¬†



Now every day the man would come to the porch with his bottle of rotten grapes and the black thing. He would rock and hum and drink from his bottle. His eyes leaked all the time and black dog began to wonder if the man had forgotten him completely. Black dog waited..¬†



One night the dog on the porch did not sleep. The man was walking around his den and doing something. A good dog won‚Äôt sleep while his master is awake so the dog prowled back and forth outside while the man prowled back and forth inside.¬†



As the dog watched the sun break into another dawn he realized that summer had passed. The leaves in the early morning light had begun to turn red and gold and the frost looked a little like smoke as the sun burned it off of the grass.¬†



After awhile the man came out of the house and the dog was so thrilled and surprised that he wagged his tail so hard that the whole back end of him waved from side to side.¬†



The fur had been scratched off of the man‚Äôs cheeks. His clothes were clean, his hair was neat and combed. In his hand he held a heaping bowl of scrambled eggs, black dog couldn‚Äôt help it. He began to drool. The man held a hot cup of coffee in his other hand.¬†



With joy in his voice he said ‚ÄúHey Boy!‚Äù and the dog rushed over to lick his hand.¬†



Black dog jerked his head back as if he had been slapped. He snorted several times to clear out his sinuses and even then wrinkled his nose so much that his teeth showed. The taste was cologne and soap but it barely covered the other smell, the black smell, the smell like ashes and rot.

¬†

The dog was confused and worried, but that did not affect his appetite. He ate the eggs and licked the bowl clean. While he ate the man stroked his fur, and scratched his head. The dog could tell things were getting ready to change again. He held his nose high as if smelling the first cold front of the new season.¬†



Some time passed and the man went back into his den, he carried the bowl with him. Black dog took some comfort from the clinking that came from the kitchen. That was a sound he hadn‚Äôt heard for a long , long time.¬†



Some more time passed and the man again came to the porch. The man had the ‚Äòblack thing‚Äô in his hand.¬†



This morning it looked more blue than black and smelled much less like smoke and more like oil. It was still bad but not as bad as it had been.¬†



‚ÄúShe‚Äôs calling me boy.. She‚Äôs been calling me.. And today I‚Äôve got to go..‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm gonna do you right.. I‚Äôm not gonna leave you.""



‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking you with me.. We‚Äôre going home..‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúCome here boy.. Come here..‚Äù¬†



With a look of love and adoration black dog went to his master. His tail was wagging and he never even heard the shot.¬†



He didn‚Äôt hear the second shot either.¬†

Diagnosis:
GERD
POTS
Moderate Mitral valve regurge

Medications, Ect. 
2.5 Midodrine
40 mg pantoprozale 
40 mg propranolol 2x daily
Nexplanon BC implant
Women‚Äôs vitamin gummy 1x daily


Small recap, I went in to the doctor for severe acid reflux about 3 years ago. I was throwing up, gagging, burping, and having upper abnominal pain every day for about 2 weeks before going in. During this time my doctor asked me about other problems and I told her about reoccurring dizzy spells and intolerance to exercise (a previous urgent care visit told me that this was just due to low blood pressure because I was a skinny young woman and to hydrate). I told her that I drink the recommended about of water, added more electrolytes and sodium  to my diet, and still no improvement so I just dealt with it but the heart burn was hard to ignore. She send me to get an ekg and then I was tested for H. Pylori(neg) and full blood panel (also neg). My ekg was abnormal, so they had me do an echo and found the leakage. I‚Äôve been told by 1 dr and 2 practitioners that this leakage wasn‚Äôt alarming and to not do anything about it. I was told my 2 drs the exact opposite so now I have annual echos where no change has been shown. I take the midodrine and propranolol to help with my symptoms and pre syncope but they don‚Äôt help much. I have a stress test scheduled in a week to follow up. For the GERD I had a colonoscopy and endoscopy due to coffee ground puke about 4 months after initial visit. Nothing found, put me on pantoprozale where my issues were stagnant but not as bad. Dr told me to come off my medication 1.5 yrs later, I did this and my problems came back on immediately. Went back on the meds and now they are way more prominent. Another endoscopy and I now have ulcers and they cause me extreme pain and put me in the ER 3x where I had a CT and all they could see was swelling in my upper digestive track. And 1 of those times they saw signs of colitis. I have my 3rd endoscopy in a month. I recently had a 2nd annual Pap (my last was abnormal but they didn‚Äôt do anything about it and said to come again in a yr since i was so young?) and this one was also abnormal. They also did an internal exam and the dr was surprised at the amount of pain it caused me and said she felt a lot of swelling around my ovaries. I‚Äôve had pain with intercourse for a few months and spotting and therefore just refrain from it. Transvaginal ultrasound scheduled on monday. I‚Äôm damn lucky to have good insurance through my mom‚Äôs work at this point. 

I feel like every time I turn around i‚Äôm having more issues. My diet at this point is extremely bland. I quit vaping 2 years ago to help with my issues. I drink lots of water, I stay under 1700 calories and try to do light exercise but I WILL pass out if I‚Äôm not careful. I can‚Äôt regulate my temperature, I can‚Äôt lift my arms above my heard without losing sight and/or passing out. I‚Äôm having lower and upper abnomal pain constantly. The ulcers were so painful I was buckled over and crying every couple minutes like contractions. Is there anyway these issues are interconnected? Is there anything i can try or a route I can go that isn‚Äôt been done yet? 

Small notes: I had covid 3 years ago. Issues seemed to get worse after that. Was never vaccinated for it. Only surgery i‚Äôve ever had was a tonsillectomy 2 years ago due to reoccurring tonsillitis and swelling my entire life. Had asthma when I was younger and in HS but nolonger feel I struggle with it. I was diagnosed with POTS after the echo during a tilt table test and all my cardiologist have confirmed it does seem to be real due to the tachycardia spikes when I move into different positions, they don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs related to the leakage.

Thank you so much for being a constant presence during my undergraduate and postgraduate studies. Thanks to you and Lorelai, I became a coffee addict and a fan of snow. These skills were important because as a brown Latina immigrant girl who has spent half of her life living in snowy places, studying for more than a decade and following my nerdy dreams- I wouldn't have gotten through it if I didn't fall in love with black coffee and say ""I smell snow."" 

I know you made a lot of mistakes in your life, and made terrible choices. I would never participate in an affair or become impregnated by some random or ex of mine. But watching you do all the things- watching you be super successful, a super failure, and all the things in between- has made me love myself more. 

Every time I watch the show I learn something new about you- but also about myself. My life as an adult has not always consisted of successes. I am deeply afraid not just of the outcome of my own career but also of the state of the country. I know you would be so furious to know who is president today and also at the state of journalism and the media. I know people didn't like the ending of the show- but the moral of the story has never been more clear to me than today- as I see so many women find it so difficult to like you.   
  
We are not just our success (academic or otherwise). We are our relationships. We can get through any situation, no matter how dire, because of unconditional love (and great boundaries with toxic people!). Lorelai was not a perfect mom (or friend!)- but when I watch the show- it feels like she is my mom. That I won't come home to be yelled at or be put down for the crazy things I do with my life. We will briefly escape reality and eat some junk food, and be imperfect. We will have heart-to-hearts, and support each other in our dreams. And being a feminist won't feel like it does today sometimes- a deeply isolating experience where you feel like a total psycho for supporting women's basic rights. It will just be fun! In a town where people love each other and respect the importance of local governance and local journalism. And relationships. 

Thanks for reading you guys\~ Just felt like defending my girl today. 

Love you Alexis Bledel!

1ip0165,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ip0165/have_i_been_raised_by_a_narcissist_or_is_this_all/,Have I been raised by a narcissist or is this all my fault?,"Hello everybody. I've recently gone through a lot of changes in my life that have left me feeling lost and alone. I reckon it's easiest to start from the beginning. It's a long story, so bear with me.

I feel like my mom and her family have been abusive to me for my entire life, but it's hard for me to say that because I know that I was a difficult child. We would get in screaming matches about my bedtime and going to school constantly, I hated both. I don't have a lot of happy memories about my childhood, and the few that I do have are overshadowed by many moments of fear and anger. As long as I can remember, my grandmother (mom's mom) has always told me, ""that's just how she is,"" and, ""you just have to be the bigger person."" And it's felt incredibly invalidating and just plain unfair to feel like the responsibility of keeping the peace and teaching myself to regulate my own emotions has always rested on my shoulders. I've been called manipulative since I was aged in the single-digits.

Our relationship has never seen improvement. We've been at each other's throats for as long as I can remember. When I was 15, my mom stopped working and effectively has not had any source of income since then. When I was 16, I got a job and all financial responsibility fell on me. Around that time, my grandmother told me that my mom viewed me as abusive, and those words have always stuck with me. I don't want to be an abuser; I've said some incredibly cruel things to my mother in moments of anger, and I could've always tried to get a better handle on my emotions. The way I spoke to her got worse as I got older, and I feel ashamed of some of the things I've said to and about her. It's always felt like she has to have the last word, and it feels like arguing with her is a who-can-say-the-meanest-thing contest. It feels like a chicken-or-egg dilemma; who was abusive first? 

Things between us reached a climax about a month and a half ago. We had a fun night out on New Years Eve together, but the following day, I woke up and she was just so angry because my grandmother had called her to wake her up to go grocery shopping. That anger never dissipated, she was just seething, slamming stuff around and growling for days - I holed myself up in my room for the first week of 2025 because I was afraid of starting a confrontation. I finally came out to make us both breakfast that Friday. While I was making the breakfast, an argument started, and I'm not sure whose fault it is. The argument went something like:

Mom: ""I'm sad my hydroxyzine is gone."" (I later found out she had been taking four times her prescribed dose)

Me: ""I've never had Vistaril make me loopy the way it does you."" (we're both prescribed the same dose of hydroxyzine/Vistaril)

Mom: ""I'm *not loopy*.""

Me: ""Well whatever you are, I can tell by the way you're sitting."" (she was fully reclined with one foot on the coffee table and the other on the couch, and her arm resting above her head, full stoner couchlock position)

Mom: ""I'm sitting like this because I'm in constant pain."" (said with much hostility and anger evident)

Me: ""Why are you getting so pressed?""

Mom: ""Because you have no idea what you're talking about.""

Me: ""The bottom line of what I'm saying is that hydroxyzine doesn't affect me the way it affects you, you just want to be contrarian to everything I say.""

Mom: ""Stop analyzing me.""

Me: ""You stop analyzing me.""

And then, she stormed off. A few minutes later, my grandmother calls me and says, ""Do you have a friend's house you can go to or something?"" And in all honesty, I went ballistic. I told her I'm not letting her kick me out like she's been doing every time she's mad at me ever since I was 14. I told my grandmother that she needs to either come pick my mom up or convince her to go to a crisis stabilization unit; grandmother agreed that she needed to go to CSU but stated that my mom never listens to her about those things. I scream some more obscenities about my mom and said some hurtful things to my grandmother as well (""it's YOUR fault she's like this!!""), which I feel remorseful and ashamed of. In all honesty, this argument is probably the angriest I have ever been in my life.   
  
A few minutes after she hung up on me, police knock on the door and immediately say, ""where's the knife?"" and I'm just like, ""what knife? I don't have a knife???"" It turns out, my mom called the cops on me and said that I had a knife. The cops and I had a conversation about what happened, and they seemed to side with me, telling me that I have every right to move out and that I don't have to be around her. She told the cops she wanted to kill herself, so they called an ambulance to take her to the hospital, but she decided not to admit herself and instead returned home while I was at a friend's house. A few days later, she texted me this long paragraph about how she knows she's hurt me and that she's sorry but that she can't be around me and that I'm ""the reason she continues to breathe."" Effectively kicking me out, knowing I had no where to go. 

A few weeks later, my grandmother gave me $50 to by a part to fix my car. Then, she said she needed the money back, so I go on Venmo to send her the money back and saw that she had sent my mother well over $50 to buy weed and fast food. So I told her that I'm not giving her the $50 back, if she needs it that bad, she can ask my mom for it. Again, I'm not proud of this - my train of thought was, ""well why would I subliminally give my mom $50 through my grandmother?"" which, admittedly, is some mental gymnastics.  
  
 I blew up on her again, saying that I was sick of my mom's victim complex, and sick of my grandmother enabling it, sick of watching her baby my mom and holding me to such a high standard when I'm the one who deserves to be babied. About half a week later, I get a text from my uncle (mom's brother) while I'm in class, a long, mean paragraph along the lines of, ""If you can't talk to my mother with respect, don't talk to her at all. I don't want to hear your side because it doesn't matter. Get your shit together, get your head right. If you can't be nice you will be cut out of our lives"" and all sorts of other things. So I responded, ""fuck off"" and blocked his number. I got kicked off the family phone plan after that, I guess symbolizing the end of my relationship with them. 

Neither of my uncles, nor my grandmother, nor my mother have reached out to me since any of this happened. So here I am, with no family in the area, no home (staying in a dorm covered by my university for the semester), feeling lost and alone.   
  
I tried to tell this story openly, from as neutral a point of view as I can, disclosing some of the cruel things I said, because I want to know if I'm the one in the wrong and if I should apologize to them. It feels like with four people all against me, I'm in the wrong, but I also can't help but feel this great sense of injustice against myself. Am I the abusive narcissist with a victim complex here, or are they?
