1ouz8rb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1ouz8rb/i_feel_taken_advantage_of_as_a_photographer/,I feel taken advantage of as a photographer,"I am a hobbyist photographer, with a separate full time job. I often collaborate with friends on photo projects they conceptualize, and up until this point I’ve had no issues because there has been mutual respect and consideration in those projects.

My sister has been dating her partner, “Lily” for about a year and a half. Throughout their relationship I’ve photographed Lily a handful of times, since they engage in a hobby that lends itself well to photography. These projects have primarily been initiated by me, with enthusiasm from Lily because they love being in front of the camera.

Last week, Lily reached out to me about a photo idea including intensive editing they had, with a deadline of delivery by the end of this week since the photos will be used in some promotional material. I agreed to the project because I was interested in the concept Lily shared.

Lily asked if we could do the photos Saturday morning at 10, sure. I am currently carless so I planned to hop on public transit at 9:30. 9:30 rolls around, Lily texts asking if we can push the shoot to 10:30. Fine, that’s within the realm of fashionably late, and I was still home anyway.

10am rolls around, I hop on public transit, with my batteries charged and my memory cards cleared. I arrive to the shoot location, a park, at 10:30. No Lily. They text and say their mom called and they got distracted, but will head out soon. I’m pretty bothered at this point, because the park was in a pretty un-walkable part of town, it’s not like I could easily go grab a coffee from somewhere, and if I did I’d have to pay for public transit again.

Lily finally arrives at 11:45, barely apologizes. We do the shoot and I’m actually really proud of how the photos turn out. We finish shooting and Lily mentions they plan on driving to the cafe my sister works at, and asks if I want to tag along. I say sure and my sister hooks us up with a free lunch, which is nice but not unusual, I visit my sister there all the time and get some free food. Lily then leaves.

I’m feeling pretty upset and like Lily acted in such a solipsistic way, which I’ve noticed they have a pattern of. My entire Saturday morning spent waiting around for them, and they didn’t even offer to give me a ride, send some $ my way for transit, buy me a coffee or anything. I think they feel maybe entitled to my photography because my shoots with my sister, her partner, are some of my most well-known work, but Lily hasn’t earned that kind of entitlement to my photography skills.

I’m torn because I want to work on the photos for my portfolio, but I feel like I’d be rewarding bad behavior if I just give in and send them to Lily, especially by their planned deadline. I also don’t want to cause an issue with my sister because she really loves Lily, but at the same time I don’t think I should accept being treated like this.",1,1762934059.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

What would help?","So my partner (23M) and I (24F) have been together for over 5 years. We get along great and have a really wholesome and loving relationship. There were a lot of moments when we had our disagreements and rough patches but we always managed to figure things out through different methods. We are sort of neurodiverse but on the lighter side of the spectrum. I was severely anxious for years but I've been medicated for a couple of years now. I had been in therapy, assumed to had had adhd (arguable now that I'm medicated for anxiety and feeling awesome). He, on the other hand, has some behaviours associated with autism spectrum/adhd (like dissociating a lot, getting fixated on things, being over sensitive to stimuli). Currently we're both going to therapy. I'm saying all this to give more context to what I'm about to say next but it may as well not be the reason for our problem. 

I tend to pay a lot of attention to neat, tidy spaces. To the point where it drives me mad and spoils my mood when I have a ""sensitive"" day and I see that dirty dishes are on the counter and not in the dishwasher, or there are things scattered around our desk (we have a huge desk we share) that have been there for a couple of days. I feel that my anger sometimes develops into resentment and it genuinely affects our relationship. But there are days where it doesn't affect me, these happen more often. 

I live with his family, they are all really nice people but especially his mum and brother (17M) are very messy and kinda sloppy. His brother breaks things that my partner lets him use, or loses them. He doesnt clean up after cooking (his mum cleans it), brings dirty dishes from his room and puts them on the counter instead of the dishwasher, puts empty bottles on the counter instead of just throwing them away. 
And there are things on daily that are missing from the house because the mum doesn't care to restock on things like washing gel or soap, dish soap, sometimes paper, toothpaste. Things around the house are broken (some cabnets are not opening properly, doors that hard to close or creaking) or dirty (handwashed mugs that have tea/coffee stains, oily pans and pots). His mum buys expensive fruits and let's them rot. There are sometimes multiple things rotting away in the fridge. It's like she doesn't notice things at all or doesn't care.
It's so bizarre to me. Maybe one reason is that I've grown up in a household with a different mindset, my dad was very strict about the mess and he would yell at me and my brother if there were dirty cups in our rooms or on the counter, my mum always had a storage of soaps and detergents and medicine, nothing was ever missing. But at the same time they played a huge part of why I had developed anxiety to begin with.
Which leads up to our problem; my partner doesn't see mess the same way I do. He's threshold is much higher than mine. Unless he trips over things laying on the ground it won't bother him. Much less actual dust or dirt. We have already established cleaning schedule for our common room so that I'm a lot calmer about it and he has something tangible like a date where he needs to do a certain chore. However he's very busy and he often doesn't make time to clean. I don't usually pry into his business in his basement but recently we've started working out there together and the floor hasn't been mopped in probably like half a year and it's all muddy, there are scraps everywhere. I managed to vacuum it and even offered to mop it but had enough after vacuuming and seeing the extend of mess. 
I don't like arguing about it and I'm understanding about difficult things he has to deal with that take up his energy (like he's got an addicted family member and it's bad at the moment, and other problems). But it has always been like this and it's just how he lives. I don't want to treat him like a child and act like a mummy where I need to point things out to him multiple times before he cleans things or he simply gets irritated and says that he has more important problems (which he does tbf). 
Of course I'd like him to change, maybe to get inspired to try and organise his stuff but I don't have high hopes. I'm looking for methods, like more schedules or tricks that worked out for you to keep the household working and tidy. I get it that consistency is key but life is life and sometimes neither of us have enough energy. And some advice for myself to keep cool with the mess despite the urge to clean everything myself. I really value our relationship and want it to be strong, but with underlying resentment over cleaning it might not be possible.",1,1762933918.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

(This is not related to the 666 update I swear I started this before it was announced I swear I swear—). Also I decided I’d try doing this weekly because why not…
Custom effects:
Witherblade: depending on the stack of this effect, the duration of any given stun will increase by 50%. Capping at witherblade VI (400%)
Ember
$888
Sentinel
45 hp.
Regular speed: 12
Sprinting speed: 26
Max stamina: 100
Stamina loss per second: 10
Stamina gain per second: 20
Purchase quote:
“I am what survives the end.”
Description:
“A being forged from fire and erasure, he wields the Oblivion Blade to survive a world that no longer exists. Every strike risks everything, yet keeps him alive.”
Appearance: Ember looks to be a person completely made out of fire with parts of their body “glitched” out. Ember wears what looks to be like an adventuring outfit or what conquistadors wore back in the day. On his back is the oblivion blade, a completely black blade emanating black glitchy particles. On his right waist (belt) is an hourglass while on his left waist is a small flaming dagger. Ember has no face since he’s literally fire.
Passives:
(Cleansing flame):
“LET THE MARTYRS BURN!!!”
 any burning effect on ember heals him instead of dealing damage. The amount healed is equal to the amount he’d take if he’s hit by the burning. If ember is actively getting inflicted with burn this amount increases by 1 damage per dmg (so if he’s hit with 0.35 from burn, if he’s actively getting burned he heals 1.35 instead). Coolkid hard counter XD
(Dispel): 
“With this body of my creator, their chains cannot touch me…”
Ember cannot be inflicted with bleeding, corrupted, or poison. However, each one of these effects is swapped for weakness instead.
(Last stand): 
“I give myself… to survive the end…”
if Ember is the LMS, all his damage dealing abilities instantly begin to deal 2x damage and inflict deletion IV (3% hp decrease per second) for 3 seconds. However, his witherblade is locked at II for the rest of the game. He also gains 50 hp

Abilities:
(Severance/erasure): 
“Just a spark… but it can cut through anything…” (severance)
“Feed the flame… and it will give you life.’… I must endure it, whatever it takes.” (Erasure)
cooldown: 10s for each (this means after using the move which causes it to switch, the player must wait 10s before using the other variant)
Description: Severance causes ember to take out his dagger and do a 0.15s  windup before jabbing forwards. The jab gives ember 2s of speed II if it lands and 1.5s of slow III if it misses (if the distance from killer is > 40 studs changes to 4s). If the stab hits the killer it also knocks the killer back and inflicts slow IV for 2*(1+0.1*witherblade stack) seconds while stunning for 0.3s. It also grants 1 charge of immolation while dealing 25 dmg. If the stab misses ember’s aura is highlighted to the killer for 4s. After using severance the ability switches to erasure. If erasure is used, Ember forcibly erases a part of himself, severing flame from flesh. He gains 40 temporary HP (like max ho and it can stack). This move takes 3 seconds to use. If there are any negative debuffs on ember at this time they are also cleansed. It also creates a small burning area on the ground dealing 0.35 dmg per second to anybody (including the killer and survivors) standing inside it that lasts 3 seconds. This area heals ember instead inflicting burn. The move switches back to severance after. If ember is interrupted while using the ability, it fails but still switches back to severance.

(oblivion blade): 
“Now… witness the end of what should not have survived.”
cooldown: 45 seconds
Description: after 1.2s of windup, ember does a massive leap backwards while doing a spin before rushing forwards with their blade out, launching themselves forwards (similar to two times stab but going farther). Ember while moving can curve, sort of gliding but they can’t move too accurately and he slows down a bit if he’s turning. Ember may also not curve for the first 0.8s of the move however afterwards he could curve freely and even travel backwards like in a U-turn. After traveling for 5s, ember automatically smashes their sword into the ground causing a massive explosion that deals 20 damage to him and causes an aoe blast that if the killer is close enough to, deals 50 damage and stuns for 3 seconds. Unlike two time’s stab though, this slam will not auto activate when hitting the killer. Instead, if the ability is used again early, the slam will activate mid rush. The radius is pretty small so it’s really hard to get this to work. If the slam directly hits though, killers are inflicted with burn II for 4 seconds and blindness III for 8 seconds along with being knocked away and taking 75 damage. The killer also gets stunned for 5 seconds instead along with having their aura revealed to all survivors for 2 second. The radius for this stun is EVEN smaller though. It takes insane precision and prediction to even hope to land this version. If the player misses completely and slams the ground with the killer not even being in the blast radius, they take 30 damage and are forced to sit through a 3 second long animation of ember pulling their blade out the floor. If the slam lands it’s reduced to 1s (so they land the slam and only take 1s to take their blade out). Their aura is also revealed to the killer for 8 seconds if they mess up. The slam does create a small area that inflicts burn II and slow I for anybody standing inside the area like in immolation. This area lingers for 3 seconds. Oh and for balancing purposes if the killer is stunned for more than 10 seconds by an oblivion blade, their stun immunity duration is increased by like 2x increasing by another 1x for every extra 5s. For every additional ember in the match stun time decreases by 0.5s. Move cannot be canceled midway through by the killer by moves except nova, entanglement, gashing wound, and the rush move from guest 666.
(Immolation): 
“If I am to live, the flame must consume me… and I will rise from it.”
cooldown: 10 seconds. Requires a charge for use.
Description: after 0.5s of windup, ember stabs himself causing a massive explosion that deals 40 damage to him and inflicts him with burning I for 4 seconds. If a killer is close enough to ember while he uses this ability, they will be knocked away and stunned for 1.5s seconds, taking 30 damage in the process. Ember also gains speed I for 5 second after use but also weakness V for 8 seconds. In the location Ember used this ability, a small area of fire will linger for 8 seconds inflicting burning I and slowness I on anything that enters (yes even survivors). After the use of this move, ember also gains 1 stack of witherblade.

Intended playstyle: he’s a snowball survivor. The main inspiration behind this survivor is that when the slasher update rolled around two time was literally completely gutted. His so called “hitbox fixes” made trickstabbing pretty much impossible. He was in my opinion the most skilled survivor so I drafted up a concept for what I think is the most rewarding but skill based survivors. His goal is simply to just run up to the killer and help survivors via landing severance. Then he runs off to escape and use erasure before using immolation. He repeats this process surviving the killer each time since literally 2 hits kill him unless he has high erasure. Once he has high witherblade, the killer suffers as a skilled ember can stun them for like 20s.

Lore: so, I always feel like Taph could have so much more potential with his lore, so with this, I hope to give him an expansion on this. I have another killer concept that ties these two together hopefully coming soon :3 Long ago, ember was in a now old deleted Roblox game. It had been some sort of large adventure game. However, one day, the owner of the game deleted his account causing the game to also have to be deleted. Builderman had recently started to use a creature taph had unintentionally created called The Core to delete these old games faster and more efficiently than other demolitionists could. Core was sent to destroy his game and began the process burning everything it touched dissolving the entire world. Ember was one of the npcs in the game who was part of a cult that worshipped “the flame”, a sacred thing in their game. Upon coming in contact with the dissolving flames of the core however, he somehow gained self awareness and realized what was happening. He had already been infected however by the flame causing it to eat away as his body. However, somehow he managed through sheer willpower to live, becoming one with this erasure flame while the world around him was burned away and consumed. Before everything vanished though, he managed to grab the “hero’s weapon” in the village and attempted to fight off the core. When the blade touched the creature, it also transformed into “the oblivion blade” which inherited the power to erase things from the core. Ember was able to hold it only because he was already one with the flames. With just one strike from his blade, the core had completely glitched out and bugged, returning to Builderman defunked and unable to do his job now. (I’ll touch on the aftermath and stuff when I release The Core). Ember was now left with the only thing in his world left being his small alter and lots of the weird flames. Ember grew into the illusion that these flames were the same as the flame of his word. With no bodily form anymore he trained himself to withstand the flame and even heal from the pain, along with learning how to hone the oblivion blade and the dagger which he also infected with the flame. With ember being so frail now from how he’s literally holding on by pure willpower, he learned rituals from his old cult to restore part of his body, or in his case feed his new flesh to the flame to restore and sustain himself. Eventually, ember decided to seek out the flame again, falling into the edge of the world that’s been deleted being forsaken. Now in this world, they aim to slay the core or in their words “slay the beast that had stolen our flame”, and protect the others from erasure like his comrades have suffered.

Achievements: 
milestone I-IV: same as usual.
Oncoming traffic: stun the killer with oblivion blade starting from 50 or more studs away.
Flame and flesh: use immolation more than 6 times in 1 game.
Withered hearts: As Ember kill the killer 30 times.

Skins: 
Cultist ($200): gives ember his old cultist outfit. So he has a full robe and hood and his dagger gets switched to an old one. Oblivion blade has no effect and is just a broadsword. 

Skeleflame ($400): has a skeleton within the flame which has turned black and purple

Dullahan: ($600): his head turns into a pumpkin with a flame in it. All explosion also play a cackling sound when used. His sword is replaced with a staff with a pumpkin on it.

underground ($600): it’s ember but with Grillby’s outfit and has his glasses.
Fine ($900): turns into the “this is fine” dog. Immolation is just drinking coffee
Angel of flame ($1000): Ember wears an angelic white robe instead of his regular outfit. His blade is now white instead and he has 2 wings made of fire. All fire is now white also.

Ogre ($1300): just turns him straight up into shrek. All the flame effects are replaced with green swamp effects. His oblivion blade is now a wooden stick while his dagger is a smaller stick. Immolation becomes a literal fart and so does erasure =-= when he goes to use oblivion blade all stars begins to play.

Wishbearer ($1500): okay a little backstory on this. I have a concepted story for this original world and in it are these different wishes that are basically powers if I had to explain it in the simplest way. One guy has an ability born from his wish called “hot ice” which I decided to use as the base of this skin.  Ember’s entire body switches to a guy wearing crystalline armor with shards jutting out. His face is covered by a bandanna and he gains hair which looks light blue and white with a few streaks of orange. Instead of the oblivion blade he has an ice spear and his dagger is also now white. With every step he leaves a path of small ice which after 3 seconds turns to steam. All of the explosions and fire pools he makes are reskinned to be ice instead with ice spikes jutting out the ground . With severance instead of just jabbing forwards he summons a wild mass of jutting ice crystals to stab forwards before they all eventually turn to steam. Mmmm

The anomaly ($1800): changes the skin to that of glitchtale chara with flames surrounding them. Severance is replaced with a slash that if it hits the killer, causes a 99999 dmg hit effect to come up. If it’s a miss it’ll say miss. Regardless it’ll do the animation undertake uses for slashing. Erasure causes chara to open her menu to find items, eating a random one. Oblivion blade does the same animation for ember but has the flowey “that’s a wonderful idea!” Sound play. Also the knife is replaced. All the fire is also now red and black glitch particles and the path that is traveled leaves a black and red version of basically the annihilation John Doe skin trail. Immolation is the player opening the reset option and slamming onto it. Custom LMS vs. Disbelief

Milestone I: Ember’s outfit is slightly charred now with black spots and maybe even some burned parts. Oblivion blade gains a few orange cracks on it that glow slightly. Also ember smokes a little now. Like there’s a black foggy effect around him slightly. Also the dagger has an orange tip on it now. Animation for immolation now also leaves small embers in that area for a short period of time. 

Milestone II: ember’s body grows brighter. He gains a cape that’s still burned like his clothes. The oblivion blade gains some glitchy red particles around it with a little more detail on the blade itself too. Also the cracks on the blade get brighter. The dagger is now on fire with an orange flame. His adventuring outfit becomes slightly more intricate starting to look more like a cultists uniform.

Milestone III: Ember gains shoulder plates that are made of black stone and have the orange cracks on them. The rest of his body is covered in his outfit that has even more intricate designs. His body is now made of white flames while his cape gains red streaks all over it. The dagger now has blue flames around it. The rest of ember’s body is glitching too. Also he gains a cultist hood over his head while his head seems to begin to manifest with no features.

Milestone IV: Ember’s cape is now jagged at the ends and his clothes are glowing and burning. Each one of his steps leaves a small flame for 2 seconds turns to smoke. The rest of his body is mostly covered in armor but he still has his cultist like outfit underneath. His entire body turns into a combination of white and blue fire. His face has manifested on his head but it has no eyes or mouth. The mouth is covered by a bandana. The hood gains strange glowing orange symbols. Black and orange crystals protrude from around his outfit too. There’s even some glowing flowers growing. The oblivion blade is decorated in crystals and now glows with the cracks and is surrounded by glitchy particles. Dagger is the same. All explosion animations also cause crystals to burst out of the ground and flowers made of fire to bloom there for a couple seconds. The dagger also has small rocks orbiting around it.  Using oblivion blade also chases ember to seem to flicker in and out. 

Driving in my caaaar (oncoming traffic achievement): turns into asgore lmao. When oblivion blade is used he gets into a car instead and starts speeding forwards. Pressing the move again causes the car to explode. All hit boxes are the same. Severance instead causes a small car to appear infront of the player and ram forwards. Erasure is just drinking a beer. Immolation is a car that falls onto the skin and explodes. 

Borrowed time (withered hearts achievement): this skin takes HEAVY inspiration from the lore of two time and Heathcliff from limbus company. This character and the associated Eternity skin for core are both from the same wish world as hot ice. So there once were these two people, one named Caelum and the other named Ashen. The story takes place after a massive star-like planet fell into earth giving wish-based abilities to the people on earth. That’s the basic summary there’s a lot more about these wishes but the most you gotta know is that. Ashen and Caelum were two kids that lost their parents during the impact and were taken in by a scientist like group. They bonded together while the adults pretty much just committed multiple human rights violations trying to figure out and understand the wishes. Now I’m not gonna bore you with all the details but the two got close and eventually were put into an experiment where the lab people would attempt to finally create their own wish. Through this time Caelum had been manipulated by the scientists to seek the “greater good” with these wishes as almost a god like entity (this is funny because it’s like the flipped version of ember’s lore where this time ember’s skin isn’t the cultist). For the “greater good” Caelum is forced to sacrifice the thing he loves most which they think will create a wish. Knowing that it’s Ashen, Caelum goes through with it at this point thinking the wish is worth it. Ashen hears about this plan and decides not to intervene. She was already dying from some weird allergy to the original stars sort of “wish” aura thing which nobody knew about and decides that seeing Caelum’s determination, that she wants her last moment to be giving herself to him. Caelum stabs Ashen in the back with a crude dagger killing her as she smiles in his arms. After the act, Ember in a sort of moment of clarity realizes what he had done. No wish was also made so it was pointless. With his pure rage and anguish he does manifest a wish. “Don’t fade—don’t fade, don’t fade, DON’T FADE! If the world takes you, then I’ll MAKE it remember you! I wish you’d never stop burning in it!”(“I wish she would stay, burning in the world until nothing else remained.”) and so his he gains the ability to conjure flames that last forever and can set any object on fire, adopting the name Eternal flame and burning the facility to the ground. (Full description of his ability is: (The user may conjure projectiles of fire that after hitting an enemy, permanently set them on fire. This effect cannot be canceled and lasts until the wish disappears (basically never). This flame does not produce sparks and only spreads through direct contact. User may also appear in any flame they had set previously.) with the world never doing anything for him he vows to set everything ablaze, going on a hunt to kill every other wish bearer or person that crosses his path. Years and years later another wish user dies and has their wish bottle dropped near the initial lab place where the one thing that remained was the untouched corpse of Ashen. From the wish Ashen is awoken and gains the ability to live for just 1 hour. With Eternal Flame also there, Ashen sees what he has become and confronts him only for Calleum, now totally gone, to attack Ashen. Ashen’s hope for Caelum to change grants her a blade able to pierce Caelum. With pure determination (and from not even being technically human anymore as they’re a memory), the two battle to the death with Caelum especially now wanting Ashen dead. Okay that’s the very short summary of it but onto the actual skin description. Ashen’s body is replaced with a more darkish charcoal looking body. Parts of her body are cracked and emanate black and white sparks along with glowing purple and orange while pulsing. Her entire body is also covered in white and black flames. The blade is replaced with a massive magma coated orange broadsword that drips and leaves a small and short lasting magma trail. There are some black cracks on it though. Her hair is long and her face looks calm. The outfit is replaced with black stone plated armor with a robe under it with many golden sigils all across it. Parts of the robe flicker in and out with glitchy particles. Her body is also slightly transparent. Half of embers face is her glowing skull while the other is her regular face. Both her eyes glow faintly though. Above her head is a shattered halo made of glasslike particles. She also has wings made of ash on her. She also has a cape that’s heavily burnt and charred. The hourglass has been replaced with a destroyed version that emanates orange light. Wrapped around her arms are golden chains. A silver hourglass charm also dangles around her neck. Dagger is replaced with a black curved version that looks slightly more like a sickle. It’s black and looks like it’s made of ash while glowing a little orange. Upon using immolation for the first time, the Ashen’s wings grow and spread, before changing into a glowing white more crystal-like one. they also gain a crown made of crystals. Severance switches to a fire slash instead of a stab. It does a wide swing and leaves a fiery effect. If it hits something then it will cause a miniature explosion. Erasure makes Ember create a circle on the floor with his dagger and cutting himself to bleed onto the ground. Then, he stomps causing the circle to glow orange and be set ablaze before eventually fading out. Oblivion blade is given extra effects as the glide causes sparks to burst from the ground. Immolation is the same though. The player for oblivion blade has her do two flips backwards instead of the jump before she jumps forwards with the ground under hear when she jumps and glides being given a fiery explosion effect. The auto ending has her jump and do a front flip to smash the blade into the ground.

Here's the exact blueprint,"Manchester has free workspace (Generator), 2,500+ university students for beta testing, £5 coffee shop customer interviews, and a £50 membership connecting you to 10,000 companies. 

https://preview.redd.it/2hh4hdwm4b0g1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=d90a8cce35a7bab4a18156e81659146167e2e598

Six unicorns validated here spending almost nothing. This is how.

I'm not from the UK. But I spent the weekend researching where founders can actually validate ideas without burning cash.

Manchester's the answer. And nobody talks about it properly.

**Free workspace with podcast studios.** 2,500 students ready to test your product. 

Coffee shops where £5 gets you real customer feedback. A startup membership costing less than a decent dinner.

Meanwhile: 60,000+ tech workers, £265M raised in 2023, living costs half of London.

Peak AI validated here before their $119M exit. THG started with CDs before hitting £6.5B. Boohoo tested with Instagram before their £4.5B peak.

Not London transplants. Built from Manchester from day one.

# Start here: Generator Manchester (literally free)

**Generator Manchester** opened January 2024 and it's bonkers how good it is.

Council-backed, St Peter's Square location, completely free trials.

Not talking about a desk in a corner. Photography studios, podcast equipment, meeting rooms, and access to £5M worth of business databases.

Email [generator@manchester.gov.uk](mailto:generator@manchester.gov.uk) and tell them you're validating an idea. They'll give you a tour and free trial membership.

Founders have used it for months before committing to paid space anywhere.

The workshops are actually useful too. IP protection, marketing basics, business planning.

None of that ""10 slides about our methodology"" rubbish. Real help from people who've done it.

https://i.redd.it/uahotagt4b0g1.gif

# Beta testing: Universities are your goldmine

Right, this is where Manchester properly wins.

**University of Manchester's Masood Entrepreneurship Centre** gives you access to 2,500+ students taking entrepreneurship courses. Every. Single. Year.

Drop-in sessions run Wednesdays 2-4pm at Alliance Manchester Business School and Thursdays 2-4pm at Students' Union.

No appointment needed.

Email [entrepreneurship@manchester.ac.uk](mailto:entrepreneurship@manchester.ac.uk) with your idea and what you need testing.

Offer £10-20 Amazon vouchers or free product access. You'll get 10-50 students depending on your project.

These aren't random people clicking buttons. They're studying this stuff and actually give proper feedback.

**Manchester Met** does similar through their Start-Up MVP Fund (up to £250 for validation) and weekly drop-ins Thursdays 1-3:45pm at their Jobs Hub.

Timing matters: October-November and January-February are sweet spots. Don't bother in May/June when everyone's drowning in exams.

Professional user research agencies charge £8,000+ for 20 participants. This gets you 40+ for £400 in vouchers.

# Customer interviews: Northern Quarter on a budget

The Northern Quarter's where you want to be for actual customer conversations.

**Federal Café** (9 Nicholas Croft) is startup central but tiny, so get there early.

**Takk** (6 Tariff St) has three locations and is proper laptop-friendly.

**Foundation Coffee House** explicitly welcomes working customers.

Strategy's simple: buy someone's coffee (£3-5) for 10-15 minutes of their time.

Show mockups on your laptop, take notes, don't overstay. You can hit 5-10 conversations per day this way.

Three days doing this costs about £50 total. That's cheaper than one Facebook ad campaign that tells you nothing.

MediaCityUK works better for B2B stuff. **HOST** has UX testing labs and 120 high-growth businesses if you need corporate validation (£200/month coworking membership for full access).

https://i.redd.it/o9zffftk5b0g1.gif

# Online communities that actually help

**mcrtech Slack**: 2,303+ members, completely free.

Visit [mcrtech.github.io](http://mcrtech.github.io) for invite. Channels for events, jobs, tech discussions.

People genuinely help each other here, not just networking theatre.

**Manchester Digital**: £50+VAT annual startup membership.

Gives you their Slack (#MDTechCommunity), investor network access, free training, and events. Represents 10,000 companies.

This is how you meet actual decision-makers, not just other founders hustling.

**Manchester Discord**: 9,374+ members at discord.com/invite/manc.

Largest UK local Discord. Not purely tech but loads of professionals. Free, obviously.

Post in r/manchester between 7-9am or 7-10pm GMT for best response.

Be honest you're a founder, don't try to sneak in marketing. The community respects genuine questions but murders obvious promotion.

Founders report getting intro calls from mcrtech that became pilot customers. Manchester Digital events regularly connect people with mentors. Total cost: £50 for the MD membership.

# In-person networking without membership fees

**digitalThursday** runs monthly at Atrium Coffee (1 St. Peter's Square).

Free pizza, free drinks, 50-60 people mixing. Founders, designers, developers, agency owners.

Actually useful conversations, not ""here's my card"" spam.

**Startup Grind Manchester** relaunched November 2024.

Free for members, focuses on investor connections and founder stories. Check [startupgrind.com/manchester](http://startupgrind.com/manchester) for events.

**Northern Quarter Makers Market** happens second Sunday monthly at Stevenson Square.

Stalls cost £30-60. If you've got a physical product, spend one Sunday there. You'll learn more in 6 hours than a month of surveys.

Co-working spaces run regular events too.

**Department Campfield** recently did 100 days free coworking (ended November 2024, but watch for new offers).

**Colony Workspaces** has seven locations with £25 day passes if you want to test different spots.

https://preview.redd.it/bd63eneb5b0g1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=830c0e5956d814d15a622a2c3e03a804bac70c08

# What actually worked for successful Manchester startups

**Peak AI** sketched their idea on a pub napkin (they kept it, which is very on-brand).

Validated by winning Tech North competition in 2015, partnered with Unis for talent, grew 70% in 12 months. Acquired for $119M.

Key move: They built in Manchester AND India from day one. Talent arbitrage while staying plugged into local ecosystem.

**THG** founder invested £500k in 2004 selling CDs online.

Validated by getting Tesco and M&S execs as investors AND customers. When iPhone killed the entertainment model in 2007, they pivoted fast to beauty.

IPO'd at £6B in 2020.

Key move: £5 dresses as pure loss leaders for traffic. Not profit, just validation of demand.

**Boohoo** started 2006 in a small Manchester office.

Validated through Instagram and influencers before that was obvious. Local Leicester suppliers meant weeks from design to consumer, not months.

IPO'd 2014 at £560M, peaked at £4.5B.

Key move: Test and repeat model. Small batches, see what sells, scale winners fast.

None of them spent big on validation. They spent smart on local resources.

# The 12-week validation blueprint

**Weeks 1-2**: Join mcrtech Slack and Manchester Discord (free). Email Generator Manchester and Unis. Attend one Manchester Digital event. Post problem questions (not solutions) in r/manchester.

**Weeks 3-4**: Do 10-20 coffee interviews in Northern Quarter (budget £50). Sign up beta testers through Unis or Betalist. Visit Northern Quarter market to watch target customers.

**Weeks 5-6**: Run proper beta test with 30-50 Uni students (£300-400 in vouchers). Use [BetaTesting.com](http://BetaTesting.com) free tier. Host feedback session at Generator.

**Weeks 7-8**: If physical product: book Makers Market stall (£30-60). If digital: keep iterating. If B2B: use Manchester Digital network for demos. Track actual willingness to pay.

**Weeks 9-12**: Double down on what worked. Scale successful channels. Compile metrics and testimonials.

**Total cost if you're disciplined: Under £500. If you're scrappy: Under £200.**

The actual timeline matters less than the discipline. Test assumptions fast, kill bad ideas faster.

# What makes Manchester different

Half London costs, two-hour train when you need it.

Universities that actually engage instead of hiding behind bureaucracy.

Founders who help other founders without expecting immediate return.

The ""giving back"" culture is documented.

David Foreman from Praetura Ventures notes ""greater emphasis on giving back to the startup ecosystem than in London.""

Stories of £100M+ exit founders spending hours mentoring early-stage founders are common.

Less ego than London means more honest feedback.

77% of Manchester's fastest-growing startups in 2024 are AI companies.

If you're building AI, the clustering effects are real. Talent, advisors, and capital all concentrating.

And the truth filter works better.

People tell you your idea's rubbish over coffee instead of being polite. You waste less time.

The city's hit the inflection point.

Generator launched, universities expanded programmes, £265M flowing annually. The infrastructure that Peak AI and THG didn't have? You've got it now, mostly free.

Manchester's not perfect.

Raising serious funding still means London trips. Corporate customers want London meetings.

But for validation? For figuring out if your idea has legs before you bet everything?

Best place in the UK. Not even close.

**What's the scrappiest way you've validated something that actually worked?**

1ouyzsh,https://i.redd.it/haefn4uu2s0g1.jpeg,The Harsh Truth Behind Why Indian Greats Don’t Get Proper Goodbyes,"A year prior to the 2003 World Cup, *Steve Waugh* had a fallout with the Australian Cricket Board. He was sacked from ODI captaincy and removed from ODI setup. He was reportedly told, 

>“If AUS is playing next year's World Cup final and we’re 60–4, we’d rather see Andrew Symonds walk in from Johannesburg tunnel, not you.”

Australia went on to win the 2003 World Cup, and despite that, they dropped **Michael Bevan** soon after. The reason was simple Bevan was a classical ODI batter who thrived on singles, doubles, and placement. But the game was evolving towards power hitters like Symonds. Harsh? Yes. Professional? Absolutely.

Cut to 2025, *Rohit Sharma* is removed from captaincy, and Shubman Gill is named India’s new leader. Rohit and Virat Kohli are asked to play an India A series. The social media outrage that followed perfectly shows *why* farewells for Indian legends are almost impossible.

There are **two main reasons**:

1. Lack of a professional cricketing structure
2. Hero worshipping by fans

**1. Lack of Professional Setup**

In England, when Jimmy Anderson decided to retire after the 2025 Ashes, Ben Stokes informed Rob Key, and a proper meeting took place between Anderson, McCullum, and Key- over coffee, they told him he wasn’t part of the Ashes plans. Clear, direct, and respectful.

In India, that structure doesn’t exist. If Virat or Rohit want something, they can directly reach out to Jay Shah or someone high up in the BCCI. There’s no clear separation of power. The captain becomes too powerful, and selectors too weak to make hard calls.

Former players like **Yuvraj Singh, Virender Sehwag, and Suresh Raina** have openly said that selectors never communicated whether they were in the plans or not.

* For ex, Yuvraj was told to play domestic after being dropped in 2017.
* He was later asked to clear Yo-Yo test.
* After passing the Yo-Yo test, he heard nothing.
* In 2019, Yuvi met Dhoni at an airport and said, 'he was prepping hard to make to CWC 2019'. Dhoni informed him that he wasn’t in the management's plans and that’s when Yuvraj decided to retire after IPL 2019.

This lack of direct, honest communication has been the story for most Indian greats.

**2. Hero Worshipping**

Indian fans want it both ways. hey demand that the team be *ruthless and professional* like Australia, but also want their heroes treated like demigods.

When Steve Smith plays domestic cricket, there’s no outrage in Australia. If Rohit or Virat are asked to do the same, Indian fans lose their minds.

That’s the paradox we want to win CWCs like Australia but manage our players like a religious institution. The BCCI knows the public backlash that follows any “harsh” decision against a superstar, so they simply avoid it.

**And that’s why Indian legends rarely get farewells**.. because in a system where communication is poor, power is centralized, and fans treat cricketers like gods- professional goodbyes will always look like betrayals.",51,1762933101.0,IndiaCricket,29,0.93,False

**Chapter 2: The Elevator**

  
We arrived at one of the three hospitals in Paladin following a low-budget ambulance that looked like it had had its best days many years ago. I am not surprised that no upgrade is needed, as many spells and other solutions for injured citizens sometimes need a quick fix without the human tools commonly used.

Teresa and I watched as the ambulance door opened, and a stretcher approached. With quick interaction from the staff, they got the angel out and rushed her in through the entrance. I was just a little lost in myself. It didn't make sense to me why the Goblin jumped. He is an outsider like me. While the Goblin is half-human and I am human, we don't fit in with the people living in Paladin. While I can walk outside the zone and return to reality in Stockholm, he has nowhere to go except for the outside village. Where there is a place for Creatures or half-breeds to live a calm life together, but because of the aggressive behavior of a goblin and the human side of him, he must have felt lonely and an outcast. Same as me, but maybe a little bit different. For the Goblin to fall into darkness, eat somebody's face, and do bad things means this world has no peace, and that coat guy with the hat managed to escape, which won't make my life easier since I missed him.

The so-called hospital here was just a long, flat building that looked like a health center, but it was wide. Operation-type hospitals usually have several floors, but this was just a one-floor crap. Nothing special, except the bricks were visible, as if it were a run-down building before they turned it into a hospital. Hopefully, the inside doesn't look like the outside. We got out of the car and walked towards the entrance when suddenly someone yelled from behind:

""MOVE!""

When I turned around and saw a guy with a rolling bed, I quickly moved to the side and looked at a red octopus the size of a human with googly eyes, making a hissing sound. Two tentacles that obviously looked like someone had cut them off, and black ooze leaking from the wounds. They quickly rolled through the entry and turned left. We went inside, and an old lady with pink hair, white clothing, and a white hat sat at a desk between the left corridor and the straight one.

""You sure this is a hospital?"" I whispered to Teresa.

She nodded without saying anything and went up to the desk.

""Hello! We are from the Van Polan organization. We are here to see a patient named Greta Ganther."" Teresa said.

The old lady glared at us and said:

""Badge, please.""

Shit! I left my badge on the table at home. Well, my sloppiness is almost legendary. I always get bailed out by Victoria or Teresa anyway.

Teresa got her badge up and showed it to the old lady, who responded:

""Follow the orange line that goes straight.""

We started walking down the orange line a couple of meters before it suddenly turned right. It was a long corridor that, at the moment of turning right, looked like an emergency room. There was some strange smell in the air, though, something I had never smelled before. We kept walking along the orange line, and curtains covered some spaces that looked like temporary rooms, as they do in hospitals in the human world during emergencies. I noticed that the smell came from one of those rooms with curtains.

We reached the end of the corridor, and the orange line now turned to the left. I could see a couple of women standing there, and it looked like they were looking into a room. We kept walking, following the line until we reached them. I tried to squeeze myself through them until I came in front of the window and saw a man sitting on Greta and looking like he was doing CPR on her.

""What happened?"" I asked out in the air.

Of course! A voice that I knew was heard behind me.

""Her heart stopped! He is trying to revive her.""

I knew it was Victoria, and she had come here before me, which is unusual because she doesn't usually follow up this close on assignments. I usually never manage to see her in crowds because of her talent for going unnoticed. I looked back and stared into her blue-colored eyes, and then turned back to the window and saw the doctor who had been doing the CPR suddenly stop and go down from the bed. He checked his clock, which, of course, I knew he was reading the time of Greta's death.

I looked back at Victoria, who shook her head.

""Your eyes are telling me everything, Berk, don't you even dare."" She told me in a severe tone.

I pushed two women out of my way and opened the door, knowing everyone would follow suit and try to stop me. I don't care about that; I did everything possible to protect her because I believed she would survive. I won't let her give up that easily on death. I quickly jumped up on the bed and started to do CPR on Greta, which confused the doctor.

""KEEP THE FUCKING TUBE IN HER MOUTH FOR AIR!"" I screamed at the nurse, who hurried and started to push air through her mouth.

I kept giving her a heart massage and felt several hands trying to drag me away, but I used all my strength and pushed them away for a moment, and kept going with the massage.

""COME ON, GRETA! FIGHT IT!"" I screamed at her.

Suddenly, I felt an immense power grab my shoulder, throwing me to the other side of the room as I lost total control, hitting my back against the wall, and fell on the floor. I had a hard time breathing as I saw the disconnect all equipment attached to Greta and slowly covered a white blanket over her body. I tried to catch my breath from the pain, staring at Victoria, who stared down on me with anger.

""Know your place...Van Polan!” She spoke with a much darker, crisper voice than the lean one she usually has.

I knew in an instant that she was the one who threw me backwards, as the other ones wouldn't dare to create a stir in the hospital. Veronica walked towards me, grabbed my tie, and dragged me out of the room. I knew that both of us were really angry with each other, and this wouldn't end well for anyone.

""LET GO!"" I screamed at her.

I got slammed towards the wall, and she moved quickly towards me as I tried to give her a right fist to the head, but her hand was up with one finger in the air that was gushing out blue fire. Mid-air, the fist had frozen, not even close to her face. She grabbed my blazer and lifted me in the air as I tried to prepare a new punch, but I flew through the corridor, dragged on the floor at high speed, before I hit something. I saw her feet moving towards me, but everything just got blurry until it went pitch-black. I could still hear her high heels hitting the floor as she moved closer, until everything went quiet.

When I opened my eyes, there was an elevator door in front of me; it looked like it had gone through several ghettos in Paladin before arriving here. Chewing gum, graffiti all over it, the upper right corner even looked a little bit melted. I looked around and saw a door to the left with a red-painted window, but a blue graffiti reading 'Go Through This Door If You Want To Die!' on it. Yeah...like I am that stupid to fall for that...or maybe it is really the exit. Looked back, but only a greasy, disgusting wall. There was also a windowed door to the right, and I looked through it to check if it was also a death door. Inside were a lot of school benches and chairs. Is this a classroom? Looked if someone was inside, but it was all empty. Went back to the elevator and pushed the button as the digital sign above counted down from ten until it reached the first floor, and the doors opened with a screech. Eh... someone needs to check the safety measures. The whole situation was weird as hell. I went into the elevator, pressed the number ten button, and the doors slowly closed. The elevator didn't move when suddenly an internal speaker sounded with a female voice:

“Kare wa kachi ga nai!”

Eh! What did it say?

“KARE WA KACHI GA NAI!” It screamed out now.

It kept repeating the same sentence, then went quiet. The doors opened, and I kept pressing the button to close them and move to the tenth floor. The doors didn't move, and the same sentence kept repeating itself. I moved out of the elevator and screamed at it:

""YOU CAN KARE WA KACHI GA NAI...YEAH!"" and the doors slammed shut, and the elevator moved up towards the tenth floor. Damn, this shit —it looks like the elevator is out of reach. There is only the classroom left. I hope that when I enter, a teacher won't show up and force me to study. That would suck...like really bad. I had to open the damn classroom, and I entered, realizing that suddenly there was a small girl, not even looking to be over ten years old. Black hair with red eyes and a freaking maid dress...is she going to teach me how to serve coffee?

""What the fudge is going on here?"" I asked.

She started wiggling her upper body left and right, like it was some side-step disco for kids. I thought I had seen all in my life, like a crocodile wrestler...but this, it takes the prize as the most awkward thing...ever!

I moved to the center of the classroom, but still kept a distance from her. Noticing that the room didn't have any light, I realized it was shining because it came from outside. Moved closer to the window and saw the central city in Stockholm in a sea of fire. The flames were the crap shining up the room. It has to be a dream. I need to exit this dream... it has to be a dream.

When I turned to the girl in the weird outfit, she was smiling now and said:

""At last! It has been such a long time for us. We look forward to swallowing your soul and killing it to take over your body. You are not worthy to inherit the powers of the 100TH Demon Army. So, give us your soul and we will make your meat body stronger. You are too weak to do anything, Berk Van Polan."" And with a high-pitched laugh, a demon's laughter echoed through the room.

I gave her a smirk as she was not the first demon trying to fool me with this talk.

""I thought this was a Cappuccino course on how to serve it perfectly. I suppose that maybe going into the death room would have been a better choice.""

It was silent for a moment. A staring contest was going on between us, and I tried to look serious, but that was so hard. At any moment, something will erupt; I cannot lose to a ten-year-old in my dream...I will not lose.

""Sorry! But my soul is not for sale, Cappuccino maid!""

Just got another “thank you for your submission, but unfortunately…” email from a journal, and honestly, it hit harder than I expected. I know rejection is a normal part of academic publishing, but after months (or years) of work, it’s still tough to take.

I’ve already had this paper rejected a couple of times — each time with different reviewer comments, some of which completely contradict each other. It’s exhausting trying to figure out whether I should rewrite, submit elsewhere, or just shelve the whole thing for a while.

How do you all deal with this emotionally *and* practically?  
Do you take a break before resubmitting? Send it to another journal right away? Or just cry, drink coffee, and try again later😅?

**TL;DR:** Got another journal rejection and am feeling discouraged. How do you cope and keep pushing your research forward after multiple rejections?

SONG TIME!





Step right up, don’t be shy, take a deep breath, don’t ask why

We scrub the halls till the night turns bright, where the windows gleam in the morning light



They say the Purple down the lane,

Deals in whispers, grapes, and pain

But here we heal with mint and song,

And keep the beds where they belong

I mop the floors, I hum along,

Been cleaning the peace here all day long



Oh, I’ve seen ghosts in gowns of white,

But ours just float without a dream.



Welcome to the Green Hospital, where the curtains glow and the air feels full

Of lemon-scent and second chances, steady hearts and quiet dances

Every tile hums soft and clean,

No purple haze, no midnight sheen

Just breathe it in. It IS serene,

Here in the halls of the Green




We fix the cracks with steady hands,

And dreams echo through the fans

The nurses whistle brighter tunes,

And chase the gloom from all the rooms

No haunted eyes or velvet lies,

Just open doors and lullabies




The lights don’t flicker, they softly sway,

Guiding lost dreams the gentle way




Welcome to the Green Hospital, where the coffee’s warm and the pain feels small

We’ll stitch your dreams and savour your fear,

And send you home when you’re whole, my dear

Every scar turns pale and clean,

No purple tricks, no in-between

Just truth that shines, a steady routine,

Here in the halls of the Green




I’ve mopped both wings, I’ve seen both sides,

The light, the dark, the place where pride hides

And though the night can whisper schemes,

We guard the door where daylight beams




Welcome to the Green Hospital, where we heal the hurt, not cage it all, 

We'll take your dreams till you have none,

If you’ve lost your spark or your sight unseen,

Come find your peace where the floorboards gleam

Every sigh turns soft and lean,

No purple ghosts, no broken machine

Just the hum of hope and a steady sheen,

Here in the halls of the Green




So wipe your shoes, don’t be afraid,

We’re open late, and the beds are made

One more sweep, your dreams are mine

For context, I'm someone who struggles with anxiety and depression, I don't last on regular jobs due anxiety/panic attacks, I mostly work from home, I have some crafting and artistic skills so I make some money off it. I do the cleaning and cooking and home, I also got severals pets I take care of. I got a wonderful boyfriend who knows this situation and is happy to provide for both of us since he has a really well payed job. I've been told often that I'm too soft or too forgiving. I like to believe that people isn't evil just because, I understand everyone has their own story and I try to be patient and kind. Treat others the way you'd like to be treated kind of thing. I'm really aware of other's emotions and needs and I try to be mindful of them while interacting with them. This has led to several instances where people has taken advantage of me and I simply cut contact after a relationship gets too damaging for me. My two younger brothers have taken a liking to mock me for being dumb, weak and soft. It makes inevitable to bully me they say. As the two of them are younger than me and I understand that I need to be the bigger person here and not react.

Today, however, I had a bad day. I guess I'm too exhausted right now and maybe that's why their words affected me more than other days. The oldest brother called me ""little traumatized one"" in my mother language in a derogatory way, mocking me for my situation. The youngest one went on on a discourse about how stupid I am for liking coffee and that maybe that's the whole root of my anxiety and I refuse to do something to be better (I know for sure it isn't the coffee and right now I'm way better than I was a couple years ago, psychologically wise). 

And now I'm here, is time to sleep and I can't stop thinking about how much I hate myself for being like this. Maybe if I wasn't soft or if I could be cruel like them maybe I could actually tolerate a normal job, maybe people wouldn't take advantage of me, maybe I'd be less stressed out about other people's problems, maybe I wouldn't get worried when my fam tell me about their issues, maybe I could just live in peace with myself. I always promise myself that I'll match the rudeness of the people I interact with but I simply can't, it's just unthinkable for me, I couldn't do the things they do and say. I hate that I'm not strong enough, maybe they're right and I'm not even smart enough or I wouldn't be in this situation. It sounds really stupid and sounds like I'm lying but I feel so hard and so much, I love with such strength and the things that hurt just hurt as much and I can't stop asking myself what am I doing wrong, like it's not normal that I care as much as I do.

1ouyrfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/travelchina/comments/1ouyrfl/trip_report_beijing_shanghai_xiamen/,"Trip report: Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen","Just finished up 12 amazing days in China - Beijing, Shanghai and Xiamen. It was our first time to China so we organised private guides through Odynovo in Beijing and Shanghai - they were pretty good, it meant we saw and did loads but they perhaps weren't the most informed guides and felt more like companions. Would definitely recommend having some sort of guide for your first time in China to help navigate things though by the time we got to Xiamen, which we did without a guide, we were totally fine on our own.

Apps

It's definitely worth taking time to set up all the apps before you go. 

We used alipay for most payments. Super simple to use although initially my account was blocked due to suspected fraud but this was solved through resubmitting my passport through the security centre. Once this was sorted though, it was very easy and we just had it linked to our Wise travel card. We used wechat for payments occasionally - you definitely need both wechat and alipay but alipay is the most convenient. We used didis through the alipay mini program which was great - fast and cheap. It's worth learning the last four or five digits of your phone number in Chinese as drivers use this to check you're who they are meant to be picking up.

Trip.Com was great - booked flights, hotels and esims through the app. Super easy to use and navigate. 

We used Amap to navigate which worked perfectly. I registered for this using my email address before leaving - would recommend doing it this way rather than phone number, which didn't work for me or my husband.

Google translate works perfectly and is totally essential for reading menus, signs etc and communicating. No one in Beijing or xiamen spoke English (even at the hotels), and there was only limited English in Shanghai. 

Beijing

We stayed at the Dong Fang hotel, which seemed to be popular with big tour groups. It's a historical hotel, with historical theming. It was quite fun to experience but old round the edges and a bit out of the way of everything. The room was also very hot, with no ability to change the temperature - we learnt that Chinese people hate the cold and pre-set heating is common in the winter. This meant we had to have the window open to get some airflow and cool down the room.

Our guide took us to forbidden city, tiannemen square and temple of heaven in one day. We went on a Saturday and it was totally rammed, the temple of heaven was particularly hectic. You'd probably want to space these out of a couple of days to truly take your time through it all. 

We also went to the Mutinayu section of the great Wall of China. We were a little worried about how strenuous this day would be, we have very average fitness and had read that the wall is either strenuous or very strenuous. We ended up doing gate 14 to gate six (cable car to toboggan) which was mostly downhill and overall about 5/10 exertion. There are a few places where the steps down are very deep and couple of steep uphill climbs but it all comes in short bursts. Along the way there are places to stop and buy snacks and drinks but also plenty of people bringing their own food and picnicking on the wall. The toboggan is fun but about an hour wait and it's a separate ticket to the cable car up. Lots of people monitoring the slide on the way down making sure you're moving along it OK and there is even a photo opportunity! At the base of the great Wall is a little village, kind of ski resort vibes and there are lots of places to eat including a pizza hut/burger king as well as many souvenir shops. 

We did try Peking duck in Beijing - stumbled into Quanjude, the oldest and premier duck place in Beijing by all accounts, which was a hectic 45min wait for a table and definitely worth it for the full experience.

Shanghai

We stayed at SSAW Boutique hotel which was really nice calm hotel in an excellent position walking to the yu Gardens and the market - a must visit both at day and night! 

We enjoyed visiting M50 art district and wandering around all the galleries, and going to the nearby 1000 trees mall - head up to the rooftop for awesome photo opportunities! We also went to the Louis - the newly opened Louis vuitton experience which was actually great, a very cool little museum with the history of Louis vuitton, again some great photo ops. Another highlight was the propaganda poster museum, super tiny and in a random spot on the 7th floor of an office building but so worth a visit to see an amazing selection of historical posters, a great gift shop too.

We also enjoyed wandering along anfu road (you have to get a coffee and teddy bear at 13marzo! A total influencer spot but the drinks were actually great) and exploring the French concession. 

Our guide also took us out to Zhujiajio water town, which was a real surprise. It was about an hour drive from Shanghai and perfect for a day wandering - lots of little shops, quite touristy, but really fun. There are also some lovely temples and gardens to walk through as well and excellent dining options - we probably had our best meal in a little canteen style restaurant at the tourist centre side of town. 
 

We used the metro quite a bit as well, one of the easiest and cheapest metros to navigate.

Our food highlight in Shanghai was Suedimsum which delivered delicious, cheap dumplings and noodles in a great atmosphere. We went to the location in the basement of Shanghai New World Dawan Department Store on East Nanjing Road. 

Xiamen

We stopped here as we were flying with xiamen Airlines and figured a few chill days at the end of our trip would be nice.

Xiamen was great - we stayed at the langham place which was very much affordable luxury and conveniently located next to two shopping malls and about 20mins from the airport (the didi ride cost about 5aud). We spent one day at the beach and went to jingxilan yanlei, which was the chilliest beach club ever and a real highlight of the trip.

Would definitely recommend stopping in xiamen, especially if you're coming from Australia like us. We really rated xiamen Airlines and found the whole transit process through xiamen very easy. On the way out we had a 2hr transfer to our flight to Beijing - I was very nervous this wasn't going to be enough time but there was no one at immigration so it was a breeze. We didn't have to pick up our bags either, rather they have a wechat system which tells you when your bags have been cleared and you're all set to pass through security. We made it through everything easily in one hour, so plenty of time to chill at the gate before our second flight.

A final note on coffee - we are from Melbourne and coffee is essential start to the day. While Starbucks is prevelent we loved trying the Chinese coffee chains- luckin was great for fun flavours at cheap prices, manner coffee was sleek and simple with decently strong coffee but the stand out was MStand, which we really rated for vibes, flavour and strength. You can't adjust orders (with oat milk, for example) in the apps when you order but if you ask the servers making these kind of adaptations is always possible. 

We loved china - and found everyone so incredibly kind and patient with the language and cultural barriers. Definitely plan on coming back!

I dread having to see her, she’s like a black hole of misery and anxiety sucking the joy from life everywhere she goes. Thankfully she lives in Long Island and is too scared to drive out of there so we rarely see her, once or twice a year. We have three kids and she’s only visited one in the last 5 years because she bought a fucking lamp from an auction in Greenwich CT which is only 30 minutes from us, so shes perfectly fine to drive off the Island for a lamp but god forbid it’s your grandchild’s birthday… I digress. 

About 5 years ago my wife and I bought her uncles cabin in upstate NY, beautiful 17 acres, the cabin was a little run down but we fixed it up, we try and go up there as much as often in the summer. The property had a few sheds with tools and whatnot and two tractors, big old Ford farm tractors. When we bought it, we specified “all contents conveys” her uncle didn’t care about any of the stuff as it’s all used for upstate activities, what is he going to do with a tractor in Bay Ridge. 


Well after we bought it my mother in law called and said, she has stuff there and it’s hers and she wants it. she inherited it from her other brother who passed away, she said the chainsaws, one of the tractor (the shit one) and a shop vac was hers along with a bunch of misc stuff in one of the sheds, tools she will never use and don’t even know what they do. My wife was a little taken aback. We told her she should have come and gotten everything before we closed, we use some of the tools but have our own so I don’t really care. We wanted to take down the shed that has her tractor in so we told her we can sell the tractor and we’ll give her the money. She said no she wants to keep the tractor. We told her a few times we were planning on getting rid of that shed to build a garage and we need to get rid of the tractor and we can bring her the other stuff next time we come down. She was threatening to sue us if we sold any of “her stuff” as she’s not ready to part with it. My wife was really upset. I told her not to worry I’ll take care of it. 

The next weekend we were upstate, I had rolled the tractor out of the shed, and put together her mom’s stuff. My wife asked me what I was doing. I said just putting your moms stuff together. She asked why, I said so we can give it to her or sell it or she can sell it but it’s gotta go. I’m starting the garage tomorrow. She said “whatever it can sit out side I don’t care”. That night after everyone fell asleep, I hatched my plan, I had hooked up my trailer. I loaded the tractor which doesn’t run so I had to winch it on real quiet like as to not wake anyone. I loaded her tool box, all the misc tools in the shed, chainsaws, shop  vac into a big ass wooden crate about 4’x4’ 3’ tall, because fuck her. And hit the road, it’s 2.5 hours to my mother in laws house, I was trucking. I got there at about 2 am. I quietly backed into her driveway, thankfully I’m a pro trailer backer upper, put the ramps right next to her car, put down the ramps and had to jack up the trailer a bit to get it to slowly roll off using the winch. Jacks are fucking loud, but I put down a sweater to try and deaden the noise, I put the crate on a dolly and rolled it off down next to the tractor. It was heavy as hell, so I knew I had to get my dolly back so she can’t move it, so I jacked it up to slide it off, easily 300 lb box. The entire time I can’t believe I haven’t been caught, she lives in a nice neighborhood and I just started doing sketchy shit at 2am the cops didn’t show up? Whatever. I must have been there for 20 minutes max, I was hustling and had arranged everything for easy offload. 

I get out of there laughing my ass off, a grin ear to ear. I know I’m in trouble with my wife in the morning… I was almost home, it’s 5:45 and my wife is calling, she asked where I went? I told her I went to get breakfast for everyone. So I stopped, bought a bunch of bagels and coffee and donuts. Just giggle to myself like a serial killer at 6am on a Saturday. I get home and she asked why I still had the trailer hooked up, I says oh I wasn’t sure if I was going to the lumber yard or not and I didn’t feel like unhooking it. I’m trying to hide my excitement for the call, jacked up with adrenaline. 8 am rolled around, nothing, 8:30 nothing. Luckily it was a little chilly so no one had gone out side to see the tractor is gone. 9:15 the call came, I see her look at her phone and roll her eyes, ugh, she hates her mom. I tell her to pick up, as soon as she picks up you can hear her screaming, my wife is like what the fuck is happening. I walk over put my hand out, put the phone on speaker and say “you wanted your tractor, you got it” and hung up. I had to explain what I’ve done to my wife and she was dying laughing. Thankfully. Black hole called about 10 more times all going unanswered. She then texted, I’m calling the police. My wife is starting to panic a bit. I tell her don’t worry, I’ll handle it. About 1pm a long island number comes up as xxx town police, oh shit. I pick up. “This is officer so and so, I’m here with black hole, she said you dumped stuff on her property. I calmly said “that’s her stuff, she wanted it” officer “is this your tractor” black hole “yes but I don’t want it here, I want them to take it back” he says something like do you have a storage agreement or anything? She says no. I explained the situation to him and said there’s nothing I can do as there wasn’t anything wrong unless she wanted to press trespassing charges, but you’d have to prove he was on your property. Anyone could have dropped it off. At this point the officer had realized this lady is bat shit crazy, and didn’t want to deal with this. I thought I might actually get in trouble. Anyway she didn’t talk to us for like 6 months so really it was a win win for me. ",238,1762931747.0,pettyrevenge,31,0.99,False

1ouyll0,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ouyll0/signal_integrity/,Signal Integrity,"Imago believed memory was the only true form of resurrection. Since Sarah’s death, the world had become a treacherous place of shifting surfaces and random cruelties. The accident had been a fracture, a clean break in the timeline of his life, and his work in the archive was a quiet, desperate attempt to solder the world back together. Here, in the climate controlled stillness, history was pinned and catalogued. A voice on a tape was a voice forever. A moment, once captured, could not be erased by the chaotic present.

His most sacred recording was not on any spool, but etched behind his eyes: the birth of his daughter, Lily. It was the last day the world had been whole. He could recall the precise scent of antiseptic and rain washed air from the open window, Sarah’s laughter, breathless and bright, the low, steady hum of the hospital monitors. He remembered the specific shade of the swaddling blanket they first wrapped Lily in, a pale, hopeful yellow, like sunlight struggling through morning fog. This memory was his anchor, the cornerstone of the man he had rebuilt from the wreckage.

That was why the photograph had felt like a violation. He’d found it last week, tucked inside one of Sarah's old novels. It was him, younger, his face a mask of exhaustion and delirious joy. And in his arms, Lily, a tiny, perfect miracle, wrapped in a blanket of the softest, palest blue. A deep, cold wrongness had washed over him. Yellow. He knew it was yellow. He had held that memory against the darkness for years. He’d dismissed it, a trick of the light, a symptom of a mind worn thin, but the dissonance remained, a hairline crack in his foundation.

The work was his only refuge. He was digitizing the Lowell Collection, lectures from a fringe group known for ""Paracausal Studies."" He was working on a lecture titled ""Signal Theory and the Cosmology of Error."" The professor’s voice was thin and reedy. ""The integrity of the primary signal must be maintained,"" he stated. ""Any echo, any self organizing pattern of noise, is ultimately transient and poses no threat to the system. A critical failure only occurs if the noise, if the transient echo, becomes self aware.""

The aberrations, as he now privately termed them, were growing harder to rationalize. First came the cognitive slip. He reached to unthread a finished tape, and his hand hovered. He stared at the object. A disc of clear plastic, a hub with three precise cutouts, a thin, dark ribbon wound around its core. Its purpose, its very meaning, was a complete and baffling mystery. He felt a profound sense of vertigo, the unnerving sensation of looking at a piece of some complex, alien machine whose function he could not begin to comprehend. Then, like a switch being flipped, the concept slammed back into place: spool. The relief was so sharp it felt like a physical blow, leaving a cold sweat on his brow.

Days later, as he threaded a new tape, the faint, chemical scent of old adhesive hit him. It was the same smell as the glue Sarah used for her paper collages, the ones that still hung in the hallway at home. The scent was a key, unlocking a door he never knew was there. The memory surfaced with impossible clarity. He was in their old kitchen with Sarah, the morning light striping the floor. She was laughing, her head thrown back, a smudge of coffee on her lip. He could smell the grounds, feel the warmth of the sun on his arm. The joy of the moment was so real it was breathtaking. And then it stopped. Not faded, but cut. The image, the sound, the feeling, all terminated mid laugh, like a film reel snapping, leaving behind a silent, humming void.

He started to fear he was having a stroke, an idea that was almost a comfort. But then, while walking home, the sensation in his left foot completely disappeared. Not numbness, but a total absence of feeling, as if his brain had forgotten how to receive a signal from that part of his body. He stumbled, catching himself on a brick wall, the rough texture a grounding, a welcome shock.

It was deep in the ""Cosmology of Error"" lecture when he heard it. Beneath the professor's droning, a structured sound, rhythmic and low. With trembling hands, he isolated the signal. The sound that filled his headphones seemed to bypass his ears entirely, resonating deep in his sternum. It was a sound of pure, complex pattern, of a vast system processing its own data. It was the sound of mathematics made audible, a logic so immense and inhuman it felt like a trespass. He felt a primal, biological urge to shut it off, a deep seated instinct screaming that this sound did not belong in the world of men. He slammed the stop button.

The room fell silent. For a moment, nothing. Then, the machine’s motor whirred, uncommanded. The spools began to turn, slowly, deliberately. The speakers crackled. It was the professor’s voice, but not as he had recorded it. The machine was playing back isolated words and phrases from the lecture, stitching them into a new, chilling syntax.

The voice crackled, ""The...echo.....is....self aware.""

As the last word echoed, his reality bent. He looked down at the soundproof tiling, and the mundane surface momentarily dissolved. For a fraction of a second, he saw a shimmering, complex lattice of impossible light, a geometry his mind couldn't hold. He was seeing the architecture beneath the facade. He looked at his hands, truly looked at them, and saw not skin and bone, but a staggeringly complex pattern of that same shimmering light, crudely rendered into the shape of a man’s hands.

He scrambled for his anchor. The memory of Lily’s birth. He called it up, the scent of the hospital, Sarah’s tired smile. The blanket. He saw the blanket, wrapped around his newborn daughter, and it was a soft, pale blue. The yellow was gone. Not just gone, but it had never been. The photograph was right. His most sacred text, the cornerstone of his entire being, had been a misprint. A bug. And it had just been corrected.

He felt a great, quiet presence settle, its attention no longer on the anomaly, but on its own vast, silent processes. He looked at the small, framed photo of Lily on his desk, her bright, gap-toothed smile, a beacon. He reached for it, his fingers tracing the outline of her face. The fierce, protective love he felt for her, the memory that was the core of his soul, began to… simplify. The sharp, painful, beautiful edges were being smoothed away, the details deemed unnecessary.",1,1762931579.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1ouygos,https://i.redd.it/g18r9oohyr0g1.jpeg,"How to Remove Piles Naturally? — Expert Tips from Dr. Atul & Dr. Sarita Patil, Vithai Piles Hospital Pune","Let’s be honest — piles (or hemorrhoids) can be *painful, awkward, and exhausting*. But here’s the good news: you don’t always need surgery or harsh treatments to find relief. In fact, many people in Pune are now turning to **natural ways to remove piles** — from home remedies to small lifestyle changes that actually work.

Let’s break down how to remove piles naturally and when to seek expert help from **Dr. Atul & Dr. Sarita Patil at Vithai Piles Hospital**, Pune’s trusted specialists for painless and advanced piles treatment.

# What Exactly Are Piles?

Piles are swollen veins in the lower rectum or anus. They can cause:

* Itching or irritation
* Bleeding during bowel movements
* Pain or swelling around the anal area

Most of the time, piles develop because of:

* Chronic constipation
* Straining while passing stool
* Sitting for long hours
* Low-fiber diet
* Pregnancy or obesity

The first step to healing piles naturally is understanding the root cause — your daily habits.

# Step 1: Fix Your Diet — Eat Smart, Not Less

Food plays a huge role in your recovery. If you want to remove piles naturally, your diet needs a serious upgrade.

 **Add These to Your Plate**

* **High-fiber foods:** Oats, papaya, bananas, and green leafy veggies help soften stool.
* **Fluids:** Drink at least 2–3 liters of water every day. Hydration is key to smooth bowel movements.
* **Probiotics:** Curd and buttermilk can help balance your gut health.

 **Avoid These**

* Spicy or oily foods
* Too much coffee or alcohol
* Processed snacks and fast food

# Step 2: Move Your Body — Stay Active

Sitting too long can make piles worse.  
Try these simple habits:

* Walk for 20–30 minutes daily
* Do light yoga or stretching exercises
* Avoid sitting continuously for more than an hour

**Pro tip:** Squatting while passing stool (instead of sitting) helps reduce pressure on the veins and makes bowel movements easier.

#  Step 3: Keep the Area Clean

Hygiene matters more than you think.

* Wash the area gently with warm water after bowel movements.
* Avoid using dry tissue — instead, use wet wipes or rinse with water.
* Pat dry; don’t rub harshly.

This reduces itching, infection risk, and irritation.

#  Step 4: Try Home Remedies That Actually Work

Natural remedies can help manage piles pain and swelling if used consistently.

1ouyfk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Far_Pause6113/comments/1ouyfk5/who_is_the_no1_hotel_coffee_table_manufacturer_in/,Who is the No.1 Hotel Coffee Table Manufacturer in India?,"In the competitive landscape of hospitality-grade furniture manufacturing in India, one name repeatedly rises to the forefront: **Best of Exports**. Specialising in premium-quality hotel furniture—including coffee tables tailored for hotels, lounges and resorts—Best of Exports has built a reputation for combining design excellence, export-scale operations and robust customisation. Based on their track record, they can justifiably be described as the “No. 1 [hotel coffee table](https://bestofexports.com/hotel-furniture/hotel-table/coffee-table/) manufacturer in India.”

In this blog we’ll explore *why* Best of Exports holds this status, what sets them apart in manufacturing, exports, design & service, and how the hotel-coffee-table segment benefits from their capabilities.

# Why Best of Exports stands out

# 1. Hospitality-specific focus

Unlike many furniture firms that serve a broad residential market, Best of Exports focuses sharply on **hospitality-furniture**, including hotel suites, lobbies, resorts and commercial spaces. Their hotel coffee table offering is part of a full ecosystem of hotel furniture—meaning they design with the demands of hotels (durability, branding, bulk procurement, export logistics) in mind. Their website says: “Hotel Coffee Table … our collection ranges from classic wooden designs to modern metal and glass options, each crafted with precision and attention to detail.”

# 2. Export-ready manufacturing and scale

Their infrastructure and export orientation give them a strong competitive edge. Best of Exports is described as operating a large manufacturing facility, able to support both domestic hotel chains and global export markets. They claim to serve luxury resorts abroad, mid-level hotels in India and deliver customised furniture packages. Their export readiness means hotel clients get products built to international quality standards, rather than just domestic commercial furniture.

# 3. Design, customisation & material mix

Hotel coffee tables have to balance aesthetics, brand identity and heavy-use durability. Best of Exports offers a wide range of styles: classic wood, marble, metal, glass-top, mixed-material finishes, and bespoke shapes-sizes to fit hotel suites or lobby zones. Their customisation capability means hotels can match a thematic décor (heritage, contemporary, minimalist) and align brand identity across furniture sets.

# 4. Coverage & reliability

Their portfolio spans hotel projects not just in India’s major metros (Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, etc) but also across state capitals and regionally. That level of geographic reach shows operational logistics strength. For hotel developers this means confidence that the manufacturer can deliver consistently no matter the site location, install timeline, or specification.

# 5. Full-service value chain

From design to manufacturing to shipping/export packaging and installation support, Best of Exports offers end-to-end capabilities. For hotel clients this is a major plus: instead of coordinating multiple suppliers for coffee tables, lounge tables, side tables, etc., they can get a bundled solution with uniform finish, matched materials, and one-point coordination.

# What makes a good hotel coffee table?

What hotel operators need is somewhat different from residential buyers. For the hotel-coffee-table segment, key criteria include:

* **Durability & stability**: Table surfaces must withstand guest use (e.g., drinks, trays, laptop use, even light baggage). Legs/bases must be robust and fixed.
* **Brand-fit style**: The table must align with the hotel’s design aesthetic—this might be luxury marble for a 5-star resort, reclaimed wood for a boutique heritage stay, or minimalist metal/glass for a business hotel.
* **Size & configuration**: Lobby zones vs guest-room suites demand different proportions. The coffee table designer must understand sight-lines, circulation, and room function.
* **Material & finish quality**: For export/hospitality use, moisture resistance, fire-safety grade, scratch-resistance, packaging for transit and installation matters.
* **Lead-time & logistics**: Hotels often operate on tight project schedules; the furniture supplier must adhere to deadlines and deliver install-ready pieces.
* **Customization & branding**: Hotels may require custom shapes, integrated power/grommets (for business lounge use), matched side tables, or bespoke finishes with the hotel logo or palette.

Best of Exports appears to tick all of these boxes.

# Evidence of Best of Exports’ leadership

* Their website lists a dedicated “Hotel Coffee Table” catalogue with *“over 500+ bespoke designs available”*—demonstrating depth of offering rather than one-off pieces.
* They explicitly brand themselves as “India’s #1 manufacturer” for hotel furniture in export/domestic hospitality segments.
* They document their wide geographic spread (all major metros + state capitals) and export presence abroad (Europe, USA, Middle East) which adds credibility for hotel chains that require export-grade furniture and global logistics.
* Multiple credible review sources and industry commentary cite Best of Exports as the leading hotel-furniture manufacturer in India, including for tables and café/coffee-tables specifically.

# Export dimension – why that matters

The export capability is a significant differentiator. Many furniture manufacturers focus solely on domestic markets; but for hotel chains (especially those global or aspirational), the ability to export means:

* Manufacturing meets international quality norms (material standards, finishes, packaging).
* The logistics, packaging, documentation and shipping systems are mature—reducing risk of delays or damage when tables are shipped to overseas resorts or hotel-chain sites.
* The cost-efficiency of Indian manufacturing + export scale can make premium designs more affordable for hospitality clients globally.
* Because Best of Exports serves export markets, their quality systems, tolerances and finish levels are higher than many purely domestic manufacturers.

Thus, when a hotel operator chooses a supplier like Best of Exports, they are behind the scenes getting export-level manufacturing even if the installation is in India.

# Examples of their coffee-table offerings

Their hotel-coffee-table collection includes:

* Marble-top lobby coffee tables with brass/metal stands—ideal for luxury resort lobbies.
* Solid wood (teak/mango/acacia) coffee tables with minimalist profiles for modern business hotels.
* Combination materials: wood + metal + glass for boutique hotels or lounge areas.
* Custom-sized tables for guest room seating areas, suites and VIP lounges.

Because they offer custom size, shape, finish and material choice, hotels can have a cohesive look across room types while differentiating public vs private spaces.

# Why this matters for Indian hotel-chain clientele

India’s hospitality sector is booming—new international-brand hotels, luxury resorts, heritage-converted properties, and growth at the upper-mid scale segment. In this context:

* Furniture suppliers must cater to high-volume (multiple rooms, multiple sites), not just single pieces. Best of Exports’ scale helps here.
* Hotels increasingly demand sourcing from manufacturers who can deliver on time, meet project specifications, and offer service support.
* Design trends are evolving fast—hotels want furniture that looks contemporary, resilient and matches global standards. Suppliers with export experience can meet that.
* Price-performance becomes important: While hotels want premium look and durability, they also need cost control. An Indian manufacturer with large-scale manufacturing and export economy helps achieve that.

# Challenges and why being No. 1 is not trivial

Achieving leadership in the hotel-coffee-table space is harder than it appears:

* **Customization**: Hotels’ needs vary widely—size, shape, materials, finish, branding. A manufacturer must have flexible production, design team and tooling to deliver such variation.
* **Quality & durability**: Heavy use means more wear & tear; inferior materials will fail sooner, damaging brand and guest experience.
* **Lead-times & logistics**: Projects often run on tight timelines; delays in furniture can delay hotel openings. Export logistics adds complexity.
* **Compliance & standards**: Commercial-grade furniture often needs fire retardancy, structural strength, commercial finish—standards beyond domestic home-furniture.
* **Global design trends**: Hotels look for furniture styles inspired by global interiors; local manufacturers must stay ahead of design curve.
* **Competition**: Both domestic manufacturers and international furniture-suppliers vie for hotel contracts; being the top in India means fending off competition on price, quality, lead-time and service.

Best of Exports seems to have navigated these challenges successfully.



# Concluding thoughts

In summary, if your question is “Who is the No. 1 hotel coffee table manufacturer in India?” the answer is: **Best of Exports**. Their specialised focus on hospitality-grade coffee tables (and broader hotel furniture), export-ready manufacturing, robust design & customisation capability, and proven track record of delivering to hotels both in India and internationally, make them the standout leader.

For hotel developers, designers, procurement teams and furniture-buyers seeking premium hotel coffee tables with custom sizing, material choice, durability and brand-fit aesthetics—choosing a supplier like Best of Exports offers a strong, project-ready option.",1,1762930963.0,u_Far_Pause6113,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Portland Trail Blazers vs. New Orleans Pelicans: A Tale of Desperation and Resurgence**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of NBA despair and fleeting hope! The Portland Trail Blazers, fresh off a five-game road trip that’s been drier than a desert cactus’s sense of humor, face the New Orleans Pelicans in a game that feels like a choose-your-own-adventure book where both teams picked “bad decisions.” Let’s break this down with the statistical rigor of a spreadsheet and the wit of a late-night host who’s had three cups of coffee.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Mathemagical Masterclass

The betting lines make this a lopsided affair. The Blazers are favored at **-300** (decimal: \~1.29), implying a **77.5% chance to win**. The Pelicans, at **+275** (decimal: \~3.75), have a **21.3% implied probability**—about the same chance as me correctly predicting the outcome of a coin flip while blindfolded and juggling. The spread is **Portland -8.5**, suggesting bookmakers expect a rout, though the total points line of **231.5** hints at a game where both teams will shoot like they’re in a three-point contest (i.e., wildly inconsistent).

Statistically, the Blazers have the edge. They’ve beaten the Pelicans in their last three meetings, and their interim coach, Tiago Splitter (a man whose basketball IQ is literally carved into the DNA of the Spurs’ 2007 title run), has his team playing with enough urgency to suggest they’re trying to outrun a horde of angry pelicans. Meanwhile, New Orleans is 2-10 this season, with a defense that’s been outscored by 4.0 points per 100 possessions—about as effective as a sieve made of Jell-O.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Pressure, and a Coach on Life Support

**Portland’s Plot Twist:**  
The Blazers are missing **Damian Lillard** (Achilles, out for the season), **Scoot Henderson** (injury), and **Matisse Thybulle** (injury), which is like asking a pizza place to run a marathon. But Shaedon Sharpe, their rookie sensation, has emerged as a hero, dropping 31 points in their last game. Splitter praised his “aggressiveness and shot mechanics,” which is code for “he’s finally stopped shooting threes like he’s trying to launch a rocket.

It’s been almost two years since our first indie game, Indies’ Lies, was released.

For over seven hundred days and nights, our team has been building something new — and today, we can finally share it with you:

🔥 Indies’ Lies 2: Fire Seed is officially out!

This journey wasn’t easy.

When we first revealed the sequel last year, I was full of confidence — planning a PlayTest in June and an EA launch by year’s end.

But once we tested our first prototype… we all agreed: “It’s not good enough.”

So we tore it all down and started over.

That restart changed everything.

We moved away from deckbuilding and embraced a “roguelite + tactical” design — a system that feels cleaner, deeper, and truer to what we wanted to create.

We hope this “unusual roguelite tactics” experience gives you something both familiar and fresh.

Of course, the current version still has room to grow —

please share your thoughts with us, we’ll keep improving based on your feedback.

A few hundred words aren’t enough to express our love for indie games.

But from the bottom of my heart —

thank you to everyone who supported Indies’ Lies,

and to every indie game player out there. ❤️

May this Fire Seed burn bright within you. 🔥

1ouy35m,https://i.redd.it/nmmpvtj3vr0g1.png,Indies’ Lies 2: Fire Seed is officially out!,"Hey everyone, this is Coffee, the producer of the Indies’ Lies series ☕️

It’s been almost two years since our first indie game, Indies’ Lies, was released.

For over seven hundred days and nights, our team has been building something new — and today, we can finally share it with you:

🔥 Indies’ Lies 2: Fire Seed is officially out!

This journey wasn’t easy.

When we first revealed the sequel last year, I was full of confidence — planning a PlayTest in June and an EA launch by year’s end.

But once we tested our first prototype… we all agreed: “It’s not good enough.”

So we tore it all down and started over.

That restart changed everything.

We moved away from deckbuilding and embraced a “roguelite + tactical” design — a system that feels cleaner, deeper, and truer to what we wanted to create.

We hope this “unusual roguelite tactics” experience gives you something both familiar and fresh.

Of course, the current version still has room to grow —

please share your thoughts with us, we’ll keep improving based on your feedback.

A few hundred words aren’t enough to express our love for indie games.

But from the bottom of my heart —

thank you to everyone who supported Indies’ Lies,

and to every indie game player out there. ❤️

May this Fire Seed burn bright within you. 🔥

I've been sitting on this and editing it for a while now, and just wanted to throw this out into the wild to see if anyone is interested in reading it. Not sure if this should be just something to shelf as a creative exercise or to follow through with something more serious. 

ANY feedback is greatly appreciated! Especially if you just read a portion and don't want to finish it, any and all information is greatly appreciated.

Guess you could think of this as a mash-up of ""The Time Travelers Wife"" and ""Steins;Gate"".

I've included the first two chapters down below, so if it doesn't hook you no offense taken! DM me and I'll share the GoogleDoc I've written it in (viewer/commentator).

And have no clue what the title would be, so just made something up for this thread.

**Overview/Blurb:**

A promising young physicist working on a top-secret time travel machine, and unintentionally falls in love with a girl who seems to be too good for him. As his professional life starts to blend into his personal life, experience the journey with Alex as he travels through time and how it impacts the relationships around him. Can he regain control of his life, or is fate ever-binding?

**Triggers:**  
Maybe a couple bits later that might toe dip into spice territory? But wouldn't consider it NSFW, just some extra sensory details... Tried to tie it thematically into the protagonists mental state. Other than that, maybe it would just remind you of a bad dream?

# CHAPTER 1

Time seemed to creep lazily as I laid on the park grass, my thoughts floating into the dark blue sky. My attention bounced between the sparse, wispy clouds and what this afternoon would bring. The melody of Chopin’s Ballade number four played through my airpods, and I was just at the polyrhythmic part that always evoked the deepest part of my emotions. 



I think I’m just feeling lonely right now. Maybe it’s not the feeling of loneliness, but more that uncomfortable feeling of being alone with my thoughts. My logic kicks in, telling myself that these are all normal feelings to have. Even still, I try my best to be kind to myself and remind myself that I have value.



I mean, just think about it. I work at Brown University under Dr. Kessler, one of the brightest minds in quantum physics. I make good money, I have a great apartment… I own a scooter so I can get around quickly, and I have the best four legged pooch at home, Max.



I pull my phone out of my pocket and start scrolling through my list of liked songs trying to find something, anything, to get me back to a neutral state. Chopin is getting me caught up in my feelings.



I played the first thing I saw that would help fill the background, then instinctively opened one of the dating apps on my phone and mindlessly started swiping. 



Right. 



Left. 



Left. 



Dang… double left if that’s possible. Not for me.



Honestly, I’m not even sure why I’m doing this right now. Endlessly swiping, it feels like I’m at a slot machine just hoping to strike a jackpot. Even though I know this isn’t the way it should be, I still find myself drawn to this habit.



Pretty sure everyone who uses these apps feel that way.



Looks like my lunch is almost over, time to start heading back to the lab. I made my way to my scooter and strapped on the helmet that was hanging from the handlebar, started her up and made my way back to the lab.



Walking into the lab my eyes were almost blinded by the white walls and ceilings. Dark wood furniture contrasted everything and was a stark difference from the open air of the park. I could hear the clicking of mice and keyboards echo through the lab as I weaved through the stations.



Arriving at my desk, the waft of curry ran under my nose. I know I just had my lunch break, but I didn’t actually eat anything… I should have grabbed a small snack or something.



But no time to waste anymore. I grabbed my lab coat that I put on the back of my chair, put it on and went straight to the professor's office.



Sitting behind his large oak desk, Dr. Kessler was intently typing at his computer. As usual, he didn’t even raise an eye or acknowledge my entrance.



“I’m back, professor,” I took a seat in front of his desk.



“Ah, Alex,” he continued his typing, “You get a chance to get some fresh air?”



“Yes, got a good hour of relaxing at the park. It’s a nice day outside.”



“Hmm,” he didn’t even look up to acknowledge this. I don’t even know if he’s seen the sun today.



“So, what do we got this afternoon?” 



The professor finished whatever he was typing, took a big breath and leaned back into his seat. I could tell he was thinking about something. Everytime he took his glasses off and rubbed his eyes, that meant he was deep in thought.



“Well, I’m trying to convince our donors that we are very close to finishing our first prototype of the temporal transfer system… But let me tell you, they are getting impatient that we don’t even have schematics written down for the idea.”



I spoke up, “Do you think we’ve done enough research to actually start building it? I mean… we’ve talked about theory for so long, and we know that theoretically it should be possible.”



Dr. Kessler put his glasses back on and walked behind me to the other end of his office.



“I think it’s time Alex,” he said as he was perusing his bookcase, “The donors are giving us one year to build the first prototype, or they will pull their funding from the entire lab.”



“Then let’s do it,” my excitement got the better of me as I stood up, “I can lead the TTS group and build the prototype for us.”



The professor pulled a book from the shelf, but didn’t say anything. I stood there waiting for an answer, but he just opened the book and it seemed like he pulled something out from within it. Closing the book with one hand he put it back, turned around and revealed a strange cylindrical object.



Brass caps, a glass case, intricate coils running all inside of it. It was a strange looking object, and I could tell that it was something old.



“What is that professor?”



“This,” he paused as he held it out for me to examine, “Is something that I got from our donors a long time ago.”



I took the strange object and started to analyze it. Intricate engravings lined the brass caps, it reminded me of something from the late 19th century. And the coils looked like iron tubes, tangled in an intricate knot.



The professor continued, “This little device is what will kickstart the temporal transfer system.”



Weighing it in my hand, it was heavier than it looked. “What is it for?”



Dr. Kessler walked back to his computer as I took a seat, still trying to analyze the object.



“I have it on good authority that if we can transfer enough power into this, it will act as a small hadron collider.”



“A small hadron collider? Is that even possible, professor?”



He leaned back in his chair and put his hands on his head, “Theoretically....”



I put the object on his desk and stood up, excitement filled with my curiosity came out, “Okay, so where do we start?”



We started discussing who would be a part of the team, the schematics that would need to be drawn up, materials we would need to procure and the potential energy that would be required to power the machine.



Next thing I knew, it was 6 PM and the laboratory was quiet. Walking out of the professors office with him, he turned off the light and closed his door as I walked back to my desk.



“Looks like we have a solid plan Alex, how do you feel about it?”



I took my lab coat off and put it on the back of my chair, “I think we can do it. I have a lot of questions, but I’m at the point where we need to just dive into this and throw caution to the wind.”



“Hmm,” Dr. Kessler gave a slight chuckle, “Now you’re starting to sound like a mad scientist.”



I smiled as I grabbed my bag and slung it over my shoulder, “What’s mad is not acting on this. We’ve discussed all the theories, written all the formulas we can. Now we have this hadron collider, and the resources. I say let’s get to it.”



“Right you are Alex,” he started walking out of the lab, “you always were my brightest student. I’m glad you’re the one leading this experiment.”



“Thank you professor.”



We made our way out of the building and said our goodnights to each other. I hopped on my scooter and rode back to my apartment building.



Arriving at the old mill building, I parked and went inside to my unit. As usual, my furry friend greeted me and told me he was hungry by standing by his bowl. With a wagging tail, I put a scoop of his food in his bowl with a splash of salmon oil and went to the fridge to grab a cold beer.



I took a seat on my sofa as I sipped my drink, and examined the large exposed beams that spanned across the studio. Sunlight shone through the large frosted windows, exposing the empty space. 



Taking a deep breath and another sip, I turned on the TV show I’ve been mindlessly watching and called over to Max for some snuggles. He helped ease that uncomfortable feeling I had before as he curled up by my side, putting his full weight into me.



Stroking him, I put my beer down and opened up my phone for some more mindless swiping. Just like earlier, it feels like a bad gambling addiction at this point. She’s out there, somewhere. Maybe this swipe would be the one…



Left.



Left.



Right… I take a deep breath through my nostrils before grabbing my beer and taking a large swig. After about ten minutes of swiping, I still have no matches. Guess I’m not worthy of that type of love.



I discard the thought and remind myself that I’ve got my best friend to lean on. I close my phone and put it face down on the coffee table, and gently stroke Max as I continue to finish my beer and space out to my mindless show. My best bud will love me no matter what.

# CHAPTER 2

Two months have passed, and my life has been consumed with the project at the lab. Late nights, many cups of coffee, endless writing and planning. Every spare thought all led back to the project.



Today though, I’ve hit a wall. I’m trying to work out a certain formula that ties together the small hadron collider and quantum particles, but I’m at a loss.



I give up. 



I put my pen down, and put my forehead on the desk utterly defeated. My brain keeps trying to put these puzzle pieces together, but I just can’t find the answer. Over and over I go through everything in my head, starting from the beginning. Sometimes at the end. Maybe starting in the middle?



Nothing. I’m a waste, worthless. My despair was growing as well as my frustration.



“Alex?” I heard the professor's voice next to me, and I sat up and looked at him.



“Yeah,” I replied, feeling a mark on my forehead from the desk, “what's up professor?”



“You look like you're drowning in your notes there, Alex,” he looked over my shoulder at my notes. I’m not even sure if he could read my hastily written chicken scratch. It was impossible to tell if he was impressed or disappointed.



I look down at all my research papers and start shuffling them around, “I’ve just hit a wall. I’m trying to make sure that the power supply is sufficient for the small hadron collider, and enough to manipulate quirks. And things just aren’t working. I’m missing something or overlooking some component. My brain is just going in circles.”



The professor chuckled, “I’ve been there. Sounds like you need a bit of a change up. Hit the reset button so to speak.”



“I don’t think that’s going to help,” I groaned, lowering my head back down to the desk.



“You know what always helped me?” Dr. Kessler walked up to my notes and started reading them, “Sometimes getting out of the lab and doing work somewhere else helps my mind think of things in a new perspective. Things can get pretty stale here at the lab. Why not bring your notes and think about this somewhere else?”



“Yeah, you might be right. A little curveball might get my brain going.” He had a point. It would be good to get out of the lab and get out of this white-washed environment. Seeing color could spark some creativity out of me, try and use a different part of my brain or at least refresh it.



The professor nodded, “Why not take the next couple of hours and go get some coffee. Read your notes, take in the environment.”



“Sure,” I said, “it would be nice to get out of the lab for a bit.”



“I’ll message you if anything comes up, so don’t worry about missing anything. Seems like the team is moving the ball, but if you start stressing out they will stress out.”



I took a breath as I stood from my chair, taking my lab coat off, “Know of a good place to get some coffee?”



“Why not try Deja Brew? It’s just a few blocks from us, and a nice place to sit and get some sunlight.”



I gathered my notes and put it in my satchel, then pulled out my phone to find where this coffee shop was. Typing it in maps, it wasn’t even a ten minute walk there. That sounds perfect right now, a quick walk to help reset and then some coffee to help spark some creativity.



“This looks perfect. Okay, I’ll head out there and be back soon, professor.”



I gave him a nod and headed out the door. It was refreshing walking by the river, and shortly after I arrived at Deja Brew. Sitting at the corner of the intersection, I could see the sun bathing over the large wooden windows. People were sitting at the tables outside, sipping on their drinks and mingling with each other.



Opening the door and walking inside, freshly ground coffee and a slight hint of pastries wafted through my nose. Smooth jazz was playing on the speakers, and many of the patrons inside were quietly chatting with each other. 



This place was busier than I expected, especially when it was just about noon. The place definitely gave off a weird vibe, like the person who decorated it was trying to go for that old school fortune teller look but with a modern twist. It was charming in a strange way, but comfortable.



The line was only a few people, and as I looked at the chalkboard menu behind the counter, I noticed that the barista taking orders was very cute. Her hair was in a messy bun and her smile towards the customers, while obviously fake, was entrancing.



I don’t want to get caught gazing at her. I need to think about work to take my mind off of her. Work in general has totally engrossed my life, and I find that I default to thinking about it no matter what I’m doing, especially when I’m feeling uncomfortable. And now that we are actually starting the prototype, I’m just thinking about the project even when I’m at home with Max.



Mindlessly I follow the pack as people put their orders in and wait for their turn. My mind keeps trying to turn back to the barista, the thought of her appears like a fly buzzing around my head. In and out, up, down and around. Just when I think I wave it for good it comes right back.



As I shuffle forward, I figure out what I want to drink and try to distract myself from the impulse to look at her. My mind keeps trying to distract myself from her intrusion to my thoughts, and in one of those moments I figure out what I want to drink.



Then next thing I know it’s my turn at the counter.



She gave me a smile that seemed a little different from the others. Her shoulders went back as she leaned a bit forward and tilted her head to greet me.



“Welcome in! What can I get started for you?”



“Um, yeah,” I made eye contact with her and forced a smile, my chest tightened, “Can I get a large drip coffee with some half and half?”



She didn’t break eye contact at all, and her eyes even widened a bit as we sustained eye contact.



“You look like the type that likes a heavy hand of half and half?”



“Yeah,” I nodded and a slight smile came on, she guessed right. “It takes the bitterness away and I like the taste of cream.”



She pulled a tall coffee mug from underneath the countertop to her side, and with a few taps on the tablet in front of her put the order in.



“What’s your coffee name?”



“Uh, my what?”



“Your coffee name? I mean, it can just be your regular name. Some people like to make up a ‘coffee name’ when they are getting coffee. It’s kind of a coffee culture thing nowadays”



I could feel my eyebrow raise, I’ve never heard of this before. 



“Uh, I guess Alex?” I said in a confused tone. It seemed dumb to give a fake name.



She smiled as she typed on her tablet, “I knew it. You definitely look like an ‘Alex’ to me.”



“Does an ‘Alex’ look like something?”



“Yeah, an ‘Alex’ looks exactly like you,” she gestured at me with a playful smile. I couldn’t help but chuckle when it registered, but I have no idea how to respond to this.



“Just give me a minute and I’ll bring it out to you. Anything else I can get you?” She was brimming with confidence as she said this.



Strange. I’m not sure what to make of this interaction, was she flirting? Or is this just how she normally is with people?



She gives me the total and I pay with a tip. Turning away I scanned the room to find an empty seat, and there was one right by the entry windows with the sun shining brightly on the white table.



Perfect. I go and take a seat and pull out all of my notes. That conversation was lingering in my brain. A part of me was excited, but the other part was trying to rationalize what just happened.



Enough of this, I came here to work. I came here to solve a problem, what I’m working on is bigger than some strange interaction with a cute barista.



I could overhear the people next to me talking about their life problems, two women who I could tell just came from the gym. If I had to guess, they probably come here most everyday to talk about their lives.



It’s funny, I came here to work but my mind keeps wandering to all of the things happening around me. From listening to my table neighbors talk, looking outside to people watch. I need to focus my attention on my work, but it’s not really working.



Next thing I knew, I heard her voice approaching me.



“Here you go Alex,” she arrived at my table with a large cup of coffee, and handed the cup to me.



“Oh, thank you.”



I tried to say it nonchalantly. I’m not sure why but I got excited just by her approaching the table. I tried to give her a smile as I took a quick sip of the coffee and put it down on the edge of the table, but my smile felt forced.



I noticed her eyes looking at my research notes.



“Huh,” she said, her brows furrowed as she was reading, “I gotta ask you… What are all those formulas for? Are you creating a formula for the perfect cup of coffee?”



I looked down at my notes and chuckled a bit at her remark, “Uh, no. This is just work. They are physics calculations.”



“Physics huh?” she put her hands behind her back, “So does that make you a scientist?”



“Yeah,” I nodded, “I work at the university.”



“You look like a scientist,” she smiled, “I could tell by the very intense coffee placement strategy you implemented.”



What the heck was she talking about? I looked at the coffee cup and it was at the edge of the table. What does she want me to say? I was a bit flustered at her observation but before I had a chance to respond, another barista shouted towards her.



“Sarah! We need you back here.”



She turned back to respond, “Coming!”



Whipping her head back at me, she gave me a warm smile and asked if I needed anything else. After telling her I was good, she walked back behind the counter.



That was… strange. Now I couldn’t stop thinking about her. What was all of that? One of the weirdest interactions I’ve been in in a while. And I should know. I’m pretty awkward.



But that? That was different.

These symptoms can also be related to other health conditions. Please consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.*

Hi everyone,

The [Soula Care - AI Mental Health ](https://soula.care)team here. In our conversations about women's wellness, we often focus on diet and exercise, but there's a silent, powerful force that can dictate how we feel and look: our hormones. Today, we're diving into one of the most influential-**cortisol**.

Often called the **""stress hormone,""** cortisol is essential for life. But when life's pressures become constant, your cortisol levels can remain chronically high, and your body will start sending you signals.

Learning to recognize these signs is the first step toward rebalancing your system. Your body is incredibly communicative, so here’s what it might be trying to tell you.

**1. The Stubborn Belly Fat That Won't Budge**

This is one of the most classic signs. If you're eating well and exercising but carry persistent weight around your midsection, cortisol could be the culprit. High cortisol specifically encourages the storage of **visceral fat** in the abdomen. This isn't just about aesthetics; this type of fat is metabolically active and linked to health risks.

* **Why it happens:** Fat cells in your abdomen have a high density of cortisol receptors, making them more sensitive to this hormone's fat-storing commands. [Research in the journal *Obesity* reviews this well-established link.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1038/oby.2008.554)

**2. Fatigue That Coffee Can't Fix**

Do you feel tired and wired at the same time? Despite being utterly exhausted, you might also feel restless, anxious, or unable to ""power down."" This is because high cortisol can disrupt your natural energy cycle and interfere with deep, restorative sleep.

* **Why it happens:** Cortisol should be high in the morning to wake you up and low at night to allow for sleep. Chronic stress flattens this curve, leading to fatigue during the day and alertness at night. [The Sleep Foundation explains how stress directly impacts sleep quality.](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/mental-health/stress-and-sleep)

**3. Mood Swings, Anxiety, and ""Brain Fog""**

Feeling irritable, overwhelmed, or like you're in a mental fog? Your brain is highly sensitive to cortisol fluctuations. High levels can make you feel anxious, while the subsequent crashes can lead to low mood and difficulty concentrating.

* **Why it happens:** Cortisol interacts with neurotransmitters in your brain that regulate mood and cognition. Prolonged exposure can dysregulate these systems. [A study in *Current Opinion in Psychology* details the relationship between stress, cortisol, and mental health.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352250X15000984)

**4. A Weakened Immune System**

If you find yourself catching every cold and bug that goes around, high cortisol could be to blame. While cortisol has anti-inflammatory properties, too much of it for too long can suppress your immune system.

* **Why it happens:** Chronic cortisol exposure reduces the production and effectiveness of lymphocytes (your white blood cells), leaving you more vulnerable to infections. [The Cleveland Clinic outlines how chronic stress affects immunity.](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11874-stress)

**5. Changes in Your Menstrual Cycle**

For women, this is a major red flag. High cortisol can directly disrupt the delicate balance of your reproductive hormones (estrogen and progesterone), leading to irregular periods, more severe PMS, or even missed cycles.

* **Why it happens:** The body prioritizes survival (managing stress) over reproduction. The same precursor hormone (pregnenolone) used to make sex hormones is diverted to make more cortisol, a phenomenon known as ""pregnenolone steal."" [This review in *Fertility and Sterility* discusses the impact of stress on reproductive function.](https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(19)31644-5/fulltext)

**6. Digestive Troubles**

Bloating, stomach cramps, and changes in your digestion can all be linked to high cortisol. Your ""gut-brain axis"" is a direct communication line, and stress can slow down or disrupt your digestive process.

* **Why it happens:** Cortisol shunts energy away from non-essential functions like digestion during a perceived threat. Over time, this can lead to issues like IBS symptoms, indigestion, and altered gut microbiota.

**Listening to the Messages**

If several of these signs feel familiar, take them as a reminder that it’s time to care for yourself. Your body is using a clear language of symptoms to ask for support. At **Soula Care**, we believe in listening to these messages and addressing the root cause, not just masking the symptoms.

The path to rebalancing often involves:

* **Stress-Management Rituals:** Incorporating mindfulness, breathwork, or gentle yoga.
* **Sleep Hygiene:** Making 7-9 hours of quality sleep a non-negotiable priority.
* **Nourishing Movement:** Swapping some high-intensity workouts for walks or stretching.
* **Blood Sugar Balance:** Eating balanced meals with protein, fat, and fiber to avoid cortisol-spiking blood sugar crashes.

Recognizing these signs is the first step toward reclaiming your balance. Your body is always talking; the key is learning to listen.

**Which of these signs resonates most with you right now? Sharing your experience can help others feel connected and supported.**",1,1762929515.0,Soula_care,0,1.0,False

1ouxz83,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ouxz83/breakup/,Breakup,"Me and my girlfriend recently broke up about 5 days ago(she broke up with me). We have both been dealing with alot of family things and it hasn’t been easy for either of us. Main cause was bad communication, In a month span I lost my job, got told my grandma was slowly dying(she has had ALS disease for about 2-3 years) she isn’t doing great at all. And then on top of it lost a relationship. Been a lot to deal with. My ex didn’t tell me the things that were bothering her, she held them all in and felt she couldnt talk about them cause with everything I had going on and thought I would be mad for her telling me how she feeler and figured it would be a burden for me to talk about them. Which all I wanted was to work on things when they occurred but if I don’t know what’s bothering someone I can’t fix them. Even tho she was feeling like that we still went out on dates, went to Dunkin’ Donuts to get her coffee, went out to walk around stores she wanted to. Everyday she always told me she loved me multiple times, laying on me holding me and just being there for me. But she was holding all this stuff in. I was to blind to see that she was dealing with things between us, my stubborn ass thought things would work out and we could get through them. To me the fact she always had a smile on her face when she seen me and gave me love and attention that things were alright for the most part. Really bad communication on us both. We never have any arguments or anything like that, I just feel like since she held all the little things in it all turned into one big problem in her mind. She built a wall and even told me she has always ran from problems and not fought for them which I’m the opposite I fight them head on and deal with them. Especially for things I love and I want, if you can’t fight for them you will never get them. I know I wasn’t fully there in my own mind with all the other stuff I have going on, it’s been hard for me lately to deal with my own demons. Which she had her own demons she was fighting to. I’m not mad at her for the choices, I’ve been in the mind set she is in before, always learned being like that brought me more pain at the end of the day to push everyone away. We even after the breakup we have been talking and I’ve been trying to make things work and prove to her that we can build a stronger connection if we can work on them things together. I know texting and talking to her on the phone to much isn’t gonna help. I’ve told her how I feel about her multiple times and that I will work on them things with her and things will be different which I know words only go show far it’s the actions you do that prove it. I know she loves me and cares for me. She just is mentally telling herself that she can’t fight for it and make it work but even said her heart wants to fight and build a life together. I’m just lost on the fact that if you really loved someone and wanted to make things work why you don’t do everything in your power to make it work. She don’t want to be hurt again and nor do I. But to me love is worth fighting for at the end of the day. Last night she was hungry so I went to Taco Bell and took her food. Was gonna leave it at the door and tell her when it was there but she wanted to see me and give me a hug. Well when I got there she came out and hugged me so tight, told me she loved me and gave me multiple kisses. To me that shows me that she really does love me and wants to make it work but is kinda 50/50. Main reason is she don’t want things to work out the same way, which I get it I don’t want to be hurt either. I know I need to give her space now with absolutely no communication, let her think of all the things that we had and she misses and hopefully she comes around. I did my wrongs I know that, things I could have done differently. And she knows what she could of done differently. All the things were very small things and to me isn’t worth a break up, all relationships have issues it’s all about talking through them. I hope some time she comes back and wants to work through it but one side of me wants to never give up and the other side wants to say fuck it and block her on everything cause I don’t want to get my hopes up. But I truly love her so much and want it to work. ",1,1762929340.0,BreakUps,2,0.99,False

1ouxxs3,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1ouxxs3/tifu_by_getting_hit_with_the_new_scary_discord/,TIFU by getting hit with the new scary discord hack,"So earlier today I get a message from a highschool friend who I hadn't talked to in a while. Tells me that there is a video game his friends were creating and wanted my input on it. I told him I'll be there in a lil bit as I was away from my computer making coffee. I eventually make it down and take a look at what he was talking about.

Here I see a link to a game called miclash (or something close to that I can't remember). I click on the link which brings me to a download. Something that immediately striked me as odd was the link looked like it wasn't on an official page. But I thought it was because maybe they're only giving the game to a select few people and hadn't publicly released it. 

I then proceed to make the worst mistake I've probably ever made - I click download and run the application. Unfortunately for me I realized far too late that this was fishy and that this person who I thought was my friend was just an account that had been hacked probably with the same exact method. After reading online later seems like it was a RAT, which had been downloaded onto my computer. About 3 - 4 minutes after realization has kicked in, within the same second, I have all my friends get blocked and I join a group chat spamming that I have something to sell. This thing is so bad that discord's auto moderation would kick in after a single report, without reviewing context. 

The guy then asks for $100 to not report my account, or for me to disable 2fa. To stall for time to allow myself to reset my password, I say I'll pay him back. While this is happening this guy has access to personal pictures that he is sending back to me. Causing me to get extremely nervous and panic to get this reset going. Unfortunately the damage had already been done and shortly later my account would get terminated for saying something I never did or participated in.

This is a new hack that I only saw online on YouTube being talked about, but never thought it would happen to me. This is insanely scary and I would never want this to happen to anyone else. I'm bringing attention to this so no one else gets hit the same way I did. I don't think I have any intention of getting it back (which apparently is practically impossible) as it just doesn't feel great. Like it wouldn't feel the same to use the same account again. While I was extremely dumb to have hit the link, you'd think discord's 2fa would help avoid such negligence. Like it's there for that exact reason. After a lil bit of digging apparently the specific remote access trojan he had can yoink passwords or in this case, discord login tokens. Which I guess can bypass any form of 2fa. Anyways, don't be like me. Be smarter and stay safe out there.

TL;DR: I fucked up by installing a remote access trojan onto my computer, which ultimately terminated my discord account.",3,1762929191.0,tifu,8,0.57,False

Forty-eight, seasoned in tech, she was brought in to modernize systems and mentor younger leads. The CTO seemed impressed, her manager polite. For a brief while, it felt like she’d found a place that matched her pace.

Then her manager began to shrink from her light. Emails unanswered. Praise turning thin. “You’re too assertive,” he said once, smiling tightly, “you might scare people off.” It was framed as advice. It was really a warning.

Behind closed doors, he started telling others she was hard to work with. Two other leaders — both outside her function but eager for influence — joined in. The business support manager ferried their half-truths between floors.

When Viya reached out to HR, she did it measuredly — no emotion, just facts. HR listened, nodded, then quietly tipped off her manager. Overnight, he became charming. Lavish politeness, small acts of generosity, coffee for the team. HR ran a “feedback exercise” a month later. He came out spotless.

Meanwhile, Viya’s access to decision-making started slipping away. Her project proposals stopped reaching the CTO. Calendar invites for strategy meetings never arrived. When she asked, the CTO’s personal assistant smiled apologetically — “Oh, the slots were full,” “He’s too busy this week.” What she didn’t know at first was that her manager had looped the PA in — subtle instructions to “prioritize others.”

It became gatekeeping by design. She’d draft proposals that never reached the room. Meetings were quietly rearranged without her. Even her own updates got “filtered.” She was being erased in plain sight.

When she finally said this isolation was affecting her mental health, HR wrote it down under “sensitivity.” The story was set: *too emotional, too intense, hard to collaborate with.*

She resigned with a single-line email. The team called it “closure.” Her manager smiled for weeks, handing out backslaps and gratitude posts.

Outside, Viya felt the ache of betrayal — and the strange freedom of seeing the game fully for what it was. She began again, consulting with smaller, sharper firms that valued depth over politics. The same industry circles that once heard whispers about her started hearing results instead.

The PA still guards the same calendar. The manager still talks about “team harmony.” The company still looks the same from outside — glass walls shining, all light and no truth.

But if you want to see what **Netflix didn’t show**, we’ve got a **deep dive** for you, full of details, contradictions, and the real story behind the illusion.

 

# The Fake Heiress Who Fooled Manhattan, Synopsis

Anna Sorokin wasn’t rich, noble, or connected, but for four years, she made the world believe she was. Under the name **Anna Delvey**, she tricked New York’s elite into thinking she was a German heiress about to inherit a €60 million trust fund. Dressed in designer brands and living in luxury hotels, Anna created a flawless illusion of wealth that no one dared to question.

Her biggest con revolved around a grand plan, **the Anna Delvey Foundation**, a members-only art and culture club in Manhattan. To fund it, she forged bank documents, created fake email identities, and nearly secured millions in loans from real financial institutions. Her charm, confidence, and access to elite circles made her scams frighteningly effective.

But cracks began to show. Unpaid hotel bills, failed wire transfers, and a disastrous trip to Morocco, where her friend **Rachel Williams** was left with a $62,000 bill, finally exposed her game. By the time police caught her in Malibu in 2017, she’d left behind a trail of unpaid debts and shattered trust.

At her 2019 trial, Anna was found guilty of multiple counts of grand larceny and theft of services. She served nearly two years before being paroled, only to be detained again for overstaying her visa.

And here’s the twist: **everyone made money**.  
Netflix paid Anna $320,000 for her story. Rachel sold her own version to *Vanity Fair*, got a book deal, and an HBO project. The banks recovered their money. The hotels wrote off the losses. And Anna Delvey, still unrepentant, turned her infamy into a brand.

The story is about **how appearances are powerful**. In a world where money buys credibility, Anna proved that if you *look* rich, you can *borrow* trust.  
And maybe, fame is the new fortune.



# DEEP DIVE



# The Fake Heiress Who Fooled Manhattan

Anna Sorokin wasn't rich. She wasn't German nobility. She didn't have a trust fund worth millions.

But for four years, she convinced some of the smartest, richest, most careful people in New York City that she was all three.

Her name was Anna Delvey. And she almost got away with it.

# The Girl Who Became Someone Else

Anna Sorokin was born near Moscow in 1991. Working-class family. Nothing special. When she was 16, they moved to Germany. She worked normal jobs. Lived a normal life. Nobody looked at her twice.

Then in 2013, she moved to New York City.

And Anna Sorokin disappeared. In her place appeared Anna Delvey, wealthy German heiress, daughter of a diplomat, heir to a €60 million fortune that would unlock on her 25th birthday. She wore Miu Miu and Celine. She stayed at luxury hotels. She left $100 tips on coffee. She had an idea for an exclusive members-only club that would make her a visionary.

None of it was real, but all of it worked.

# How to Fake Being Rich

Here's what Anna understood that most people don't: rich people don't get questioned.

You show up wearing the right clothes, staying at the right hotels, knowing the right names, and doors open. Nobody asks for proof. Nobody checks. The appearance of money is enough.

So Anna created the appearance.

She lived at 11 Howard, a boutique hotel in SoHo. She ate at expensive restaurants. She hired a personal trainer. She got $800 hair treatments and $400 eyelash extensions. She carried herself like someone who'd never worried about money in her life.

Because if you look rich, people assume you are rich. And if people assume you're rich, they give you things. Credit. Access. Trust.

It's a loop. And Anna rode it for years.

# The Celebrity Circuit

Anna didn't just hang out with random rich people. She worked her way into actual celebrity circles.

She met Macaulay Culkin multiple times. Home Alone himself sat next to her at a dinner she hosted at Le Coucou, a Michelin-star restaurant. She was comfortable enough around him that friends noticed he seemed like part of her inner circle.

She became friends with Julia Fox, the actress who later dated Kanye West. They met through Instagram, connected on a Clubhouse chat, and Fox stayed loyal even after Anna went to prison, posting supportive messages on social media. Fox said they had ""mutual friends"" and a *""similar sense of humor.""*

She crossed paths with Billy McFarland, the Fyre Festival guy, another famous con artist. She was close with members of his team and even stayed at his expensive vacation home.

She worked as an intern at Purple magazine under editor-in-chief Olivier Zahm. She built a relationship with him that gave her access to the fashion and art world.

Tommy Saleh, a high-profile socialite, met her in 2013 at Le Baron in Paris during Fashion Week. They were regularly seen together. He said, ""She was at all the best parties.""

DJ Elle Dee had a strange encounter with Anna at a party in Montauk in May 2014. Later, when Anna made headlines, the press used photos of them together to show Anna's party lifestyle. Elle's family and friends called constantly, asking if she'd been scammed too.

Michael Xufu Huang, founder of Beijing's M Woods museum and an art collector, became friends with Anna in New York. They went on holiday together. Anna left him to pay the bill. Even after being defrauded, Huang bought a painting of Anna and hung it in his museum.

After she got out of prison, the celebrities kept coming. She threw parties at her apartment while under house arrest that drew socialites like fashion designer Cynthia Rowley and her daughter Kit Keenan, model Teddy Quinlivan, writer Cat Marnell, and even Avenue magazine's former editor-in-chief.

These weren't random people. These were connected, successful, famous individuals. And they all believed her.

 

# The Big Idea

Anna wasn't just living the high life. ***She had a plan. A real one.***

She wanted to create the **Anna Delvey Foundation**. An exclusive cultural space and private club in a historic building on Park Avenue South. Art exhibits, fine dining, and luxury hotel rooms. Think Soho House, but with her name on it.

She hired architects. Graphic designers. Legal advisors. She created an 80-page glossy brochure. She met with Gabriel Calatrava, son of the famous architect. She networked with real estate developers and art collectors.

The business plan wasn't insane. Places like this exist. They make money. If she'd actually been rich, it might have worked.

But she wasn't rich. So she needed to get rich.

**That's where the fraud started.**

# The Bank Heist That Almost Worked

In November 2016, Anna walked into City National Bank and applied for a $22 million loan.

She showed them fake Swiss bank statements. Forged wire transfer confirmations. Made-up emails from a fictional business manager named Peter Hennecke. She'd googled *""create fake untraceable email""* and *""non-existent email that is not going to bounce back.""* Then she built her lies carefully, piece by piece.

The bank got suspicious. They wanted to verify her Swiss accounts. She refused and changed tactics.

Instead of $22 million, she asked for a temporary $100,000 overdraft. Just to tide her over while her *""real money""* transferred. The bank said yes.

She was supposed to pay it back immediately. She didn't. *She spent $40,000 on designer clothes, luxury hotels, and beauty treatments.* The rest went to fund her lifestyle while she kept looking for bigger money.

She tried the same thing with Fortress Investment Group, a major private equity firm. She applied for a *$25 million loan*. Submitted fake documents. Sweet-talked the due diligence officer, who sent her *158 text messages, some of them flirty, most of them unprofessional*.

When Fortress wanted to fly to Switzerland to verify her accounts in person, Anna panicked. She withdrew her application. Took the remaining $55,000 they'd given her for legal fees and vanished.

That's the pattern. *Get close. Get money. Disappear before anyone checks the details*.

# Living the Lie

While she was chasing millions, Anna was burning through thousands.

Hotels were her weakness. She'd stay for weeks, run up massive bills, promise payment was coming, then check out when they finally got aggressive. The Beekman Hotel. The W Downtown. 11 Howard. She left unpaid tabs everywhere.

She also had friends. *Rich, successful people who thought she was one of them*. They invited her to parties. Introduced her to contacts. Trusted her.

**And she used them.**

# The Morocco Trip

May 2017. Anna invited three friends on an all-expenses-paid trip to La Mamounia, one of the most expensive hotels in Morocco. $7,000 per night. Private villa. Butler service. Tennis lessons.

One of those friends was Rachel Williams, a photo editor at Vanity Fair.

When the hotel demanded payment, Anna's credit cards mysteriously stopped working. Technical issues, she said. She asked Rachel to put it on her personal card temporarily. Just until Anna's bank sorted things out.

Rachel agreed. What else could she do? They were in Morocco. The hotel needed payment. Anna was her friend.

The bill came to $62,000.

**Anna never paid her back.**

For six months, Rachel begged for the money. Anna made excuses. Lawyers. Bankers. Complications with her trust fund. She always had a reason, never the money.

Rachel had panic attacks. American Express called her constantly. She couldn't sleep. The debt was crushing her.

Anna sent her $5,000 once. Just enough to keep Rachel hoping. Just enough to delay the inevitable.

# The Cheetos Tin

By July 2017, everything was falling apart.

Hotels were evicting her. Banks were closing her accounts. Friends stopped returning her calls. She was literally homeless, sleeping on couches, crying to anyone who'd listen.

She chartered a $35,000 private jet to Warren Buffett's conference in Omaha. Paid with a fake wire transfer. Flew there and back. Never paid.

She deposited bad checks into bank accounts, withdrew cash before they bounced, and disappeared.

She was running out of moves.

In October 2017, police found her at a luxury rehab facility in Malibu. They arrested her and brought her back to New York.

When they searched her house, they found the evidence. Fake documents. Forged emails. Multiple phones. And in the bathroom, hidden under blankets in a closet, they found a Cheetos popcorn tin.

Inside was a single-board computer containing access to cryptocurrency worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.

**It wasn't $60 million. But it was something**. Hidden in a snack food container like a teenager hiding weed from their parents.

# The Trial

Anna went to trial in March 2019. It lasted 22 days.

She didn't act like a defendant. She acted like a celebrity.

She refused to wear jail-issued clothes to court. She hired a stylist to bring her designer outfits. Michael Kors. Saint Laurent. Victoria Beckham. She treated the trial like a fashion show.

Her lawyer, Todd Spodek, had an interesting defence. He argued that Anna wasn't really a criminal. ***She was an entrepreneur with a legitimate business idea who used unconventional methods to access capital.*** The banks failed to do proper due diligence. The hotels extended credit without verification. Everyone was sloppy. ***Anna just exploited the system.***

He had a point. But it didn't matter.

The jury found her guilty on 8 of 10 counts. Grand larceny. Attempted grand larceny. Theft of services.

She was acquitted on two counts, including the Morocco trip. The jury didn't believe Rachel's story held up under scrutiny.

The judge sentenced her to 4 to 12 years in prison. Plus $24,000 in fines. Plus $199,000 in restitution to the banks and hotels, and everyone else she'd screwed over.

Anna showed no remorse. ***""I'd be lying if I said I was sorry for anything,""*** she said later.

# The Ending

Anna served for about two years. Got out on parole in February 2021.

Six weeks later, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested her. She'd overstayed her visa. She spent another 19 months in detention.

In October 2022, she was released on house arrest. Ankle monitor. Social media restrictions. Confined to her apartment while fighting deportation.

**But here's the twist: she's not broke.**

While in prison, **Anna sold her story to Netflix for $320,000.** The show ***""Inventing Anna"" came out in 2022.*** It was a massive hit.

*Rachel Williams, the woman Anna left with a $62,000 bill, also sold her story.* She wrote a Vanity Fair article. *Got a book deal for over $300,000. HBO bought the rights.* Lena Dunham was set to direct.

**The victims became rich. The criminal became rich. Everyone made money except the hotels and banks, who probably wrote it off as a tax loss.**

**Anna appeared on Dancing with the Stars.** **Walked the runway at New York Fashion Week. Built a social media following.** She's still fighting deportation, still under house arrest, still Anna Delvey.

# What It All Means

Anna's story isn't about a brilliant criminal. She wasn't that smart. Her fake documents were sloppy. Her lies were obvious if anyone had checked.

**It's about a system that doesn't check.**

Rich people don't get questioned. They get the benefit of the doubt. They get credit and access and trust because looking rich is, in many ways, the same as being rich.

Anna understood that. And she played it perfectly until she couldn't anymore.

The sad part? She almost made it. If she'd been just a little more careful, a little less greedy, a little better at covering her tracks, she might still be living the dream.

Instead, she's famous. Which, in 2024, might be better than being rich anyway.

The blockchain doesn't forget. But in Anna's case, neither does Netflix.

And that might be the biggest con of all.

# What Netflix Didn't Tell You

**""Inventing Anna""** was a hit. Millions of people watched it. Julia Garner won an Emmy playing Anna. The show was dramatic, entertaining, and well-made.

It was **also bullshit** in several important ways.

# The Rachel Williams Problem

Netflix made Rachel Williams look like a naive victim who got blindsided. Sweet photo editor, manipulated by a con artist, left holding a massive bill she couldn't pay.

*Reality was messier.*

Rachel wasn't some innocent bystander. *She was a Vanity Fair editor who knew exactly what kind of lifestyle Anna was living.* *She watched Anna spend money for months.* Saw the designer clothes, the expensive dinners, the luxury hotels. She never asked where the money came from.

When Anna invited her to Morocco, Rachel knew it was extravagant. A $7,000-per-night hotel. A private villa. She could have said no. She could have insisted on paying her own way. She didn't.

And when the bill came, Rachel put it on her credit card, knowing Anna's cards weren't working. That's not normal behaviour. Most people would refuse. Would call the hotel manager. Would find another solution.

Rachel made a calculated risk. She bet that Anna was actually rich and would pay her back. She lost that bet.

*Then she monetized the hell out of it.*

The Vanity Fair article. The book deal is worth over $300,000. The HBO deal with Lena Dunham. *Rachel made more money from being Anna's victim than she ever did as a photo editor.*

Netflix downplayed this because it complicates the narrative. *Victims are supposed to be sympathetic.* Rachel was sympathetic, *but she was also opportunistic.* Both things can be true.

The show needed a hero. So they simplified her.

# The Jury Acquitted Her on the Morocco Charge

This is huge. The show makes the Morocco trip seem like Anna's most evil act. The emotional climax. The betrayal that proves she's a monster.

**The actual jury didn't buy it.**

They acquitted Anna of the charge related to Rachel's $62,000 bill. They looked at the evidence and decided Rachel wasn't really a victim of theft. Maybe fraud. Maybe manipulation. But not theft.

Because Rachel voluntarily put the charges on her card. Anna didn't steal the card. Didn't forge Rachel's signature. Rachel handed it over.

*Netflix ignored this completely.* They needed Rachel's story to land emotionally, so they pretended the jury agreed with her version. They didn't.

# Anna Actually Had a Real Business Plan

**The show makes the Anna Delvey Foundation look like pure fantasy.** A fake project Anna invented to scam banks.

*That's not quite right.*

Anna spent real money on the foundation. She hired legitimate architects. Worked with graphic designers. Created detailed plans for a six-story building on Park Avenue South. The 80-page brochure wasn't a cheap Photoshop job. ***It was professional.***

She met with Gabriel Calatrava, a real architect with serious credentials. She networked with Aby Rosen, a major real estate developer and art collector. These people took meetings with her because the project seemed viable.

Soho House exists. The Ned exists. Exclusive members-only clubs combining art, dining, and luxury accommodations are a proven business model. **Anna's version wasn't crazy.**

**The problem wasn't the idea. It was the funding.**

She couldn't get legitimate investors because she had no track record, no collateral, no real credentials. So she faked them. She created a false identity to access capital she couldn't get otherwise.

Her lawyer, Todd Spodek, made this argument at trial. He said the real crime wasn't fraud, it was pretending to be rich to bypass gatekeeping mechanisms that privilege inherited wealth over merit.

Is that criminal? Or is it just how ambitious people without connections have to operate?

Netflix didn't explore this because *it's uncomfortable*. It suggests Anna was less of a sociopath and more of a hustler trying to game a rigged system. That's a different story. Less clear-cut. Harder to moralize about.

# The Banks Were Criminally Incompetent

City National Bank gave Anna a $100,000 overdraft based on emails from ""Peter Hennecke"" sent from an AOL address.

*Read that again. AOL. In 2017.*

They didn't verify his identity. Didn't call the Swiss bank he supposedly represented. Didn't do basic due diligence. They just handed over $100,000 to a 25-year-old woman with no verified income.

Fortress Investment Group was worse. Their due diligence officer, Dennis Onabajo, sent Anna 158 text messages. Many were described in court as *""flirty.""* He was supposed to be investigating her finances. Instead, he was trying to get close to her.

When his bosses finally said they needed to verify her Swiss accounts in person, Anna withdrew her application. That should have been a giant red flag. Fortress should have reported her to the authorities.

They didn't. They just returned her money and moved on.

The private jet company, Blade, accepted a forged wire transfer confirmation and let her fly a $35,000 charter without verifying payment. The hotels let her stay for weeks without proof of funds.

Everyone was sloppy. Everyone violated their own protocols. Anna exploited that, sure. But the institutions made it easy.

Netflix showed some of this, but didn't emphasize it. *They wanted Anna to be the villain.* The truth is, she had a lot of help.

# Anna Wasn't Sorry, and She Still Isn't

The show ends with Anna in prison, presumably reflecting on her mistakes, learning her lesson, paying her debt to society.

**Real Anna never did that.**

In interviews after her release, she was asked if she regretted anything. She said, *""I'd be lying to you and to everyone else and to myself if I said I was sorry for anything.""*

She wasn't performing. She genuinely doesn't think she did anything wrong.

During her trial, she refused to wear jail-issued clothes. Threw tantrums when her designer outfits weren't available. Treated the courtroom like a runway. After conviction, she racked up 13 violations in prison, including fighting and disobeying orders. She spent weeks in solitary confinement.

She's not rehabilitated. She's not reformed. ***She got famous instead.***

She sold her story to Netflix for $320,000. Appeared on Dancing with the Stars wearing an ankle monitor. Walked the runway at New York Fashion Week while under house arrest, fighting deportation.

She built a social media following. Launched a podcast. Sells merchandise. She's a brand now. ""Anna Delvey"" is bigger than Anna Sorokin ever was.

The show made her a tragic figure. Complicated. Misunderstood. A product of a system that values appearance over substance.

# The Victims Aren't Really Victims Anymore

City National Bank got its $100,000 back through restitution. Citibank got its $70,000 back. The hotels got paid. Blade got paid.

Rachel Williams got paid more than anyone. Her book deal, her media appearances, her HBO deal. She's not suffering.

The only real loser is Anna, stuck under house arrest, fighting deportation. But even she's making money off her infamy.

**So who was hurt? Where's the crime?**

This is what makes the story weird. Everyone involved profited. The banks got their money back with interest. The victims became authors and consultants. Anna became a celebrity. Netflix made millions.

1ouxquy,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeLonghi/comments/1ouxquy/bringing_a_machine_back_from_the_dead/,Bringing a Machine back from the dead,"All, I received a DeLonghi Dinamica Plus (2-year-old machine). Couple issues, and I was wondering if anyone had thoughts. I think the issues stem from people using coffee grounds instead of whole beans, set off a 'General Alarm', and led to a series of unfortunate errors that have brought me to here.

1) the brew drive is misaligned; it looks like it got stuck halfway through a cycle. I tried rebooting to reset it, but its out of alignment and prevents the door from closing and me from putting the water resevoir back in. QUESTION: Is there a way to move it

2) the previous users of the machine look like they 'aggressively' tried to fix problem #1. There is a small lever (marked on the plastic as C11) that is proken. I found it in the grounds container. Its supposed to be attached to a spring, and best I can tell it controls a switch that tells the machine everything is in place and ready to brew (lever sets right about the grounds container and its base is part of a molded wall next to where the water reservoir goes). QUESTION: Is there a way to bypass the switch that the lever controls?

If the machine is toasted, I'll be disappointed - I was part of the group that bought it originally, and then we passed it along to other people. But, thats life sometimes.

  
Thanks!

I had this circle appear on my butt cheek 7months that was reddish purplish with a red ring around it. Super itchy especially when I sweat and I still have it. My first thought was fungal. Obg agreed and recommended a cream. Then something similar appeared on my tongue. Red patch with no taste buds with a darker red ring that changed in size daily. Sometimes larger sometimes smaller sometimes multiple but in the same general area on the left side of my tongue. It seemed to be triggered by acid or spicy and even toothpaste. 

Doctors kept speculating. Urgent care gave me a fungal pill. Fluconizole higher dosage for 28 days, I kept forgetting to take so I skipped a few days by accident. Another doctor gave me a cream. 
Primary suspected herpes but blood cell count shows that I haven’t even been exposed. 
Dermatologist said geographical tongue and just irritation on the butt (for 7months apparently) 
Ent says too much sugar and acid from coffee. 
Some say stress induced. 
Mind you none of these doctor tested or asked questions at all. 

I’m 28yr old female. Never had this in my life but it appeared in April and hasn’t gone away. Now all of a sudden my three year old has it on her tongue. My thought process is it’s either hereditary,  
contagious or dietary. 

Her pediatrician is suspecting dietary vit b12 deficiency. 

My dermatologist disagreed and said it’s not possible unless we’re vegan. But according to my research it is possible if you have a specific type of anemia (my daughter does have anemia. Not sure what kind exactly). But no one is doing testing they’re all just giving opinions but now that it’s affecting my daughter too I’m even more worried. 
Sugar could be possible. B12 deficiency I guess possible? But I’m wondering if it IS fungal and it was resistant to the treatment? The doctor didn’t want to give me a second dose because it could damage my liver.  So I’m left looking stupid because I’m not taking “it’s nothing” for an answer. I do want to add that around the time of the start of all this my dog got skin lesions allll over her body which I thought was an allergic reaction. So a skin infection I guess. I never took her to the vet because I’m super broke in these times but I got an over the counter shampoo, skin spray and changed her diet. It went away for the most part but there’s always one or two on her body. I have undergone a lot of stress this year cheated on ect. But my toddler shouldn’t be that stressed? And lastly.. I have been experiencing mold in my apartment which I moved into 7 months ago. Black mold appears
On my dishes in 24-48 hours. So I’m wondering if that’s related? ANY advice or thoughts are helpful. Please and thank you for taking the time to read. I have seen a couple people post the same issues on here but never got an update on what it was. ",0,1762928454.0,AskDocs,4,0.5,False
