Retirement Balance: I don’t know specifics to be honest, but I contribute to a Diocesan 403b at my current job (I think about $7k in there, at 5%) and contributed to a Roth 403b through Equitable at my last job, which I’m having some issues with. For all my jobs I also have a pension- state for my last 2, Diocesan for my current one. I also have $11.5k in a Roth IRA.

Brokerage account balance: $62,237, through Vanguard 

Equity: none

Savings account balance: $28k in an ally HYSA, like $800 in a Wells Fargo account.

Checking account balance: $3.7k

Credit card debt: none, paid off every month

Student loan debt: I just paid off my parent plus loan from undergrad!! I took a Hebrew Free Loan in grad school which my parents paid off.



Income

**Income Progression:** I went to grad school immediately out of undergrad and immediately started teaching after that. I did one year in a relatively well paid district, making $65k as a first year teacher. I then did 2 years in a criminally underpaid district where I did summer school to make up the difference, and never made as much as I did in my first district without summer school- I think I started att $56k. , In 2022 I took this job at a large private catholic high school in my city, with a starting salary of $75k. I cried a LOT, and it was hard for me to leave my last job, but it was a $20k difference in pay and I knew that I couldn’t pass it up. If I hadn’t left from such a low paying district, this wouldn’t have been such a big difference. Because we are not unionized, they are trying to still attract talent from the local unionized districts, so we got two pretty generous across the board pay raises the last few years. My pay is based on a salary schedule. I will be paid $95k for next school year.

**Main Job Monthly Take Home:** $5200

**Side Gig Monthly Take Home**: In the past I’ve worked at summer camps and summer school but y’all I am TIRED.

**Any Other Monthly Income Here**: I receive $350 a month from my grandmother’s holocaust reparations payment (she gives it to her kids to give it to her grandkids.) My parents also help out a lot. I don’t talk about it otherwise in the diary so I’ll put it here- my parents paid for the vast majority of my undergrad education, and I didn’t take out any loans for grad school other than a Hebrew free loan because I lived at home and commuted for those 2 years, plus went to a public school tot save on cost. 



**Section Three: Expenses**

Rent: $1265, my half of a 2 bedroom plus parking spot shared with my partner. It think we have such a good deal. We split based on income so he contributes slightly more.

Savings contribution: $1800, saving relatively aggressively right now because of big expenses next year

Investment contribution: not consistent and I am scared af to add more right now because we want to get married next year.

Wifi/Cable/Landline: $35 a month

Cellphone: paid by my family

Subscriptions: $180/yr for Ladder App, $12 a month for Spotify, $4 a month for Rocket Money, $3 I think for Apple storage, $6 for substance. I tried to really clean up my subscriptions this year. I also paid for the Indyx app membership last year but probably will not do it again next year. 

Gym membership: $97/month at a climbing gym

Pet expenses: We foster dogs from the local shelter so they provide everything but we pay pet rent for this most months which I usually cover, $60/a month. When my bf is doing Rover he covers this.

Car payment / insurance: I do not pay for my insurance, but I do pay my car payment. I bought a Subaru Impreza in 2023, and my payment is $300 a month.

Paid hobbies: $250-375 every 6 ish weeks for ceramics classes, inconsistent depending on whether I’m taking classes or doing a membership.

Food: My boyfriend covers our monthly Costco run, I pick up little incidentals as needed like at Trader Joe’s. I also pay for my lunches at work, $100 at a time, which are subsidized by the school, which is part of how we balance it out, since he works from home and honestly eats the majority of our groceries.



Day 1

7:30 I wake up early and can’t get back to sleep so I take the sourdough that’s been fermenting out of the fridge and put it in a dutch oven to rise. I got a starter on my local buy nothing group after being inspired by staying with a friend a couple weeks ago who made sourdough for us.



9:00 Last night my boyfriend suggested we get bagels in the morning, and there’s one local bagel place we haven’t tried yet, so we drive to another city, about a 10 minute drive this morning with no traffic. I get one with citrus, and he gets a lox bagel. The bagels are excellent! He pays. On the way back to our city we run into the Kaiser pharmacy so he can get allergy medication. We’re trying to boycott target and go to the Kaiser pharmacy instead for over the counter medication. 



10:30 My boyfriend and I have an appointment with the jeweler making my engagement ring at 11, so we drive over to the area where the jeweler is and I get my eyebrows threaded beforehand at a shop next door. $18 Parking is making me nervous because I see some ticket enforcers but the card readers on the machines aren’t working, so I pay $4.75 through the park mobile app for parking. We didn’t  end up getting a ticket.



11:00 I pick out my center stone! Our jeweler is amazing and so nice but the lack of sleep is catching up with me a little and I haven’t had any caffeine yet. We set a budget together but it’s insane to think about how much money it will be (and even  more for the wedding tbh- we have big families.)



11:30 We stop by a tea shop to get matcha for me and black tea for my bf ($12.) When we’re there there’s a pastry pop up and someone asks my bf if he’s in line and he automatically says yes. We pick up two pastries; he pays.



12:00 Come home, bake bread, am delusional about me getting to the gym before my plans tonight. I make avocado toast with eggs using my fresh baked bread and then fall asleep for like 2 hours. I also get charged for the one substack I pay for. ($6). 



5:00 I’m going to my friend’s birthday in SF tonight so I decide to walk to BART since I did not go the gym, about a 25 minute walk. I add $10 to the Clipper card on my phone on the way over. It’s a short BART ride plus muni metro to Spark Social.



7:00 I pay for poke and two glasses of wine at spark social ($39.10) and chat with my bestie, the birthday girl, and a couple other friends. 



9:00 bestie lives close to me and parked at BART, so we take transit home together and she drives us home.



I also got charged for my gym this day.



Daily total: $92.40



Day 2

11:00 Laze around at home before I drive to my parents. I haven’t seen them in almost a month because I’ve been sick on and off for all of February, culminating in a really nasty flu.



3:30 My mom and I go see my grandparents who try to unload so much food on us. I acquiesce and take some potatoes, triscuits, and white sugar stored in an old garlic powder container. My mom also gives me some cultural food I haven’t had in forever.



7:30 Once I’m home I stop by the ceramics studio to do some quick glazing and trimming of what I made on Friday night. Classes haven’t started back up yet so it’s really empty. 



Day 2: $0



Day 3

7:50 off to work. My bf makes me coffee, and I pack a yogurt with me that I completely forget to eat and have to throw away at the end of the day. I teach all morning.



11:30 I buy lunch at the school cafeteria- $6 for the salad bar (our lunches are subsidized) but I pay for them $100 at a time. I eat lunch with my crew of young and young at heart science teachers.



2:00 I leave work early for the orthodontist- I’m on my last Invisalign tray! I paid in full for treatment a couple years ago and had a relatively complicated case, so it’s taken a while. He tells me that while I paid for one retainer already, he recommends buying a back up next month for $400. I tell him I’ll make a call at the next appointment. My bf had Invisalign too so I’ll ask his input.



4:30 I make dinner (zucchini pasta with chickpeas) and fall asleep after. I love eating absurdly early. BF has been dog sitting through rover while he works from home so I hang out with the dog a little and we scheme how to convince the owner to spay her.



5:30 My friend from my former dance group is teaching a class at the end of the month so I sign up for her class ($25) and text her a little. I’m trying to get her to climb, I feel like she’d really like it.



7:30 BF drives us both to the gym. I do my workout from Ladder and then decide I want to climb with him, which I haven’t done in forever- my harness is very old and too small on me, so I need to borrow one from the gym. It low key feels kind of dangerous and very uncomfortable to climb in a mens harness, so after we climb for a little I tell him that I want to buy my own harness this month. 



10:00 I’m trying to figure out snacks for after the gym and get inspired by an IG reel to make little yogurt blobs with strawberry and honey. I’ll put chocolate on them tomorrow. 



Daily total: $25



Day 4

8:00 Back to work. I make sure to eat my yogurt before leaving this time. Our schedule is weird today, which I hadn’t realized, and I’m feeling kind of headachey and crabby from the new retainer, and stressed about finishing material. Immediately crabby because I go to print copies and the copier is on the fritz. My first class is good kids and when I’m in a good mood they’re great but today they are such a handful and NEVER STOP TALKING. 



12:00 salad bar again, but this time the parents and guardians committee has king cake for the staff for Mardi Gras! I take a piece of cake but do not take Mardi Gras beads. I can tell I’m tired and need to conserve energy so I just scroll at lunch. I am avoiding grading lab reports. I text bestie about organizing and end up finding a shoe cabinet I like on marketplace. My boyfriend is working late today so I ask her if she wants to come with me to pick it up and she says yes! We’ll go late tonight. 



3:25 My afternoon classes are smoother (as they usually are.) I stay for a bit of office hours and leave to pick up my dry cleaning.

$34 to repair a coat and pillow and clean two sweaters. 



4:30 early dinner of the zucchini pasta and finishing making yogurt blobs.



5:30 I do a quick work out at home from Ladder, change, and go to Torah study. 



8:30 pick up the bestie to drive to SF and pick up the shoe cabinet. It was listed for $60 but the seller takes $50. I tell bf and he Zelles me $25. Once I’m home we rearrange the house a little- the old open spaces shoe rack we had will now house my pottery in the hallway. While we’re out I tell her that one of our mutual acquaintances won an appetizer party for 100 people (not a joke, this actually happened) so we RSVP on Partiful and plan to go. For the bit. 



10:30 tired! I shower and go to bed. 



Daily total: $59



Day 5



8:00 out the door. I ate a lot last night, so I’m not hungry today. Bf makes me coffee, I grab an Rx bar, and wear a sweater I bought while visiting my friend in another state last month. I’m technically on a 75 day clothing no buy, but I added 2 days additional after breaking it a couple weeks ago.



12:00 Ash Wednesday all school mass at work. I get my lunch right after ($6 again I think), and chat with the teacher who teaches my class and realize I f forgot to do some paperwork to get paid for some additional curriculum development work we’re doing.



1:45 while planning my class, I find a lab I like on teachers pay teachers and buy it. I almost immediately realize I can’t use until next week at minimum and I still don’t know what I’m doing Friday but that’s starting to feel like a tomorrow problem. $5



2:30 coffee and a dog walk with my rabbi to go over a recent life/friendship crisis. The org the rabbi pays for covers it. We talk about life etc, and I ask them to consider officiating my wedding (whenever it happens in the next year or two) and they say that they’d love to 😭



3:45 I grab wine from Trader Joe’s on my way home for a book club tonight. ($8.92) Bf texts me that he made dinner (sushi bake with some canned tuna and salmon we had in the freezer- we’re running low on fresh food.) I’ll probably do one of my insane early dinners since I didn’t really have breakfast again. 



4:30 insane early dinner and a power nap. Afterwards BF tells me that our anniversary is next week (I, a raging bitch, forgot) and if I want to celebrate early this year. We book a reservation for lunch at a Vietnamese restaurant in San Francisco for the upcoming weekend. 



6:00 time for book club. I drive over and we meet at someone’s luxury apartment building the next town over. We read lessons in chemistry so it’s a pretty intense conversation. Afterwards a few of us stick around to go to the hot tub in the building and chat; I stay until ten and I am fully relaxed afterward, it’s so nice. 



Daily total: $13.92



Day 6



8:00 I don’t teach the first period of the day but I wanted to have a quick meeting with my co teacher, so we talk for about 15 minutes and I use my planning period to figure out what I’m doing on Friday and Monday.



10:45 I am regretting being so busy this week and not sleeping enough because I am DRAGGING.



12:15 We have a great assembly for black history month. I get my usual salad plus chips and then go over to the other building to eat lunch with my coworkers. We laugh about our department chair, who’s generally very uptight but sometimes has these hilarious bits where he dresses up as different scientists.



3:45 I leave work a little late after spending some time getting ready for tomorrow and Monday. Tomorrow will still be kind of a freestyle, but after six years in this job I can definitely handle it better and with more confidence than I could a few years ago. Plus I know that I need to grade those lab reports I’ve been avoiding tomorrow afternoon, so I’m ing to finish up other, easier work in the meantime.trying to get busy work out of the way. I really need to convince a kid to TA for me next year to make my copies and help set up labs. 



4:10 as soon as I leave I realize I need gas and I decide to drop by the station closest to home, which isn’t too expensive. It’s still a ton so I get a little over half a tank. I’ll try to go to Costco next week. $45.19



6:00 ceramics class which ends up being great today- I underglaze the bowl I trimmed earlier in the week, but I think I’ll add some details to it later too. I also make Shabbat candle holders off the hump. I came in tired but I always am so glad I have this class. I invite one of the girls who I’ve had class with for forever to my birthday next month. She’s making tons of ring dishes for her wedding next year. 



Ceramics class is $375 for a 6 week session, but my studio is tiny and homey and does open hours whenever classes aren’t happening, which is a lot more flexible than most studios in the area. I’ve done membership before which is cheaper, but when I have a dedicated class time I definitely make more. I’ll be pausing on and off over the rest of the spring and summer once this class series ends because of travel anyway. It’s an expensive hobby but it’s done wonders for me to feel like an artist again. 



9:00 now that I’m home for more than two seconds, I put away my clothes that have been sitting on a chair in my bedroom all week, shower, and pick out clothes for tomorrow. I decide I’ll go to the gym tomorrow after work, so I’ll pack a bag for that to keep in my car. BF is playing video games when I get home, and put a plant on our new shoe cabinet.



10:45 we watch dog grooming videos in bed before finally going to sleep early. 



Daily total: $45.19



Day 7



8:30 Get all the way to work and realize I forgot my Apple Watch :( I’ll stop by home before the gym this afternoon I guess. It’ll be good for me to drop my work bag at home anyway.



4:30 we had a late staff meeting after work and I come home, planning to lay down for 15 minutes, and fall asleep for an hour. Guess I’m not going to the gym today. I’ll go tomorrow morning. 



7:30 i head to a Shabbat dinner, and right beforehand run into a secondhand clothing store because I really need one more pair of leggings. I find a black camo Sweaty Betty pair, and with my selling credit from a couple months ago it comes to $8.55. 



10:00 Home from Shabbat dinner- I had such a nice time! They started singing niggunim but I was tired. Boyfriend texted me that he went out with a few friends so I’m blissfully alone for a little. I feed my sourdough starter before bed, and set up my outfit to go to the gym tomorrow so that I can go relatively early. Time to scroll and call it a night. 



Daily total: $8.55

Clothes + Beauty: $26.55

Transport: $49.94

Reflections: When my boyfriend and I started talking more seriously about getting married next year I started saving more seriously. I had a rash of really intense spending at the end of the year, mostly on clothes, and I think triggered by election stress. We decided at the beginning of this year that we didn’t want to contribute to Trump’s economy. We’ll still buy from local businesses, but we cut out our shopping from Amazon/Whole Foods and target as much as possible. We are an interfaith interracial couple with lots of queer friends and we just wanted our spending to realign with what we find important. Cutting out clothes spending made it shockingly easy to save. I started regular spending $80-120 on one piece of clothing, and while I love clothes, I needed a break.

1j87vr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sims4/comments/1j87vr7/bh_bakery_business_results/,B&H: Bakery Business Results,"So my main goal was to build a working bakery with the new B&H EP. I set it up to run as a residence + business on the same lot. The business was on the ground floor and the residence was upstairs (used tallest setting for walls on the ground floor).

**VERY POSITIVE results for the most part.**

Most of the profits came from services and tips. With 2 employees it was profitable, but with 3 employees it ended up being a break even. That is fine for me because I was not concerned about the profitability of the business in this build (household is flush with cash).

But there were a number of glitches and quirks that I wanted to share and some of these issues can affect a lot of different businesses.

**#1 The bug with sims paying for one food serving but getting the entire dish:**

This bug is the most serious issue and basically makes most of the bakery non-profitable. You have to supplement the baked goods with other services. This happens with all dishes, but especially troublesome for:

* Pizza: buy a slice and get the whole box instead
* Family Sized Candy: buy 1 get 3 free
* Bread: by a loaf for the price of a slice

Basically this bug affects every single food item that is prepared other than purchased from a Bar or Coffee Bar (those count as services, not sold goods anyways).

The only way to override this issue is to split up dishes into separate plates but that requires a lot of sim game time and is ultimately not worth it. There is an Official bug report for this issue, and is marked as Under Investigation, so hopefully it is something that is fixed shortly:

[https://forums.ea.com/idea/the-sims-4-bug-reports-en/bh-sims-pay-for-one-food-serving-instead-of-full-price/11968004](https://forums.ea.com/idea/the-sims-4-bug-reports-en/bh-sims-pay-for-one-food-serving-instead-of-full-price/11968004)

**#2 Pathing issues when more than one object qualifies:** 

The biggest annoyance with this is multiple refrigerators. When I instruct my owner sim to bake something in the oven, often the sim will walk upstairs to the fridge there instead of the fridge that is 2 squares away from the oven. I even have 2 fridges in the business area to avoid issues with multiple sims accessing the fridge at the same time, and yet my sim seems to prefer walking all the way to the residential one instead. If I kick on the fridge and pick the bake option, the same issue occurs when going to the oven.

The only good solution is to use the cupcake machine instead of ovens but this cuts down on the number of recipes. The not so good solution for this is removing the kitchen in the residential area. 

This is similar to the Bathroom / Kitchen sink issue and they ended up fixing it by putting in tags for the sinks to define roles. I have no idea why the closest available object can't be used instead.

**#3 Annoying Autonomous actions:** 

This is not necessarily a bug...

I gave one employee the task to bake. Sounds good right? Well the only thing they would make is the White Cake (which is cooking not baking). I ended up removing the Baking task and kept her to just running the coffee bar, clean and be friendly. And yet... she still keeps making those cakes with no way to cancel (can cleanup a partly made cake or continue making it).

I have another employee who is hired ONLY as a live musician and he is fascinated with making shock jellybeans from the candy machine.

The third employee really likes to bake Cheese Pizza (again not tasked).

**#4 Rarely customers ignoring Employees Only area:** 

I had to redesign the kitchen area because I kept losing the Employees Only section when I had a platform that was the same height as the main floor (it kept blending it with main floor and making everything public). So the redesign requires a step up into the kitchen area and was not nearly as visually appealing, but it is what I had to go with.

Then I positioned the Bakery display cases so that they were right in front of the employee only area, but sitting on the public area.

For whatever reason, a few customers wanted to access the back of the bakery case to make their purchase, and of course that required them to walk into the employee only section. This continued to happen even after fixing the kitchen area so it was on its own platform.

I think I also had one customer go and wash his own dishes in the sink, but I don't remember if that was when the employee only area was glitched or not.

**Conclusion:** 

While profits were not a concern this game play I defiantly do not want to do this on a fresh save until the bug is fixed... but overall it was a a good experience.

There are a lot of little quirks with B&H that are different than I expected, but that is part of the game to learn the rules and see how to make the most of the limitations. One important aspect is that getting a high rated business is a lot of work, and that makes it feel more like a real custom career. 

Even though I am a bit annoyed with employees doing things outside of their job roles that I cannot cancel, that is actually more like life and so I have to deal with it like any other event.

I (24 M) have a long history of anxiety and OCD since 19 that’s caused a whole plethora of symptoms over the years. Ive started getting panic attacks in September that have come and gone intermittently. Been to the ER this year and last too many times to count

Was in the ER last week for shortness of breath. Got an EKG and blood test. Overall healthy with the exception of discovering I’m pre-diabetic. My fasting glucose has sat at 105 for the last three months and I have a high blood pressure, with my resting sitting at 140/100. When I get anxious, that can jump up to 170/120 I’ve noticed I’ve started twitching a lot since the visit. It’s not centered around one area. It’s like my body just randomly jolts a little bit.

Didn’t care too much till I wasn’t able to get to bed till 4 AM last night due to my body being way too active and unable to stay still. Is this normal? I did have a coffee at 6 PM so I maybe shot myself in the foot. From my understanding, being pre-diabetic doesn’t do anything with the exception of some skin changes for certain people.

1j87jv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/1j87jv4/pubq_throwing_in_the_towel_failed_at_querying/,"[PubQ] Throwing In the Towel: Failed at Querying, Stats and Reflection","So I worked on a literary novel for about two years. This was the third I've completed in my life--god knows how many I've started and abandoned--but this was the first one where I thought it was publication ready, where I had done the work necessary to make it successful. I had two people who were avid readers beta read my book and had other friends who had published novels of their own or went to grad school with me look over the opening 20-50 pages based on what they could handle. I revised based on their feedback. I read a lot books, analyzing how those authors wrote their scenes. I watched a lot of videos on structure and watched quite a few movies too to help me organize my plot. I took a class on novel writing in the summer and worked on my query from about June of last year until I started sending out the book in October and posted my query [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/1g5wihg/qcrit_the_white_rabbit_literary_fiction_72k/) [times](https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/1go5zmn/qcrit_query_first_300_words_for_the_white_rabbit/) on PubTips. I had a lot of positive feedback on my queries here, and I felt really confident going out with my book. I thought for sure I would do well and land an agent. I got a subscription to Publisher's Marketplace, was satisfied with my materials, loved what I had written after my revisions, and made a list of agents who represented contemporary authors I really liked and started sending out my manuscript. 

Then something REALLY interesting happened. During the querying process for a book about a terrorist killing CEOs in the street, a terrorist killed a CEO in the street--and the public loved it. I was sure that would take me over the top.

Well, it's been six months, and I'm calling it. The book's dead. I don't think I have what it takes to be successful in the market at present--at least not at a Big Five publisher or even a smaller press that requires an agent, like Coffee House or Tin House. 

Here's the stats:

Queries sent: 227ish

Rejections: 106

CNRs: 66

Partial Requests: 3

Rejections on Partials: 2

Full Requests: 3

Rejections on Fulls: 0 (so far)

Offers: 0

As you can see, things didn't go according to plan. I found myself spiraling pretty quickly, sending off queries to anyone and everyone, going through QueryTracker, ManuscriptWishlist, and Publisher's Marketplace to find agents who might seem remotely interested in my book. (Though I will say that 5 out of 6 of my requests from agents I never even heard of, so I think there is something to be said about querying widely--but it should probably be within in reason to some degree.) I booked two meetings with agents on Manuscript Academy to go over my query and first ten pages--because I love throwing away money--and both said the query was good and that the pages were working. I just needed to find the right agent. So I kept going and sending out queries. It was a lot of work for nothing. And again, because I love spending money, I also hired an agent who moonlights as an editor to look over my first two chapters. It really felt like a waste of money as he didn't provide a great deal of feedback. And some of the advice was solid, but it really wasn't worth the price.

Reflections:

1. I feel like literary fiction is already a hard sell. It often feels like you've already needed to be successful to be successful. I have an MFA from a program most people have never heard of--but we do spend a lot of money at AWP every year--and my short fiction publications are from ten years ago when I was young and dumb and full of hope. Over the last ten years or so, I let most of my connections to publishing world wither on the vine as I tried to make a career and make some money to support my family. I gave up in the past when I was just starting to build momentum because I kept getting good rejections from the top tier literary magazines. (I know how absurd that sounds, but at the time, it was very demoralizing.) It seems like you need to get lucky whether that's going to Iowa or breaking through in the big journals or winning an award if you want people to notice you.

2. Good books don't make it too. I really believe that the book I wrote is a good one. That may seem arrogant, but I've been doing this for a long time. I remember, years ago, I was a reader for a first novel in progress contest. The submissions came in blind with only the writing to sell it. Most were junk--and then I got a submission that blew me away. I was absolutely floored from the first sentence. The novel didn't win the prize, but it did get runner-up. It would later go on to be published as the Sympathizer and win the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. While I don't think I'll win any awards or make any impact with this book, my point is that I think I have a discerning eye and know when something's good. If my book is dead, I don't think it's because the book was no good. It just didn't find the right agent--if they're even out there.

3. I never expected great success and never wanted to be a commercial writer. I like books that most people think are boring or difficult or bizarre. All I really want is to be read by people who want what I want in a book. I thought that because I wrote something more high concept and was good at what I do, it might be attractive to an agent, but clearly that's not the case. If I can get picked up by a small press that will love my work, that's really all I can ask for--though even that seems exceedingly difficult in today's market.

4. I don't really have any advice on how to be successful, because from the looks of it, I won't be. I think there's a lot of querying posts here that make it seem like so many writers send out 18 queries and get 54 full requests and 106 offers, but I think that's far from the norm. In many of those cases, we only see the result. There's no sense of the tailwinds at the writer's back. We don't know what that writer's experience has been before that moment or the contacts they have or the little moments of dumb luck that got them over the finish line.    

5. When people say there's only like a handful of good agents or agencies, they aren't kidding. While looking at the Publisher's Marketplace pages for publishers I wanted to work with, like Knopf, Riverhead, Grove, et cetera, it seemed like the same agencies came up again and again: Janklow and Nesbit, Trident, Aevitas, Trellis, Sterling Lord Literistic. And my god, does PJ Mark sell a lot of books!

6. Maybes seem like delayed rejections. I've seen a lot of agents reject everyone around me on the query timeline on QueryTracker. It was a bloodbath except for my single yellow line. But every time I seemed to be in that agent's maybe pile, they all turned into a rejection. I feel like if an agent is interested, they'll just ask for the full manuscript right away if they're on top of their slush pile.

7. Lastly, I know it's not entirely over, and I should be thrilled that I still have some queries and got full requests--one is even at a very big agency. Those could turn out to be in my favor. But it doesn't do me any benefit to keep dwelling on that last book. I've spent too much time over the last six months refreshing my inbox and looking at QueryTracker and reading over rejections, wondering what could have been. It's advice I've heard time and time again. You've seen. I've seen it. But it would probably be in my best interest to actually heed it. Write the next thing. So that's what I'm doing. I'm gonna try it all again with something else--and maybe not send out so many queries and waste so much damn money this time. 

So yeah. There's that. I don't know. What do you think? Are your experiences similar? Do you agree or disagree with any of my reflections? I'm curious to hear your thoughts. ",10,1741636075.0,PubTips,3,0.92,False
1j87jrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1j87jrk/i_dont_know_what_to_think_about_his_52m_behaviour/,I don’t know what to think about his (52M) behaviour towards me (34F). Any advice?,"I'm (34F) not sure what to think. I've been friends with this guy (52M) for at least five years. We met at a work event and usually see each other twice a year because we live in different cities. He's a good guy, smart, charismatic, and respectful. We both work in research at university and are in the same research project. We're both married, so our relationship has always been strictly platonic. We don’t normally text or talk outside of those work-related events; we just catch up when we see each other. He would just send me happy birthday and congratulations when something important happens in my life. That's all.

That said, there’s something that’s been bothering me. For years, every time I post a story on WhatsApp, he’s always the first person to view it—sometimes within seconds. It’s been happening consistently for a long time, and I’ve started to wonder if it’s just a coincidence or something more. Out of curiosity, I started paying attention to when he was online and noticed that he’s often online/offline around the same times I am. One day I decided to post a status while he was online—and again, he viewed it within 2–3 seconds or even less. It was so quick, it almost felt like he was waiting for it. It struck me as odd, and I don’t know if I’m reading too much into it.

He also seems to care a lot about me. He remembered my birthday after I casually mentioned it in a conversation many months ago and even texted me. (I don’t even remember most of my friends' birthdays unless Facebook reminds me!) The way he treats me and looks at me, it’s clear that he cares and thinks highly of me. He congratulates me on life milestones, recalls little things I’ve said many years ago (even though we’re not that close), copies me sometimes, and often tries to find things in common.

The last time I saw him — a little over a month ago — he got super emotional and was even trembling with heart palpitations while sitting next to me at a work event. It felt like he was experiencing massive anxiety, and I could sense his vulnerability. That was the moment I started wondering if maybe he had other intentions with me. That’s also when I began paying closer attention to his behavior — and then came the WhatsApp story views, which made things feel even stranger.

I also remembered another instance: he once left his own work meeting in the middle of the day just because I texted him at the last minute to grab a coffee (since I was visiting his city). At the time, I didn’t think much of it — he’s a friend, after all — but now, all these little things are adding up and making me rethink our entire dynamic.

I really value his friendship and I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but I also don’t know how to approach this.

I (28f) deleted my dating app profiles completely today. I’ve been on the apps for the last five years, across three different states, and gone on dates with guys, girls, and everything in between and outside of that (I’m queer). There have been two people I really thought I connected with, but one ghosted me in a really shitty way, and the other wasn’t looking for anything serious, so I ended it when I started to catch more serious feelings. That was my most recent romantic escapade, which happened at the end of last year.

I am just… discouraged and lonely and I don’t know what to do or how to make myself feel better. I have been putting myself out there for years, both on the apps and just in my activities (going to bars, coffee shops, the gym, etc.), and I just… I want to give up. I want to love and be loved so badly, and I’m unfortunately a hopeless romantic (believe me, I’ve tried to shake that). 

I think I just need kind words, maybe some advice on either how to meet people or how to stop feeling so low… TIA. ",1,1741635936.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

Thought I would share some of my best learnings after a decade in childcare.

# Tech That Actually Helps

* **Use a purchasing platform for making buying supplies easy.** I hated ordering supplies because it meant I had to deal with going on multiple websites, low stock, backorders, and invoices, but using [joinmaia.com](http://joinmaia.com) has been a lifesaver since it has all the supplies from amazon, wal-mart, costco, and everything else in one place, plus its also free.
* **Use ChatGPT to cut your lesson planning time in half.** Instead of spending hours on Pinterest, just type: ""Give me a week of preschool activities on dinosaurs with a letter to send home to parents."" Take what works, tweak what doesn’t, and save yourself some time. Happy to make a more detailed post on how I use chatgpt if you guys want.
* **Use one childcare software, and stick to it.** There are lots of great options out there like [procaresoftware.com](http://procaresoftware.com), [mybrightwheel.com](http://mybrightwheel.com), and [tryplayground.com](http://tryplayground.com); they all have their pros and cons, but whatever you do, decide once and don't keep switching. Parents and staff hate having to switch apps.
* **Dictate notes instead of writing everything by hand.** Use [Otter.ai](http://Otter.ai) or your phone's built in text-to-speech for observations and reports. Way faster than trying to scribble notes during naptime.



# Keeping the Day Running Smoothly

* **Mornings are calmer when you start with quiet play.** I used to jump right into circle time first thing and it was always chaotic. Now we start the day with puzzles, books, or a simple sensory bin. It helps kids settle in, and I actually get to drink my coffee while it’s still warm.
* **Keep a ""just in case box"" at the front desk.** A few extra snacks, a pack of baby wipes, an extra pair of leggings because someone will forget theirs, and some dollar-store gloves for messy situations. Trust me, you will need it.
* **Subs will save your sanity so treat them well.** When you find a good sub, hold on to them for dear life. Pay them quickly, leave clear notes, and always have backup lesson plans they can grab. You will thank yourself later.



# Working with Parents

* **Start every conversation with I know we both want what’s best for the child.** It sets the tone before a tough conversation. Parents are way more open when they feel like you’re on the same team.
* **Canva is your best friend for newsletters and updates.** You don’t need fancy software. Canva has free templates that make cute, easy newsletters, and it’s quicker than typing a long email no one will read.
* **Instead of saying I’ll look into it, say Here’s what I can do today.** This little change makes a huge difference when handling parent concerns. It reassures them, and you don’t end up with five emails following up.



# Hacks for the Classroom

* **Color coding works wonders.** Red bins for art, blue bins for blocks, yellow for books. Kids catch on quickly, and clean-up time stops being a battle.
* **The helper of the day trick.** You’d be amazed how much easier transitions are when a kid gets to be the line leader or snack helper. Kids love a title, and it makes them more cooperative.
* **A visual timer means fewer meltdowns.** Whether it’s a sand timer or an app, giving kids a visual cue before transitioning makes a huge difference. No more but I wasn’t done yet.+
* **A donation box for free classroom materials.** Parents love to help if you just tell them what you need. I keep a list of things like old magazines, fabric scraps, buttons, and cardboard tubes for crafts. It’s amazing what people will give when they know it’ll be used.

I stopped counting the days two weeks after the remnants of our food were taken. Shouts, gunshots, and smoke signals were all wasted as the town never acknowledged them as calls for help. Though Moreau Bay was on the lake's edge, it felt like the other side of the world. Vaughn and I took turns looking for food. We would be lucky to find a goldeneye resting its wings or a trout swimming close enough to take a shot. We were luckier if we hit one. Even when we had food for dinner, it wasn’t enough to extinguish the hunger. 

Our duty to monitor the corpses was abandoned within a couple of days, especially when they started to disappear. When we left the cabin -whether for food or Vaughn's evening walks to the dock for a mailman who never showed-  we felt the beast’s eyes. I caught glimpses of it between the white-capped branches. Sometimes it was a cyclops, with a beady eye made of the background and a face-consuming socket of busted flesh and bone. Other times it was a head full of deep red smirks that sliced the natural face away. It hadn't made contact with us since it was Vaughn’s son at the dock. All it did was watch. We spent time in the cabin speculating on what its plan was. Was it studying human behavior to better replicate? Was it keeping us captive to have fun at our expense? Theory after theory was considered but the circumstances brought us to the edge of madness.

I started to see it in my dreams. I dreamed of Thanksgiving dinners, a math lesson in my third-grade classroom, and a boring day wasted at the DMV.  Beyond the stuffed turkey at the head of the table sat a man with a gun blast instead of a face. At the doorway of my classroom was a disembodied antler and a skeletal hand with shrink-wrapped black skin waving at me. When my number was called at the DMV I walked to the desk to find the boy chanting,

“You’ll be hungry too… You’ll be hungry too…”

Mercifully, I stopped dreaming after a few days. The only other mercy was when I discovered a deck of cards collecting dust behind a copy of The Road on the bookshelf.

The cards were arranged on the kitchen table for our nightly game of War, one of the only games Vaughn remembered. The window spit icy wind on the back of my neck through the crude, barricade lips I nailed to it. The fire gnawed at its wooden food in the fireplace. My winnings laid face up and paled in comparison to Vaughns. His potbelly was deflated. His clavicles gave a pronounced hump to his off-white long john shirt. The tendons in his neck were lift-lines that vanished behind his curtain beard. Still, he smiled through our game. He didn't get to play games with people while alone on the island.

He slapped down a jack of clubs. The club was like a bramble of ripe blackberries. The smell of crackling wood vanished behind the delectable scent of mashed berry as I ground it into a jam before spreading it on a crisp slice of toast.

""Good luck with that one Harry,"" Vaughn said. I was ripped from my day-dream. Only Jemma ever called me Harry, but I started to let it slide.  I played a jack of hearts, though I saw a plump strawberry. I imagined it dipped into a rich, dark chocolate fountain. The plaps of liquid divinity drooled from the tip of the berry and onto the floor before I caught it in my mouth and tasted the wonderful concoction. My stomach growled like a cougar ready to pounce on its meal. Maybe the next strawberry will go nicely with cheese. A sharp cheddar or a-

""War!"" Vaughn exclaimed before his shrunken belly bounced with a chuckle. We put three cards face down. One, two, three, war. My fourth card placed face up was a Queen of Spades. A difficult card to beat, but he does with a king of hearts. The suicide king.

I stared at it. The blade slid so peacefully through the back of his head. The framed moment before his eyes closed to a calm end. The little red heart in the corner of the card gave its final beat. Was that the escape we would get? Was death our only way off of the island? The corpses stalking the woods, the antlers and bony fist, the little boy, the hunger, and Jemma all weighed too much to carry. I broke. The cards sprawled across the table blurred as tears rushed into my eyes. I hammered the table with my fist before I covered my eyes with my palms. My nails clawed at my hairline. I wanted to dig beneath the skin. To find a way to peel my face from my skull so no one saw me break. My leg bounced desperately for relief but it was no use. I felt a warm touch on my shoulder. Vaughn stood with his hand stretched over the table and a look of understanding.

I gathered myself with a sniff and squeezed the tears from my eyes with a squint.

“Fuck.” I muttered before a slight chuckle to wash away the embarrassment and dread, but it stuck. I looked up at Vaughn who gave me a slight nod.

“Guess I win that one.” He said and we both laughed.

*Knock, Knock, Knock.*

The sound sliced through the room before he raked in his earnings.

“Hello there! Anybody round! I was waiting by the dock and nobody seemed to be coming.”

My heart stopped. On the other side of the door was the mailman. I imagined his Rudolph nose signalling us to safety through the door. I stood from my chair and hurried toward the door, but Vaughn caught my arm in a vise grip. I glared down at him before I saw his finger dividing his puckered lips, miming a shush.

“What? It’s the mailman. We’re saved.” I whispered.

“What if it’s not.” He hissed back. I paused. It seemed so obvious. The beast easily could have eaten him and worn his skin before he made it to the cabin. I couldn’t believe I was about to throw the door open for it, blinded by the possibility of rescue.

“Oh well. I s’pose they may be…” The voice faded away, paired with footsteps. I  crept to the door and cracked it open. The mailman stomped through the blustery night and onto the dark north path. I turned to Vaughn.

""What if it is?"" I asked. The mailman was our only chance to get off the island, or it was an obvious trap. With the ever-approaching reality of starvation, I was willing to risk it. Vaughn hesitated before speaking.

“Damn it… Okay.” He stood and rushed to the shotgun and handed it to me.

“Go get him. If that thing doesn’t have him yet. It will soon.” He slid his arms into his coat and stepped into his boots.

“What are you doing?” I asked.

""Someone has to keep his boat floating,"" Vaughn said as he rushed around the room. He grabbed the box of shotgun cartridges sitting on the floor beside the fireplace. His finger swirled in the box before he started patting at his coat.

""Check your pockets,"" he demanded. I did and only found balls of lint. I cracked open the shotgun and inside was a single blue eye staring back at me.

""I've got one,"" I said.

“Make it count.” He said. I swung the door open. The evergreen smell was sharp and the snow fell in fists.

""Vaughn… don't let it get you,"" I said, and we stepped into the snow.

\*\*\*

It was dark on the northern path. The trees formed walls to block the moonlight. Only the stars reflected on the deep snow. I submerged my boots and swung them forward with each step. A crunch of ice or a plop of snow fell from branches. Each time I aimed down the sights and found nothing. There were no more plumes of rotten stench on the trails, the corpses were all gone. Ice and pine were all that my nose found. Hunger seized my stomach in brief cramps. I questioned whether to call out to the mailman but quickly decided against it. The sound of my boots as they crushed the snow was already too loud for my liking. A faint whisper snuck from behind me.

A turned and threatened with the business end of the shotgun. The trees in my sight only swayed in the lake breeze. I knew it was a whisper. It was far too familiar. I was ready to fire but nothing came out of the treeline. I tucked the shotgun beneath my shoulder and continued down the path. The fight against the snow drained me. My stomach snarled and shriveled inside me. Brief cramps turned into long pains. I nearly folded into the snow. I had to stop to catch my breath and only moved once I felt my toes begin to freeze in place. Another whisper.

I turned again with my finger on the trigger, ready to pull. My sights were locked onto the exact branch I thought the whisper came from. I stood there until I felt the white ground slowly wrap its jaws around my ankles.  Snow piled on the back of my neck but I didn't move. I was prepared to be buried alive until I considered I may be mistaken. My hunger and exhaustion could have caused my mind to play a sick joke. The wind could have passed over a twig at the right angle to mimic the whisper. The thoughts were comforting until the branch moved.

I sprinted through the northern path. When I tripped, I swam through the snow until I regained my footing and ran again. The winter air stung my lungs. My legs were depleted of energy but still I churned them through the snow. In my mind, it was right behind me. The panic in my gut told me it could have reached at any moment and sunk its bony fingers into my throat. The further I ran down the path the tighter the tree walls seemed. It felt like I was going to be compacted by the woods until the trees fanned out in an instant and I was in a clearing.

At the center of the circular clearing was the shed. On top of its roof, it wore a plump, white cap, its mouth left wide open with a drool of light running over the ground. In its puddle laid the red, rusted door. It was ripped from its hinges and dented like tin foil. I thought of the boat's corpse and how it sank helplessly at the foot of the dock with damage I had never seen before. A snap sliced through the trees behind me. I tried to turn but my starved body failed me and I collapsed. Though I couldn't see it through the wooded shadows, its eyes were locked on me. I felt it like the prick of a needle. With the woods all around me, my only escape from its eyes was within the walls of the shed. I stumbled to my feet and shuffled backward to the shed without turning my back to the invisible beast.

I retched when I entered the shed. If there were food in my stomach it would have been spit to the dirt. The hunger pains that stabbed at my stomach were overpowered by the dense mass of stench that filled the tiny building. It was so pungent my eyes began to water. I shielded my nose into the crook of my elbow. Though the stench was loud, I heard nothing beyond my own breath. In front of me was a blue curtain, better suited to an emergency room than the shed. I had to know what caused the rotten odor before it sat heavier at the back of my tongue. I pulled the curtain open. My arm dropped from my nose to one side and the shotgun fell to the other.

I didn't look at her for long, but I saw enough. Her right femur poked through her shriveled, soured thigh. Her beautiful ring was limp at the base of her thin finger. Her hands wrapped around a bundle of purple asters in various stages of decay. Her face was spared the brutality of the other corpses. Though the skin was peeled and the maggots wriggled in her eye sockets I knew it was her. My Jemma.

I threw myself to the ground outside the shed. On my knees, I screamed down at the earth. My tears fell to the snow and waited to freeze. I banged my fists into the dirt again and again and again until they throbbed. I wanted to punch a grave into the ground and bury myself alive but my starvation beat my sorrow and I fell into a somber ball. A voice called to me from the trees.

“The dog lied.”

I looked up and saw the mailman stalking at the treeline. I stayed on the ground and watched him. He stood entirely still and without saying a word.

“What?... What do you want!” I yelled. He stayed quiet.

CRACK

His shoulder jutted from his torso and he groaned a guttural, unnatural wail. I didn’t see pain on its face. Its screams were a performance. An unnatural showing to burrow its claws into my psyche.

POP

His arm extended until his palm was the same height as his knee and the beast howled with the voices it collected. A flurry of snapped bones, popped joints, and a choir of screeches shook the woods as the mailman's skeleton grew to lengths his skin was unable to contain.  Flesh fell to the ground in chunks and shreds to show the tar black skin underneath. Its knees folded backwards and its feet curled inward and calcified into hooves.

SNAP.

The mailman's jaw lurched forward and his upper lip came with it. The skin around his unkept beard began to tear. The bridge above his plump rosy nose tore straight across to make room for the pale, skeletal snout. Points grew from his scalp until a full rack of antlers surfaced. It stepped towards me.

I fumbled into the shed and got my grip on the shotgun before I bolted for the treeline. I ran forever through the trees before I found the northern path again. I swayed the gun in all directions behind me in anticipation of the beast barreling through the forest before I realized it was not chasing me. It stayed at the shed. My eyes were saucers. My chest heaved desperately and my fingers constricted the snow waiting for the unbearable panic to subside. I reached into my pocket and pulled out Jemma's last flower. I rubbed over the plastic hump. The stem was squishy, soaked in age. The petals flushed their bright purple specks for a total, deathly brown.

“Make good with the life you have left,"" I muttered the words with a scoff. I can't make good without justice, and my Jemma would get her's. I stood up and left the dead flower in the snowy divot I created before I marched back to the cabin. With the shotgun in hand, I only thought of one thing.

The dog lied.

\*\*\*

The flakes fell harder with each step I took towards the cabin. My feet went blue as the snow poured over the walls of my boots and melted into a puddle. The numb scent of winter was interrupted by a subtle smoke. It was a smoke that filled the gaps in the air between flakes and trees the further I walked. A warm light made the shadow branches whip in the woods. I emerged from the path and into the bright light. The cabin was engulfed in an inferno. A beacon of black smoke stretched into the night sky. Flames crashed through the open windows and through the front door, onto the porch. The fire roared as it destroyed the cabin. A shadowed figure stood in front of the bright flame. In one hand was the gas can left next to the fridge, and in the other was a manilla folder with paper faces sticking out of the sides. He turned to face me.

""Postman's boat was all torn up. Figured this was our last chance… No way the town can ignore this."" Vaughn said.

He stopped for a moment after looking at me. I was coated in hate. I wanted his blood on the snow. I wanted my justice. He spoke again.

“That is you… right, Harry?”

I stomped up to him and smashed the butt of the gun into the bridge of his nose. He fell to the ground. Blood immediately spilled from the gash. He was stunned when he looked up at me. I aimed the shotgun at his chest.

""You lied to me,"" I said. He thought before he hung his head. Blood started to drip from his chin.

“I know this don’t look good… But I was saving her. Saving you-”

“By letting her rot in a fucking shed, you piece of shit! I’ve been sick wondering where she was. Wondering what happened to her. All while sitting at an empty grave. That’s all you left me. An empty fucking-”

“They’re all empty!… Every one of them is empty.” Vaughn snapped back. He sighed before he continued.

“Every time I get a letter from the city I go to the gravesite to dig it up before… it did. I would bring it over here where I… Well, where I make them unrecognizable. So their face can’t be used to lure grieving loved ones into the woods because that’s what that- that monster does!”

“Why not tell me?” I asked.

“I told the city. I wanted her loved ones to have some closure… I knew it couldn’t be enough… It was all I could do.”

The gun felt heavier, but still I aimed for his heart. He continued.

""Whenever I got to the graveyard, I heard it. I counted on it each time… It was my boy's voice telling me 'What kind of sick person digs up a grave.' or 'I hate you, I'm glad I'm not your son anymore'... anything it could say to get in my head. To make me stop.""

A tear slid down his cheek. He brushed it away quickly while clearing his throat. 

“How uhh..” I had to know the answer but the question was stuck in my chest. He answered it anyway.

""I found her at the bottom of the hill with her leg broke real bad…She was gone when I found her…I heard my boy's voice come from the woods around us and it was close, no one else was even in earshot. I just knew I could make it to my boat with her.""

I lowered the gun. Vaughn whipped the blood trail from his nose with the palm of his hand. He put a hand on the ground to give himself leverage to get up, but he stopped. His eyes met something behind me. Something so foul it forced his chest to convulse and his eyes to swell with fear. A gentle hand rested on my right shoulder.

“I missed you so much, Harry.”

I knew it was impossible to hear it but yet it was there. I longed to hear her voice again. It was like the events of the past few weeks hadn’t happened. Like she came home after her hike like all the hikes before. The heat from the cabin became unbearable knowing Jemma was behind me. I started to turn but the illusion cracked when I saw her hand. Her soured skin retreated from the base of her nails. Each knuckle of her fingers were bold humps with splits in the skin showing the white inside, and at the base of her ring finger sat her ring. I wouldn’t dare turn all the way around. The thought of staring at maggots where her eyes once were made my stomach contort. I wanted to live with her voice for a little longer.

""You're doing the right thing,"" Jemma said to me. She gently rubbed her skeletal hand against my shoulder.

“Don’t listen to it Harrison. This is what it wants.” Vaughn pleaded. The flames roared louder behind him. Sweat beaded on my forehead. The final shotgun cartridge sat in the barrel, ready to fire.

“The dog took my bones, Harry. Took them and hid them from you… He left you with only dirt to mourn.” Jemma stated. My anger returned when I pictured the empty dirt beneath her headstone. I took aim again, this time for Vaughn’s head. The trigger felt flimsy against my finger. Justice was a finger press away. Vaughn desperately shook his head as he pleaded with me to put the gun down. Sirens wailed in the distance.

""It's them, Harrison! We can make it out of here, they saw the smoke!"" Vaughn said. I heard a guttural growl from behind me. 

""You must be so hungry, Harry,"" Jemma said. Her words flushed the adrenaline from my body and all of my attention was back on my stomach. I wasn't hungry. I was starving. 

“Put down the dog, then it is just meat… It would cook so well in the fire” It said in Jemma’s voice. It hit me. Vaughn’s wall of faces that dated back to the Moreau cannibal incident. It took our rations from the cabin. It kept us hungry and tried to drive us mad with the corpse stalking us in the woods. It never wanted to kill us. It wanted us to eat each other. It wanted to replicate.

The sirens sounded distant. Vaughn had a look of acceptance. As if he knew they were too late. Vaughn spoke. “I knew who you were when you came here, Harrison. I was so alone after my boy passed. I just wanted to help you… I know what I did seems awful bad. I still want to help. If that means killing me then so be it, I got nothing to live for. Just please aim for my face… I can't let it take me like it took my boy.”

""Harry, please… He took me from you."" Jemma pleaded. She sounded so helpless, my Jemma. I pulled the trigger.

BANG

I couldn't hear the sirens anymore. I couldn't hear the fire or the voices of Vaughn and Jemma. Only a ring consumed my right ear. I ring so shrill I fell onto my hands and knees. The ring rattled my brain into a piercing migraine. I tried to keep the pain at bay with my closed eyes but it didn't help, so I opened them. A few centimeters in front of me was the shotgun lying in the snow. The gunfire smoke coated my open mouth. Beyond it, in the light of the fire was a manilla folder. Its insides of faces were free. They spread over the ground and were scattered to the wind. A firm hand grabbed my arm and yanked me to my feet.

“We need to go!” Vaughn shouted over the scream of my ringing ear. I turned behind me and saw Jemma. Her femur still poked through her thigh, but her shoulder popped unnaturally far out of place. Her arm shot far beyond the limits of her dead skin. The shotgun blast left a hole in its head, but it didn't die. It was turning again. Vaughn yanked me down the south trail towards the dock. I tried to keep up but the hunger made my muscles ache. The migraine made each step a sharp pain, and the ring masked the encouragement he gave me. He kept pulling me forward. When I faltered, he got me back on pace. I felt the beast's eyes on the back of my neck. Vaughn felt it too. His throat strained out a yell inaudible to me. He looked more and more panicked with each step we took. I knew it was getting close. I started to see its antlers out of the corners of my eye. I snapped my head around to see only branches. Vaughn screamed again but I read his lips as ‘help’. I closed my eyes and only ran with Vaughn’s guiding hand. I ran as hard as my emaciated body would carry me, but it had enough. I collapsed and Vaughn’s hand released me.

I opened my eyes and looked around. Vaughn fell a few steps ahead of me, his energy also drained from hunger. I waited for the beast to get us. Death would come with it since its plan failed. I chose to face it with dignity. I found the strength to stand. My knees nearly buckled under my weight. When I stood, I saw beyond Vaughn. I saw the dock. The wooden platform extended into a lake of blinking red, a pattern given to it by the three emergency boats about to make land on the island. I turned and saw inside the treeline, was a pair of antlers poking from the top of a deer skull. It watched me with its hollow, black eyes before turning and retreating into the woods.

\*\*\*

The year after we escaped the island I made a point to keep up with Jemma's garden. I wasn't a natural by any means but I was able to get the purple asters to bloom. Some mornings I would sit on the back porch with a cup of coffee to warm my palms and watch them. I never fully regained my hearing but I imagined the chickadees singing. Sometimes I imagined seeing her on her knees in the garden. I imagined she dug her bare hands into the dirt to give a nest to her next flower. One morning, I sipped the sweetly bitter coffee and peeked through the steam to the forest at the edge of my backyard. Something stood behind a tree trunk. I squinted to get a better look at it. I didn’t have to imagine that morning, it was her. But as she stepped into the morning light, I saw the specks wriggle where her eyes used to be.",1,1741635584.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1j87cac,https://www.reddit.com/r/predental/comments/1j87cac/letters_of_recommendation/,Letters of Recommendation,"Hey! Just wondering how I could go about getting good letters of recommendations for the upcoming cycle, I go to a school with really big classes and unfortunately didn’t get the opportunity to form any close connections with many of my professors throughout my undergrad (MAYBE one could write me a decent letter). There’s just over a month left of school where I could ask for coffee chats or something before applications start in June, but I highly doubt that’ll show much of my character or academic abilities at all, and frankly I’d feel bad asking a prof for their time simply just so they can write me a letter.

I saw alot of schools ask for two letters of rec from “science faculty members” and one from a dentist - I have more faith in some of the dentists I’ve shadowed to write me a more personalized and accurate letter than a prof that may or may not have seen me in office hours a couple of times lol, just wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation before and what they did, or if the letter can be supplemented by a dentist, employer, supervisor, etc instead (ie one letter from a professor and two from dentists).

* Walking improves cardiovascular health, burns calories, and boosts mood.
* [Yoga ](https://worldmagzine.com/lifestyle/5-anti-aging-yoga-poses-for-youthful-skin/)enhances flexibility, reduces stress, and improves overall well-being.
* The choice depends on personal goals — walking for fitness, yoga for relaxation.

Both walking and yoga offer unique health benefits. [Walking](https://worldmagzine.com/india/people-travel-to-ram-temple-by-walking-cycling-and-skating/) is a great cardiovascular exercise that helps maintain a healthy heart, improves endurance, and supports weight management.

Yoga, on the other hand, focuses on flexibility, balance, and mental well-being. It activates the parasympathetic nervous system, reducing stress and promoting relaxation. [Regular practice](https://worldmagzine.com/lifestyle/luke-coutinhos-morning-tip-skip-coffee-and-start-with-water/) can enhance posture, strengthen core muscles, and even aid digestion.

# Walking and Yoga: Choosing the Right One for Your Health Goals

Walking is a simple, low-impact exercise that strengthens the heart and lungs while improving circulation. It’s especially effective for those aiming to increase their daily step count and stay active without intense physical strain. Brisk walking for 30 minutes can burn calories, helping with [weight management](https://worldmagzine.com/lifestyle/the-risks-of-extreme-weight-loss-what-you-need-to-know/).

Yoga, in contrast, offers a full-body workout that emphasizes breath control, mindfulness, and flexibility. It strengthens muscles through body-weight exercises and enhances joint mobility. The deep breathing techniques in yoga help lower cortisol levels, making it ideal for reducing stress and anxiety.



If your goal is to boost heart health and endurance, walking is an excellent choice. It increases [blood flow](https://worldmagzine.com/lifestyle/omega-3-fatty-acids-boosting-heart-and-sexual-health/), reduces the risk of chronic diseases, and provides a steady energy boost throughout the day. Plus, outdoor walking allows for fresh air and vitamin D exposure.

On the other hand, if you seek relaxation and improved flexibility, yoga is the way to go. Regular practice enhances posture, strengthens muscles, and cultivates mental clarity. Yoga also helps in reducing inflammation, benefiting overall health in the long run.

Both walking and yoga have distinct benefits, and the best choice depends on your goals. For [heart health](https://worldmagzine.com/lifestyle/the-heart-healthy-benefits-of-a-pescatarian-diet/) and stamina, go for walking. For stress relief and flexibility, yoga is the answer.

In an interview with the ground force commander of seal team 6 he reported that “idek what we’re doing here, I just saw somebody that looked like an innocent civilian minding his own business and told my boys to open fire” he went on to say “also, you should buy my book, how to tie your shoes like a navy seal” it is reported that all members of seal team 6 that were on the raid will be receiving very lucrative movie contracts, book deals and 
Podcast appearances as well as opening up their own coffee brands. 


Independent news also interviewed the team captain of the green berets team also on the mission but were turned down due to the green berets being “silent professionals” when independent news asked the seal team commander what “being a silent professional” meant he stated “I have no fucking idea, but y’all should subscribe to my podcast where I shill for other toxic veterans”

1j87a9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1j87a9u/achieving_healty_relationship_in_the_forties/,Achieving healty relationship in the forties.,"I (39M) have been limerent since I can remember. The LEs can last months, even years. I suffered/enjoyed them both in solitude and while in a relationship. During my university years I was quite confident that this would change at some point, that everyone had 'crushes' and that they will stop and that I would be able to establish a strong and healty relationship where I would be happy, safe and finally have a family around my 30s.

But during my late 20s and 30s I have never been able to commit -deciding to live in the same place and plan a future together- to anyone. I had two relationships each lasting more than 3 years with women that genuinely loved me, and whom I did my best to love in return, but I felt something was missing. I couldnt love them completely because I never felt that desperate spark. So I thought 'well, maybe if the relationship starts from a crush, everything will be different and I can finally commit to that'.

I was lucky enough that once a LOs love was reciprocated and we started dating, but after a year or so, the results were still the same: I didnt desire to move with her nor continuing. 'Well, maybe this is not related to limerence, and its just that I havent met the apropiate person' I thought.

Now that I am approaching my 40s I realize that the reason that I am unable to stay fully in a relationship is because of a deep fear/excitement of finding a LO at any moment that will bring down my fragile house of cards, that I am terrified of starting a family just to discover that I will have a LE while I have a loving wife and children and that I would be completely unable to manage it.

I discovered the term of limerence, 4 years ago and it changed my life, everything started to make sense, it had a name, other people were in a similar situation, it can be cured. I started therapy out of it. I worked the personal root causes which will probably be similar to some of you: narcissist mother, absent father, permanent messages at home that I am not enough, that I dont deserve and above all that that I am unable to have needs. I lacked the idea of self until my late 20s. As an adult what I identify as 'true love' or at least what triggers automatically -and violently- my limerent neuron, is uncertainty and ambiguity. I get badly attracted to the scenario where I am hyperaware of interactions with a LO to discover if I am desired too. Frequently the rejection ends in devastating episodes. I know that it's not related to a person, its only related to me. I try to work on it but as any addict may relate, its not that simple.

A couple of months ago I started a new LE. The process is well known: It started by the nicest and sweetest smile from the nicest and sweetest coworker. Then it went in a couple of weeks from not knowing her existence to be nervous at home counting the hours to met her in the coffee pause the next day for only maybe 10 or 15 minutes. I am in the absolute need of finding myself identified in her smile, I need to be validated by her. My chest bursts of 'love' every time she talks to me, I feel that my brain is kidnapped and that is absolutely stupid because I already have an unconditional love from a loving girlfriend.

And I am tired of it. I am tired of grieving for an 'impossible crush' that devastates me mentally and physically. I know that what I am grieving for is not for a particular person but for the idea of investing time, and all the love on earth on a fantasy, an imaginary scenario that will finally 'fill all my unmet needs' and from where 'I cant be abandoned anymore'.

I am tired on being unable to give all this love to my girlfriend that explicitly loves me. 

Ironically my girlfriend describes my way to love as affectionate, as sweet. That she feels loved and secure and wants to have kids with me and I feel horrible to admit how void, empty and hoplessless I feel in this relationship -or any other-.

I find difficult to explain the situation to my closest friends. What I get is that 'everyone gets crushes' and 'you need to commit because you are running out of time' and that 'you can't have such emotions over so tiny experiences'. Some of them in their empathetic try to help, say that 'it shall pass'. But nobody seems to understand what I am experiencing.

Currently I am starting to admit that I would never be able to fully commit to someone. That the idea I had about what love was is just the amazing feeling of being in a rollercoaster pursuing it. I am sad of realizing that I am just getting older and still hope to find something that in reality is only hurting me, that I will never be able to be happy with anyone, that I will die alone and to realize that in fact is what I deserve because I am wasting others time and wasting good people way to love.

I tried many times to end LEs and it works... for a while, then the feeling of void and not 'enjoying life enough' arises again (especially in Spring) and I feel that the next LE is around the corner. Its horrible but exciting as hell. I worked on myself. I found the book ""The Limerence Mind"" being my biggest ally, I can identify real needs and non real needs, I did a list of beliefes that need to be changed and addressed. I even changed my life after reading it twice. I am happy with my work, I am happy with my hobbies and I enjoy great friendships but still feel somehow romantically mutilated. Even if I am no longer attracted to a specific pattern anymore (after a long road of work), the idea of ""the need to be attracted again"" is always present in my mind, like 'who knows, maybe the next Lo is the good one'.

My question here is to limerent people in your 40s (or above). 

How did you overcome the idea of enjoying life without that big spark? 

Did anyone manage to build a healty relationship and being able to give love to people that loves you?

I love sites like HowLongToBeat.com but was always shocked that there wasn't a similar site for game difficulties, so I decided to create one :D

[How Difficult Is It?](https://howdifficultisit.com/)

There aren't a ton of ratings at the moment: a very small number from testing, and a handful from some of my close friends that have added some. The website will thrive the more game difficulty ratings are added, so if the site is interesting to you, please add some ratings yourself!

It also has a [TOP 100](https://howdifficultisit.com/rankings) rankings page to find the most difficult and easiest games, with custom filters for release year, genre, platform, and keywords.  Let me know if there are any bugs/issues, or features you'd like to see!

**Note, the site is completely free, ad-free, and doesn't even have a ""buy-me-a-coffee""/patreon link. It's free. Enjoy it! (and no, I'm not collecting data to sell. I wouldn't even know how to begin to do that.)**

## FAQ:

### Rating is subjective. How do you handle that?

That's the whole point of aggregate sites! Rather than rely on one dude/dudette's opinion on some random subreddit, you see what the average of many gamer's experiences is. And while one person's ""difficult"" may be another person's ""easy"", the two gamers should still rate games relative to one another in the same way (e.g. Game A will be more difficult than Game B for both of them, even if one gamer thinks they're both easy) 

### How do you account for different difficulty modes?

Choose the difficulty mode when you rate! While the main rating score averages all ratings together, a game's page shows you it's per-difficulty mode stats (including a breakdown showing all the votes).

#### Not every game uses the same difficulty modes

Yes, this is a difficult problem to solve. As there are no APIs that provide this information, either I have to painstakingly research each game and submit the modes myself, rely on user inputs (and have to worry about moderating accuracy and appropriateness), or, as I'm currently doing, provide a few generic options. I defaulted to the last option because it's the simplest for now, but if traffic continues to grow, I will definitely concentrate on improving this aspect of the website!

### There can be a lot of reasons a game is difficult. How do you handle that?

There are two ways to handle this problem. First, users can add tags to each game from a pre-defined list of tags. I'll refine these terms over time, but for now they include terms like ""spikey difficulty"", ""challenging platforming"", ""janky controls"", ""hard puzzles"" etc.

The second is to comment on the game's page and discuss the game's difficulty. It's not the most robust comment system, but it will work for now!


### Hey, I've seen this posted a few months ago in another subreddit. Has anything changed?

Not for end users. I spent the last two months migrating the app from a Singe Page Architecture (SPA) to a NextJS server-side rendered architecture in order to fix some issues with SEO. I thought it would be a quick migration, and here I am 2 months later :P",1,1741635037.0,IndieGaming,0,1.0,False

##⁢ Understanding ‍Your Needs: Key Considerations Before ⁣buying

Before exploring our⁣ top ⁢picks,⁢ consider the‍ following factors to ensure you ⁣choose⁣ the perfect accent ottoman chair for your ​needs:

*  ⁣ **Size and Space:** Measure ⁢your‍ space before you start shopping. Consider where you plan to place the ottoman and how much room ‍you have‌ available.

1j872m2,https://i.redd.it/eyknoj4jywne1.jpeg,It’s glorious.,"I agonized over which lever machine to get and ultimately settled on the above-pictured robot, which just arrived today from Cafuné. I had no doubt it would pull good shots given how everyone speaks so highly of this little guy, but I was just expecting a small incremental improvement over my BBE. 

Well I just pulled my first shot. Holy shit. Is this thing for real? Is this legal? Night and day difference between what I was getting out of my Breville all for a (relatively) low price.  I couldn’t be happier. Also shoutout to Cafuné for the quick shipping and nice handwritten note.

1j871z5,https://www.reddit.com/r/spaceghost/comments/1j871z5/my_george_lowe_story/,My George Lowe story,"The first time I met George Lowe, I was at the Wizard World convention in Chicago, in... I think 2005. I was mostly stuck at my own table there, and didn't have much of an opportunity to scope out what was going on elsewhere on the floor. But as I was walking across the venue to get food or something, I heard an unmistakable voice complaining that his coffee tasted like ""cat shit."" (His words.) I went over and said hi, and because the con hadn't actually started yet, I got to chat with him for a good 10-15 minutes about nothing in particular. (My main takeaway was that he was considering lawyering up to fight for writing credit on SGC2C, since so much of the dialogue was improvised by him. I don't think anything ever really came of that, sadly.)

Jump ahead to 2013. I'd been writing/producing/performing in a sketch comedy podcast for a few years at this point, and I was looking to expand my voice talent beyond the friends I'd been using. And somehow I discovered that George was available for private recording sessions, at the frankly far too low price of $500 for an hour. So I reached out to the contact on his website and, not too long after that, I heard from his representation. And we were in business! Space Ghost was going to do some voices for me! OH GOD.

I wrote a few pages of stuff for him -- roles in completely scripted sketches, some generic lines that I intended to find a use for later (SGC2C-style) and a bunch of production bumpers (my name, as well as my other performers; the name of my production company, etc.) When he called me as arranged, I presented this material to him...

...and he was not happy. When he'd been told ""podcast,"" he assumed I'd want to interview him.  He was not expecting actual voiceover work, and told me as much. I suddenly became terrified that he might bail on me, leaving me without any recorded material whatsoever and maybe also out $500.

But after a minute or two of grumbling, he talked himself into just reading what I'd provided for him. (I didn't have much influence on this decision; I mostly just sat and listened to him get mad and then get over it.) And then, almost immediately, it was like a switch had been flipped. I'd worked with enthusiastic amateur voice people like me before, but never with a pro. And George was a fucking *pro*.

He clearly didn't want to be there for this. I also don't think he entirely understood everything I wanted him to read. Not because my writing was particularly over his head or anything, but it just wasn't the sort of thing he typically did. But none of that mattered, because he nailed every single line. He gave me alternate takes on nearly everything. And like... 8 times out of 10, his version was miles better than what I'd had in mind.

I ended up using the material from that one hour session for years after that. In fact, to this day, 12 years later, it's still his voice that says the name of my production company at the beginning of every single podcast I make. (And I've produced a *lot* of stuff in the last 12 years. Thousands of hours of material, all kicked off by George's voice.)

I had always intended to schedule another session with him, mostly to correct or update some of that original stuff. I'm sad that I'll never get the chance. But I feel privileged to have spent the time I did in his presence.

[This is an outtake from that session](https://soundcloud.com/user-906966498/george-lowe-as-orson). If you're familiar with Orson Welles' infamous frozen peas spot (George knew it well), it's brilliant. And even if you're not familiar with it... I think this still stands as some primo George Lowe weirdness.",7,1741634784.0,spaceghost,1,1.0,False

Back story ive known this man over 10 years, he's currently a close friend of my currrnt partner and I knew him before my partner did.
My partner and I have been dating for over 7 years.
The friend has a girlfriend and they've been going steady for 6 years.
Both my friend and I have been flirty for the whole time we've known each other. Had numerous kisses etc when we've been out, never slept together. Over the last few weeks I reached out for advice regarding my relationship. He's been supportive.. then things turned super flirty and he said he wished I didn't get with my partner as he wishes we could have had a chance to give things a go. Timing has never been great for either of us. 
Anyway we arranged to meet for a coffee to talk about things and he's now decided that he is happy and regrets the whole thing. Baring in mind some pretty steamy things have been said, mostly on his part. I've always had a soft spot for him and definitely feel as my current partner and I aren't great we kind of gravitated back to each other. 

Why would he ultimately now change his mind? Neither couples are young either we're all in our 30s no children etc.

Trader Joe’s is known for exceptional chocolate, if we do say so ourselves. This spring, we believe we’ll also be known for egg-ceptional chocolate—in the form of Trader Joe’s Italian Chocolate Eggs! 

The pastel-colored, 12.34-ounce window box shows off this assortment of Easter-friendly Eggs that have been beautifully panned (rotated in a drum to add layers of candy coating) to give their exterior a color-shading effect that is nostalgically reminiscent of egg dying. And they taste as good as they look! Equal quantities of four different flavors, include: Green—milk chocolate shell filled with white chocolate & coffee filling; Orange— dark chocolate shell with dark chocolate filling; Pink—milk chocolate shell with milk chocolate filling; and Lavender—milk chocolate shell with hazelnut filling. 

The delightful colors (derived only from natural sources, such as vegetable & fruit juices) make for an elegant presentation in a glass candy bowl when everyone comes over for the big family meal. Or if you’re the guest instead of the host, then bring a box of Trader Joe’s Italian Chocolate Eggs with you to say thanks and spread a little springtime joy. Of course, these Chocolate Eggs are also the ideal size for hiding inside of plastic eggs— which you can then hide anywhere for eager children to hunt and discover!

Body:

Hey r/vancouver, ever open your fridge and get smacked in the face with a mystery stink? 🤢 We've ALL been there. Before you chuck everything and live on takeout, try these quick fixes:

1.  **The Obvious Purge:** Toss anything expired or looking sus. Seriously, that science experiment in the back needs to GO.
2.  **Baking Soda Bomb:** The OG fridge deodorizer. Open box, back of the fridge. Done. Replace every 1-3 months.
3.  **Charcoal Power:** For *really* nasty smells (like, ""did something die in here?"" nasty), grab some activated charcoal. It's like a black hole for odors.
4.  **Coffee Grind Magic:** Not just for your morning cup! A bowl of dry, *unused* coffee grounds absorbs odors AND leaves a subtle coffee scent. ☕
5.   **Vinegar Victory:** Mix equal parts white vinegar and water, spray down the inside, and wipe. Bye-bye, stink! (The vinegar smell goes away, promise!)

Bonus Vancouver Tip: If you're near Granville Island Market, some stalls have good deals on produce, keep some lemon slices for extra fresh smells.

Still stinky? Could be a bigger issue. Might be time to call in the pros (shameless plug: we're Vancouver Appliance Service Pros 😉).

1j86wfl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j86wfl,Monday Morning Mishap,"Last week, I made my most delicious batch of jalapeno cheddar sourdough yet--by the end of the week, my husband and I had finished the whole loaf.

I fed my starter yesterday morning, made the dough and did stretch and folds last night, put it in the fridge overnight (10 hours), let it come to room temperature this morning (2 hours), shaped it, and popped it in the oven.

Thirty minutes into baking, I sit bolt upright in my desk chair--I forgot to score my loaf! Clearly have not had enough coffee on this Monday morning. I run into the kitchen, deluding myself into thinking it's not too late. I pull my bread oven out and try to take the lid off--to no avail. It's stuck. Insistent, I keep pulling, and it finally comes off... with the whole crust still attached, to my dismay. I stare at it for a few seconds, whispering curses under my breath. Not knowing what else to do, I pried it off of the lid (conquering some very stuck melted cheese) and gently laid it back over the rest of the loaf. I patted halfheartedly it in apology, put it back in the oven, and hoped for the best. This was the result.

I'm not sure why this loaf rose so much more than usual (other than the lack of scoring?), but I think it may be my ugliest loaf yet. Good thing my husband's never been super picky about his bread. This is my third time using this recipe with the same bread oven and perhaps my 20th loaf of sourdough overall. It's been duly noted for next time that I should split up this recipe into two loaves rather than one mega-loaf.

I have to take a bus, a train, a tram and another bus in that order. Today, after I got off the train, a guy (m about my age) came up to me and asked me if I spoke English (I live in Germany) and where the tram station was. I told him to follow me because I needed to go there too. He then asked me if he needed to get on another bus and showed me where he wanted to go on Google Maps. His destination was right in front of my house, which was strange because it was still an hour away. I told him I had to go in the same direction so he could just follow me again. He told me he was an exchange student from Sweden studying at the same university as me, so I asked him what he was doing at this destination (in front of my house) because there's nothing there but houses and a field. He said he was going to a festival, but I told him there weren't any, so he changed his story and said he was going to the cinema. But there is no cinema and when I asked him what film he was going to see, he couldn't tell me the title. He also asked for my number and if i wanted to get some coffee with him sometime. I'm worried. Is he stalking me? How does he know where I live? Or was he just confused and thought there was a cinema near my house? But why would he drive 2 hours?

1j86uoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j86uoc/the_ants_are_getting_more_organized/,The Ants Are Getting More Organized,"I need you all to at least try to believe me, as crazy as this sounds. I am making this as a call for help, because I really don't know what to do. Yes, I called the exterminator, he came and sprayed, but I swear to God it's like they migrated after I called them. They have been getting more organized, moving in patterns and taking things that aren't food.  

It all started about two weeks ago, I just gotten back from a vacation with my buddies to go see some museums in the town over (and town after that). Living in Louisiana, there's plenty of culture of history here, so we were gone for a few days. After we got back, all hung out at one of their houses for a while, I headed back to my own. Thats when I saw it: the ant hill, in my perfect, green yard. Now, I'm not one of those yard nuts that takes a tape measurer to his grass to make sure it's all perfect length, but I do care quite a decent bit. It pained my heart a little to see this, but I'm sure I can get an exterminator here in a few days to take care of it. When I called, they said it would have to be on Tuesday since its Thursday, Friday is full, and they don't do weekends, which I completely understand and pay with my card in advance over the phone to reserve my slot for Tuesday.  

The next morning, while I was making my coffee and morning usual of buttered toast with jam, I decided to stare out the window and see how my little burdens are doing. There they were, little disgusting freaks, I really really hate bugs. But ants? Oh man, I DESPISE ants like no other. When I was a kid, at the public park in my parent's neighborhood, one of the local older kids that is just a public nuisance pushed me off bike and into a pile of fire ants. Since then, I've despised ants, so I'm going to be overjoyed to watch the exterminator do their work. I saw the little bastards, crawling in a single file line down my concrete walkway. I decided I would give them a small piece of my jam toast, to give them a few days of bliss before their ultimate demise.  I crack open my front door and toss out a small piece pf the toast onto the walkway, then close my door back and sprint back to the kitchen sink window to watch. They scurried down the walkway, still in the single file line, and grabbed the bit of toast. I watched them all walk their way back to the anthill, I felt myself shiver at the thought of how many of them could live underground. The exterminator couldn't come soon enough.  

Later that day, I closed my laptop after clocking out of work, and decided it was about prime time to tend to my vegetable garden. I mentioned it earlier, but I live in Louisiana which is the perfect atmosphere to garden tomatoes and broccoli. I put on my gardening clothes, boots and all, and started making my way to the gardening shed. I could see a line of ants, crawling along side my fence, and that's when something caught my eye: near the front of their single file line, a group of them were carrying one of my little wooden garden stakes. I start walking my way over to them, but by the time I caught up, the ants along with my garden stake were already on the ant pile, and I am NOT getting close to that monolith to these devil bugs. Now, as far as I know, ants don't usually just take things that aren't food, especially wooden stakes.  

The next day, I started my morning routine per usual, and decided to check on my little ant friends. They seem to not pay me any mind, and they even took one of my stakes, which is kind of cool. I've done some thinking on it, and ants could help keep my garden safe from other insects, so maybe calling the exterminator wasn't the best idea. I sleepily stumbled over to look out my kitchen sink window, and that's when i saw what made me make this post: a small shimmer of something metallic being sucked into the ant pile by the horde. The top of it looked familiar from what i could see and that's when it hit me: that was my spare key that I keep in a fake rock in my garden. Ants don't take keys. What use would they have for them? Their larvae can't use it as a place to hide from predators, and it they had to go out of their way to get to my spare key. How the hell did they even get into the fake rock? These single file lines, looking back on it, are way to straight and perfect for ants. My heads spinning and my brain hurts trying to figure out a rational solution to this, I'm going to clock in to work and keep you guys updated when I can. Please, give me a rational explanation.  ",6,1741634260.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

This is going to be a Very Long  post .. and only my third post ever on reddit. I resort to this because I have no idea what else I can do.    I will try to shorten this as much as I can because if I don't, I could literally write a novel on the things me and this man have been through.  I have attempted many times in the past to ask for help but I am not ready to read the mean comments I know that I will get.  I see it all the time when people reach for help, some of yall are just ruthless.  Alot of what I am going to put here are things I have never shared with anyone.  A very close friend that I have knows all of our history.  My parents only know what I want them to know as well as my sisters.  His mother know bits a pieces but they also don't know every thing.   Why ? 
I don't share much number 1 because it's embarrassing and 2 because I tend to make excuses and lie to people so that I can make myself feel better and not be judged.  

Again.  I'm sharing as much as I can about my 15 years of marriage so you can get the full picture and how we ended up where we are today.  

I ( 32f) husband 35M have been married almost 15 years.  Met at a game when I was 16 years old. I fell head over heels. I was young and Ignored so many red flags.  He was 19 at the time and was about to get ready to deploy to Iraq.  

The first very red flag that I over looked was this man's ego / confidence / "" I'm the best of the best "" attitude. 
   I saw it , I knew it , I ignored it.  
I was such a people pleaser back then due to my relationship with my mother.  The verbal abuse that endured from my mother has made me a very weak person through out all of my life.  I am a huge people pleaser and always have been.  I didn't realize until a few years ago where this came from and why I was the way I was. I had a good childhood other than the mental/verbal abuse from my mother.   

Moving on..We started dating.  Again.  The red flags, the anger and very rude / asshole behavior he had towards just pretty much every person was very much apparent.  Not only to myself but my parents and friends.  My parents immediately did not like him.  But I was a very stubborn 16 year old and I would argue with them about everything.  I always thought I was right.  And I thought he hung the moon.  

Moving on to a few months of dating with several red flags noted and ignored.  He deployed to Iraq.  He was gone for a year.  During this year - I am trying to finish high school.  Many arguments took place over camera calls because he wanted to know where I was and who I was with most days.  Would get angry if I was out with friends.  Again.  I was a teenager still in school.  I continued to over look these things.  
Bypassing the next year of his deployment- I graduated High School.  The day I graduated I moved out of my parents home ( left them absolutely destroyed ) and moved in with his mother.  He was still in Iraq.  
We started planning a wedding to be married as soon as he got home.  
Fast forward to him coming home > he returned home.  It was very clear that I had an even meaner version of him than I did before he left.  He was abusive in every way that you could imagine.  ( this was kept secret from my family as best I could - even though deep down they knew.  His mother also knew but chose to ignore and over look it as well )  I still married this man even though my parents , family and friends begged me not to.  We married - he absolutely ruined our wedding and left my grandmother in tears with the way he treated our guest , family and friends. Very loud , very attention seeking, rude , macho asshole attitude.  My father also cried his eyes out. And I cried my own eyes out in the bathroom as well knowing that I was probably making a big mistake.    I still walked down the isle.  

I was still a very young adult who thought I knew what was best for me.  I was working a very small job making shit money and he came home to work as well.  We didn't have much at all and continued to live with his mother for nearly 3 years.   Within this three years. He was physically abusive leaving bruises several times, mentally abusive and verbally abusive.   ( I made this to be okay in mind because I to would try my best to fight back as well.  I didn't just lay down and take it > my young self chopped this up to "" we love each other so much we don't know how to deal with our anger and I also fight back so it's not really like he's abusing me "" )   I also would chop up his reactions and verbal and mental abuse to his childhood trauma with his abusive father and the fact that he went to war.  I told myself I married a military man and I chose to endure this and I kept telling myself he will get better.  

In this three years - he was of age to drink,  bar hop and go to places that I could not get into yet.  I was left MANY MANY NIGHTS  home with his mother while he was out partying and drinking and cheating.   At the time I didn't have proof he was cheating but I had been told by several in our area.   I just laid there every night for a year or two with mascara stains covering my bed. It was so normal to see them all over the bed from my crying.  It was so over looked back then.  He would either come home drunk and fight with me or come home drunk and pass out.  Either one was what you could expect.  His mother saw no issue with this.  I only made it a problem because I was young and immature.  Some nights she would go bar hop with him.  

The 3rd year of marriage- he was very badly injured at his job.  I rushed to the hospital when I got the call at my own job that he was hurt.   I'll leave out the extent of his injuries to try to make this shorter but he ended up having 15 surgeries > was close to having a limb removed and basically bed ridden for about 7 months.  Within these 7 months I worked my ass off during the day , drove hours back and forth to the hospital.  Never missed a surgery and bathed,  cleaned and fed this man. Cleaned his ass for him when he had bowel movements.    He came home ( mother's house ) on home health and a medical bed was placed in the livingroom for him.  I slept in the livingroom.  Had many alarms set for all his pills and meds all through out the night, every night for months. Through this I still delt with verbal abuse any time he could wake up and dish it out.  But he was so high on meds half the time that I did my best to ignore him.  I also couldn't imagine the amount of pain he was in so I did my very best to hold my head high , work every day to make him proud and still take care of him as if he were an infant.  His mother was there to help as much as she could but there was only so much she could.  I was the one to do the more private things plus try and feed and keep meds in him at all times.  Part of me was so thankful that he was not able to get out of bed , go drink , gamble and stay out all hours of the night.  And i thought for sure through all of that > he would finally love me and treat me better.    And Finally I got a glimour of hope when he was finally able to move around a little and get up.  He was actually nicer.  He would tell his friends on the phone how thankful he was to have me.  Let me also add that while he was bed ridden at home > I became VERY SICK and required EMS to the E.R for phenomena where I was told that If I didn't give my body some rest very soon it was going to just pretty much shut down on me.  I still continued to care for his every need through this when i got home from the hospital.  He was very angry that I had been taken by EMS to the E.R and was mad that we would get a bill.  

Moving past these very long months of misery.  He went back to his old ways but by this time I was also old enough to finally go with him.   Those were the absolute worst days of my life.  Both of us drinking  was always always a bad thing.  But I never put two and two together for a few years.   During this time> we finally received a settlement check for his work injury.  We were able to put a down payment on our very first home.  I told myself when we could get away from his mother we would start to be better, healthy couple.  As she encouraged all his behaviors and told me I was being young and immature as did he.  I started believing them both.  

We got our home.  We got a few little things we could afford- my parents helped buy us things even though they hated him.  They loved me.  So they tried their best to be by me even though I wouldn't tell them anything about how bad it really was.  

We lived there for 8 years.  Full of some of the worst days I have ever dealt with at that time.  The absolute darkest of days.  During this 8 years.  We miscarriage our first child.  Buried it.  Got pregnant again.  Had our baby.  
Also during these years he was still everything j hated and more.  Cheating was very regular for him and by this point I did have proof of several different occasions.  But I stayed home with our child , tried to ignore as much as I could and just be the best mom I could be. I held on to "" God will fix this.  God will save us.  "" That was very difficult on the days he would come home drunk and completely destroy everything in our home.  I can't count the number of times I got down on my hands and knees and would try to put that old coffee table back together.  Even if I had to glue pieces back on, we couldn't afford things back then so I did my best to repair things with what I had.  
 Let me add in I was only about 108 lbs when we married.  He was about 220. I had dropped down to nearly 90 to 95 lbs on several occasions throughout these few years of life. 
Here is where I think I'm going to get some mean feed back.  

Over the course of these years our baby has turned 2.  I hated this man with ever fiber of my being but was to scared and too weak to leave.   But I also believed that without him I was nothing.  No one would want me I was so immature , crazy , and useless and a mother.  I would be alone if I left him and I didn't know how to be alone as I had never ever been alone.  I went straight from my parents home into his.  

I started to turn into a very angry person.   He took a better job out on the road where I was constantly being told he was cheating.. half the time he wouldn't answer his phone and he would be gone for weeks at and time and then back home for a week. I did catch and find several conversations of sexting and wanting to meet up with other women more than once durinf his time out on the road.  I hated and dreaded his return every time.  
During this time is where another man had showed up out of no where > showed me attention,  was actually nice to me, complimented me and made me feel special.  All things I hadn't known in years at this point.  Lots of talking led to an affair where  I was caught.  He beat the living pulp out of that guy and I guess had every right.  He broke his ribs- his fingers- his nose and beat him with a metal object taking chunks of meat from his leg.   Then he destroyed his car as well after he got done beating him - he pulled out a pistol.  Let the man I was seeing get in his car and leave while he held a pistol to my head and called my parents and told them to come and pick up their ""wh***e"".  I think at that point I didn't care if he shot me or not.  I walked away from the gun where I was shoved into my own vehicle.  I got my phone. Dialed 911 and let the phone sit.  The law did show up , my daddy showed up and got me and my things. ( my child was with his grandmother when all of this took place.  I never let my kid meet this other man )  I went and picked my baby up and I moved back to my parents home and into my old bedroom.  Because  I never told anyone what all really happened behind closed doors with him all these years - even though several knew and never said anything out loud, I was made out to be the wh**e of the county while he was played victim.  His family and hhe himself destroyed me all over social media.  And what makes this even better is how little I cared.  My reputation and my name were every where I looked.  I lost the few "" friends"" ( if you want to call them that ) that I had.  I was plastered as a cheating sl*t.  But all I felt was relief.  To finally be free and away from him.  

Three months I was home with my parents- we were sharing time with our son and we were figuring out slowly how to divorce.  When he shows up to my mother's home  crying begging and pleading for me to give him one more chance.   He would never cheat again, he would never put his hands on me again.  He begged for counseling and said he would call the V.A. and get some help.  All of which he did.  Over next month we went to marriage counseling where he finally admitted out loud all the years of abuse he put me through.  
The one additional thing that I asked him to do was admit it to his mother.  I requested this because for years she would see bruises , marks, cuts or even that I couldn't really speak because my jaw was probably out of place and she would look the other way.  ONE TIME in those years at her home did she ask me if her son hit me.  When I said yes.  She called me a liar.  I never told anyone ever again.   

So I req that he admit to her.  And he did.  Where she gave me a half ass apology and sobbed in her bedroom.  I never got a real true apology from her   .  He did go to the VA.  He did get help.  He did go on medication.  He did go through marriage counseling. And he did repair the hate my parents held for him.  Which completely BLEW MY MIND when my mother said to give it one more shot ( granted she didn't know how bad the physical abuse had gotten between us ) she only knew bits and very tiny pieces that i allowed her to know. But eventually he had me convinced to come home and stay married.  He put in the work  he actually stuck by it.  

I came home but deep down I didn't want to.  I cried when I came home and felt like puking my guts up because when I looked at him and this different version of him that I had never known before.  It literally made me sick. I had to endure years of misery to get here ? I had to breakdown and be the worst version of my self in order for you to love me ?  I had to go through all of this in order for you to decide you wanted to finally just be kind and caring and gentle ?  Very soon of returning home did my hate and anger grow.  He had turned into a man a had never met and I quickly turned into him.  I was not a good mom anymore.  I found every reason to be away from home , find baby sitters and be away from him.  Every reason I could find weather that be girls day /shopping etc.  I would go.  He would beg and plead for me and I treated him like shit on the bottom of my shoe for the next few years.  He dealt with it.  I avoided sex at all cost.  I was the drinker now.  I was the violent partner.  I was the cheater.  I ended up having another affair while he was staying home with our son.  I came home as soon as I had done it , told him to his face and that I deep down hated him and could not forget nor forgive him for the years of misery I had went through.  I told him I needed to leave , divorce and move on as my hate for him had turned me into a person I never thought I could be.   I packed my bags.  Grabbed our kid and moved back to my parents.  Where I stayed - got an attorney and was 30 days from divorce.   I was then convinced to try marriage counseling once more.  He begged and pleaded and said he understood my anger and reasoning for doing what I had done, he forgives me and just wants to be happy , whole and healthy.    I put the divorce on hold.  Went to counseling again.  Where I was able to release alot of anger hurt and resentment.  ALOT OF WORK WENT INTO THIS.  I never thought I would love this man again. Ever.    And somehow over the next few years.  I did.  I forgave myself for the things that I did and I forgave him but I have NEVER EVER FORGOTTEN IT.  He has never laid another hand on me nor destroyed our things ever again.  To this day he does not do that.   He isn't a drunk.  He isn't physically abusive.  He is still angry - has outburst over literally nothing.  Says horrible horrible things when he is angry even in front of our child who is now 12.  Our kid never knows if he is going to be hearing us fighting when he comes home or goes to bed.  That eats me alive and I hate it.  I feel like a complete failure for him most days.  ( somewhere in the middle of this we moved into our "" forever home "" a very nice home we never pictured we would ever be able to afford)

Here I am today... him and I can never seem to get on the same page.  One minute I feel like we are great and healthy.  Next thing I know we are both not speaking for a week , avoiding one another.  He's yelling at me.  I'm yelling at him.  Our past is constantly brought up.  He still has this macho/  I'm the shit / I'm always right / I'm just an asshole it's who I am attitude ' toward any and everyone though it has very much improved from years ago. 

I have one friend.  Because she is the only friend that can tolerate him and his rudeness.  Most people in our town very much dislike him because of his attitude and outlook.  He is seen as an "" asshole "" ..  we don't get invited to much because people literally can't tolerate him.  Loud , obnoxious and needs validated every 5 seconds.  

I find myself looking for reasons for him not to attend gatherings so that I am not publicly embarrassed or humiliated.  He belittles me in front of people and finds humor in it. He only does this in public ?  These are things I have made excuses for.  I can't even keep count  the number of women and sometimes even men who have come to me privately amd asked "" why are you dealing with this when you don't have to "" .. over the years of this marriage.  

I have never had the guts to fully give up and walk away.  And though we are completely different people now in our 30's.  We don't even know those young adults we use to be  I still can't fully forget the things I went through,  new memories still come to me even after all these years. I guess of things my brain has tried to block out.    We are constantly arguing. Or I try to avoid telling anything about how I'm feeling to keep from a full blown cussing match where we end up not talking for weeks at a time.   - which is what we are currently doing at this time.  Sleeping on opposite ends of the house.  It's usually resolved by him all of sudden pretending nothing happened and I'm supposed to forget it and move on. So nothing gets resolved.  

He has also found a game over the last two years that he spends EVERY FREE SECOND on and pours massive amount of money into it.  This game includes a discord chat which he openly admits he hides from me because "" I will get upset if I see some of the things that go on in there ""   this is where alot of our problems are coming from the last few years.  He works , comes home. 
 Straight to game until I have dinner done , straight back to game until 1 or 2 in the morning.  He is so addicted to it he can't even look up and acknowledge that me or his son still live in the home with him.   Every fight we have now is me asking for him to prioritize his gaming time and his family time.  I don't go through his phone and read anything  though part of me wants to know what is on there that you could be so obsessed with to the degree that he is.. I don't ask him to rid the hobby as it's better than all the other things he use to do... so I just shut up and deal with it.  But I am lonely ,  so very lonely  and after 15 years and all the things we have dealt with and been through. I am just so so tired.  

But I don't know if I have the strength courage or guts to get out. Or if I'm just asking for to much regarding not playing the game every second of every single day.  He is the bread winner.  Through all those years of misery he still provided.  His way of apologizing all those years for abuse was gifts.  He showered me in gifts.   He has always made a way to provide things I or our child wanted when I could not afford it on my own.   I still have never been alone.  Never experienced what it's like to be a single mom with no help.  

God it felt so good to finally say all this.  .. but I'm 15 years in and I'm afraid it's all for nothing.  I don t know what else I can do to have a happy healthy marriage at this point.     It's just seems like it's never going to happen for us.

 If you made it to the end of this post - please try not to be mean.  
I am real person with real feelings and it took alot for me to put all this out there.   I'm truly just exhausted    ",2,1741634174.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1j86t8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthBend/comments/1j86t8l/miller_beach_looking_for_a_perfectly_fun_day_trip/,(Miller Beach) Looking for a perfectly fun day trip to a cool beach town in the national park?,"Trying to find a fun day trip?  Check this out.  

Downtown Miller Beach is on Lake Street, the Indiana Dunes National Park Miller Woods is on Lake Street, the South Shore Miller station is on Lake Street, and Miller Woods Beach is on Lake Street.  And an off road bike trail on Lake Street connects all of them in ONLY 1.5 miles. It's a brand new bike trail.

Miller Beach is where the Indiana Dunes National Park begins and it has globally rare and beautiful oak savannas, and dune and swale with wetlands and birding. It is where the national park was dedicated.

Not only where the Indiana Dunes National Park begins, there are 20+ miles of trails and 3.5 miles of pristine beaches there. It's an easy day trip and really cool because there's a cute little downtown with places to eat and shop, plus the national park and Lake Michigan. Amazing all of this is so close together but it is.

If you are driving, take I94 to the Ripley exit. Put Tiny's Coffee Bar [www.tinyscoffeebar.com](http://www.tinyscoffeebar.com) in your navigation and stop there for great food, cocktails and espressos. Vibration's Juice Bar is a cool spot with great smoothies and lots of vegetarian choices. Indie Bang is a wonderful boutique, and the School Shops are wonderful curated vintage clothes and more. Miller Pizza is wonderful.  These are all on Lake Street. And there are more places than that.

1j86rpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1j86rpa/i_dont_know_what_to_think_about_his_52m_behaviour/,I don’t know what to think about his (52M) behaviour towards me (34M). Help,"I'm (34F) not sure what to think. I've been friends with this guy (52M) for at least five years. We met at a work event and usually see each other twice a year because we live in different cities. He's a good guy, smart, charismatic, and respectful. We both work in research at university and are in the same research project. We're both married, so our relationship has always been strictly platonic. We don’t normally text or talk outside of those work-related events; we just catch up when we see each other. He would just send me happy birthday and congratulations when something important happens in my life. That's all.

That said, there’s something that’s been bothering me. For years, every time I post a story on WhatsApp, he’s always the first person to view it—sometimes within seconds. It’s been happening consistently for a long time, and I’ve started to wonder if it’s just a coincidence or something more. Out of curiosity, I started paying attention to when he was online and noticed that he’s often online/offline around the same times I am. One day I decided to post a status while he was online—and again, he viewed it within 2–3 seconds or even less. It was so quick, it almost felt like he was waiting for it. It struck me as odd, and I don’t know if I’m reading too much into it.

He also seems to care a lot about me. He remembered my birthday after I casually mentioned it in a conversation many months ago and even texted me. (I don’t even remember most of my friends' birthdays unless Facebook reminds me!) The way he treats me and looks at me, it’s clear that he cares and thinks highly of me. He congratulates me on life milestones, recalls little things I’ve said many years ago (even though we’re not that close), copies me sometimes, and often tries to find things in common.

The last time I saw him — a little over a month ago — he got super emotional and was even trembling with heart palpitations while sitting next to me at a work event. It felt like he was experiencing massive anxiety, and I could sense his vulnerability. That was the moment I started wondering if maybe he had other intentions with me. That’s also when I began paying closer attention to his behavior — and then came the WhatsApp story views, which made things feel even stranger.

I also remembered another instance: he once left his own work meeting in the middle of the day just because I texted him at the last minute to grab a coffee (since I was visiting his city). At the time, I didn’t think much of it — he’s a friend, after all — but now, all these little things are adding up and making me rethink our entire dynamic.

I really value his friendship and I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but I also don’t know how to approach this. We work together, and I don’t want to create tension, but I also feel like I might need to set some boundaries or at least talk to him about it. I don’t have any intention of going beyond friendship, and I want to be clear about that — but I’m not sure how to handle this without making things awkward or misinterpreting his actions.",0,1741634048.0,AskMenAdvice,6,0.5,False

Downtown Miller Beach is on Lake Street, the Indiana Dunes National Park Miller Woods is on Lake Street, the South Shore Miller station is on Lake Street, and Miller Woods Beach is on Lake Street.  And an off road bike trail on Lake Street connects all of them in ONLY 1.5 miles. It's brand new.

Miller Beach is where the Indiana Dunes National Park begins and it has globally rare and beautiful oak savannas, and dune and swale with wetlands and birding.

Not only where the Indiana Dunes National Park begins, there are 20+ miles of trails and 3.5 miles of pristine beaches there. It's an easy day trip and really cool because there's a cute little downtown with places to eat and shop, plus the national park and Lake Michigan. Amazing all of this is so close together but it is.

If you are driving, take I94 to the Ripley exit or get off on I65. Put Tiny's Coffee Bar [www.tinyscoffeebar.com](http://www.tinyscoffeebar.com) in your navigation and stop there for great food, cocktails and espressos. Vibration's Juice Bar is a cool spot with great smoothies and lots of vegetarian choices. Indie Bang is a wonderful boutique, and the School Shops are wonderful curated vintage clothes and more. Miller Pizza is wonderful.  These are all on Lake Street. And there are more places than that.

There is also the South Shore if that works for you - the Miller station is on Lake Street, anchoring the south end of downtown Miller Beach. If you keep walking through the downtown, you will get to the national park's Douglas Nature Center in only 20 minutes by foot. It's also a bike trail, bring your bike.

1j86pmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarkNarrations/comments/1j86pmv/i_got_the_neighborhood_sugar_dealers_kicked_out/,I got the neighborhood sugar dealers kicked out.,"OK! Story time! 

I (31F) have lived overseas for work and school since I was 18, but I have been back in the States for three years. While I was away, my parents bought me a cute little house for when I would come back to the States. They have since passed on. Before that happened, we all agreed that my aunt and her husband would live in the house so no one else broke in while I was gone.

Everything was great while I was gone. My mom and aunt sent me updates and cute care packages while I lived overseas, finished school, and worked there. When I was about 21, a problem was brought to my attention: the neighbors next door. There were six grown adults and ten kids, ranging from brooding teenagers to learning-to-walk babies. My aunt and her husband would not have cared if not for one MAJOR problem. These people would let their babies wander around outside. Not in the backyard where the fence exists, oh no! In the front yard where the cars are present,

My aunt almost hit the five-year-old chasing the baby when she was on her way back from her night shift—I will say that again—HER NIGHT SHIFT. She got home at four in the morning, and these two were out of the house in their PJs. She got out of her car and tried to figure out WHY they were in the dark with no adults. Well, she was wrong. They did have an adult. 

One of the adults in the house was in the business of dealing sugars, not the kind you put in your coffee but the kind you put up your nose. He yelled at my aunt to either screw off or buy something. She told me all of this, and I was angry. So I asked for their address, because I would look it up. Well, the address was 6969 BEAnAhole Lane. The house was part of an HOA we had managed to get out of for some reason. Thank God because the HOA would be the DHOA (dead HOA) if I had to suffer them now that I'm back.

So, thanks to the time zone difference, I emailed the head of the HOA a formal complaint every hour every day for ten months. My aunt told me that the head of the HOA came to her house and begged her to stop emailing them. The problem was that the house was owned by a larger company that rented the houses out, so the HOA had their hands tied. My aunt got that info, and the second verse is the same as the first but with a new, fancier title in my emails. Instead of Miss Depression Nipples, Coder at XVS company, it was Miss DepressionNipples, Senior Coder and Audit manager at XVS company. 

They were so nice and explained that they would be more than happy to get the people out of the sugar house... if I could prove it. OK. I was about to be heading over for the holiday anyway. I made sure to make the guy talk my ear off about prices, products, and all that jazz while I played on my phone, knowing full well that I was recording the whole thing. My aunt told me about two months later that the sugar house was free of those people, and the cops took away the sugar dealer himself.

I wanted to write this one out because the new neighbors are so nice. I grow stuff in my backyard and trade it with the lady with chickens and bees for eggs and honey. Anything I know I won't be able to eat goes to them because they are always so nice and polite. They even send over Christmas presents like canned popcorn. We have a much better relationship, and my aunt moved into her old house where my cousins had been keeping it up to date. ",17,1741633904.0,MarkNarrations,1,0.87,False

I’m bringing my girlfriend to London at the end of the month for just over a week and I want to be sure to hit some of the important things without feeling like too much of a tourist. I was most recently in London two years ago so I am basing our (loose!) itinerary on that trip, combined with the fact that this will be her first time. Important to note that she is much more interested in museums and dining than most of the “classic” firsts like BP/the Eye/etc. We’re both early 30s and active (read: I think walking around most of the day should be ok).

I’m keen to hear your recommendations on what to do when, as we haven’t finalized the order of things yet—just numbered the days to avoid confusion. Trying to leave lots of time for wandering and squeezing in visits with friends and family.  Thanks so much for your help in advance!


Day 1: Southwark 
- “Breakfast” and walk around Borough Lane Market
- Tate Modern
(leaving lots of time here bc I spent several hours last time on the above)
- Scarfe’s at the Rosewood for live music (closer to where we’re staying)

Day 2: Covent Garden
- Early lunch at Dishoom
- Shop around a bit (I remember a few fun perfumeries for instance)
- British Museum (worth it??)
- Dinner at Noble Rot

Day 3: Spitalfields
- Spend the day walking around a bunch of vintage and thrift shops on and around Brick Lane, maybe include Spitalfields Market (?)

Other places we plan to visit:
- Keats House
- V&A (it seems people recommend the British Museum equally highly, so maybe both?)
- Lots of coffee shops (I remember loving Attendant and Monmouth, and being underwhelmed by Prufrock—but please chime in!)
- Jolene Newington Green
- Brat
- Westminster Abbey 
- Kew Gardens

Places we’d love recommendations for:
- Your favorite independent shops
- Your favorite can’t miss restaurants and bars
- Somewhere Harry Potter-related (she’s the fan so St. Pancras was my only thought)
- Your favorite museums
- Your favorite bakeries

The breakers I follow go big every 100 breaks, and I always try to make sure I get in as the 32 spots usually sell out in only a few minutes. I've had a string of bad luck lately and wasn't sure if I wanted to, but when the break released I made the decision to try.

Attempt 1 - got a spot and went to pay, but it didn't go through. For some reason an old CC was set as the payment method. When I switched to my active CC, the number I wanted had sold.

Attempt 2 - added a different spot to my basket, and it had sold before i could complete payment. 

Attempt 3 - I figured the 2 failed attempts were a sign to sit this one out. So I back out to the screen and see my lucky number sitting there, and decide that sign is stronger than the failed attempts sign (I'm a degenerate, I know). I add it to the cart and miracously complete the sale before someone else can get it. The break sells out seconds after that.

Its a random team break, and they do the randomizer. I end up with Puttsburgh. I'm Canadian, and have always thought about Crosby autograph would be sweet but out of my usual price range so I dont own one. They open the  hat up to trades and I strongly consider taking up the people offering NJD and NYR, because those teams could have some monster hits but I hold off, and, drop that line in the chat. 

We hit a rookie auto in premier, which is a good start. A Lemieux UD Canvas which looks sharp, and then a Guentzel flextures auto in engrained. Figure I'm doing decent with only The Cup and Stature to go. Ended up hitting this /10 Crosby auto in the Stature, and understand what people mean when they make that annoying ""literally shaking"" comment, but it was like I had a coffee IV in and snorted a red bull.

Campaign description:
Thousands of years ago, Sarnout was a flourishing planet. Its people mastered various crafts, cultivated the land, traded, and waged wars — leading lives much like any other. But the Grand Cataclysm shattered their world, breaking it into floating allods and changing life forever.
Gone are the old ships and portals; now, the people of Sarnout sail the skies in highly advanced astral vessels. The allods are divided between two major rival factions — the League and the Hadagan Empire — both vying for land, power, and influence. Meanwhile, the vast, mysterious Astral has become more accessible than ever, luring brave explorers with untold treasures… and lurking dangers.
Your journey begins in a rather ordinary way. As young recruits aboard the Hadagan astral ship “Invincible”, you are bound for the Empire’s capital allod, Igsh, to be sworn in. The Empire is at war, and the Motherland needs her soldiers!
Glory to the great Yasker, tovarisch!

What to expect from the game and why you should play this campaign:
The campaign is filled with references to Soviet and post-Soviet cultures and is imbued with its history, tradition, and spirit. It is an expression of the culture and vision of a post-Soviet person.
The setting itself is a blend of high-fantasy and high-technology, as well as of absurdness and seriousness.

About the GM:

1j86djo,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1j86djo/upgrading_sagebreville_barista_express_buying/,Upgrading Sage/Breville Barista Express / Buying Advice Needed [$500-$3000],"Hi there,

I bought the Sage Barista Express last year as my first real coffee machine, but now a short year later I am looking for an upgrade. The espresso that comes out is ok, but I would love to have much better espresso at home. I keep trying to dialling it in better, but notice a huge difference between for example grind level 4 and 5 (4 being too fine and 5 too coarse) for great extraction.

I make 3-5 shots a day for my partner and myself, >95% is espresso (no milk drinks).

Currently considering:

1. Keeping the sage but buying the Eureka Libra grinder on the side
2. Upgrading to Profitec Go + Eureka Libra grinder
3. Upgrading to Rancillio Silvia Pro X + Eureka Libra grinder

Question 1: What would be your recommendation (also open to other options!)? When upgrading I really do not want to be in a situation 1 year from now that I want another upgrade (would be a tough sell at home haha). The reason I consider the Rancillio is that it does provide the option for milk-based drinks for the future (when I/we maybe get more interested in those and that for a dual boiler it heats up really quick, which is very important to me.)

Question 2: What do you think will be the difference in espresso quality between options 1-3 on a 1-10 scale (I know it is hard to estimate, but just curious what more experienced people in the coffee world think.",1,1741633099.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1j86ddc,https://i.redd.it/dwz1spcctwne1.jpeg,Acaia Orbit {1 month review},"Not a lot of information on this grinder and it’s quirks so here it is for anyone in the $1450 to $1700 market. This one is the silver version, with the SSP MP coming at $1590 with shipping and taxes in the US from Acaia’s website.  

Who’s it for? 

Anyone looking for top build quality 64mm Flat Burr grinder by a well stablished brand in the coffee scene, I personally tested their amazing Customer Service when I had an issue swapping burrs and in less than 24 hours I had a technician on video call helping me, the grinder comes with your choice of Mazzer 33M or SSP LS and SSP MP, I use it as a Single-Dose, but a Hopper or GBW with the Acaia scales are available, Step-less Grind Adjustment with 0.75mm tread pitch with Weber EG-1 precision in the burr alignment(Acaia built the system for Weber), Variable RPM (600-1500) including rpm profiling(grind adjusts during grind), Auto-purge(burrs move the opposite way to clean retention and reset alignment, Auto pulse to help retention(after the first Kg of coffee retention was always within 0.1g and within 0.05g with the 5s reverse spin with auto-purge), auto stop and auto start via the Acaia scales and more customizations with the Orbit app or if you hate apps, the grinder’s button has 3 preset RPMs (600-900-1500) and double or triple taps can be configured to purge and pulse.

Who’s it not for?

The only dealbreaker I see with the grinder is swapping burrs, is not impossible but this grinder was designed by part of the Weber EG-1 team so the tolerances are very small and you need to but every screw back the same way down to the torque.

Anything else would be subjective, I personally love the microscope look better than the P64 or any DF grinder, it’s got a smaller footprint than the Philos which is a huge plus for me and way quieter too, you’re not supposed to but I threw in 36g of un roasted coffee at 600rpms and it didn’t stall but even if it did it has a function to rotate back and unlock itself before grinding again which should protect the motor.

Overall I’m very satisfied with it, the only other option for me would have been the Zerno but I didn’t want to wait 9 months and I love tinkering with espresso profiles and controlling everything on my Gaggiuino and Flair 58 so now that I got used to all the features there’s nothing else in the market like it.

I’d genuinely like to understand the health risks of drinking two Ultras per day. 

I have one in the morning around 9am, and a second after lunch around 2pm. They are always the sugar free ultras. I work out at the gym regularly (4-5 days per week) and track my food and macros, and drink about 3 liters of water per day. Last time I got a full blood test about 6 months ago there were no issues at all. I’ve been drinking 2 monster ultras a day for about a year now, but before I was drinking 1 per day for a year. I don’t use pre workout or drink coffee or anything else like that so this is my only caffeine consumption outside the occasional Coke Zero if I go out to a bar. I don’t drink alcohol. And I get 7-8 hours of sleep per night with good deep sleep according to my watch tracking app.

We live in the suburbs and he might take our son to the local coffee shop a few times a month when it's warm. He wants an ebike because he thinks it's cool basically.

Because of that I don't want to pay like $2000, more like $400-500 tops. Like I can afford more but it seems like a silly thing to spend money on. Is that a reasonable budget? 

The thing is he's got a hand-me-down bike from a 'bike person' so I think it's a nicer model then I'd probably get him today. Would it be better to convert it somehow? Also, we've got a Burley bike trailer that the boy uses, would he be able to use it with an ebike?

It’s my first time in Germany and Munich and I’ve been here for 8 days. I am from a podunk town in the rural southeastern part of the East Coast. Raised on a farm had cows yada yada. Parents never traveled. 

I feel like so many people told me before this trip how rude Germans were and while I’ve met many people here I’d call “brisk,” I haven’t encountered anyone rude. Like at all.

If you’re an American and you think people here are rude, it’s probably because you’re being an ass and expecting everything to be how it was at home. I will be honest… I speak little to NO German. I know my politeness and a handful of words and that’s about it. And I’ve been fine and found people appreciated I at least tried to speak it first… and some even found it cute when I struggled and they happily began speaking English without me even asking. 

Went to the Residenz by myself to see a Shakespeare play (I have my master’s in English so big nerd) and sat beside a lovely older gentleman who I chatted with the whole time during intermission and he even translated some of the directions the attendants were giving I didn’t understand. He was a widower and told me he used to come to the theater with his wife often because she loved it, but now he goes alone (I assume she passed). she was also an English major. It was a very wholesome time. 

Many local shop owners have struck up conversation with me after asking where I was from and they were very enjoyable to talk with.

He wishes it were him. He would change places in a second.”* 

* I want to share [this excellent point](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1j34lc9/comment/mfxrdfi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) by u/SuddenDragonfly8125:
   * *I really appreciate the recaps, but I had to stop reading when Hilaria says Alec has* ***survivor's guilt***.
   * *He fucking does not. He killed a woman. We know he didn't mean to, and we understand that would be incredible trauma to deal with, but it is not* ***survivor's guilt***. He did not ***survive*** *something that should have killed him and did kill others. He was the one who killed a person.*
   * *If I'd been watching this show, that would have made me quit watching. It's disgusting.*
   * *If they'd just say ""yeah, he killed someone because he trusted that the gun was safe and he fumbled it, or it went off and we're not sure how, and it was a terrible tragedy and he's still traumatized,"" I think most people would understand and probably be sympathetic. But rewriting it like the gun made Alec point it and made him pull the trigger, or whatever actually happened, acting like he had absolutely no agency in it whatsoever, that's terrible.*
   * *Honestly, the more they try to reframe this, the more suspicious I get about what actually happened. but we'll never know.*

**Alrighty! On with the recap:**

* This episode opens with a three-minute summary of the trial. First, we see the outside of their Hamptons house – lingering shots of empty swings as foreboding music plays.
* A series of title cards tell the story: “*On October 21****^(st)****, 2021, Alec Baldwin was in New Mexico filming a western movie called Rust. While rehearsing a scene with a prop gun, an accidental shooting occurred”* (note the use of the passive voice – it just occurred with no person involved).
* TLC show producers Alec and Híláríá yet again strategically use the 911 call made from the set of Rust where a crew member said, *“we have two people accidentally shot.”* Again, we see footage of the church at Bonanza Creek Ranch where Halyna was shot and the now familiar picture of Alec looking distraught. Halyna and Joel Souza are both pictured and named in footage from news reports about the “Alec Baldwin Movie Set Tragedy.”

[The way they use these mages try to make Alec a victim like Halyna and Joel is disgusting.](https://preview.redd.it/hzicu0zwhwne1.png?width=791&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d15922d2b1f247c7e62bbe84103295959aa29a6)

* Title card: “*The state of New Mexico filed involuntary manslaughter and other charges against Alec Baldwin. A jury has already convicted a crew member for manslaughter, now Alec Baldwin’s trial begins in the same courtroom.”*
* Cut to footage of Alec and Hillary arriving in court and a couch interview with Hillary where she traces her finger in the air to illustrate how she flew from New York to New Mexico for the trial that started on a Wednesday: *“I flew on Monday night and arrived in the early morning of Tuesday, and I was supposed to come back on a redeye on Wednesday night but I realized that I can’t leave. Alec needs me. He needs me for so many different things that I didn’t even think; just really, really vital emotional support.”*  It was pretty obvious she planned to be there the whole time, she was packed and ready for more than two days so I don’t get the narrative that everything was up in the air.

[Fake sleeping on a plane - mind you a nanny went with her and took this picture.](https://preview.redd.it/kbkuaqw1iwne1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=295d292295fc7d5f44321f1934a32a44f7fa6a40)

* Title card: “*On day three of the trial, the defense is made aware of evidence that was not provided to them. The defense files a motion to dismiss the case.”*
* Cut to footage of Alec and Hillary crying and embracing in court.
* Title card: *“Even though this case was dismissed, Alec still faces potential appeals as well as civil cases. He is prohibited from speaking about the case.”*
* Unsurprisingly, there was no mention of the big celebration after the dismissal (not “acquittal,” as they like to say on occasion) or the chartered flight back to New York or the champagne Alec fussed with before boarding the flight.

[Shiny leggingos make for a rilly great party.](https://preview.redd.it/ktad0fxeiwne1.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2cc2f7c9608eb2dfbc48f9b832b089b75f9a176)

* Instead, TLC takes viewers directly back to the Hamptons for Alec and Hillary to discuss the aftermath of the trial during a joint couch interview.
* Lest you think I’m being petty (I definitely can be) in talking about their appearance, let me note: this is a meticulously planned out show to rehab their individual and joint public personas. The way they dress is meant to convey something. For this moment, Alec looks exhausted, with red eyes and puffy under eye bags wearing shorts and a T-shirt with a rumpled casual blazer with the collar sticking up. Message = he’s exhausted, frazzled, too tired to care about anything in this moment. Hillary, on the other hand, decides that this is the moment to debut her little struggle buns with a tight black tank top to showcase the new breasts and ever-present diamond hoops with subtle make up. Message = she’s young, edgy, and cool, yo!

[Alec has been around forever; he knows how to use his image intentionally. Why does he let Faux Chiquita Banana do this?](https://preview.redd.it/8a0gretliwne1.png?width=812&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cc285621db4125c25f2e31c6458f4842181d330)

   * Producer: “*I want to know how you’re feeling physically, mentally right now.”*
   * Alec: (rubs his hands over his face as Hillary looks uncomfortable) *“I* (pause and smile) *how I’ve been feeling is I’m worried. I’m still worried. I am a faith-based person. I am. I’m Catholic. I prayed and prayed about this until I was gonna pass out* (cut to the distraught Alec picture after the shooting). *So, it’s hard for me to talk* *about how I’m feeling* (weird editing, feels like something was cut out) *but I’m very grateful to her* (nods at Hillary) *and I’m grateful to God* (no mention of his holy Saint Michael hankie) *to my friends and my family who helped support me.*” Cut to video of his brother and sister at the trial (no mention of the other two brothers and sister who were not there). *“We were really heavily impacted by this and it’s gonna take a long time…""*
   * Hillary: *“It’s gonna take time…”* Quiet piano notes end the scene.

**The Homecoming**

* We see a lingering shot of a gorgeous lighthouse. I’ll take heavy handed imagery for $400, Alex.
* Then we see Romeo in pjs barefoot outside and the caption reads *“One Day After the Trial.”*  We get a closeup of balloons with “welcome home” inside the house, as well as handwritten cards from the kids. A lightly Spanish-inflected voice says *“what are you gonna say to your parents when you see them at the door? Because this is the first time they ever left you.”* One of the boys says, *“wait, Sylvia, do you know what time they’re here?”* Sylvia replies *“any minute.”*
* In a voice over Hillary says: *“I have never been away from all of my kids for longer than going into the hospital and having a baby.”* Hmmmm, were you having a baby or having a baby handed to you fresh from the surrogate?
* Couch Hillary: *“When we had to go to New Mexico, I brought Carmen, and I brought the baby ‘cause they’re not in the day camp and then the baby just finished breast feeding.* (the new implants probably had a bit to do with that) *so my friend came and took care of them while I went and took care of Alec.”*
* We finally see Sylvia who gets a caption that says *“Sylvia, Godmother.”* So, a former nanny. She and the kids talk about what they did while Alec and Hillary were away. Sylvia touches Leo’s hair lovingly, and it was awesome to see him get affection and attention.
* A huge luxury van pulls up in the driveway and the kids are beyond excited. Hillary gets out of the vehicle carrying Ilaria and when Carmen got out wearing a black padded bra hanging out of a tight white tank top with tiny cut-off shorts, I was shook. Motion to have Sylvia raise Carmen, all in favor?  
* The boys run up to Hillary, but she doesn’t immediately hug anyone, she keeps looking behind her for Alec.
* Couch Hillary: *“What I’m feeling, I’m feeling gratitude, confusion, exhaustion”*
* We see Alec getting out of the van and in his couch interview he says: *“To come home to these kids, they’re so sweet, they’re so sweet, and I, I just was happy. This is my life now.”* Cut to him looking like he’s going to shake Raf’s hand, but Raf (holding the baby) goes in for a hug.

[This moment was so awkward and sad. ](https://preview.redd.it/nk1cp2ypkwne1.png?width=579&format=png&auto=webp&s=eda52e80a6407059cf2bf27d0cf212ffc8f76af1)

* Couch Alec: *“After everything we’ve been through, I said to myself, this perfect. This is what I’m doing, is raising my kids* (back to the homecoming: he picks up Marilú and just smiles at Romeo who is beaming) *I just feel like it’s such a privilege.”* It an undeserved privilege, to be sure.
* Leo gives Hillary a kiss on the cheek, and she does nothing to reciprocate, doesn’t even touch him. Maybe she was medicated? Finally she is filmed touching Romeo, but something was off, she seemed stiff and sluggish.

[Was this an envelope of cash?](https://preview.redd.it/qua33czvkwne1.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a3b5c8e6da6060ae6d594a4ec2883da45b7a5ef)

* There’s general chaos in the homecoming scene and in the midst of it, Raf asks Alec, *“wait, what was your reaction?’’* Alec is carrying suitcase and just keeps walking and says *“I cried. I cried.”* Carmen chimes in *“a lot.”*
* Couch Hillary remembers she’s pretend Spanish so the accent kicks in: *“As a parent you like to keep everybody together and especially going through hard things, even more, it’s like everybody huddle. Under my wings, you know?”*

[No one wants to be under those wings, Hilly.](https://preview.redd.it/myu9a2c1lwne1.png?width=430&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ff0c1b1623b0fcb239762011609996542ab8903)

* Cut to Romeo and Edu crying as they hug Hillary (no snark here: it was touching) but she’s just not connecting.

[What was happening here? ](https://preview.redd.it/wfzsqxx4lwne1.png?width=518&format=png&auto=webp&s=01d9bd8c13c6bb34f806abfde429e07fb7330ee4)

* Couch Hillary: *“I wrote, this is gonna sound so stupid, I wrote them all little letters, the ones that I left here, and I hid them and I told my friend where they were if something happened to us”* (makes a face and nods).

[Cosplaying a concerned person. ](https://preview.redd.it/we7uqap9lwne1.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=77ed10c368c2ecaeaad0c357d47574aaf317915c)

* Couch Bratz doll Hilz: “*This was not a win, this, like, this is just an awful thing that happened to* (pause) *y’know, to people. It had, there awful thing that happened”* (no typos there, just Hillary glitching as Rumpled PeePaw sits by glumly).
* Cut to Couch Hillary in perfect makeup. It appears the producers needed to conduct yet another interview to add this section because it hadn’t been said yet: *“The hardest thing about this is that a woman lost her life. A son lost his mom. Halyna didn’t get to go home, and That’s what makes everything so painful.”*  She delivers these words with no emotion, not a tear in sight, so they cut to her crying during the homecoming and Carmen comforting her.  In an absolutely wild move, these words are interspersed with video of the Baldwin kids running around thrilled to have their parents back from New Mexico as Andros Hutchins was learning to cope with not having his mother.
* Couch Hillary: *“We’re coming back to something totally new where we just get to make more choices than what we made before”*
* Couch Bratz Hillary goes full Spanish señorita mode: *“And now we ken try tuh remember how to leeeve again, and that ees a dream come true.”* Alec hangs his head, hopefully because he’s embarrassed.
* Couch PeePaw: *“Just the privilege and the gift to being able to, uh, come home y’know and be with them. The kids are happy, that’s all I care about. And just live one day a at time.”*
* I needed the commercial break that came at this point. Arby’s, Clinique, Dreams Resort, Subaru, Colgate Pronamel, The Minecraft Movie, and Bubbly Cleaning should be ashamed they purchased ad time.

**Back in the Hamptons**

* We get bucolic images of the Hamptons set to soft piano music. The caption reads *“Baldwin Residence, East Hampton.”*
* Apparently, no one sees the irony in this scene (or do they?): Couch Alec says: *“you need patience to raise children, you need a lot of patience to raise seven children. When you deal with what we’ve been dealing with, and have that on your plate, and have this sitting you’re like* (throws himself back dramatically in the couch) *I feel like I’m the with a big stone on top a big boulder.”* This is spliced with video of Alec getting in his car then driving 20 feet to the side of the house where Nanny Lizzy is wrangling three kids: Edu, Marilú, and Ila. Edu looks like he’s going to bolt, Lizzy has an unhappy Marilú firmly by the hand, and Ila is standing barefoot on the porch. The absolute donkey that is Alec Baldwin opens his driver side door, sits there and tells Lizzy, *“hand me that baby when you’re ready, and I’ll watch her.”* Edu has escaped, Lizzy has to let go of Marilú to grab Ila and pass her to Alec and GET OUT OF THE CAR, YOU LOUT.

[Useless and condescending is a terrible combination. ](https://preview.redd.it/8lby3l5flwne1.png?width=633&format=png&auto=webp&s=1618199e2c0d0843d0c0aed1cd0123f9921eff41)

* Couch Alec: *“It has had such a painful impact on our parenting ‘cause we just see more of everything*” (cut to Marilú nailing the situation and screaming *“Donkey Kong”* at Alec as he sits in the car with Ila on his lap) *and when the tank is almost empty, I mean every time we turn around there’s a transaction that costs something that we don’t have enough of, and that’s patience.”* Cut to more kids getting in the car, Alec having Lizzy take Ila out through the open car window, Romeo yelling from the back seat *“Mommy you drive!”* and Alec looking like he’s losing his shit.
* Outside the car, a simpering Hillary says, *“we know who’s the better driver, my kids have voted”* and Romeo is still yelling as Alec pinches the bridge of his nose.
* Couch Hilz: *“where do you go from a tragedy? I don’t know. I guess everybody gets to find their own way* (melancholy piano music plays as a terse Alec drives four kids and Hillary). *Pain is not something that any of us want to live with, so little by little, we start to move into a place where we can try to begin to heal.”*
* More gorgeous shots of the Hamptons – I guess if you need to heal it doesn’t hurt to do it surrounded by opulence.  

**One Week After the Trial**

* Hillary is shown cleaning something wet on the floor by shuffling on top of a paper towel followed by a shot of the dogs, so we may have just watched a barefoot pet pee clean up.
* Hillary is in a cropped hoodie to showcase her belly ring and she calls for the third parent “*Carmen, come!”* to do some cooking. Carmen appears in yet another tiny tank top/padded bra/tight shorts combo as Hillary talks about how hard it is to raise kids in the spotlight. As she features them on a reality TV show and on IG.
* We get a shot of a recipe written in Spanish (wait for it): *“Tortilla de Patatas.”* This is the recipe she prepared with her besties where she forgot the word for onion, and I’m perplexed. Why does she refer to a recipe after allegedly making this super simple dish since childhood? Also, why the confusion about the onions – her recipe clearly says 4 cebollas? Maybe the show editor is a pepino bc they’re actually making cake, noy tortilla. Heh.
* **Not just any cake, Hilz says** ***“we’re making grandma’s cake and a Lulu friendly cake.”*** **White Pilgrim Mayflower Grandma? Nonexistent Spanish grandma? Pretend Greek Yaya grandma? Jamaican Godmother Grandma? Grammy Carol?**
* Hilz drifts into her ridiculous accent (which none of her kids have, BTW) and says, *“guan day I will not be here and ju will haf to make eet!*
* Carmen shares that she had a dream where they were leaving the US and also returning to it. Child, your mother is an expert in this - she was born in the US and returned to it at 19!
* In response Hilz says, *“Ummm, ok. How are you feeling about everything?* (Carmen looks apprehensive) *like, you know, we went to New Mexico, now we’re here. Are you feeling…”*
* Carmen mumbles: *“Mom, not so loud, they boys are gonna hear you!”*  
* Hillary: (zero compassion) *“It’s ok they’re not here, Carmen, Carmen, they’re not listening”*
* Couch Hilz: *“With our kids during this, I think that there’s some that understood, y’know Carmen,* (cut to picture from New Mexico) *we chose to bring her to the trial in New Mexico because she’s the kind of person if she doesn’t see us her mind will go…”* Buuuut, you said it’s because she wasn’t in day camp?

[Taking these pictures was gross, putting them on TV to garner sympathy for Alec is foul.](https://preview.redd.it/e3emzrcolwne1.png?width=839&format=png&auto=webp&s=75cd89c9552c5b4a2d906afb7e80851afeb69d39)

* Couch Alec: “*If she wasn’t with us, she’d go crazy* (cut to second picture from New Mexico) *she’s young, she’s gonna be 11 in a month but she also very intellectually curious and seeking and if she was here with just them…”*
* Couch Hilz: *“I think she would have really like, she would…""*
* Couch Alec: *“She would have had horrible anxiety”*
* Couch Hillary: *“She’s very, very anxious.”*
* Back to baking convo, Hilz says: \*“but we were like really stressed out on our way like, leading up to it. Was it hard?”\*Carmen: *“yeah once I got there, I felt more calm but when I was here I was like, oh no…”*
* Hilz: *“What were you afraid about when you were here?”*
* Carmen: (incredulous) *“My dad was going to jail! That the boys wouldn’t see their papa again.”*  She pronounced this as paw-PAW.
* In a one-on-one interview in her pjs Carmen says: *“I was so scared, but my mom and I talk about everything… she can’t hide stuff from me, even if she tries, she can’t, it’s impossible, but she just make me feel better.”* Boundaries would make all these kids feel better.
* As they bake, Hillary explains to Carmen that she took her to NM because that would be the best thing for her.
* Couch Hilz: *“Rafa through Marilu we have in a certain routine they can bury themselves in”* (Rafa pronounced “Raw-fuh” and “Mary Lou”)  
* Romeo walks into the kitchen draped in the obnoxious “Los Baldwinitos” Spanish flag towel and I was surprised to see that Hilz does have some loose skin on her abdomen as she bends to put the cake in the oven. I stand corrected that she photoshopped her loose belly skin pix.

* **Couch fight! Regarding the kids Alec says,** ***“I think children, what I’m observing particularly from this experience, they hide their feelings. They learn to stuff their feelings ‘cause they think it’s not appropriate, or they’re afraid of those feelings, and even he…”***
   * **Couch Hilz:** ***“That’s such an inaccurate thing. I don’t think that’s at all true…”*** **(rolls her eyes)**
   * **Couch Alec:** ***“Well can I finish, before you go? Why don’t I finish then you can have the whole…***
   * **Couch Hilz:** ***“But don’t like, that’s not even a true thing, they’re so connected to their feelings”***
   * \*\*Couch Alec: “\*\****Well what I want, ok…”*** **Stops and rubs his face with his hand**  
   * **Couch Hilz: (product plug alert)** ***“I’m always watching them, this entire thing has been, there’s been no manual.”***
   * **Alec looks well and truly defeated but TLC gives him the last word:** ***“who knows what’s the right thing to do?”***

[Their toxic relationship in a nutshell.](https://preview.redd.it/cy07yfozlwne1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=397ea57dfdc6744dd71843cdc86ef9996445f324)

* They all eat dry cake, and we get five minutes of commercials.

**Alec & Hillary Make Ordering Food Performative and Weird**

* Hillary sets up the next bit: with so many kids (did you know they have 7?) it’s hard to find time to connect and talk and *“we also know that Alec loves a restaurant…Alec is such a New Yorker and what a New Yorker is, is we love a restaurant.”*  We who? *“He loves the experience and he loves the no mess.”* Please note she made a giant mess making her dry AF cakes and he didn’t bat an eye.
* They’re at Bird on a Roof in Montauk and I transcribe this a) bc misery loves company and b) bc this is them going all out to be cute/funny/charming and it goes over like a lead balloon
   * Alec: *“I’m gonna have the egg sandwich – you know what I’ll do?* (Hillary talks over him *“the egg sandwich is really good”)* *So they make it into an omelet with the cheddar and the pickled onions in there*?""
   * Server: ""*Yup.""*
   * Alec: (channeling Hillary’s English prowess) ""*How many eggs is in there?""*
   * Server: ""*Like three""*
   * Alec: (smiling charmingly) *T""hey put three eggs in there? I want a lot of eggs* (server laughs politely) *I’m gonna have that no bacon.""*
   * Hillary: (in the worst vocal fry/smol baby voice I have ever heard) ""*And you should add avocado""* (smiling and fanning herself coyly with the menu)
   * Alec: ""*You want a bite?* (Hillary grins and nods) *Ok we’re gonna add avocado.""*  
   * Hillary: ""*Cuz that was the other thing I like on the menu, I just don’t wanna get sleepy""* (I cannot convey to you how clever she thinks she’s being)
   * Alec (smiling at the server as Hillary grins maniacally) ""*We’re gonna add avocado, are you seeing how this works now? Are you getting this now?""* (sever chuckles uncomfortably)
   * Hillary: (beside herself with hilarity) ""*I’ll share some of my salad and you share some of your egg sandwich – and that’s called marriage!""*
   * Alec: ""*Oh, you’re gonna share some of your salad!""*

[Why does this terrible picture fascinate me? I can't look away. ](https://preview.redd.it/iwxtx3e4mwne1.png?width=851&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e08d26280de45ba23248775dddd4eac67e82698)

* Best TLC IG comments about this scene:
   * *She tries to sound like a Spanish mouse.*
   * *Baby voice is so very awful for all humans to listen to. And dogs.*
   * *Have a modicum of shame and humility.*
* They claim they haven’t had lunch alone in Montauk since before having kids. A butterfly lands on Alec, and they are thrilled because it’s magical good luck.
* The food is served, and it does not look tasty. Hillary declares they need to do a check in with one another and “put their own oxygen masks on.” She says that’s what she’s doing in her weekly therapy appointments and urges Alec to go. Then she says this is their family therapist. So, I’m not sure who goes to therapy but am on board with as many Baldwins as possible going.
* Alec: *“What are our challenges, do you think?”*
* Hillary: “*For me it’s my exercise routine and how I schedule my day. That structure works really well for somebody who has ADHD.”*  Those are coping mechanisms, not challenges.
* Hillary claims she was diagnosed with ADHD as a child and likens it to being tumbled in a wave and being *“spun around.”* Worst analogy ever.
* Alec chows down, Hillary eats nothing. She says to him: *“we’re very clever, we figured out ways to calm our nervous system and say* (FULL accent) *oh ju know wha’ iss cuz I like to have a clean house or I like to be een shape. We can say these things but ees it actually hurting us?”* Ma’am, what the hell?
* Alec responds that it is “his nature to be obsessive”, but he wants to change. Couch Hilz notes that asking for help was not modeled for Alec and men born in the 1950s mask their emotions, unlike her because she’s very in touch with her emotions. She asks him to go to weekly therapy. Suspenseful music plays but of course he agrees to go.
* He gives a boat analogy: they have been on a boat in stormy waters headed toward an iceberg and at the last minute they don’t crash but go around it.
* She says (with only one word in full accent): *“No! This is the analogy: we’re headed toward an iceberg, but the iceberg goes swish* (sinks) *and we cun-tee-nuu on”* Then she makes this face and forgive me if it induces nightmares:

[Oh. Em. Gee.](https://preview.redd.it/319uc55mmwne1.png?width=579&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cd95a400fb8a61320bfbeca002db65d3949b2ff)

* **Alec playfully declares he’s going back to school and learn Spanish. Hillary notes** ***“that’s not convenient for me because then I can’t talk about you, why don’t you pick up Swedish?’***
* Hillary Lynn busts out yet another spicy couch outfit complete with Caravaca cross because she's married to a Catholic so she has now decided she is cosplaying a Catholic Spanish woman.

[Hilz scheming how to casually playing the castanets here. ](https://preview.redd.it/63qbgzjumwne1.png?width=368&format=png&auto=webp&s=36baf90f9fc2f19fb6a0154c5c9d9b1b0e0803d8)

**Swimming with Implant Floaties**

* Alec swims and cleans the pool filter and narrates nonstop how he’s cleaning the pool filter and not on “Geffen’s yacht”. Hillary joins in with her compression bra under her bikini top. Why is the bewb job timing so odd?

[She's included in the inclusivity of women who get implants and pretend they did no such thing. ](https://preview.redd.it/6y1f1dacnwne1.png?width=324&format=png&auto=webp&s=6241d77fa89291c445eeaaa9a8a1c07679cc6d93)

* In her peek a boo top couch outfit she goes from full accent to zero accent and it’s insanity:
   * Spicy Salsa: *I say to ju somtimesss ju know wha…ju don hef to make eet bahd like that…*
   * Clam Chowda: *Am I supporting the OCD or am I supporting Alec?*

[That pillow isn't doing what you think it's doing, my guy.](https://preview.redd.it/r03f59irnwne1.png?width=540&format=png&auto=webp&s=af09bc417ea891aea1a6345aba582aa57ec67e73)

 **Saving Crows & Going to Therapy**

* As they drive to therapy, Hillary tells Alec she was on a run and found a wounded crow and she rescued it and took it to the vet. He replies she tried that with a seagull and the orthopedist (he forgets the word for veterinarian apparently) told them birds’ wings can’t heal from breaks. In a couch interview a producer asks about the crow and Hilz is like, it died, as she gulps ice water. May it rest in peace with the fictional Asian lady Hilz supposedly recused as well.
* Alec asks where they’re going and Hilz tells him they’re going to see Dr. Selton to check in on what they’ve been through bc, *“we want to make sure as we’re putting one foot in front of the other and that we’re steering our ship in the right direction.”* Alec should find his Saint Michael hankie and pray to be delivered from this dodo bird.
* Once they arrive, a UPS truck almost runs Alec over in the parking lot bc he’s moving stiffly and slowly but the driver does a friendly horn tap and calls out *“how are ya?”* Alec gives him a thumbs up.
* Alec shakes hands with the therapist and says, *“you’re dressed so nicely and I’m here to clean your pool”* (every pool cleaner I’ve ever seen looks better than this sloppy joe). Hillary explains in a couch interview that she’s tried to have Alec go to therapy many times over the course of their relationship, but it has been hard for him, so he has never stuck with it.
* The therapist asks if he could start, which is unusual but maybe this is how integrative therapy works. He says, *“one of the things I never really had a sense of was how challenging it is to be supporting each other through what has been a rough what almost three years.”*
* There’s an awkward moment when Alex gets distracted by his phone and he says he and Hilz should shut them off. Hillary says, “*it’s literally our children”* and Alec says *“but I don’t want Carmen to do that…”*  Boundaries, Zander. Find some.
* The therapist cuts in gently to say that usually the procedure is they all put their phones away and Alec gets pissy. He says when people interrupt him, he forgets what he was saying because of his trauma: *“I’m very traumatized by what happened.”*  Hillary has interrupted Alec and least 15 times in this episode alone. This is just his ugly personality.
* Dr. S nods and Hillary observes in a couch interview that Alec needs to be told it’s ok to talk about how he feels bc he keeps everything bottled up until he bursts. Dr. Hilly, Alec talks about how he feels incessantly in interviews, on his IG, on his podcast, and now on this show. She says: “*he’s very vulnerable and I’m afraid of what might come out.”*  But sharing on TLC - that feels safe and appropriate?
* Alec bloviates about how hard everything has been for him and as soon as Dr. Quiet tries to say something in response, Alec snaps *“let me just finish my train of thought.”* I mean the train is on a circular track going no fucking where but ok.
* In a couch interview, Alec explains that the trial has left him with an inability to focus and concentrate but *“that’s not me, that’s not me. I have a photographic memory. They’d hand me two-page monologues on 30 Rock that morning and I’d just memorize it. I just had that. I develop that ability and uhh, my memory is shot. I can’t remember anything anymore. It’s really scary.”*   Sooooo, he remembers Hilz telling him her grandma was from Spain?
* Back with Dr. Silencio, Alec is monologuing: *“For me the stress and the pressure of public life, at my age, that’s not good for my mental health.”* YOU ARE ON REALITY TV, ALEC.
* Hillary is sitting crisscross applesauce on the doctor’s couch and chirps, *“that’s where I really want to make sure that we’re being smart about where do we go from here.”* The therapist nods silently.
* Alec says, *“I think we owe our children the willingness and open mindedness to try something outside of New York.”* Clearly this has been edited but suddenly the conversation is about leaving New York?
* Dr. Pipe Down gets the green light to talk and I’m not sure how he’s keeping a straight face as he says: *“we know one of your prioritizations is removing yourself from the public eye a little* *bit and moving to an area you feel it would be lower stress interaction.”* THEY ARE ON REALITY TV, DR. S.
* Dr. S: *“Let’s ask her if she would like to go.”*

[She did not, in fact, want to go.](https://preview.redd.it/xi2e56h1owne1.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f007490e323c69e4307e07715f238f8fb92e346)

* Hilz: *“I remember when I first met you and something happened* (pretty sure he assaulted a photographer or was it when he was riding his bike against traffic and yelled at the police?) *and you did an interview and on the cover, it was like goodbye New York, I’m leaving, goodbye!""*
* Hillary couch interview: (English syntax has left the building) *“Alec has always wanted to run away when somethings bad happen and that’s normal.”*
* Back in therapy Hillary is on a roll, she’s telling Alec that his impulse to retreat isn’t what he really wants because he loves his career so much. She pokes him with a bony finger and says *“the action that we have to take is here* (pokes his chest) *and here* (pokes his head).""
* Alec: *“That's your opinion, that’s not a fact.”*  
* Hillary: *“There’s no facts there’s only opinions”* She is a Chihuahua on crack, my head is pounding listening her voice.
* Alec: *“I do not want to go back to the life I had. I don’t. I don’t care. I don’t want to go back.”* They're not going anywhere, but watching their dysfunction is equal parts interesting and nauseating.

I (23F) just recently was offered an admission to Tulane's graduate school and am looking to move with my 23M partner to the city! Firstly, I was wondering how much a 1 bed 1 bath apartment would go for and mainly in what parts of the cities do young couples live in? We're looking for something that is close to Tulane and also can access some good places to eat, coffee shops, and just local fun things.  Do people tend to use realtors and/or have to pay a broker's fee when looking to rent?   


I'm currently based in a city where there is a lot of public transport and was wondering how good is public transit in NOLA and would it be recommended to have a car? 

Lastly, my partner is in the job market for engineering/data scientists role and I wanted to ask how are job opportunities for these industry in NOLA and if you guys have any recommendations for places that are hiring.

1j85uyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1j85uyx/aita_for_wanting_out_of_this_relationship/,AITA for wanting out of this relationship?,"I feel like an absolute idiot coming to reddit for this kind of advice but i cant talk to anyone since he goes through my chats and all my friends would snitch on me anyways. To my luck he doesnt know english so this is my only outlet right now.

Or if he does find it at least this would end the relationship cuz right now i dont have the balls to do so. 

So, me (19FtM) and my partner (21FtM) (lets just call him Chris) have been dating a little over half a year. 

The beginning was beautiful, as usual—like a fucking fairytale, pink fog and everything. We met through a shared friend group about a year and a half ago, though I was in a relationship at the time. He also dated multiple people while we were still just friends.

We quickly became really close, for whatever reason—similar identities, shared interests, all that jazz. I started visiting his place regularly, along with a few of our other friends, and it became a habit for the whole group. My girlfriend at the time never tagged along; she preferred hanging out with the guy she later cheated on me with.

Eventually, I found out about the cheating, and we broke up. After that, I got even closer to Chris. I spent a lot of time at his place, and we developed a bond like we were brothers.

Not long after (by then, I had basically moved into his place since my mother kicked me out), he half-assedly confessed his feelings for me. At first, I was like ooh hell nahh I just got broken up with, humiliated, and now my best friend wants to fuck?? I kindly and very subtly rejected him. The whole conversation was one of those ""Bro, wouldn’t it be funny if we dated?"" type deals, so I assumed it was a joke and left it at that. For a while, it seemed like it really was just that—a joke.

Then I started dating around again. Partly because I wanted to forget my ex, partly because I enjoyed the freedom. During that time, Chris and I had a more serious talk about his feelings. I told him that maybe I felt something too, but I wouldn’t bet on it being serious. I’ve always had trouble distinguishing between platonic and romantic attraction, and our friendship was way too important to risk. Besides, I wasn’t mentally stable enough for anything long-term, and I knew he meant long-term.

I meant what I said. I am severely mentally ill (none of you are surprsied i bet) and aware that I can never maintain a fulfilling relationship. I didn’t want to hurt Chris, so I thought it was a bad idea. There was also another concern—one that might sound weird to some, but whatever. Chris identifies as a lesbian but uses a male name and refers to himself as a boy most of the time (but not always). He only likes and dates AFAB people. So I asked, ""How would this even work?"" I mean, yes, I am biologically female, but I pass as male 99% of the time, look masculine, live as a man, and will be on HRT soon. I didn’t think a lesbian would want that. So, we left the question open.

Then I got into a fucked-up almost-relationship with some random dude. It wasn’t serious—we lived far apart, met up maybe twice a month, had occasional sex, sent good morning texts, that sort of thing. He visited this place a few times (which I always asked Chris about beforehand, multiple times, only allowing it if he assured me it was 1000% fine). Sometimes, I spent weekends at his place. It was all over the place.

Then Chris confessed again. I didn’t know what to do. I thought we had already discussed why it wouldn’t work.

A night filled with too many emotions and too much alcohol led to him wanting to run away from the country—again. He threatens to do that every couple of months. I was drunk and desperate for the only person I thought I could fully trust at the time (which was, yes, Chris). He had me in a chokehold—figuratively. I saw my ex-best friend in him, the one person who had always been there for me, but also left. (im still coming to terms with losing that son of a bitch). I couldn’t afford to lose that comfort again. So, very drunk, I told him I loved him too, and we ended up together. Which, yes, i guess i loved him. And still lvoe him in a way. 

And yes, I cheated on that guy. I’m still not sure if we were even in an actual relationship, but I still feel sick to my stomach whenever I think about it. Even if he was toxic, I was never the type of mf to cheat.

Anyway, we got engaged two months into the relationship. Yeah, I know—way too sudden.

The beginning was fine, if you ignore the red flags. The fights.

Now, couples fight, right? Of course they do. But oh my god, this cannot be normal. Please tell me I’m not going insane or just being dramatic—this really isn’t how it’s supposed to go.

I’ll start with our first big fight.

So, my now-ex started calling Chris’ phone, telling him I wouldn’t be happy with him, that I will leave him anyways, that kind of shit. I had no idea this was happening. He also told Chris that I was secretly still dating him, which—how the fuck could I be? Since the day Chris and I got together, I hadn’t stepped foot outside the house without him by my side. I had also blocked my ex after a long, detailed breakup text.

Chris didn’t ask me about it. He kept it a secret for days. Then, when one of his siblings was over (of course), he decided to make a big fucking circus out of it.

He kept repeating, ""Is there something you wanna tell me?"" all day.

I was like, ""The fuck? No?""

Then he snapped—started yelling, calling me a disgusting snake, a bitch, saying I was still with my ex and should go back to sucking his dick. You know, the usual.

That was the first time I felt that weird tug in my gut—my best friend today.

He looked feral.

I knew he wasn’t going to hit me, but I was still scared. I grew up in a house where verbal abuse and screaming were the norm. In the midst of a panic attack, I begged him to believe me—I hadn’t spoken to my ex since the day we got together.

Chris eventually calmed down and gave me a half-assed apology. Then (allegedly) told my ex to fuck off.

After that, things seemed fine again. Honeymoon phase was cool. Sex was nice. But I just… stopped seeing my friends.

Chris never wanted to hang out with big groups anymore. Our friendgroup dissapeared. I don’t drink all the time, but I like to go out with the bros and get smashed on the weekend, y’know? Well, fuck that. He said I did stupid shit when I was drunk. So, I stopped drinking.

We stayed home. All the time.

I waved goodbye to my privacy and me-time too. The only time I could be alone was when I was taking a shit. Literally. Right now, as I’m writing this, I’m in the bathroom.

It got to the point where I couldn’t even visit my parents. One time, I went to see my dad for a day and a half. Right before I left, Chris got mad about something and threatened to kill himself (not to me directly). Then, while I was at my dad’s, he called me saying, ""Man, my shit was laced, I think I’m gonna die."" Then he stopped picking up my calls while I was crying my fucking eyes out.

When I rushed back, he was sitting on the bed. Completely fine.

I have more stories like this, but you get the idea.

When I tried visiting my friend 'Dave' —who will be a major character later on—it was worse. Dave is younger, plays in a band, and has been a good friend for years. He’s also completely straight. As far as he knows, I’m a cis man, so our bond is purely platonic.

But when I got home from visiting Dave and his band (it wasnt even anything like that, we met up for an evening and some drinks, then i slept at my cousins place who lived im the same city) Chris half-jokingly started theorizing about me secretly meeting my ex, cheating on him, and all that shit again. I reassured him, told him it was just Dave and his friends.

Months passed, and as the pink fog wore off, little things started to bug me.

Like how he was the only one allowed to be mad. If I, even for a second, showed the slightest hint of annoyance, I was told to calm the fuck down and to stop being a bitch to him. So I thought, Fine, I'll just turn my anger inward. I've been doing that all my life anyway. I'll just fuck off, I guess.

And so I did. My health got worse. Anxiety got worse. Stomach problems got worse- i have celiac disease and multiple health issues ehich are just, making me miserable by today. 

Then came the favors. He asked me to do everything. Not big things, just small, constant requests—Find my glasses, get me a cup of coffee, make me toast. But even if his glass was right next to him, I had to get up from across the room to hand it to him because, 'Oh, I didn’t see it.' And if I dared to refuse, even once, the passive-aggressive bullshit followed—I’ll never ask anyone for anything again, Fine, I’ll do it myself, I do everything alone anyway, None of you could do shit without me, I’ll just do everything then.

I didn’t care. I couldn’t be alone. He meant too much. I must be too lazy. This is normal.

Then more fights happened. Whenever something was wrong, he’d go completely silent, waiting for me to guess what the problem was. And when I didn’t do anything—because I didn’t know there was an issue to begin with—he’d snap. He’d scream, blame it all on me. And yeah, maybe it was my fault most of the time, but wasn’t there a better way to talk about it? Still, I’d apologize while having a breakdown, and we’d repeat the cycle every time we disagreed on something.

If I made a mistake, it was my fault.
If he made a mistake, it was also my fault.

But that was fine. I’d rather take the blame than tell him he was wrong and get yelled at again. Or make him mad. He wouldn’t hurt me, but he would yell. He’d give me the silent treatment. He’d lash out at everyone else in the household. He’d be passive-aggressive. And I just couldn’t deal with that.

And so this went on for months.

Now we’re here. The past four or five weeks of my life have been a battle with my own mind after a few particularly eye-opening fights and conversations.

First, there was THE Fight.

I was at my therapist's. I had promised to take Chris to a job interview afterward. But after my session, my therapist insisted on taking me to a thrift store because I had an interview the next day too and she knew i had absolutely no clothes. She wouldn’t take no for an answer. So, I got home late.

Chris snapped. Screamed at me.

At this point, I was just hollow. I sat there and took. Just let him say what he needed to say. And yeah, he was right—I fucked up. I should’ve been home, I promised. That was my fault. I apologized.

He kept going. I got overwhelmed, had a breakdown in the bathroom.

An hour later, he called me out like nothing had happened.

The Next Morning

He was acting weird. I was used to it, but still, I felt sick—like I had to be on my toes.

Then it hit.

He had gone through my phone and seen my messages with Dave. Dave has this way of talking—he calls everyone babe and baby. But he’s straight, he has a girlfriend, we’re just bros. Chris knows this. He’s known what my friendship with Dave is like for two years.

But now, suddenly, it’s a problem.

He starts going off—accusing me of cheating with Dave, saying I never change, saying he’s asked me so many times for so much and I’ve never tried to be better. He tells me he’s had enough and thanks me for these six months but he’s done.

I just sat there on our bed and said, Okay. If you’ll be happier, then okay.

Then he disappeared for a little while.

Our roommate, (lets just call her Peep for now) tried to talk to me. But what the fuck was I supposed to say? Anything I told her would just end up in Chris’s ear, and he’d find a way to use it against me.

After that, I was acting weird (understandably, I hope). I was jumpy. Out of it.
(Chris, apparently, doesn’t remember breaking up with me.)

The Weed

One day, we were supposed to go run errands in the city, but he got completely zooted out of his mind.

(Weed is another problem in our relationship. He’s an addict. I’ve tried to get him to cut back—he himself admitted it was a problem. He quit for a little while but relapsed and just… doesn’t care anymore.)

So I was like, Okay, I’ll just go alone.

I went into the city, got what I needed, and accidentally ran into some friends. They tagged along, and in exchange, I did too. It added maybe 30 minutes to my trip.

I called Chris before confirming I’d stay out longer, but he didn’t listen. He just started screaming at me through the phone, calling me names and shit. My friends heard all of it.

And for the first time, someone asked me, Is this an everyday thing?

I said, Yeah.

And they told me, Bro, this isn’t normal.

And I just sat there like, oh. 

Back to the Weed Thing

This part is my absolute favorite.

Like, BRO, I have a tendency towards addiction. I was addicted to harder shit before. I refuse to go through that again. And yeah i still drink sometimes, but barely. That’s it. I dont do drugs anymore. 

And this motherfucker gets mad at me when I refuse to smoke with him.

Like BRO.

We are broke. We barely have enough money to feed the damn dog (which, by the way, is somehow my fault too—even though he was the one who wanted the damn thing in the first place). We barely have enough to feed ourselves. But he’s out here burning our last pennies on weed and then blaming me for not wanting to participate?

I don’t like how weed makes me feel when I smoke a lot. Once in a while is fine, but it’s just not my thing.

And he gets mad.

Says I’m not fun anymore. Says he misses who I was—the person who was always down for stupid shit.

I was down for stupid shit because I didn’t care if I woke up the next day or not. That was one of the worst, darkest periods of my life. Of course I didn’t care.

Now I’m better.

And apparently, that’s boring.

Well, sorry for that, I guess.

If that helps, I think I’ll be slipping back into that spiral soon anyway.

The Queer Thing

And the way he—an undeniably queer person himself—just ignores my identity?

He knows how bad my dysphoria can get. He knows how much I’ve struggled, been in psychwards, had a severe ED, SH problem because of it, and he still calls me girl or princess or some other bullshit.

And when I get upset, I’m the one in the wrong.

Then he joked about calling me husband and how I’ll never be his husband. But I won’t be his wife either, because if he calls me wife, I’ll bitch about it.

And I was like, Bro, you knew who you were getting with when we started this. I told you—I will never be your girlfriend. I will never be anyone’s girlfriend.

And he just goes, Well, yeah, but you know who I am too. And I’m a lesbian.

So what? Should I just… un-trans myself for him?

What the fuck am I supposed to do?

Our shared therapist thinks he has BPD. She told me I need to leave him ASAP.

Most of our friends have expressed concern too. My mom says I should quit, because my dad did the same thing with her and she should've ran back then (yes, i know, i have severe daddy issues as well).

But i cant leave him just like that-i know hes not a bad person. I know theres good under that, hes broken as hell but not like this because he wants to be. But im tired and i know i wont be the one to fix him. 
But if i leave him? He will kill himself. Or worse, his family will come after me. 

So here’s where I’m at. I know relationships have ups and downs. I know people fight. But I feel like I’m walking on eggshells 24/7. I feel like I can’t have a life outside of him without it turning into a disaster. I feel like I can’t be upset about anything because it’ll just turn into a fight where I’m the villain no matter what.

I’ve always thought that love is supposed to make you feel safe, but I don’t feel safe. Not in a physical way—he’s never hit me, and I don’t think he ever would—but emotionally? Mentally? I feel trapped.
There was a time when this wholw thing felt like the best thing in my life. Where i was sure Chris was the one. And sometimes, that feeling resurfaces, if even for a few minutes, it's there enough to keep me hoping. And I don’t even know if I’m the one being unreasonable here. He doesnt know i want to break up. Hell, even im not sure if i want to. But he feels something is off and hes been more irritable and on my ass for everything since.

Upgraded from my 10+ year old Quickmill Vetrano V2B (original). I had installed the flow profiling module in 2022 when I rebuilt the E61 group. I had a bit of fun with it during that time, but I realized quickly that since I primarily drink milk-based drinks (lattes, cappuccino), that flow profiling really wasn't something that benefits me. I tend to find the one blend I really like (currently Tectonic Roasters Shift Blend, since 2020) and want the most consistent, repeatable, high quality extraction once I dial it in. Experimenting with different flow rates was an interesting experiment for me, but I'd just as often pull a shot that was slightly astringent, sour or bitter. And there was always this gap in quality between what I could pull on my V2B vs. what I could get in the better coffee shops in Los Angeles (Blue Bottle, Intelligentsia, as well as the smaller indie cafes).

After dialing in the grind (took about 5 sub-par shots as the setting was pretty different from the V2B), this thing has been a champ for the six days I've owned it. I even went to Tectonic Cafe early Saturday morning to specifically order one of their lattes (which I love) and drank it while driving home. Once I got home, I made my own (using their beans) and yep...while the taste wasn't identical, it was equally pleasing. I now feel like I'm achieving quality on par with my favorite cafes.

Hopefully this makes you all feel a little better about visiting friends and family. You are unlikely to bring them into new environments on your person. That means if you see one at your mom’s house, it was likely already there and not something you did (and the statistics agree that your mom likely has carpet beetles just like the rest of us).

I eat healthy and I am vegetarian. I know some veggies contribute to bloating, and that's okay. For context, I am a coffee drinker too.

I had open myo about 5 months ago now and had some GI tract problems after surgery, e.g., digestion took longer to return, I sort of changed from someone who goes to the toilet often to actually feeling constipated more often than what I'm comfortable with, and feeling bloated now feels worse than before because, when I am bloated, it feels like everything is impinging on my lower belly and as if my incision is sort of going to open. I also have the nasty apron belly too post op. :/ The subjective experience is that my stomach feels smaller (obviously it's not that but your guts do change positions following a surgery like this) post op, as if there's less space in there haha.

  
I resumed physical activity more properly recently and the pain and discomfort around the incision is definitely stronger compared to when I wasn't exercising. Obviously, I want to get back into shape and it's been long enough, so I'm accepting that the discomfort is normal since we're getting that bloodflow back into the area of the belly and all that. 

What feels pretty terrible lately is that my GI feels constantly inflamed. I'm incredibly bloated all the time, even after 14 hours of fasting, and it's not like I've changed anything in particular. I know physical exercise and my GI problems have nothing to do with each other, I'm just providing context. I honestly feel like a balloon, as if I've ingested something big and round and it sits in my belly (I'm 32F, 154cm, 48.5kg, so healthy weight). 

  
I wonder if there's others who relate to the above. Those of you prone to bloatness and IBS, are you taking any probiotics? Or what helps you not feel bloated? Did anything change for you after surgery?

  
Again, for context, my diet largely consists of fruit, veggies, oats, legumes, nuts, I'd have 2 coffees a day and 2-3 biscuits, nothing crazy, mostly healthy but with occasional treats. I like salads, I eat sandwiches, I cook, it's just a normal mostly healthy diet. I drink alcohol in moderation. 

  
Any tips, advice, shared experience, would be super valuable. I'm not sure what is wrong and what I should be doing and feeling bloated so much of the time just makes me feel heavy, circular, and self-conscious.

**Voice search optimization** is the process of optimizing your website so it ranks higher when users perform voice searches through devices like Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri, and Cortana. Unlike traditional typed searches, voice queries tend to be longer, more conversational, and question-based.

For example:

* Text search: **“best Italian restaurant NYC”**
* Voice search: **“Where is the best Italian restaurant near me?”**

Understanding these differences is key to successful **voice search optimization**.

# Why Is Voice Search Optimization Important?

# 1. Increased Usage of Voice Search

According to recent studies, over **50% of internet users** now use voice search daily. The rise of smart speakers and voice assistants is making it more popular than ever.

# 2. Mobile-First Indexing

With Google’s mobile-first indexing, **voice search optimization** helps businesses rank better on mobile devices, where most voice searches happen.

# 3. Competitive Advantage

Many websites are still not optimized for voice search. This means businesses that implement **voice search optimization** now can stay ahead of their competitors.

# 4. Better User Experience

Voice search is faster, hands-free, and provides direct answers, making it more convenient for users.

# How to Optimize for Voice Search

# 1. Focus on Conversational Keywords

People use **natural, conversational language** in voice searches. Instead of short, generic keywords, optimize for long-tail phrases that match how people speak.

# Example:

Instead of targeting **“best SEO strategies”**, optimize for **“What are the best SEO strategies for small businesses?”**

# 2. Use Question-Based Content

Most voice searches are questions, so include common queries related to your business.

* Use **“who, what, when, where, why, and how”** questions in your content.
* Create an **FAQ section** that directly answers user queries.

# 3. Optimize for Featured Snippets

Google often pulls voice search answers from **featured snippets**, also known as position zero.

* Write concise answers (40-60 words) to common questions.
* Structure content using bullet points and numbered lists.
* Use clear headings to improve readability.

# 4. Improve Website Loading Speed

Voice search users expect **quick answers**. A slow-loading site can hurt your chances of ranking in voice search results.

* Optimize images and compress files.
* Enable browser caching.
* Use a fast, mobile-friendly hosting service.

# 5. Optimize for Local Voice Search

Over **50% of voice searches** are for local businesses. To capture these users:

* Optimize for **“near me”** searches.
* Claim and update your **Google My Business profile**.
* Include your business name, address, and phone number (NAP) consistently across directories.

# 6. Use Schema Markup

Schema markup helps search engines understand your content better, increasing the chances of appearing in voice search results.

* Add **FAQ schema** to highlight important questions.
* Use **Local Business schema** for better visibility in local searches.

# 7. Ensure Mobile-Friendliness

Since most voice searches happen on mobile, your website must be **mobile-friendly**.

* Use a **responsive design**.
* Improve mobile navigation for easy access to information.

# 8. Create Engaging Audio Content

With the rise of smart speakers, **audio content** is becoming more important.

* Start a **podcast** related to your industry.
* Optimize audio content for search engines.

# The Future of Voice Search Optimization

# 1. AI and Machine Learning Will Play a Bigger Role

Google’s **BERT algorithm** and advancements in AI will make voice search more accurate and context-aware.

# 2. Multilingual Voice Search

More voice searches will happen in regional languages, so businesses should consider **multilingual SEO strategies**.

# 3. Voice Commerce (V-Commerce) Will Rise

More people will use voice search for shopping, making **voice search optimization** essential for e-commerce businesses.

# Final Thoughts

Voice search isn’t just the future—it’s happening right now. By implementing **voice search optimization**, businesses can improve their search rankings, attract more users, and stay ahead of the competition.

I still remember the sinking feeling. I had spent weeks—no, *months*—building my “brilliant” startup idea. Sleepless nights, coffee-fueled coding sessions, and the kind of excitement that makes you forget to eat. I was *so sure* this was going to be the next big thing.

Then launch day came… and nothing happened. 

No signups. 

No buzz. 

Not even *hate comments* (which honestly, would have been something).



I had done everything *except* the one thing that mattered most: **validation.**

Here’s the mistake I made (and the one I see so many entrepreneurs make):

* I assumed my idea was great because *I* loved it.
* I thought I “knew” my market without actually testing it.
* I spent months building when I should have spent **days validating.**

Fast forward to today, and my approach is completely different. I no longer spend months *guessing*. Now, before I invest real time or money, I do a quick reality check:

✅ Is there an actual *demand* for this?

✅ Are people already *spending money* on this problem?

✅ How much *competition* is out there?

✅ If I launched today, would I even *stand a chance*?

Instead of guessing, I’ve found ways to get this clarity in *minutes*—market size, competitor landscape, even a rough ROI estimate. And let me tell you, it has saved me from chasing *so many* bad ideas.

Curious—how do you personally validate your ideas? Do you rely on gut instinct, surveys, competitor research, or something else?

For those in the same boat, I’ve been working on a way to simplify this whole process. Here’s what I built: [IdeaLensAI](https://idealensai.com) (Not a sales pitch, just sharing my journey!). If you want to check it out, I’d love to hear what you think! 🚀",0,1741630605.0,SaaS,0,0.5,False

I dreamt I was visiting a place called Beechville, Ontario. I was with a group of people who were friends. There was a cafe or coffee shop that was owned by a guy of the friend group. It was unclear if it was in his house, but it felt like it was his home, maybe the cafe was a shop below his home? He made me a delicious iced coffee that I made specifics about. I recall seeing pistachio on the menu and wanted that. He made it for me for free. 

The buildings were of historical age and there were beaches and bodies of water everywhere. I could see it from an overpass bridge I was on. It was warm and sunny without a cloud in the sky. 

Everyone was so friendly, inviting and kind to me, like I was always a part of their friend group.  I felt so happy, I thought to myself “I need to move here, this is where I need to be. Life is peaceful and happy and it’s beautiful and everyone is so kind”.

One girl with very long dark brown wavy hair seemed familiar to me in the dream. Then I seemed to have had a memory that I met her at a festival or something a long time ago. I asked her if she had ever been to **my home province**. Her eyes widened and she said yes. Almost simultaneously we both said **“—— Park”**, a camp ground I used to go to as a teenager with all of my friends and peers to drink beer and smoke weed and party for May long weekend. A tradition in my hometown to celebrate the beginning of camping season. 

I said I remembered her being there but I didn’t know her and she was tripping out on acid and had lost her friends, so I stayed with her to take care of her and comfort her while my friends moved on. She exclaimed “oh my god! That was YOU! You stayed with me when my friends left me!” And hugged me and I hugged her back while we both smiled. 

We were teenagers of the same age in the memory of when we first met, but in the dream they all seemed younger than me, late 20s I would guess. I am late 30s. The entire dream was pleasant. 

——————-

I wasn’t running or hiding from someone or something as I most commonly dream about. Even if it isn’t a nightmare,  my dreams are usually anxiety ridden. 

I googled “Beechville, Ontario” to see if it is an actual town. It is, but it is spelled “Beachville” with an a. I looked at some photos on Google, and it does have historical, turn of the century type structures, but not surrounded by bodies of water like in my dream. 

I asked ChatGPT to interpret it, and that was pretty eye opening, then I gave it my personal situation and it enlightened me even more. 

I am curious of the thoughts of others? ",1,1741630510.0,DreamInterpretation,0,1.0,False
