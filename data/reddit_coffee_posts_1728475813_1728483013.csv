I helped, the I found out their Google storage is almost full. I told them they have 3 gallery apps on their phone and they should delete them and use the one that came with the phone. They said it would delete all their photos but it won't. They're being stubborn so I told them to go to the phone store and they'll tell you. 

We got into a whole argument because I was trying to help them out, I always feel the need to help and if I can't it feels weird to me. I was gonna tell them that all their photos are backed up so it's ok. Even the gallery app that came with the phone is connected to Google some how. When they try to click their other apps it shows ads before the photos. I never saw that before and it stressed me out so I stormed off. I really do want to help them so they don't have to purchase more Google storage but it looks like they might have to. I just want to have a good day today and it feels like it's already ruined and I want to break my coffee mug. ",1,1728482823.0,rant,0,1.0,False

Many of us have secretly wished for a home that can showcase an impressive chandelier... oops, i mean ""showcase an impressive home with a chandelier"".



There are tips to choosing a good lighting for our home or decoration place. Consider the below¬†when selecting a fixture that suits the proportions of your room and the style of your home.



# How to Pick the Diameter of Your Chandelier

When choosing a chandelier for most spaces, one general rule of thumb will give you a good guide on choosing a size:

*Width of room (in feet) + length of room (in feet) = diameter/width of chandelier (in inches).*



As an example, a 24-inch diameter chandelier would be appropriate¬†for a room size of 14 (width) by 10 (length) feet.

*14 (width of room in feet)¬†+ 10 (length of room in feet) = 24 diameter of chandelier (in inches)*



If your light will be centered on a seating area and not the entire room, use the approximate length and width dimensions of that area instead of the entire space. Another way to calculate this is to add the length the light will be from the two closest walls and then double it to get your approximate chandelier diameter in inches.



# How to Pick the Vertical Dimensions of Your Chandelier

Now that you have the width and diameter of the fixture, you‚Äôll want to choose the vertical dimensions of the fixture (not the height above the ground just yet, but the actual top-to-bottom size of the unit itself).



To choose the vertical dimension of a chandelier, the classic rule is to take the room height (in feet) and multiple it by 2.5 to 3 to get a good range (in inches) for the vertical proportions of the light.



So if your room has an 8-foot ceiling, this would mean your chandelier should be roughly 20 to 24 inches top to bottom. (8 feet x 2.5 = 20 feet; 8 feet x 3 = 24 feet. Convert to inches to get 20 to 24 inches.)



As for the height you hang the chandelier above the floor, you‚Äôll want to go at least 6 feet 6 inches so that nobody is likely to bump their head. A standard of 7 feet above the floor works for most spaces with a ceiling higher than 8 feet.



# Dining Room

A chandelier over a dining table has some special considerations.



First, it should be low enough to create an intimate atmosphere but still not in anyone‚Äôs way. Hanging it with the bottom 30 to 34 inches above the table is a good rule. The chandelier should not¬†extend wider than the table. The idea here is that¬†the lighting is NOT low enough that¬†someone would bump their head against. Lengthwise, a chandelier will ideally be one-half to two-thirds of the length of your table to create a nice balance of proportions.



# An Example Exercise With 7PM Lighting

Many choose¬†[7pm Lighting](https://brands.amazrock.com/product/7pm-w24-modern-contemporary-elegant-square-k9-crystal-chandelier-ceiling-light-fixture-lamp-lighting-16-led-lights-required-for-living-room-bedroom/)¬†K9 Crystal Chandelier when it comes to giving that special touch to their home. You might ask why.



Here are their considerations in terms of the quality features as listed below.

**Category**:¬†Chandelier

**Style**:¬†Modern

**Material**:¬†Polished chrome stainless steel canopy, top K9 clear crystal

**Dimension**:¬†Length 24‚Ä≥/ 60CM, Width 24‚Ä≥/ 60CM, Height 13‚Ä≥/ 33CM

**Light Source**:¬†GU10 x 16 Bulbs Required (Max 50W each, NOT Included). Works with¬†LED and halogen bulbs. Fully dimmable when used with dimmable bulbs and a compatible dimmer switch (not included).

A couple weeks ago, we adopted a lab mix (suspected labradane) puppy that is between 5-6 months old (his paperwork from the Southern rescue says one thing; the local rescue has him at a month older).

He‚Äôs a wild man, and we‚Äôre struggling with two main issues - him giving us signals for the bathroom, and him chewing us. 

I‚Äôm also wondering what an appropriate crate schedule is for his age. (I WFH, and he gets up (and out of the crate) with my husband and son at 6:30am, has breakfast, goes out in the yard, and then I take over at 7:30 so that my husband can finish getting ready and go to work.

At 8:05ish, he‚Äôs back in the crate so that my son can get ready and I can bring him to school at 8:20. I‚Äôm back by 8:30ish, and typically make my coffee, scoop the cat box, and by 9am, he‚Äôs back out and we‚Äôre out in the backyard for a bit. 

It‚Äôs between 9:30-2:30pm that I struggle. Sometimes he‚Äôs great and will lie down on the couch with me while I work (I just need my laptop for work). Other times he‚Äôs all over the place, chewing, chasing the cats, wanting in and out, etc. So sometimes he‚Äôs back in the crate for a bit, sometimes he‚Äôs not. 

He eats lunch at 12, and then I try to put him in the crate briefly (like ten mins) while I feed the cats. Then he‚Äôs back out, until 2:30 when I need to go get my son. We get back home and settle in and then I let him back out at 3:30. He eats dinner at 5pm, then is in the crate from 5:30-7:30, then out until bedtime for him at 10pm.

Am I doing too much? Too little? 

And how can I do better at training him to give us signals to go out?",1,1728482806.0,puppy101,1,1.0,False

1fzs4qx,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fzs4qx/deep_dive_into_starbucks_optimized_for_choice_not/,"Deep dive into Starbucks - Optimized for choice, not profit.","**1.0 Introduction**

Starbucks¬†isn't just a coffee chain; it's a place where your drink comes with a version of your name on the cup. While this small detail doesn‚Äôt change the quality of the product, it has a big impact on customers:

1. **Personalization**¬†- People naturally crave recognition, and this simple interaction taps into that need, making the experience feel more personal, even if it is just a name on a cap.
2. **Customer engagement**¬†- Calling out names for orders, often with humorous misspellings, creates a memorable experience that extends beyond the store. Countless social media posts about these misspellings have gone viral, and this kind of engagement works to Starbucks' advantage.

The customer-centric culture is what allowed the company to grow to almost 40,000 locations worldwide (\~18,000 in the U.S.).



**2.0 The struggle**

Starbucks is perceived as a company with a strong brand.

***But is that true?***

***What does it mean?***

***What does a strong brand bring to the table?***

A strong brand has¬†**pricing power**. It can charge premium prices and raise them in an inflationary environment,¬†**without experiencing a decline in the quantity of products (or services) sold.**

The revenue formula for a company of this kind is simple:

**Revenue**¬†=¬†**Quantity of products sold**¬†x¬†**Price.**

Over the last decade, there have been some inflationary times.

Based on Finance Buzz, Starbucks increased the prices of their products by 39%, the lowest among the chains included in the research. This is slightly above the inflation rate, so it can be argued that the company managed to fully pass the costs to the final customer.

However, the second part of the equation was the¬†**quantity.**¬†A company with strong pricing power should not experience a decline in the amount of products (or services) sold. Unfortunately, this isn‚Äôt true for Starbucks.

The company has experienced lower revenue for two quarters in a row compared to the same quarters in the prior year. Their comparable store sales have decreased, meaning they¬†**bring less revenue per store despite the price increase.**¬†**This isn‚Äôt a characteristic of a company with a¬†strong brand and pricing power.**

The CEO at the time, Laxman Narasimhan had a terrible CNBC appearance after the Q2 results. His explanation for the poor results was ‚Äú***We didn‚Äôt communicate the value we provide***‚Äù - Which I find ridiculous. I don‚Äôt think the reason for the poor results is a lack of communication.

But, it gets worse. In the quarterly, release, there was a section related to the strategic priorities. The one that caught me by surprise was¬†**‚ÄúBecome truly global‚Äù.**¬†What does this even mean? Isn‚Äôt a company with \~40,000 locations ‚Äúglobal‚Äù enough?



**3.0 The actual reasons for the struggle**

So, what is happening?¬†**Why is Starbucks struggling?**¬†While studying the company in depth, I‚Äôve identified the following 4 reasons:

1. **More is not always better**¬†- The menu continues to expand, offering more options and customizations. When the orders start shifting away from standard to customized, it leads to longer times to prepare a beverage. This leads to **fewer drinks** being prepared (and sold) per hour and **longer waiting times**. From a financial point of view, the cost per beverage goes up, and then it is passed on to the final customer. However, why should the customers pay more? What changed? For many, the waiting time increased. Ultimately, many customers (including loyal ones) decided that the current value for money offered by Starbucks wasn‚Äôt worth it, and looked for alternatives.
2. **China's competitive landscape**¬†- As the second-largest market, it decreased a 14% in the latest quarter. The local rivals have been undercutting Starbucks in price.
3. **Mobile app disappointment**¬†- Mobile orders account for roughly a third of Starbucks‚Äô U.S. orders. This leads to a lot of customers simultaneously waiting for their orders, with overwhelmed baristas trying to keep up with it. However, there is also another psychological aspect. The total waiting time comprises **order time** & **preparation time.** Most customers remember ‚Äúwaiting‚Äù as the time between¬†***placing the order and receiving the beverage***. With mobile apps, the order is done without having to wait in line and although the total waiting time is the same, the preparation time is longer. Reducing the order time isn‚Äôt a benefit that stands out.
4. **Worsening reputation**¬†- In 2021, employees started organizing and forming a labor union, motivated by concerns over workplace conditions, wages, unpredictable schedules, and overall job security. Starbucks has been accused of using aggressive tactics to prevent unionization, via anti-union messaging, store closures and firings, and even increased surveillance and intimidation. As of 2024, the company continues to face legal challenges from the NLRB (‚ÄúNational Labor Relations Board‚Äú) and ongoing unionization efforts.



**4.0 The solution (?)**

On August 13th, 2024, Starbucks announced that Brian Niccol has been appointed chairman and CEO of Starbucks, starting September 9th, 2024.

This is been seen as part of Elliott Management‚Äôs activist campaign.

**Brian Niccol is the 4th CEO of Starbucks in the last 3 years.**

The share price was up 24% on this announcement, which shows the market sentiment of this decision. Brian has been the CEO of Chipotle since 2018 and the CEO of Taco Bell before that. He has extensive experience in operations and is expected to bring new energy and ideas.

There will be plenty of similarities between his past roles and this one, especially focused on improving efficiency and cost-reduction, given his experience in digital improvement and online/mobile app ordering.

On September 10th, his 2nd official working day, he shared a letter to all partners, customers, and stakeholders with 4 key areas of focus:

1. **Empowering the baristas to take care of the customers**
2. **Get the morning right, every morning**¬†by delivering outstanding drinks and food, on time, every time.
3. **Reestablishing Starbucks as the community coffeehouse**¬†committing to elevate the in-store experience, ensuring the spaces reflect the sights, smells, and sounds that define Starbucks.
4. **Telling the Starbucks story**

In addition to this, he mentions that investments in technology are being made, to enhance the customer experience, improve the supply chain, and evolve the app and mobile ordering platform. His comment on China is that the company needs to¬†*understand the potential path to capture growth and capitalize on its strengths in this dynamic market.*

He‚Äôs also addressing that in some places, especially in the U.S. the menus can feel overwhelming, the product is inconsistent, the wait is too long and the handoff too hectic.

In my opinion, this short letter of 2 pages, does a great job of addressing all the key challenges the company is facing (as outlined above).

Finally, there‚Äôs someone who takes responsibility, points out exactly what is going wrong, and not only hints at what is coming next but has experience in doing this before. To me, it seems that¬†**Starbucks found the right person**.

This is also why if everything goes according to plan, he‚Äôs getting a compensation package above $100m.

But it is not going to be easy, nor fast. Changes of this kind will take time, especially given the size of the company. It would not be unreasonable to expect the first meaningful changes in 2-4 quarters.



**5.0 Valuation**

Given everything above, it doesn't come as a surprise that the company‚Äôs operating margin has decreased from 17% to 15% (over the last decade).

The company is still a cash machine bringing over $6 billion in cash from operations (with a limited Share-based compensation of \~$300m).

One of the key questions is - Given what is known today, how much is the company worth? I‚Äôll give Brian the benefit of the doubt, and assume that he can implement the best automation tools to help baristas, get the menu under control, and bring the operating profitability to \~19%, which is optimistic.

At the same time, I‚Äôll assume the growth will continue more or less at the same pace as the last few years but will be decelerating over time.

Based on my assumptions, the fair value of the company is $99b¬†**($88/share),**¬†slightly below today‚Äôs share price of $96.

Here‚Äôs how the valuation (per share) changes if you have different assumptions than mine regarding the revenue in 10 years & the operating margin:

|Revenue / Operating margin|15%|17%|19%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|79% ($65.3b)|$54|$65|$75|
|110% ($76.5b)|$63|$76|$88|
|126% ($82.4b)|$68|$81|$94|

Historically, Starbucks was always trading at a premium, as it was perceived as a company with strong brand and pricing power (hence, lower risk). I‚Äôd argue that right now, it doesn‚Äôt deserve that premium.

The market is already pricing a turnaround story.

I was at a point where I had lost everything‚Äîthe life I had, my friends, women, and my status. One of the reasons for this was my addiction to alcohol and drugs. The turning point was deciding to contact two great Dukes from the Goetia: Dantalion and Sallos (it‚Äôs a story for a different appreciation thread). 
They initiated my transformation, removing toxic people from my life and providing me with a solid foundation. They also uncovered key secrets that multiplied my problems, ultimately leading me to President Marbas.
At that time, I was trying to fight my addiction, but I was still weak, very emotional, and I would relapse every one or two weeks.


Then President Marbas appeared. I invoked him for the first time, and it felt like he had been waiting for me for a long time. I asked him that, in exchange for two months of sobriety, I would buy him a two bottles of whiskey. Since then, it has been almost 2 years, and I haven‚Äôt touched any substances‚Äînot even thought about them. The problem suddenly disappeared.

In the meantime, Marbas revealed that he is one of the closest spirits to me and that we get along very well together. 
President Marbas helped me appreciate my health. I no longer smoke cigarettes, drink coffee, and I make healthy choices. I‚Äôve started treating my health differently. Of course, Marbas also heals emotionally, he can heal unpleasant memories , traumas and I feel that a lot more.

After two years of working with Goetia, I have transformed from a drug addict who couldn‚Äôt handle anything, couldn‚Äôt control my emotions, and had lost everything, into a serious, strong, and trustworthy person. There is still much work ahead, but I am forever grateful to the beings who helped me on my journey. There are many of them, and I owe a lot to each one.
Together, with their support, all my troubles suddenly vanished, and I regained control of my life.


I promised the President that I would describe our shared story without going into details. I am endlessly grateful for his help, guidance, and patience.

Boomers and Silent Gens have a (well earned) reputation for constantly smoking cigarettes, but it's not like we were much different.  I swear all of Gen X men did at one point and most of the women as well.  I was exposed to second hand cigarette smoke from conception until about 15.  Obviously, that's when I started smoking.  I spent the 90s with a pack in my pocket.  First Lucky Strike unfiitereds, then Camel Wides (remember them?) and by the end Winston Light 100s (ew.)  

I think at this point just about every one of my Gen X friends has quit.  I can think of a couple who transitioned to vaping, which isn't great but it's an order of magnitude less bad.  [Yes, am aware of elementary and middle schoolers being lured in by cotton candy flavored nicotine vapes.  Capitalism is a real treat.]  It's pretty rare I see someone smoking an actual cigarette in public these days.  Dear lord do they STINK.  I know y'all remember when most public spaces more or less permanently smelled like cigarette smoke.  I'm nostalgic for the the 80s and 90s, but that's one facet I don't miss.  [To be fair to the 1990s, by the second half of the decade, most places were non smoking.]

Also when I started smoking, cigarettes were $1.50ish a pack.  When I quit they were $2.25.  I think I saw $10 for generics at the gas station last year.  I have no idea how anyone affords the habit.

We were in the same class in high school and we stayed together for 10 months. Those 10 months felt like the most beautiful period of my entire life until things started to go south and she dumped me through text saying she needs to study for med school. I was in the toughest spot I ever was in my entire life but eventually I moved on and started working on myself. We never once broke no contact during the year that we were apart from each other but one random day during this year she came up to me at school and asked me to go out with her to get a coffee. We were in april so almost the end on 12th grade. From that point on I understood what her intentions were and I agreed to start from scratch. After a while we got intimate again and we basically got back together. We spent the whole summer talking non-stop, all day every day until university started a little more than a week ago. Things got cold between us, we stopped talking as much and on thursday last week she randomly called me and said that she has been thinking for a while and that this relationship doesn‚Äôt work anymore. She also said that it‚Äôs not my fault, it‚Äôs hers and that she doesn‚Äôt love me anymore. She told me that she tried to make it work but this time there is no way of getting back together. She blocked me again on all of the platforms, except for my number. We were supposed to go to Milan at the end of this week, but now everything is gone. I feel a huge mix of confusion and heartbreak, but I also feel like she will be back for a third time.

1fzry24,https://www.reddit.com/r/enmeshedfamilies/comments/1fzry24/was_my_ex_enmeshed/,Was my ex enmeshed?,"I F28 have been with my ex M28 for a little over 2 years. He left me 2 months ago. 

During our relationship I didnt know I had borderline personality disorder due to my childhood trauma and I was very critical of him sometimes, would lash out, would get triggered and blame him etc. I was toxic and insecure for sure and right after the break up I started seeing somatic therapist to heal myself. 

My bf was caring and supportive, but also a real people pleaser, but also he was I believe enmeshed with his family. His dad was never emotionally present in his childhood and his mom and him to this day fight a lot becuase dad is very irresponsible.  During our relationship he still lived with his parents and siblings and I noticed that he helps them very much with all their problems and they all go to him for everything (from driving his sister around to listening to his mom complain about his dad, to dealing with laywers for some things etc). Basically he is very involved with his family and pretty much I would say surrogat husband to his mom and all her emotional needs. They are also poor and financially depend on him and he often told me he feels big responsibility and pressure to take care of his parents. I believe he had a lot of obligatory guilt towards them. His mom also wanted him to invest the money into their family home, which he told me he doesnt want becuase he will not be able to afford his one home one day due to that. I think she was very emotionally manipulative towards him from his stories.

Also, he goes shopping with his mom and sister, always asks for their opinion regarding what he bought if they are not physically there with him etc. His mom also buys him underwear, which I always thought was strange for his age.

 He was also arranging all his future plans according to his parents and I never felt like we were a team. For example in the future he was planning to buy his parents an apartment, but his parents didnt want to live in a smaller apartment so he would need to buy them a big apartment which he would be paying for the rest of his life and he never considered that such thing would also effect me if we got married one day. This is not to say i never wanted him to help his parents out, but all his decisions were based on his parents wants and needs (specifically his mother's) and he never talked to me about it.

However, even though he is super close with his family, he never introduced me to his parents. He met my parents and my extended family fairly quickly. He said that its not important for him and that his parents never asked to meet me. I did meet one of his sisters after a year and a half of dating after I practically insisted on it. He always told me that his parents never have people over that they feel pressure when someone is coming to their home etc. After I suggested to then meet his mother in a restaurant or cafe, he said that he doesnt see a point in three of us sitting for a coffee and talking. That was 2 years into dating. I always felt like his is trying to keep his love life fully separate from his family, and due to my wound of childhood neglect I often felt like there was no room for me in his family which made me resent his family very much. I felt like I wasnt a priority to him.  I would then have negative reactions to whenever he was doing something for his family in the end becuase I was so fed up. 


Also, i dont think he didnt introduce me to his family because of me, after we broke up he said he doesnt see anything wrong with not introducing me to his family and that he will not introduce his future gfs either for at least 2 years or more. Also I meet all his friends after a month or two of dating and I was very involved in his life in all other aspects aside from family.

He also rarely shared any family issues he was dealing with with me, when he was talking to his mother on the phone he would go to the other room etc.

He left me in the end, but now looking back I can clearly remember how I felt every time he excluded me from his family and there was no sign I would ever be apart of it. Before a break up I would sometimes mention how I think he is enmeshed and he would always get super defensive about it.

During our relationship he only twice cancelled his plans on me due to his mom's requests, and I often read stories when enmeshed sons do it way more often. But still I always felt not like a priority to his family and very much hidden as a separate part of his life from them.

This was both of us first long term relationship and I often wondered was I overreacting due to my own childhood wounds or was his behaviour very strange? Was he enmeshed?

My main complaint is that the coffee is just too ""strong"" or ""concentrated"". I want to be able to drink the espresso that comes out without adding water or milk. It **does** make a great cappucino, and usually if I add water, it's not too bad. I use medium to dark roasts, but always good beans, usually with ""modern"" flavor profiles (i.e., fruity, not just ""nutty/chocolatty""). This after coming to terms that light roasts are just not going to happen with the picopresso. After adding some water, there are some nice acidic/fruity notes (but bitters too). But I don't think diluting the coffee is expected?

  
But not matter what I variables I change and what beans I use, the coffee that comes out is not drinkable.

I mostly use the wacaco exagrind grinder and have pretty found the spot that gives the right timing (17-18 clicks gives me \~25-30 seconds for 1:2.5 ratio).

I've tried brew ratios from 1:2 to 1:3 with no noticeable difference.

I've tried with pre-infusion and without.

I've tried preheating until I need I can't touch the pico with my hands and need to put something on it to be able to pump. From my measurements, this leads to a max temp of \~92 degrees before starting to pump. Can't seem to get any hotter than that. Though I've tried at 88-90 C as well with no noticeable difference.

I've tried different tamping pressures. I use a WDT.

I started at 18g in, then went down to 17 and lately to 16g. No noticeable difference.

  
I'm posting this because I feel I've exhausted all of the variables and still haven't gotten a good cup. I started messing with turbo shots but so far am still getting the same result where the coffee just feels too strong and I can't enjoy it as espresso.

  
Anyone else go through this and find the way out?

I started wondering maybe I just don't like espresso but then went to a good specialty cafe and got lots of tastings (of the same beans I'm using) and they were really great. So it's not me :)",1,1728481991.0,picopresso,0,1.0,False

I purchased a house this summer since I got working visa approval and started the immigration process. I spent all my savings and supported from my parents. Most of my regular pay check is going to my mortgage.
Last month I joined a gay single chat group for people from my country and he added me when I put my location info in there.
He is a senior year student in a university about 80 mins from my city. At beginning I was worried by the age difference and really feel unreal about it. But he seems to have a great positive personality and he does looks cute makes me want to move forward.
So we met each other the following weekends then we started to date 3 times . He always comes in Friday and stay at my place until Sunday. He claimed he is unexperienced so it is just purely sleep together. In the Friday of 3rd weekend which is about a month since we know each other I asked if we can be couple at this point. He was thinking it was fasted but he then agreed that on the Saturday night without my another asking.
Since neither of us have a car he is taking uber to see me , which costs like 120 to 150 usd round way.  So I am paying the food and I want to make sure I pay more since I am working. 
We had a good experience in first weekend and i spent like 400 usd witb a 100usd gift.
then he asked me to purchased another 100 usd gift during the following week , i refused at first and he was mad at me. claim that i am doing something wrong.too calculated. so i just let it go but I told him i cannot gift him gift anymore without special moments.
then the second weekend he took the gift he wants since i already purchased and he demanded another 100usd gift in store. i purchased it. this is the last big gift i gave out. then we also spend like 400 usd for the weekend in food. he made choice on all restaurants
I told him that i am in tight of money so we need to cost down and i asked him to pay for drink. Then we never got a coffee or milk tea anymore lol.
since we study in same major, he asked me to help his homework during weekend. I am not familiar with his course but i have tried my best to help.

then we skipped a weekend due to i got a sick on that week.

In the third and last weekend, he stills choose the same price range restaurants which makes me very unhappy. then he is asking me to write his homework from starting. i was a Ta for a similar class so i know that he knows nothing about this class. so i am also not happy about it.

the home work he asked me to help is a lot. and i am not familiar with the programing language he is using.it takes me a lot of time to figure out and it makes me struggle. I also have a demanding job with overtime. I just want to relax on weekend . but he keeps bring the homework to me whenever we are free and keep asking to help for the same question that I told him i don't know. for some question he checked online and asked me why my answer is different than he found online. i feel i am not trusted

so after this weekend. i told him that i cannot help on homework anymore and i will go to refuse or ask him to pay if the weekend spent keeps hight.

he said that he understand and we can handle it . then he started to half ghost me with very limited communication. We had a 3 big communication, each time he is claiming i am doing wrong and don't care about him. I feel sad . At the last conversation yesterday. he claimed that he is providing young and cute so i need to provide money and help in life. I am not spending these enough and i am selfish and taking advantages.
he said he is embarrassed to introduce me to his friends. all small talk all sweet words he said was just try to make me happy.
It really hurts me as i feel that it is sad that he was not with me due to my person.
But i also want to know if i do take advantage of himÔºü

Support was great and they ended up shipping me the replacement parts for free as it's under warranty, but between those 2 incidents I'm out of a transport method for nearly 4 weeks. Not great. Ok rant over.......



New issue yesterday. My bike doesn't coast anymore. This happens on a few scenarios, but here's the most often scenario: 

Scenario 1: biking, pedaling as normal at level 1 or 2, the motor runs. Then it's either a downhill or I simply don't need to pedal anymore, I stopped pedaling to coast... 

Expectation: engine turns off, the bike coast, a.k.a. just kept rolling. 

Actual: the fuckin engine locks as if I'm squeezing the brake as hard as I can.

This frustrates me unbelievably bad. Yes, there's a workaround of just kept pedaling no matter what.... but that means on a downhill I have to either set the assist to zero, or else power off the bike completely! Or else it'll detect ""oh I don't need to assist now"" and lock the freakin wheel.

Secnario 2: stopping for a red light. I'm biking normally, maybe 20-25km, I see a red light. I need to stop.

Expectation: stop pedalling and slowly, gently squeeze the brakes to a gradual slow down until a complete stop.

Actual: I stop pedalling and even before I touch the brakes, the damn motor locks it up. I'm not stuck 30 ft before the red light, then pedal again a bit, then stop abruptly with the brakes to avoid the motor getting locked.

  
Oh, last detail: how to ""unlock"". I can't. The bike has to be a complete stop for just half a second before I can pedal again. If I tried to squeeze or pedal when it's locked, I can't. If I squeeze the whole time to prevent locking, it won't unlock until I let go the motor handle, then it'll unlock and I can pedal again.

I will try to reach out to support again, but honestly, I just want to vent and reach out here first. I don't even know where can I take the bike for service here in Ottawa, Canada.

I want you to never spend a day wondering again. I want you to wake up and know your worth every moment of every day. I want the worst of you to know I love it just as much as the best of you. 

I want to be your gray Wednesday and your riveting Friday. 

I want a lot, I guess. But at the end of the day. I don‚Äôt think I want your mundanes or your thrilling lifestyle.

We were in the same class in high school and we stayed together for 10 months. Those 10 months felt like the most beautiful period of my entire life until things started to go south and she dumped me through text saying she needs to study for med school. I was in the toughest spot I ever was in my entire life but eventually I moved on and started working on myself. We never once broke no contact during the year that we were apart from each other but one random day during this year she came up to me at school and asked me to go out with her to get a coffee. We were in april so almost the end on 12th grade. From that point on I understood what her intentions were and I agreed to start from scratch. After a while we got intimate again and we basically got back together. We spent the whole summer talking non-stop, all day every day until university started a little more than a week ago. Things got cold between us, we stopped talking as much and on thursday last week she randomly called me and said that she has been thinking for a while and that this relationship doesn‚Äôt work anymore. She also said that it‚Äôs not my fault, it‚Äôs hers and that she doesn‚Äôt love me anymore. She told me that she tried to make it work but this time there is no way of getting back together. She blocked me again on all of the platforms, except for my number. We were supposed to go to Milan at the end of this week, but now everything is gone. I feel a huge mix of confusion and heartbreak, but I also feel like she will be back for a third time.

He‚Äôs currently in hospice with Congestive Heart Failure, COPD, Metabolic acidosis, fatty liver and lactic acidosis. He doesn‚Äôt have much time left. He refuses to take medication, refuses to stop drinking coffee and smoking despite being advised vehemently to stop by medical professionals. He keeps having falls and ending up in the hospital because he doesn‚Äôt want to use an oxygen machine to sleep and falls asleep while high and standing up. I‚Äôve pleaded with him to just take his medication and  listen for once, he just cannot stand being told what to do.

I‚Äôm cruel, militant and parent-like in every interaction we have. We‚Äôve fought for years, and he used to physically attack me as well. I still help him, but I have so little patience that I can‚Äôt help but curse at him in casual conversation. I‚Äôm so exhausted by him. He was in the hospital last week yelling at me about how I was a burden my entire childhood and never did anything to help and was never useful. I just got up and left. He consistently faults me for things I did as a child, and degrades and belittles me but I always go back to help him. 

I just want to know how to let go and stop caring. He‚Äôs gonna die soon, but I literally cannot bring it in me to be nice or kind to him after everything he‚Äôs done and all he‚Äôs put me through.

‚ÄúPresents‚Äù Chapter 4

by c.w. cobblestone

&#x200B;

My mouth watered as I watched a woman take a bite of the hamburger she‚Äôd purchased from the bus terminal‚Äôs concession stand. With a sigh, I added hunger to my list of miseries. 

The last of the food I‚Äôd prepared for my long Greyhound journey had been devoured hours earlier, but I had no cash and didn‚Äôt dare use my debit card to buy a snack, since my wife didn‚Äôt like me spending money without permission unless it was an absolute emergency. So, I sat on a bench at the front of the station listening to my grumbling stomach, rising every few minutes to fill up with water from the drinking fountain.

I‚Äôd been cooling my heels for more than two hours after sending Elena a text letting her know I‚Äôd arrived in Aspen. Feeling totally alone and wondering why in the world I‚Äôd been summoned, I watched the crowd, which was mostly college kids lugging ski equipment, happy families, and grubby drifters. 

When people-watching became boring, I fumbled around in my gym bag for the paperback I‚Äôd brought. My spirits soared when my fingers found a candy bar that I‚Äôd forgotten about. Elena didn‚Äôt allow me to splurge on luxuries, especially food (since she was always on my ass about losing weight), but after our office Halloween party a few weeks earlier, I smuggled a Snickers bar home and threw it in my bag so she wouldn‚Äôt see it.

With a satisfied smile, I leaned back on the bench and savored the chocolate, relieved that something had finally gone my way. 

A familiar voice snapped me back to reality:

‚ÄúFIGURES YOU‚ÄôD BE STUFFING YOUR FAT FACE.‚Äù

My father-in-law‚Äôs rude greeting made me jump, and I almost dropped the candy bar. ‚ÄúUh, hey, Tom.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, there. Looks like you‚Äôve put on a few pounds ‚Äî you sure you need that Snickers bar?‚Äù

‚ÄúI ‚Ä¶ uh ‚Ä¶‚Äù

The older man snapped his fingers. ‚ÄúAll right, I ain‚Äôt got time for a bunch of bullshit. Grab your bag and let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

Tom had always been gruff with me, but he seemed to be treating me particularly discourteously. With a pounding heart, I followed him out of the bus station and hopped into his SUV‚Äôs passenger side.

My father-in-law twisted the ignition key and revved the motor. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre probably wondering why my daughter told you to come out here.‚Äù

I nodded.

Tom snorted. ‚ÄúWell, it sure as hell ain‚Äôt because she wanted to spend the holidays with you, that‚Äôs for sure.‚Äù He leered. ‚ÄúKurt‚Äôs something else, ain‚Äôt he? My daughter finally found a real man. They‚Äôre totally in love with each other. I knew it would happen sooner or later, since she never loved you ‚Äî but I didn‚Äôt figure you‚Äôd want to stay married to her. What the hell‚Äôs up with that?‚Äù

I hunched forward in the passenger‚Äôs seat. ‚ÄúUh, I dunno, Tom, I, uh ‚Ä¶ I just want her in my life.‚Äù

‚ÄúKurt says he has you sleeping in the garage?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, yeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd he makes you call him ‚Äòsir?‚Äô‚Äù

My ears burned. ‚ÄúY-yeah.‚Äù

Tom shook his head. ‚ÄúElena says he kicked the shit out of you. And then, you got on your knees with your nose all bleeding and begged her not to leave you.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know how to reply. My wife had clearly told her folks everything, and it was beyond mortifying hearing the events of that life-changing evening relayed back to me by someone who‚Äôd always made it clear that he didn‚Äôt think I was good enough for his daughter.

Tom put the SUV in drive and we rolled out of the bus station parking lot. ‚ÄúWell, you are one pathetic sonofabitch, that‚Äôs all I can say,‚Äù he mused. ‚ÄúI always knew you was a wimp ‚Ä¶ but, DAMN. You‚Äôre about a spineless motherfucker, you know that?‚Äù

I jammed my hands under my knees and said nothing.

‚ÄúWhat kind of man lets his wife have a boyfriend, and flaunt it right in front of his face?‚Äù 

Still unable to conjure up an answer, I shrugged.

‚ÄúWell, Elena is right ‚Äî you are a fat turd who needs to be taken advantage of, if you‚Äôre gonna put yourself in that position. Which brings me to why we needed you out here. We were planning on having Thanksgiving dinner in the cabin, but the damn water main burst the other day while we were out skiing, so we‚Äôve been staying in a motel. Kurt says he can fix the break with the tools he‚Äôs got in his truck ‚Äî because he‚Äôs not useless like you are ‚Äî but the pipe is about 15 feet underground, and it‚Äôs a motherfucker of a job to dig that deep. We can‚Äôt hire anyone to do it on short notice so close to the holiday, and Kurt doesn‚Äôt want to spend two days digging. So, Elena says you‚Äôd be glad to do it.‚Äù

My jaw dropped. ‚ÄúUh ‚Ä¶ you ‚Ä¶ she wants me to dig a hole?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, she sure as hell don‚Äôt want to share a drumstick with you and look into your eyes, does she? I think she‚Äôs found the love of her life, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù Tom chuckled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna be a bitch getting that hole dug before Thursday, but maybe it‚Äôll knock some weight off your ass.‚Äù

My father-in-law turned on the radio and blasted a Johnny Cash song, making it impossible to continue the conversation.

The song, ‚ÄúCry, Cry, Cry‚Äù reminded me of my early marriage to Elena:

&#x200B;

*Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down*

*I think you only live to see the lights of town*

*I wasted my time when I would try, try, try*

*When the lights have lost their glow you're gonna cry, cry, cry*

*I lie awake at night to wait till you come in*

*You stay a little while and then you're gone again*

*Every question that I ask I get a lie, lie, lie*

*For every lie you tell you're gonna cry, cry, cry*

&#x200B;

Listening to that song reminded me of the days when I‚Äôd sit at home alone sobbing, knowing my beloved wife was out fucking around on me, and thinking that eventually she‚Äôd see the error of her ways and do some crying of her own. But that was before I‚Äôd accepted that I was a beta, and had resigned myself to being Elena‚Äôs doormat so I could keep her in my life. In this new paradigm, Elena wasn‚Äôt doing me wrong ‚Äî she was taking what was rightfully hers. My job was to keep her happy, and do things like spend six hours on a Greyhound bus, and toil for two days digging a hole in the freezing cold so she could enjoy Thanksgiving dinner in her family cabin.

My mind was such a jumble as the SUV rumbled down the freeway, I totally forgot about my testicle situation. All I could think about was seeing my wife again when we arrived at the cabin.

Alas, it was not to be; when we pulled up to the sprawling rustic dwelling, Kurt was alone when he came outside to greet us.

‚ÄúWell, well, if it ain‚Äôt ol‚Äô Tubby McGoo,‚Äù my wife‚Äôs lover said with a smirk as I exited the SUV. ‚ÄúYou ready to do some digging, fat boy?‚Äù

‚ÄúY-yes, sir.‚Äù 

Tom grinned. ‚ÄúBoy, Kurt, you got this chubby bastard scared to death. His whole attitude changed as soon as you came out here.‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, Tubby‚Äôs not scared.‚Äù Kurt leaned forward and roughly tousled my hair, making me wince. ‚ÄúWe just got a little understanding between us ‚Äî ain‚Äôt that right, Rog?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù

Kurt patted my cheek. ‚ÄúAttaboy. Now, grab that shovel over there and follow me.‚Äù

As always, I obeyed, securing the tool he‚Äôd pointed to and trailing behind the two alpha males as they led me to a clearing in the back of the cabin.

Kurt drew an X in the snow with his boot. ‚ÄúRight there. I need a 15-foot hole dug; six feet wide all around.‚Äù He nodded at a nearby toolbox. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a tape measure in there. Once you get down below 12 feet, you need to go easy so you don‚Äôt damage the pipe.‚Äù

‚ÄúBe careful, too ‚Äî my great-grandfather laid that pipe with his own hands,‚Äù Tom warned.

I nodded. 

‚ÄúAcknowledge him when he speaks to you, fat-ass,‚Äù Kurt snapped.

‚ÄúY-yes, sir,‚Äù I said to my sneering father-in-law.

Kurt pointed to the X. ‚ÄúYou can get it done by Wednesday, but you‚Äôre gonna have to bust your ass. There‚Äôs some food in the cabin and coffee, which you‚Äôre gonna need. You‚Äôll need to space that food out, because that‚Äôs all you‚Äôre gonna get. Understand?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want at least half this job done by tomorrow morning. That‚Äôs seven-and-a-half feet. Let‚Äôs make it 8 feet. I‚Äôll come by at 9 or so to check, so you better have it done. You hear me, fat boy?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm, y-yes, sir.‚Äù

Tom chortled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll probably be out here till 4 in the morning to get that done, especially with that frozen ground. But there‚Äôs a lantern in the shed; there‚Äôs no reason you can‚Äôt keep digging in the dark. And the ground will get softer as you go down.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôll take some weight off his ass,‚Äù Kurt remarked with a sneer.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exactly what I said!‚Äù Tom clapped my wife‚Äôs lover on the back. ‚ÄúGreat minds think alike.‚Äù

Without another word my way, the two men strolled toward the front of the cabin chatting amicably.

There were tears in my eyes as I started pecking at the frozen ground with the shovel.  ",2,1728481021.0,cuck_femdom_tales,1,1.0,False

Any advice?,"I need some advice about the relationship with my boyfriend, we're together for 12 years now and we had our ups and downs.. the last 4 years are more down than up. We both gained a lot of weight and we're really struggling to lose it. We're confronted with a lot of stress from our work and it's also not that easy being full time working parents with 3 kids that need a lot of attention. 

In the last years there were a few times I wanted to break up. Because he's leaving me alone with the kids, he's lazy, always playing Xbox, not paying attention neither to me nor our kids. I'm pretty much exhausted from doing everything around the house alone. 

But I don't really see breaking up with him. I still love him and he was a great boyfriend a few years back.

So I thought, maybe the problem could be me. I'm very stressed lately and because of that not always nice to him. So I changed that. I try to stay positive and enthusiastic. Making him coffee everytime he wakes up, doing nice things for him just because I want to, you know, I put effort into the thing.. also I tried to encourage him to have a little bit of fun in the bedroom, suprise BJs in the middle of the day and things like that.. not to go in to detail.
At first I thought he would be enthusiastic about it but there is absolutely nothing coming back from him. Just nothing. He says he sees that I make an effort, he likes it. But that's all. 

So I was thinking, he might be needing more time to come around. 
But I'm losing hope and it's honestly really hard to stay positive if there's just nothing coming back from him. 

Do you have any advice how to stay positive I really want this to work, but it's very hard to be nice to him when he's not even paying attention to me in the slightest.",1,1728480996.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

So last year I got bit by a tick and had some skin issues after, and they come and go, I thought it was more exercise related as I cut down on intense training because life got a bit busy. I get rashes mainly in the creases of elbows and knees, neck, as well as swelling in my hands.

Also, over the past year I've done elimination diets for everything I can think of and also skin creams etc which i thought was just part of this allergy id developed. 

I ended up going for a blood test to check and they said I had several allergies that I had never ever had an issue with, and my immuglobulib E was high. Which is a natural histamine response but too much causes hives etc.

Fast forward, I just read that caffeine increases immuglobulin E. I realised that my caffeine intake peaked around that time (i was gifted a nice coffee machine) and probably never let off and just today I read that caffeine can spike immuglobulin E. Feels like it's adding up? 

I didn't drink caffeine this week and skin seems to have calmed down slightlt so I'm guessing I'm on the right path. However, got headaches like withdrawal and want some way to manage it while I do this trial period to reduce caffeine.


Feels like all of the elimination and stuff before my skin problem is invalid now (if it is caffeine)
 I eat pretty clean anyway and have some vitamins, teas etc and drink lots of water too, so need some advice about an approach to starting again and reducing immuglobulin E.

TLDR: 1) how do I reduce immuglobulin E and 2) any advice or motivation on starting an elimination diet or supplements that might help this

For the last 2 days our server response at go daddy had been very slow. Our company has 4 websites on an upgraded vps service and usually no issues. 

Loading our webpages and updating the pages could take up to 20-30 seconds from several different wifi connections, home, work, office, coffee shop, etc.

After about 48 hours I decided to call go daddy. I worked while waiting on hold for 20 minutes,

During the 20 second I had been describing my issue, the server issue seem to be fixed across all our sites.

When the customer calls in and the id and pin are used to verify the account, this is also a mechanism to check and resume network speed to this account.

**Humanities Answer**  
----

Surrounding a Blue World was a small invasion fleet of a battleship (Flagship), One Carrier, 10 Cruisers and 20 Frigates sent by the Thraxian Empire. The Space around the planet was quiet and peaceful. A Destroyed station is floating among a few smaller craft with the bodies of its inhabitants joining the planet's orbit. The Invasion Fleets arrival came with swift motion and easy victory over the planet's neighboring space. Most of the fleet's frigates were descended in the planet's Mesosphere, supporting the ground troops as they cut through the less advanced Dorothi forces. The World was mainly aquatic with many smaller islands littering its vast Oceans. The Dorothi Species lived beneath the waves with most species living about 60-200 feet underwater where the water was shallow and connected to islands. A few major domed cities are much deeper into the water, but little is known about their location and purpose.

A small fissure indicating a warp space jump would appear on the radar to the patrolling Thraxian Fighter wing. Leaving the warp space fissure would be a tiny Human Science Vessel. The Moment the Vessel dropped out of warp space, radar showed it deployed five very fast-moving Probes. Just as the Vessel was reported, it would immediately reenter warp space and jump.¬†

Humans' warp space capability was new but not surprising to the Thraxian Pilots and their admiralty. They knew Humans reverse-engineered a way to utilize Thraxian Warp Space technology but could only use it on what they called ‚ÄúScience Vessels.‚Äù The Fighter wing was dispatched immediately to deal with the probes. The wing successfully destroyed all five probes and reported back to the flagship ‚ÄúUnhindered.‚Äù

As the last fighter left the space where the Science Vessel jumped, three more Probes utilizing the Humanities' state-of-the-art Stealth Technology ceased moving. They positioned themselves in a triangle formation around the Thraxian fleet. While the Fleet focused on the logistics portion of their Dorothi Campaign they hadn‚Äôt realized they were being watched and compartmentalized into target sets.¬†

‚ÄúNew Warp space fissure detected Darkside of planet.‚Äù A Crewmen yelled out towards the Feathered Admiral. Just as the admiral turned to speak to the crewmen, another would speak in his place. ‚ÄúAnd another! .5 Light Seconds Right side of Cruiser Omega!...There‚Äôs multiple!‚Äù Murmuring turned to loud discussion as crew members nervously checked each others readings. ‚ÄúSir we are picking up over a 40 signatures! They aren‚Äôt Thraxian!‚Äù

The Admiral‚Äôs eyes widened. ‚Äú Comms Officer! Open Channels to all Thrax‚Äì‚Äù

The Fissure to the right of a patrolling cruiser was instantly replaced with the behemoth known was the TNS Armstrong. Its Massive Double Barreled Railguns were already set in position and fully charged. Its Many 155mm Caliber Ballistic Cannons were at different ship hardpoints of the cruiser.¬†

(Perspective of the TNS Armstrong)‚ÄúALL HANDS! FIRE AT WILL!‚Äù The Human in a sleek plated suit with a Admiralty rank inscribed into its left shoulder screamed out into the bridge. The yellow lights indicating the 50 Terran Fleet ships that jumped outside of the Dorothi world changed to green to show Weapons Free.¬†

The Entire Ship of the TNS Armstrong Shook with incredible force as her Railguns fired their prepared Tungsten projectiles at their intended targets. The Large Battleship of the Thraxian Fleet was instantly rendered immobile as 4 of the Armstrong‚Äôs Tungsten rods cut completely through its thick armor plating. 2 of the rods ripped through the side armored plating, travelled into and out of the Engineering bay of the Flagship and through the other end. The Same Rods impacted an escort cruiser and ruptured its Core, causing it to explode from the inside out, sprinkling Debris and pieces of its destroyed carcass into surrounding Fighter wings.

The Flagship of the Thraxian Fleet had its engines go cold. With its Shielding module destroyed from within, it was soon peppered by the many 155mm Cannons targeting its Hangars and weapons, ripping its armor plating apart as if it were punching holes through paper.

The Thraxian Empire‚Äôs admiral stood in absolute shock. His feathers flared a vibrant color of blue and green while he looked at the screen displaying the battle in the stars. With every fading moment he sees a Thraxian ship‚Äôs tracker turn off. He heard the screams and yells of his fellow Captains go silent into the darkness as His fleet was being efficiently and ruthlessly destroyed. Alarms and yelling filled the room around him as his staff drastically moved around to salvage a failing ship.

His Human Rival stood at the center of humanity's resolve. Both Bridges were in complete contrast. Where one was full of chaos, the other was calm and professional.The Admiral of the TNS Armstrong noticed a blinking green light in the comms section of his display. It indicated that his ship was currently being hailed. He accepted it and looked ahead.¬†

Infront of him in Holo was a shaken Bird like creature in full formal campaign attire. It attempted to maintain composure but his bioluminescence displayed his weakness.

The Thraxian Admiral spoke first: ‚Äú I am Admiral Kithrik Olanu Of the Thraxian Empire! You and your forces have directly interfered with and engaged a Thraxian Fleet currently undergoing Council Sanctioned occupancy operations! This will be reported to the Council and you will answer for your crimes against the Empire! What are your intentions?!‚Äù



The Human Admiral‚Äôs demeanor stayed the same. His eyes locked onto the Thraxian and then looked past him to a staff member awaiting orders. ‚ÄúJohnson‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

‚Äú Yes Sir?‚Äù

‚ÄúTarget the hostile flagships Bridge. Prepare the Sentinels.‚Äù The admiral spoke nonchalantly as if he had just ordered for a coffee. He completely ignored the Thraxian Admiral.

‚ÄúAy sir, Redirecting Railgun 1 and 2 to engage enemy hardened Bridge position. Amphibious Assault Ships moving into position.‚Äù The Staff member stood quietly while waiting for the hulking guns to shift into position and charge. ‚Äú Standing By sir.‚Äù

The Terran Admiral looked at his rival in his Holoform. The Thraxian‚Äôs bridge stood still watching the screen. The Staff had ceased their work when they heard the Terran Admiral's orders.

At this exact moment, they felt a sort of deep ancient fear‚Äîsomething that they hadn‚Äôt had to feel since they learned to conquer their planet‚Äôs food chain. It was so deep and unknown that some of the species felt sick.¬†

The Kortani members had their scaled skin secrete a slippery liquid ment to make them harder to grab.¬†

The Orik Members had their horns turn a deep red and began showing their sharp teeth uncontrollably. The admiral had his feathers colors begin to match their surroundings.

**‚ÄúFire‚Äù**¬†

The Comms Link was cut. The same familiar shake of the Armstrong was felt, and two Tungsten rods ripped their way into the heart of their intended target. The Thraxian‚Äôs body felt stiff and cold all at once. The Thraxian Admiral's body impacted the debris of the destroyed cruiser. It would splinter as if made of glass. His last view was the TNS Armstrong hovering valiantly over him.

Long time lurker just finishing up my manuscript and getting ready to set off on the quest. I am based in the UK but am wondering whether to query both UK and US agents. Please share any thoughts you have on that aspect too. I have pulled on my big girl knickers so please be ruthless! 



Dear \[Lovely Agent\],

I am seeking representation for Love, Focaccially, a contemporary romcom with recipes, complete at 95,000 words.  \[Personalisation\]



**Ingredients**

Take the celebrity romance of Curtis Sittenfeld‚Äôs *Romantic Comedy* and Mhairi McFarlane‚Äôs *Who‚Äôs That Girl*; add a dollop of the movie *Notting Hill*; stir through a generous serving of the Italian food and travel porn of Ali Rosen‚Äôs *Recipe for Second Chances* and leaven with the wit and sparkle of Emily Henry. You‚Äôll end up with a glamorous, feel-good tale about living with integrity and becoming the most extraordinary version of yourself, in life and in love. 

**Recipe**

Practical, self-reliant food photographer Francesca Edwards tries her hardest not to fall for her client, footballer-turned-food-writer Luca Danieli, since he is so obviously off the menu. He is, after all, ‚Äòstratospherically out of her league‚Äô not just because he has the curls of a Botticelli angel, eyes the colour of aged balsamic vinegar and an utterly disarming grin, but because he, together with superstar Italian actress Elisa Fiorentino, is one half of the celebrity couple known as #Lulisa. 

As they collaborate professionally and bond personally over their love of food, shared Italian heritage, and status as only children from homes broken by death and divorce, Francesca becomes increasingly puzzled by Luca‚Äôs relationship and irritated by his inappropriate flirting. When confronted, he admits that #Lulisa is a fauxmance faked for PR purposes.

With Luca‚Äôs secret revealed, Francesca and Luca embark on a clandestine relationship, though the deceit and subterfuge that underpins their romance is a recipe for disaster that sits badly with them both. As it becomes clear that Elisa won‚Äôt release Luca from their watertight contract, Francesca and Luca‚Äôs tale of sex, lies and tiramisu takes the reader from Notting Hill and the Cotswolds, via New Year‚Äôs Eve in Naples and a photoshoot on an olive farm in Sicily, to the Oscars red carpet. Francesca must develop the confidence to fight for the overt relationship she deserves, and people pleaser Luca has to to extricate himself from a ‚Äòrelationship‚Äô the whole world‚Äìincluding Elisa‚Äìis rooting for. 

This story is told mostly in close third person from Francesca‚Äôs perspective, though we dip into Luca‚Äôs thoughts from time to time. 

\[Bio ‚Äì half Italian, food writer and food photographer, lives in Notting Hill and the Cotswolds\]

Love Focaccially is fully standalone but has potential as the first in a series of foodie romcoms centred around the participants in Francesca‚Äôs ‚ÄòCookbook Club‚Äô. The next two novels will recount Elisa‚Äôs enemies to lovers/forced proximity romance with a bad boy English chef and best friend Jazz‚Äôs Cinderella love story with a French vineyard owner. 



I would also be delighted to supply recipes for some of the dishes described in the books. 



Many thanks for taking the time to read this. I enclose a synopsis and the completed manuscript is available in full or in part. I look forward to hearing from you.





Best regards 





FIRST THREE HUNDRED



‚ÄúChocolate on that?‚Äù



Jazz nudged Francesca. ‚ÄúGo on. Live dangerously. I dare you.‚Äù 



Francesca nodded to the barista, gave her friend‚Äôs shoulder a playful thump, then took the lattes over to their favourite window table. Jazz brought over the almond croissants, set them down and pulled out a chair. 

Francesca remained standing, eyeing the table. She shifted the sugar lumps a few centimetres, brought the jam jar of marigolds closer to the coffee cups, broke the end off a croissant and scattered a few aesthetic crumbs onto the marble tabletop. If she caught it right, the soft morning light would bring a silvery gleam to the ornate teaspoons and highlight the chocolate-dusted fern etched into the foam. She shuffled to the left to crop out the recycling bin outside the window. There. Angling her phone just so, she held her breath and took the photo. 



It was always intriguing how a simple change of position‚Äìa slight shift in perspective‚Äìcould transform a picture. How light and composition could focus attention on certain details. Or conceal. They said the camera never lied. Maybe not, but it could be economical with the truth. 



She sat down, to catch Jazz exchanging eye rolls with the woman at the next table, who was watching Francesca while fishing a crayon out of her toddler‚Äôs mouth.



Jazz nodded at her coffee. ‚ÄúAny chance of me drinking this?‚Äù 



 ‚ÄúS‚ÄôOK, I‚Äôm done. It‚Äôs all yours.‚Äù 



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too kind.‚Äù



Francesca peered at her phone and started poking the screen. 



‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get frown lines.‚Äù Jazz grabbed the broken bit of croissant and munched while she watched. ‚ÄúAnd your drink‚Äôs getting cold.‚Äù 



‚ÄúHuh. Occupational hazard. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I had a hot cup of coffee.‚Äù



After Francesca had tapped her screen some more, created an Instagram story and given her 18,247 Instagram followers their daily fix, she sipped her lukewarm coffee with its sadly collapsed foam.

1fzr61o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fzr61o,Shot channeling / spraying help [Bambino Plus / DF54],"Hi all!
Been using a bottomless portafilter for a bit and have some channeling (I believe the term is...) issues
Setup is Bambino Plus, DF54 grinder.
Workflow is typically to grind 18g, pour into portafilter, WDT, lightly tamp to start compressing, then usually fully tamp after removing funnel and using leveller.
What could be going wrong? Coffee tastes good so l presume grind size isn't the main issue,  I think
 puck prep might be.
I suspect that the tamping tool or distributor aren't working as well as they should.
What other tools should I be using? Is there anything to help me tamp straight? I have a silicon mat with an imprint but it works better for the stock portafilter.
I do notice the tamp is SLIGHTLY smaller than the portafilters so sometimes one side is a bit higher. I think this is stock tamper with both portafilters.

the day played out like this:

we were slammed. first customer ordered a traveller. traveller is brewing. a second customer orders a coffee from the vertica, but it's in one of the 3 hoppers traveller the coffee was brewing in, so I wait as it continues on. girl tells me not to forget to make customer coffees, to which I approached them and asked if it was possible to swap hoppers while it was brewing, as I've never done this nor seen anyone perform before. there was no answer. they kept their back to me silently and I sat there for a few seconds. assuming I just wait out the traveller to get their coffee, I turned away eventually to resume my work elsewhere as I knew I couldn't just sit in place and do nothing while I waited for a response I wasn't going to get.

one of the ssv clock in and while they're looking at their schedule, ask me how I am. I don't remember my words verbatim but I remember it being a brief interaction.

i said something along the lines of, ""people think they know what they know,"" which wasn't a direct attack on anyone, nor said out of anger. it was an empty statement mindlessly said out of the frustration of that moment.

apparently the girl thought it was explicitly about her, took it to heart, and made a complaint. which, if you could hear me, why not help me? I asked for help on a situation, was ignored, and THAT'S what you caught in the end?

the day itself was shitty, not her specifically. glad to know anything I can say for myself will be taken as a direct attack though. /s.

that day was so nothing that I forgot it even existed until my SM brought it up to me.

to the person or people who know who I am: hi. I don't want trouble. it was a bad day for everyone. I'm tired of being surrounded by negative minded people and just want to transfer already to the store I've been temporarily relocated to. I love it there and I love the coworkers already. the store I main is so uninviting and unkind, actively shittalk anyone and everyone, including the SM themselves. stop taking my vague soliloquy to heart. all I want to do ever is make friends, not enemies. everyone at this store is so biased and cliquey. if you're not already on the ""in"" with anyone, you're an outcast. I'm honestly infuriated that they aren't socially welcoming toward me and it feels too easy to make a wrong move around them. please, for the sake of us all, just let me transfer. I know you ""have to hire 10 people"" before you can, but that environment is so unhealthy emotionally and mentally and I don't feel like I can perform my best in a space where everyone is standoffish.

1fzr138,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1fzr138/should_just_kms_now_right/,should  just kms now right,"I stayed up until 2a.m in tears with auditory hallucinations .. my kids father (BD) woke up at 7:00 , shook me and told me to get up and get the oldest up and ready for school 
i mistakenly drifted back to sleep , i wake up to screaming and i jump out of bed ‚Ä¶ My BD is saying he only has 20 minutes to get our son to school and im up looking for clothes . He yells ‚Äú what‚Äôs the point go back to bed ‚Äú 
so i grab the lunch box i luckily packed last night and hug my oldest and shamefully walk to my room with hopes of climbing back in bed 

there waits my 5 month old who needs a bottle & my 4 year old has climbed into my bed right in my spot where it was nice and warm ‚Ä¶

This is typical i didn‚Äôt get him up , i‚Äôll set an alarm wake up earlier tomorrow so he doesn‚Äôt even have to wake me up this time ‚Ä¶ 

but why am i sad that he got to wake up and take a 30 minute shower ‚Ä¶ i never get to wake up and start my day with a shower anymore .. i get one maybe when he‚Äôs home from work,  settled in had dinner & the kids are sleeping ‚Ä¶  im sad over someone having time to shower 

I shouldn‚Äôt have to be told to wake up
I shouldn‚Äôt have to remember the last time i ate or bathed 

My 5 month old is cooing and needing attention & my toddler is snoring his little heart out ‚Ä¶ i‚Äôll get up and make coffee and clean up messes that were made lastnight .. 

I‚Äôm a failure , and asking for help feels worse then it use too .. 
I‚Äôve been diagnosed with MDD for 2 years .. it‚Äôs gotten lazy but it‚Äôs getting where i‚Äôm having to plan weeks ahead to get out for two hours .. & coupled with other disorders i‚Äôm shameful to have ‚Ä¶ at 26 is it sad to just miss my mom , she moved 2 hours away and i miss her so much .. im sorry i wasn‚Äôt better mentally as a child or teen and im failing adult hood too..

1fzqz8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWW/comments/1fzqz8y/why_dues/,Why dues?,"So, this began in another thread, but, unfortunately, a bitter ex-member decided to block me thereby cutting off my ability to reply to u/thinkbetterofu who, I think, raised some good questions about dues. Anyway, I *do* think it's good to talk about dues, and why we collect them, so I'm going to reply to that post here:

>if the whole thing is all volunteers, why does the lowest tier of membership require money?

The ""whole thing"" isn't volunteers, just mostly, and even volunteers need to be reimbursed for costs. On top of that, trainings, financial management, strike funds, space costs (for meetings, events, trainings, etc.), getting people to organizing summits and convention, and various incidentals all cost money. Personally, I think it's great to be able to offer the workers who are actually organizing little things like reimbursement for coffees if they want to have a one-on-one meeting with a coworker at a coffee shop or have doughnuts for a committee meeting. My branch also pays small honorariums for various tasks (e.g. $11 to whoever acts as recording secretary at our monthly meeting), meaning that, each month, a broke member who steps up can have the cost of their dues covered. If folks in your branch are struggling, I suggest doing something like this!

Anyway, if you're paying the lowest tier of dues ($11/month) *it's not hard to spend more than that each month if you're actually organizing in your workplace*. And, if you're not actually organizing, I don't think $11 is too much to ask as a contribution as an advance on the costs you'll incur once you are actually organizing. And if you're never going to organize in your workplace? Well.

>add an extra pay what you want tier above the ~30 tier, and then offer a free tier.

>the org is supposed to appeal to the poor and literally unemployed, right? in that sense it is probably fairly unique versus other unions. the unemployed/underemployed and underfunded are a huge demographic.

Dues keep the organization honest. If only better off members pay dues, then, suddenly the union is beholden to the better off members. Not ideal.

There's a great article about dues and democracy here: https://organizing.work/2018/08/only-one-democratic-funding/

>the org needs reach more than anything, and it can't get to the numbers it needs if it paywalls, i think.

The ""reach"" the IWW needs is *in workplaces*. I think we're working on this by expanding trainings and working to move people from being paper members to being workplace organizers. If anything ""reach"" is, in a sense, part of the IWW's *problem*. We have lots of online signups who are attracted to the IWW brand and history, but who have no interest in having one-on-one meetings with coworkers and in building workplace committees. We need less reach ""ideologically"" (in the pejorative sense of the word) and more reach in terms of people brave enough to say, ""Hey, can I grab you a coffee after our shift? I'd really like to talk more about [workplace issue].""",5,1728479266.0,IWW,1,0.86,False

1fzqydt,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1fzqydt/psa_you_can_do_everything_right_and_some_babies/,PSA: you can do everything ‚Äúright‚Äù and some babies are still crappy sleepers.,"I‚Äôm writing this as my one year old sleeps on me. 

My PPA manifested in an absolute obsession with sleep. I read every article, several books, spent hours on the sleep train subreddit, and followed all of the ‚Äúexpert‚Äù advice.

I started sleepy but awake at 2 months and baby was doing great! Eventually, I was able to put her down awake and she would go to sleep!

Cue four month sleep regression. Everything fell apart, but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to let her cry it out, so I spent months tending to her every hour throughout the night. Eventually, I realized it just wasn‚Äôt sustainable, so I agreed to do a ‚Äúgentle‚Äù sleep training. We did the chair method and after about two weeks of being consistent, night wakes dramatically improved!

But then separation anxiety started, and baby would wail every night before bed, so we stopped letting her cry.

Over and over again, we went through some form of improvement and then an absolute miserable spiral. 

What I‚Äôve come to learn is that some babies do not get with the program. All of my friends have babies who sleep from 7-6 or even 7-7 and have had to do very little to make that happen. 

I also know that there might be people who comment on this post saying that they struggled until they tried a, b, or c.

But I am finally at the point where I understand that parents of good, or even average sleepers will NEVER get it. They‚Äôll  think babies who aren‚Äôt sleeping well by one or two must not have consistent routines, wake windows must be off, or that there is something the parents of the crappy sleeper have not tried. 

That‚Äôs fine. Parents of truly crappy sleepers, just know, I see you, and I am also drinking way too much coffee.",25,1728479197.0,NewParents,9,0.96,False
1fzqy46,https://i.redd.it/65qnmxk0cqtd1.png,Brody and sean :),"Bro, I wrote something really short, imagining this scene...       "" A few miles away was an old gas station that I knew inside and out. I didn't know it in the best way, but the hot dogs from that time still filled my mouth with flavor. It was where an old friend helped my brother and I escape from Hank Stamper, the owner and proprietor of the convenience store. Parking in the space, I noticed that the road was still the same as it had been fifteen years ago. Empty, where the only thing that fell and passed over its pavement were the orange autumn leaves. A truck was also leaving after refilling its gas tank. And it wasn't just the same store and the same gas station, I noticed three more tables outside, a bathroom being cleaned, which indicated that there was someone else working there besides the owners themselves.

Getting out of the car and grabbing only what I would really need to stay there for a few hours, I noticed a family eating lunch at the table, they seemed happy, which gave me a slight feeling of nostalgia. Watching them, I saw myself, my brother and my father, having a snack, having fun and laughing lightly when one threw a bread crumb at the other. My father making the Chock-On Crips a funny mustache, making my brother choke on his soda, laughing, wanting it to never end. I gave a small, sweet smile remembering the old times.

Heading towards the store, I greeted the family by waving my hand, saying good morning.

""Hello, kid. I'm coming to fill up? The last truck driver didn't even leave gas for my poor car..."" the man lamented. ""I'm Ray... these are my boys.""

""Hello,"" the two boys replied.

""Hello. Actually, I'm going to be on the road for a few hours, a long time."" I replied, showing that I was certainly tired.

""I understand."" Well, this isn't the best place to relax after several hours on the road...

‚Äî yeah...‚Äî answered one of the boys, showing some tiredness.

‚Äî and also, if you like coffee...don't drink the coffee from here. Whoever makes this coffee must always be in a bad mood...‚Äî said Ray, pushing the cup of coffee away, throwing it away.‚Äî well, I don't want to waste your time.

‚Äî it's okay...‚Äî I answered, finding what he said about the coffee somewhat funny... ""if you like coffee...don't drink the coffee from here"" that made me feel nostalgic, because someone I knew had said the same thing.

‚Äî well, I'm definitely not going to drink the coffee from here. See you.

When I was going to ask something else, I noticed a car near the table... it looked so familiar to me, the car had a certain look of someone who was traveling too. I went to check the license plate to make sure I had my doubts.

""NCH 2R3 Utah""

‚Äî right...‚Äî I said with a sincere smile on my face. Walking up to the store and entering, the place looked the same. The chock-on-crips on the shelf were untidy. The postcards and pamphlets for outdoor hiking. The girl at the cashier asking me if I needed help.

‚Äî No, thanks.

Deeper in the store, I heard the sounds of keys being played tirelessly, fast and agile. A laugh that could be heard despite the low tone.

‚Äî Oh, shit, I need more coffee. ‚Äî He said, opening the coffee pot and noticing it was empty.

As he got closer and closer, I noticed that he was going to get up, to get the coffee made in the coffee maker.

‚Äî If you like coffee... don't drink the coffee from here. ‚Äî I said, seeing that he stopped for a few moments, and turned to look closely at an old friend of many years.

‚Äî Some habits don't change, much less phrases, right? ‚Äî I asked, extending my hand.

‚Äî Phrases change, except habits. People change too. Right, Sean Diaz?‚Äî he replied, extending his hand, pulling me into a warm, friendly hug.

‚Äî Long time no see, Brody.""",9,1728479176.0,LifeisStrange2,0,1.0,False

Effectiveness of at home tooth whitening?,"I am in Europe, and our tooth whitening is capped at 6%. I paid a LOT of money to get a personal mouth mold thing, and a LOT of money for whitening gel to go with that from my dentist. The max is 6% hydrogen peroxide, which my whitening gel is

I've noticed no improvements. So I have been looking at the Amazon US ""Crest 3D Whitestrips, Professional Effects, Teeth Whitening Strip Kit, 44 Strips"" which ship to Europe. I haev used these in the past with no results, but they are super cheap compared to what I buy here so I don't mind buying again

That being said, there is no % on these. Does anyone know what it is? And if it would be more effective than my 6% from my dentist? Wikipedia says ""Crest Whitestrips Professional has 200¬†mg of gel with 6.5% hydrogen peroxide per upper strip."" so it is basically the exact same thing I pay ‚Ç¨200 for here, which is a better deal, but.. it might not be effectivei n my case at all

I do not drink or smoke. The only liquid I consume is water, so none of my discoloration is from any drinks or smoking. My diet is okay, but I do eat sugar often. When I asked my dentist, she suggested it doesn't matter and that the whitening kit they provide will work for me too, but now I have doubts

Will whtiening strips ONLY work if your discoloration is from coffee/wine/etc? I was heavily discouraged by my dentist from the whole in office whitening treatment and suggested the gels will be enough for me, but I finished a pack of the crest strips, and my whitening gels, and have seen zero improvement, and I have thorough before and afetr pics in various different lightings for comparison :/",1,1728479105.0,beauty,0,1.0,False

And I have something in mind on how I want our first meet-up to go! Makikita mo ako in a public place, you would think ""OMG who's that girl?"" Lalapit ka sa akin, you would ask for my name, we will have a conversation about our interests, what we do in life, anong reason bakit tayo bumabangon. We'll be *blushing all the way home* after that encounter, and be *enchanted* to have found each other. 

Of course that was merely an idea of what I want to transpire. I believe love has its way of surprising us. And what it has in store for you and I, can be way better than what I had hoped and imagined.

Me? I'm a 24-year-old female living in the City of Manila. I am far from the girl-next-door archetype. I have been called cute, but I am far from being conventionally attractive. I admit I have been neglectful of my health (honestly, I still am), but I have been eating healthy and working out to  lose weight (I am CHUBBY) and just so I would live longer, really. If we were to be together, I would want to grow old with you and witness what life would have for us. I am an anik-anik gurlie, and I find joy in collecting cute things. If not in my place rotting, you would find me at a bookstore, a toy store, or a coffee shop. Despite my hectic sched, I try to make time for the people and things that matter the most to me.

And you? Well, you don't have to be flawless. I just need you to be decent and nice. Like, the bare bare bareeee minimum. I value hygiene so I hope you are someone who puts in effort in being hygienic as well. You don't have to be super fit, but it would be nice if we can influence each other to make wiser and healthier choices. Be someone kind, the type to radiate positive energy and brighten up a room and everyone's mood. But not someone too kind that they would let people walk over them. Someone who can handle deep conversations, but understand that the nonsensical small talks are just as important. When exciting times fade, I hope we can sit in silence and still enjoy each other's presence. 

Well? Let's continue to get to know each other over chat. I will be waiting for you.",1,1728479043.0,PhR4Dating,0,0.57,False

1fzqvyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Albany/comments/1fzqvyo/dog_stole_my_food/,Dog stole my food!,"TLDR:  A dog stole my sandwich

I just sat down in Washington Park to drink my coffee and eat my fresh and hot sandwich.  I took a sip from my coffee cup and sat it down next to me and a grey dog (friendly at least) came up to me and started sniffing around.  Since I love dogs, and animals in general, I said 'hello handsome'.  He looked at me with huge boogers in his eyes ü§¢
I have seen this dog many, many times.  Always off the leash and running around the park as the owner is way behind.  The owner is maybe 60 years old, male and bald, he's always yelling at the doggy but not in a bad way.
Anyways, after I said hello to doggy, I picked up half of my sandwich and went to take a bite.  The dog straight up took my food out of my hand and scarfed it down.  I couldn't help but to laugh as the owner slowly made his way to leash the dog.  As I laughed, the dog stole the bag with the other half of the sandwich and ate the sandwich and the paper wrapper.  I laughed even harder!
It took the owner another 30 seconds to come and leash his dog.  He did say sorry and told me he didn't have any money to buy a new sandwich.  I told him that it was alright, I'm not upset or anything, but they must have been hungry!
All in all, not a big deal.  Of course I'm not upset about my sandwich, but I'm still hungry.  Shouldn't have happened, the dog should be on the leash or at least closer to the owner.  I do, however, worry about this dog.  It will cross the street without his owner present and is all over the place.  I used to see the dog trotting alone coming from the Lark Tavern driveway with his owner no where to be seen.  They live somewhere right by Lark and Madison.  Poor pup was starving!

1fzqvwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1fzqvwx/undelivered/,Undelivered ,"The gun feels heavier than I expected, cold in my lap, as though it doesn‚Äôt belong to me‚Äîthough nothing feels like it belongs anymore. I stare at the laptop screen, the word **undelivered** pulsing back at me, taunting. I try again, one more attempt to send the email, to expose everything, but it won‚Äôt go. **They‚Äôve locked me out.**

The room feels off, too bright, too still. Chloe used to sit right there, across from me. She laughed, she *existed*. Now her desk is empty, wiped clean. She‚Äôs gone. They‚Äôve scrubbed her from everything, even people‚Äôs minds. 

But I remember.

*Bang. Bang. Bang.*

My heart jolts. The knocks come hard, deliberate. **They‚Äôve come for me.**

‚ÄúMason?‚Äù

It‚Äôs Wilson. His voice is muffled, too distant, like he‚Äôs speaking through thick glass. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk. You‚Äôre not well.‚Äù

**Not well?** I laugh, but it comes out jagged. They think I‚Äôm unwell, the way they thought Chloe was unwell. That‚Äôs what they do‚Äîlabel you unstable, then erase you. **But I know the truth.**

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt remember Chloe, do you?‚Äù My voice shakes, but I push through. ‚ÄúShe sat right there, Wilson. You asked her for coffee. Don‚Äôt you remember?‚Äù

Silence. Then, his voice, cold: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no one named Chloe, Mason.‚Äù

Of course. They‚Äôve scrubbed her, erased her from existence. **I‚Äôm next.**

‚ÄúI know what they did to her,‚Äù I whisper. ‚ÄúI went down there. I saw it.‚Äù The memory floods in, sharp and invasive‚Äîthe lab, the machines humming, the jar. I shouldn‚Äôt have seen it, but I did.

Her brain, floating in fluid, wires feeding it illusions, making it believe it was still alive, still whole. They did that to her. **They‚Äôll do it to me, too.**

‚ÄúMason, you‚Äôre not making sense,‚Äù Wilson says, but his voice is distant, disconnected. He doesn‚Äôt get it. Or maybe he does, but it‚Äôs too late for both of us.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to erase me, just like they erased her.‚Äù

The pressure in my skull builds. The room feels too sharp, too clean. I press my hands to my temples, trying to hold onto something‚Äî*anything* real. But the memory... **Was it Chloe?**

‚ÄúMason, open the door.‚Äù

I stumble back, the gun slipping from my grip, clattering to the floor. My breath comes in ragged bursts, the air too thin. My head throbs, pulsing with something I can‚Äôt explain.

I followed the Hoffman Switch Recipe but instead of 280ml of water I dropped it to 240ml. Originally I did 280ml but found that it was really watered down. After brewing 260ml and still feeling it was watered down I decided to try 240ml worth of water.

Free news gets its money from investors that control what is being said, and clickbait titles get designed to drive as much traffic as possible. These sites don‚Äôt get all their money from ads alone.

Subscriptions are a way for these sites to minimize the influence of corporate shittery, by making enough money on their own to not resort to base tactics that hold the industry and consumers alike back.

It usually costs you something like a cup of coffee to get everything from that site for free, for articles that are generally freer of shit than their contemporaries.

The first one is 100 square meters, next to a big coffee shop (Tom and Tom's), with good parking. It‚Äôs near a mall and not too far from the city center. The rent is 60k per month. 

The second spot is right in the city, across from Five Star Terminal. The building is older, there's no parking, but the rent is only 20k.

Since this is our first nail spa venture, I‚Äôd love to hear from anyone with experience in the industry.

1. For those who have run or are running a nail spa, what kind of profit margins should we realistically expect, especially in the first year?

2. What are the key expenses to consider beyond rent and payroll? Are there any hidden costs that surprised you?

3. What are some unexpected challenges you‚Äôve faced in running a nail spa that we should be aware of?

**What is tea leaves reading? (Tasseography)**



Tea leaves reading is called Tasseography, ‚ÄúTasse‚Äù means cup in French language and ‚Äúography‚Äù means patterns. It‚Äôs an ancient art of predicting the future by interpreting images and pictures, which left inside your tea cup when you finish drinking it.



A skilled psychic or even a beginner who learned how to read these symbols can easily make predictions. The theory behind this form of fortune telling is that when you drink from the cup, you produce a sort kind of energy. The vibrations that are coming naturally from your soul through the mouth rearrange the tiny leaves.



**Tea leaves spiritual meaning**



Ever since the man kind discovered the tea, he attached it a spiritual meaning. Many people around the world used to create rituals, celebrations and religious practices around the facts that they are drinking together. And you can still find these practices today.



There are two different spiritual ways to look at the psychic art of tea leaves reading:



The first one is the assumption that everything you see inside the cup is a sign from the future. These messages have been sent to you from the universe or guarding angels. This point of view refer to the phenomena that you don‚Äôt have control on what is going to happen in your life. But when a psychic is performing the Tasseography reading in an accurate way, he or she can warn you from danger and advice you on how to prepare. Further more, if you are going to get a good news, you will be able to get ready for it. And more important, to be aware of the right sign, when it happen and not missing the good chance that is a head of you.



The second is a little bit less spiritual and more psychological aspect of Tasseography: According to this method of interpretation, you already know what you want to achieve or do in your life. But you have a problem to realise it, or to even be aware of it. There is something inside of you that wants to go out to the universe, but you just can‚Äôt under or find the way to do it. By having a psychic reading, you will be able to transform the things that lay deeply in your subconsciousness to the surface.



**Tea leaves reading origin and history**



Many scholars will argue that tea leaves reading has begun long time ago in china. Monks used to drink it before the morning meditation process. After few hours of chanting and clearing the mind, body and soul, they went back to the cups. They noticed different images at the bottom, and tried to analyze or better understand the meaning behind those patterns and pictures, that sits there before their eyes.



From that moment Tasseography spread to Europe through the trading route near the Slavic and Baltic countries. Eastern Europeans were buying the tea leaves as a drink, but the wise merchants told them that they can also predict the future, with a certain ancient practice.



The rest of European countries quickly adopted the new way to gain divine knowledge. Before Tasseography was invented, psychics used other well known methods such as astrology, numerology, Ouija board, tarot card, dream interpretation and etc.



Gypsies from Romania and other nomadic tribes travelled from place to place and offered the service of tea leaves reading to people on the street, mainly near restaurants, coffee shops, street party and the main square of the village or town. Most of the clients were from the upper class, which paid good money for the answers to be delivered.



In the Victorian era, all the different social classes have already adopted Tasseography. It was really popular at parties and celebrations. Moreover, if you lived in that era, you could have bought special kits or sets of cup and saucer, to decorate your house and also to do conduct rituals all by yourself or show your expertise to you guests.



Despite the fact that the origin story of Tasseography was so promising, after few hundred years, when commercialized teabags were introduced to the world, people stopped doing it. Even if they tried to open the little bag, in order to spill the grinded leaves to the cup it didn‚Äôt form any pattern. However with coffee it was still possible. So at that tome in history there was a huge decline. Psychics, witches and mediums moved to other forms like tarot cards and palmistry.



**What cultures read tea leaves?**



In today‚Äôs world, Tasseography as a form of psychic reading and future predictions has become very popular. You can find that every culture has some connection to it. In fact, if you will search on Google for the term ‚Äútea leaves reading near me‚Äù, you will find many gifted psychics and mediums that are offering this unique reading service. They also offer teaching workshop, low price online course and other popular ways to predict the future such as tarot reading, astrology, numerology and etc.



However in the past Tasseomancy wasn‚Äôt very popular. It started long time ago at countries that are located near the Baltic Sea. The trading routes of commodities from the far east were crossing these areas, and so the people who were living there learned about the secret method of reading tea leaves.



The Romanian are consider the first to use the practice in the western world. Since then it passed from generation to generation in other countries as well. Therefore in our times, there are many methods to do it but basically it is all the same.



**How to read tea leaves for beginners**



Make a cup of tea with the following ingredients: take one full teaspoon (5 ‚Äì 7 gram) and put it inside the cup. And pour hot water inside. After you finished drinking the tea, the leaves should be at the bottom.



Take your left hand and smear it gently with 3 circle movement - counter clockwise. This will spread them randomly and create a trail of your destiny.



Now is the time to turn the cup over the saucer. Please be patient as you need to wait few minutes to let the all liquid to go down. This will stick the leaves and will form symbols inside. Meanwhile, clear your mind, think about nothing and try to get energies or vibes from the cup. If you are going to as the psychic a specific question than you have to think about that subject while you are waiting.



The final step before reading the tea leaves symbols is to turn over the cup again and look at the result within the cup.



The leaves that you see near the edge of the cups are representing events that will happen to you very soon, in the near future. Play close attention to those who are located near the handle, as it suppose to be the first thing that will occur in your life right now. As we go down the walls of the cup till the bottom, so the predictions are belonged to the far future.



At first glimpse you will see only random dispersing shapes with no particular meaning. At the beginning you‚Äôll also might find it very difficult to spot any symbol or pattern. So here are some basic rules that will surely help you in the process of tea leaves reading:



Notice if the shape is big or small. The larger it is, the more important message it carry.



In Tasseography, spotting a letter will imply the name of someone that is related to you, whether you know the person or not. If the letter is very big it might denote a name of a place.



Numbers are related to important dates in your future and sometimes can indicates when they spiritual event will occur. For example in the next 3 days, 3 weeks, 3 months or far away in 3 years. The bigger the digit the sooner it will happen. Also the numbers that are close to the cup‚Äôs rim usually symbolizing the number of days till the prophecy will occur.



Another rule of thumb in Tasseography - A big symbol is much more important than the small once. So start interpretation those first.



If you see a lot of dots in a certain place, take a good look at the closest symbol around, as it is connected to money and success with work or business.



You might notice a lot of lines between the different shapes. It shows you the direction in which the events will happen: crossing paths and decisions you might need to take. Whatever you choose, will direct you to a different road of possibilities.



Scroll down to the end of this article to view examples of tea leaves reading symbols, images and pattern.



**What tea is best for tea leaf reading?**



The general role in Tasseography is to avoid grinded powdered tea at all cost. Firstly because it will be unpleasant to drink and second, most people actually filter it with strainer. So there is nothing left inside the cup other than pure water. If you still insist in using this powder, you will be very disappointed and will see only one big shape of mud.



Large tea leaves will make patterns that are really hard to understand. It will create a big bulk which will be very difficult to extract any meaning from. So it is best advised to use smaller size, or at least tear or cut them into half size.



Small leaves are good for this kind of psychic reading. However if they are too small the result will be scattered randomly all over the place and make it hard for you to read it.



The best choice you can make when searching for the optimal leafs for reading is to balance. Find a medium size leaves. And if some of them are little big or little small that ok.



Please take into consideration that some leafs being sold with extra ingredients like petals, stems and seeds. If the amount of these ingredients is too big, than you need to dilute them. In this way it will not takeover the pattern creation process, especially when you turn the tea cup upside down.



**Can you read your own tea leaves?**



Yes offcourse. If you have a little spark of imagination or intuition, you can do Tasseography all by yourself. At first you won‚Äôt be able to extract lots of meanings from the cup and your reading might be wrong. After you practice a bit you will gain knowledge and most important experience. Over time you will find that you can actually develop this skill and maybe turn into a real psychic.



Moreover, it is an activity that you can do every morning when you drink your own cup of tea. Even if you devote only few minutes every day for training, results will start to come. You don‚Äôt have to go to an expensive workshop near by, or to participate in an online virtual course. You can start today from your home!



**Is reading tea leaves accurate?**



Any form of psychic reading in not one hundred percent accurate. Reading tea leaves depends on many factors which can vary. The best way to look at Tasseography is from an angle that is accurate to the current moment in the present.



If a psychic is telling a prophecy it doesn‚Äôt mean it has to come true, because you still have the power to decide and navigate the journey of life to different paths. The future can be change drastically, but only if you open your mind to learn what is going on right now in your life.



**Best tasseography cup to use**



Basically you can use any kind of cup. However it is better that it would be as wider as possible. Other shapes of containers will make it very difficult for you to read. For example, if the cup is too small, the leaves will pile one on each other and you won‚Äôt be able to distinguish the symbols, images, patterns and pictures. In fact the will notice only a big block of leaves with no meaning at all.



**Tea leaves reading symbols and images**

I needed something to brew a pot of coffee, my wife really wanted a Nespresso Vertuo, but also k-cups, so, we ended up getting the Pop+ and the Kotlie 5 in 1 along with a regular coffee maker.  A couple of days later, I had been in Sobeys and there was a deal for a free Tassimo machine with the purchase of 5 Tassimo products.  Who was i to say no to that.  Unfortunately, it also meant that there was no more room on the counter.

So, the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+, the Kotlie that brews Nespresso Original, K-cup, Dolce Gusto, ESE, and an adequate but not amazing espresso from a pressure basket at 19 bar.  It also took longer than I'd like to admit to get the water going through the Kotlie to not taste like machine oil.  There's also a french press and grinder behind the soda stream (carbonated water with some cold brew concentrate ended up being better than it sounded).  Of course, Tassimo and drip as well.

Any single serve that I'm not aware of, but that at this point I probably want to stay away from :)

1fzqdsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1fzqdsz/ifwhat_to_say_next/,If/What to say next?,"A few (6-7) years ago when I (25m) had a valued friend (24f) when we both still went to the same classes/the same school.

We were always really different people, I'm quite introverted and stayed home most of the time. She'd be very outgoing, working alongside school, hanging out with lots of people.
We'd talk a lot via instant messenger often about things going on in her life or something I'd be helping her with school stuff or just really random things.
At some point, she had to leave the school, the reasons for I won't share here and we'd still be fine for a while.
At the time her boyfriend disapproved of any contact of her's with any males.
Since she didn't want to lose me I essentially became a pretend female classmate of hers such that we could still be in touch.
At some point she even wrote that we'd be friends for life.

But even few months earlier, essentially since we didn't go to the same classes anymore which was like for a year or so earlier, I was scared of losing our connection, our friendship.
I don't remember the exact details but at some point she'd just reach out less and less with me via text. I was always kind of lonely, still am, typically I had had like one person I'd really call a friend at the time. So I reached out, acting out of fear of losing her, bringing that up. Which made her uncomfortable, every time I did. I realize now how stupid it was of me to not stop at the time. I shouldn't have let my anxiety get the best of me.

We would have less and less contact and at the end of 2018, I kind of exploded sending her a video of me crying and saying some things I shouldn't have said. To say the least, she was very uncomfortable after that, understanably so, of course I immediately apologized but the damage was done.
After some weeks I stopped reaching out because we kind of agreed there was nothing left for me to say or do to make things right. This was now almost six years ago.

A few months ago, I reached out to her via Instagram as she had reached out to me asking what I was doing in 2022. 
She replied and asked if we could grab a coffee sometime.
Well the first attempt fell through and the second attempt like a month later fell through as well as she would rather clean her place.
Which the first time didn't hurt as she told me so in advance. 
The second time, well we didn't make a time or place to meet but said we could meet on day X. After I reached out if she'd still want to get together that day she said that she was cleaning her place. We kind of miscommunicated here. I thought our meeting was more planned as she thought but no big deal.

Well, I have acted idiotically in hindsight over the last few weeks/months.
I should mention that I have been dealing with anxiety since I was a young kid and still do. Anyways, I reached out way too much and way too often over the course of August and September.
I'd ask how she was doing, how her vacation was, sent her memes or pictures from my day. Often times I'd get no response which I shouldn't have ignored but I did...
I will admit I became way to obsessed because I had basically way too much free time between my uni exams in August and September.

One and a half weeks ago, she blocked me on Instagram. Three days later I contacted her via another messenger since she had given me her number after my asking for it in July.
I asked if everything was alright between us and if she needed space.

And yes she said needed space. I deleted the texts but she told me I needed way too much attention which I agree is how it must have seemed to her. She also said that my too quickly liking of every of there Insta stories and me removing basically all my follows except my mom, her friend, her and non-people accounts made her very uncomfortable. And I can totally see that. It was stupid and I feel sorry. I can even see that I self sabotaged myself.
I would even go a step further than she did and would say some of the things I wrote her were meant nicely but were giving way too much unwanted attention. I'm really sorry for how I acted.

I feel like I messed up my attempts
 to try to connect a little totally by simply trying too much and too hard.
I guess back then I already kind of knew that I wouldn't want to lose that connection we had back then, even though I have years ago.

I haven't sent her any message since she wrote me the reasons for her blocking me to respect her wish for distance.

I have been thinking of apologizing beyond my initial apologetic question why she blocked me in like a month from now.

One thing, beyond responding distant or not responding at all, she never said anything that I was annoying her or that I bothered her. If so I would have, of course, immediately stopped.
Probably my loneliness got the best of me and I overshared and was too clingy/annoying.

I could use some advice, tell me if I shouldn't reach out. Do something else. Or simply try to let go without writing another word. Or anything else.

TLDR: I (25m) reached out to an old former friend (24f) after years of practically no contact. She wanted to grab a coffee sometime but we didn't really find the time. I acted like a moron and reached out way too much and annoyed her to the point where she blocked me on Instagram but I could still reach her otherwise.",1,1728477472.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I (M33) so t know what to do or believe, has any got any advice or experience anything similar?","I met a lovely younger girl on Hinge last June, it was my first time putting myself out there since a bad divorce where my ex wife had a 6 month affair with a coworker and left me for them without warning (obviously have trauma from that. 

I told my partner in question all about it and how it affected me very early in our relationship. After 3 months she broke up with me for her ex that she told Me moved away and was no longer in contact with for months prior to us meeting, I later found out that she broke up with him via text 4 days before we met while he was away at work but still had roots in the same city and would be back in town on weekends.

That caused major trust issues between us and i decided to stay, she seemed like a really cool person and in the type to be a sucker and see the good in people, everyone fucks up. 

Neither of us handled it very well and got into bad arguments where I admittedly was verbally abusive, put my hand on her in a defensive matter for trying to leave while I was trying to get her to stay and figure things out. 

After that I was always worried of her leaving and me not being good enough, she also cheated on me while I was at work and would consistently lie about seeing him while I was at work, we weren‚Äôt living together but basically spent every night together, I would come over early without telling her and see his car out outside her place. I thought we came to an understanding and things were good, we had a good 3 month and moved in together. One day I saw her telling her best friend she wanted to do something bad and need her as an excuse to go see her ex, I told her I knew what she was up to, we separated and she had all my things packed the next day, when I came to pick up my things the following day I looked through her phone and saw her Snapchating highly sexual things and nudes to him, call her out and told her it really hurt me, I cried in a ball as I tried to pack my things and move out, got most of my things and headed out, next day I came back and saw that she told him that I found out about the nudes and that my reaction was funny to her (so my worst fear that she knew and intentionally did, the pain I was experiencing was funny to her) 

We split things off for a while, saw eachother randomly and we were cool, we‚Äôd casually hook up and she said she wasn‚Äôt really seeing him but I‚Äôd find his phone charger on my side of the bed and pictures of them on dates in random places while I was cleaning, she would go to work and I‚Äôd be off and help her out around her place, so laundry and whatnot.. i thought we were working towards getting back together and I found the lingerie she got for me for Valentine‚Äôs Day in the dirty laundry and it wasn‚Äôt used on me, she always said he‚Äôd come on to her sexually but you don‚Äôt put on lingerie for somone if that‚Äôs true

we broke things off and ended up not talking for a while, one day she hit me up as basically a botty call, we hooked up and I woke up and saw an open notebook with a checklist for a wedding checklist under the coffee table, she was getting married in 3 days. I was supportive and nice about it, I put her in her wedding dress and took her tanning and to get her nails done so she can look how she wants for her big day..

A few days later I said enough is enough and moved across the country back to my family. We got into it pretty good via text on my drive across the country and didn‚Äôt speak for a month or 2..she ended up hitting me up and telling me how much of a mistake it was and she wanted to be together, she was actively cheating on her husband with me and after a month or so decided she was going to come see me at my new place , took a 3 day weekend and jumped on a plane to come see me.. her return flight got canceled and she had to fess up to her husband and the agreed to divorce.. they didn‚Äôt speak and we had arguably the best month of our relationship, she was going to start life fresh in a new place she fell in love with, one night I walked in and saw her texting him huge texts and once I called her out we got into a bad argument, she had no car and knew no one in the area as it‚Äôs new to her. She went to leave and I tried everything to get her to stay because I didn‚Äôt t want. Her wondering the streets when she has no clue where to go and it‚Äôs not really a big city, there‚Äôs no hotels for probably 10 miles, she doesn‚Äôt even know how to get there. I put my hands up to keep her from coming out the door and insisted I‚Äôd leave instead, she pushed me out of the way. I know better and would never abuse a woman, I was simply trying to make it easier on her/ keep her safe but we were both going at it verbally, we get nasty when we fight ..Is that abuse? 

She left and got on a plane to her home town, left her pets and hooked up with him the next day. I was an asshole and told her I gave her pets away, wrong yes , not excusable and I know was wrong. She threatened suicide and I was like okay enough is enough, told her the pets were safe and she told me she wanted to come back..

I got on a flight and as soon as I got there I found out it was a set up to just get the pets back. I still drove with her across country and decided hey we‚Äôll try and see what happens, things felt cool we were building a home together and things seemed great, I later found out it was still indeed a set up and as soon as she got a settlement check from a recent car accident she was sending money to the same ex/still technically husband and she told me she was leaving.. I was respectful and helped her pack her things. Offered to store her stuff at my place as I had the extra space. She flew him her, got cold feet and decided to stay here with me put him on a flight, told me she was so annoyed with him after a day and wanted to be with me

A week later we found out she was pregnant and got pregnant around the time she last hooked up with her ex, we weren‚Äôt sexually active for  for about a week before , she got her period right before she left me and then slept with him, we didn‚Äôt do anything for a few weeks after. She convinced me that he did not finish and it had to be mine. We talked about it and I was excited even though she had a miscarriage in a previous relationship she told me not to get my hopes up yet and we we‚Äôre still on the fence about what to do considering our relationship hasn‚Äôt always been the best, we have both hurt eachother and weren‚Äôt sure what to do, we went to our first doctors appointment to explore our options and on the ride home got into a fight because a few days earlier I saw her tell him she missed him so much while I was giving her breakfast in bed because she wasn‚Äôt feeling well and he would say sexual things to her and she wouldn‚Äôt shut it down, no nudes or anything .. he would say inappropriate things to her and she would respond with üëÄ or something of that nature. It was t the best timing but she asked me what was wrong after the appointment and I can‚Äôt lie to her . It was poor timing on my part and she said she was leaving me again. I said okay, and tried to convince her to take some time and think about things.

She made a redit post says Earlier that week asking for advice and said she was afraid the baby was mine and when confronted I asked her who‚Äôs she‚Äôd rather be the dad and she said her ex understandably because of our crazy fights and the ways we‚Äôve handled things in the past.

she said she was leaving in 2 days (because her ex was off and the weekend and was going to help her drive, so I feel like she rushed things) I told her the night before I would do anything no matter how crazy for her to stay with me and told her to think about it and told her the next day I would help move her stuff to a storage unit , still hoping she would reconsider, I woke up the next day and she was upset with me for oversleeping, I was upset she was leaving and we got into it again verbally, no threats or anything were made she called the cops and told them I was threading her and was in fear for her life.. so I said fuck it you wanna go and want me to move everything I‚Äôll take it all out and put it by your car, you want out , let‚Äôs get you out. And off she went back across the country. 

We spoke last night in the phone for about 3 hours, she go into a fight with him and was basically sleeping in her car and had nowhere to go. I kept her company we talked about things a little and agreed lastnight to talk about our feelings and try to make the best decisions as far as the relationship goes and the baby. 

Today we decided to lay out our feelings via text at the same time, I basically said I‚Äôll do anything for her and wanted to step up and be a better partner and a good dad.. even if we terminated this pregnancy I would want to try again in the future due to the uncertainty of the father ‚Ä¶she basically said she didn‚Äôt want to be with anyone rn, that we should terminate the pregnancy and she wasn‚Äôt going to be around much longer, couldn‚Äôt give anymore to anyone , won‚Äôt ever open up again and hates herself for the things she‚Äôs done and ways she‚Äôs fucked yo her life and our relationship , was putting all her ducks in a row to end her life.. but at the same time I know she is seeking a government program to get a discrete address claiming she is hiding from an abusive ex partner (me) 

I have done bad things and what can be categorized as abuse.. I snap out and feel so betrayed when I‚Äôm lied to and cheated on, played. I admittedly get to attached and love/trust way to hard, when we first broke up and she hooked u with her ex the next day, I trashed her apartment and I have done things I‚Äôm not proud of when my feelings and heart get messed with . I‚Äôm a straight shooter and it always seems like a game to her.. I want to change and make our lives and relationship better still to this day. 

My question is, are the threats of suicide real or is she basically trying to shame me for being rude and telling her about herself, verbally abusive. In an attempt to think she killed herself? 

How do we repair the damage and mistrust after so much pain we‚Äôve caused and the trauma we‚Äôve caused eachother?  I love her and promised I‚Äôd never give up on her and genuinely don‚Äôt know what to do, any input would be greatly appreciated.",1,1728477081.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

Since i can remember (from about age ‚âà7-8) ive had brown-ish stains, like coffee, on my chest and under my boob. They started as small dots in the middle of my chest and have grown with me into a heart-ish shaped patch on my chest, smaller dots under my boob and some further up my chest too.

I dont know if i do or not, because my chest is the only affected area, but i know ive not been sunburnt, i dont have any other (known) autoimmune diseases etc, they just started as small dots, and have grown as ive gotten older. The patches also have a different texture to the rest of my skin, it feels kinda fuzzy. they also sometimes itch, but it rarely happens.

Im going to see a doctor about it today, so hopefully ill be able to figure this out, and see what can be done. Because the affected area is so small, and is rarely exposed, it causes me no discomfort, so i dont want to seek treatment if i do have vitiligo.

I still have a few days left before I can return it but I feel like it has to be a me problem and not a problem with the machine. No matter what I do my shot is always sour. Every single shot has tasted the exact same and I've probably pulled close to 40-50 shots. It's undrinkable. I do have the barista gadgets PID installed.

Here's my setup: - varia vs3 gen 2 grinder - normcore 18g basket - wdt tool - normcore 58.5mm self leveling tamper - I've tried counter culture big trouble, stumptown founders, merit wildcatter espresso blend, and oak Cliff coffee roasters espresso blend (all have been roasted about 2-3 weeks earlier)

Here's the process: I grind 18g. For the grind settings I've done anywhere between 1.5 and 3 on the varia vs3 gen 2. Anything less than 1.5 chokes the machine and usually above 2.6ish the espresso flows out very fast. So I don't think it's a grinder problem. Almost every post or article says to grind finer but no matter how fine I grind it still tastes sour. I try to go for a yield ratio of anywhere from 1:2 to 1:3. Every ratio tastes sour to the point I even tried going 1:4 and that tastes the exact same. The time to yield have been in the range of the suggested times of 25-30 seconds. Still sour I've pulled shots longer at 40-50 seconds and it it's still sour.

From what I've read it seems sour is underextraction. I don't have a refined palate but it doesn't taste bitter. It's undrinkable. I thought at one point maybe installed the PID wrong. Maybe the water was too cold. But it appears to be working fine. I have cranked up the temp to the max 115C which flash boils the water coming from the group head and it's still sour! I typically keep the temp set at 103C with an offset of -8C.

I feel like my puck prep is good. I wdt to break up and clumps and then tamp. Do you think it's the beans? I've heard darker roasts are easiest. I assumed espresso blend beans would be dark roast but after some reading it appears that is not the case. I think I'm going to hutna bag of specifically labeled dark roast. Looking for help and any advice would be appreciated.

I should add that I've tried pre infusion as well. I have it set to have the pump at 30% for 5 seconds, then 0% for 10 seconds, then 100% power after that. The evo has a 9 bar spring installed.

1fzq0de,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1fzq0de/season_7_thoughts_from_someone_whos_watched_4/,Season 7 thoughts from someone who's watched 4 episodes (not in order),"So, I've been a mess lately and can't focus, as a result my rewatch has consisted of me just jumping around the show and watching whatever episode feels right.

For context: I've never finished season 6 nor have I ever made it to season 7. I have, however, watched certain episodes because watching the downfall of Christopher and Lorelai's marriage gives me a major serotonin boost. 

The car shopping episode with Luke and Lorelai arguing about his blood pressure and how he gets like that when he's hungry? Old married couple energy right there. The bathroom tiles were so unnecessary to bring up and I love that they reopened this argument. That was not very ""we've moved passed our relationship and feelings for each other"" of them.

But, I digress, let's talk about my very uninformed thoughts of season 7.

Thisv includes thoughts on Rory's love life, Christopher being a mess, Lorelai being Lorelai, and Luke being Luke.

Logan and Rory are top tier and no one can change my mind. Definition of ""if he wanted to, he would"". The way he borrowed a whole helicopter because Richard was in the hospital and then dealt with the COD JOKE from the fish guy ü•∞. Not to mention the fact that he was so calm about Rory having a crush on the TA bc it happens when Jess probably would've gotten defensive and later seasons Dean would have lost it. Adult relationship was adult relationshiping.

That was not a love letter, Christopher, it was a perfectly good character reference. You only got so insecure because it pointed out how you weren't there when Luke was. Things like this are why you guys don't work. She can't coddle you all the time, she needs a partner. 

Lorelai putting all that effort into the doggy memorial was great. 10/10 friendship moment. 

Lorelai and Sookie'sb conversation about Christopher is actually really great and the way Sookie went about talking to her and asking her the ""would it still be Christopher"" was an amazing moment because that was exactly what Lorelai needed to hear. 

I'd Rather Be In Philadelphia might be one of the greatest episodes of the show. Hands down.

The fact it isn't just Lorelai and Rory who respond that way to Luke's coffee ü•∞. Seriously, Chris got jump scared by how awesome his wife's ex fiance's coffee making skills are. That had to be intimidating.

Christopher turning off his phone when he has a wife and two daughters was not okay and I can't forgive that. You don't turn off your phone when you have those kinds of responsibilities, what if something happened to GiGi and his mother couldn't get in contact with him? Common Chris L, but worse than usual. 

Lorelai babysitting was so sweet and cute. Jackson not getting snipped and not telling Sookie was not so sweet and cute. 

Emily and Richard had me in a chokehold and all emotional. Richard hating Philadelphia is so on point.

Everything about Christopher and Lorelai's divorce gives me happy chemicals. I literally just turned those ones on a while back so I could feel something when I tried watching season 6.

Luke bringing fish sticks was almost as romantic as the Santa burger, and anyone who knows me knows how much I adore the Santa burger scene. 

The fact Luke set it up so Lorelai could get a newer engine for her old car so she wouldn't have to buy a new one despite thinking it was insane was an instant classic.

*Insert Victoria Justice meme*

I think we ALL want Lorelai's dress that she wore when she finally went into Luke's again.

I think that's all, might add more later. 

Any recommendations on episodes to watch from season 6 and season 7? I genuinely don't think I can watch them all the way through in order.",4,1728476254.0,GilmoreGirls,1,0.75,False

If you try and drink coffee black, it turns out stronger and has a much higher acidity than you're used to or want.

Solution: Use hot water (from the boiling kettle) to add to the black coffee until it tastes smooth.

If you get it right, you'll find the taste and mouthfeel is very close to creamed coffee.

This is similar to the idea of the Americano coffee.

This is a bit of a vent, rant, general airing of frustration. There is a request for advice on what to do at the end too.

Our Shiba is 1 year old. She's the dream. Incredibly calm, quiet and gentle. Super polite with strangers (although she sort of orbits them for treats...). She likes to cuddle and sleep with us, she never barks at anything outside. The only times she makes noise is: 1 bark if somethings wrong to get our attention, a tiny whine when she wants our food, or a weird Demon monkey scream when we're wrestling. She likes her own space and will happily go into rooms alone to nap for hours. She loves long walks, lying in the park and observing dogs for hours, and playing games. She loves coffee shops and getting pup cups, and knows all her routes and routines. 

But we've moved. We left our apartment and traveled for 4 days by train & car to stay with family. On the travel days she was a champion. She slept for an entire 5 hour train trip. On the 2 days of driving she got a little anxious and stressed, but remained calm. In the hotels she went a bit ballistic with pent up energy; every towel, bed and person in the room got wrestled and jumped on.

When we arrived at our destination,  she was ecstatic. She ran laps of the new giant yard she has to explore. She spent the first day all over my MIL, FIL, and SIL. She liked cuddling on the new beds, and slept like a rock to catchup on sleep. She liked running and racing in the yard and she liked exploring the new town.

But, we're not alone in the house. There's 2 houses here, everyone's in the other except 1 family member below us. They have their own dog (they don't care about each other), but everytime she sees our dog she gives her treats, or chicken, or other food. She plies her with food in that expected grandma ""oh no she's starving"" way. And since then, our dog has changed.

She sits at the top of the stairs and cries, whines, SCREAMS, to be let down at the slightest noise. If there's even a single chance that the noise below was grandma, she MUST go down. I mean she's whined more in the last 48 hours than her *entire* first year. If we let her freely roam, she spends all her time trying to scratch into her bedroom, or steal the other dogs food. She's not hungry. She's eating all her meals as normal, she's even gained weight. She's just gone ballistic for grandma snacks. 

We've had to impose rules. 1 treat a day. That turned into a back and forth negotiation, ""oh I didn't think you meant x"". Now it's nothing. Nobody can give her food except us. But it feels too late.

Today she's whined, I am not kidding, for nearly 4 hours. The treat giver isn't even home! She just heard stuff downstairs. No matter if we let her investigate or not, she's not satisfied. 

Before, she'd like to explore and sniff around the yard. But now whenever we get back from walks, she sprints at top speed to the front door. SCREAMS to be let in. And if nobody is there? Doesn't matter, she'll SCREAM again. 

And it's not something else. We know it's for the food. She runs to the exact same spot, sniffs around. Nothing? She'll run around and check each room. She only calms down (momentarily) if she gets what she's after. 

I don't know what to do. I feel so melodramatic. But I've barely done anything to relax in approaching 3 days. I've walked her to distract her. I've given her treats up here. We've imposed a no food rule from others. From about 10am - 5pm (when grandma goes to bed), literally nothing will calm her from whining at top volume. She wasn't like this tje first 3 days, it was a very clear ""oh shit I get extra chicken"" shift. 

I'm sure when we leave, and are at our new home, she'll get the hint nobody is around and chill out. I'm sure she'll return to normal. 

But how the heck do I deal with *here*?

1fzpz3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaggiaclassic/comments/1fzpz3h/always_getting_sour_shots_with_gcp_evo_i_need/,Always getting sour shots with GCP Evo. I need some help.,"I got a GCP Evo about a month ago. I still have a few days left before I can return it but I feel like it has to be a me problem and not a problem with the machine. No matter what I do my shot is always sour. Every single shot has tasted the exact same and I've probably pulled close to 40-50 shots. It's undrinkable. I do have the barista gadgets PID installed. 

Here's my setup:
- varia vs3 gen 2 grinder 
- normcore 18g basket 
- wdt tool
- normcore 58.5mm self leveling tamper 
- I've tried counter culture big trouble, stumptown founders, merit wildcatter espresso blend, and oak Cliff coffee roasters espresso blend (all have been roasted about 2-3 weeks earlier)

Here's the process: I grind 18g. For the grind settings I've done anywhere between 1.5 and 3 on the varia vs3 gen 2. Anything less than 1.5 chokes the machine and usually above 2.6ish the espresso flows out very fast. So I don't think it's a grinder problem. Almost every post or article says to grind finer but no matter how fine I grind it still tastes sour. I try to go for a yield ratio of anywhere from 1:2 to 1:3. Every ratio tastes sour to the point I even tried going 1:4 and that tastes the exact same. The time to yield have been in the range of the suggested times of 25-30 seconds. Still sour I've pulled shots longer at 40-50 seconds and it it's still sour. 

From what I've read it seems sour is underextraction. I don't have a refined palate but it doesn't taste bitter. It's undrinkable. I thought at one point maybe installed the PID wrong. Maybe the water was too cold. But it appears to be working fine. I have cranked up the temp to the max 115C which flash boils the water coming from the group head and it's still sour! I typically keep the temp set at 103C with an offset of -8C. 

I feel like my puck prep is good. I wdt to break up and clumps and then tamp. Do you think it's the beans? I've heard darker roasts are easiest. I assumed espresso blend beans would be dark roast but after some reading it appears that is not the case. I think I'm going to hutna bag of specifically labeled dark roast. Looking for help and any advice would be appreciated.

Edit: I should add that I've tried pre infusion as well. I have it set to have the pump at 30% for 5 seconds, then 0% for 10 seconds, then 100% power after that. The evo has a 9 bar spring installed. I use filtered water from the fridge. I've even tried bottled water.",1,1728476132.0,gaggiaclassic,2,1.0,False
