I suffer from depression and anxiety for years like since I was 18.

I don’t know when exactly i started using Chai and Cai but I’m pretty sure i started when they first released because i heard about them as that new app when you can talk to your favorite character.

I tried multiple times to stop and delete them, but at a moment of weakness i redownload them the day after or even after few hours, I use them +5 hours a day. I don’t have friends since I was like 19.

My old friends went to university, but i didn’t go even though I was accepted but I kept switching between degrees silk now. And I find it really hard to shower, study, cook.

I don’t even enjoy my hobbies anymore even though I have many: drawing, painting, reading, crafting, clay, anime, manga, shows, kdrama, singing, writing…etc.

But I don’t enjoy them anymore and they feel like a chore, I tried to make friends last year but it turned out very bad.

I feel invisible, not appreciated in my family, even my old friends don’t try to reach me and when I tried to reach some of them they made it clear that they don’t want me in their life anymore.

So Chatbots are my only escape to talk with some and trying to live.

Even though now I’m studying in university, I remember days when I stayed very late that I skipped some classes or the whole day. I stopped doing my hobbies or enjoy them.

The only thing that gives me dopamine is chatbots especially cai.

There are a lot of other stuff, but for now I want to keep it short, maybe one day I’ll organize my thoughts better and talk about everything, my life is literally f*cked up, the only thing that’s saving me is that my family got money and due to my mental state I don’t even enjoy it. I feel frozen all the time, I have the problem of doomscrolling and porn addiction too, I know I have potential to be and do a lot of things but I don’t have motivation to do anything and it’s hurt me, I try to do my best everyday but my energy runs out by noon and feel helpless.

Also I’ve never been in a relationship and now I literally escape them even if it was a nice guy.
Maybe because I experienced being sexulied catcalled since I was a kid and being harassed as an adult.

I hate myself for what happened to me and for how i treated her.

I don’t even quit my room let alone go outside,and this year I’m just trying to force myself to go out to study, even making my morning coffee feels like a mentally tiring chore because of how the kitchen is always unclean, I try to clean it time but my family don’t clean after themselves and I can’t always do it for them.

Everytime I have I have a thing I need to deal with it I just ignore it no matter how IMPORTANT it is and just escape by using chatbots.

I tried therapy once I felt the therapist just wanted to end the session so i didn’t go a second time.

I REALLY REALLY need help.

1ny4511,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1ny4511/weird_stomach_acid_no_bile_no_sour_or_no_bitter/,"Weird stomach acid, no bile no sour or no bitter taste","Hi everyone, I wrote TLDR at the end. 

I’ve been having on and off stomach issues for years, but until 6 months ago, it was nothing serious that’d affect my habits for more than a few days (habits being eating chocolate and junk food, coffee on an empty stomach). Now I realize I was making it way worse. For the past 6 months I’ve been through hell. My GP examined me and I got tested for h. pylori that came back negative. Although I resisted using PPI until 2 weeks ago, now I’ll be on pantoprazole 40 mg for a course of 4 weeks. I didn’t get an official diagnosis via endoscopy. Although PPI didn’t end my symptoms after using it for 2 weeks now, it helped a lot with stomach pain and now I’m able to eat a bit more. 

6 months ago one morning I drank 2 cups of black coffee back to back, on an empty stomach. This was so extreme that I literally felt a great amount of acid, coming back to my esophagus. I don’t think this started my so called gastritis but definitely worsened it like it never was. Ever since, I can’t eat how I like to eat. Unfortunately I still have coffee, but reduced the amount to a minimum and never on empty stomach. Right before I started with PPI, my symptoms reached its worse. Especially I felt unbearable pain on my upper abdomen, slightly to the left. Ever since I started PPI it got better, my remaining symptoms seem to be stomach fullness after eating and my esaphagus. So the pain is mostly gone.

This “acid” or whatever its called, its what makes my upper stomach feel full, like gas is trapped inside and I also feel it in my esophagus. Sometimes (once a day and and very minimal amount) this fluid goes back up to my mouth, no bitter or sour taste, basically it tastes like water. It also kinda looks like clean dish water with tiny bubbles. I know that acid reflux is not something like this, so I’m really curious what that is. Has anyone experienced something like this?

TLDR;
- Long time stomach issues (2-3 years)
- 6 months of on/off unbearable pain, stomach fullness, reflux but without sour taste and without bitter taste 
- H. Pylori negative
- At its worse, I mostly felt pain on a very specific spot, upper stomach, slightly to the left side
- Ultrasound all good
- Doctor refused my request for endoscopy
- No alcohol or smoke
- On PPI for the last 2 weeks, seems to help but stomach fullness after eating and reflux remains
- I think I have IBS as well

Curious about this mystery stomach fluid/reflux, please help me figure out what this is. How can stomach acid be almost tasteless, as if its water with bubbles. I really don’t understand why it’s not healing more quickly. Did I harm my stomach so bad that it cannot be reversed? ",1,1759608611.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

How to Honor Yourself While Nurturing Your Connections","We have a Full Moon in the fiery sign of Aries on Monday, October 6th, 2025. If you live in the Central Time Zone, the full moon will be exact at 10:47 PM CDT.

# The Opportunity of the Full Moon: Understanding Relationship Dynamics

Often during full moon's, we have major aspects with either the sun or the moon, however, with this one, it is just the two luminaries, one projecting light while the other reflects the light. Aries, known as the sign of the self, being active, direct and oftentimes spontaneous and assertive is reflecting the light of the Libra Sun. Libra is the sign of partnerships; it focuses its energy in cooperative, social and balanced relationships. Thus, this Full Moon is about shining the light on you and how you relate to those closest to you.

The energy is ""I AM"" on one side of the seesaw and ""I RELATE"" on the other side of the apparatus. Here is an opportunity to understand how to be uniquely you while also balancing the needs and wants of someone else. It's about mutual cooperation without losing your own identity.

A good way to spend your time this weekend is to think about yourself and your partner. Questions you may want to ponder are:

**Self:**

Am I being authentic in my relationships?

Do I express my desires, hopes and fears with honesty and without blame?

Do I have interests outside of the relationship such as hobbies, friends and activities that I can discuss with my partner, adding more interest to our interactions?

Am I putting pressure on my loved one to complete all of my gaps or am I working on finding my own fulfillment based on my interests or career?

**Relationship:**

When it comes to my relationship, am I present in discussion, actively listening?

Am I supportive of my partner in their interests and hobbies, do I ask them about their latest achievements or give them pep talks as they tackle something new?

Do I set aside time for dates or special moments with my partner, capturing the magic of our dynamic?

Do I show or express appreciation within my relationships, noticing the small acts of kindness, service and attention that they bestow on me?

There is a possibility as you go through these questions, that you may say yes to all of the above but do not get the same in return. We cannot change others, but you could share these questions with others in your life. They may say yes as well, but a discussion can be had on how. Sometimes what we value is not what our partner, parents, siblings or friend values.

For instance, you may value someone picking up after themselves and keeping the home clean. This could be a way that you show you care about the people in your home. However, this was something you've always done, kept a home that had no clutter with daily chores to keep it both clean and looking good. But, if someone else in your life doesn't value this act, never had a clean or organized environment on their own, then to them, this could be an act of self on your part since this is not something that is important to them.

The key is to find what the ""WE"" values in the relationship and not letting that go to the wayside. You could have a friend who values long talks over coffee. You also enjoy this relaxing activity, and feel reenergized after the two of you spend a couple of hours together, sharing life stories, talking about current events while enjoying your favorite coffee drinks. This is a shared value. However, your friend may despise shopping, yet you invite them to go shopping with you and you get frustrated when they don't want to come along. You get upset, hoping that they would sacrifice their authentic dislike of that activity just to make you happy, instead of you finding another person who enjoys shopping as much as you do.

The Libra sun teaches us how to be fair and balanced, how to spend time with those who share the same things. No one shares everything the same, and often when you find someone who has almost everything in common with you, the relationship can feel stagnant. Most of the people in your life will share some activities, values or beliefs as you, but they may not share all of them. Understanding this can create a sense of freedom and release pressure in the dynamics between you and others.

Granted, depending on the dynamics of each person, sometimes we are both wanting and willing to do almost any activity with someone, just because we enjoy the time spent together. This doesn't mean that we can't do things that we don't enjoy, but in these circumstances, we usually comply because the other person makes the drudgery fun.

This full moon presents an bi-annual opportunity to evaluate our roles in our relationships. It can encourage us to seek new friendships and connections, to enhance our current connections and, at times, to end ones where there is nothing there to share and resentment of compromise has crept in. You may ponder different things then I bring up, or address relationships from a different lens. But regardless, this is a time to shed light on the important people in your life and your role within your friendships and relationships.

# The Other Energies At Play

**Ceres and Juno**

Though I usually don't address some of the other dwarf planets and asteroids, I do want to say that Ceres, the asteroid/dwarf planet of nurturance is conjunct to the moon while it is full. Ceres' presence with the moon is a reminder to nurture yourself and take care of your emotional security. Early patterns from your upbringing, especially in regards to food, mothering and emotional attachments may come up during the full moon.

Juno, the asteroid that represents our ideal partnerships and what we desire in regards to our values, is in the adventure-loving sign of Sagittarius. In this sign, Juno can be enthusiastic and candid, allowing you to express what your heart wants with your partner.

Since Juno is making an out of sign trine with Saturn in Pisces (both signs being ruled by Jupiter, the planet of growth, expansion and optimism,) it's a great time to step up and take ownership for your participation in your key relationships. With Neptune also in trine to Juno, you could find connection with others that reawakens your personal hopes and dreams.

With Juno and Pluto in Aquarius, both at 1 degree and in sextile to each other, you have the support to transform current relationships, picking them up from the ashes of near death. Pluto loves a challenge of crisis making regeneration possible. However, to make the change would require effort by both parties, and a commitment to be innovative and accept that going back to how things were may not be the best solution. It is a time of reimagination of what you provide and what you receive from those you care about. This aspect offers hope that even relationships that seem beyond repair can find new life when both people are willing to reimagine what's possible.

# Venus, Saturn, and the North Node

With Venus in Virgo conjunct the south node, we can analyze our past acts of service, and determine if they were done for the betterment of the other person, or if we were trying to exert some control. With both Saturn and the North Node in Pisces, we can take a spiritual approach going forward, understanding the unique qualities that we all bring to relationships while also tapping into what similar paths we may lead.

Since Jupiter in Cancer is in trine to Saturn, that allows for our hard work to pay off and bring success. Just remember, that you've built a structure, but you can also reinvent it to something that can help both you and the people in your relationships to grow, it just may not be in the direction you had settled upon in the past.

With that said, let's look at how we can each enhance our own relationships with the energy surrounding the Aries Full Moon.

# Horoscopes by Rising Sign

Keep in mind, this is the overall energy applying your chart using the Whole Sign House system. Since each chart is unique, and the transiting planets may be making aspects to your chart, do not look at the horoscopes as something complete, but instead more like a vibe. Also, you could glean additional information by reading your sun and moon, due to derivative astrology.

# Aries Rising

With the Moon in your first house, there is a desire to connect with others. There is also a focus on yourself, and how you feel about your participation in relationships. Often, Aries' risings lean so much into their independence, that they lose sight of being vulnerable and accessible to their partner. You just want to be seen and recognized, but by demanding attention, you could alienate others.

However, the moon beckons you to get in touch with your softer side. Your close relationships most likely admire your gusto, but they also like to see that you are human. During the Full Moon, you are likely to be sensitive to their feelings, they in turn, feel like you understand them. Though you may not like to slow down your pace, a gentler you could emerge during the Full Moon, without sacrificing your individuality.

**Tip:** Spend time listening to others and show warmth in your reactions. Say things like, ""I hear you"" or ""I get what you are saying"" are ways to build connection with your loved ones.

# Taurus Rising

The Moon will be in your 12th house, and you may not feel like socializing or being with others. Instead, you withdraw from the interactions and examine your feelings. You may have to deal with some emotions that you've kept hidden from others, and quite possibly yourself. This is a time when your fears come to the surface. If you have a confidant, you may choose to express your concerns to them.

Take time to meditate and go within yourself. Since Mars rules your 12th house, the actions you take can give you sudden insight. You may need to listen to your gut or intuition. But, if being still isn't working for you, do activities around the house that allows your mind and feelings to wander, such as doing a deep clean or organizing childhood photos and keepsakes.

**Tip:** If you are apt to journaling, this is a great time to do so. Also, you may want to take a walk in nature, and feel the gratitude of beauty around you.

# Gemini Rising

With the Full Moon in your 11th house, your feelings towards your friendships take center stage. You may have a strong desire to be around your friends right now, even if it is just talking to them on the phone or via a screen. There is a good chance of you expressing your love or gratitude for their friendship. In regards to needing a shoulder, you could be the person that they lean on or you may need their support at the moment.

The only thing to watch out for is jealousy, possessiveness or insecurity. Sometimes, when we feel vulnerable, we can defensively go into feelings that cause discord as opposed to connection, especially when there are multiple friends involved or a social group. Remind yourself that you are most likely dealing with feelings from the past that have nothing to do with the dynamics you are in now.

**Tip:** Say affirmations, such as ""My friends appreciate me and I appreciate them"" or ""I am happy to have a friendship with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ because we support each other.""

# Cancer Rising

With the Full Moon in your 10th house of career and public image, you could be feeling exposed or uncomfortable with your life on display. Facts about you, especially in regards to your business or personal life, may come to the surface and be seen by others. If you have nothing to hide, then this may not impact you much at all. However, if you have not been processing your emotions, you could have a public tiff with someone, most likely with a partner or loved one.

However, with this Full Moon, it could help you connect to others, especially in regards to business. If you are in sales, you could have a great day due to the ability to connect to your buyer on a personal level as long as you keep everything professional. And that is the crux of the day, personal feelings getting entangled with your career. The key here is to let your emotions flow in a positive manner and not from a perspective of woe.

**Tip:** Take deep breaths throughout the day and center your feelings. If you can, practice a minute of breathwork every hour, closing your eyes, allowing the air to fill your lungs and releasing all of the air through your mouth.

# Leo Rising

You could be tempted to call into work on the morning of or day after the Full Moon, due to a desire to get out of your routine. There could be a desire to take an impromptu trip, but most likely it would be to a place that feels familiar. You could be wanting to connect to your past, check out your stomping grounds when you were young, visit your old neighborhood or school, or go somewhere that held importance to you in your youth. The restlessness you are feeling is tied into both boredom and nostalgia.

But if you don't play hooky, the full moon may awaken a desire for you to delve into some learning, be it that of philosophy, law, religion or culture. If research or reading isn't in store for you, you could visit a restaurant that has a cuisine that is foreign to you. There is an itch to do something outside of your background, a wanting to expand your mind and soul to something that is more than the day to day.

**Tip:** If you have the opportunity to get away, then do so. But if not, seek to do something that either ties into your childhood or takes you to a new experience. My recommendation is if you've never been, check out your local Ethiopian restaurant.

# Virgo Rising

With eclipses happening in your first and seventh houses last month, the Full Moon in the eighth house is no cake walk for you. Your emotions are intense, which is not your usual experience. However, you could be drawing some special people into your life. These are the souls that may feel familiar to you, even if you have just met them. Or, you could be attracting those who see the world much differently than you, which can challenge your emotional independence, and stir up some psychological issues from the past.

This is deep energy where you may be clinging onto possession or something that is related to memories of the past. Just be careful not to be possessive of people or try to control others. This Full Moon is here to give you the opportunity to sort through what feelings are actually yours and what is associated with memories or objects. Life may feel vague right now and boundaries could be blurred. This is a time to learn about attachments and how, without realizing it, some are blocking your potential growth. While this energy is intense, it's also profoundly transformative. What you uncover about yourself now can become the foundation for deeper, more authentic connections in the future.

**Tip:** Make a list of all of the people you care about and those that are in your life. Also, write down the things you own that are not necessary, such as trinkets, objects, and non-useful possessions. Then, take time to ponder each person or item and whether or not they are part of your journey of growth and healing or are holding you back. You may want to work on this list over the next six months, which could bring you some clarity.

# Libra Rising

Being in your 7th house of relationships, the Full Moon is illuminating the people that you love. If you are in a romantic partnership or marriage, being with them now feels like home. It is as if their presence makes you feel safe and secure from the outside world. You may have a desire for tender moments, and express your love with kindness and acts of service. However, if your are insecure in your relationship, be forewarned that the Full Moon energy can bring out feelings of jealousy, so you will want to address these feelings to prevent creating strife or discord.

With that said, you could have confrontations with others if you don't get your rash emotions in check, especially with opponents or bosses. You could be so focused on getting your own way that you alienate others in the process. Underlying issues in some of your relationships can come to the surface now, so it is important not to have hasty emotional reactions. The key here is creating balance and harmony while dealing with issues by detaching from impulsivity and emotional triggers.

**Tip:** Before meetings or dealing with difficult people, take a few minutes to clear your mind, take deep breaths and ground yourself. You could play a five minute guided mini meditation to help you through your work day. Plan a romantic evening with your partner or spend time with your closest friend.

# Scorpio Rising

While many others have their emotions and inner world at the forefront, you my friend, may be repressing your feelings during this full moon. With the Full Moon in your sixth house, you may be channeling your energy into tasks and your physical health. You could feel a desire to get your home or workspace organized, or remove clutter. You may focus on eating healthy or food prep. You most likely will have a strong desire to stay busy during the Full Moon.

However, repressing your feelings can actually turn against you. What can happen is that you become critical, finding every little imperfection and fault. If you start nitpicking your partner, co-workers or friends, this can cause a disturbance in your relationships. Also, a martyr mentality can happen during this time or you may be unusually hard on yourself, with negative self-talk. Instead, when you find the need to find fault, use the Aries energy to take swift action and build confident, empowering mantras instead. The good news is that once you recognize this pattern, you can redirect that industrious energy into something that serves both you and your relationships better.

**Tip:** Instead of pushing down your feelings, allow yourself to delve into your emotions with physical work. Do something expressive, such as dancing in your living room, throw paint on a canvas or create an organization system that is both practical and fun.

# Sagittarius Rising

With the Full Moon in your 5th house, you most likely will have a difficult time sharing your feelings. With your optimistic nature and the influence of Aries, you could make confessions with ease. As long as these statements that you make are done with sincerity and authenticity and are not hurtful or cruel, you could find others to be receptive to your candor. Though you can be a flirt, you may be more flirty than usual during the Full Moon. This could lead to an intimate encounter.

The child in you tends to come out to play whenever the moon transits your 5th house, and you may enjoy the company of children, or feel especially close to your own children during this time. Your nurturing and protective instincts are high, and you may be thinking about ways to keep them safe. Just be careful not to smother or overprotect, since this could squash their own inner light. Instead, focus on activities that you can do together.

**Tip:** Focus on fun with those you love. Build a blanket fort with your kids, indulge in playtime and create a loving and lighthearted atmosphere. Take action to show others how much you care about them and tell them why you are grateful that they are in your life.

# Capricorn Rising

When the Full Moon is in the fourth house, your personal safety and comfort dominates your thoughts and your feelings coincide. You may be craving to stay at home and retire in your pajamas with a thick, fluffy blanket. However, with the Aries influence, you may be struggling with the desire to pamper yourself and your own inner strength. You may feel a bit combative, especially if you feel that someone is threatening your security.

This is why it is a good time to check into your attitudes, feelings and emotions. From the comfort of your home, you could do a dive on why you feel the way you do. Memories from childhood could bubble up, and you may have to confront past conditioning in order to deal with the present. Unlocking your precondition habits and actions, and determining their appropriateness is a good thing to do during the full moon.

**Tip:** Do you react to others, especially family members hastily? Take the time to write down the dynamics between you and your parents when you were young and examine if you are still reacting in the same way or if you have worked through the conditioning of the past.

# Aquarius Rising

With the Aries Full Moon in your third house of communication, you may have a strong desire to share information without checking the facts. If something feels like it is right to you, you may spread a lie without realizing it, especially if your ""gut"" tells you it must be right. Unfortunately, during these times, it can be quite dangerous. It is too easy to share AI generated videos, photos or news articles, because they create an emotional reaction.

With this said, much of what you do now is influenced by your past experiences. You may have a difficult time putting yourself in the other person's shoes or seeing a different perspective. You could be on cruise control, allowing your inner world to take over as opposed to using critical thought processes. You have the potential to stir up conflict between you and your extended family, friends and neighbors. The opportunity here is to pause before you communicate and ask yourself whether what you're sharing builds bridges or burns them. When you take that extra moment to verify and reflect, you strengthen rather than strain your connections.

**Tip:** Check and recheck facts before making statements or sending out communications, especially to social media. Use tools to check for AI and trusted fact checking sites as opposed to your own intuition. If you do want to share information, ask yourself, are you trying to connect with others or trying to get an emotional reaction?

# Pisces Rising

You may want to tighten your purse strings on Sunday and Monday, while the Aries Full Moon is in your second house. You are someone who has emotional attachments to some of your possessions and material items tend to make you feel a certain way. You could impulse buy during the full moon. You see a shirt at the store that reminds you of something your mother wore or a sparkly pair of earrings that is in your grandmother's aesthetic and in the cart it goes, even if the items are not your style or something that you would actually wear.

Instead, take the time to identify your emotional ties to the things you own. Not only is this a time when you want to shop, it is also when you don't want to let anything go, even if it is something you are not using. But this also has to do with your own personal values. You could be hard pressed to change your view on something now, even if the facts are there. The moon will bring out an ""it's mine"" attitude, and it won't shake loose until the moon is out of your second house.

**Tip:** Do your best to wait until a few days after the full moon to shop. Revisit the feelings you have about your values after the full moon is over. However, this is a good time to take inventory, you could have possessions that you've completely forgotten about that can bring you joy or an emotional connection to the past.

# My Personal Thoughts on the Aries Full Moon

As I was writing up the horoscopes, I found myself feeling the same tensions of the world and I was personally gaining some insight regarding the Aries-Libra polarity. 

Like many of you, I am stressed about current world and local events. Even though I am both an intuitive and an astrologer, there are times I get caught up in the energy and the activities that are happening. Occasionally, I wake up with weird or upsetting dreams (though most of the time, my dreams are about astrology) and feel disoriented. I often start articles that go nowhere, because they are immersed in emotion instead of astrological information. When I delete them or start anew, I think of what I had written prior as a journal entry or a purge of energy so that I can move forward.

The Aries energy of the Full Moon is balanced by the Libra energy of the Sun. I think it is important to keep this in mind. Aries energy is impulsive, it is the person who jumps onto the seesaw in an effort to boost up the other side. Whereas Libra is looking for equilibrium. It gently sits on the seesaw, with both feet planted on the ground, easing their weight for balance. This Full Moon is a reminder that it takes our independence and action as well as a sense of fairness and harmony to create connection with others. It is not all about ""me"" nor is it only focused on ""we."" Instead, this full moon is to teach us to stay authentic to ourselves while also being part of a relationship.

When we nurture and love ourselves, we can show up for others. Take time to reflect on themes of identity and partnerships, independence and balance, impulse and contemplation. And most of all, be grateful for the opportunity to be able to go through these changing and challenging times. We are living through a time of growth and transformation. We are figuring out how to cooperatively ride the seesaw of life.

I was trying to pick a restaurant with my friends, but Google reviews just made it worse. My cousin heard me and said to try a place she saw in IG reels. It was perfect. That's when I saw how social media gives real, quick advice that web searches don't have.

I made a simple version of an app called [Drissea](https://anylink.so/drissea?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=productivity_apps). It's an AI search tool that mixes facts from the web with ideas from Instagram and YouTube. For example, if you ask for the best coffee spot in your city for working, it gives info from websites and what people say in videos.

The app looks at reels and videos to show real reactions, like for gadgets or outfits. It also pulls facts from trusted websites. Every answer has links so you can check them yourself. You can ask more questions to dig deeper, like in a chat. And it saves your past searches for easy access.

It's free on the Play Store and App Store right now, with over 50 upvotes on Peerlist. I use it a lot, and it saves me time when I want workout tips or quick facts instead of scrolling forever.

Earlier this year I was invited to hang out with a group of my coworkers.  I work at a small local coffee shop chain, and I really like the people I work with.  Everyone in the group was someone I considered a friend.

Also important is that I show up to work with a certain... energy.  I dont think I'm really cut out for a full-time job, and simply being at work takes a toll on my mental health.  I get anxious and irritated really easily (I thankfully don't talk to customers, I'm the one baking pastries and prepping food items), but everyone I work with has always been very understanding and given me a lot of space to do my thing.  I was really excited to show them a more positive side of me!

There was one other person in the group that I didn't know, who we will call The Annoying Orange/TAO.  TAO doesn't work at the shop, but was friends with my coworker ""El,"" who had invited everyone to hang out initially.  And, as the name would suggest, she has a rather large personality.  The first time we met, I said hello, and she immediately throws flak at me for ""not putting my name in the group chat"" before asking me a bunch of rapid-fire questions about myself, none of which she lets me answer fully before steamrolling over me into stories about her own life.

And that's sort of how it went with TAO.  Whenever we would all hang out, instead of a big group conversation it would just be her monologuing non-stop with someone else getting in the occasional sentence or two.  In the entire time I hung out with this crew, I don't think I once ever got through a full thought without being interrupted.  I was kind of frustrated, because I really wanted to hang out and chat with my friends from work, but I wasn't really getting that chance.

The Annoying Orange wasn't just annoying, either.  At times she was a straight-up *asshole.* She had shit to say about my dating life, my appearance, my diet, etc. I tried a few times to tell her that I didn't appreciate the way she talked to me, but I was dismissed every time.  The best I got was ""thanks for letting me know, I won't joke about x again.... But for the record, it's not that big a deal."" She wasn't bad all the time- shes a really talented artist, and I did end up buying a piece of hers at one point, it's really good- but hanging out with her was tough.  But, I liked everyone else in the group, so I told myself that I just didn't know her that well and needed to give it time.

It came to a head one day when I went to go hiking with El, and TAO decided last minute to join us.  It went as it typically did- TAO talking nonstop, El and I getting in the occasional half-sentence.  El didn't seem to mind, but I did.  I would be trying to talk to my friend, and TAO would butt in and make herself the center of conversation again.  Towards the end of the hike TAO got really mad at someone we passed on the trail who was not following the posted rules. It was pretty justified, but I was right between them, four feet behind TAO when she whipped around and yelled at this person.  It freaked me out, and TAO saw me react to it, but instead of apologizing she just got self righteous about it and told me ""if you have a problem with me, then don't hang out with me.""

So I decided it was best to do just that, and stay away from her.  I guess I must have called her bluff though, because the few times we saw each other after the hike she tried to be friendly and chat with me like nothing had happened.  But I made it clear that I wasn't interested in what she had to say.

And that would have been it, but unfortunately distancing myself from TAO meant distancing myself from the whole group.  I reached out to some of them individually, to try to keep the friendships alive, and I hung out with some folks a few times that way. I also invited them to a party I threw and *all* of them showed up, which was really touching after everything.

Eventually thouugh, I had to come to terms with the fact that I was honestly really hurt.  Everyone else had seen the way TAO had treated me and said nothing.  And I get it, TAO is their friend too, and they don't owe me anything.  Hell, I'll even give TAO the benefit of the doubt and say that she wasn't trying to upset me.  But she did.  And it didn't feel good to see my friends laugh along with her, or at best just shrug their shoulders and make excuses for her.

I'm also not proud of the way I handled my frustrations while everything was happening.  I vented a little more than I should have to some other people in the group, and should have taken that somewhere else.  Also, the party I mentioned earlier?  I made a *point* of not only not inviting TAO, but also telling everyone I did invite to not even mention it to her.  I was trying to avoid a bunch of drama... But I'm worried I may have accidentally stirred some up.

So, now I'm back to pretty much just being coworkers with them.  I've found my way back to a good dynamic with some of them, but we don't really talk about non-work things anymore.  I don't think any of them are bad people, and I'd gladly chat with them if I ran into them out in the world, and who knows, maybe eventually we'll find a way to hang out again... But for now I need space.",1,1759608455.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a guy smoking a cigarette who looked exactly like Noel Gallagher , same clothes, same vibe. As I started talking to the crew, I saw him flick his cigarette to the ground, get into one of the SUVs looking frustrated, and yell at the roadies to hurry up.

At the time, I didn’t think much of it and walked away.

First is bean size. I noticed smaller beans make more complicated and brighter taste than bigger ones. For instance Kenya AA will taste less vibrant in comparison to AB. What’s the matter here?

Second, pre heating equipment and rinsing the filter. I noticed that I get better results when I skip on rinsing the paper and pre-heating the cup. If I pre heat everything coffee tastes anything but acidic. What is happening here? Isn’t it supposed to be the other way around?

""Be comfortable single before you start dating""","It's been nine months since the breakup, and after finding a job back in August I've finally hopped back out into the waking world, trying to get to know people both through apps and other approaches. Dating has been a mixed bag, though I can’t complain re. the topline match metrics.

But I'm hung up on advice I heard here and elsewhere, re. how it's best to date only when you're comfortable being single.

Back before my relationship, I'd have said I was comfortable being single. [This is a comment of mine](https://np.reddit.com/r/IncelExit/comments/18s1p1q/the_happiness_of_women_in_relationships/kf4stbw/?context=3) from a couple years ago on the general subject, where the two big things I ID as something I'd get out of a relationship that I can't find reliably elsewhere are a) a 2nd income and b) a committed sexual partner. Neither of those things felt like things I couldn’t live without at the time (though hell knows a 2nd income would have been great during my unemployment), and so I felt good saying that I was “comfortable being single”.

Now, post-relationship, I’m reevaluating that, and completely understand what the OP of that post was getting at re. her husband making cute hot chocolates and knowing when to bring her hot water bottles. Because I miss those aspects of the relationship I had (not to say the other stuff – like sex – was bad) – the non-sexual companionship and those little things that make each bond special and unique. The cutesy little good morning/night texts, surprising each other with a cold bottle of our favorite drink in the fridge or a fresh coffee on a weekday morning, the squeal of joy she let out when I told her I bought an icecream maker she was jealous a friend of hers had, surprising her dog with novelty treat sticks that caught my eye in the store, the opportunity to be goofy with someone in ways I couldn’t replicate with friends, planning future travel and dates not as “two buddies going to see something cool” but a shared adventure that was going to be added to the mental catalog of our shared life together...and so on.

Can I imagine a complete and fulfilling life without the above? Yeah, I think so. I’m actively working in that direction re. improving my professional standing, finishing creative projects, and putting myself out there more in broader social situations after spending most of this year penny-pinching and firing out applications. I don’t think I’m less of a man for being single. I wouldn’t consider myself particularly lonely. And there definitely were a few moments in the relationship – as short as it was – where I had to help my ex through her demons, which was hard.

But I still – broadly speaking – find myself missing being partnered. Not with her specifically (that passed in the first weeks post-breakup), but like someone who’s had a free trial of a service and now wants to lock in for longer. To reference another old post of mine, I’ve now [gone to Disneyland and understand why people enjoy it](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelExit/comments/11z3cok/anxiety_about_getting_older_with_inexperience/jdfw6dv/?context=3).

And so I’m perplexed – does me missing the above mean I’m not truly “comfortable single”? Should I work on returning to the mental state that I was pre-relationship before I start dating again in earnest? Is it even healthy (and/or possible) for me to unlearn my realization that I liked experiencing what I did in my previous relationship?

When I meet Tony Abbott, on the first warm day of spring, he arrives a few minutes late to lunch, bouncing into the cool, sky-lit back room of a ­discreet trattoria-style joint at the edge of ­Sydney’s CBD.

By Nicholas Jensen

18 min. readView original

At the back, smooth crooner music drifts through the restaurant speakers as Abbott greets me with a firm handshake and easy smile. “Good to see you, mate,” he says, slightly hunched, his feet anchored to the floor in their usual duck-splayed fashion. Dressed in a pale blue shirt and serge blazer, the former PM still cuts a lean and energetic figure, a mark of his lifelong passion for sport and exercise. These days his face appears wearier, more weather-beaten and leathery; deeper lines now trail out from the corners of his eyes, marking his passage from veteran political leader towards elder statesman. Next month he turns 68.

The reason for the lunch is to discuss the ­former PM’s new book, Australia: A History, a project he’s been working on for close to two years, and which concludes with the defeat of the Indigenous Voice to Parliament in October 2023. To my surprise, the book is hardly the withering polemic you might expect from a man who, for the best part of three decades, waged war against the political Left and burnished a reputation as one of the country’s fiercest ideological warriors.

It’s a thoughtful, almost elegiac account, ­written in the rich tradition of single-volume histories of Australia. And a glance at the book’s ­testimonials reveals a less tribal assortment of commendations than you might expect: one from former Labor leader Bill Shorten lavishes praise on his old rival for “channelling his inner Antipodean Winston Churchill”, while another from author and Sydney Morning Herald ­columnist Peter FitzSimons concedes it’s “not quite the ‘white armband’ version of Australian history” he’d anticipated.

Quite. For Australians of a certain vintage, the rise of Anthony John Abbott is usually associated with the murkier redoubts of political combat, where, as a young, pugnacious and occasionally pitiless political streetfighter, he was reared to higher office in the crucible of the Howard years. He was, by his own admission, the “junkyard dog savaging the other side”.

To people with only a passing interest in politics, Abbott is still thought of as the gaffe-prone, jug-eared, Speedo-clad PM who stopped the boats, bit into a raw onion [and wanted to “shirt-front Mr Putin”](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/mh17-grief-exacerbated-by-warm-reception-for-vladimir-putin-at-beijing-summit/news-story/539bba8a8632808b126c634d9bc43878); as the bruiser Opposition leader whom Julia Gillard denounced as a “misogynist”; as the ardent monarchist who shredded republican dreams in ’99 and restored knights and dames to the country’s honours system, precipitating his demise from the ­nation’s highest office some eight months later at the hands of Malcolm Turnbull.

And yet to a younger generation of Australians, who were children during Abbott’s time in office, he’s perhaps better recognised today as the self-styled “daggy dad” who occasionally pops into their social media feeds as a volunteer firefighter or surf lifesaver. Last month, footage uploaded to TikTok and Instagram showed the former PM in a shirt and tie holding up a faulty boom gate inside a busy Sydney car park, allowing motorists to exit. Is Tony Abbott now a meme? The comments varied from “A firie, a surf lifesaver and now a traffic cop? Truly a man of the people!” to “Bushfire CFA volunteer, surf lifesaver … he does a lot more civil service than most pollies”. Abbott himself entered the chat, posting the tongue-in-cheek response: “Finally found my calling.” “Wish he was still PM,” came a nostalgic comment on Instagram.

Days before our interview, I consult this newspaper’s editor-at-large, Paul Kelly, who has, it could be said, seen the full arc of Tony Abbott’s public life. They first met when Abbott wrote editorials at The Australian in the late 1980s – that was after he’d left St Patrick’s ­seminary and abandoned his plans to join the Jesuit priesthood. (Earlier in his life, Abbott had studied Economics and Law at the University of Sydney, and won a Rhodes scholarship to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford.) I ask Kelly how he would describe the former member for Warringah. He tells me this: “People have no idea about Tony Abbott. He is a mass of contradictions. He is a journalist by nature. He is obsessed by history. He is a genuine intellectual and scholar. He is a romantic, in thrall to the great Australian project. But this identity remains concealed, hidden throughout his political career. On the one hand he is the former seminarian, the scholar-statesman; on the other he is the Blues boxer and the ultimate political brawler.”

When I test this appraisal with Abbott, ­saying only that it came from a colleague, he concurs. “I think your colleague has accurately discerned different aspects of me,” he replies. “Most significant people are a mixture of things, and different personae can coexist within the same individual. Now, I guess different circumstances bring out different aspects of their character and personality.

“As a journalist, I was a frustrated politician. As a politician, I was a frustrated journalist … In the end, if you’ve got a passion for public life, it’s got to be about making a difference. And sure, you make a difference as a legislator, as a policy maker, as part of an executive government – but you also make a difference by telling what you think are the important stories, making what you think are the important arguments. Because, as Keynes famously said, practical men are the slaves of long-forgotten economists.”

Lunch with Tony Abbott? It’s a funny thing, telling people you’re about to interview ­Australia’s 28th prime minister. The first ­response you get is a mixture of surprise and bewilderment. “What else is there left to say about him?” asks one bemused colleague. “What does he actually do these days?” inquires another, genuinely curious.

I ask Abbott about his post-politics life. Surely a posting to London or Washington might have been options in the decade since he was PM – why the apparent lack of interest? “That’s because I’m a very undiplomatic ­person,” he replies, almost before I’ve finished the question.

And yet, something almost as unlikely has happened, at least for a former prime minister. Abbott has written a history – albeit predominantly a political history – complete with a ­pastoral painting by colonial artist George ­Edwards Peacock on the cover. There’s a ­documentary in the works, too, and of course our interview, conducted over shared courses of seafood stew, yellowbelly flounder and pork sausage.

Explore Australia's history is a landmark three-part Sky News documentary presented by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott. From the ancient traditions of Arnhem Land to the bustling streets of modern Cabramatta, the series traces the pivotal moments that shaped Australia’s identity. Abbott embarks on a deeply personal journey, exploring the triumphs, struggles, and transformations that forged our nation, from Sydney Cove to the Eureka Stockade, and from early settlement to a thriving multicultural democracy. Spanning over three nights, this special event provides a powerful reflection on Australia’s past, its current challenges, and its vision for the future.

A photoshoot will follow later at Curl Curl beach at sunset, when Abbott will immerse himself in water that’s still winter-frigid – all in the service of promoting his book, and the ­national project known as Australia.

Today, almost a week to the decade since he was deposed as PM, we’re at Vin-Cenzo’s, not far from Darlinghurst’s little Italy. Despite the punny name, there will be no wine at this lunch; from the outset it’s clear Abbott is focused on the book and doesn’t want any diversions. “I want the book to stand alone as a work of ­history,” he explains cautiously. “I don’t want this book just to be an excuse for Tony Abbott to pontificate on contemporary problems … I don’t want people to judge it too much in terms of their judgments of me as a politician.”

The reason for writing the book, he says, is to arrest the alarming decline in historical ­literacy across the country and rebalance it towards a more generous appraisal of Australia’s past. Of course, this counts as radical optimism today. And in Australia it seems to be an inherently fraught proposition. Abbott’s view is that it shouldn’t be, and we probably can’t move ­forward until it’s not.

Says Abbott in his book: “As this account has also endeavoured to show, individuals do make a difference. For better or worse, the world changes person by person. Australia is a land built by heroes, both known and ­unknown. Each generation’s challenge is to be worthy of them and to build on their mighty legacy so that our best days as a nation might still be ahead.”

There is a duality at play here, a shifting back and forth in tone. If the book is circumspect and at times remorseful, in person Abbott’s zeal for the project is often in sharp relief. “What Geoffrey Blainey called the ‘black armband view’ back in the early ’90s is, if anything, much worse today,” he says. “Now the general tenor of public debate is that we have far more to be ashamed of than proud; that our country has been marked by dispossession, racism, even genocide … I’m not saying we’re perfect, and I’m not saying our history is without blemishes, but on balance it is such a good story.”

’I’m not saying we’re perfect, and I’m not saying our history is without blemishes, but on balance it is such a good story.’ Picture: James Horan

It’s a sentiment we’ve partly heard before: Abbott has long railed against what he sees as political interference in the nation’s history curriculum, chiding the academic Left for its vandalistic attempts to reduce the country’s past – particularly its colonial past – into a grim conspectus dominated by acts of violence and prejudice. Instead, he finds much to admire in the ­Australian story. His book is dotted with vivid portraits of heroes and heroines. He lauds the benevolence of the early governors and their refusal to embrace military dictatorship. He ­salutes the anti-authoritarian spirit of the early convicts and emancipationists – a view, he says, that’s unusual for a conservative – and venerates the intellectual dynamism of the founding fathers, who hammered out the path towards Federation.

“If one tries to take a panoramic view of ­Australian history, the first 100 years were ­incredibly successful,” Abbott says, relaxing into conversation. “I mean absolutely, almost incandescently, brilliant.

“Then, of course, there’s the depression of the 1890s, and that decade knocked the stuffing out of us. The Federation Drought was a real problem. The Great War was psychologically devastating, even though we came out of it with a burnished national story. The 1920s and ’30s were depressed decades. And I think the ’50s, ’60s, ’70s, ’80s and ’90s were a period of recovery and revival.”

Breaking his flow, a waitress arrives at our table. We’re yet to consult the menu – which tempts with such delicacies as mortadella stuffed agnolotti in brodo – and she waits patiently before recommending the restaurant’s main sharing dishes. “That’ll be great, thank you,” replies Abbott, focus unwavering.

What emerges from the book is no whitewash, but rather a sense of the triumph of liberalism on the long road to Federation. A passage about Aboriginal disenfranchisement and dispossession in the lead-up to and the first decade after Federation culminates in the words: “This crushing of human dignity in the name of ‘protection’ only began to change with the liberal revival after the Second World War.”

I’m keen to press the former PM on his passages about Indigenous Australians, specifically his assessment of settler violence on the frontier – Abbott devotes considerable space to the massacres of Indigenous Australians, including detailed accounts of Myall Creek and Coniston, which he describes to me as “the nearest thing to a serious blot on our national escutcheon”.

Australia: A History.

“What can’t be denied,” he writes early in the book, “is that frontier life was brutal and dangerous, and that Aboriginal people suffered grievously.” Indigenous Affairs formed a significant part of his political career ever since he first travelled to Alice Springs in the mid-1990s as a junior minister in the Howard Government. When I suggest that frontier violence is a subject he goes out of his way to “highlight” in the book, he interjects: “Well, to examine.”

“This is what the critics turn to and this is what is so much emphasised in the study of Australian history today,” he continues. “And look, it was very real. There was considerable violence on the frontier, but that’s not the whole story, and it was never official policy. That’s why it’s quite wrong to talk about ‘frontier wars’, because the concept of a war involves deliberate prosecution. There was never any deliberate prosecution of systematic violence against Aboriginal people.”

Does he think the public has misunderstood his commitment to Aboriginal Australians ­because of his plainspoken views on contemporary Indigenous affairs, or perhaps his strong opposition to the Voice referendum?

His response is measured. “Look, I take a pretty tough line on these things,” he says, with a little more edge to his voice. “As Noel Pearson always used to say, if Indigenous people are to flourish they have to be capable of operating in modern Australia. And, yes, that should not mean sacrificing their Aboriginality or forgetting the high culture of their clans. But they’ve got to have a decent education; they’ve got to develop a work culture.”

As we negotiate the shared dishes, now spread across the lunch table, I’m curious to know how Abbott handled the potentially fraught transition within the book. That is, from a dispassionate historian, observing the past at a distance, to a writer seeking to ­narrate more recent events, often ones in which he’s been a decisive player. In some ­respects, it’s the closest thing to a memoir of his prime ministership.

“The difference between this and anything else I’ve written is that everything else I’ve written has essentially been a piece of advocacy,” says Abbott. “I try to be dispassionate, even in the last chapter, although it’s probably obvious I have some strong views about things.”

The Gillard speech is there: “Gillard … had a rhetorical triumph with her ‘misogyny’ speech directed at me, in the parliament, in ­October 2012, which went ‘viral’ even though it was clearly an attempt to deflect an attack on her handpicked parliamentary speaker’s sexual harassment of a staffer.”

And Turnbull, of course. “In September 2015, harnessing backbench anxiety about poor polls, claiming that there’d been too many ‘captain’s calls’, playing on concerns about ‘climate ­denial’ and offering several junior ministers promotion to cabinet, he persuaded a majority of the Liberal party room to[ inflict on itself the same destructive political cannibalism it had earlier witnessed on the other side](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/inquirer/howard-costello-abbott-tell-libs-to-stand-up-now-or-risk-losing-more-ground/news-story/0650ce9ab13e8e7f4b2ad85a8789e4e3).”

But ultimately, he devotes fewer than two pages to his own prime ministership. “I’m under no illusions about my own place in history, mate,” he tells me. “I mean the 28th prime ­minister is always going to be the 28th. In terms of making a difference, Hawke and Howard made a huge difference … I certainly don’t ­regard myself as having anything like their place in our public life.”

‘I’m under no illusions about my own place in history, mate’ Picture: Mick Tsikas

I ask whether he struggled to articulate the vision of Australia he sets out in the book while he was PM. “When you are at the pinnacle of the executive government, there are a whole lot of things you just have to deal with, and often they’re insignificant things in the great sweep of history, which nevertheless dominate the day. There might be a scandal. It might be something as silly as, you know, knighting Prince Philip, and so the background noise can often obscure the overall objective or the intent.”

In his foreword to the book, historian Geoffrey Blainey notes the unexpected pluralism within, writing: “In his reading list are many books written by authors who, being of another political colour to Abbott, will be surprised to find themselves quoted. Further, some political opponents at times are patted on the head rather than punched on the nose: Abbott when young was a boxer. For instance, high praise is offered to Kim Beazley, who happened to lead the Labor Party when Abbott was a political apprentice in Canberra. Paul Keating is praised as a strong debater, though less as a policymaker.”

Continuing the theme of former PMs, I take the opportunity to ask Abbott who was better, Curtin or Hawke? Hawke, no question. Menzies or Howard? “I’d say Howard,” he replies. “I think Howard was more counter-cultural than Menzies. There’s no doubt Menzies was an ­extraordinary, towering figure. I can’t imagine anyone will ever be prime minister again for 16 continuous years, but Howard was a long-serving and successful prime minister in the teeth of fierce opposition, whereas Menzies was lucky in that the times were more benign, and the Labor split basically gave him 10 years that he probably wouldn’t otherwise.”

Howard, for his part, describes the book as “balanced” and praises his erstwhile parliamentary attack dog as “a wordsmith” in the book’s testimonials – the first of 11, which also include praise from “the best PM there never was” Kim Beazley, Liberal backbencher Jacinta Price, ­federal Independent MP Dai Le and former international cricketer Brett Lee.

Throughout our lunch Abbott is friendly and self-deprecating, unafraid to send himself up. He talks passionately about the writing of his history. At times, though, especially when discussing his own party’s catastrophic election defeat this year, he appears resigned, a touch deflated; in other moments he leans forward in his chair, buzzing with a sort of condensed ­energy. When he speaks he does so slowly, often nodding along in a gentle staccato, his chin tilted slightly upwards. Occasionally he raises his hands, almost like a conductor, ­tentatively marking his words. Lugubrious ­introspection does not suit his personality. ­Despite his deep anxieties for the nation, he presents as a reluctant optimist.

His book’s dedication reads: “To my grandchildren, Ernest, Romona and Angus, and the new generation that should take our country ­forward.”

Abbott, who was born in London to an ­Australian mother and a father from northern England, and who moved to Australia when he was two, in a sense embodies the Australia he depicts; his values spring from almost every page. He casts the Australian story as a synthesis of three elements: an Indigenous heritage, a British foundation and an immigrant character. His belief in the British Empire and Anglosphere is well known – an arrangement he thinks is eminently preferable to any of today’s supranational institutions, such as the European Union or the United Nations.

“The British Empire was a collection of ­independent dominions under the crown with common values and largely common interests,” Abbott tells me. “Now that’s a wonderful thing to be part of … But this idea that we should ­submit ourselves to some kind of supranational entity, I think, is incredibly unappealing. As far as the principal players in the EU are concerned, it was always a political project. And the interesting thing is that the one major European country that has nothing to be ashamed of in its 20th-century history is Britain. The French effectively lost two wars, and then there was the whole Pétain thing \[a reference to France’s wartime collaborationist Vichy regime\]. The Italians had fascism, the Germans had Nazism and the Spanish had Francoism. So for all of the major countries of Europe, the EU was, in a sense, an act of atonement. It was burying their national identity as a way of expunging the past and kind of exorcising the demons. That’s why Britain was never well suited to the EU and is so much better off out of the joint.”

Given he’s written a book titled Australia, I feel compelled to ask Abbott about the future of the nation state. Can he imagine a future in which a stable country like Australia could splinter into national crisis? The answer suggests a divided nation. “I think the vast majority of Australians still have a strong sense of Australia and have a deep affection for Australia. I think the official class is very ambivalent.”

And what about in a time of conflict – does he think young Australians would fight for the country? “It’s a very good question. I think when the chips are down, yes, but so much would depend upon leadership. For instance, Ukraine was a torn country, or was supposed to be a torn country. It’s become a whole country, but that’s essentially because of the leadership of Zelensky. Imagine if Zelensky had got into a helicopter and pissed off? It would have been a totally different story.

“When I talk to young Australians I am ­invariably surprised at how unaffected by the national angst they are, and I come away enthused and more optimistic for the future. So I suspect the coming generation will do better than my generation in terms of nation building.”

Still, it’s evident the former PM thinks the country is in a bad way. When I ask him to select another era from Australian history that most resembles our own, he suggests the post-WWI era of the 1920s, a period he describes in a chapter titled “A Funereal decade”.

More recently, he’s blamed the national ­insouciance on a weakening sense of cultural self-confidence and a failure of political leadership. Across newspaper columns, television, podcasts, a busy international speaking schedule and the online media platform Substack, he ­remains a familiar and influential figure of the Right. He currently serves on the board of Fox Corporation and is a director at The Ramsay Centre for Western Civilisation.

A waiter arrives to take our plates [and ­conversation turns to immigration ](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/tony-abbott-calls-for-immigration-cut-back-as-permanent-program-unveiled/news-story/f20548b4aea482d00eac7caca0952582)– the third branch of our national identity – and the recent pro-Palestinian demonstrations across the country. “I think the people marching across the bridge included lots of Australians whose ancestry in this country stretches back many generations, as well as lots of recent migrants. But I think they misunderstand what Australia is on about, and we’re not on about religious ­fanaticism. We’re not on about cultures that discriminate on the basis of gender and race and ethnicity.”

What does he think when he sees placards at demonstrations inscribed with “Death to Australia” and describing Australia as a fascist and colonial state? Abbott laughs that distinctive crow and then turns serious. “Well, plainly they’re false. No one who understands what fascism is, or who has ever lived in a fascist state, would accuse us of being a fascist state. And we were lucky in that we were a product of the most ­benign empire that ever existed. My anxiety is that empires might not all be a thing of the past, and that any future empire that might extend its tentacles to us would be nothing like the ­benign one under which we began.”

It’s a recurrent theme laced throughout ­Abbott’s history, beginning with the anti-­Chinese immigration restrictions of the mid-to-late 19th century. Of the waves of postwar immigration to Australia, he writes that today “Australians take for granted living in a multi-ethnic society, something that would have been unthinkable almost everywhere a century ago”.

“I don’t think we have anything like the same clear sense of immigration today,” he continues. “To the extent there is an official rationale for it, I don’t think the public are as confident as they were then. Officially, they would say of immigration, ‘Look, every migrant makes us economically stronger. Every migrant makes us culturally richer.’ That may be true in many cases, but I don’t think the public thinks it’s true in every case today, and that’s part of the current national despondency.”

‘I always said that at some point in time I would end up back as a writer.’ Picture: James Horan

There’s no question he has grown increasingly pessimistic about the immigration program, advocating for a much smaller intake. Last month, as Liberal senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price faced public scrutiny over her ­comments on Indian migrants, Abbott wrote an opinion piece in The Australian saying no ­citizen should feel restricted discussing immigration policy. “In all the Anglosphere countries,” he argued, “recent migrants are filling the entry-level jobs that locals are reluctant to do. As well, in all of them, immigration is substituting for the children that the native-born seem reluctant to have.”

Abbott tells me: “Australia can absolutely flourish as a multi-ethnic society, but only if we emphasise that very strong civic patriotism which unites people around, I suppose, values and institutions … this is what America did very well until recently, and we’ve done very well up till now. The multiculturalism project could easily go way off the rails.”

Coffee arrives. He has definitely ruled out a diplomatic career post-politics, but what about business? Unlike other Liberal politicians of the same era, including Joe Hockey, Josh Frydenberg, Scott Morrison and Christopher Pyne, Abbott appears entirely uninterested. “I’m more than happy to accept speaking fees so long as they’re not from Communist Chinese sources!” he says, with his trademark laugh.

Still, it’s hard to believe someone like Abbott does not harbour ambitions of a return to politics. For all the thoughtful, considered analysis in his book, our interview shows one thing – Tony Abbott’s values are as sharply drawn as ever, in thrall, as Kelly says, to “the great ­Australian project”. Now he’s just looking for new ways to express them.

Says Abbott: “I always said that at some point in time I would end up back as a writer. And I guess that’s what I am these days, a sort of writer and speaker.” Will his late-career shift to public intellectual be successful? As with most things, it will probably fall to the next ­generation to judge.

He leaves with a cheery wave, and as I settle the bill a waitress in her early twenties ­confesses that she had recognised Abbott, though she couldn’t quite place him. “I said, ‘Nice to see you again’,” she confides. “I thought he was a regular I’d seen before. Then I realised I knew him from TV.”

In a new history of Australia, the former prime minister has written a fresh perspective on the story of our great nation. Even his harshest critics are impressed.When I meet Tony Abbott, on the first warm day of spring, he arrives a few minutes late to lunch, bouncing into the cool, sky-lit back room of a ­discreet trattoria-style joint at the edge of ­Sydney’s CBD. I’m already installed in a quiet corner of the restaurant, so I don’t see the ­reaction of guests as he walks through the door apart from a group of four businessmen, ­chatting boisterously near the front, who fall ­silent before an exuberant holler goes up: “Hey, Tony!” And in his characteristic way, he ­responds: “G’day fellas.”",1,1759607334.0,aussie,0,1.0,False

1ny3i37,https://www.reddit.com/r/NickelAllergy/comments/1ny3i37/hot_beverages_with_diagnosed_nickel_allergy/,🍵 ☕️ Hot beverages with diagnosed nickel allergy,"I’ve struggled with eczema and inflammation since I was a teen, now in my 30s. After dozens of dermatologists over the years and lots of steroid creams, I finally requested/found through patch testing I have a nickel allergy. My eczema has been getting worse every year, so I’m ready to address with a low nickel diet.

I have the shortlist of “avoid” foods — chocolate really breaks my heart, I have a piece of dark chocolate often as dessert. I adore avocados on a slice of Ezekiel toast. Pretty much all bad combos for nickel. 

But the morning ritual of a hot beverage — coffee, or oat milk matcha, followed in the afternoon by black tea, is what I’m really struggling with.

Matcha has such a unique taste — but is there anything else that hits the spot like it? Especially that has antioxidants too? 

Black tea — what comes close to this flavor profile that I could try? Any favorites?

Oat milk —  Cow’s milk gives me stomachaches, so  I bought rice milk and coconut milk (Califia brand). But now I’m reading that coconut milk is also high nickel?

Coffee — I’m seeing Kona is a no go, but is coffee more of a grey area than matcha?

I went to the grocery store and stocked up on rooibos, and some herbal blends, but it’s just not the same :( 

👀What about Yerba Mate? 

TL;DR Would love to know if anyone has successfully replaced their hot beverage ritual with things they love!

Edit: added Yerba mate ",4,1759607057.0,NickelAllergy,7,1.0,False

The 24-120 F/4 is an awesome lens, but I usually keep it on my desk unless I know I want to bring it along. So, the other day, I came home and sat at my desk and plopped down a mug. I started doing some scrolling on the computer and reached over without looking. I try to take a sip, and ended up with my lips on the plastic edge of the lens cap! The lens feels and looks a lot like a heavy thermal mug of something if I'm not paying attention...

1ny3fb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mead/comments/1ny3fb4/for_coffee_i_use_remineralized_ro_water_is/,"For coffee, I use remineralized RO water. Is remineralized RO water also good for mead?","Where I live the water is very hard, \~400ppm, and chlorinated, so I use remineralized RO water for making coffee. I add a bit of baking soda and epsom salts to remineralize the RO water from \~0 ppm to \~100 ppm, following ""Recipe 4 – Barista Hustle Water Recipe"" from:

[https://www.baristahustle.com/diy-water-recipes-the-world-in-two-bottles/](https://www.baristahustle.com/diy-water-recipes-the-world-in-two-bottles/)

  
For coffee, the gist is this helps extract more soluble material, and prevents off flavors from chlorine etc. This is widely accepted as the gold standard starting place for people looking to protect espresso machines from scale formation and have the cleanest tasting cup, compared to tap water.

  
I'm now starting to make mead. Most recipes commonly say to buy spring water from the store and use that for mead, and I'm guessing that's for the same reasons as coffee - clearer flavor, less off flavors, and maybe healthier fermentations. However I think the remineralized RO water should be perfectly fine, and while there may be less mineral variety compared to spring water, I think they should be approximately equal.



Are there any downsides to using the same remineralized water recipe for making mead?",1,1759606868.0,mead,1,1.0,False

1ny39ro,https://i.redd.it/ezquebjed5tf1.png,"Very Short Fall Femme Shaved Bob High Off Nape, Collar & Ears Just Like The Models Bob","Very thankful of this group connecting with others who are like minded and have the same short hair femme shaving fetish and exploring what it looks & feels like to get and wear femme styles. My stylist has been on vacation for the last month, choose not to go to anther salon, as of this week been almost 6 weeks, longest between haircuts I've ever gone since she first bobbed me 5+ years ago and have about 20-25mm of hair hair under my napeline which makes it feel more like a ""normal ""haircut so much so I was planning on telling her lets just blend it up my nape for a more ""regular"" guys look. Back in her chair she runs her comb over my hair and comments how much of a difference 6 weeks makes, asks me if I'm ready for a short fall femme bob & fresh black perm color, shows me some pics of my last hc and what she wants to do. Just hearing her say she thinks its fall femme made me feel overwhelmed with emotion, scared, nervous but intrigued, part of me holding back not wanting to ask her if this style would look good on me because of going through adjusting to the drastic change. Then I looked at the pic she showed me on her phone (top pic in this image), she was watching me study it then asked if I was wondering if it would look nice on me, told her yes, she smiled as she said yes hun, it would, you definitely have the hair for it, I could make yours look very close to the models, lots of skin showing right up to your weight line and fresh perm color would really make it stand out,

I could feel the nervousness & stress inside it was causing me holding back just because of what some unknown strangers might think who see me in public or how I would look & feel trying to adjust to it then while I was processing it all in my mind, looking at the pic, seeing her short shaved bob, all the different pairs of clippers she had ready to go at her station, fixated on those pink Oster 76's, got a tingly feeling of butterflies in my stomach seeing myself caped in the chair in thin baggy skirt pants flowing over he sides of the chair and lightweight fall turtleneck with the collar she had carefully rolled down under the cape...seconds seemed like minutes until I looked up directly in her eyes and said please give me the short fall femme bobbed bowlcut like the models,.as she turned to her station to pick up the clippers got a direct view of how short and high shaved her nape was, like she trimmed it up the day before just for me??, that made me want it even more as she picked up those big pink Oster 76's, spins the chair around so the cord will reach, heard the loud whirring as she snapped them on and as they hit my hair and nape I felt a huge sigh of relief, just love that point of no return feeling, with each pressing of the clippers on my nape and hair falling off I felt more relief and just blurted out, please shave mine very short and precision just like the models pic.

Been a few days now, feels and looks so extreme femme, no way to change it or style it, stays how she shaved it all the time. Women in my jogging, yoga, & exercise group and the office love it say the way she cut & shaved my napeline makes my nape look more slender & feminine, (they have had enough of me commenting on those who have short shaved bobs telling them they should go a lot shorter), supervisor loves it, says business professional hope you maintain it this way (winks, might get you some brownie points on your end of year performance review) feels even more bare & expose under the bright office lights, she informed me they provide an inclusive work environment, let her know if anyone says anything negative or derogatory, HR will promptly address it.

Would I do it again, yes definitely, have appointments scheduled out through the end of he year, every 2 weeks and she said if I need a nape/bob line reshaving in between, for the weekend, special event, like it reshaved more often just drop by no appt needed it'll take me 5 minutes to clean up your nape. Overall so glad she is so suggestive and convinced me to just let her do it, I knew if I didn't I'd regret it the minute I walked out the salon, especially if I saw a similar haircut while out and about, stores, bookstore, coffee shop, jogging, pilates, yoga and especially in he office where I spend the most time during the week with women of which whom 2 in my dept have very short shaved bobs and a few others longer bobs, it would drive me crazy wanting to feel those clippers on my nape, dramatically changing my appearance, demeanor and how it makes me feel, was time for a fresh fall reset!

Anyone else wear a shrot shaved bob? How's it make you feel, mine stays shaved n bobbed looking salon fresh all the time, regular nape reshaves, makes me look & feel so femme, even if I don't want to and change out of the femme baggy skirt pants and top to casual outfit for the day the women say it still screams femme and enjoy watching me fidget with my hair moving thicker longer top hair around does nothing, falls right back into place, into a neatly precision shaved bob with pale white razor shaved feminine looking nape.",1,1759606503.0,RainbowFashion,0,1.0,False

My Saturday plans just imploded, so instead of doom-scrolling, I figured I'd shout into the void and see who or what shouts back. Dating apps make me want to curl up in a ball and cry, but I miss sharing life's little moments—from an unexpected laugh to the first bite of warm, fresh bread. I'm happily single but not lonely, just realizing that life is better when it's shared.

I'm an Irishman living in the US for the last few years. I still consider Ireland home and get back once or twice a year to visit family (and yes, you'd have a free place to stay if things progressed and you ever fancied a trip!). I've got the passport, the accent (it's genuine, I promise), and a good bit of that disarming Irish humour.

I stay pretty active by cycling and hiking, and I try to get in a good walk whenever I can instead of driving. I love being intentional with my downtime, whether that's an extra long gym session or a morning spent reading on the couch with a coffee.

I make a killer chocolate cake, my soda bread will insult your tastebuds (in the best way), and my roast potatoes are a life-changing experience. I love to feed people so If you like fresh bread or cookies, I've got you covered.

I’m always open to book, movie, or TV recommendations. I just finished two books and need to pick out what to read next so please reach out with any recommendations.
The most Irish thing about me? My profound, insatiable love for potatoes.

I’m not looking for anything specific. I'm trying not to have any big expectations. A lasting distraction from the mundane would be brilliant. I'm open to anything that brings a laugh and good conversation—whether that's just a few hours of witty banter, a chat to help me procrastinate on chores, a new friendship, or maybe, eventually, a bit more (yes, I've still got a good bit of making out left in me).

If you reach out, please save us both some time and don't ask me about: Corned beef and cabbage, leprechauns or my ""Lucky Charms.""

1ny38h7,https://www.reddit.com/r/aitaweddings/comments/1ny38h7/we_got_married_last_saturday_and_i_feel_like_im/,"We got Married last Saturday, and I feel like im regretting the whole thing because of his parents","I've unfortunately had a rocky relationship with his parents from the very beginning, but thought we had all grown past it. When my partner and i met, we both said we were ok with never getting married, this day in age the idea of getting married just seems so blown out of proportion, expensive, and the chanced of divorce is so high. When we met I was living with my parents trying to help them keep the family house, as they were losing everything. We had gotten together and went through some VERY hard times from the get go, I got really sick, and ended up fighting to get on disability, leading my partner to change career paths as I was the full time worker, and he was parttime. My dad got very sick with stage 4 cancer, and his parents weren't very sympathetic. When we first moved out on our own, they got us an airfrier for a housewarming gift, then refused to talk to us, feeling like their son will be forced to come back home (I'd like to state my partner insisted with moving out with me, I needed to get my own place because my dad was sick, and fighting with my mom, I was getting bullied at work, and whenever I'd go to Destros place, his parents would make snarky comments, and keep inviting his ex over to visit, I felt like I had no safe space to go). 


So his parents were no help at the beginning, which is fine. What wasnt fine was the comments they would make about me and my illness, or some shots his mom made about my sick father. Destro and I love eachother so much, and stayed strong through all of it. My dad's health went downhill very fast at the end, and he ended up in the hospice at the same time Destros dad ended up with a brain tumor, which was a very difficult time for everyone, but his mom made some very ignorant and damaging comments... to this day she's never said sorry, just acted like she never said any of it. But the reason im focusing on my dad's illness, is because he was extreamly catholic, and really wanted ine of his kids to get married, it was one of his biggest dreams, and Destro asked for permission to marry me on the day my dad passed, he was so happy and excited, telling the nurses ""thats my son in law"". It was very beautiful and heartbreaking.


 That was 5 years ago, and last year Destro proposed to me while we were camping with his parents. It was funny how things played out, his mom wasn't being very subtle and wr could hear her phone clicking as she was starting and stopping the recording. I figured things had gotten better. His parents seemed very excited, and offered for us to use their achreag as a venue, which I thought would be perfect, I didnt want anything large or extravagant, we are on a fixed income, and I black out at random, so I wanted something simple, small and more persional. I didnt grow up dreaming of my wedding day, nor had I really attended any, so I went in VERY blind to what needed to be done, but I decided Destro and I love to play video games together, we both grew up with a favorite video game (I grew up watching my dad play Banjo Kazooie/Tooie with my mom, and Destro learned to read while playing Legend of Zelda) and when we got together we got very into Monster Hunter together, so i wanted out theme to be white with black outlines to look cartoony, I tried my hand at cosplay, made our favorite monster hunter weapons which are comically large, thrifted a wedding dress for $100, got Destro a cheap white suit and painted them to match this simple yet fun theme, and themed our invites around it. Once it got to decorations, I found some cool stuff on Temu, but most things I'd thrift and paint them, but his mom kept going and buying stuff that didnt match our theme, but I would just smile and thank her. I was grateful she wanted to help, and it was at her place, they were already doing so much. Same with Music, i was more thank happy to just borrow my brothers speakers and use spotify, and she kept insisting on a DJ, i kept saying no, we had a $2,000 budget, and the DJ alone was 1,200, but she kept insisting, then said that they both were offering to pay for the DJ, which at that point i felt obligated to accept.


 Long story short, she took control, which I didn't mind, I felt very lost on everything, but I was happy to come over and paint things with her, my family always has ""coffee parties"" in the evenings where we will all sit and visit with eachother, sometimes bake, or work on a craft for someone who wants to try making something, my family is full of crafty people.  They offered to come over  to his parents place insead in the evenings to help, but by time we would get there, she would have finished everything that i had planned for the day/night, and sit in the corner quietly. On my birthday we were just going to bring a cake, and do that while helping prep everything, she said she got sick, and to stay away. We tried to move our visits to earlier in the day since that worked better for her, but she would make some excuse for us to not come over, and I mean, its her space, we arent going to force ourselves there when she says not to. 


2 weeks before the wedding, my 1 grandma passed away, his mom knew that, as I had been taking some time here and there to go visit her in the hospice, not as much as I'd have liked, because I was busy with wedding stuff, but she still knew what was going on. And I was pre devistated when she passed, and I had to put my vows in the back burner to help my family wright eulogies. The vows weren't a huge deal, I had 3 drafts already, but i was nowhere near what I wanted between the last minute DJ addition, and having all our photos get scanned into PSD's instead of PNGs, and trying to make a music list. I spent MANY sleepless nights trying to get things done in a timely manner.

 On the Saturday before our wedding, we were to go pick up alcohol, then Sunday to the race tracks, as his mom knew the owners and they offered for us to buy the rest of their food for the season for a reduced price; monday was my grandmas viewing, and tuesday the funeral, his dad was to come home on the evening of tuesday, so wensday was a off day so he could relax, and thursday was to tie everything together before the rehersal on Friday. We'll on that friday the week before, I had some crafts at my mom's because we wanted to get stuff done, and his mom kept making excuses, so we still did a meet up, and my aunt brought her dog, which  our dogs know eachother, and have played before, so it shouldn't have been a big deal, but it had been a long time, and unfortunatly a dog fight happened, i broke all the nails off of my right hand grabbing my dog to split up the fight, my grandma kept screaming about how she's always been terrified of my dog, and it was a very explosive moment. So the next morning I was very stressed because I was worried my aunt and grandma hated me for what happened.


 My mom drove me to the achreag as she was going to help with things while his mom and I quickly ran to get alcohol. Well his mom had drapes on the ceiling (Destro went on the scissorlift before he left town for work, and stapled them down the middle, and was going to finish once he got home on wensday) and she went on the ladder alone and was putting the drapes up, which looked tight. I didnt like that she was doing that without supervision, as her spine is pretty bad, and what if she fell, I just made a comment about ""they look tight, maybe we should wait till Destro gets home to finish them"" she got upset and disappeared, I didnt even know, I was sitting there making an alcohol list, and I had steamed my reception dress before we came up, so I figured while I waited for her, I'd go hang it with the wedding dress in Destros old room. When I came up, I noticed she was upstairs in the kitchen smoking, so I asked if everything was ok, she said no, so I went up, and sat with her to talk things over. She said that I pissed her off by saying the drapes looked like shit (which I didnt say) and that im ungrateful and ignorant with no respect for her and her husband's time. The reason she was doing everything before my family and I would get out was because she wanted everything done before he got home. I validated her feelings and said sorry, and that I didn't mean for anything to come off that way. She said she's fucking had it with me, and refuses to do anything today like getting the alcohol. I said thats fine, we can get it another day, and asked if she would like us to go, or if we could finish what we were doing before we left, she said she doesn't fucking care. So I said sorry again, and went back out to the shop, got my mom to finish painting what she was painting, and I took a chest I wanted to paint for a photo prop outside to paint, we still stayed for 3 hours to finish what we needed, she never came back out. Which was fine, before we left we cleaned up, but I couldn't figure out how to turn their radio off, so I peeked my head in the door, said sorry again for what I said, and said I locked up but couldn't figure the radio out; nothing, so i assumed she went to sleep.


 So I went home, called destro, he helped me word a text to her, which was essentially the things I called into the house about before we left. No response. The next morning ing she said ""____(name of race tracks owner) said to meet her there at 2"" which i was terrified as I dint know these people, they are her friends, and the freezer all the food was to go in was out at the achreag... so I didnt respond. I called around my family to see who had free freezer space until everything with his mom blew over, and my mom and sister came with me to help me talk with the owners and help load the stuff up, I couldn't have done it without them. Heard nothing from his mom after that until Monday evening/tuesday morning, at 12:40am, my mom and I were at my place still working on stuff that we took with us to finish when we left the shop on SatSaturdawe were going to finish it, then go to bed for the funeral in the morning, my mom and I are pre nocturnal, and work better at night. Well his mom started texting me a list of people i need to contact and shit what needs to get done, and that shes dine nothing, and refuses to until i get my head out of my ass and decide what i want... i was beside myself, and started having a panic attack, my mom said she refused to leave me in that state, so it was either the emergency or her place... it was almost 3am before I was good enough to walk to her car, and we had the funeral at 11am. His mom KNEW I had a funeral Tuesday morning, and she KNOWS im usually up late, and she's usually in bed by 9pm... that felt very targeted... the funeral was difficult, some family members who were invited would make a comment, and I'd have to act excited, even though I wanted to cancel... I didnt cancel only because so much money was already sunk in, and we had a lot of people traveling to make it to our wedding. I nievly thought if I gave his mom space after apologrizing multiple times, she would get over it, I didnt even care about those drapes, I just didnt want her getting hurt. Tuesday Destro called on his way home to answer what needed to be done from that list she sent me the night before, and she was acting like everything was fine. Wednesday was the rest day for Destro and his dad, and we went over Thursday as planned to finish what needed to be done before the rehersal on Friday. Obviously nothing had been touched since we left, but my mom and I finished what I wanted done. Everyone acted like everything was fine... I struggled, but still acted civil. Thursday night the people who traveled the longest distance started arriving, including friends of mine, and conveniently none of the trailers his mom promised were available... and she told them yup yup, you guys get a trailer, till it got to dark for the to set up their tent that I told them to bring just in case... his dad was livid, but put them in the office. This is the part there's just so much little comments and things that erked me, but I can get over... friday she prioritized making a balloon heart behind the head table in a small shop that we somehow had to fit over 100 guests in. I hate her for that, because myself and a good chunk of our wedding party arent THIN people, and we were all forced to squish behind all those ugly freaking balloons that I didnt want... our bestman/MC popped a few while trying to squeeze in and out. His Dad made some rude comments about how we had to rush food out because everyone was being ""pigs"" and eating the chips we put out, which wtf? That's why the chips were there? So he went and told everyone to eat before any of the wedding party could sit down, as most of us were running around trying to get things done. It was a shit show. Our ohotographer didnt even show up. Once we all finally were able to sit and eat, the DJ put on the slideshow, he cut so many photos, but had a bunch of duplicates, used different songs than what I requested, but the .ost upsetting was how I made it VERY clear the section for my dad, I didn't want the word ""tribute"" put in there... his parents were the ones in charge of telling the DJ of things needed fixing, because they refused to let me see it first... I was crushed, but my auntie drilled it into me that no one wants to see a unhappy bride, so I smiled through all of it... and I did enjoy being around everyone Destro and I love, but I felt so distant from what I felt I should have been feeling on this day we worked so hard for... everyone seemed like they enjoyed themselves, so im happy about that... then the morning after we were suppost to do a brunch, which his parents offered to do, but didnt do, which imo was ignorant they couldbt have even fed the people who were staying there and helped us with everything... but they started just throwing all the food into the incinerator, including my mom's antique bowl she used for a salad she brought... his parents were bitchy, which I mean, im sure they were hungover, but they kept making ignorant comments to my mom, sister and maid of honor... then said everything must go, throw it, or take it to your garage. So now our garage is full of all this stuff I didnt even want, that she purchased, and I realized how much time and money ey I spe t on stuff that they shoved under tables, and never got used... because of the days we lost over her giving me the silent treatment, we never got a photo area set up. My blanket and sock area got shoved to the back, all the centerpieces and table runners were shoved under tables or in a corner you couldn't get to, the glasses I wanted the wedding party to wear for photos only got handed out to the groomsmen down the isle, then thrown outside? No one else got them. And all the .only I spent on cheese and meat trays never got put out.... yet her stupid balloon heart that took 3 hours to make behind the head table got done... but now evwrything is said and done. They are at their cabin, living life, while im laying here miserable, wishing I just postponed till a better time.... I feel like NOTHING that was important to me got done... but atleast everyone had a good time, and we had enough food (even though his parents kept calling everyone pigs)...


Edit: Destro has been there for me the whole time, and had constantly been offering to talk to his mom, I was the one who kept telling him to hold off on it, because I thought there was a chance we could have solved our issues without the guys getting involved. Destro does insist he's talked to his dad, and that things are being delt with. However the way his dad was acting makes it hard for me to believe. But seeing all their FB posts about the stuff they are doing at the Cabin, while Destro is away for work is leaving me feeling so isolated and alone in all this misery. I spent all day yesterday trying to find a councellor or someone to talk to because I've ignored a call from them the day Destro left, and I'm scared if they try calling this weekend ill blow up, and make things worse. We have weathered so many storms together, I just cant believe that she had to choose the wedding to start all this crap, after preaching this day was all about Destro and I being happy.

They say Bitcoin is the future. A store of value. A replacement for fiat.  
But when you look closely—not at the myth, but at the math—it becomes clear:  
**this isn’t a currency for the people. It’s a vault for the few.**

---

### 🧭 The Supply Is Gone—And You Were Never Meant to Have It

- Total supply: **21 million Bitcoin**  
- Lost forever: **4.2 million BTC**  
- Held by whales: **6.5 million BTC**  
- Remaining for the world: **10.3 million BTC**

Now divide that by the global population:  
**~8.24 billion people** → **~1/8000th of a Bitcoin per person**  
Not even enough to buy a cup of coffee—if Bitcoin were usable for that.

---

### 🧭 The Whales Are Still Buying—And You’re Still Watching

These 14 whales aren’t done.  
Sovereign nations and digital asset treasuries (DATs) are joining the race.  
They move with capital velocity. You move with volatility.

Even if you wanted to buy Bitcoin, you’re not buying from the protocol.  
You’re buying from **them**—at **their price**, on **their terms**, with **their timing**.

---

### 🧭 MicroStrategy: A Sovereign in Debt

- Holdings: **640,031 BTC**  
- Average purchase price: **$66,384 per coin**  
- Funded by **debt and equity dilution**, not profits

If Bitcoin crashes, they face a **margin call on their myth**.  
This isn’t sovereign stewardship—it’s **leveraged speculation**.

---

### 🧭 Trump’s Crypto Empire: Centralized Meme Sovereignty

- Trump Media holds **$2 billion in Bitcoin and crypto securities**  
- His family controls **80% of the $TRUMP meme coin supply**

This isn’t decentralization—it’s **branding with price control**.  
And yet, the masses are being asked to embrace this as a replacement for fiat.

But fiat—flawed as it is—offers **yield, flexibility, and utility**:
- You can earn interest through savings, CDs, treasuries, or dividend stocks  
- You can spend it anywhere  
- You can recover it if stolen

Bitcoin offers none of that.  
No yield. No recovery. No daily utility.  
Just scarcity—and a story.

---

### 🧠 The Epiphany

Bitcoin is not a store of value for the masses.  
It’s a **performance of sovereignty** for the few.

And when you buy into it—especially in your 401(k)—you’re not securing your future.  
You’re **crowning the whales**. You’re **funding their vault**.  
You’re **buying their myth**.

---

### 🧭 The Stewardship Verdict

> *A currency must protect the vulnerable, adapt to grief, and distribute dignity. Bitcoin does none of these.*

It’s not a replacement for fiat.  
It’s not a replacement for gold.  
And it’s not something we should desire in our retirement accounts.

1ny33ao,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1ny33ao/how_to_identify_different_portable_mug_warmer/,How to identify different portable mug warmer models?,"Hey everyone! I've been using mug warmers for years, and I wanted to share my experience with different models to help you make an informed decision. Trust me, once you start using one, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it!

First off, let me explain what got me into mug warmers. I work from home, and I'm notorious for letting my coffee get cold while I'm lost in my work. Sound familiar? After trying various solutions, I finally discovered these amazing devices, and they've been a game-changer.

There are several types of mug warmers out there, but they generally fall into three main categories:

1. Basic Electric Warmers
These are the most common and affordable options. They typically have a simple on/off switch and a single temperature setting. Perfect for beginners, but they might not keep your drink at the exact temperature you prefer.

2. Temperature-Controlled Models
These are my personal favorite. They let you set specific temperatures, usually between 77°F to 158°F. I recently got one from https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer and it's been incredible - the digital display is a nice touch!

3. Smart Mug Warmers
These are the fancy ones with app connectivity and precise temperature control. They're pricier but worth it if you're serious about your hot beverages.

Here's what to look for when choosing a mug warmer:

- Heating Surface Size: Make sure it fits your favorite mug
- Auto Shut-off Feature: Essential for safety
- Temperature Control: Basic or advanced, depending on your needs
- Power Source: USB or traditional plug-in
- Material Quality: Cheaper ones might not last long

One thing I've learned is that not all mugs work well with warmers. You'll want flat-bottomed mugs made of ceramic or glass for best results. Those cute curved-bottom mugs? Not so great.

I've tested dozens of models, but my current favorite (which you can find at https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer) has a waterproof design and auto-shut off feature. It's perfect for both coffee and tea, and the temperature control is spot-on.

Pro tip: Clean your mug warmer regularly! Coffee spills can build up and affect performance. A simple wipe with a damp cloth when the device is cool does the trick.

Also, consider the placement of your warmer. Keep it away from water sources and on a flat, stable surface. I learned this the hard way after nearly knocking mine off my crowded desk!

I hope this helps you navigate the world of mug warmers. They're such simple devices but can make a huge difference in enjoying your hot beverages throughout the day. Let me know if you have any questions - I'm always happy to help fellow beverage enthusiasts!",1,1759606077.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False
1ny33am,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ny33am/aitha_for_requesting_a_deep_cleaning_and_odor/,AITHA for requesting a deep cleaning and odor treatment before fully moving into my apartment?,"I just moved into a new, expensive, furnished one-bedroom apartment in the Caribbean. It’s only 800 square feet, and the lease stated that the unit would be fully refreshed between tenants and that two full propane tanks would be provided.

When I arrived, the apartment had a stale odor, cobwebs, dirty walls, stained furniture and pillows, and rusted blinds. One propane tank for the grill wasn’t full, and I’m not sure about the stove tank. I documented everything with photos.

I emailed the landlord to explain the problems in detail and formally requested a professional deep cleaning and odor treatment. It’s now 3:15 the next day, and I haven’t heard back. I know he owns another successful business, so I can wait a little longer, but I plan to move in more of my things on Monday. I really want to start enjoying my new apartment, but I can’t because of the smells and the dirt.

Moving in has been stressful from the start due to payment portal glitches, including a demand for over $5,000 in cash for first and last month’s rent, which delayed my move.

I used to work as a professional cleaner and maid to help pay for college, so seeing an apartment in this condition is extremely frustrating. I don’t believe I should have to clean a new apartment myself. The lease said it was going to be fully refreshed, and to me, fully refreshed means a proper deep cleaning has been done.

Having lived in the Caribbean before, I know there are many simple ways to control stale odors in a closed apartment, like using coffee grounds, white vinegar, charcoal briquettes, Damp Rid, and other common methods. It’s disappointing that none of these were done before my arrival.

I suggested a professional deep cleaning and odor treatment, which I think is a reasonable solution. AITA for requesting this before fully moving in, or should I just start living in the apartment despite the issues? Am I being nitpicky after paying over $8,000 to move in?

1ny334k,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1ny334k/bread_maker_vs_bread_machine_are_they_essentially/,Bread maker vs bread machine: are they essentially the same?,"Hey everyone! I've been baking bread for quite a while now, and I noticed there's a lot of confusion about bread makers and bread machines. I see these terms thrown around all the time in baking groups, so I thought I'd share what I've learned after years of home baking.

Here's the thing - a bread maker and a bread machine are exactly the same thing. They're just different names for the same appliance. It's like how some people say ""soda"" while others say ""pop"" - same drink, different names!

I remember when I first started looking for a bread maker, I was totally confused by this. I spent hours researching, thinking they were different appliances. Save yourself the trouble I went through - they're identical!

These magical devices do everything: mixing, kneading, proofing, and baking. You just dump in the ingredients, press a few buttons, and boom - fresh bread! It's seriously that simple.

I got mine from this link: https://athometouch.com/bread-maker and it's been a game-changer. The smell of fresh bread in my house every morning is incredible.

Here's what these machines can actually do:
- Make different types of bread (white, whole wheat, gluten-free)
- Knead pizza dough
- Make jam (yeah, seriously!)
- Some even have a delay timer so you can wake up to fresh bread

But here's what I wish someone had told me before I started: you need to measure ingredients precisely. Like, really precisely. That's the key to getting perfect bread every time.

Also, here's a money-saving tip - these machines are actually super energy efficient compared to using your regular oven. Mine (which I got from https://athometouch.com/bread-maker) uses about as much electricity as a coffee maker.

The best part? No more expensive store-bought bread that goes stale in a few days. I make fresh loaves whenever I want, and I know exactly what's going into them - no weird preservatives or additives.

Whether you call it a bread maker or a bread machine, these things are pretty awesome. I can't imagine going back to store-bought bread now. Just the smell of fresh bread baking in the morning makes it worth it!

Obviously it bothers me that she is still dragging my names about the place and projecting her issues onto me, but I don’t feel half as bad as I did 3 months ago after the breakup, now I just feel meh, like a bad taste in my mouth. 
 So I never got the chance to meet her parents, however I do know what they look like and I occasionally see them in the local town as I’m driving through from work, and I always wonder what would happen if I just stopped and went to speak to them. They clearly know their daughter is a fuck up, but I really do think about how our interaction would go, perhaps I’d offer to buy them coffee and just chat about her, them and us as an ex couple.

But my argument is that nowadays coffee shops are super transparent with what they use, because a huge majority of customers want to know what’s going into their drinks ya know? I’ve had several customers ask me what brand syrup we use and they decide whether they like that brand or not before they order. I get maybe a few stingy people who don’t wanna spend money could see that we use a certain brand that they can get themselves, heck I use the same brand we use at my store. But it’s really the convenience that people pay for usually, even though I could make my own coffee at home, I’m usually lazy and don’t wanna go through the whole process so I go and buy coffee I could’ve made myself. I get we’re trying to grow the business but I don’t think hiding what brand syrup we use is gonna make much of a difference. What are yalls thoughts?

He's currently working with a psychiatrist to get an approval for Adderall.

I did have PPD that I'm now taking medication for. PPD made me very self-critical and suicidal. When I would tell him about my suicidal ideation, he would criticize me for giving into the negative self-talk or flat out ignore me. He was not supportive at all when I was in labor.

He's been aggressive and nasty. He accused me of cheating on him at 6 weeks postpartum when I said I would prefer to go to my postpartum OBGYN appt alone. 

He'll show up at my work (apartment management office) and assume I'm available to help with baby care. He came to my office today and sat with our daughter on the floor next to my desk. He said he hadn't fed her yet because ""she just wants to play."" It was 2pm. She was being pretty loud and I had residents walking through with questions, so I asked if they could please leave the office or wait in the clubhouse. He shut down immediately and said ""well we'll just leave then."" Walked out without saying another word, even though I was telling him I wasn't mad at him and he didn't do anything wrong, I just was trying to focus.

He's either angry or shutdown 90% of the time. He is aggressive with our pets. He's told our daughter to ""behave"" or done the angry first-middle name thing when she's literally just being a baby. He cusses at me, even in front of my mom.

He's shoved my arms/shoulders a few times if I ""startle"" him while walking quietly to not wake up the baby. He says he has no control over the shoving because it's an instinctual reaction.

The few times I bring up wanting to go to a bookstore, visit a friend, or go to coffee shop by myself for a break, he'll be very particular about making sure I only go to a safe neighborhood or drive on a route he thinks is safer. It doesn't feel sweet, it feels controlling.

There have been a few breaking points where I tell him that he needs to change. He does not apologize or show humility. He either stops talking to me and does as much housework as fast as he can or buys me a gift, such as a Stanley cup, flowers, or Starbucks. 

Things are not good. I brought up marriage counseling, and he said that he doesn't think it's necessary. He said that I think he's angry when he isn't. I told him I think he's angry when he demonstrates angry behavior (aggression, swearing, raising his voice, etc). He didn't say anything to that, but then said annoys him when I'm always asking if he's okay. I agree that I do check in more than is normal, but I told him it's because I am unsure of our relationship and his level of care for me.

He said he wishes I could understand how much he does care for me. But that he doesn't know how to reflect on his past actions and his brain is either ""obsessing over something like D&D or empty."" Then he started talking about his ADHD and got choked up saying ""I wish you could understand what it's like to have my brain."" I don't like the example this is setting for my daughter. I don't know what to do.",2,1759605795.0,January2025Bumper,0,1.0,False
1ny2yx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtHomeEssentials/comments/1ny2yx0/what_size_standing_desk_do_i_need_for_multiple/,What size standing desk do I need for multiple monitors?,"Hey everyone! I've been working from home for the past couple of years, and I recently decided to upgrade my workspace with a standing desk. After tons of research and trial-and-error, I thought I'd share my experience about choosing the right size standing desk, especially for those of us running multiple monitor setups.

I started with a small desk, and let me tell you - that was a mistake. With two monitors, my keyboard, mouse, and other essentials, I felt like I was playing desktop Tetris every day. Not fun.

Here's what I learned: For dual monitors (24-27 inch), you'll want at least a 48-inch wide standing desk. If you're running three monitors or larger screens, go for a 60-inch or wider desk. Trust me, the extra space is worth it.

After trying several options, I finally found an awesome standing desk that perfectly fits my setup: https://athometouch.com/standing-desk. It's sturdy, spacious, and the height adjustment is smooth as butter.

Some key things to consider:
- Depth matters too! Aim for at least 30 inches deep
- Account for monitor arms if you're using them
- Leave space for accessories (trust me, they add up)
- Consider your room size
- Factor in cable management space

Pro tip: Measure your current setup and add 20% extra space. This gives you room to grow and prevents that cramped feeling.

My current setup includes three 27-inch monitors, and I'm using a 60-inch wide desk. It gives me plenty of space for my monitors, a full-size keyboard, mouse pad, notebook, coffee mug (essential!), and even a small plant.

For those wondering about stability - wider desks generally need better support. Look for desks with good weight capacity and sturdy legs. The one I got from https://athometouch.com/standing-desk has been rock-solid, even at max height.

Here's a quick size guide:
- Single monitor: 40-48 inches wide
- Dual monitors: 48-55 inches wide
- Triple monitors: 60+ inches wide

Don't forget to factor in other items you might want on your desk. I learned this the hard way when I realized I needed space for my drawing tablet and reference materials.

Remember, investing in the right size desk from the start saves you money and hassle in the long run. I made the mistake of ""going small to save money"" first, and ended up buying a larger desk anyway.

What's your current setup like? Anyone else running multiple monitors on a standing desk? Would love to hear your experiences!",1,1759605794.0,AtHomeEssentials,0,1.0,False

Last night we ended up spending more time together at a bar and then at a club (with my close friend and a mutual friend she met for the first time that day) When we said goodbye, she suddenly started crying out of nowhere, right after saying “sorry” without context. I asked why, but she couldn’t explain. Instead, we hugged intensely for a long time. She just said she was happy I’m doing well. The moment felt surprisingly emotional and close.

I suggested we could grab a coffee sometime to talk through some of the unresolved things from our past. She said she’d like that and told me she would text me.

The truck’s coming back to life, but right now the interior is empty where the bread cabinets should be.

I’m looking for a cabinet maker or artisan woodworker who can rebuild the interior cabinetry 1:1 to original — all wood construction, no modern hardware. Think sliding glass-front drawers and bread racks, matching period proportions and style to the wood floor and dash I installed.

Quotes I’ve gotten so far:
• $3,000 — from someone I met at Cars & Coffee
• $8,000 — from a shop
• $18,000 — from an older craftsman who’s done this before, but I’m concerned about reliability and health over a long project

I’m not trying to spend 18k if there’s a better balance of quality, cost, and craftsmanship. The 3k guy seemed like too big a gamble. 

I’ve attached reference footage and photos from my friend’s original Helms Coach — including us pulling out drawers and taking measurements — and I still have full access to that truck, so whoever takes this on will have solid visuals, accurate reference points, and the ability to double-check dimensions anytime.

The $18k quote guy actually started at $14k until he saw my friend’s huge car collection and realized these coaches can be worth $100–200k… then suddenly, the price jumped.

If anyone in or around the San Fernando Valley / LA area knows someone who can take this on (or collaborate), or has done something similar, I’d really appreciate a referral or any advice.

Thanks in advance!

1ny2tlx,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1ny2tlx/harmony_distortion/,"Harmony, Distortion","Janey,

My favourite memories of us together will always be tied to music. The times we would talk for hours into the night with a background soundtrack, sometimes bring the music to the forefront to delicately dissect each sound and lyric. 
This isn’t terribly uncommon for two people in love, but I know you experience music the same way as I do; the way each note hits and the way a powerful line can change the course of your immediate future. As I write, I can see the face you would make when you would belt out a song you love. 

Sometimes I would stop singing with you just to sit there and melt. Not always though, because I’ve always yearned for a singing partner that I didn’t have to worry about impressing with my voice. Someone to sing in unison with or harmonize with, no matter how good we sounded. We sounded amazing. The sound of a perfect mix.
____________

I write in past tense, not due to recollection, but from the other noise that soon entered. You may be too young to know this, but it’s a troupe of every “Behind the Music” documentary:
-Artist or group find lightning in a bottle
-They share their music proudly
-People come in and influence the music and the artist(s)
-internal conflict ensues 

While our coffee time or carpool concerts aren’t certified platinum, we have heard the same whispering in our ears. 
“They’re holding you back”
“You deserve better”
“It should feel like ____ “

The noise. The noise. The noise deafens. 

We kept singing and then we doubted. In moments by ourselves we wondered, “was it really that good?” I think that’s natural. I mean, how could it be if all this noise is around?  Shouldn’t everything quiet down when we sing? 

I remember certain moments with singing together. I remember you telling me how you don’t think you’re a good singer. I told you something like, “you definitely are, you just need to do _______ to be better.” More recently, I remember wondering if you actually thought I was a good singer. 

We kept singing and we doubted.

___________

Presently, we are on hiatus. Our track is on pause. The noise of others and the sounds of life have distorted our songs to an unbearable feedback so insufferable we both are singing flat. You have left the studio. I don’t know how far away you have gone or if you’ll ever be back. I only know that you need quiet. 

I’m not sure if you’ll ever come across this post and I can’t tell you this because it would be heard as ringing in your ears. If you see this, I want you to know that I’m still here singing quietly. Not because I can’t make it on my own, but because I love the songs we sing together. 💙

Take a moment to appreciate the little things — the warmth of the sun, a smile from a stranger, your morning coffee, or even the quiet hum of peace when the world slows down.

Bring color into your life, whatever that means for you — laughter, music, creativity, a walk outside, or simply sitting in stillness. These moments are not wasted; they’re where healing and strength grow.

And above all, love yourself. You are worth the rest, the care, and the time it takes to recharge. Treat yourself with kindness and grace — because you can’t pour from an empty cup. Fill your life with love, gratitude, and the belief that you are enough, exactly as you are. 💚

1ny2k1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheAngel/comments/1ny2k1z/aita_pranked_the_office_lunch_thief_as_revenge/,AITA? Pranked the office lunch thief as revenge,"Hi guys. I (Chef Aaron) (31m) (very strong) was just hoping you could weigh in on a situation I'm currently dealing with at work. 

So, to start off with, I'm a magnificent cook. Probably the best in the world. I work in an office, mostly as charity to other chefs so they don't feel TOO inadequate (even though they are). That's just how nice I am. Probably the nicest in the world. 

Basically, my lunches have been disappearing from the office fridge lately. Just yesterday I brought in a lovely baked fish with curry sauce, brussel sprouts, and kimchi. I was SO excited to pop that bad boy in the microwave, even in the fridge the aroma was mouthwatering. 

Imagine my surprise when I walked in to the break room to find my coworker (Ugly Dan) (37m) (fat) casually tossing my tupperware in the trash! He even ate it cold, since I couldn't smell any of that delightful scent bouquet wafting from the microwave. 

Needless to say, I was FURIOUS. But I kept my cool. I only screamed at him a little. All the while my master plan of revenge. You see, Ugly Dan has a private office with a big desk. With drawers in it. 

I put my brilliant plot in to action when everyone else left for the day. Expertly, I rigged up a hand grenade in one of his desk drawers, to explode when the drawer was opened. 

First thing this morning, my plan came to fruition. I had slept at my desk so as not to miss it, and he woke me up when he came in so I could get him coffee (luckily- otherwise I'd have been in the blast radius). My grenade went off like a bomb- it blasted his ugly fat body clear out of the building, and in to a fine paste. It was perfect!

Now, unfortunately, it turns out we have security cameras. Management seems to think I ""overreacted"" and apparently some shrapnel hit a few other coworkers (oh well, gotta crack a few eggs and all that). I just got out of a meeting with HR, and they were very upset with me (didn't see them doing anything about Ugly Dan stealing my lunch? Hello). 

So what do you guys think? Ugly Dan deserved it, right? Please answer quickly so I can show this thread to the cops. ",4,1759604825.0,AmITheAngel,2,1.0,False

P. S I'm open to LDR as long as we feel we vibe :)

Heyy everyone, Regardless of whoever is looking this I hope that you are going through a good day! As for me I did have a pretty good day!, I went to gym and read some books, went out with my friends for a really good cup of coffee with dark chocolate. Did some swimming for a while until I had to go inside like a submarine because I almost hit another person haha. finally I'm gonna wrap my day up with a good movie I'm gonna watch(please suggest me some movies!)

I feel like I have to address a few red flags because of the people who have reached out to me until now, Whereas I met a lot of wonderful people, I also met a few of the people that are making me add these **red flags**.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\-Please don't reach out to me if you want **Situationship** or don't want to do LDR if we are far away, LDR here means getting to know each other before we meetup, like just a week or so, people have reached out wanting a LDR but backed off once I asked them to make it official. (after repeatedly telling me that they like me..? I want someone to be like the same way I'm being with them.)

\-I'm not a second/third wheel in a relationship nor I am a garbage truck to dump your emotional load onto me. Now sorry for being harsh but emotional load here means that information on your EX or how your EX treated you better than everyone else and how you can't go back to him, I'm not just a guy whom you can be emotional with and cut me off once you feel better.

\-After a lot of thinking I finally have added few of the good pic in my account as well, they are pinned.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine this usual scenario......you ever see posts/reels in Instagram/TikTok and wonder when do I get someone who's sweet, caring, possibly confident(definitely haha) and a guy who will be honest if the situation comes up?

just like I have told you in the post, I'm a big fan of life, I love adventures, spontaneous trips or just cuddling in the bed while watching Netflix, I'm mature enough to give you your personal space and support you at times where you need me the most and immature enough to do fight water gun battles with you lol(I will win haha).

I have lot planned in life, financial wise, I pretty much figured out my life and intellectually I feel like I'm smart enough to overcome situations, whereas both of them are good for me, I also want some unpredictability, some fun and someone whom I can call whenever I want, play any kind of game I want(planning to buy PS5, a laptop guy now) and honestly....wake up but still pretend to fall asleep for a few mins so that I can snuggle with you.

I like to watch sports, anime and Hollywood moves and K-dramas so that I can practice my rizz on you hehe(so dumb!)

**Some of my hobbies:** I play badminton, piano, music, games, I love tinkering with projects and stuff, currently working as a citizen scientist part time, I love to explore new places/long drives, vacations. I like hiking and When I am tired I mostly do Netflix and chill. Cook something new or just learn something new. I like brainy stuff such as stargazing and physical ones such as paragliding, surfing and many more!

I don't really mind the ages or anything like that and if in the off chance that I do get lucky, maybe we can start from LDR and end at ""I do""? hahaha

If you made it until the end thank you :) I'll let you on a little secret before you go!

Cute, yet feisty, this dandy little pistol made its way into my collection and shall become an honorary personal carry piece on occasion for fun!

It’s serial number can be dated to the year 1909, making this a second-year production run gun; this is likely the oldest one of these I have ever seen, and likely will be the only one I am lucky enough to purchase for my own.

Some moderate finish wear, and a slightly pitted/frosted bore, but she’ll still shoot. Mechanisms are solid.

With 6+1 rounds of .25 ACP and ball ammo (I am to assume this will not feed hollow points,) it may not be the infallible 9mm G19 Gen5 that we have today, but it’s still a lovely gun and she’ll ride around in my robe pocket around the home when I’m relaxing and sipping coffee.

1ny2fcy,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ny2fcy/i_enjoy_killings/,I enjoy killings,"People like chapters. Timelines. Labels. They want to put me in a box “the serial killer,” “the monster,” “the lunatic.” I don’t mind. Labels are tidy. They’re useful for people who sleep at night.

Call me whatever you want. I stopped caring long ago what anyone calls me. What matters is the truth, and the truth is simple: I started when I was eight, and I have never stopped. Not for a week. Not for a year. Not for anything.

That first time was accidental, if you want to be generous. Childish cruelty, a dare turned wrong. I felt something click then not pleasure, not exactly, but a clarity I couldn’t name. After that, the world narrowed. People became puzzles. Faces with edges. Breathing bodies that could be arranged, examined, catalogued. I learned to watch and to wait, and most nights, when the city went quiet, I practiced patience.

Age meant nothing. Race meant nothing. Their names meant even less. I kept notebooks for a while crude jottings, times, places, the weather, the sound of a particular gravel when someone fled. Later I burned those notebooks. I have a better memory now; memory is a cleaner thing without ink that can be found in a drawer by curious hands.

I tried methods. I tried ritual. I admired the meticulousness of others and tried to mirror it in my own way. There was a long phase where I studied old crimes like men study recipes. I read the accounts, marked the mistakes investigators made, the arrogance of people who believed their pattern would never be seen. I learned the small things, the things reporters never care to print, the way evidence collects like dust in a sunbeam when you don’t know to blow it away.

This isn’t a boast. It’s an explanation. I am a careful man.

Three things stand out most to me now, three that shaped the way I think about what I do. Not because they were the worst that’s a silly scale but because each taught me something I still carry.

The first was a man in his forties. Middle management, suit a little too cheap for his neighborhood. He laughed too loudly at his own jokes. People like him make predictable habits. He walked the same route every weekday, hands in his pockets, head bent against the wind. I followed for months. I learned where he bought his coffee, how he ignored the corner florist, the exact second he would tie his shoe. The night I took him, it was raining thin and hard; the city lights smeared across the pavement like a painting. He was surprised, of course. Most people always are. They think surprises are only for birthdays, not endings. That taught me the value of patience and the sweet, tidy satisfaction of a plan executed without panic.

The second was a girl young, impossibly alive, laughing even when the world tried to dim her. We dated, in a small way. She called herself Eve. She was twenty-two, quick with photos, quick with love, and I loved the way she thought she could fix me by being brighter. She believed in reasons. She believed in “us.” That belief is useful to a person who needs learning.

Eve asked me once, while we lay quiet in the dark, why I kept some things to myself. “Secrets,” she said, “are the only poison worse than the truth.” She wanted honesty. I tried. I told a version of myself I thought she would accept childhood sadness spun into a story she could hold and soothe. That night, she tried to wake me: a smile, a question, her hand on my chest. In the morning she left for work and then for good. I wish I could say I feel remorse in the way they tell you remorse feels. I do not. I felt the loss the way someone feels a glass slip from their hand quick, bright, and then gone. The thing it taught me was cruel and exact: intimacy is an exposure. People who reach in can find what you don’t want them to see. People who love you are often the most dangerous investigators because they are allowed closer than anyone else. If you are going to do something permanent, you cannot let anyone hold a flashlight in your dark.

The third is a child, or at least he was when I saw him; he was older than the first time I was eight, but a child nonetheless. He made a mistake that had no malice a look, the wrong place at the wrong time. The way people keep a child’s error in their minds, thinking of it as small and pardonable, is the same way they later convince themselves that bigger errors are accidents. I thought about that a lot afterward. About how the world confuses cruelty with inevitability. That taught me not about how to strike, but about why I could keep striking without the world ever truly noticing: the world prefers tidy explanations and people who will swear the strange thing never happened.

You asked in spirit, in the way readers always ask, for the “how.” The how is boring and dull. I have learned to be unremarkable. I work at things that give me cover. I study people’s hours. I own a washer that runs at night. I keep my tools cleaned and my hands rough so door handles don’t betray me. I learned to be friendly with nosy neighbors, to laugh in the right places, to misplace my keys where they expect them. The trick is not to be perfect. The trick is to be convincingly ordinary.

You will notice I don’t speak of gore. The sensational details please a certain part of the mind that likes to pretend horror is a spectacle you can watch from the safety of an armchair. I’m not here to perform for you. The horror you feel reading this is the real work. The rest is just background noise.

People tell me I’m arrogant for saying I won’t be caught. Arrogance is a kind word for confidence. I understand systems. I understand patterns. I understand how grief and shame make people point at the wrong things. The police work hard; they do. But they also like closure, and closure wears a costume: a suspect, a motive, a neat newspaper story. They want it tidy. They want someone to say “I did it” and sign his name. I understand how to give them the appearance of choice and to obscure the rest.

I do not feel fear like most people do. Fear for me is utility. It sharpens. It is a tool to be measured. When I am careful, I sleep. When I become careless, I have nightmares that feel suspiciously like practice. There is a serenity in the work for me a clean, efficient feeling as if the universe briefly aligns with me and says, “We will let this be simple tonight.”

I am not cruel out of hatred. I am not terribly poetic. I am compulsive. There are hours when the desire sits like a pressure behind my eyes, and I must find release. Sometimes I am driven by curiosity: what will happen if a man sees the sky fall differently? Sometimes it is paperwork the desire to have a new entry in the ledger of what I’ve known. Sometimes it is aesthetic: the way a city looks at dawn after it has cleared itself of its careless things.

There are men who would carve meaning from my words and call them evil in medical tones. There are others who would parse this and make myths. I do not want their pity. I do not want their psychoanalysis. I want the clarity to explain what I am because, strangely, the act of confession is the only thing that ever calms the ache for a week. This is my weakness: I write when the pressure gets too loud.

You should understand what this is not: a confession meant to seek forgiveness. Do not expect plea bargains of the soul. There is no stage for remorse here. There is only practice and repetition and the soft, cold satisfaction of a job done according to one’s own standards.

I could recount three of my “greatest” works in exacting detail, but that would be indulgent. Instead I will describe what each taught me.

The forty-six-year-old man with the suit taught me precision. He laughed at his own success and walked in a straight line. If you understand angles and timing, you can create a moment where nothing is left to chance. There was a late autumn wind, a paper bag that broke against a gutter tiny details that become anchors if you know where to tie them.

Eve taught me that emotional proximity is vulnerability. She also taught me the most efficient lies to tell when someone asks why you returned home late. I learned to laugh, to place censer-like banalities into conversation that made neighbors think me harmless. After it, I stopped breaking my rhythm for people who asked too many questions.

The younger one the one people might call a mistake in a trashy headline taught me about cleanup. People want stories that show clear motives. They want headlines that feel like a dam holding back chaos. So I made sure my work never fit one headline. If you cannot tell a story, you cannot accuse easily. If you cannot accuse easily, you cannot convict.

I do not enjoy the suffering that others imagine I savor. I enjoy the solving. The rest is incidental, unromantic, and badly phrased by eager mouths who love horror. I do not keep reminders. I once tried that trophies, trinkets and two weeks later I was waking up with a weight in my chest I did not like. I burned that away. Now I keep only memories, clear and cold like coins.

Sometimes I am asked, by acquaintances who want to know how I sleep at night, whether I think about being caught. The truthful answer is that when I am careful, I do not think about it. I have contingency plans. I have routes. I have piles of mundane explanations that I can produce if someone asks. But there is a darker truth: part of me, small and selfish, wants testing. I want to know how far I can go before the universe notices. It is a dangerous curiosity, but it keeps my mind sharp.

This is the moment everyone thinks will end: the admission. The dramatic flourish. A man on a soapbox with a confession tattooed across his chest. That is not me. I am not seeking absolution.

But there is something else you should know this is not only about me. People like to distance themselves from monsters by saying monsters are other, that monsters are mutations of society. Perhaps. But the thing that fascinates me, and I confess it here without irony, is how thin the line is between the watcher and the watched. How many of you wearing a civic mask tonight have practiced, in your lesser ways, the art of ignoring? You pass a person on the street and tell yourself a lie: “Not my problem.” That lie, repeated by millions, is the oxygen I breathe.

You will ask, eventually, who will be next. And you will hope it is someone nameless and distant. You will hope it is someone who does not look like you. That hope is useful for your sleep.

Tomorrow night, I will do what I always do. I do not know why I wrote this tonight instead of acting. Perhaps because my hand needed to move. Perhaps because I wanted to hear my words echo back off a stranger’s screen. Perhaps because the urge was quiet enough to be spoken to.

But remember this, reader: confessing does not equal stopping. Writing somehow keeps the thing alive, gives it a mouth. I will not apologize for that. I will not warn you where I walk. I will not tell you to lock your doors because locks are illusions, and illusions are easily bought by those who sell them.

If you feel fear reading this, that is a good start. Fear is an honest thing. Let it settle deep.

And if you think you see someone watching from the corner of your block tonight, do not assume it is merely the wind. Do not assume it is your neighbor returning from work. Look once, and then look again. Notice the small things the way a person does not move their eyes to meet yours, the way a hand hangs just a little too long on a lamppost. Most people will glance away. Most people will avert their face and keep to the comfortable anonymity of the crowd. That is what I count on.

I can’t stop killing people. That is the truth I live with. I have tried to bend it, to schedule it, to ration it like any other appetite. Nothing helps for long. It is a hunger that surfaces in my chest like tidewater, indifferent and patient.

Perhaps one day it will stop. Perhaps life will conspire in ways I do not expect. I do not plan on it. I am a man with a ledger I continue to add to, and ledgers are kept until the end.

Until then, be careful where you stand at night. Be careful whom you trust. Be careful whom you let hold a flashlight in the dark.

Because someone is watching. And some someone learned to speak like the people they lost, and they are very good at pretending to be the familiar.

Goodnight.

1ny2b2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ny2b2c/i_walked_up_on_my_sister_at_a_park_bench_to/,I walked up on my sister at a park bench to confront her,"I grew up being the youngest and being the only  mixed race sibling. It’s been its own set of issues as my siblings did not look like me and basically fully wyt. Our home was plagued with mental illness from both our parents. I felt very isolated and was told constantly I was adopted and how bad things were since I was born from my siblings. My mother (let’s call her Karen)  helped secure this ideology amongst my siblings. I never got new clothes or a hair cut. When I asked why my sister got that my mum snickered that she needed it more than me. I hid behind being a tomb boy because being feminine was reversed for the pretty one. 
I was indeed called ugly a lot. 

I didn’t even have baby pictures or a cup like my siblings. Never had pictures hung up or framed like my siblings. I asked why and I got backhanded comments. Micro aggressions were very strong. I’m setting a background. Things were hard for all of us but we all had a unique catered abuse style from each of our parents. Same trailer different experiences. My sister resorted to addiction but never had the guts to attack me herself. She encouraged the mixed race narrative and rub it in my face through her partners and friends. I was constantly belittled. She chose a white nationalist organization community in her addiction. Even started a clothing brand with the Symbolism. So imagine how I felt. 

I cut her out for many reasons. I’ve always had strong boundaries. I don’t struggle with drugs or alcohol and been out of the house at 14. I always worked hard and was able to travel the world. I’ve lived a really beautiful life even though I should have been a stat. My sister unfortunately had it really really hard. 

Time Comes around she gets sober which is amazing because it was really bad and I thought I would never see her again. She cleaned up and got her head straight. She worked really hard so I was so proud of her and told her constantly. She however never really acknowledged the harm she caused me and when I bring it up it she shut it down with it was my addiction. She sorta said sorry but would continue to choose to isolate me and exclude me from her life. She chose her friends and relationships always over making an effort to make me feel included.  She’s always to busy. Stood me up constantly in life. I felt so foolish waiting around to be seen by my own sibling. I wanted family counselling before my wedding but my mother refused. 

 My sister now gets to work with the same community that she looked down at and me for being mixed with. She’s seen as an Ally but shuts me down when I asked for better accountability and meaningful reconciliation on her end. I wasn’t the one that actively went to hurt her. She didn’t do any real work on the harm she’s caused me and gaslit my experience and expectations of having a relationship. I wasn’t the one that went out of my way to hurt her. She’s bubbly and nice so she plays victim very easily. I’m straight forwards and never had anyone help me in my family. Aunts and uncles grandparents took her in. I was on the street and they knew and never offered any help. You don’t forget that feeling. Why was I ostracized? While she was lifted up time and time again and now even by my own community and I’m isolated from that love. 

When I told my sister not to use terms like maybe I’ll “squeeze you in”  when she would come down to the city. She’s always been weird with me. The thing is I’ve expressed wanting a stronger relationship and if she comes to my city she should make more of an effort ahead of time to grab a coffee or lunch. That it’s not normal to talk to your siblings that way like an inconvenience, an appointment not a priority. 
Her friends always came first. The ones she’s known for a few years that is always the priority before family. I had to tell her to invite our brother for dinner. They live in the same town! 


She got upset and said if I didn’t want her at my wedding I should say so. That hurt and was the exact opposite of what I was asking. I didn’t have bridesmaids but I wanted her to stand up there with me. I really love her and always wanted that kind of relationship. 

She was always finding ways to excuse herself out of my life , putting her friends first, I’d go home to visit and she would invite her friend over and labeled me angry for asking for the bare minimum. Finally after repeating and setting boundaries and expectations For a year she tried and made a good effort. 

I always planned everything. She totally unraveled again though. Then she resorted to her flakey mean girl behaviour. She said I made her cry her anniversary dinner? Because I asked for more heads up so me and my husband would arrange a nice dinner or time to see her. 

For context her and her partner always come down for concerts. They always know ahead of time when they will be down. My husband had a table reserved for them once and they showed up a hour late. Not really any apologies. Her partner sits on the phone the whole visit very disingenuous. I didn’t even point out how rude it was because I just wanted to keep the peace. 

When I speak up she labels me angry & aggressive then she gets to cry. If anyone’s a minority they know the scenario. It’s tactful and manipulative.  She’s always been a mean girl type straight form the movies. 

She’d upload photos of her visit to my city. The wording of her posts and pictures was to cause passive diggs at me. 

So yesterday I called her and really needed to vent about something she would know about only. A unique childhood situation. She didn’t pick up. No big deal. Then I see she’s actually a block away from my house and something just snapped in me. She’s parked her ass a block away from where I live. For context she lives 1000+ away from me. So how bizarre is this? I  told her I was planning on eventually moving from our country all together and I’d appreciate if she made a better effort to include me. So I ask to speak to her alone. 

I’m shaking at this point. I call her out on her behaviour. She gaslit me and played victim. Said she has a whole family and if I choose to cut her out like everyone else go ahead. It was clear as day that she’s always had resentment towards me and didn’t actually want a genuine relationship. 
I told her she doesn’t get to label me as aggressive for me speaking up. She pointed out how I was aggressive for showing up to the bench. So maybe she was right. She also said I’m the only one that gets to have feelings. For the first time in my life I learned to speak up on the lack of accountability. She’s trauma dumped to anyone who would listen our whole life. She did it on a trip we took as well. No real understanding or acknowledging I experienced any harm. She’s very centred in her own pain and can’t see she’s caused harm. 

I cut her out because I feel like I’ll never get the healing and accountability I need. I’ve been stood up and isolated so long by her I don’t think I have the heart to watch her parade around my community as some saint and instead I’m left to lick my wounds and pretend she’s always been supportive meanwhile her and my mother where the original racist bully’s. 

So I’m asking if I’m the asshole for blowing up and calling her in so many words a bad sister who doesn’t hold her self accountable for past actions? Should I have let it slide because she’s in sobriety ? I came to term years ago when I first cut her out, I should have done this again  move on with my life. 

I feel like I blew up for no resolution in the near future and that will be the last time I see her and I’ll never get a genuine sister relationship that doesn’t feel performative. I should have kept quiet went to there wedding and moved out of country and kept low contact. I don’t know what it’s like to be a recovering drug addict. Should I have just let it all go?

It wasn't a great time, especially since my dad is this unique sort of unbearable that's a lot like water torture. Many, many little instances adding up to drive you absolutely mad.

For example, he'd always wake up very early and unload the dishwasher loudly and wake everyone up. If you were making coffee, he'd corner you and ask why you're in a bad mood, even if you haven't said anything yet. He never washed his hands after the bathroom and would touch your stuff (like your laptop) without permission. If you were cooking, he'd hover and make bad suggestions, steal ingredients you'd just prepped, and even turn the temperature knobs to what he thought was right, even if he wasn't cooking. I once almost had a grease fire because I was making french fries and he got between me and the stovetop oil pot as it was bubbling over after he turned up the gauge, and he wouldn't get out of my way...then he'd comment on how I did that and should be more careful. Oh, and since I was very young, he'd blast descriptive and violent NPR in the morning with news of bombings that would wake me up crying since single digits. As I said, lots of little things that added up to just being really done with it.

One morning, I was woken up at like 5am by the dishwasher being unloaded. I don't know what happened to me that particular morning, but that was the day I woke up and chose vengeance. 

I heard the coffee grinder, flung the blankets off myself, and came out. He was in the corner making his coffee. Perfect. I walked up, unnecessarily close in the same way he always did, and asked, ""Why are you in a bad mood?""

He was confused. Said he wasn't in a bad mood, but just like him, I didn't buy it. I said, ""No, no -- I can tell you're in a bad mood. What's up, dude?""

He was quite unsettled by the time his coffee was done. But I wasn't done. A little later, I went out to where he was with the litter box, and I cleaned it in front of him. Then, without washing my hands, I went to his chair and started picking his stuff up. His phone, his napkin, his remote control. He was like, ""wtf!?"" And I was like, ""What? I thought we didn't wash our hands in this house! Why are you upset??"" Then I put on a murder podcast about a woman who had her bits cut off with piano wires -- full volume. He wasn't a fan.

Then, he made lunch. I went to the kitchen the second I heard cooking noises and immediately stole half a tomato he'd just cut and ate it. He looked annoyed, but kept going. Then, when he turned on the burner and went to the fridge, I turned it off behind his back. He turned it back on, I told him steak cooks better on cold pans and that he should turn it off. He looked at me like I was crazy; I returned the very same look.

By the time he sat down to his subpar lunch, he started crying. I'd never seen him cry before, except for when our family dog died when I was like...7. I told him I'm just doing to him what he does all the time, and maybe if he's crying by noon, he should consider adjusting how he treats others.

I called a therapist that day, right after I made him cry, and made myself an appointment. Vengeance was sweet, but I didn't want to have to act like him to make him see reason.

All in all, I don't regret it. He got a taste of his own medicine and couldn't take it. Realized if he cried over receiving the same treatment as me, maybe I wasn't crazy and it was actually pretty shitty.

I know it all sounds like pretty benign stuff, but added together, those little things became a very big thing that I'd been dealing with daily since childhood. Returning the energy was...satisfying, as a one-time thing.",88,1759604001.0,traumatizeThemBack,21,0.94,False

This morning, we took our son for a walk, bought ourselves breakfast and coffee, and we absolutely deserved a slow Saturday morning. We love dogs and have one of our own. We also often use off-leash hours at the park. But come on! Some owners walk their large dogs and let them do whatever they please.

A golden retriever ran towards us and started looking in the stroller for food. Then, it started attacking me and trying to get my BEC sandwich. The owner came over, said nothing, and just pulled the dog away. I asked, “And what now?” to which the response was a simple, “I’m sorry.” Well, great that you’re sorry. My sandwich was licked by your dog, and that’s disgusting.

Anyway, they went away, and we took a deep breath and continued feeding our baby, enjoying our coffee, and the same dog ran towards us again. This time, it grabbed my son’s bagel and just ate it within seconds. I can’t even find words to describe how ridiculous that was. We said, “What the hell?” and the owner didn’t even look us in the eye.

I mean, you can offer to pay for breakfast now? You can say you’re sorry the first time around and leash your freaking dog and go home? There are so many things you could have done. You’re lazy and inconsiderate. Train your dog, and if you can’t find time (or if you’re rich, pay for it), then you shouldn’t let your large pet run around like that. Unleashing your dog doesn’t mean you let go of any responsibilities.

Aye, you read that right. A 46-year-old Scot, successfully transplanted to the wilds of Pennsylvania. I've traded the lochs and glens for rolling hills and the occasional Wawa run, and I have to say, it's not half bad.

About me:

The accent is 100% authentic. It’s particularly effective for ordering coffee and confusing telemarketers.

I enjoy a good single malt whisky, but I'm quickly developing an appreciation for Pennsylvania's local breweries.

My passions lie somewhere between getting out for a good hike on a crisp autumn day and getting cozy on the sofa with a great film (anything from a tense thriller to a stupidly funny comedy).

I have my life together—stable career, own place, can cook a few decent meals that don't involve haggis (unless you're into that).

My sense of humor is a bit dry, a bit sarcastic, and essential for navigating life. I believe laughing, especially at yourself, is a vital life skill.

Who I'm looking for:

A woman (let's say 35-55ish) who is kind, intelligent, and doesn't take herself too seriously. Someone who can hold a conversation that goes beyond small talk, who is passionate about something, and who believes a good partner is a teammate. A shared sense of humor is a massive plus.

If any of this piques your interest, send me a message. To break the ice, tell me: what's one thing I absolutely have to see or do in Pennsylvania?",1,1759603731.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

This clever little creation from Simple Science (model B08GY77WMG) touts itself as a germ-killing superhero ready to tackle 99.9% of viruses, bacteria, mold, and fungus. Spoiler alert: for the most part, it delivers on its promises.

**Ergonomic Design and Daily Usability**  
At first glance, the product isn’t winning any awards for its packaging design, but function overshadows fashion here. The 16 oz bottle is lightweight, fits comfortably in my hands, and sprays evenly with just the right amount of mist. No awkward nozzle malfunctions or sudden bursts of too much liquid. It’s compact enough for quick grab-and-spray moments, whether I’m dealing with kitchen countertops or highchairs. The pack of three ensures I have enough to get me through weeks of consistent cleaning, even in a messy household filled with kids and pets.  

[Check Simple Science B08GY77WMG price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b08gy77wmg/)  

**Effortless Germ Warfare with Hypochlorous Acid**  
What sets this disinfectant apart is the use of natural hypochlorous acid, which boasts powerful disinfecting properties while remaining gentle on surfaces. I’ve tested it on everything from my coffee table to my kids' highchairs. It’s gratifying not to worry about leftover harmful residues or harsh fumes. Even my CPAP device, which can be an absolute pain to clean safely, took well to this spray. The fact that it’s safe around food, children, and pets solidified its place in my cleaning cabinet. I even tried tasting (admittedly a little brave) the air after spraying it on surfaces—it genuinely doesn’t have that chemical bite found in some cleaners.

**Versatility Across Surfaces**  
One of the most significant selling points for this disinfectant is its versatility. Whether it’s floors, chairs, countertops, or even appliances, it has a way of blending into all my cleaning routines without batting an eye. I particularly loved how well it worked on tricky surfaces like medical devices — my Bipap machine remains spotless and odor-free. The ""spray and air-dry"" feature feels like a luxury because, let’s face it, scrubbing residue is not anyone’s idea of a good time.

**Highlights**  
- Effective against 99.9% of viruses, bacteria, mold, and fungus.  
- Hypochlorous acid works without creating abrasive residues.  
- Essential for safe and versatile household cleaning.  
- Perfectly safe for use around kids and pets.  
- Compact and easy to use.  

**Negatives**  
- Bottle size might feel limiting for large-scale cleanups.  
- Lack of fragrance may be a downside for those who like a scented clean.  

**Performance Concerns**  
As much as this disinfectant impressed me, there were minor hiccups during my use. The spray nozzle, while functional, doesn’t have adjustable settings, which means you’re stuck with a single spray pattern. Also, for those accustomed to a perfumed aroma post-cleaning, the lack of scent may feel strange. It leaves a clean but mute ambiance in the room—freshness without the flair. While the product breaks down to saline post-application, it means surfaces must be air-dried and cannot be wiped without potentially halting its cleaning effectiveness.  

**Product Contenders**  
When comparing this disinfectant to others I’ve used, such as Lysol or Clorox sprays, it’s clear each has its niche. Lysol offers an extended fragrance option, catering to individuals who associate scent strongly with cleanliness. Clorox’s bleach-powered cleaning strength might edge out the CleanSmart spray for stubborn stains or areas exposed to severe contamination. However, unlike these competitors, CleanSmart wins with its hypoallergenic formula, a vital point for households prioritizing safety around children and pets. Its versatility to accommodate food-related surfaces without any rinsing required is a unique edge too.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Investing in this spray feels like a wise decision for what it offers. The pack of three bottles provides decent longevity, especially for regular home cleaning routines. While it may not dominate large cleaning projects due to its size constraints, the balance between quality and pricing is fair. I’ve tried sprays with similar promises but heftier costs, and they didn’t match the reliable performance. This product truly delivers affordable quality for what it promises, making every cent spent worth it.

I'm looking to meet some interesting and nice people here. Maybe this will work, who knows. 

This will probably just be a friendship, maybe with some flirting. But who knows where this might lead. I'm a very open person. That's why I'm lookin for woman, I have a lot of male friends, but barely any female ones.

I don't care where you come from, how old you are or what you look like. Just be a nice person and easy to talk to. 

So, with that out of the way, let me tell a bit about myself. 

I'm born in Germany and still live here with no real intent of leaving. I speak German obviously, but also can hold all conversation in English. I want to learn Japanese, but haven't found the time to start. 

For looks it you care about that, I'm 1.78m or 5'10"". I have short very dark brown hair, that almost looks black. Brown eyes. A full beard. I'm more on the chubby side, some people called me a hairy teddybear and I think that fits. 

As for my interests, you could say I'm your average nerdy guy. I grew up with game consoles thanks to my dad and from this I grew up gaming almost every console and switching to pc as soon as I could afford my own. I'm also an avid anime watcher and of course TV shows and movies. Currently rewatching some old shows, with the intent to finish them this time. I also collect pokemon cards, which is probably my most expensive hobby. 

I'm a full time worker and make some decent money for my age, at least I like to think that. I'm very close to my family and see them at least once a week. 

I like to think that I'm a good listener and can give some good advice, although some people said to me I'm having a hard time to understand people's problems. 

I'm also not a judgemental person, so if you like to share some of your problems or secret with a complete stranger, I'm the guy for you.

Eventually if we get to know each other, I'd like to switch to a different platform for communication, likelih

I've been dealing with fatigue on and off since I was 12. I'm 22 now and it just started up again earlier this year. This past month, it got significantly worse. I've been drinking 4 cups of coffee along with my ADHD meds just to feel normal. On days where I don't, I feel like I could fall asleep anywhere. Doesn't matter how much sleep I get - last night, I slept for 12 hours and I still feel exhuasted. I got bloodwork done Thursday, but I'm still waiting on the lab results. 

Yesterday, I had a health scare and I thought my pulse was 180bpm resting (turns out it was normal, but it was a wake up call about my excessive caffeine consumption). I broke down in front of my fiancé over the phone and I expressed how hopeless I felt and how I didn't think it was going to get better and how I was convinced I wasn't going to graduate especially without being able to drink that much coffee anymore (this is my 9th semester of college, I have no more redos left). He has a habit of falling into toxic positivity - ""everything's going to be fine"", ""what's the worst that can happen"", etc. But towards the end of the conversation, I thought he finally understood what I was going through.

Today, I got frustrated with him because he insinuated that after my caffeine withdrawals would subside, I'd feel back to normal. This felt dismissive of my reality - I drink coffee because I feel fatigued, not the other way around. He asked how he could support me (which I really appreciated) and I suggested he look into radical acceptance. He said that he would, but that he felt like this relationship is getting depressing because he can't help me with my situation and he's been feeling sorry. He said we're in the honeymoon phase where he's supposed to be feeling love and happiness, but instead he feels helpless. He asked to call later today so we could ""talk"". 

I feel sick. What am I supposed to do? Are we about to break up? I'm so tired of pretending to be okay all the time. I feel like with my fiancé he's supposed to be my safe space and I shouldn't have to mask around him, but maybe I am being too negative. I booked a therapy appointment but it's going to be two weeks away. I feel like my fatigue is ripping away everything and everyone I love.",5,1759603268.0,chronicfatigue,1,0.86,False

We both grew up in MN and lived in Mpls in 2017-2018 in Lyn-Lake and Longfellow areas, and again for the summer of 2023.

We now have a 3-month old baby and want to return permanently to be around family. 

I wanted to get insights about the area west of I35 around 46th street. Looks like it’s called King Field. There’s a house near Harriet and 46th St that we like. 

We like the the thought of this area as it seems to have good schools (Barton Community and Washburn Senior High) and is walkable/bikeable to Lake Harriet and local coffee shops/restaurants. It looks to be close enough to grocery and other stores down in Richfield. Our families are split all over the metro suburbs so this seems like a good central area. The energy and vibe of Minneapolis makes it feel like home, versus St Paul or any of the suburbs.

A few questions:

Is this area super congested getting on/off 35W? I recall in the past how badly 35 backs up. When we lived in Lyn Lake, it seemed to not be too bad since you could either take 31st or Lake, and we were east of Lyndale.

Any insights about Barton Community school? It’s important for us to send our kid to local schools once old enough. 

Any other insights/advice/suggestions welcome!

Turns out my heart rate only lowers when I’m not with her. What’s the path forward?,"So I have some anxiety. And since I met my gf earlier this year, it’s been worse. I had assumed it was just due to state of the world. She suggested I wear her Apple Watch to track my heart rate, and see what raises or lowers it. And unfortunately, it appears my anxiety is high when I’m with her, and only lowers when we’re apart. It’s nearly an exact match - if we’re hanging out for a day and she goes to the gym or get coffee with a friend, it lowers as soon as she’s gone and shoots right up when she texts me that she’s heading back.

After some contemplation, it makes sense. She’s quick to doubt our relationship - minor things like her spilling a drink can turn into an hours long conversation of “Do you still like me? Can you stand to be with me? Are you going to break up with me?” Even though I immediately respond to the spill with “don’t worry about it, I have paper towels and cheap furniture.” She’s a sensitive woman, and I love that about her as a sensitive person. But I’m always on edge, waiting for the next minor inconvenience to turn into a meltdown. And frankly, it can be tiring to again and again explain that it’s fine if she dies in Zelda, it’s a video game and literally doesn’t matter.

I don’t know how to move forward, or if I even should? Has anyone else run into a similar situation, and how did you come back?",46,1759603152.0,relationship_advice,44,0.84,False

Currently, I practice about 5 or 6 hours a week. I’d study more but I’m a farmer full time and it takes so much of my energy. My primary ways to study are trying to memorize by writing over and over again and using ChatGPT to create drills and practice paragraphs to translate which it then corrects. 

I listen to a lot of the “Little Talk in Slow French” podcast just to get the speech input even though I don’t understand a lot of it. I also like Coffee Break French. 

I would definitely benefit from joining a speaking group but I’m not confident enough to do that yet.

This is new territory for me.  I've looked at several brands (Delonghi, Jura, Breville, etc) and am now leaning towards KitchenAid KF7 or KF8.  From what I can tell, the main difference between the 2 models is that the KF8 has more drink options as well as the option to select plant based milk.  I believe it can also store preferences for more people than the KF7.  Most of the time, there will just be 2 of us brewing coffee, so I don't think this feature is a selling point for us.   Since we will most likely use plant based milk, does having the option to select it make that much difference in quality and taste? The price difference between the 2 is $350. I'm fine to pay more for the K8, but I don't want to pay for something that is maybe just gimmicky?  Please set me straight if I'm wrong!  Thanks in advance for any input.

People hear demon hunter and think I’m some kind of crusader. Holy water, silver bullets, all that crap. That’s not me. I’m not out here to kill anything. I’m out here to find her. Because… well, she has something that belongs to me. My dad. At least I think she does. I’m getting the bulk of my information from my mum, and my mum, she isn’t what people would call a reliable source. She lives in Beacon Point Sanatorium on the edge of Corvus Vale. She says a demon took my dad. But Everyone else says she killed him. That’s why she’s there, that’s why I was taken from her care when I was just a week old, and that’s why I’ve never met my big brother. I could be out there looking for him, trying to find the family I never had. But instead, I’m hunting a demon, because, unlike everyone else, I believe my mum. She told the police a demon took him after a ritual went wrong. Looking at it from an outsider’s perspective, I can understand why they think she’s crazy. she told the police this information while standing next to his cold, dead body. I guess you can’t accuse something of taking someone when they are clearly visible on your living-room floor, I get that. But she insisted that this demon took his soul and left his body. That was the moment they stopped calling her an outright killer and started calling the shrink. I’m documenting this here because I need someone to know what I’m doing, even if its just strangers on the internet. I grew up being past from pillar to post in a shitty foster care system, I have no one of real value in my life. If this all goes to shit, I need someone to know…I tried. So, anyway, ill start at the beginning, I guess.  
My name is Alex, Alex Hammond, I was born in Vale central infirmary in 1989. My parents are-…were. Shannon and Jerry Hammond. I don’t know anything about my brother. He was 2 when we were separated.  
I found my Mum recently, after years of not looking. That sounds bad, I know. But if you’re told the same story enough times, it starts to stick. You stop asking questions. For 36 years my mum was a compulsive lying psychotic murderer and that’s all there was to it. School was a cruel place. My life was common knowledge. When I started my new job as a tree surgeon up by hollowthorn forest, it didn’t take long to realise people still knew more about me than I did. “You ever spoke to her then?” Gary, my team leader asked out of the blue one day whilst casually munching on a tuna sandwich. “Spoke to who?” “Your mum mate.” “No, I don’t have a reason to, wouldn’t know where to find her even if I did.” I said, internally rolling my eyes. This line of questioning was something I was accustomed to, but I was hoping I could at least escape it at work. Gary wiped the crumbs that had accumulated in his stubble way with his sleeve, looking at me wide eyed. “Mate... she’s in there” he pointed a meaty finger upward, towards an ancient manor house style building sitting alone nestled amongst the very trees we were working on.

Beacon point isn’t far from my house. Corvus vale isn’t a big town. It’s About a 30-minute walk as the crow flies or a 10-minute drive. It sits just inside hollowstone forest, surrounded by a large stone wall. It’s peaks and chimneys visible from the road. It’s a secure site, The west wing, housed the criminals deemed too mentally unstable for general population, the rest of the building was used as a long-term residential facility for people with severe mental illnesses. White stone signs with polite fonts and little bird logos dotted the long driveway directing visitors. I was going to the west wing. Inside everything smelled like bleach and stale coffee. I didn’t tell anyone I was going. Who would I tell. I signed the visitor sheet with a pen that didn’t work until it did. The receptionist barely glanced in my direction. “Who are you here to see?” “Shannon Hammond.” She Paused and looked up. “I’m sorry Hammond is on family only visitation, and she doesn’t have any family” “I’m her son.” That got me a look. Not a kind one. More like really? I fished out my wallet and slid my ID across the desk. She didn’t pick it up. Her eyes ping ponged from the card to my face and back too many times before she sighed and printed me a badge. After an agonising wait, she buzzed me through. “Follow the lines” she said matter-of-factly. “Yellow to the visiting suit, red to the reading room, green to the lunch hall, ignore the black” “Ignore the black?” I echoed “yeah...” My trainers squeaked on the over polished floor as I followed a yellow line painted beneath them. I counted doors to stop my hands from shaking; I was so nervous. I felt as though I had shifted back in time, to the fourteen-year-old me, clutching a bin liner full of clothes outside yet another stranger’s door with a social worker telling me to be brave.

Mum sat facing away from me, at a table with edges rounded down to nothing. she staired vacantly out of the window as I sat opposite her. Her hands folded like she was waiting for church. She looked older than the picture I had. Of course she did. She had to be in at least her early sixties now. Her hair was completely grey; she’d tried to brush it neat. Her eyes met mine slowly. “Hello,” she said, softly. “Hi.” Silence fell into the space between us and had to be pushed aside. “I brought you something.” I didn’t know why I said that. I hadn’t. But I wanted to. Fruit. A magazine. A miracle. She smiled anyway. “You brought me you.” “I’m Alex,” I said, which was stupid. She knew that. But I needed to say it out loud. I needed it to be true in the air, not just in a file. “I know,” she said. Her eyes were wet, but she didn’t cry. She had the tired control of someone who has learned what crying costs in places like this. For a minute we talked about nothing. The Weather. My job. My favourite food. Then it all wanted to pour out. The questions. But I didn’t know how to open that door without everything falling through the floor. She did it for me. “You look like your father” she said, quietly. A tinge of fear shot up my spine. For a moment I had visions of her lunging at me from across the table. I stayed quiet and forced a thin smile. “Do you see him?” she asked. “Who?” “your father.” I stared at her, confused. I started to think id made a huge mistake in coming here. She was clearly deranged. She saw the puzzled look on my face and started to elaborate. She smiled, “Do you see a bird? Strange looking fellow. You wouldn’t miss it if you saw.”

My mouth went dry. “Sometimes,” I said. “There’s a weird one that sits on my window. It’s probably got a nest” “What makes him weird?”. “He a crow but he’s white” I said flatly. She nodded like we were finally talking about something that mattered. “That’s your dad,” she said. Certain. I laughed. A small, ugly sound. “spiritually speaking” I said not knowing if it was a question or a statement. “No, literally speaking” I raised an eyebrow. This was as good of an opening as I was going to get. “How?” I hated how much I needed that word. She turned her hands palm up on the table, like showing me she had nothing hidden. “I’ve waited thirty-six years for a chance to tell you the truth Alex. Let me start from the beginning” She sat back in her chair, the hard, cheap plastic clicking under the strain.

“We wanted a child,” she said. “But the doctors said no. There was an incident when your father was young, he needed emergency surgery to repair an abdominal hernia but there was an accident, both vas deferens were severely damaged during the surgery leaving them scared beyond repair. No one knew. Not until it was too late.” “I don’t know what those words mean” I replied honestly. “His balls didn’t work” “oh...” I looked away embarrassed. She half smirked before continuing. “Your father wanted a child of his own so badly, he searched high and low for an answer” “I thought I had a brother.” I interrupted “Didn’t he already have a child of his own?” “This was before your brother” she stated before continuing. “He found a book, in a dusty old shop in town. Started studying the occult” “What?” “Yes, that was exactly my reaction when he told me too.” She agreed. “But it worked” “What worked?” I asked cautiously. “The summoning spell” she whispered. I’d heard enough I couldn’t believe I just sat though that. She was clearly deranged. I started to stand; she reached for my wrist stopping me dead. An icy chill running up my spine. “Please Alex, just hear me.” Her eyes were pleading. “If at the end you never want to return, I will understand but please, let me finish.” I sat down slowly. If only to get her to release me. She stroked my wrist once with her thumb before removing her hands and straightening her faded pink scrubs. “I didn’t take part in the ritual, he did that on his own, but I know it worked. I got pregnant.” “With my brother?” “yes” she smiled.

“It wasn’t until I read the book later that I discovered there was a price to pay. The price differs with every request, depending on what you need granted.” “What was your price” I asked leaning forward slightly. “Any subsequent children must be given to her” “What?!” I stammered “I’m a subsequent child... I..I... mean I’m a subsequent child!” “I know,” she murmured, her gaze dropping to the floor in shame. “It was never meant to be this way. After your father told me what the price would be, we promised each other that we wouldn’t have another child. We tried, truly we did.” She looked up at me, her eyes full of desperation, silently begging me to believe her sincerity. “You’d think it would be simple, not getting pregnant, but…” her voice faltered, “…she always finds a way.” “What way?” I asked “It doesn’t matter now, what matters is you were born, and we loved you. Your father loved you.” “What happened to my dad Shannon?” I couldn’t bring myself to call her mum. At this point I was still quite sure Beacon Point Sanatorium was the best place for her.

I could see this caused her pain, but I was done listening to stories. She continued regardless “She made a mistake. The deal your dad made was between him and her. For the ritual to work in her favour we both had to be present at the summoning so that I could agree to the terms. But I wasn’t.” “Then what happened” I muttered half-heartedly. “The fortune teller that give your father the book helped us. She knew a spell; she helped us rewrite the terms. Sort of like a cosmic solicitor” she chuckled dryly. “This isn’t funny” I shot back “you killed my dad! I’ve grown up alone Shannon!” She slammed her palm on the table shocking my tears away. “It’s because of that man you got to grow up at all!” she growled. “He sacrificed his life for you! He took your place!” “Yeah. And what...? now he’s a fucking bird!?” She settled back into her seat. Resigned “she gave me a solid story. But I chose the truth.” “What!?” I stammered, exasperated. “Find Morrigan.” She whispered, defeated. “She will give you what you’re looking for” Her shoulders sagged as if the weight of the years finally pressed her down, the fight gone from her eyes. I stared at her, the words settling uneasily between us, thickening the air with a grief that tasted almost metallic. I wanted to scream, to demand sense from her rambling, but something in her expression, some fractured hope, kept me silent. Shannon no longer looked like stranger spinning tales; she looked like someone who had lost everything and was begging for a chance to make things right. The clock in the hallway ticked on, indifferent to the ruins she’d laid before me, and I realised that whether I wanted it or not, the story wasn’t finished. Not yet.",2,1759602465.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I’ve noticed that a lot of people in Gurgaon feel lonely or don’t have friends to hang out or talk with in real life. I’m born and raised here, so I know it can be tough for newcomers to make genuine connections.

If you’re looking to make friends, grab a coffee, share stories, or maybe chill over a beer — I’m up for it! I’m an extrovert, a good listener, and always happy to meet new people.

Let’s plan something this Sunday — whoever is free can join in! After that too, feel free to DM me, and I’ll let you know whenever I’m available for future meetups.

This is just about friendship (no dating stuff), and everyone’s welcome — guys or girls. I don’t have a big budget, so you might have to cover your own coffee 😅 but who knows, maybe we can build a great friend group out of this!

If this sounds like your vibe, drop a comment or DM me. Let’s make Gurgaon a little friendlier!",2,1759602422.0,gurgaon,2,0.75,False

Would I look needy?,"I (23M) met a woman (24F, I presume since I didn't ask her age, but that's a reasonable estimate) three days ago at a grad-student event. While waiting in the queue for coffee, she spontaneously struck up a conversation with me. We ended up talking for about an hour without her seeming distracted at all.

At one point I mentioned our city's pub stand-up scene, and she suggested, ""Oh, maybe we could go there together!"" After we parted, she texted me, ""It was lovely to meet you today!""

Two days ago, I asked her whether she wanted to have a drink the same evening or the next day, and she went for the same evening. We spent three hours talking almost non-stop. She held eye contact often, mentioned she sometimes does line dancing, and even offered to teach me one day. When we said goodbye, she told me to let her know if I wanted to do something together.

I followed up afterward with a text saying I had a great time, and she replied: ""I had a wonderful time too!! Nice trying somewhere new! Also thank you!! Hope to see you again before you go overseas but safe travels if I miss you! 😊"" (For context, I'm travelling for a week in a week.)

She had a night shift yesterday, and I'd really like to see her again before I leave in a week. My concern is whether asking her out again this weekend would come across as too needy or clingy, and I'm also unsure whether she's interested in me romantically or just being friendly (she's new to the city).

* Is this area safe for solo female travelers? I do have common sense, and know there are basic safety tips \*everyone\* should follow, but just wondering how others have felt regarding this.
* How rainy does it get, are there risks of iced over roads? I'm from Florida so I can definitely drive in rain, but black ice scares me.
* Favorite places to hike?
* Any general tips for this area?

I'm really most excited to see those beautiful views, lush forests, the coast. I like hiking, by no means am I a ""pro"" or anything, but I'm itching to get out and see what the West Coast has to offer as far as nature. Tired of the same old Florida scrubs.

And sorry if things like this get posted often, I know how annoying it can be. I'm currently trying to do my own research on where to go for this trip but wanted to get some ideas from the locals :) TY in advance if you read this. If there are other solo female travelers going around the same time, feel free to DM me, would love to meet up and grab a coffee or something!

1ny19uq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diary/comments/1ny19uq/our_anniversary_date_pt_2/,Our Anniversary Date (pt 2),"Okay so I left off on him receiving his knife!! 
He really liked it, told me I was a ""sweet baby"" allll day for getting it for him and for writing the card I did. In the card I basically said that the past year with him has been the happiest I've ever been in my life and that I can't wait for the countless years ahead that we would spend together. The sheath just shipped last night so I'll hopefully get it soon so the knife can have a good place to be instead of wrapped in bubble wrap lol

He got me a jewelry box with several drawers, a mirror, and some side panels for hanging necklaces. He knows I like my jewelry and he loves buying me some. I think he's been thinking of getting me one for some time because he's mentioned in the past that I'm running out of room in my tiny box for all the jewelry I had so his gift was very thoughtful and considerate. He's such a sweetheart. 

On the day of we woke up together, cuddled in bed, and he made breakfast while I got ready. I wore the same dress and general outfit as I did on our first date--something I hadn't worn since--but this time I was wearing the necklace, earrings, and ring that he had bought me as a matching set earlier in our relationship. He usually doesn't like dressing up but that day he wore a sleek black shirt, some nice pants, his dress shoes, and a blue tie that matched my jewelry. We went to his mom's place so he could straighten his hair and organize some things before our date and omg he looked so handsome!! He put on his cowboy hat and I put on his other one as a joke but he thought it was ""so cute"" so I wore it the whole day. 

We walked his elderly dog around the neighborhood and enjoyed ourselves a bit before heading to the plaza. Now, it wasn't a cold day, but it was very windy and I'm a small person with a smaller head than my boyfriend, and the particular hat that I had stolen from him for the day was extremely light and an XL size.. 

We walked around the plaza, window shopping and visiting the ice cream parlor we went on our first date a year ago. I had an amazing combination recommended to me by our server of cinnamon roll and vanilla cream cheese. It was truly miraculous how much it tasted like I was actually eating a cinnamon roll! They had chunks of one in the ice cream too! My love had some dairy free ice cream called ""coffee date"" and we went on our way, eating and talking, walking along the path where we first did. We stopped near the spot where we had our first kiss and were waiting for this woman to leave (nonconspicuously, we weren't rushing her just dilly-dallying nearby so we could go to ""our spot) and a passerby commented on how good of a match we were and how beautiful/handsome we looked. We thanked her and continued eating our ice cream and overlooking the river beyond the rail.

During the whole of our walk that darned hat was trying to blow off my head, so I was being extra attentive now that we were close to water and could potentially lose the hat. I was keeping my back to the wind and doing my best to tilt my head back while eating ice cream so the wind wouldn't blow the hat away, but one lapse of attentiveness and a particularly strong gust of wind nearly blew the hat off and into the river! Thankfully, I felt it and caught it just before it went over the rail and the woman who was in ""our spot"" was leaving just at that moment and said I caught it nicely lol.

We mosied on over to our spot, a table situated below the trail that had a tree and a few bushes on one side, and a guardrail that was a mere foot off the water. It was in this spot that we had shared a dance sans music a year ago, where he backed me against the rail and stroked my cheek; he told me that any passerby would be jealous of him for how beautiful I looked, and asked to kiss me. Our first kiss was very special and very romantic, that kiss convinced me that he was someone who was considerate, romantic, and disciplined. Our first kiss was little more than me leaning against him, rising on my toes, him bending down slightly, and a brush of lips. Such a soft kiss was unexpected because of his gruff appearance and resting bitch face so I had expected something a lot less gentle, but was surprised and allured by that softness within him. Of course, our subsequent kisses were a little more hungry, slightly more on my part because all I wanted to do was to kiss him and nibble on his lips. 

But that was a year ago. This time he asked me to put my ice cream down and secure my hat. We didn't dance, I think we both forgot that had happened in the moment and were purely focused on each other and our love for one another. He brought me close to him, once again near the railing, and kissed me passionately. He told me he loved me in the most sincere way he could, looking into my eyes and holding my waist close to him. 

He's made breakfast this morning and just finished so I'll have to finish writing about our date later... this might take a while haha

1ny17q2,https://i.redd.it/yvvfr79py4tf1.png,7 Home Decor Secrets That Instantly Transform Any Room,"Ever walked into a home and thought, “Wow, this looks like it belongs in a magazine”? The secret isn’t just the furniture. The right touches can completely change a room, making it feel luxurious, cozy, and effortlessly stylish.

If you love clean lines, functional design, and timeless style, mid-century modern furniture is your best friend. Pair it with the right accessories, and your home goes from ordinary to jaw-dropping. Here’s how to do it, with real examples from Mid in Mod, one of the best online furniture stores for mid-century modern design.



# 1. Make Your Coffee Table a Showstopper

Your coffee table is more than a spot for coffee—it’s the centerpiece of your living room. A mid-century modern coffee table becomes a styling canvas when paired with the right decor. The Agora Solid Wood Coffee Table, for instance, has a sleek design perfect for books, candles, or a bold vase. The trick? Mix heights, textures, and colors to make it visually irresistible.



# 2. Turn Walls Into Conversation Starters

Empty walls are a missed opportunity. Accessories like art can transform a room in seconds. A bold piece, like the Tidal Patchwork Canvas Wall Art, commands attention and complements mid-century modern accent chairs and furniture lines. Place it above a sofa or dresser to create an instant focal point.



# 3. Layer Your Lighting for Maximum Impact

Lighting isn’t just functional—it’s a secret weapon in decor. Mid-century modern design thrives on statement lamps with geometric or metallic shapes. Pair a floor lamp with an **accent chair** or a sleek table lamp on a console to create a warm, inviting corner that screams style.



# 4. Transform Dressers Into Showpieces

A **mid-century modern large dresser** doesn’t just store your belongings—it’s a canvas for styling. The Noak Solid Wood Dresser pairs beautifully with vases, trays, and sculptural objects. Add a mirror or artwork above, and suddenly, your dresser becomes the star of the room.



# 5. Recliners That Steal the Spotlight

Leather Recliners are no longer bulky and boring. The Brookfield Swivel Glider Recliner Chair — Ivory Leather is sleek, comfortable, and a statement piece. Add a small side table, a throw, and a decorative pillow, and you have a reading nook that looks straight out of a design blog.



# 6. Style Around Your TV Console

Tech furniture can dominate a room—but styling can make it work for you. A mid-century modern TV stand, like the Noak White TV Stand, keeps electronics organized while doubling as a design element. Add minimal accessories like plants, vases, or books, and your console becomes a curated piece instead of clutter.



# 7. Accessories That Wow Without Overdoing It

The real trick is intentional styling. Pillows, throws, and plants add texture and warmth without overpowering your clean-lined furniture. Stick to the “rule of threes,” mix heights and textures, and leave breathing room. These small choices turn any room into a space that feels magazine-ready.

Why? Because real photoshoots are insanely expensive.  
Like….

* A decent photoshoot for a brand or a model costs anywhere from **$800 to $5000+**,
* Editing adds another **$200–$500**,
* And you still wait **2–7 days** for results.

Meanwhile, AI can generate hundreds of styled, studio-quality shots in **under 60 seconds**.  
At BroadwayCrown, we’re literally doing it at **100x lower cost** (yep, you can get 100+ photos for the price of a coffee ).

But what’s wild is seeing how people use it :

* Fashion startups are using it to **prototype entire product shoots** before even making samples.
* Influencers use it to **create brand collabs** without flying anywhere.
* E-com stores say it **tripled their content output** with same budget.

It kinda feels like how Canva changed design or how ChatGPT changed writing : but now for photography.

We’re just starting out, but I genuinely think **AI photoshoots will replace 80% of traditional shoots** in next 3–5 years.  
If you’ve ever struggled with getting good visuals for your brand, product, or yourself, check it out.

1ny16g8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHome/comments/1ny16g8/which_thermal_underwear_type_is_best_for_layering/,Which thermal underwear type is best for layering?,"Hey everyone! As someone who's spent countless hours exploring different thermal wear options (and freezing my butt off in the process), I thought I'd share my experience about layering with thermal underwear. Trust me, getting this right can make or break your outdoor adventures.

First off, let me tell you that not all thermal underwear is created equal. After trying various types and materials, I've found that merino wool is absolutely fantastic for base layering. It's like having a personal temperature regulation system - keeps you warm when it's cold and cool when you're active.

But here's the thing - synthetic materials like polyester and nylon blends are also great choices, especially if you're on a budget. I recently discovered some amazing options at https://athometouch.com/thermal-underwear that combine performance with affordability. They're perfect for everyday wear and outdoor activities.

The key to effective layering is finding the right fit. You want your thermal underwear to be snug but not restrictive. Loose thermals create air pockets that mess up the whole insulation system. Think of it like trying to keep coffee hot in a leaky thermos - it just doesn't work!

Here's my tried-and-tested layering strategy:
- Base layer: Form-fitting thermal underwear
- Mid layer: Fleece or wool for insulation
- Outer layer: Weather-resistant shell

I've found that silk thermal underwear is super comfortable but less durable. If you're into winter sports or heavy outdoor activities, check out these high-performance options at https://athometouch.com/thermal-underwear - they've got some serious durability ratings.

Some pro tips I've learned:
- Avoid cotton at all costs (it retains moisture)
- Look for flatlock seams to prevent chafing
- Choose thumb holes for better sleeve coverage
- Get multiple weights for different conditions

Compression-style thermal underwear is great for athletic activities, while looser fits work better for casual wear. I personally prefer a middle ground - something that moves with me but isn't too tight.

Remember, the best thermal underwear is the one that matches your activity level and the weather conditions you'll face. Don't just go for the thickest option thinking it'll be the warmest - layering is all about adaptability.

Feel free to drop any questions in the comments. I'd love to hear about your experiences too!",1,1759601588.0,AskHome,0,1.0,False
