With a master’s degree in physics under my belt and an IT career keeping me grounded, I’m fueled by curiosity and caffeine as I prepare for the next big chapter.

I’m a thinker and a dreamer. Fascinated by the mysteries of the universe and the wisdom of ancient Greek philosophers. One day, I want to read ancient Greek, walk the ruins of historic cities, and uncover stories of those who lived millennia ago.

When I’m not lost in books or code, I’m training hard to finally sculpt that six-pack I've always wanted (I know life’s better with a little sugar).

If you share a love for adventure, I’m planning an epic motorcycle tour across Europe. Pillion seat’s open if you’re up for a ride, good conversation, and the open road.

What I’m looking for:

Someone who values deep conversations, curiosity, and a bit of spontaneity. If you’re passionate about life, open to new ideas, and maybe even love a good philosophical debate or a spontaneous road trip, we might just click.

If you want to explore the mysteries of the cosmos, the roads of Europe, or just share a quiet evening of coffee and conversation, say hi. Let’s start an adventure of our own.",1,1752178215.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Maybe the Biangle is variable for some reason, or some technology the intrepid heroes have yet to come across, I’m not sure. Like, I know I’ve seen movies with some kind of natural phenomena sending people to the past (although weirdly the only example I can think of is that Zac Efron movie 17 again, where he doesn’t go into the past, he just aged down, or maybe like a Groundhogs Day situation or something).

I’m struggling to stick it out for the love of *Final Fantasy* as a whole. You can agree, you can disagree, but don’t pee on my back and tell me it’s raining.

For some context: I’m a true Square Enix giga-simp. I’ve spent more money on Square games than Estinien has on pants with proper crotch coverage.

This is my fourth serious attempt to get into *FFXIV*, which is about three and a half more than any game should legally require. Possibly punishable under international law. We started with eight people, full of hope and White Monster. Now it’s just me and one other emotionally bankrupt optimist, clinging to the wreckage like survivors in a lifeboat made of cutscenes and unskippable exposition.

The pacing? Criminal. Genuinely indictable. It’s like the devs asked, “What if we made an MMO where you could only play alone and had to read 200,000 words of cabbage farmer lore while cosplaying as a mailman with abandonment issues?” I get it. Immersion. Slow burn. Big payoff. But it’s less of an epic journey and more of a mandatory unpaid internship in Eorzean agricultural history. And the worst part? I’ve played every *Final Fantasy*. I’ve sunk thousands of hours into MMOs. I’ve spent more money on Square games than most people spend processing a divorce. And still, every time I hit login, I have to gaslight myself into thinking this time, this time, it’s going to be fun. Just a couple more hours. If it isn't fun in the first five, it’s a tough sell to stick around for another 300. It’s like I’m developing Stockholm syndrome, and Yoshi-P is the only one for me.

So we begin. Eight veteran virgins descending into Eorzea, clinging to the last flickering hope that this MMO would fill the void modern ones left behind. Spoiler: it doesn’t. First crime against humanity? Go back and voice act the damn cutscenes in *A Realm Reborn.* That’s supposed to be your hook. The big, sweeping introduction. I’m arriving in a new world. Give me orchestras, ocean spray, birdsong. Anything to distract me from the fact that I’m now 33, unemployed in-game and out, and reading dialogue from a pirate with a name that sounds like a stroke. Instead, it’s awkward silence and PowerPoint-grade pacing while they wholesale plagiarize the *Skyrim* intro. And yes, every single person who spawned there said the exact same thing, because Square didn’t even try to hide it.

It sets the tone immediately. Welcome to your unpaid internship in fantasyland. Please read every line of cabbage farmer lore before we let you fight a single rat. But whatever. We’ve been here before. We stumble through the starting zones, soulless and obedient, and finally decide to meet in Limsa.

Now here’s the kicker. Two of us brain-dead, bunny-obsessed donkeys actually paid for the game, thinking we were buying the full experience. The rest were on the free trial, which meant forming a party involved sending invites like it was 2004. We stood there like unemployed quest givers, waiting to feel something that even remotely resembled playing together. Spoiler: it never came.

We had rules for our playthrough too, like real optimism was still alive in us. Everyone picked a starting class that contributed to a balanced team: two tanks, two healers, four DPS. Nobody overleveled, so we could all stay synced in the story. And other than that? We were told to explore. Have fun. Touch grass. The game, of course, had other plans. You also needed to Need on all drops to keep the toxicity, I mean, fun alive.

A week later, we all log back in. Freshly broken. Spiritually vacant. We go from one brown zone to another slightly browner zone, helping the good people of Eorzea, who apparently can’t walk more than 100 feet without collapsing from emotional exhaustion. It’s like living in a Pixar movie where I’m the sad little helper robot sent to solve everyone’s problems while they just stare into my soul. Especially the Lalafells. Those haunted porcelain dolls with legs so short and waddles so cursed, I swear they were designed specifically to guilt me into doing everything for them. I’ve never been more afraid of something under four feet tall.

That said, we did find a few things we genuinely liked. Crafting? Shockingly good. Deep, tactile, and satisfying. Like someone at Square Enix accidentally cared. For those of us who love crafting systems that feel integrated into the world, it was refreshing. At least early on. The one-character system? Loved it. As Classic WoW survivors, not having to reroll every time we wanted to try something new felt like escaping from a prison made of alts. And the graphics? Honestly, not bad for a 2013 game. They've aged like a bottle of wine left on a windowsill. Still drinkable, a bit sour, probably poisonous, but hey.

As for cutscenes, I’m talking about the cutscene. The one good one. The intro cinematic. The world ends. Reborn. Epic. And then? Nothing. Just a series of rooms full of weirdly dubbed soap opera dialogue and boss intros shorter than Amber Rose’s ponytail. I’ve had longer conversations with my dentist.

Sidequests? No complaints. Standard MMO stuff. You’re an unpaid delivery mule and everyone’s problems are now yours. But the real issue? It’s hard to tell what’s a main quest. One minute you’re saving the realm, the next you’re fetching soup for a man standing in the soup. And somehow both are marked with the same level of urgency.

So we finally reach our first dungeon. Grouping worked, shockingly, and two groups of four descend into what we assumed would be the beginning of some grand, epic adventure. Instead, we were met with a resistance force made entirely of wet napkins. I’ve seen my grandmother take on tougher mobs at a garage sale, with a purse in one hand and a coffee in the other. We breeze through the place, casually slapping around the simps of Sastasha like we were doing pest control in someone’s damp basement. Then we reach the final boss. Denn the Fishmonger. And before we could even process what was happening, he was dead. Mechanics? What mechanics? The man showed up, caught hands, and disappeared like a side character in a Family Guy cutaway. We stared at the loot chest like it had just personally insulted our expectations. That was the boss?

So we leave the dungeon and return to Limsa, more deflated than the Hindenburg on May 6, 1937. This was the moment we took our first casualties. We lost the women. Our only two female players. They both politely informed us that the game was boring, too easy, and honestly just not worth the emotional investment. And honestly? They were right. Now it was just six dudes standing in a digital circle jerk trying to cope. We spent the next twenty minutes not adventuring, but gaslighting these women into staying. As if asking them to endure more unskippable cutscenes and delivery quests was a reasonable request. It felt less like a co-op game and more like the opening act to an emotional hostage situation. But our words were futile. They left. And now they’ve gone on to enjoy gaming like millions of other people who play something else.

Afterward, we regrouped in Limsa like shell-shocked veterans of a war fought entirely in unskippable dialogue. Nobody said it out loud, but we all knew. The magic was gone. The women left, and with them went the last fragile threads of optimism holding this group together. The silence was deafening. Someone suggested doing more quests. Someone else muttered something about fishing. I tried crafting a new spear and wondered if this was how Square Enix designed grief stages into the gameplay.

We scattered. Each of us retreating to our coping mechanism of choice. One guy went into Gold Saucer hell. Another wandered Gridania like a ghost looking for his lost youth. I sat at the market board for 45 minutes, pricing out dye like it was going to fill the void where joy used to be. We weren’t adventurers anymore. We were six emotionally stunted men in funny hats trying to pretend we still had a group.

Eventually, even the real men faded away. One by one, they logged off and never came back. No ragequits. No goodbyes. Just hopped into a different Discord channel to enjoy games they could actually play with their friends. And in the end, it was just the two of us left. The last two Square simps who actually paid for this experience. We weren’t playing for fun anymore. We were playing out of financial guilt. We had skin in the game. Literally. At this point, logging in wasn’t about adventure or friendship or progress. It was about proving we weren’t wrong. That we hadn’t wasted our money. That maybe, just maybe, there was something at the end of this brown, text-filled tunnel worth seeing. Spoiler: we hadn’t found it yet.

So here we are. Both at level 30. Struggling to go on in A Realm Reborn. Knowing we’ll get our new in-game jobs soon, but also knowing we’re nowhere near getting real-life ones. I do intend to try and finish the game, just to say I did. And I may or may not update this bitter review when I do. Older. Jaded. Possibly free.

Also, please know. I’m not out to hurt anyone’s feelings. Just having a bit of fun. If you’re happy with the game and love it, I’m genuinely happy for you. I hope you enjoy it for years to come.

Just don’t ask me to log in tonight. I need to price dyes for a while.",0,1752178106.0,FinalFantasy,0,0.2,False

We texted for a bit, he was charming enough and I figured why not meet?

Over coffee, he casually drops that he just moved out of his old place and is currently between homes. Okay, red flag, but I didn’t want to judge too quickly.

A few days later, he asks if I live alone. I said yeah, I’ve got a small apartment. He literally replies:

That's perfect. Maybe I can come stay with you for a while? Just until I get back on my feet.

Mind you, this is after one coffee date.
I told him that’s not something I’m comfortable with, and he goes...
So you’re one of those women. Y’all say you want a real man but don’t want to support one.

Then he starts ranting about how women expect too much these days, and how he just needs someone loyal and giving who will invest in a man’s potential.

Later that night, he texts again....

For real tho, can I at least crash for the weekend? I don’t snore.

Dude. You don’t even have a toothbrush and you’re trying to move in like we’re married?

Very active. Do cardio 2-3 times a week, running. Lift weights 3 times a week. Non smoker, always have been. I drink a couple of glasses of red wine or 2-3 beers once a week. Both my father and one of his brothers died from heart attacks. But they were heavy smokers and drinkers. Quite unhealthy lifestyles. 

I watch my diet, eat one portion of red meat a week. Don't take sugar in my coffee. Eat plenty of fruit and veg, salmon once a week. All other protein is chicken, and not fried or drowned in sauce. If there's one thing I should and will cut down on, it's white pasta. Rarely eat cheese. Cook with olive oil. Not a candy guy, though i was on holiday last week and my diet did suffer a bit because of it! Blood tested Monday, got the results today. 

I've gotten my cholesterol checked last three years. Total cholesterol has gone from 184 to 199 to 210. LDL from 99 to 122 to 136. I'm hugely frustrated as I made significant changes to my diet and increased my exercise after last year's results. My triglycerides did drop from 95 to 80 and then to 58 this year. But if feels like the changes I've made so far haven't worked. I guess I'm just looking for some advice as someone who's made changes that have not had the desired results.

They came to the train station with a few minutes before the train and explained, so my wife gave them our credit card and pin and charger so they could get replacement everything whilst we went into the next country. Friend was pretty grateful.

Friend bought photos in prep and food then at the end of the day went to the day befores nightclub which had their bag with everything intact. Friend then catches a train the next day and we continue the holiday together.

1lwmp8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1lwmp8h/roommate_is_too_sheltered_to_be_responsible/,Roommate is too sheltered to be responsible.,"We’ve had our differences and tried to work through them, but I’ve arrived at the conclusion my roommate’s actions and habits can’t be fixed because they stem from an overall attitude of comfort and complacency. 

The other day I was preparing to wash our bathroom rugs after a long day of work. I folded them inwards and stacked them by the bathroom door for when our washer is cleared.

When she had to go use the bathroom, instead of getting new rugs or just helping me to do the laundry while I was dog tired and napping, she unraveled the old rugs and flipped them over so that the nasty sides were down (her hair, period blood, everything… against the ground.)

If I tell her what she did was wrong, she’ll stop doing it. But these actions of hers are endless.

Whenever the trash was full, she’d never take out the trash. Whenever the dishes I loaded were clean, she’d never help put them away, she just grabbed what she needed.

Even if the large issues are fixed now, there’s never a shortage of smaller ones. Now she’s constantly depleting things and not taking the initiative to replace them, like coffee creamer, printer ink... (I recently bought new ink and she depleted all of it on her own art projects.) Even if the coffee creamer issue is fixed, it’s like the same logic doesn’t apply to the printer ink or whatever item gets depleted next.

I hate nitpickers, so I hate that I’ve become someone who nitpicks when all this, like replacing whatever you use, should be common sense in the first place.

If it’s not sheltered students who used to have their parents doing most of the chores and buying necessities for them being the most irresponsible roommates… it’s roommates who are less financially well off than I am and claim I don’t help them in their hour of need… but never help me when I’m in my hour of need with common sense actions that are completely free.

Sorry for the long rant, but man, what does it take to have a reliable roommate??

Couple years ago, I moved down south to a humble little town settled near the wetlands. Nice place, small population, close enough to society so I don't go insane.

The head of the HOA-was surprised to find this town had one actually-gave me a grand welcome speech and a small set of rules. Basic stuff: don't litter, don't feed the wildlife, no major noise complaints, don't feed the wildlife, secure your garbage from pests and of course- don't feed the wildlife.

Now I grew up in the mountains of New Hampshire, I was no dumb yank thinking it was ok to feed Yogi table scraps. I don't think he meant anything by it either- but the heavy gentleman really wanted to get that last point across. Really rubbed me the wrong way, so I've kept to myself for the most part.

Recently we've been hit with a massive heatwave-I'm talking 110-120 degrees a day. The humidity has been sky rocketing; the air is so muggy you could cut it like cake and eat it.

Lucky for me-I have a pool.

20x40 in ground with a depth of 15 feet at the end. When the wave hit, I spent every waking hour either hunched over in my office with the A/C cranked or lounging in the perfectly kept 65-degree water. 

Needless to say, the neighbors despise me. They have to contend with rinky-dink kiddie pools and barely functioning central air. We live right at the edge of the marshland, not too swampy but wild enough that occasionally something with four legs would wander in-hell sometimes even slither in. My neighbor, Ricky, once found a reticulated python curled up in his garbage can.

That was a memorable trash day.

But we've never had any major problems with the wildlife-until three nights ago. It was 10pm-I was parked on the couch next to my gorgeous girlfriend Laura. She's three years younger than me but she already has so much of her life together.

I get by on a hefty inheritance while she works her ass off trying to get through college. She wants to be a marine biologist-a side effect from living her whole life next to a beach.

We were curled up in front of the TV-being bathed in the warm glow of prime-time television. I've been trying to get her into some of the all-time classics.

Though as her face grew pale and sickly as nazi prisoners sodomized each other-I probably should have started with a lighter program. She pulled away from me as a wheelchair bound inmate began to spin around and wax philosophy. 

""Sam this show is so tone death."" She moaned.

""Awe come on- I don't complain when we're watching your shows."" I bit back. 

""Yes, you do."" She countered. She had me there of course. Laura had bi-polar taste when it came to TV; somedays she wanted to watch some reality trash, the others a mind numbingly long nature doc about whales or penguin migration. I could stomach the trash but my god there's only so much you can learn about penguins before you want to blow your brains out.

She made her way over to the kitchen counter to fix herself a drink. She mumbled something else to herself, some unheard backhanded thing that would have caused a blowout I'm sure-so I chose to ignore it. Laura brushed her tawny curls out of her face as she passive-aggressively slammed a glass onto the marble counter.

To her back was the sliding glass door that led out the yard. The pool lights were dim-yet stood out like a beacon among the steady dark. You could barely make out the mini tiki hut tucked away at the pool's edge-the pride of my yard really. From outside you could hear the droning hum of cicadas in their relentless symphony.

Sheepishly- I got up and shyly attempted to make peace. I leaned on the counter-it felt as cold as her shoulder. I averted my gaze as I attempted an apology.

""You're right-like usual."" I offered. She paused mid pour. The coke flowed into her icy glass as she burned her corneas into my face. 

""And like usual you're deflecting from the real issue. This isn't about that stupid show, and you know it."" Her voice was venomous; she'd fit right in with the snakes in the wetlands. I winced at her words- my mind gazing back to the fight we had earlier in the week.

 ""I thought we got past that."" I uttered. She scoffed as she poured a splash of rum in her drink.

 ""No, you just decided we were done talking about it-you've spent this whole week acting like nothing's wrong."" She pressed.

 ""Laura, I told you-it isn't a good time for me; I've been swamped at work-the economy is so tight right now I can't afford two people living here."" I explained. 

""You ""work"" from home and you have a trust fund-what bills do you think you're paying."" She barked at me.

""Uh-the pool, the 300$ rum you're guzzling right now, the 50-inch flat screen-"" I listed. 

""Why don't you just admit you don't want to commit-I graduate in three months, just rip the band-aid off now!"" Laura cried. Her voice cracked as she did and I was instantly flooded with guilt. ""We've been dating for two years Sam. It's starting to feel like a waste.""

She turned away from me and looked out to the yard, drink in hand. I heard a muffled sniffle as I stewed in my guilt. I love her-shouldn't that be enough? If she moved in, I'd have to change up the whole decor, my whole routine. It just wouldn't flow right.

Besides she was going to be off the whole summer on an internship so what would be the point. I swear I think she's just picking fights, so I'll beg her to stay. Still as I watched her silently gaze out the glass door-I felt a twinge of regret.

I saddled up behind her, trying to find the right words. She leaned into the sliding door, squinting as she did. I tapped her shoulder and she squeaked out a gasp and twirled around to meet my gaze. She pointed out to the pool-gripping her rum and coke to her chest as she did. 

""Sam there's an alligator in your pool.""  She motioned to the dark. I groaned in annoyance and peered out as well. At first it was hard to tell what I was looking for, the tikihit looked untouched, grass trimmed neatly; then I focused on the pool.

There was a long shadow sulking in it-this bulky, mishappen thing floating there in the deep end. It was big-from inside I guessed about 15 feet at least. There was this hump dead center in the thing-about five feet in an arch. I couldn't make out any markings or colors-but on either side of the gator were these piercing green eyes.

They seemed to glow in the night, a haunting monster lounging in MY pool. It wasn't my first gator-they're worse than deer down here- but something about these eyes unnerved me. There was thought behind them, like it was watching us back.

I opened the sliding door and was smacked in the face by the humid night. I tiptoed out and Laura grabbed my arm. 

""Sam what are you doing?"" She hissed at me. I broke away and spoke at a low whisper.

""I just want to get a better look at it. He's basking-won't bug me if I keep my distance."" I calmly explained. She darted her eyes back to the lounging creature.

""Be careful- I think there's something wrong with it."" She couldn't take her sight off that bizarre hump on the thing-like a ridged arch almost. I shook my head and stepped closer. The grass felt cool and moist under foot-you could almost hear the squelch with every step. A few feet and I was stepping on tiled stone, the ""beachhead"" tiki bar overlooking the base of the pool.

I had set up all the bar stools and tiki decor near the deep end-so I could get plastered and just dive right in. Makes for some fun parties. My only light was the low pool LEDs lining the sides. They casted a thick shadow on our guest-but up close I got a better idea of the size.

It was 20 feet easy-slim but leathery skin gripping to it. Those light bulbs never left me-I could feel the gator drilling a hole into the side of my head. I was fumbling under the tiki bar-searching for the deck light switch.

It was a swanky set up I had; Christmas lights embedded around the roof and four flood lights on any corner. When I finally switched it on-the tiki bar burst to life with ravenous energy. The backyard became flooded with sparkling illumination.

It then quickly became apparent the thing in my pool was not an alligator.

I was met with this massive square snout-rows of pointed teeth sprouting out in a faux smile. The thing was brown and scaley-stripes of lemon yellow painted its ridged back. The ridge ran all the way down its tail-which swayed in the water like an eel.

The monster was keeping itself afloat with massive trunk-like hindlegs with three pointed talons that looked like they could easily slice me open. Its maw was flat-loose skin folded in on itself like a gular fold you'd see on a croc's neck.

That's sort of what looked like- a mutant crocodile on steroids. The creature blinked-and three eye lids folded back to reveal reptilian eyes-lime green around the slitted iris. Its arms were folded near the chest, meaty looking paws that looked like they could maul a bear.

I stood there safely behind the tiki bar-ignoring the fact that all that was between me and this monster was wicker and cheap plaster. There was this awful smell surrounding it as well-like a swamp full of sweat. For what seemed like eons we just locked eyes with each other, like we were trying to figure each other out.

From the bowels of the beast, I heard this guttural snore. It emitted a low bellow-a warning maybe. I backed away slowly, and the monster unfolded its arms. It grabbed the edge-each of its six fingers at least a foot long and ending in gnarled black claw. It slowly began to pull itself out of the pool-water sliding off the beast's hide with ease.

It didn't break its gaze on me once. I looked around-there was nothing to defend with besides poorly made barstools. The gaping maw slowly opened-the monster bellowed at me-this reptilian hiss that sent shivers down my spine. It had dragged half of its body out when I snapped out of it and booked it back to the back door.

The monster lunged, throwing itself onto the tiki bar. I didn't look back, but I heard a deafening collapse as it shattered the tiki bar under its weight. The lights snapped off-enveloping me in inky dark. My only saving grace was the beckoning backdoor-a glorious beacon among the blackness of the pit.

Laura opened the door for me-I bolted in as she slammed it shut. The sliding glass rattled and wobbled like it was going to collapse. I ran into the counter- a wild eye on me. I twirled around to see my pursuer had given up almost immediately.

It slunk back into the cool of the pool, dragging a trail of broken wicker and tangled lights with it. It swam around for a moment then went back to basking in the moonlight-those emerald embers shinning in the dark.

I caught my breath as Laura studied the creature, curiosity overtaking her like a cat in heat. 

""Laura get away from the door."" I harshly spoke. She stepped back slightly, barely listening to what I was saying. She turned to me-eyes lighting up like a child on Christmas. 

""Sam it's a dinosaur!"" She squealed. She was practically leaping up and down in awe-dare I say she was giddy. She seemed oblivious to the fact the thing had nearly squashed me. I saddled up next to her, disdain for the beast striking my face.

""Laura, that's impossible. It's a-mutant or something.  Crocodile got into some industrial run off or something."" I muttered, more to convince myself than anything. The dinosaur bellowed in the night-like a low-grade foghorn.

It seemed satisfied that it had chased me off and was just- chilling in my pool now. Laura pointed out the ridge and started raving about it.

 ""Look at that arc, almost a perfect 180."" She whistled. ""It probably wandered in from the marshlands. If it's hot here I can't imagine the sauna fuming out there.""

""Laura please just get away from the window-what if its hungry and decides it wants a midnight snack."" I spoke, realizing how frail and smashable my six hundred-thousand-dollar home was. I ran around the house like a mad man, switching lights off and drawing blinds.

Laura was following me around like a puppy dog and yapping like one as well. She had her phone out taking pictures, talking about the ""greatest discovery in history"" and ""She would call her marine bio professor in the morning.""

That last bit seemed like a dig to me-that was the guy who was dragging her away on a three-month internship in the Atlantic. She was blinded by childlike wonder-meanwhile I'm the one who actually came face to fang with that thing.

Course I wasn't going to let her go out and experience the wonder for herself-that would be a shitty thing to do. Instead, we hunkered down in my room with all the lights off and waited till morning.

I didn't sleep a wink that night. My bedroom is on the second floor-decent sized room and there's a massive bay window looking out into the backyard. I get a nice view of the yard- the hulking cypress and strangling vines, looks like something out of *Jungle Book* sometimes.

I laid in bed like a coward-watching this creature just swim gently around the pool. At times it brayed out into the night-and to my terror I realized I've heard that mournful groan before. There have been times late into the night where I'd be sitting at the tiki bar in a drunken haze and I'd listen to the midnight loon calls and the swamp symphony.

I'd hear thunderous cries and rapid chirps-like a hawk scatting to itself. I'd sit there and think ""*Damn that's a big gator*."" Fireflies would swirl around to match my vision-and I'm beginning to think some of those waltzing orbs weren't fireflies. Some of them stood in place-stalking spheres that always seemed to linger but disappeared in a blink.

While I was crashing out-Laura sat cross legged by the window taking notes like she was on safari. Around 4am I passed out-and only awoke to the searing sunlight crossing in. I sat up to find Laura was gone, and the pool was empty. I'd chalk the whole thing up to some fever dream-but that wouldn't account for my tiki bar laying in pieces and the wicker debris floating calmly in the pool.

I raced downstairs-calling out to Laura. I heard her arguing with someone in the kitchen as she was packing up her purse. Her phone was glued to her head as she rummaged around for something.

 ""-No Brian I- you saw the photos; you know me why would I make something like this up? Well, it was dark I- no I'm coming now I just can't find my keys. Alright I'll talk more when I get in."" She hung up on Brain as I cleared my throat. She looked up, excitement having not left her face since midnight. 

""Oh, good you're up. There's coffee on the stove- I got to head to class I'm in a rush. Keep an eye out for our friend just-be careful ok Sam?"" she leaned in for a quick peck on the cheek before I could get a word in.

""Wait-that's it? What about the giant lizard in my yard?"" I whined, not a proud moment I admit.

""Call me if it comes back-I saw it lumber off into the swamp around 5- I think it's hunting."" She oozed fascination with it. ""That was Brian- my professor. He's-skeptical obviously but I think I can convivence him. This is huge Sam-It could make my whole career."" 

""That-that's great."" I stammered, half happy for her, half terrified at the prospect of the dino coming back.  ""But what if it does come back? I don't have a gun or anything-what if it tries to break in?"" I whispered. She scoffed at my fear and went towards the front door after finally fishing her keys out. 

""I did some research while you slept-as long as you keep your distance it'll leave you alone. You've lived her two years without incident-if it's been out there at least that long it would it would have attacked by now. It's just hot."" She shrugged her shoulders-completely dismissing my concerns. With that she waved goodbye and drove off in her jeep, leaving me alone at the door.

I spent the morning texting her ""updates"" as I cleaned up the mess it left in its wake. I say updates but really, I was just telling her I was ok and making sure she wasn't freaking out in secret. She was taking the whole thing way too easy in my opinion.

I think she's a thrill junkie- I took her scuba diving for our first-year anniversary and some sharks showed up. Everyone else in the group nearly drowned each other trying to get back on the boat but Laura?

She kept her distance, but she was all in-she was so graceful-dancing around the fined menaces like it was nothing. When I finally pulled her out of the water she complained and wanted to keep going, started going on and on about shark bite statistics and how they ""never really bite"" and ""You were more likely to get mauled by a moose then bit by a shark.""

I love her but she's nuts when it comes to stuff like that. Me personally? I'm perfectly content staying in and watching the game-brew in hand. Anyway, I started cleaning up what was left of the hut, I was also sweating like a pig and nervously watching the tree line.

My mind was screwing with me; I was jumping at every little shadow and call echoing out from the swamp. Any time the bushes moved I'd freeze and raise a piece of cracked wood in my hand like a club.

I don't know what I thought I'd do against it but if I could jam the thing in an eye socket it would buy me sometime. By noon I had collapsed onto a beach chair- I had raked most of the fallen wires and stuff out of the pool and I just wanted to relax.

Unfortunately, God wanted to fuck with me personally- because it was that moment I heard thudding coming from the swamp. The tree line parted ways as the dinosaur emerged from the swamp. In the midnight sun I was able to get a clear look at the thing.

It was more wide than tall, only standing a few feet off the ground. The ridge gave off this brilliant yellow hue as the stripes traveled down the dino's spine and up its head. It formed a downward arrow at the base of the skull, pointing up the duck-billed maw. It was supporting its weight on all fours, talon-like arms caked in mud and what appeared to be dried blood.

The undercarriage of the dino was stone white and Scalley, like the belly of a croc. Its chainmail like scutes were too numerous to count, but varied in their shades as it traveled the length of this hulking beast. In its maw it carried a fresh kill- the bloody body of a whit-tailed doe lay limp in its grasp.

It was secured in a vice grip yet carried gently-like it didn't want to waste any part before it could safely eat at its den. The beast slumped forward- dipping a painted claw in the shallow end. It cooed like it was delighted and threw itself in pointing its maw to the sky to keep the well-earned meal dry.

It began to chew and chomp at the bits-a dog with his bone. I heard what was left of the deer's skeleton crack and splinter as the dino snapped its jaws-eager to spill the meat down its gullet. I turned away, grimacing as it feed.

I was halfway between the pool and backdoor-I'll give Laura this, she was right. The dino was completely ignoring me. Granted it had a fresh meal now. It swam to the edge of the deep and rested the deer carcass on the pool deck.

It raised itself up like it carefully, like it was sitting down at the dinner table, and grabbed each end and tore into it. I could hear flesh peeling away from shattered bone as it gleefully had its fill. Even as it feed- I could feel its emerald gaze out of the corner of its eye. Like it was daring me to try and take the meal.

Instead, I took my chair and scooted further away. After it was done it left what little remained to rot on the grass- and pulled away from the edge. It lazily drifted in the pool, aimlessly basking in the heat. It took notice of me once and-growled, I think. At least that's what I think that low guttural bellow meant when I tried to resume clean-up.

It also raised its log of a tail and splashed down-spraying me with ice cold water when I got too close. I jumped back and gasped, those icy droplets burned my tanned hide. I gave up and started to head back inside.

That's when I noticed a beige bucket hat bobbing up and down past the fence. My neighbor Ricky poked his head up and leaned over, a friendly smile etched on his fiery red face.

 ""Morning Sam! Lotta commotion this morning everything-"" He paused as he took notice of the leviathan lounging in the water. I thought he would take off screaming but instead he whistled at it in admiration. ""Well, I'll be damned-ya got Lucile in your yard. Awe that's quite an honor friend."" He offered. I Looked at him slack jawed. I ran up to him, frantically pointing at the monster evidently named ""Lucile."" 

""Rick, you look at that-that thing and then look me in the eyes. You're telling me that's normal?!?"" I shrieked at him. He simply shrugged. 

""Been a few years since she roamed this far in-but it's just Lucile. She's harmless-all things considered. Didn't Wayne give you the rundown when ya first moved in?"" he offered.

I recalled when the head of the HOA- a portly balding man who I vaguely remember being named Wayne- trying to give me a packet and explain some stuff. I assumed it was just a list of dues I'd pay later and by that point I was tired and rundown so I kind of kicked him to the curb.

In my defense I was really hungover and jetlagged, had a lot of unpacking to do. Hadn't heard a peep from him since. Like I said I tried to keep to myself-have a lot going on and I travel a lot for work.

I explained all this to Ricky who got a weird look on his face. He sheepishly stepped away from the fence and mumbled something.

""What was that?"" I snapped at him.

""Nothing Sam. Listen don't worry about Lucile-it's this damn heat its drawing all sorts of critters out of the woodwork. I got something mussing around my birdfeeder as well-know what I mean?"" He hinted. I was drawing a blank to be honest and stood silent.

""I'll give Wayne a shout and see if he can swing by at some point-he can probably explain it better than I can. You have a good day then buddy."" he flashed that southern charm at me than swaggered back to his house.

That was a couple days ago-and I am at my wits end now. ""Lucile"" has completely taken over my yard-she leaves animal carcass lying around, she lumbers around in the pool all damn day and night, and she snaps at me when I go near her.

I'm half tempted to lure her back into the swamp with a pile of sirloins or something like that-because I want my damn pool back. I told animal control there was a ""croc"" because who would believe it otherwise right?

Like I said before they came and ran almost immediately. No one in the neighborhood seems bothered by this, in fact I've had people try to come behind to get a photo of her like she's a novelty act. People go in Rick's yard, and I see them peering over the fence like peeping toms. I tell them to get lost and they get mean and snarky.

Am I the asshole here?

Everyone is just acting so damn nonchalant like this is an everyday thing its driving me up the wall. Laura has been texting me non-stop, bugging me for updates on what she's doing. She's stuck at her dorm for the rest of the week but every few minutes I get text from her.

It's kind of nice actually, we haven't talked like this in a couple months. I just wish we were talking about literally anything else. I'm not interested in where it came from- I just want to keep it out of my yard.

Wayne is supposed to stop by tomorrow and break it down for me but I'm not holding my breath for any quick solutions. I'll update if anything comes up but for now-does anyone had any ideas on how to reclaim my yard from this frigging dinosaur?",1,1752177811.0,deepnightsociety,0,1.0,False

Experience – Overall positive, maybe very positive

Perspective: married couple with young kids at home looking to relax together

Note: This is the full review, I do not plan on being this detailed on other review sites. I say this, because I think I’m being pretty picky here about the small things that weren’t perfect. None of these issues were terrible, but as a reader on this thread, I’m assuming you want all the details.

* Like MANY reviews state, the service at this resort is lacking. My impression was that most regular staff members are there to do their jobs, not particularly happy to see you. However, managers are going around frequently asking how they can help and how things are going.  We read the reviews prior to arriving, and that was great to set the bar low.  Some staff, mentioned below, were lovely. Kudos to them to their hard work and hospitality. As for any actual sub-par staff interaction, see the arrival/departure points.
* General comment on tipping. At least at this resort, we didn’t openly tip on the front end of interactions, and maybe that’s why the service is somewhat- meh.  We did tip here and there for people to people who were good and deserved it, and, sure, we got more smiles out of those people after the tip.
* Arriving late afternoon/early evening on Thursday: The island had a big rainstorm right before we landed. The wifi/TVs/hotel system were out. They could not book our dinners upon arrival like many reviews say to do due to the wifi being out/system being down.  Janeele checked us in at Club Concierge and walked us to our room. While she was polite and helpful, almost everything was like “if you want dinner reservations, call xyz but everything is down now so you can’t do that.” She was knowledgeable but wasn’t helpful with actual solutions. And, maybe there were no solutions at that time, which is fine.  However, by the time the system came back up, ideally, she would have reached out to help us book everything. By the time we came over in person the next morning to the downstairs concierge desks, all reservation dining was unavailable. We had to keep going back to Club Concierge to ask for availability. Eventually, it worked out and we got almost all the dining experiences we wanted.
* Thursday Dinner: We grabbed a late dinner at Tesoro. Food was very good. Chicken parm + arrabiata penne, chicken alfredo, and appetizers were all great.
* Friday: Spent the morning trying to get organized with dining. Breakfast: Walked over to La Plume, 10-minute wait for a table. Food was delicious. Afternoon: Headed over to the resort beach, not much was available in terms of seating.  It’s clear that butlers/blue coolers have that all prioritized very early.  Staff member Mikah approached us and helped us get comfortable on some beach chairs, and he checked in with us periodically.  The beach is truly beautiful.  We did tip Mikah after he offered wonderful service and conversation/insight into the resort. He was lovely.  Lunch: Waited 5-10 minutes for a table for the restaurant by the pool. I think we went late like around 2:30 and some dishes were unavailable by then. Go earlier that 2:30. Food was good.  
* Friday Dinner: Club level concierge was not able to get us into butch’s as desired, but we were able to get a back-door reservation to Gordon’s (not a restaurant with outward public reservations, but staff can put one in for you). No wait due to this back-door reservation. Food was very good – swordfish, lamb, and steak.  
* Entertainment: After dinner every night, there is some kind of cutesy entertainment in the Coconut Grove area. After that, most people go to their rooms, drink by the Coconut Grove bar/dip in the pool, go to the Piano Bar/billiards room area, or the Queen’s Pearl pub. Something for everyone. Coconut Grove bartenders to note with fun personalities: Sheldeen, Valentino, Mikah.
* Saturday and Sunday (we did the same thing except for dinner plans): Breakfast: Tesoro – GREAT omelet station. Otherwise, decent/proficient. 10am boat to island. Got in line on the pier at 9:40am. The boat takes the first 40 people. We made it on and hustled to the snorkeling side of the island for a private cabana. **BEST PART OF THIS TRIP**. This island makes the whole resort worth it. Lunch on the island is very good – smash burger is the real winner here though. Tasha is very sweet and provided great service throughout lunch. Thomas at the bar is great.  Snorkeling was lovely, *but I think if I have any recommendation, it’s to take your own snorkel + mask*. Snorkeling is open 11-3pm, and the island is open 10am-4:50pm. I wish I would have had the freedom to snorkel about the whole time. This is minor, I’m just sharing extra details.  Another detail that is lovely to note: the island has a soft sand/chill side and a rocky beach/snorkel side.  There is staff that comes by and rakes any seaweed off to the side in the morning – not that there was a lot by any means, but there was a little. Just a nice touch. I didn’t see any seaweed on the soft sand beach side or the resort beach area.
* Saturday Dinner: Butch’s.  At some point on Friday, one of the club concierge visits finally yielded a 9:30 reservation. At 7:30 on Saturday, as we were getting ready, we got a call from the restaurant to offer us an 8pm/8:30pm dining time due to some cancellations. This was a lovely call to get, and we accepted.  Butch’s surf/turf, sides, and dessert were all amazing.
* Sunday Dinner: Kimonos at 6:30. Sake was great, food was great. Temp in the restaurant is warm, just a heads up. Chef did a great job with cooking and his presentation – Ram. Server Latrell was fun and attentive.
* Sunday Picture Session: Had our free photo session right before dinner at 6pm. During summer months, this was too early. It was nowhere near sunset time. I really only wanted a couple pics to purchase, so I was fine with it. Just a heads up for those that might be really banking on special pictures. Photographer was great – didn’t catch his name, very funny. We finished in 20 minutes tops. Digital Pics are $20 each.
* Food trucks at Coconuts Grove: Crepes/Ice cream/Coffee and a Conch snacks truck. Both were fantastic.
* Gift Shop/Cigars. Gift shop has Bahamian cigars. Husband said these were better than the Cubans that the peddler at the beach was selling bc the Cubans were dry ($30).  The gift shop Bahamian cigars are kept in a humidor by the door, about $20-$25 each.
* Departure: Staff did not leave us any paperwork about our shuttle or departure. Flight was at 10:30am (on a Monday morning).  I went over to club concierge the Sunday night around 9pm to inquire about departure options. They had this whole plan to have us check out at 6:45am and be on the 7am shuttle – without telling us.  I knew we had TSA precheck and global entry so I filled out a paper declining the 7am shuttle and requesting the 8am shuttle. Janeele accepted my form and sent me on my way.  The next day, there was no space for us on the 8am shuttle. Janeele had not moved us over as we discussed. However, no one had called us at the room as if we had missed the 7am shuttle. Thankfully, the group/driver at 8am squeezed me in the back and my husband in the front seat of the shuttle. We made it, and we had plenty of time due to precheck/global entry – whole process took 15 minutes and we were inside the gates area by 9:15am.
* Things we didn’t get to do: Water sports like the water bike, sailing, or kayaking. Kanoo restaurant. Queen’s Pearl. La Plume dinner. Pickleball/tennis activities. Spa or massages on the private island. ",1,1752177700.0,SandalsResorts,0,1.0,False
1lwmlga,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDrugstore/comments/1lwmlga/do_preworkout_supplements_hurt_or_help_your_sex/,Do Pre-Workout Supplements Hurt or Help Your Sex Life?,"How can pre-exercise supplements help boost or hinder your sex life?

Many people have experienced crushing workouts after consuming pre-exercise supplements. These are designed to enhance one's focus, energy, and endurance. But, are these also good for one's sex life?

Your sexual health should be top-of-mind regardless of whether you're training for a race, maintaining an active lifestyle, or lifting heavy. Since taking supplements can affect your body both physically and hormonally, it's important to understand their effects on performance, libido, and sex drive.

The following guide aims to answer the questions about the effects of pre-workout supplements on one's sexual health.

The effects of supplements on one's sexual health are discussed in this guide.

Before jumping into the waters of how these supplements can affect your sexual health, you must first understand what's in them.

One serving of these can contain around 150 to 300mg of caffeine, which is equivalent to around two to three cups of coffee. They help boost focus, energy, and metabolic rate.

Beta-Alanine can help reduce the buildup of lactic acid in the muscles.

This substance can help enhance muscle gain, power output, and strength.

The effects of nitric oxide can also improve blood flow and enhance sexual function.

B vitamins are vital for converting food into energy and supporting the functioning of the cellular system.

A survey conducted in 2021 revealed that over 70% of gym-goers use pre-workouts, often without realizing their effects on their overall health.

According to Dr. Emily L. Littleton, a wellness expert and registered dietitian, taking pre-exercise supplements could lead to different side effects, including one that's related to sexual function.

Is It Possible to Improve Your Sexual Life With Supplements?

Let's delve into the potential advantages.

One of the most significant advantages of taking supplements is their ability to enhance sexual function.

One of the most notable advantages of taking supplements is how it can improve one's circulation. The ingredients of these substances, such as L-Citrulline, can convert nitric oxide into a compound that can enhance blood flow.

This mechanism is similar to the way many erectile dysfunction drugs work. Some studies suggest that L-citrulline could be an effective natural alternative to drugs for mild ED.

According to Dr. Alex Thomason, a Cleveland Men's Health Center doctor, men who want to improve their sexual endurance can take nitric oxide boosters.

Dr. Alex Thomason claims that men who want to enhance their sexual performance can take supplements containing nitric oxide.

One common issue when it comes to intimacy is fatigue, which can occur after a long day or stressful work week. Taking supplements can help boost alertness and allow users to feel ready for both sexual and physical activities.

One should always monitor the amount of caffeine in a serving. For optimal results, it should be around 150 to 200mg per serving.

Increased confidence and mood can boost one's desire.

The release of endorphins by exercising can boost one's mood and increase one's self-esteem. This can be combined with a pre-exercise boost to enhance one's confidence and sexual health.

According to sex therapist Jamie Levan, high confidence can be overlooked in people's sexual satisfaction. He said that when individuals feel strong and healthy, their self-belief can influence their sexual desire.

Different ingredients can provide support for testosterone.

Some pre-workouts contain ingredients such as zinc, D-aspartic acid, and fenugreek, which are believed to help boost one's testosterone levels and enhance sexual desire. Although there are not enough studies to confirm the effects of these supplements, some individuals reported experiencing an increase in sexual desire after taking them.

When choosing a supplement, ensure that it has undergone third-party testing and that it lists the ingredients in a transparent manner. Also, avoid products that have ""proprietary blends.""

Taking pre-workouts can negatively affect one's sexual health.

Although there are numerous advantages to taking pre-workouts, there are still risks associated with this practice.

One's sexual desire may be disrupted by excessive stimulation.

High doses of caffeine can also cause users to feel anxious and restless. This can interrupt arousal, especially in women.

A study conducted in 2023 revealed that almost 40% of participants experienced restlessness and sleep disturbance as a result of their use of pre-workouts.

The study also found that almost 40% of the participants experienced an imbalance of their adrenal hormones.

The overuse of certain stimulants can also stress the adrenal glands, which can result in mood swings, chronic fatigue, and decreased sex hormone levels.

According to Dr. Rachel Kim, an expert in naturopathic endocrinology, the prolonged use of stimulants can also affect the reproductive system.

Although ""adrenal fatigue"" isn't a recognized condition, many experts believe that prolonged exposure to stimulants can trigger hormonal imbalances, which can decrease one's sexual desire.

Withdrawal and dependency symptoms are some of the issues associated with taking supplements.

The body gradually begins tolerating pre-workouts, which can result in users increasing their dosage to match the effects.

If one relies on pre-workouts for various reasons, such as boosting confidence or sexual desire, then this practice might be a sign of dependency.

Some of the ingredients found in pre-workouts are unregulated and may not be safe to use.

Many pre-workouts also contain harsh stimulants or are disguised as energy blends. These can increase the risk of accidentally interfering with one's hormonal levels or medications.

Many underground brands also contain banned substances or compounds not approved for human use. These can affect ED treatments and antidepressants.

Always ensure that the supplements you buy are from trusted sources and have NSF certifications. Consult with your doctor if you're taking medications or have a health condition.

There are also various safety precautions that one should take when it comes to sexual health and pre-workout use.

Contrary to popular belief, using pre-workouts does not have to negatively affect one's sexual life.

Make sure to read the label carefully. For instance, avoid products that contain more than 200mg of caffeine or those that have vague claims such as ""focus matrix.""

Follow a cycle of your supplement intake to help promote adrenal recovery and avoid dependency.

For optimal results, avoid using pre-workouts more than three times a week for high-intensity workouts.

Look for trusted brands and choose products that have been through third-party testing. You should also consider taking supplements that contain botanical extracts and natural caffeine sources.

Dehydration can affect one's desire and performance by decreasing blood flow.

Make sure to pay attention to the effects of your supplement. If you're experiencing a sleepless or anxious feeling after using a pre-workout, switch to a non-stimulated alternative or lower your dosage.

Sexual wellness and pre-workout use can coexist.

When utilized correctly, supplements for pre-workout can help enhance one's sexual health and fitness. With the help of certain nutrients, such as blood flow, mood, and energy, it's possible to improve one's overall well-being, including their sexual life.

Unfortunately, overuse of certain supplements can result in various issues, such as mental fatigue, an imbalanced hormonal balance, and a reduction in sexual desire.

Follow a healthy lifestyle and start with a small amount of supplements.

**INT. LGBI AIRPORT, GUWAHATI - DAY**  

The camera pans over the bustling Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport. It’s peak July, but the air feels surprisingly crisp, with a few clouds dotting the sky. The sound of announcements hums in the background.  

We focus on **ARJUN** (28s, clean-cut, slightly frazzled, corporate attire), dragging a sleek suitcase. His face betrays the exhaustion of a work trip, but his eyes are wide, taking in the newness of Guwahati.  

**ARJUN (V.O.)**  
A rush in the airport, a sudden change of breeze—it never hit me quite like it did here. Gurgaon was chaos, but Guwahati? It felt… different. Like the air was whispering something I couldn’t yet understand.  

He glances at his phone, scrolling through Reddit, where he’s posted in r/Guwahati: *“In town for a day on a work trip. Never been to the Northeast. What’s a must-do?”*  

A notification pings. A user named *NortheastNightingale* responds: *“Welcome to Guwahati! If you’ve got a day, I can show you the real deal.”*  

Arjun hesitates, then types: *“Really? That’d be amazing. Free for coffee today?”*  

Cut to a quick montage of Reddit DMs—playful, curious, and warm.  


**INT. CITY CENTRE MALL, COFFEE SHOP - DAY**  

Arjun sits at a cozy corner table, nervously checking his watch. The coffee shop is vibrant, with Assamese artwork on the walls and the aroma of fresh brews.  

Enter **Nishita** (20s, bright-eyed, wearing a colorful mekhela chador with a modern twist). She spots Arjun, waves, and strides over with a contagious smile.  

**Nishita**  
(cheerful)  
You must be Arjun! Not hard to spot the guy looking like he’s about to present a PowerPoint.  

**ARJUN**  
(laughs, loosening up)  
Guilty as charged. And you’re… NortheastNightingale?  

**Nishita**  
Call me Nishita. Ready to see Guwahati through my eyes?  

They clink coffee cups. The chemistry is instant—her warmth disarms his corporate stiffness.  

**Nishita (V.O.)**  
She was like the breeze outside—unexpected, refreshing, and pulling me into a world I didn’t know I needed.  


**EXT. GUWAHATI STREETS - DAY**  

A montage of Arjun and Nishita exploring the city. They weave through vibrant markets, Nishita pointing out local crafts and teasing Arjun about his “city boy” vibe.  

**Nishita**  
(holding up a bamboo souvenir)  
This is handmade by artisans in Kamrup. You’re not leaving without something real, okay?  

**ARJUN**  
(grinning)  
Deal. But only if you explain why everyone here is so… nice.  

**Nishita**  
(laughs)  
It’s the Northeast magic. Wait till you try the food.  


**INT. NAGAMESE RESTAURANT - DAY**  

The restaurant is cozy, with wooden decor and the scent of spices. Nishita orders a spread of Assamese dishes—masor tenga, pork with bamboo shoot, and pithas for dessert. Arjun looks overwhelmed but intrigued.  

**Nishita**  
(eyes sparkling)  
This is Assamese soul food. The tenga is tangy, the bamboo shoot is earthy, and the pithas? Pure love on a plate.  

Arjun takes a hesitant bite of the pork, then his eyes light up.  

**ARJUN**  
Okay, wow. This is… incredible. Why isn’t this everywhere?  

**Nishita**  
(playful)  
Because you’ve been stuck in your Gurgaon bubble! The Northeast is a whole universe. Our food, our culture—it’s about community, stories, roots.  

She leans in, sharing tales of Assamese festivals like Bihu and the tea gardens of Assam. Arjun is captivated, hanging onto her every word.  

**ARJUN (V.O.)**  
In one lunch, she painted a world I’d never seen. I wanted to step out of my comfort zone, taste every dish, visit every corner she described.  


**INT. QALA BAKERY - AFTERNOON**  

The bakery is a quaint haven, with glass displays of pastries and the smell of fresh bread. Nishita picks out a coconut-laden sweet and also the tiramisu and hands it to Arjun.  

**Nishita**  
Best bakery in town. This is our version of comfort food.  

They sit by the window, nibbling on sweets. The conversation deepens—Nishita talks about her love for preserving Northeast culture through her blog, while Arjun admits he’s been coasting through life, chasing deadlines.  

**ARJUN**  
(earnest)  
You’re so… alive. I’ve been to a dozen cities this year, but I’ve never *seen* them. Not like this.  

**Nishita**  
(sincere)  
That’s what travel should be. Not ticking boxes, but feeling a place. Promise me you’ll explore more—really explore.  

**ARJUN**  
(nods, smiling)  
Promise. And I’m adding Assam to my bucket list. Maybe… with a guide?  

Nishita laughs, her eyes twinkling with possibility.  


**EXT. BRAHMAPUTRA RIVERFRONT - SUNSET**  

The two walk along the serene Brahmaputra River, the sky painted in hues of orange and pink. They’re quieter now, comfortable in each other’s presence.  

**Nishita**  
(softly)  
Guwahati’s not just a stopover, you know. It’s a feeling. I hope you carry it with you.  

**ARJUN**  
(looking at her)  
I will. And not just Guwahati.  

Their eyes meet, a moment of unspoken connection. The camera pulls back, capturing them against the river’s glow, a perfect snapshot of a fleeting, beautiful day.  

**ARJUN (V.O.)**  
One day, one city, one stranger who felt like anything but. Guwahati wasn’t just a place on a map anymore—it was a spark. A reason to wander, to taste, to live.  


**INT. LGBI AIRPORT - NIGHT**  

Arjun stands at the departure gate, suitcase in hand. He checks his phone—a new Reddit DM from Nishita: *“Come back for Bihu. I’ll save you a pitha.”* He smiles, typing back: *“Deal. But only if you’re my guide again.”*  

As he boards his flight, he looks out the window at the twinkling lights of Guwahati, a new addition to his bucket list—and maybe something more.

1lwmjjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1lwmjjd/could_the_oxo_rapid_brewer_coffee_maker_review/,Could the OXO Rapid Brewer Coffee Maker Review Transform Your Morning Coffee Routine?,"The OXO 8722500 Rapid Brewer Coffee Maker landed on my countertop a few weeks ago, and I’ve been putting it to the test daily. With a reputation for crafting innovative coffee tools, OXO now promises a minimalistic, travel-friendly coffee-making experience that brews concentrated coffee anywhere. As someone who thrives on caffeine, this device had to live up to my standards—and, spoiler alert, it mostly did! I walked in skeptical and walked out caffeinated (and mostly happy).

**Design and Build Quality**

Compact? Absolutely. Lightweight? A hundred percent. The coffee maker is barely larger than my go-to thermos, meaning it stashes easily into my work bag or even the narrowest kitchen cabinet shelf. Black in color, it rocks a sleek and modern look, but don’t be fooled—this isn’t just about appearances. The materials used feel durable yet lightweight, with a mix of Tritan Renew (a sustainable composite) and stainless steel parts. The pump locks securely in place for traveling, so your bag won’t get surprise coffee spills mid-commute. Its manual operation makes it a life-saver for travel—no plugs, no charging, and no internet instructions needed, just you and your quest for decent coffee.

**Ease of Use**

This thing is wildly simple. Add finely ground coffee to its fill line, pour hot or cold water over the grounds, let it steep, and pump into the carafe. The rainmaker showerhead evenly drenches the coffee bed, making extraction downright foolproof, even for my coworker who thinks “medium roast” is a setting. The built-in stainless steel filter saves money and hassle—no endless buying (or forgetting!) paper filters. Cleanup is equally painless since everything except the pump is dishwasher-safe.

[Ready to snag OXO 8722500? See Amazon’s price.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0dc8jyjqx/)

**Performance**

Performance impressed me from the very first use. Brewing hot concentrated coffee takes a quick two minutes, while smooth cold brew needs around five. The results? Flavor-packed and consistently reliable. I’ve adjusted the coffee grounds-to-water ratio to experiment with strength, and the customization feels rewarding—you’re not just brewing coffee, you’re tweaking it to fit your taste. The concentrated coffee can then be diluted with water, milk, or ice, so no two days have to feel identical.

Best part? No more waiting overnight for cold brew to soak or suffering the taste of burnt, microwaved coffee.

**Merits**

- Portable design ensures convenience for travel or busy mornings.  
- Brews hot and cold coffee in 2 and 5 minutes, respectively.  
- Stainless steel filter eliminates the need for paper filters.  
- Dishwasher-safe parts make for quick, hassle-free cleanup.  

**Areas of Improvement**

- The brewing capacity suits single-serving needs but isn’t ideal if you’re making coffee for a crowd.  
- Some users may find the manual pumping mechanism slightly tedious.  
- It would be nice if the coffee maker included a measuring scoop or set guidelines on grind size.  

**Flavor Extraction and Versatility**

Flavor is king, and this gadget understood the assignment. The result rivals the best French press coffee in terms of boldness and richness while keeping the smoothness intact. Oh, and versatility is booming here. From basic americanos to creative Vietnamese-style cold brews or affogato—I’ve tried them all. The power’s in your hands to experiment with customized coffee drinks that cater to your cravings. Fancy names aside, for someone like me who needs variety to stay awake midweek, it’s been a game changer.

**Competing Brands**

Comparing this brew wizard to peers like the Aeropress and French presses, a few distinctive benefits shine through. Unlike standard French presses, the OXO Rapid Brewer’s rainmaker showerhead ensures even water distribution across coffee grounds, improving flavor extraction. It’s also far lighter and doesn’t use disposable filters, beating out Aeropress in budget-friendliness over time. However, Aeropress is slightly faster on brewing time and easier to pump, while traditional French presses have larger capacities, making them better for group settings.  

In terms of sheer adaptability and performance, the OXO Brewer edges ahead for solo coffee drinkers who prioritize personalization and portability.

**True Value**

When breaking down features versus cost, it delivers exceptional quality for its price range. What clinches it for this gadget is not just portability but its genuine ability to produce barista-grade coffee flavors without the bells, whistles, or high costs associated with premium coffee makers. For those who value their caffeine and hate waiting in line for overpriced, mediocre coffee, it feels like a justified investment.

As I’ve said in the past, if you want the best, you gotta show them why it’s worth their time & investment.

the whole point of getting everyone a D 27 and pulsar so we can all start from the same place and the same coffee to discuss.

I’m working on standardization the grinder portion by creating my own grinder, but that’s going to take time.

1) you all have the same drippers
2) you all have the same coffees
3) you all have third wave water 

Now let’s start getting into the nerdiness of coffees at hand. It’s time to do the work & grow this sub, I gave you the tools, now gotta put in the mfing work.

Al la carte is going to be here soon, late July/early August. Available for the founders club FIRST, cost +10% then open to the public for actual retail value and then some, and most likely will be sold out before we open to public.

My whole thing is I don’t want to give deals or break my back for people who aren’t about this coffee life. 

lol if you’re a obsessive person like me, you want to taste and to know all coffees that exist. That’s the point of all of this is to sample AT scale.

I’m sitting in a coffee shopwhere the music playing doesn’t match my grief.Around me, people laugh, type, sipwhile the person I love is being unmade and remadeat this very moment.

I sip my tea slowly,begging my body to keep it down.But all I can think about is younaked, anesthetized,lying on a cold steel table under bright surgical lights.The cautery machine hums.Some chosen soundtrack plays over the violence.

She’s prepped her field.Marked your skin with purple inkthe same skin I once traced quietly with my fingers in the dark. 
They’ve bathed you in chlorhexidine.Draped you in sterile blue clothsInjected lidocaine with epinephrineto control bleedingbut there is no sympathomimetic agentfor this kind of loss.

Scalpel to skin.Precise. Controlled.Violent in its mercy.

They cut through your dermis,subcutaneous fat, adiposethe soft places I once held,where I rested my cheek and felt safefor the first time in my life.Where I listened to the steady beat of your heart.Tissue I memorized.Tissue that held my fear like it understood it.It held me.

They dissect through Cooper’s ligaments,separate glandular tissue from pectoralis fascia,removing breast tissue like an unwanted growth.But it wasn’t unwanted by me.It was sanctuary.It was home.

Carefully, they resect you, piece by piece.Excising what was never pathology.
The electrocautery hums, burning vessels closed.
The smell of you, burning.My safe place, cauterized.Smoke rises into sterile air from flesh I once kissed.Suction pulls away your blood,and I imagine crimson spiraling through tubing,pooling in canisterswhile I sit here among strangers.Your blood.My grief.

Your nipples are being removed nowsharply excised, resized with circular dermal punches.Blades carve what once responded to my touch.Nerves severed, detached from sensation.Repositioned as free grafts,stitched into a geography that will never feel me again.My lips, my fingers,my love.

Secured with bolsters,waiting for neovascularization.Waiting for blood to find its way backbut my touch never will.

They weigh the tissue.Document it.Discard it as medical waste.Into red bags, to be incinerated.Like it never held meaning.Like it never held the version of you I first fell into.

They are closing you in layers.Skin approximated.Absorbable sutures beneath the surface.Dermabond above.Nothing will penetrate this space.

Drains are placed like foreign veinsto collect fluid your body doesn’t know how to reabsorb.Your immune system will respond,as it always does to trauma.It can’t distinguish thisand neither can I.

Bruising will bloombeautiful violets of purple across your ribcage.Swelling will rise.Pain will settle deep,into muscle, into bone.Healing begins now.

Even as I sit here,tracing the anatomy of my grief in surgical terms.Imagining the precisionof this desecration.Waiting for the phone to ring,to tell me you’re okay.

This is gender-affirming surgery.This is life-saving surgery.I want this for you.I want you to feel whole.

But my body registers itas amputation.As loss.It cannot distinguish your liberationfrom my rupture.It confuses me.It shames me.Chokes me.

I am proud of you.I love you for surviving long enoughto choose this.To become who you’ve always been.To fight for your own skin.

But my own skin tightens.Trembles.Mistakes your freedom for my grief.And I hate that.That my nervous system can’t tell the difference.That it feels like holy groundis being ripped awaywhile I sip a drink I cannot taste.For the love of GodI cannot taste it.

I am not angry.I am not hurt.I am just inside out.Cut open, like you.Only I won’t have suturesto hold me together.I will bleed freely.

I will meet you where you are.Even as I mourn what is gone.Even as I shake with griefI cannot explain without shame.Even as I love you fiercely, completely,and ache for the part of you I lostthe part that helped me survivemy own history.
I will learn your new body.Trace new scars like constellations.I will learn how to touch you and see you again.

Assistant:
Absolutely, and I'm really sorry you went through that. Academic bullying, especially in something as intellectually intimate as philosophy, can be uniquely isolating and painful. Let's craft a compelling narrative that captures your experience, your voice, and the emotional truth of what happened.

Here’s a possible beginning. You can tell me what you’d like to change, add, or expand:

Title: ""The Seminar Room Wasn't Safe: A Story of Bullying in Philosophy Grad School""

I was 26 when I started my PhD in philosophy. Like many who go into the field, I loved thinking deeply. I loved the questions that didn’t have answers, the silence after a good argument, the strange joy of puzzling through Kant or trying to make sense of Kripke. What I didn’t expect was how philosophy grad school would become less about thought and more about survival.

It started with a study group during my first semester—just a few of us who had bonded over coffee and confusion during our seminar on metaethics. There was Emma (25), who had a sharp wit and a gift for making Hume sound like a contemporary, Mark (28), who had already published and never let anyone forget it, and Julian (29), who was charming in that way that made you unsure whether he was complimenting you or mocking you.

At first, I was excited. I felt like I had found people who took philosophy seriously. But gradually, the atmosphere shifted. It wasn’t just intellectual rigor—it was something else. Emma would cut me off mid-sentence in group meetings, smirking as she paraphrased my ideas into straw men and then “critiqued” them. Mark would sigh loudly whenever I spoke during seminar, muttering things like “intro-level mistake” under his breath. Julian once told me, after I gave a conference presentation, “You’re a good speaker, but your argument was kind of... undergraduate, no offense.”

It was subtle at first—microaggressions framed as philosophical critique, feedback that always just bordered on personal. But over time, it escalated. They would exclude me from study sessions but talk about them in front of me. One day, I walked into the department lounge and found my paper draft—one I had printed and left on the table—scrawled over in red pen with sarcastic comments. “Did you actually read Rawls?” one said. Another: “This is embarrassingly bad for a PhD student.”

When I brought it up to our department’s DGS, he nodded sympathetically and said something like, “Academia is competitive. Iron sharpens iron.” I wanted to scream. This wasn’t intellectual competition. This was targeted hostility masked as critique.

What made it worse was the way philosophy gave them cover. In most disciplines, cruelty is easier to spot. In philosophy, cruelty could be mistaken for analysis. Emma once said to me, after a colloquium where I asked a question about the speaker’s use of internalism, “You really should stop speaking in public until you’ve done more reading.” Everyone laughed.

I stopped going to that seminar. I began to dread coming to campus. I wondered if I was too sensitive, too weak, not smart enough. But I know now that I wasn’t the problem.

The thing about philosophy is that it's supposed to be about the love of wisdom. But in that program, wisdom was weaponized. It wasn’t about finding truth—it was about winning. And people like Emma, Mark, and Julian had decided that I wasn’t worth letting win, or even participate.

Eventually, I transferred out. I found another program—smaller, more supportive. It took me a long time to trust people intellectually again, to believe that I deserved to be in the room. But I’m still here. I still love philosophy. And now, I understand that real rigor doesn’t require cruelty. That clarity doesn’t require condescension. That no matter how abstract the ideas are, how dense the arguments, philosophy is still a human practice—and it matters how we treat each other.

I've been working on [PlayedIT](https://playedit-space.vercel.app) \- a web app that's like having a personal music manager for your practice routine and collection. Whether you're just starting out or you're a seasoned player, this might be useful for you.

# What it does:

* **Track your music collection** (vinyl, digital, whatever you've got)
* **Set practice goals** and actually stick to them with progress tracking
* **Create a wishlist** of songs you want to learn (with priority levels)
* **Built-in audio player** so everything's in one place
* **Achievement system** because who doesn't love unlocking badges? 🏆

# Why I built this:

So picture this - I'm sitting in my room at 2 AM, surrounded by guitar tabs printed from Ultimate Guitar, sticky notes with song names I'll ""definitely learn tomorrow,"" and a Spotify playlist called ""Songs to Learn"" with 200+ tracks. Sound familiar? 😅

The breaking point was when I spent 3 hours trying to remember that one riff I'd been working on for weeks, only to realize I'd been practicing the wrong part of the song the entire time. My practice routine was basically musical ADHD - jumping between songs, forgetting what I'd already learned, and constantly feeling like I wasn't making progress.

I tried using regular note-taking apps, spreadsheets, even physical notebooks (RIP the one I spilled coffee on). Nothing clicked. As a developer who loves music, I thought ""why isn't there a simple tool that just... gets it?"" Something that understands the musician's workflow - the way we collect songs, set goals, forget about them, rediscover them, and actually want to track our wins.

Few days later, PlayedIT was born. Started using it myself and suddenly I was actually finishing songs, remembering what I practiced, and feeling like I was making real progress. Shared it with my musician friends and they had the same ""finally!"" moment.

**Perfect for:**

* Beginners wanting to stay organized from day one
* Intermediate players tracking multiple goals
* Advanced musicians managing extensive collections
* Anyone who's ever thought ""wait, what song was I working on?""

It's completely free and works on any device. No ads, no premium tiers - just a tool made by a musician for musicians.

**Try it out:** [https://playedit-space.vercel.app](https://playedit-space.vercel.app)

Been using it for my own practice for months now and it's honestly changed how I approach music. No more mystery riffs or forgotten goals - just organized progress.

This is my first post, and I'm hoping to get some advice regarding the settings on my Delognhi Eletta Explore superautomatic machine. I've had it since March and when I first got it, the grind setting came at 7 and I was using local, fresh roasted beans (medium with chocolate notes). The first few drinks I made were fabulous (I pulled a few shots to make iced breves and then did the iced americano and the cold brew). I then had a bit of an off pull and decided to read up on the best grind settings and so I followed the guidance and did a finer grind (I tried a variety over several weeks even going back up to 7 to see if that would make things go back to normal lol). That kept leading to major inconsistnecies like burnt taste/smell, bitter, sometimes wouldn't pull etc. and eventually I read that the fresh beans don't do too the best. I then ordered some Lavazza (their espresso blend and the crema e aroma). Having less fresh beans seemed to help a little bit but it still is smelling a little burnt with both of those different beans, the espresso is worse and I think it's a more intense roast so maybe that's why. I typically do milk based drinks so it's not like they're undrinkable, but I'm getting some bitter flavors sometimes and it's just disappointing. I just adjusted my grind from 4.5 to 3.5 yesterday after scouring Reddit so I'm waiting to see if a after a few drinks that helps. I usually am a one coffee per day gal, occasionally 2 but rarely. Maybe my first pulls are just bad and I should toss them and do it again but that seems wasteful daily. I also switch up my drinks often but lately have been doing the espresso x2 with a 3 intensity and M size.

Bahrain Company Formation Guide,"Surprisingly, by 2025, Bahrain’s stance on attestation—especially in the context of foreign ownership and swift digital processes—has shifted more than you might expect. Regulatory tweaks, global investor influx, and a push for regional competitiveness drive these changes, placing new demands on anyone eyeing [Bahrain company formation](https://keylinkbh.com/company-formation-in-bahrain/).

# Bahrain Business Environment 2025: Landscape, Opportunity, and Change

Feature Image: Business environment in modern Bahrain corporate district *Alt text: Business environment in modern Bahrain corporate district.*, Bahrain’s economy expanded by 2.7% in the first quarter of 2025, outperforming much of the Gulf. The EDB’s investment drive (BHD 482 million inbound in Q1 2025) added more than 4,000 new jobs, with fintech, logistics, and tourism driving fresh business registrations.

The country’s strategic position and liberal approach—99% foreign ownership in most sectors, as per the [Economic Development Board](https://www.bahrain.com/)—give it the edge over UAE’s more restrictive mainland company setups or Saudi’s heavier Saudization requirements. New free zones (Bahrain Logistics Zone, Bahrain Investment Wharf) tempt investors with simplified customs and full repatriation of profits. And even in 2025, Bahrain’s famed business majlis etiquette—informal coffee-led networking, family connections, and Ramadan hour shifts—sometimes matters as much as paperwork precision!

For more context, major international sources like [Forbes Business](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2025/05/10/middle-east-business-hubs-bahrain-vs-uae/) are spotlighting Bahrain’s pivot to “digital-by-default” government services and the kingdom’s rapid climb in Middle East Ease of Doing Business rankings.

# Bahrain Company Formation: Foreign Document Attestation Requirements Explained

# What is Attestation? Why Does It Matter?

Attestation (sometimes referred to as legalization or apostille) certifies that a foreign document—like a certificate of incorporation, board resolution, or even a passport copy—is genuine, valid, and recognized by Bahrain’s authorities. For cross-border company formation, this step ties legal trustworthiness to your home country’s paperwork.

# The Law in 2025: What’s Changed?

Importantly, in February 2025, Bahrain’s MOICT (Ministry of Industry, Commerce & Tourism) adjusted its [Commercial Registration](https://keylinkbh.com/commercial-registration-in-bahrain/) guidance: **foreign documents for non-resident directors, shareholders, or parent entities must be attested up to the Bahrain embassy in the issuing country**—then submitted for final validation to Bahrain’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This includes:

* Certificates of incorporation (if setting up as a subsidiary)
* Power of attorney (if appointing a local representative)
* Board resolutions authorizing company formation
* Foreign ID/passport copies (sometimes for UBO checks)
* Financial statements (if required by EDB, Tamkeen, or regulatory authorities)

However, if your country is a Hague Apostille Convention member, a valid apostille stamp may suffice—except for regulated sectors (finance, insurance, labor supply), where full embassy attestation is still enforced.

I once encountered a frantic investor in Bahrain Bay who’d overlooked the need for embassy-level attestation of their parent company’s registration documents. Their UAE-based consultant had assumed apostille alone was enough. The resulting paperwork scramble delayed their launch by a month (and nearly cost them a major logistics contract with a Manama-based client).

# Types of Companies in Bahrain: Entity Structures and Attestation Demands

Feature Image: Business structure and collaboration for company setup in Bahrain *Alt text: Business structure and collaboration for company setup in Bahrain.*:\*\* Most common among small-to-mid foreign owners. If foreign shareholders, their ID and corporate docs must be attested.

* **BSC (Closed or Public Joint Stock Company):** Heavier document stack. Parent company resolutions and audited accounts (all attested if foreign) are standard.
* **Branch of Foreign Company:** The head office’s incorporation certificate, articles, and authorization letters—every page must go through attestation.
* **Single Person Company (SPC):** Easier if the sole shareholder is resident; harder if based overseas (attestation again required).
* **Free Zone Entity:** Rules are laxer for some zones, but [Bahrain Logistics Zone](https://keylinkbh.com/free-zones-in-bahrain/) typically enforces MOICT’s current attestation protocol.

See [Bahrain business type structures](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-business-type-structures/) for specifics on each entity and related documentation tips.

# Step-by-Step: Document Attestation and Company Registration in Bahrain

Feature Image: Business process and documentation workflow *Alt text: Business process and documentation workflow.*

* Foreign shareholder/UBO passports
* Board or shareholder resolutions
* Financial statements/audited accounts (for regulated activities)

# Step 2: Get Documents Notarized Locally

Your local notary authenticates the documents. Some countries require specific notary certifications compatible with the Hague Convention. Double-check for multi-lingual notary seals if your documents are not in English or Arabic.

# Step 3: Legalization by Foreign Affairs, Embassy, and Bahrain Authorities

* Submit notarized docs to your country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs for authentication.
* Next, visit the Bahrain embassy for consular attestation (fees typically BHD 25-75 per document).
* Arriving in Bahrain, present these at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs counter in the Diplomatic Area or Seef. There’s often a same-day processing option (BHD 20–40) that saves time, especially if you queue before 9 AM—locals often take coffee breaks after 10 AM, so early birds avoid the lunch rush.

*Document preparation shortcut*: If you’re dealing with a multi-lingual board, agree on one official document language—preferably English—before commissioning translations for attestation. Bahrain authorities are strict on consistency: mismatched language versions will be rejected and require re-attestation.

# Step 4: Submit to Sijilat for Company Registration

Sijilat is Bahrain’s unified e-government portal ([MOICT link](https://www.bahrain.com/)). Upload all attested documents here; originals may be requested at the final licensing appointment. Don’t overlook digital signature registration, which is mandatory for company representatives.

# Step 5: LMRA, Tamkeen, and Regulatory Follow-ups

If hiring foreign staff, the LMRA requires attested employment contracts and, for some sectors, proof of parent company support (again, attested at embassy level). Tamkeen often requests attested financial documentation for grant applications.

See the official [Bahrain company formation process](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-process/) for further details.

# Cost Considerations: Budgeting for Attestation and Registration in Bahrain

|Feature Image: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain company formation|*Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain company formation.*|
|:-|:-|
|Local Notary|25-50|
|Foreign Affairs Auth.|30-70|
|Bahrain Embassy|25-75|
|Min. of Foreign Affairs|20-40|

*Total per document:* **BHD 100-200** (multi-step process, courier fees extra if overseas).

* **Budget tip:** Bundle all documents for attestation in one go. Embassies sometimes discount for batches of 3+.
* **Money-saving hack:** Use reputable Bahrain-based document agents; they consolidate MOFA appointments and offer queue-jumping for a fee—my go-to firm in Seef District saved me half a day at least once a month.
* **Optimal application timing:** File before Ramadan or Bahraini public holidays—processing times double during these periods due to reduced working hours and heavy family obligations among government staff. And, submit docs early Monday to beat the mid-week rush.

# Regulatory Compliance: Common Mistakes, Insider Fixes, and Recent 2025 Updates

Feature Image: Legal compliance and documentation for Bahrain registration *Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation for Bahrain registration.*. Too many entrepreneurs relied on outdated advice and saw their applications frozen.

*How I beat this:*

* Directly confirming requirements with the Sijilat help desk before each new application.
* Subscribing to the MOICT, [Gulf News Bahrain section](https://www.gulfnews.com/uae/bahrain), and [KeyLinkBH’s regulatory updates](https://keylinkbh.com/company-formation-in-bahrain/) so I never miss policy shifts.

# Networking During Regulatory Hurdles

Often, relationships matter as much as correct paperwork. Bahrain’s business culture still thrives on introductions—fixing a minor documentation glitch over a quick majlis coffee at Bahrain Bay can open doors faster than a dozen emails. (Once, I sorted a last-minute company name amendment sitting cross-legged on a majlis cushion with an MOICT supervisor—who then expedited my client’s file as a favor.)

**Insider prevention strategies:**

* Always clarify document language requirements upfront.
* Pre-book MOFA appointment slots via [Sijilat](https://www.bahrain.com/) for faster turnarounds.
* Use [local sponsorship services](https://keylinkbh.com/local-sponsorship-in-bahrain/) for regulated sectors where extra attestation evidence may be needed.

**Post-formation tip:** Don’t neglect ongoing compliance. Bahrain’s [accounting and bookkeeping services](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/) often require attested board resolutions for annual filings and banking—set up reminders for all recurring documents.

# Ownership, Activities, and Alternatives: Navigating Bahrain’s Foreign-Friendly Rules

Feature Image: Professional business support and consultation in Bahrain *Alt text: Professional business support and consultation in Bahrain.* and [99% foreign ownership in Bahrain](https://keylinkbh.com/99percent-foreign-ownership-in-bahrain/), make it regionally exceptional. But with this flexibility comes the need for extra documentary proof if board members or UBOs are overseas entities.

* For most trading, consulting, tech, and e-commerce setups, attested documentation is the final major hurdle to 100% foreign ownership.
* Regulated sectors (banking, insurance, labor supply) need enhanced diligence—expect additional attested compliance docs and periodic renewals.

**Comparison: UAE vs. Bahrain** Unlike UAE mainland, where foreign owners often need a local Emirati partner, Bahrain’s model slashes barriers. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has eased the ownership route but still applies strict Saudization and documentation policies for foreign directors. Bahrain’s lighter touch (and English-friendly digital systems) wins for most global SMEs.

# Tangent: Why I Love Registering Companies at Seef District (and How It Saved My Last Client)

Walking into Seef District’s main Sijilat office, you feel plugged into Bahrain’s business heartbeat. The staff know the quirks of foreign document requirements better than almost anywhere else (case files handled: 250+ per day). Last year, during a Ramadan rush, my client’s courier-delivered attested documents from Canada were delayed by customs. I called in a favor with a local document agent, who met me at the office at 7:30 AM—with extra copies already Arabic-translated and certified on standby. We dodged a five-day wait just by being early and friendly with the right staff (pro tip: always bring pastries during Ramadan).

Surprisingly, this kind of flexibility and relationship-building isn’t just cultural—it’s practical, and it regularly keeps company launches on track.

# FAQ: Foreign Documents & Bahrain Company Formation

**1. Do I need to attest every foreign document for registering a company in Bahrain?**

>Usually yes for corporate/shareholder documents, but requirements depend on activity and entity (see [company formation process](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-process/)). Apostille may suffice for some sectors, but embassy/Bahrain MOFA attestation is now standard for most.

**2. How long does attestation take, and can I finish it after arriving in Bahrain?**

>Embassy + MOFA steps can take 1-2 weeks abroad, but Bahrain-side validation is usually 1-2 days (faster with an agent). Always start before traveling; delays locally during public holidays are common.

**3. Does Bahrain accept digital or scanned versions of attested documents?**

>Sijilat accepts digital uploads for initial reviews, but you must present physical attested copies during final licensing or bank account opening stages.

**4. What’s the cost difference if using a local agent for attestation?**

>Agent fees (typically BHD 50-100 per bundle) can save on courier costs, reduce queues, and spot errors before submission (see [company formation costs](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-cost/)).

**5. Is attestation required for ongoing compliance or just the setup phase?**

>Common for annual meetings, board resolutions, and certain regulatory filings—especially if foreign shareholders or directors change (detailed at [accounting and bookkeeping services](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/)).

**Bottom line:** Attestation of foreign documents isn’t just a bureaucratic tick-box in Bahrain’s company registration—it’s a crucial step that, if fumbled, can stall your launch, eat up budgets, and damage credibility. Master the process, use insider tips, and always build relationships with those who can smooth your path at the Sijilat counter or the local embassy desk. For those who do, Bahrain’s dynamic, foreign-friendly business landscape is full of opportunity.

**SCRIPT:**

*(SFX: Soft train carriage ambience)*

I was wondering when you’d wake up.

Mmnn yeah. You fell asleep a while ago. It might be the gentle sound and motion of this train carriage that’s making you sleepy.

(Sighing) Then again, you deserve enough sleep for an entire lifetime after everything that’s happened. *(SFX: Playing with his hair)* I really put you through a lot, don’t I?

And yet you stay with me. Well, you can’t exactly run from me (a little chuckle)....but you have stopped trying. You have stopped trying to avoid me. You don’t flinch or shrink away from my touch anymore.

I want you to know something, my dear snowflake.

(Whispering) I’m proud of you. I am so, so proud of you.

(Gently kissing his cheek)

I’m really pleased you agreed to accompany me on this trip. Although I wish you would also come with me to the actual events. (Sighing faintly) You sure I can’t do something to....*persuade* you?

There’s nothing to be shy about, my sweet. You’re my husband now. You’re the most wonderful thing I have ever seen, and I want to show you off.

(Firm but gentle) I could never be embarrassed by you. Don’t be stupid. (Pecking him) I love you, and everything you do just makes me appreciate how much I love you.

(Sighing again) Yes, yes. I know. You have been feeling a little unwell lately, and the medicines make you tired. They help you relax a little *too* well. But it’s necessary. (Faintly) You getting rest, so you can run all over the place at 3 AM again like an excited little kitten....it’s necessary.

(Laughing softly) Okay, maybe you don’t run around at 3 AM. But there have been a few nights when I woke up, just to see you standing on the balcony, all moody and brooding. Unable to sleep.

The nightmares have stopped now, haven’t they?

Good. Don’t you worry. They’ll never return. There’s only love and joy. Only us. I will always protect you and look after you, my dearest. So....when you can’t sleep, just wake me up, alright? (Softly) I will help you fall asleep again.

Hey. You could never disturb me. When I dream, we are together in my dreams. So if you were to wake me up, we would just be together in the waking world. Instead of a field of sunflowers, I might just have to do with my old bedroom. No big difference.

(Smiling) Okay, yeah, those were some very pretty sunflowers in my dream. I kind of miss them. But I’m sure sunflowers will bloom wherever you are, so....

(Giggling) What? You don’t know the difference between corny and romantic. And it’s true! Sunflowers aren’t native to Eluria. I saw them for the first time when you showed me that dusty old picture from your country. And then I just had to get some seeds imported, and plant them in our gardens.

So, yeah. There were no sunflowers without you. And now there’s a whole host of them because of you.

(Quietly) I didn’t know what happiness was before I met you. Sylvia taught me to be happy, but she was gone so soon. And then my life was just one battle after another. Endless maps and plans and logistics and supply lines and marching into unknown lands and....and the bodies, frozen under ice. Blood mingled with snow. Just red and white.

But it’s gone now. It takes war to build peace, and now we have our peace. Our paradise. Our Eden. And I’m going to smile everyday that I spend with you. I....I am going to be happy, my darling. I know I will.

(Quieter) I know I will....as long as you stay with me.

Yeah. (Pecking him) I know you aren’t going anywhere. Trust me, darling, I know. But sometimes, when the night is darkest and I can’t sleep, all I have for company are old memories. And then I can’t help but feel....uneasy.

It sounds silly. Many fears are simply born from exhaustion and loneliness. They aren’t real. Your hand in mine is real. Your head on my shoulder, your breathing and your heartbeat- *they* are real. But there’s this small part of me that’s....afraid.

(Very faintly) She’s afraid of losing you. Stella can’t bear the thought of losing you.

Please, pet. It’s not your fault. You’ve done nothing to make me feel like this. It’s silly, like I said. And with time, these baseless, incorporeal fears will disappear. Like mist before the morning sun. The only reason we’re even talking about this, is because I trust you.

I trust you with my life, my sleepy little pet. You’re the one constant in my life. I can never put into words how you’ve saved me. Redeemed me, and completed me. All I can do....is hold you close, and play with your hair, and prove to you every single day how much you mean to me.

(Smiling playfully) You’re my prince. And I will treat you like a prince. (Kissing his cheek)

*(A longer pause. Hair brushing and train carriage sounds continue.)*

The Elurian countryside has always fascinated me. Lush forests full of pines and mysteries, wide open fields of crop where children run around laughing and playing, and great cities and towns in between, teeming with steep buildings and churches and speckled dots against the night sky.

(Musing) The road to Argellan really is pretty. And it’s even better seeing it from inside this private cabin, just reclining back into the luxuriant leather and relaxing. (Sighing with contentment)

If you would like some coffee or pastries, just let me know. Or you can press that little silver bell as well. They maintain a dedicated staff aboard this train just for refreshments. They have over a couple dozen offerings of baked goods apparently. But I never really had much of a sweet tooth.

There’s so much to see in Argellan. The blue ocean, lovely little cafés along the shore, and ancient, grandiose museums full of our history and legacy. I have visited a couple of times before, but only explored a small portion of the port city. (Faintly) Just never seemed fun doing it on my own.

I’ll make sure to drag you all over the place in between my meetings. And I won’t listen to a single complaint of your legs getting sore from walking, or your arms getting sore from carrying shopping bags. Nope. Not a word. So you better watch out! (Happy giggling)

You know, this train was commissioned to be built exclusively for high-ranking officers of the northern military command- and their families- a few years ago. They went a little overboard with the decor, but all in all, it’s pretty lovely. The aesthetic of blue and silver runs throughout every compartment- the same colours of our emblem and insignia. I think that might be why they nicknamed this train, “The Silver Dream”.

Pet?

(Sighing) I see they named it well. They knew. You have already fallen asleep on my shoulder. Again. You’ve really grown a little too comfortable around me, haven’t you?

(Smiling) Whatever am I going to do with you?

Probably just keep playing with your hair, and pull you a little closer. Yeah. (Smooching him briefly)

*(Hair brushing and train ambience continue for a little while, before fading out.)*

...

....

.....

And what of it, Emilia? Just put it on my itinerary. (Sighing, depressed) This is going to be a long week....

Yes well, I suppose it can’t be helped. Although times of peace seem inexplicably more stressful than times of war. So much paperwork and complacency.

Hm? No, my snowflake- my husband- won’t be joining me at the gathering tonight, unfortunately. He’s a little tired of all the fanfare and parties and victory parades lately. (Muttering) As if I’m not.

Nothing. He’s just tired, Emilia. He needs to rest. I think the fresh air in Argellan will do him good. The evening sea breeze is certainly quite refreshing.

Ah yes, that’s him by the fountain. He’s usually a bit of an indoor pet- I mean, person. I’m pleasantly surprised he decided to go for a walk in the estate gardens.

The gardens are lovely. How long have you been posted here, sergeant?

Ah, so not long at all then. Are you from the capital as well?

(A longer pause)

Ah. How fascinating.

Huh? That’s- oh yeah, you’re right. That is a cat down there. And my husband’s stroking its fur. Seems like he already became friends with it. *Cute*.

I see. That cat looks quite well groomed. A little fat, even. Is it owned by one of the lords or ladies of the city?

(Curiosity piqued) No? Really?

(Pausing)

Huh. So it always escapes whenever somebody tries to tame it or bring it inside the mansion?

I see. It just comes and goes as it pleases, then. (Sighing)

(Unamused) Why am I not surprised? No wonder my darling and the cat get along so well.

Yeah. I don’t know why he does that. Steadfastly refuses to go with his loving wife to a soul-sucking socializer, I mean. But I suppose I shouldn’t force him.

(Smiling) He did come with me all this way, because he knew I didn’t want to be alone. I’d miss him terribly.

(Softly) Yes. I love him. He’s very precious to me.

(Just a little self-conscious) Um, er, so about this evening’s agenda....I guess the meetings won’t attend themselves. Let’s get going, shall we?

*(SFX: Heels, walking away)*

...

....

.....

*(SFX: Rainfall)*

(A long pause)

*(SFX: Soft rustling of bedsheets)*

Ssshh. It’s just me, my prince. Sorry. I didn’t mean to wake you.

Yeah. Yeah, the party went....(rolling her eyes) just fine. I guess. How was your night?

Nevermind. You don’t have to answer that. I can see how sleepy you are. Awww, poor baby. (Chastely kissing his forehead) I’m so sorry for disturbing your sleep. How about some cuddles to make up for that, hm?

(Laughing very softly) Yeah. Cuddles are the best. Come here, pet. (Whispering) Come to Mistress.

*(SFX: Brief rustling of bedsheets again)*

(Speaking very gently, softly, soothingly. Almost hypnotic.)

You just nestle in my arms, and fall asleep again, alright? Just listen to my voice, and go back to dreaming of me.

That’s a good boy.

I know the medicines make you a little lethargic, but I’m so glad to see they’ve been helping you sleep better. I don’t even need to cast my spell on you anymore. No need to render you all frozen and immobile. You barely move around in your sleep now.

(Breathing slowly, audibly) Just stillness, and silence. And the rise and fall of your chest and mine. The beating of our hearts. Lub....dub. Lub....dub. Lub....dub.

And just us. (Pecking the nape of his neck)

Sometimes I wish I could carry you around with me wherever I went. That’d be nice. I never quite understood what they meant by....by  “Absence makes the heart grow fonder”, and all that.

Your absence just makes my heart grow colder. I....I had a dream a few nights ago, you know?

Yeah. I’m sorry for not telling you. I would have, but truth is, I barely remembered it after waking. Just....bits and pieces. Like- going to a place you have never been to, but parts of it feel familiar. The light, the sound, the air. The sensations.

I remember it more vividly now. I was walking down a long, deserted hallway. Searching for you. But you weren’t there. I looked everywhere, but I couldn’t find you. And then....finally....I found the ring I’d given you. Tucked away neatly in a corner for me to find. The same ring you’re wearing now. And then I realized that, in this dream, you had left me. But that’s not all.

It was like you’d disappeared off the face of the earth. I had my armies look for you all over the continent- all over the world- but there was nothing. No traces of you, no reminders of you. It was like....this time, you had run away to a place where I couldn’t follow you. And that made me so...

So....

(Sighing) It was just a dream. I know you didn’t break my heart. You....you couldn’t do that to me. (Smiling bravely) You have come to love me, in your own way. Despite everything I did. Despite all the ways I hurt you. It’s because....you are an angel living in hell. I’ve clipped your wings, and confined you in my world, because I love you too much to let you go. But no matter how beautiful I make this world, it’ll still be hell. Simply because I am in it. My hands will never be washed clean of all the lives I’ve taken. All the suffering I have inflicted. And I do not regret it, my dear.

I am Estelle Eveningstar. Tyrant of the North. The Ice Queen. It’s just what I do. All I regret....is hurting you. The only one I love in this world, and the only one I will ever love.

I can’t let go of your leash, pet, but I promise it won’t be made of cold metal anymore. Just silk. And I....I will be kind to you. I promise. I won’t break this promise. I swear it.

So....please don’t run away from me, alright?

I don’t deserve you. I don’t think I do. But the fates decided to send you to me. I used to think nobody is special. This world, the universe- it’s all pitch and toss, all empty and arbitrary.

But I was wrong. You are special. To me. My heart is yours to keep, and my heart- (smiling faintly) it just won’t return to me, you know? It’s really annoying.

(A longer pause)

I love you.

Sweet dreams, Snowflake.

(Breathing softly, slowly. No dialogue.)

*(The rain and her breathing grow fainter, and begin to fade, ever so slowly)*

*...*

....

.....

*(SFX: It’s still raining)*

(Sleepily) Mmnh...Snowflake?

Is....is that you?

*(SFX: Rustling bedsheets)*

What are you doing on the balcony, silly? It’s raining. You’ll get sick.

 Snowflake....?

(Vaguely surprised) Wait. It’s....it’s you, old lady.

You realize you look like a ghost, right? Totally white and veiled. And you are floating by the balcony at- what is it, 3 AM? (Scoffing)

If my snowflake could see you, he’d freak out. Probably have a heart attack. Then what am I going to do? Huh?

Wait a minute. I can- I can see streaks of ice on the railings. It’s not cold enough outside for frost to form. Is that your doing?

What are you trying to tell me? Please, just be direct. No ominous, cryptic signs. Speak up, old lady.

(A longer pause)

(Sighing) I suppose it’s like trying to herd cats. Absolutely futile.

(Softly) I see Snowflake isn’t here. Did he leave the room to go somewhere?

Is that why you are here?

Old lady? Hello?

This is weird. I can’t....sense him. This only happens when he is-

(Another long pause)

(Softly) Hey. The house is unnaturally quiet. All I hear is the rain.

*(SFX: Sliding out of bed)*

*(SFX: Soft footsteps, continuing)*

I’m going to go outside to take a look. Snowflake probably couldn’t sleep, and decided to go off exploring the old manor. (Muttering) I told him to wake me up when he couldn’t sleep. But no. He always has to embark on these- these night-time misadventures.

Feel free to tag along if you want, old lady. I am going to find my snowflake.

*(Footsteps echoing. Rainfall.)*

(To herself) The attendants must be asleep in their rooms at this hour. The night is cold. And there’s so little light in the hallway.

It’s strangely eerie. I’ll have to remind Emilia to at least light a few of the chandeliers at night. I can see in the dark, but *somebody* is bound to stub their toe.

(A little louder) Hey, Snowflake! If you can hear me, feel free to answer or pop out at any moment. I would’ve thought you were afraid of the dark, but I guess you’d do anything to stay out of my arms, huh?

(Gentler) Come back to bed, darling. It has got to be better than walking around in this silent, unsettling mansion in the dead of night. This better not be some kind of a prank! If you’re trying to scare me, I’ll have you paralyzed under my spell for *at least* a year. Then you’d have no choice but to be my cuddly little teddy bear.

(Faint laughter) Honestly, that does sound nice. I’m tempted. And you’re responsible for giving me such ideas! This is on you.

(Whispering) I wish you’d just talk to me, my pet....

I don’t like waking up without you by my side. Despite that, I want you to have some degree of freedom. I don’t want you to feel trapped. But I....I can help you.

I wish you’d let me, my dearest.

(Louder) Snowflake? Sweetheart? Can you hear me?

*(A longer pause. Shadows line the walls. Footsteps and rainfall fill the silence.)*

This is a very long hallway. Full of shadows and silence. Disturbed only by the moonlight filtering in through the glass windows. I was here during the day, but now, it seems so different.

And yet....

It’s not unfamiliar. I....I have been here before. This feeling, it....

What’s going on? Where is everybody?

*(Footsteps stop)*

Wait. Is that- Emilia! Is that you?!

Oh my gosh, you’re on the floor! What happened? Are you alright?

(Taken aback) *What?* What did you just say?

Intruders....? *Here?*

*(A long, unnerving silence)*

(Strangely calm) I see. They rendered you unconscious, but didn’t deliver any fatal injuries. They were pressed for time. And also....

No. Nothing. How many of them were there?

(Muttering quietly) At least eight or nine figures in the dark....possibly more.....I see.

Can you walk, Emilia?

Alright. Good. Please wake up everyone. Get a status of who’s missing. Staff, security, everybody. Call for the medics just in case our visitors....weren’t as kind to the others.

Me? I’m going to sort this out, of course. They went down that corridor, yes?

Okay. They must be heading outside. They came here for something, probably obtained it, and by your account, can’t be far from the main foyer by now.

Please. I’ll be fine. Get yourself to safety. Immediately.

Atta girl. See you later.

*(SFX: Running footsteps, soft but persistent)*

(Slightly strained breathing) Snowflake....just hang on a little longer.....I will find you.

I won’t let anything happen to you. I won’t.

I’m almost there. My ring will protect you. They can’t harm you. But if they have displaced even a single strand of hair on your forehead, I’m going to make them beg for death.

I won’t let anything happen to you. I’m so sorry for getting careless. I let my feelings cloud my judgement. From now on, I’m not letting you leave my side. Ever.

(Panting softly, still running)

I will give you all the cuddles you want. Anything. Just....just listen to me....just hang on a little longer, darling. I-

*(Footsteps screech to a halt)*

(Heavy breathing)

....Snowflake?

(A long pause)

(Barely a whisper) I don’t- I don’t understand. Why are you....with them?

(Another pause)

No. You don’t have to....explain. I....(almost to herself) I figured it out.

I just didn’t want to believe it. That’s all. But it would seem- (a single tear falling from one eye)- love has blinded me.

Even now, I can’t see properly. My vision is blurred. Am I....am I crying?

My eyes feel wet. And the ground beneath my feet- it doesn’t feel solid. This- all of this feels like a dream, from which I’ll wake up any minute now.

But I won’t wake up from this, will I....?

 It’s still hours until daybreak. The shadows are not going anywhere. And your companions have their weapons drawn. I can hear the rustling of their cloaks. See the glint of their silver. Feel the....(voice hardening) the tension. The dread hanging. All it will take, (whispering) is for one person to fire the first shot.

(Strangely calm) It’s okay, my darling. I found Emilia a while ago. No body parts were missing. There was no blood. Rebels aren’t known for kindness, especially now, with their little rebellion all but crushed. So....(taking a deep breath) why don’t I try to guess what happened?

They came here for you. You convinced them to not hurt anyone. And they listened, because they have need of your alchemy. Your intel. Your skill. But that’s not all.

You are standing between them and me. Your heartbeat, your posture, your face, your silence- they speak so much louder than words.

They didn’t force you. You....you chose to go with them. Because of your guilt.

(Soft, fragile) Because you don’t want to live in my world, with me.

(Whispering) It’s not your choice to make.

*(SFX: Blast of ice magic. Roaring gales. Gunfire, lost to the winds.)*

You forget, my sweet. I am General Estelle Eveningstar, commander of the northern armies. All it takes is one flicker of hailstorm, and they get swept away.

Fools. Their fear kept them from attacking while they had the chance. Not that it’d have made a difference. It will take a lot more than swords and bullets to cause me any real harm.

*(SFX: Freezing/Cracking ice)*

That’s enough, my darling. Stay still. You’re covered in ice, and unable to lift a finger. I’ll let you out in a few minutes.

That is quite enough. Do not-

*(SFX: Piercing flesh)*

Hm? Yeah, I just drove a shard through his head. He interrupted our conversation. Terribly rude. But look, he’s not moving anymore. He’s dead.

(Sighing) You keep saying “please”. You keep saying “stop”. Why?

You have lost the privilege to make requests of me, pet. I can read your thoughts when you’re like this. You left my bedroom to meet with them, and then you slipped away into the night, hoping to never see me again. This....was premeditated.

Hush. Stop speaking. I’m sorry for sealing your lips shut, but I just don’t want to hear your voice right now.

(Strangely gentle) Don’t worry. Most of my anger isn’t directed at you. (With a bittersweet smile) I still think you’re a good boy. Just very, very stupid. And misguided. Foolhardy. Part of it is my fault, for being too lenient and merciful with you.

(Whispering) It’s not a mistake I will ever make again.

Ssshhh. No mumbling. No struggling. Just stay right there. I....will deal with you later.

(Kissing his forehead)

*(SFX: Footsteps, echoing indifferently)*

*(SFX: Piercing flesh. A crash against the wall. Cracking of ice. Piercing flesh again.)*

You cretins. Wretched scum of the earth. *(SFX: Furious, frigid winds)* You come into *my* home....try to take *my....pet....*from me*.* I- (chuckling happily)- I applaud your audacity. Your masochism. *(A blunt impact)* Your sheer....(breathing raggedly) disregard....for your own lives. *(Shattering of glass)*

I can taste it. The fear. The air is thick and heavy with your fear. You were hoping to avoid a confrontation with me at all costs. Your own fear paralyzed you. Kept you from shooting at me, stabbing at me, hell- just running up to me swinging your fists.

You’re not warriors. You’re not soldiers. You’re not strong. You....are pests that have outlived your time on this earth.

*(SFX: A sickening crunch. Another blast of ice.)*

Wait....I know you. You’re....you’re that girl.

Ameera.

(Laughing- unrestrained, ever so unhinged) Oh....this is just precious! Oh....oh my gosh! You thought you could rescue him? Did you want to *save* him from me?

Insolent bitch. He doesn’t need saving. I love him. He is mine to care for. Mine to hold. Mine to cherish. You and all your dead little friends came here, trying to take him from me, and you wanted to leave without incident?

How dare you? I should never have spared your life, much less let you walk away freely. But my snowflake begged me to. My love for him blinded me.

(Softening ever so slightly) But my love for him, is also what drives me. Gives me strength. Makes me feel alive. I....I now have someone to live for. Someone who makes me *want* to live.

You could never understand. You could never know what *I.....feel....*inside. I love him. You can’t take him from me. I won’t let anyone or anything take him from me.

*(SFX: Footsteps approaching with finality)*

He means everything to me. He is my world. You can die with the comfort of knowing that he is loved, and will always be loved. But not by you.

Snowflake belongs to me. You will pay with your life for trying to take him from me. All your friends are dead. Why don’t you join them?

*(Footsteps stop)*

(Increasingly fanatic) I hope you rot in hell. My darling will finally be free of you, of the rebellion, of these poisonous thoughts. He will be free, free to love me back, to see all the love I have for him. My darling will finally be with me. My love, my prince, my- my source of joy and light. My snowflake. You’ll be mine. You will! (Gritting her teeth) Good riddance, wretch. *(SFX: Stabbed through the chest)*

(A longer pause)

Huh?

Snowflake?

You’re standing in front of me.

There’s....a knife of ice poking through your chest. And I....I am holding the knife.

Why is this happening?

(Stunned, hazy silence. Lingering.)

What....? You’re....”finally free” now?

*(SFX: Soft thud against the floor)*

No....no.....no. No. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

NO! Snowflake! Please, open your eyes! Hey! Please, look at me! Stay awake. Don’t fall asleep! Please, just look at me.

Snowflake! Don’t close your eyes. Don’t. Please. I....I....I am begging you. Just look at my face! Please. Please.

(Sobbing, struggling to speak) I’m sorry! I am so, so sorry.....I didn’t mean to....I just- I just wanted to be with you....(whispering fiercely, voice breaking) I just wanted you. I am sorry.

Why did you have to jump in front of me? Why? Snowflake, please- I will never hurt you again. I will- I’ll do anything you ask of me. Anything. So please- please, darling, just open your eyes. (Crying) Look at me. Look....at- look at me.

Medic! I need a medic! Emilia, over here! Quickly. Come over here! Now!

Snowflake. Don’t leave me. I....I finally started smiling again, after so long. I learnt what it’s like to be complete.  Don’t leave me behind. I can’t follow you in the world of dreams. Stay with me.

I....I will let you go. I swear on my life- on everything that I am. I will set you free, if that is what you want. As long as you are alive. As long as- you- you live in this world. That is enough for me.

Snowflake. Open your eyes. I can’t feel your pulse. Can’t- (Crying helplessly) can’t hear your heartbeat. This is not real. This can’t be real.

This isn’t real. I’m still inside the nightmare. Wake up, Stella. Wake up. Wake up! Wake the fuck up! Wake up!

(Barely audible) Wake up, Snowflake. Please.

Snowflake....?

1lwluum,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lwluum,First Time Trying Cast Iron!,"Have been lurking in this sub for a bit and thought I'd post my recent cast iron haul! These are my first ever cast iron pieces. I appreciate any insight in caring for these so they can last as long as possible. One of my friends in California came across this brand called ""Taku Ironware."" They seem to be popular overseas but not very well known in the states. I did research on the brand and apparently they use a manufacturing process called ""investment casting"" instead of the traditional sandcasting which gives them a butter-smooth surface. 
He swears they are some of the nicest pieces of cast iron he has bought in a while (and he has a pretty extensive cast iron collection himself). I've always used teflon and coated ceramic-type pans which supposedly aren't the best health-wise. I decided to take his word for it and got myself a few pieces since my tea kettle recently broke and my pans have seen better days. 

Got myself one of their tea kettles which comes with a super cute trivet to display the kettle and also a lid fork. I'm a huge tea lover and use this to boil water for tea and the occasional coffee. The brand Taku claims that their kettles release iron when you boil water in them which is supposed to make the water healthier for you and also taste better. I am not sure about the iron part since I am not deficient or anything but my teas have been tasting better than before. There were so many kettles to choose from, all very unique but decided to go with this one that has a tree design and a bamboo handle. 

Next I got myself a new pan that instantly got my attention because of the wooden walnut handle. I was surprised how light it was yet at the same time felt so solid and well-made. Also the texture of all the pieces is so smooth! 

Then finally I got myself a round pan that comes with these cast iron detachable handles that you can use to grab the pan so you don't burn yourself which I thought was very clever. This one I probably won't be using too often as it'll probably be for making pizzas or baking. All in all, im in love with these pieces although they were a bit on the pricier side lol.

I smoked for a few years before going on a vape and then stopping entirely. But I got into a very rare verbal argument with a famioy member and as a stress reaction I brough a packet of L&B Blue and a few cans of coke and jack daniels. Not touched alcohol since November either. After I finished the packet I went out and brought abother on, but no more alcohol, and when I started to run low I brought another packet and then another. I was a non-smoker walking around with one and a half packets and two lighters in my pocket.

I smoked in my garden but also in a park while out on a walk. I chain smoked a few. I felt disgusted and was aware I must have stunk. I'm into fitness and I was sitting on a low wall smoking one and a large group of runners ran past - dozens of them, mostly in their twenties and thirties. Healthy, fit, attractive people.

I wanted to go for food and a coffee but I was ashamed how I smelled so instead got a protein shake and drank it in the park.

I scrubbed hard in the shower afterwards. I already had tar stains on my fingers. I washed my clothes. I threw away a jumper I liked because I couldnt get the smell out. Ive brushed my teeth like a man possessed.

The problem is you cant just make foundations and ramps curve left and right or up and down in the proper axis with the wave of your mouse. I've watched dozens of videos about how to manipulate things to make them appear curved with minor clipping etc. Does anyone else find this incredibly frustrating and unintuitive? Does Coffee Stain have any plans to make this concept easier to navigate?

I’m a 25 year old male and have been dealing with panic disorder and GAD since I was 21. Just recently got diagnosed with OCD and it definitely feels like it. I had an episode that was about 10 days of really extreme intrusive thoughts, severe panic attacks, DPDR, ER Visits etc. Obsessive thoughts that I just could not control. I decided to go the medicating route as I’ve tried therapy and holistic approaches of treatment for years now. I’ve been on Zoloft 25mg to start for 8 days now. The first few days were horrible, crying, severe anxiety, rumination, no appetite, nausea, body aches, shakiness etc. as time has went on I’ve felt better as far as the physical side effects and the appetite has improved a little. However, my mind will not stfu, I spend so much time googling stuff and watching videos about zoloft which I know I shouldn’t do but I do. The last few days have been absolutely horrible. The anxiety I’ve been feeling is so bad I feel like I cannot relax. Not matter what I do or what anyone says I cannot calm down. I have hydroxyzine to take as needed and it touches the anxiety just enough for me to go to bed at night but brother this is brutal!!! It feels like I’ve drank 19 cups of coffee on an empty stomach and I don’t even drink coffee!! I’m so concerned about emotional blunting and so concerned whether this is going to work out for me but I’m desperate at this point. I’ve tried so many things and I just want my freedom. I want to reclaim the things that anxiety has taken from me. I want to get back on the river fishing, get back out in the mountains, travel, look forward to the days ahead, joke around with my buddies, spend quality time with family and my lady, but feel happy and present while doing it without these plaguing thoughts or physical symptoms that anxiety has given me.

So… this is an update to [my last post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/7XRfU7PozS) , the one about my grandpa’s TV and Channel 103. I wasn’t planning on writing anything else, but something happened last night, and I can’t sit with it anymore.

It’s followed me.

I know how that sounds. I know how crazy I sound. Believe me, I’ve tried every rational explanation. Sleep deprivation. Stress. Grief. Hallucination. I even went to a walk-in clinic yesterday because I thought I was having some kind of delayed breakdown.

But none of that explains what I saw last night.

I’ve been back at my apartment for five days. I haven’t turned on my TV at all. I even unplugged it. Honestly, I’ve been sleeping like shit, but otherwise just trying to act normal. The whole “if I ignore it, maybe it’ll go away” approach.

Last night around 3 AM — of course, 3 AM — I woke up to this faint humming noise. Like an old fridge or an electric razor just barely audible through the wall. At first I thought it was my upstairs neighbor (he’s always doing weird stuff at night), but when I sat up, I realized it was coming from inside my living room.

I didn’t even want to check. I just laid there for like 20 minutes trying to convince myself I was imagining it. But it kept getting louder. Like static rising under the floorboards.

Eventually, I grabbed a flashlight and walked out.

My TV was on.

Still unplugged.

Same static screen. Same channel number: 103 in the top right corner, glowing faint green.

But this time, the static didn’t last long. It flickered once — that weird blink again — and then it showed my apartment. Live. From the ceiling corner of the room.

Except this time, I wasn’t in the shot. The camera angle was looking down at my couch and the dark hallway behind it.

I should’ve left. I wanted to leave. But something about seeing my own apartment on screen rooted me in place.

Then something moved in the hallway.

On the screen, I mean.

Something tall, thin, dragging itself out from the dark like it was peeling off the wall.

Same figure as before. No eyes. Just that stretched-out mouth, too wide, like it was trying to smile and scream at the same time. It stopped behind the couch and just stood there. Watching.

And then — I swear to God — the image on the TV slowly panned, like the camera was turning.

Until it was pointing directly at where I was standing.

And I saw myself on screen.

But it wasn’t… quite me.

It looked like me, yeah, but the mouth was just slightly open. No expression. Blank stare. And something about the eyes — they weren’t mine. It was like someone wearing my skin but not knowing how to move it right.

It raised its hand.

And I felt something touch my back.

I screamed. Not proud of it. Just full-on panicked and fell backward into my coffee table. The second I hit the ground, the TV cut off.

Just dead black. Like it had never been on at all.

It hasn’t turned on since.

I threw a blanket over it and shoved it in the hall closet. I didn’t even care if the door didn’t close all the way. I just couldn’t look at it anymore.

I’ve been sitting in my kitchen since 4 AM with all the lights on. Haven’t slept.

I keep thinking about the last thing that voice said on the TV back at my grandpa’s:

“Now we are watching you.”

Not “I.” We.

There’s more than one of them. Whatever “they” are.

And they don’t need the TV to see me anymore.",6,1752175139.0,nosleep,1,0.88,False

1lwlirh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lwlirh/does_tastyle_k302_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Does Tastyle K302 Single Serve Coffee Maker Deliver as Promised? Detailed Review,"**Compact and Portable Design – A Traveler’s Delight**  
The Tastyle K302 Single Serve Coffee Maker immediately stands out for its sleek, black-and-gold design. As someone who’s constantly on the go, I appreciated how its compact size (just 8.1"" x 4.6"" x 9.8"") fits effortlessly into tight spots like a packed suitcase or even my desk corner at work. Its portability is enhanced by the to-go handle, making it super easy to carry around. Whether I was using it in my cramped kitchen, in an RV during a weekend road trip, or at a hotel while traveling, this coffee maker didn’t demand much space. However, while packing for camping, I did notice I had to ensure the machine was securely cushioned since its lightweight build could make it prone to tipping.

**User-Friendly Brewing System – Coffee in Minutes**  
Brewing a cup of coffee with this machine couldn’t be simpler. This single-button-operated coffee maker transformed my groggy mornings into a breeze. All I had to do was pour water into the 12 oz visible water reservoir, toss in a pod or ground coffee, and press the brew button. In under three minutes, my coffee was ready. Speaking of the water tank, the visible markings from 6 to 12 ounces were a handy guide for tailoring coffee strength to my mood each morning. However, the absence of a drip tray threw me off initially. I quickly learned to keep a cloth underneath to catch any drips after brewing—an easy fix, but worth mentioning for others considering this machine.

[Curious about Tastyle K302? Click to see on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dhclp5jk/)  

**Reusable Filter and K-Pod Holder – Flexibility at Its Best**  
I loved the versatility this coffee maker brought to the brewing game. Whether using K-Pods or 20g of ground coffee, it didn’t disappoint. The reusable filter did a fantastic job of preventing grounds from sneaking into my drink, leaving me with a smooth-tasting cup every time. Plus, knowing the pod holder and filter are dishwasher-safe added massive convenience on those busy days. My coworker even borrowed it one Friday, claiming it was perfect for preventing morning chaos in the office. They loved the time saved during their rush! However, for those who prioritize zero mess, keep a paper towel handy since the filter lid can sometimes be a tiny challenge to align perfectly the first time.

**Energy Efficiency and Self-Cleaning Function**  
Energy-saving features in gadgets are always a huge plus for me, and this coffee maker didn’t disappoint. At just 800 watts, its energy-efficient design is friendly on your electricity bill, and the automatic shut-off after brewing minimized any accidental energy wastage. I also found the self-cleaning function extremely convenient, as it kept the machine in prime condition without much effort from my end. The descaling reminder is a nice touch, especially for people like me who tend to forget regular maintenance. While this feature worked quite well, running the cleaning process occasionally felt slightly longer than anticipated.

**Safety and Certifications – A Reliable Companion**  
The machine’s safety features are a definite win. Carrying an ETL certification, it’s BPA-free and comes equipped with key protections like overheat safeguards and alerts for water shortages. This made me feel confident about brewing coffee without the fear of any electrical mishaps. Even during a slightly rushed morning where my focus was split between brewing coffee and getting ready, the device handled things seamlessly. If you’re someone with forgetful tendencies, you’ll appreciate these protective mechanisms as much as I did.

**Highlights**  
- Compact and portable with a convenient carrying handle.  
- Effortless brewing process with one-touch button operation.  
- Includes a water reservoir with markings for personalized brewing strength.  
- Dishwasher-safe accessories like the reusable filter and pod holder.  
- Energy-efficient and automatic shut-off design.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- No drip tray included, so dripping after brewing requires extra attention.  
- Lightweight build could feel slightly flimsy for certain uses.  
- The reusable filter lid might not align perfectly on the first try.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing the Tastyle K302 Single Serve Coffee Maker to similar products in its category, like the Keurig K-Mini or the CHULUX Single Serve Coffee Maker, was quite revealing. While Keurig's model offers a similarly compact design, it lacks the portable handle that makes the Tastyle so handy for travelers. On the other hand, CHULUX delivers affordability but doesn’t have the same attention to detail when it comes to safety features like overheating protection, which, to me, gives the Tastyle an edge. However, Keurig might be more appealing to those who prefer a slightly faster brewing time, while Tastyle excels for people like me who value versatility and energy conservation.

**True Value**  
This device strikes a good balance between affordability and features. Its ability to work with K-Pods and ground coffee offers more flexibility than most products at this price point. Sure, it isn’t flawless with its lack of a tray and lightweight build, but these are minor hiccups compared to what it delivers in convenience, portability, and ease of use. For individuals who travel frequently, live in small spaces, or want coffee without complicated setups, it’s a budget-friendly, efficient choice.

1lwli6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/kilimanjaro/comments/1lwli6t/trip_review_of_8_day_lemosho_route/,Trip review of 8 day Lemosho route,"Just came down from the mountain today from 8 days climbing the Lemosho route, probably one of the best things I’ve done. 

Company:
Went with Kessy Brothers tour, a local company based in Moshi. Saw it in a lonely planet review and had pretty consistent reviews on TripAdvisor. The company was amazing and had a really stellar experience. Cost was 1.8k pp for 8 days

Crew members:
13 members in total for the two of us hikers.  the company recommends at least 12 for 2 people for 8 days Lemosho, but we added a toilet so it’s 13 in total. The crew were spectacular, with a head guide and an assistant guide. Both were highly experienced not only in knowing about the mountains, but the small details during the hikes such as what pace to take, when to use your hiking poles and tips to make your life easier. Every night one of them would do a briefing of the day after, which was super helpful. Both have climbed the summit 50+ times each, so they’re experienced and will keep you safe. The company also offers a porter who doubles as a waiter at the campsite, who brings you meals and hot water in the morning, so on. And then obviously the cook and the porters. Everyone in the team got along and it’s very clear that every member of the team was dedicated to getting you to the top safely and efficiently. Guides and waiter spoke good English. Some porters spoke English, but hand gestures, smiles and laughs get you a long way.

Itinerary: our itinerary was (by campsite) Big Tree to Shira1 to Shira2 to Barranco to Karanga to Barafu to Mweka. Summit night was in barafu. I felt this itinerary was great for acclimatisation, as you can slowly feel there’s less oxygen but it dosnt feel overtly uncomfortable when you go up, compared to probably a 5 day trek. Every morning you’d get waken up at around 6:30, get served breakfast in a dining tent (yes that’s a thing) and leave at around 8. Depending on the day you’d have to walk from 4-7 hours apart from summit day. The trails are never too hard or steep, and the guides tell you to walk at a very slow pace, often uncomfortably slow. This turned out to help for acclimatisation and so you’re never too tired. Day 2 (Big tree to Shira 1) and day 4 (Shira 2 to Barranco) were more steep and it does get you working hard but the other days were pretty easy. Scenery was amazing too. The turn during day 2 where Kili first comes into view is something I’ll never forget, while the mountain ominously gets closer and closer every day.

Accomodation: 
The tents are great quality and the company provides mattresses and pillows. Bring good sleeping bags up to -2 degrees I’d say, because nights are chilly. Starting from day 1 the night temp is around 14 and decreases by around 2 or 3 each night as you go up, with night time at Barafu camp, the highest at around 2 degrees. The company offers good sleeping bags for free to use. I’d recommend take at least one from the company so you can be even warmer. There’s also a dining tent and an optional toilet with a tent

Packing: 
While 8 porters may seem like a lot, at 20KG of weight each, most of the stuff they carry isn’t your private luggage, and many carry communal items such as the fresh food, tents and other stuff. I got 2 hiking bags and the porters carried those along with the communal stuff. The porters are very fit and fast and they reach the camp before you do, so when you finish your hiking you’ll be greeted with hot tea and coffee. Bring plenty of clothes because it will get cold, but the company I went with offers the stuff you don’t bring, and do a check of all the equipment the day before. Not sure if other companies offer this

Food:
The food was surprisingly good for a hike and compared to eg. W trek in Torres Del Paine they gave you a feast. Some days they make you hot lunch and some days they give you some snacks for lunch if it’s a long hike day. Expect carb heavy meals, featuring almost every staple known to man. Your appetite will go down as the days go on and they’ll encourage you to eat more. Basically every meal comes with hot soup as a starter which was great. By the last 2 or 3 days the supplies would be dwindling so food options go down, but every meal was big and generous. On the night of the summit day, we were served a comically large slab of mashed potatoes, which was the perfect energy boost. If you bring your own ingredients or instant noodles they’ll make it, they’re professional chefs and know their stuff. 

Summit night:

Summit night was the hardest by far as expected. Our guides like to walk slow and steady so we were walking by 11:30. It’s a long slog, but you’ll make it as long as you acclimatise and have the energy. As long as you make it to Barafu camp without symptoms, you have a very good chance to make it to 5895 as long as you take it slow and tell yourself that the pain will be over once you make it up there.

Tips:

1. Bring hot water bottles. It gets bitterly cold at night and they really help. Your guides and porters are happy to boil water for you every night and fill them up. 

2. Eat like a bear on the night before summit. You’ll need it, your energy melts away very quickly when you’re walking at -10 degrees. Bring a red bull or something to keep you energised 

3. Take a shit before you summit. I think partly due to altitude I had the urge to shit during the hike twice, which drains your energy. Ended up taking the most scenic shit of my life 5500 metres above Africa, but if you don’t want to contribute your shit to the mountain, empty your system before the summit 

4. Tip generously. Your crew works really hard and they deserve it. It might seem expensive now but once you get to the top they wouldn’t really matter. For a crew of 13 I have about 900 dollars of tip for 2 people

5. Bring headphones. If you’re ok with headphones while hiking, bring them because it really helps for the summit night. Put on some pop music and it takes away from the pain somewhat.

1lwlh27,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1lwlh27/newly_diagnosed_seeking_advice/,"Newly Diagnosed, Seeking Advice","Hi,

I’m new to this subreddit, although I think I’ve been in and out of ‘long COVID’ for years. I got the virus right before shelter in place took effect, and since then, I’ve been getting sick and then getting better, often with strange side effects that last for months at a time. I became permanently lactose intolerant the after my first infection, then last year, I became temporarily fructose intolerant. I’ve had months of calf pain, and months of hair loss. Through it all, I’ve continually bounced back. At baseline, I was lifting 3x/week, running 3x/week, working a demanding full-time job, and parenting two young children together with my husband.

This past December, I got sick again. In the new year, I was doing more or less okay. I had to run after a student at work (I work in special education), and costochondritis symptoms started. I didn’t know what the costochondritis was at first; I thought that it was anxiety because costochondritis causes an increase in heart rate. I thought that I needed to exercise more to treat the anxiety.

I went on a long walk on the same day as a big wildfire in mid-January with a lot of battery acid, and I ended up very sick that afternoon. I went to the ER twice with pain from this. I was first diagnosed with pleuritis, and then, costochondritis. I was told to rest, and I did. I would basically work, drive my kids, and rest at home. I used antihistamines to sleep, and drank a lot of coffee to get through each day. I was on a steroid inhaler and prescription-strength NSAIDs. I initiated therapy for anxiety and depression, which I started feeling around this time. I also had very unrefreshing sleep as I weaned myself off of the antihistamines. 

I gradually started walking short distances for exercise, and doing some simple physical therapy strengthening exercises. But I was continually getting sick; from April to now, I have been sick with various viruses causing fever etc, for more than half of the time. I went to my doctor, and my labs came back more or less normal, although my iron was a little low, and some of the markers around iron come back as dysregulated/low normal. She diagnosed me with long COVID and sent me some info on pacing. 

Recently, I got another virus, and I’m so exhausted. I had to lie down for 15+ minutes last night after putting a load of laundry into the machine. My heart rate was elevated for hours after I took a very slow 45-minute walk to support a disabled child at work. My dad has ME/CFS, and I’m worried that I will end up bedbound like him, as well. 

I saw the research article someone posted here, it seems like pacing is the primary intervention. I’ve started taking CoQ10 and methylated B12, per ChatGPT advice. I also have an upcoming appointment with an acupuncturist. I put coconut water on the grocery list, because it seems like electrolytes help some people. I don’t really know what else to do. 

I’m still working and doing as much housework as I can manage, although I need to take a lot of breaks. Lately, when I do anything, like even brushing my teeth, I feel dizzy, and then I get this weird sensation in my arm muscles. Kind of painful, kind of electric feeling. My husband got in a car accident in the middle of all of this (not at fault), so he is pretty disabled as well. Our kids are only 7 and 9 years old, but they are learning a lot of chores, and we’re paying them for that. 

Some of the posts on here are scaring me. How do I minimize the chances of becoming bedbound? Also, it seems from browsing that many people here (like me), tended to ‘go hard’ prior to this illness. Is that tendency related to contracting Long COVID? Finally, how could I go about finding a good doctor in Silicon Valley/SF Bay Area, ideally in the Kaiser network? 

I would appreciate any comments or advice. This is a difficult time, although I see from many other posts here that I still have it relatively good, and I'm hoping to preserve the functionality that I have.

* Instant coffee linked to a sevenfold increase in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
* Study analyzed data from hundreds of thousands of individuals.
* Researchers advise those at risk to reduce or avoid[ instant coffee](https://worldmagzine.com/food/cool-down-with-these-5-refreshing-summer-drinks/) entirely.

A newly published study has revealed a concerning connection between instant coffee consumption and a significantly higher risk of age-related [macular degeneration ](https://worldmagzine.com/food/the-truth-about-eggs-are-they-healthy-or-harmful/)(AMD)—a leading cause of irreversible central vision loss in older adults.

The [scientists conducted ](https://worldmagzine.com/americas/ruidosos-resilience-battling-floods-after-wildfire-scars/)a comparative analysis involving different types of coffee and eye diseases like glaucoma and cataracts. While the risks were highest for instant coffee, the study also found potential associations between general coffee intake and other eye conditions.

# Instant Wake-Up, Lifelong Risk: Study Links Instant Coffee to Severe Vision Loss

Age-related macular degeneration affects the macula, the retina’s [central portion responsible](https://worldmagzine.com/crypto/the-co-founder-of-solana-urges-congress-to-hire-americans/) for sharp, straight-ahead vision. Though it rarely causes total blindness, its impact on daily functioning can be profound. Dry AMD, the more common and slow-progressing type, currently has no cure—making prevention strategies crucial.

The study, which analyzed data from hundreds of thousands of participants, categorized coffee drinkers by type: instant, ground, and decaf. Researchers identified a disproportionately high incidence of dry AMD among instant coffee consumers, even after adjusting for lifestyle factors like smoking, age, and general diet.

This isn’t the first time coffee’s effect on vision has been explored, but previous studies yielded inconsistent results. However, the scale and specificity of this latest [research](https://worldmagzine.com/research/) add weight to the findings. It also found a correlation between coffee intake and an elevated risk of glaucoma and cataracts—conditions that further threaten vision health if unmanaged.

While coffee has its merits—such as improving focus, reducing certain cancer risks, and boosting mood—experts continue to emphasize moderation and mindful consumption. Filtered black coffee remains the healthiest option, whereas coffee mixed with creamers, sugars, or overly processed forms like instant may pose hidden risks over time.

Given the mounting evidence, reconsidering your coffee choice may be a small but meaningful step toward[ safeguarding](https://worldmagzine.com/entertainment/luke-bryan-is-safeguarding-katy-perry-now/) your long-term eye health—especially as you age.

(Worthy Satire) - What began as a routine transatlantic flight turned into a bizarre survival scenario when a Delta Airlines plane was forced to make an emergency landing on a remote island in the Azores. The passengers, stuck on the tarmac and later on the island for over 24 hours, faced a surreal twist: the in-flight entertainment system remained frozen on the TV series LOST — the irony not lost on anyone.\
\
“We thought it was just a rough patch of turbulence,” said one passenger. “Then the engine sputtered, the captain said we were diverting to an island, and suddenly every screen on the plane started playing scenes of people crashing and foraging in the jungle. Not exactly reassuring.”\
\
As hours passed with limited communication from Delta and diminishing snack supplies, survival instincts began to emerge. Passengers started organizing into task groups — one for food inventory, one for scouting restroom access, and another for “keeping morale from collapsing into full-blown panic.”\
\
Flight attendants, who remained calm and professional, attempted to downplay the situation, offering lukewarm coffee and explaining that a relief flight was ""definitely probably on the way."" Meanwhile, one man tried to fashion a fishing rod out of a seatbelt extender and a stir stick. Others debated rationing biscotti.\
\
“Watching LOST on repeat while being literally lost is... psychologically complex,” noted another traveler. “At one point, I caught myself wondering if the island wanted us here.”\
\
A Delta spokesperson issued a statement saying they were working quickly to get the passengers home and added that the looped entertainment was ""an unfortunate coincidence,"" though passengers suspected otherwise. By hour 20, some had stopped watching and started taking notes — “just in case.”\

Cameron Mitchell's voice was as warm and gentle as ever, yet his words sent a chill through my entire body.



So what I'd mistaken for redemption… was nothing but charity.



In his heart, there had only ever been one woman—Lucy Wendell.



Fine. I would step aside and give them my blessing.



…



The archive room door stood slightly ajar. Cameron's voice drifted out, thick with remorse.



""I had no choice. I already hurt Lucy once—I couldn't let anything happen to her mother, too. As for Marianne… I'll spend the rest of my life making it up to her.""



The deputy director's voice dropped, but the anger beneath was unmistakable.



""But that surgery seven years ago—you could've saved them both! You ripped out Marianne's mother's kidney just to give it to Lucy's mom! If this gets out, you won't just lose your license—you'll go to prison! All for a woman who never loved you back. Was it worth it?""



Not even a second of hesitation.



Cameron's reply struck like lightning through my chest. ""Worth it.""



His words exploded in my skull, leaving a deafening roar in their wake.



""Then keep this buried. Don't let her find out. Don't forget—Marianne's been a journalist for years. You ruined yourself over Lucy… but have you ever stopped to think? You destroyed Marianne, too.""



""Let her find out if she wants. If it comes to that, I'll take the fall. At least I've saved enough to ensure she'll live a rich life.""



His tone was disturbingly calm, as if discussing the forecast.



""Cameron, I just don't get you. Whatever—there's no reasoning with you…""



Their voices faded.



Footsteps approached—the sharp click of leather shoes against tile.



Panicked, I turned to leave—but my skirt snagged on the shelf.



The scalding coffee in my hand sloshed over my white dress, seeping through the fabric and burning my skin.



The pain was sharp, but it was nothing compared to the raw, jagged hole splitting open in my chest.



So this was my marriage. Built on lies and sacrifice.



My mother hadn't died from some tragic complication. She'd been murdered—sacrificed for my husband's precious first love.



Seven years ago, my ex-fiancé Nicholas Martin's betrayal made me the laughingstock of the city.



And Cameron's proposal? It had been bought with my mother's life.



Every tender word, every gentle touch—none of it had been love. Just guilt. Atonement.



Now, it all made sense.



Why the hospital's best ward was always reserved for Lucy's charity cases. Why he personally escorted her whenever she visited. Even our wedding rings were custom-designed in her favorite style.



I was the fool. Parading around in this hollow marriage, flaunting a love that was never real. Just another one of Cameron's pity projects.

1lwl3jq,https://www.reddit.com/r/badreviewer/comments/1lwl3jq/nespresso_pop_summer_worth_the_hype_maybe_at_100/,Nespresso Pop+ Summer: Worth the Hype? (Maybe at $100?),"I'd been eyeing a smaller, more stylish coffee machine for my apartment for months.  My old, bulky machine was taking up too much counter space.  Then I saw the [Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ Summer Limited Edition](https://amzn.to/40Fs1lA) – a vibrant yellow, compact machine promising delicious coffee with minimal fuss.  The limited edition color was a bonus, making it feel less like a kitchen appliance and more like a fun addition to my decor. I decided to test it rigorously for a couple of weeks, brewing various coffee sizes and trying out different capsules.

## Brewing Performance

The Vertuo Pop+ is surprisingly powerful for its size.  It brews quickly, consistently producing hot, rich coffee. I appreciated the various cup sizes available; from a small espresso to a larger mug-size coffee, it catered to my different moods and caffeine needs.  Occasionally, I noticed slight inconsistencies in crema consistency, but nothing significantly impacting the overall taste.

## Ease of Use

This machine is incredibly user-friendly.  Simply insert a capsule, press the button, and wait.  Cleanup is also a breeze; the used capsules are ejected into a conveniently accessible container. The intuitive design eliminates any guesswork, even for a coffee novice.  The small size makes it easy to store and maneuver.

## Design & Aesthetics

The Summer Limited Edition's bright yellow color is a striking departure from the usual black or silver Nespresso machines. This bold aesthetic instantly brightens up my kitchen counter. The compact design doesn’t compromise functionality, cleverly fitting within small spaces without looking cramped.  The materials felt surprisingly sturdy for a machine of its price point.

## Capsule Variety

Nespresso offers a vast selection of Vertuo capsules, catering to a wide range of coffee preferences.  From intense espressos to milder, sweeter blends, there's a capsule for everyone.  However, the cost per cup can add up quickly, which is a consideration for those on a tighter budget.

## Milk Frothing (or Lack Thereof)

This is important to note: the Vertuo Pop+ *doesn't* have a built-in milk frother.  While this keeps the machine compact and inexpensive, it is a significant limitation for those who enjoy lattes or cappuccinos.  You'll need a separate frother or milk steamer to add those features.

## Value & Cost

At $100, the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ Summer Limited Edition is a competitive entry in the entry-level single-serve coffee machine market.  Compared to similar machines from brands like De'Longhi or Breville, the Vertuo Pop+ often comes in at a lower price point, although those often offer more versatility or milk frothing capabilities. However, the ongoing cost of Nespresso capsules is an additional factor to keep in mind. This machine offers great value for its convenience, ease of use and compact design.

## Cleaning & Maintenance

The used capsule disposal system is straightforward. The water tank is relatively easy to fill and remove, although it's smaller than those in larger models, requiring more frequent refills.  Regular descaling (which Nespresso provides clear instructions for) is recommended to maintain the optimal performance of the machine.

**Pros:**

* Compact and stylish design
* Easy to use and clean
* Quick brewing time
* Wide variety of capsule flavors
* Affordable price point

**Cons:**

* No built-in milk frother
* Ongoing capsule costs can be high
* Occasional inconsistencies in crema

**Value Proposition & Price Analysis:**

At $100, the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ Summer Limited Edition offers exceptional value for a compact, easy-to-use coffee machine. While it lacks a built-in milk frother, which is a feature found in many more expensive models, its price makes up for this trade-off.  Compared to most rivals offering similar brewing capabilities, this machine represents a significant cost saving, especially for those prioritizing convenience and style in a smaller package.  It's a best budget pick for coffee lovers looking for a sleek and simple solution without the premium price tag.

**Final Verdict & Recommendation:**

The Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ Summer Limited Edition is a fantastic machine for those seeking a convenient, easy-to-use, and visually appealing single-serve coffee maker. It’s a solid budget-friendly option if you prioritize ease of use and a small footprint. I highly recommend this to single individuals or couples who enjoy espresso-style coffees but don’t need the extra features (and cost) of larger machines with milk frothers.  Skip it if milk frothing is essential to your coffee routine.",1,1752174090.0,badreviewer,0,1.0,False

One cohort received a dosage of testosterone gel administered topically, while the other group received a placebo.

Each cohort of males was shown with five sets of things, each consisting of items of similar perceived quality, but with one item being assigned a higher rating.

The study incorporated advertisements-like textual descriptions of a diverse range of objects, encompassing watches, coffee machines, and luxury automobiles. Men were also instructed to evaluate brands using a numerical scale ranging from one to ten.

While the descriptions of the objects remained the same, certain portions of the text were modified to highlight their connections with either social standing, authority, or superior quality.

One of the descriptions for the purportedly ""high-quality"" watch, for instance, used terms like ""infinite excellence,"" ""durability,"" ""accuracy,"" and ""cutting-edge technology.""

While the verbiage that highlighted social standing included terms such as ""opulence,"" ""prestige,"" ""sophisticated,"" and ""world-renowned.""",1,1752174084.0,Healthymale,0,1.0,False

\
(Worthy Satire) - A Massachusetts lawmaker has introduced a groundbreaking new bill that would ban ICE officers from wearing face masks while operating in the state, arguing that “government agents should not be shielded from the emotional intensity of community feedback — especially when that feedback is airborne.”\
\
The proposed legislation, dubbed the Spit-and-Transparency Act, claims that ICE agents are using face masks “not for health or tactical purposes, but to avoid the sacred act of being passionately spit on by concerned citizens.”\
\
“Face masks are a barrier — not just to germs, but to justice,” said State Rep. Harmony Peltier, who introduced the bill while wearing a lavender scarf and standing next to a papier-mâché statue of Lady Liberty wearing a KN95. “If an agent can’t look a protester in the eyes while getting a warm spray of kombucha-laced rage to the cheek, are they really accountable?”\
\
ICE officials, baffled by the legislation, issued a statement noting that masks have been standard issue for personal safety, particularly in situations where officers face not just insults, but coffee cups, reusable water bottles, and the occasional airborne gluten-free muffin.\
\
“We wear masks to avoid being spat on — not because we’re hiding,” said one ICE agent, wiping a suspicious green substance off his tactical vest. “In some cities, getting through a protest without needing a hazmat shower is considered a win.”\
\
Critics of the bill argue that it puts federal agents at risk and undermines common-sense hygiene practices. But Peltier remained firm. “The people have the right to express themselves with words, signs, and occasionally, unintentional oral projectiles. If ICE wants to operate here, they better bring face towels, not face shields.”\
\
A proposed amendment to require ICE agents to “carry mints and maintain direct eye contact during confrontations” is still under debate.\
\
At press time, Peltier confirmed a follow-up bill is being drafted to prohibit riot shields, “because they’re just glorified umbrellas for cowards.”\

1lwkzmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1lwkzmz/could_the_toddy_thm_cold_brew_system/,Could the Toddy THM Cold Brew System Revolutionize Your Coffee Routine Review?,"**Exploring Everyday Cold Brew with the Toddy THM Cold Brew System**

Navigating through manual coffee brewers is always an adventure, especially when it leads to a cold brew that's better than anything you get at the local café. I’ve had the Toddy THM Cold Brew System in my kitchen for over a month now, crafting batch after batch of smooth, flavor-packed coffee. It’s been through the gauntlet of frequent use, personal coffee experiments, and even novice encounters with my roommate trying to make tea. The brand serves up a minimalist aesthetic combined with purposeful design, but like everything else, it comes with both its brilliance and quirks.

**Aesthetic and Practical Design**

The Toddy Cold Brew System doesn’t scream for attention on your kitchen counter; its sleek, white design measuring 7.25""D x 7.25""W x 12.5""H fits in effortlessly. As it’s manual, you won’t find flashy buttons or LED displays here. What stands out to me is the glass decanter, which feels both durable and premium while being easy to clean. The plastic brewing container, complete with a rubber stopper, has handled my clumsy moments (accidentally yanking it during a late-night coffee prep) without a single crack or chip. While simple, its no-frills design gets the job done without unnecessary complications.

[Check Toddy THM Cold Brew System price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0006h0jvw/)

**Cold Brew Quality and Performance**

Cold brew lovers, rejoice! This coffee infuser does justice to every roast I’ve tried. I tested medium, dark, and even some old beans from the back of the pantry, and the resulting brew was consistently smooth, with low acidity. The reusable filter does a fine job ensuring your drink isn't gritty, a common cold brew issue I've faced with other devices. While the 24-hour steeping process requires patience, the payoff is a concentrated coffee base that’s rich and versatile—perfect for iced lattes, straight cold brew, or a simple splash over ice.

**Included Components and Usability**

One of this product’s strengths lies in its thoughtfully included components. It came with two reusable filters, a rubber stopper, a brewing container, and a well-sealed glass decanter, among other handy items like a recipe guide. The reusable filters, in particular, are a godsend for someone who likes a fuss-free, eco-friendly brew setup. Instructions were straightforward enough for my (decidedly non-tech-savvy) mother to follow when she visited last week.

**Strengths**

- Produces a consistently smooth, low-acidity cold brew.  
- Minimalist manual operation with a simple design.  
- Reusable filters reduce waste and are cost-effective.  
- Includes everything you need to brew, such as the brewing container and decanter.  

**Negatives**

- The 24-hour brewing process might test impatient users.  
- Brewing container material feels durable but isn’t as premium as stainless steel alternatives.  
- Filters, while reusable, require careful cleaning to maintain their performance over time.  

**Target Users: Cold Brew Enthusiasts and Tea Makers**

I've found this system equally effective for making tea. My roommate, who’s far more obsessed with tea than coffee, made a refreshing batch of cold-steeped green tea over the weekend. If your kitchen essentials lean toward simplicity and artisan brewing methods, this product will be a delightful fit. That being said, it may not appeal to those who stick exclusively to button-operated or electric coffee machines.

**Alternative Products**

Compared with other cold brew systems, the Toddy THM isn't the only fish in the sea. Competing models like the OXO Good Grips and Hario Mizudashi also deliver excellent results. The OXO has a slightly sturdier feel, thanks to its stainless steel build, while the Mizudashi offers a more budget-friendly starting point. However, the Toddy nails the flavor and simplicity without needing electricity—making it a standout for more dedicated cold brew enthusiasts.

**Affordable Quality You'll Appreciate**

In terms of cost to quality ratio, the Toddy Cold Brew System hits that sweet spot. It’s not cheap, but its reusable components and robust performance make it a worthwhile investment compared to regularly buying pre-made cold brew or replacing lesser-quality systems. Also, the eco-friendly design means I don’t keep running out for filters, which is a win in my book! If you're after a practical cold brew setup without the overblown features, this is a surprisingly cost-efficient option.

I checked it, recovered files and started windows installation.. During that time, we had introductory conversation, discussing random work stuff etc, nothing fancy.. And thanks to Nvme, it lasted only 10-15mins. Then setting up app installations took some more time then we had our normal thanks and goodbyes..

Later, we shared personal numbers as she needed some help with home PC.. and I've been taking her as friendly and extrovert person, never thought much about it while keeping respectful professional boundaries.. But few months ago, other colleagues noticed us and ever since then, they've been teasing she has a ""thing"" for me and I should just ask her out already or atleast a coffee date..

1lwkx91,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lwkx91/blackwood_range/,Blackwood Range,"The old logging road, barely a track now, clawed its way up into the Blackwood Range. Inside the beat-up SUV, we were a tangle of limbs and laughter, the scent of pine needles and stale coffee thick in the air. Our annual camping trip was finally here, a much-needed escape from the grind of city life. I was with Sarah, Mark, and Chloe.

We found our usual spot, a clearing by the whispering river, just as the sun began to dip below the jagged peaks. The air instantly cooled, carrying with it the damp, earthy smell of the forest. Tents were pitched, a fire was coaxed to life, and soon, the crackle of burning wood mingled with our easy conversation. As dusk bled into night, the surrounding woods transformed into an oppressive, inky black, punctuated only by the dancing firelight.
It was Chloe who noticed it first. A flicker, deep within the treeline, too steady to be an animal, too low to be a star. She dismissed it, but then, as Mark recounted a particularly wild anecdote, a twig snapped in the darkness, closer than it should have been. 

We all paused, the laughter dying on our lips. I grabbed a flashlight and swept the beam across the surrounding foliage. Nothing. Just the impenetrable wall of trees.

""Probably a deer,"" Sarah offered, though her voice lacked conviction.

We tried to resume our carefree banter, but an unease had settled over the camp, a subtle shift in the atmosphere. 

Later, as we huddled around the dying embers, the temperature plummeted. Sarah shivered, pulling her jacket tighter. That's when we heard it: a low, guttural whisper, carried on the wind. It wasn't a language I knew, but the sound itself was a violation, an ice-cold caress against my skin.
Sleep offered no respite. I awoke with a gasp, drenched in sweat. I’d dreamt of eyes, vast and ancient, watching me from the depths of a suffocating blackness. The next morning, the mood was somber. The playful teasing had vanished, replaced by a nervous energy. As we packed up our breakfast things, Chloe screamed.

Nailed to a tree just beyond our campsite, precisely where Chloe had seen the first flicker of light, was a crude wooden effigy. It was made of twisted branches and bound with what looked like dried sinews. Its head was a featureless stone, but two small, glinting pebbles had been set into it, mimicking eyes. 

They stared directly at our camp…

Panic flared, raw and undeniable. I pulled it down, my hands trembling. ""It's just a prank,"" I insisted, but the words sounded hollow even to me.

We decided to leave. Now. The winding logging road, which had seemed so inviting yesterday, now felt like a desperate escape route. As Mark drove, the silence in the SUV was heavy, punctuated only by the crunch of tires on gravel. No one spoke, each lost in their own terrified thoughts.

Then, the engine sputtered. And died.
Mark frantically tried to restart it, but the battery was utterly dead. We were miles from civilization, deep in the Blackwood Range, and night was fast approaching. As darkness once again began to consume the forest, we heard it again. The whisper. This time, it was closer, swirling around the vehicle like a venomous mist.

""Someone's out there,"" Sarah whimpered, pressing herself against Chloe.

A rhythmic scratching began on the roof of the SUV, like long, brittle fingernails dragging across metal. Then, a low thud against the driver's side window. We all flinched, turning to see a blurry shape pressed against the glass, a vague outline of a face, eyes like charcoal pits. A single, bloody hand print smeared down the glass.

I fumbled for my phone, but there was no signal. We were trapped. The scratching intensified, moving around the vehicle, accompanied by soft thumps against the doors. 

The whisper grew louder, more distinct, forming fragmented, chilling words in a voice that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. It spoke of old blood, of forgotten rituals, of the forest claiming its own.
A bone-chilling shriek erupted from the back of the SUV. We spun around to see Chloe, her eyes wide with terror, pointing to the rear window. A figure, impossibly tall and gaunt, stood just behind us, its form barely discernible in the deepening gloom. It had no discernible features, just an elongated head and limbs that seemed to stretch and contort in the dim light. And those eyes, two pinpricks of malevolent red, fixed on us.

The thumping and scratching stopped. A new sound filled the air, a slow, deliberate dragging noise, like something heavy being pulled across the ground, circling our vehicle. The whisper began again, no longer fragmented, but a low, monotonous chant, weaving a tapestry of dread around us.

The figure outside raised an impossibly long arm, its fingers ending in razor-sharp points. It slowly, deliberately, began to trace patterns in the condensation on the rear window. A symbol emerged, ancient and unsettling, echoing the effigy we’d found.

Then, with a sickening crack, the rear window shattered.

The blast of cold air hit us like a physical blow. A collective scream tore through the SUV. We scrambled to huddle together, pressing against each other, as the icy breath of the creature filled the vehicle. We could smell it now – the scent of damp earth, decaying leaves, and something else, something metallic and cloying, like old blood.

The chanting outside intensified, a chorus of unseen voices joining the initial whisper. Inside, the shattered window was a gaping maw, and through it, we could see the elongated arm slowly reaching in, its sharp fingers searching.
This was no prank. No animal. This was something ancient, something that had waited patiently in the dark heart of the Blackwood Range, and now, it had found us. The last thing I heard before the silence of the forest consumed us completely was Sarah's choked sob, and the whisper, very close now, saying, ""Welcome home.""

I don't know how I survived. I barely remember anything after that. One moment, sheer terror, the next, I was stumbling out of the woods, torn and bloodied, into the first rays of dawn. The others... I don't know what happened to them. The police found the SUV, but it was empty, just shattered glass and that lingering, putrid smell. They called it a bear attack, said I was lucky. But I know what I saw. I know what whispered to us. And every night, I still hear the chanting.

1lwkwph,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1lwkwph/how_does_the_keurig_k1500_singleserve_coffee/,How Does the Keurig K1500 Single-Serve Coffee Maker Perform for Offices?,"Coffee has been my lifeline for as long as I can remember, and after years of trying different machines, I decided to test out the Keurig K1500. With its sleek black finish and compact dimensions (10.3""D x 12.4""W x 12.1""H), I immediately thought the design would be ideal for any small business or even a cozy home kitchen. I placed it on my counter next to an arsenal of coffee pods, excited to see if it lived up to its stellar reputation.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that caught my eye was how sturdy and professional this coffee maker felt. At a little over 10 pounds, it has enough weight to stay stable during operation. The substantial 96 oz. water reservoir with a durable handle was a game-changer for me—it significantly reduced the frequency of refills. The buttons are intuitive, and the layout makes navigating its features effortless for anyone who’s even halfway familiar with modern home technology.

**Performance and Brewing Options**  
Switching the machine on for its first brew, I appreciated the straightforward interface. The Keurig K1500 allows brewing in four different sizes (6, 8, 10, and 12 oz.), which was perfect when I had guests over who enjoyed varying cup sizes. I’m not usually picky about cup strength, but one press of the ""STRONG"" button took my coffee experience to another level; the flavor was noticeably bolder and more robust. Over time, this feature became a favorite among my coworkers during our weekly meetings.  

[Check Keurig K1500 price on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b07m67x3gn/)

**Quiet Brew Technology**  
This feature really won me over. Unlike some coffee makers that sound like jackhammers during operation, the Keurig K1500 operates quietly, making it a great choice for offices or early risers who don’t want to disturb sleeping families. I often used it in the late evenings without worrying about waking anyone.

**Benefits**  
- The large water reservoir reduces frequent refills.  
- STRONG button offers a customizable flavor experience.  
- Quiet Brew Technology keeps operation noise to a bare minimum.  

**Shortcomings**  
- While the water reservoir is easy to use, it’s still not dishwasher-safe.  
- It only works with single-serve coffee pods, which adds up in cost over time compared to ground coffee machines.  

**Features and Adjustability**  
I tried various brands and flavors of K-cups in the Keurig K1500, and each cup came out consistent in quality. One day, I even experimented with a reusable pod filter (not included with the coffee maker), allowing me to use my own ground coffee. This option worked flawlessly and added some variety to my brewing. While the absence of a frother or additional espresso options may disappoint some, the Keurig K1500 remains very much focused on simplicity and efficiency.  

**Product Competitors**  
For comparison purposes, I tested the Keurig K1500 against the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew and the Nespresso Essenza Mini. While the Nespresso machine delivered comparable quietness and a sleek design, it lacked the Keurig K1500's larger water reservoir and brewing versatility. The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew was more affordable and compatible with both ground coffee and pods but had a smaller reservoir and could get a bit noisier. You’d choose the Keurig K1500 for its balance of convenience and performance, while others might lean toward alternatives based on their specific needs.  

**Price Performance**  
Considering its features, the Keurig K1500 hits a sweet spot for small businesses or families craving convenience. The long-term cost of buying coffee pods can add up, but the time saved and the consistent quality it delivers make the investment worthwhile. Other coffee makers might offer more advanced brewing options, but few provide the same combination of user-friendliness and performance.

Hey everyone 

I posted before but removed my post too soon as life got busy. 

I am a 30 yo woman from Texas. Physically, I am tall, 5’10 and mixed with Mexican and black. I’m curvy, with tattoos and long curly hair as well. I’ve been told I’m pretty cute. I am career oriented, artistic and super into sustainable fashion. I love animals, spending time with family, thrifting and trying any new coffee shop. 

I am seeking a man preferably 35+ to connect with and get to know from Texas preferably. I am interested in someone intelligent, kind, patient and career oriented as well. Someone local would be nice but I’m open to connections outside of Texas. I love good conversation and someone that can make me laugh throughout my day. 

I am pretty shy and bad at talking about myself but if interested, reach out!

Once upon a time that is in 2024(now if you are wondering why I have written once upon a time, then keep wondering) there lived the best detective in town and his name was Bond, James Bond (no it was not it was Ramesh Yadav). His family included his wife Bhavna, his 2 children elder daughter Diya, aged 14 and son Arush, aged 8 and the most important family member a diary. Ramesh was the best detective in town (Why, you ask? because he watched all spy movies hehehe, no that is not true). His father, grandfather and great grandfather were also detectives and that too the best (no this is not patriarchal story it is just that they all only had sons and Diya is the first daughter in the family, continuing…). The diary was not just a regular diary; it contained the future. The diary had a dark brown coffee shaded hard cover with inscriptions no one could understand (no this is not horror story, it was written NO ONE CAN CHANGE THE FUTURE OR THERE WILL BE SERIOUS CONSEQUENSES, everyone knew what was written. Again, sorry continuing). 
Why detective you ask, because it was their future written in their diary obviously. His ancestors and him have always helped the police to catch the criminals in the world. But they could never ever save someone from dying even if they wanted. (Now for the trauma) 
So, Ramesh’s father saw in the diary that his best friend was going to be killed in an alleyway for money. His father could not resist himself in not saving his best friend and so he decided to go to the alleyway but due to the warning in the diary neither could his father save his friend but also severely fell ill and not him alone but also the love of his life that is Ramesh’s mother also fell ill and both passed away when Ramesh was just 10 months old. His grandfather took him in and named him Ramesh (thus this boomer name) and when he grew up his grandfather told him the trauma story. Now this trauma story impacted his life huge because he talked to no one and had no friend (generational trauma found). He did not even want to marry but his grandfather made him promise him that before his death he wanted grandchildren (yes, the old cliched story for a romance) so he married Bhavna. He met Bhavna through a marriage app and they chatted for a while. They liked each other’s personality and thus decided to meet. When he first saw Bhavna, his heart fluttered and when he saw her deep black eyes he felt like all his problems vanished (I would like to say that this author has been single her whole life and don’t know anything about romance, so please forgive me if it does not give you butterflies). But more than her eyes he liked her nature. She worked in the 1090 office to help women to come out of toxic marriages or help those who have suffered some trauma. Bhavna liked how Ramesh was so pure in expressing his emotions.
And so, Bhavna and Ramesh married and had 2 beautiful children (because who would say that their children are ugly, anyway). He had a happy life cause he had a happy wife. He solved cases, got famous and got very rich. 
One day that is on 21st June 2024, hottest day of the year, he read the diary and in it, it was the day that his happy family was supposed to be sad because in the diary it was written “Bhavna is going to die due to a fire in her office caused by arson”. Ramesh started sweating, his mind going blank because how could he sit calmly when he knows that his wife is going to die. He got up and forgetting the warning of the diary decided to go to her office to save her, but it was too late. The fire had already started, he decided to go in and try to save her. He found her, still breathing lying on the floor. He picked her up like Shah Rukh Khan and was walking out of the building amidst fire like in a movie when suddenly a glass piece fell slashing Bhavna’s chest killing her at the moment. Ramesh stood still unable to realise what just happened when suddenly the diary’s warning started whispering in his ear I WARNED YOU. He stood frozen when firefighters saved him, shocked at what had happened and unable to process anything. He did not let go of her body. He sat her down in his car and decided to drive home, still unable to process. He saw smoke upon reaching his house. His house also on fire with his children inside. Before he could react, he saw the house collapse to ground and 2 burned hands seen among the debris. He collapsed to the ground due to shock and when he woke in the hospital, he thought it was just a dream. He maniacally started to look for his wife and children only to find them in morgue. He opened the diary kept beside his hospital bed, he read, YOU WERE WARNED AND NOW FACE THE CONSEQUENSE (the author also doesn’t know how the diary reached the hospital). He sat devastated, going insane. He found the arsonist, the killer of his wife, handed him over to the police. He tried to kill himself but due to the curse he could not. He would just wake up in the hospital alone and heartbroken remembering his wife laughing through the window when he went to solve a case or remembering his children’s saying – today is Sunday, let’s go out to eat today Papa. He died at the age of 90 with memories he wished he could erase.
(Not every story is a happy ending, most are sad endings only which look happy only on the outside but inside the story is struggling, strangling itself trying to escape its fate).
And if you are wondering about the diary, it has been found by someone who also does not believe in fate.
(Yes, the author is also sad)",1,1752173383.0,storiesbymehaha,0,1.0,False

Washington luxe on demand is not merely about high-priced items; it’s about crafting experiences that feel exclusive yet accessible.

By choosing products that are eco-friendly or ethically sourced, you not only indulge in luxury but also support businesses that align with your moral values. This approach fosters a sense of fulfillment that goes beyond the material, creating a guilt-free indulgence that you can truly feel good about.

When planning your lavish experiences, consider leveraging local resources. Washington boasts an array of exclusive subscription services, from fine dining experiences to artisanal coffee deliveries. Here are a few recommendations to explore:


    High-end meal kits featuring local, seasonal ingredients
    Memberships for exclusive access to artisan markets or craft workshops
    Curated wine or cheese subscriptions from local producers

He moved slowly, leaning on a cane, his cardigan buttoned crooked. The cafeteria was loud with clattering trays and chatter, but his voice cut through it like a whisper.

""Lena?"" he said.

I’m not Lena. But the way his eyes searched mine, desperate, fragile that made me pause. He smelled like peppermint and old books, the way my grandfather used to. Something in me softened. I didn’t correct him.

He sat down across from me without waiting for an answer. ""You cut your hair,"" he murmured, reaching out like he wanted to touch it but then pulling back. 

""It’s nice.""

I stayed quiet, letting him talk. He told me about how Lena used to love strawberry ice cream, how she’d sing off-key in the car, how the accident had been on a rainy night. His voice cracked on the last part. A nurse glanced over from the coffee station, but I shook my head slightly. Not yet.

It lasted maybe three minutes. Then an orderly hurried over, apologizing. ""Mr. Hayes, let’s get you back to your room."" The old man looked at me one last time, his expression shifting from recognition to confusion to something like resignation. He patted my hand before standing. 

""Goodbye, sweetheart,"" he said softly.

""Fifty hours and counting..."" She mumbled, sipping her hot coffee. It didn't help much.

The decompression software crept across the screen as slowly as it had since she started her long vigil. The green line felt like it never moved as the computer unzipped uncountable petabytes of information. All in all, fifty hours

She glanced over at the wedding picture sitting on her desk as her communicator buzzed. She let out a breath.

""Hey, Co'pani."" She slurred.

""Hey, you doing alright?"" The voice on the other end of the line asked ""Haven't seen you in days.""

""Been stuck at work."" M'Zzri replied.

""Not helpful, sis. I'm coming over to that station, and you can't stop me."" Co'pani said.

The door to her office opened as her communicator shut off.

M'Zzri blinked at her sister, who appeared as a Hadikin at the moment.

""Co'Pani, you're here?"" She slurred.

""Yes. I'm here. And so is Hire'. He'll help."" Co'Pani said.

Stepping out from behind her was another hadikin dressed in hospital scrubs. He looked at her.

""You're not in great shape right now, are you?"" He asked.

""I can still chase a crim, sarge, don't worry about me."" She said, though something felt off about it. ""Besides, if I shut this computer off, it will stop decompressing the drive. And we both know chief would have both our bad... bead...""

The hadikin let out a breath, ""I'm not your sergeant. The name's Hire'. and if you're slipping that badly, you're in worse shape than I thought.""

""no, no, I fine."" M'Zzri told him.

Waves of energy washed over her, easing the creaking bones she'd not moved in far too long. It felt like a warm blanket being placed over her. Her eyes drooped, and her head hit the desk. She never felt the impact as sleep washed over her.

She awoke with a start. The once empty office now buzzed with life outside the small, cramped office. The sun shone through the windows, kissing her skin with its warm rays.

""Sleep well?"" Co'Pani asked, getting up from the wall.

""I'm fine, thanks. Sheesh, falling asleep on the job. I'm probably going to get fired.""

""Nah. Talked to the chief. Fifty hours could border on illegally long for a shift. He said he'd ignore what happened."" Co'Pani said, walking up to her and placing a pastry in front of M'Zzri. ""So, are you going to show me what you were working on?""

""Love you, Co'Pani."" M'Zzri said. ""let's find out, shall we?""

she opened the drive and browsed files. The first file shocked her, the vile contents visible across her screen. It clearly showed, however, exactly what they'd been looking for.

She looked over at Co'Pani, the disgust and horror she felt reflected on her sister's face.

""Tell me you have this guy in custody."" Co'Pani said.

""Yeah. Cell fifteen in the jail. Booked on some other crimes. Got this from his computer. This is one of three of similar size."" M'Zzri said.

""Three? And they're all full like this?"" Co'Pani asked.

After multiple dose increases, I was taken off it cuz it did nothing. I felt the exact same off it that I did on it. This combined with the fact therapy wasn't helping it all, I stopped seeing them. A few years later, I was sent to see someone else. This person kept claiming I have bipolar 2, despite me never having any mania or hypomania. No matter how many times I said this, he insisted he knows me better than I know me. I was put on a ton of stuff. One for depression, one for bipolar 2, and one that I can't remember the purpose of. Again, these did nothing. I felt the exact same on them that I did off them. Only real difference was that I had some heart pain. I'm not sure if that was a coincidence or not. Obviously, I was made uncomfortable by him claiming to know me better, so I went to someone else. I eventually got to who I'm with now. He kept mentioning Wellbutrin to treat depression. Given my unsuccessful history with antidepressants, I declined. Some time later, I brought up wanting ADHD meds, since my ADHD was unbearable. He mentioned Wellbutrin can be used to treat ADHD, so we tried that. When I was on it, I felt no difference. After a dosage increase and absolutely no difference, I was taken off it. After that, I was put on Adderall. I started with 10 mg IR. Honestly, I'm unsure if I felt anything. I can't tell if I just convinced myself I felt something. At most, I felt a small difference for about 2 days. Even during this time, I still got distracted quite a bit, procrastinated, felt restless, and had racing thoughts. Maybe the racing thoughts and restlessness went down a little bit, I'm not entirely sure. However, like I said earlier, this only lasted for a few days, as I was right back to the way I was very soon after. Lots of procrastination, not being able to sit still, racing thoughts, getting distracted, etc. I was increased to 20 mg XR. Same thing happened. Like 2 days of a small difference (or me telling myself it worked cuz I wanted it to, still very unsure), then I was back to the way I was. After this, he wanted to see if 15 mg IR twice a day did anything. It didn't. After this, he had me try one and a half 15 mg IR (basically 22.5) twice a day. Still felt nothing. A few weeks ago, I was switched over to Vyvanse. He started me with 30 mg so we can see how my body reacts. I'm aware 30 mg of Vyvanse is less than 22.5 mg of Adderall, so it not doing anything isn't really surprising (I legit have stuff for my summer classes rn that keep putting off). However, what I've been thinking about recently is the fact that nothing that's supposed to affect my brain seems to do anything. Another example is stuff like melatonin. I can take a big amount, like 12 mg, and it wouldn't make me tired. The same goes for any medicine that would drowsiness (ex: Mucinex night whenever I have a cold). There's also caffeine. With ADHD, caffeine usually has fuel opposite effect it normally does, making you tired and more alert. However, it doesn't make me more alert. It just makes me more tired. And that's just with coffee. I tried tea and energy drinks (before I was given ADHD meds), and those legit did nothing.

1lwklee,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1lwklee/should_you_buy_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Should You Buy the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker BELLA?,"The BELLA 35126-043A quickly became part of my morning routine when I decided to try this compact little brew machine. Built for convenience and flexibility, this single-serve coffee maker blends practicality with a touch of style. But of course, it has its quirks, and not everything was as smooth as its oatmilk-colored exterior.

**Design and Build**  
The slim and sleek design of this model makes it a great addition to crowded countertops like mine. I found its matte oatmilk finish surprisingly modern and subtle, fitting easily into my kitchen's aesthetic. The compact dimensions (a mere 6.41"" x 12.51"" x 12"") ensure it doesn’t hog counter space, something I desperately needed. The adjustable drip tray is a thoughtful touch, accommodating mugs up to 7 inches tall. This feature proved invaluable when I used my towering travel mug for those early office-bound mornings. However, while the cord tie helped to keep things neat, I couldn’t help but wish the machine came with a slightly longer power cord to allow for more flexible placement.  

**Brewing Options and Versatility**  
This coffee maker truly shines in its versatility. Whether you're team coffee pod or team ground coffee, the machine has you covered. I often found myself alternating between brewing fresh grounds with the reusable filter and popping in a quick coffee pod when I was pressed for time. The 6oz to 14oz brewing range turned out to be a godsend on slow mornings when a single small cup just wouldn’t cut it. That said, while the simple one-touch operation is wonderfully intuitive, I did notice the brew temperature wasn’t as piping hot as I’d prefer, particularly with larger servings.

[Check BELLA 35126-043A price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b0cyj6xt9s/)

**Performance and Usability**  
The machine's 1000-watt power ensures relatively quick brewing, which is a blessing for someone who perpetually hits snooze more than once. On average, it took me less than five minutes to brew my morning cup, which is impressive for such a compact device. However, as much as I loved the fast preparation, the noise level surprised me. It’s no industrial grinder, but it’s definitely not a silent operator either.  

**Good Aspects**  
- Compact design fits snugly into small spaces.  
- Brew flexibility between coffee pods and ground coffee.  
- Adjustable drip tray for tall mugs up to 7 inches.  

**Flaws**  
- Noise level is higher than expected for such a small machine.  
- Brew temperature could be hotter, especially for larger servings.  

**Competing Products**  
When compared to competing models like the Keurig K-Mini, this BELLA machine certainly gives them a run for their money in terms of affordability and versatility. The combination of coffee-pod and ground-coffee adaptability tips the scale in its favor. While the Keurig lineup offers similar compact designs, they lack certain perks like the reusable coffee grounds filter included here, saving eco-conscious users additional costs. On the flip side, Keurig does offer more advanced features like stronger brew settings, something I missed when using this machine.  

**Quality for Price**  
In terms of budget friendliness, the BELLA 35126-043A holds its ground; it delivers decent performance with versatile brewing without breaking the bank. The inclusion of reusable filters ensures long-term cost efficiency. While it doesn't boast any state-of-the-art tech, it’s an excellent bargain for occasional coffee drinkers or anyone looking for a basic single-serve brewer that gets the job done.

1lwkkdb,https://i.redd.it/oplf65lfd3cf1.jpeg,Request for discussion/reflection: anti-consumption and books,"I was very intrigued by the decluttering books post and was surprised to see so many, what I would consider, defensive comments. This is not a post meant to shame people rather I wanted to continue the discussion/facilitate the opportunity for reflection. I saw some comments saying ""how is this anti-consumption?"" This is what I'm hoping to connect. 

Background/my bias: My parent died unexpectedly/young last year and I cleaned out their house alone, this had a profound impact on me and my world view. I want to be upfront that I am sensitive and overly anxious about this topic. 

I'm operating under the assumption that we can generally agree that anti consumption for us is: 
*Being mindful of the impact our purchases have on the environment/the world, of wastefulness, of excessive spending, consumerism, collecting 
*Identifying psychologically motivated purchases (ie. Buying something because it will make us feel better), being mindful of our purchasing patterns and behaviours 
*Saving money!

If you've never managed an estate before it is immensely stressful. You are likely having the worst time of your life, grieving, you have to do a million administrative tasks, and sometimes you have to clean out a life times worth of possessions from a house. You may very quickly learn that it's really hard to get rid of stuff, that is to say sell or donate it and some of it will end up in the trash. Books were no exception. 

I did donate the books pictured. About ~400-500 books, and about 3-4 more boxes a year later. So it worked out right? No waste, books donated, happy life. It was a lot of work and as mentioned I was having the worst time of my life. This will be unpopular, that's okay, I recycled some of my parents books. Some of those books did not make it into someone else's hands. They sat on a shelf for decades and then they went into the trash (recycling). Maybe if they had been donated a few decades earlier they might have gotten more use, maybe not who knows. Some of the books were not in a condition to be donated or used, too old, too damaged. Some of the books couldn't be donated (cook books, coffee table books etc) I faced a lot of judgment surrounding this. 

At the end of the day it was all just stuff and do we really need so much of it? One of my favorite quotes from the declutter sub: ""I didn't get rid of my son just some of his stuff"" Keeping those books did not bring my parent back and getting rid of them did not tarnish or otherwise ruin my memories of them.

For me personally, anti consumption and decluttering are intrinsically linked, this might not be true for you and that's okay. 

If I'm decluttering items I'm confronting my purchasing habits, I'm donating items for someone else's use (perhaps reducing their purchasing), and yes sometimes I'm throwing out items because there is no other place for them. This feels bad and makes me less likely to buy stupid garbage in the future. 

What i noticed about myself:
*I noticed that I would learn about a new book, side eye the hundreds of unread books I had at home and click purchase. I was excited about this new book making its way to me, novelty, excitement. And sure enough it would join the hundreds of other books I haven't read.
Did I really need to make that purchase? 

*I noticed that I was impatient about purchasing new books. After cleaning out my parents house, I was committed to no longer buying new books, if I wanted a book I would take it out from the library. Almost immediately I became frustrated with myself, I'd look up a book I wanted to read at the library, see the wait list and get angry. I wanted to read the book now damnit! If I just bought the book.... 

*Recently I decluttered my shelf, brand new books I've owned for 10-15 years, untouched on my shelf. Was i going to read them one day? Maybe. I ended up donating them. Everyday I find new books I want to read, while some books have remained on my to read list for 10+ years others I realized I was no longer interested in and I let them go. 

*This is perhaps less relevant. I read maybe 2-3 books a year and while its certainly possible that my habits will change, I was confronted by the idea that I might currently own all of the books I will ever read for the rest of my life. I have maybe a hundred books, some I've read most I want to read. If I'm buying new books every year then I suppose I won't finish all of them. 

We've established that my tastes change, that I love reading but don't read a lot. Should I be buying more books? Buying brand new books? Have I stopped buying books? Absolutely not! Progress not perfection. However I am much more aware of my purchases now. If I'm going to buy a book, I'll buy it used. 

So many of the situations I described made me realize that 
*I felt I **needed** something
*that I **needed** it immediately
*and that ""scarcity"" increased my need.

But what if I donate a book that I later want to read? Library 
I don't **need** to have a copy of a book but i would like to. A lot of my hesitation to decluttering came down to the desire to own objects and the fear of not being able to acquire them again later. I felt afraid and being afraid made me uncomfortable. 

My parent had 400-500 books and I know they had read almost all of them before they died. They really enjoyed those objects. I dont think that will come across well in my post, but very truly if having a large collection of books is what you find fulfilling go for it.

I genuinely wanted to highlight what i felt was the link between anti consumption and decluttering. I wanted to focus less on the collection and more on the why. Why do we buy so many books? Why do we have a large collection of books? Is it need? Does it make us feel good to have so many items? What was the process in acquiring the collection? Books are immensely precious to us, they hold memories, stories, history, do we really need to be printing so many copies? 

I would love to hear peoples thoughts, did you relate to the desire to have a book instantly instead of waiting a few months? Do you buy used or new? Have you ever put in a request at your local library to add a book to their collection? Why are our book collections different from any other collection?",11,1752172843.0,Anticonsumption,18,0.83,False

# THE ROUTE

[https://www.strava.com/activities/14957374787](https://www.strava.com/activities/14957374787)

I am sure this will be way too long for 99.9% of you, but I had an awesome trip and like writing, so I'm going for it. I also got a ton of good information on bikepacking and my route from Reddit (shoutout to u/Wrigs112 for multiple informative posts and responses about Midwest bikepacking) so hoping to pay it forward a bit and perhaps provide a tiny bit of helpful information for anyone planning a similar trip.

I had spent a long time thinking about making a trip and finally had a weekend where my family was missing to go for it. I am a relatively risk averse person who also likes to have everything planned, so going on a bikepacking adventure definitely forced me out of comfort zone a bit. Because I'm a big chicken I had a few requirements as I planned out my route...

* Close enough to home that I could beg someone to come get me in case of disaster
* Close enough to civilization that I could hobble my way to help in case of disaster
* Majority of trip on trails away from cars in case of disaster
* Flat enough that my Midwest legs wouldn't die from going up too many big hills (in case of disaster)
* A one way trip that was close enough to take a car or train to the start and bike my way home

The route I planned out was certainly not the most exciting but I settled on riding on the Hennepin Canal Trail and the I&M which ticked all the boxes. Some other routes like the Yellow River Loop in Iowa looked incredible, but seemed a bit too remote (and hilly) for my first trip...perhaps if I could have found a friend to go with me but no one in my life is really into this kind of thing. 

My initial plan was to take the Amtrak from Naperville to Kewanee, bike north to the Hennepin, and follow that east back home. At the list minute I decided that I really wanted to ride the entire Hennepin, so I audibled and found a reasonably priced one way rental car from Naperville to the Quad Cities.

# THE RIG & GEAR

I was on a Specialized Diverge STR with Pathfinder TLR Fast Gravel 40s. As far as gear went, I wasn't sure if I would be doing this again so kitted myself out with mostly cheap stuff from Amazon brands. Honestly everything worked great...a few links below if anyone is looking for some cheap gear that seems to work (at least for a weekend long bike trip). I was also lucky to have a buddy that has done a lot of backpacking who let me borrow his tent, sleeping pad, and sleeping bag. This probably spoiled me a bit for future journeys as everything packed so small.

I packed my tent and cooking gear in one fork bag, my sleeping bag in the other, and the sleeping pad + tent poles on my aero bars. Seat pack was a miscellaneous hodgepodge of extra bike stuff, clothing, charging stuff, and some food. The seat pack was kind of a pain in the ass as it felt like any time I needed something from in there I had to unpack the whole thing. Maybe need some internal packing within the seat pack for next time to make life a bit easier.

# THE TRIP

I rolled into the Quad Cities late on a Thursday, returned my rental car (lucked out with a big 'ole jeep and didn't have to take anything off the bike to put it in the back), and rode to a seedy hotel to kick things off. Initially I wanted to camp but didn't think it would be a great idea to start off my trip riding through the night and setting up camp for the first time in the dark.

**DAY 1: MOLINE-->TISKILWA 73 MILES + 10 BONUS MILES**

https://preview.redd.it/4cyideiq93cf1.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=79dae016beddbb2d2860c91c998805772dfbfd75

I started out early on Friday riding from the Quad Cities Airport through Moline to the beginning of the Hennepin Canal Trail. This required about 10 miles of roads but they were pretty light on traffic in the early morning and felt very safe riding. Had to do a bit of backtracking to get to the beginning of the Hennepin so I could say I did all of it. The day was hot and pushing 90 but luckily plenty of cloud cover...the trail also has a lot of tree coverage so while riding it never really felt all that bad.

[Hennepin is a combo of paved, limestone, pebbles, dirt, sand...but all in all conditions were solid along the entire route](https://preview.redd.it/b6dx1s9ab3cf1.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=de06146934f3eac72404a4e35351098a0535d109)

While the Hennepin Canal trail is never too far from civilization, you aren't exactly riding through neighborhoods and cities most of the time. The water situation on the Hennepin is not great either...only available free water is at the visitor center. There are decently sized towns (large enough to at least have a gas station) every 10-15 miles along the trail, but some require a bit more time off piste to get to the from the trail.

My first stop was at a Shell gas station in Annawan around mile 40 of the trip. I loaded up on Gatorade, water, and some deep fried nachos (which fit conveniently in my top tube bento box alongside my phone). At mile 54 I stopped in at the visitor center for a bit of AC and free water refill, then another stop at Wyanet around mile 62 for lunch and loading up on food/water for the evening. My plan was to go into town for dinner, but wanted to have a back up just in case things were closed. These stops were all very close to the trail and required heading off the route for less than a mile. Also working towards fulfilling my goal of leaning my bike against as many Casey's as possible.

[First Casey's of Many](https://preview.redd.it/qsqg8fw493cf1.png?width=1336&format=png&auto=webp&s=68b7b468e1619d9dcf930cc8043257e19bad9b6e)

[Bento box perfect spot for deep fried gas station nachos](https://preview.redd.it/icgozrcl93cf1.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9325383a2b5afd83c5cc963db68c0c32601dc6a)

There are a bunch of campsites along the Hennepin where you just set up shop and someone may or may not come to collect the campsite fee from you (they never came). My goal was to make it as far along the trail as possible so I had targeted the Lock 6 campground. There is also camping at Lock 11, 17, 21, 22, 23, and 26. I can't confirm all of these but definitely saw a few of them. 

[Lock 6 Campground](https://preview.redd.it/ulk5314z93cf1.png?width=1431&format=png&auto=webp&s=02b96e6dcbaca69e8d5f2e1783d9499a395ceefa)

I rolled into the Lock 6 campground around 3p and set up camp for the first time. The location was awesome with plenty of trees for shade, a firepit, pit toilets, and really relaxing sound of the lock waterfall going. At this point I was loaded with energy so biked the 4 miles into the bustling town of Tiskilwa for a drink and dinner at the Indian Valley Inn. I had a few beers with the locals (place was packed by the time i left at 5), waited for the kitchen to open at 4:30, housed some of the best fried chicken of my life, then hit the road...but not before stopping at the loan gas station in town to get some firewood and *soda* for the evening.

[Definitely stop at the Indian Valley Inn for some fried chicken...cash only, no tabs](https://preview.redd.it/b4rgekx5a3cf1.png?width=1512&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb15f14355f487a4b1d23458e6b03c802c94a752)

All of my previous camping had been at campgrounds surrounded by other people, so the experience of solo camping in a seemingly random field in the middle of nowhere was definitely a new experience, but this night was pretty awesome. I chilled, sat by the lock, did some fishing, drinking, eating, and all in all just relaxing. Totally whiffed on making a fire as I was unable/too lazy to forage enough kindling and it kept going out on me...decided to keep drinking *sodas* and look at the stars by the lock. Eventually I was tired enough to go to sleep in the heat...did not sleep great but I think that was mostly due to a bad pillow situation, something to rectify for my next journey.

**DAY 2: TISKILWA-->MARSEILLES 55 MILES**

I had planned a bit of a shorter route for day 2 as I was not sure how the body was going to handle back to back days of 50+ miles. My training for this had been pretty much 1 40-50 mile ride/week along with a bit of jogging in preparation for a 70.3 triathlon the week before (not the best idea but I signed up before I decided I didn't want to actually train for it). But doing 80 miles over an 8 hour period is a lot different training load than trying to do 50 miles as fast as you can, so my body was actually feeling way better than anticipated on day 2. To be honest this trip was probably the first time in my life where I was on a bike not trying to just get my ride over with...when I ride I very rarely get off my bike, but this trip I was stopping at every damn thing that looked cool enough to take a crappy picture of my bike leaning against it (and trust me there are a lot of crappy bike lean pictures on my phone).

There was only a few miles to the end of the Hennepin before getting to the longest road section of the trip, around 20 miles from the end of the Hennepin in Bureau Junction to the start of the I&M in Peru. Part of this route took me on to 29 (Hiawatha Pioneer Trail) which was a pretty major road with cars zipping by, but there was a reasonably sized shoulder and not too much traffic in the morning.

Once you get to the top of the hill on 29 you have the option of staying on 29 for another 7 miles or heading down into Depue and taking 1250. I had heard that 1250 was some pretty chunky gravel, but figured I would give it a go on my bike to avoid the fast moving cars on 29. I actually enjoyed this section as there were no cars and some reasonably flattened out sections if you followed the tire tracks. I could see this section being pretty miserable with some skinnier tires but it was totally fine on my 40s. If you were in a race I would just keep it simple and stick to 29 (avoids the gravel and an extra hill climb), but then you would miss the Casey's in Depue!!!

[Some gravel on 1250 in Depue](https://preview.redd.it/u3135jy4b3cf1.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&s=4924a2814a34b10673b56624c6ad19126cdef27a)

[Casey's is where it's at](https://preview.redd.it/dl0exrkaa3cf1.png?width=1333&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2f855a978b0495f44db508aebdbeed1a86a6f2c)

After getting through the gravel in Depue I ended up Spring Valley for a planned breakfast/lunch stop at the Double Country Diner. If you are in Spring Valley go here! I had an incredible chicken fried steak and then a iced coffee for the road at the Bean Box across the street.

[Chicken Fried Steak at the Double Country](https://preview.redd.it/z3c6bm2ta3cf1.png?width=1282&format=png&auto=webp&s=8080d94da7ca617f0ea8b014c7404a250739145d)

This started what was probably the most unpleasant part of the trip, a 4 mile section of Route 6 that had a pretty good amount of traffic on it. There was a shoulder for the most part but still a lot of cars zipping by in the late morning on a Saturday. Nothing disastrous but definitely a road I would try to avoid in my normal biking life. After that I was in Peru and made my way to beginning of the I&M.

I had heard some horror stories about this portion of the I&M but honestly it was not bad at all. There is the occasional pothole that you really need to keep your eyes out for, but for the most part it is pretty solid double track from here on out. I was running ahead of schedule when I saw sign for Buffalo Rock State Park and decided to ride on in for a quick detour. At this point the weather was getting pretty damn hot but the small loop as Buffalo Rock was pleasant enough and now I can check that one off the list.

[Pretty typical trail conditions for the I&M](https://preview.redd.it/z0oijqzka3cf1.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c5c464a5ba6de414ed2cefb7ac01e7414253d77)

From there I had planned to just power through to my campsite at Illini State Park but was absolutely spent when I saw The Cheese Shop in Ottawa just off the trail. Figured I had to stop for a drink and a sandwich and it did not disappoint. Cheese selection also looked excellent but didn't think it would hold up too well in the heat.

[The Cheese Shop, Ottawa](https://preview.redd.it/s9ojvjuoa3cf1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=334539e9afc8ecd210e255e7b351852d1d1dcd1e)

Rolled into Illini State Park around 4p. To get to Illini you have to hop off the trail and cross the river...on the way across I was on the road which was not a ton of fun (2 lane bridge with traffic), but realized there is a protected walking/bike path on the other side. Used that on the way back.

This portion of the trip was a bit of cheating as I met a friend here, so he was loaded up with a cooler, ice, food, chairs, and everything else needed for some proper camping. I still had to set up camp but this wasn't quite the peaceful zen experience of the Lock 6 campground in Tiskilwa.

**DAY 3: MARSEILLES-->WILLOW SPRINGS 85 MILES**

https://preview.redd.it/kt5f76q7c3cf1.png?width=1262&format=png&auto=webp&s=139b002ba38c3f24c5f9b37303c6a20ade64403d

This mileage isn't quite accurate from what is on my route, but I had to get from Willow Springs back to my house. Ended up heading all the way to Willow Springs so I could say I did the entire I&M (at least according to the I&M website, though the mileage markers were confusing and never found a 0 marker).

I was pretty familiar with this section of the I&M as I have rode it a few times from home in Naperville. Made my first stop around 20 miles into the ride at The Morris Bakery. They have some pretty excellent pastries including their cinnamon, but somehow did not have any beverages available...had to go over to the gas station across the road for that.

From there it was just cruising along the rest of the I&M...spotted a bunch of cut outs where you can camp, some looking a lot more pleasant than the rest. Channahon SP looked like a great spot. Unfortunately you have to jump off the trail in Rockdale to make the rather unpleasant ride through Joliet...just not much bike routing there and always broken glass to keep an eye out for. Really wish they could find a way to connect the trail here.

[This bike lean is the only pleasant think about Joliet](https://preview.redd.it/etxdmpoyb3cf1.png?width=745&format=png&auto=webp&s=f287db9dcce4703c8b1f102d1f4169981a363f75)

Finally made it to the end of the trail in Willow Springs and had one final gas station meal along the river in Columbia Woods. The journey to the end of the trail took me a bit past my house so I made the terrible decision to take roads the rest of the way back to save a few miles...this was my worst decision of the trip as the combination of fatigue, the mid afternoon heat, no cloud cover, a head wind, and the radiating heat from the asphalt made these last 10 miles the hardest of the trip.

# IN CLOSING

This trip was awesome and I am trying to persuade my wife that she needs to go visit her family with our daughter ASAP so I can plan another one (guess how that's going for me). I think this was absolutely the perfect beginner bikepacking trip...maybe a bit heavy on the mileage for a true beginner but it was a pleasure just cruising along, enjoying the sites, sounds, and the Casey's along the way. Apologies for the incredibly long post but it was a good chance to relive the journey and hopefully provide a few tips for anyone else considering this trip.",4,1752172751.0,bikepacking,1,0.84,False

Is this legal? Can they really make me use my own equipment for work and then not be liable when it gets damaged on company property during work hours? I've got photos of the damage and a witness who saw what happened.

I currently have a pourover setup at home- Hario V60 brewer, cone filters, and since we have a regular electric kettle at my parents', a Timemore gooseneck pouring carafe. I stopped making coffee at home for a bit, and the last time I was making pourover at home I was a student, so I had a budget friendly blade grinder that I have since misplaced. 

I am looking into getting an espresso machine, because I love a good cappuccino or Latte. 

I really like the idea of hand burr grinders, I like that they are space saving, and I like the small capacity, fill-up for one cup worth of coffee design, rather than having a large holding cell. Something about grinding by hand is charming to me. My mom was trying to tell me that a hand grinder is regrettable, and will be too much work. I think that may be the case for a blade grinder, but not a burr grinder. 

I would like to purchase a hand burr grinder that has a wide range of settings, for both pourover and espresso. My dad asked his coffee enthusiast friends and they recommended 1Zpresso J-Ultra Foldable Coffee Grinder, Iron Grey. I looked into it, and it seems it's more for espresso-grind. 

I saw the 1Zpresso J Manual Coffee Grinder Silver Capacity 35g with Assembly Stainless Steel Conical Burr - Numerical Internal Adjustable Setting as an alternative, that seems better suited for pour-over.

Also feel free to comment what has helped your spells!

1. Coffee/tea soaked paper! This has helped me so much for writing petitions. Coffee is a good ingredient to add if you want a “booster” for your spells, and using paper soaked in it for writing your petitions is a great way to incorporate it into your spell work

2. Tea bags for herbs! This has helped me save money on herbs, anytime I’m at a place (hotel/work) where they have complementary tea I always take a few bags because the herbs in the tea bag are a great thing to use if you’re into more herbal spells. A lot of the time too if I can’t find a specific herb plant that I need for a spell I go to the tea isle to see if there’s a tea that has those herbs in it then I pour the contents of the tea bags into their own herb jar. I see a lot of people struggling to find specific herbs and the tea isle is a good place to look if you’re struggling to find good herbs!!

3. Candle wax to help make herbs stick to candle! I was having a hard time anointing my candles because of how slippery the oil was and because of that the herbs weren’t sticking to the candle well. Now whenever I need to anoint a candle I drip wax from a different candle (I either use white or the same color as the candle I’m using) onto the candle I’m anointing. It’s a super simple way to help the herbs and oil stick onto the candle. I’ve also noticed it help make the herbs less likely to “pop” so my apparent doesn’t burn down lol


Those are the ones I can think of right now, feel free to comment things that have helped your spell work! If I think of anymore I’ll update this post!! Hope you found some good tips from this post!!!",7,1752172478.0,Spells,4,0.82,False

I wanted to share something I’ve been quietly working on for the past 6 months that might be useful for any cruise fans here.

I run a cruise-focused Facebook group with over 45,000 members, and one question kept popping up again and again: “How do I know when the prices drop?” So I decided to build something myself.

What I’ve built:
A totally free price alert system that monitors MSC Cruises (currently just ones that depart from Southampton) and emails you the second prices drop. The alerts include all the cabin types (Inside, Balcony, Yacht Club, etc.) and how much cheaper they’ve become.

Why I built it:
Originally, it was just for me, I’m a big cruise nerd, and I hated checking prices manually every day. Then I realised that loads of other people in the FB group wanted the same thing. So I scaled it up, added email alerts, set up automations, and now… here we are.

What’s coming next:
	•	MSC Cruises worldwide will be added in the next few weeks
	•	Other cruise lines will follow (based on demand)
	•	No spam, no upsells, just genuinely useful alerts

What it costs:
Nothing. Seriously! Completely free to sign up and receive alerts. No strings attached.

A bit about me:
This isn’t some big corporate thing. It’s literally just one guy in a bedroom working evenings after a full-time job and juggling life with two kids under 6. I built the whole thing from scratch with code, coffee, and community feedback.

How you can help:
I’d love any thoughts, feedback, or questions from the Reddit crowd. Anything confusing? Missing? Room for improvement? Let me know. It’s all built with the mindset of solving a real problem and improving it as we go.

1lwkbwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/askPoland/comments/1lwkbwu/bill_payment_etiquette_when_youre_with_a_group_of/,Bill payment etiquette when you're with a group of strangers,"I went to Warsaw as a tourist. I met a group of people at a nightclub. They were friendly, and they welcomed me into their group. After the nightclub, we went elsewhere for coffee and hookah. They were very kind and asked me what I wanted to drink, and I ordered coffee.

In my country, we pay the bill when we leave, not when we order. So, I drank my coffee in peace, thinking I'd pay for the coffee and hookah before leaving the place. I also smoked a lot of hookah :)

When it was time to leave, I asked the friend sitting next to me how to pay and how the system is working. He said they'd already paid. I told him I hadn't paid anything and wanted to give them money. They were very polite, saying I was a guest and refused to take any money.

Another evening, I went for coffee with a different group, but this time I was prepared. I definitely wasn't going to charge someone else for my own drinks :-) So I asked to pay when I ordered. The waiter didn't speak English and didn't take the money. We'd probably pay the bill upon leaving, just like in my country.

So, what is the bill payment etiquette in Poland when you're with a group of strangers? Should I just get up and pay the bill, pretending to go to the restroom, or would that be rude? At what kind of places do you pay at the time of ordering? At what kind of places do you pay upon leaving? How do you split the bill?",1,1752172293.0,askPoland,2,0.67,False

1lwkb5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1lwkb5w/rf_tunnel_rats/,[RF] Tunnel Rats,"My alarm clock goes off. It’s time—time to wake up, gear up, and head out. I’ve had trouble sleeping lately. I think it’s the lack of sunlight. It feels like I’m always exhausted, and the vitamins aren’t helping much. I’ve been here for a week. It feels longer, but my watch says it’s Monday, May 3rd, 2032, which means I’ve been here for exactly seven days. My rotation still has three weeks to go.

Today I’ll keep digging. I think we’re getting close to an enemy tunnel. This would be my first actual subterranean contact. None of us trained for this. Sure, trenches—we trained for trenches, and for above-ground defense and attack—but tunnels? Nobody prepared us for tunnels. The fear of collapse is the worst part. The skin on the back of my feet is peeling off. My commander told me to just tape it up for now. Nothing we can do about it down here.

I grab my gear and my rifle. I still haven’t even fired it once, but I think that’s for the best. First, I head to the workshop—or at least that’s what we call it. It’s nothing more than a larger tunnel, deeper in. It has actual tables, even a floor. Usually still muddy, but better than the situation in the barracks.

Barracks. That’s a generous name for this place. It’s just a wide tunnel with some beds and simple wooden boxes for our stuff. In the workshop, I clean my rifle—again. We have to do it almost every day. The dirt, dust, mud, and general shit gets everywhere when we dig. To make sure these things work, we need to constantly clean them. I guess the enemy is lucky with their older, more reliable guns. “Through shit, they still shoot,” they say. Ours, with electronics and targeting AIs and tiny moving parts, were supposed to help us shoot more efficiently from farther away. But down here, the maximum distance is maybe 10–20 meters. Aiming is simple: just point and shoot.

Nobody was ready for this—this tunnel warfare. It’s like we’re going backward in time. On the surface, it’s all drones—FPV, kamikaze, surveillance, land drones on wheels or tracked—you name it. I hear the enemy sometimes tries using humans, but it always fails. Up there, drones don’t even need pilots anymore. It’s all just AI.

My rifle is clean. My stomach is full. I’ve got my cup of shitty instant coffee, and now it’s time to head out. My assignment is the third western tunnel. Yesterday we hit some rough terrain, and today we’re bringing in the heavy equipment. Lugging this drill down the tunnels is awful. They say we still need our full kit, just in case we meet an enemy tunnel. That means full armor, weighing about 8 kilos, then my camel pack—just a 2L one—my dust mask, half a kilo, helmet about 2 kilos, give or take, rifle just under 4 kilos. And, of course, I was tasked with lugging the tunnel shield.

A tunnel shield is just a ballistic shield, nearly as tall and wide as the tunnel. It has a ballistic visor that can be covered with extra metal plating and a gun port that lets you stick your rifle’s muzzle through. In the tunnels, it’s hard to miss anyone anyway. They’re only about one and a half meters wide and nearly two meters tall. Not much room. We sometimes widen them after carving at least five meters of tunnel, and that five meters takes a long time. Thank the engineers for giving us ground drones to lug the dirt back, so we don’t have to do it ourselves.

It’s been about three hours. We’ve decided to take a break. One of the dirt drones brought us fresh coffee—actual coffee made with a French press—with a little note:

“You’re making good progress. You deserve a treat. —Lt. Melts.”

Melts is a weird guy. He was one of the volunteers for the first incursion, years ago in a different country. He was there when drones started to take over, when mechanized attacks failed, and trenches came back. He came back alive—just missing a leg from a landmine. But now he’s got a new pneumatic one, which he swears is better than the original. We’re lucky to have him. He’s an actual veteran. He was also the first to be mobilized when the second incursion began in 2029.

This time, many more countries got involved. Nobody thought they’d actually go through with it. We built a new Iron Curtain—tank trenches, barbed wire, dragon’s teeth, anti-personnel mines, anti-tank mines, bunkers running the length of the border. But they did it. And it went about as well as we expected: their mechanized vehicles got stuck and bogged down just long enough for reinforcements to arrive.

From there, the war went into trench warfare—but within a month, because of drones, it moved underground. For us, the ones cursed with soft, mushy flesh instead of metal skin, we went tunneling. Toward the enemy. And they did the same. At first, the tunnels were shallow, just a meter or so below the surface. But artillery took care of those quickly. So we dug deeper. Now we’re 20–30 meters underground. Most bunker busters can still take them out, but they’re expensive, and casualties are often minimal. Usually, it just forces us to dig around the newly formed hole.

We stop again. Shut off our drill and listen. We can feel vibrations—not from shelling above. It’s a drill. But it can’t be ours; our closest friendly tunnel is too far away for the vibrations to carry. It’s them. And they’re close.

We report it in and try to get a location. I grab the seismograph from our comms guy’s backpack and set it down. It doesn’t take long. It gives us an approximate direction and even a distance, though it’s only accurate to within 15 meters. Northeast, about seven meters. Shit—that’s close. New orders: dig toward them—but quietly. No drills. Head west-northeast to try to get behind them.

It’s been a few more hours. They’re still drilling nonstop. But we’ve breached their tunnel—we’re behind them. We set up the tunnel shield and call for a drone. We wait.

Tunnel drones are still human-operated. They’re small—tiny, with a plastic container packed with explosives and metal shavings. You don’t need much in a tunnel. We wait. Their ground drones keep passing us, but they’re just basic lidar-equipped bots. They can’t tell the difference between a tunnel wall and a shield. So we stay hidden.

The drone arrives. The buzzing still terrifies me. We take down the shield and let it pass. It flies forward. We follow it into the enemy tunnel, shield pointed forward. Two guys cover the opposite end.

A few seconds later, we hear the explosion—followed by screams. I ready my weapon. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. I see someone running. I pull the trigger—they fall. Another one. He goes down after a few extra shots.

We plant charges to collapse the tunnel, leaving the wounded and their equipment behind. We reposition our shield toward the enemy direction and wait.

They know we’re here.

I hear buzzing.

And it’s not coming from our side.

Now I grew up in the mountains of New Hampshire, I was no dumb yank thinking it was ok to feed Yogi table scraps. I don't think he meant anything by it either- but the heavy gentleman really wanted to get that last point across. Really rubbed me the wrong way, so I've kept to myself for the most part.

Recently we've been hit with a massive heatwave-I'm talking 110-120 degrees a day. The humidity has been sky rocketing; the air is so muggy you could cut it like cake and eat it.

Lucky for me-I have a pool.

20x40 in ground with a depth of 15 feet at the end. When the wave hit, I spent every waking hour either hunched over in my office with the A/C cranked or lounging in the perfectly kept 65-degree water. 

Needless to say, the neighbors despise me. They have to contend with rinky-dink kiddie pools and barely functioning central air. We live right at the edge of the marshland, not too swampy but wild enough that occasionally something with four legs would wander in-hell sometimes even slither in. My neighbor, Ricky, once found a reticulated python curled up in his garbage can.

That was a memorable trash day.

But we've never had any major problems with the wildlife-until three nights ago. It was 10pm-I was parked on the couch next to my gorgeous girlfriend Laura. She's three years younger than me but she already has so much of her life together.

I get by on a hefty inheritance while she works her ass off trying to get through college. She wants to be a marine biologist-a side effect from living her whole life next to a beach.

We were curled up in front of the TV-being bathed in the warm glow of prime-time television. I've been trying to get her into some of the all-time classics.

Though as her face grew pale and sickly as nazi prisoners sodomized each other-I probably should have started with a lighter program. She pulled away from me as a wheelchair bound inmate began to spin around and wax philosophy. 

""Sam this show is so tone death."" She moaned.

""Awe come on- I don't complain when we're watching your shows."" I bit back. 

""Yes, you do."" She countered. She had me there of course. Laura had bi-polar taste when it came to TV; somedays she wanted to watch some reality trash, the others a mind numbingly long nature doc about whales or penguin migration. I could stomach the trash but my god there's only so much you can learn about penguins before you want to blow your brains out.

She made her way over to the kitchen counter to fix herself a drink. She mumbled something else to herself, some unheard backhanded thing that would have caused a blowout I'm sure-so I chose to ignore it. Laura brushed her tawny curls out of her face as she passive-aggressively slammed a glass onto the marble counter.

To her back was the sliding glass door that led out the yard. The pool lights were dim-yet stood out like a beacon among the steady dark. You could barely make out the mini tiki hut tucked away at the pool's edge-the pride of my yard really. From outside you could hear the droning hum of cicadas in their relentless symphony.

Sheepishly- I got up and shyly attempted to make peace. I leaned on the counter-it felt as cold as her shoulder. I averted my gaze as I attempted an apology.

""You're right-like usual."" I offered. She paused mid pour. The coke flowed into her icy glass as she burned her corneas into my face. 

""And like usual you're deflecting from the real issue. This isn't about that stupid show, and you know it."" Her voice was venomous; she'd fit right in with the snakes in the wetlands. I winced at her words- my mind gazing back to the fight we had earlier in the week.

 ""I thought we got past that."" I uttered. She scoffed as she poured a splash of rum in her drink.

 ""No, you just decided we were done talking about it-you've spent this whole week acting like nothing's wrong."" She pressed.

 ""Laura, I told you-it isn't a good time for me; I've been swamped at work-the economy is so tight right now I can't afford two people living here."" I explained. 

""You ""work"" from home and you have a trust fund-what bills do you think you're paying."" She barked at me.

""Uh-the pool, the 300$ rum you're guzzling right now, the 50-inch flat screen-"" I listed. 

""Why don't you just admit you don't want to commit-I graduate in three months, just rip the band-aid off now!"" Laura cried. Her voice cracked as she did and I was instantly flooded with guilt. ""We've been dating for two years Sam. It's starting to feel like a waste.""

She turned away from me and looked out to the yard, drink in hand. I heard a muffled sniffle as I stewed in my guilt. I love her-shouldn't that be enough? If she moved in, I'd have to change up the whole decor, my whole routine. It just wouldn't flow right.

Besides she was going to be off the whole summer on an internship so what would be the point. I swear I think she's just picking fights, so I'll beg her to stay. Still as I watched her silently gaze out the glass door-I felt a twinge of regret.

I saddled up behind her, trying to find the right words. She leaned into the sliding door, squinting as she did. I tapped her shoulder and she squeaked out a gasp and twirled around to meet my gaze. She pointed out to the pool-gripping her rum and coke to her chest as she did. 

""Sam there's an alligator in your pool.""  She motioned to the dark. I groaned in annoyance and peered out as well. At first it was hard to tell what I was looking for, the tikihit looked untouched, grass trimmed neatly; then I focused on the pool.

There was a long shadow sulking in it-this bulky, mishappen thing floating there in the deep end. It was big-from inside I guessed about 15 feet at least. There was this hump dead center in the thing-about five feet in an arch. I couldn't make out any markings or colors-but on either side of the gator were these piercing green eyes.

They seemed to glow in the night, a haunting monster lounging in MY pool. It wasn't my first gator-they're worse than deer down here- but something about these eyes unnerved me. There was thought behind them, like it was watching us back.

I opened the sliding door and was smacked in the face by the humid night. I tiptoed out and Laura grabbed my arm. 

""Sam what are you doing?"" She hissed at me. I broke away and spoke at a low whisper.

""I just want to get a better look at it. He's basking-won't bug me if I keep my distance."" I calmly explained. She darted her eyes back to the lounging creature.

""Be careful- I think there's something wrong with it."" She couldn't take her sight off that bizarre hump on the thing-like a ridged arch almost. I shook my head and stepped closer. The grass felt cool and moist under foot-you could almost hear the squelch with every step. A few feet and I was stepping on tiled stone, the ""beachhead"" tiki bar overlooking the base of the pool.

I had set up all the bar stools and tiki decor near the deep end-so I could get plastered and just dive right in. Makes for some fun parties. My only light was the low pool LEDs lining the sides. They casted a thick shadow on our guest-but up close I got a better idea of the size.

It was 20 feet easy-slim but leathery skin gripping to it. Those light bulbs never left me-I could feel the gator drilling a hole into the side of my head. I was fumbling under the tiki bar-searching for the deck light switch.

It was a swanky set up I had; Christmas lights embedded around the roof and four flood lights on any corner. When I finally switched it on-the tiki bar burst to life with ravenous energy. The backyard became flooded with sparkling illumination.

It then quickly became apparent the thing in my pool was not an alligator.

I was met with this massive square snout-rows of pointed teeth sprouting out in a faux smile. The thing was brown and scaley-stripes of lemon yellow painted its ridged back. The ridge ran all the way down its tail-which swayed in the water like an eel.

The monster was keeping itself afloat with massive trunk-like hindlegs with three pointed talons that looked like they could easily slice me open. Its maw was flat-loose skin folded in on itself like a gular fold you'd see on a croc's neck.

That's sort of what looked like- a mutant crocodile on steroids. The creature blinked-and three eye lids folded back to reveal reptilian eyes-lime green around the slitted iris. Its arms were folded near the chest, meaty looking paws that looked like they could maul a bear.

I stood there safely behind the tiki bar-ignoring the fact that all that was between me and this monster was wicker and cheap plaster. There was this awful smell surrounding it as well-like a swamp full of sweat. For what seemed like eons we just locked eyes with each other, like we were trying to figure each other out.

From the bowels of the beast, I heard this guttural snore. It emitted a low bellow-a warning maybe. I backed away slowly, and the monster unfolded its arms. It grabbed the edge-each of its six fingers at least a foot long and ending in gnarled black claw. It slowly began to pull itself out of the pool-water sliding off the beast's hide with ease.

It didn't break its gaze on me once. I looked around-there was nothing to defend with besides poorly made barstools. The gaping maw slowly opened-the monster bellowed at me-this reptilian hiss that sent shivers down my spine. It had dragged half of its body out when I snapped out of it and booked it back to the back door.

The monster lunged, throwing itself onto the tiki bar. I didn't look back, but I heard a deafening collapse as it shattered the tiki bar under its weight. The lights snapped off-enveloping me in inky dark. My only saving grace was the beckoning backdoor-a glorious beacon among the blackness of the pit.

Laura opened the door for me-I bolted in as she slammed it shut. The sliding glass rattled and wobbled like it was going to collapse. I ran into the counter- a wild eye on me. I twirled around to see my pursuer had given up almost immediately.

It slunk back into the cool of the pool, dragging a trail of broken wicker and tangled lights with it. It swam around for a moment then went back to basking in the moonlight-those emerald embers shinning in the dark.

I caught my breath as Laura studied the creature, curiosity overtaking her like a cat in heat. 

""Laura get away from the door."" I harshly spoke. She stepped back slightly, barely listening to what I was saying. She turned to me-eyes lighting up like a child on Christmas. 

""Sam it's a dinosaur!"" She squealed. She was practically leaping up and down in awe-dare I say she was giddy. She seemed oblivious to the fact the thing had nearly squashed me. I saddled up next to her, disdain for the beast striking my face.

""Laura, that's impossible. It's a-mutant or something.  Crocodile got into some industrial run off or something."" I muttered, more to convince myself than anything. The dinosaur bellowed in the night-like a low-grade foghorn.

It seemed satisfied that it had chased me off and was just- chilling in my pool now. Laura pointed out the ridge and started raving about it.

 ""Look at that arc, almost a perfect 180."" She whistled. ""It probably wandered in from the marshlands. If it's hot here I can't imagine the sauna fuming out there.""

""Laura please just get away from the window-what if its hungry and decides it wants a midnight snack."" I spoke, realizing how frail and smashable my six hundred-thousand-dollar home was. I ran around the house like a mad man, switching lights off and drawing blinds.

Laura was following me around like a puppy dog and yapping like one as well. She had her phone out taking pictures, talking about the ""greatest discovery in history"" and ""She would call her marine bio professor in the morning.""

That last bit seemed like a dig to me-that was the guy who was dragging her away on a three-month internship in the Atlantic. She was blinded by childlike wonder-meanwhile I'm the one who actually came face to fang with that thing.

Course I wasn't going to let her go out and experience the wonder for herself-that would be a shitty thing to do. Instead, we hunkered down in my room with all the lights off and waited till morning.

I didn't sleep a wink that night. My bedroom is on the second floor-decent sized room and there's a massive bay window looking out into the backyard. I get a nice view of the yard- the hulking cypress and strangling vines, looks like something out of *Jungle Book* sometimes.

I laid in bed like a coward-watching this creature just swim gently around the pool. At times it brayed out into the night-and to my terror I realized I've heard that mournful groan before. There have been times late into the night where I'd be sitting at the tiki bar in a drunken haze and I'd listen to the midnight loon calls and the swamp symphony.

I'd hear thunderous cries and rapid chirps-like a hawk scatting to itself. I'd sit there and think ""*Damn that's a big gator*."" Fireflies would swirl around to match my vision-and I'm beginning to think some of those waltzing orbs weren't fireflies. Some of them stood in place-stalking spheres that always seemed to linger but disappeared in a blink.

While I was crashing out-Laura sat cross legged by the window taking notes like she was on safari. Around 4am I passed out-and only awoke to the searing sunlight crossing in. I sat up to find Laura was gone, and the pool was empty. I'd chalk the whole thing up to some fever dream-but that wouldn't account for my tiki bar laying in pieces and the wicker debris floating calmly in the pool.

I raced downstairs-calling out to Laura. I heard her arguing with someone in the kitchen as she was packing up her purse. Her phone was glued to her head as she rummaged around for something.

 ""-No Brian I- you saw the photos; you know me why would I make something like this up? Well, it was dark I- no I'm coming now I just can't find my keys. Alright I'll talk more when I get in."" She hung up on Brain as I cleared my throat. She looked up, excitement having not left her face since midnight. 

""Oh, good you're up. There's coffee on the stove- I got to head to class I'm in a rush. Keep an eye out for our friend just-be careful ok Sam?"" she leaned in for a quick peck on the cheek before I could get a word in.

""Wait-that's it? What about the giant lizard in my yard?"" I whined, not a proud moment I admit.

""Call me if it comes back-I saw it lumber off into the swamp around 5- I think it's hunting."" She oozed fascination with it. ""That was Brian- my professor. He's-skeptical obviously but I think I can convivence him. This is huge Sam-It could make my whole career."" 

""That-that's great."" I stammered, half happy for her, half terrified at the prospect of the dino coming back.  ""But what if it does come back? I don't have a gun or anything-what if it tries to break in?"" I whispered. She scoffed at my fear and went towards the front door after finally fishing her keys out. 

""I did some research while you slept-as long as you keep your distance it'll leave you alone. You've lived her two years without incident-if it's been out there at least that long it would it would have attacked by now. It's just hot."" She shrugged her shoulders-completely dismissing my concerns. With that she waved goodbye and drove off in her jeep, leaving me alone at the door.

I spent the morning texting her ""updates"" as I cleaned up the mess it left in its wake. I say updates but really, I was just telling her I was ok and making sure she wasn't freaking out in secret. She was taking the whole thing way too easy in my opinion.

I think she's a thrill junkie- I took her scuba diving for our first-year anniversary and some sharks showed up. Everyone else in the group nearly drowned each other trying to get back on the boat but Laura?

She kept her distance, but she was all in-she was so graceful-dancing around the fined menaces like it was nothing. When I finally pulled her out of the water she complained and wanted to keep going, started going on and on about shark bite statistics and how they ""never really bite"" and ""You were more likely to get mauled by a moose then bit by a shark.""

I love her but she's nuts when it comes to stuff like that. Me personally? I'm perfectly content staying in and watching the game-brew in hand. Anyway, I started cleaning up what was left of the hut, I was also sweating like a pig and nervously watching the tree line.

My mind was screwing with me; I was jumping at every little shadow and call echoing out from the swamp. Any time the bushes moved I'd freeze and raise a piece of cracked wood in my hand like a club.

I don't know what I thought I'd do against it but if I could jam the thing in an eye socket it would buy me sometime. By noon I had collapsed onto a beach chair- I had raked most of the fallen wires and stuff out of the pool and I just wanted to relax.

Unfortunately, God wanted to fuck with me personally- because it was that moment I heard thudding coming from the swamp. The tree line parted ways as the dinosaur emerged from the swamp. In the midnight sun I was able to get a clear look at the thing.

It was more wide than tall, only standing a few feet off the ground. The ridge gave off this brilliant yellow hue as the stripes traveled down the dino's spine and up its head. It formed a downward arrow at the base of the skull, pointing up the duck-billed maw. It was supporting its weight on all fours, talon-like arms caked in mud and what appeared to be dried blood.

The undercarriage of the dino was stone white and Scalley, like the belly of a croc. Its chainmail like scutes were too numerous to count, but varied in their shades as it traveled the length of this hulking beast. In its maw it carried a fresh kill- the bloody body of a whit-tailed doe lay limp in its grasp.

It was secured in a vice grip yet carried gently-like it didn't want to waste any part before it could safely eat at its den. The beast slumped forward- dipping a painted claw in the shallow end. It cooed like it was delighted and threw itself in pointing its maw to the sky to keep the well-earned meal dry.

It began to chew and chomp at the bits-a dog with his bone. I heard what was left of the deer's skeleton crack and splinter as the dino snapped its jaws-eager to spill the meat down its gullet. I turned away, grimacing as it feed.

I was halfway between the pool and backdoor-I'll give Laura this, she was right. The dino was completely ignoring me. Granted it had a fresh meal now. It swam to the edge of the deep and rested the deer carcass on the pool deck.

It raised itself up like it carefully, like it was sitting down at the dinner table, and grabbed each end and tore into it. I could hear flesh peeling away from shattered bone as it gleefully had its fill. Even as it feed- I could feel its emerald gaze out of the corner of its eye. Like it was daring me to try and take the meal.

Instead, I took my chair and scooted further away. After it was done it left what little remained to rot on the grass- and pulled away from the edge. It lazily drifted in the pool, aimlessly basking in the heat. It took notice of me once and-growled, I think. At least that's what I think that low guttural bellow meant when I tried to resume clean-up.

It also raised its log of a tail and splashed down-spraying me with ice cold water when I got too close. I jumped back and gasped, those icy droplets burned my tanned hide. I gave up and started to head back inside.

That's when I noticed a beige bucket hat bobbing up and down past the fence. My neighbor Ricky poked his head up and leaned over, a friendly smile etched on his fiery red face.

 ""Morning Sam! Lotta commotion this morning everything-"" He paused as he took notice of the leviathan lounging in the water. I thought he would take off screaming but instead he whistled at it in admiration. ""Well, I'll be damned-ya got Lucile in your yard. Awe that's quite an honor friend."" He offered. I Looked at him slack jawed. I ran up to him, frantically pointing at the monster evidently named ""Lucile."" 

""Rick, you look at that-that thing and then look me in the eyes. You're telling me that's normal?!?"" I shrieked at him. He simply shrugged. 

""Been a few years since she roamed this far in-but it's just Lucile. She's harmless-all things considered. Didn't Wayne give you the rundown when ya first moved in?"" he offered.

I recalled when the head of the HOA- a portly balding man who I vaguely remember being named Wayne- trying to give me a packet and explain some stuff. I assumed it was just a list of dues I'd pay later and by that point I was tired and rundown so I kind of kicked him to the curb.

In my defense I was really hungover and jetlagged, had a lot of unpacking to do. Hadn't heard a peep from him since. Like I said I tried to keep to myself-have a lot going on and I travel a lot for work.

I explained all this to Ricky who got a weird look on his face. He sheepishly stepped away from the fence and mumbled something.

""What was that?"" I snapped at him.

""Nothing Sam. Listen don't worry about Lucile-it's this damn heat its drawing all sorts of critters out of the woodwork. I got something mussing around my birdfeeder as well-know what I mean?"" He hinted. I was drawing a blank to be honest and stood silent.

""I'll give Wayne a shout and see if he can swing by at some point-he can probably explain it better than I can. You have a good day then buddy."" he flashed that southern charm at me than swaggered back to his house.

That was a couple days ago-and I am at my wits end now. ""Lucile"" has completely taken over my yard-she leaves animal carcass lying around, she lumbers around in the pool all damn day and night, and she snaps at me when I go near her.

I'm half tempted to lure her back into the swamp with a pile of sirloins or something like that-because I want my damn pool back. I told animal control there was a ""croc"" because who would believe it otherwise right?

Like I said before they came and ran almost immediately. No one in the neighborhood seems bothered by this, in fact I've had people try to come behind to get a photo of her like she's a novelty act. People go in Rick's yard, and I see them peering over the fence like peeping toms. I tell them to get lost and they get mean and snarky.

Am I the asshole here?

Everyone is just acting so damn nonchalant like this is an everyday thing its driving me up the wall. Laura has been texting me non-stop, bugging me for updates on what she's doing. She's stuck at her dorm for the rest of the week but every few minutes I get text from her.

It's kind of nice actually, we haven't talked like this in a couple months. I just wish we were talking about literally anything else. I'm not interested in where it came from- I just want to keep it out of my yard.

Wayne is supposed to stop by tomorrow and break it down for me but I'm not holding my breath for any quick solutions. I'll update if anything comes up but for now-does anyone had any ideas on how to reclaim my yard from this frigging dinosaur?",1,1752172225.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Couple years ago, I moved down south to a humble little town settled near the wetlands. Nice place, small population, close enough to society so I don't go insane.

The head of the HOA-was surprised to find this town had one actually-gave me a grand welcome speech and a small set of rules. Basic stuff: don't litter, don't feed the wildlife, no major noise complaints, don't feed the wildlife, secure your garbage from pests and of course- don't feed the wildlife.

I had set up all the bar stools and tiki decor near the deep end-so I could get plastered and just dive right in. Makes for some fun parties. My only light was the low pool LEDs lining the sides. They casted a thick shadow on our guest-but up close I got a better idea of the size.

It was 20 feet easy-slim but leathery skin gripping to it. Those light bulbs never left me-I could feel the gator drilling a hole into the side of my head. I was fumbling under the tiki bar-searching for the deck light switch.

It was a swanky set up I had; Christmas lights embedded around the roof and four flood lights on any corner. When I finally switched it on-the tiki bar burst to life with ravenous energy. The backyard became flooded with sparkling illumination.

It then quickly became apparent the thing in my pool was not an alligator.

I was met with this massive square snout-rows of pointed teeth sprouting out in a faux smile. The thing was brown and scaley-stripes of lemon yellow painted its ridged back. The ridge ran all the way down its tail-which swayed in the water like an eel.

The monster was keeping itself afloat with massive trunk-like hindlegs with three pointed talons that looked like they could easily slice me open. Its maw was flat-loose skin folded in on itself like a gular fold you'd see on a croc's neck.

That's sort of what looked like- a mutant crocodile on steroids. The creature blinked-and three eye lids folded back to reveal reptilian eyes-lime green around the slitted iris. Its arms were folded near the chest, meaty looking paws that looked like they could maul a bear.

I stood there safely behind the tiki bar-ignoring the fact that all that was between me and this monster was wicker and cheap plaster. There was this awful smell surrounding it as well-like a swamp full of sweat. For what seemed like eons we just locked eyes with each other, like we were trying to figure each other out.

From the bowels of the beast, I heard this guttural snore. It emitted a low bellow-a warning maybe. I backed away slowly, and the monster unfolded its arms. It grabbed the edge-each of its six fingers at least a foot long and ending in gnarled black claw. It slowly began to pull itself out of the pool-water sliding off the beast's hide with ease.

It didn't break its gaze on me once. I looked around-there was nothing to defend with besides poorly made barstools. The gaping maw slowly opened-the monster bellowed at me-this reptilian hiss that sent shivers down my spine. It had dragged half of its body out when I snapped out of it and booked it back to the back door.

The monster lunged, throwing itself onto the tiki bar. I didn't look back, but I heard a deafening collapse as it shattered the tiki bar under its weight. The lights snapped off-enveloping me in inky dark. My only saving grace was the beckoning backdoor-a glorious beacon among the blackness of the pit.

Laura opened the door for me-I bolted in as she slammed it shut. The sliding glass rattled and wobbled like it was going to collapse. I ran into the counter- a wild eye on me. I twirled around to see my pursuer had given up almost immediately.

It slunk back into the cool of the pool, dragging a trail of broken wicker and tangled lights with it. It swam around for a moment then went back to basking in the moonlight-those emerald embers shinning in the dark.

I caught my breath as Laura studied the creature, curiosity overtaking her like a cat in heat. 

""Laura get away from the door."" I harshly spoke. She stepped back slightly, barely listening to what I was saying. She turned to me-eyes lighting up like a child on Christmas. 

""Sam it's a dinosaur!"" She squealed. She was practically leaping up and down in awe-dare I say she was giddy. She seemed oblivious to the fact the thing had nearly squashed me. I saddled up next to her, disdain for the beast striking my face.

""Laura, that's impossible. It's a-mutant or something.  Crocodile got into some industrial run off or something."" I muttered, more to convince myself than anything. The dinosaur bellowed in the night-like a low-grade foghorn.

It seemed satisfied that it had chased me off and was just- chilling in my pool now. Laura pointed out the ridge and started raving about it.

 ""Look at that arc, almost a perfect 180."" She whistled. ""It probably wandered in from the marshlands. If it's hot here I can't imagine the sauna fuming out there.""

""Laura please just get away from the window-what if its hungry and decides it wants a midnight snack."" I spoke, realizing how frail and smashable my six hundred-thousand-dollar home was. I ran around the house like a mad man, switching lights off and drawing blinds.

Laura was following me around like a puppy dog and yapping like one as well. She had her phone out taking pictures, talking about the ""greatest discovery in history"" and ""She would call her marine bio professor in the morning.""

That last bit seemed like a dig to me-that was the guy who was dragging her away on a three-month internship in the Atlantic. She was blinded by childlike wonder-meanwhile I'm the one who actually came face to fang with that thing.

Course I wasn't going to let her go out and experience the wonder for herself-that would be a shitty thing to do. Instead, we hunkered down in my room with all the lights off and waited till morning.

I didn't sleep a wink that night. My bedroom is on the second floor-decent sized room and there's a massive bay window looking out into the backyard. I get a nice view of the yard- the hulking cypress and strangling vines, looks like something out of *Jungle Book* sometimes.

I laid in bed like a coward-watching this creature just swim gently around the pool. At times it brayed out into the night-and to my terror I realized I've heard that mournful groan before. There have been times late into the night where I'd be sitting at the tiki bar in a drunken haze and I'd listen to the midnight loon calls and the swamp symphony.

I'd hear thunderous cries and rapid chirps-like a hawk scatting to itself. I'd sit there and think ""*Damn that's a big gator*."" Fireflies would swirl around to match my vision-and I'm beginning to think some of those waltzing orbs weren't fireflies. Some of them stood in place-stalking spheres that always seemed to linger but disappeared in a blink.

While I was crashing out-Laura sat cross legged by the window taking notes like she was on safari. Around 4am I passed out-and only awoke to the searing sunlight crossing in. I sat up to find Laura was gone, and the pool was empty. I'd chalk the whole thing up to some fever dream-but that wouldn't account for my tiki bar laying in pieces and the wicker debris floating calmly in the pool.

I raced downstairs-calling out to Laura. I heard her arguing with someone in the kitchen as she was packing up her purse. Her phone was glued to her head as she rummaged around for something.

 ""-No Brian I- you saw the photos; you know me why would I make something like this up? Well, it was dark I- no I'm coming now I just can't find my keys. Alright I'll talk more when I get in."" She hung up on Brain as I cleared my throat. She looked up, excitement having not left her face since midnight. 

""Oh, good you're up. There's coffee on the stove- I got to head to class I'm in a rush. Keep an eye out for our friend just-be careful ok Sam?"" she leaned in for a quick peck on the cheek before I could get a word in.

""Wait-that's it? What about the giant lizard in my yard?"" I whined, not a proud moment I admit.

""Call me if it comes back-I saw it lumber off into the swamp around 5- I think it's hunting."" She oozed fascination with it. ""That was Brian- my professor. He's-skeptical obviously but I think I can convivence him. This is huge Sam-It could make my whole career."" 

""That-that's great."" I stammered, half happy for her, half terrified at the prospect of the dino coming back.  ""But what if it does come back? I don't have a gun or anything-what if it tries to break in?"" I whispered. She scoffed at my fear and went towards the front door after finally fishing her keys out. 

""I did some research while you slept-as long as you keep your distance it'll leave you alone. You've lived her two years without incident-if it's been out there at least that long it would it would have attacked by now. It's just hot."" She shrugged her shoulders-completely dismissing my concerns. With that she waved goodbye and drove off in her jeep, leaving me alone at the door.

I spent the morning texting her ""updates"" as I cleaned up the mess it left in its wake. I say updates but really, I was just telling her I was ok and making sure she wasn't freaking out in secret. She was taking the whole thing way too easy in my opinion.

I think she's a thrill junkie- I took her scuba diving for our first-year anniversary and some sharks showed up. Everyone else in the group nearly drowned each other trying to get back on the boat but Laura?

She kept her distance, but she was all in-she was so graceful-dancing around the fined menaces like it was nothing. When I finally pulled her out of the water she complained and wanted to keep going, started going on and on about shark bite statistics and how they ""never really bite"" and ""You were more likely to get mauled by a moose then bit by a shark.""

I love her but she's nuts when it comes to stuff like that. Me personally? I'm perfectly content staying in and watching the game-brew in hand. Anyway, I started cleaning up what was left of the hut, I was also sweating like a pig and nervously watching the tree line.

My mind was screwing with me; I was jumping at every little shadow and call echoing out from the swamp. Any time the bushes moved I'd freeze and raise a piece of cracked wood in my hand like a club.

I don't know what I thought I'd do against it but if I could jam the thing in an eye socket it would buy me sometime. By noon I had collapsed onto a beach chair- I had raked most of the fallen wires and stuff out of the pool and I just wanted to relax.

Unfortunately, God wanted to fuck with me personally- because it was that moment I heard thudding coming from the swamp. The tree line parted ways as the dinosaur emerged from the swamp. In the midnight sun I was able to get a clear look at the thing.

It was more wide than tall, only standing a few feet off the ground. The ridge gave off this brilliant yellow hue as the stripes traveled down the dino's spine and up its head. It formed a downward arrow at the base of the skull, pointing up the duck-billed maw. It was supporting its weight on all fours, talon-like arms caked in mud and what appeared to be dried blood.

The undercarriage of the dino was stone white and Scalley, like the belly of a croc. Its chainmail like scutes were too numerous to count, but varied in their shades as it traveled the length of this hulking beast. In its maw it carried a fresh kill- the bloody body of a whit-tailed doe lay limp in its grasp.

It was secured in a vice grip yet carried gently-like it didn't want to waste any part before it could safely eat at its den. The beast slumped forward- dipping a painted claw in the shallow end. It cooed like it was delighted and threw itself in pointing its maw to the sky to keep the well-earned meal dry.

It began to chew and chomp at the bits-a dog with his bone. I heard what was left of the deer's skeleton crack and splinter as the dino snapped its jaws-eager to spill the meat down its gullet. I turned away, grimacing as it feed.

I was halfway between the pool and backdoor-I'll give Laura this, she was right. The dino was completely ignoring me. Granted it had a fresh meal now. It swam to the edge of the deep and rested the deer carcass on the pool deck.

It raised itself up like it carefully, like it was sitting down at the dinner table, and grabbed each end and tore into it. I could hear flesh peeling away from shattered bone as it gleefully had its fill. Even as it feed- I could feel its emerald gaze out of the corner of its eye. Like it was daring me to try and take the meal.

Instead, I took my chair and scooted further away. After it was done it left what little remained to rot on the grass- and pulled away from the edge. It lazily drifted in the pool, aimlessly basking in the heat. It took notice of me once and-growled, I think. At least that's what I think that low guttural bellow meant when I tried to resume clean-up.

It also raised its log of a tail and splashed down-spraying me with ice cold water when I got too close. I jumped back and gasped, those icy droplets burned my tanned hide. I gave up and started to head back inside.

That's when I noticed a beige bucket hat bobbing up and down past the fence. My neighbor Ricky poked his head up and leaned over, a friendly smile etched on his fiery red face.

 ""Morning Sam! Lotta commotion this morning everything-"" He paused as he took notice of the leviathan lounging in the water. I thought he would take off screaming but instead he whistled at it in admiration. ""Well, I'll be damned-ya got Lucile in your yard. Awe that's quite an honor friend."" He offered. I Looked at him slack jawed. I ran up to him, frantically pointing at the monster evidently named ""Lucile."" 

""Rick, you look at that-that thing and then look me in the eyes. You're telling me that's normal?!?"" I shrieked at him. He simply shrugged. 

""Been a few years since she roamed this far in-but it's just Lucile. She's harmless-all things considered. Didn't Wayne give you the rundown when ya first moved in?"" he offered.

I recalled when the head of the HOA- a portly balding man who I vaguely remember being named Wayne- trying to give me a packet and explain some stuff. I assumed it was just a list of dues I'd pay later and by that point I was tired and rundown so I kind of kicked him to the curb.

In my defense I was really hungover and jetlagged, had a lot of unpacking to do. Hadn't heard a peep from him since. Like I said I tried to keep to myself-have a lot going on and I travel a lot for work.

I explained all this to Ricky who got a weird look on his face. He sheepishly stepped away from the fence and mumbled something.

""What was that?"" I snapped at him.

""Nothing Sam. Listen don't worry about Lucile-it's this damn heat its drawing all sorts of critters out of the woodwork. I got something mussing around my birdfeeder as well-know what I mean?"" He hinted. I was drawing a blank to be honest and stood silent.

""I'll give Wayne a shout and see if he can swing by at some point-he can probably explain it better than I can. You have a good day then buddy."" he flashed that southern charm at me than swaggered back to his house.

That was a couple days ago-and I am at my wits end now. ""Lucile"" has completely taken over my yard-she leaves animal carcass lying around, she lumbers around in the pool all damn day and night, and she snaps at me when I go near her.

I'm half tempted to lure her back into the swamp with a pile of sirloins or something like that-because I want my damn pool back. I told animal control there was a ""croc"" because who would believe it otherwise right?

Like I said before they came and ran almost immediately. No one in the neighborhood seems bothered by this, in fact I've had people try to come behind to get a photo of her like she's a novelty act. People go in Rick's yard, and I see them peering over the fence like peeping toms. I tell them to get lost and they get mean and snarky.

Am I the asshole here?

Everyone is just acting so damn nonchalant like this is an everyday thing its driving me up the wall. Laura has been texting me non-stop, bugging me for updates on what she's doing. She's stuck at her dorm for the rest of the week but every few minutes I get text from her.

It's kind of nice actually, we haven't talked like this in a couple months. I just wish we were talking about literally anything else. I'm not interested in where it came from- I just want to keep it out of my yard. 

Wayne is supposed to stop by tomorrow and break it down for me but I'm not holding my breath for any quick solutions. I'll update if anything comes up but for now-does anyone had any ideas on how to reclaim my yard from this frigging dinosaur?",2,1752172141.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False
1lwk9h0,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lwk9h0/15_minute_group_head_clean_tip_works_great/,15 Minute Group Head Clean Tip. Works Great. [Rancilio SPX],"I didn’t have any commercially made cleaning solution to clean my group head. I tried soaking the parts in vinegar but it was painfully slow with little progress. 

I put a pot of water to boil and placed a dishwasher detergent tab in it. After the tab dissolved and water boiled, I took a little bit of the solution out to scrub the bottom of the group head that cannot be removed with a small stiff brush and later rinsed with clean water. 

Meanwhile, the screen, screw, gasket, and other group head parts that can be removed were placed in the boiling pot. It only took about 15 minutes and the parts came out completely clean with no scrubbing needed.  I rinsed with clean water after to remove any of the soap residue. 

I know the gasket is made for high temperature but I didn’t know if keeping it in boiling water for 15 continuous minutes would damage it. It kept its form and density throughout the process without bending out of shape.  I did make an effort to keep it on top of the other parts so the gasket wasn’t directly touching the bottom of the pot. Gasket looks like new. 

Prior to cleaning, parts were covered with a thick and sticky tar like substance from the coffee and bean oils. I knew when I drank my first coffee sip and it tasted acrid and nasty that it was time for a cleaning. Hope this helps someone. ",1,1752172135.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1lwk8dk,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminineboys/comments/1lwk8dk/the_pro_method_for_weight_loss/,The PRO method for weight loss! 😍,"Ok maybe I’m not a pro, but I lost 60 pounds at one point and these were my methods!! This works best if you’re around 200 pounds and want to get to 150-ish pounds, or something like that. I never thought I could do it, but there are some real golden strategies I learned and I will share them all!!

So there’s 2 main methods you can use, and even at the same time and that’s caloric deficit and intermittent fasting.

First is caloric deficit, this is basically calorie counting and the main one people will recommend, first to start off you need to calculate your “Basal Metabolic Rate” (go to calculator.net bmr calculator) this is basically the amount of calories you can eat without gaining weight, for example, mine is about 1900. Then subtract from that number to lose weight, I would recommend minus 300-500, don’t really go over 500, but 500 is the sweet spot, less than 300 is still good, but you’ll get slower results.

But wait a minute! That will make me hungry and uncomfortable!! here are some quick fire tips to fight the hunger: Eat snacks that are high volume, low calorie; popcorn was my all time favorite! eat popcorn instead of chips, eat salsa on low calorie toast? (Kinda weird but I did that a lot). You can eat almost unlimited veggies and fruit and salad; the list goes on! Always be looking to exploit that calorie number, find the stuff you like most that has good high volume low calorie and eat that! Also reverse the logic, if you can cut out 500 calories, you’re already done. I’m not gonna lie I’ll sit here and drink a full 2 liter soda, if you swap that with water, that’s already 500 calories gone! Also another tip drink more water (we probably all need to anyway) if you’re hungry? Drink some water, if you’re hungry? Wait 5-10 minutes and that feeling will go away a lot of the time. Stomach growling? Think of it as progress!! (Don’t obsess too much though, stay in the 300-500 range, if you don’t eat enough, it wont help it will hurt) 

“Intermittent fasting” is also linked to not feeling hungry, now I’m not sure I did it properly, but my method was basically skip breakfast, late lunch. Your best exploit will be waking up less hungry and prolonging that lack of hunger; and remember breakfast is NOT the most important meal of the day, they have to keep telling you that because it’s so easy to skip!! There are other weight loss benefits to intermittent fasting, but the lack of hunger is my favorite, also if you like coffee, definitely still drink that in the morning because it can actually make you LESS hungry!!! 

Also some more random tips; you will feel less hungry in the same situation over time, if you try this method and you’re able to get through day 1 or week 1, remember it gets easier after that. Exploiting water weight: at first I would lose 10 pounds of “water weight” more quickly and then cheat a little, hang around for a month, maybe gain 3-5 pounds and then lose another 10; not sure exactly what this is called, but I found myself in that situation multiple times. Also age plays a part; I lost the weight when I was 17, I didn’t ever lose weight any younger, but as you get older (20-25+) it gets more difficult and the longer you wait to lose the weight it gets more difficult. But I think most of you on here are around 17 so I’m hoping this is solid advice lol.

I’m sure you were expecting me to mention exercise, honestly, it’s a bit of a scam. You will more consistently lose the weight from eating less calories, not burning more. If you do exercise, that does burn calories and you should add that into the equation (literally) but that introduces muscle growth, which is usually good, but can complicate things; muscle is heavier than fat; if you have been gaining muscle and are the same weight, that means you lost fat. Also muscles can make you look more masculine and that may not be a desired result.

So yea honestly I’m up to 195 pounds from 160 because I have been drinking 2 liter sodas and eating crap and I am getting back into being more healthy. But also keep in mind the process itself isn’t necessarily “healthy” you will just lose the weight. So do this at your own risk and your own discretion; you know your body and situation better than I do; I am giving you MY golden tips, but the real golden tips will be what you discover on your own journey.

TLDR: eat popcorn instead of chips

1lwk6cb,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1lwk6cb/not_sleeping_venting/,Not sleeping - venting,"I’ve had insomnia for roughly 20 yrs. It started after my daughter passed away.  
I have been subscribed Ambien, Triazadone and was on an anti depressant. After 3 yrs I went off the antidepressant. It caused me to gain weight and I personally didn’t want to be on it forever.  
I was first prescribed Ambien alone for sleep, after a time it wasn’t working any longer.  My doctor told me Ambien was only to help me fall sleep but apparently I was not going into REM sleep which the most important type of sleep due to saving memories etc. basically he said it’s like a computer in our bodies and needs to be reset.  So he then prescribed Triazidone to take with the Ambien…he said that would help me get to REM sleep.  It actually worked amazingly for a time. But when I noticed I was starting to have issues staying asleep he said, add another half pill, I did this until I was up to 4 triazadone and 1 ambian a nite.  Then eventually that stopped working.  (People were shocked when they heard I was taking so much)
I also noticed I was having issues with my memory.  
That is a side effect of Ambien and it’s not meant to be a life long medication and here I was 20 yrs on it. (I know lack of sleep is also part of my memory loss)
I would even add a melatonin some nites.  Who knows what all this has done to my liver for 20 yrs.  
So about 8 months ago I decided to go off these meds. (Forgot to add I’ve tried other sleeping meds thru out the years with the same results)  
I’ve always been active, so it’s not lack of activity and I drink one cup of coffee early in the morning to wake me up, so it’s not too much caffeine intake.  
Right now I’m taking Liposomal melatonin 60 mg - along with extra melatonin, It too worked to help me fall asleep and worked well for about a month or so…now I have to add a Benadryl or 2 to that… ( recently starting taking magnesium as well)
I have gone 4-5 days in a row with little to zero sleep until I’m a walking zombie… what this does to the mind and body is pure hell. 
I work full time and sometimes I can’t even remember driving to and from work let alone long what I did all day. 

I’m so over all of it!  I just want to fall asleep and stay a sleep like a normal person w/out taking anything!! I’m also tired of all the “try this and try that”  people who don’t have this problem just don’t get it!   Do they not think I’ve tried it all, done it all…but somehow they think they have the final answer to solve the problem? 🙄
I know they mean well and it’s not there I don’t appreciate the advice, but I’ve really tried everything.  
I have resigned myself to the fact this is just part of my life. 😞

""HIRING!! Night Shift Needed – Evergrove Market""

The sign slapped against the glass door in the wind—bold, blocky letters that caught my eye mid-jog. I wasn’t out for exercise. I was trying to outrun the weight pressing on my chest: overdue rent, climbing student loans, and the hollow thud of every “We regret to inform you” that kept piling into my inbox.

I had a degree. Engineering, no less. Supposed to be a golden ticket. Instead, it bought me rejection emails and a gnawing sense of failure.

But what stopped me cold was the pay: $55 per hour.

I blinked, wondering if I’d read it wrong. No experience required. Night shift. Immediate start.

It sounded too good to be true—which usually meant it was. But I stood there, heart racing, rereading it like the words might disappear if I looked away. My bank account had dipped below zero three days ago. I’d been living on canned soup and pride.

I looked down at the bottom of the flyer and read the address aloud under my breath:

3921 Old Pine Road, California.

I sighed. New town, no family, no friends—just me, chasing some kind of fresh start in a place that didn’t know my name. It wasn’t ideal. But it was something. A flicker of hope. A paycheck.

By 10 p.m., I was there.

The store wasn’t anything spectacular. In fact, it was a lot smaller than I’d imagined.

“I don’t know why I thought this would be, like, a giant Walmart,” I muttered to myself, taking in the dim, flickering sign saying “Evergroove” and the eerie silence around me. There were no other shops in sight—just a lone building squatting on the side of a near-empty highway, swallowed by darkness on all sides.

It felt more like a rest stop for ghosts than a convenience store.

But I stepped forward anyway. As a woman, I knew the risk of walking into sketchy places alone. Every instinct told me to turn around. But when you’re desperate, even the strangest places can start to look like second chances.

The bell above the door gave a hollow jingle as I walked in. The store was dimly lit, aisles stretching ahead like crooked teeth in a too-wide grin. The reception counter was empty and the cold hit me like a slap.

Freezing.

Why was it so cold in the middle of July?

I rubbed my arms, breath fogging slightly as I looked around. That’s when I heard the soft shuffle of footsteps, followed by a creak.

Someone stepped out from the furthest aisle, his presence sudden and uncanny. A grizzled man with deep lines etched into his face like cracked leather.

“What d’you want?” he grunted, voice gravelly and dry.

“Uh… I saw a sign. Are you guys hiring?”

He stared at me too long. Long enough to make me question if I’d said anything at all.

Then he gave a slow nod and turned his back.

“Follow me,” he said, already turning down the narrow hallway. “Hope you’re not scared of staying alone.”

“I’ve done night shifts before.” I said recalling the call center night shift in high school, then retail during college. I was used to night shifts. They kept me away from home. From shouting matches. From silence I didn’t know how to fill.

The old man moved faster than I expected, his steps brisk and sure, like he didn’t have time to waste.

“This isn’t your average night shift,” he muttered, glancing back at me with a look I couldn’t quite read. Like he was sizing me up… or reconsidering something.

We reached a cramped employee office tucked behind a heavy door. He rummaged through a drawer, pulled out a clipboard, and slapped a yellowed form onto the desk.

“Fill this out,” he said, sliding the clipboard toward me. “If you’re good to start, the shift begins tonight.”

He paused—just long enough that I wondered if he was waiting for me to back out. But I didn’t.

I picked up the pen and skimmed the contract, the paper cold and stiff beneath my fingers. One line snagged my attention like a fishhook, Minimum term: One year. No early termination.

Maybe they didn’t want employees quitting after making a decent paycheck. Still, something about it felt off.

My rent and student loans weighed heavily on my mind. Beggars can’t be choosers and I would need at least six months of steady work just to get a handle on my debts.

But the moment my pen hit the paper, I felt it. A chill—not from the air, but from the room.

Like the store itself was watching me.

The old man didn’t smile or nod welcomingly—just gave me a slow, unreadable nod. Without a word, he took the form and slid it into a filing cabinet that looked like it hadn’t been opened in decades.

“You’ll be alone most of the time,” he said, locking the drawer with a sharp click. “Stock shelves. Watch the front if anyone shows up. The cameras are old, but they work. And read this.”

He handed me a laminated sheet of yellow paper. The title read: Standard Protocols.

I unfolded the sheet carefully, the plastic sticky against my fingers. The list was typed in faded black letters:

*Standard Protocols*

**1) Never enter the basement.**

**2) If you hear footsteps or whispers after midnight, do not respond or investigate.**

**3) Keep all exterior doors except the front door locked at all times—no exceptions.**

**4) Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

**5) If the lights flicker more than twice in a minute, stop all work immediately and hide until 1 a.m.**

**6) Do not exit the premises during your scheduled shift unless explicitly authorized.**

**7) Do not use your phone to call anyone inside the store—signals get scrambled.**

**8) If you feel watched, do not turn around or run. Walk calmly to the main office and lock the door until you hear footsteps walk away.**

**9) Under no circumstances touch the old cash register drawer at the front counter.**

**10) If the emergency alarm sounds, cease all tasks immediately and remain still. Do not speak. Do not move until the sound stops. And ignore the voice that speaks.**

I swallowed hard, eyes flicking back up to the old man.

“Serious business,” I said, sarcasm creeping into my voice. “What is this, a hazing ritual?”

He didn’t laugh. Didn’t even blink.

“If you want to live,” he said quietly, locking eyes with me, “then follow the rules.”

With that, he turned and left the office, glancing at his watch. “Your shift starts at 11 and ends at 6. Uniform’s in the back,” he added casually, as if he hadn’t just threatened my life.

I stood alone in the cold, empty store, the silence pressing down on me. The clock on the wall ticked loudly—10:30 p.m. Only thirty minutes until I had to fully commit to whatever this place was.

I headed toward the back room, the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. The narrow hallway smelled faintly of old wood and something metallic I couldn’t place. When I found the uniform hanging on a rusty hook, I was relieved to see a thick jacket along with the usual store polo and pants.

Slipping into the jacket, I felt a small spark of comfort—like armor against the unknown. But the uneasy feeling didn’t leave. The protocols, the warning, the way the old man looked at me... none of it added up to a normal night shift.

I checked the clock again—10:50 p.m.

Time to face the night.

The first hour passed quietly. Just me, the distant hum of the overhead lights, and the occasional whoosh of cars speeding down the highway outside—none of them stopping. They never did. Not here.

I stocked shelves like I was supposed to. The aisles were narrow and dim, and the inventory was… strange. Too much of one thing, not enough of another. A dozen rows of canned green beans—but barely any bread. No milk. No snacks. No delivery crates in the back, no expiration dates on the labels.

It was like the stock just appeared.

And just as I was placing the last can on the shelf, the lights flickered once.

I paused. Waited. They flickered again.

Then—silence. That kind of thick silence that makes your skin itch.

And within that minute, the third flicker came.

This one lasted longer.

Too long.

The lights buzzed, stuttered, and dipped into full darkness for a breath… then blinked back to life—dim, as if even the store itself was tired. Or… resisting something.

I stood still. Frozen.

I didn’t know what I was waiting for—until I heard it.

A footstep. Just one. Then another. Slow. Heavy. Steady.

They weren’t coming fast, but they were coming.

Closer.

Whoever—or whatever—it was, it wasn’t in a rush. And it wasn’t trying to be quiet either.

My fingers had gone numb around the cart handle.

Rule Five.

**If the lights flicker more than twice in a minute, stop all work immediately and hide until 1 a.m.**

My heartbeat climbed into my throat. I let go of the cart and began backing away, moving as quietly as I could across the scuffed tile.

The aisles around me seemed to shift, shelves towering like skeletons under those flickering lights. Their shadows twisted across the floor, long and jagged, like they could reach out and pull me in.

My eyes searched the store. I needed to hide. Fast.

That’s when the footsteps—once slow and deliberate—broke into a full sprint.

Whatever it was, it had stopped pretending.

I didn’t think. I just ran, heart hammering against my ribs, breath sharp in my throat as I tore down the aisle, desperate for someplace—anyplace—to hide.

The employee office. The door near the stockroom. I remembered it from earlier.

The footsteps were right behind me now—pounding, frantic, inhumanly fast.

I reached the door just as the lights cut out completely.

Pitch black.

I slammed into the wall, palms scraping across rough plaster as I fumbled for the doorknob. 5 full seconds. That’s how long I was blind, vulnerable, exposed—my fingers clawing in the dark while whatever was chasing me gained ground.

I slipped inside the office, slammed the door shut, and turned the lock with a soft, deliberate click.

Darkness swallowed the room.

I didn’t dare turn on my phone’s light. Instead, I crouched low, pressing my back flat against the cold wall, every breath shaking in my chest. My heart thundered like a drumbeat in a silent theater.

I had no idea what time it was. No clue how long I’d have to stay hidden. I didn’t even know what was waiting out there in the dark.

I stayed there, frozen in the dark, listening.

At first, every creak made my chest seize. Every whisper of wind outside the walls sounded like breathing. But after a while... the silence settled.

And somewhere in that suffocating quiet, sleep crept in.

I must’ve dozed off—just for a moment.

Because I woke with a jolt as the overhead lights buzzed and flickered back on, casting a pale glow on the office floor.

I blinked hard, disoriented, then fumbled for my phone.

1:15 a.m.

“Damn it,” I muttered, voice hoarse and cracked.

Whatever the hell was going on in this store… I didn’t want any part of it.

But my train of thought was cut short by a soft ding from the front counter.

The bell.

The reception bell.

“Is anyone there?”

A woman’s voice—gentle, but firm. Too calm for this hour.

I froze, every instinct screaming for me to stay put.

But Rule Four whispered in the back of my mind:

**Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

But it wasn’t 2 a.m. yet. So, against every ounce of better judgment, I pushed myself to my feet, knees stiff, back aching, and slowly crept toward the register.

And that’s when I saw her.

She stood perfectly still at the counter, hands folded neatly in front of her.

Pale as frost. Skin like cracked porcelain pulled from the freezer.

Her hair spilled down in heavy, straight strands—gray and black, striped like static on an old analog screen.

She wore a long, dark coat. Perfectly still. Perfectly pressed.

And she was smiling.

Polite. Measured. Almost mechanical.

But her eyes didn’t smile.

They just stared.

Something about her felt… wrong.

Not in the way people can be strange. In the way things pretend to be people.

She looked human.

Almost.

“Can I help you?” I asked, my voice shakier than I wanted it to be.

Part of me was hoping she wouldn’t answer.

Her smile twitched—just a little.

Too sharp. Too rehearsed.

“Yes,” she said.

The word hung in the air, cold and smooth, like it had been repeated to a mirror one too many times.

“I’m looking for something.”

I hesitated. “What… kind of something?”

She tilted her head—slowly, mechanically—like she wasn’t used to the weight of it.

“Do you guys have meat?” she asked.

The word hit harder than it should’ve.

Meat.

My blood ran cold. “Meat?,” I stammered. My voice thinned with each word.

She didn’t move. Didn’t blink.

Just stared.

“Didn’t you get a new shipment tonight?” she asked. Still calm. Still smiling.

And that’s when it hit me.

I had stocked meat tonight. Not in the aisle—but in the freezer in the back room. Two vacuum-sealed packs. No label. No origin. Just sitting there when I opened the store’s delivery crate…Two silent, shrink-wrapped slabs of something.

And that was all the meat in the entire store.

Just those two.

“Yes,” I said, barely louder than a whisper. “You can find it in the back…in the frozen section.”

She looked at me.

Not for a second. Not for ten.

But for two full minutes.

She didn’t move.

Didn’t blink.

Just stood there, that same polite smile frozen across a face that didn’t breathe… couldn’t breathe.

And then she said it.

“Thank you, Remi.”

My stomach dropped.

I never told her my name and my uniform didn't even have a nameplate.

But before I could react, she turned—slow, mechanical—and began walking down the back hallway.

That’s when I saw them.

Her feet.

They weren’t aligned with her body—angled just slightly toward the entrance, like she’d walked in backward… and never fixed it.

As she walked away—those misaligned feet shuffling against the linoleum—I stayed frozen behind the counter, eyes locked on her until she disappeared into the back hallway.

Silence returned, thick and heavy.

I waited. One second. Then ten. Then a full minute.

No sound. No footsteps. No freezer door opening.

Just silence.

I should’ve stayed behind the counter. I knew I should have. But something pulled at me. Curiosity. Stupidity. A need to know if those meat packs were even still there.

So I moved.

I moved down the hallway, one cautious step at a time.

The overhead lights buzzed softly—no flickering, just a steady, dull hum. Dimmer than before. Almost like they didn’t want to witness what was ahead.

The back room door stood open.

I hesitated at the threshold, heart hammering in my chest. The freezer was closed. Exactly how I’d left it. But she was gone. No trace of her. No footprints. No sound. Then I noticed it—one of the meat packets was missing. My stomach turned. And that’s when I heard it.

Ding. The soft chime of the front door bell. I bolted back toward the front, sneakers slipping on the tile. By the time I reached the counter, the door was already swinging shut with a gentle click. Outside? Empty parking lot. Inside? No one.

She was gone.

And I collapsed.

My knees gave out beneath me as panic took over, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might tear through my chest. My breath came in short gasps. Every instinct screamed Run, escape—get out.

But then I remembered Rule Six:

**Do not exit the premises during your scheduled shift unless explicitly authorized.**

I stared at the front door like it might bite me.

I couldn’t leave.

I was trapped.

My hands were trembling. I needed to regroup—breathe, think. I stumbled to the employee restroom and splashed cold water on my face, hoping it would shock my mind back into something resembling calm.

And that’s when I saw it.

In the mirror—wedged between the glass and the frame—was a folded piece of paper. Just barely sticking out.

I pulled it free and opened it.

Four words. Bold, smeared, urgent:

DONT ACCEPT THE PROMOTION.

“What the hell…” I whispered.

I stepped out of the bathroom in a daze, the note still clutched in my hand, and made my way back to the stockroom, trying to focus on something normal. Sorting. Stacking. Anything to distract myself from whatever this was.

That’s when I saw it.

A stairwell.

Half-hidden behind a row of unmarked boxes—steps leading down. The hallway at the bottom stretched into a wide, dark tunnel that ended at a heavy iron door.

I felt my stomach twist.

The basement.

The one from Rule One:

**Never enter the basement.**

I shouldn’t have even looked. But I did. I peeked at the closed door.

And that’s when I heard it.

A voice. Muffled, desperate.

“Let me out…”

Bang.

“Please!” another voice cried, pounding the door from the other side.

Then another. And another.

A rising chorus of fists and pleas. The sound of multiple people screaming—screaming like their souls were on fire. Bloodcurdling, ragged, animalistic.

I turned and ran.

Bolted across the store, sprinting in the opposite direction, away from the basement, away from those voices. The farther I got, the quieter it became.

By the time I reached the far side of the store, it was silent again.

As if no one had ever spoken. As if no one had screamed. As if that door at the bottom of the stairs didn’t exist.

Then the bell at the reception desk rang.

Ding.

I froze.

Rule Four punched through my fog of fear:

**Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

I slowly turned toward the clock hanging at the center of the store.

2:35 a.m.

Shit.

The bell rang again—harder this time. More impatient. I was directly across the store, hidden behind an aisle, far from the counter.

I crouched low and peeked through a gap between shelves.

And what I saw chilled me to the bone.

It wasn’t a person.

It was a creature—crouched on all fours, nearly six feet tall and hunched. Its skin was hairless, stretched and raw like sun-scorched flesh. Its limbs were too long. Its fingers curled around the edge of the counter like claws.

And its face…

It had no eyes.

Just a gaping, unhinged jaw—so wide I couldn’t tell if it was screaming or simply unable to close.

It turned its head in my direction.

It didn’t need eyes to know.

Then—

The alarm went off.

Rule Ten echoed in my head like a warning bell:

**If the emergency alarm sounds, cease all tasks immediately and remain still. Do not speak. Do not move until the sound stops. And ignore the voice that speaks.**

The sirens wailed through the store—shrill and disorienting. I froze, forcing every muscle in my body to go still. I didn’t even dare to blink.

And then, beneath the screech of the alarm, came the voice.

Low and Crooked. Not human.

“Remi… in Aisle 6… report to the reception.”

The voice repeated it again, warped and mechanical like it was being dragged through static.

“Remi in Aisle 6… come to the desk.”

I didn’t move.

Didn’t breathe.

But my eyes—my traitorous eyes—drifted upward. And what I saw made my stomach drop through the floor.

Aisle 6.

I was in Aisle 6.

The second I realized it, I heard it move.

The thing behind the desk snapped its head and launched forward—charging down the store like it had been waiting for this cue. I didn’t wait. I didn't think. Just whispered “Screw this,” and ran.

The sirens only got louder. Harsher. Shadows started slithering out from between shelves, writhing like smoke with claws—reaching, grasping.

Every step I took felt like outrunning death itself.

The creature was behind me now, fast and wild, crashing through displays, howling without a mouth that ever closed. The shadows weren’t far behind—hungry, screaming through the noise.

I turned sharply toward the back hallway, toward the only place left: the stairwell.

I shoved the basement door open and slipped behind it at the last second, flattening myself behind the frame just as the creature skidded through.

It didn’t see me.

It didn’t even hesitate.

It charged down the stairs, dragging the shadows with it into the dark.

I slammed the door shut and twisted the handle.

Click.

It auto-locked. Thank God.

The pounding began immediately.

Fists—or claws—beating against the other side. Screams—inhuman, layered, dozens of voices all at once—rose from beneath the floor like a chorus of the damned.

I collapsed beside the door, chest heaving, soaked in sweat. Every nerve in my body was fried, my thoughts scrambled and spinning.

I sat there for what felt like forever—maybe an hour, maybe more—while the screams continued, until they faded into silence.

Eventually, I dragged myself to the breakroom.

No sirens. No voices. Just the hum of the fridge and the buzz of old lights.

I made myself coffee with shaking hands, not because I needed it—because I didn’t know what else to do.

I stared at the cup like it might offer answers to questions I was too tired—and too scared—to ask.

All I could think was:

God, I hope I never come back.

But even as the thought passed through me, I knew it was a lie.

The contract said one year.

One full year of this madness.

And there was no getting out.

By the time 6 a.m. rolled around, the store had returned to its usual, suffocating quiet—like nothing had ever happened.

Then the bell above the front door jingled.

The old man walked in.

He paused when he saw me sitting in the breakroom. Alive.

“You’re still here?” he asked, genuinely surprised.

I looked up, dead-eyed. “No shit, Sherlock.”

He let out a low chuckle, almost impressed. “Told you it wasn’t your average night shift. But I think this is the first time a newbie has actually made it through the first night.”

“Not an average night shift doesn’t mean you die on the clock, old man,” I muttered.

He brushed off the criticism with a shrug. “You followed the rules. That’s the only reason you’re still breathing.”

I swallowed hard, my voice barely steady. “Can I quit?”

His eyes didn’t even flicker. “Nope. The contract says one year.”

I already knew that but it still stung hearing it out loud.

“But,” he added, casually, “there’s a way out.”

I looked up slowly, wary.

“You can leave early,” he said, “if you get promoted.”

That word stopped me cold.

DON’T ACCEPT THE PROMOTION.

The note in the bathroom flashed through my mind like a warning shot.

“Promotion?” I asked, carefully measuring the word.

“Not many make it that far,” he said, matter-of-fact. No emotion. No concern. Like he was stating the weather.

I didn’t respond. Just stared.

He slid an envelope across the table.

Inside: my paycheck.

$500.

For one night of surviving hell.

“You earned it,” he said, standing. “Uniform rack’ll have your size ready by tonight. See you at eleven.”

Then he walked out. Calm. Routine. Like we’d just finished another late shift at a grocery store.

But nothing about this job was normal.

And if “not many make it to the promotion,” that could only mean one thing.

Most don’t make it at all.

I pocketed the check and stepped out into the pale morning light.

The parking lot was still. Too still.

I walked to my car, every step echoing louder than it should’ve. I slid into the driver’s seat, hands gripping the wheel—knuckles white.

I sat there for a long time, engine off, staring at the rising sun.

Thinking.

Wondering if I’d be stupid enough to come back tomorrow.

And knowing, deep down…

1lwk47g,https://www.reddit.com/r/lego_/comments/1lwk47g/the_creators_return_nostalgia_in_a_box_of_bricks/,The Creator’s Return: Nostalgia in a Box of Bricks,"It was a Friday night, long after the sun had set and the workweek had worn me thin, when I walked into Toys“R”Us, not as a child tugging at a parent’s sleeve, but as a 42-year-old man with a quiet ache in his chest and a credit card in his wallet. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a familiar glow on aisles that once felt like kingdoms. I wasn’t there to browse. I was there on a mission: to reclaim something I hadn’t realized I’d lost.



I left the store with three large LEGO sets stacked in my cart like treasure:  

\- A pirate ship, complete with a parrot, monkey, shark, British soldiers, and a crew of grinning rogues.  

\- A fantasy set, where skeletons clashed with an evil wizard, two towering ogres, and a damsel in distress.  

\- A medieval siege tower, bristling with mounted knights and the promise of epic battles.



The total came to around $250. I didn’t flinch. As I pushed the cart to my car, the night air felt different—charged, almost electric. I wasn’t just carrying plastic bricks. I was carrying echoes of Saturday mornings long past, of carpeted battlefields and kingdoms built between couch cushions.



When I got home, I set the boxes on top of a collapsible picnic table in my living room. They sat there like unopened portals. I didn’t tear into them right away. Instead, I went out for drinks with friends, the way adults do. But even as we laughed and clinked glasses, part of me was already back home, hearing the crinkle of plastic bags and the rustle of instruction booklets.



The next morning, I slept in until 10 a.m.—a luxury in itself. I brewed a strong cup of coffee, sat down at the table, and opened the first box. The smell hit me instantly: that unmistakable scent of fresh plastic, of possibility. The instruction booklet unfolded like a sacred text. The minifigs, still in pieces, looked up at me with blank expressions, waiting to be given life.



And I became the Creator.



One by one, I built them all. The pirate ship sailed first, then the fantasy realm rose from the table, and finally the siege tower rolled into place. But I didn’t stop there. I merged them. In my world, there was no need for good versus evil. Pirates, ogres, knights, and wizards all coexisted. They built a society together, fought side by side against whatever threat I imagined next. It was a world without factions, without rules—just pure, unfiltered imagination.



And then, as the last brick clicked into place, the sadness crept in.



Not because the sets were finished, but because I knew what this moment truly was: a beautiful, fleeting return to a time that no longer exists. Childhood isn’t something you can rebuild, no matter how many sets you buy. You can visit, yes. You can even live there for a weekend. But eventually, the spell breaks. The coffee gets cold. The table gets cleared. And the world outside calls you back.



Still, for those hours, I wasn’t 42. I was timeless. I was the architect of wonder, the storyteller, the kid who never really left—just got buried under bills, deadlines, and grown-up distractions.



And maybe that’s the real magic of LEGO. Not just the bricks, but the bridge they build between who we were and who we still are, deep down.

1lwk0ql,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lwk0ql/night_shift_at_the_evergrove_market_day_1/,Night shift at the Evergrove Market - Day 1,"My first shift at the Evergroove Market started with a paper sign:

""HIRING!! Night Shift Needed – Evergrove Market""

The sign slapped against the glass door in the wind—bold, blocky letters that caught my eye mid-jog. I wasn’t out for exercise. I was trying to outrun the weight pressing on my chest: overdue rent, climbing student loans, and the hollow thud of every “We regret to inform you” that kept piling into my inbox.

I had a degree. Engineering, no less. Supposed to be a golden ticket. Instead, it bought me rejection emails and a gnawing sense of failure.

But what stopped me cold was the pay: $55 per hour.

I blinked, wondering if I’d read it wrong. No experience required. Night shift. Immediate start.

It sounded too good to be true—which usually meant it was. But I stood there, heart racing, rereading it like the words might disappear if I looked away. My bank account had dipped below zero three days ago. I’d been living on canned soup and pride.

I looked down at the bottom of the flyer and read the address aloud under my breath:

3921 Old Pine Road, California.

I sighed. New town, no family, no friends—just me, chasing some kind of fresh start in a place that didn’t know my name. It wasn’t ideal. But it was something. A flicker of hope. A paycheck.

By 10 p.m., I was there.

The store wasn’t anything spectacular. In fact, it was a lot smaller than I’d imagined.

“I don’t know why I thought this would be, like, a giant Walmart,” I muttered to myself, taking in the dim, flickering sign saying “Evergroove” and the eerie silence around me. There were no other shops in sight—just a lone building squatting on the side of a near-empty highway, swallowed by darkness on all sides.

It felt more like a rest stop for ghosts than a convenience store.

But I stepped forward anyway. As a woman, I knew the risk of walking into sketchy places alone. Every instinct told me to turn around. But when you’re desperate, even the strangest places can start to look like second chances.

The bell above the door gave a hollow jingle as I walked in. The store was dimly lit, aisles stretching ahead like crooked teeth in a too-wide grin. The reception counter was empty and the cold hit me like a slap.

Freezing.

Why was it so cold in the middle of July?

I rubbed my arms, breath fogging slightly as I looked around. That’s when I heard the soft shuffle of footsteps, followed by a creak.

Someone stepped out from the furthest aisle, his presence sudden and uncanny. A grizzled man with deep lines etched into his face like cracked leather.

“What d’you want?” he grunted, voice gravelly and dry.

“Uh… I saw a sign. Are you guys hiring?”

He stared at me too long. Long enough to make me question if I’d said anything at all.

Then he gave a slow nod and turned his back.

“Follow me,” he said, already turning down the narrow hallway. “Hope you’re not scared of staying alone.”

“I’ve done night shifts before.” I said recalling the call center night shift in high school, then retail during college. I was used to night shifts. They kept me away from home. From shouting matches. From silence I didn’t know how to fill.

The old man moved faster than I expected, his steps brisk and sure, like he didn’t have time to waste.

“This isn’t your average night shift,” he muttered, glancing back at me with a look I couldn’t quite read. Like he was sizing me up… or reconsidering something.

We reached a cramped employee office tucked behind a heavy door. He rummaged through a drawer, pulled out a clipboard, and slapped a yellowed form onto the desk.

“Fill this out,” he said, sliding the clipboard toward me. “If you’re good to start, the shift begins tonight.”

He paused—just long enough that I wondered if he was waiting for me to back out. But I didn’t.

I picked up the pen and skimmed the contract, the paper cold and stiff beneath my fingers. One line snagged my attention like a fishhook, Minimum term: One year. No early termination.

Maybe they didn’t want employees quitting after making a decent paycheck. Still, something about it felt off.

My rent and student loans weighed heavily on my mind. Beggars can’t be choosers and I would need at least six months of steady work just to get a handle on my debts.

But the moment my pen hit the paper, I felt it. A chill—not from the air, but from the room.

Like the store itself was watching me.

The old man didn’t smile or nod welcomingly—just gave me a slow, unreadable nod. Without a word, he took the form and slid it into a filing cabinet that looked like it hadn’t been opened in decades.

“You’ll be alone most of the time,” he said, locking the drawer with a sharp click. “Stock shelves. Watch the front if anyone shows up. The cameras are old, but they work. And read this.”

He handed me a laminated sheet of yellow paper. The title read: Standard Protocols.

I unfolded the sheet carefully, the plastic sticky against my fingers. The list was typed in faded black letters:

*Standard Protocols*

**1) Never enter the basement.**

**2) If you hear footsteps or whispers after midnight, do not respond or investigate.**

**3) Keep all exterior doors except the front door locked at all times—no exceptions.**

**4) Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

**5) If the lights flicker more than twice in a minute, stop all work immediately and hide until 1 a.m.**

**6) Do not exit the premises during your scheduled shift unless explicitly authorized.**

**7) Do not use your phone to call anyone inside the store—signals get scrambled.**

**8) If you feel watched, do not turn around or run. Walk calmly to the main office and lock the door until you hear footsteps walk away.**

**9) Under no circumstances touch the old cash register drawer at the front counter.**

**10) If the emergency alarm sounds, cease all tasks immediately and remain still. Do not speak. Do not move until the sound stops. And ignore the voice that speaks.**

I swallowed hard, eyes flicking back up to the old man.

“Serious business,” I said, sarcasm creeping into my voice. “What is this, a hazing ritual?”

He didn’t laugh. Didn’t even blink.

“If you want to live,” he said quietly, locking eyes with me, “then follow the rules.”

With that, he turned and left the office, glancing at his watch. “Your shift starts at 11 and ends at 6. Uniform’s in the back,” he added casually, as if he hadn’t just threatened my life.

I stood alone in the cold, empty store, the silence pressing down on me. The clock on the wall ticked loudly—10:30 p.m. Only thirty minutes until I had to fully commit to whatever this place was.

I headed toward the back room, the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. The narrow hallway smelled faintly of old wood and something metallic I couldn’t place. When I found the uniform hanging on a rusty hook, I was relieved to see a thick jacket along with the usual store polo and pants.

Slipping into the jacket, I felt a small spark of comfort—like armor against the unknown. But the uneasy feeling didn’t leave. The protocols, the warning, the way the old man looked at me... none of it added up to a normal night shift.

I checked the clock again—10:50 p.m.

Time to face the night.

The first hour passed quietly. Just me, the distant hum of the overhead lights, and the occasional whoosh of cars speeding down the highway outside—none of them stopping. They never did. Not here.

I stocked shelves like I was supposed to. The aisles were narrow and dim, and the inventory was… strange. Too much of one thing, not enough of another. A dozen rows of canned green beans—but barely any bread. No milk. No snacks. No delivery crates in the back, no expiration dates on the labels.

It was like the stock just appeared.

And just as I was placing the last can on the shelf, the lights flickered once.

I paused. Waited. They flickered again.

Then—silence. That kind of thick silence that makes your skin itch.

And within that minute, the third flicker came.

This one lasted longer.

Too long.

The lights buzzed, stuttered, and dipped into full darkness for a breath… then blinked back to life—dim, as if even the store itself was tired. Or… resisting something.

I stood still. Frozen.

I didn’t know what I was waiting for—until I heard it.

A footstep. Just one. Then another. Slow. Heavy. Steady.

They weren’t coming fast, but they were coming.

Closer.

Whoever—or whatever—it was, it wasn’t in a rush. And it wasn’t trying to be quiet either.

My fingers had gone numb around the cart handle.

Rule Five.

**If the lights flicker more than twice in a minute, stop all work immediately and hide until 1 a.m.**

My heartbeat climbed into my throat. I let go of the cart and began backing away, moving as quietly as I could across the scuffed tile.

The aisles around me seemed to shift, shelves towering like skeletons under those flickering lights. Their shadows twisted across the floor, long and jagged, like they could reach out and pull me in.

My eyes searched the store. I needed to hide. Fast.

That’s when the footsteps—once slow and deliberate—broke into a full sprint.

Whatever it was, it had stopped pretending.

I didn’t think. I just ran, heart hammering against my ribs, breath sharp in my throat as I tore down the aisle, desperate for someplace—anyplace—to hide.

The employee office. The door near the stockroom. I remembered it from earlier.

The footsteps were right behind me now—pounding, frantic, inhumanly fast.

I reached the door just as the lights cut out completely.

Pitch black.

I slammed into the wall, palms scraping across rough plaster as I fumbled for the doorknob. 5 full seconds. That’s how long I was blind, vulnerable, exposed—my fingers clawing in the dark while whatever was chasing me gained ground.

I slipped inside the office, slammed the door shut, and turned the lock with a soft, deliberate click.

Darkness swallowed the room.

I didn’t dare turn on my phone’s light. Instead, I crouched low, pressing my back flat against the cold wall, every breath shaking in my chest. My heart thundered like a drumbeat in a silent theater.

I had no idea what time it was. No clue how long I’d have to stay hidden. I didn’t even know what was waiting out there in the dark.

I stayed there, frozen in the dark, listening.

At first, every creak made my chest seize. Every whisper of wind outside the walls sounded like breathing. But after a while... the silence settled.

And somewhere in that suffocating quiet, sleep crept in.

I must’ve dozed off—just for a moment.

Because I woke with a jolt as the overhead lights buzzed and flickered back on, casting a pale glow on the office floor.

I blinked hard, disoriented, then fumbled for my phone.

1:15 a.m.

“Damn it,” I muttered, voice hoarse and cracked.

Whatever the hell was going on in this store… I didn’t want any part of it.

But my train of thought was cut short by a soft ding from the front counter.

The bell.

The reception bell.

“Is anyone there?”

A woman’s voice—gentle, but firm. Too calm for this hour.

I froze, every instinct screaming for me to stay put.

But Rule Four whispered in the back of my mind:

**Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

But it wasn’t 2 a.m. yet. So, against every ounce of better judgment, I pushed myself to my feet, knees stiff, back aching, and slowly crept toward the register.

And that’s when I saw her.

She stood perfectly still at the counter, hands folded neatly in front of her.

Pale as frost. Skin like cracked porcelain pulled from the freezer.

Her hair spilled down in heavy, straight strands—gray and black, striped like static on an old analog screen.

She wore a long, dark coat. Perfectly still. Perfectly pressed.

And she was smiling.

Polite. Measured. Almost mechanical.

But her eyes didn’t smile.

They just stared.

Something about her felt… wrong.

Not in the way people can be strange. In the way things pretend to be people.

She looked human.

Almost.

“Can I help you?” I asked, my voice shakier than I wanted it to be.

Part of me was hoping she wouldn’t answer.

Her smile twitched—just a little.

Too sharp. Too rehearsed.

“Yes,” she said.

The word hung in the air, cold and smooth, like it had been repeated to a mirror one too many times.

“I’m looking for something.”

I hesitated. “What… kind of something?”

She tilted her head—slowly, mechanically—like she wasn’t used to the weight of it.

“Do you guys have meat?” she asked.

The word hit harder than it should’ve.

Meat.

My blood ran cold. “Meat?,” I stammered. My voice thinned with each word.

She didn’t move. Didn’t blink.

Just stared.

“Didn’t you get a new shipment tonight?” she asked. Still calm. Still smiling.

And that’s when it hit me.

I had stocked meat tonight. Not in the aisle—but in the freezer in the back room. Two vacuum-sealed packs. No label. No origin. Just sitting there when I opened the store’s delivery crate…Two silent, shrink-wrapped slabs of something.

And that was all the meat in the entire store.

Just those two.

“Yes,” I said, barely louder than a whisper. “You can find it in the back…in the frozen section.”

She looked at me.

Not for a second. Not for ten.

But for two full minutes.

She didn’t move.

Didn’t blink.

Just stood there, that same polite smile frozen across a face that didn’t breathe… couldn’t breathe.

And then she said it.

“Thank you, Remi.”

My stomach dropped.

I never told her my name and my uniform didn't even have a nameplate.

But before I could react, she turned—slow, mechanical—and began walking down the back hallway.

That’s when I saw them.

Her feet.

They weren’t aligned with her body—angled just slightly toward the entrance, like she’d walked in backward… and never fixed it.

As she walked away—those misaligned feet shuffling against the linoleum—I stayed frozen behind the counter, eyes locked on her until she disappeared into the back hallway.

Silence returned, thick and heavy.

I waited. One second. Then ten. Then a full minute.

No sound. No footsteps. No freezer door opening.

Just silence.

I should’ve stayed behind the counter. I knew I should have. But something pulled at me. Curiosity. Stupidity. A need to know if those meat packs were even still there.

So I moved.

I moved down the hallway, one cautious step at a time.

The overhead lights buzzed softly—no flickering, just a steady, dull hum. Dimmer than before. Almost like they didn’t want to witness what was ahead.

The back room door stood open.

I hesitated at the threshold, heart hammering in my chest. The freezer was closed. Exactly how I’d left it. But she was gone. No trace of her. No footprints. No sound. Then I noticed it—one of the meat packets was missing. My stomach turned. And that’s when I heard it.

Ding. The soft chime of the front door bell. I bolted back toward the front, sneakers slipping on the tile. By the time I reached the counter, the door was already swinging shut with a gentle click. Outside? Empty parking lot. Inside? No one.

She was gone.

And I collapsed.

My knees gave out beneath me as panic took over, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might tear through my chest. My breath came in short gasps. Every instinct screamed Run, escape—get out.

But then I remembered Rule Six:

**Do not exit the premises during your scheduled shift unless explicitly authorized.**

I stared at the front door like it might bite me.

I couldn’t leave.

I was trapped.

My hands were trembling. I needed to regroup—breathe, think. I stumbled to the employee restroom and splashed cold water on my face, hoping it would shock my mind back into something resembling calm.

And that’s when I saw it.

In the mirror—wedged between the glass and the frame—was a folded piece of paper. Just barely sticking out.

I pulled it free and opened it.

Four words. Bold, smeared, urgent:

DONT ACCEPT THE PROMOTION.

“What the hell…” I whispered.

I stepped out of the bathroom in a daze, the note still clutched in my hand, and made my way back to the stockroom, trying to focus on something normal. Sorting. Stacking. Anything to distract myself from whatever this was.

That’s when I saw it.

A stairwell.

Half-hidden behind a row of unmarked boxes—steps leading down. The hallway at the bottom stretched into a wide, dark tunnel that ended at a heavy iron door.

I felt my stomach twist.

The basement.

The one from Rule One:

**Never enter the basement.**

I shouldn’t have even looked. But I did. I peeked at the closed door.

And that’s when I heard it.

A voice. Muffled, desperate.

“Let me out…”

Bang.

“Please!” another voice cried, pounding the door from the other side.

Then another. And another.

A rising chorus of fists and pleas. The sound of multiple people screaming—screaming like their souls were on fire. Bloodcurdling, ragged, animalistic.

I turned and ran.

Bolted across the store, sprinting in the opposite direction, away from the basement, away from those voices. The farther I got, the quieter it became.

By the time I reached the far side of the store, it was silent again.

As if no one had ever spoken. As if no one had screamed. As if that door at the bottom of the stairs didn’t exist.

Then the bell at the reception desk rang.

Ding.

I froze.

Rule Four punched through my fog of fear:

**Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

I slowly turned toward the clock hanging at the center of the store.

2:35 a.m.

Shit.

The bell rang again—harder this time. More impatient. I was directly across the store, hidden behind an aisle, far from the counter.

I crouched low and peeked through a gap between shelves.

And what I saw chilled me to the bone.

It wasn’t a person.

It was a creature—crouched on all fours, nearly six feet tall and hunched. Its skin was hairless, stretched and raw like sun-scorched flesh. Its limbs were too long. Its fingers curled around the edge of the counter like claws.

And its face…

It had no eyes.

Just a gaping, unhinged jaw—so wide I couldn’t tell if it was screaming or simply unable to close.

It turned its head in my direction.

It didn’t need eyes to know.

Then—

The alarm went off.

Rule Ten echoed in my head like a warning bell:

**If the emergency alarm sounds, cease all tasks immediately and remain still. Do not speak. Do not move until the sound stops. And ignore the voice that speaks.**

The sirens wailed through the store—shrill and disorienting. I froze, forcing every muscle in my body to go still. I didn’t even dare to blink.

And then, beneath the screech of the alarm, came the voice.

Low and Crooked. Not human.

“Remi… in Aisle 6… report to the reception.”

The voice repeated it again, warped and mechanical like it was being dragged through static.

“Remi in Aisle 6… come to the desk.”

I didn’t move.

Didn’t breathe.

But my eyes—my traitorous eyes—drifted upward. And what I saw made my stomach drop through the floor.

Aisle 6.

I was in Aisle 6.

The second I realized it, I heard it move.

The thing near the desk snapped its head and launched forward—charging down the store like it had been waiting for this cue. I didn’t wait. I didn't think. Just thought, “Screw this,” and ran.

The sirens only got louder. Harsher. Shadows started slithering out from between shelves, writhing like smoke with claws—reaching, grasping.

Every step I took felt like outrunning death itself.

The creature was behind me now, fast and wild, crashing through displays, howling without a mouth that ever closed. The shadows weren’t far behind—hungry, screaming through the noise.

I turned sharply toward the back hallway, toward the only place left: the stairwell.

I shoved the basement door open and slipped behind it at the last second, flattening myself behind the frame just as the creature skidded through.

It didn’t see me.

It didn’t even hesitate.

It charged down the stairs, dragging the shadows with it into the dark.

I slammed the door shut and twisted the handle.

Click.

It auto-locked. Thank God.

The pounding began immediately.

Fists—or claws—beating against the other side. Screams—inhuman, layered, dozens of voices all at once—rose from beneath the floor like a chorus of the damned.

I collapsed beside the door, chest heaving, soaked in sweat. Every nerve in my body was fried, my thoughts scrambled and spinning.

I sat there for what felt like forever—maybe an hour, maybe more—while the screams continued, until they faded into silence.

Eventually, I dragged myself to the breakroom.

No sirens. No voices. Just the hum of the fridge and the buzz of old lights.

I made myself coffee with shaking hands, not because I needed it—because I didn’t know what else to do.

I stared at the cup like it might offer answers to questions I was too tired—and too scared—to ask.

All I could think was:

God, I hope I never come back.

But even as the thought passed through me, I knew it was a lie.

The contract said one year.

One full year of this madness.

And there was no getting out.

By the time 6 a.m. rolled around, the store had returned to its usual, suffocating quiet—like nothing had ever happened.

Then the bell above the front door jingled.

The old man walked in.

He paused when he saw me sitting in the breakroom. Alive.

“You’re still here?” he asked, genuinely surprised.

I looked up, dead-eyed. “No shit, Sherlock.”

He let out a low chuckle, almost impressed. “Told you it wasn’t your average night shift. But I think this is the first time a newbie has actually made it through the first night.”

“Not an average night shift doesn’t mean you die on the clock, old man,” I muttered.

He brushed off the criticism with a shrug. “You followed the rules. That’s the only reason you’re still breathing.”

I swallowed hard, my voice barely steady. “Can I quit?”

His eyes didn’t even flicker. “Nope. The contract says one year.”

I already knew that but it still stung hearing it out loud.

“But,” he added, casually, “there’s a way out.”

I looked up slowly, wary.

“You can leave early,” he said, “if you get promoted.”

That word stopped me cold.

DON’T ACCEPT THE PROMOTION.

The note in the bathroom flashed through my mind like a warning shot.

“Promotion?” I asked, carefully measuring the word.

“Not many make it that far,” he said, matter-of-fact. No emotion. No concern. Like he was stating the weather.

I didn’t respond. Just stared.

He slid an envelope across the table.

Inside: my paycheck.

$500.

For one night of surviving hell.

“You earned it,” he said, standing. “Uniform rack’ll have your size ready by tonight. See you at eleven.”

Then he walked out. Calm. Routine. Like we’d just finished another late shift at a grocery store.

But nothing about this job was normal.

And if “not many make it to the promotion,” that could only mean one thing.

Most don’t make it at all.

I pocketed the check and stepped out into the pale morning light.

The parking lot was still. Too still.

I walked to my car, every step echoing louder than it should’ve. I slid into the driver’s seat, hands gripping the wheel—knuckles white.

I sat there for a long time, engine off, staring at the rising sun.

Thinking.

Wondering if I’d be stupid enough to come back tomorrow.

And knowing, deep down…

My brother had hated me for seven years.

The last time we argued, I stormed out during a downpour, furious and reckless. I ended up falling into a river, and when I woke up, my memory was a mess.

At the hospital, he looked relieved—like a weight had finally been lifted. He pointed casually at a terminally ill patient and said, ""That's your real brother.

""Get it straight. Don't bother me again.""

The pale-faced man walked over, gently stroked my head, and said softly, ""Come on, I'll take you home.""

After that, I went to great lengths to save this so-called ""brother."" I braved a snowstorm to find a specialist, stayed up countless nights to watch over him.

I even risked my own life for him.

Then, one day, my real brother stood in the freezing snow and blocked my path, his voice shaking in panic.

""You really… don't remember me?""

The doctors had warned of memory confusion. I'd just woken up in the hospital.

Falling from such a height into the river had given me a severe concussion. I'd been in a coma for over two weeks.

Two weeks ago, I had a huge fight with my brother, Charley Lyons.

Right before slamming the door behind me, I shouted, ""I'd rather die than have you clean up after me!""

His face twisted in fury, and behind me I heard his cold, mocking laugh.

""Then I hope you get your wish.""

But now, two weeks had passed—and I was still alive.

When I opened my eyes, the soft winter sunlight streamed through the hospital window.

It took a while for my vision to clear, and then I started to hear things.

Outside the room, I could make out the voices of the doctor and Charley.

""Trauma to the head, extended coma—

""memory loss or confusion is very likely,"" the doctor said.

""It's not just about forgetting friends and family. In some cases, they forget who they are entirely…""

I forced myself out of bed, wanting to explain that my memory was fine.

I hated hospitals.

I didn't want this diagnosis to become another reason to keep me trapped here.

Just as I reached the door, I heard Charley's low voice.

There was something in it—cold, yes, but also strangely pleased.

""This might actually be for the best,"" he said.

As if trying to prove the doctor's point, he added, ""She woke up briefly last night, looked at me, and asked who I was.""

He wasn't lying. I vaguely remembered that moment.

But I'd only asked because I wasn't fully conscious, and everything had been a blur—I couldn't even make out his face.

My hand froze on the doorknob.

The doctor tried to offer reassurance.

""There's no need to jump to conclusions. We'll know more once your sister wakes up.

""And even if there is memory loss, we can work on recovery…""

But Charley cut him off.

""No. It's better if she forgets. Don't try to bring it back.""

I could even hear the trace of joy he didn't bother to hide.

So that's what he really wanted? For me to forget him?

After everything… after all the fights since Mom and Dad passed… he's the only family I have left.

There were times I thought about ending everything.

There were times I thought about ending everything.

But now that I'd survived, I just wanted one more chance to talk to him.

I pulled open the door.

Our eyes met—his filled with surprise, then quickly turning cold and distant.

I'd been unconscious too long.

When I spoke, my voice was hoarse, ""I actually…""

Charley's brows knit together, disbelief flashing across his face.

But then, almost like trying to convince himself, he made up his mind.

He assumed I was confused—mistaking someone else for him.

In the hallway, people came and went, oblivious.

It was like he couldn't wait to get rid of me. Without even looking, Charley reached out, pointed randomly at a patient walking by, and said, ""That's your brother.""

For a moment, I thought I must have misheard him.

I stared at him, stunned. ""What?""

Something flickered in his eyes—hesitation, maybe even guilt—but it vanished almost instantly.

We'd been siblings for over twenty years.

No matter how much he hated or resented me, I couldn't believe he'd push me toward a total stranger while I was still bruised, broken, and barely back on my feet.

Right then, I thought—maybe we really needed to talk. Really talk.

I opened my mouth, ready to put the bitterness behind me.

But he cut in again, his tone sharp and final, ""I said, that's your brother.

""Don't call the wrong person again. And stop coming to me.""

This time, he'd made up his mind.

When he motioned again to the man who had stopped nearby, his face showed no trace of doubt—just cold determination.

The doctor had already slipped away, probably not wanting to get involved.

People flowed through the hallway, slowing down to glance at me—curious, uncomfortable.

To them, I probably looked like a girl who'd gone off the deep end after nearly drowning—so out of it I couldn't even recognize my own brother.

The man Charley pointed to stood quietly across the hall, leaning against the wall.

Tall, well-built, with striking features—but pale. Deathly pale.

Anyone else would've been angry to be dragged into something like this.

But he wasn't. He simply looked at Charley, then at me. Calm. Silent.

Like he was waiting to see what would happen next.

Charley spoke again, voice colder than ever, ""I'm just a friend of your brother's. I came to check in out of politeness.

""If you want to talk to him, go find him yourself. Whether he accepts you or not—that's up to you two.""

And with that, he turned and walked down the hall, never looking back.

My hand, hanging at my side, started to tremble.

I kept telling myself—it's fine. He's hated me for years. This shouldn't be a surprise.

So what if I lost a brother who never wanted me? It's not like we ever really got along anyway.

But my eyes still burned, and I couldn't stop the tears from rising.

Shock. Shame. Anger. Frustration.

The emotions crashed into each other until I couldn't even form a single word.

I watched him walk away, the world tilting slightly as I grabbed the doorframe to steady myself.

A loud ringing filled my ears. For a long time, I couldn't pull myself back together.

Then, the man who had been silently watching finally moved.

He let go of the wall and slowly walked toward me.

For a second, I thought he might come over and scold me—accuse me of faking, of making a scene.

Now that Charley had left, I was the only one left to blame.

I instinctively tried to take a step back.

But maybe I'd been in bed too long. Maybe my emotions had drained every last bit of strength.

My body didn't move.

Then, before I could even process what was happening—

A hand gently landed on my head.

At first, it felt almost like a scolding tap—but there was no force behind it.

Just a soft, almost tentative touch. A pat.

It was a long moment before he finally spoke.

His voice was tired, but gentle. ""Come on. Let's go. I'll take you home.""

How many years had it been since Charley last called himself my brother?

Too long. So long I'd forgotten what it felt like.

I looked up at him, dazed.

We'd been fighting for years.

Ever since our parents died.

Maybe I really had gone crazy.

Because I stared at this complete stranger—a man I'd never seen before in my life—and still, I nodded.

""Okay.""

# Chapter 2

I followed a stranger back to a home I'd never seen before.

The place was spotless—so clean, it felt cold. Lifeless.

Not a speck of dust anywhere. No signs of anyone actually living there.

It reminded me of him—his pale, expressionless face. Too still. Too quiet.

Years ago, a place like this might've scared me. But now, life or death didn't matter much to me anymore. There was nothing left that I'm afraid of.

I glanced around the room. On the coffee table were several small white pill bottles. I recognized them instantly—they were the same kind I'd once tried to collect.

But doctors were always cautious.

No matter what excuse I gave—stress, insomnia, anxiety—they never gave me more than a few at a time.

I'd spent six months saving them up and still barely managed to get a dozen.

Now, looking at all those full bottles, I almost laughed.

And surprisingly, I felt a flicker of envy.

That many pills… more than enough to die.

Next to the bottles sat a photo.

It was strange—black and white, about a foot wide.

The man in the picture looked straight into the camera. Calm. Blank. Completely emotionless.

It stood out so much I couldn't help but stare.

Then I glanced at the man standing beside me—his face practically a mirror of the one in the photo. Same expression. Same stillness.

Even after he saw me notice the pills and the photo, his face didn't change.

Without a word, he calmly walked over, gathered them up, and tucked everything into a drawer.

Then he turned to me and said gently, ""Sit down. I'll make you something to eat.""

So he really believed it. He thought my head was so messed up I couldn't even recognize my own brother.

That thought pulled me back to reality.

Lying to someone already standing on the edge—it didn't sit right with me.

I wanted to tell him the truth. Then leave.

But the image of that photo, those pills… they stayed with me.

And suddenly, I was curious. What had he been through that pushed him so close to the edge? Just like me?

Where did he even get that many pills?

Before I knew it, I'd sat down.

He went into the kitchen. Said he was going to cook. But for a long time, I didn't hear a thing.

I got up and walked to the kitchen door.

He was standing there, staring blankly into the open fridge.

It was as empty as the rest of the apartment.

Not a single ingredient. Not even a bottle of water.

Clearly, no one had cooked here in a long time.

The stovetop was bare—no pots or pans, just a single ceramic jar. The kind used for boiling medicine.

He stood there for a while before finally snapping out of it.

He shut the fridge and turned to look at me.

His voice was soft, almost apologetic. ""Sorry. I forgot to buy groceries. I'll go out and get something.""

Over the years, I'd looked at myself in the mirror and thought, I'm alive, but I don't feel it. Like I've become some hollow soul, floating outside my own body.

But standing there in that kitchen, I realized—

There was someone else out there who looked even more like the dead than I did.

He walked past me and headed toward the door.

And I realized—I couldn't hear his footsteps. Couldn't even hear him breathe.

It suddenly occurred to me—maybe this stranger, someone I'd just met today, wasn't planning on coming back.

Just like that night… after my fight with Charley. When I fell into the river.

Charley and the doctors had both insisted it was an accident—that the rain was too heavy, the bridge too slick.

That I'd slipped.

But I knew better.

He was already at the entryway, hand on the door, just about to step out.

I looked at his back and said, without thinking, ""I like fish.""

He froze.

Stiffened slightly, then slowly turned to face me.

His expression unchanged—calm, pale, unreadable. ""What?"" he asked.

I met his gaze and repeated, ""I said, I want fish.

""For dinner. Can you make that for me?""

The front door was still ajar.

Cold wind blew in—late autumn, almost winter.

It rushed through the apartment, tugging at the hem of his coat and messing up his already disheveled hair.

Against the wind, his face looked even more bloodless. Almost ghost-like.

His fingers, hanging by his side, gave the slightest twitch.

After a long pause, he nodded. ""Okay.""

I watched him walk out. The door clicked shut behind him.

Maybe—just maybe—he'd actually come back.

The thought made me laugh at myself.

I was someone who'd been ready to end it all.

And yet here I was… worrying about whether a stranger might not return.

I sank back into the couch and closed my eyes. The same images came rushing back.

My parents—who should've been alive and well—crushed beneath the rubble.

And me, pulled out alive, surviving by stepping over the lives of the two people who loved me most.

The scene shifted—Charley's face filled with rage, his voice sharp and bitter.

""Erma, you're the one who should've died. That would've been justice.""

""After all these years, do you really sleep with a clear conscience?""

No. I didn't.

That was why I hadn't had a single night of real rest in years.

I slipped into a nightmare again—and it took a while to drag myself back out.

When I opened my eyes, they landed on the closed drawer beneath the coffee table.

My hand moved before I could think. I slid the drawer open, reached inside, and pulled out the pill bottles.

I'd never stolen anything in my life. The moment my fingers closed around one of them, my palms were instantly damp with sweat.

But I'd done my homework. I knew the dosage.

If I took half and left the rest for him—well, that'd be enough for both of us to disappear.

My thoughts were hazy. I told myself this was reasonable. Fair.

My fingers trembled as I unscrewed the cap of the first bottle.

Then, out of nowhere, the phone on the coffee table rang.

The sound tore through the silence like a gunshot.

I jumped, nearly dropping the bottle.

My heart thudded.

Guiltily, I set the pills down and grabbed the phone.

I hit ""Answer"" before realizing—it wasn't mine.

He must've forgotten it when he left.

The call connected.

And immediately, a furious voice exploded through the line.

""Listen to me, Nolan—over 200 million dollars! You really think you can walk away without giving me a dime? Not a chance!

""I might not have raised you, but I sure as hell gave birth to you!

""That little sister of yours died for you—and as your father, I have every right to inherit from a dying son!

""Donate it all? Keep dreaming!""

# Chapter 3

I hadn't meant to listen in on someone's private conversation.

But the voice on the other end of the line had been so loud, so agitated, and so fast that by the time I snapped out of it and hurried to hang up, I'd already heard more than I should have.

A slip of paper had fallen onto the carpet.

It must've come out when I'd fumbled with the drawer earlier, grabbing the pill bottles.

It was a diagnosis report—late-stage heart failure. The patient's name: Nolan Diaz.

The name struck a chord. It was the same one the man on the phone had been shouting about.

I thought for a moment before it came to me—something I'd seen trending not long ago.

Nolan, founder and CEO of Nolan Tech, had suddenly announced plans to sell the company, even though it was booming.

The timing made no sense. Selling now would mean taking a loss.

I remembered the news coverage—reporters swarming him, and him standing there with that same expression he wore now: calm, vacant, lifeless.

He'd said only one thing, ""I'm tired. I just want to rest.""

So it was him.

And the reason he wanted to die… was because he was dying.

Funny, how life worked.

Some people were perfectly healthy and still wanted to die. Others, even with everything going for them, got hit with a terminal diagnosis.

I picked up the paper carefully and tucked it back into the drawer with the pill bottles.

Stealing medication from someone with a terminal illness…

Even if I made it to hell, I'd probably still get spat on by the devil himself.

Outside, dusk was falling, and rain had started to fall in steady sheets.

It beat against the floor-to-ceiling windows, tapping louder and harder as the last traces of daylight disappeared.

Still no sign of him at the door.

He… didn't actually die out there, did he?

I sighed.

After a moment of internal debate, I stood up and stepped outside.

His car was still in the front yard. He must've left on foot.

And without his phone, he wouldn't have been able to call a ride—not until he got out of the neighborhood, anyway.

Maybe he hadn't gone far.

I grabbed an umbrella and headed out, walking through the rain and past the gates of the villa complex.

Then I hailed a cab and asked the driver to take me to the nearest mall.

Honestly, I doubted he was really out buying fish this late.

But I still wanted to look for him.

It was cold, and the mall was quieter than usual. Fewer people than normal.

I checked each floor, scanning every aisle, but didn't see him anywhere.

Just as I was about to give up and try a different mall—

A sharp, cold voice sounded behind me, ""Who told you to follow me here?""

Charley.

I turned around. He was standing not far away, face tight with irritation, staring straight at me.

Standing next to Charley was Elsie Palmer, the daughter of a CEO he'd recently partnered with on a big project.

He'd gone to close a business deal and conveniently picked up a new ""goddaughter"" along the way.

The CEO praised him endlessly—called him warm, generous, kind-hearted. But only I knew the truth. He'd never been the warm-hearted type.

He just didn't like me, his real sister.

It felt like my heart had been dropped in ice water—heavy, aching, and tight.

I'd spent years trying to get used to it.

The brother who used to dote on me, protect me, give in to my every whim...

Had turned into someone who couldn't look at me without disgust. Every word he spoke was sharp, cold, and full of contempt.

And yet, no matter how much time passed, I could never truly get used to it. Never really stop caring.

It took me a moment to push the feelings down.

I tightened my grip on the umbrella, forced myself to meet his eyes, and said as calmly as I could, ""I wasn't following you. I… came to find someone.""

His eyes darkened, voice full of suspicion and anger. ""You've never once come to this part of town.

""If you weren't tailing me, who else would you be looking for?""

Just as he said that, I spotted a familiar figure behind him.

I couldn't clearly remember Nolan's face. It was still a blur in my mind.

But a face that pale, that still, that dead-looking—there couldn't be another one like it.

He was standing at a distance. Not close, but not far either.

He didn't move forward. Just stood there, watching me.

Like he preferred it this way—keeping some space, quietly observing.

Charley frowned when I didn't respond and snapped again, ""I'm talking to you.

""Stop creeping around and following me. I'm not your brother. Get that through your head.""

Nolan stood there holding a plastic bag.

Through the clear plastic, I could see a cleaned, freshly prepared fish inside.

He'd actually bought it. After being gone for over three hours, he really came back—with the fish.

And just like that, a memory surfaced—uninvited.

Years ago, I'd thrown a fit late one night, begging Charley for cake from that bakery on the far side of town.

He'd scolded me, said eating sweets that late would rot my teeth.

Plus, it was way past closing time.

I sulked and went to bed angry. But in the middle of the night, he came back, cold all over, sneaking into my room so our parents wouldn't wake up.

He pulled the cake out from inside his coat—it was still warm.

And with a stern face, he told me, ""This is the last time.""

But somehow… there was always another ""last time.""

I snapped back to reality and looked at the fish again.

Then, unexpectedly, I let out a quiet laugh.

Charley stared at me like he'd just seen a ghost.

He followed my gaze, and when he turned to see Nolan standing there, his face twisted in shock and anger.

""Why the hell is that guy still here?""

I finally pulled my eyes away from the fish and gave him my answer.

""I didn't come for you. I came to find my brother.""",1,1752171414.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

she filmed a lot of get ready with me in the morning content on youtube short and instagram reels, she was always in a white robe and would be drinking an iced coffee or diet coke while she got ready in her bathroom. she very much had the clean girl/minimal aesthetic and was kinda sassy? lol like she deadpanned at the camera a lot and in some of her what i eat in a day videos she would flick bottle caps or lids off of things instead of just taking them off normally. 

i remember either her youtube or instagram handle said something about her being a fitness instructor or something like that but her content didn't reflect that. 

there was also one vlog she had on her youtube where she talked about her buying a white board to write her goals down on but she never ended up using it cause she got lazy, her long form content on youtube showed a more relatable side to her. ",1,1752171366.0,tipofmytongue,10,0.6,False

1 year old i was spending hours listing fabric weight exact stitching details and color codes felt like I was writing a product spec sheet not a sales page.

Then i came to the realization nobody buys a hoodie because it’s 350gsm cotton blend they buy it because it makes them feel cozy on those chilly morning walks or gives them a confidence boost during weekend coffee runs.

So I rewrote one listing:

Opened with a mini-scene: Imagine your hood up at sunrise, steam curling from your mug as you stroll the park…

Turned 350gsm cotton into snuggly warmth that holds its shape wash after wash.

Highlighted the *feeling* your go to layer for crisp days and crisp style.

Within 48 hours that hoodie went from crickets to two orders 🎉
