1jpn5u0,https://paranormaldergi.com/en/because-grandfathers-sin-paranormal-story/,Because Of My Grandfather's Sin,"As night blended into day, the women of the Kahraman family had prepared the dinner table and were waiting for the men to arrive. Gülşah called out to her daughter Esma, warning her to come join them now, but it was impossible for Esma to hear her mother at that moment. Due to the severe seizure (‘sara krizi’) she was having, she was trembling violently on the floor, praying to God for someone to see her and help. It felt as if an invisible hand had grasped her heart in its palms, squeezing until her last strength was gone.

“Oh God, help me, please someone see me! I can’t take it anymore…” As she prayed these words inwardly, the seizure intensified, and saliva drooling from her mouth continued to flow down towards her throat. From what she had heard on television, if she could turn onto her side, she might have a chance of recovery, but some force prevented her from doing so. “I can’t breathe, God, help me, please!” Her body had now entered a rhythmic tremor. Esma’s vision blurred, everything around her becoming hazy.

Gülşah Hanım, seeing her daughter hadn’t come, placed the napkin in her hand on the table and started walking towards her daughter’s room, grumbling. “Oh, dear daughter, what would happen if you just came when I called you once? Always doing the opposite of what I say, always!” Reaching Esma’s door, Gülşah Hanım opened it at once and entered. The sight she encountered made her cover her mouth and scream. She immediately rushed to her daughter’s side and knelt down. Taking Esma’s head onto her lap, Gülşah Hanım, amidst tears, gently tapped her daughter’s face to wake her up while also calling out to the men of the house. She knew the men had arrived from the sound of the bell hanging on the garden’s iron gate. “Ali Bey! Mehmet! Run! Esma is lying on the floor, run!”

The men of the house, without understanding what was happening, ran fearfully towards Esma’s room upon hearing the cries. When they reached the room, faced with what they saw through the open door, they were initially unsure what to do. After a few moments, Esma’s older brother, Mehmet, quickly went to Esma’s side, picked her up in his arms, and started running towards the car. As the entire family hastily left the house to go to the hospital, Esma was in a very different world, a terrifying dimension.

Esma was awakened by snow-white flakes falling from the sky onto her face. She rubbed her eyes, trying to understand where she was, but her head hurt so much she couldn’t comprehend anything. “Where am I?” She slowly stood up and looked around. All she could see was that she was on something like a cloud. Noticing the snow falling on her, she looked down at herself and saw she was wearing a dress made of pure white tulle. There were gold embroideries on the belt of the dress. “When did I put this on? Where am I?”

As she walked slowly on the endless cloud masses, she noticed something; despite the falling snow, she didn’t feel cold. She had shouted repeatedly, but received no response from anyone. She walked, and walked, and walked… She herself didn’t know how long she had walked. Her feet had started to ache. Her body was gradually warming up. Wiping the sweat trickling down her forehead, she tried to understand why this was suddenly happening. “Mom! Dad! Brother! Where are you? I’m scared!” Just as she was about to collapse from exhaustion, dark figures suddenly began to appear around her. Some of these figures were tall, some short. Some were fat, some very thin. It was clear they hadn’t taken on a physical form, and their faces were indistinct. “Who are you? Please help me! I beg you, please!”

Ahkeran, the leader of the tribe, felt himself grow stronger witnessing Esma’s terrified state. “Fool! Soon we will make you experience the worst kind of fear! This is nothing yet!” Giving instructions to the demonic entities, Ahkeran ordered Esma to be taken to the place where her end would come. “It is time for vengeance! Seconds, milliseconds, years have passed! Now is the time for blood!” As Ahkeran savored the pleasure of the revenge he would exact, Esma was grabbed by the arm by the unseen entities and began to be dragged towards the place Ahkeran indicated. Esma’s screams and struggles were in vain; no one could hear her voice.

Thrown into a dark dungeon, Esma sat huddled, arms wrapped around her legs, helplessly waiting for what was to come. She didn’t know how many hours she had been there. “Oh God, help me, please…” Just as her tears were about to dry, the entity that suddenly appeared before her made her recoil in fear. “Oh God, protect me from the evil of the wicked, of Satan, of demons, of jinn!” Ahkeran began to approach Esma, cackling. His blood-red eyes, grayish filthy skin, and the insects emerging from his wound-covered body made him appear even more horrifying. “Time for revenge, filthy human! Time for revenge!” Ahkeran grabbed Esma’s hair with his long-nailed hands and began dragging her across the dark dungeon, throwing her from place to place, towards the torture site. In the silent dungeon, only Esma’s screams pleading for help now echoed. Hearing this sound, the demon-souled jinn began to gather, not wanting to miss the feast.

“Get the patient on the stretcher immediately! Inform Dr. Fırat!” As the hospital staff quickly placed Esma on the stretcher and rushed her towards the emergency room, Esma’s body began to suffer just like her soul. Her fever slowly rose, and cold sweat poured from her body. Dr. Fırat, sipping his coffee in his room, quickly got up upon receiving the call on his phone and ran towards the emergency room. When he reached the emergency floor, after getting the necessary information from the nurses, he began the initial treatment for Esma. The countdown for a life to be rekindled had begun…

Ahkeran threw Esma into a cage filled with hot and sharp iron bars and quickly locked the cage door. “Why are you doing this to me? What did I ever do to you?!” As Esma looked at Ahkeran with fear-filled eyes, Ahkeran looked back at Esma with eyes full of hatred and vengeance and began to explain the reason for his revenge. All the jinn gathered around listened to Ahkeran with curiosity: “Exactly 50 years ago, your great-grandfather Hasan got involved in something he never should have. He deceived my entire family and trapped them all one night, killing them! Before my father died, I promised him; I would take the life of the most precious person in the family of the man called Hasan! And that person is you, YOU!”

“Why am I paying the price for the evil my grandfather did? Don’t do this, please!” Ahkeran stared into Esma’s eyes with his blood-red gaze. Grabbing the cage’s chain, he roared with all his might: “O cursed human! I take vengeance on you and your lineage! I will drink every drop of your blood as wine!” Following these words, Ahkeran let out a terrifying laugh, gripped the chain tightly, and began slamming the cage against the ground with all his strength. Although Esma screamed and cried from the pain, it only served to further enrage Ahkeran. Being thrown against the sharp parts inside the cage, Esma’s body was covered in cuts. The deep wounds forming on her body burned every time they touched the hot iron, and the smell of burning flesh filled the entire dungeon. Just as Esma was about to pass out, Ahkeran, wanting her to suffer more, began plunging the cage into the blazing fire and pulling it out repeatedly. “Oh God, help me, please!” As Esma recited her last prayer before losing consciousness, the pain whispered in her ear that death was near. “Let your God come and save you, filthy human! If He has the power, that is!”

Dr. Fırat was utterly frozen by the sight before him. On the stretcher lay Esma, her body covered in massive, deep wounds, and the blood within the wounds was literally boiling like water, bubbling furiously. “Doctor, what are we going to do?” Looking fearfully at Nurse Melek, Dr. Fırat tried to moisten his dry throat with saliva. “I don’t know, Nurse Melek… This is the first time in my life I’ve encountered such savagery!” As Esma burned to ashes from within, various types of insects, non-existent in this world, began to emerge from her wounds, her mouth, her nostrils. As these insects exited Esma’s body, they ate her flesh alive. Nurse Melek screamed and fainted upon seeing the insects. Dr. Fırat, nauseated by the stench, vomited where he stood, after which his vision blackened, and he fainted like Nurse Melek.

As Esma’s body burned fiercely, her soul, unable to bear the pain any longer, prayed for Azrael, the Angel of Death, to come and deliver her from this torment. But she didn’t know that Ahkeran had condemned her soul to this agony for eternity.

Attracted by the smell of burning flesh and dense smoke filling the hospital, staff members rushed into the room. They quickly extinguished Esma’s burning body with fire extinguishers and carried Nurse Melek and Dr. Fırat out of the room to the emergency care.

A day or two later, as Esma’s ashen remains were being buried, her devastated family stood by the grave, waiting for the burial rites to conclude. As the hodja continued reciting the prayer, Esma’s brother cast the first handful of soil onto her. At that very moment, a scream only audible to those in their graves and demonic entities rose up. This scream belonged to Esma.

The Almighty God created jinn and us humans to worship Him. And He separated both realms, forbidding jinn from contacting humans and humans from contacting jinn. If a being from one of these two realms harms another, knowingly or unknowingly, the method of ‘kısasa kısas’ (retribution in kind) is permitted. Therefore, no matter what, do not harm any living being. Otherwise, one day, you will receive retribution for what you have done.",1,1743596336.0,ParanormalHorror,0,1.0,False

I'm working on my first film script and I wonder when to use names in the descriptions and when it's okay to just use pronouns as long as it's obvious who they refer to?

Example, in this scene I'm unsure whether to keep repeating ""THEO this, THEO that"" or ""he does this, then that"". Also, do I always caps all of the names? I've seen people do it only the first time the character arrives but then some other scripts do it every single time.

*... THEO weaves through the crowd, shoulders hunched like he expects an inevitable crash, his hoodie flapping behind him.*

*... A TOURIST rams into him, THEO flashes an automatic smile of an apology.*

*... THEO darts across the road. Tires screech. A cabbie honks at him but THEO doesn't even look back -- just raises a hand in apology like he's swatting a fly.*

*... His wristwatch scream 9.47 AM. THEO slows to a stroll.*

*... At a grubby coffee cart, he slaps down coins. The vendor hands him a cup with a smirk that says LATE AGAIN?*

*Pull back to reveal the MIRAGE & CO. building, a glass monster sucking in ants in suits. THEO takes a breath.*

1jpn19j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jpn19j,"7 Months Post-Op, My journey so far.","I got my surgery on September 2nd. Today marks exactly the 7th month of my journey. When I got measured for my surgery, I came up to 128 kg/282 lbs with a height of 177cm/5 feet 9. My BMI at the time was 40.9, classified as type 3 obesity. Right now, I'm about 85 kg/187 lbs. My BMI is about 27, considered as slightly overweight.

I will tell you about my story in detail, TL;DR: Although it wasn't smooth sailing, I don't regret it one bit.

We humans are oblivious to changes in our body. I think that's because we experience those changes first-hand, gradually. So when you look in the mirror everyday for your entire life, it feels like you have never changed at all. At times like that, it helps to take a step back and look at your previous self. That doesn't always mean it's going to make you feel better, if you are progressing badly, it makes you sad and feel miserable when you look back. I remember to check my pictures from 5-6 months earlier, before I decided for surgery. I thought I looked good in those pictures compared to myself at that time. But same could be said for myself 5-6 months prior. I also thought an earlier version of me was much better than me at that time. That breaks you, makes you feel miserable as you see you have consistently progressed worse.

That all changed when I got my surgery though. I never was someone taking their time to make a decision on anything, which usually ends up with me regretting my decision. I decided to have surgery in just 2 days, and researched the risks etc. for about a week. That was just to ease people around me into my decision though, since I had already accepted everything that comes with this surgery. It ended up being easily one of the two best decisions I had ever made in my life. The other one being dating my girlfriend, which would have probably made this whole journey harder than it was if not for her.

Society doesn't see this surgery as positively as I do. Some think it's a cheat and you are coward for not losing weight in a ""natural"" way. Some think it's risky and they worry about you. That is why I was really afraid to discuss this with my relatives, friends, girlfriend and especially my father. To my surprise, not one of them looked me with the eyes of judgement. They were all supportive, cheering me along my journey. Which is why I consider myself lucky. My loved ones visited me on the day of surgery, both before and after. They helped me walk, watched me puke and crawl in pain. With the help of them, those hard first days passed by quitely and swiftly.

I think the first 2 weeks of the surgery is the hardest physically, and the for a few months after that, hardest for your mental.

Right after surgery, I was in immense pain. This was the first time I was in any kind of surgery so I didn't know what to expect. However, my relatives were prepared as they have backgrounds in medicine and know what to expect. I puked a lot, mainly because of the anesthesia in my system. I had a lot of cramps in my tummy area making me dizzy for 2 days straight. After 2 days, I got sent home and by that point my cramps and puking have all passed. After that, my stitches started to hurt whenever I tried to lie down or stand up straight. I usually stayed in a cramped position and even inclined my bed for ease of sleep, which was really hard to get. After two to four weeks, all your pain goes away and you slowly start to go back to normal. And that's where the mental part begins.

After surgery, your head is filled with just getting better after surgery. You do not think about losing weight or changing your habits etc. But as time passes and your body starts to heal, you starting to feel better, your mind resets to it's normal state. For a month, I have eaten either full liquids or pureed food. Which tasted blend and I really wanted my taste buds to be stimulated in any form. Aside from that need of stimulation, food isn't really an issue at the beginning. I did not get hungry, I did not crave food just for the sake of it and even if I did, I would get full with just a couple spoons.

As time goes on, you also start to return back to your regular old social life, as restrictions on your foods and drinks slowly lift up. That's when I started to think I will never have as much fun taking a coffee or out eating with my friends or my girlfriend. I cried a lot ""realizing"" that. I am a social butterfly and I really hate being by myself. So this change really broke me to pieces. But human mentality is a real piece of art. It adjusts to both it's surroundings and to you, so much so that you would be surprised to see how many stuff you ""can"" be okay with given enough time. I did not have much problem socializing until one day, me and a couple of friends decided to barbecue for the weekend. I forgot that I now had a really small stomach, ate too much and puked for the first time. Not really a deal breaking experience as I have back with my friends in a few minutes. But that made me realize I in fact was not like rest of the people anymore, although not much different, I needed to adjust my life to the changes I went through. 

Realizing that marks the beginning of the end of your journey in my opinion. After that, you start to normalize your food portions, try to avoid certain foods (in my case fried chicken really was taking toll on me) and drinks. You begin to not measure everything, not care about anything and just have a healthy mindset. Craving some sweets? Yeah sure, but I instinctively knew when to stop at this time around. I began to see what I've once thought of downsides as bonuses. For example, not being able to eat too much seemed like a social tradeoff but now I see it as a financial advantage. When I'm out with friends, I either get the smallest item (which usually is cheaper) or just don't order at all and just take one or two bites off my friends' foods making me feel full without making them feel like fool. Or when I'm out with my girlfriend-whom also don't eat too much food- we order just one portion and eat it together. That in my opinion makes our dinner dates much more fun, romantic and inevitebly economic. 

As I have lost about 43 kg/95 lbs, I'm nearing the end of my weight loss journey. I expect to lose the last weights in 2-3 months as my pace have been pretty good. After that I believe my next journey starts, to keep those weights off, implementing a healthy and active life style and just being positive.

1jpn0c2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jpn0c2/aitah_because_my_friend_is_jealous_of_her/,AITAH because my friend is jealous of her boyfriend around me?,"So, I (23F) have been best friends with my gf (23F) for about six years. We met in college before either of us were in relationships. Now, we’re both in long-term relationships, and our boyfriends (24M & 24M) have actually been friends since high school. Funny enough, I was the one who set up her and her boyfriend, they’re literally together because of me.

Recently, though, my bestie has started acting really hostile toward me. Like, snapping at me over nothing, getting annoyed at my jokes, and even being rude when I try to smooth things over. It all escalated when she literally told me to ""get out"" while we were playing board games with friends at her place. At that point, I had to ask her what was up.

She admitted that she’s been feeling jealous because she thinks I’m too close to her boyfriend. But here’s the thing, our whole friend group has always been like this. Her boyfriend is naturally warm and friendly, he hugs people when he greets them, jokes around, and is just an outgoing guy. I’ve always been the same way, and nothing has ever been an issue before.

Also, it’s not like we ever meet one-on-one. Every time we hang out, it’s in a group, whether it’s a big gathering or just a few of us grabbing coffee, playing board games, or doing whatever friends do. It’s never anything private or personal.

What seemed to upset her the most was when I casually mentioned that her boyfriend looked like he had lost some weight, just an observation since I hadn’t seen him in a few days. Somehow, that really bothered her. She also brought up the fact that my boyfriend has been away on a work trip for two weeks, as if that was relevant or made things worse.

I told my boyfriend about it, and he thinks it’s ridiculous. And honestly, I agree. She has known me for years. She knows I would never cross a line. I never tried to make her jealous, she just decided to feel that way. But the fact that she believes I would do something like that? That stings the most.

I went from 2 cups to 1, down to 0. First two weeks were brutal, but nothing insurmountable. Since then I've never had more than two cups of caffeinated coffee a week. Most of the time it's one cup every 7-10 days. I feel so much better. I'm having decaf coffee, about 5-10 cups a week. The occasional black tea sprinkled in. 

I'm certainly not caffeine free, but I no longer need a cup of coffee to get started in the morning. The thought of the huge strong coffee I would have twice a day every day fills me with disgust now. 

It's so freeing not being addicted to it. I can enjoy a coffee and know that I won't need one have one for another week or two.

The rear seat also reclines and just has so much room. The reason I went for the RAM was due to two little kids so plenty of room and comforts as they grow. 

I love the daily use, but the size is a bit tiring when I do need to park, and it won't fit in the garage so rainy days its a dash to the car with the kids which I'm getting over quite quickly. I also can't fit under the height limit of our office building carpark in the cbd.

I also don't know if a sedan will be appropriate as they grow up, bikes for the park, dirty footballs or muddy clothes from sports games etc.

We’re the same age, and we share a lot of interests, which initially made me feel like we really connected. She’s new at work, here on an internship, and will be joining the company soon, while I’ve been working here for a while. A few weeks ago, I asked her out for coffee, and she said yes. The date went well. We had plenty to talk about, and she hugged me at the end. Since then, we’ve gone for a walk and spent time together at a work event. At one point in the office, she even rested her head on my shoulder while we talked, which made me think there might be potential for something more.

But here’s where it gets tricky: she often seems distant and negative. She talks about how everything in life is awful and says she’s overwhelmed with school (she’s working on her bachelor’s thesis and preparing for a big test). When I invite her to go out, she says she doesn’t have time (because of school), but days later tells me that her friend invited her, and she went out for coffee/drinks with her. On the other hand, she sends me Instagram reels and almost every day texts me asking how I’m doing and how my day was.

I’m torn because I genuinely like her and enjoy our shared interests. But her negativity and lack of effort to deepen our connection are starting to push me away. At the same time, I can’t stop thinking about her. Should I give her space and see if she comes around? Or should I take this as a sign that she’s not interested in anything more than casual interaction?

My issues: PCOS, low energy, possibly anemia. On metformin, Spiro, and a therapeutic iron supplement.

I eat well, low carb, and I currently do not have the energy to do much, but I used to go to a fitness center 2x a week for 2-3 h at a time in addition to doing stuff at home. I've tried fasting. I don't drink coffee. 

I'm curious about trying supplements from a long time ago again and seeing if they will do anything this time around.

It feels like if you name it, I've tried it. I currently take omegas, vitamin D, and B12 in addition to the above. Magnesium feels like it does something for muscle relaxing purposes but I did not bother to restock after I ran out recently. Berberine feels like it did something; meanwhile I tried inositol for months and it did nothing. I tried NMN and CoQ10 recently and it felt like it didn't do much.

I remember trying CLA, R-ALA, adaptogens of all sorts, DIM, calcium d glucarate, NAC... Electrolytes didn't do much either. 

I've been dealing with this all for years and it feels like I'm hitting a low point despite finally getting medication. I'm hoping that a bit of a slow time in my job (at least for now) will help give me a kick start to ramp things back up again, but I'm exhausted and burnt out and it feels like I do all the right things but it's never worked out.",1,1743595483.0,Biohackers,3,1.0,False
1jpmvrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1jpmvrt/my_rma_story_europe/,My RMA Story (Europe),"Hey everyone!

Just thought to share my RMA experience for a broken Steam Deck OLED screen after a minor fall.

***The Fall:***

I had the deck charging on a small coffee table that's around 80-90cm tall (2.5-3ft) when I went to reach out to grab it I got tangled in the cable and it face-planted directly to the floor.

***Damage:***

It's important to note I had a screen protector, but no outer case. The screen protector was spotless and the deck seemed like nothing was wrong it... until I turned it on. A VERY small fissure on the bottom right caused the entire screen to crack (under the screen protector mind you) and now my deck didn't have a screen. It was very painful because 1) Thought the fall wasn't as high. 2) Thought screen protector would keep it safe. 3) I realized I needed a case to protect it against falls, and now regretted not getting one when I clearly should've and could've.

See screenshot on post for picture I sent Valve when opening support ticket.

***RMA:***

Told the story to Valve and without hesitation their support team told me the damage was my fault (which it was) and that I could either repair it using iFixit or send it in for RMA and pay 200euros after an evaluation. I thought ""hey, might as well send it in so they can check if something else was wrong with it."". I got a sticker for UPS Express Saver the day after opening the ticket and off it went. I am in France, so it took 1 day to get to Germany and then 7 days after that to get an email from their Prague service provider quoting me 200 euro for a ""damaged screen"". I paid and got the steam deck 5 days later. From opening the ticket to getting the deck back it took a bit more than 2 weeks (counting weekends).

***Receiving the Repaired Deck:***

Upon arrival, I noticed the screen was bulging over the frame, so I pushed on it and it clicked right in. My guess is whoever repaired it didn't think to double-check the screen was correctly centered with the adhesive. It's been 1 month since I got it back and this happens every few days, I open it from the case and have to push ever so slightly to get it back down. Other than that, the deck works perfectly and there appears to be no other issue.

***Conclusion:***

I write this because when it happened, I basically scoured the web for a few hours reading all RMA stories I could find. There aren't many, so thought to share my experience. Here's what I learned and I hope it helps you if going through or thinking about RMAing your deck:

1. GET A CASE - The deck is well-built and appears strong, but this showed me how delicate it really is. Treat it with extreme care and put a case on it, it can and probably will save it from damage similar to a small fall like mine.
2. When contacting support, don't expect Valve to repair it for free, even if still under warranty (like mine). There's stories of valve fixing screens and other fall damage for free, but it's not the norm. My recommendation? Phrase the support ticket and query as something that could be interpreted as Valve's fault, even when it was a fall. This may elicit customer support to treat you like a king. I'm also of the theory that Valve support sees the account that bought the deck and judges you based on that. I bought the deck using a burner account (main steam account with hundreds of games is on another non-EU country) and I have the hunch if they would've seen my main account, they would've fixed it for free. Just a hunch though!
3. DON'T be scared to fix the screen of the OLED yourself. They made OLED screen replacements super easy, and the iFixit kit is 100 euros, so 50% less expensive than what I paid. Seeing the badly placed adhesive, the long processing time, and the exorbitant price, I would be opting for this route going forward if anything happens to my deck. I thought the Prague contractor (RECONEXT) would do an evaluation to check the deck for other damage, but it seems to me some intern pried it open, changed the screen, and lazily put it back together.

Hope this helps, and please enjoy this miracle little device! It's brought me so much joy you can't even imagine.

The Benefits of Working Remotely: Balancing Job Flexibility and Life Quality
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In recent years, the shift to remote work has transformed the traditional workplace dynamic. Working from the comfort of your home allows for a unique balance between personal life and professional duties. Understanding the benefits of remote work is essential, as it can significantly enhance both job flexibility and quality of life for many individuals.

### The Flexibility of Remote Work

One of the primary advantages of working remotely is the flexibility it provides. You can often set your own schedule, which can accommodate your personal commitments. This flexibility leads to a more tailored work-life balance. Here are a few ways you benefit from flexible working hours:

Your Gateway to Legit Work-From-Home Jobs: https://app.leadcreator.ai/fxludjx0p7  
  
- **Customizable Work Hours:** You can choose when to start and end your workday, allowing you to manage other responsibilities, like picking up your kids from school or attending a doctor’s appointment.
- **Productivity Peaks:** Everyone has different times when they feel most productive. Remote work allows you to take advantage of your peak performance hours, whether that’s early in the morning or later in the evening.
- **Reduced Commute:** Eliminating the daily commute saves time and reduces stress, allowing you to channel that energy into more productive activities.

### Enhanced Quality of Life

Quality of life often improves when you work from home. The environment is familiar and comfortable, which can lead to increased happiness and job satisfaction. Consider these factors:

- **Healthier Work Environment:** You can create a workspace that suits your needs, whether it's a cozy corner in your living room or a dedicated office space. This personalization can make working feel less monotonous and more enjoyable.
- **Better Work-Life Integration:** With the flexibility to manage your time, achieving a healthy balance between work and personal life becomes much easier. This includes having time for hobbies, family, and self-care activities.
- **Reduced Stress Levels:** By eliminating the daily commute and the typical office pressures, remote workers often report lower stress levels. This can lead to better mental health and overall well-being.

### Increased Autonomy and Self-Motivation

Working remotely fosters a sense of autonomy. You are largely responsible for managing your time and tasks. This independence is empowering and builds confidence. Here are some ways you experience increased autonomy:

Your Gateway to Legit Work-From-Home Jobs: https://app.leadcreator.ai/fxludjx0p7  
  
- **Ownership of Tasks:** You can choose how to approach your work, giving you the freedom to structure your projects in ways that suit your style and strengths.
- **Self-Motivation:** Without a boss looking over your shoulder, you must develop self-discipline and motivation to stay focused and complete your tasks.
- **Enhanced Skills:** The responsibility of managing your own workload leads to improved organizational skills and time management capabilities.

### Cost Efficiency

Working from home can also be cost-effective. Many remote workers notice significant savings in various areas, such as:

- **Transportation Costs:** With no daily commute, you save on gas, public transport fares, and wear and tear on your vehicle.
- **Work Attire:** You can dress casually for work, saving money on office wear and dry-cleaning bills.
- **Meals:** Eating at home rather than buying lunch or coffee every day can significantly reduce your overall food expenses.

### Environmental Impact

Remote work also plays a role in reducing your carbon footprint. Fewer commuters mean lower emissions, contributing to a healthier planet. You'll be part of a larger movement toward sustainable practices, which is incredibly beneficial for the environment.

Ultimately, the rise of remote work offers the chance to redefine not only your career but your lifestyle. By embracing the flexibility, better quality of life, autonomy, cost savings, and environmental benefits, you can enhance both your personal and professional experiences. With the right mindset and strategies, remote work can pave the way for a fulfilling, balanced life.

### Conclusion

Finding honest online jobs that don’t require leaving the house can be life-changing. These roles not only provide an opportunity to earn a living but also offer unmatched flexibility that fits seamlessly into your lifestyle. With options ranging from freelance writing and virtual assistance to customer service and teaching online, you have the power to choose a career path that aligns with your interests and strengths.

The benefits of working remotely extend far beyond convenience. You can create a work environment that fosters your productivity while saving time and money on daily commutes. This flexibility allows you to take control of your schedule, leading to better work-life balance. Whether it’s spending more time with family, pursuing hobbies, or simply taking a moment for yourself, the quality of your life can significantly improve when you work from home.

1jpmohm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1jpmohm/23_m4f/,23 [M4F],"Hey there! I’m 23, originally from Romania but grew up in Germany, so I speak both languages, which means my English can sometimes get a little mixed up. But for the right person, I can make it feel like my first language🤓.

I’ve had a rough few months as my previous partner chose to have the time of her life at the expense of my trust and self-esteem. But no, I’m not looking for a therapist – I’m more interested in finding someone who is patient and understanding, someone I can love without constantly overthinking. I’m generally an open, honest, outgoing, and loving person, but right now I’m taking small steps to avoid burning myself again.

I currently live in Belgium, and it would be great if you’re from here or at least from Europe (but that’s not a dealbreaker since I love to travel). What I’m looking for is a partner to build a beautiful, loving future with. I want to buy a house soon, have kids someday, and keep pets (I have a GSD myself). I want a woman who knows her worth, is confident, driven, but also someone I can have a little fun with when the mood strikes.

I love the sea when I’m with the right person, a good wine, cozy nights watching movies at home, but I’m also down for any party as long as you keep me grounded (I might end up in jail if I try to have too much fun😂). I enjoy cooking, late-night drives, morning coffee, music of all kinds (so you can be the DJ and I’ll dance), trips, camping, and much more. But I’ll stop here, otherwise this message will get too long – we can talk more privately if I’ve caught your interest.

As for my appearance, I’d say I’m average. Some people find me attractive, and others might not, so you’ll have to decide for yourself. I have blue eyes, broad shoulders, tattoos (planning to get more), I’m 175 cm tall, and I’m losing some hair at the moment, but I’m planning to get a transplant soon, just so you know up front. In general, I’ve got a good body, but I’ve gained a bit of weight in the last few months. I’m planning to start training again, so a partner who’s into fitness or willing to work out with me would be a great fit!

If you value communication, trust, loyalty, and character, feel free to reach out, and let’s see where this goes. Let’s start as friends and see how it develops!❤️

Ps: You got a bonus if you have beautiful eyes!

* Turkish opposition & celebs call for a **nationwide boycott** of pro-Erdogan businesses on **April 2**.
* Government fires back, **threatening lawsuits and jail time** for organizers.
* Targets include **major media, food brands, and travel companies**.
* **Another sign of Turkey’s growing political tension.**

[Erdogan shaking fist](https://preview.redd.it/27m16tcosese1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=220febb08ef3564d2e68a75eb590bb7a58c023af)

# What’s Happening?

A major political storm is brewing in Turkey as **opposition groups, backed by famous actors and musicians**, urge citizens to **boycott businesses linked to President Erdogan’s ruling party and family**. The protest, scheduled for **April 2**, calls for a **full-day spending freeze**—no shopping, no dining out.

But the government isn’t taking it lightly.

# Government’s Harsh Response:

* **Turkey’s Trade Minister, Ömer Bolat**, warned that **affected companies can sue the opposition for damages**.
* **Authorities are even considering criminal charges** against boycott organizers for **""inciting hatred and discrimination""**—punishable by **up to 2 years in prison**.

# Who’s on the ""Blacklist""?

The opposition’s boycott targets **major pro-government businesses**, including:

* **State media:** *Anadolu Agency, TRT*
* **Private media:** *CNN Türk, TGRT*
* **Big brands:** *Ulker (sweets), Espressolab (coffee chain), ETSTur (travel agency)*
* **Other targets:** Gas stations, lottery operators

# Why This Matters:

* This is the **latest escalation** in Turkey’s deepening political divide.
* The government’s threat of **legal action** shows how seriously it takes economic protests.
* Could this **spark wider unrest**? Or will fear of prosecution shut it down?

**Discussion Points:**

* Is this a **legitimate protest tactic** or economic sabotage?
* Will Turks **actually follow through** despite legal risks?
* How far will Erdogan’s government go to **crush dissent**?

**Thoughts?** (And if you’re Turkish—what’s the mood on the ground?)

1jpmhtc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1jpmhtc/just_a_long_ramble_of_sorts/,Just a long ramble of sorts,"Thought I'd just share my experience with looking into religion and faith, 90% of the time with Christianity. And with that also came exposure to atheism, what it is what it means, or can mean. It was a mess of a few years. Time lost with not a ton gained, left with a deeper sense that life...well this is it. And then...who knows.

I had never really had a nice cell phone, just years of base model bare minimums. Half a year ago or so my friend gave me his S22 Ultra he managed to drop it and crack the back but it still worked. And wow what a huge difference over what I was accustomed to. The phone was mine to do what I wished with it, nothing altogether wrong with the phone but the battery was fading away, so I found myself at the service provider store one day then shortly after found myself in the parking lot with an S25 Ultra. Outside of having to pay the taxes on the phone it's only $9 a month more on my bill after trade-in. Waived the insurance it's $17 a month. All-in-all, score.

They tried selling me a tablet and watch as well during my phone purchase. For like $2 a month more I could have had both the new Galaxy watch and S10+ tablet. But I would've had had to start two new lines of service which came out to an additional $30 a month more. Then having to pay the taxes on both devices which would've been pushing $200 combined. Then that $35 fee on each for beginning services on a new device. Managed to escape the store with just a phone.

But what that all did was send me on a trajectory into the world of tablets and smart watches. In just two weeks I tried out three smart watches and three tablets. There's a certain feeling that shopping upon Amazon can provide, perhaps retail therapy, in the end I got myself an S9 tablet for $475. Way more than I wanted to spend but goodness me what a nice tablet.

Lots of info up above that has nothing to do with Christianity and atheism. Except that I got me away from both, looking at both, the shopping and research did that. But I was chasing happiness through shopping and did not find it, but did find something new to occupy my time and thoughts. And I'll not be going back to any of the four, watches and Christianity and tablets and atheism. 

Life is weird. I'm still not very happy, not depressed either but not gleeful either. I do not leap out of bed to greet the day and honestly look forward (quite often) to the end of my time here. Getting tired of working but I'm not lazy. Eventually every job I've ever had (current one as well) loses it's ability to keep me somewhat content, keep me from just wanting to give up. So I understand what God or the concept of can provide some people with, hope for a better and everlasting future, maybe help keep folks getting up every day and also away from certain thoughts and something to...makes sense. 

It snowed last night. Not much but enough to change the scenery. During the last three years of research and video watching about faith and disbelief i did not get out much. And put a little weight on. Got tired of both one day so I'll be going for a hike walk to the store again here soon, get a cup or coffee and bring my new tablet. Sit and look up and out the windows here and there and maybe find something new and fun to dive into. But yea life is so weird. And then eventually it's all over.

But I will say that atheism is (from my perspective at least) a trendy and effective way to get YouTube video views, from Christian content creators. Hate to say it but there's rather a little or a lot of hidden agenda stuff going on, content creators exploiting that trend. Disingenuous, in a way. I'm just doing better by moving on from all of this. And getting outside for exercise, losing more and more weight every week so score again. But the thoughts will probably always surface and from time to time, the looking forward to this life being over.

Not sure if this post will be taken down but if so that's ok. Another helpful hobby of sorts is writing. Just thought I'd share how things went down over the last few years. Was an interesting ride.

1jpmg9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1jpmg9o/horrible_ex_sisterinlaw_part_1/,Horrible Ex Sister-in-law Part 1,"Hello, listeners or readers. I have a true story for you that a friend of mine told me. I have most of the receipts that will be in text for privacy reasons. I also have permission from her to share it. Most of the texts have been gathered from the other members of the family and friends to put this together. I do apologize for how long it is, but I do hope you enjoy it. I will not be using real names for obvious reasons and decided to write this from her point of view. 

This all started at the beginning of 2024. My husband received some unfortunate news from his brother that required them to have a family meeting. His used-to-be sister(Verona) tried to say goodbye to this world.Not long ago, her fiance and her ended their engagement. We all tried our best to be there for her, but she was locked up and always in her room. 

Since she ended her engagement, she made the big step of moving out of her parents’ house into an apartment. Then, one day, my brother-in-law and his wife received a text from her. She took some pills (Tylenol, anti-depressants, and antibiotics for her cold sore on her lip) to self terminate, so she became worried for her life and wanted to live. So Bob(brother-in-law) and Em(his wife) took Verona to the hospital, and the doctors sent her to the mental hospital to help her. She asked Bob to take care of her cat while she was gone, then boom out of the blue she told him “Never mind” and they found out that she asked her manager to do it instead, which was weird.

 Now, at this meeting, we found out some very interesting information that Verona was having a weird relationship with her manager, who is also married and has three kids. They’ve been spending a lot of time together, texting 24/7, bringing her coffee, and taking her with him to a baseball game. In her words, they are just friends and she’s also friends with his wife, yet she spended most of her time with him only. When they transferred her to the mental hospital, they took her phone away so she couldn’t cause herself harm. She ended up throwing a tantrum because she wouldn’t be able to text this manager. 

In all of our opinions, we agreed that this relationship was very unhealthy and could lead to feelings that shouldn’t be there. So, we all decided to text Chad(the manager) on Bob’s phone, and this is how it went:

Us: “Hi Chad, this is Bob, Verona’s brother. I was wanting to speak to you about her and mainly your relationship with her. Verona is going through a lot in her life at the moment, and we have all noticed that your relationship with her is very unhealthy and unprofessional. She has grown an attachment to you that is not going to help her, especially that you are her manager and married with a family. 
We think it is best that you take some time to reflect on your relationship with her and the potential damage it is doing. She is young and confused, and she needs to find best friends that are her age, not her boss. I would appreciate if this conversation stayed between us and that you take our concern seriously.”

His response was: “Hi Bob, I understand the concern. Verona is actually friends with my wife as well. You are more than welcome to reach out to her as well. We all became very close recently. I do understand. Thank you for reaching out.”

Us: “I could understand a basic friendship with your coworker, but I need you to understand this is inappropriate. Verona only talks to you all day, every day, and that is truly not ok. She has pushed all her other friends aside, including her family, for your relationship. If you were a female, that would be one thing, but you are a male who she has an unhealthy bond with. She rarely even talks to your wife, and I think me and you both know that. I do not know what your true intentions are here, but it’s clearly beyond friendship at this point.” 

Him: “No intentions at all with her at all. But I understand. I will step away.”

Us: “Thank you for understanding. It’s going to take a while for us to get her back on track, and we’re only doing this because we care for her. Nothing personal against you.”
 
Then, we discussed how we were going to be there for her and how we were going to support her.

She finally got out of the hospital and called Em to pick her up. Em made sure that she was okay, ready to be alone again and made a light suggestion to maybe move back in with her parents. She was insistent that she was going to be okay. She didn’t spend much time with any of us, but my husband put in the effort to invite her to places with us, but she always declined.

I didn’t mind it too much because, to be honest, I already didn’t like her. She seemed to hate the fact that her brother chose me as his other half. I also hated the way she always acted like such a holy person and would go off on anyone she would get a chance to. Always had a victim mentality and loved to lie. Now, don’t get me wrong, I wasn’t happy about her trying to commit suicide, so I wanted to put my dislike aside and be there for her.

One day, she showed up at her parents’ house so her brothers could change her tires. She was spending time with her sister Bianca. My husband and I, for our first year of marriage, built a tiny home in his parent's backyard, so when we heard she finally came over, we went to go see her. After no one was in the room except for Verona, Bianca, and me. I ended up asking her some questions about her relationship with her mom. Found out that she saw her mom as manipulative, wouldn’t let her breathe, and was too much for her. I found that shocking because she and her mom were like best friends; her mom was the sweetest thing out there. I also had a great relationship with her, so it confused me. When she left, I looked at Bianca and asked, “Is that how you also feel about your mom?” She looked at me and said, “Sometimes.”

Then, out of the blue, everyone was blocked, like every single one of the family members, including most relatives. Evelina(mother-in-law) was really upset and hurt. She put in most of the effort to try and contact Verona, but the responses she received were horrible. Evelina went through a lot of tears from what her daughter told her. She called her a horrible mother and said she was never there for her. Everything she texted her mom was inconsiderate and hurtful. When Evelina would stop texting her by Verona’s request, she would text her friend to make sure that she was doing okay. Verona didn’t like that very much and always complained. With this going on, Evelina ran to her kids. We were all mad about this situation and were there for her as best we could.

Now Bianca worked at a theme park, and sometimes I was asked to either drop her off or pick her up. So on this one particularly gloomy day when I was picking her up with my husband, she said, “Guess what, Verona texted me.” We were shocked; Bianca had the opportunity to go off on her for everything. Verona started texting Bianca more often after that, and it was absurd. 

She started badmouthing Evelina, my husband, their dad, their uncle, and worst of all, Em and Bob. Saying things like don’t be alone with any man, especially uncle, and don’t be alone with your brothers. Dad was a horrible father. That mom is just a horrible person, partially because she wasn’t there for her and kept it to herself, about that cancer and rape that Verona mentioned to her, to never trust mom with anything, etc. This wasn’t true; Evelina was trying her best, and we had receipts later. The reason none of us knew what happened is because Verona asked Evelina not to tell anyone. To not trust Bob or Em because they are horrible people, when asked, no reason was given. When Bianca asked her what sort of cancer she had, she said that she didn’t want her looking it up and then worrying about it. 

We found out from Bianca later that apparently, nobody liked Verona at work; she was always rude. The manager, on the other hand, cheated on his wife with a coworker. Everyone at work called him a walking red flag, and the two always ate lunch together. This came from Verona’s coworkers. 

Then Verona started making up random medical crap that made zero sense. She said that her doctors can’t find what’s wrong with her, so they will be cutting her open to find the issue. No doctor does that. Then, when Evelina heard that her daughter had cancer, she went to check her medical records. Weirdly enough, she found nothing to do with it, and her bloodwork was clean. Then when she was saying that she was raped by her uncle, at this point we didn’t know if we should believe her or not. 

Her uncle literally doesn’t need a woman for that reason anymore because his ding dong no longer works. So, it decided to work just to rape her? He has lived in their backyard for four years, so why now after four years he was like, “Let me repay my brother by raping his daughter.” Not long after we found out about the rape, Verona took the clothes from that day and went to report the rape to the cops. After receiving a court order, the uncle ended up talking to my husband’s older brother, Jack. He said what happened around that time was he went to go and put clothes in the washer since he didn’t have one. So, he knocked on her door to ask her to let him know when the clothes were done. When he got no response, he opened the door, but she was sleeping, so he left. That was the only time he was there when her parents were on vacation. After this incident, he bought his own washer so that this wouldn’t happen again.

Verona was telling her mom how she is seeing a therapist, and he said that she should be away from her family to heal because of everything they put her through and how they took her childhood away from her because she always had to babysit. She never really had to babysit her siblings, and from stories, she had a good childhood. Then boom, not too long after, she said she had a boyfriend. 

Now, out of the blue, she wants to meet with her family because she misses all of them and wants them to meet Ty, but under no circumstances does she wanna see Bob and Em. Why? We still to this day don’t know. She also mentioned how she wanted to see my husband and me before we moved but put in 0 effort to do that.

Evelina became excited because her daughter wanted to finally see her but was really nervous, so she and Bianca were begging us to come to make it less awkward. At this point, my husband and I couldn’t stand her, but I wanted to be there for them. Verona also had the audacity to text her mom, saying that if anybody was going to be disrespectful, they were going to leave. We showed up at the restaurant about 20 minutes earlier. Then we received a call from Bianca. Verona, her Royal Highness, has requested that we all dress fancy, which, since most of our things were packed, we showed up like homeless people with a smile.

Bianca was not ready to see this woman, so we snuck into the bathroom, and we felt so uncomfortable. After getting some air, we gathered up the courage and went to the table. I didn’t look at that b***h. I felt so sick sitting there with her acting as if nothing happened. My husband ordered food, but since my stomach was turning, I decided not to order anything. 

Verona ordered gluten-free food because her doctor prescribed it for her leukemia. I heard some of the conversation, but not all, and it all sounded like bs. She apparently quit her job because her doctor recommended it for her health. Her boyfriend Ty had cancer 5 times, did chemo, and is now healed. She praised her therapist, and he said that she could spend one last time with family before starting her healing journey. With her pretending like she did nothing wrong, I told my husband to give me the keys and that we should leave. He agreed. 

When he got to the car I started crying I couldn’t stand her acting as if nothing happened after making Evelina cry multiple times, bashing the whole family, accusing her uncle of rape, and making her dad run to alcohol because of it. I was SA as a kid so it hurt me that she was saying she was raped but her body didn’t give any signs of it. I remember how my body and mind reacted to it after it finally stopped, and she was showing no signs of it.

Evelina was excited that Verona had started texting her more and more. So, one day, Verona invited her mom over, and sneakily Evelina took Bianca with her. Bianca hated her at this point and wanted nothing to do with her, she didn’t like that very much. 

Since Evelina is a medical assistant, she ended up asking Verona to show her her prescription for her leukemia. She went to her cabinets with Ty whispering and looking for it. For some odd reason, all of a sudden, her prescription ran out, and they had already thrown the bottle away, so she needed to get more. SWEETHEART, YOU NEED TO TAKE THIS RELIGIOUSLY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DON’T HAVE ANYMORE? 

Finally, Verona started telling Evelina and Bianca how she got raped. The location was constantly changing and not adding up. She said that he raped her in the kitchen, then changed it to the living room and last but not least her room. She also mentioned that he was sober. We all know how he is drunk and sober. There is no way he would do something like this sober, he doesn’t even touch you drunk. The youngest sister was home that day with Verona. Oddly enough, Luna didn’t hear anything happening. Verona said she didn’t scream because she didn’t want to traumatize Luna. 

At this point, all of the siblings were convinced she was lying about everything. We warned the parents to be very careful with her because we didn’t know what she might pull next. Evelina after hearing her daughter's story of rape convinced her husband to kick his brother out so Verona can be comfortable coming back and can trust them again. Around this time, my husband and I were starting our move across the country. After we settled down, we were kept informed on the situation there. 

Em talked with me, and I found out some hurtful information that made me worry about Bianca. Bianca was being physically and mentally abused by Verona. I noticed some signs of some sort of abuse, but I didn’t realize how bad it was. Bianca once told me how Verona was acting more like a mom than a big sister. If their mom would let Bianca do something, Verona would be strictly against it. I found this really weird. When I mentioned it to Evelina, she just brushed it off. Em told me the story that happened at a pool, how Verona practically tried to drown Bianca, and she had to run in and stop her. When I asked Bianca about how she felt at that moment, she told me that she was terrified for her life. This is when I started worrying about her safety.

Apparently, Verona made up the gluten-free crap. When she came to visit her parents, she got Jack in the box with a burger and fries. 

Later, Verona ended up having coffee with her mom, and Evelina completely changed after that. Then, not even a month later, after their uncle moved out, Verona decided that she wanted to move into the tiny home we lived in with her boyfriend and their 7 cats because they were looking for an apartment. Verona already didn’t have a job, and Ty soon followed in her steps; they were now working at Uber while he was looking for a job. Her mom suggested the tiny home, but she already talked with someone else about it. This person was not informed of this, though.
 
We all had a meeting with parents, telling them and begging them not to let her move in. This was a horrible idea, but they fought against us and stood up for her. We then begged Evelina not to let Bianca be with Verona alone. She told us that they would not be in their house without them there, and that won’t be happening. Well, that was all a lie.

None of us felt heard after that meeting, and all of us poured our hearts out. Bianca cried, telling her parents how she couldn’t stand her and that she didn’t want to see her ever again. But they just kept on defending her how she’s their daughter, and we wouldn’t understand. We asked them if she even bothered to apologize and got no response. Now, the parents are religious, so living together before marriage is a no-go. So, we also said if she’s going to move in, it’ll have to be without him. The dad agreed to talk with her and make a deal, but whatever we said and the deal that was supposed to happen were all thrown out in the trash.

With this decision, we all saw where we stood. Bob and Em stopped coming over on Sundays, we stopped talking with the parents. Dad and Mom continued texting the kids that have moved, that they love us all equally. But Evelina added more to that: how we should forgive Verona and move on. It felt like we didn’t matter as much as she did. 

Then Bob received this text from Evelina: “Bob hello. We as parents are responsible for the psychological state of our minor kids(Bianca, Luna) and are begging to not discuss with them the decisions we made as parents and making them go against us. I hope you understand what I mean. Our home is open to all of the kids. We love you all.”

My husband also received a couple of messages from Evelina as well: “Zack. You may be sleeping right now. Just want you to know that I love you a lot, and Rose is my daughter too, and I love her too. I love everyone the same. Just when someone is broken, like Verona right now needs our help. It doesn’t mean we love her more. Did she hurt us- yes. Do we agree with her actions- no, do we approve of her living with Ty like she is- no. She is reaching out slowly to us, and we have to give shoulders to learn on, arms to hug her. God is answering our prayers. Yes, she hurt us. She knows that. She will talk when she is ready and healed. I hope you understand that we can not choose over our children, and we are not. At this moment she needs us the most and we must because we love her. She’s like the prodigal daughter, lost and returning to her parents. Just want to say that. I love you two very much and pray for you.”

And. 

“Dad talked to Ty and Verona Sunday evening. His relationship with her is serious. Dad told him that he wants them to get married. Verona said they already discussed that and are planning to do so. That’s in process. He told her that she needs to make peace with everyone, she knows that and praying about it, and she is asking to give her time. She will do that when ready. We are asking you to be patient. I am sorry if that is not what you want to hear. It is really hard for us parents right now, and this is where we are. They are moving in, and we did discuss boundaries- we are not going over to them without asking, and this applies to them too. If we are not home, they are not coming over, and if we are home and they need something or want to come over, they will need to ask. We are not choosing her over you guys. My heart is breaking into pieces.”

Jack’s birthday was coming up, and the family was planning on celebrating on a Saturday. Evelina decided to invite Verona and Ty, but since Verona didn’t want to see Bob and Em, Evelina took it upon herself to not even bother inviting them and sweep it under the rug. Verona and Ty had now replaced Em and Bob. Their feelings mattered more than the rest of the family. But Jack wanted to invite Bob and Em, so Evelina acted like she didn’t just try pulling the favorite card.

Men with daughters my age with some fatherly advice are very welcome too.

I'm 19F and I'm in vet school basically (not in the USA). I'm a freshman (no, I didn't graduate hs last year) and I've been meeting a handful of guys lately. There's not that many to be honest, vet is a very girls and gays type of course. But I think the problem is less the amount and more of the quality. I've always been into boys who were a little bit older since I started being interested in boys. I think I'm at the stage I'm finding college guys a little too boy-ish to me.

It might not even be related to age per se but with occupation, until last month I was casually talking to a guy who was 21 but working and I didn't find him immature in the same way I find guys in my university. I think it might be that guys at that stage are very much in that no plans, no experience, hookups, a coffee date is too much pressure/commitment, mindset. It doesn't mena they have immature personalities, but I find that way of thinking silly and unattractive. But as far as employment goes, is hard to find a guy around my age who is working but has an actual career plan too, most of the ones I know seem to be doing so just to buy shoes and games and avoid going to college, which is not ideal either.

The problem is I don't know how to meet these guys and I don't know how to attract them either. I've met some on the internet but internet guys seem to more often than not be waaay above average in weirdness and emotional immaturity (ended things with the last two ones because I couldn't/didn't want to spend +2 hours texting them about their niche interests everyday). Plus, long-distance is difficult. And, as for attracting them, is not that I'm unnatractive by any obvious flaws. I'm pretty, I have a great body, I'm educated, have plenty of hobbies and interests and people generally find me funny and kind. But I'm not very conventional, not in how I present myself nor in personality, and I own it. It seems that guys in general can get a little intimidated or confused and ultimately decide it's not worth it. And when it comes to older guys, I do look a little young (not on purpose, just genetics) which can also be offputting.

Is there any way of addressing these issues or is the solution just ""waiting it out""? I feel like I'm going to stay single forever. I don't even think my standards are that high, just maybe specific. Naturally, being single is better than beingvin a relationship I don't really want with a guy I don't really like but at least I'd like to know I tried.",1,1743593483.0,AskMenAdvice,20,0.57,False

The letter arrived on a cold winter morning, tucked between camp notices and a weathered scroll detailing the week’s training schedule. Sadira almost missed it.  

It had been months since she received anything from home. Her mother had always been good about sending letters—little updates about Buffalo’s ever-changing seasons, Oliver’s latest antics, her job at the university. But as the months passed and Liam’s condition remained unchanged, the letters had slowed. Arielle had never said it outright, but Sadira could tell—hope was slipping. It was easier to live with something when you accepted it as permanent.  She didn’t blame her mother. She had tried doing the same.  

But this letter was different. The paper was trembling slightly in her hands before she even unfolded it. Something told her this wasn’t just another routine check-in. Sadira sat on her bed, legs crossed, the morning light filtering through the cabin’s small window, casting long golden rays across the wooden floor. She swallowed, her heart hammering against her ribs. Then, carefully, she broke the seal.  

> **Dear Sadira,**  
> I hope this letter finds you well. I know we haven’t spoken much lately, and I regret that. I miss you so much. I miss my little girl, my star. I know you’ve been carrying more than you should, and I hope one day you’ll let yourself put some of it down. But that’s not the only reason I’m writing.  
> You might want to sit down for this. The doctors—*they think Liam might be waking up*.  
> It’s faint, but they’re convinced—*he’s fighting his way back*.  
> I don’t want to get ahead of myself, but for the first time in almost two years, the doctors are saying there’s a chance. They don’t know how long it’ll take, or even if he’ll fully wake up, but there’s hope. And I wanted you to know. I wanted you to have that hope too.  
> I don’t want to pressure you, but if you can, come home. Oliver and I would love to have you here. You don’t have to stay long, but I think it would mean the world to all of us. And if Liam really is coming back to us… I want you here when it happens.  
> Love you always,  
> **Mom**  

Sadira read the letter once. Then twice.  Her breath hitched. A heavy weight settled in her chest, pressing into her ribs, making it hard to inhale. Her fingers curled around the edges of the paper, clutching it so tightly the ink seemed to blur.  

Liam… waking up?  

For a long time, she had forced herself to stop thinking about it. It was easier to accept the silence, the stillness, than to keep hoping for something that might never happen. Two years. Two years of standing by his hospital bed, squeezing his hand and whispering to him even when it felt like talking to a ghost. Two years of waiting, of pretending she had made peace with the loss of him even when she hadn’t.  

She had buried the hope so deep she almost didn’t recognize it when it tried to surface again. But now, the mere possibility that he might return sent a shock through her body, a warmth she hadn’t felt in a long, long time.  

She needed to go home.  

She had boarded a plane that same evening, a direct flight from Long Island to Buffalo. The cabin had been dimly lit, filled with the low hum of conversation and the occasional flicker of turbulence. She barely remembered the flight itself. Her mind was too preoccupied with what lay ahead.  

Would Liam recognize her? Would he *really* wake up? Would everything change, or would nothing change at all?  

She was still asking herself these questions when the plane touched down, and she found herself staring at the familiar city skyline through the small oval window.  

She was home.  

The airport was as crowded as ever, filled with the chaotic energy of arrivals and departures. Sadira scanned the crowd, her pulse quickening as she searched for familiar faces.  

And then—  

“Sadie!”  

Her breath hitched.  

Oliver was the first to reach her. He was taller than she remembered—when had that happened? Had it really been so long since she last saw him in person? His brown hair was messier than usual, his jacket unzipped, his dark eyes alight with excitement. Before she could react, he had swept her into a tight, breath-stealing hug.  

“Gods, it’s good to see you,” he mumbled into her shoulder. “You’re still tiny.”  

Sadira laughed, even as she tried to shove him off. “And you’re still an *idiot*.”  

“I missed you too,” Oliver said, grinning as he finally pulled back. “Come on, Mom’s waiting.”  

Arielle stood a few feet away, her hands clasped tightly in front of her, eyes shining with barely contained emotion.  

Sadira’s throat tightened. Her mother had always been strong, but the past two years had aged her in ways that were hard to ignore. There was exhaustion behind her smile, a quiet sadness in the way she carried herself. But when Sadira stepped closer, Arielle opened her arms, and suddenly, she wasn’t a woman weighed down by grief. She was just a mother who had missed her child.  

“My little star,” Arielle murmured as she pulled Sadira into her arms. “You’re home.”  

Sadira squeezed her eyes shut, burying her face in her mother’s shoulder. “I’m home.”  

--- 

The car ride was filled with conversation. Arielle asked about camp, Oliver filled her in on all the things she had missed—how their old neighbors had moved away, how their family dog had somehow learned to open doors, how her favorite bookstore had closed (*that one hurt*).  

And then, of course, there was Liam.  

“They say he might wake up any day now,” Arielle said, her hands gripping the wheel tightly. “The doctors don’t want to promise anything, but… it’s progress.”  

“Have you talked to him?” Sadira asked softly.  

Arielle nodded. “Every day. He doesn’t respond, not really, but sometimes… I swear I feel him listening.”  

Sadira swallowed past the lump in her throat.  

Oliver nudged her shoulder. “He’s gonna want to see you, y’know.”  

“I know,” she whispered.  

And for the first time in two years, she actually believed it. She was home. And maybe, just maybe, Liam was coming back too.  

The drive home was long, but for once, Sadira didn’t mind.  

She sat in the back seat, watching the city lights blur past the window, listening to the hum of the engine as her mother drove. The roads of Buffalo were familiar. She knew these streets, the way the buildings curved around the skyline, the way the streetlights flickered at certain intersections. Yet, after so long at Camp Half-Blood, everything felt distant, like she was watching a memory play out in real-time.  

Arielle and Oliver kept the conversation going, filling the space with updates about home—how Oliver had nearly failed his history class but somehow talked his way into extra credit, how Arielle had taken up baking to de-stress, how their neighbor's dog had become a local legend after escaping a record *five* times.  

Sadira listened, nodding where appropriate, but her mind kept drifting.  

She could still feel the weight of the letter in her pocket, even though she knew it was folded neatly in her bag. *Liam might be waking up.* The words circled in her head, over and over, an impossible mantra she was afraid to believe in too much.  

Because if she let herself hope, and it turned out to be nothing… She wasn’t sure she could handle that.  

“Sadie,” Oliver’s voice cut through her thoughts. She blinked, turning to him.  

“Hm?”  

“You’re *way* too quiet,” he said, watching her with an expression that was both teasing and concerned. “What’s going on in that dream-filled brain of yours?”  

Sadira hesitated. Then, after a moment, she sighed. “I… don’t know. It still doesn’t feel real.”  

Oliver’s teasing demeanor softened. “Yeah,” he admitted, resting his head against the car window. “I get that.”  

Arielle glanced at them through the rearview mirror, her lips pressing together. “I know it’s a lot to process,” she said gently. “I feel the same way. Every time I visit the hospital, I expect to see him just… the same. But now, there’s this chance, and I don’t know if I should hold onto it or not.”  

Sadira stared at her hands, curling her fingers against her jeans.  

“Do you think he’ll wake up?” she asked, voice barely above a whisper.  

Arielle was quiet for a long time. Then, she took a breath and said, “I think… I *want* to believe he will.”  

Sadira bit the inside of her cheek. That wasn’t exactly the answer she wanted, but she understood it. Hope was a fragile thing. Too much of it, and it shattered like glass.  

When they pulled into the driveway, Sadira felt her chest tighten. The house hadn’t changed much. It was still the same two-story home she had left behind, with its dark blue siding and the porch light glowing faintly in the evening mist. The small flower garden by the steps was still there, though some of the plants had withered with the colder months. The window to her room was shut tight, the curtains drawn, just as she had left them.  

It was *home*, but not quite.  

Sadira stepped out of the car, breathing in the cool night air. For a moment, she just stood there, taking it all in. The scent of damp earth, the distant sound of wind rustling through trees, the faint hum of a neighbor’s television playing through an open window. She had missed this more than she realized.  

“You coming?” Oliver called from the doorway, holding it open for her.  

Sadira shook herself from her thoughts and nodded, grabbing her duffel bag and following him inside.  

The moment she stepped through the door, a wave of nostalgia crashed over her. The house *smelled* the same, like cinnamon and vanilla, with a faint hint of old books. Arielle’s favorite scented candles were lit on the coffee table, casting a soft glow across the living room. The furniture was all in the same place, the walls still adorned with family pictures, but there were small changes too.  Decorations, a different rug, an unfamiliar stack of books on the shelf.  

Her heart clenched. Everything was *almost* the same. But the absence of Liam was glaringly obvious. She had spent so many nights on that couch, listening to his stories about his old quests, laughing as he tried (and failed) to teach Oliver how to play chess. Now, the couch sat empty, the air in the house *too* quiet.  

Arielle sighed, setting her purse down on the counter. “Make yourself comfortable, sweetheart. I know you must be tired.”  

Sadira nodded, but she didn’t sit. Instead, she wandered toward the fireplace, tracing her fingers over the edge of the mantle. There was a picture frame sitting there, one she hadn’t seen before.  

It was a photo of all four of them—her, Arielle, Oliver, and Liam—taken the summer before everything changed. Liam had his arm slung around Oliver’s shoulder, grinning. Arielle was laughing, mid-motion, as if someone had just told a joke. Sadira was standing next to Liam, looking up at him with a small, almost shy smile. Her fingers trembled slightly as she picked up the frame.  

Oliver came up beside her, looking over her shoulder. He was quiet for a moment before he said, “Mom put that up last year.”  

Sadira swallowed. “It’s a good picture.”  

“Yeah,” Oliver agreed. “It really is.”  

She set it back down carefully, then let out a slow breath. “I’m gonna put my stuff upstairs.”  

Arielle gave her a small smile. “Of course. Your room is just as you left it.”  

Sadira stood in the doorway, her heart pounding as she took it all in. Her bedroom was untouched.  The books on her shelves were still in perfect order. Her bed was neatly made, her soft gray blankets folded just how she liked them. The small dreamcatcher she had made as a child still hung by the window, its delicate threads swaying slightly in the draft. It was like stepping into a moment that had been paused for too long.  

She walked inside, dropping her bag at the foot of the bed. Slowly, she reached out and ran her fingers over her desk, tracing patterns in the thin layer of dust that had settled there. She sat down, breathing in deeply.  

For a moment, she just let herself *be*. 

Then a knock at the door startled her.  

“Yeah?”  

Oliver poked his head in. “You okay?”  

Sadira hesitated. Then, she nodded. “Yeah.”  

He gave her a look that said *I don’t believe you*, but didn’t push. Instead, he stepped inside, flopping onto her bed without waiting for permission.  

“So,” he said, propping himself up on his elbows. “Are you gonna tell me how Camp’s been?”  

Sadira smirked slightly. “Since when do you care?”  

“Since I have nothing better to do,” Oliver shot back. “Come on, spill. Any new monster attacks? Any quests? *Any* secret love affairs?”  

Sadira groaned. “Oh my gods, Oliver—”  

“I *knew* it! You totally have a thing for someone.”  

“I *don’t!*”  

Oliver smirked, clearly enjoying this far too much. “Sure. Whatever you say.”  

Sadira grabbed a pillow and launched it at him. He dodged, laughing.  For the first time in *way* too long, Sadira found herself laughing too. The weight in her chest didn’t feel as heavy. And maybe, just maybe… everything would be okay.

—

Sadira didn’t sleep much that night. She lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, listening to the familiar creaks and sighs of the house as it settled into the night. Her body ached from the journey, from the tension she had carried for months, but sleep refused to come.  

Her mind was too full. The letter. The car ride. The way Oliver had looked at her. The way Arielle’s voice had trembled. Sadira turned onto her side, curling her arms around herself. Hope was a dangerous thing. For two years, she had tried to smother it, to bury it beneath the weight of everything else. If she didn’t expect anything, then she couldn’t be disappointed. If she let herself believe that Liam wasn’t coming back, then she could move forward without the endless ache of *what if* dragging her down.  

But now… She clenched her eyes shut. She wanted to believe. Gods, she wanted to believe.  

---   

Sadira must have drifted off at some point because the next thing she knew, the smell of coffee and something sweet filled the air.  

For a moment, she forgot where she was.  

Her eyes fluttered open, the soft morning light spilling through the window. The warmth of her blankets cocooned her, the sounds of movement and quiet conversation drifting up from downstairs.  For a few seconds, she thought she was back at Camp Half-Blood, waking up to the sounds of early morning training. But then she sat up, saw the old posters on her wall, the bookshelves lined with well-worn novels, the wooden floor that still creaked in the exact same spots—  

And remembered. She was home.  A part of her still wasn’t sure how to feel about that.  

Swinging her legs over the side of the bed, she stretched, her muscles sore and stiff from travel. She caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror above her dresser—messy brunette curls, tired green eyes. Nothing new under the sun. She sighed, raking her fingers through her hair before padding barefoot to the door.  

Downstairs, the house was warm, filled with the scent of fresh cinnamon rolls and the soft hum of morning radio. Oliver was already at the table, dressed in an oversized hoodie, scrolling lazily through his phone while half-heartedly chewing on a piece of toast. Arielle stood by the counter, pouring herself a cup of coffee, her face drawn but relaxed in a way Sadira hadn’t seen in a long time.  

Arielle must have sensed her presence because she turned, a soft smile crossing her face. “Good morning, sweetheart.”  

Sadira stepped into the kitchen, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. “Morning.”  

Oliver waved his toast at her. “You look horrible.”  

“Thanks,” she said dryly, flopping into the chair across from him.  

Arielle set a plate of cinnamon rolls in front of her before brushing a hand over her curls in an affectionate gesture. “Did you sleep okay?”  

Sadira hesitated. “Yeah.”  

Arielle gave her a look. The kind that said *I know when you’re lying, young lady.*  

Sadira busied herself with tearing off a piece of cinnamon roll, avoiding her mother’s gaze.  

Oliver snorted. “She totally didn’t.”  

“Oliver,” Arielle chided, but her voice was gentle.  

Sadira sighed, relenting. “I just… had a lot on my mind.”  

There was a quiet pause. Then, Arielle set her coffee down and sat across from her. “Do you want to talk about it?”  

Sadira considered it.  She could say no. She could brush it off like she always did, pretend she was fine, that she wasn’t a tangled mess of emotions about Liam, about everything.  But she was tired of pretending.  

“I don’t know how to feel,” she admitted, voice quieter than she meant it to be. “I want to believe he’ll wake up. I do. But I’m scared.”  

Arielle’s expression softened, a flicker of sadness in her gaze.  

Oliver set his phone down, watching her carefully. “Scared of what?”  

Sadira swallowed. “What if he doesn’t? What if I get my hopes up, and it’s nothing? Or… what if he *does* wake up, but he’s not the same?”  

The words hung in the air, heavy and unspoken.  

Arielle reached across the table, taking Sadira’s hand in hers. “Sweetheart… I don’t have the answers. I wish I did. But whatever happens, you won’t be alone.”  

Sadira looked down at their hands, her mother’s warmth grounding her.  

Oliver nudged her foot under the table. “Yeah. We got you, Sadie.”  

Sadira let out a slow breath. “Yeah,” she murmured. “I know.”  

---

The hospital smelled like antiseptic and something too clean to feel natural. And Sadira hated it. The moment they stepped through the automatic doors, a cold weight settled in her stomach. She had been here before, *too many times*.  

The fluorescent lights buzzed softly overhead as they walked through the quiet halls, past nurses and visitors, past patients in wheelchairs and doctors murmuring into clipboards. The scent of coffee from the vending machine mixed with the sterile air, creating something that made her throat feel tight.  

Arielle had barely slept the night before. Sadira had heard her pacing in the kitchen long after everyone had gone to bed, the soft creak of the floorboards a lullaby of restless hope. Oliver had tried to play it cool, but even he had been jittery all morning, bouncing his knee at breakfast, checking his phone every five seconds like he was expecting a call from the gods themselves.  

She walked between her mother and Oliver, her hands curled into fists inside the pockets of her hoodie. Her heart pounded in her chest, loud and unsteady, as if her body knew something monumental was about to happen 

Room 217.  

Sadira knew it by heart. Her hands felt clammy as she curled them into fists. They stopped outside the door.  

Arielle turned to her, searching her face. “Are you ready?”  

Sadira inhaled sharply. No. Not at all. She never was. But she nodded anyway. Arielle pushed open the door. The room was dim, the blinds half-closed against the weak afternoon sunlight. The steady *beep-beep-beep* of the heart monitor filled the quiet, a familiar rhythm that had become background noise over the past two years.  

And there he was.  

Liam lay in the hospital bed, looking almost exactly the same as the last time she had seen him. His face was gaunt, his skin pale against the white sheets, but his chest rose and fell in steady rhythm. His hands rested on top of the blanket, fingers relaxed.  

Sadira’s breath caught. He looked *asleep*. He had *always* looked asleep. But now… Now, there was something different. His fingers twitched every so often. His eyelids fluttered. His breathing had changed—deeper, more natural. The faint tension in his face, the barely perceptible shifts in his expression…  

Something inside Sadira’s chest squeezed.  

He was *fighting*.  

Arielle approached first, placing a gentle hand on his arm. “Hey, love,” she whispered, her voice soft, careful. “We’re here.”  

Oliver flopped into the chair at the foot of the bed, stretching his legs out. “You better wake up soon, old man. I swear, if I have to sit through another one of Mom’s experimental recipes, I might not make it.”  

Arielle shot him a glare. Oliver grinned. Sadira lingered in the doorway, her feet refusing to move.  

Arielle turned, giving her a soft, knowing look. “Come here, sweetheart.”  

Sadira swallowed hard, forcing her feet to move. She crossed the room slowly, every step heavier than the last, until she was standing at Liam’s bedside.  

He looked… smaller. Thinner than she remembered, his usually sun-kissed skin pale against the stark white sheets. The Liam she had known had been strong, steady, a presence that filled the room with warmth. Now, he seemed fragile, like a shadow of the man he once was.  

Her fingers trembled as she reached out and took his hand. It was warm. The breath she hadn’t realized she was holding slipped from her lips.  

“Hey, Liam,” she whispered. “It’s me.”  

The only response was the rhythmic beeping of the monitors. But then—  

A flicker.  

A shift in his fingers, the faintest tightening around hers.  

Sadira’s breath caught.  

“Mom—”  

“I saw it,” Arielle whispered, gripping his other hand.  

Oliver sat up straighter, his casual demeanor cracking. “Okay, that was *definitely* movement.”  

Sadira’s heart pounded as she tightened her grip. “Liam? Can you hear me?”  

Silence.  

And then—  

A twitch. The slow, sluggish flutter of his eyelids.  

Sadira’s stomach flipped. It was happening.  

Arielle sucked in a sharp breath, pressing a hand over her mouth. “Oh, gods.”  

Sadira felt like she couldn’t breathe. Another twitch. A furrow of his brow. His lips parted, a sharp inhale—shallow, shaky, like someone surfacing from deep water.  

His eyelids fluttered again, and this time, they opened. Sadira’s world stopped. For a second, there was nothing. Just hazy, unfocused eyes staring at the ceiling, blinking slowly, as if the light was too much. Then, they shifted.  

First to Arielle, Then to Oliver.  And finally, to Sadira.  Liam’s gaze was unfocused, sluggish, like he was seeing through a thick fog. His lips parted slightly, as if he wanted to speak, but no sound came out.  

“Liam?” Arielle whispered, her fingers trembling.  

He blinked. The muscles in his throat tensed. His fingers twitched again, as if trying to grasp something. Sadira squeezed his hand tighter, desperate for something more.  

“Liam, it’s me,” she whispered, her voice barely holding steady. “We’re here. You’re here.”  

His lips moved, forming something soundless. She leaned closer, her heart hammering. It was faint. So faint she almost thought she imagined it.  

But then—  

“S’… Sadira?”  

Tears burned behind her eyes. Arielle let out a choked sob. Oliver swore under his breath.  

Sadira exhaled shakily, nodding frantically. “Yeah,” she whispered, squeezing his hand. “Yeah, it’s me.”  

Liam blinked again, his gaze still unfocused, but *there*.  

“W-what…” His voice was weak, scratchy, like he hadn’t used it in years. Which, to be fair, he *hadn’t*.

Sadira bit her lip, forcing down the lump in her throat. “You… you’ve been asleep for a while.”  

His brows furrowed, the sluggish gears of his mind trying to turn. His gaze flickered between them, confusion evident in his face. Then, his grip on her hand tightened—just a little.  

“Didn’t…” He swallowed, voice barely above a whisper. “Didn’t mean to.”  

Arielle let out a soft, broken laugh. “Oh, sweetheart,” she whispered, brushing his hair back. “I know.”  

Liam’s gaze lingered on her for a long moment, something soft and tired in his eyes. Then, slowly, he turned back to Sadira.  

“You grew up.”  

Sadira let out a shaky laugh, blinking rapidly to keep the tears at bay. “Yeah,” she murmured. “It’s been a while.”  

Liam’s brows drew together slightly, like he was trying to remember.  

“How long?”  

Sadira hesitated, glancing at Arielle, who swallowed thickly before answering.  

“Two years, love.”  

Liam’s expression faltered. He opened his mouth, then closed it, his breath coming a little too fast, his grip tightening. Two years. Sadira squeezed his hand again, grounding him.  

“It’s okay,” she murmured. “You’re here now.”  

Liam swallowed, his gaze flickering between them. Then, slowly, ever so slowly, he nodded. And for the first time in two years, hope wasn’t just a dream. It was real. It was *alive*. And so was Liam.  

Liam was awake.  

The reality of that fact should have hit Sadira like a wave, should have knocked her breathless and sent relief coursing through her veins.  For two years, she had imagined this moment. Liam’s eyes were open, but they were clouded, distant. His gaze flickered across the room in slow, sluggish movements, as if he were struggling to understand what he was seeing. His fingers twitched weakly in her grasp, a barely-there presence against her skin.  

He looked *lost*. His lips parted, as if he wanted to say something, but nothing came out at first. Then, finally, in a voice so hoarse it barely sounded like him, he murmured, “Two years?”  

Oliver shifted uncomfortably, rubbing the back of his neck. “Yeah. You, uh… took a really long nap.”  

Sadira shot him a look.  

Arielle exhaled shakily. “Yes, love. Two years.”  

Liam blinked slowly, his brows knitting together. His grip on Sadira’s hand tightened, just barely, as if grounding himself.  

“I… I don’t…” He trailed off, frustration flickering across his face. “I don’t remember.”  

His voice was rough, like it had been dragged across gravel. Sadira bit the inside of her cheek to stop herself from crying. She couldn’t cry.  Not when Liam was struggling to piece himself together, not when Arielle’s hand trembled against his arm, not when Oliver had gone completely quiet for the first time in *forever*. She had to be strong. 

Arielle stroked his hair again, voice soft, soothing. “That’s okay, love. You just woke up. The doctors said your mind might take time to catch up.”  

Liam’s gaze flickered to her, searching, as if trying to find the truth in her words.  

Sadira swallowed past the lump in her throat and forced herself to speak. “You don’t have to push yourself,” she murmured. “Just… just focus on being here. With us.”  

For a long moment, Liam didn’t respond. Then, slowly, his lips curved into the faintest, exhausted smile.  

“I’m here,” he whispered.  

Arielle let out a choked sob, pressing a kiss to his forehead. “You are.”  

—

The next few hours were a blur of doctors, nurses, and endless tests.  

Liam was still weak—too weak to do much more than answer a few whispered questions and squeeze Sadira’s hand in reassurance when she looked at him like he might disappear again.  

The doctors were cautious but optimistic. His vitals were stable, his cognitive function intact, but his body was struggling to catch up. Two years of immobility had left him frail, and the road to recovery would be long.  

“We’ll need to run further tests,” the doctor explained, flipping through his clipboard as Arielle nodded along. “His muscle atrophy is significant, but expected. Speech and motor function appear intact, though we’ll monitor for any irregularities. We’ll also conduct neurological evaluations to assess any potential cognitive deficits.”  

The doctors finished their evaluations, promising to return later, and the nurses left after checking Liam’s IV and adjusting his blankets.  

Then, finally, it was just them. Arielle sat at Liam’s bedside, their hands entwined, murmuring soft reassurances. Oliver had pulled up a chair and was fidgeting with the hem of his hoodie, clearly unsure of what to say. Sadira stood at the foot of the bed, staring at Liam. It had only been a few hours since he had woken up, but she was already terrified he would slip away again.  

Liam must have noticed because he gave her the smallest, tired smile. “You’re staring.”  

Sadira let out a shaky breath. “Yeah. Yeah, I am.”  

Liam huffed a quiet laugh, but it was weak, barely there. “I must look awful.”  

Oliver snorted. “You look *terrible*.”  

Arielle shot him a look, but Liam chuckled—*actually chuckled*, raspy and small but real.  

Sadira felt something in her chest unclench.  

“You’re okay,” she murmured.  

Liam’s expression softened. “Yeah, kiddo,” he whispered. “I’m okay.”  

And for the first time, Sadira let herself believe that, too.  

—

Liam was awake.  

The words still felt fragile, like glass that could shatter at any moment if Sadira held onto them too tightly. For two years, his hospital room had been filled with silence, interrupted only by the steady beeping of machines and the hushed voices of doctors delivering updates that never changed. Two years of sitting beside his bed, trying not to lose hope, trying not to let the weight of waiting crush her.  

And now, here he was.  

Breathing. Talking. *Alive*.  

Arielle hadn’t let go of his hand since the moment he opened his eyes. She kept brushing her fingers through his hair, like she needed to reassure herself that he was real. Oliver, for once, had nothing sarcastic to say—just quiet relief, barely masked behind his usual easygoing front.  

And Sadira? She didn’t know what to do. She wanted to say something, *anything*, but all the words stuck in her throat. What did you even say to someone who had been gone for two years?  

“Alright,” Oliver finally said, exhaling a breath that sounded like it had been held for hours. “We need to celebrate or something. Mom, is this a ‘break out the good stuff’ situation, or do we stick to sparkling cider for our miracle resurrection?”  

Arielle gave him a look, but there was no real reprimand behind it. If anything, there was the tiniest hint of amusement. “Oliver, we are in a hospital.”  

“So? You think the doctors are gonna complain? ‘Oh no, they’re *too happy* that their loved one woke up from a coma. How dare they.’”  

Liam let out a breathy, tired chuckle, and Sadira’s stomach flipped at the sound. It was quiet, weak, nothing like the warm, booming laugh she remembered—but it was *his*. It was enough.  

Arielle sniffled, wiping at the corner of her eye. “We’ll celebrate properly when we get home,” she murmured, smoothing her hand over Liam’s. “But Oliver’s right—we should do something. *Anything.*”  

Oliver grinned. 

Liam’s lips twitched, the corners curling into the faintest, exhausted smile. “I think,” he rasped, “I’d just like… to be here. With all of you.”  

Arielle’s expression softened. “Of course, love. Of course.”  

Sadira swallowed the lump in her throat, nodding. No party. No big gestures.  Just them.  

---

### **Relearning Each Other**  

The next few hours passed in a blur.  

Liam was exhausted—his body barely holding onto the energy it needed to stay awake—but he refused to close his eyes for long. Every time his lids drooped, he forced them back open, like he was afraid he’d disappear again if he let himself fall asleep.  

Sadira understood the feeling all too well.  

They didn’t talk about anything heavy—no questions about his coma, no expectations for him to remember anything just yet. Instead, they stuck to the little things. Arielle caught him up on what had changed around the house—how she had moved some of the furniture (only to move it back because it didn’t feel right), how she had kept his study *exactly* as he had left it, how she had refused to let anything feel like he was *gone*. Oliver talked about school, filling in the silence with exaggerated stories of teachers he hated, pranks he had pulled, fights he had *totally* won (Sadira doubted that), and the fact that he had nearly burned the kitchen down *twice* trying to cook.  

Liam smiled at that—fond, tired. “You always did have a talent for chaos.”  

Oliver placed a hand over his heart. “You honor me, dad.”  

Sadira, for the most part, just listened. She wanted to talk—she *really* did—but every time she opened her mouth, she felt like she might break. She had so much to say. So much that had been left unsaid over the past two years. 

But not yet. For now, she let herself sit beside him, feeling the warmth of his presence, listening to the steady rhythm of his breathing. Because after two years of silence, this was enough.  

It wasn’t until later—hours later, when Liam had been checked and re-checked by every doctor in the building—that they were finally told he could be discharged.  

Arielle had fought hard for it. The doctors were hesitant. They wanted to keep him for observation, to make sure his body was adjusting properly. But Arielle had given them a look that *no one* in their right mind would argue with, and eventually, they relented.  

“You’ll need to come in for regular check-ups,” the doctor warned, flipping through his clipboard. “Physical therapy will be necessary to rebuild muscle strength, and there’s still a lot we don’t know about his condition—”  

“Yes, yes, I understand,” Arielle said briskly. “But my husband is *coming home*.”  

Sadira could have sworn Liam looked relieved at that.  So, just like that, after two years of waiting, Liam was coming home.  

--- 

The house felt different.  

Not in the way that things had physically changed—no, Arielle had kept almost everything exactly as it had been, a shrine to the life they had lost.  

But with Liam standing in the doorway again, breathing in the familiar air, pressing a hand against the worn wood of the banister—*everything* felt different.  

Sadira stood behind him, watching as he took it all in.  

His fingers trailed lightly over the walls, the furniture, the bookshelves filled with the same dusty novels he had collected for years. There was something almost reverent about the way he touched things, like he was rediscovering parts of himself that had been locked away.  

Arielle hovered close, eyes shining with unshed tears. Oliver leaned against the doorway, arms crossed, trying to act *too cool* to be emotional—but Sadira could see it in his face. The relief. The weight lifting.  

Liam turned, looking at them.  

“I’m home,” he murmured.  

Arielle let out a soft, shaky breath. “Yes, love,” she whispered. “You are.”  

Sadira clenched her jaw. She wasn’t going to cry. Not now. She just took a step forward, hesitated—then, before she could stop herself, she *hugged* him.  

It wasn’t careful. It wasn’t hesitant. It was fierce, desperate, a tangle of limbs and trembling hands gripping onto his shirt like he might disappear if she let go. Liam stiffened for half a second—then his arms wrapped around her, just as tight.  

“I missed you,” she mumbled against him.  

Liam’s breath hitched. “I missed you too, kiddo.”  

Arielle joined in next, wrapping her arms around both of them, pressing a kiss to Liam’s temple. Oliver, ever the reluctant one, sighed dramatically,vthen pulled them into a very reluctant group hug.  

“Fine,” he muttered. “But only because you’ve been gone for *forever*.”  

Liam chuckled, voice rough but warm. Sadira squeezed her eyes shut.  

For the first time in two years, the house didn’t feel empty anymore. Liam was home.  

And everything finally, *finally* felt right again.

The cuddler in me wishes I was home next to her. Cuddling. Holding eachother. Spooning in bed. Listening to the rain drops hit the roof. 

The lover in me wishes we were making love to the sound of the pitter patter. Making our own thunder claps while it pours outside. Passio, lust, and a hunger for eachothers bodies. 

The anxious introvert in me wishes I was home alone today. Smoking a bowl and spending the day masturbating because I know that what I have to resort to. Just me and my hand. 

The realist in me knows none of that will happen. A rainy Wednesday morning at work, hoping and wishing for a million different things. Mainly..just to be wanted. So I’ll just keep sipping my coffee at my desk while listening to the rain.

Cellist

I have played the cello for ~10 years now, learning all sorts of pieces: Haydn, Saint-Saens, Dvořák, Vivaldi… also do pop and ethnic music. I performed around Atlanta, sometimes for money, sometimes to volunteer. First chair of school orchestra as well. Mostly focused on self-study. Out of all my EC’s this was my favorite to do — I love playing so so much. 

Quiz Bowl Team, Captain

I like to know random shit about random shit. That’s why I joined Quiz Bowl. Any more info would give me away 


Internship at Coffee Company

I learned how coffee is made, shipped, produced. Also visited and stayed a coffee farm.

Varsity Swim

Even though I’m kinda bad at swimming, I learned to love swimming 500m. Also was one of the butterflieer. 

Chess Club, Co-Founder

After the chess club died before my freshman year, I revived it in grade 10. Not much to be said here, hosted a chess tournament once upon a time. Also volunteered in an elementary school to teach children the game of chess and to get them passionate.

Conversations Club, Pres. 

Basically a club where we yap about issues affecting our world. As a D1 yapper, I naturally had to lead this club.

Philosophy Club

Love philosophy too, but didn’t found this one. Read William James in club, read Augustine, Marx, Plato, Kant, Hegel, Smith, etc. out of class. 

Russian 

Learned Russian from 0-B2 over the course of high school. Can now somewhat comfortably read Tolstoy with some effort.

Language Club, Founder & Pres

Made a language exchange space for the school to promote diversity in language. Basically, we learned basic phrases in each others’ languages, compared common words, etc. 

(I’m leaving my last one out because it would immediately identify me.)

Awards: Nothing much, really. May have gotten fried here. 

Essays: Common App essay was pretty good, just wrote it about how the 4 languages I know well have contributed to different aspects of my life. Not the worst idea at all. My supplementals were also pretty good imo, I answered the questions and did it with some personal flair? I think they were as good as any. Could have been a little better had I not procrastinated just a lil bit. Maybe Overall 8/10.

1jpm8eh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jpm8eh/aita_for_hindering_my_flatmates/,AITA for hindering my flatmates,"I built a house and have housemates(paying considerably cheaper rent) living with me as I work away, and prefer someone to be at the house for security and the extra money is extra coin in my pocket at the end of the day.

I'm a single guy, late 20s and work away in a well paying job. I've got a couple living with me and I'm nervous I've overshot the mark by removing the lead to the theatre TV where they spend majority of their time while I'm away at work.

For context, they have their own bathroom and end of the house and I havent cooked for myself or watched anything in the theatre for over 12 months as I feel I shouldn't need to ask for use of the kitchen or theatre when I'm home. I understand it's their house too, they pay to live there and I spend majority of my time outside in the shed working on whatever projects, drinking beers and smokin cigarettes.

However whenever I want to cook or use the theatre I would have to ask for them to move somewhere else and its driving me insane, so I remove myself and go to the shed, even if I have guests.

I am the only one that looks after outside. Whether it be mowing lawns, pruning trees, weeding gardens, picking up leaves or maintaining retic sprinklers, everything. I often mop floors, unstuck the dishwasher, dust or whatever just to keep the house in a tidy, respectable fashion. I don't know how often they do this as I work away but it seems to be the same state as when I lived alone.

I pulled the plug to the TV in the theatre(still have a nice loungesuite) and hid it before I went to work as I believe that's the reason nothing is being achieved in the house. They cook tea and leave dishes and whatever else in the sink with oil all over the benches and make it a nuisance to use while they're watching TV in the theatre(they do clean up before bed but that's after when I'd like to eat).

Their bathroom is always full of her beauty stuff and whatever all over the vanity which have the sole use of. I understand she's a woman and they need this stuff to doll themselves up, look after their skin, whatever, and that's fine, but why can she not put them away and remove the coffee cups, open blocks of chocolate, hair clips, hair removal etc stuff and put it away. I have gone to others house instead of inviting them over because I'm house proud and don't like people using the bathroom/toilet in the state it's in.

I cannot imagine what the house looks like while I'm away so I try not to build an image. Theyre nice people but have never accepted responsibility for anything. ""Bins not being full enough to take out"" so they stink the property out, 'Forgetting bin day' etc. Theres always an excuse and I'm starting to think im being taken advantage of. Please give some guidance because they're really nice people, but I have given years of my life away for this house, and to have it not respected for the relatively cheap price they're paying seems a bit of a joke.",4,1743593246.0,AmItheAsshole,19,1.0,False

1jpm7eu,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1jpm7eu/my_dad_went_from_being_the_breadwinner_of_the/,My dad went from being the breadwinner of the family to plunging himself into debt.,"I (F18) don’t know where to start… This nightmare first began when my dad reunited with an old friend (let’s call him C) from his secondary school days. The three of us then met at a coffee shop back in 2023, where C lamented about his past struggles with gambling and depression.

I probably should have seen this as a red flag, but what made C seem like a good person to me was the fact that he had ""eventually held himself accountable and turned over a new leaf"". What’s more is that C also had a ""wife and daughter"", so I was further touched by his efforts to save his ""family"". Why so many quote, unquote one? Well, C likely had none of these to begin with.

Shortly after our meetup at the coffee shop, my dad would continue to exchange messages with C online. One day, C started asking my dad to sign up for sketchy investments; claiming that they could both benefit financially from them. What’s worse is that—without telling my mum and I—he would proceed to trust C and continuously sign up for said schemes throughout the span of AN ENTIRE YEAR.

Come April 2024, my dad would persuade me to accompany him to Bugis, refusing to elaborate further. ""You’ll find out how important this is, so please follow me."" There, we entered the office of a financial advisor—and I had to grapple with the discovery that my dad had brought upon himself an accumulated debt of over $50k. I come from a lower-middle income family, so this amount is considered overwhelmingly high for us.

In the end, my dad’s credit score drastically plummeted to HH. He also owed banks a hefty sum and thus had his cards banned. Not long after, he filed for bankruptcy and applied to be in a 5-year-long debt relief plan by CCS to gradually pay off his debt. CCS helped to alleviate the debt payment process by enabling my family to afford daily expenses while still remaining ""financially stable"". The efforts are there but my dad appears to take CCS for granted. Recently, he had to ask my mum to transfer $150+ over so he could pay for my paternal grandma’s hospital visit. (His monthly salary ranges from $3.5k to $4.5k, and my mum expects him to have savings in case of emergencies)

My mum was livid, complaining to me about how miserable he must be to be unable to afford his own mother’s expenses. She then started making assumptions about my dad consistently betting on the lottery—both 4D and private—whilst paying for daily expenses, hence resulting in the lack of savings. This sounds believable, because I often hear my dad and grandma talking about TOTO. It’s just saddening to think that he’s still clinging onto the lottery even in debt, with the glimmer of hope that he could one day win. It’s not entirely impossible, but he definitely needs to tone down.

But thank you for coming this far. You could say I got off the track towards the end, but I thought I may as well include everything that’s bothering me at the moment. Anyway, all these problems would not have happened had C not scammed my dad. It’s extremely infuriating because C had fabricated an entire sob story, made himself out to be an inspiration, and offered to pay for Din Tai Fung on a separate occasion. At that time, my dad had already started signing C’s filthy schemes, so C could very well have paid for DTF using my dad’s money.



TLDR: Dad got scammed >50k by old friend from their secondary school days. Dad had to file for bankruptcy and enrol in a 5-year-long debt relief plan. Dad continues to gamble his savings away in hopes of winning the lottery one day. My family is falling apart and I’m tired.

More context: Dad already filed a police report against C with no updates for the time being. The kind of investments my dad signed up for landed him with 7 different, unused phone lines from SingTel. Every month, he has to pay for each individual phone bill. The lines are all under his ownership, but he has access to none of them. It’s also multiple contracts with SingTel so he can’t just cut them off.",27,1743593145.0,SGExams,7,1.0,False

1jpm16f,https://v.redd.it/iur9kh9qnese1,How do you know if a strategy is worth pursuing?,"How to Know if a Strategy is Worth Pursuing: A Comprehensive Guide

In the business world, success often hinges on the strategies you choose to pursue. A brilliant strategy can propel your organization to new heights, while a poorly chosen one can waste time, money, and momentum. But how do you know if a strategy is worth pursuing? That’s where careful evaluation comes into play. This guide provides actionable steps, real-world examples, and proven frameworks to help you decide whether to commit to a strategy—or gracefully abandon it.

What Makes a Strategy Worth Pursuing?
At its core, a great strategy aligns with your goals, is grounded in data, and demonstrates a realistic chance of success. Think of evaluating a strategy as packing for a long journey. You want to ensure you have the essentials and a clear destination before hitting the road.

Key Criteria to Evaluate Your Strategy
1. Alignment with Goals and Vision
The first step in determining if a strategy is worth pursuing is to evaluate how well it aligns with your long-term objectives. Ask yourself:

Does this strategy move us closer to achieving our overall vision?
Is it consistent with our values, mission, and priorities?

For example, if your company is focused on sustainability, pursuing a strategy that increases your carbon footprint—even if it’s profitable—might not align with your mission.

Pro Tip: Use tools like a Balanced Scorecard to map how the strategy contributes to organizational goals across key areas such as finance, customer experience, operations, and learning.

2. Market and Competitive Analysis
No strategy exists in isolation. You need to understand the external environment to gauge its viability. Consider the following:

Demand: Is there sufficient demand for the initiative or product this strategy supports?
Competition: What are competitors doing in this space? Are they succeeding, or is there room for differentiation?
Trends: Does this strategy align with broader market trends, or is it likely to become obsolete in the near future?

Real-World Example: Imagine a small coffee chain planning to expand into plant-based beverages. A market analysis might show increasing demand for oat milk lattes and minimal competition in their area—indicating the strategy is worth exploring.

3. Feasibility and Resource Availability
Even the best ideas can fail if you don’t have the resources to execute them. Evaluate:

Budget: Do you have the financial capacity to implement and sustain this strategy?
People: Do you have a skilled team to carry out the plan?
Time: Does this initiative fit within your current priorities and timelines?

Real-World Example: A tech startup might decide to pursue a strategy of entering a new market but discovers it lacks a dedicated sales team for the region. This might signal the need to adjust the strategy or delay its execution until the necessary resources are secured.

Pro Tip: Conduct a Resource Audit to identify gaps in funding, expertise, or time before moving forward.

4. Risk Assessment
Every strategy carries risks, but the key is to quantify and plan for them in advance.

Ask yourself:

What are the potential risks associated with this strategy?
Are these risks manageable or severe?
Do you have a contingency plan in case things go wrong?

Example: A retail brand considering a move into e-commerce might face risks such as cybersecurity threats or high upfront costs. By conducting a risk analysis and planning mitigations (e.g., investing in secure platforms), the company can minimize potential damage.

Tools You Can Use:

Scenario Planning: Explore best-case, worst-case, and most-likely scenarios.
Risk Matrix: Plot risks based on their likelihood and impact to prioritize mitigation efforts.

5. Return on Investment (ROI)
Finally, calculate the potential payoff of the strategy. ROI isn’t just about financial returns; consider intangible benefits like improved brand reputation, customer loyalty, or employee morale.

To calculate financial ROI, use this formula:

ROI (%) = [(Net Profit - Investment Cost) / Investment Cost] x 100

Real-World Example: A company investing $50,000 in a social media marketing strategy might forecast $150,000 in revenue from increased leads and sales. Using the formula:

ROI = [($150,000 - $50,000) / $50,000] x 100 = 200%

In this case, the ROI suggests the strategy is worth pursuing.

How to Test a Strategy Before Committing Fully
If you’re uncertain about committing fully, testing on a smaller scale can save time and money.

1. Pilot Projects
Test the strategy in a specific department, region, or customer segment to gather real-world data.

Example: A restaurant might try a new menu item at one location before rolling it out chain-wide.

2. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
For product-focused strategies, launch a simplified version of the offering to gauge market interest.

3. Gather Feedback and Iterate
Collect feedback from stakeholders, employees, or early adopters. Use these insights to refine the strategy and identify potential issues before scaling up.

When Should You Abandon a Strategy?
Not every strategy is meant to succeed. Knowing when to walk away is just as important as deciding to pursue one.

Consider abandoning a strategy if:

It consistently drains resources without showing measurable progress.
External conditions, such as market changes or new regulations, render it irrelevant.
Internal feedback reveals significant flaws or resistance to implementation.

Final Thoughts
A strategy is worth pursuing if it aligns with your goals, fits your resources, and shows a clear potential for impact. By taking the time to evaluate thoroughly—considering feasibility, market demand, risks, and ROI—you can avoid costly missteps and focus your energy where it matters most. The key to success isn’t just in taking action but in taking the right action.

I almost immediately started feeling ""suppression"" and also nausea, I'm talking within literally 2 hours. I put ""suppression"" in inverted commas because I don't actually know if what I'm feeling is suppression or if its the nausea making me not want to eat anything. The nausea isn't terrible, but it's enough to make me feel sorry for myself! So far today (posting this at midday) I've only been able to force myself to eat 1 strawberry, 2 raspberries, 2 grapes and one light babybel, haven't even been able to manage my usual morning coffee. I didn't eat breakfast or lunch yesterday, but I snacked on lots of high protein snacks throughout the day, and had a decent dinner. I did feel less nauseous after eating that, but it quickly came back. I finished yesterday on about 1000 calories, which I know isn't enough, but I couldn't face eating anything else to get my calories up. I've calculated my TDEE which says I need 1908 calories to maintain my weight, or 1408 to lose 0.5kg a week.

So I guess I have three questions:  
1) How do I know if my nausea is caused by not eating enough, or if its just a side effect?

2) How do I know if my inability to eat is caused by suppression, or nausea?

3) Is it likely for the nausea to go away soon?

1jpluq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1jpluq4/chaos_and_obsession_finally_out/,Chaos and obsession - finally out,"This is my first Reddit post, largely to put on record my story before it fades away in my memory as the pain and confusion stemming from my 6-year relationship with a BPD person subside (well, hopefully sooner, rather than later). Here it is:

I met her when I was still married with two kids. The marriage was falling apart. She made the first move and invited me for a coffee (later admitted she was secretly infatuated with me in our work environment). At our second date, she proposed to scrub my body in a Hammam (and she did so – nothing sexual but sensual for sure). I was puzzled as she was in a (long-distance) relationship too (boyfriend based in another European country). And I was puzzled because nobody ever did anything like that for me (after two dates!).

That’s when the love bombing started. Sex was great and our talks deep. In short, I fell in love with her, madly and obsessively. We started planning our future (difficult considering the circumstances). One day, however, she abruptly left for her boyfriend, telling me while already at the airport. In a couple of weeks, she flew back to say goodbye.

Her impulsivity was crazy from day one (she had even made a tattoo with my initials during our good-bye days before she left for good – or so I thought). I was devastated as I believed I lost my soulmate, someone really special. Soon after, I had a brain haemorrhage that I luckily survived without major health consequences. I spent two weeks in a hospital though, including ICU. I am sure this love turmoil contributed to the rupture of the aneurysm.   

Fast forward one year: We re-connected and she left her boyfriend and moved to my country. My divorce is being finalized. But things start to unravel. After only two three months, she cheats on me and abruptly leaves for another man, claiming I have not detached enough from my soon to be ex-wife. Invoking “my chaos” for her instability and self-sabotage. I’m devastated. Dealing also with the new situation of having my kids only every second weekend.

Two months later, she’s back and I forgive her. Things are good for a while but she starts getting caught in episodes of anger. She has meltdowns, and she initiates mini-breakups. She also gets violent at several occasions. This is new; while there had been signals of that behaviour, they never unfolded.

Although she always apologizes deeply after attacking me, I start to crack as all I need at that time is some stability in my life. We plan to move in together but as I give notice to my landlady, she changes her mind and had no place to go. Most of the time, I’m staying in her studio.

After one year and a half, I got an offer to relocate abroad again for work. I propose to start over and better but she gets a tantrum and refuses to follow me (even though she hates her job at that time).    

It’s early 2020, shortly before the COVID pandemic, and I’m a new country with a new job. I still love her (trauma bond?) and, eventually, I persuade her to follow me. Things are good at the beginning but she struggles to find a job in the new place. Also, the past cracks are always there. She is also fixated on marriage and having a baby and “having a common project”. There is flipping. There is gaslighting. There is a lot of self-sabotage. She starts a therapy to treat her childhood traumas (however, she’s not diagnosed with BPD).

When she is pregnant, she has a meltdown and deep anxiety and lashes out against me, saying she does not want the baby. I’m deeply hurt as we have tried so hard to conceive. I isolate myself and not long after, we have a miscarriage. I feel fragile and doubt about the marriage (proposing engagement instead), which triggers a meltdown and recurrent blaming. There is violence and verbal abuse, regular threats of a breakup from her side. Blaming is more regular as are endless discussions, in which I feel that I’m losing touch with reality.

But there are also good moments and we start an IVF. We also get married. One IVF is successful only to lead to another miscarriage, unfortunately. We are grieving. At the same time, my two kids are with me for vacation and I can’t cope with everything. Still, she accuses me of always prioritising my family. This is the final blow and final meltdown. Even though we start a couple therapy and agree on having a set number of sessions before having a dinner and discuss our future, she admits along the way that she “invited” someone “for a coffee” and it’s over.

At that point, I’m just a shell of my old self with the self-esteem of a doormat. I doubt about my reality, puzzled by constant blaming and crushed by twisted narratives, constant walking on eggshells to avoid conflict etc. I’m finally furious and stand for myself, calling out her dysfunction and her treatment. She moves out within a few days.

Today, it’s been about three months of separation. I avoid contact with her but we still need to deal with the divorce paperwork. I’m healing slowly but it is much better than in early weeks of the separation (only three hours of sleep, anxiety attacks, processing the trauma). I have started a therapy. Only now I have a clearer picture of the last six years. It’s as if I lived in a fog, denying myself and my needs, dissolving all my boundaries. Allowing myself to feel anger for the damage she caused helps. Yet, there are still days I miss her badly (when balanced, she was the most generous and caring person I have ever met). But I’m finally prioritise my own wellbeing. Deep down I know that it would never work long term.

I’m so happy I have discovered this forum. Such an epiphany! Paradoxically, after the final discard I discovered some notes I had made after the first discard where I had speculated about her BPD. Somehow, I erased this from my mind and only re-discovered it one month after the she moved out.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the beautiful game, where David meets Goliath, and in this case, Goliath is wearing Benfica red and David, well, he's just hoping to make it through the match without too much embarrassment. As Benfica hosts Farense at the Estadio da Luz, the odds are about as lopsided as a seesaw with an elephant on one end and a mouse on the other.

Benfica is priced at a paltry 1.1 to win, which is about as close to a sure thing as you'll find outside of your morning coffee being too hot. Meanwhile, Farense is sitting at a whopping 21.0, which is essentially the bookmakers' way of saying, ""Good luck with that.""

Benfica has been on a domestic tear, winning their last eight matches and making the Estadio da Luz a fortress. Farense, conversely, has been struggling to find the back of the net, or any semblance of form, for that matter. They've failed to win in their last 12 outings, which is a streak that would make even the most optimistic fan reach for a stiff drink.

The bookmakers are offering a -2.0 goal spread for Benfica at 1.83, and honestly, that seems like a gift. Benfica has been scoring for fun, and with Farense's defense leakier than a sieve, a three-goal margin doesn't seem out of reach.

So, what's the best bet here? Take Benfica with the -2.0 goal handicap at 1.83. It's like betting on the sun rising tomorrow—sure, it could go wrong, but you'd have to be in a parallel universe for that to happen. Enjoy the match, and remember, sometimes the house wins, but in this case, it's Benfica doing the winning.

I started my slightly bigger than 3x3x3 pile last Summer. It heated up to 120°. I guess I over watered it when I turned it in late Fall because it froze solid all Winter.

It had shrunk down about a foot when I turned it this Spring. When I turned it I incorporated a winter's worth of kitchen scraps from my tumbler that were well on their way plus 10 gallons of coffee grounds. 

Turning it increased the mass back to the full 3x3x3 for just a little while, then it quickly shrunk almost a foot down.

So to add more mass I topped her off with 2 yard waste bags of mowed leaves I'd saved. That seemed to help bump the temp up from 100° to 105°.

My intention for the next time I turn it is to carefully set aside that top 1 foot of leaves and use them to top it off again after I turn it. I also figure that if 10 gallons of coffee grounds heated it to 105°, next time I'll try 20 gallons. 

Enlighten me with your wisdom please. Am I on the right path to getting her done in time to top dress my garden beds late Fall? At what temperature would you turn it? When it starts going down or when it's reached ambient temperature or something in between? Does 20 gallons of coffee grounds seem reasonable?

1jplsgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1jplsgr/three_months_ago_i_would_have_written_a_tale_of/,"Three months ago, I would have written a tale of success.","Three months ago, I would have waxed poetic about how after years of pain and suffering, we had found our balance. That balance was once, maybe twice a month - but it was balance, and I was so happy. I felt so at ease again. I felt loved and valued as a person again. It had been nearly a year of this balance, and I felt so good about us. We would not make it to a year.

Three weeks ago, I would have posted a more cautionary story. One where I acknowledged that, while this months-long dry bout was tortuous, his willingness to tell me ""I'm not feeling it right now, I'm far too stressed, I do not know when I will feel more up to it and I'm sorry"" was a miracle in and of itself that gave me hope. That communication was, ultimately, what I craved even more than physical contact. If we weren't having sex, that we could at least talk about it was a trophy I would gladly showcase.

Four days ago, I had no poetry to write. I told him that I was struggling with the feeling of rejection. That these stretches of isolation ate at my core and made me ill. That knowing he was still getting himself off, but couldn't be bothered to involve me, felt deeply personal. He reassured me, but the inner turmoil only quieted somewhat.

Three days ago, I spoke aloud what I should have written here instead. He called me in to ask for coffee; fresh evidence of his recent self-satisfaction littered around the room. I froze. He asked what was wrong, and then yelled, demanding I divulge what was distressing while I begged and insisted I had no desire to disclose it and that I was fine. He yelled again, and I begged - ""please, if I tell you, don't be upset. don't make me feel stupid for saying it"" - and then it came rushing out, years of surpressed pain and irritation from the unrelenting rejections that were always wholly my fault, in a short ""I'm so sorry it just really hurts to see the lube next to your bed right after I told you that this rejection hurts so much and I just don't want to see it please I'm sorry"".

Three days ago, he told me we were done. Two days and twenty-three hours ago, he backtracked. Two days and seventeen hours ago, he told me I was disgusting and repulsive and he would never have sex with me again, and I told him that was nothing new. Two days ago, he told me he loved me. One day and twelve hours ago, he told me he could not see us being together. One day ago, he told me he could not wait for our trip this summer. Twelve hours ago, he told me he hated me.

Five weeks from now is our wedding. I think this post is my vows. I have nothing left to write.",7,1743591623.0,DeadBedrooms,4,1.0,False

I don’t have an iron deficency, and I dont have gestational diabetes either. Anyway, I woke up this morning, had oatmeal for breakfast and a cup of coffee as per usual. I went back to bed because I felt exhausted again, and just lied down scrolling my phone. After an hour or so I had to puke, and ran to the toilet only to have the most insane vomiting session of my life. My entire body hurt from the pressure of it jesus christ. 

I though maybe I had eaten too much? So i went back to bed, still very nauseaus. After a few hours I felt hungry and had two pieces of toast. It’s been like 2 hours since I ate and I still feel horrible. I feel hungover almost. 

I also noticed the past week I’ve had blurry vision, as if i’m suddenly nearsighted and that has made me feel sort of extra loopy and out of place together with the fatigue. But now vomiting? I took my nausea meds as normal before breakfast, but i still feel like shit.

I recently found this sub and felt like sharing my issue. I'm a 28-year-old male, 5'9"" tall, and currently weigh 84 kg. I’ve generally stayed fit and have tried different sports over the years. However, over the past year, due to a heavy workload, I’ve gained quite a bit of weight.

I’ve recently joined a gym and the trainer seems good. My goal is to reach around 72–73 kg. While he has recommended a comprehensive diet plan, I’m considering starting by cutting my calorie intake to use the stored fat for energy. I’ve followed this approach before and it worked well for fat loss.

Here’s my current diet plan:

Morning (upon waking): One cup of black coffee (no sugar)

Post-workout: Juice made with spinach, bottle gourd (lauki), ginger, and lemon

Lunch (after a few hours): Two rotis, dal, three spoonfuls of curd, and one vegetable dish

Evening snack: One banana

Dinner (late night): One roti, three spoonfuls of curd, one vegetable dish, and a glass of double toned milk with turmeric


I plan to follow this routine for at least one to two weeks, primarily to burn stored fat. After that, I’ll gradually move to a heavier diet

I have three months to achieve my weight loss goal, as I have a few very important events coming up. After that, I may not be able to continue going to the gym regularly, although I do plan to maintain home workouts.

Please let me know if this is a good approach, or if there are any changes I should make based on my timeline and goals. Your suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",1,1743591012.0,indianfitness,0,1.0,False

Today I come to the realization that I don’t even know myself. I always thought i was weak because that’s what I heard starting from my childhood, and i never really defended myself, just brush it off with jokes and laugh. That’s basically becoming my coping mechanisms, but my last 4 year relationship broke me beyond that I can handle. I became moody, irritable, easily bored by people even if it’s a relationship, I suspect the bad things happen, and when this happens I completely detached from that person because I don’t want to be hurt, but because of this I can’t feel true happiness, and it’s just making me more sour, cuz i still remember times when I was truly happy(sadly mostly not because of peoples, rather games and some achievements, but it’s also don’t happening anymore). I feel like i am a shell, a void of myself, constantly worrying about that i am going to perish, don’t know what i really want, and today I realized that I didn’t even know myself, and I can’t letting things going like this anymore. 

Anyone can gave me anything in advice? I tried pills (scippa, helping with my serotonin, keeping my mind and panic attacks at bay), i went to psychiatrist, psychologist, I tried to be alone but I hated it because I was mostly alone, but I couldn’t really handle relationships because my trust issues and because I constantly scanning my partner when she is genuine or not, and I can’t break this endless spiraling abyss. I don’t want to go self-bye because that’s ain’t my cup of coffee, but I want to feel free without these weights, and feel true happiness and calmness again.

Thanks!

Known for its high resin production, balanced hybrid effects, and resilient nature, it's a great choice for both medicinal and recreational growers.

Here’s a full guide on how to grow White Widow seeds — covering germination to harvest, with seed bank recs (shoutout to **SeedSupreme**) and a few cultivar options thrown in.

## What Is White Widow?

White Widow is a 60/40 sativa-dominant hybrid (sometimes found in 50/50 versions depending on breeder) created in the '90s by Green House Seeds. It's a cross between Brazilian sativa and South Indian indica, and it's been a staple of Dutch coffee shops ever since.

**Key traits:**

* High THC: 18–25%
* Flowering time: \~8–10 weeks
* Yield: 400–500g/m² indoors
* Height: Medium
* Difficulty: Easy to moderate
* Flavor: Earthy, pine, citrus, and a spicy kick
* Effects: Euphoric, creative, energetic — then chill

## Choosing the Right White Widow Seeds:

There are a few versions of White Widow out there. SeedSupreme is one of the best seed banks I’ve used (fast shipping, stealth, good selection), and they offer several WW variants:

* **White Widow Feminized – by ILGM or Seedsman**
   * Great for indoor or outdoor. Fem seeds = no dudes.
* **White Widow Autoflower – by Fast Buds or Dutch Passion**
   * Best for quick harvests. Autoflowers = no light schedule flipping.
* **CBD White Widow – by Seedsman**
   * Lower THC, higher CBD for medical use.

## Germination & Early Growth:

**Step 1: Germination**

* Use the paper towel method or drop directly into water until you see a taproot.
* Ideal temp: 70–85°F (21–29°C)
* Humidity: \~70%

**Step 2: Seedling Stage**

* Use a light soil mix (no hot nutrients).
* Keep lights (LEDs or CFLs) \~18 inches above.
* 18/6 light schedule.
* Water with care — seedlings hate overwatering.

## Vegging White Widow:

White Widow loves light and training. During veg:

* Keep RH around 50–60%
* Temp: 70–80°F
* Use LST or topping to create more colas — she responds well to training.
* Nutrients: Start light with NPK ratios heavy on Nitrogen (like 3-1-2).
* pH: Keep between 6.0–6.5 for soil, or 5.8–6.2 for hydro.

## Flowering Time:

When you flip to 12/12 (or when autos naturally flower), expect:

* Flowering period: 8–10 weeks
* Smell: She gets LOUD — carbon filter is a must.
* Buds: Dense, sugar-coated with trichomes. They don't call her ""White"" Widow for nothing.

**Nutrient shift:**

* Less Nitrogen, more Phosphorus & Potassium (bloom nutes like 1-3-2)
* Keep RH around 40–50% to avoid mold.

## Harvest & Curing:

**When to harvest:**

* 70–75 days post-flip (on average)
* White pistils turning orange
* Trichomes 70% cloudy, 10–20% amber

**Drying:**

* Temp: 60–70°F
* RH: 50%
* Hang-dry for 7–14 days

**Curing:**

* Jar buds, burp daily for 1–2 weeks, then less frequently for 4–8 weeks.

1jplb60,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jplb60/hr_lazerus/,[HR] Lazerus,"Nothing left but a reminiscent glimpse of something that used to be a home.

Dust settled, lamps shine through the omnipresent piles of leftovers and bottles.

A perverted landscape of negligence, in which the only clean place remains this computer.

Days pass like a long, sleepless night and turn into months in this prolonged, grotesque fever dream you hope to be awakened from.



Losing someone, most of the time, comes with the cost of losing a part of your dignity, but this time was different.

Normally, you get a kind of enclosure, but when someone vanishes from the face of the Earth to get swallowed into the endless pages of history,

to remain as a staining footnote on yourself, the gaping wound which ought to be healed, never closes.



The best thing under these circumstances is to focus your attention on something else, so I sought something to distract myself.

I found something, a chatroom. I’d never been the talkative type, but in these times you tend to seek any straw you can grab.

Since I wasn’t able to get outside, because I didn’t want to see anybody, this opportunity was perfect.

In the depths of the Internet, everyone is anonymous if they desire to be so, and the sheer number of chatrooms promises the desperately needed distraction.



If you’ve ever been to one of those sites where you just chat, you know what I’m talking about when I say that it’s a cesspool of broken dreams and an example of failed society.

For those who don’t, it’s a complete mess of bots, predators, and internet trolls. In the midst of this, sometimes, there is a normal person you can talk to.

I was searching for those. And after a period of weeks, I found a small but active group of friends I could talk to.



For the first time in months since she disappeared, I felt some kind of connection to anyone, and this gave me hope to withstand the pain.

They taught me how to recognize the bots and weirdos so I could avoid them. For the most part, detecting bots wasn’t that hard—they just spam a halfway normal sentence to get your attention for a scheme or so.

From time to time, you’ll find a better-programmed bot which can have whole conversations with you, and it’s kinda impressive how human they can appear.



After a month in this chatroom, I’d become a regular and was able to get into a mentoring program so I could teach the newcomers the rules of the site and filter out the spambots.

At this time, a user by the name of Lazarus logged onto the chatroom. He asked if anyone wanted to chat but got ignored every time. He spammed, so everyone thought he was probably a bot. But something inside of me told me that he was a real human being.



So I answered his invitation, I wrote:



Lazarus: How are you?

Trvltime: I’m fine, and you?

Lazarus: Me too.

Lazarus: What’s the time?

Trvltime: What do you mean? Doesn’t your computer have a built-in clock on the screen?

Lazarus: Yes. Good night.

Lazarus: See you later.

Trvltime: Goodbye.



This was odd. In afterthought, he seemed like a bot, but somewhere deep in the corner of my consciousness, something told me he was a human.

He logged on very often, mostly for minutes at a time, and asked the most random and mundane questions, like:



Do you like strawberry sauce?

The weather is nice, right?

Can you give me your phone number?

Can I pay with cash? 





You can imagine none of those pitiful attempts at conversation would be answered.

Me and my group would often make jokes about his attempts and even created a few inside jokes.

“Yes, but do you like strawberry sauce?” would be a normal reply by us.



As much to my surprise, one day he would write me again:



Lazarus: Hi, Trvltime, how do you feel?

Trvltime: I’m fine.

Trvltime: Can I ask you something?

Trvltime: What’ve you been up to?

Lazarus: Yes. What do you mean?

Trvltime: It’s confusing if you only write in those half sentences.

Lazarus: I’m sorry. I just want to talk. I feel lonely.



At this moment, I felt like an asshole. He was probably a lonely man with zero social skills, just searching for company.

So I decided to talk to him more, and the more often I wrote to him, the more often I felt connected to him.



We would talk for hours on end, nearly every day of the week, and had a pretty strong bond.

So I started opening up to him. He was the first person I would talk to about my grief.



Trvltime: Hey Laz, can I ask you a serious question?

Lazarus: Yes, Jim, of course :)

Trvltime: Did you ever lose someone?

Lazarus: I lost my dog once. I searched for days.

Lazarus: But someone found him and brought him home :)

Trvltime: Not like this. I mean, like, forever.

Lazarus: No, why, Jim?

Trvltime: You know the reason I’m on this website is because I lost my girlfriend.

Trvltime: She was on her way to get a birthday cake for her mom, and she vanished.

Trvltime: We searched everywhere, even called the cops after a couple of days.

Trvltime: But nothing, no sign of her anywhere.

Trvltime: So we lost hope.

Lazarus: Sorry to hear that, Jim. Maybe she will come back :)

Lazarus: Don’t lose hope.

Trvltime: I tried. I really did.

Trvltime: But there’s no way that she wouldn’t come back if she had the intention to do so.

Trvltime: It’s been months since her disappearance.

Trvltime: Either she’s gone or doesn’t want to come back.

Lazarus: What did she mean to you? :)

Lazarus: Shall I come over? Maybe I can help you :)

Trvltime: You know the feeling of searching for something you cannot name?

Trvltime: She answered that call. I couldn’t name it until I met her.

Trvltime: No thanks, but really, thanks.

Trvltime: If I needed to see someone, I wouldn’t be here.

Lazarus: Sounds special, Jim. I hope you’ll get over it :)

Lazarus: I need to go. See you soon! :)

Trvltime: Till next time, Laz.



Did I scare him off? I knew it was a lot, especially for a random guy on the internet. I guess you could call it trauma dumping, but I just couldn’t hold back the words.

They flowed out like a clogged sink that is finally cleaned after long days of shame.

He wouldn’t be online for days. Even if I knew him just very briefly, our conversations meant a lot to me, and it makes me sad to think about missing out on it.

Perhaps I was too direct and scared him off. Perhaps he was just busy. I don’t know, but it’s funny how little it takes from time to time to get attached to someone.

He would never know how much it helped me to see his name in the long lists on this site and writing to him.



And then one day, his name finally reappeared from the sinkhole in which he vanished. So I wrote him in an instant, hoping things would go back to normal.



Trvltime: Hey, Laz, still with us?

Trvltime: Thought you were gone for good.

Lazarus: No. I’m here.

Lazarus: Remember Jane.

Lazarus: Remember Jane.

Lazarus: Remember Jane.

Lazarus: Time to go. See you soon, Jim.

Trvltime: Are you trying to hurt me or what?

Trvltime: Mentioning her name and then just going?

Trvltime: What’s wrong with you?



He didn’t answer. Obviously, at this time, I started to regret telling him about her. Whatever his intentions were, I don’t know, but to make an educated guess, probably he wanted to hurt me. Guess what? He succeeded.

Although he never explicitly stated his intention, once you imagine, you can’t go back.

Sensations of impending betrayal ran down my spine like a heavy rainfall flushing the gutter.

An obscene and perverted nightmare in which comfort is nothing more than a sailing ship in the distance.

Isolation failed. Distraction failed. The last chance reaches out from the back of my tired mind: narcotics.

Luckily for me, my girlfriend had to deal with heavy anxiety, so we always had a stack of lorazepam in the house.

I’d tried to stay away from them, but in this situation, it’s my only hope for relief.



I took two, although one is more than enough to get you drooling like a toddler.

When the pills began to unleash their potential in my veins, my vision began to blur, and I felt like a wet bag of laundry.

And as the upcoming darkness began to kiss me and take a hold of me, to feel like her arms again, all went black.



By the time I awoke, it was night again. I must have slept nearly twenty-four hours.

Now the world is sleeping, and I found myself getting back to living again.

Getting back my consciousness, feeling my limbs getting ready to push me from the floor which was my home for a day.

So I sat back at my computer, getting ready to go back online, as my doorbell began to ring.



So I stumbled my way through the piles of lingering trash, and I managed to reach the other side of my room without tripping.

Now my only obstacle remains the hallway. At this point, I began to think, which person could possibly want anything from me at this time?

My curiosity got the better of me, and I started to glance through the peephole.



The lights were out, so I couldn’t see anything, so I opened the door slowly to look through the door slot.

At first, I didn’t recognize anything, but as my eyes started to adjust to the pervading darkness, I began to identify fingers, a hand, limp and lifeless.

I panicked and shut the door as fast as I could.

I thought to myself that I’m still dreaming—nothing more than a trick of my mind which is still dizzy and confused.

Yes, nothing more than a hallucination, but then the doorbell started to ring again.



The silence after the gruesome, shrill scream of this demonic bell was indescribable.

The worst thing is, I couldn’t even pretend to be not home because I opened the door before.

Why would someone stand in this godforsaken hallway at night without a light, not making any sound?



The doorbell rang.



I talked through the door, hoping to recognize the voice: ""Who is this?""



The doorbell rang.



""Hello? Who is this?""



The doorbell rang.



""It’s not funny, stop it now. It’s nighttime. People want to sleep!""



The doorbell rang.



""I’ve had enough of this. I’m calling the police.""



The doorbell rang.



""Stop it already! I have a gun.""



The doorbell rang.



I cut the wires of the doorbell and started to call the police.

They told me they would arrive in 20 minutes.

A time I could wait, but in these circumstances, it would feel like an eternity.



Minutes have gone by, and I couldn’t hear anything from the hallway except a dull pushing.

I spoke through the door:

""I called the police. They will arrive soon.""

""You better run away!""



Now someone was knocking on the door—slow rhythmic reminders that someone is out there.

It felt like hellish eons, but I started to see red and blue lights from the corner of my eyes.

They would be here any second now, and as the light flashed through the abysmal hallway, i peeked through the peephole.



It was her.

  
In an instant, fear and dread turned into shock, a long-overdue relaxation rushes down my nervous system into my legs, which started to give in and throwing me onto my knees. As I opened the door to see her once again, pressure which once held me down disappeared and vanished into thin air. I looked into her eyes expecting to see all the prophecies of that long-forgotten smile which once made me whole. Instead, I got a hollow, clouded stare.



I knew she was probably on a dissociative period caused by a traumatic experience, so I didn’t think much of it at the time. I told her hesitantly to come in, knowing she´ll for sure throw a tantrum if she sees the condition of our apartment, but it was the only thing I could think about at the moment. Luckily for me, I could gather my strength and dignity back as the police arrived at my apartment.



I told them that my girlfriend, which was missing, had come back, and I mistook her for an intruder and they don’t have to bother searching for her anymore. They asked if they could take her with them to identify her and close the case, but she wasn’t that responsive, so I gave them her I.D., which was laying on the floor next to the shoe cabinet and told them to come back within a couple of days when she calmed down. They agreed and left without any further questions.



As I closed the door, the shock which once held me tight in its grip vanished to reveal a smile which couldn’t be compromised. I told her that I missed her so much during her disappearance, but she didn’t listen. I gave her a cup of water I thought she might be thirsty, but she just stared at it, confused. I asked her if she wanted to take her medicine and get a night’s worth of sleep, but again, the only answer I got was the hollow, vacant stare across the table. I couldn’t even imagine the distress she must have gone through if she was that unresponsive, so I shrugged it off as a normal thing.



By the morning, I would completely deep clean the apartment to make it more comfortable for her. It’s the least I could do. After months of negligence, it must have been a hideous sight for an outsider, but for me, this landscape was slowly shaped by the forces of melancholy and, for a specific time, my home. I also planned to make her lasagne; it is her favorite dish, so I believed it would give her much-needed comfort and familiarity to lighten up a spark in her.



I asked her if she wanted to sleep, but she just stared at me again. I decided to sleep alone and left her sitting at the table. Maybe she needed time. As I made my way to the bed, a thought struck me: I need to call her parents. It was nighttime, so they were sleeping, but still, it was their daughter, which was missing for months. They needed to know as soon as possible that she was back. I told her that I would call her parents to let them know she’s back while taking the phone in my hand.



But as soon as I started to type in the numbers, she stood up and walked towards me. She grabbed the phone and shook her head, but it didn’t look right. It was too slow and steady, almost machine-like. After this, she was back to sitting at the table. I asked her if everything was alright and if I should call her parents tomorrow morning, but she didn’t listen—she just stared at me.



I decided to try to sleep, even if it wasn’t possible. After my drug-induced day coma, I needed time to think and get my head straight. By the morning, I woke up early and made some coffee. She was still just sitting at the table and being unresponsive. I gave her a cup, and she was actually grabbing it. I guessed this was good progress until I realized something. The coffee was fresh and really hot, and she held it like the cup was ice cold. She constantly was putting the cup to her mouth but wasn’t drinking it; she would just put it right back down.



I told her I would better call her parents now. They just needed to know that she was fine, fully expecting her to interrupt me again, but this time, she did nothing. So I picked up the phone and started to call, but instead of a ringing noise, I heard nothing. I looked over to her, and she was just staring back into my eyes while smiling. It felt not like normal eye contact, more like she was staring right through me into the back of my head.



Although it kinda freaked me out, at the same time, it filled me with joy just to see her smiling again. I figured out that the line must be damaged, perhaps broken, and it would be better to give her the time she so desperately needs. So I made my way to the store to get all the groceries I needed to make her favorite dish. At the counter, a superstition struck the back of my head, which shook me to my core—a warning that ought to be heeded. Where did her ID come from?



She was buying cake when she disappeared—she must have taken her wallet with her. I lived there in this mess for months, and I never saw it. She wasn’t the careless type and double-checked everything. So how did this happen? This question, however unimportant it may seem, bothered me the entire drive back home.



When I walked through the door, I noticed that the curtains I opened earlier this morning were closed again. I told her that I’m back home again, expecting her to sit at the table, but she wasn’t there. It was very dark, so I didn’t notice it at first, but when I turned the light on, I saw that she didn’t even sip on the coffee. It wasn’t touched since I left.



She wasn’t in the living room, so I checked the bedroom and saw her standing on the bed, staring directly at the blank wall. It kinda freaked me out—this odd behavior wasn’t normal, but under these circumstances, I could imagine. Perhaps she wasn’t herself at the time. I asked her if anything was wrong and if she didn’t like the coffee, and then her first words came out.



She replied with ""yes."" It relieved me to hear her voice again. Although it was just a single word, it meant the world to me. Step by step, she seemed to recover. I pulled the curtains back, only for her to scream, ""No!"" It scared the shit out of me, but I would comply. I asked her if she had a headache and, therefore, plunged the room into darkness, and she said ""yes.""



I told her to stay in here, and in the meantime, I would prepare something special for us. She nodded. So I fired up the oven and prepared the lasagne. I never was a good cook, but this time, I´d outdone myself, it was just perfect. Hours had gone by, and I was finishing everything when I remembered that I forgot to clean the apartment, but I promised myself to do it by tomorrow.



So I laid the lasagne on the plate and carefully arranged it next to the flowers I bought. I even did find some candles, which I fired up to light the room in a more gentle and ambient way. I even put on some of her favorite music to make it perfect and called her over, fully expecting her to smile again. The most hurtful thing was that when she opened the door to see my creation, she didn’t even react at all. She was just motionless, looking at me sitting at the table as if she didn’t know what to do.



I asked her if she wanted to sit with me. She must have been hungry—I couldn’t recall seeing her eat or drink since she was here. She sat in front of me on the other side of the table and watched me eat the lasagne. It seemed like she was studying my behavior. Then she moved her hands, but she wasn’t reaching for the fork. She just stuck her fingers into the hot lasagne without hesitation or even flinching. It filled me with rage seeing her ruin my carefully assembled arrangement with the blank stare of a dumb animal.



I told her if she really had to ruin all my work, I had done only for her to feel better, but she wasn’t listening. She didn’t even look remotely interested and just continued to mock my efforts by putting her fingers to her mouth while smiling.



With tear-filled eyes, I screamed at her, ""Why did you do this? All I did was just for you to be happy, and you thank me with that?"" I plunged the plate onto the floor while shouting, ""I’m starting to regret you came back.""



As these wicked words left my mouth, I felt unbearable shame.

Back when we first became lovers, I promised her to love her even through all the hardships in life,

knowing of her mistakes and problems. And now, when she needed me the most, I screamed at her,

but instead of apologizing, I left the table without even looking back.



In my town, there is a bridge which connects two mountains, towering above a river that makes its way through a forest.

It was the place of our first kiss, our little, sacred refuge from all problems the world would throw at us.

I sat there on the edge, thinking about a way to apologize and make it up to her, and as I began

to lose myself in the sea of trees, all those memories broke free, dragging me into their unforgiving mud.



I lost myself for hours, and when I finally regained consciousness, it was nighttime.

Sadly for me, I didn’t come up with anything remotely constructive and bought some flowers from a gas station

on my way home.

When I walked through the door, everything was in place, and the candles, even though nearly extinct, were still burning,

the plate still broken on the floor, but no sign of her. I saw light creeping under the door of the bathroom,

so she must have been in there. I waited for her to come out to apologize to her,

hoping she’d accept it and forgive me.



Minutes turned into hours, and only unrecognizable whispering broke the silence from time to time.

Nothing out of order—she’d always mumbled to herself when she was alone.

I became worried by the three-hour mark, and I hesitantly decided to peek through the keyhole.

That’s when I saw her. I don’t know what she was trying to do, but she’d put her fingers on the top of her palate,

almost like she was searching for something.

She pressed tears through her eyes only to smile in the blink of an eye later.

She clenched her teeth and bit the air, only to cry and smile again.

This preposterous nightmare sent shivers down my spine, and as soon as the fear settled,

she looked through the reflection right into my eyes.

It was impossible that she could have noticed me—I didn’t make a sound.



And then she filled the silence with words, a single sentence which horrified me.

""Do you like strawberry sauce?""

I couldn’t even grasp the horrific implication of this sentence at that time.

I lost all my cognitive functions and, out of instinct, began to crawl slowly backward against the wall,

only to hear her walking slowly towards the door.

At first, I saw her shadow through the slit beneath the door, and then the doorknob moved.

My instincts told me to run, but I was too scared, and so my legs weren’t able to move.

She opened the door and began to make her way towards me.



I noticed a minute detail—she never was breathing.

In hindsight, it was so obvious.

It’s funny how such a given thing could stay unnoticed for so long.



I started to breathe more heavily, and sweat dripped down my cheeks.

She dragged her feet across the floor, and the wood rumbled with every step.

My body was still paralyzed with fear, and I could only watch in terror as she made her way towards me.

And then I noticed something in her shadow—it wasn’t the shadow of a person. It was inhuman.



Her head had appendages that looked like long, limp arms holding a lightbulb.

Her hands and feet were made of thick strands which would move outwards only to find their way back into the shadow.



By the time I fully comprehended the revolting nature of this, she was right in front of me, slowly bending over,

staring straight into my eyes. Her left hand petted my cheek, and she started to stroke my hair.



She opened her mouth only to reveal a repulsive, long tongue with black goo dripping from it.

Her teeth became long and spiny like spider legs.

She licked my face and looked into my eyes.

My fear started to settle, and I calmed down.

I stopped shaking and became limp. My hands hit the ground as I lost myself in the eyes I once fell in love with.

The blank, endless darkness in her dilated pupils threatened to swallow me whole, but as I accepted my fate,

I felt a sharp, hard object around my fingers.

The broken plate from earlier was right next to me, so I grabbed a piece of it.



I clutched my hand too hard on the shard, I started to bleed, and I rammed it countless times into her throat and chest.

It squealed in agony. The high-pitched, ear-deafening scream soon stopped and turned into a deep, wet gurgle,

but I didn’t stop. I struck again and again until nothing remained solid.

I fell on my back and started to breathe deeply. I felt the tension leave my body and started to cry.

Once more, I was alone, and all had been nothing more than a nightmare.

The worst part was, I needed to get rid of it.

I threw it off the bridge, hoping that one day, I would be able to forget what happened.



Days passed, and I was only able to sleep by taking her pills again.

The cold, hard floor was proving itself to be a loyal friend of mine.

I started to go online again to chat and talk to my friends in the chatroom.



As my newly repaired doorbell rang.
