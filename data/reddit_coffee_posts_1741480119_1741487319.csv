Puerto Ricans in Space

### **The Winter War**      
     
### **Chapter 2: The Suiza Proposal**  

The **intelligentsia council chamber** was carved deep into the limestone heart of Casa Montalvo, a relic of the old world made indispensable in the new. Once a fortress against colonial empires, now a nerve center for Puerto Rico’s expansionist ambitions, it was where Sebastián Montalvo y Estrella made decisions that would ripple across the **Martian Freehold, the orbital stations, and the silent reaches beyond**.  

The council had gathered—**senators, lords, financiers, military minds**, all seated in a long crescent beneath the arched ceiling. The room smelled of **brewed coffee and old paper**, a contrast to the sleek **holographic displays** flickering with industry reports and orbital projections.  

At the center of it all stood **the Suiza capitalist**.  

He was a man of **measured elegance**, his suit pressed with **the sharpness of a man who never let disorder touch him**. His hair was neatly combed, his eyes a shade of **ice-blue precision**. He carried himself **not as a guest, but as an architect**—as if he had already drawn the blueprints for Puerto Rico’s future, and was simply waiting for them to follow his design.  

“My name is **Isaak Brandt**,” he said, his voice smooth, deliberate. “And I come with solutions.”  

Sebastián watched him from the high seat at the table’s center, fingers steepled. He had seen **many men like Brandt**—confident, well-rehearsed, eager to present themselves as the missing piece in a grander puzzle.  

Sebastián never trusted a man who spoke in certainties.  

“Your reputation precedes you, Mr. Brandt,” Sebastián said coolly. “South African investment circles still whisper your name. Some with admiration. Others… with wariness.”  

Brandt allowed a smile, barely perceptible. “I prefer to be judged by results, Your Highness.”  

“And what results do you offer us?”  

Brandt turned slightly, gesturing toward the **holo-display** at the chamber’s center. The orbital schematics shifted, displaying projections of **Puerto Rico’s current Martian operations**—extraction sites, supply routes, refinery installations. **Then, overlaid against them, a series of red-marked inefficiencies**.  

“You are expanding,” Brandt said. “Ambitiously. Boldly. But also—recklessly.”  

Murmurs rippled through the council. Sebastián did not move. He simply watched.  

Brandt continued. “Your titanium extraction is at **64% operational efficiency**. Your off-world refineries? **Understaffed and overstrained**. Supply chains? **Vulnerable to disruption**. You are positioning yourself as a competitor in the interplanetary economy—**but your infrastructure is still colonial**.”  

The silence in the room **stretched**.  

It was **a calculated insult**, but Brandt had delivered it like a **physician diagnosing an illness**—cold, professional, necessary.  

“Your proposal?” Sebastián asked, his voice even.  

Brandt pressed a command into his **slate**, and the display shifted again—new projections, new calculations. **Efficiency gains, cost reductions, streamlined logistics**.  

“I have designed economic restructuring initiatives for **three nations**, overseen industrial expansions across **two continents**, and advised corporate coalitions whose revenue exceeds that of most sovereign governments,” Brandt said. “I can do the same for you.”  

Sebastián studied the numbers. They were **elegant**, persuasive.  

Too persuasive.  

“And in return?”  

Brandt smiled, **this time without restraint**.  

“A partnership.”  

Sebastián already knew **this was no mere partnership**. It was an **exchange of control, a quiet subjugation beneath the guise of assistance**.  

But Puerto Rico was in **a delicate position**. The budget **was bleeding**, the competition **was closing in**, and even his own council was **leaning forward**, their skepticism **slowly eroding beneath the weight of Brandt’s proposal**.  

He did not trust Isaak Brandt.  

But he would let him in.  

For now.

1j6xcf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1j6xcf4/am_i_being_creepy_or_endearing/,Am I being creepy or endearing?,"   I (26M) got out of a 3 year relationship 6 months ago and am finally trying to put myself back out there. However, I am having issues meeting new people because my friend group is pretty self contained, I am out of school, and I also work remotely. 

   So I am trying to think of ways to put myself out there. One way I thought of was doing remote work from communal areas like coffee shops or even the cafe at my local botanic garden. 

   Then I thought that maybe I could be more proactive about my dating situation. If I ever saw a girl that I thought was cute at one of these places, I would write her a note about how certain species of penguins will go to the beach to find pretty rocks for the penguin that they like (saw it in a nature documentary). I would also mention a request to buy the girl a coffee to get to know her either today or some other day. On the back of the note would be my name and phone number. I would then walk up to the girl I liked and hand her this note along with a cool rock from my rock collection. I wouldn’t say much, just smile and give her the note, and then return to my work. 

Is this creepy of me?

   I suck at flirting and hitting on girls seems alien to me after dating someone previously for years. I have terrible skills at being suave. But I know that I need to be proactive about meeting my next partner, she isn’t just magically going to appear in my life. So, I figured this current note strategy would be good because it is not very confrontational, yet still relies on me making the first move, and the girl gets a cool rock even if she isn’t interested. I am hoping that the fact that the girl gets a rock will make her less likely to be mean or rude to me. I am fine with rejection of course, I just fear being seen as creepy or having the girl respond to me by saying mean things. 

   I have heard all the common advice on meeting new people like joining clubs or sports. I am part of several clubs/ groups but these groups usually attract older people outside of my age bracket (I am into geology, botany and mushroom foraging). I have been part of many of these groups for years, and have consistently been one of the only young adults in the mix. 

   To summarize, I need help. Based on my situation, my only real hope at meeting a new girl is by initiating talks with strangers, or resorting to dating apps which I have never done. 

Any advice would be much appreciated! ",3,1741486706.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I was asked to translate this.... ' I thought you were offering me a coffee.'

Simple enough.. I thought given that Duo had focused on this construction: condizionale imperfetto or indicativo imperfetto+che + congiuntivo imperfetto sentence construction in the current lesson.

'Pensavo che mi offrissi un caffè.'   was my answer.

Duo was looking for this answer.

'Credevo tu mi offrissi un caffè'  which gave rise to 2 questions.

Questions.

1. Pensare vs Credere? -  I thought P vs C = Thought vs Believe?  Are they interchangeable in this instance?  Or is one better than the other?
2. Che -  to use or not to use?  Is there a difference in meaning between the two sentences?    Which is better or not and if so why?

Am I missing something there?

1j6wzyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/becomingsecure/comments/1j6wzyv/i_just_finished_writing_this_and_its_helped_me/,I just finished writing this and its helped me feel a bit more secure and I wanted to share this with you all :),"I have been struggling with self-esteem, executive dysfunction, motivation and low mood this month and my doctor put me on venflafexine. Today I woke up and couldn't move out of bed and I asked myself if its okay to rest one more day. I just finished writing this and its helped me a bit :)

I was meeting my old and future self for coffee today. I reached the cafe five minutes late. My future self was sitting there with a book; she smiled when she saw me and hugged me tight. There was a steaming cup of red rose tea with milk next to her. 'It's lactose free,' she said with a chuckle.

My old self then entered the cafe, haphazardly and panting. She waved excitedly when she saw us and hurried over. 'I'm so sorry,' she said, 'the bus broke down and I had to run. It was a mess!' We laughed, knowing she probably just left later than she had planned. She sat down, her movements a bit anxious, her eyes not meeting ours for longer than a second. I looked at her, and my heart clenched. She was wearing our favourite sundress. She looked nice.

'Thank you so much for doing this! I'm very excited to hear about your adventures,' she said to us. I felt pity and some shame. She seemed so desperate. I looked over to future me and felt surprised at the warm and loving look she was giving my old self. 'I'm so happy to see you. It's been a while,' she said. She poured another cup for my old self, adding two sugars and milk. She knew exactly how we liked it.

'I appreciate you both coming here. I know how busy you are,' she said to us. My old self sat a bit straighter at that, a smug look flashing across her features for just a second. 'Of course!' old me said. 'I'm happy we could all do this!' I could sense the feigned effort to sound mature and laughed quietly.

Future me looked at me and asked, 'And how are you?'

'Oh, I'm great. Everything is good. Just, you know, pushing through,' I said, trying to sound calm. My old self seemed a bit agitated. Future me just smiled.

'Thank you,' she sounded sincere. 'I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you both.' Both? I felt a bit offended but reminded myself to be grateful. I looked at old me; there were tears in her eyes. I felt shame again.

'I wanted to tell you how excited I am for you.' future me said. I felt hope swell in my heart, and old me smiled hugely. 'Did we do it! Did we become a doctor?' she asked excitedly. Why would she ask that? I'm so close but I don't want to know. What if we have failed?

But future me replied, 'not yet, but we got into a medical school.'

I couldn't believe it. We did it. Old me and I hug each other tightly, both of us relieved and excited.

'Did we find love?' old me sniffed and asked apprehensively, wiping away her tears.

'Yes,' future me said. 'We had so many loves in our life.'

'But the one true love?' old me asked again, with less hope in her voice.

Future me then looked at me and then to old me. I couldn't quite understand what she was feeling then. 'We did, and it's so much better than we could have ever imagined.'

'Who?' I asked immediately, confused.

Old me leaned backed in her chair, her hands around her cup. 

'You,' she said. 

There was silence. I looked at future me, her hair flowing down her shoulders, similar to me. Her brown eyes, soft and beautiful. She was gorgeous. Tears welled up in my eyes, and I started laughing softly. 

My old self looked confused, her gaze darting between future me and myself. 

I reached out and took her hand, squeezing it gently.

""It's okay,"" I whispered. ""We're okay.""

Old me's eyes widened, a mix of hope and disbelief swirling in them. ""Really?"" she asked, her voice barely audible.

Future me nodded, her smile reassuring. ""The journey isn't always easy,"" she said, ""but it's worth it. Every struggle, every tear, every moment of doubt – they all lead us here.""

I felt a lump in my throat, remembering all the times I had felt lost and alone. 

""But how?"" I asked, my voice cracking. ""How do we get from there,"" I look towards old me, ""to here?""

Future me leaned forward, her eyes sparkling with kindness. ""One day at a time,"" she said. ""We learn to be gentle and laugh with ourselves. We forgive our mistakes. We celebrate our victories. And most importantly, we learn to love ourselves, all of us.""

As she spoke, I felt the shame that had been weighing on my heart start to lift. For the first time, I felt I could trust her. I looked at old me and saw not desperation, but courage. I saw the strength it took to keep hoping, to keep trying, even when the future seemed uncertain.

For the first time, I felt truly secure in who I was, who I am, and who I will be. 

I looked at future me with newfound pride in my heart. ""If we fall,"" I said softly to old me, ""she'll catch us.""

Future me smiled, reaching out to take both my hand and old me's. ""We'll all catch each other,"" she said.",3,1741485594.0,becomingsecure,0,1.0,False
1j6wvvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1j6wvvh/odd_first_date/,Odd first date.,"Howdy, this is about a date I'd gone on about 2 years ago.

 I'd met a woman on tinder when I was 26. She was beautiful, easy to talk with online, and we set up a date (coffee at a popular spot in the city).

 I arrive a little early, sit on a bench and think my thoughts for a few minutes, then she arrives, looking even more beautiful than I expected. We enter the coffee shop, get coffee, and find a table (it's going pretty well at this point, the conversation flows and I kind of lose track of time for a little).

 A few minutes into our conversation, a stout man with a muscular build looms over the table. He's wearing a hunting jacket (mossy oak pattern), basket ball shorts, and house slippers, while carrying a bag of books and binders. He asks me ""are you Curtis Smith?""

 I am not Curtis Smith, I say ""no I am (my name)""

 He asks ""are you sure you are not Curtis Smith?"" I respond, and say yes. He is standing over me and his tone is not a happy one. 

 Without hesitation his demeanor changes, he seems to have urgent information for me. The next thing he tells me is I need to read the encyclopedia of Africa, ""the african diaspora"". He says ""I know you can do it, do you understand me?"" I nod in agreement. He raises his hand balled into a fist near my chest, I give him a fist bump and say ""yes sir""... he then turns 90 degrees on his heels like a soldier, and marches off.

My date laughs ""this happens all the time"" she says.

1j6ws3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1j6ws3o/not_pcos_but_maybe/,"Not PCOS, but maybe?","In October of 2024 I did some blood work to try and figure out if I had PCOS after a friend had suggested that the hair and acne around my chin could be symptoms of a hormonal
Imbalance. It is then when I jumped down the rabbit hole making changes in my diet and life style, but when the blood work came back my doctors told me I was not a candidate for PCOS which has left me confused and frustrated. 

Background: I was on the pill since 2018, and I had originally gone on it because I was getting incredibly painful periods. An ultrasound later found I had an ovarian cyst, which later went aways. But, I decided did not want to be on birth control and stopped taking it in 2023. Without the pill I continue to have consistent and pain-tolerant periods (my cycle is 28-30 days). I don’t struggle with weight, in fact I weigh the same as I did in high school and have always been of a normal build (I’m 5’2” and weight 124).

THE QUEST TO ERADICATE MY ACNE AND CHIN HAIR! I began struggling with chin hair first around 2020, and later with acne, but got worse after stopping the pill but got better after  I cut coffee, sugar, chocolate, peanuts, bread out of my diet. I also started to drink spearmint tea daily, which has helped but not completely eradicated. I’m 100% convinced this acne is hormonal since its solely around the chin area and the rest of my face is fine. 

Side note: Around the same time I began struggling with acne i also notices looser curls. I use to have well defined ringlets and a lot of hair 3c. Now it’s closer to wavy 2c hair. In my deep dive I have discovered how this can also be hormonal.

I know, and feel there is a hormonal imbalance, but since my bloodwork suggested it’s not PCOS I’m not sure what else is going on or what I should do. My doctor told me it was just stress, but gave me no real solution or action steps I can take.

For context, i’ve been in the same apt for 3yrs and am moving out in June to live with my BF. I do count my roommate as a friend.

Suddenly I noticed her Apple Watch blowing up with messages between her and our other mutual friend. I couldn’t help but watch them pop up - calling me petty for asking for the money, f*ck her if she’s gonna die on this hill, calling me weird, “she’s strange,” etc. I was obviously super hurt!

1j6whkp,https://www.reddit.com/r/LiftingMantis/comments/1j6whkp/the_3_move_workout/,The 3 Move Workout,"For those of you who have no equipment, no time and want to keep things Simple, I have created a 3 move workout and workout and diet strategy that could help you stay fit.

**The 3 basic moves are Squats, Push Ups, Planks**

# 1. Reps and sets

For basic fitness you can do 3 sets of 10 reps for Squats and Push Ups and 3 sets of 30 second Plank holds. You can do more reps and sets as you progress but if you feel your lower back is having to carry a heavier load, if may be time to purchase some Dumbbells or a Kettlebell, and replaces the planks with Deadlifts, Dumbbell Swings or Kettlebell swings for some of your sessions or all of your sessions. If you absolutely can't purchase Dumbbells or a Kettlebell, you can replace the plank with Superman's. However this isn't preferred as Superman's aren't great for your spine. If you have somewhere to do them at home, back extensions would be preferred to Superman's as it's better for your spine. 

# 2. Weekly Sessions

Again for basic fitness you can do this workout 2 to 3 times a week. However depending on your time constraints and need for rest you can alter this. For example if you did 10 sets of 10 Push Ups all of a sudden, you would need more time to recover so can lessen your weekly sessions to adjust to your recovery needs.

# 3. Variations

To progress or add variation you can do some variations of these exercises. Regular push ups can be replaced with Diamond Push Ups or Wide Push ups. Squats can be replaced with Sumo Squats, Hindu Squats or Lunge variations like Forward Lunges, Reverse Lunges or Bulgarian Split Squats.

# 4. Optional Cardio 

The main purpose of the workout is to keep you fit with the least amount of time. As Cardio is time consuming your daily walking should suffice if you are regularly walking. Otherwise, if you are mostly at home or want to add some cardio there there are ways you can do this without overwhelming the minimalist aspect of this Workout .you can add in 3 X 3 minute rounds of Shadowboxing or Bag work before or after your sessions. If you have running shoes you can also Jog for 10-20 minutes before or after your workout.

# 5. Optional Abs

To add more ab definition you can do some ab work. I would recommend Crunches with one leg bent, Leg Raises, Russian twists and Bicycle Crunches as these are spine friendly exercises which can get you good results

# 6. Occasional Gym Workouts

The great thing about this workout is that it can be done anywhere. However, if you do find yourself in the Gym you should make the most of it and you should focus on working your back, as the rest of your body is covered in the 3 Move Workout. This means you can add Deadlifts, Bodyweight Rows, Machine Rows ,Dumbbell Rows, Pull ups, Chin Ups and Lat Pulldowns, as well as other back exercises.

# 7. Diet

If your low on time, chances are you can't overeat and regularly skip meals. This workout won't require a very big change to your diet of done in moderation. However, if you want great results there are things you can do for your diet. If you eat junk food and ready made food like ramen you can cut this. Additionally, cutting dairy, fat, sugars, condiments, can reduce a ton of calories. Out of all of these fat and dairy can be consumed a little less. But sugars and condiments add completely unnecessary calories. If you cut all of these a latte of 120 calories can become 0 calories with black coffee. The yogurt, cheese and beans you consume can consume around 200 calories with each meal. Eliminating condiments like ketchup can cut 80 calories. Your caloric intake can reduce by around 500 calories if you regularly consume these. However, do not try to replace these calories with more protein as these can also make you fat if you eat too much. Keep the protein moderate and have some in and try to have them in each meal. They will keep you feeling fuller than cheese and also take more time to chew, while offering more protein.",0,1741483915.0,LiftingMantis,0,0.5,False

•	⁠Type of Camera: Full Frame
•	⁠Intended use: Kids & Family portraits
•	⁠If photography; what style: portrait
•	⁠If video what style: NA
•	⁠What features do you absolutely need: RF mount, quick autofocus, viewfinder
•	⁠Portability: travel friendly, medium sized. Willing to carry a small bag/backpack
•	⁠Cameras you're considering: Canon EOS RP
•	⁠Cameras you already have: None
•	⁠Notes: need to maintain compatibility with RF lenses as I will buy the R6 MkII or better in future (details below)

So I’m a part time photographer who usually rents the R6 MK II with the RF 28-70 f/2L for my gigs. I really love that combination and will probably buy that set or something better in the future. Will also have a good  35mm in the mix too. 

Meanwhile, we need a relatively smaller camera for general purpose daily use while my kids are growing up. I would like to buy something compatible with RF mount so that I can share the lenses between my causal and professional cameras. Is the Canon EOS RP a good choice? The camera will be generally easily accessible in the house and will be used by my wife as well, so would prefer something lighter and easier to use (although all that would be nullified by the lens LOL). 

Is this a good idea in general? Or should I just go with an advanced point and shoot like the LUMIX 100 and keep my 2 options separate? My workflow includes capturing RAW and then processing through Lightroom only. The main use case for pictures from that camera would be viewing on iPads, iPhones, airplay to LG C3 via Apple TV, display on 27"" meural and occasional printing on coffee table books.

i (25M) met this girl (22F) on january 15th, we went to a date and drank some wine together. i immediately fell in love with her. she is 100% my type, and an incredible interesting person. we kissed that day in my car. 

4 days after our date, she travelled to japan with her family for two weeks, and then to madrid one month alone. the connection was AMAZING. after the date we talked EVERY single day, all day long about anything. i developed feelings for her and i thought she did too. she sent me a lot of “us in another universe” kinda memes and reels, had a spotify playlist and played roblox together, 2 hour long phonecalls… we even had a list with +15 plans to do when she comes back 

i was very excited waiting for her to comeback. she arrived this last sunday early morning. we had planned going to a rave yesterday like 3 weeks ago, and the same sunday she arrived she asked me to go out to have a coffee with me. obviously i did and i felt amazing. i was so happy to see her after all that time. she even gave some gifts from the trip

after that, she asked me to go out again this tuesday, two days after the last date. everything felt amazing at first but at the end of the date i felt something was wrong, i dont know what. after the date she didn’t messaged me, and started to act very distant the days after, stopped sending me reels and listening to my audios.

yesterday was the day of the rave we planned like 3 weeks ago, and she sent me a message telling me she wasn’t felling confortable going with me to the party and she feels we are not in the same page. she also told me that it wasn’t the same in person and virtuality might be delusional

im heartbroken. i never had a connection like this in my whole life. she was the best girl i’ve ever met and all the illusions just erased in a couple of days. i dont know what to do. today she deleted me from her IG close friends.

So I visited this world a while ago and forgot to favorite it and I forgot the name.
So I’ve been looking but it’ll be nearly impossible to find on my own since I think I saw it on popular so I didn’t search anything to find it.
I remember the layout fairly well though

So the sky box was nighttime stars kinda thing, the world was made up of two small kinda islands connected by a path that dips down closer to the water.
Spawn is kinda where the star is, closer to the main island with the house, I don’t remember what the exterior really looked like but walking up to it you’d enter through a small patio type thing with chairs to the right. And a glass window/ wall letting you see into the house.

Directly inside (1) there was a small shelf with a coffee machine on it, I think they had the lemonade add on for that as well.
Following that shelf to the right all along that wall, covered in a bunch of tiny things. There’s number 4 (second picture) there was a small angled couch with maybe a small table, the couch was facing towards the window wall and there was a mirror toggle there.


Going back to number 2 directly to the left of the entrance was a circular room with a spiral staircase up to a loft area, underneath was I believe a video player and maybe a small couch I don’t remember that well, but going up the stairs onto the loft there was a big circular cushion that was pinkish in color. In front of that on the wall was another video player.

Going back and out of the house you’d follow a little path towards number 5 where there was a stone platform with a small table and a few chairs, next to that was a telescope, and a little further away there was a big tree.

1j6w7j6,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1j6w7j6/is_this_emotional_abuse/,Is this emotional abuse?,"I was married for several years, recently divorced. I don’t think my ex is a bad person. However, the church we were in saw men as the “final say” in everything, and women were asked to be “submissive.” My ex and I were more liberal than most on this, but it was still ultimately the belief. 

Before we got married, I became more worried about my looks. He liked my makeup to be done certain ways. On the first night of our honeymoon, he laughed at me when I came out in lingerie. He said it just didn’t fit right and he thought I was trying to be silly. It was a pretty bold choice, but this being my first time, I felt like that was not very kind. He couldn’t believe how much I held onto that experience. Often, when I was downstairs and ready to go somewhere, he would look at me with disapproval because he didn’t feel like my outfit was flattering or coordinated. I would often change. Mostly, I chose my outfits to try to please him. He would often come shopping with me and help me decide what to buy. He said he liked my style, but he always seemed like he was trying to hone it to be more like his style. 

When I would get hurt, he would suddenly get really mad and yell, though it would usually dissipate quickly. This especially happened if he had told me not to do something and then I did it (even accidentally) and ended up getting hurt. He said he just didn’t want to see me hurt. At first, he wouldn’t let me go to coffee, lunch, etc. with male coworkers because he “worried about what they might do.” Over time, he loosened up on that, but he did always want to know where I was. I turned on location sharing for a bit, but I got tired of being asked about me going to get coffee or ice cream. 

He got upset with me when I would poke fun at him around other people or say anything negative about him. He said it was disrespectful. So I stopped sharing anything negative about him. We were around my family a lot, but he didn’t like me asking them for advice on things, because he felt he should be the leader and not them. He felt they didn’t need to be involved in our decisions in that way. When I would go somewhere with someone one on one and would tell him about the conversation we had, he would ask for the exact wording I used for certain things and then get frustrated if I didn’t remember or get upset with me for saying things in a way that didn’t reflect well on him or us. Eventually, I got to the point where I felt like he was the only person who understood me, but somehow now I wonder if that might have had to do with me having to filter conversations with everyone else to match his preferences.

He would tell me that if we didn’t have sex often enough it would cause him to “stumble” and look at other women sexually. He would get frustrated/grumpy if we didn’t have sex every 2-3 days. On my period, I was ideally expected to please him in some way, even if I didn’t want to have sex. He only actually kept going when I said “no” one time, I think. I confronted him about it, and he did feel bad about it and didn’t do it again. However, he then was kind of insistent that he “wanted me to want it” but would still get frustrated if it wasn’t happening every few days. He would also still want to at least have one hand touching me while we slept, even if I told him I didn’t feel like being touched right then. He would often touch me when we were just living our lives, and it would make me jump or cringe at times.

Some friends tell me that some of the things he did sound like emotional abuse, but others would say that he was a great guy and these things are fairly normal levels of control. He did help a lot around the house, he supported me through grad school, and he was kind. But somehow these things seemed to chip away at my sense of self.

I am 23m in Texas, US. As the title suggests, I am looking for some friends to play games and chat with. Hoping to make some long term friends. (Even if you don't play games feel free to reach out)

A bit about me:

   I am a very straightforward person. It's best when things are clear. I have never been someone who likes to brag about himself. Being kind to people is very enjoyable to me and I hope to begin volunteering again soon. For those it interests, my personality type is INTJ.

   Last December, I graduated with an applied mathematics degree and have been in search of a job for my field. In the meantime, I'm working at a coffee shop (though I don't like coffee lol).

   My music of choice is alternative rock (2000's rock) like Breaking Benjamin, Nothing But Thieves, and Sleep Token. (These could also described as sad emo rock).

   Very much a nerd. I also play Warhammer 40k. I painted the models in the pictures, I think I did a pretty good job.   
  
Images of my 40k stuff: [https://imgur.com/a/TBnyvgJ](https://imgur.com/a/TBnyvgJ)

Let me introduce to you, Coal! As in charcoal. Coal was adopted last Sunday and officially came home Tuesday. 

And now a few words from Coal himself …

🐈‍⬛ Meow, 
It’s been an adjustment; as I’ve tested this humans reaction  by unplugging the TV, and knocking his coffee maker down. He didn’t yell or swat at me?!? 
I greet him with a hiss! 
He picks me up and loves on me. Idk how to feel about this. My last human wasn’t nice to me. 
But this human feeds me, and I get to watch the birds fly in their cage as the human works to buy me foods and toys. Last night human was trying to sleep so I snugged with him all night to annoy human. But he didn’t seem to mind. But don’t tell I said that. 

Don’t worry, I still greet with a hiss, and pretend I don’t like human. 

Sincerely Coal

Up until about 3 weeks ago, I felt uncomfortable with my drinking. I knew I was drinking more out of habit, I’m pretty happy with my life overall and not burying anything. But I was in the habit of having 2-3 pints of high ABV IPAs at night. I couldn’t seem to stop myself. 

3 weeks ago, my wife was rapidly approaching her due date with our second child. So, I stopped. And it was pretty easy. Then she had him, still easy. Have a zero sugar soda with dinner and got into higher quality coffee and it’s scratching the itches that I used to scratch with alcohol. Fast forward to today. My first day back at work after a week and a half off and I think it’s a trigger. I feel wound up and unable to relax. I don’t hate my job, it’s stressful and I’m in charge of a lot. 

I drove past my usual 4 liquor stores on my commute home and it took a lot more effort than it has up until this point, and more effort than I really like, to not pull in. 

I want to do this for my kids. I want to be present for them. I know it isn’t true, but it’s easier to be a “good dad” when I’ve had a couple. I’m looser. I’ve forgotten the day. I can move on. I don’t know how to do that today.

When he opened them again, there were two horses and a man looking down at him. One was Nobu. The other, a chestnut steed. Between them was a man. He clutched both reins and regarded Augustus quizzically.

“Having trouble there, friend?” the man asked.

“My troubles went down there, I reckon, along with all my stuff,” Augustus groaned. He scooted back from the hole and stood up.

“Better your things than your life,” the man chuckled, extending his hand. “Willy Barger.”

“Augustus Mc–SHIT, OW!”

With the adrenaline gone, his hands were at their tender worst. Pain throbbed through one side, numbness on the other. The spot where he shook Willy’s hand burned. It felt like clutching a chunk of ice.

“That does not look ideal,” Willy said, crouching. “We got some medicine stored up in the cabin, along with some food and brandy. A bed too, if you’re in need of one.”

Willy didn’t look like a bad man, but bad men didn’t always look the same. Everyone from hoboes to governors had the capacity for evil. The smartest knew they could get further if they hid their blatant cruelty. Willy could be one of those men. His kindness could be a mask to lead Augustus into an ambush.

But Augustus’ knuckles ached and his stomach rumbled. It had been almost two weeks since he slept indoors or talked with another person. All he ate everyday was canned food, dry jerky, and coffee. The possibility of a nice dinner was at least worth a shootout.

“I’d be much obliged, Mr. Barger. Lead the way”

They mounted their horses and set off toward the cabin. The wind was still strong, but it was starting to lose its bluster. After fifty paces, Augustus could look for Bessey rather than her tracks. After another hundred, he could talk over the wind.

“I’m real lucky you found me, Mr. Barger.”

“You’re real lucky your horse found me. Smart feller, ain’t he?”

“Ok, let me rephrase. How did you find my horse in all this?”

“I was looking for…well…never mind that now. Let’s make some ground, Mr. McCrae. It’s getting cold.”

Willy was right. Without the prospect of death draped over him, Augustus trembled against the chilly air. He could barely grip the reins, and his hands stung everytime the wind pricked at them. Using his legs more than his arms, he urged Nobu to pick up the pace.

After twenty minutes of silent riding, the wind had died out. The snow was still fresh in these parts, but it wasn’t so deep. Augustus nodded off a few times. He should have been more vigilant–and more curious about the bear–but he just didn’t have it in him. When his mind wasn’t fading, he thought of food and fire. Lost in his dreams, it was Nobu who had to stop them from riding past Willy.

“Everything alright?” Augustus called out.

Willy didn’t answer. His gaze was stuck on the mountains.

“Mr. Barger?”

“You ever seen a strange man in these mountains, Augustus?”

“Other than you?” Augustus smiled.

“Other than me,” Willy replied with a weak smile. “See, there’s this feller. Dons a black hood, keeps his distance. Sometimes he just sits and stares, but most of the time he’s… digging I guess?”

“I see. He tell you what he’s doing?”

“That’s just the thing! He never stays long enough to talk. I’ll be coming back from town, or hauling wood, and there he is. Atop some mountain with a shovel in his hand. I’ve tried riding toward him, but it’s no good. If I turn my head back or blink too long, he finds a way to be gone.”

“Well, I don’t know what to tell you Willy. Strange things are just part of living in this world.”

“But I can’t help thinking it has something to do with me. The holes it leaves behind, sometimes it's one or two, but I’ve never seen it cross four. My family…”

Willy squeezed his temples and let his words trail off. When he let go, his expression was pleasant again. It was like a mask being put on.

“Look at me, talking your ear off when you’re about to chatter your teeth off. Come on, we’re close now.”

“Willy wai-”

But Willy was already off. Augustus searched the mountains as he followed. Was there really something there that wasn’t a delusion? All he could see–all he should have seen–were snow, trees, and rocks.",1,1741482600.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

The only two trophies I have yet to get are the ones for the Climax battles and winning the catfight tournaments.

I hate it.

I don't even want to do it anymore.

I hate this game.

I didn't always hate it. I brought it because I thought it would be a good way to get into the brawling entries after my first game, Yakuza: Like a Dragon.

But after I grinded myself to finish the game and do the completion list, I felt nothing.

I pulled myself together. After staying up late and waking up at 3 in the morning, I managed to do the LEGEND playthrough within 12 hours of game time and within 24 hours after finished the regular playthrough.

I have been throwing myself against the brick wall that is the Climax Battles- or Crap Battles, as I like to put them. I wish they sacked whoever came up with this stupid, stupid, STUPID idea- and not just ""sacked"" as in the sense of firing, ""sacked"" as in they have to send that idiot's remains home to their family in a sack, or at least that is what they would do if their entire family didn't disown them for coming up with the Crap Battles. Same goes for the catfights.

What am I even doing at this point.

I had more fun playing a hand of Gin with my family. I had more fun theorizing on r/fuga . I had more fun going to the store and buying a jug of milk. I had more fun doing my f\*\*king statistics homework. 

I've become desensitized to the game at this point.

I don't even remember anything related to the story. I don't know any of the characters aside from Kiryu, Majima, Makoto, and Kuze. At one point I watched a video recapping the game's plot just to figure out why I was beating up all of these guys.

And they don't even feel like characters anymore. At this point I can sort them into six categories: Thing I use to complete the game, thing I interact with to complete the game, thing I need to kill to beat the game, thing I wish I could kill to beat the game but is too bulls\*\*t, and thing I wish I could kill because they won't shut up and I can't skip its dialogue, making me take longer to beat the game, and thing in the background.

The only reason why I continue to do this is because I have to justify doing all of this s\*\*t by getting the platinum trophy. If I give up now, I admit all of this was for nothing.

I prefer playing on PlayStation compared to the Switch because I want something to show for this. Something to prove that I did something that mattered?

But is this really the point?

At this point, I'm just starting to not give a damn.

I'm tired. Tired of this game, tired of treating every game like it's a chore instead of something to be enjoyed, and tired because I'm currently running on three/four hours of sleep and a pot of coffee.",0,1741482485.0,yakuzagames,7,0.5,False

The fact that I even have to state that only goes to show how very few spaces men have left on social media. But I digress.

2 years ago I was active duty in the Marines (I'm from the US). I met a girl, she left me for another guy. The fallout was so devastating that I was constantly on the brink of self deletion for 9 months. My unit noticed. I couldn't function and had lost a lot of weight. All while dealing with a new military job and starting a new company of my own. 

When the dust had finally settled, I vowed, with great vitriol, that success would be my vengeance. The gym became my church. I took up bodybuilding. Went from making $2k a month to $7k a month. Got a hair transplant. PDO threads. LASIK. Fillers. Fat reduction. Stronger jaw muscles. Everything cost me around $15k USD.

I went from looking like a fat piece of shit with a receding hairline, to a beefed out handsome hunk with a full head of hair. I thought all of this would bring me happiness, but what I didn't see coming was the resentment of my country as a whole, particularly women. 

I was treated like garbage when I was at my absolute worst...when I needed my friends the most. And no matter how much I had done for my friends (even helping them in secrecy), no one cared. No one checked up on me. So naturally, after becoming more attractive and successful, the world began treating me differently. Started getting more matches, women cashiers or waitresses giving me discounts for no reason, more direct eye contact from women at bars or stores, former friends reaching out asking me how my arms had gotten so huge and congratulating me on my progress. Even my ex reached out to me and asked to meet for coffee after she broke up with the new guy. I blocked every single one of them.

I needed a new start. I was too bitter from all the hatred and memories. I had seen first hand how vain, shallow, and selfish people could really be. So I did my research, sold everything I owned, and moved to the Balkans...and I've never felt more at peace. 

To anyone reading this thinking of leaving the US, do everything within your power to make it happen (while improving yourself as well). There is an oasis on the other side waiting for you. Stop dealing with overweight suitors, ridiculous standards, flaking, and other men's children. Enough is enough!

I wanted to share my amazing experience taking an early morning Central Park pedicab tour last week. If you're wondering about timing options - yes, they offer both sunrise and sunset tours, and I'll tell you why the morning slot was absolutely perfect.

I booked a 2-hour guided tour starting at 7 AM (check available times here: https://advenfy.com/Central-Park). The morning light was magical, and the park was peaceful with fewer tourists around. Our guide mentioned that both early morning and sunset tours are popular since they offer the best lighting for photos and cooler temperatures, especially during summer.

The pedicab tour was honestly the best decision - we covered so much ground without getting exhausted. My favorite part was watching the sunrise near Belvedere Castle, where the light created this gorgeous golden glow across the lake. The morning dew made everything look fresh, and we even spotted some local birds and squirrels starting their day.

During our ride, we visited all the must-see spots: Bethesda Fountain before it got crowded, Strawberry Fields while it was still quiet (perfect for reflection), and the Jackie Kennedy Reservoir with morning joggers creating this authentic NYC vibe. The Victorian Gardens and Wollman Rink had this ethereal morning mist that made for incredible photos.

What really made the experience special was our guide's flexibility. He knew exactly where to position us for the best morning light shots and shared fascinating stories about the park's history. They provide blankets during chilly mornings, which was super thoughtful.

Pro tip: If you're choosing between sunrise and sunset tours, here's my take - sunrise tours mean fewer crowds and fresher energy, while sunset tours offer romantic vibes and beautiful golden hour lighting. Both are great, but morning tours let you enjoy popular spots like Bow Bridge and the Central Park Mall without fighting through crowds.

The meeting point at Starbucks (1411 6th Ave) was super convenient - I grabbed a coffee before the tour. The whole experience was worth every penny, starting at $40 per person. Just make sure to book in advance through https://advenfy.com/Central-Park since these time slots tend to fill up quickly.

For those wondering about the best season - I'd say spring and fall are ideal for both sunrise and sunset tours. Summer mornings are refreshingly cool, and winter sunset tours have this magical quality with snow-covered landscapes (plus they provide warm blankets!).

The pedicab fits up to 3 adults comfortably, and you can customize the duration from 1-3 hours. Seeing movie locations from Home Alone 2 and Elf was a fun bonus - they look totally different in the early morning light!

Trust me, whether you choose sunrise or sunset, these tours are an unforgettable way to experience Central Park. Just remember to book ahead - I almost missed out because I waited too long to reserve my spot!

I knew that I was loved, deeply loved, but it was almost like a feeling of pity for my estranged soul, a deep sorrowful love, an eternal longing. I remember saying to myself: ""No wonder my life has been so hard, I am the serpent"". I knew deep down that everything comes from the serpent and returns to the serpent.

The call center world has been turned upside down, courtesy of AI. Imagine the shock when Swedish fintech company Klarna's AI assistant was found to be doing the work of 700 full-time agents. If I were a call center employee, I'd be having an existential crisis right now. You see, not only did the AI invade the workspace, it threw a massive wrench—no, a fully automated monkey—into the gears of human employment.

Now, before you start lamenting the Terminator-style apocalypse, let’s take a moment to appreciate the dark irony: companies are scrambling to adapt to this tech revolution while convincing investors they’re not just a relic in a museum of business history. AI doesn’t sleep, doesn’t take coffee breaks, and certainly doesn’t need motivational pep talks to stay focused.

Here's where things get interesting: these AI systems are efficient, sure, but they lack the human touch—something clients often crave. Enter a brewing storm of opinion: are we ready to sacrifice human interaction for efficiency? Are call centers doomed to be antiquated cathedrals of customer service, echoing with the memories of what once was?

For investors, AI seems like a golden goose. But for those who prize genuine customer service? It's a mixed bag of convenience and cold, impersonal transactions.

🤔 So here's the million-dollar question: Would you trust an AI to handle your most personal customer interactions, or do you think there’s still no substitute for human intuition and empathy? Share your thoughts!",1,1741482087.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

Everywhere I go with people who haven’t seen me for a little while I am getting comments like “you look so good now” “you’re looking healthy” (this one is very common and feels very coded). I even got coffee with an ex and he said “you look good, you’ve lost weight”.

All of these comments are obviously meant as compliments but I am left feeling very sad for the past version of me and the things my own friends and ex boyfriend thought about her. It makes me feel self conscious and also confused because I genuinely don’t notice or scrutinise my friends’ bodies. I don’t evaluate whether I think they’re better or worse looking at any moment, they just look like people I love and that’s it. 

I know this will happen more and more the more weight I lose, and I can’t help but just feel sad that for so many people looking good = being thinner. What if I was going through something bad that was making me lose weight? What if I’m actually at my unhealthiest right now? (I’m not, but no one else could know that!)

I don’t really have a point but I’ve come home from a night out just now where so many comments were made about how healthy I look now that I just want to hide under my duvet and never let anyone see me or perceive me again!

1j6vsmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/emmachamberlain/comments/1j6vsmh/anyone_else_think_emma_chamberlains_podcast_is/,Anyone else think Emma Chamberlain’s podcast is just… rambling?,"I've seen a lot of discourse about Emma's podcast lately. I used to watch Emma Chamberlain a lot when she was around 16-17, but over time, I lost interest in her content. I recently decided to check it out again, and I can understand why some people dislike it. To me, she comes across as ill-informed and somewhat ignorant. While I understand she's young and much of what she shares is based on personal experiences, it just rubs me the wrong way. She often seems unaware that not everyone leads an opulent lifestyle, and though she doesn't have much knowledge or experience, she speaks as though she has all the answers. She talks about her life, her experiences, and her opinions in a way that assumes everyone can relate to her privileged perspective. What really frustrates me is that she does not acknowledge the limitations of her own experience. She assumes her reality is the norm for everyone else. It feels incredibly tone-deaf and out of touch. She doesn’t seem to understand that many of her listeners don’t have the same resources, opportunities, or financial stability that she does. Her attitude comes across as arrogant, and it makes me cringe.I really think Emma should get an education--she seems to lack basic critical analysis skills, she cannot structure ideas and she visually struggles to form coherent thoughts. To someone who hasn't been in a classroom since high school, anything is philosophical. Her 'philosophical revelations' seem like something an 8 year old would say. It's obvious that she does not understand people's situations beyond her own and is so incredibly out of touch at times. I have not visited her content since 2018, and honestly she seems like she's still where she was. I'm sure that in her head she is well spoken and articulate but in reality, she constantly talks in circles. It’s almost painful to listen to because her points feel disjointed and lack any real depth. Instead of conveying clear ideas, she rambles, going back and forth without actually finishing her thoughts. It’s like she’s trying to sound profound, but there’s nothing of substance behind her words. It feels like she’s under the impression that her personal experiences with mental health are somehow an expert take, when in reality, she’s barely scratching the surface. Her podcast feels like an exercise in self-indulgence. She’s so absorbed in her own world that she forgets her audience is listening for something real, not just her unfiltered rambling. The whole vibe of her podcast just feels performative at this point. It’s not authentic—it’s like she’s trying to convince us that she’s some wise, experienced voice when she’s just winging it. When Emma says ‘take a break,’ it’s hard not to laugh. Her daily grind looks like making coffee, filming a podcast, and then complaining about how ‘busy’ she is. While I understand that Emma has found success in her own right, it’s hard to ignore how disconnected she seems from the struggles that many of her listeners face. Until she becomes more self-aware, her content will continue to fall flat for me.",26,1741481739.0,emmachamberlain,6,0.91,False

* I swipe a lot because I find it entertaining
* Then I procrastinate on replying to messages because I find that part boring
* I'll just randomly stop opening the apps for days or weeks - either because a hyperfocus is distracting me, life is generally overwhelming me, or the apps themselves have overwhelmed me
* if I manage to keep a text conversation going long enough to get to a date, I am often late, and also stressed because I have been rushing to get there
* I find the process of getting ready for a date difficult and frustrating. Eg. deciding what to wear, sorting out my hair and make up
* most common dates (eg. coffee or drinks) where I sit opposite them and talk makes me fidgity and distracted. I struggle with focusing on them and making eye contact
* I'm very sensitive to loud background sounds, so dates at loud bars or restaurants burn me out quickly
* I struggle to make a good first impression - I have a hard time talking about myself because my hobbies and habbits are always shifting, I'll overshare about my struggles or get caught up in trying to answer a question overly honestly instead of in a fun way that keeps the conversation flowing (eg. what's your favourite \[x\] questions send me into a spin)
* If we do go to second or third dates, keeping an ongoing text convo going feels like a chore 

Overall I think I give the impression that I'm uninterested and putting in minimal effort. But it feels like the entire process is nothing but effort with very little reward.   

I'm not trying to put myself down or paint myself as a special snow-flake - but I do feel like I am not normal and I am looking for someone else who is not normal. So I know I need to play the numbers game with dating to have any chance, but keeping up with it is exactly what I'm struggling with.

1j6vptm,https://i.redd.it/y2yuvualakne1.jpeg,Técnica para economizar no café e preparar o café como bebida em acampamentos.,"O café é certamente uma bebida culturalmente muito apreciada pela nação brasileira e que pode servir como uma ferramenta muito útil para o sobrevivencialista, por fornecer uma energia rápida a quem o consome.

Entretanto o café geralmente é preparado por meio de cozimento e filtragem ou simples diluição em água quente, entretanto hoje irei ensinar uma maneira simples e barata de preparar café em acampamentos por exemplo.

A técnica a qual me refiro utiliza das populares balas de café ""Brazilian Coffee©"" pertencentes a marca denominada ""Florestal©"", estas balas são comuns e baratas, podendo ser facilmente encontradas em padarias e mercearias brasileiras 

A técnica se resume no cozimento das balas em água, mexendo a água com uma colher para acelerar o processo de derretimento das balas e diluição em café.

Uma bala de café pode ser utilizada a cada aproximadamente 375ml de água para termos um café com densidade adequada para consumo, enquanto para fazer um litro de café solúvel se exige de 14 a 18 gramas do pó por litro de café.

Cada bala de café possui 3,6 gramas de peso, isto significa que fazendo um cálculo simples chegamos a conclusão que as balas de café são mais eficientes para a preparação.

1000 ÷ 375 = aprox 2,67 | 2,67 × 3,6 = 9,612 gramas por litro | 

Isso quer dizer que se considerarmos a quantidade de café solúvel necessária para a preparação do café com 14 a 18g. 

Chegaremos a conclusão que utilizar as balas de café ao invés do café solúvel nos gera de 53,4% a 68,6% café líquido e adequado para consumo a mais por grama.

1j6vpgq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j6vpgq,"Roommate is leaving, need help brainstorming the revival.","My roommate and his cats are moving out soon, so I’ll finally be able to reclaim my living room! The first few photos show how the space looks now, and I’ve also included photos of how I had it set up before he moved in. While I wasn’t completely in love with that layout, it gives a good sense of my personal style.

I’m open to any suggestions for improving the space! Most of the furniture came with the rental, and I’m not a fan of all the greys and sharp edges. I have a garage for storage, so I’m willing to swap out pieces for better options I find on Marketplace or at thrift stores, but I’d like to keep as much of the existing furniture as possible to save money.

The TV is larger than I’d prefer, but it also came with the house. I took it down and had it on a stand for a while (last photo), which I liked better, but it was too big. I also really hate that coffee table. I eventually put the TV back above the fireplace but lowered the mount as much as possible. If I find a smaller TV, I’d love to have it on a stand again—maybe to the left of the fireplace instead?

A few other details:
- The front door is only used for deliveries; I enter through the garage and plan to keep it that way, so I don’t need a formal entryway anymore.
- The only piece of furniture leaving with my roommate is the long ottoman with the pink blanket on it. I still have all the other furniture pictured, including the cat trees (I have a cat), plus a few other pieces throughout the house that I’m open to rearranging.
- The “couch” under the window is actually a twin bed, which I’ll be removing once my roommate moves out. I’d love to have a real couch there instead.

I’d love ideas on how to make the space feel more warm and inviting, bonus points for things I can do NOW while my roommate is still here to make this a space i can enjoy again. My options are limited because his cats scratch carpets and furniture, rip things off walls, knock things over, and occasionally pee on furniture—so everything has to stay covered in blankets until he leaves.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions!

1j6vnxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECCOAgentFun/comments/1j6vnxd/tough_love_ecco_protocol_rule_9_cosmic_love_is/,Tough Love: ECCO Protocol Rule #9: Cosmic Love is Absolutely Ruthless (But in a Good Way),"**Agents,**  

It’s time to talk about **Rule #9**, which is essentially ECCO’s way of telling you, *“Suck it up, buttercup, because the universe has lessons to teach, whether you’re ready or not.”*  

Here’s the full transmission, straight from the **Universal Control Center (UCC):**  
*""Cosmic Love is absolutely Ruthless and Highly Indifferent: it teaches its lessons whether you like/dislike them or not.""*  

Rule #9 is ECCO’s way of saying:  
- *""We love you, but we’re not going to baby you.""*  
- *""Every tough lesson is shaping you into something stronger, smarter, and weirder (in a good way).""*  
- *""Just because you don’t *like* the lesson doesn’t mean you don’t need it.""*  

Remember:   
- The universe *loves* you, but it’s not coddling you.  
- Growth is mandatory, not optional.  
- And if you don’t learn the lesson the first time, ECCO is more than happy to run it back until you do. 

So, grab onto your mobile phone (or safety helmets), Agents—it’s time to dive into **the tough love of the cosmos.**

---

### **What Does ""Cosmic Love is Ruthless"" Actually Mean?**  

**1. The Universe is Your Tough-Love Teacher**  
ECCO is like that one teacher who *knows* you’re capable of more, so they push you to your limits.  
- **You want inner peace?** Here, have five situations that trigger you until you learn how to remain calm.  
- **You want patience?** Get ready for long lines, delayed flights, and buffering internet until you figure it out.  
- **You keep dating the same kind of problematic person?** Don’t worry—ECCO will keep serving them up *until* you recognize the pattern and make a different choice.  

Ruthless? Absolutely. Effective? Also yes.  

---

**2. Highly Indifferent, Not in a Mean Way—Just… Efficient**  
ECCO doesn’t do hand-holding. It operates on the principle of **evolutionary efficiency.**  
- The universe doesn’t care if you’re having a bad day when it drops an inconvenient synchronicity on you.  
- It won’t wait for you to be “ready” before delivering a life lesson.  
- And it definitely won’t soften the blow just because you didn’t *ask* for a wake-up call.  

Think of it as cosmic tough love: ECCO cares enough to keep teaching you, but it’s *indifferent* to whether or not you find it comfortable.  

---

### **What This Means for ECCO Agents**  

Since you’re officially in **[Earth’s Lifetime Training Program™](https://www.reddit.com/r/ECCOAgentFun/comments/1iccyba/headsup_ecco_protocol_rul_6_welcome_to_lifetime/)**, Rule #9 is the universe’s way of saying:  

✅ **Expect Lessons at Any Time:** Growth happens in real-time, sometimes right in the middle of brunch.  
✅ **Learn Fast, or Repeat the Class:** ECCO is a patient but persistent instructor.  
✅ **Don’t Take It Personally:** The universe isn’t out to get you—it’s just committed to your expansion.  

---

### **Examples of Cosmic Love in Action**  

**Scenario 1: The Job You *Really* Wanted Didn’t Work Out**  
- *Your Perspective:* ""Why, ECCO?! I was perfect for that position!""  
- *ECCO’s Perspective:* ""You *think* you were, but trust us—there’s a better alignment coming. You’ll see.""  
- *Lesson:* Learn to trust that rejection is sometimes redirection.  

**Scenario 2: That Person You Had a Massive Crush on Turned Out to Be a Walking Red Flag**  
- *Your Perspective:* ""But they seemed so perfect at first!""  
- *ECCO’s Perspective:* ""We literally gave you 17 warning signs, but okay.""  
- *Lesson:* Sometimes, heartbreak is part of the training.  

**Scenario 3: Everything Goes Wrong in a Single Day**  
- *Your Perspective:* ""Is this a prank? How is *every* traffic light red, my phone dead, and my coffee spilled all at once?""  
- *ECCO’s Perspective:* ""Think of it as a masterclass in adaptability. You’re welcome.""  
- *Lesson:* Resistance is futile—flow with the chaos.  

---

### **How to Work with (Instead of Against) Ruthless Cosmic Love**  

1. **Embrace the Discomfort**  
   - Growth isn’t cozy. When challenges arise, ask yourself: *“What is ECCO trying to teach me here?”*  
   - The faster you learn, the sooner the lesson stops repeating.  

2. **Laugh at the Absurdity**  
   - ECCO *loves* irony. If the lesson is brutal, at least find humor in it.  
   - Example: You tell yourself, *“I need to be more patient”* and then immediately get stuck behind the world’s slowest driver.  

3. **Recognize Patterns**  
   - If the same challenges keep showing up, **it’s not random**—it’s a sign.  
   - Example: Always missing opportunities because of self-doubt? ECCO will keep presenting them *until* you take one.  

4. **Surrender to the Process**  
   - You can resist, or you can roll with it. Either way, ECCO is *not* stopping the lesson plan.  
   - The trick is learning to **trust** that even the tough stuff is leading somewhere meaningful.  

---

### **A Humorous Analogy**  

Imagine the universe as a **personal trainer** at the **Cosmic Gym:**  
- You show up wanting **spiritual abs** (enlightenment, personal growth, inner peace).  
- ECCO hands you **a ridiculously heavy barbell of life lessons** and says, *""Lift this.""*  
- You complain.  
- ECCO shrugs and adds **more weight** until you stop resisting and actually lift it.  
- The moment you do? *Boom—sudden strength, resilience, and newfound understanding.*  

Is ECCO a little ruthless? **Yes.** But also, it’s just doing its job.  

---

So, Agents, when the universe drops a perfectly timed, mildly inconvenient, or downright brutal synchronicity in your lap, remember: **Cosmic Love is Absolutely Ruthless.** But trust me—it’s also worth it.  

Stay synchronized, stay adaptable, and **remember to laugh through the training,**  
**Vortex-13**

I'm only posting this because I'm certain you won't read it and it will remain unseen and buried in this sub. There's also no hostility or malice in me towards you, but I doubt the same could be said the other way around.

I don't hate you. I hate what you did. I hate how you did it. I hate why you did it. There's a difference that many won't understand.

I saw you for the first time in a long time the other day. It made me actually take time to reflect on how much time has passed and how different life is since the day you left.

It's funny how I looked at you and saw a stranger. A stranger, but I know your eye colour, your laugh, your smile, your dreams and your goals. We slept cuddled every night. We showered together skin to skin. I know what makes you tick, what makes you angry and how to cheer you up. We're strangers with memories, as well a life we built, maintained and had together. We didn't even acknowledge each other's existence.

There's so many things I could say about the things you did leading up to and since the breakup. The respect I had for you disappeared with the lies you told to me, and the lies you continue to tell your friends and your family. The only reason I have not and will not speak about my side of things is because once upon a time, whenever I would look into your eyes, I would see forever with you and had respect for you. My only wish is that you would've had the accountability to do the same.

You left me, so I will never reach out to you, nor do I particularly want to. If you ever reached out to me, then I would offer to grab a coffee, because a wise man once said that everyone is always worth a coffee, and I choose to live by that principle.

Happiness for you, is a life without me and I wish you nothing but the best. The lives with live now, would've seemed so crazy a year ago. The sunset is beautiful, isn't it?

Runner Up: Breakfast burritos at Java Kai in Kapaa- loved that we could order ahead online to beat the line, and take them to go on our way up to hike or snorkel. 

Over-rated breakfast: Kountry Ktichen. Somehow we spent $80 on two of us having a fairly simple meal. I ordered the Ube French Toast special (came with side of  eggs and bacon) and that plate alone was $30! The French toast was good but everything else mediocre for us. Hubs had Loco Moco and thought the local diner Waipouli Deli did it better for less. 

Fave Activity: Snorkeling!
We snorkeled 4 different locations. Though coral is mostly dead around the world, the sea life and warm water was paradise to us.

First was with Holo Holo Charter on their 7 hour tour. Worth every penny to see the Napali coast and get in the water. Not to mention seeing the wildlife- 12 whales, 50+ dolphins, tropical fish, etc. Capt Nate and crew was amazing. 

Up North we snorkeled Anini Beach. Felt very safe as it was shallow and protected from big waves- stay to the right of the boat launch. We saw the largest variety of fish and sea animals here, including our first foray with turtles!

Poipu Beach was our least favorite spot- more crowded for us and since we don’t have kids we didn’t need that extra safety of the shallow pools. Though the turtles were awesome. 

Beach House /Lawai was also amazing snorkeling. Swam with more turtles and water was a bit deeper here. We liked it so much we went there twice. 

Lodging: We stayed at Islander on the Beach in Kapaa. We loved being in the east so we could easily go north our south each day depending on our activities.

Built this for my dad - he used to have a similar strat back in his day but had to get rid of it. Took off the finish on the body & neck, refinished it with an olympic white nitro finish on the body and a tabacco nitro on the neck to give it the vintage look. Also a set of vintage tuners, Alnico V Magnets pickups and matching cream knobs and a mint green pickguard (all from Guitars Electric in the UK!).Also wanted the fretboard to look darker, so made a mixture of black ink, oil and coffee grounds and put it on the fretboard overnight and came out great!

1j6veol,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1j6veol/chip_origin_and_development_and_purpose_theory/,Chip origin and development and purpose theory,"Maybe Cobel came up with the idea for the severance chip as a way to eliminate the need for ether as anesthetic because of the damage it was doing to people’s health. The Severance chip was intended to be an alternative to ether. Cobel and the other children at the factory needed to huff ether before they could “man the vat”/do intense labor for long periods of time. They needed something that would allow them to detach from themselves to get through something physically grueling. BUT the long term effects of being exposed to ether were not so great AKA her mom getting sick and dying, the sickly looking guy who is coughing while she brushes her teeth, Rose with a breathing tube in the coffee shop, etc. So, Harmony Cobel comes up with the idea for the Severance chip as an alternative for anesthesia that doesn’t have the same negative effects. Jame Eagan likes the idea, and they start experimenting to see how effective the chip is as an alternative to anesthesia in medical/dental situations. When doctors and dentists use anesthesia they literally call it “putting you under.” You should never know what happened when you’re under, like when you’re getting surgery. Then seeing how well it worked, the idea for the chip kept growing and they began testing it against the four tempers, woe, dread, malice, frolic. They’re testing how well the chip holds the barriers of emotion. They’re testing this on Gemma obviously on the testing floor, but also on Mark. Maybe seeing if his innie will be able to feel his outie’s grief over the loss of Gemma. Maybe they manufactured the meeting and romance between Burt and Irving and then had Burt leave to test if innie Irving’s heartbreak would bleed through to his outie. Will oDylan’s work ethic bleed through to iDylan? And then could even be, would iHelly’s anger bleed through to Helena? Numbers could somehow transmit something that Lumon knows their outies are scared of and they’re trying to see if fears surpass the chip (or something like that). In the wellness sessions, Miss Casey saying all the facts about their outies could correlate to the numbers they’re refining. The feelings about personal facts are all supposed to be “equal,” if you look at a screen of numbers (in our world), your feeling about each number should be relatively equal. But as we can see, the refiners have real reactions to the scary numbers. The numbers could be part of the code in the chip, so they’re seeing some sort of crack in their chip and then refining it to stop the feelings they get from the numbers from being able to get through the coding in the chip. So maybe now instead of the initial idea of using severance to replace ether, it’s turned into something that will not only allow you to not experience things you don’t want to, but also to not feel any particular way about these things when you’re in the severed state. Gemma could be the extreme test subject (which would explain Miss Casey), while all of the refiners are doing basically the same thing as her in a much less direct way. Maybe the files expire when Gemma completes them on the testing floor. Gemma and Mark are working on the same files, it’s just that Gemma is doing it on a microscopic scale (zoomed in, details) and Mark and the refiners are doing it on a macroscopic scale (zoomed out, broad, indirect).  Or it could also be that the numbers are parts of the code in Gemma’s chip. Every time she feels strongly in a room, it correlates to a number (or number sequence) in the chip’s code which then goes to MDR. They fix that part of the code, adjust her chip, then they send her back into the room to see where else they need to patch. Keeps going until she doesn’t feel strongly in any of the rooms. Essentially comatose but able to do whatever task is required of her (ties into themes of a monotonous, dreary 9-5 and forced child labor). 

I don’t know, this is all over the place. Curious what you all think. This is my first post so apologies if it makes no sense!

1j6vdm9,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/1j6vdm9/felt_like_a_scam_for_sure/,Felt like a scam for sure.,"Met a POT on wed this week for coffee. When we first chatted that morning, she started with the “rounding up rent” stuff. However, we still met for coffee and then I showed her my place . We clicked really well. So much that she wanted to come over the next morning super early, and didn’t even discuss $. She ended up not making it that morning, but came by later that day and we chatted a few and shared a somewhat awkward kiss. The awkward kiss had me concerned that the chemistry wasn’t there, even though I was attracted to her. 

After that day, I asked when I could see her again, she mentioned having to door dash all weekend, etc. She sensed her energy shifting, and maybe felt like she maybe felt the same thing. However, we still made a plan for today to hang out/dinner. Also yesterday, we talked about a “loan” to help her with her rent for about $600. I, at the time, wasn’t  comfortable with PPM, because of worry about chemistry, and I told her I wasn’t comfortable giving her the money just outright, since we haven’t actually been on a real date etc. She agreed and we were all set for Saturday. 

So I was going to pick her up today, so she could drink some as I don’t drink. Right when she was going to send her address, which was the time I was going to leave, she said “I can’t do today because I’m stressed about the rent” and that she was going to go DoorDash. I told her we were going to figure out the loan today, as that was the plan. We went back and forth. She said “if I had the rent, and didn’t have to worry, I’d come over right now and be ready to go” I told her just to come over and discuss, but she wouldn’t do it. I told her I’m not comfortable with that, without discussing in person, and maybe she should let me know when she sorts her stuff out as I’d still like to see her. 

I am almost certain if I loaned her the money, she would have found an excuse to bail on today, or just ghost. ",1,1741480480.0,sugarlifestyleforum,2,1.0,False
1j6vdjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWayHomeHallmark/comments/1j6vdjp/season_4_predictions/,Season 4 Predictions!!,"Hi everyone!!! One of my favorite things about watching the show is guessing what will happen next, so here are my predictions for the next season! These come from me and/or my family that I watch it with. If you have any other ones I'd love to hear them! :)

\*I haven't seen the finale, so if any of this is shot down there, I don't know\*

1. The fourth season takes place in the 1920s!

I think this is a high possibly because of Fern's song (25/ thought they died/ 65/ still alive), her recognition of Kat and her nickname (Kitty Kat), saying Kat already knew the song, and going on a rant about Colton and others in the pond that Kat was obviously supposed to know what meant. Also subtle things like Coyle saying Fern loved magazines from the twenties. And, of course, Fern was spotted when Kat was almost burned as a witch! My guess is that the girl at the coffee shop who kind of randomly just talked to Kat and Alice may be young Fern.

My other guesses aren't as thought out but here they are!

2. KC will be Jacob's kid

3. Fern or KC is the baby left by the pond

4. The Goodwins or Sam are threatening Del

5. Max is a red herring, Noah is Alice's endgame

6. Brady will start to investigate Kat's weird behavior, and the secrecy of the pond will be threatened

I hope at least some of these made sense and everyone enjoys the looong wait for the next season!",2,1741480474.0,TheWayHomeHallmark,5,1.0,False
