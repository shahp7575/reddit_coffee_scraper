	‚Ä¢	He‚Äôs thrown coffee on me in the past. He‚Äôs broken my phone, damaged my TV, and thrown things when angry. But the one time I accidentally hurt his finger when closing a door during a tense moment, he called me violent and held it over my head for weeks.
	‚Ä¢	We used to split rent and bills. After a fight and his car getting vandalized (by someone totally unrelated to me), he said he couldn‚Äôt afford to contribute. He moved out saying it was ‚Äúto work on our relationship,‚Äù but now only sends me a couple hundred here and there while I cover $1,600+ alone ‚Äî something we never agreed on.
	‚Ä¢	He constantly talks over me. If I express emotions, he tells me I‚Äôm dramatic or ‚Äúcrazy.‚Äù If I ask him to listen, he either mocks me or shuts down entirely. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs no safe space to be honest or vulnerable.

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just emotionally worn down or if this is actually abuse. I feel confused, alone, and like I‚Äôve lost my voice.

1ktchvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1ktchvf/how_do_i_manage_a_team_that_includes_former/,How do I manage a team that includes former friends?,"Hi all, I‚Äôm a manager at a coffee shop, and I‚Äôm struggling with how to stay professional when several members of my team used to be close friends but are now actively excluding me and creating a lot of tension at work.

Here‚Äôs some background:
C, is my assistant manager. We were extremely close‚Äîso much so that we ended up living together for a while. Along the way, we also grew close to another teammate, A. Unfortunately, C started becoming jealous of A and me spending time together, and began talking behind my back at work. This was overheard by other staff members, and her behavior eventually escalated into her ignoring me both at work and at home. We had moments where things improved, but it got emotionally draining and messy enough that I had to move out for the sake of my mental health.

C also has a pattern of gossiping and putting others down, which seems to be influencing the energy of the team. Our other assistant manager, S, has now become extremely close to C and often joins her in whispering and side conversations on the floor. During a recent shift, I walked into the back to grab a pastry and they both immediately went quiet and pretended they were just grabbing supplies. They‚Äôve been making social plans together at work and whispering about it within earshot, which makes it feel like they‚Äôre trying to turn the team against me.

One of the other employees, E, is my ex-boyfriend‚Äôs sister. We were friendly, but due to her getting close with C, A and S she has been playing telephone with me about anything work related. Particularly shift coverage or when she closes and I open , I hear things she should be telling me from others. I recently had to have a direct conversation with her about improving communication at work. Since then, she‚Äôs been getting shifts covered and has been distant

I‚Äôve worked really hard to create a safe, inclusive, and positive environment for our staff, and it‚Äôs heartbreaking to feel like I‚Äôm being excluded from the very culture I helped build. I want to keep things professional and not take everything personally, but I also want to make sure that this workplace remains not just a good environment for others‚Äîbut one that I can feel safe and supported in too. The tension is constant and exhausting. I don‚Äôt want to escalate anything unnecessarily, but I also don‚Äôt want to just tolerate the disrespect.

Has anyone navigated this kind of situation‚Äîwhere coworkers-turned-friends flip and then quietly undermine you?
How do you reestablish professional boundaries and authority when your team isn‚Äôt meeting you halfway?
how do you rebuild team trust and authority when personal relationships go sour?
How do you reestablish leadership when the dynamic is emotionally charged but still very under-the-surface?

1ktcht8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ktcht8/how_to_flirt/,How to flirt,"I met a beautiful woman at a professional networking event recently who works in information technology. We spoke for half an hour and I offered to teach her to use Python to automate routine things at her job, it seems that she's interested and we will end up meeting at a coffee shop for like 90 minutes, I will help her set it up and walk her through some basic tasks. I don't think I've really sent any signals of interest so far.

I don't know her personality because we only spoke a half hour, so maybe this is premature. But assuming we get a good vibe going between us and feel comfortable, how do I express interest?

I saw some comments that are like, ""smile and joke around"" and this seems easy and obvious, good advice.

I've seen some comments here that say ""tease her gently and be slightly mean"" and this isn't natural/authentic for me because I'm not really like that. I understand that dynamic, I get that it works for some people but I'm not going to do that, it's not natural to me to be deliberately a little obnoxious, pesky or mean. I've made some cracks before at a friend's expense and I usually feel pretty guilty afterward.

I asked a friend and she said, give her a good lesson, be kind and supportive and help her figure things out, and read her signals carefully to see if she is expressing interest, and then ask her out directly if there are good signals. This is very natural for me and is probably what I'll do, but if anyone wants to refine that advice I will be interested.",1,1747980787.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been having these weird sharp pains in what I think is my gallbladder. It‚Äôs usually when I eat anything with latex in it, so naturally I started to just avoid those foods. But lately it‚Äôs been getting worse. Even if I don‚Äôt eat those foods. Lately I‚Äôve been throwing up after most meals. I‚Äôve been getting hot flashes, so exhausted, my muscles are locking up, and last night i got an insanely sharp pain in my upper right abdomen and I threw up so much blood my bathroom looked like the shinning. I went to the ER and was puking the whole time which was still just mostly blood and bile. Most of the blood was normal red but some was coffee ground like. And it wasn‚Äôt like a little puke it was full blown projectile vomiting. They had me puke in a tub so they could monitor how much blood was in it. They kept me overnight to make sure I didn‚Äôt go into shock and released me after a few hours of stopping puking. 
The doctors say it‚Äôs just stress and a lack of electrolytes. But I honestly don‚Äôt think so. I pushed and pushed with them to do more test but they were all so cranky. 

I‚Äôve seen gastrointestinal doctors, my primary, and a gyno.

When I found out he was a few years younger than me, I swore him off as I assumed all 21 year old men were immature and not what I was looking for (previous dating experience coming into play here). I think he had a crush on me as well.

We still get along well as friends. But what bothers me is our company hired a barista coffee cart for an event we hosted. Our mechanic was in that day, though I didn‚Äôt see much of him. The dude at the coffee cart was very handsome so I thought I‚Äôd ask him out.

I told my coworker this, and she brought me right up to the barista and said ‚Äò[name], now what did you want to ask this lovely gentleman? I‚Äôve already asked if he‚Äôs single for you‚Äô. I stuttered my desire for his instagram and left it at that.

However, the mechanic WAS WAITING FOR HIS COFFEE AND HEARD THE WHOLE THING. I felt terrible. I actually pulled him aside the next day and apologised for the awkwardness. He was chill and just said ‚ÄòI thought it was random‚Äô. At the time, I wasn‚Äôt properly interested in our mechanic because of the age difference, so I was apologising more for the awkwardness than the asking out.

The date with barista man didn‚Äôt even happen because we were of different religious affiliations. Since then, I have got to know our mechanic more, and he seems to have a really good head on his shoulders. I REALLY like him. I want to ask him out.

I guess my question is, should I even bother because I asked someone else out in front of his face?

I guess dating circumstances aren‚Äôt perfect, but goddamn.

tl;dr Should I ask out my crush, even though I asked out someone else in front of him? This was before I realised I was very interested in him.",0,1747980490.0,relationships,0,0.5,False

I have a unique living situation, I (23f) Live with my Boyfriend, Dad, Sister and my sisters boyfriend. We all decided to move to another state together and split rent on a small place for cheaper living. My dad works out of town so he's usually home about two days every two months. His schedule is a month on and a month off. Most of his free time is spent travelling with his girlfriend. I don't have anything against his girlfriend, she seems very nice and he seems happy with her which is all that matters. They've been together for about two years. I don't know her well at all, we've probably spoken twice briefly before this, she's pretty quiet and shy but seemed okay. Anyways on his way back from one of their trips my dad lets me know that they will both be coming back to our house. I told him it wasn't a problem at all, he was set to go back to work two days after that. The house was pretty crowded but I figured two days of having an extra person in the house wouldn't be too bad. Now another thing to know is that I suffer from mild OCD. It might sound silly to other people but I have two mugs that are the only mugs I will drink out of. If one is dirty then I use the other, if both are dirty (which is rare) I will wash both before considering using another one. Everyone I live with accepts that and doesn't have a problem with it, half of the cups and mugs we have are ones that I brought anyways so there's never a shortage. Before my dad brought his girlfriend I reminded him to just let her know about the mug thing (we're all coffee drinkers and constantly have mugs of coffee) and he agreed and said it won't be a problem. Well when the day came for him to go back to work I asked where his girlfriend was going as he was leaving for a month and he said that she was staying with us. I was definitely taken aback because he didn't even ask any of us if that was okay. Even if he did ask I would have been skeptical because none of us knew her well and it's awkward to be staying in a pretty small space with someone you don't know. He said he figured it was fine because he lived with mine and my sisters boyfriend so he had the right for his girlfriend to stay with us. I told him that I understand where he's coming from but it's the fact that he didn't even bother to give anyone a heads up and I pointed out that he didn't actually have to live with our boyfriends because he was never home and even so we've both been with them for 5+ years and he knew them really well, MUCH more than we know her. He basically said that there's nothing we can do and left for work. Both my sister and I and our boyfriends have been feeling super uncomfortable in our house, just trying to keep to ourselves. I've tried talking to my dad's girlfriend a couple of times in passing but she's really doesn't seem like she's interested in talking to me or my sister. It's definitely been weird but we've been managing the best we can. About a week ago I noticed one of my mugs was missing. I asked my sister and her boyfriend if they had seen it but they both said they hadn't so it was obvious who took it. I decided to try and relax and allow her to use the mug because it really isn't a big deal if she used it one time. But then the next day it was still gone and not in the kitchen. I still decided that there's no reason to be upset over a mug and continued to let it slide. Two more days went by and it was still missing. I know normal people would be simply asking her about it but she pretty much locked herself in my dads room and barely came out and I really hate confrontation so I didn't want to knock on the door just for a mug. Another two days went by and my sister told me that she saw her come out of the room with the mug, wash it in the sink and then bring it back to her room immediately. I was really annoyed at this point because there are plenty of other mugs for her to use and she was fully aware that I didn't like other people using mine. Finally I saw the mug on the counter and it was covered with dried food. I was disgusted and decided to let it soak with soap and water for about 20 minutes. When I came back to give it a better clean, the mug was gone again. I really don't know what to do a part of me feels like she's doing this on purpose. My boyfriend keeps telling me to move on and let her use it because I have another mug and it's a stupid thing to get this upset about but why is she using that specific one in the first place?? I feel so crazy getting this upset over a mug and that's why I haven't said anything to her, I feel like I'm overreacting. It's hard to even talk to her about it because she barely comes out of her room and I don't have her phone number or anything to text her. Sorry this is long ",3,1747980165.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

Bonus rin if you're staying sa Marina Spatial, it's literally a 5-min walk lang. Super convenient!

Dumaguete is the 4th city on my remote work journey since I promised myself that I‚Äôd really make the most out of the perks ng remote work this 2025. So far, the work-travel lifestyle has been amazing, esp to my mental health. Not so great for the wallet tho haha! Pero heyy, we'll learn to budget along the way naman.

I‚Äôm not a fun party person and I don‚Äôt bring anything to the table. I just want a group of friends to give a shit about me, or check in on me when I go quiet. All of my childhood friends have moved on from me to greener pastures, and I have such awful social phobia now that I can barely ask a barista for coffee. My affect is creepily flat because of my fear, and it makes me seem uninterested in people. I don't know how to express myself properly.

My family doesn't even know how to give me gifts, because we barely interact beyond surface level. My birthdays only serve to make me sadder. My dad never hugs me. My mom is dead.

I want to stay alive, but it's so hard. Every time I start feeling any genuine happiness, it's always followed by crushing disappointment. I'm not built in a way where I can function in this world. I'm fucking useless.

I'm supposed to be sleeping for work tomorrow but I can't stop crying. I keep thinking about how doomed I feel because of the childhood I had, and how the only times people bother talking to me are when strangers catcall me, or a barista takes my order, or my boss tells me to change how i work.

But what should I choose?,"With the recent debacles at Intel with their 13th and 14th Gen chips and occasional mention that similar things have happened with some AMD chips, I'm absolutely unsure where to go now from what I concurrently have installed. 

Having recently upgraded my GPU to an upper medium end one with the RTX 3060 Windforce (Gigabyte), I have now noticed that several games (even low requirement ones like hearthstone and disc the spire) peak my CPU usage out to 100% to the point where I can't have Firefox or Discord running simultaneously. At roughly 5¬Ω years of use it seems the i7 9700k needs replacement. 

I'm not looking for any beastly high end recommendations, my current gaming habits don't tend towards a massive upgrade, I'm merely looking for a safe and reliable upgrade that can run stuff like Helldivers II, Elite Dangerous, Ori and the Will of the Wisps  and the occasional AAA Singleplayer Game like god of war.

Seeing how my current CPU is coffee lake with a 1151 socket, I'd appreciate a compatible Mainboard recommendation with the one for a CPU.
I'm fairly certain my PSU, RAM and m.2 NVMe SSDs don't require any extra love since most of those received an upgrade/replacement of their own over the past 3 years.

I've been running Intel for years, but I don't mind swapping to AMD if it's just strictly the better choice. Just, as mentioned earlier, my confidence in choosing the right product has been shaken since I haven't been following the vmin shift instability thing all that closely.

I've had 7 procedures done in total over my lifetime starting at 11 for discoid meniscus and tearing. I'm 30 now. Diagnosed with OA around 20. I got a distal femoral osteotomy on one leg because it was apparently collapsing (alongside MACI and full meniscus allograft) and only partial transplants on cartilage and meniscus on the other leg. The ""other""(right leg) is not holding up well and my most recent mri is showing even more damage, some damage in places there wasnt just 2 years prior in my last mri. I feel something is wrong with my gait. The way I explain it to my orthos is that you don't feel/notice yourself breathing, you just do it.. but I feel every step I take, i hatdly but do remember a time walking felt effortless and unconscious. I'm in pain waking up to make coffee. I feel like my brain is telling me something is off. I have always felt the strain on my hip but this year it gradually turned to pain.


The pain is different from the knee pain im used to. Its more of a burn/pinch feeling and its only on my right side. The side opposite of where I had an osteotomy. I'm thinking I could be misaligned but I went to 3 knee specialists recently and they didn't have much to say. I'm thinking I should go to a hip and spine specialist. My hip is only getting worse and im already in pain every day. I cant imagine losing another joint. Has anyone experienced a similar progression of knee OA turning into hip degradation? I think the lopsided-ness I feel could potentially be from having an osteotomy on one side but not the other. My knee orthos haven't given me much to go on but my hip is getting worse at an alarming rate. If anyone has had similar knee issues progress to hip problems please share if you have any advice.

The story starts out with a miserable husband to only married his wife because she is rich (i think she was his bosses daughter, so he was set to inherit the business) and together they had a violent special needs son who was violent. at some point the son does something to either his teacher or his mother and gets institutionalised. This causes the wife to start drinking which makes her husband begin to hate her. Husband decides to visit his son to check on him and catches nurse touching his son in order to get him to ""fall asleep quicker"". This is where the story gets a little blurry for me because i remember the nurse touching the guys son really shocked me. Anyways, the man takes out nurse to coffee i think, and either falls in love with her or begs her to get his son to have a visit day home. either way the son goes home with his father and the father sets off the son (on purpose) and he kills the wife by slamming her head into a glass table (i think it was a glass table i forgot). Anyways thats all i remember and i really want to know how this book ends because this story keeps circulating in my head. Thank you to whoever finds this post its kind of an insane plot.

We met online, and from the first few dates, something inside me told me that she was special. I wanted to spend all my time with her. I wanted to learn everything about her‚Äîwhat she liked, what she didn‚Äôt like, what made her smile, what made her laugh. Every moment with her felt exciting and new. I had never felt so happy in a relationship before. She was so beautiful. To me, she was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. Not just her looks, but how she moved, how she talked, how she smiled, how she looked at me. She checked all my boxes. That means she had everything I ever wanted in a partner. We liked the same hobbies. We shared the same beliefs. We laughed at the same jokes. We enjoyed small things together, like watching movies, solving crosswords, playing trivia games. We had fun doing simple things. I remember thinking how lucky I was. I remember thinking this was the person I wanted to marry. I even looked forward to meeting her parents. I imagined a happy future together. I imagined a life of love and peace.



But over time, things started to change. At first, I didn‚Äôt understand what was happening. We started having arguments. Small disagreements would grow into loud fights. I told myself, ""This is okay. This is normal. Every couple argues."" In fact, I even thought it was a good thing at first. I had heard of something called ‚Äúhealthy conflict.‚Äù I had never really experienced it before, but I thought maybe this was what it looked like‚Äîtwo people who care about each other trying to work through problems together. I believed our relationship was growing stronger because we were facing hard things and not running away. But slowly, the arguments started to hurt more. They became more frequent. They became more intense. Sometimes, it felt like I didn‚Äôt know what kind of night we were going to have. Some nights were great. We laughed and held hands and talked about the future. Other nights, she would yell and say very mean things. She would storm out of the house or kick me out of hers. And what hurt most was that often these fights started over something small, something simple. Something I thought didn‚Äôt matter much at all. But she would take it in a way I didn‚Äôt expect, and the night would go bad from there.



At first, I thought I was doing something wrong. I believed the fights were my fault. So, I tried harder. I said sorry more. I gave more attention. I tried to fix everything. I wanted to make her happy. But as time went on, I became tired. I was giving all of myself to fix things, and it didn‚Äôt seem to help. I started to feel numb when she got angry. I stopped blaming myself. I still tried to be kind. I still listened when she was upset. I didn‚Äôt fight back with mean words. But inside, I was getting tired. I was getting scared too. You see, I grew up in a home where my father was abusive. He drank a lot. He hit my mother. He shouted at her. As a child, I was always afraid. I promised myself I would never be like that. I would never hurt someone I loved. So, when my fianc√©e would yell at me or throw things or say hateful things, I became afraid‚Äînot of her, but of what this kind of life might do to me after many years. Would I still be gentle? Would I still be kind? Would I break?



We had planned to get married three months ago. That was the date. But just weeks before that, something happened. One night, she came to my house at 3 in the morning, very angry. Another time, she threw her phone at me. These moments scared me. I told her we had to postpone the wedding. I said we were not ready. She agreed. We said we would wait and try to understand each other better. We said we would see a counselor, someone who could help us talk through things. But here we are now, three months away from the new wedding date, and I feel we haven‚Äôt grown. We haven‚Äôt healed. And now, there‚Äôs something else. Another problem.



I live in a small house about 10 minutes away from where she lives. I bought the house in 2019. It‚Äôs not a big house, but it‚Äôs mine. I‚Äôve made it feel like home. I got a good deal when I bought it‚Äîmy interest rate is low, which is rare now. But my fianc√©e hates the town I live in. She says she does not like anything about it. I asked her why many times, but I never got a clear answer. She just says she can‚Äôt imagine living there. So, back in February, when we delayed the wedding, we also agreed to try and move. She wanted me to sell my house and buy a new one in her town. I said I would think about it. Now, last week, she gave me an ultimatum. She said, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt put your house up for sale now, this relationship is over.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what to say. I was shocked. I felt trapped. Selling the house right now would be a terrible financial decision. I would lose money. I would have to take on a bigger loan at a higher interest rate. It could hurt my future. But once, I would have done it. I would have made the sacrifice. I would have said yes, just to make her happy. Now, I‚Äôm not so sure.



I talked to my therapist about all of this. He gave me advice I still think about. He said, ‚ÄúWhen you are rigid, you break. Marriage is about compromise.‚Äù That made sense to me. It‚Äôs true. A marriage cannot work if both people are stiff and refuse to change. But what happens when you are always the one compromising? What happens when the other person doesn‚Äôt meet you in the middle? What happens when you are giving up more than just your house‚Äîmaybe giving up your peace, your safety, your heart? I don‚Äôt have the answers yet. I‚Äôm still thinking. I‚Äôm still hurting.



Even though things have been so hard, I still love her. I really do. That‚Äôs what makes this so difficult. I look at her and I remember the fun times, the laughter, the dreams. I remember how we used to talk for hours, how we used to plan our future. I remember how much I wanted this to work. And now, I feel like I‚Äôm standing at a cliff, unsure whether to jump or walk away. Some days, I think I can fix it. I tell myself, ""Maybe if we try counseling, we can save this."" Other days, I feel like my heart is already halfway out the door. I just don‚Äôt know which part to listen to. My head says one thing. My heart says another. And in the middle, I just feel pain. Deep pain.



After thinking for many days and many nights, I still could not find peace in my heart. Each day felt heavier than the last. I would wake up in the morning with a knot in my chest. I would go to work and try to focus, but my mind would always go back to her. I kept asking myself the same questions over and over. Was I doing the right thing by staying? Was I doing the right thing by thinking of leaving? Was I just afraid of being alone? Was I just tired from carrying the weight of the whole relationship by myself? These thoughts would not leave me. They followed me like a shadow.



She called me almost every day. Some days, she sounded sweet and calm. She would tell me she missed me. She would tell me she loved me. Other days, her voice was full of anger. She would ask me why I hadn‚Äôt listed the house yet. She would say things like, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt care about me,‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre choosing a house over our love.‚Äù These words hurt me deeply because they weren‚Äôt true. I did care. I still loved her. But I also cared about my future. I also loved myself. I wanted to build a life that felt safe and strong, not one where I walked on eggshells, afraid that one small word might cause a storm.



I remembered one evening very clearly. We were sitting in her car outside my house. It was late, maybe around 10 p.m. The night was quiet. The streetlights were soft. I could hear the sound of crickets in the bushes. She looked at me with tears in her eyes and said, ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you just do this for me?‚Äù Her voice was soft this time, not angry. She wasn‚Äôt yelling. She wasn‚Äôt blaming me. She was just sad. And that made it harder. Because I could see that she was hurting too. I could see that she wanted things to work just like I did. But I also knew that love, by itself, wasn‚Äôt enough. Love needs trust. Love needs peace. Love needs two people who can fight for each other without hurting each other.



I didn‚Äôt have an answer for her that night. I just looked away and stared at the sky. I wanted to hold her and promise that everything would be okay. I wanted to believe that moving to her town would fix everything. But deep inside, I knew that the house wasn‚Äôt the real problem. It was just the last piece of a long puzzle full of pain and misunderstanding. The real problem was that we were not listening to each other anymore. We were trying to win instead of trying to love. We were speaking, but not hearing. We were close in distance but far in heart.



A few days later, I decided to talk to her again. I asked her if we could sit down, not to argue, not to fight, but just to talk. She agreed. We met at a quiet coffee shop. We sat in the back, away from everyone else. I took a deep breath and told her everything I felt. I told her I loved her. I told her I still wanted a future with her. But I also told her that I was afraid. I told her I was tired of the fighting, tired of the yelling, tired of feeling like nothing I did was ever enough. I told her that I couldn‚Äôt sell the house right now. Not because I didn‚Äôt care, but because I had to think about what was best for both of us. I told her that I needed us to go to counseling before we made any more big decisions. I told her I needed her to meet me halfway.



She sat there, quiet for a long time. She stirred her coffee but didn‚Äôt drink it. Then she looked up and said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I can do this anymore.‚Äù My heart dropped. I didn‚Äôt know what she meant. Did she mean the conversation? The relationship? The dream of marriage? I asked her, ‚ÄúDo what?‚Äù And she said, ‚ÄúWait. I don‚Äôt want to keep waiting. I want someone who chooses me now, not later.‚Äù I told her, ‚ÄúI am choosing you. I‚Äôm sitting here, talking with you, trying to save this.‚Äù She shook her head and said, ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt feel like it.‚Äù



That moment broke something inside me. Not because she didn‚Äôt understand me, but because I realized she may never understand me. She was seeing the house as a sign of my love, a test of my loyalty. I was seeing the house as a home I built with years of work, something I wanted to protect, just like I wanted to protect my heart. We were both right, and both wrong. We were both speaking from pain.



After that talk, we didn‚Äôt speak for a few days. I used that time to reflect. I took long walks. I went back to my therapist. I tried to look at the relationship from the outside, like a stranger looking in. What would I tell a friend in my situation? Would I tell him to stay? Would I tell him to leave? I couldn‚Äôt find a clear answer. That made everything harder.



One night, I was sitting on the couch in my living room. It was quiet. I had the lights off. I was just thinking. I looked around the room‚Äîthe photos on the wall, the books on the shelf, the soft rug on the floor. This was my space. I had built it. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it felt like mine. And in that moment, I felt something I hadn‚Äôt felt in a while. Peace. Just for a moment, everything was still. No voices. No arguments. Just quiet.



And that‚Äôs when I knew that I needed to make a choice soon. A real one. Not one based on guilt or fear. Not one made to please someone else. But one made from the deepest part of me, the part that wanted love, yes, but also peace, safety, kindness. I didn‚Äôt know yet what choice I would make. But I knew I had to make it. Not just for her. Not just for us. But for me.



The next morning, I woke up early. The sun had just started to rise, and golden light was pouring through my bedroom window. It was quiet again‚Äîso quiet that I could hear the sound of the birds outside. I stayed in bed for a few more minutes, just breathing, just thinking. I knew that something had changed inside me the night before. It was like my heart had whispered something soft but strong: ‚ÄúYou cannot live your life in fear.‚Äù I had been afraid for too long‚Äîafraid to hurt her, afraid to disappoint her, afraid to be alone. But the truth was, I was already feeling alone in the relationship. That was the hardest part to admit.



When I finally got up, I walked around the house slowly. I touched the walls, the kitchen counter, the old bookshelf in the living room. I had lived here for several years now, and every corner of the house held a memory. I remembered painting the walls late one night while listening to music. I remembered eating dinner alone at the kitchen table after a long day, grateful to have a space that was mine. I remembered sitting by the window and watching the rain fall during a hard season in life, feeling safe even when the world outside felt shaky. This house wasn‚Äôt just a building‚Äîit was a part of me. Selling it wouldn‚Äôt just be about money. It would be like giving up a piece of myself. And for what? For someone who couldn‚Äôt see how much I was already giving?



Later that day, I got a message from her. It was short: ‚ÄúAre we doing this or not?‚Äù My chest tightened when I read it. It didn‚Äôt sound like a question full of love or softness. It sounded like a business deal. Like an order. I sat with the message for a long time. I didn‚Äôt answer right away. I wanted to be careful. I wanted my next words to be honest‚Äînot rushed, not reactive, but true. Because this time, I couldn‚Äôt afford to lie to myself or to her. Too much had been said. Too much had been felt.



I finally wrote back, slowly, carefully. I told her I needed one more honest conversation before I could decide anything. I asked her to meet me at a park near my house‚Äîa quiet place with trees and open space, where we could talk without walls between us. She agreed. We met that evening. She arrived first, sitting on a bench under a big oak tree. When I walked up, she looked at me, and for a moment, her face softened. I sat next to her. We didn‚Äôt speak right away. We just watched the wind move through the leaves.



Then I began.



I told her again that I loved her. That hadn‚Äôt changed. But I also told her that I could not sell my house right now. I told her this wasn‚Äôt just about a house or a town. It was about how we treated each other. It was about how I felt small every time she raised her voice or used words like weapons. It was about the fear I felt when she threw things or threatened to walk out. I told her that I believed in growth, in healing, but only if we both wanted it. I told her I couldn‚Äôt be the only one bending. I couldn‚Äôt be the only one breaking just to keep the pieces together.



She listened. At first, she didn‚Äôt say much. Her eyes stayed fixed on the ground. Then she said something I didn‚Äôt expect. She said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to stop being angry.‚Äù Her voice cracked as she said it. ‚ÄúSometimes, I just see red. I feel like I‚Äôm drowning in my own emotions, and I don‚Äôt know how to climb out.‚Äù That was the most honest thing I had heard her say in months. And in that moment, I felt something I hadn‚Äôt felt in a long time‚Äîcompassion. I saw not just the woman who had hurt me, but also the woman who was hurting inside. I saw her pain. I saw her fear.



I reached for her hand, and for the first time in a while, she didn‚Äôt pull away. I said, ‚ÄúMaybe we‚Äôre both carrying pain we don‚Äôt understand. Maybe we both need help.‚Äù She nodded slowly. I asked her again if she would go to counseling with me. This time, she said yes. Not out of anger. Not as a way to fix things quickly. But because, for the first time, she saw that we couldn‚Äôt keep doing this alone. We both needed someone to help us see more clearly.



So we agreed: no big decisions for now. No house selling. No wedding planning. Just counseling. Just time to heal. Just time to see if love, real love, could survive this.



The next few weeks were slow. We met with a counselor once a week. At first, it was hard. We both cried. We both shared stories from our pasts that we hadn‚Äôt shared before. She told me about how her parents fought all the time when she was young. She said she learned to yell because it was the only way she was ever heard. I told her about my father. I told her about the nights I used to hide in my room, hoping he wouldn‚Äôt come home drunk. We started to understand each other in new ways. Not perfectly. Not easily. But honestly.



Sometimes, I would leave those sessions feeling hopeful. Sometimes, I would leave feeling more confused than ever. But at least we were doing the work. At least we were finally facing the truth.



One night, after a session, we sat in my car. It was raining. The soft sound of water on the windshield filled the silence. She turned to me and said, ‚ÄúDo you think we can really make it?‚Äù I thought about it for a moment, then said, ‚ÄúI think we can try. I think trying is the bravest thing we can do right now.‚Äù She smiled, just a little. Then she rested her head on my shoulder.



We didn‚Äôt solve everything in a few weeks. Some days were good. Some days were hard. But something had shifted. The yelling stopped. The threats stopped. We started talking again‚Äînot just about our problems, but about life, about hope, about dreams. I still wasn‚Äôt sure if we were meant to be together forever. But I knew we were starting to build something different‚Äîsomething healthier, something deeper.



And maybe, just maybe, that was enough for now.

Gradually, over the last year, my motivation to work out has slowly been eroding. I still wake up every morning before work and the rest of my family, drink a cup of coffee and do some type of exercise, but more and more it just feels like I‚Äôm going through the motions. Two years ago my workouts were an hour 6x a week, with 10 minutes of cardio after each session. One year ago they were about 45 minutes 6x/week with cardio a couple times a week after. Now they are 25-30 minutes 5x/week, with brisk walking on an incline treadmill in between sets. 

I understand something is better than nothing. But to be honest, I don‚Äôt enjoy it. I workout from home with adjustable DBs, because that‚Äôs my only option, and I really just start the clock anxiously waiting to hit 30 minutes so I can stop.

I am a low-key traveler, less interested in lots checking off lots of sites and more interested in immersing myself in local culture, food, hanging out in a square and reading, and generally decompressing from hectic life in the US. 

This is my ""me"" time. I tend to focus on interesting food experiences (I have my eye on a couple of dining places in Tallinn), history (WWII history seems like it could be quite interesting), walking tours, architecture, wandering through neighborhoods, coffee, and such.

I am in my mid 50s and have traveled quite a bit. I am low maintenance. I like eastern European/Nordic culture and want more. For example, pelmeni is an enormous favorite of mine.

So, my dilemma is how to spend my time. My original thought was land in Tallinn, train/bus to Riga to stay 5-6 days, and then go back to Tallin for the remainder of my trip, and then my flight home. Is this too narrow? Should I add Vilnius?  Are their major things that fit my ""travel profile"" 

I would be missing by focusing on these two towns. I have no issue hopping on a bus or train to wherever, but I am not up for renting a car.

So what if his ""clean"" is  that he had to sleep with his producer continually? The after tapes suggest he was no stranger to people sexualizing and harassing him. Maybe it started a s afuck it, why not thing, but bothered him more and more as time went on.

I have an m1 MacBook Air from around 2019/2020 and spilled around half a mug of iced coffee across the keyboard of it. I was shocked it took me a second then I flipped it over while I quickly changed shirts and used the clean side of the shirt I was wearing prior to wipe off the majority of the spill before going in with tissue, I also turned it off manually at this time so nothing (SEEMS) like it shorted upon impact. I had it flipped over for around an hour or more afterwards and nothing was leaking out visibly, so I ended up taking out all the keys, going in with dry tissue to get out any dirt or wetness, and cleaned each individual key and key space with 99% isopropyl alcohol. Looking back I should have let it sit for longer because touching the keys when cleaning sometimes prompted it the boot up to the password screen, during this time I did observe 3. things though: 1, every key was still lighting up luckily 2, it appeared to spam a couple keys on its own but none of the physically keys stick to the keyboard and 3. the cursor moved just fine however it was kind of flashing in and out a little bit. So as of after the spill, the actual screen still works and is responsive (but I am aware that might not be the case in a day or a few months time). now as I write this, it‚Äôs been hours since the incident, I haven‚Äôt turned it on since, and it is currently sitting face down into a towel and will stay like that overnight.

I'm on metoprolol (50 mg/day). I quit vaping/smoking two months ago. Still drink coffee, and my diet isn‚Äôt great ‚Äî fast food is hard to avoid when you're too tired to cook.

Mentally, it‚Äôs been tough ‚Äî depression, isolation, difficulty with relationships. I‚Äôm scheduled for a contrast MRI soon to check for fibrosis and see if surgery is an option, just now I'm on my way to make some blood tests.

Anyone else dealing with this kind of fatigue + arrhythmia? Has surgery helped? How do you handle the anxiety and not knowing how far you can push yourself?

It's like clockwork: I build a steady gym habit, then bam, a week away, and it's back to square one. üò© Anyone else?

I've tried habit stacking a la habit guru James Clear‚Äîpushing my morning coffee and workout together. But my travel rhythm just doesn't play ball. I think it's the combo of unfamiliar settings and a lack of structure. There's something about not having my usual schedule that makes the couch way more appealing.

I thought having an accountability partner would help, so I roped in my friend after our last trip. She's awesome, but still, we both fell into lazy vacation mode. 

I've read (I think?) that disrupting cues can break a habit loop, and maybe these trips do that...idk. Losing the visual cues like my gym shoes by the door and the mental cue of finishing work must have a bigger impact than I realized.

Might be time to redesign my travel environment a bit, like packing workout gear intentionally in sight, and setting a small, non-gym exercise goal while away. Or maybe just embrace the flow and see it as a forced rest period.

My sweet lovely husband went from a loving caring person to a homeless crackhead in less than half a year.¬†I wanted to hold on so bad. I thought he needed love and not to be left alone, I was an addict too but every hit killed my soul a little more than the last one and I just could not comprehend what he felt different or why he continued despite being so close to death, to being kidnapped, laced, or worse. I wanted to understand so badly, to be by his side to catch him whenever he needed it, to let him know he was not alone. I finally understood he had no intention to stop, that I cannot save him, only he can, and that he is the one who chose that path and it is the one he wants to follow, and that, he did wanted to be left alone and I was being nothing but a pain in the ass in that path, and that I was no longer his lovely dear wifey he wanted to keep safe and hold dearly to his chest. And that he wanted to be as far as possible to not have to share his hits and to not have someone worrying about our safety, because he did not care about that, he just wanted to die.  
  
The last time I saw him I said to him ‚ÄúI hope someone makes your wish to die come true sometime soon‚Äù and maybe you would say I am a horrible person for saying it, but truth is, after seeing the person you care the most about smoking burnt metal and carpet surfing for days, after spending all your money in failed rehab, clothes and food that ends up sold in a trap house in exchange for a hit, after watching everything that once was fall away, after having a loved one disappear for days with no trace and thinking they might have got him this time, just for him to comeback one more time at 4 am stinking and dirty asking for money or trying to steal from you‚Ä¶ The next time he‚Äôs gone you really do say, this time, please just stay dead.¬†  
  
I wish someone grants your wish, so that you can abandon this torment of a mind that has you kidnapped, and won‚Äôt allow you to think of anything else than the next shit hit that does not even hit at this point, leave this aching body with rotten teeth and failing lungs, please just go ahead and take a rest, and come back as a beautiful bird that will sing the lovely songs you used to play in your guitar, fly free in the skies like you always dreamed of, and wear feathers with colors that no one has ever seen before, like the ones I see in your eyes. Let us remember you like the sweet little boy with the tragic fate that will always be in our hearts to brighten us with a smile from heaven, rather than to become a sleepless night and a heartbreak worse than a knife directly in the heart every time we hear the news and wonder where you are, when was the last time you ate, when was the last time you were hugged and told that you are loved and worthy, to have to remember all those times we were not worthy enough for you, to the point your happiness was found in a cheap hit burning in your lips and lungs rather than a deep warm hug full of love and a cup of coffee, wondering where it all went wrong, and what we could have done different.  
  
This time, please just stay dead

Just wanted to share my experience working with Data Annotation (DA) since I‚Äôve noticed more people are curious about legit WFH options. I‚Äôve been using the platform for about a year and a half now, and it‚Äôs helped me make over $15,000 whilst finishing up my degree in Business and Marketing here in the UK.

DA is similar to platforms like Outlier since you evaluate AI models, write prompts, give feedback, and work on a bunch of different projects. Some are creative, some technical, and some just need your honest opinion. I‚Äôve worked on projects related to bilingual content, finance, business, safety, accuracy, and even a few STEM ones. Some require experience, but many are accessible even if you don‚Äôt have a formal background in the topic.

The best part about this job has been working from home or wherever I‚Äôve got WiFi and coffee ‚òï. The platform has become my main income source since graduating, and I‚Äôm now at nearly full-time earnings, completely remote. Payouts take about a week to verify, but you can withdraw every three days. Work volume can vary, but if you‚Äôre consistent and qualify for different project types, there‚Äôs real potential here. You do sign an NDA, so I can‚Äôt go into detail on the specific companies I‚Äôve worked with, but they‚Äôre the biggest companies, especially in the AI field. Like any freelance or remote gig, there can be dry spells. However, this is the best remote platform I have worked for and have consistently been able to work. Whether a student, recent grad, or just looking for more flexibility, this has been a game-changer for me.

  
Now I‚Äôm documenting the journey: the wins, the losses, and everything in between. üíª

I‚Äôve also set up a Discord community ‚Äî **WFH Earners Club** ‚Äî for anyone who wants to get into remote work, learn how to qualify for projects, share progress, and stay motivated. Whether you're new to this or turning side gigs into full-time income, it's a space to connect, co-work, and grow together. Discord link: [https://discord.gg/h4z8TefppN](https://discord.gg/h4z8TefppN)

If you‚Äôre trying to build your own remote work lifestyle, come join us. We‚Äôre building something real, and it‚Äôs better when we do it together.

I know it‚Äôs important to fuel your body and hit a calorie goal, but is it really healthy to force yourself to eat when your body is clearly saying no thanks?

Zepbound makes you feel full longer and most of us are on it because we‚Äôve struggled with overeating or using food for comfort, not because we need to hit a calorie minimum every single day.

I‚Äôm not saying we should starve ourselves, or never eat, but does listening to your body mean you eat when not you‚Äôre actually hungry? So if you end up fasting one day because you‚Äôre not hungry, is it bad or is it better to force feed yourself?

I mean, who doesn't, right? üòÖ But then I started noticing how I was feeling super exhausted during the day, and it wasn‚Äôt just cuz of lack of sleep‚Äîmy moods were all over the place, like witout any good reason.

I finally decided to try leaving my phone in the living room an hour before bed for a week, just as an experiment. I didn't think it'd make such a big difference, but you know what? It sorta snowballed into a whole bunch of other positive changes. Suddenly, I was sleeping better, waking up feeling refreshed instead of moody and grumpy. 

It was like this one change improved so many things! I started to have more energy for morning workouts (which I kept skipping), and even my early morning coffee tasted better. It got me thinking about how interconnected our habits really are. Breaking one bad habit seemed to unlock a bunch of good ones.

It's fascinating, if you ask me. It was hard at first, like my fingers would itch to grab the phone, but eventually, flipping to a book or journaling deffo feels more relaxing. The spillover effect into other areas of my life has been eye-opening. Anyone else experienced something similar? ü§î",3,1747975567.0,habitDecoded,0,1.0,False

She's currently using a crappy Krups XP1000 that doesn't even make ""real"" espresso. She tries to hack it to make as strong of liquid as the Krups can make, but it obviously doesn't come close to real espresso from a machine that can actually reach 9 bar.

My mom is one of those older folk who prefers to drink dark roast bitter coffee. Obviously this is very different from the usual preferences of members of this sub who are looking for a balanced shot, as my mom pretty much prefers what is the definition of an unbalanced shot: on the overextracted side. With that being said, that's probably good for my wallet lol because it means I don't need to go for an expensive machine, right? Any recommendations for machines preferably under ~$150 that are reliable and pleasant to use? She has a Baratza Encore so the espresso machine would ideally be able to make decent espresso from beans ground from the Encore. Bonus points if it can also make half-decent balanced espresso for milk-based drinks for when I come over and use the machine for myself. Thanks!",1,1747975458.0,espresso,9,1.0,False

Quick Facts about me, including but not limited to:

 - Pretty generalist nerd. I touched a little of every hobby. I'll make time to game with friends but nowadays, i've been playing more chess than anything else.

 - Music head. Just had a discussion with a coworker about musical upbringings and I always find it interesting on what people were raised listening to vs their tastes today. Always open to new music suggestions.

 - Learning Junkie. I'm always trying to learn something to put into use. I don't have to learn anything for this interview tbh but there are a few things i was always curious about and this is as good an excuse as any. Especially if it's home/car repair related.

Just wanted to share a fun experience for anyone looking for something different to do in Tacoma. If you haven‚Äôt been to a *paint and sip* night yet, you might want to give it a try. Whether you‚Äôre planning a date night, hanging out with friends, or flying solo, it‚Äôs a creative and surprisingly relaxing way to spend an evening.

There‚Äôs something about putting a brush to canvas with a drink in hand that just works. You don‚Äôt need any experience, the instructors walk you through it, and it‚Äôs way more about the fun than the final result.

# What‚Äôs a Paint and Sip Night?

It‚Äôs a guided painting session held at a coffee shop, wine bar, or art studio. You follow along with an instructor to paint a specific piece, while sipping on your drink of choice. Most places offer wine, beer, or cocktails, but some go the coffee or mocktail route.

It‚Äôs social, casual, and just a fun way to switch things up from the usual bar scene or dinner plan. People go for birthdays, date nights, team bonding, or just to try something new.

# Where To Go in Tacoma

**üé® Uncorked Canvas**  
This one‚Äôs a Tacoma favorite. They host themed painting nights where you follow along and create pieces like starry skies, pop art, flowers, or scenic views. Their instructors are friendly and encouraging, and even if your painting doesn‚Äôt come out like the sample, you‚Äôll still be proud of it.

You can book solo or with a group, bring your own drinks, and just enjoy the night. They also offer virtual classes and private parties if you want something more personal.

[Check them out here](https://uncorkedcanvas.com/tacoma/)

**‚òï Campfire Coffee x Artvana**  
Campfire Coffee already has a cool vibe, but when Artvana hosts painting nights there, it turns into something special. Picture rustic interiors, cozy lighting, a relaxed crowd, and instructors that make it all feel natural.

These events sometimes include prize giveaways or fun themes, so there‚Äôs always something a little extra going on. It‚Äôs perfect if you‚Äôre more of a coffee fan, or just want something mellow and creative.

# Why It‚Äôs Actually Worth It

**You don‚Äôt need to be artistic**  
Everything is step-by-step. You‚Äôre not being judged, and you‚Äôll probably surprise yourself with what you can do.

**It‚Äôs relaxing**  
Painting helps you focus, unwind, and stop thinking about everything else for a while. It‚Äôs like a creative form of stress relief.

**You‚Äôll meet people**  
Even if you go alone, you‚Äôll end up chatting with people around you. It‚Äôs an easy way to socialize without pressure.

**You take home a memory**  
You leave with your own canvas, and even if it‚Äôs not perfect, it‚Äôs yours. Way better than a bar tab and a hangover.

# Tips for Your First Time

* Book early, especially for weekends
* Wear something you don‚Äôt mind getting paint on, just in case
* Don‚Äôt overthink it, just go with the flow
* Bring someone fun, or go solo and make new friends
* Take photos, it‚Äôs fun to see your progress

# Who Should Try It

* **Couples** looking for a fun, low-key date idea
* **Friends** who want a chill night out that isn‚Äôt loud or expensive
* **Parents and adult kids** looking for something to do together that‚Äôs not awkward
* **Solo folks** who want to try something creative without any pressure

# Final Thoughts

Tacoma has always been full of creative energy and community, and paint and sip events are a great example of that. They‚Äôre welcoming, stress-free, and honestly just a fun way to spend an evening.

If you‚Äôre feeling stuck in a routine or want to try something different, this might be it. You don‚Äôt need to be an artist. Just show up, sip something you like, paint a little, and see what happens.

You might find a new hobby, meet new people, or at the very least, leave with something you made and a good story to tell.

And the wine doesn‚Äôt hurt either.",1,1747974861.0,u_thereeldeal480,0,1.0,False

[Spoiler] (not)","(Note I written this a little while ago so if events or character personalities aren't portrayed correctly, that's why!)

Lamb to the Slaughter, Peachyville:

	The room itself was static, the night was young. And just as every night like this, Trudy is bent over her sewing machine, working on her six month project. A simple fedora with a small pocket stitched into it; to confine a small photo that would either be their honeymoon photos‚Äô, or a family picture. Also encrusted in the hat was a signature of her‚Äôs, once since she was a famous seamstress. Every couple of minutes Trudy would glance over at the table top clock, a present her dearest Tucker invented, just as a gift to her. She only felt joy when looking at that clock; sometimes touching it just to remind herself of her husband. Even his imperfections, his wrinkled hands, his very apparent freckles on said hands; every part of him only made her want Tucker to come home faster.
	Once it was a quarter till ten Trudy began to look out the window, Alining candles, flipping blankets and pillows to keep the time passing. Every second Tucker wasn‚Äôt there, only scared Trudy. He‚Äôs never home this late. She wondered if she should take a nap, do her hair, flip the pillows and blankets again. Five minutes after ten she finally heard the noises of Tucker‚Äôs car. Her anxiety had quickly cleansed into contempt. Before greeting Tucker; Trudy flipped the pillows one more time and brushed all the dust on to the apron fixed to her dress. Standing in the living room waiting for Tucker to get out of the car, close the door, walk on the pavement brick up to their porch, walk up to the door, insert the key into the keyhole, twist the key and open the door, but there was a very noticeable hesitation of Tucker to even turn off the car. Something bad had happened at work. Even then Trudy had sat very patiently at her sewing station, glancing at the still turned on automobile that was outside.
	Once Tucker was outside his car; Trudy laid her sewing machine aside and walked up to the door. Greeting him with a kiss, then taking off his coat.
	‚ÄúHello, honey.‚Äù Trudy said, in a sort of melody whilst clinging the coat onto the coat rack.
	‚ÄúHello, dear.‚Äù Tucker responded. Fumbling towards the couch and laying down. 
Tucker's noticeable exhaustion only had Trudy worried. She swiftly walked towards her sewing station, turning on the machine, the droning of the machine had only broken the static of the silence, a new silence had been created. The noise of the machine hadn‚Äôt been noticeable, especially to Trudy, an answer is what she wanted, something other than then the constant mechanism that punctured Tuckers hat. Tucker reached over to the empty table in front of him. While noticing nothing was on the table he groaned.
‚ÄúSorry dear, I‚Äôve just been so busy I probably forgot, please forgive me!‚Äù Trudy turned off her machine again and ran towards the kitchen.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fine honey, It‚Äôs been a long day for all of us.‚Äù
Trudy emerged from the kitchen with a freshly cleaned, steel ringed wine rack, glasses, glass pots with chinese patterns, and a dark golden liquor enclosed inside a glass bottle. With steady hands, Trudy placed all the glasses on top of the table.
‚ÄúThe lights are hurting my eyes Trudy, mind turning them off?‚Äù Tucker asked,
‚ÄúOf course, dear.‚Äù Moving away from the table and towards the light switch; turning it off left and irritating red glow between the blinds, a light in columns that blanketed the living room. Trudy stood by the light switch waiting for any further instructions. It hadn‚Äôt taken long for Tucker to notice.
‚ÄúJesus, Trudy, it‚Äôs not like you're a robot, you can sit down!‚Äù Tucker exclaimed. The sudden bluntness of Tucker‚Äôs deliverance stunned Trudy, cocking her head to the left in surprise. 
She ushered over to the coffee table and poured two drinks, a heavy one for Tucker and a less heavy one for herself. She walked over to her sewing station and twisted the chair towards Tucker, enjoying just the view of him laying down rubbing his temples. After a couple of seconds that felt like hours, Tucker propped himself on the sofa and reached for the drink on top of a stained glass coaster, swearling it before chugging it down with a single gulp. Trudy didn't drink yet, tapping the rim of the glass whilst watching Tucker swallow his. Tucker stumbled forward trying to grab the golden yellow whisky.
‚ÄúHere let me grab you some, you‚Äôre obviously in no condition to do it yourself!‚Äù Trudy got up before being scolded by Tucker, ‚ÄúSit down.‚Äù
Trudy again tooken back Tucker‚Äôs remarks before sitting down again. Gathering himself, Tucker poured another glass.
‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt want to, we don‚Äôt have to go out to dinner. Just tell me what you want and I‚Äôll cook it up for you, we have it in our food cellar.‚Äù
‚ÄúTrudy, Sit Down.‚Äù
‚ÄúTucker what‚Äôs going on, you‚Äôre scaring me.‚Äù Trudy looked closer to Tucker, a prominent frown plastered on his face. Before placing the glass back down onto the coaster, Tucker took one last big gulp before facing Trudy. The couple strips of red light peeking through the window revealed Tucker‚Äôs eyes, guilt, regret, but also anger, and betrayal. Trudy sat up straight, again cocking her head to the left.
‚ÄúI want to leave you.‚Äù Tucker clasped his hands together, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not because of you, Trudy; I love you; I‚Äôm just. I‚Äôve been seeing someone.‚Äù
Trudy didn‚Äôt know what to think, she at first wanted to deny this remark, she‚Äôs done everything for Tucker. Given him food, bared his son. She wanted this to just be a sick joke. She knew he wasn't joking.
‚ÄúFor how long?‚Äù Trudy asked,
‚ÄúLonger than I‚Äôd like to admit.‚Äù Tucker replied.
‚ÄúIs there something I did wrong, I can be better, better than her. I did everything for you!‚Äù Trudy‚Äôs agitation grew, confusion, betrayal. Why leave now, why leave her, her family, his promise to her; his promise to make a family with her.
‚ÄúTucker, this isn‚Äôt fair! What did I do to you, Why are you leaving me! Leaving me if I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong! What did I do Tucker! Tell me! Tell Me Now!‚Äù
‚ÄúTrudy you don‚Äôt understand let me explain, it‚Äôs just-‚Äù Tucker‚Äôs calm demeanor, the soft quiet guilt in his voice only angered Trudy more.
‚ÄúI DON'T GET WHAT! Tell me, educate me as to what I don't know, to flee from me, run away from me, Our family! To spend time with this other woman.‚Äù 
‚ÄúTrudy, you're scaring me,‚Äù Tucker‚Äôs irritatingly calm response to her screaming, legitimate complaints, left only disbelief, anguish and anger in Trudy. These tears of hers weren‚Äôt of sadness, they were of anger, pure rage.
‚ÄúTrudy you don‚Äôt get it, you‚Äôre the other woman.‚Äù
Couldn‚Äôt get her eyes to open wide, not wide enough to that, that love she had for Tucker, loving him for his minor imperfections turned into traits she despised. She was never grateful for any of the gifts Tucker gave her, those vacation tickets, those inventions, small gadgets and trinkets Tucker gave to her was to only keep her stay put, not ask questions, not suspect their love for each other. How could she be so gullible, she wanted to crawl out of her skin, she wanted to rip out his bones, her own bones. Use his nerves for the strings of a harp and she wanted to pluck every single one of them. Use his skin and hair for her new clothing line. The promise Tucker gave her, to treat and make her life better. All the sacrifices she made for Tucker, for her kid, her home, and community.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll start dinner.‚Äù With her head down she stumbled towards the kitchen and into the cellar. This time Tucker didn‚Äôt stop her. She was automatic, she couldn‚Äôt believe herself, not for the fact she was the side piece of a marriage that may or may not have kids, a wife who may or may not be happier. She opened the Freezer hatchet without thought, it was just muscle memory, to grab the first thing her hand landed on and cook that. It was the leg of a lamb. Alright, she was having lamb. The lamb was covered in a clear plastic bag wrapped over and over again to create cover and a ‚ÄúLove Your Husband!‚Äù sticker sticking the end of the bag to the rest of the bag. Trudy ripped the bag apart as opposed to the usual delicate peeling she would care for when cooking her meals. The sticker was taunting her. She crumpled the paper and threw it in front of her, stepping on it on her way out.
Her sorrow has not processed how heavy the lamb was, she hadn‚Äôt thought of it until she heard the thump of the lamb hitting the kitchen counter.
‚ÄúTrudy, don't make me dinner, I‚Äôm going out.‚Äù Tucker had his back turned to Trudy, looking through the window, his hands behind his back. He looked precariously at the billboard across the street.
‚ÄúWith whom, your actual wife, does she have kids, a child she‚Äôs got the burden of caring for because of his deadbeat father.‚Äù No matter how hard she‚Äôd tried to sound a semblance of emotion, it could only come across salty, venomous.
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt forget about your son, I‚Äôve lended you money so I contributed some, what else do you need from me?‚Äù Tucker turned to Trudy, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cry Trudy, it would be bad for my job.‚Äù Trudy‚Äôs grip on the lamb only tightened, It only felt like instinct. She walked to Tucker, the lamb in her hand.
‚ÄúTucker you can‚Äôt leave!‚Äù
‚ÄúJesus Trudy, let this go, you‚Äôre acting emotional right now.‚Äù
Involuntarily Trudy raised the lamb above Tucker‚Äôs head, the shadow didn‚Äôt go unnoticed. With a sickening crunch, Tucker stumbled over to the side; away from the window. In desperation, Tucker grabbed onto anything he could get a reliable grasp on. Before he could protest, Trudy again; with full force, struck the lamb on to the top of Tucker‚Äôs head, and another sickening crunch was heard, however a noticeable couple of bones have been dislocated from Tucker‚Äôs neck. Before Tucker could fall over, Trudy saw fear for the first time in Tucker‚Äôs eyes. His eyes were open, which wasn‚Äôt unnatural, but felt wrong to look at. For a moment Trudy thought Tucker was still alive, before his body hit the floor without a pulse.
‚ÄúAlright, I did it, I killed a man.‚Äù It took too long for Trudy to realize what she‚Äôd done, one after another emotions of relief, fear, sadness, and anger consumed her, painting in her head like some sick portrait. Trudy threw the lamb onto a baking sheet, shoved it into the oven; put it on high, and left.
She then just grabbed her bag, knocked a couple of things, and went to her car. She rehearsed the lines over and over again, ‚Äòcan I have potatoes and peas?‚Äù Her voice was peculiar, she tried it again, this time it sounded awkward. She practiced the line until it sounded natural. ‚ÄúYes Man, can I have some potatoes, oh and a can of peas.‚Äù She rehearsed it a couple of more times until it felt natural; after she had rehearsed she put the keys into the ignition and drove off. Whilst driving, Trudy hadn‚Äôt thought of the situation she got herself in. Sure she knew she was making an alibi for herself, however what would happen if she were caught. She couldn‚Äôt let that happen, not with a family soon. Being the widow to a famous genius inventor, secrets, lies, and deception were not things she was foreign too. However she's' better than Tucker, She‚Äôs‚Äô not lying, She‚Äôs‚Äô simply acting. However a noticeable paranoia was present in Trudy, she‚Äôs never been so focused, focused on minor or insignificant details in trees or the shades of light that illuminate the streets.

‚ÄúHey Man.‚Äù Trudy smiled as if she were forced to, ‚Äúforgot some things, see we usually eat out at the end of every week; Me and Tucker. Tucker was just too tired so we decided not tonight.‚Äù Her forced smile widened
‚ÄúHmh, good man, you‚Äôre really lucky Trudy to have a devoted man like Tucker be your husband, even after creating the best invention, the garage door, and they‚Äôre still making him work.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell the perks of being the‚Ä¶,‚Äù Trudy hesitated for a second before stuttering, ‚ÄúWife of a famous inventor.‚Äù
Trudy‚Äôs uncertainty hadn‚Äôt gone unnoticed. ‚ÄúYou feeling okay Mrs. Trout?‚Äù Trudy had studied these lines before, over and over again and still the harsh reality sprung back to her, she had to stop herself from crying.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm-fine, It‚Äôs just been a long day for all of us.‚Äù Trudy‚Äôs face contorts, a smile still plastered on her face.
‚ÄúI wouldn't want to push this issue any further but it‚Äôs obvious you‚Äôre not okay.‚Äù
Trudy hadn‚Äôt thought of this happening, on one hand; If she were to expose Tucker's secret, call the police; that would give her a motive, and would have made her a suspect. But if she were to come up with a lie, the police could check to see if she was telling the truth.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just, what If I‚Äôm not good enough as a wife, I‚Äôve done everything for Tucker and yet, I still feel‚Ä¶Stail? It‚Äôs not coming to me right now but I hope you understand.‚Äù Trudy couldn‚Äôt help but let a couple of tears slip from her eyes.
‚ÄúOh! Well, I can‚Äôt relate specifically but I think I understand,‚Äù Man looks at Trudy, with both sympathy and understanding, ‚ÄúWould it be like being numb or stuck in a sense.‚Äù
‚ÄúIn a sense, I would hate to waste your time.‚Äù Trudy took out a check book whilst also taking out tissues to wipe the mascara that was running down her cheek, small chunks of clotted eyeliner blackened Trudy‚Äôs tears.
‚ÄúOh no I really don‚Äôt mind, not a lot of people come in here this late anyways, want a smoke, it‚Äôs on the house.‚Äù
‚ÄúReally, you‚Äôd do that for me?‚Äù Trudy wiped away her tears and stuffed the tissues back into her already cluttered purse.
‚ÄúTake a smoke for a second, here I have something of my own to share.‚Äù Leaning against the counter, handing Trudy a cigar, Man cleared his throat as if he were about to give a speech.
‚ÄúI have a crush on someone, here, right in peachyville.‚Äù
‚ÄúReally.‚Äù Trudy couldn‚Äôt care, she was digging through her purse, locking and unlocking pockets, whenever she was overwhelmed with the amount of unnecessary trash in her purse, she would rub the leather texture of her purse on the third joint of her pointer finger. Once she finally found a lighter she tried striking it, It hadn‚Äôt lit, she tried again, it again hadn‚Äôt lit. After a couple more failed attempts, she let her arms go limp in defeat as an exasperated sigh escaped her mouth. Man looked at Trudy with a mix of amusement but also worried, taking his own lighter out, he helped Trudy light her cigarette.
‚ÄúSo, about this crush.‚Äù said Trudy as she let out the smoke from her lungs.
‚ÄúReally, I thought you got bored of me.‚Äù Man lit his own cigar, ‚ÄúIf you insist, There is this particular car salesman. He‚Äôs hot headed, but I promise you I can fix him.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhich salesman, there are like three of those over here‚Ä¶for some reason.‚Äù
‚ÄúHis name is Tony. I saw him in the operating room the other day, the dumbass broke his arm. Apparently a teenager, big dude, walked in and fought Tony. His reason, because Tony denied his service.‚Äù
‚ÄúA teenager fighting a grown man, put that on the papers.‚Äù Trudy once again took another puff of her cigarette.
‚ÄúYeah, big threat this teenager is, he mostly goes after a teen, his name; Francis. He got bullied so much he almost jumped, his parents gave him a lobotomy however so he‚Äôs all fine now,‚Äù Man took one last puff before spitting the cigar out of his mouth onto the ground, stomping on it to light it out, ‚ÄúSo, about those potatoes and peas; want Idaho potatoes?‚Äù
‚ÄúOh yes; two of those please!‚Äù exclaimed Trudy, this time her tone was brighter, bouncier. Her sudden change in demeanor was noticed by Man.
‚ÄúFeeling better Trudy?‚Äù asked Man.
‚ÄúYeah, I needed that,‚Äù Trudy said, ‚ÄúI need to get back home now, If I don‚Äôt; dinner might be burnt. Can‚Äôt let Tucker go through that.‚Äù
‚ÄúSpeaking of Tucker, tired; you said? He must be out like a light by now!‚Äù
‚ÄúYou have no Idea.‚Äù 
‚ÄúYeah, I wouldn‚Äôt know, but for what it‚Äôs worth, I think you‚Äôre doing great, you‚Äôre a great person Trudy, and an even better wife.‚Äù
Leaving to get the peas and potatoes, Trudy was left alone. The occasional ticking of the clock kept her awake. After stripping a family of a father, killing said father, crying her eyes out, and smoking afterwards, Trudy was exhausted. She could only think to herself if she should Finish the rest of her alibi tomorrow and sleep tonight, but she knew she needed to get her alibi done as fast as possible.
‚ÄúHere you go Mrs. Trout.‚Äù Man handed over a small brown paper bag of peas, Idaho potatoes, and a bouquet of white and red roses.
‚ÄúIs this your idea of asking me out on a date?‚Äù Trudy remarked, ‚ÄúI hate to be the bearer of bad news but I'm married.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, no no no, those aren't for you, those are for‚Ä¶Tony. Mind dropping them off at his residence before heading home?‚Äù 
‚ÄúDo you know where he lives?‚Äù
‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶However he may be in his office, at the car dealership.‚Äù
‚ÄúI'll see what I can do. Thanks, really; I needed that smoke.‚Äù Trudy then left, one hand carrying Tony‚Äôs flowers; and the other, her alibi.
On her drive to Tony‚Äôs Cars! Cars! Cars!, she convinced herself that she was just Trudy, a trad wife coming home from her local supermarket to feed her dearest Tucker. He's at home hungry. She even started to hum a tune to forget the night she had.
Stopping at Tony‚Äôs there was a single janitor mopping the checkered tiled black and white floors. Neon colored lights are in the form of signs, a single botched mangled sign kept together by plates of metal and plywood. Trudy stepped out of her car, the ambiance of chirping crickets had become more apparent compared to when she was at the supermarket. An incessant buzzing was heard from the neon sign accommodated onto the building. Trudy tapped on the glass of the doors, catching the attention of the janitor. The janitor, a young, pimple ridden teenager, wearing a pear of crummy black pants and an equally crummy stained brown shirt tucked into the pants. 
‚ÄúWhat are you doing here, Tony had specifically instructed me to not let any unsupervised customers in his store.‚Äù said the Janitor.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm only here to drop off a bouquet for Tony. Do you know if he‚Äôs here?‚Äù Trudy asked.
Why would he be here, It‚Äôs after hours, knowing him he‚Äôs probably stuffed in his shack he calls a home. Does it say who it‚Äôs from?‚Äù
‚ÄúHmh, I prefer not to say.‚Äù
‚ÄúDamn Tony, always sending himself flowers pretending they were sent by my mom, he‚Äôs really weird.‚Äù
‚ÄúDo I want to know?‚Äù
‚ÄúProbably not, you can call him now, I‚Äôm not paid enough to care.‚Äù
	Being gifted entry Trudy heads towards the phone, laid dormant on the receptionist desk is a phone with messy flames painted on, next to it, a pamphlet sized phone book with the Italian flag cropped into the background. Going alphabetically Trudy Finally reached Tony‚Äôs number.
	‚ÄúHello sexy, finally broke up with your boyfriend, told you your womanly instinct would drive you to me, meet me behind the ice chest tomorrow.‚Äù A confident Tony on the other end doing god knows what.
‚Äú...Trudy speaking.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, Trudy, sorry; thought you were a fifteen year old, what do you need?‚Äù
‚ÄúSorry to interrupt whatever you were doing, I have a delivery for you. I didn‚Äôt know where you lived, so I'm here at your dealership. Anyways can you tell me where you live or just pick it up over here.‚Äù
‚ÄúDamn it Francis! Don‚Äôt let anybody but disclosed personnel in here after hours!‚Äù Tony‚Äôs shouting at Francis might as well be nonexistent as his words hadn‚Äôt fazed Francis.
‚ÄúThis will be a cut in your paycheck Francis! Anyways, you said delivery for me.‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, a bouquet of flowers from a secret admirer.‚Äù
	‚ÄúI knew she‚Äôd come around one day or another, you hear that Francis.‚Äù Francis only rolled his eyes.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave these here for you tomorrow.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat, c‚Äômon Trudy, why not come over?‚Äù
‚ÄúI would really not want to, I have to go feed Tucker.‚Äù
‚ÄúTrudy! Don‚Äôt Hang U-‚Äù Before Tony could get his last word out, Francis had disconnected the phone.
‚ÄúYou probably want to get out.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, I have to feed Tucker, he must be so hungry right now.‚Äù Trudy then stormed out of the store, leaving Francis alone in the mixed colored lights.
Driving home Trudy again repeated what she thought before coming to Tony‚Äôs; She‚Äôs just Trudy, a trad wife coming home to feed her husband supper. Guiding the car up to the driveway; getting out of the car; walking on the pavement brick that led up to the porch; rushing to the door, and before inserting the key into the keyhole, Trudy heard an older woman call out to her.
‚ÄúTrudy! Trudy over here!‚Äù said the older woman. 
Every second Trudy is stripped away from finishing her night, made it less believable to assume her husband was alive and just hungry, flickering her eye lids in annoyance and letting go of the door handle, she gave the nicest ‚Äòyes‚Äô she could.
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Trudy replied, Trudy turned around to see elementary school teacher Kelsey, ‚ÄúHey Kelsey, why are you up so late?‚Äù
‚ÄúI could ask the same about you,‚Äù Kelsey rushed from the opposite side of the street and onto Trudy‚Äôs lawn. ‚Äú say have you and Tucker decided if you wanted to take your kiddo to school or not?‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know, not my top priority right now, I have to feed Tucker.‚Äù
‚ÄúTrudy, you can go a minute without thinking of Tucker, You can think for yourself.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm thinking. I‚Äôm thinking you should leave me alone right now, I have to feed my‚Ä¶,‚Äù Trudy inhales, taking a minute to calm herself down, again rubbing her finger against the rubber of her purse,‚Äù My husband, I have to feed my husband. This can be a problem tomorrow, okay Kelsey.‚Äù
Kelsey inched her way to the porch where Trudy stood, maneuvering her way past the bed of flowers planted in Trudy‚Äôs yard, and past Tucker‚Äôs car onto the pavement brick that led up to the porch.
‚ÄúI know, think about it, your kid can build connections and confidence, I‚Äôll give you time of course. There are just advantages of going to school.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere are also disadvantages of going to school, look at Francis, I don‚Äôt want to give my kid a lobotomy to make sure they aren‚Äôt tempted to jump.‚Äù Trudy inserts her key into the keyhole, preparing herself for a reaction.
‚ÄúI know, I just; want you to give it thought.‚Äù
Trudy stands silent in the doorway before inhaling again.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll sit down and talk to you about this tomorrow if it makes you feel better,‚Äù Trudy turned to Kelsey, Trudy tried to conjure up the best smile she could muster. It had seemed to fool Kelsey, although fidgeting with her hands, she looked up towards Trudy with a pleased smile on her face, ‚Äúnow, I have to feed Tucker, If I don‚Äôt hurry dinner might be burnt, I still need to cook the peas, peas and potatoes Kelsey!‚Äù
‚ÄúWill you actually sit down with me Trudy?‚Äù
‚ÄúIf I give you $20, will you leave me alone?‚Äù
‚ÄúDeal!‚Äù
Trudy digs through her purse looking for her check book, writing a twenty on it, she hands the check to Kelsey. Kelsey then smells the paper. Trudy steps back in surprise, cocking her head to the right. 
‚ÄúNothing beats the smell of fresh paper.‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, fresh. Take good care of yourself now.‚Äù

1ktaxa4,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizoaffective/comments/1ktaxa4/my_psychologist_is_shady/,My psychologist is shady,"Am I being an ass because I'm about to fire up my ex psychologist for statements and inconsistencies in my medical records that I'm just now finding and I expect her to go back and correct or I'm going to file some kind of former complaint against her.
I am a schizophrenic, elder woman who was seeking treatment for severe anxiety, depression, insomnia, occasional substance use and every day life affecting stress. I trusted that I could go into this doctor and tell the truth to get the help I need because the stress has been affecting my life so adversely.
First, she said that on the second and last visit I had with her that I didn't comply with a drug screening in her office which isn't true
 Her nurse asked me if I could pee and I said no I just got up and I'd just peed right before I came and hadn't had anything else to drink to pee again. That is a whole different connotation to say I'm not complying and the btch of it is that I had admitted that it had been over 2 weeks since id used but that id done it that day before. She made it sound like I was trying to avoid peeing so she cancelled my antipsychotics and said she told me that I couldn't have them until I had 6 months of clean screens and treatment with her. AS IF, id fking go back to anyone that took the very meds that keep me sane. That's almost criminal to cancel a schizophrenics medicines and leave them prone to delusions when you know they are coming to you in a crisis. WHO DOES THAT? AND I ended up cancelling later on after the 2nd visit w her so I could do telehealth appts dues to transportation issues getting there and due to social anxiety about coming out into public im struggling so hard with.
I had about a dozen errors in there where she states that she told me things and gave me ultimatums and that I agreed but none of this happened AT ALL. Also she said I admitted to drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes and I've never done either of those in my life but she said she warned me against the effects of tobacco and she didn't do that either. Jeesh!! How can she do that and add all that in after the fact.
If she was going to cancel my meds for substance use why didn't she do it right then? She just said one sentence. "" You need to get some help because it can affect your meds"". That was as much discuss as we had. You know I went there and admitted I have issues and I knew if I admitted I did something occasionally they were going to weigh if I have really got schizophrenia and that I did drugs and they caused the delusions or if I really even have a mental disorder. I expected that but I didn't expect her to impose militant or probative restrictions on me, and at that shouldn't I have been given a chance to stop by the next screening that should have been made clear that was obviously some sort of mandatory requirement for treatment. Man, there's too much gray area and now I'm stressed out and pissed off and I just wrote a letter to tell her I'm giving a copy to my regular PCP to add to my files if she don't go back and correct her lying ass statements. I'm not sure if she's mad that I cancelled her but I just wrote and told her I had to choose a different provider in my network and I didn't state why but I think she wrote all that in there after I cancelled her. The good thing is, it also says I agreed to something called ambient listening which I don't at all remember her talking about, which in lamens terms says she was recording the session. WELL GOOD, cause now there's a record of her shady ass ways. I told her that if she don't make the necessary changes I'd seek help from my PCP on the next appropriate steps and that she had affected the way I think about seeking help in healthcare from now on but that it's a learning experience I'll keep in mind forever.

1ktau7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/LMU/comments/1ktau7d/what_every_animation_student_should_know_10_tips/,What every animation student should know -- 10 tips from a recent graduate,"This goes out to any current animation majors at LMU. There's a lot of things about the animation industry that LMU will not be transparent with you about, usually because it's against the interests of the school, or because the people in the program have an outdated perspective on the industry. These are things you should know if you want to be prepared.



**#1 - Your work is not good enough.**

The vast, vast majority of animation students do not graduate with work that is professional quality. LMU professors are extremely nice, and they will not tell you this -- but the truth of the matter is that, usually, your work is not at the level it needs to be to get hired. People at this school routinely struggle with anatomy and perspective. This is an extremely competitive industry, especially right now -- you are going to be competing with talented artists with multiple years of experience under their belt for the same jobs. You *need* to take classes outside of LMU or study your craft independently. Your work will not be good enough if you do not dedicate hours into getting better. Networking is important, but people will not hire you if your skill is not up to par. Everyone has work to do. Be honest about where your skill is at -- compare yourself with successful artists and look for the areas you need to improve on. Practice doesn't make perfect, *targeted* practice makes perfect.

  
**#2 - You need to interact with artists outside of LMU.**

Most LMU animation students interact primarily with other LMU animation students. You need to be networking and befriending animation students at *other universities*. Go to the CalArts open show, the ArtCenter grad show, meet USC animation students and UCLA animation students. These people have the potential to be your *future coworkers*, people who could be *recommending you for opportunities!* But right now, literally nobody knows who you are! You are *sabotaging yourself* networking-wise if you only interact with the extremely small, extremely insular bubble of LMU. People go to CalArts for the network -- so tap into that network.

  
**#3 - You should be posting your art online.**

You are shooting yourself in the foot if you are not posting your work online. Recruiters routinely say that they find people through Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. How are these people supposed to find you if you never share your art on public platforms? So, so many people get hired from social media sourcing, not job applications. Companies like Cartoon Network and Pixar are almost never posting open roles online, because they're usually hiring internally or from their network. How do you get into that network? Post your work online!

Use social media to meet artists -- meet other animation students, working industry professionals, etc. Comment on people's work, DM artists you love -- just interact with the broader animation community. Make yourself a recognizable person. People are going to be a lot more comfortable hiring someone they feel familiar with than a total stranger.

  
**#4 - Don't market yourself as a generalist.**

This is not an industry of generalists -- jack of all trades is a master of none. Pick a discipline (character design, storyboarding, background design, 3d modeling, etc) and become a MASTER at it. Put all of your energy into that thing. Even more importantly, market yourself clearly and specifically: ""I'm John Doe and I do action storyboarding for TV"". ""I'm Jane Doe and I'm a character designer for adult primetime animation"". ""I'm Jerry Joe and I want to be a 3D modeler for games"". When you're open to any and all roles, you're a weaker candidate that someone who LOVES and DEVOTES THEMSELVES to one thing. Recruiters have to look through thousands and thousands of applications for a single position. You should be telling companies exactly who you are and what you want to do. Make recruiters easily understand what your deal is. People can't recommend you for roles if they don't know what your ""deal"" is.



**#5 - Portfolio is everything.**

Your portfolio is what is going to get you hired. Most portfolios, right out of graduation, are not hirable. Don't confuse recruiters by having a million categories (storyboarding, character design, 2d animation, 3d animation, etc, etc etc). Have your main discipline, ideally everything on one page (whether that be your 3 boarding samples, your 10-20 design pieces, your demo reel, etc). Have your email and resume easily accessible. Update your portfolio frequently. Cut your old work out when you make better, new work. Only put your best stuff, and never put anything that you aren't proud of.

Your portfolio is going to tell a story about who you are -- is your work geared towards 3d or 2d, feature or TV? Be clear about what kind of work you make. Make sure your work fits into a certain niche. What company would hire you? What show would you be perfect for? (""I'm John Doe and my action storyboards would be perfect for Invincible, Castlevania, or Vox Machina! I could work somewhere like Powerhouse or Titmouse!"") Make sure you have answers to these questions, and make sure your portfolio reflects those answers. Base your portfolio off of successful artists that work at the companies you want to work for. Copy how they format things, what they include, etc. Be smart, and take note of what these successful portfolios all have in common. Don't base your portfolio off your classmates' portfolios, or your resume off of your classmates' resumes. Always base things off of successful artists that you want to emulate.

  
**#6 - Your film is not important for your career.**

Your short film is not going to help your career. This isn't CalArts -- there's no Producer's Show where Disney is coming to watch your film. Unless your film is going to Sundance or going viral, recruiters do not care. We no longer live in the world where companies hire a fresh grads to turn their films into TV shows. Focus on your actual discipline, and, ideally, gear your film towards that. If you want to work in the design department, use your film as an opportunity to do design -- and put those character turns, prop turns, and designs in your portfolio.

  
**#7 - If you want an internship, you need to have an actual strategy.**

Thousands, and I really do mean thousands, of animation students apply for internships. Big companies (DreamWorks, Disney, etc) are going to tell you that these are entry-level positions, but, especially for non-art roles like production or development (that rely on resume + cover letters) ... *they aren't.* I was interviewed by Nickelodeon for a development internship, and every candidate, including me, had had a prior development internship. The guy that ended up getting the role had *SIX* prior internships -- the most out of any of us! The truth of the matter is that, if you want to set yourself up for success, you need to get a production or development internship at a small, dime-a-dozen, live-action studio -- and after that's on your resume, you can apply for bigger and bigger companies. Start EARLY. Apply your sophomore year. Get your resume and cover letter reviewed by smart, smart people like Sam Goff who know what a good resume/cover letter looks like. Lots of your resumes are... bad (sorry!). Make sure your formatting is clear. Don't put your highschool on there, use specific bullet points with strong action verbs, and quantify your achievements with numbers and metrics. 

For art roles -- portfolio trumps everything. Put everything you have into that. It's incredible competitive, but if you are willing to put in the work and market yourself smartly, you can succeed.

  
**#8 - Be a critical person.**

LMU generally does a poor job of giving proper critique. Everyone is very nice, and while that's sweet, it ultimately fails at helping students improve, and leads to crushing disappointment once students leave the LMU bubble. Accept and confront your weaknesses, and practice not getting defensive when receiving critique. Be open to receiving help, figuring out what areas you need to improve in, and get to know the people in your life that are better at are than you -- they will be your tools to improving in your craft. Nitpick your work! Aim for great, not just ""good enough"".

Everyone at LMU has some work to do in terms of technical skill. Be honest with where your skill is at -- it's the first step in figuring out a plan of action on how to improve. Read books on anatomy, perspective, color, boarding, composition, etc. Get critique from smart artists that know their stuff! Never be satisfied with your work -- you should always have an idea of the areas that you can improve on. 

  
**#9 - Build a good reputation and be on your best behavior in a team.**

You're going to work collaboratively with people at LMU. Nobody wants to work with the people that procrastinate on their work, turn in shoddy work, are bad communicators, can't follow directions, set unrealistic expectations, overpromise outcomes, never finish their stuff, or are straight up unpleasant. Your fellow students are your future network -- *and people are going to remember if you were a good worker or not*. People are not going to recommend you for industry roles if working with you was a bad experience. Networking relies on the recommender WANTING to work with you. Don't shoot yourself in the foot by being unpleasant in teams and building up a bad rep.

Any time you are on a team, you need to be on your best behavior. Be collaborative, be proactive, follow directions and do your best. People will remember how helpful you were, or how amazing your work was. Be smart!

  
**#10 - Do what you love, and put in the work for it.**

Every role in this industry is competitive -- so you might as well do what you love. Your love for your craft will shine through the work that you make. Frankly, being a production assistant isn't any more or less competitive than art roles these days, so just work towards what you actually want to do. Set up coffee chats with people who have your dream job. When you have fun making art, you make more of it, and you make it more often -- and so you get BETTER, FASTER! You **NEED** to love making art. If you don't love what you do, and feel devoted to it, you will burn out and you will fail. The people who succeed in this industry are the people who make art consistently, all the time, because they LOVE it and they LOVE getting better. Foster your love for art. Try new things, don't stagnate, experiment and branch out and explore what you like. It takes a lot of work to make it in animation, but if you love what you do and are willing to work for it (consistently, with precision and intelligence and a grounded understanding) you will succeed.

Or Was It? üöÜ,"Okay, picture this: it's a regular Tuesday morning, and I'm on my usual train headed to work, caught in that half-asleep, half-daydreaming mode. My hair was totally not cooperating, and my coffee cup was literally the only thing keeping me functional. üòÇ

So I'm standing there, and this guy, who had this slightly scruffy, just-out-of-bed look, but in a cute way, winks at me. He was clearly eyeing the sea of commuters while adjusting his earbuds like he was preparing for battle.

I couldn't help but chuckle at his animated expressions, especially when the train jolted and he just about hugged the pole! We ended up sharing a 'glad I'm not the only one' grin.

""Well, I've had smoother mornings,"" he said, a little sheepishly, clearly referring to the pole incident. 

""Hey, at least you made it look somewhat graceful,"" I teased.

He broke into a smile that was a ray of sunshine in the twilight-zone of morning routines. ""And here I was thinking today was just another disaster in motion.""

""Nope, definitely a contender for entertaining commute awards,"" I replied, adding a dramatic mock-clap for emphasis.

We spent the rest of the ride exchanging light banter about the mysteries of those impossible overhead strapholds and how it feels like train designers had octopuses in mind, not humans. When my stop came, we both did that slightly awkward 'it was nice to meet you, stranger' nod, with no promises but a mutual 'this was fun' vibe.

I‚Äôm 31, single, and work remote/travel for work. I only usually average 1 team meeting a week, and do all my work through emails & pings. To be honest, I only really work 30 minutes - 1 hr each day. 

My ‚Äúoutside‚Äù routine includes:
- daily walks in my neighborhood mid-day and evening
- gym 4x a week 
- visits to coffee shops 
- seeing a friend or two over chess or coffee
- wellness appts 
- thrift shops, community markets, grocery stores 
- travel once a month 

I‚Äôm a friendly and warm person, and not shy at all. I used to be extremely social, where I‚Äôd hang out with a different friend every day, go to art/music events, chess club, host my own gatherings, go on dates every week. But it left me exhausted with how much effort and care I‚Äôd put into others without reciprocation. So I stopped initiating plans, going to events that made me shallow friends, and dating. 

Now in my day to day, sometimes the most I‚Äôll say out loud is ‚Äúhi‚Äù to the gym clerk, or my coffee order to the barista, or functional conversations when I go to my chiropractor/ masseuse/nail tech.

The thing is, I don‚Äôt mind it. My life has been so much more peaceful without feeling like I need to manage other people‚Äôs drama/problems, or being anxious about a love interest. I feel more insulated than I feel isolated. 

I‚Äôm very much alone the majority of my time, but it‚Äôs not lonely. I do want a partner one day, but the costs/risks of dating outweigh the benefits for me right now. I‚Äôm not sure if I need to change or if it‚Äôs just this season that I need this. 

I‚Äôm curious about if any others live similarly ‚Äî insulated, solo, and on your own a lot. If so, how do you feel about it? Do you love it or resent it?
