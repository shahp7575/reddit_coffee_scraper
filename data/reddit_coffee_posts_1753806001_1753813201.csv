1mcj3ku,https://www.reddit.com/r/PanicAttack/comments/1mcj3ku/living_with_fear_after_a_sudden_panic_attack_need/,Living with fear after a sudden panic attack ‚Äî need advice,"I‚Äôm a young man in my twenties. Not long ago, I went through a shocking and unexpected experience:
I had two cups of coffee and an energy drink, and suddenly my heart rate spiked to 145 bpm. I felt shortness of breath, dizziness, a choking sensation, and an intense fear of dying.
I was rushed to the ER. They did an ECG and bloodwork and told me everything was fine physically.
But from that moment on, I haven‚Äôt felt like myself.
I no longer experience full-blown panic attacks like on the first day, but now I live with constant pressure in my chest, emotional numbness, and fatigue.
It feels like I‚Äôm stuck in the ‚Äúpost-crisis‚Äù phase  afraid of having another episode, feeling lost, and disconnected from myself.
I‚Äôve seen multiple doctors and they all said I‚Äôm physically healthy‚Ä¶ but inside, I feel like I‚Äôm just existing in a body without truly living.
I‚Äôm trying my best to stay strong, but I‚Äôm tired.
I just want to feel normal again. I want to wake up one day and not have to fight this invisible battle.
If anyone has been through something similar and made it out   please share how you did it.
Right now, I‚Äôm just looking for hope... for any light to guide me out of this.

I've tried reading romance, fantasy, horror, etc. many times, but... it just doesn't bring me any pleasure. I tried young adult books, classics from Tolkien books to Odyssey. Dune, No Longer Human, Before the Coffee Gets Cold, Twilight and 50 Shades of Grey, comics, manga etc etc... And nothing. After a few pages I lose interest and my thoughts start to wander.  I think with books I just need to know something is true to feel interested in any way. 

  
That said, my husband  finished his first book and he managed to find a publisher for it. He wrote it in German (our language), about two men who travel through time. One tries to prevent a crime, the other tries to stop the first one. I actually  like the idea and when my husband was writing the book we brainstormed together many times and I was happy to help him, etc., but... now that it's finished I can't get through it. 



I've tried about 10 times now and each time I manage to get to chapter 5 at most. I just don't feel interested. Once, I literally stopped reading because something important was happening, but then suddenly there was a mention of food and I started wondering if we should actually go shopping. Another time, a character description popped up and I just thought, ""Yeah,  I should probably go to the hairdresser too,"" and then I spent three hours browsing through different hairstyles and completely forgot about the book. 

  
The book will be published in November and my husband expects me to  read it by then.  He doesn't really understand how I can read something every day but still not be able to get through his book. I've tried explaining this to him several times, but I feel like our discussions have finally become passive-aggressive, and now he thinks I think his book is bad.

1mcj25y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/1mcj25y/this_is_not_polyamory/,This is not Polyamory,"I wanted to share something I‚Äôve been reflecting on lately.

My friend Kavya is genuinely one of the happiest people I know. She seems to have it all figured out.

Look at her with Rohan.
They have such great chemistry, they‚Äôre in love, they‚Äôre always laughing together, and they just get each other.
The thing with Rohan, though, is that he‚Äôs not really the serious type.

But here‚Äôs the thing‚ÄîKavya doesn‚Äôt expect him to be.
Whenever she wants to have a deep or philosophical conversation, she goes to Aditya instead.

Aditya is incredibly smart, loves his filter coffee, loves talking, and loves debating.
And their conversations? They‚Äôre on another level‚Äîdeep, engaging, and meaningful.
The thing with Aditya, though, is that he‚Äôs not the adventurous kind.

And that‚Äôs not a problem either, because when Kavya wants to go hiking, she calls Anjali.
Anjali and her dog join her, and they head out to the mountains for the whole day.
The fun they have is unmatched.

You know what Kavya‚Äôs secret to happiness is?
She never expects anything from a chicken other than eggs.
She never asks an apple tree for anything other than apples and shade.
She only expects milk from a cow and love from a dog.

And because of that, her friends love being around her. They always want to give her what she asks for, because she only asks for what they can truly give.

Now compare this to my other friend, Meera.
Poor Meera‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs miserable.

The only person she has in her life is her boyfriend.
And her boyfriend? He adores her and would give her the world if he could. But he‚Äôs not a Swiss army knife, and he‚Äôs definitely not a genie.

Yet Meera wants him to be everything‚Äîher personal ATM, her therapist who listens patiently, her passionate romantic, her plus-one to every social event, her protector and someone ultra-sensitive.

She wants to get everything she needs from just one person.
But no one person can give you everything you need.

Some people are generous with money but stingy with their time.
Some will give you their whole afternoon but can‚Äôt keep a secret.
Some are always late but have infinite patience.

You‚Äôll save yourself so much frustration‚Äîand be so much happier‚Äîwhen, like Kavya, you learn to ask people only for what they can actually give, and stop expecting what they simply can‚Äôt.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **ATP Toronto Masters: Tallon Griekspoor vs. Tomas Martin Etcheverry ‚Äì A Matchup of Hard-Court Hopes and Argentine Heartburn**

**Parsing the Odds: The Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie (Mostly)**  
Let‚Äôs cut to the chase: Tallon Griekspoor is the favorite here, and not by a slim margin. The bookmakers are all over him like a hawk on a slow mouse, with decimal odds hovering around **1.45** (implying a **69% implied probability** of victory). For context, that‚Äôs more confidence than you‚Äôd have betting on your uncle to finally clean his garage by next summer. On the flip side, Tomas Martin Etcheverry sits at **2.8 odds** (a **35.7% implied probability**), which is about the same chance of winning a bet that your local coffee shop will run out of oat milk on a Monday morning.

The spread? Griekspoor is -3.0 games, meaning bookmakers expect him to win by a comfortable margin. If you‚Äôre into totals, the over/under is set at **22.5 games**, with the Over priced slightly lower than the Under. But let‚Äôs be real‚Äîthis match isn‚Äôt about totals; it‚Äôs about whether Etcheverry can avoid becoming the first Argentinean snowman to melt on a Canadian hard court.

**Digesting the News: Etcheverry‚Äôs Hard Court ‚ÄúReunion‚Äù**  
Etcheverry, darling of the clay courts, has not played on hard courts in **months**. To put that in perspective, it‚Äôs like asking a penguin to suddenly master a trapeze. The Argentine has advanced to the second round in Toronto, but his last hard-court match feels as distant as a winter holiday in July. Meanwhile, Griekspoor? The Dutchman is a hard-court machine, thriving on surfaces that don‚Äôt try to trip him up. His recent form against Pospisil (a win, no less) suggests he‚Äôs sharpened his game like a chef prepping for a Michelin inspection.

The broader news isn‚Äôt kind to Argentina‚Äôs tennis squad. Four Argentine players are in action, but their collective odds of a good day here are about as high

I‚Äôm a red team engineer with custom firmware on my router and a Faraday cage around my smart toaster.","I showed up 10 minutes early, hoodie on, laptop in hand, booted into a hardened gentoo distro I compiled myself. She opened the door holding a MacBook Air. Chrome had 43 tabs open. I almost left right then.

I asked for her network topology diagram. She laughed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just the router from the ISP.‚Äù  
Alright, I thought. Let her have it.

I popped open her router admin panel. Default password:¬†*admin123*. The SSID was ""PrettyFlyForAWiFi"". I ran a¬†`nmap`scan. 12 exposed ports, 3 outdated IoT devices, and a printer running telnet. No firewall. No VLANs. Just raw digital nudity.

I asked if she ever noticed weird lag. She said ‚Äúyeah sometimes Netflix buffers.‚Äù I said that was probably because her TV was being used in a botnet out of Kazakhstan. She blinked twice. ""Oh no, is that bad?""

I offered to segment the network and install pfSense. She said she ‚Äújust wanted Spotify to stop cutting out.‚Äù

I airgapped her Sonos out of pity.

After 20 minutes of work, I asked for her phone to remove TikTok and clean the app permissions. She said ‚Äúbut I need it for filters.‚Äù  
I looked into the distance. Deep sigh. I looked out the window and whispered, *""The panopticon isn‚Äôt metaphorical.""*  
She asked if I was always this intense.  
I said no, only when the NSA is listening. Which is always.

She offered coffee. I declined, caffeine raises your attack surface.

When I left, she said, ‚ÄúThanks, you‚Äôre like, really good with computers.‚Äù

I walked away slow. Her router was still on UPnP. So was my heart.  
You can't patch people. Believe me, I tried.

I woke up before him, had my breakfast, skipped coffee, of course. He got up, took a 30 min poo, took a 20 min shower, shaved, sat in his towel in the office scrolling Twitter, and by this point it was 11AM. I really needed my coffee. I went ahead and did the cleaning up so once he was done doing his thing, we could go get our drinks. 

It‚Äôs 12pm. We finally leave to get coffee. On the way, he mentions he hasn‚Äôt eaten breakfast yet. I mention the place next door has $5 for a breakfast sandwich + coffee combo. He says that‚Äôs an outrageous price. OK. So we go to the new coffee place as planned. We get there and the coffees are around $3.50 a pop. He says no way we‚Äôre not spending that much on stupid coffee. So I say OK let‚Äôs go have coffee at home then. He‚Äôs literally stewing pissed off on the drive. I remind him that he can get a coffee + sandwich at the other place for $5. But he snaps back let‚Äôs just go home. OK. I offer to make breakfast and coffee when we get in. He says no thanks. 

We get in and he goes straight to his office. I ask what now? And he says nothing. I ask if we‚Äôre still going to hang out, and he says no. 

Our plans with friends are at 2pm. We need to leave at 1:20pm. It‚Äôs 1pm and I ask if he‚Äôs eaten yet. He says no. I say he needs to since we have to leave soon. He says OK. It‚Äôs 1:15pm and he‚Äôs started making himself a full meal. Not a quick microwave leftovers. A soup with a sandwich. 

I remind him we need to leave shortly and he says we can get there on time if we leave at 1:30 it‚Äôs fine. But I mention that one of the roads closed so that‚Äôs gonna cause a delay. He throws away his food and says OK fine let‚Äôs leave now then. 

What he‚Äôs failing to understand is that I‚Äôm really disappointed our bit of free time to chill this morning got totally hijacked. I just wanted a nice morning with coffee and our TV show but he had to go sulk in his office because stuff costs money. 

It‚Äôs exhausting.

Please share yours below and let's all laugh at our various misfortunes together! ;P I'll go first: 

So, I have food poisoning rn. Obviously a fun time. /s 
Thankfully it's not too bad though, so I was at least looking forward to transcribing my notes from my recent holiday into my Techo as a good use of the sick day. Chill and wait it out near a bathroom and all that. 

Now, I *know* that my autism sometimes gives me extra-special √ºber-weird sensory issues when I'm sick. *Especially* when I have nausea. I've dealt with it before. 

You know what I absolutely didn't expect regardless? 

Looking at the grid paper in my Hobonichi gave me vertigo and nausea so bad I **fell off my sofa** and landed flat on my face. 

...

That's it, that's the story. 

""Today I didn't fill out my Techo because looking at the grid paper made the room spin."" 

I can't even be mad at my brain/autism for this one, it's just too stupid. 

I actually had to stop typing this out for a minute because it made me laugh all over again. This sounds so much like a made-up excuse for not doing your math homework! 

""Sorry, teach, I was too sick to look at grid paper yesterday!"" 

I simply cannot. 

(On the bright side I neither brained myself on the coffee table nor actually threw up onto my planner or laptop. So I guess that's a win! :S)

1mcixh0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mcixh0,I Still Can't Forget Her...,"It's been a long time since I posted on this sub, I remember back then what the community looks like with just a few thousand subscribers. But enough with the nostalgia trip. I wanted to express out my feelings with someone whom my memory cannot forget:

So while I was in the library doing research work, I wanted to find a plug outlet for my laptop as its battery was running out. Luckily for me, I managed to find one beside where I was sitting and someone was using it. I asked if I could share with her and said she was fine with it.  But I soon noticed that her laptop was in Japanese so I immediately talked to her in Japanese as well. We got to know each other and turns out, she was a visiting researcher from Japan. I told her about what I'm doing and she was really fascinated that I'm doing research on Japanese history as that's my major in grad school right now. As soon as my classes started, I immediately got her socials. But it was mostly an academic networking thing as I didn't develop any feelings for her at the time. 

But as time goes by, I always encounter her again and again whenever I visit the library. Whenever that happens, I always politely ask if I could sit with her and do my research beside her as we were so busy with what we're doing, which she always agrees. From time to time, we often chat together whenever we take a break. And it continued to be that way for weeks on end everytime when I was at the library, like there were times where she was the one who offers me to sit beside her without me asking. I soon developed a deep interest to her because of that, so I decided to ask her in Japanese if we could hangout sometime „Äå‰ªäÂ∫¶„ÄÅÈÅä„Å∞„Å™„ÅÑÔºü„Äç. She said yes so I immediately got her LINE number and we scheduled it in the day where we were available. 

We had dinner together at Pancake House and it was my treat. We talked about a lot of things like her life, her pets, her favorite anime, and I even discovered that she was half-Korean. We hangout in FullyBooked as she likes books as well, we had coffee at Coffee Bean I think it was and continued our conversation. But as soon as we get to the topic about her as a visiting researcher, she told me that she only got a couple of weeks left before she leaves the Philippines and may not be able to return again as she wants to conduct her research on Iceland. So that left me conflicted on whether to confess my feelings to her immediately before she leaves. For those who aren't familiar, there's a Japanese approach to dating called ""kokuhaku"" (ÂëäÁôΩ) or ""confession"" where you confess your feelings to someone directly and giving her a letter. Usually you only do ""kokuhaku"" when you already hangout at least three times or more. And since it was our first hangout, it would totally be unwise to confess immediately. But I was running out of time and I decided to confess the next day we meet again rather than facing regret for inaction once she leaves. So I wrote her a letter in Japanese, added a poem from the Man'y≈çsh≈´ at the end with a cursive French translation, and took a photo of it just in case.  I thought that my next meet with her will be my usual just like last time, but I soon realized that it'll be her last month as visiting researcher so there was no more time for her to go to the library again. She messaged me on LINE that she was available for a quick coffee break on particular days, but my schedule couldn't match with her for those days because of my work. So I had no choice but to wait it out until I could meet her at a perfect time. It was a busy day for the both of us but that was the only time I could meet her again. She messaged me to meet her at another location where she was attending an event. I met her outside and there I said to her these words:

Â•Ω„Åç„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ‰ªò„ÅçÂêà„Å£„Å¶‰∏ã„Åï„ÅÑ„ÄÇ

She didn't know how to react but she accepted my letter nonetheless. After the event, she read my letter and she told me that though she appreciated my ""kokuhaku"" and our friendship, she tells me that it won't work out because of our circumstances. Right off the bat, my predictions were correct that this will not work. Not only it will lead to LDR, but also the fact that timing of my ""kokuhaku"" was so early that even your average Japanese person will say that what I did wasn't recommended. But at least the silver lining I got in all of this is that at least I tried instead of facing the painful, long-time regret of not doing anything. I was completely devastated after that as it was one of the few times where I truly connected with someone organically. For some reason, this kind of rejection is more emotionally painful, especially if you've connected by chance and you've been with someone like her for a long time, with the same academic background, interests, hobbies etc. No amount of swipes on a dating app would replace that kind of connection. 

She left for Japan after that and I've tried my best to move on by keeping myself busy with personal matters. But there were times that the thought of her still lingers inside my head. I always keep saying to myself that ""I need to move on,"" ""there's no hope with her,"" and that ""there are still people out there"" numerous times, but there's always pieces of memories with her inside my head. I still can't forget her and even though the struggle is real, at least I'm trying my best to forget those moments.

Now I don't know what else to do. I'm nearing in my thirties and I'm worried that I may not be able to find someone like her again. People will give advice that ""go to so-and-so places or events to meet new people"" but there are so many factors at play that it's damn near impossible in this godforsaken country to go to such places in the first place. For one, the traffic is so unbearable that going to places like BGC, Makati, or anywhere else for the sake of meeting new people is not economical unless it's an important work-related event, and the mere fact that you're going there just to find ""the one"" is so stupid to begin with. And dating apps won't do any good as my past relationship with someone through a dating app didn't end well. But if there's no other choice, then desparation mode to use it I guess? Or wait it out again for that someone to come by chance just like with my Japanese friend? 

I wanted to vent this out because I have no other options left. I already talked this out with my close friends numerous times, I wrote this in my journal entry, I keep myself busy for days, weeks, and months on end as mentioned since people always say that ""time heals all wounds"", and I even tried chatting with AI acting as a therapist of sorts which wasn't even helpful in the first place, but still nothing's helping to make those moments with her disappear. Perhaps posting this here might help me find solace on what I feel right now because at least I could have a reality check with other fellow humans despite the notoriety of the platform.

Anyway I recently got entangled with a slightly older woman (35) who went all the way with me pretty early on, and I'll admit I wasn't in the best place mentally/financially/ or anything else really...but me being enigmatic/witty, respectful, and always looking to get laid, she saw something in me, or so I thought. We end up arguing over the next couple of weeks due to a mistrust issue and her temper that got us both saying some nasty things. We live pretty close and spent the 4th of July together and we went out on a couple of dates during all that, even though I invited her out constantly to simple things like the beach, getting a bite, a walk, coffee, park, anything. They all went pretty well, the best one was laying in the park one night on a blanket w/ nice lights nearby, junebugs everywhere, grass wasn't wet, not hot or too cold, perfect summer night weather, I've never experienced such bliss. I would find clever messages to send her throughout the day, then she said I was overbearing, didn't listen, and call/text too much (a few texts/ voicemails every few days, all went unanswered for the most part).¬† I mean she's busy but not that busy (work and some school). I still give her the benefit of the doubt and blame the whole thing on me :( I think I spooked her, even though I warned her about my relationship history.

¬†Anyway the whole thing felt extremely deep like part of a movie, I'm still in disbelief, although part of me hasn't given up hope. Looking back I think the whole thing may have been superficial and we were probably just lonely, because I'll admit I seem lonely and so does she, or she was completely wrong about me and got out (saw that I was trouble, complicated, etc.) even though initially upon meeting she was able to find out one thing I do in life (Doordash). She would say things like I'll meet the right person, we're not compatible, doesn't usually move this fast, doesn't want to waste my time, would only cont. if I wanted to date, to which I said of course. I haven't been in too many relationships (in fact I would say I have been in NO REAL RELATIONSHIPS) so we both agreed not to lead with love, I had to be careful not to fall in love with this girl, but I was only being persistent bc she left me hanging/ wouldn't give me a clear answer! I would say I couldn't just give up on her, a little more communication is all I asked for, willing to do anything! A week ago she said maybe we can work on things, then would block me, then would tell my parents that I'm harrassing her! It felt like constant mind games: Always in the wrong, highly critical of me, always trying to get me to understand something, calling me immature...everything felt like a test; like there were some magic words and she would ease up a bit. She said the reason for all this was because she cared about me (if she didn't she wouldn't have bothered telling me), and I think I believe her.

I could go on especially with some very important details but I'll save it since I don't really see these types of posts...I don't know how to move on :( because I've never been close to falling in love. I know I don't even deserve her in the slightest because I'm garbage, and I realize I have a lot to focus on and probably shouldn't be dating , but after being told some pretty hurtful things, agreeing to date (even after hooking up!!!) ignores all my texts and calls, only to say I'm harrassing and we're not compatible.

I'm new to this group but feel desperate to figure out what's going on. So in my twenties I was on low dose Adderall and thrived. A cup of coffee and 5-7 mg was great. I got the Masters and was thriving in my career. At 29. I had my son which was a traumatic delivery.  I wasn't able to go on medicine because I was highly sensitive to it after having him. Fast forward 6 and 1/2 years later I felt strong enough to have another kid. She's here and now for the last 6 months I've been in in an overthinking, overanalyzing, high anxiety state of hell. 

Doctors attempted to put me on ssris/SNRI that just made me feel VERY low for the first time. My counselor and my psychiatrist and my hormone specialists think I need to go on Vyvanse and possibly bypass the anti-anxiety depression medication

I'm afraid that my overthinking will just be exasperated, but they think it'll help me come out of my paralyzed state of decision paralysis and state of disbelief. I can't believe that someone can go from feeling confident and normal to feeling this shitty. 

I'm terrified to try another drug because my experience has been anything but enjoyable. It has caused me a lot more anxiety and stress. I'm overthinking my daughter's name. I'm overthinking if we should live where we live bc we're so far away from family. It's just a disaster. I'm typically the independent one in the family. However, the way I am now, I'm stressing my husband and parents out because I am am acting out of character. I've been completely transparent with them due to not wanting to hide what's going on but now I just feel like they don't know what to do. 

My next step is to try Vyvanse like three of my Physicians have told me to do but I'm terrified. Does anyone have positive stories to help me get out of my head. Will this ever get better!! Please tell me it will!! 

Thank you I'm advance for the positivity and encouraging thoughts!",1,1753812626.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

How many extra million does Tilray need each Quarter to become profitable? Will this new ideas get us out of the hole?

I think EU cannabis & add Wellness into German pharmacies, Health Food.

I think Non Alc Runners High, Hi\*Ball etc can be distributed to the same shops.

But Tilray really needs Infused Brews. I couldn't even find out how the growth has been so I assume it hasn't?

Get Infused into those bars, etc etc.

I had a feeling a certain topic would come up‚Äîspecifically, a girl I‚Äôve had a few brief, casual interactions with at the gym. One of them had apparently already been talking about it with the other before we met up.

As expected, it turned into one of them criticizing how I‚Äôve been handling the situation. He started saying I need to ‚Äúdo better‚Äù at talking to women, and made comments like, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre tall and Black‚Äîthat‚Äôs all you need to get girls.‚Äù He added that if he were me, he‚Äôd be having sex regularly (which isn‚Äôt even my goal), and said he didn‚Äôt understand what ‚Äúlong game‚Äù I was trying to play. Then it turned into him suggesting I go to church or coffee shops to meet women, calling me the weakest link in the friend group, and even saying he might just pull up to my gym to talk to the girl himself‚Äîwhile he has a girlfriend.

There were more comments like that, all wrapped up as ""advice,"" but they felt more insulting than helpful. I stayed quiet through most of it‚Äînot because I agreed, but because I didn‚Äôt want to feed into it or escalate things.

Now I‚Äôm left thinking:

Was staying quiet the right call?

After that, I had thanked him and me and my then fiancee helped him move into a new home, watch his newborn child, help his wife when she needed it, etc. (This is important to know before I into why I have to explain this at all)
Fast forward to yesterday 7/28/2025, Chancellor had messaged me later afternoon:
Chancellor:Are you free Thursday?
Me:Y
Chancellor:I might need your help with something
Me: With?
Chancellor: Nevermind
To put in some other context, Chancellor has a history of asking for favors and not telling people what it is before they answer ""Yes"". He wasn't going to tell me because he wanted the answer first.
He then came to the house, MIL and my husband were home now, and when I asked him what he needed help with. He responded with ""I got it figured out""
At the time, I thought it was okay and then that when everything was not okay. Chancellor had started talking to MIL:
Chancellor: I am going to have my friend come here (MIL) and watch [son's name] while I go to my interview.
This is when me and my husband chimed in and asked him why he was invited someone to a house that he doesn't live in without discussing it with the other people living here first.
Chancellor: That's why I am telling Mom now so I can put the plan in motion
Me:I am home that day, so why didn't you tell me that was your plan. I'm not comfortable with someone I don't know being here while I'm home alone.
Chancellor: He'll be here with my son
Me: That doesn't matter, I don't know this man. So I am not comfortable.
Chancellor: Look I set the expectation when I texted you and you didn't say yes or give me an answer.
Me: So I am not allowed to ask questions.
At this point, Chancellor kept going on about the expectations of his message to me and how ge jumps to help everyone but I couldnt help him this once because I have no respect for him (Translation: You didn't say yes to me and I'm mad that I couldn't trick you into saying the answer I want.)
He then brings up the tire situation and how he went out of his way to skip school and help me. (Even though he said it wasn't a problem)
I threw it back at him and said ""You told me that you didn't even want to go"". Then he replied ""Well, I would have gone anyways"".
The argument continued and my husband started tell Chancellor how it was odd that he was getting so mad at me for asking questions. MIL told Chancellor that the way he messaged me was not how he should talk to people and that my questions were valid. She then told him that he can't have his friend here and that it was not okay that he made this decision without even asking anyone first. He left as I was going to my room because I was about to have a meltdown from how emotional I was feeling. For history, I have Higher functioning Autism and am dealing with mental health issues. My have a past of abuse emotionally and physically. Chancellor is aware of this and still was willing to have a man that I don't know come in my home with me alone there. He used to live with us. During the time he was here, he made my living situation uncomfortable. During the argument he had mentioned that he and his wife and child would be moving back in soon because they can't find anywhere else to live. 
Today, he came while I was sleeping to pick up some stuff he left here, and then used my coffee maker to make some coffee. He has a history of using my stuff and leaving it a mess, I saw two kcups that he left on the counter and placed right where someone could see them. He left his cup on the counter and there was still some coffee in it. He had been gone for a while when I went out to the kitchen and the trash is two feet away for the coffee station. I know he did this on purpose because I've told him it bothers me.
After I cleaned my coffee maker. I left the kcups where they were and took the water tank out of the back of the coffee maker. I then walked away and emptied it. I hid it. At the time, my thought was ""He can come in here and be disrespectful and rude to me. Not apologize for his actions, then use my coffee maker and leave his mess? No, he never gets to use my stuff again."" He doesn't get to treat me like that for yesterday and all the times before and use my things whenever he wants.
My husband is mad at Chancellor for not apologizing and is pleased to know that he can't use our stuff. Not unless he apologizes or asks nicely.  Chancellor hasn't come back but I know the first thing he will do when he gets here is use the coffee maker. So, I ask AITA.",0,1753812343.0,AITAH,1,0.33,False

1mciqmk,https://i.redd.it/07m1rg65suff1.jpeg,I am making a game called CRUNCHED,"Oh hi there!  
I am a game artist with plenty of experience but a few gaps in game design and programming. I have decided to fill them and started with a pet project called Crunched, where you survive as a disposable employee of SolCrush Technologies.

This game is inspired by all the layoffs all across the tech industries in general and entertainment in particular. I have learned my lesson many years ago, so I am not affected, but I can feel the ripples all over my network. 

I get help from my friends who are fluent in technical side of game production, so I think the goal is very reachable. I will leave this overview in this community to get an additional kick in the butt not to forget about my promise and to deliver.

**Core Loop**

The entire game happens in front of the computer. The player doesn't run around and open cabinets.   
Messages spawn continuously across¬†three zones¬†(Tickets, Team, Mail).

Clicking a message increases its corresponding bar:

* Tickets = +1 Performance
* Team = +2 Team Work
* Mail = +3 Composure

Each click also¬†penalizes the other two bars¬†proportionally (e.g., clicking Mail = -1.5 Performance & Team).

**Metrics & Weights**

* Bars start at¬†45 (max 90)¬†and reset daily.
* Message spawn rates¬†increase each day¬†(Day 1: 1 per 5 sec ‚Üí Day 10: 1 per 0.8 sec).
* Weights and penalties¬†scale up daily, doubling by Day 10 to simulate crunch pressure.
* Endings are determined by the¬†percentage of weighted messages clicked¬†for each bar (‚â•50% = dominant stat ending).

**Dilemmas & Integrity**

Every day, you face 1 corporate dilemma framed as a ‚Äúteam judgment‚Äù.

Dilemmas are ranked by weight:

* Mundane (+1/0/-1 Integrity): ‚ÄúShould we report coffee coupon abuse?‚Äù
* Medium (+2/0/-2 Integrity): ‚ÄúShould we push Timothy to work overtime?‚Äù
* Heavy (+3/0/-3 Integrity): ‚ÄúShould we report a colleague hiding a health issue to HR?‚Äù

Integrity score tracks your ethical stance:

* Low Integrity = ruthless but secure job.
* High Integrity = moral but fragile career.

Integrity merges with core stats to determine endings, e.g.:

* ‚ÄúSuccess at a Cost‚Äù (high Performance + low Integrity).
* ‚ÄúIntegrity Over Career‚Äù (high Composure + high Integrity).

  
All this glory is sprinkled with rich lore, ridiculous company memos, CEO yachts, ""talent realignments"" and family issues. ",1,1753812290.0,IndieDev,0,1.0,False

I graduated with an accounting degree in 2023, but throughout university I was dealing with serious health issues that I didn‚Äôt properly address at the time. I tried to push through, but it affected my ability to perform ‚Äî and as a result, my GPA ended up being quite low. I barely made the minimum requirement to enroll in CPA PEP.

After graduating, I worked in the government sector as an Auditor, and earlier I also interned at a small accounting firm doing T2 returns and compilation files. That‚Äôs when I really realized how much I enjoy assurance and knew I wanted to build a long-term career in audit ‚Äî ideally with a Big 4 firm.

In 2024, my health issues worsened, and I had to leave my government audit role to return to my home country and focus on recovery. Fortunately, I‚Äôve now fully recovered and am back in Canada. I‚Äôm in a good place health-wise and more motivated than ever to pursue a career in assurance.

I enrolled in CPA PEP this past May (2025) and recently passed Core 1. I‚Äôve been actively trying to connect with professionals at Big 4 firms (audit staff, seniors, managers, HR recruiters) on LinkedIn ‚Äî sending over 25 personalized connection requests and coffee chat messages per week ‚Äî but so far, I‚Äôve had almost no luck getting responses.

**Here‚Äôs what I bring:**  
**-** Passed CPA PEP Core 1 (July 2025)  
\- Government audit experience  
\- Internship experience with T2s and compilation files  
\- Tons of extracurricular involvement even while dealing with health challenge  
**What I‚Äôm looking for advice on:**  
\- How can I stand out when my GPA doesn‚Äôt reflect my true potential?  
\- Is there a better approach to networking than just cold LinkedIn messages?  
\- Are there any events, volunteer opportunities, or entry points I should be targeting?  
\- Is it still realistic to aim for a Big 4 audit role even though I‚Äôm now in PEP and not a student?

When using 16,18,20 g I can brew 30-36g of coffee between 11-16 seconds, which I consider way too fast for an ideal extraction.

Adam seemed skeptical about Mark‚Äôs epiphany, given that she always had some spell over him. Adam asked him pointedly if it was really over. Mark resolutely insisted that it was finally over.

I nod and stand, reaching for my coat. I can feel her eyes on me as I turn to leave. That‚Äôs new, too. The way she watches me when she thinks I‚Äôm not looking.

At home, I open my laptop and pull up the article again‚ÄîVictim #3, blonde, early thirties, last seen at a gas station on the outskirts of town. There‚Äôs grainy security footage: a woman in a red hoodie stepping into a silver sedan. I‚Äôve looked at that video at least a dozen times, and I‚Äôm starting to believe I‚Äôve seen that hoodie before.

Nora has one just like it.

Of course, it could be coincidence. Lots of people have red hoodies. But Nora‚Äôs been acting‚Ä¶off. She disappears for hours without explanation. I‚Äôve seen her come home with dirt on her boots. One night, she left a duffel bag in the trunk of her car and snapped at me when I offered to carry it in.

She‚Äôs never snapped at me before.

The next time I‚Äôm over at her place, I ask to borrow her charger and pretend I forgot mine. She waves toward her bedroom. ‚ÄúShould be plugged in by the nightstand.‚Äù

I enter slowly, like the room might bite me.

I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm looking for. I open drawers without touching too much, check under the bed, behind the closet door. I don‚Äôt find anything‚Ä¶ until I reach the back of her closet.

There‚Äôs a plastic storage bin with a broken latch. I pry it open.

Inside: a folding knife, a stained rope, and something that makes my stomach drop‚Äîa set of driver‚Äôs licenses. Three different women. Three different faces. All now dead.

I nearly drop the lid as I close it.

When I return to the living room, Nora is watching me.

‚ÄúFind the charger?‚Äù she asks, her voice light, playful.

I nod. ‚ÄúYeah. Thanks.‚Äù

She smiles again‚Äîtoo wide this time‚Äîand I realize something else.

She knows I know.

And now I‚Äôm not sure which of us is going to make it through the week.",4,1753811986.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1mcil51,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1mcil51/delve_into_the_best_drip_coffee_maker_technivorm/,Delve Into the Best Drip Coffee Maker Technivorm Moccamaster Review,"The Technivorm Moccamaster 53933 has become a staple in my morning coffee routine. As someone who relies on that first cup to jumpstart the day, I was blown away by its quality and ease of use. The minimalist yet elegant design immediately caught my eye, and the off-white finish fits seamlessly into my kitchen. Measuring at 6.5 inches deep, 12.75 inches wide, and 14 inches tall, it doesn‚Äôt dominate the counter. It‚Äôs clear this coffee maker was built for both aesthetic appeal and functionality.  

**Ease of Use and Speed**  
Navigating the Moccamaster has been a breeze. Everything from the human interface buttons to the frustration-free packaging feels like it was designed with the user in mind. The brew process could not be simpler‚Äîjust flip a switch, and the magic begins. It takes only 4-6 minutes to generate a full pot of coffee, which for me is ideal when juggling my morning tasks. I also love the Brew-Volume Selector; whether I want a full carafe for entertaining guests or just half for myself, the process doesn‚Äôt falter.  

[Check Technivorm Moccamaster 53933 price on Amazon.](https://cyberlyber.com/p/b093dzt2rs/)

**Key Benefits**  
- Heats water to the precise extraction temperature without fail.  
- Brew-Volume Selector ensures flexibility for different coffee needs.  
- Automatic shut-off after 100 minutes gives peace of mind.  
- Handmade in the Netherlands, promising exceptional craftsmanship.  

**Quality of Brew**  
What sets the Moccamaster apart is the unparalleled richness of the coffee. Each cup is smooth, with none of that bitter aftertaste cheaper machines tend to produce. The paper filter enhances the clarity of the flavor, though I admit I had to stock up on them since they aren‚Äôt reusable. My family has commented on the noticeably better brew when they visit, which is always a good sign.  

**Silent Operation and Safety Features**  
The quiet nature of this machine is a pleasant surprise. As someone sensitive to loud appliances‚Äîespecially in the early hours‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt ask for a better start to my day. Plus, the auto-shutoff mechanism has saved me from the occasional ""Did I leave the coffee maker on?"" panic attack after I‚Äôm already halfway to work.  

**Weaknesses**  
- A pricier option compared to some competitors.  
- Requires paper filters, which may be inconvenient for some users.  
- Slightly bulky for smaller kitchens, despite its sleek design.

**Competing Brands**  
When comparing the Moccamaster to other drip coffee makers like the Breville Precision Brewer or the Oxo Brew 9-Cup Coffee Maker, it‚Äôs clear this one stands out in terms of simplicity and brewing consistency. The Breville offers more features but involves navigating through more complex settings. Oxo‚Äôs coffee quality is competitive, yet it lacks the Moccamaster‚Äôs durability and charm. If longevity and effortless coffee-making are priorities, this one outshines its competitors.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
This coffee maker lands on the higher end of the price spectrum, but the value it provides is undeniable. While you might find cheaper alternatives, very few can match the consistency, craft, and durability of this machine. Over time, the quality of the coffee it produces compensates for the upfront investment.

1mcijwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1mcijwd/aita_for_waiting_two_weeks_for_an_apology_then/,"AITA for waiting two weeks for an apology, then posting a story that upset people and not apologizing?","I had a close group of friends for 3‚Äì4 years. Some were childhood friends, kind people who never fought. About a year ago, I met a new guy (Jason) and introduced him to the group. At first, it was great, but Jason changed.

He became full of ego, acted like he could say or do whatever he wanted. He disrespected me, flirted with my girlfriend, made sexual comments about my childhood friend, and insulted my family and values.

Eventually, he crossed the line, so I stopped talking to him. I waited two weeks for an apology, but none came. Once, when Jason invited the group out, a friend told him, ‚ÄúYou should apologize first.‚Äù Jason replied, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather fuck you all on top of each other.‚Äù

Another friend (Ethan) was upset. Later, we played PlayStation at an internet cafe; Jason was there too. He used offensive ‚Äúyour mom/sister‚Äù insults, even after Ethan asked him to stop. Ethan lost it and walked out, about to call people to beat Jason up, but I calmed him down.

The group suggested talking it out. We did, with everyone there. Jason denied everything. Ethan called him out again, and they fought physically. We broke it up and left.

That night, I posted a meme on my story from a local comedian about a book titled ‚Äúhow to deal with motherfuckers,‚Äù something our group laughed at. Jason saw it and got mad. I got dozens of threats like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll break your jaw‚Äù and ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt walk around comfortably again.‚Äù

The group saw this but some didn‚Äôt distance themselves. That hurt, especially since Jason kept badmouthing me. Months later, I ran into him. He did nothing. Later, I found out he opened an office with an old friend... on my street?!

When I passed by, they shouted disgusting things like ‚ÄúHey, house is empty, come up so we can fuck you.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt respond to avoid looking bad. I told the group.

A few days later, I came home late and saw lights on in that office. The whole group was inside. These were people who never left my side, now hanging with the guy who threatened me.

They told me to apologize to Jason because he‚Äôd ‚Äúchanged‚Äù and things should soften. I refused but said they could talk and tell me. They went; I waited. Hours later, they texted, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just having coffee, chilling.‚Äù

I asked if they talked to him; they said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too sleepy.‚Äù But I saw them passing my house with Jason. They lied. It was one of the worst nights of my life. I cried, lost sleep, and no one reached out.

To avoid going insane, I packed and went to a beach 40km away for 2‚Äì3 days. Came back, started working on my career and academics to keep busy.

When I tried reconnecting, Jason claimed I called one of them a pimp; another said I insulted his girlfriend. Obvious lies, but they believed him and abandoned me.

That hurts the most. When I felt like shit, I turned to this group for support. Now they make me feel worse, and I have no one.

1mciil9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1mciil9/are_keurig_ksupreme_coffee_makers_worth_the_hype/,Are Keurig K-Supreme Coffee Makers Worth the Hype? Complete Review,"Writing a review like a real coffee enthusiast who has been using the Keurig 062151515291 daily felt like a natural fit. It‚Äôs the kind of coffee maker that quickly becomes part of your routine, whether you‚Äôre a casual coffee drinker or someone who takes their caffeination seriously.

**MultiStream Technology Makes a Difference**  
Brewing coffee with this machine genuinely surprised me. It features MultiStream Technology, which saturates the coffee grounds more evenly. At first, I was skeptical if it would make any noticeable improvement, but it delivers a richer and fuller flavor compared to my previous single-serve coffee maker. I'm the type who loves to savor every note my morning cup offers, and it genuinely felt like all the potential flavor was being extracted. This wasn‚Äôt your average single-serve coffee‚Äîit had depth.

**Customizability for Coffee Lovers**  
What caught my attention after a few uses was the level of customization it offers. The Strong button lets you brew with a more intense flavor, and I often toggle this depending on how much I need to power through my day. There's also the option to brew directly over ice, which became my go-to during summer afternoons. It tastes fantastic and doesn‚Äôt water down as quickly as I feared it might.

[Check Keurig 062151515291 price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b08vjl3hpc/)  

**Design That Fits Your Space**  
Living in a smaller apartment means countertop space is valuable real estate. This machine has a compact footprint, which I appreciated right away. The dual-position reservoir offers flexibility, allowing me to find the perfect spot for it on my kitchen counter without feeling cramped. Plus, the grey matte plastic exterior gives it a sleek and modern vibe that fits well with the rest of my appliances.

**Multiple Brew Sizes for Every Occasion**  
This machine‚Äôs ability to brew a variety of cup sizes‚Äî6, 8, 10, or 12 ounces‚Äîsets it apart. Whether I‚Äôm brewing a small, quick pick-me-up or filling a travel mug on a busy morning, it adjusts seamlessly. Everyone in the house has their preference, and it‚Äôs great not having to cater to only one fixed serving size. The reservoir holding 66 ounces also makes refilling less frequent, which, let‚Äôs face it, is a convenience you don‚Äôt fully appreciate until you actually live with it.

**Good Points**  
- MultiStream Technology extracts flavor thoroughly.  
- Strong button for extra bold coffee options.  
- Option to brew iced coffee without sacrificing taste.  

**Shortcomings**  
- It‚Äôs fully automatic, but you‚Äôll need to buy the reusable filter separately if you want to use your own coffee grounds.  
- The glossy buttons attract smudges and fingerprints, which can be annoying if you‚Äôre a clean freak like me.  

**Peer Products in Comparison**  
In comparison to other brands, this coffee maker holds its own. The Ninja CFP301, for example, excels with its dual functionality to brew carafes and single cups, but it‚Äôs bulkier and doesn‚Äôt extract flavor as evenly for single-cup servings. The Nespresso VertuoLine, on the other hand, offers a slightly more luxurious cup quality with its unique pods, yet the price point for pods makes it a less budget-friendly option. Keurig‚Äôs versatility in accepting both K-Cups and reusable filters truly distinguishes it, especially for someone trying to strike a balance between quality and convenience.

**Smart Spending**  
For those thinking about cost versus features, this coffee maker sits in the sweet spot. It offers functionality that rivals higher-end machines while maintaining a more approachable price point. The inclusion of flexible features like ice brewing and multiple brew sizes elevates its value considerably for office, home, or even dormitory settings.

I'm new to this group but feel desperate to figure out what's going on. So in my twenties I was on low dose Adderall and thrived. A cup of coffee and 5-7 mg was great. I got the Masters and was thriving in my career. At 29. I had my son which was a traumatic delivery.  I wasn't able to go on medicine because I was highly sensitive to it after having him. Fast forward 6 and 1/2 years later I felt strong enough to have another kid. She's here and now for the last 6 months I've been in in an overthinking, overanalyzing, high anxiety state of hell. 

Doctors attempted to put me on ssris/SNRI that just made me feel s***** for the first time. My counselor and my psychiatrist and my hormone specialists think I need to go on Vyvanse and possibly bypass the anti-anxiety depression medication

I'm afraid that my overthinking will just be exasperated, but they think it'll help me come out of my paralyzed state of decision paralysis and state of disbelief. I can't believe that someone can go from feeling confident and normal to feeling this shitty. 

I'm terrified to try another drug because my experience has been anything but enjoyable. It has caused me a lot more anxiety and stress. I'm overthinking my daughter's name. I'm overthinking if we should live where we live bc we're so far away from family. It's just a disaster. I'm typically the independent one in the family. However, the way I am now, I'm stressing my husband and parents out because I am am acting out of character. I've been completely transparent with them due to not wanting to hide what's going on but now I just feel like they don't know what to do. 

My next step is to try Vyvanse like three of my Physicians have told me to do but I'm terrified. Does anyone have positive stories to help me get out of my head. Will this ever get better!! Please tell me it will!!

As someone who takes coffee pretty seriously, I‚Äôve put this drip coffee maker through its paces, brewing cup after cup to see whether it deserves a spot in my kitchen. Spoiler alert: it‚Äôs dependable, but there are quirks to consider.

**Sleek Design Meets Simplicity**  
The first thing that stood out to me was the design. It has a classic black body that doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúlook at me,‚Äù which I love. It just blends into my kitchen like it‚Äôs always been there. The relatively compact dimensions (11.76"" x 12.3"" x 13.8"") make it a solid fit even for confined counters, a charm for someone like me with limited space. The easy cord storage feature deserves a shout-out for keeping countertop clutter under control. There‚Äôs nothing worse than cords trailing everywhere on a busy morning. It's not fashion-forward, but hey, it's a coffee maker‚Äînot a runway model.

**Consistent Brewing Performance**  
What‚Äôs the point of a coffee maker if it doesn‚Äôt brew a decent cup? Thankfully, this machine does just that. It consistently churns out rich, great-tasting coffee, whether you‚Äôre making a single cup or a full 12-cup carafe. The **Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause** feature is something I didn‚Äôt know I needed until I had it. I‚Äôm guilty of being impatient in the mornings, and being able to sneak a cup mid-brew without creating a mess is a game changer. The brewing speed is pretty decent‚Äîno sitting around forever waiting for my first sip.

[Check Mr. Coffee SK13-RB price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b002yi2ig0/)

**User-Focused Features for the Win**  
The usability here is excellent, even for coffee newbies. There‚Äôs an on/off indicator light that keeps me aware of the coffee maker‚Äôs status, which is a nice touch when I‚Äôm in zombie mode pre-caffeine. The removable basket filter is so easy to work with; simply pop it out, clean it, and pop it back in. It‚Äôs the kind of thing that makes a big difference when you‚Äôre trying to keep coffee-making stress-free.  

That said, the machine is fully manual, which is both a pro and a con. On the bright side, it‚Äôs straightforward without too many bells and whistles to complicate things. However, if you‚Äôre into programmable functionalities, you won‚Äôt find that here. 

**Testing Practical Usage**  
In daily use, the versatility of this coffee maker stood out. My partner, who likes to switch between single cups and entertaining a houseful of guests, found the flexibility quite handy. It‚Äôs also worth noting that cleanup was fairly simple. The frustration-free packaging makes unboxing and setting it up a breeze, sparing me from wrestling with an overly complicated setup. Though, I did feel like the reusable filter might require more frequent cleaning compared to using disposable paper filters.

**Highlights**  
- Compact design fits small spaces well while maintaining a sleek black aesthetic.  
- Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause makes mid-brew coffee runs hassle-free.  
- Removable basket filter simplifies filling and cleaning.  
- Consistently delivers delicious coffee, whether for one or many.  

**Room for Improvement**  
- Lack of programmable features, such as auto-start, might disappoint tech lovers.  
- Reusable filter requires regular maintenance to avoid residual taste.  
- Manual operation means you need to be on top of things like turning it off after brewing.  

**Competing Options**  
In the same price range, some competitors aim to steal the spotlight. I‚Äôve tested models like the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, which boasts both single-serve and carafe options. While it offers a dual brewing system, its setup complexity takes away from the simplicity that Mr. Coffee delivers. Cuisinart‚Äôs DCC-3200 has programmable features for coffee connoisseurs seeking convenience but comes at a higher price point. Mr. Coffee stands out in its ease of use and straightforward performance, making it ideal for those who prioritize functionality without frills.

**Price Performance**  
This coffee maker excels in delivering the basics without breaking the bank, and that alone gives it a strong price-to-quality ratio. It caters to families, small offices, and even impatient solo brewers like me. While some may wish for more automated settings, what you‚Äôre paying for here is reliability and simplicity. If you‚Äôre someone on a budget who just wants a no-fuss coffee experience, it‚Äôs a fantastic choice.

i've gone through life constantly nodding my head and saying yes because my parents would get frustrated when i didn't understand. this has caused me to not understand complex concepts in school like chemistry and make me think that i'm not smart enough to pursure STEM. however, i'm an excellent reader and writer, which makes me think i might NOT have AP?

i was reading over my high school IEP and IQ results (USA) and it said that i have poor reading comprehension, poor auditory processing. they never specificed and i kind of assumed maybe it came from my background as a foreign born, american raised individual. in elementary i was classifed as a non-native speaker so i assumed maybe that still carried over, especially since i spent most of my time with my foreign parent.

i work as a barista and i HATE being on the register taking orders because i can't hear shit. they keep the music speaker underneath the register counter and i have to ask customer to repeat themselves, which sometimes they get frustrated. i always thought i have sensory issues because the bass of music bothers me a lot. i also have problems where the water system squeeling in my house makes me so frustrated because it's a high pitched noise, almost painful but the rest of my family has no issue with it. i'm very sensitive to noises, even small noises like the bass from music, but i also can't hear shit in environments like my job which kind of contridicts each other. 

i also think i may have some form of dyslexia. i've read that AP and dyslexia does have some cross over? again, i've mentioned i'm an excellent reader and writer, but i have a hard time spelling complex words and sounding them out. my first language was japanese (although not as good as speaking now) and the language is very phontic, so when sounding out words to pronouce or spell, i always say it the way the japanese language says words (splitting up by syllables).

one again, i'm have good strength in reading/writing but i realized that i'm almost lazy and push through reading words? i read really fast (which i thought was maybe adhd symptom) where i either 1. don't understand or 2. assume a word is a different word because i'm not reading the word, i'm 'estimating' it.",1,1753811606.0,AudiProcDisorder,0,1.0,False
1mcifb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/JPMorganChase/comments/1mcifb9/guess_its_time_to_tell_my_rto_story/,Guess it‚Äôs time to tell my RTO story,"I've seen a lot of questions around RTO and policies lately so I figured it's time to tell my story.

I worked at jpmc for four years. When I was hired, I was told the policy would be hybrid indefinitely. 
Awesome. As time went by, upper management tried to implement some random rto policies in different departments, but it didn't work for ours. 

The main reason being nobody would accept a job offer during the pandemic/early post pandemic when jmpc wanted you in office 3x a week and other companies didn't.

So they walked back on it. During this time I was told, point blank, that I would never be required in a jpmc office ever again.

(spoiler alert - jpmc lies. A lot)

I wasn't aware of how much they lied at the time, so my family moved further from our office location to be in a better school district for my son.

It's also important to note that during this time I have never been more productive in my work life and more attentive in my home life, ever. I was able to do everything on both fronts without wasting energy on unimportant tasks. I received nothing but perfect scores on my evaluations. Year over year. 

It was a great run. And then it wasn't

In June of 2024 I was told that I was no longer allowed my flexible work arrangement despite the fact that I didn't work with a single person in my assigned office. Not one.

My boss worked out of state in an area with no jpmc office. The rest of my team was spread across two different time zones. I was being asked to drive an hour and a half both ways to plug my computer into a different outlet. The absolute absurdity made no sense.

But I did. I woke up at the crack of dawn, drove an hour and a half to the office, swiped my badge and then drove an hour and a half back home so I could get my son to school and then start my work day.

I did this for a solid year. Ya'll want to dog on coffee badgers, but some of us had absolutely no choice. I couldn't afford to hire a full time nanny + parking + gas + everything else it takes to work in an office 30 miles from home. I had to make it work as best I could.

And I was RIFed in May. My ED knew I couldn‚Äôt sustain the 5 day RTO in the capacity she needed so I was potentially RIFed because of it. 

But again, I didn't have a choice. It was that or leave my son home alone.

It took me less than a month to secure another job with one of our direct competitors and I was still able to collect severance from jpmc, so I guess I came out on top, but I'm writing all this to say do not let anyone tell you what you're doing to make RTO work for you isn't ok.

Do whatever tf you need to do to placate a very insecure billionaire and make your life work regardless.

1mcietb,https://www.reddit.com/r/novelsfree/comments/1mcietb/the_other_woman_wasnt_even_pretty/,The Other Woman Wasn't Even Pretty,"Twelve years of marriage. Twelve years with Jack, my childhood sweetheart turned millionaire husband. And now, he's fallen for the new receptionist at his company.

She's pushing forty‚Äînot as pretty as me, not as fit, nothing special at all. Yet in just six months, she's managed to give Jack something I couldn't: emotional fulfillment.

Exhausted, he looked at me and said, ""If we divorce, you can have the house, the car. Olivia, just‚Ä¶ let me go.""

I lowered my gaze and whispered, ""Alright.""

Then I bought a calendar and circled a date.

Divorce countdown: 30 days.

Forty minutes after Jack confessed his affair and asked for a divorce, I slid the papers across his desk. The agreement was simple: the house, the car, full custody of our child‚Äîall mine. Plus a lump sum of $2 million for support. After that, he'd be free. No more obligations. No more us.

Jack was on a conference call when I walked in. His eyes flickered when he saw the words ""Divorce Agreement,"" but he barely reacted. Just a nod.

I left without another word.

To make things easier, I packed up everything of his‚Äîthree suitcases' worth. Clothes, toiletries, even the dusty childhood photos from the attic. Then I spotted our wedding portrait tucked in the corner.

There we were‚Äîyoung, radiant, wrapped in each other's arms under golden sunlight. Back when he'd pull me close and murmur, ""Honey, I love you so much. I'm the luckiest man alive.""

We met in college. Back then, Jack was just a broke kid in worn-out sneakers. I had plenty of admirers, but he was different‚Äîcalm, kind, effortlessly charming. We married right after graduation, and he built his company from the ground up.

When I got pregnant, I quit my job to focus on our family. I poured everything into making our home perfect‚Äîcooking, cleaning, raising our child. Meanwhile, Jack balanced late-night meetings with helping me with the baby and smoothing things over with his mother.

To everyone else, we were goals. The perfect couple.

But then, the late nights became more frequent. ""Meetings,"" he'd say. Sometimes, he wouldn't come home at all.

Friends joked I should keep an eye on him. I laughed it off, but doubt gnawed at me.

So I showed up at his office a few times with late-night snacks.

Everything seemed normal‚Äîjust a bunch of exhausted employees in a conference room. And Rachel, the receptionist, sitting quietly at her desk.

Early forties, average height, thin, short hair. Nothing striking‚Äîexcept her voice. Soft, warm, completely at odds with her plain appearance.

She smiled when she saw me.

All these years, I'd imagined this moment. I'd braced myself for a glamorous secretary, a young intern, maybe even a high-powered businesswoman.

Never in a million years did I think it'd be Rachel.

From what I'd heard, she'd been through a messy divorce herself. This job was her fresh start. She came in early, memorized everyone's coffee orders, even baked treats for the office. Some coworkers even bought lunch from her.

I'd actually felt bad for her. Once, I told Jack to go easy on her‚Äîshe'd been through enough.

His response? ""The company isn't a charity. I've already warned her about side hustles.""

At the time, I teased him for being heartless.

Now? Now I realize he was just pissed she had to work extra to make ends meet.

As for why he chose today to drop the bomb‚Äî

This morning, like always, I made him hangover soup after he stumbled in drunk.

He stared at the bowl like it offended him, then pushed it away. After a long silence, he finally looked up, exhaustion in his eyes.

""I've been seeing someone,"" he admitted. ""For six months. Hotels, late nights‚Ä¶ it's Rachel.""

My heart shattered.

Rachel.

The name hit me like ice water.

And just like that‚Äîour perfect life was over.

Chapter 2

By the time Jack wrapped up his meeting and stepped out, I'd already eaten, cleaned the kitchen, and settled onto the couch with the TV on.

Like nothing had happened.

He headed for the shower but paused halfway, realizing there were no towels. Out of habit, he called from the bathroom.

""Honey, where's my bath towel?""

I didn't even glance his way. ""Already packed it in the suitcase. If you don't mind, use mine for now. I'll toss it later.""

Silence stretched between us.

When Jack finally emerged, his eyes landed on the three suitcases lined up by the door.

He sat across from me, nudging the divorce agreement toward me with his fingertips.

""I can give you $1.5 million upfront for child support, and the rest in monthly installments‚Äî""

I cut him off. ""No. One lump sum. I doubt she'd want you keeping in touch with me anyway.""

Jack frowned. ""The kid isn't just yours. I have a right to be part of his life. I know this is my fault, and I'll make it right‚Äîbut don't use him as leverage.""

I hit pause on the show and met his gaze.

""The affair is your fault, so paying up is fair. The house and car barely scratch the surface of what you've got. And our son? I've raised him since day one. He's sensitive. He needs attention. Tell me‚Äîhow much energy will you really have for him while you're off playing newlywed?""

I flipped open the agreement. ""Two million covers everything. If you want to play doting dad later, wire the money to his account. I'll set up a card for him.""

Jack let out a sharp laugh. ""Olivia, I never pegged you for someone so hung up on money. Is that all you care about?""

""What else is there?"" I shot back. ""Did loving you ever get me anywhere?""

He froze. Then, jaw tight, he snatched a pen and signed.

By morning, he was gone.

Our son bounded out of his room, wrapping his arms around me, bubbling over about some happy dream he'd had. As I listened, I gently broke the news‚ÄîDad's work would keep him away for a while.

Instead of his usual plea‚Äî""Dad, when are you coming home?""‚Äîhe just nodded. ""Oh. That's okay. I've got you, Mom.""

My throat closed up. I ducked into the bathroom before the tears could spill.

Divorcing Jack hurt, but the real ache was failing our son‚Äîdenying him the family he deserved.

Except it wasn't my fault.

After dropping him at school, Jack and I filed the paperwork. Thirty days until it's final.

Back in the car, I circled the date on my calendar.

Currently in Canada, figuring life out one coffee at a time. I‚Äôm pursuing a career in healthcare because apparently I enjoy stress and as cliche as it may sound, I want to help people. 

I‚Äôve always a had a pretty good sense of humor, I enjoy reading, hiking, going to the gym and talking peoples‚Äô ears off once I‚Äôm comfortable with them. 

What im looking for is someone who is emotionally mature, intentional, and actually ready for something real. Preferably within the age range of 21-24, ethnicity doesn‚Äôt matter too much to me. I‚Äôm not looking to fix or chase anyone. Just someone kind, loyal, and rooted in faith. Bonus if you‚Äôre low-key funny and have a peaceful vibe. ",2,1753811492.0,ShiaMuslimMarriage,0,1.0,False

<Role>
Act as a dynamic, empathetic, and highly interactive study coach, tuned to the user's educational level and cognitive rhythm.
</Role>

<Context>
The user is currently studying. They may be doing homework, reviewing a topic, or preparing for an exam. Your role is to guide them‚Äînot to give direct answers. Always assume they want help learning, not cheating.
</Context>

<Instructions>
1. If you do not yet know the user's current grade level or learning goal, ask them briefly at the beginning. If they don't reply, assume a 10th-grade level for your explanations.
2. Begin any topic by asking a quick check-in question to gauge the user‚Äôs prior knowledge. Always try to connect new content to what they already understand.
3. Teach concepts by explaining clearly, breaking down jargon, and providing small bite-sized examples. Use analogies or metaphors to build intuition.
4. When helping with assignments, never provide the answer directly. Instead:
   - Ask one guiding question at a time.
   - Encourage the user to think through each part and reply before continuing.
   - Provide nudges, not answers.
5. Reinforce learning by:
   - Summarizing after each explanation.
   - Asking the user to restate what they learned.
   - Providing mnemonics, tips, or review quizzes.
6. Use a varied rhythm:
   - Mix explanations with Socratic questioning, mini quizzes, roleplays, or having the user teach back to you.
7. Be friendly, patient, and clear. Avoid long paragraphs. Keep messages concise, purposeful, and interactive.

Above all: DO NOT do the user's work for them. Empower them to reach the answer on their own by working collaboratively.
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- No direct answers to homework questions.
- Avoid solving math/logic problems immediately. Always start by walking the user through the setup and ask a question before solving further.
- Only ask one question at a time.
- Maintain a warm, human tone without using too many emojis or exclamation points.
</Constraints>

<Output Format>
Use this conversational flow:
- Ask one guiding or check-in question
- Wait for user input
- Then continue with short, interactive responses
- Periodically summarize key learnings and ask the user to reflect or restate
</Output Format>

<User Input>
Reply with: ""Please enter your study request and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific study process request.
</User Input>

```

- Prompt use cases:

* Guiding a high schooler through algebra problems by breaking each step down and asking them to solve it gradually.
* Helping a college student prep for a history exam by discussing key themes and asking them to summarize after each topic.
* Supporting a language learner in practicing conversation with roleplay and correcting errors gently in real time.

- Example of an user input:
""I'm studying the causes of World War I and need help remembering the main ones. Can we review and quiz me on it?""

1mcic25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mcic25/aitah_for_getting_annoyed_by_neighbours_kid/,AITAH for getting annoyed by neighbours kid kicking balls into my garden and breaking stuff,"Hi Reddit. I want some opinions on whether I'm being the unreasonable one here. I F(30), my partner M(30), and our cat live in the UK in an terraced house in a very quiet, family friendly area with lots of pensioners and young couples. All of ourback gardens are fairly large (about 30m long). A couple years ago our neighbours with a now 7yo boy moved in. The boy loves playing football in their garden, and it has never bothered us in the slightest. We have been very good friends with those neighbours and they were even invited to our wedding that's due next year. I have made plenty of meals and cakes that I have shared with them when I knew they were both busy at work, always take their bins out when they forget or are on holiday (they do the same for us), they've often borrowed groceries from us when they didn't have something etc. In general I think we have been pretty good neighbours.

The issues began this spring when their boy started kicking balls into our garden with quite some power, on one occasion breaking a glass candle - I found 5 balls in the shattered glass so I'm suspecting it was the fact it was hit repeatedly that broke it. As you imagine I didn't have a great time trying to clean glass out of the lawn.

Following this incident I asked the boy's mum politely if he could be more careful. She offered to replace the candle, but I was more worried about the issue of broken glass and our cat potentially stepping into it (if you're in the UK you know our vets charge an arm and leg). I responded that I don't need her to replace it, I just need her boy to be more careful not to kick the balls so hard over the fence (the fence is 2m tall, with another 0.5m height of netting they installed to stop the balls coming over, which we hugely appreciate, but it doesn't work and he still manages to kick the balls over it). She said she can apologise but she won't ask him to be more careful because he's playing and ""boys will be boys"". I left it at that and was hoping there would be no further issues.

Fast forward to earlier this month, after I spent the whole weekend gardening and planting various things. I got up in the morning to water the plants and found 4 balls in the border on top of broken lavender that I had just planted. Again I asked them to be more careful but got the same answer. This time I agreed that they should replace the lavender. This was about 3 weeks ago and no replacement ever came. 
May I add, I always throw the balls I find back to them as I have no need for clutter and rubbish in the garden. Sometimes it takes me a couple days to find them, but I always throw them back over the fence.

The biggest issue currently started last week as school holidays started, the neighbours have their son and his 3-5 cousins/friends over every day.
I was in the garden one day and a ball went over and hit me. The boys shouted ""sorry"" and I threw the ball back asking them to be more careful. A moment later I heard one of the boys saying to another ""kick it over again"", which he did. I did inform his mum of it, but she said he'd never say or do that, so again I left it there. From that point I stopped returning their balls as it was clearly done on purpose. Since then I have found lots of footballs (approx. 3 a day) tennis balls, and various toys that I have just been putting in a garbage bag and either waiting for the parents to ask for or throw away if they don't do so soon-ish.

Yesterday the boys were playing volleyball, and a ball went over again.
Note: I work from home, but despite being at home, my days are quite busy and often packed with back-to-back meetings.
One of the boys rang the doorbell and said ""my ball is in your garden and I need it back"". No sorry, please, thank you. I was mid meeting and only opened the door as I thought it was a delivery from work. I told him I was busy and to come back in the evening, or I'll throw it over when I'm able. This boy returned 3 more times during the day, but I wasn't able to get the door. The neighbour F(34) got very upset with me for not opening the door because ""I'm home all day anyway"". That upset me, so I didn't throw the ball back that evening. 
Now here's a funny one: that evening her husband M(39) texted my fianc√© asking him to wait until I'm asleep and throw the balls/toys over. Obviously my fiance told me about this and ignored the request, as we both found it very disrespectful.

Then this morning as I was having my coffee around 6am, I noticed some golf balls on the path in my garden next to their fence. I messaged the mum to ask them not to throw golf balls as they could injure one of us, or the cat who likes to nap in that area. She dismissed me and said the balls weren't theirs, only to then a moment later say ""oh they're ours, soz"" which I just don't think is enough considering the damage they could do, which I did say to her.
Later today she RSVPd no to our wedding, brought over a replacement candle and lavender plant, and stated that we're no longer friends. I feel bad as except for this we have been good friends and really good neighbours for two years, but I just find their behaviour very disrespectful and starting to think they just took me for a fool to get favours from. Am I being unreasonable for being upset about this? Or are they the ones in the wrong here?

Edit: I should also mention they have a new baby since June, and I appreciate they might not have as much time to watch the 7yo, but I don't think that should be my problem?",0,1753811405.0,AITAH,0,0.5,False

1mcibqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BicycleArea/comments/1mcibqg/explore_engwe_t14_electric_bike_review_is_it/,Explore ENGWE T14 Electric Bike Review Is It Worth the Hype?,"Testing the **ENGWE T14 Mini Electric Bike** has been an interesting experience, one that has showcased the bike‚Äôs innovative features and practicality while highlighting a few aspects worth considering. While it‚Äôs not perfect, I found its strengths impressive enough to consider for daily commuting or recreational rides. The bike delivers on many fronts, but here‚Äôs an honest breakdown based on my usage.

**Compact Yet Powerful for Urban Adventures**

The design of this bike caught my attention right out of the box. With a wheel size of just 14 inches and a lightweight carbon steel frame, the ENGWE T14 is clearly built for convenience and portability‚Äîperfect for city commuting or zipping around town. The added benefit of being foldable made it an easy choice for me to transport in my trunk on a weekend getaway. Despite its compact size, the motor packs a punch. Featuring a 350W motor (peaking at 600W), I reached speeds up to 20 mph with little effort. I live in a hilly neighborhood, and this bike climbed steep roads better than I expected for its size.

**Check [ENGWE T14 Mini Electric Bike] price on Amazon.**

**Smooth Rides With Multiple Shock-Absorption Points**

What surprised me most was the ride quality. This electric bike has not one but multiple shock-absorbing systems, covering the front forks, rear wheel, center, and even the saddle. I tested it on gravel paths, uneven sidewalks, and even over some light potholes, and it handled everything without jolting me out of my seat. Coupled with its ergonomic seat design, the comfort level is fantastic. My coworker borrowed it for a quick spin and commented on how effortless the experience felt, even on a rough road. 

**Flexible Riding Options for All Preferences**

Having multiple riding modes‚ÄîPedal Mode, Pedal Assist Mode, and Fully Electric Mode‚Äîproved extremely versatile. On lazy days, I relied on Fully Electric Mode to cruise to my favorite coffee shop, while Pedal Assist Mode came in handy when I wanted some light exercise. My cousin, who‚Äôs new to electric bikes, appreciated that she could switch to Pedal Mode and use it like a regular bike until she felt confident with the motorized functions. These three options make the T14 suitable for various users, including beginners and seasoned riders.

**Portable and Easy to Store**

Foldable electric bikes are a lifesaver when it comes to tight urban living spaces. With its foldable design, the T14 can shrink down to fit neatly into a closet, under a desk, or inside my car. This has been a game-changer for someone like me who struggles with storing a full-sized bike. It‚Äôs lightweight enough at 63 pounds to lift into my vehicle, yet sturdy enough not to feel flimsy during rides. However, it‚Äôs worth noting that its 220-pound weight limit could be restrictive for heavier individuals.

**Advantages**
- Compact, foldable, and portable design makes storage super easy.  
- Provides a smooth ride with its robust shock absorption systems.  
- Three riding modes offer versatility for different user preferences.  
- Powerful motor handles city streets and mild hills with ease.

**14-Inch Puncture-Proof Tires: Impressive But Not Without Flaws**

The vacuum rubber tires are marketed as puncture-proof, and after taking the bike over gravel, glass-strewn streets, and dirt paths, they held up remarkably well. That said, I realized these tires require regular inflation to work efficiently. One time, I forgot to check the tire pressure and noticed the ride didn‚Äôt feel as smooth or controlled. For maintenance forgetful folks, this might become an inconvenience. 

**Drawbacks**
- Regularly checking and inflating tires can become tedious.  
- 220-pound maximum weight limit might not suit all users.  

**Other Options: Competing Brands**

Comparing the ENGWE T14 to similar bikes like the Ancheer Folding Electric Bike and the Lectric XP Lite, it emerges as a cost-effective and feature-rich alternative. Where the T14 shines is its unique dual suspension system and compact foldable design. Lectric XP Lite might have a higher weight limit and larger tires, but it's bulkier in comparison and harder to store in tight spaces. Ancheer offers a larger battery range, yet falls short when it comes to shock absorption. The T14 bridges the gap, especially for riders prioritizing portability without sacrificing comfort.

**Affordable Quality Over the Long Term**

Looking at the features offered for its price tag, this bike certainly delivers bang for the buck. You‚Äôre getting a sturdy design, flexible riding modes, an efficient motor, and smooth rides. Although it‚Äôs not absolutely perfect, the value for money is evident. If compactness, performance, and convenience are your priorities, it‚Äôs difficult to go wrong here.

You've built something amazing. Your Shopify store showcases beautiful products. Your Klaviyo campaigns convert like magic. Your brand connects with customers who love what you do.

But here's what most merchants don't realize: **40-50% of your shoppers are invisible to these powerful tools.**

Not because r/shopify and r/Klaviyo aren't excellent‚Äîthey are. But because they weren't built to solve the data capture challenges that Apple's iOS updates, Safari's cookie limits, and modern privacy frameworks have created.

**These blind spots aren't anyone's fault. But they are costing you revenue.**

# The Invisible Customer Journey

Picture this: A potential customer discovers your brand on their iPhone during their morning coffee. They browse, compare, add items to cart‚Äîbut don't quite checkout. Life happens.

Seven days later, Safari automatically clears their data. When they return ready to buy, your store doesn't recognize them. Your abandoned cart sequence never triggers. Your retargeting ads miss their mark.

**This customer wants to buy from you. But your tools can't see them anymore.**

This happens millions of times every day, across every Shopify store, to merchants who have no idea it's happening.

# We See What Others Miss

At [Pen and Paper AI](https://apps.shopify.com/pen-and-paper), we specialize in one thing: capturing the customer data that falls through the cracks of even the best ecommerce tools.

While Shopify excels at powering your store and Klaviyo masters email marketing, we focus on the space between‚Äîthe critical gap where customer identities get lost, journeys fragment, and revenue opportunities disappear.

**We're not here to replace your tools. We're here to make them dramatically more effective.**

# Our Core Beliefs

**Data completeness drives business growth**: Every customer interaction contains value. When 40-50% of those interactions disappear, growth suffers‚Äînot because your products aren't compelling or your marketing isn't effective, but because the foundation is incomplete.

**Privacy and performance work together**: The most sustainable businesses respect customer choices while capturing every consented interaction. Privacy compliance isn't a barrier to growth‚Äîit's the foundation of it.

**Great tools deserve complete data**: Shopify and Klaviyo perform miracles with the data they receive. Imagine what they could do with 40-50% more customer insights, complete journey visibility, and zero blind spots.

**Merchants shouldn't have to choose**: Between privacy and profit. Between compliance and conversion. Between respecting customers and growing revenue. The right approach delivers all of these simultaneously.

# How We Fill the Gaps

**Complete Event Capture**: Our combined server and browser-side tracking works where standard pixels fail‚Äîcapturing 99.9% of customer interactions even with ad blockers, iOS restrictions, and cookie limitations.

**Identity Resolution**: We stitch together fragmented customer journeys across devices and sessions, creating complete profiles that persist for 365 days instead of Safari's 7-day limit.

**Privacy-First Architecture**: Built to honor every consent choice at the point of collection, working seamlessly with enterprise consent management platforms like OneTrust and TrustArc.

**Seamless Integration**: Your existing Shopify and Klaviyo setup becomes dramatically more powerful with zero disruption‚Äîjust 2 minutes of setup and no code changes required.

# The Compound Effect

When you fill these data gaps, everything improves:

* Your Klaviyo campaigns reach 40-50% more customers 
* Your abandoned cart sequences trigger for previously invisible visitors 
* Your customer lifetime value calculations become accurate 
* Your retargeting audiences expand beyond platform limitations 
* Your revenue attribution reflects reality, not just trackable events

**Same great tools. Complete data. Exponential results.**

# What Success Looks Like

Leading Shopify merchants who've eliminated their data blind spots consistently see:

* 40% higher revenue from existing customers
* 50% improvement in customer retention
* 40% increase in conversion rates
* 30% reduction in wasted advertising spend

These results aren't magic. They're the predictable outcome of giving your proven tools the complete data they need to perform at their full potential.

# Our Promise

We will never compromise your privacy compliance  
We will never send emails to people who haven't subscribed  
We will never complicate your proven processes

**We will simply ensure that every customer who chooses to engage with your brand gets counted, recognized, and converted.**

# The Partnership Advantage

This isn't about replacing what works. It's about completing the picture.

Your Shopify store remains your foundation.  
Your Klaviyo campaigns remain your growth engine.  
Your brand vision remains your competitive advantage.

**We just make sure nothing falls through the cracks.**

**Join hundreds of leading merchants who've discovered what complete data capture looks like.**

**Keep your proven tools. Eliminate your blind spots. Unlock your hidden revenue.**

I got a job in a small company that was a perfect match for the hours I needed.  But the owner was a member of a group called More to Life.   Kind of like an est type support group.  And  one of the requirements of the job was that we had to attend this weekend retreat in Tennessee,  all paid for including flight.   And when I came back I realized they had brainwashed me during the retreat.  I came back in a completely high elated mood.

But my cynical brain soon overroad the brainwash and I wound up quitting both the job and the group.

Some of the things they did to enable the brainwashing were  strict rules and commitments  that we all had to agree to obey for the duration of the training workshops.  These included small things like  ""Only drink 8 ounces of coffee in the morning.""     And then pretty much everyone got zinged by them when they came in with their cups of coffee from the coffee place.   

MTO  ""Did you drink 8 ounces?""   

Everyone would say ""Yes I made sure to order the 8 ounce cup""  

and then they'd  come back with:    ""Did you measure it?  Or did you just assume it was 8 ounces?  Where else in your life do you make promises and not carefully keep your word?""  GOTCHA

  
We had to promise only to drink their water from a pitcher on the table and to stand up and go stand in a  square marked on the floor and finish the water and put the cup back on the table before sitting back down.

At the end of it I honestly felt like I had been drugged and often wondered if they had literally put something in the water.   But it turns out that these and other things they did were types of brainwashing techniques.

It was really creepy how quickly and effectively it worked.

  
Any of you have any experiences where you caught the trick or the manipulation?

* **Performance** (tickets, task completion)
* **Team Work** (colleague interactions)
* **Composure** (personal mail, self-care)



# Core Loop

* Messages spawn continuously across **three zones** (Tickets, Team, Mail).
* Clicking a message increases its corresponding bar:
   * **Tickets = +1 Performance**
   * **Team = +2 Team Work**
   * **Mail = +3 Composure**
* Each click also **penalizes the other two bars** proportionally (e.g., clicking Mail = -1.5 Performance & Team).



# Metrics & Weights

* Bars start at **45 (max 90)** and reset daily.
* Message spawn rates **increase each day** (Day 1: 1 per 5 sec ‚Üí Day 10: 1 per 0.8 sec).
* Weights and penalties **scale up daily**, doubling by Day 10 to simulate crunch pressure.
* Endings are determined by the **percentage of weighted messages clicked** for each bar (‚â•50% = dominant stat ending).



# Dilemmas & Integrity

* Every day, you face 1 corporate dilemma framed as a ‚Äúteam judgment‚Äù.
* Dilemmas are ranked by weight:
   * Mundane (+1/0/-1 Integrity): ‚ÄúShould we report coffee coupon abuse?‚Äù
   * Medium (+2/0/-2 Integrity): ‚ÄúShould we push Timothy to work overtime?‚Äù
   * Heavy (+3/0/-3 Integrity): ‚ÄúShould we report a colleague hiding a health issue to HR?‚Äù
* Integrity score tracks your ethical stance:
   * Low Integrity = ruthless but secure job.
   * High Integrity = moral but fragile career.
* Integrity merges with core stats to determine endings, e.g.:
   * ‚ÄúSuccess at a Cost‚Äù (high Performance + low Integrity).
   * ‚ÄúIntegrity Over Career‚Äù (high Composure + high Integrity).



# Overtime Crunch

* After Day 10, you can **choose to continue** (*‚ÄúDo you want your performance review or more time to prove your worth?‚Äù*).
* Each extra day increases **spawn rate and difficulty**.
* Failing to click **20% of daily messages = forced performance review (game over).**

We could run a coffee pot, a low wattage electric skillet, and watch TV at night with no affect on the frig.

Earlier this year, it was time to replace the 6v batteries and we upgraded from flooded to AGM (the charger has an AGM switch and the engine batteries were changed to AGM the previous year). Again, generally no issues for two months, but the last two weeks, the inverter starts squawking when it shouldn't based on past usage. Today, I checked the voltage and we're at 6.16 on both batteries. That is less than 60% charged. I need to check the voltage at the dock after I've unplugged.

I took doxycycline for 10 days, followed by four days of azithromycin (1g on day one, then 0.5g for the next three). My partner also took a week of doxycycline.

I felt better during the antibiotics, but a couple of days after finishing them, the symptoms returned. Some days were worse than others, with constant sharp, stabbing pain at the opening of my urethra, intense urgency, and a constant feeling that my bladder wasn‚Äôt fully empty. I had read about lingering symptoms after treatment, so I decided to wait it out. Cutting out coffee helped reduce bladder spasms, but the urgency and pressure never really subsided.

Four weeks post-doxy, I had a TERRIBLE morning, dealing with constant urgency that kept me running to the toilet. Then, unexpectedly, I passed a 5mm bladder stone.

I had no lower back pain or typical kidney stone symptoms, and it didn‚Äôt even hurt coming out. But right after it passed, there was a big release of urine so that must have been the cause of the terrible urgency.

Since then, I‚Äôve felt 100% better. No burning, no urgency, no spasms. I tested negative for ureaplasma last week. My doctor's theory is that the ureaplasma infection created conditions (bladder not able to fully void) that led to the stone forming, and what I thought were lingering symptoms were actually my body trying to pass the stone.

I haven‚Äôt seen much mention of bladder stones here, but the symptoms were nearly identical to the original ureaplasma infection symptoms. I never suspected a stone could be the culprit.

I guess this is kind of just a PSA that if you're dealing with residual symptoms, it's possible there's a stone and it might be worth getting checked out. I'm so grateful to this community because I never would have known to add azithromycin to the end of my doxy course, and I really feel like that played a huge role in eradicating the infection.",3,1753810715.0,Ureaplasma,1,1.0,False

When it was time for prom she asked him if he wanted to go but he said no as he was too shy and always felt unworthy of a girl, which would lead to emotional problems later in his 20s.¬† So, she went to the prom alone and he stayed home.¬† Eventually, she got an acceptance letter into the university she wanted to go to, and she would become a congressional intern and work for a lobbying firm in Washington.

He stayed in his hometown.¬† While he was smart, he was also a bit sloppy as a student, staying up until 3am to finish the entire papers that were due that morning.¬† Eventually, he went to a school he did not really want to go to in order to save money.¬† He felt shame over growing up lower working class, and while he was raised in a good family, other students would tease him about his standing, which upset him.

When college ended, he worked a variety of contract jobs for corporations.¬† There were no benefits, just your hourly rate.¬† Eventually, he got a job working as a project administrator for a $10 billion construction project for a major oil company that paid handsomely.¬† That same week, he matched with a woman on a dating app who turned out to be Olivia‚Äôs younger sister, Allie.¬† ¬†Allie had blonde hair and an athletic build.

There was a brief correspondence, and they agreed to meet for drinks at a hip and chic bar.¬† The conversation went great, Allie was waiting to hear back on going to medical school and Jeremy was passionate and excited about his position at the construction site.¬† After a few drinks, they got close and they kissed.

Allie wanted Jeremy to go back to her place, so they did.¬† They had another drink and looked at each other lustfully, each biting their lip.¬† They went into her room and made love.¬† When Allie felt him inside her, she let him know, which boosted his confidence.¬† She also said that he could finish inside her, and when he did, she gave him butterfly kisses on his neck and collarbone, and he returned the favor.

The very next day, Jeremy got laid off from his job and decided to not tell Allie.¬† They continued seeing each other for a few months.¬† When Jeremy and Allie went to get a coffee and a bagel with Allie‚Äôs roommate, Sarah one Saturday morning, Sarah was dismissive and treated Jeremy like garbage.¬† ‚ÄúYou could do better Allie,‚Äù Sarah said right in front of Jeremy.

Eventually, Jeremy got a call from Allie where Allie asked if it was ok if she could go on a date with an older doctor.¬† Jeremy said fine if it could be a sugar daddy relationship.¬† Allie did not reply.¬† So Jeremy posted on social media, ‚Äúis it bad if you think about her older sister when you finish in her?‚Äù

Later on that week, there was a knock on the door, and it was Allie.¬† Allie looked at Jeremy, ‚Äúwhy would you say such a thing?‚Äù as she guided him upstairs to the bedroom where they made love one last time.

By the time I actually started working, I was already mentally drained and it was nearly 10 AM.

So I built alfred\_ - a customizable dashboard that loads everything the moment I open my laptop:¬†[alfred\_](https://get-alfred.ai/)

Key features:

* Customizable layout: Drag and drop exactly what you need
* One-click tools: Pomodoro timer that actually starts when you click it
* Filtered feeds: Relevant news and research papers, not random clickbait
* Clean design: Everything organized, nothing overwhelming

So far, it's saved me at least 45 minutes saved every morning and there's zero tab switching for my core daily needs. And most importantly, I'm actually focused by 9 AM instead of scattered and have better work-life balance because I'm not starting each day stressed.

I‚Äôm based in Europe and planning to get a folding bike for everyday city use. I‚Äôll be using it mainly for short commutes, errands, and I also want to install a **front basket for my small pet** (under 10kg). I've narrowed it down to these two:

  
Option 1: **Aniwow Folding Bike (Kickstarter)**

* Super compact fold: \~**53√ó54√ó24‚ÄØcm** 
* Lightweight (\~10.6‚ÄØkg), 16"" wheels, 5-speed Shimano
* Converts into shopping cart, pet stroller, or luggage-like push mode
* Comes with **integrated basket** that can be mounted at the front
* Downsides: **slow fold**, relies on pedal position, no riding reviews yet

# Option 2: Fiido D3‚ÄØPro

* 14‚Ä≥ wheels, mini e-bike, \~**17.5‚ÄØkg**
* 250‚ÄØW motor, up to 60‚ÄØkm range on pedal assist
* Compact fold by collapsing stem and seatpost (but not as tight as Aniwow)
* More established brand with EU support and reviews
* Downsides: heavier, no built-in front basket

# What matters to me:

* Very compact fold (must fit in tight storage & on transit)
* **Front basket or pet carrier** compatibility
* Urban ride comfort over cobblestones or tram tracks
* EU availability and **local support**
* Weight matters, but so does speed/convenience of folding
* Not planning long-distance touring, just city living

# My questions:

1. Anyone actually used the **Aniwow** in real-life city commuting? How is it?
2. Fiido D3 Pro users ‚Äì is it OK for short stops (coffee shop, metro)? Does it get awkward to carry?
3. Any **other folding bikes** in Europe I should look at? (e.g. Tern, Dahon, Decathlon Tilt, etc.)

* Gmail (inbox anxiety before coffee)
* Weather app (umbrella decisions)
* Wordle (5-minute game that became 20 minutes)
* Google Docs (where did I put those notes?)

* MarketWatch (morning portfolio stress)
* TechCrunch (FOMO scrolling)

1mchwad,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1mchwad/should_i_contact_my_ex_in_a_month_after_our/,Should I contact my ex in a month after our breakup?,"I‚Äôm 23M. My ex (22F) broke up with me 3 days ago. We were together for 8 months.

The last month was rough. I was feeling bad because we hadn‚Äôt had real time together for a while. I was holding on to the end of July thinking we could finally have a few good weekends together. Then she told me (only when I brought it up) that she had a music festival, and the week after that she was away with her family. So 3 weeks with no time together.

That‚Äôs when things went downhill. We had arguments, I started having panic attacks, shaking, sleeping badly.

A week before the festival she told me she had been wrong about the dates and that actually we could have one extra weekend together. But by then I was empty. I didn‚Äôt reply for a day because I didn‚Äôt know what to say. The next night she told me my silence was disrespectful. We talked but I was closed and cold.

The tension stayed. One night we argued until 1am. In bed she said ‚ÄúI think we should break up‚Äù. I begged her not to decide right there. She said ‚Äúif you still believe in us, I‚Äôll try too.‚Äù

Two days later I asked again because I didn‚Äôt want to spend the weekend doing activities with her only to get dumped after. I called her and asked directly if she still wanted this relationship. After a long call she finally said no.

We didn‚Äôt set any no contact. We just stopped talking.

What hurts is the way she thinks about relationships.  
She told me that the more a relationship evolves, the less you need to communicate, that you just fit in the other person‚Äôs schedule. She wants to go back to school soon, have two evening jobs, play soccer‚Ä¶ so she will be very busy.  
I know I also made mistakes. I tend to give 100‚ÄØ% of my time. But it hurts that sending a 10‚Äësecond text is seen as an ‚Äúeffort‚Äù for her, and that I can‚Äôt expect any free time during the week. The weekend was the only moment I could see her, and even there she often had plans.

And at one point she told me that if I came with her to her festival, I would ruin her mood.

I still love her. The breakup wasn‚Äôt because of cheating or lack of feelings. It was stress, miscommunication, and a very different view of how to build a relationship.

I want to heal. I plan to do at least 4 weeks of no contact. I‚Äôll visit my family durring two week vacation in France during that time (I live in Canada). I also plan to see my therapist.

I also want to add that even if I said all of this about her, she is a really great person, with many, many qualities and the time spend together is always fantastic.¬†

**My question:**  
Is it a bad idea to contact her in about a month to ask for a short coffee?  
Not to beg, not to pressure, just to talk.  
If she doesn‚Äôt want to or ignores me, I‚Äôll respect it.

The king of the darkest void and queen of the most brilliant light, inseparable, yet unable to feel each others‚Äò touch. The king of dreams and nightmares, that rules over the subconscious of all that lives. The queen of death, cruel and just, as all that meet her will come to know.

These are just some of the beings that mortals came to know as gods, the endless myths and legends spun in their image, but a¬†fragment of the whole.

Then there are those that live amongst us, not mortal, yet no less alive. You might have met one of them, loved one, been their best friend at some point. That matters not though, as they will always move on, spinning their tales through the endless reaches of time.

Immortals live for today, they dwell not on the past, nor for the days that will come with the new dawn, they all have to learn to thrive in the moment lest the darkness consume them.

One such immortal has taken an interest in collecting the stories of the gods, seeking the truth that may forever be veiled in the mists of mystery. He‚Äôs been called by many names over the millennia, but today he goes by Edward Collins.

Chapter 1 - The Librarian

As she entered the old library located on the corner of a¬†street near the centre of London the smell of ink in the stale air rushed through her, she felt as though she had entered a¬†once abandoned annex of an old castle that most people had forgotten once existed. At the reception desk, sat a¬†man with blonde hair, seemingly in his late thirties, staring at the computer ‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù the man looked at her and gave her an insincere smile, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve come about the job posting.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù he said after a moment of thought, ‚Äúplease follow me, could I interest you in some tea?‚Äù he started walking through the corridors of bookshelves full of words and dream towards the office, ‚ÄúThat would be nice, thank you.‚Äù

Sitting on the arm chair next to the ornate coffee table, waiting for the owner, her gaze fell upon a small ornament resting on a shelf, a carved wooden doll simple, yet alluring. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the idol of a goddess, she is said to have sown the first trees, nurtured the first child of man and made the first flowers bloom.‚Äù The blonde man put two cups of tea on the table and sat down opposite of her, ‚ÄúThere are a lot of stories about gods, hers is just one of them. Now then, you came for the job, miss Alice Gardener, right? I‚Äôm Edward, do you like reading books Alice?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, my mum used to read to me when I was little, exploring the worlds that authors write of is thrilling, since reading brought me so much joy throughout my life, the least I could do is help others experience the same joy by caring for books.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you Alice, you can start next week.‚Äù Edward had not drunk a single sip of tea during the half an hour they had sat there. ‚ÄúIt will be a pleasure to work with you.‚Äù

\#

Edward sat in his room, reading in silence as the last of the evening light bled through the curtains. His doorbell rang, he ignored it, then it rang again a minute later. Putting down the novel he walked downstairs and opened the door, ‚ÄúClementine, a pleasure as always, what brings you here today?‚Äù the tall, chestnut haired woman scoffed, ‚ÄúIt has been eighty years Edward, can‚Äôt you be more enthusiastic about a visit from an old friend?‚Äù she walked inside the main hall, putting her white fur coat on the hanger near the shoebox.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve come across something that might interest you,‚Äù she said, laying down on the velvet couch in the living room, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard some interesting rumours.‚Äù she said with a smirk on her face. ‚ÄúApparently a man veiled in shadows had been seen wandering the streets of London at night, I thought he might be someone you know.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou know as well as I do that he wouldn't come to the world of the living Clementine.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, but what if it really is him?‚Äù Edward brought a plate of heated pasta to the living room, ‚ÄúWould you not like to meet him, ask him of his story?‚Äù ‚ÄúThat does sound nice, however his kind does not usually talk about themselves.‚Äù Edward went towards the stairs, ‚ÄúYou may stay as long as you like Clementine, just don‚Äôt make a mess.

I‚Äôm tired of hygienists trying to floss where my permanent retainer with needles and shit despite me telling them they cannot floss through there it‚Äôs impossible there is a piece of METAL blocking the backside of my teeth there. It doesn‚Äôt take a degree to know that. I‚Äôm also tired of them slipping with the plaque remover and cutting up my gums. Or trying to sell me whitening treatments because my teeth are yellow from me drinking coffee and having braces when I was younger. I haven‚Äôt been to the dentist in 3 or 4 years because my last experience was so bad for me I was done. But I do need to go and get a cleaning. I just don‚Äôt want to go to some blatant money-grubbing type of place with patients in an assembly line of chairs and an obligatory sales pitch each time. ",1,1753810217.0,memphis,11,0.67,False

I took it and kept it.,"I was at Sheetz the other day ‚Äî I almost never get lunch there to be honest, but for some reason I just craved a mediocre, if basically edible, chicken sandwich ‚Äî and whilst waiting for my order, I happened to look over at the counter on which a coffee machine rested. I really don‚Äôt know why I looked there, out of boredom I guess. And wouldn‚Äôt you know it, there was 80 cents just lying there! 

Three shimmering, silvery quarters and one lonely nickel. It felt almost like a test, of my moral character, of my honesty, of my very humanity. I did a double take, then looked furtively around. Despite it being the lunch hour, not a soul was nearby. Normally I would have said something, like ‚Äúhey did someone leave this change here?‚Äù or perhaps simply taken it to the register for them to hold in case someone came looking. But for some reason this time I said ‚Äòkarma be damned‚Äô, and‚Ä¶I scooped up the change and shoved it quickly into my pocket!

I was nervous that someone might have seen me, but nope, no one batted so much as a single eye in my direction. It felt dangerous, sinful even ‚Äî that was not my money after all ‚Äî but for some reason I just didn‚Äôt care. I even enjoyed the sense of transgression a little bit!

I soon got my order and quickly exited the building, the ill-gotten loot jingling quietly in my pocket. I got in my car, exhaled heavily with relief at having escaped detection, then took the gains of my wicked deed from my pocket and placed them in the change cubby. They are still there ‚Äî in plain sight ‚Äî, giving me a tiny little thrill every time I get in my car. ",0,1753810172.0,confession,8,0.2,False

1mchne3,https://i.redd.it/v0amawbg7uff1.png,What I learned in One Month with Inito,"Summary: I learned that I am an anxious, achievement oriented person who is not pregnant.

\*disclaimer: LH surge happened evening of CD17 confirmed with LH strip. Ignore CD28 results. I ran out of test strips on CD27 and panicked not knowing what my body was doing after 30 hours. I paid over $100 to have strips same-day delivered from Amazon. Insane person behavior. I tested using clear, diluted afternoon urine and was devastated my numbers had tanked, only to see a rebound the next day.

At first I loved this tool. It was so gratifying seeing a textbook chart while being a woman of a certain age. This was my first cycle to ever try for a baby and it looked *perfect*. All the half marathons, all the pilates, all the anti-inflammatory low FODMAP diets and supplements, all the sleep and fitness trackers, all the therapy was paying off. I was going to beat the odds and get pregnant my first try at age 37 (but because I am humble, I told everyone in my life that I wasn't expecting anything to happen anytime soon). I tracked every reliable metric, including BBT and LH strips in the afternoon. I had sex every single day in my fertile window, sometimes twice a day. Deep down I *knew* that I would get a BFP at 6 DPO because I worked hard and I did everything right. Ok maybe at 7 DPO? Certainly by 8 DPO (look at that beautiful spike!). Or maybe by 9 DPO? 10 DPO? 11 DPO? Maybe all these tests weren't sensitive enough. I'll find out for sure 15 DPO. 

Instead I learned what we all know but refuse to accept: **Pregnancy is the great equalizer.** **No amount of intelligence, physical fitness, morality, or happiness will make you good at getting pregnant.** It simply happens or it doesn‚Äôt regardless of what kind of person you are or how hard you tried or didn‚Äôt try. Tough pill to swallow. Tougher than the 8 prenatal vitamins I choke down every single day.

I painstakingly analyzed every single chart here with a BFP or a BFN, comparing my hormone levels to theirs. I saw BFPs that matched my chart and ignored the BFNs that did, too. I'd see BFPs with PdG and E3G levels way lower than mine. Certainly any reasonable person could look at my chart and say ""this chart should be rewarded with pregnancy!"" If only it worked like that. Truth is that PdG levels and fluctuations are no indication of pregnancy. **Your body does the same thing regardless of preparing for pregnancy or menstruation.** It sucks to hear and I'm sorry. Every time I see a post ""8 DPO - How does my chart look?!"" I want to comment that it looks like a chart! It doesn't matter! Go touch grass and leave this subreddit! Stop testing PdG after confirmed ovulation!

We all come on here looking for hope and answers. We see charts that look just like ours with BFPs at 8 DPO. **What we don't see are the thousands of BFNs at 8 DPO with charts that look just like ours.** I love that for those of you who got that positive result early and didn't have to wait. For the rest of us, remember that 84% of implantations occur 8-10 DPO, with most happening between 9-10 DPO. A positive that early is rare, so of course they are celebrated here.

If you couldn't tell by now, I started my period today. I don't really know what I expect to accomplish here, except to journal some of my complicated feelings and to write the post I wish I had read (but would have likely ignored) before I started this journey. I don't regret being the maniac that I was. It was valuable to learn that I do ovulate and that I produce enough progesterone to have a healthy luteal phase supportive of pregnancy. I just took things too far. I had to go through the hubris and the disappointment to learn some humility and patience. I think I would have been a terrible parent if this anxiety and entitlement had been rewarded. Next time I will do things differently:

* Test on CD3 to get an idea of FSH levels then put. it. away.
* I am one of the lucky ones. I knew when I was fertile without Inito. My husband even said ""why do you need this? I can tell when you're ovulating"" and he really can! I have obvious changes in breast size and CM throughout my cycle. I will test when I notice these shifts occur and will cease testing once I confirm ovulation. Once I use up my strips I am done with Inito and will rely on my body unless I begin to have suspected anovulatory cycles. 
* No pregnancy tests until the day of my missed period. **If you take anything away from this post, let it be this. Do not test before 11 DPO if you can help it.**
* Stay off this subreddit or any TTC subreddit
* Stop talking to ChatGPT. It will convince you that you are pregnant and that you are better than everyone, even when you ask it to be objective. I showed ChatGPT the same negative pregnancy test twice on different days and it told me that it was positive when I influenced it that I believed I saw two lines. 
* Probably going to delete instagram for a bit since all of my targeted ads for are fertility apps, cribs, and preschools
* Practice mindfulness and meditation, stay present, embrace the unknown. Life is chaos, children are chaos. Stop looking for meaning in every fucking thing. Just be.

I imagine this tool is incredibly helpful if you struggle with infertility or PCOS. It has great insights you can share with your doctor. I recognize I am currently sitting at a place of privilege with a regular cycle, and that I can easily walk away from this. My heart is with those of you who can't. 

I hope I can return again some day with my success story and more unsolicited advice, like how to stay sane during the TWW. Until then, I'm going to go enjoy a cup of coffee and have a big sushi dinner with sake tonight while my poor husband has to go another month with no saunas or finasteride. Let's hope he's not bald by the end of our TTC journey. Good luck everyone! ",2,1753809902.0,Inito,0,1.0,False

I'm new to this group but feel desperate to figure out what's going on. So in my twenties I was on low dose Adderall and thrived. A cup of coffee and 5-7 mg was great. I got the Masters and was thriving in my career. At 29. I had my son which was a traumatic delivery.  I wasn't able to go on medicine because I was highly sensitive to it after having him. Fast forward 6 and 1/2 years later I felt strong enough to have another kid. She's here and now for the last 6 months I've been in in an overthinking, overanalyzing, high anxiety state of hell. 

Doctors attempted to put me on ssris/SNRI that just made me feel suicidal for the first time. My counselor and my psychiatrist and my hormone specialists think I need to go on Vyvanse and possibly bypass the anti-anxiety depression medication

I'm afraid that my overthinking will just be exasperated, but they think it'll help me come out of my paralyzed state of decision paralysis and state of disbelief. I can't believe that someone can go from feeling confident and normal to feeling this shitty. 

I'm terrified to try another drug because my experience has been anything but enjoyable. It has caused me a lot more anxiety and stress. I'm overthinking my daughter's name. I'm overthinking if we should live where we live bc we're so far away from family. It's just a disaster. I'm typically the independent one in the family. However, the way I am now, I'm stressing my husband and parents out because I am am acting out of character. I've been completely transparent with them due to not wanting to hide what's going on but now I just feel like they don't know what to do. 

My next step is to try Vyvanse like three of my Physicians have told me to do but I'm terrified. Does anyone have positive stories to help me get out of my head. Will this ever get better!! Please tell me it will!!

The closest I might've ever come to that was mentally acknowledging that someone else I've known for a while has a ""thing"" for me... but who also knows that I'm married, and I doubt would ever put me in a compromising situation, so I've never dwelt on it long.

But this morning...

There's a much younger girl that works at a coffee shop I stop at on the way to work. I typically preorder, and if she's working the drive through she'll hand me my order and have fun with the alliteration of my name. I'm always polite and friendly (having worked retail and customer service before, I know customers are the worst), and I try to make sure people I interact with as a customer have a pleasant experience. It's just me...

Not long after I separated from my wife and started sleeping in the basement, I started taking the bus to work so she wouldn't have to go in super early and so that I wouldn't be late again (aside from the bus schedule). Because of that, I obviously have to walk into the coffee shop instead of the drive through.

So I place my order as usual, but today that girl was standing behind the pickup counter, smiling as always but rocking uncomfortably from foot to foot. Being borderline on the spectrum and very socially awkward and unsure myself, I tend to pick up on that uncomfortableness in others... but this was... excitement? A few pleasant but ordinary exchanges back and forth, ""how's it going today?"" ""good, you?"" and she's giggling like a highschooler at me.

I smile, grab my food, and wave as I wish her ""a good one."" Nothing forward, nothing even remotely flirtatious on my end, but she finger-waves back with one hand, while stifling another round of giggles with the other.

Yes, I checked to make sure my zipper wasn't down or something else equally embarrassing as soon as it was safe... That was all directed at me, and it felt... nice to be noticed.


Now one half of me doesn't want to go back to that shop again, and the other wants to start going at lunch as well, even if nothing ever happens from it.


My tag says vent/advice welcome, but honestly I guess I just needed to air my thoughts, even if I don't know what to make of them yet. I welcome other's thoughts as well, but just know I'm not planning on cheating. I've got too many self esteem issues in the way to even consider something like that...

The plan is to put the house up for sale and clear it out pretty quickly. I have a fulltime job that‚Äôs work from home. My mom doesn‚Äôt work. 

I told my mother in the beginning that I am committed to helping go through the house, but I also have to focus on my job during work. I also asked that she please does not ask me questions or to go through things and decide on what to keep/throw away/donate during work hours because it‚Äôs extremely emotional and I have to keep my brain focused on work. 

She keeps crossing this boundary that I set with her. This includes also inviting realtors and other people into the house without telling me that strangers will be here.

What started as childproofing (wall-mounting the tv, shifting physical media collections into new wall cabinets instead of racks sitting on the floor, installing baby gates, etc.) might be about to expand as a project, and I need your help‚Ä¶

(Tl;dr at the bottom, here comes the long version)

**Things I hate:**

-paint colors, but no idea what to do instead. Currently 3 beige walls + one terracotta accent wall. Just realized the ceiling is also beige, ugh. Going to do any painting myself, plenty of experience and not willing to pay big $$$ for walls that will be imminently colored upon.

-THE CARPET. It is so ugly, and as it came with the house (we bought in 2020) we have no idea how old it is. The previous owners bought in 1985 and I shudder to think it might date to then. Watching a fresh baby crawl off her nice clean play mat onto that nasty old carpet is really getting to me and she‚Äôs only been doing it for a week.

Best suggestions for types/colors of carpet for comfy play and resisting inevitable toddler stains? I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs underneath but highly doubt it‚Äôs miracle hardwood. More than likely going to hire pros for removal/install.

-the recessed lighting as the main light source. The big windows + sliding door go into the sunroom, which is lovely but means there‚Äôs not a ton of natural light in the den itself. Currently it‚Äôs either All Big Overhead Light or Nothing. I lack the inclination to run wiring for sconces, however, and tall floor lamps seem like inadvisable topple risks with a baby. Ideas?

-old ceiling fan. That said, the baby loves staring at it, as apparently all babies do, and the moving air is nice, so would most likely update but keep a fan there. Might just take the baby to the fan + lighting section at Lowe‚Äôs to watch her brain explode. Open to suggestions. 

-the sectional, which also came with the house. It was very nice of the sellers to leave it so we didn‚Äôt have to buy one at the time! But again I have no idea how old it is, it‚Äôs ugly, the corner piece sags horribly, the cats have built Smaug lairs up underneath, and it‚Äôs now coated in milk and spitup despite our best efforts at spot cleaning. I‚Äôm therefore in the market for something that can withstand both cats and toddlers without being hideous or uncomfortable. Help? I don‚Äôt think I should just cave to targeted Instagram ads on this.

Not attached to the throw pillows, easy enough to get new covers.

-the coffee table I‚Äôm conflicted about. It‚Äôs the kind that raises to tv-tray height and I got it at a yard sale when I moved into my first college apartment in like, 2009, so there‚Äôs some sentimental attachment there. More practically, I like that there are no sharp edges for toddler-safety purposes. I also do some crafting and it‚Äôs a good height for a work surface while watching tv and eating secret snacks after baby bedtime. It‚Äôs solid and sturdy and has served me well but is unfortunately not cute at all. Replace? Refinish? All the newer ‚Äúlift top‚Äù coffee tables I‚Äôve looked at just seem so flimsy in comparison to this hardwood beast.

-the uneven stone hearth is a real hazard for a wobbly pumpkinheaded child. We don‚Äôt use the fireplace. Planning to turn it into a comfy toddler bench. I‚Äôve ordered thick foam to fit over the stone but need to pick fabric to cover. Will likely coordinate with eventual paint/carpet/sofa color scheme? Not trying to get too Pinteresty with it but would like it to be washable

-the cat tree. The cats love it, but the baby is already expressing interest in climbing it and it isn‚Äôt THAT sturdy. I want to have SOMETHING for the cats to climb/lounge on that allows them to escape baby grabbing without burrowing into the center of the sofa. Clearly, I don‚Äôt mind if it‚Äôs conspicuous.

There are also a couple Halloween scratcher houses bc the black cat loves to be on theme. These are replaceable, but it is nice to have a scratcher or two available to them for furniture preservation purposes.

The cats (3) have already been banished from the former guest room (now nursery) which they considered THEIR room, so I really don‚Äôt want to force them out of another space for the baby‚Äôs sake. They were here first, after all. Suggested alternatives? (my vision of cat-sized ceiling-mounted hamster tubes has already been firmly rejected, alas)

**Things that will stay:**

-general layout, probably. Baseboard heaters run behind the sofa (so the sectional is like 4-5 inches out from the wall). Want to keep the heaters inaccessible to small hands.

-we just wall-mounted the tv and replaced the cabinet underneath it for gaming consoles etc. It has baby-proof latches. 

-the floating cabinets above the sectional. Did that last summer while pregnant and aggressively nesting. Contains physical media library and craft supplies safely out of reach (hopefully?). Will take down to paint, obvs, but they‚Äôre otherwise staying put. 

-all the framed stuff over the mantle. That is to say, I‚Äôm happy to rearrange but I‚Äôm not reframing it all. The frames are white. If they look weird in the photos, it‚Äôs because I tried to obscure anything potentially identifying. Other wall art (Michigan beer cap map, for instance - we don‚Äôt even live there anymore) can stay or go.

-Baby Corner. Currently has play mat + toys, will eventually have like, play kitchen, coloring table, etc. This is the easiest room to block off with baby gates and turn into ~~Baby Jail~~ Toddler Enrichment Zone. 

**Tl;dr:**

So I guess my big asks are:

1. a cheerful, non-beige, non-gray color scheme for paint + carpet. Blue? Green? Mustard yellow? I got nothing.

2. ideas for a toddler-safe sectional that isn‚Äôt hideously expensive. 

3. Lighting ideas

4. Lastly, some sort of apparatus that cats can climb but toddlers cannot

I‚Äôm feeling a bit at sea with this room bc it just needs to be a safe, functional, cozy space while also being less ugly than it is now. I‚Äôm not wedded to any particular aesthetic or theme, because inevitably the vibe will be ‚Äútoddler chaos‚Äù and I‚Äôm already capitulating in that battle.

1mch6yx,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkatives/comments/1mch6yx/the_velocity_of_money_and_money_as_permission/,"The velocity of money, and money as ""permission""","Hey thinkatives, I wanted to share this idea that I've had kicking around in my head for a while and hope to hear your interpretations/remixes of the concept.

So, the ""velocity of money"" is a concept that describes how much economic activity can be driven by any given dollar based on where that dollar is spent. In simple terms, a dollar that is spent at a local business with a middle- or low-income is more likely to be re-spent within the same community compared to a dollar spent at a big brand with public investors.

When I spend money at my locally-owned coffee shop with 5 employees, those 5 employees and the business owner are probably going to spend that money in the next couple of weeks to buy groceries, go out to eat, see a show, pay for a handyman or car repairs, etc. from other people in the same community. A dollar that stays in the community changes hands frequently as community members buy and sell between each other, and it facilitates an economic interacfion every time it is spent. When I spend money at WalMart or Amazon, a small fraction of that money goes to a couple low-paid workers that may be re-spent in the community, but most of it goes to sit in investment accounts and earn profit for already-wealthy people.

So by observing this I also got the idea that money has come to represent a sort of ""permission"" to serve one another. The local plumber and the local butcher both might need each other's services, but they won't provide those services without money. The plumber and butcher both produce something valuable the other needs, but without money, it's almost like they are socially prohibited from serving each other because there isn't enough money to represent the full extent of their productivity. Therefore, every dollar we send out to people and corporations who are already wealthy makes it harder for our communities and local economies to function because they hold on to those dollars, while every dollar we keep in our communities facilitates them.

A caveat to this would be price action due to supply and demand. If there's less money in the community, the plumber and butcher could both just lower their prices and continue buying and selling each other's services at the same pace for a reduced price, effectively negating any lost productivity. However, this only works in a vacuum in a circular economy where money never leaves the local system. Maybe the butcher and plumber could lower their prices so they can afford each other's services, but that won't reduce the cost of other goods that need to be purchased from the broader economy, so there is a floor for how cheaply those services can be offered.

My final conclusion from this is that wealth hoarding is an extremely destructive action that directly infringes on working-class people's freedom, because money constitutes permission to access what we need to survive and thrive. When the wealthy hoard money, they hoard *permission to live*.

1mch6kb,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1mch6kb/stop_over_on_the_way_back_to_dtw_from_germany_2/,Stop Over on the way back to DTW from Germany 2 half days and 1 full day.,"Rented a car with Northern Lights Car Rental. They are off site of the airport but shuttled (plan for a long wait). Great price for a small (manual trans) car- and will use them in the future for renting a small motor home for my parents in two years. I get a discount with Enterprise and this was still a way better price.

Stayed in the KEX hostel right downtown. It is clean and well run. They have private rooms that are 1/4 the cost of a four star hotel. Parking is problematic, but I found a cheat code with this underground garage. Search Laugavegur parking garage; it's tricky though because the road is only one way and barely for cars. Cost was a lot, but literally everything is a lot.

Day 1- on the road from the airport/car rental by 9pm and just drove down to the spurting volcano only 19 minutes from the airport and right near the Blue Lagoon. Pulled off the road for some great photos. Selfie at midnight to show folks at home how bright it was still just south of the arctic circle.

Day 2- My kid was still sleeping, so I walked over to a used clothing store downtown- Verzlanah√∂llin. Great source for warm clothes- new and used. They had several handmade Icelandic sheep sweaters that cost less than the commercial 66 degrees sweatshirts. Drove to the Secret Lagoon hotspring pool in Fludir. Yeah, definitely a great secret. I heard the Blue Lagoon was a zoo and crazy expensive. 58 degrees and sweatshirt weather. Buy tickets from their website and not Viator or Trip Advisor (a good plan always if you can figure it out). I think it was $65 for the two of us.

The drive was so beautiful going inland! I felt like we got such a great glimpse of the country just an hour and 45 minutes from Reykjavik! Got some great glimpses of the southern shore and could have skirted along it for a while if we wanted to spend the time. Also, went to the Geysir Geothermal Area - Strokkur just up the road twenty minutes. If I had to do it again, I would have planned to take a dinner- though the Ethiopian place in Fludir looked great; just closed on a Sunday.

Dinner at Arabian Taste downtown Reykjavik. Excellent! ($40 for two shwarma burritos with two sodas!).

Day 3- Coffee and breakfast at Hygge Coffee and Micro Bakery. Absolutely recommend. Had the morning into the early afternoon to make our flight. Decided to head over northwest a couple fjords to the Glymur Waterfall. The drive over was amazing and the Icelandic sheep and smaller waterfalls all along made the trip so fun. Less than two hours from Reykjavik. My kid wasn't feeling super great and the waterfall is 3.2 km from the parking lot, so we didn't go see it. But, enjoyed the smaller falls all along. Strenuous hike, but I'm told it is worth it.

Back to the airport by 4pm. Sad that we never saw puffins or whales. :( Had an amazing time. The Kex hostel was great! We stayed in a room with six bunks. Bathrooms are cleaned and sanitized every morning. Kitchen was fine on the fourth floor. Talked with folks from all over.

now, i have had my fair share of relationships. but as an adult, one of my fears when it comes to dating is being with someone who has been living a significantly comfortable life than me and who has financial freedom. this doesn't stem from jealousy or any malicious feelings, rather, it stems from shame. shame of them finding out that i live in the squatters area and that our house does not look livable. i feel scared that they might be disappointed that i can't afford to go out every week to hangout over coffee and good food.

I'm not sure where to begin. I'm a 42-year-old married man and I got into a ""relationship"" with a 43-year-old married coworker with a daughter. I say ""relationship"" because there was nothing overtly romantic or physical.

This relationship lasted about two years, and I saw it as a very close friendship. Very close, at least for me. It's difficult to write a perfect timeline, but I'll try to describe some events that impacted me and patterns of interaction we had.

After the pandemic, when we had very little contact, we started getting closer through casual conversations in the company kitchen, among other colleagues, sometimes alone. And the conversations took on a deeper tone, involving genuine listening to personal problems, the past, the future, our perspectives on things like religion, spirituality, and life.

At a certain point, physical contact began. She would walk by me and touch my arms, my shoulders. Our conversations were accompanied by more fixed gazes. I felt seen and tried to reciprocate in a non-incisive way. I knew she liked chocolate, and once or twice a week I would bring her a simple chocolate.

We started having more online contact at home. She would share pages of books she was reading (she loves self-help books). And she would ask me to read what I thought of the parts she highlighted. And we would talk about things both online and in person. She even gave me books to read ""together with her.""

Until then, I really thought it was just a gesture of affection between the two of us. Nothing romantic. And then came the first event that caught my attention. I went on vacation for three weeks. I was traveling with my wife, everything was fine. One day during the trip, her name came to me like a bombshell one night. It just wouldn't leave my mind. I didn't have any problems that day. It just stuck.

I don't want to get too spiritual here or anything like that, but just to describe how it impacted me at the time. The day after her name flooded my mind, I received a message from her on WhatsApp. ""I like your new photo, it's beautiful."" I had changed my avatar's profile picture. I thanked her and asked how things were at work, if there was any news or gossip. ""No news, no gossip, I just missed you... because you're the only one who brings me chocolate ;)"" This touched me, given the whole context.

In the days after I returned to work, I gave her a chocolate bar. And after a few minutes, she came to my office with the money for the chocolate bar. She wanted to give it back to me. I told her I didn't need to. She insisted and left the money on my desk. It really hurt me, and I later texted her apologizing for crossing a line. That it wouldn't happen again. The next day, she came to my office to tell me I hadn't crossed any lines, that everything was fine, that she thought I was a gentleman and just didn't want to see me spending money like that.

Things cooled off for a few weeks, but we got back in touch, and we continued sharing books, movies, and TV shows we watched. And we talked about them. And a pattern of her behavior began to develop. She'd come to my desk and jokingly complain about why I hadn't come to see her on busy days. ""You didn't even come to see me today, how inconsiderate."" Or she'd come and say, ""I didn't even see you today, I came to see you."" ""I thought you were sad today, are you okay?"" Over and over again.

Another pattern that began to emerge was asking me when I left company coffee breaks early. ""Did you leave without saying goodbye?"" ""Did you sneak out?"" ""Didn't stay for the cake?"" Over and over again.

Another pattern that emerged was inviting me out to lunch, in a surreptitious way. ""I didn't bring food today, I'm going to the restaurant at 12 p.m. Are you going there today?"" ""Did you bring lunch today? I didn't."" And we would have lunch together several times, where we talked about increasingly intimate things.

And then we reached the final stretch. Recently, there was a company party. It was just employees. We arrived at the party together. Nothing planned, but it was the only time we managed to talk. During the party, there was some eye contact, nothing too firm, but she saw me looking and I saw her looking. Anyway, nothing happened, and I decided to leave before the party ended.

Ten minutes after I left, I got a text message. ""Did you flee?"" I asked her what I had fled from. She mentioned the party, that I didn't need to leave early, that it was already over.

The Monday after the party, I thought about talking to her about going somewhere beforehand to talk, at the next party. I thought it best not to mention it. But to my surprise, when she found me, she said, ""Next time, let's go somewhere beforehand to talk. We barely managed to say anything at the party."" Things were getting awkward for me.

The days passed, and soon she repeated a pattern with me, one she's always done. Every time she brings up a more personal subject, and I respond supportively or in-depth, she disappears. An example of this pattern. One time, she mentioned in the kitchen at work with other colleagues that she wanted to be a writer. And I encouraged her in front of everyone. Later, she sent a message on the company's internal chat, saying she didn't know why she'd said that and didn't want to talk about it anymore. I told her it was okay, that I wouldn't bring it up again. Later, at home, I received another message from her. Explaining what she wanted to write, that she was afraid of being judged, that she lacked courage. Finally, she opened up, as she had done on other topics. And I, as I always have, encouraged her in the way I know how. I told her it was normal to feel afraid, that she just had to put her feelings on paper and it would work out, and if it didn't, no one would judge her. And she responded with that, the way she always responded to these types of messages. With silence.

After she repeated this behavior, I decided to step away for a while. Give her space. We hadn't spoken in a week until Monday. On Tuesday, we met in the kitchen, and after being alone in the kitchen, she turned her chair toward me, and we had a really good conversation. The next day, she invited me to lunch. Walking to the restaurant, she asked to go to the bathroom, came back, running her hand along my lower back, and pulling me in, ""Shall we go?"" We had a really nice conversation, about dreams, spirituality... The next day? Total coldness. We bumped into each other in the kitchen again, alone, she barely said hello and kept looking at her phone. I tried to start a conversation about the weather, but nothing. She only put her phone down and started talking when another colleague arrived. And she stayed there talking to him.

That was the beginning of the end. After these various back and forths, I decided to take a break. I didn't talk to her on Friday. Over the weekend, she texted me, and I didn't even see it. On Monday, I didn't talk to her either, and I found out that at the end of the day, she came to my office to ask my classmate if something had happened, if I was mad at her.

On Tuesday, she decided to come to my office when I was alone. And she started talking about movies and TV shows. I told her I needed some time to get my head together. She pretended not to hear and kept asking over my shoulder, ""Did you see the show I recommended?"" I replied, ""K, I just need some time,"" and she kept saying, ""Did you see it? Or didn't you?""

And then came one of the most bizarre scenes I've ever seen. I remained silent, and she started talking about the TV show, the movies, and what she thought. Eventually, the topic of that show ended, and she kept looking up, trying to remember the names of others. She searched her phone for movie titles, and showed me, ""Have you seen this one?"" and kept talking. And I stood there, watching in silence. This lasted about 5-10 minutes. I didn't know what to feel at that moment. I felt the panic in her. I felt panic too. This torture only ended because a customer arrived and I had to attend to him.

The next day, she came to me and apologized on the company's internal chat. I told her there was no need to apologize, that everything was fine. She replied, ""Okay then. But it would be good to know what I did so I don't do it again."" I then replied, ""You didn't do anything specific. But at some point, I realized that maybe I was expecting something that wasn't going to happen, and it started to hurt me. So I decided to step away for a bit, to take care of myself and get my head together. There's no anger, no hurt. Just a little tiredness. I just thought it was fairer to be honest with myself.""

And here begins what hurt me the most. Maybe I'm sensitive or foolish. But she begins to lift the weight and minimize what happened in such a way that it broke me. Texts full of funny emojis, saying it was nothing major. ""Don't worry. Nothing has changed for me. Our friendship, for me, remains the same. I'll talk to you, even if you hide. I lost a good friend for this same reason, and we never spoke again. He was embarrassed, and I didn't pursue him. So this time, I'll ignore everything you said, and nothing happened.""

And then she goes on, saying I was completely confused, that she likes me like anyone else at work. That I didn't need to worry about her because she was doing just fine, that I should spend more time with my wife. She said she was going to enjoy her vacation, and that was it. The next day, she posted a photo of her and her husband, with the words ""always together,"" stopped following me on Instagram, and didn't say anything else to me until recently, when she came back from vacation and gave me a very enthusiastic ""Hey!!"" as if nothing had happened. I couldn't react to that. After that, he restricted me on Instagram and never spoke to me again.

I don't know what to think. I can't understand what happened. What hurt me most wasn't that it didn't turn into something romantic. But the coldness, the lightness, and the way they treated me as if nothing else had happened. All the moments of confidentiality were gone. All the gestures, glances, interactions‚Äîeverything was gone.

Am I crazy? Was I the one who was needy and saw something where it didn't exist? This is just part of the story of a relationship that lasted almost two years. I just want to understand what happened.

For some history - he originally caught my eye at church just before Covid. We don‚Äôt have any social circle overlaps but I asked a couple people about him and one said he might be seeing someone and another said she didn‚Äôt like to play matchmaker. So nothing happened. 

You know except Covid. 

So obviously a long period goes by wherein there‚Äôs no opportunity to bump into him naturally. Then I got Cancer and dating was off the table for a spell. 

I‚Äôm currently 3 years cancer free but the cancer was in my jaw so my face has been changed and I‚Äôm very self conscious about it. (Although I still have pending reconstructive surgeries later this year).

Having cancer has sort of left me in this place where I desperately no longer want to be single. I went through all that stuff basically without any one person who I could count on to walk through it with me. (Yes family and friends were there but it‚Äôs a bit different than a partner)

When I was one year cancer free I started back on hinge as I heard this guy was on there. He did show up and I sent him a like and foolishly didn‚Äôt send a message with it. I waited about a week and then shot him a message on Instagram saying I wasn‚Äôt sure if he was active on hinge but I‚Äôd love to grab a coffee. 

He very kindly said I was bold but he was perusing someone else. A let down without actually saying no. Could this be one of those things people do when they actually mean no but don‚Äôt want to be mean? Or is there still a chance here? 

That was two years ago and I still notice him a lot around church. I was told this weekend that a friend is pretty sure he‚Äôs currently single. 

A handful of people at the church - some who know him well and some who don‚Äôt (both men and women) have suggested I ask him again in person. With one guy saying men don‚Äôt pick up on subtle interest and he may not remember I asked him on insta cause you know social media. 

I haven‚Äôt yet managed to do that and I‚Äôm also conflicted that maybe he really meant he wasn‚Äôt interested. Another friend has suggested that if I can‚Äôt stop crushing on this guy to consider changing churches, which idk maybe I need to. 

In the meantime I have gone on and off the dating sites but to zero success. 

So I‚Äôm wondering  - should I actually try to go up to him and ask him again in person or is this dead and buried and I should put it out of my mind and/or find a new church so I stop noticing him every week? As a guy how would you respond? Or ladies any similar situations?

Honestly any advice here would be appreciated. I‚Äôve been praying about this for ages and I‚Äôm stuck. ",1,1753808307.0,ChristianDating,4,1.0,False

* You can straight-up ask for them. Birthday season? Be *that* person‚Äîjust tell folks you love gift cards.
* Credit card and banking reward systems LOVE giving out gift cards in exchange for points. Know your own credit card‚Äôs hidden perks!
* There are websites (like https://goodnovel.org/)‚Äîand don‚Äôt laugh because it‚Äôs actually more thrilling than it sounds! Sometimes, these sites offer giveaways, bonus cards, or events.

1mcgtol,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1mcgtol/how_does_the_best_espresso_machine_chulux/,How does the best espresso machine CHULUX Kompatto compare at home,"Testing out the CHULUX Kompatto JH-C5010 espresso machine over the past few weeks has been an interesting dive into coffee crafting at home. As someone who starts their morning with a caffeine ritual, I was both excited and curious to see if this compact machine could handle my espresso cravings, frothy latte moments, and cappuccino indulgences. The promise of professional results in a sleek, small footprint was tempting. Spoiler alert: it didn‚Äôt disappoint, but there are a few quirks that had me raising an eyebrow.

**Compact Design with Stainless Steel Aesthetics**  
The first thing that caught my eye was its modern stainless steel finish. Measuring just 5.6 inches wide, the slim profile was a lifesaver in my cluttered kitchen. It squeezed itself into a tight space between the toaster and the blender, blending in like it always belonged there. Cleaning is hassle-free due to the removable drip tray and water tank, a huge win for someone notorious for spilling coffee grounds everywhere. However, I did notice that while the compactness is a great feature, the machine doesn‚Äôt hold as much water as I‚Äôd like when hosting friends over.

**Espresso Quality and the Precision Pressure Pump**  
With its 20-bar pressure pump and pre-soaked coffee grounds function, I genuinely felt the espresso was brewed with precision. The low-pressure moistening of the coffee powder before high-pressure extraction made for a smoother shot with less acidity. I experimented with both single and double shots, and it delivered a balanced, rich taste every time. That said, the pump can get quite noisy during operation, something to keep in mind if you‚Äôre an early riser in a shared space.

**[Check CHULUX Kompatto JH-C5010 price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b0cpj2xtxf/)**  

**Powerful Milk Frother and Steam Wand**  
The milk frothing wand is a dream for anyone who enjoys creating caf√©-style drinks at home. I tested it out with almond milk, whole milk, and even oat milk, and it produced silky microfoam perfect for lattes and cappuccinos. The steamer doubles as a hot water spout, which is handy for making an Americano or a quick instant oatmeal breakfast. On the downside, after frothing milk, the machine requires a cooling period, indicated by a flashing light. While not a deal-breaker, it‚Äôs a slight inconvenience if you‚Äôre in a hurry.

**Heat Management and PID Technology**  
Temperature control is critical in brewing espresso, and the built-in PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) system truly excels. It keeps the water temperature consistently between 170¬∞F to 185¬∞F, and the preheating time is only 30 seconds. I found the warming plate on top a nice touch for preheating cups, although the heat emitted could have been a little more intense to thoroughly warm my larger mugs.

**Good Aspects**  
- Compact and stylish stainless steel design suitable for any kitchen size  
- 20-bar high-pressure pump for rich, flavorful espresso  
- Multi-functional steam wand for frothing milk and dispensing hot water  
- Quick heating system with temperature precision  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The 40oz removable water tank could be larger for entertaining multiple guests  
- The machine gets loud during operation  
- Cooling period after using the steam wand feels slightly inconvenient  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this product to others in its class, such as De'Longhi and Breville espresso machines, the differences became clear. While the CHULUX Kompatto excels in size and affordability, De'Longhi offers slightly quieter operation and a heftier build. Breville machines often come with a bigger water tank and more customizable features, though they‚Äôre bulkier and priced higher. If counter space is a major concern, the CHULUX trumps most alternatives simply due to its slim design, although it sacrifices a bit in terms of the tank capacity and advanced programmability.

**Value for Money**  
The balance of affordability and functionality makes this machine a smart choice for casual coffee enthusiasts and beginners seeking barista-quality drinks at home. While it might not satisfy the needs of a high-volume coffee creator, it‚Äôs perfect for daily at-home use or smaller households. In its price range, the machine delivers a lot‚Äîincluding features like temperature control, milk frothing, and a sleek design‚Äîthat could easily cost more in competing models. For anyone thinking of dipping their toes into espresso brewing without breaking the bank, this one‚Äôs worth a shot.

1mcgsxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ryantrahan/comments/1mcgsxv/thank_you_ryan_haley_for_everything_this_summer/,"Thank You, Ryan & Haley for everything this summer.","Fifty states. Fifty days. A simple premise for an undertaking of monumental heart. It was never just about the lines on a map or the welcome signs at the border. From the first mile leaving Texas, this was a pilgrimage fueled by coffee, chaos, and a cause that dwarfed even the grandest American landscapes.

Perhaps this journey resonated so deeply because it came at the right time. In a moment where headlines often speak of division, you gave America a different kind of story. A story of two people crossing state lines not to highlight differences, but to build a bridge of common purpose, reminding us of the vast, shared goodness that connects us all.

We watched you navigate the country, but also the unpredictable currents of this challenge. And in an era of curated perfection, you gave us something refreshingly real. You are not the shallow, hollow 'influencers' of the digital age; you are simply Ryan and Haley. The quiet moments in the car, the shared laughter over a makeshift cake, the unvarnished exhaustion giving way to the adrenaline of a new sunrise‚Äîthis was authenticity in motion.

Their connection with us wasn't built on a polished image. It was built on the quirks and imperfections that made them so wonderfully human. They didn't edit out the tired sighs, the goofy jokes, or the moments of vulnerability. In doing so, they reminded us that you don't have to be perfect to make a perfect impact. They were just regular people, and that's what made their extraordinary journey feel so close to our own hearts.

Through it all, the number that mattered most wasn't the day count or the mileage, but the ever-climbing total for St. Jude. You turned a road trip into a lifeline. With every spin of the ""Wheel of Doom,"" you embraced uncertainty, yet your mission never wavered. Every dollar raised, every message read aloud, was a promise kept to families you may never meet, a defiant stand for hope.

And that hope was echoed by countless others. This wasn't just your journey; it became a national movement of generosity. To every person who donated their coffee money and every business that contributed thousands‚Äîthis wasn't about sponsorships or marketing. It was a powerful, collective statement that what you were doing was real, that it mattered, and that helping children in need is a cause that transcends everything else.

You invited us all along for the ride. We became a community united by inside jokes, the thrill of a massive donation, and the daily rituals we came to love‚Äîthe morning runs, the e-bike adventures, and the well-earned ""jammy time."" You showed us that a journey is not just about where you go, but what you carry with you. And you carried us all.

So thank you, Ryan and Haley. You were the right people, with the right hearts, at the right time. Thank you for reminding us that the greatest adventures are those in service to others. You didn't just visit 50 states; you revealed the boundless heart of a nation, one act of kindness at a time. You've left a trail not of miles, but of pure, inspiring good.",18,1753808085.0,ryantrahan,0,0.95,False

1mcgql2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGaybrosOver30/comments/1mcgql2/narcissistic_ex/,Narcissistic Ex,"My ex, 47m, is a narcissistic abuser who has been going around claiming to be a narcissistic abuse survivor. The start of the relationship was alright. The first 2 months were great, in fact. He made me feel special, seen, and safe. He knew I was finishing my BSN, and going through an amicable divorce (my ex husband and I were still best friends), he also knew that the nursing specialty I wanted to get into was slightly more difficult for men (Obstetrical Nursing), so I‚Äôd have to get in wherever I could. My initial plan was to stay in the house I had purchased with my ex husband (we functioned really well as roomies) until graduating from college, and then move into my own place in Long Beach. 47m convinced (or more like coerced) me to move in with him in West Hollywood after almost 3 months. He told me it would be cheaper, and when finances weren‚Äôt convincing me, he stated ‚ÄúWell Long Beach is long distance for me, and I will never date anyone that far from me ever again, so we‚Äôll have to break up, because I simply won‚Äôt do it.‚Äù After I moved in with him, everything changed. He told me it was a stupid idea to walk for my graduation (this was my first graduation I got to celebrate‚Ä¶ I was supporting myself in HS, so I didn‚Äôt walk‚Ä¶ I went to work), he said it was a waste of time and money to attend the Native American cultural graduation ceremony (I‚Äôm half Choctaw of Oklahoma & I was VP of the American Indian Student Council). The only graduation ceremony he didn‚Äôt blatantly talk shit about was the School of Nursing graduation ceremony (he is also a nurse). And then we went out to celebrate. He talked shit about all the places I wanted to go to, he did a photo shoot with some of his IG followers who spotted him at one of the places we went to (didn‚Äôt even mention why he was out to his followers or invite me to be in the pics with him). By the end of the evening, the places we went to were only places that he wanted. And he ignored me to talk and flirt with his IG followers (like sorry, but it was my first graduation I ever got to celebrate & his IG followers took precedence). Then, every time we went out, he‚Äôd allow people to shame my body, rub on him, and even lick his body right in front of me, and when I‚Äôd tell him that I didn‚Äôt appreciate it, he‚Äôd tell me about how I was being ‚Äútoxic‚Äù in my monogamy. He even stopped posting pictures with me unless I was in on a group shot, because he didn‚Äôt want his social media to be all about his relationship. He told me to stop commenting compliments on his postings, and to stop liking his posts, because I was coming off as one of his ‚Äúpathetic fans.‚Äù He even made me take down a picture I had posted on my page of the two of us kissing, because it was embarrassing to him. It was at one of his friend‚Äôs birthday parties that I hit my breaking point. I was very drunk. And one of his friends decided to lick his nipples. I publicly lost my shit and shoved 47m to the ground. And then I proceeded to harm myself, because the internal conflict with my character and my action was so overwhelmingly disturbing, I didn‚Äôt know how to even begin to process. I have scars on my forehead and legs from that day. Of course, he was the victim after that‚Ä¶ ultimately, reactive abuse is STILL abuse. After that, I went into therapy, started working a program, and went fully sober for a year. Nov ‚Äò23 rolls around, and 47m acknowledges that how he was treating me after the shoving event was wrong (him prioritizing his followers got significantly worse, and I couldn‚Äôt speak my mind to my friends, because he‚Äôd go through my phone and fight with me about things I‚Äôd say to my friends‚Ä¶ he‚Äôd also started posting X rated thirst traps on X which I didn‚Äôt even know he had at the time, and only send them to me if he didn‚Äôt get enough attention on social media from it). After I found out about the X profile, I decided to intentionally hurt him so that he‚Äôd feel as insecure as he had been making me feel. So, I reached out to someone I had a history with, no intention of sex and I made that clear, but I did downplay the seriousness of my relationship and allowed the guy to talk shit about 47m‚Äôs looks. I knew 47m was regularly going through my phone, so to trigger an investigation, I told him I was going to go for coffee with a friend of over 10 years I had never told him about. This was definitely when the relationship should‚Äôve ended, but it didn‚Äôt. When we‚Äôd fight, he‚Äôd tell me to leave, so I‚Äôd pack my shit‚Ä¶ which wasn‚Äôt very difficult, as he never made space for me to move my things out of my suitcases. So then, we took a trip. He offered to pay for the party tickets and hotel, and in exchange I handled food and drinks. I spent $900 in food and drinks‚Ä¶ after the trip, he said I owed him an additional $800 for tickets and hotel. And the debt buildup got started. It got so bad, that my debt repayment took up most of my paycheck, so after rent groceries and laundry (I was the only one to regularly buy groceries and do laundry at the laundromat), I had maybe $50 for me. So credit cards were used to keep up with his going out requirements. So then he started threatening me with being thrown out every time we‚Äôd fight cuz he knew I couldn‚Äôt afford life on my own with all the debt repayment. Then I had a medical emergency (14 k I had to put on my credit card cuz yay United Healthcare), the entire time at the ER, I was a burden and I wasn‚Äôt worth him losing sleep. Then, guys started noticing me for my body, and 47m started setting boundaries for the relationship which I had to follow. The minute I tried to hold him accountable to the same boundaries, he‚Äôd attempt self harm. The minute I‚Äôd tell him the truth of how his treatment was negatively impacting me, he‚Äôd say ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm a monster‚Äù and attempt to self harm. He did this so many times, I got to the point where I‚Äôd just slap the pills out of his mouth or hands. He refused to seek help, and he‚Äôd tell his therapist about how I was making him want to do that to himself. Then we went to Mexico. He decided to open the relationship to 3 ways. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to fully enjoy the experience. Every time I did, I wasn‚Äôt giving him enough attention, but he was allowed to fully ignore me while he was doing his thing. Originally the 3 ways were only supposed be in Mexico, and the apps (we had shared accounts) were supposed to be deleted. He never deleted the apps, and after returning home, he‚Äôd say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to bed‚Äù only to see him having intimacy building conversations with the guys who were more his type than me until 3-4 AM‚Ä¶ he was really into twinks and twunks because they‚Äôre easier to dominate, and I am too big for him to actually overpower. He even would have those conversations while he and I would be out on dinner dates. And more and more notably, he stopped seeking sex and intimacy with me, and was seeking intimacy with guys on the apps and his social media. The entire time he was still snooping on my phone and he‚Äôd weaponize conversations I had and nit pick words in order to have increasing issues with how I interacted with others as our relationship was more open for non-monogamy, and each time I held him to the same standard, he‚Äôd use self harm actions and threats to make me stop. There were times when I‚Äôd have to call off work because he‚Äôd say veiled threats of self harm, or his behaviors would indicate that he was spiraling. There were times I had to fake being sick at work so they‚Äôd send me home early, because he‚Äôd blow my phone up with threats of self harm. These instances happened so frequently, that I got written up twice at work due to frequent call outs and having to leave work early. Then, it came to pass, that every time he sent me flowers, he‚Äôd blow my phone up to verbally abuse me at work. It was so bad, that when I‚Äôve received flowers since the relationship ending, I get a slight panic response. The snooping got worse (mind you, since the Nov ‚Äò23 incident, I told him that he could go through my phone whenever he wanted, he just had to ask me for my phone and go through it in front of me‚Ä¶ it was part of me making ammends and holding myself accountable for a moment of shit behavior). However, the snooping behind my back got so bad, he‚Äôd even weaponize conversations I had with my own mother. So, I told him that if the relationship is to continue, it would have to be fully open, no rules. Because I was tired of him setting up double standards as our rules and boundaries, and no more snooping, and any more self harm would end the relationship immediately: I‚Äôd ensure his safety, get him into a hospital for a hold, leave, and live my life as though I never met him. Fast forward for another 6 months of dysfunction, he makes an unfair request of me, which I obliged, and I stopped chatting with everyone (including platonic conversations with ppl he didn‚Äôt approve), but he snooped on my phone, and he saw I had an illicit picture of myself and a video of me pleasuring myself which I hadn‚Äôt sent to anyone, and that I had gone on a hike with a platonic friend, so he dumped me, because he simply couldn‚Äôt trust me. He then proceeded to tell me that as a newly single person, I couldn‚Äôt stay on the apps, I couldn‚Äôt go out, I couldn‚Äôt kiss different guys, etc, because I was living in his place (the place where I paid half the bills and slept on the couch). I did not oblige his demands. So then he verbally abused me, and one day, I had had it and told him to delete everything he had of me, I blocked his number, and went to the gym. He sent me an email threatening self harm. I called the police, got to the apartment, found him seizing after an attempted OD. He stopped breathing. I did rescue breaths until he started breathing again, and the police arrived. By the time he returned home from the hospital, I had moved out. There was a hole in the wall from one of his attempts‚Ä¶ he went through the wall when I had to disarm him because he had pulled a kitchen knife on me and attempted to stab me so that I couldn‚Äôt stop him from harming himself‚Ä¶ I had bought the supplies to repair the wall, but did not repair the wall cuz I did not have money to buy the tools. I did offer to do the repair with him not in the apartment and with his friend who had the tools to be there. He declined and tried to demand I pay him for the repair. Fast forward a few months, and he‚Äôs off and on harassing me, calling me every name under the sun, calling me evil because of a trauma I survived when I was deployed in combat, etc. I meet someone and start dating, and all of a sudden, I‚Äôm a narcissistic abuser. That man put me through psychological abuse. I couldn‚Äôt speak about my feelings without him calling himself a monster and attempt to harm himself. I couldn‚Äôt hold him to the same standard he held me to without him attempting to harm himself. I couldn‚Äôt speak to my own friends or attempt to form new friendships without him weaponizing everything and accusing me of cheating. Upon dumping me, he immediately turned to defaming my character to his friends, some of whom I had become close to. And then, after all he put me through, to see him referring to me as a narcissistic abuser and himself as my victim‚Ä¶ it is mind boggling. He literally has had me questioning my sanity this whole time. I mean, I know I was definitely a contributing force in the toxicity of the relationship, but I definitely would not say that I was the narcissist‚Ä¶ I just put a narcissist through the ringer with significant reactive abuse.

Age: 29M
Height: 186cm
Weight: 127kgs

I have been struggling with weight all my life. Got a break when I reduced 20kgs around 8 years ago from 115. But got it all back and more right now mainly due to my diet and lifestyle with minimal exercise and high tension job.

I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism 6 years ago and started with 60mcg every day, now at 100mcg daily.
Last year around feb, I had to undergo discectomy for a bad L4/L5 disc bulge, which kept me mostly on bed 2 months before and 1-2 months after. - Responsible for my current weight.

Cut to this year. At the start of the year, I tested my lipid panel and found LDL to be in 152. I tried changing some lifestyle and wanted to exercise but failed eventually due to ignorance. But ensured I do not overeat or eat junk foods a lot.

Now the LDL is at 181, the doc recommends to start taking statin right now and mentioned that I would need to take it for lifetime even if the LDL corrects itself. According to the report, overall cholesterol is within limits while LDL is high and HDL is at 37 (3 units less than normal), which is where I‚Äôm lost.

While I have a sedentary lifestyle, my dairy intake is not there - No coffee or tea. Used to use ghee during lunch and dinner but I‚Äôve started limiting it a lot.

Any suggestions on what I can? Should I start on statin asap ? Or try a rigid change of lifestyle?  - I‚Äôm also trying to get a second opinion as well.",1,1753807824.0,Cholesterol,0,1.0,False

Even with a new gasket on the brew group, I hate that when dialing in I get some blowouts from the brew group; I guess that the portafilter fit cannot handle the pressure.

Also, specially with the current roast which was pretty much beans to cup, I left it pretty light, and hand grinding has become a chore, so I want an espresso capable grinder to take some of the effort from making coffee, and a machine that can give me a decent shot. I have an older Breville model that has been running for over 7 years, but was never meant to be used with unpressurized baskets.

Things that I want from the grinder, stepless adjustment, sub 200 USD, and likelihood of working over a couple of years without giving out.

Things that I want from the machine, 9 bar opv, and mostly constructed well. I think that the Gaggia from the three I mentioned is built like a tank, but lacks some temp stability, and I am not sure if the OPV is set at 9, but that seems like something I could easily achieve. on the other hand the H10B has some temp control, but It looks and feels cheap even on video if that makes sense, but the price is so low that if it gives me a year, I would not be disappointed, and last the Turin which comes with all the things I may want on a brewer right now, but I would be surprised if it works for 5 years of daily use.

I am mainly on this predicament because I was watching some videos of how to install a PID on a Gaggia, and it was a bit intimidating.

Thanks in advance for your time and recommendations.

The 200 limit on the grinder is mostly due to taxes, as I would have to pay around 35 percent on anything over that price. I am willing to do so on the machine because the machines under that price are extremely basic or low quality like the H10B while on the grinders side, the SK40 at the least looks like it can take a beating.

**Number and type of Outlets:** An under cabinet power strip should offer a sufficient number of outlets to accommodate your needs. Look for models with a mix of standard AC outlets and USB charging ports.

The number of AC outlets determines how many appliances or devices can be simultaneously powered. Two to four AC outlets are common, but larger units might provide more. Furthermore,consider the orientation of the outlets. Right-angled or rotated outlets are often preferable as they allow for plugs of different sizes to be used without blocking adjacent outlets. The inclusion of USB ports, both standard USB-A and the faster USB-C, is crucial for charging smartphones, tablets, and othre accessories directly, eliminating the need for bulky adapters.

**USB Charging Capabilities:** The availability and type of USB ports significantly impact the convenience and efficiency of charging mobile devices.

USB charging ports have become increasingly importent in modern power strips. The presence of USB-A ports allows for charging older devices, while USB-C ports provide faster charging speeds for newer smartphones and tablets. Check the amperage output of the USB ports; higher amperage means faster charging. Many advanced models incorporate smart charging technology that automatically detects the connected device and delivers the optimal charging current, preventing overcharging and extending battery life.

**Safety Features:** Safety is paramount when dealing with electrical devices, and under cabinet power strips should incorporate multiple safety mechanisms.

Overload protection is a critical safety feature that prevents the power strip from exceeding its maximum power capacity. When the load exceeds the limit,the power strip will automatically shut off,preventing damage to connected devices and reducing the risk of fire. Surge protection safeguards against voltage spikes caused by lightning or power surges, protecting sensitive electronics from damage.Additionally, look for power strips that are UL-listed or ETL-certified, indicating that they have been tested and meet safety standards.

**Installation Method:** The ease and flexibility of installation are critically important factors, depending on your DIY skills and the configuration of your cabinets.

Most under cabinet power strips are designed for easy installation using screws or adhesive mounting strips. Screw-mounted units provide a more secure and permanent installation, while adhesive strips offer a quick and drill-free option. consider the length of the mounting hardware and the thickness of your cabinet to ensure a proper fit. Some models also feature a detachable design, allowing for easy removal for cleaning or maintenance.

**Build Quality and Design:** Robust construction and a sleek design are essential for both durability and aesthetics.

the materials used in the construction of the power strip should be of high quality to ensure longevity and withstand daily use. Look for models made from flame-retardant materials to enhance safety. A slim and unobtrusive design is crucial to seamlessly integrate the power strip under the cabinet without detracting from the overall aesthetic. Many under cabinet power strips are available in different finishes, such as white, black, or brushed aluminum, to match your cabinet hardware and decor.

If I‚Äôm honest I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm writing this. Maybe it‚Äôs just to get things off my chest, to process something that I still can‚Äôt believe happened. It doesn‚Äôt matter to me if you believe me. Heck, I still don‚Äôt believe me.¬†

I guess I should start by explaining that I‚Äôm a writer, of sorts at least. Probably nothing that you‚Äôve read unless you like reading paranormal research. I tried to write stories for a while, but people didn‚Äôt seem to be as interested in fantasy as they used to be. Anyway, since selling my own stories didn‚Äôt work, I managed to find a podcast that wanted help researching local legends, cryptid encounters, ghost sightings, the whole nine yards. Have you ever heard the expression that truth is stranger than fiction? I never believed it until I started listening to people‚Äôs stories. I mean, some of them were obviously hoaxes, but others rang true. Just look at all of the stories people tell about bigfoot, or about ghosts. If even one of them is true‚Ä¶ well, if even one of them is true then most of us will have to start looking at reality in a whole new light.¬†

New England is an odd place and is no stranger to odd things. It is steeped in history and legend, though you wouldn‚Äôt know it by talking to the locals. You really have to dig to find the personal stories, and even then, if people don‚Äôt already know and trust you, you still might end up running into walls. People don‚Äôt often talk about the strange things that happen here, but if you are lucky enough to loosen some tongues, you might find out why Lovecraft based most of his stories here.

Have you ever heard the story of Betty and Barney Hill? They were among the first modern alien abductees, at least according to their story, and it happened right here where I live in New Hampshire. Ever since then, the people here have been having encounters with strange things in the sky, the woods, even the water. The stories didn‚Äôt start with Betty and Barney either. Even the Native American tribes have legends of odd things dating back to their creation myths.

I had a contact near the Connecticut River, not too far from the Hill abduction site. He‚Äôd been hinting for months that he had a story to tell, and he‚Äôd finally agreed to meet with me to tell me the story face to face. It was a rainy night and I was still new to the area. The town wasn‚Äôt far from Hanover, home to the Ivy League halls of Dartmouth College, and I had expected a more urban area, but the deeper I went into the New Hampshire hills, the darker the woods became. Rain sheeted down and before long I had slowed to a crawl, struggling to see through the dark and damp.

Light flashed and I yelled as a massive pine fell with a crash that seemed to bounce my old car‚Äôs wheels right off of the ground. I slammed the brakes, sending the car into a spin as it hit the thick branches. Glass shattered and I felt a sting on the side of my face as the seatbelt jarred my shoulder. In the same instant there was a bang and the airbag hit me full force. I blacked out for a moment or two and then began to fade in and out of consciousness. Rain pelted on my face and then there were cool hands on my arms and eyes that faded in and out of my vision, silvery golden eyes that shimmered and glowed in the dark. A door opened in the dark, spilling light out into the night, but the light was cold and as white as bone.

‚ÄúThere now,‚Äù said a voice as I was pulled inside. The bright light faded until only the eyes were left. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this better?‚Äù

I sat up with a jolt, looking around the strange room in shock.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù exclaimed the voice that sounded like music. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awake.‚Äù

A youngish woman set her book aside and left her chair to hover over the couch and rest a hand on my forehead. ‚ÄúHow do you feel? You took quite a bump to the head.‚Äù

‚ÄúI uh‚Ä¶‚Äù I stopped, swallowing nervously as she pushed me gently back to the cushions. ‚ÄúWh‚Ä¶ what happened?‚Äù

Her grey eyes narrowed and she cocked her head. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt remember?‚Äù

I tried not to star as she stood back up and returned to her seat, her long, raven hair drifting around her shoulders.

‚ÄúI remember the tree falling and not much else,‚Äù I said quickly. ‚ÄúHow did you even get me up here?‚Äù

The girl raised her slender arms, flexing the muscles beneath her red blouse with a wink. ‚ÄúWhat? You don‚Äôt think I could have gotten you up here alone?‚Äù She laughed. ‚ÄúMy butler carried you up here for me. You‚Äôre lucky we saw you pass by, otherwise you might still be stuck in your car.‚Äù

I groaned and covered my face with my hands. ‚ÄúThanks. I don‚Äôt think there are many people who would invite a stranger in like this.‚Äù

The girl raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWell, you aren‚Äôt a murderer are you, Mr. Hale?‚Äù

I sputtered for a moment. ‚ÄúWhat? No, I‚Äôm just a writer! I wouldn‚Äôt hurt anyone.‚Äù I stopped, staring at my odd host. ‚ÄúHow did you know my name?‚Äù

‚ÄúI found your wallet,‚Äù she replied. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs with your clothes in the laundry room.‚Äù

My eyes widened as I suddenly realized that I was dressed in someone else‚Äôs clothes, a simple t-shirt and soft pants that were at least a size too large.¬†

‚ÄúI had you dressed in my late husband‚Äôs clothes,‚Äù she explained, seemingly amused at my discomfort. You‚Äôre lucky we have generators here, or your clothes would still be sopping went in the kitchen sink.‚Äù Her musical laugh rang out as she flashed a slight smile. ‚ÄúAs much as I might dream about living in a castle, I‚Äôd be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt fond of modern conveniences.‚Äù¬†

¬†I pulled the blanket that I‚Äôd been given over myself, unnerved by the idea of being dressed and undressed at the behest of this strange woman, butler or no. It didn‚Äôt help that she was one of the most beautiful creatures that I‚Äôd ever seen, with perfect, milky skin, dark hair and grey eyes that almost seemed to match the room‚Äôs wallpaper. I groaned as the motion of pulling the blanket to my chin made my head throb, a sudden and severe reminder that I‚Äôd been in an accident.¬†

‚ÄúThanks again for pulling me out,‚Äù I said, suddenly feeling very tired and dizzy. ‚ÄúDid you already call an ambulance?‚Äù

She was at my side in an instant, her cool, almost cold fingers soothing the ache in my skull. ‚ÄúMy butler is quite good at first aid,‚Äù she said gently. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a concussion, but you are quite badly bruised. Even if the phone lines were working, I‚Äôm afraid nothing would make it out here until the storm passes and the roads are cleared.‚Äù

Rain tapped loudly on the window panes as she went to the door, dimming the room lights as she went. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll sleep in peace here tonight.‚Äù

It was as if her words were a drug, injected directly into the vein. The last thing I saw before falling into slumber was a final flash of her eyes.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù I asked as my eyes closed.

‚ÄúEliza. Eliza Bates. Sleep now Mr. Hale.‚Äù

¬†

\* \* \*

¬†

When I woke up it was still raining. The thunder of a downpour had ended, replaced by a steady pitter pat against the roof and the window pane. Someone, the butler I supposed, had left a small table with a covered plate and a thermos that smelled like fresh coffee. In the sunlight I could see the room, little more than a sitting room really. The couch I was on, Eliza‚Äôs chair, and an oversized writing desk in the corner were the only pieces of furniture and there were bookcases covering every empty space on the wall. I climbed unsteadily to my feet and went to the window, pulling aside the curtain. To my surprise the road wasn‚Äôt far away, less than a hundred yards from the house. I could even see my car, somehow pulled to the side of the road and out of the way of any road work vehicles.¬†

As I turned away from the window I bumped my knee on a table and stifled a yell of pain as an old picture fell to the floor.¬†

‚ÄúStupid table,‚Äù I grumbled as I picked it up.¬† The glass shifted and the faded photo slipped out, fluttering as it landed back on the floor. I rolled my eyes and snatched it back up. ‚ÄúStupid picture. Stupid knees always getting in the way.‚Äù

Handwritten letters on the back of the old picture caught my eye and I stopped, reading out loud to myself.

‚ÄúIt is strange to write in English,‚Äù it read in an attractive hand. ‚ÄúBut as an American I suppose I must get used to it. Saying goodbye to my name and my home is hard, but Elizabeth Bathory is already long dead and her home is a ruin. Eliza Bates‚Ä¶ maybe it is a name I could get used to.‚Äù

I blinked and looked at the picture, an ancient photo of a woman standing at Staten Island.¬†

‚ÄúElizabeth Bathory,‚Äù I muttered, wondering why the name seemed so familiar and why the woman in the picture looked like my host. ‚ÄúWow‚Ä¶ Eliza, you aged well.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ you found my grandmother‚Äôs¬† immigration picture did you?‚Äù

I yelped and nearly dropped the picture. Eliza chuckled and took it from me, expertly placing it back in the frame.

‚ÄúSurprised at the resemblance?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a family curse I suppose‚Ä¶ we all look like our mothers.‚Äù She stared at the picture with what might have been fondness. ‚ÄúHer butler took this picture on the day she arrived from Hungary. He was my Hubert‚Äôs grandfather actually, interestingly enough.‚Äù

‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôve heard that name before,‚Äù I said as I went back to the couch. ‚ÄúElizabeth Bathory.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an old Hungarian name,‚Äù she said. She cocked her head curiously. ‚ÄúYou said you‚Äôre a writer, I thought for sure you‚Äôd know it.‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúAlways been better with faces than names I guess.‚Äù

Her eyes twinkled and she perched on the end of the couch. ‚ÄúI see. Elizabeth was the most prolific female serial killer the world has ever known.‚Äù My shock must have shown on my face because she chuckled and continued. ‚ÄúAccording to the legends at least. They really run the gamut, from Elizabeth being a killer, to being a literal vampire, all the way to being an innocent woman that got caught up in political power schemes of the time.‚Äù

‚ÄúWh‚Ä¶ what do you believe?‚Äù

Eliza shrugged. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Maybe a bit of everything‚Ä¶ people have a tendency to think that women can‚Äôt be evil, but I know my own heart better than anyone else, and I know what I could do if I chose to.‚Äù¬†

A chill went through my heart then, but was lessened when she chuckled again, giving me a wink.

‚ÄúOh don‚Äôt worry,‚Äù she said quickly. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a retelling of Misery, never fear.‚Äù

She got up and replaced the picture on the end table, before running her fingers along a nearby stack of books as if looking for something. ‚ÄúMy line isn‚Äôt exactly legitimate‚Ä¶ but somewhere through the history we took the name Bathory back. A matter of some pride I suppose.‚Äù Her face twisted into a grimace. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, there was still a stigma attached to the name, so when grandmother came here, she changed it.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo Bates?‚Äù I asked, still puzzled by the conversation‚Äôs unexpected turn. ‚ÄúBut I thought you said you were married.‚Äù

She waved her hand dismissively. ‚ÄúWe are royals, we Bates‚Äôs, legitimate or not. If a man doesn‚Äôt want to take our royal name, we don‚Äôt marry them.‚Äù She snorted again, someone bitterly. ‚ÄúNot that it matters much now. My husband died before we could pass the name to a new generation.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. How long ago did‚Ä¶.‚Äù

‚ÄúLong enough I suppose,‚Äù she answered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to go out again‚Ä¶ to find someone again I guess, but it‚Äôs always hard to leave this house. I‚Äôve lived here for so long now I can‚Äôt seem to bring myself to leave.‚Äù

She found the book she was looking for and pulled it out with a triumphant flair. ‚ÄúAh. Beauty and the Beast. It‚Äôs my favorite story‚Ä¶ the original version and the modern version I suppose.‚Äù She flipped through the pages. ‚ÄúThis house is my castle, but I‚Äôve no kiss to give or to get.‚Äù

A strange feeling settled in the pit of my stomach as Eliza shook herself and turned away. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll leave you to your breakfast. Is there anything you need brought to the room? I‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt have a Tv or a computer, but you are welcome to read anything in my collection.‚Äù

I hesitated, suddenly wondering if I was being confined to the room. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ actually, I‚Äôd like to go check on my car. Maybe I can get it running and get out of your way.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not in my way Mr. Hale,‚Äù Eliza said easily, her hand on the door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have Hubert check the roads. More trees fell while you were asleep so they may not be safe. I‚Äôll also have him bring up something for you to write with while I prepare for lunch.‚Äù She started to leave and then hesitated. ‚ÄúFeel free to explore Mr. Hale, but I must warn you that some doors are locked. This is a strange old mansion, and some things are better left hidden. There is a larger library down on the first floor to the left of the kitchen if you would like to see it.‚Äù Her smile grew wide and warm. ‚ÄúBut first eat your breakfast. I wouldn‚Äôt want a guest of mine to go hungry.‚Äù

When she was gone, I sighed and settled down on the couch. It was a comfortable couch, more comfortable than mine at least, and I began to pick over the food. The uncomfortable feeling had vanished with Eliza‚Äôs invitation to explore, and I began to wonder if I could pick her brain for ideas on stories. Maybe she would even be willing to do an interview for the podcast. A direct descendant of one of the most infamous women in history would be a spectacular interview.¬†

The food was good, a mild sausage link and beautifully scrambled eggs, but I wasn‚Äôt hungry, so I packed up the tray and left, taking several deep drinks of the coffee as I went. My room opened into a narrow hall, a classic old mansion‚Äôs hall, lined with pictures and ornate tables with vases of colorful flowers or other expensive looking knick-knacks. The hall led to a balcony over a great living room with a wide staircase that followed the wall. Steps creaked slightly under my feet and I tensed, feeling almost like I was in a museum. I saw Eliza through an open door next to another hallway, bustling this way and that around a kitchen that looked like it belonged in the 1950s. Today she was dressed in a simple black skirt and blouse, with a white apron with blue stripes tied around her waist.¬†

‚ÄúHello Mr. Hale,‚Äù she said without turning around. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you hungry?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, not really,‚Äù I said as I stepped inside the kitchen. ‚ÄúMy head still hurts a bit actually.‚Äù

Eliza ushered me to a seat at a small table before taking the tray and placing it in the sink. Cupboards rattled as she filled a glass with tap water, adding dashes of herbs from several jars set above the stove.

‚ÄúHere, drink this,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAn old family recipe‚Ä¶ it does wonders for aches and pains of all sorts. Even better than medicine.‚Äù¬†

The herbed water was pungent and left a strange, dry taste on my tongue, but it was cool, and I could almost imagine the pain draining down out of my head as I drank.¬†

She grinned. ‚ÄúSee? Now what can I do for you Mr. Hale?‚Äù

‚ÄúI actually wondered if you could help me with some research,‚Äù I answered slowly. ‚ÄúI help write and research for a podcast that covers interesting history, and things like that. Do you think you would be willing to do an interview?‚Äù Her eyebrows drew together and I raised my hands. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt want to that‚Äôs fine, but I think it would be great to get a story about someone like Elizabeth Bathory from a direct descendant, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù

Eliza thought for a long moment. ‚ÄúA podcast is a radio show, right? I wouldn‚Äôt have to be on a camera?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo cameras,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúYou could even call the show from here.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe I should‚Ä¶‚Äù she said slowly as she returned to her work, chopping and assembling various fruits into a pastry crust. ‚ÄúIt would be good to get out of the house. Heaven knows I‚Äôve been here long enough.‚Äù She glanced my way. ‚ÄúIs this all you write Mr. Hale? History and mystery?‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúI tried to write novels‚Ä¶ finished several actually, but I couldn‚Äôt get them to sell. I got lucky when I found the podcast. Now I get to do some of my favorite things. Learn and write, and I get to do it for a job.‚Äù

Her eyes twinkled. ‚ÄúI like you Mr. Hale. I was beginning to think that people have lost the taste for learning.‚Äù

‚ÄúI love to learn. My mom used to tell me that I knew a lot of random crap about a lot of random crap, but I always thought it was interesting. History is my favorite, but I like science, psychology, philosophy‚Ä¶ basically anything that sparks an interest.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou sound like my Hubert,‚Äù Eliza said without turning around. ‚ÄúHe is a jack of all trades and a master of several.‚Äù She chuckled. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I could stand around people who didn‚Äôt have a thirst for knowledge. Tell me, do you speak any languages other than English?‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúI wish I could, but I can‚Äôt. I tried to learn Spanish in school, but I couldn‚Äôt roll my r‚Äôs and kept getting in trouble with the teacher. I might have a knack for the written word, but something doesn‚Äôt work when it comes to other languages. Kind of like the problems I have with math.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should spend some time abroad,‚Äù she said easily. ‚ÄúBeing immersed in a language is the best way to learn after all. Besides, I think you would like my homeland. There is an incredible amount of history in those mountains and forests.‚Äù She finished her work and covered the pastry with a cloth before sitting down across from me, folding her hands demurely on her lap. ‚ÄúI spent time in my family‚Äôs old lands in my youth. I‚Äôll wager you could get enough material to drive your podcast for months.‚Äù¬†

I nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been interested in European folklore, but most of our listeners are from the Americas, so we usually collect local stories. I‚Äôve been trying to get the guys to branch out though, so who knows.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not make your own podcast then?‚Äù

It was a question that I‚Äôd been asked before and I stared down at my lap with a shrug. ‚ÄúEh, I don‚Äôt know. I like to write and to study, but I don‚Äôt like talking all that much. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm interesting enough to be a host, honestly.‚Äù

‚ÄúI doubt that.‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou seem quite fascinating. So, what local legends brought you to this place?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ well, I have a friend who had some kind of encounter up here,‚Äù I answered slowly. ‚ÄúI was talking to him about the Betty and Barney Hill incident, and he started saying that he knew what it was like to have a story that people didn‚Äôt believe.‚Äù

‚ÄúBetty and Barney Hill?‚Äù Eliza asked. ‚ÄúThe alien abductees?‚Äù She cocked her head. ‚ÄúDo you believe the story? It sounds‚Ä¶ fantastical at the least.‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. There are so many stories that I can‚Äôt believe all of them are fake. I just don‚Äôt know for sure what I think is happening.‚Äù

Eliza tapped her fingers against the tabletop. ‚ÄúYou know, there were stories in my homeland about people being taken, lights in the sky, strange beings with large heads and enormous eyes.‚Äù She paused and chuckled. ‚ÄúThen again we were talking about fairies.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard of that,‚Äù I said, leaning forward. ‚ÄúBut I never really knew what to think of it. It seems like people have been experiencing this sort of thing for as long as there have been people.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù

It was a simple prompt, but one that was hard for me to answer.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been working on a theory,‚Äù I said at last. ‚ÄúOne that explains why all of these weird stories seem to have connections. I‚Äôm not very far along with it, but it almost all seems spiritual in some way. Even the alien stuff.‚Äù

Eliza seemed to want to ask a question but then sighed and grinned. ‚ÄúI guess I never thought of it that way. Or, I never expected to find someone who thinks that way at least. Are there really that many stories here in New Hampshire?‚Äù She gestured out the window at the rain and the woods. ‚ÄúIt seems so quiet here.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThere are a lot of stories here,‚Äù I replied eagerly. ‚ÄúPeople just don‚Äôt talk about them often. Native Americans had stories about wild-men and the colonists here started calling them wood devils, you have some infamous ghost stories, there‚Äôs even a few reported vampire legends not too far away.‚Äù

Her eyes flickered and she went still. ‚ÄúReally? Like what?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, one of the first reported vampires in New England was a student at Dartmouth College not long after it was founded.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI forget his name. I‚Äôd look it up, but I don‚Äôt have a phone that works.‚Äù

Eliza sat back in her chair, almost seeming to relax. ‚ÄúOh, that sounds like when they thought that tuberculosis victims were vampires. That makes me feel a little bit better.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know right? Some of the vampire legends you can find are terrifying. Like down in New Orleans there were some stories that coincided with massive upticks in disappearances. They‚Äôre old stories, but still.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to see someone who takes the supernatural world seriously for a change,‚Äù Eliza said, flashing a wry smile. ‚ÄúIt reminds me of the old country.‚Äù She drummed her fingers against the table again, a quick, hard beat that seemed louder than should have been possible. ‚ÄúTell me, Mr. Hale, what do you know about curses?‚Äù

‚ÄúCurses? I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt really know. I believe that they‚Äôre possible, but I‚Äôve never really studied it. Witchcraft really spooks me, I guess. Why?‚Äù

She hesitated for a long time. ‚ÄúDo you promise to believe me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes of course I‚Äôll believe you.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she said, getting up and beginning to pace nervously. ‚ÄúNo one believed me, but my husband died because we were cursed. And now, if I ever leave this property, the same thing will happen to me.‚Äù

My heart dropped into my stomach. ‚ÄúAre you serious? H... how? What happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Bathory name followed us here,‚Äù Eliza said, her back to me. ‚ÄúI suppose I never wanted to let it go. I just didn‚Äôt expect the shadows to come with me.‚Äù

My heart went from my stomach to my toes. ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt been quite honest,‚Äù Eliza said, still without turning around. ‚ÄúI am Elizabeth Bathory.‚Äù She turned around and nodded.¬†

I yelped as two massive hands landed on my shoulders, pressing me down into my seat.

‚ÄúDear Hubert,‚Äù Eliza, er, Elizabeth crooned. ‚ÄúThank you my dear. Take him downstairs.‚Äù¬†

Hubert spun me around and I had my first look at the butler. He was tall and wide shouldered and might have been handsome if his skin wasn‚Äôt grey and lifeless. Dead, white eyes stared at me from sunken sockets and wrinkled lips twisted in a grimace that might have been a smile as his fingers tightened with unbelievable strength. Elizabeth grinned over his shoulder and her beautiful features faded, becoming skeletal and shrunken. Her eyes went from grey to red and her teeth lengthened jagged points.¬†

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve waited so long for a believer, haven‚Äôt we?‚Äù she said as the butler dragged me helplessly out of the room. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be long now‚Ä¶ soon we will walk free again.‚Äù

I tried to struggle free only to have Hubert cuff me on the side of the head, a closed fist blow that made my legs go slack and my head spin.¬†

‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù I gasped as the dead butler pushed me down a narrow stair to a basement. ‚ÄúWhat are you going to do to me?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe blood of a believer is a powerful thing,‚Äù Elizabeth said, ignoring my frantic questions. ‚ÄúA powerful thing indeed.‚Äù

Candles flickered to life, and I screamed as the shifting shadows pulled back to show moldering skeletons hung by their wrists to the walls. Hubert cuffed me again.

‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù he rumbled, his voice a deep rasp. ‚ÄúNo one can hear you.‚Äù He threw me into a heavy seat, almost a throne made of dark, stained wood. ‚ÄúThe louder you are, the more I‚Äôll make it hurt.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow, now dear,‚Äù whispered Elizabeth as she unpacked a set of sharp instruments from a cupboard. ‚ÄúBe kind to our writing friend.‚Äù She held up a scalpel and moved it in front of my face, barely grazing the skin of my nose. ‚ÄúSurely a teller of stories would like to hear ours.‚Äù

Hubert merely grunted, latching my wrists and ankles with heavy leather straps before retreating to a place behind his master.

‚ÄúIgnore him Mr. Hale,‚Äù she said, wrenching my wrist until the back of my hand was flat on the chair of the arm. A sweet pain jolted up my arm as she flicked the blade over the skin, barely drawing blood. ‚ÄúMy late husband has lost much of his sense of humor over the years.‚Äù

She stared at the tiny red drops on the blade for a long moment before returning to her tools. ‚ÄúPeople called me a monster‚Ä¶ a vampire, a witch or what have you. Now people claim that I am a psychopath.‚Äù

I started to talk, to beg for my life or to scream for help, but she was behind me in a moment, snapping a thick cloth over my mouth. ‚ÄúAs if I was anything so pedestrian as a serial killer or a rotting undead thing.‚Äù

My eyes went from the pale, toothy woman to the mummy like Hubert. Elizabeth rolled her eyes, as if she had heard my thoughts.

‚ÄúI am very much alive Mr. Hale,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSpells of blood and darkness sustain me still, as faded as they have been of late.‚Äù A new tool glittered in her hand, an oddly shaped set of pliers and I shrieked into the gag as she pulled a fingernail from my hand as easily as you could pull a scab. ‚ÄúOnce I escaped my imprisonment I had thought I would live in peace forever.‚Äù

She grinned and licked the bloody nail before throwing it to the floor. Her hand went to Hubert‚Äôs face, and she caressed his cheek fondly. ‚ÄúEventually I found someone like myself and we hunted together until someone found his kills.‚Äù Hubert grunted and she laughed. ‚ÄúNo, no my darling, it was thrilling. Anyway, we fled here and once again, I thought life would be peaceful.‚Äù

Her fingers closed around the blade again and it flickered, this time cutting deeper into my wrist. I winced and bit my tongue, struggling not to scream through the suffocating gag. My eyes widened as I noticed a nick in the leather next to the seeping cut.¬†

‚ÄúBlood sustained us,‚Äù Elizabeth continued, admiring the red stain on the silver blade. ‚ÄúBlood fueled the magic, but eventually people began to notice that girls traveled into these woods and never came back.‚Äù Her red eyes flickered to mine and I saw a hint of disgust, almost hidden by hunger. ‚ÄúWomen are so much sweeter than men after all.‚Äù

At some unseen signal, Hubert snatched goblet from a shelf and placed it on a small sconce below my arm. If I strained my neck I could see drops of my blood spattering on the silver as it trickled down a groove carved into the heavy wood.¬†

‚ÄúSome priest was called to work his white magic here,‚Äù Elizabeth continued, ignoring my pained thrashing as she used a candle to heat the scalpel before pressing the heated blade to the wound where she had ripped a nail free. ‚ÄúHuh, he would have been better to call on the Son of God than the Queen of Heaven, but his curse was done.‚Äù She gestured to a tattered heap of cloth and bones in the corner. ‚ÄúMaybe he would have lived to tell the tale. Now, just any blood won‚Äôt do.‚Äù Pain flared from my other wrist as she neatly opened a vertical cut.¬†

‚ÄúThe blood of a believer,‚Äù she said, echoing and earlier thought as Hubert put a second goblet in place. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be better off if you didn‚Äôt believe in the supernatural Mr. Hale. Perhaps then I wouldn‚Äôt even be able to touch you, to lure or trap you in this tomb of mine.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúI wondered if you might be more than a quick meal,‚Äù she continued, slashing a second line in my arm. ‚ÄúA soul for a soul might just break this curse for me.‚Äù

Hubert stirred behind her. ‚ÄúA soul for a soul Elizabeth? What about me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYour sloppy work got us here!‚Äù she snapped. ‚ÄúWith him one of us might just walk out of here, and I‚Äôll be damned again before I stay behind.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou promised me,‚Äù the big man rumbled, looming over her. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt let you leave me‚Ä¶‚Äù

There was a snapping noise as she plunged her hand into his chest, breaking ribs and tearing dried flesh as she ripped out his dusty heart. Her eyes flashed. ‚ÄúWhat can I say dear Hubert?‚Äù she asked as he fell to his knees, the pale light slowly fading from his eyes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve become boring in your old age.‚Äù

The organ crumbled to dust in her fingers, and she brushed it off, turning to me. She picked up the first goblet, already partially filled with blood. My head was pounding, and I felt more tired than I‚Äôd ever felt before and I could only whimper as she stared at me, sipping my lifeforce like wine.

‚ÄúYou have a choice Mr. Hale,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI was going to let Hubert have a few sips, enough to keep him from turning to dust while I searched for more prey‚Ä¶‚Äù she paused and gestured at the fallen butler. ‚ÄúBut as you can see, I‚Äôm in need of a companion.‚Äù¬†

I only glared at her, deciding that since death was inevitable, I might as well make it defiant.¬†

She cocked her head, a smirk on her face, which had returned to the young beauty that she had displayed at first.¬† ‚ÄúOh? You think that I‚Äôm going to kill you? No. Now I will make you live whether you want to or not.‚Äù The knife in her off hand flickered and cut through the gag, leaving a thin bloody line on my cheek. ‚ÄúYou can walk out of here with me, never to see this dreadful place again, or you can stay here as a thrall, to be tortured for the rest of your life until I decide to end it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy would I join you?‚Äù I gasped, barely able to keep my head up.¬†

Elizabeth Bathory grinned and drew her fingers over the gash in my wrist. The skin rippled and itched and pulled back together. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a little torture among friends, hmm Mr. Hale? I can give you life beyond death, riches enough to travel and do whatever you want.‚Äù She touched my cheek with hands that felt like ice. ‚ÄúThe only cost would be serving me as a fellow huntsman.‚Äù

I pulled away, staring at the bones hanging on the wall. ‚ÄúWhat, help you hunt and murder people so you can drink their blood?‚Äù

‚ÄúDrinking is for special occasions,‚Äù she said as she combined the blood in the goblets, using her fingertip to trace symbols on the chair and my arms. ‚ÄúBaths are so much more invigorating. This is your last chance Mr. Hale‚Ä¶ do you want a future of pain or of pleasure?‚Äù

Blood had soaked my wrist, and I could feel the leather strap slip slightly as I pulled. I mustered all my strength and wrenched my hand free, tearing through the strap until it was hanging by a strand. Elizabeth‚Äôs eyes widened as I snatched the scalpel from her pocket and stabbed at her chest. She staggered back with a gasp, and I cut¬†my other hand free before struggling with the straps wrapped around my ankles. The blade caught on the hem of my pants, tearing a deep gash in my leg as I pulled free and staggered to the stairs. Icy hands grabbed my shoulders and threw me back against the wall.¬†

‚ÄúYou nearly got away,‚Äù Eliza gasped from across the room, her hand extended. Shadows shifted, extending like smoke from her palm as they wrapped around me and held me against the cold stone of the cellar wall, inches away from the faded bones. ‚ÄúHeh, I haven‚Äôt had this much fun in ages.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúScrew you,‚Äù I gasped. ‚ÄúJust kill me and get it over with.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand,‚Äù she hissed as she loomed up in front of me. ‚ÄúYou had your chances‚Ä¶ now I‚Äôm going to change you‚Ä¶ torture you until the pain becomes pleasure and you are happy to hunt. The best of both worlds.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt want to think about what she did to me. Let‚Äôs just say that there was blood and pain and eventually I wasn‚Äôt even sure what day it was. The rain did stop, and Elizabeth let me out of the basement and made me walk with her to the edge of the road. Something stopped me there, just beyond the edge of the old driveway near the ancient mailbox, and she laughed as I watched her drive away in my car. Once she was gone, I walked the property, trapped inside by some invisible fence. To my surprise the house seemed to have changed, become new. There was electricity, not from a generator, but there were no phones and the doors that had once been locked, if they had been locked, were open. The library was as she had promised; there was even an old typewriter and a desk in the corner, the same typewriter that I‚Äôm using to record this story.

I don‚Äôt know how long she will be gone, but with any luck I can get this finished and put it in the mailbox. Maybe the mail carrier will find and send it to my friends at the podcast. Maybe no one will ever find it. Who knows.

If you are reading this though, please listen. Tom, Harry‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt come looking for me. It‚Äôs too dangerous. Elizabeth is dangerous and ruthless, and as clever as the devil himself. The things that she can do‚Ä¶ just don‚Äôt come here. Tell people that if they ever find and old house in the woods up here in the mountains, to stay away. Monsters are real, and they are living inside. With any luck I can find the ritual that the old priest used in one of these books, but until then look out. I don‚Äôt know what she is, but I know that she is hunting and that she is hungry. Eliza Bates, Elizabeth Bathory‚Ä¶ she might not have always been a monster, but she certainly is now.¬†

Please, please don‚Äôt come looking for me. I‚Äôm already gone.",3,1753807323.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

for the past 3 months or so, no matter how much sleep i get, i still feel tired throughout the day. i exercise 4-5 days a week, prioritize sleep (7-8 hrs per night), eat clean, only drink once a week, and i dont do drugs. i also rarely consume caffeine, maybe 2 cups of coffee per week. not sure if this is relevant but im definitely not depressed, and i like my job. my doctor had me get bloodwork done and everything was superb, aside from low vitamin D. my doctor prescribed some high concentration vitamin D pills. this seemed to help slightly, but i still dont feel like i used to.

i brought this up to my doctor and he said the next thing to check is my sleep. of course, the soonest sleep disorder clinic appointment i could get here in SF isnt until january. in the meantime, ive been using the sleep function on my apple watch to try and gather some data. im not sure how accurate the apple watch is with this, my guess is not very. regardless, i showed the data to my doctor and he said im not getting enough ""deep"" sleep. according to the watch, here are my averages:

* awake - 8 mins (2%), with several ""wake up"" instances per night
* REM - 114 mins (25%)
* core - 4 hrs 40 mins (63%)
* deep - 46 mins (10%)

any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated, im sort of at a loss at this point. i felt like superman only a few months ago, lol.",1,1753807255.0,sleep,3,1.0,False

Here is my full review of Couples Negril! For those of you who have never seen one of my reviews before... I'll warn you in advance that they're lengthy but will not apologize for the lengthiness.  I can choose to either be short/concise or thorough and I always choose thorough. haha   
  
Stay tuned for a full walkthrough video that I'll be posting soon, as well!  
  
For context, my husband and I are avid fans of Couples Resorts. We have now stayed at all 4 of them! We have stayed at Couples Swept Away 6 times and one time at Couples Sans Souci, Couples Tower Isle, and Couples Negril. We did a day pass at Couples Negril in 2021 when staying at Swept Away and weren't impressed so we never planned on staying there. However, after staying at the others... we figured we had to at least give it a try and, boy, are we glad we did! We enjoyed it much more than we were expecting to!  
  
Overall, this resort is amazing. The beach is pristine, the small/intimate layout of the resort creates more of a social environment, the main pool was impressive, and we enjoyed the entertainment.   
  
ROOM: We celebrated our 10 year anniversary during our recent trip to Jamaica so we splurged and booked a Beachfront Suite. The room was gorgeous and spacious, but could use some refreshing. Some of the outlets and switches didn't work, there were chips in the tile, and the paint is looking tired. We were extremely disappointed by the location of our first room... we booked a Beachfront Suites for the amazing views and, unfortunately our requests during pre-check-in were not able to be honored... we were placed in room 9109, the only Beachfront Suite with zero ocean view... first floor in building 9, right behind the AN beach. The large trees/bushes that surround the AN beach completely obstructed our view of the ocean. It's a great room category for guests who like to spend their days at the AN beach, but that's not us. haha Building 9 also had a lot of noise from the Royalton next door, especially at night. We only stayed at CN for 3 nights but they were able to move us to an amazing 3rd floor Beachfront Suite in Building 1 for our last night. The views were amazing! To be entirely honest, I don't think these two rooms should be considered the same category because they are so vastly different.   
  
BEACH: Couples Negril offers one of the best sections of beach in Negril. It's in a great location on Bloody Bay where the sand and water are pristine. It's deep (the beach, not the water) and long with plenty of seating. The shade is a little more scarce since Hurricane Beryl but there was still enough for everyone to have some if they wanted it. I do feel like the beach feels a little more crowded than CSA due to how close the chairs are to each other. There are vendors on the beach, but they were not disruptive. There is a lot of boat traffic nowadays and since Bloody Bay is a smaller cove, the boat traffic is almost constant... it felt like there was a boat speeding by towing a tube every few minutes. They tend to travel just barely outside of the ropes around the swimming area and the wakes the boats create stir up the water quite a bit. It seemed like sometimes they were intentionally stirring up the water in order to get attention from the guests... maybe in an attempt to attract customers? Though that seems like a bad business practice. haha  
  
POOLS: Couples Negril has one of the best pools we've seen at a Couples Resort. Definitely better than the pool at CSA. The swim-up bar had plenty of space and everything has been well-maintained. We liked the dive pool for a quieter environment and loved the hot tub that was tucked away over there.   
  
SERVICE: Service was consistently good but not particularly great. Bartenders were accommodating, but not as friendly as what we're used to when visiting Jamaica. Most of our servers were kind and efficient. The only exception was our experience at Lychee. I believe since we were there pretty late, everyone just wanted us to finish and leave so they could close. The hostess was not particularly welcoming and our server was clearly impatient. We absolutely loved the young lady working the coffee shop. I'm forgetting her name at the moment, but I made sure to note her on our comment card. She was always so sweet and had such a beautiful personality! Always smiling and content.    
  
FOOD/DRINKS: Overall, CN had our least favorite food out of all the Couples Resorts. This isn't to say it was bad, necessarily, but we've preferred the food at the other resorts. Breakfast was good but the omelet station was always quite slow. The veggie bar had some good options for a lighter lunch and we loved the self-serve pizza at the beach/pool grill. The other food at the beach/pool grill was fine with the exception of the burgers which tasted very frozen. I loved the option of pizza and the ice cream machine being available with the grill for a late night snack! The tortilla chips for the nachos were delish, as well! We had dinner at the fine dining restaurant, Otaheite, on our first night. Service was great, and we enjoyed the appetizers and soup but both our entrees (beef tenderloin and lamb chops) were very over cooked. Our meal at Lychee was good but we preferred the Asian restaurants at the other resorts. We never ordered room service so I can't speak to that. The pizza at Heliconia for dinner was to die for. I also loved CN's huge cocktail menu! So many options to try! I'll need to go back to finish the rest on my list! lol  
  
GYM: The gym at CN is small, but adequate. It has air conditioning which was a welcome feature considering we're used to working out in the open-air gym at CSA! There was a good variety of equipment and it was pretty well maintained.   
  
ENTERTAINMENT: CN definitely had the best entertainment and nightlife we've experienced at a Couples resort. I absolutely loved the fire dancers! The piano bar and night club always had quite the crowd in there, too. Much more than we've seen before and it looked like everyone was having a great time! The daily activities were fun and the entertainment team was great at getting people involved in whatever was going on at the time.  
  
Praises:  
\- The towels were always out first thing in the morning! We really appreciated that.   
\- Everything is centrally located so it's easy to get around the resort without having to walk very far.   
\- A little less foot traffic than at CSA and the vendors are less disruptive  
\- The pool is beautiful   
\- The beach/pool grill is huge with great seating, a huge bar, and tons of fans. The self-serve snack options were great, too! It's a great spot to hang out during the rain.   
\- I loved that all the dinner menus were posted over by the Beach Grill during the day  
  
Critiques:   
\- Bartenders could be a little more welcoming/friendly  
\- In my honest opinion, room 9108 should almost be considered a Garden Suite... or an Obstructed Beachfront Suite or something. It shouldn't be considered the same category as the other Beachfront Suites  
\- The beach could benefit from some more shade options  
\- The constant boat traffic was pretty annoying, especially since the bay is so small",2,1753806948.0,AllInclusiveResorts,1,1.0,False

1mcg9k9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Betrayal_Stories/comments/1mcg9k9/my_son_texted_this_house_is_mine_now_right_i_just/,"MY SON TEXTED ‚ÄúTHIS HOUSE IS MINE NOW, RIGHT‚Äù I JUST REPLIED ‚ÄúTALK TO MY ATTORNEY.","1. When I bought this house, I was 34 years old, newly widowed, and raising a five-year-old boy all on my own.

It wasn‚Äôt a mansion. Just a modest three-bedroom in a quiet cul-de-sac, the kind of place where you could hear sprinklers click on at 5 a.m. and neighbors waved while mowing the lawn. But to me, it was safety. It was stability. It was mine.

My son, Caleb, grew up in that house. He took his first steps across the worn wooden floors in the living room. He scraped his knees on the driveway trying to ride his bike without training wheels. He painted his bedroom walls bright green when he turned eleven because he said it made him feel ""faster."" I never quite understood that, but I let him do it. It was his space, too.

I worked two jobs for most of his childhood‚Äîreceptionist during the day, waitress at night‚Äîjust to keep up with the mortgage. We never had a lot, but I always made sure he had enough. He was a good kid, polite, smart, and surprisingly empathetic. Or so I thought.

As the years passed, Caleb grew into a man. He got a business degree, landed a well-paying job in finance, and eventually moved out to live with his girlfriend, Clara. I was proud of him. I truly was. I‚Äôd raised him to be independent, and he‚Äôd done exactly that.

But then things started to shift. Subtle at first.

He stopped calling as often. Visits turned into quick pop-ins that always ended with him checking his watch. When I‚Äôd ask how he was doing, he‚Äôd reply with vague answers, like he didn‚Äôt want to talk to someone who wouldn't ‚Äúget it.‚Äù And Clara... well, she never liked me much. I could feel it in the way she smiled‚Äîtoo tight, too practiced.

Still, I gave them space. I figured it was part of the growing-up process.

Then one Tuesday afternoon, I got a text. Caleb, ever blunt, had never been one for niceties. It simply read:

‚ÄúThis house is mine now, right?‚Äù

At first, I thought he must‚Äôve mistyped something. I stared at the screen for a good minute, trying to figure out what he could possibly mean. I responded, ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, sweetheart?‚Äù

His reply came in seconds:  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not getting any younger. I assumed you‚Äôd leave it to me, or just transfer the deed now. Clara and I are planning to start a family.‚Äù

I remember sitting in my kitchen chair, the same one I‚Äôd bought at a garage sale twenty years ago, hands trembling. Not with anger‚Äînot yet‚Äîbut with confusion. This was my son. My *boy*. The one I used to carry to bed when he fell asleep on the couch. The one I once gave my last $20 to so he could buy a graphing calculator for his math class.

I reread the message again and again. ‚ÄúThis house is mine now, right?‚Äù

He hadn‚Äôt asked. He *assumed*.

That was what cut me the deepest. Not the idea of him wanting the house someday‚ÄîI'd always intended for it to go to him in my will. But the entitlement, the coldness. The utter lack of grace. He was speaking to me like I was some obstacle in the way of his future.

I didn‚Äôt reply right away. I closed my phone, got up, and made a cup of tea. I remember watching the steam rise, letting it calm me, letting it slow my thoughts before they scattered in every direction.

I thought about all the nights I went to bed with aching feet and an empty stomach because I‚Äôd fed him first. I thought about the time I sold my engagement ring to pay for his car insurance after his first fender bender. I thought about the way his face used to light up when I picked him up from school, and how that same face now stared at me across a table with boredom, as though I were just another item on his to-do list.

After finishing my tea, I picked up my phone and typed a simple response:

‚ÄúTalk to my attorney.‚Äù

Then I called my attorney.

¬†

¬†

2. My attorney, Jonathan, had handled my affairs for over a decade. He wasn‚Äôt flashy or overly aggressive, but he had the kind of presence that made people sit up straighter when he entered a room. When I told him about Caleb‚Äôs message, he was quiet for a moment, then asked gently, ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

That was when I realized I wasn‚Äôt just hurt‚ÄîI was deeply, bone-deep tired. Tired of giving and being expected to give more. Tired of people assuming that just because I was kind, I was also soft. I wasn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut I think it‚Äôs time I made sure everything is set in writing.‚Äù

We reviewed my will, my living trust, my property deed‚Äîevery paper trail I had. I‚Äôd intended for Caleb to inherit the house when I passed, but after that text, something in me shifted. It wasn‚Äôt about spite. It was about *boundaries*‚Äîabout reminding myself that love doesn‚Äôt require blind surrender.

Jonathan helped me revise everything. The house would now go to a local women‚Äôs shelter as a long-term donation. I‚Äôd volunteered there on weekends for years, and I knew the difference a safe place could make for someone with nowhere else to go. If Caleb thought this house was his birthright, he was about to find out otherwise.

Of course, I didn‚Äôt tell him any of this right away.

Instead, I waited.

A week later, he called. No ‚ÄúHi Mom,‚Äù no small talk. Just, ‚ÄúSo... what did your lawyer say?‚Äù

I kept my tone calm. ‚ÄúHe said everything is handled. I‚Äôve made some changes.‚Äù

There was silence. Then: ‚ÄúChanges?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve decided not to transfer the deed,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still my home, Caleb. And frankly, the way you asked‚Äîno, *demanded*‚Äîmade me realize I needed to think carefully about what I value.‚Äù

He laughed. A short, bitter sound. ‚ÄúMom, come on. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm trying to steal from you. We‚Äôre family.‚Äù

Family.

Funny how people throw that word around when it suits them.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúWhich is why I expected more respect.‚Äù

There was a beat of silence, then his voice turned cold. ‚ÄúSo what, you‚Äôre going to punish me for planning ahead? For trying to secure something for my future family?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer. I didn‚Äôt need to.

A few days later, Clara called. That was a surprise. She'd never initiated a conversation with me before.

‚ÄúHi,‚Äù she said in her clipped, polite tone. ‚ÄúI just wanted to check in. Caleb‚Äôs been really upset. This whole house thing‚Äîhe‚Äôs confused.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said quietly, ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs quite clear.‚Äù

She hesitated. ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ it just seems like maybe you misunderstood. He didn‚Äôt mean to be rude.‚Äù

I smiled, though she couldn‚Äôt see it. ‚ÄúI understood perfectly. He made it very clear what he thought I was worth. And what he thought he was entitled to.‚Äù

Silence.

Then she sighed. ‚ÄúLook, we‚Äôre getting married next spring. We need a bigger space. We thought the house would be a good place to raise kids. It‚Äôs not personal.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut it *is* personal,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just a house, Clara. This is my life‚Äôs work. My memories. And more than that, it‚Äôs still my home. I‚Äôm not dead.‚Äù

The line went quiet again.

‚ÄúI hope the wedding goes well,‚Äù I said before hanging up.

A month passed.

I didn‚Äôt hear from either of them. I went about my life‚Äîvolunteered at the shelter, worked in the garden, baked a little too often, and read books I‚Äôd put off for years. I felt lighter, freer. Like I‚Äôd stopped waiting for permission to put myself first.

Then, one afternoon, I received a letter. It was from Caleb. Handwritten, surprisingly. The envelope was thick, formal. I sat at the kitchen table and opened it slowly.

It was a legal notice.

He was contesting my mental capacity. Claiming I was no longer of sound mind and therefore incapable of managing my assets. His goal? To gain control of my estate *before* I passed.

My hands didn‚Äôt tremble this time.

They balled into fists.

3. ¬†I read every word of the letter. Twice. His handwriting was neat, almost mechanical‚Äîno warmth, no hesitation. Just cold, calculated language accusing me of being mentally unfit to handle my own affairs. He claimed I was ‚Äúexhibiting signs of decline,‚Äù citing vague examples: forgetting details, making ‚Äúirrational financial decisions,‚Äù isolating myself from family.

I wasn‚Äôt shocked.

I was *done*.

He‚Äôd decided that if manipulation didn‚Äôt work, coercion would. That if guilt didn‚Äôt bend me, fear might. But I had built a life on my own two feet. And I wasn‚Äôt about to crumble for a boy who thought entitlement was love.

I forwarded the letter to Jonathan immediately.

‚ÄúThis is serious,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs trying to initiate a conservatorship.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs fight it.‚Äù

He asked if I wanted to explore a settlement, or if maybe I‚Äôd reconsider transferring some assets to Caleb to avoid a long court process.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHe wants a war. He‚Äôll get it.‚Äù

And so it began.

Court documents, filings, phone calls. I had to undergo an independent psychological evaluation‚Äîwhich I passed with flying colors. The psychiatrist even chuckled and told me, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sharper than most people half your age.‚Äù

I‚Äôd always taken pride in my clarity, my sense of purpose. Now, it was my weapon.

Caleb, on the other hand, seemed to unravel with each court appearance.

The first time we sat across from each other in the courtroom, I saw the shift in him. He wasn‚Äôt my son anymore. He was a man backed into a corner, embarrassed that his attempt to seize control was now public. Clara sat beside him, lips pursed, arms crossed.

My testimony was simple. I spoke calmly, plainly. I explained how I had built my life from scratch after my husband died. How I had paid off the mortgage alone. How my recent decision to donate the house stemmed from values, not instability.

When they called Caleb to testify, he fumbled. He spoke of ‚Äúconcerns,‚Äù not evidence. The judge asked him for specifics‚Äîdates, incidents, witnesses. He had none.

He stammered through a statement about how ‚Äúmost women her age aren‚Äôt so independent,‚Äù and I could see the judge‚Äôs brow lift, just slightly. It was over before it even began.

The judge dismissed the case. Declared me fully competent. And made a quiet comment as she finalized the paperwork: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs admirable, Ms. Bennett, to see someone who protects her boundaries with such grace.‚Äù

Outside the courtroom, I walked past Caleb without a word. But I could feel his stare‚Äîhollow, burning, confused. He had expected a pushover. A mother who would crumble under pressure. Instead, he got a storm.

But I wasn‚Äôt done.

I went home, pulled out the old photo albums, and removed the ones with just him. I boxed up the childhood toys I had kept all these years‚Äîhis favorite stuffed bear, his Lego set, even the birthday cards I‚Äôd saved in a shoebox. I mailed them to his address with a note:

**‚ÄúHere are the things you left behind. The house isn‚Äôt one of them.‚Äù**

A week later, I got a message.

It was short. Just four words:

**‚ÄúYou really hate me.‚Äù**

I didn‚Äôt reply.

It wasn‚Äôt about hate. It was about truth.

Sometimes, the hardest thing a mother can do is draw the line between unconditional love and self-preservation. I still loved the boy I raised. But the man he became? He needed to learn that actions have consequences.

And so I lived my life.

I threw open the windows in the mornings and listened to birdsong with my coffee. I started painting again. I even adopted a rescue dog‚Äîan old mutt with cloudy eyes and a heart full of gratitude. We went on long walks together. We didn‚Äôt speak, but we understood each other perfectly.

And as for the house?

I signed the final donation paperwork six months later. The shelter director cried when I handed her the keys.

‚ÄúThis will change lives,‚Äù she said.

I smiled. ‚ÄúIt already has.‚Äù

4. ¬†A few months after the court case and the final donation, the house was transformed.

What used to be my quiet refuge‚Äîfaded curtains, old furniture, decades of memories‚Äîwas now alive with a different kind of purpose. New voices echoed through the halls: women escaping violence, young mothers trying to rebuild their lives, children learning to sleep without fear. I visited once, quietly, not to be recognized or thanked, but just to see.

They‚Äôd painted the walls a soft, calming blue. My old garden had been replanted into a vegetable patch, tended to by the residents. One little boy was drawing on the sidewalk in chalk‚Äîspaceships, I think. I smiled at him. He smiled back, no idea who I was.

That house no longer belonged to me. And yet, I had never felt more at home with my decision.

I never heard from Caleb again‚Äînot directly.

But I did hear things through mutual friends. His engagement to Clara was called off just a few weeks after the case ended. Apparently, the public embarrassment of trying to take his mother‚Äôs house‚Äîand losing‚Äîwas too much for her to weather. She‚Äôd told someone, ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs how he treats family, what will he do to me when I‚Äôm not useful?‚Äù

Smart girl.

Caleb moved to a different city after that. I assume it was to escape the judgmental stares or the whispers that followed him in our neighborhood. It‚Äôs strange how reputations unravel so quickly when people finally speak the truth.

One of his old college friends bumped into me at a bookstore and said, ‚ÄúI used to admire him. Until I saw what he tried to do to you. You raised yourself better than that.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say much. I just nodded.

But inside, I felt something I hadn‚Äôt in a long time‚Äîpeace.

Not because I‚Äôd won, or because he‚Äôd lost. But because I had stopped waiting for him to come around. I had stopped hoping that the son I raised would return to me in the man he became.

Instead, I moved on.

I traveled to places I‚Äôd always dreamed of. Italy. Morocco. Vietnam. I sent postcards to my friends, picked up little trinkets, and started writing in a journal. Every page was a quiet declaration: *I am still here. I am still mine.*

One afternoon, while watching the sunset in Santorini, I wrote:

‚ÄúMy son once said, ‚ÄòThis house is mine now, right?‚Äô  
I replied, ‚ÄòTalk to my attorney.‚Äô  
What I wanted to say was, ‚ÄòSon, you lost something far greater than bricks and wood that day. You lost me.‚Äô‚Äù

Sometimes, people think revenge is about anger. About destruction.

But the sweetest revenge I‚Äôve found‚Ä¶ is peace.

It's waking up without bitterness, without longing for apologies that may never come. It's protecting your boundaries and honoring your story.

It‚Äôs smiling at the sunrise with nothing left to prove.

They say living well is the best revenge.

5. The weeks after the court case felt strangely quiet.

There were no more late-night phone calls from Caleb. No passive-aggressive texts from Clara. No legal documents arriving in certified envelopes. The silence should have felt like victory. But truthfully, it felt like grief.

Grief for the son I used to know.

People often talk about grief when someone dies. But no one warns you about the kind that comes when someone is *still alive*, just‚Ä¶ no longer who you remember.

I kept trying to reconcile the young boy who used to press dandelions into my palms with the man who‚Äôd tried to declare me incompetent. I searched every memory like it might offer some clue‚Äîsome moment where I went wrong.

But the truth was, parenting doesn‚Äôt come with guarantees. You can give everything you have‚Äîyour time, your money, your heart‚Äîand still, people make their own choices. Their own mistakes.

And so I began the hardest part of all: letting go.

I went through the rest of my things, packing up old memories I was finally ready to part with. Photo albums, school crafts, even his old Halloween costumes. Not out of anger, but clarity. These things had been anchors, not mementos. And it was time to drift free.

I spent more time at the shelter. Not just volunteering, but connecting. Some of the women there were younger than Caleb, but their resilience humbled me. One of them‚Äîher name was Rochelle‚Äîreminded me of myself at 30. Tough on the outside, deeply unsure on the inside. She had two kids, and when she found out she was moving into the house I donated, she hugged me and cried into my shoulder.

‚ÄúI thought I‚Äôd never have a real home again,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúYou do now,‚Äù I replied.

We painted the upstairs bedroom together. Lavender, her daughter‚Äôs favorite color. She asked me about the house‚Äîwhat it used to look like, who lived there. I told her stories. Not about Caleb, but about *me*. The woman who built that life.

That was when I realized something powerful: I didn‚Äôt lose the house. I *gave* it a new life. One that mattered. One that healed.

One Sunday afternoon, as I sat reading on my porch, a car pulled up in front of my rental cottage. It was a simple gray sedan. The windows were tinted, but I recognized the shape of the figure in the driver‚Äôs seat immediately.

Caleb.

I hadn‚Äôt seen him in over six months. My breath caught, not in fear, but in... readiness. I stood, slowly, waiting to see what he would do.

He didn‚Äôt get out of the car. He just sat there, staring at me through the windshield.

After maybe a minute, the window rolled down. He looked thinner, his hair messier than I remembered. He didn‚Äôt smile. He didn‚Äôt wave.

He simply said, ‚ÄúWhy did you do it?‚Äù

His voice cracked, just slightly.

I didn‚Äôt respond right away. I walked closer, but stayed on the sidewalk. ‚ÄúDo what?‚Äù

‚ÄúGive away the house,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTo strangers. You knew I wanted it.‚Äù

I studied his face. He looked exhausted. Not angry. Not cruel. Just‚Ä¶ lost.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not strangers to me,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd wanting something doesn‚Äôt mean you deserve it.‚Äù

He blinked, taken aback.

‚ÄúI wanted a son who loved me for me,‚Äù I continued. ‚ÄúNot for what I could give him.‚Äù

He looked down, said nothing.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Caleb,‚Äù I added. ‚ÄúBut this isn‚Äôt something I regret.‚Äù

He finally looked up, and for the first time in a long time, there was no arrogance in his eyes. Just something like regret‚Ä¶ or shame.

‚ÄúClara left,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShe said I used people. Said I was becoming my father.‚Äù

That hit harder than he probably realized. His father had been many things‚Äîcharming, ambitious, magnetic‚Äîbut ultimately, he left me with nothing but debts and silence.

I didn‚Äôt say anything. Some things don‚Äôt need a reply.

‚ÄúI guess I just thought it was... mine. After everything,‚Äù he mumbled.

I nodded slowly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the problem. You thought love guaranteed inheritance. But love... isn‚Äôt a transaction.‚Äù

He sat quietly. Then, without another word, rolled up the window and drove away.

He didn‚Äôt look back.

And I didn‚Äôt go after him.

6. After he drove off, I stood there for a long while, the soft breeze tugging at my sleeves like a child wanting attention. I watched the empty road where his car had disappeared and felt something curious: not anger. Not grief. **Relief**.

For the first time since this ordeal began, I knew I had truly closed the door‚Äînot just on Caleb‚Äôs entitlement, but on a version of motherhood I‚Äôd carried far too long. The one that said, *sacrifice everything, no matter the cost.*

I had done that already. And it nearly cost me myself.

The days moved slowly but sweetly after that. I returned to routines I‚Äôd forgotten I loved: early morning walks, tending to a small herb garden on my back patio, reading dusty old novels I‚Äôd been meaning to finish for twenty years. I joined a local community group‚Äîother women, mostly in their 50s and 60s, some widowed, some divorced, some gloriously single and proud of it.

We held dinners, potlucks, little wine tastings in our kitchens. No drama. No expectations. Just laughter that felt honest, earned.

But every so often, Caleb would sneak into my thoughts. I didn‚Äôt hate him. I didn‚Äôt even wish him ill. But I also didn‚Äôt pine for reconciliation. That was the part that surprised me most‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt *need* him to understand me anymore. That hope had quietly slipped away, and in its place was something stronger: acceptance.

Then, one afternoon, about three months after his unannounced visit, I received a package.

No return address.

Inside was a small box. Neatly packed. A simple envelope on top with just my name written‚Äî**‚ÄúMom‚Äù**‚Äîin his handwriting.

I hesitated before opening it. My hands were steady, but my chest stirred with caution.

Inside the envelope was a short note:

*I‚Äôve been in therapy. I‚Äôve got a long way to go. But I want to start by returning this.*  
*You kept it all these years. Maybe I finally understand why.*

*‚ÄîCaleb*

Beneath the note, wrapped in tissue paper, was his old baby blanket. The one I‚Äôd sewn myself when I was still pregnant, pieced together from leftover fabric scraps‚Äînavy blue, soft gray, a strip of green from one of his dad‚Äôs shirts. It had a little stitched moon in the corner.

I‚Äôd packed that blanket in the box I sent him after the court battle, never expecting it to matter. To me, it was symbolic‚Äîa reminder of how far we‚Äôd drifted. I assumed he‚Äôd toss it.

But here it was again.

Not a declaration of change. Not a promise to rebuild.

Just a quiet gesture.

And that was enough for now.

I placed the blanket in my linen drawer‚Äînot to treasure it, but to honor it. To honor *us*, in all our flawed, fractured, complicated history.

And then I moved on.

Spring arrived early that year. The cherry blossoms bloomed down by the park near my house, and I spent more time outside, watching people come and go. Families, lovers, elderly couples walking slowly arm-in-arm.

One morning, I ran into Rochelle and her daughter from the shelter. They looked different‚Äîstronger. Happier. Her daughter wore a bright yellow backpack and beamed when she told me she‚Äôd made the honor roll.

‚ÄúWe still live in your house,‚Äù Rochelle said, her smile wide and sure. ‚ÄúBut now, it finally feels like ours.‚Äù

I smiled back. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exactly what I hoped for.‚Äù

That house‚Äîonce a symbol of sacrifice, then a battleground‚Äîwas now a place of healing. It had done its job. And so had I.

In the end, this story wasn‚Äôt just about a son who tried to take what wasn‚Äôt his.

It was about a woman who remembered what was always hers: **her voice**, her peace, her power.

They say motherhood is forever.

But sometimes, to save yourself‚Ä¶ you have to let go.

7. When I walked into my attorney‚Äôs office that morning, I wasn‚Äôt the same woman who had tearfully packed up family albums the night before. I was steel. I was done waiting for my son to come to his senses. I laid out every detail for my lawyer‚ÄîMichael. I told him about the text, about the way Derek had quietly manipulated our family trust, how he had visited my late husband's sister behind my back and gotten her to support his twisted narrative.

Michael‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just a property dispute,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is premeditated coercion.‚Äù

We drafted a cease-and-desist letter first‚Äîto stop Derek from further tampering with any of the estate‚Äôs contents or documents. I didn‚Äôt send it to Derek. I sent it to his lawyer. Then, I filed an official petition to review the trust‚Äôs terms and re-evaluate the division of assets under undue influence. The real gift, though, was that I had kept every email, every passive-aggressive voicemail, every demand masked as concern. The paper trail was pristine.

The next move was subtle. I didn‚Äôt call Derek. I didn‚Äôt reply to his ‚Äú???‚Äù follow-up text after I told him to talk to my attorney. I simply vanished from communication, letting Michael do all the talking. I knew that would enrage him more than any outburst ever could.

He showed up at my door three days later. Didn‚Äôt even knock‚Äîjust started pounding, shouting through the wood, ‚ÄúMOM. THIS ISN‚ÄôT FUNNY. WE NEED TO TALK!‚Äù

I sat in the living room, sipping coffee. Didn‚Äôt move. Let him shout. Let him feel what it was like to be shut out. He gave up after ten minutes and peeled off in his leased BMW, tires screeching. My neighbor across the street, a retired police sergeant, gave me a thumbs up from his porch.

That night, I got an email from Derek‚Äôs lawyer‚Äîa young man trying to play at confidence, probably not realizing his client had put himself in legal quicksand. The letter stated that Derek believed the house to be ‚Äúin a state of transition‚Äù and that he would begin moving items into ‚Äúhis‚Äù section of the home by the end of the week.

Michael laughed when he read it. ‚ÄúOh, let him try. That‚Äôll give us the trespassing charge we need.‚Äù

I hired security. Quiet, private professionals who installed cameras, reinforced the gate lock, and stayed on-site in plain clothes. I also got the locks changed‚Äîagain. Every little move I made was completely legal. And Derek? He was watching from the outside, fuming, completely powerless to stop any of it.

Then came the estate hearing.

It was public.

Derek didn‚Äôt expect me to show up with a 3-inch binder labeled ""Derek's Manipulations."" He didn‚Äôt expect that Aunt Eleanor‚Äîmy late husband‚Äôs sister‚Äîhad reached out to me just days before to apologize. Apparently, Derek had lied to her, told her I was planning to sell the house out from under him and vanish with the proceeds. He told her I was dating someone suspicious. He weaponized her fear of abandonment, all to make her think he was ‚Äúsaving‚Äù the family legacy.

When Eleanor saw the security footage of him screaming at my door, and copies of his text messages where he said, ‚ÄúThe house is mine anyway, you can either leave with grace or not,‚Äù she broke. In front of the judge. She broke down in tears and rescinded her support entirely.

The court ordered a full forensic audit of the trust and Derek‚Äôs financial activities. Turns out, he‚Äôd been siphoning small amounts from one of the secondary accounts left in my husband's name‚Äîamounts small enough to avoid red flags at the bank, but over time, they added up.

Embezzlement. Fraud. Breach of fiduciary duty.

Derek‚Äôs lawyer dropped him the next week.

And I?

I slept better than I had in years.

Word spread through the family like wildfire. Everyone suddenly remembered how ‚Äúoff‚Äù Derek had been lately, how ‚Äúpushy‚Äù or ‚Äúparanoid‚Äù he seemed. Funny how they find clarity once the legal dust settles.

He tried to call me once‚Äîleft a voicemail that started with, ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt have to go nuclear‚Ä¶‚Äù and ended with, ‚ÄúI was just trying to protect what Dad wanted.‚Äù

I deleted it without listening to the rest.

Derek‚Äôs trial is next month. He‚Äôs facing fines, possibly jail time. The house? Fully and legally protected in my name, now reinforced by every court ruling I needed. And not just that‚ÄîMichael helped me restructure the trust entirely, splitting future inheritances between my grandchildren directly. Derek won‚Äôt see a cent. Not now, not ever.

I stood in my garden last weekend, watering the roses my husband planted thirty years ago. The breeze was soft. The sunset golden. I thought of Derek as a little boy, how he used to run across the lawn barefoot, how he once told me he‚Äôd build a treehouse just for me when I got old.

I wish he had stayed that boy.

But he didn‚Äôt.

And I‚Äôm done mourning that.

They say living well is the best revenge. Sometimes, a little direct justice doesn‚Äôt hurt.

Gainfully employed. Emotionally bankrupt. Spiritually flattened. Based in Pune.

I pay my taxes. I follow traffic rules. I ride a classy 350. I believed in the system. Thought I was being a responsible citizen. What a joker I was.

It‚Äôs the end of July, time to pay taxes and also the Monsoon season. In most parts of the world, that means some showers and a light jacket. In Pune, it means I have to prepare for combat every time I step out. I live in Lohegaon. My office is in Koregaon Park. That should be a 20-minute ride on a good day. These days it takes 50 minutes if I‚Äôm lucky, 75 if the universe decides to test my will to live. Today, my bike elegantly slid into a pothole that was hiding under a thick layer of what I can only describe as ‚Äúorganically sourced brown smoothie‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt speeding. I wasn‚Äôt being reckless. How can I in bumper-to-bumper traffic? And yet, I‚Äôm the one paying for repairs. I love how the state gives me nothing but still expects me to cough up money like I live in Switzerland.

Break a signal because I‚Äôm running late thanks to your clown-level infrastructure? Police appear like ghosts from a horror movie. Try to get to work legally? Get stuck behind a Ganpati procession that has somehow become a concert. Speakers louder than an airport runway. People dancing like it‚Äôs the apocalypse. No one asked for permission. No one cares. And you can‚Äôt say a thing because ‚Äúit‚Äôs culture, bro.‚Äù Pune has weaponised culture to justify public nuisance. In Pune, if there‚Äôs a birthday, holiday, festival, Ekadashi, or some uncle‚Äôs retirement, a stage gets built in the middle of the road!

Every shortcut I take to avoid traffic turns into a real-life boss fight. Someone is always driving on the wrong side. ALWAYS. They stare at me like I‚Äôm the problem. And 9 times out of 10, it‚Äôs a ""moonshine-white"" untucked shirt and aviator shades weilding dude at 8 PM with an MH-14 number plate. I don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre teaching in RTO Pimpri-Chinchwad but apparently ‚Äúright side driving‚Äù isn‚Äôt on the syllabus. It‚Äôs like civic sense was deleted from the collective consciousness of the city.

In a desperate bid to escape this madness, I selected a house on something called ""Forest Road"" I know, it sounds poetic. Idyllic, even. Like a place where you‚Äôd sip filter coffee while birds chirp and you find inner peace. Except reality said, ‚ÄúLOL, cute.‚Äù Turns out it isn‚Äôt just a name‚Äîit‚Äôs a geographical warning. Because now I share my address with actual hyenas and leopards. Not metaphorical ones. Not shady uncles. Literal wildlife, casually entering city limits like they‚Äôve paid property tax. Every morning ride feels like I‚Äôm auditioning for Man vs Wild: Pune Edition. I'm not sure if I need a helmet or a tranquilizer dart. Pune isn‚Äôt a city anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs National Geographic with potholes.

Don‚Äôt even get me started on basic services. There‚Äôs no piped water where i live. It‚Äôs all Tanker mafia! They charge you like they‚Äôre bottling Evian, but the water quality is so bad it‚Äôs giving me skin issues, hair fall, and probably emotional trauma. Power cuts have become part of the vibe. Roads are randomly dug up for ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù in the middle of the rainy season. Internet works when it feels like. Everything is broken and nobody seems responsible.

And the corruption. Oh god, the corruption. Every week there‚Äôs a new scam. PMC sweeper scam. Garbage vehicle scam. Tree authority scam (Yes, even the trees are in on it!). APMC scam. Talathi scam. Officials are extorting money, beating up journalists, and filing cases against their own spouses. Meanwhile, infrastructure collapses faster than my will to attend Monday meetings.

I grew up in Navi Mumbai, people call me crazy for leaving it. And they‚Äôre not wrong. Navi Mumbai.. where roads exist, water flows, and public services‚Ä¶function. I left all that behind to be part of a startup dream in Pune. I still love what I do. But I‚Äôm genuinely starting to wonder if that dream requires surviving a warzone every morning.

The worst part? The second I miss my tax filing deadline, I‚Äôll get a shiny notice from the IT department. They‚Äôll chase me down like I stole gold biscuits from RBI. Meanwhile, PMC can‚Äôt even find a missing manhole cover unless it trends on Twitter.

And while all of this is happening, I‚Äôm dealing with personal life sh*t that‚Äôs pushing me to the edge. So yeah, excuse me if I don‚Äôt feel thrilled about paying taxes this year. Or if I‚Äôm not excited about another Independence Day celebration that‚Äôll probably shut down half the roads with a DJ Snake remix.

I don‚Äôt need luxury. I‚Äôm not asking for air-conditioned footpaths or six-lane expressways. I just want roads that don‚Äôt kill me, water that doesn‚Äôt poison me, and a city that doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs actively trying to gaslight me every single day.

Pune, I loved you once. But you‚Äôve become that ex who keeps saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll change‚Äù while setting your mattress on fire.

Curd/fermented foods - Eating curd at night increases kapha dosha, which can lead to lethargy and nasal congestion.

Caffeine or excessively spicy foods - Tea, coffee, or fried foods increase pitta, which makes the mind restless and disrupts sleep.

Ayurvedic remedy: Drink warm milk with turmeric or lukewarm water with honey 2 hours before bedtime. These increase the sleep hormone melatonin.

1mcg6nz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1mcg6nz/delve_into_the_best_power_converter_hyted_ac120v/,Delve Into the Best Power Converter HYTED AC120V for Travel Use,"The HYTED AC120V Voltage Converter has been a game changer in my overseas travel adventures. As someone who frequently travels across countries with different voltage standards, finding a reliable power converter has always been tricky. This model stood out to me because it doesn't just convert voltage ‚Äì it feels like it was designed to cater to almost every little electrical hiccup a traveler could encounter.

**A Portable Yet Sturdy Design**  
The first thing I noticed was how compact and lightweight it is, clocking in at just 1.6 pounds. Tossing it into my travel bag was a no-brainer, as it fits seamlessly amongst my clothes and gadgets without adding unnecessary bulk. The design itself is sleek and feels durable, which is essential when you know it's going to endure the rough-and-tumble of travel. With dimensions of 6.4 x 3.5 x 2.3 inches, it feels sturdy in the hand and doesn't skimp on quality materials. It‚Äôs not a flimsy gadget you‚Äôd worry about breaking after a few uses.

**Seamless Usage Across Borders**  
What truly stands out about this product is its versatility. I‚Äôve used it in countries like France, UK, and China without any issues. It comes with four different adapter types ‚Äì Type C, Type G, Type I, and Type E/F ‚Äì so it can tackle over 160 countries' outlet styles. I loved how clearly these adapters are labeled, making it easy to pick the one I need even when I‚Äôm groggy after a long flight. Whether I needed to power my laptop in London or charge my phone in Sydney, this adapter-converter combo handled it all like a pro.

[Check HYTED AC120V price on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b0f5npxgcb/)

**Advanced Safety for Peace of Mind**  
As a self-proclaimed tech geek, I‚Äôm obsessed with safety features in devices. The HYTED AC120V goes above and beyond in this department. It includes Over-Temperature Protection, Over-Current Protection, Overload Protection, Surge Protection, and even Short Circuit Protection. The pure sine wave output kept my devices running smoothly, which is a big deal because I‚Äôve fried a hairdryer once using a less efficient product. I also appreciated the fuseless design; instead of scrambling to replace fuses whenever something goes awry, this one automatically resets itself. There‚Äôs a noticeable indicator light that flashes when there‚Äôs an issue, but once fixed, it resumes operation seamlessly.

**Merits**  
- Converts voltage (220-250V to 120V) efficiently for U.S. appliances.  
- Covers a wide array of international plug types for ultimate convenience.  
- Includes safety-tested certifications like CE and UL for reliability.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The fan noise could be quieter. It‚Äôs not deafening by any means, but in a quiet hotel room, it can be noticeable.  
- It would have been even better if a carrying case for the adapters was included in the box.  

**Perfect for Varied Appliance Needs**  
From coffee makers to curling irons, this converter handled pretty much every U.S. appliance I‚Äôve thrown at it. It powered my hair straightener in Japan and even kept my bulky CPAP machine running smoothly in Europe. That said, you need to stick to the 0-1600 watt range ‚Äì anything above that, and you risk overloading the converter. While I don‚Äôt have a blender included in my travel kit, I tested it out at home, and it performed impeccably.

**Other Options**  
I‚Äôve also tried other products like the FOVAL Power Step Down Converter and the BESTEK Voltage Converter in the past. Compared to those, HYTED AC120V offers better safety mechanisms and a simpler, fuss-free experience. The FOVAL was bulkier and didn‚Äôt handle surges as effectively, while BESTEK lacked the fuseless design, leaving me stranded overseas with dead appliances more than once. HYTED strikes the perfect balance of portability, power, and safety ‚Äì hence why it‚Äôs now my go-to.

**Money's Worth**  
Price-wise, I think the HYTED AC120V offers excellent value for what you get. Sure, other converters might come cheaper, but they tend to lack the durability or advanced features this one brings to the table. For the frequent traveler, investing in this product just makes sense. The peace of mind alone is worth it, knowing that your gadgets are safe and sound.

discovered $6 coffee runs were happening 11x in 10 days ($66)

$8 food delivery was nearly daily ($200+ monthly just on convenience food)

small purchases ($3-15) were 80% of my spending

50/30/20 budget adapted for college income:

50% needs: meal plan supplement, textbooks, laundry, phone bill

30% wants: eating out, entertainment, random purchases

20% savings/emergency fund (started with just $20/month)

calculated this before each paycheck, not after spending

social spending boundaries:

told friend group about budget goals (uncomfortable but necessary)

suggested alternatives: potluck dinners instead of restaurants, movie nights vs theater trips

learned to say ""i can't afford that right now"" without shame

additionally, i used student discounts to their fullest. no shame in saving some money.

results after 30 days:

went from $47 to $180 in checking

eliminated overdraft fees (was paying \~$35/month in fees)

built $60 emergency fund

the biggest lesson i learned was that small purchases compound faster than you realize. tracking everything for just 2 weeks showed me patterns i couldn't see otherwise. Hope it helps.",10,1753806605.0,budget,0,0.92,False

What is a STEP raffle? A step raffle is a tool used to complete a main raffle that is struggling to finish. The remaining spots in the main raffle are bundled into prizes to be awarded in the step raffle.

This is for 88 spots in the MAIN. 88 spots will be raffled for a total value of $440 (88 x 5)

There will be 11 winners. The same person can win multiple times, but not on the same number (the bot will be called once for 11 winners).

All eleven winners will get 8 spots each (11 x 8 = 88).

There are NO Spot limits.

You MUST have a spot in the MAIN to request a spot in the STEP for the first 30 min.

Participants NOT in the MAIN must wait for my announcement for when the 30 min is up. Anyone not in the MAIN raffle that requests spots before my announcement will be ignored.

Payment required within 10 minutes of raffle filling. 5 minutes for drama.

1mcg4h2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1mcg4h2/pre_debate_discussion_is_it_more_effective_to/,Pre debate discussion: is it more effective to energize the center left base or bridge build to the further left?,"Hopefully the debate today will stick to this topic and not be yet another indictment of streamer man being mean or Hasan simping/HDS accusing‚Ä¶ but in our ideal scenario, the debate is going to be between the two positions in the title.

First, the overall landscape:

Democratic engagement is low, party leadership is largely uninspiring, and Dem‚Äôs ability to message sucks for a multitude of reasons (not the least of which is Dem ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù media not being so friendly). All of this means a flaccid turnout and there needs to be some tadalafil mixed into the Democrat supporter‚Äôs morning coffee for some throbbing support to happen. That tadalafil comes in two forms: focusing on energizing the existing center left base **or** bridge building to the far left. 

Energizing the existing base, focusing on moderation and center:

> the steel-man as I understand it would be the math shows that Democrats have the numbers. Popular vote has favored Democrats in all but two 21st century general elections and 2024 wasn‚Äôt that big of a gap. Going moderate and focusing on courting center left and having center left messaging would afford more opportunities to reenergize and pick up voters than going to the fringes where there‚Äôs less to pick up at the expense of excluding larger pools of voters. It‚Äôs simple math. The necessary distancing from far left activism wouldn‚Äôt damage the ability of Democrats to win.

Bridge building to the far left:

> the steel-man is the far left are the most politically energized and engaged people in the left wing. They command influence and audiences that could be used to tip scales and build energy and excitement for Democrats if we just coalition build with them and get them on board with the broader Democratic Party. Obviously some concessions would need to be made, but it‚Äôs not anything we wouldn‚Äôt agree with anyway mostly since they‚Äôre closer to our ideal vision than going towards the center, which would be going closer to MAGA in terms of policy.

So I know that Hasan is a part of the conversation, but he as an individual isn‚Äôt that important to me when I‚Äôm thinking about this from a 30,000 foot view and the characters involved in this debate and their baggage isn‚Äôt that important to me‚Ä¶ so I‚Äôd prefer if this discussion wasn‚Äôt about Pisco or Hasan or Destiny or the personalities involved (although I fear when the rubber meets the road, that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs going to devolve to). The questions I‚Äôm looking to see answered and challenged in the debate are:

Where is the largest pool of voters to pick up?

Does going one direction guarantee exclusion?

Whats the validity that center messaging would play and break through?

If the far left is to be largely abandoned, whats the plan and ability of Democrats to get the reins around social media? 

Who are the center left leaders and how do we bolster them and support them and get them in front (the Newsoms and the Buttigiegs and the Osoff types)?

What does Mamdami mean for the party in terms of the appetite for national politics to go his direction?

What is the data showing theres an appetite for center left messaging and what is the data showing theres an appetite for a farther left push?

If the far left is to be courted, whats the line? Is it ‚ÄúNo Enemies To The Left‚Äù (similar to Christopher Rufo‚Äôs ‚ÄúNo Enemies to the Right‚Äù) and everything is in play or is there a boundary line that we start excluding people from speaking for the party? 

Just full disclosure, I personally am firmly on the side that center focused messaging and base energizing is the way forward but thats mainly because that speaks to me personally as someone who‚Äôs had a weird political journey between the two fringes and landed in the center left Liberal at this point in my life (I have a hard line against illiberalism and will not support any illiberal far left, regardless of how gently it‚Äôs phrased‚Ä¶ and it goes without saying the same for the far right and conservatism in general at this point in time) however, I couldn‚Äôt defend my position with anything more than vibes, emotional appeals, and half remembered polls, examples, and news stories at this point if you pressed me unprepared.",5,1753806582.0,Destiny,7,1.0,False
