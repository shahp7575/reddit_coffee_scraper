But then I realised what value is in a puck screen which is a mesh cover to help in distribution. Am I being crazy? My machine doesn't have a mesh cover though so I feel like there is some value there.

I'm looking to enhance my setup because I have funneling in my coffee. I've got a Breville bambino and I like it but even when I wdt it funnels with one of the holes having all the coffee and the other having minimal drips. And sometimes it's perfect flow between the two. So I'm feeling like it's because of funneling.

And for other equipment is there any recommended stores that aren't just end stop of Temu shopping?

I was looking at Pesado or MHW-3bomber. Any advice would be great.

Before getting it, I googled reviews and of course most of the ones with no problems are silent.., so the most of the posts are from the few that have had a problem.  So I would like to share my very positive experience.  I don’t get insurance for a cgm this I paid $90 for 4 weeks of 24 hour a day glucose info.  It has given me tons of insight that is otherwise very tricky to analyze with the finger prick.  (I compared it with a prick twice and the numbers were in sync..)
For examples; I now understand my “dawn phenomena”.  I can tell the mild cortisol affects from my morning coffee…. I have learned how many different items (and in some cases the amount) affect my glucose… and it has shown me that my responses are truly impaired.., meaning that without the weight loss (40+ lbs), the diet controls, and the exercise, my glucose levels would quickly return to unhealthy levels.  And that’s a hard but important truth to sink in….

So in my case, I am absolutely positive about my 4 week period with this Lingo CGM.   No issues with it at all.., just a much better understanding of how to live healthier and longer.  

Just finishing week 3 and haven’t decided whether or not to go 4 more weeks yet…

I haven’t been on Earth for nearly a week. Not by choice– trust me, I may not fear many things but space is 90% of them so fuck it in its entirety. This one's gonna take a bit to finish. I’m still rusty at writing, writing these has gotten some of my mojo back, and I want to give you my best here. 



Something had recently dawned on me. After posting the last part, I reread it to make sure I had spelled everything right and see if my grammar was in order– although I should, I don’t proofread– when I grazed over the last paragraph. I wrote it without thinking very much, just tossed the thought on the page. But, rereading it, it felt like someone standing in my ears screaming for attention. My dreams, the carousel of nightmares I had been living with since I was able to plunder REM. They were coming to life and dying by my hand. The gangly and inhuman humanoid at the foot of my bed, with me since 3, left after burning the corpse of the entity below my bed. Running across a lawn only to be caught and torn apart by snarling piles of shifting rotten meat but never dying, with me since 4, left after euthanizing the last Mockingbird. Sharpened branches plunging through my body as I crucified on a tree with fire roaring below encircled by figures, with me since 2, left after crushing the throat of the cult leader. 



The nightmares I faced and conquered were the nightmares I conquered in my youth. Noticeably, one I had never gotten over was the same dream I had the night of my last post. 



Figures, thin and wrong, taking me from my bed and pulling me into the sky. Their slick skin holding me down as they peeled me open layer by layer, inspecting each carefully, only to be forced to repeat the filleting after the flesh grew back. My head was removed from my shoulders and awake to watch as they sampled me, refining their pallet. The worst part was they found me a delicacy. 



Of all my dreams, that one made my body soak with sweat and my heart sprint. Being enjoyed by another thing. Unfortunately, I’m too smart for my own good and understood what this meant. 



“Tony girl, eat up.” She still refused to eat the overpriced wet food, but was more than happy to inhale a bowl of ground beef. As she slobbered away, I readied my arsenal. 



Honey Lavender Shampoo, Mint Coat Oil, Coconut Paw Scrub, Peanut Butter Protective Toothpaste, Aloe Ear Lotion, and most dangerous of all, Doggie Soft Butt Wipes. Tony side eyed the empty room as she ate. Pulling away from her empty bowl to search the room. For upstairs she heard the faintest crinkle of a bag, her treat bag. Like a rocket she flew up the stairs and burst into the bathroom to see the bag balanced on the edge of the tub. She staked over to into and bumped the bag to the ground with her snoot. The door shut just as she realized the bag was empty.



“It's the end of the line, pooch. You’re getting in that tub.” I clutched the shampoo tightly as Tony lowered her stance like she was ready to pounce. “Don’t try it. It won’t work this time.” She leapt at me, tongue first. My back slammed against the door and she licked my face. “Nope! No! You won’t win!” I swept her back legs and spun on to her back, picking her up and dropping her into the bathtub. I lathered her fur with shampoo as she mean-mugged me. I had to refill the water 5 times from the amount of blood and dirt in her coat. She didn’t protest for long and even fussed after I stopped scrubbing her paws with the purple solution.



Drying her off was the next war I had to wage. I fought each of her attempts to shake and even employed a blow dryer to finish the job. “Good fight.” I shook her paw. “Here.” The Milk Bone barely left my pocket before she had already snatched it. “Good dog, go on, get.” I patted her on the rear as I opened the bathroom door. 



A lance of high frequency hit and exploded my eardrum. Blood poured out of my ear and vomit spilled onto the ground. “Starting a little soon.” I grunted. I was quick to clean up and was able to hear again after a few seconds. It was coming that night. I just knew it. I knew that no matter what I did, I was gonna get taken. All I could do was prepare. I carved open my stomach and put blades under my organs, tools of many varieties stuffed into layers of fat on my sides, and hid a P320 zip tied to my rib cage. Immortality is a curse to most people, personally despite how much I love my father I made him a promise that’d be the one to kill him and he promised the same but jokes on him, and if I’m not afraid to lose him then I doubt I would be for anyone.



After bleaching the blood and letting my organ settle around the blades, I got ready for bed. After showering and perfuming I found myself unable to go up the stairs to bed. I was stunned at my rigidity. Metal stirred in my guts but even the knowledge I was prepared wasn't enough. “Tony girl. Help me.” She looked at me for a moment, then gently stepped up to the stairs. I placed my hand on her back and kept it there as I slowly followed her up to my bedroom. I let go of her back as I pulled the covers over myself. At the tree line, the deer watched me. The sight of that let me take my first breath in minutes. I still had no clue what it was, but I knew it helped me. It helped Tony. So I trusted it.



The cloud of sleep enveloped me and soon I was gone, beyond the veil of dream.



I wasn’t even surprised when I woke up to belligerent white lights flooding my vision. Fluorescent may not be the word, but it’s the closet description I can provide. Figures stood, cutting out bulb-like shapes in the cascading light. My wrists twitched and caught against the metal clamps holding my limbs down. My fingers dug into and tore open my palms as a slender finger outstretched and probed my face. The prodding was thorough, testing the tender and fattiness of each location. The finger slid to my lips, pressing and pinching them. I went to bite the finger, but realized whatever laundry list of things they did to me before my waking must have included injecting me with a cocktail of paralyzing agents.



After finishing probing my face, they moved to my arms and torso, then my legs and delicates. “Not much meat.” A humming and loose voice spoke. *“Very above average, actually.”* I thought as they commented on my calves. 



They returned to my stomach. “Fatty, start here.” One spoke to another. “*Dick, I’m on a bulk- start here? Fuck…”* A thin wire dragged along my belly, peeling off a thin sheet of skin. A scream bubbled in my throat but couldn’t burst into existence. My breathing turned into hyper-ventilation and my heart slammed against my rib cage. The light obscured their expressions, but it was obvious one took note. It leaned down and pressed its hearing organ against my chest. “Scared.” It reported to another. 



“Calm it, the fear will ruin the meat.” Its constituent responded.



“Human. Breath. Take peace in knowing your meaningless existence was given purpose by the lottery of our random selection.” If I could have spit I would have hawked one into the thing’s eye. Sure, life was a bit purposeless after getting my retirement from being the government’s personal harvester, but my land had enough spice, I didn’t need the universe dropping this on me as a treatment for the occasional boredom or thousand yard stare.



“Astounding.” One of them muttered and I jeered silently. Of all the meat bags they could have grabbed, they grabbed the immortal one. I watched as they split the sheet of skin between the two or three of them. Each took a sommelier-sniff and set the sacred flesh on their equivalent of tongues. “Delicate yet gritty. It has such a tender-aged bite to it, I’m getting notes of war and killer instinct. It’s divine. What a deep oaky flavor, wisps of coffee, gunpowder, and… Tangerine. Delectable.” 



*“Oh fuck me.”* I groaned to myself.



In the void of space, under the beat of clinical luminescence, it’s nearly impossible to judge time. Thankfully you don’t spend 3 weeks in Chinese caves systems without learning to track your precise internal clock. 3 hours of their relentless sampling and babbling had passed before they finally stopped. Despite this, the time felt like decades. I’ve endured tortures beyond endless imagination, but none have gotten as close to breaking me as having to lay and listen to those fuckers talk about the “notes” and “nuances” of the taste of my skin. I taste like pork. I know I taste like pork. I happen to know that I pair greatly with some garlic and basil. Don’t compare me to oak and gunpowder or what-the-hell-ever, it’s downright offensive. 



After their agonizing circle-jerk of uppity sampling, they clicked off the lights and left the room. With the lights finally off, I could take deeper account of the room. The ceiling was a smooth and hospital-bland white with light projecting circles dotted on the vertices of a pentagon shaped window with a faint chip in the crystal glass.



Multicolored, blot peppered space filled the infinite view. I can’t imagine how I was surprised by this. I was out, alone in the void. 



My blood was laced with a bounty of otherworldly drugs and chemicals. My veins wriggled like they were full of maggots. My heart was steady and my breathing was measured. I needed to move. If I could get back my ability to move at least I could dislocated my fingers and deglove my hands to get out. I started breathing heavier, forcing my heart to speed up. I exerted and forced each in and exhale. I felt moisture gather under the clamps as I started sweating. The sweat was green and thick as it was forced out of the pores. It started with a twitch in my finger tips, as movement reached the first knuckle I flexed my finger rapidly. Then it reached my wrist and I flexed and flapped each hand. I didn’t know how long I had but I needed to sweat out as much of these drugs as I could. 



The moment I had enough movement, I pulled my hands through the clamps. The flesh of my hands peeled off and loose strings of muscle tissue flopped about before healing back into place under fresh skin. I was able to operate my toes by the time I gripped my- above average sized- calves and ripped my feet out. The left foot came completely off but returned promptly. 



Taking in the room I made two assessments. One: Whether by stupidity or ego, they had no cameras in the room. Two: I wasn't alone. 



4 halls, in line with sides of the pentagonal window on the ceiling, sprawled in multi-mile long galleries of still and weakly whimpering aliens. There must have been hundreds of thousands of complex lives strung up and routinely harvested. Liquid and gelatinous lifeforms swirled in sealed tubes with taps at their base. The bodies were marred with thin scars where they removed flesh and organs for feast. The flesh itself was fragile and sloppily healed, like the meat was stapled back on over and over. If the things that took me were advanced enough to traverse the stars looking for “nuanced flavors.” they were probably good at keeping their stock full. 



Blood flooded the metallic floor and my organs cascaded in hot pursuit. “Come on, give it up.” I wheezed and grunted as I rummaged around the blades and tools throughout my organs and tissues. “Why the fuck did I use heavy duty zip ties?” I coughed. The zip tie around my rib finally snapped and the P320 fell onto my liver on the ground. When you’re stuffing your body with weapons to use against aliens who are going to kidnap and eat you, it feels like a lot, but once you take it all out you regret how little shit you actually brought. The blades I had brought were two box cutters, the tools were a wire saw and a garden spade, and sure I had the P320 but I forgot a second magazine. 



Kids, if you end up immortal and have premonitions of being kidnapped by aliens: Make sure you back a window breaker of some kind and extra ammo for whatever gun you bring. I recommend putting the extra mags under your intestines. 



I started stuffing my organs back into place when a spark plug was spat out from under a kidney. “When the hell did that slip in?” My ribs clicked back into place and the blood caking me soaked into my body. Lacking a belt, I cut pockets into my thigh and holstered the box cutters and the spark plug. 



The door which I heard them leave through was perplexing, as I’m sure more alien tech is. The door required a strange appendage to be scanned for the door to open. The print was like a human hand but longer and bony thin. “If I had to bet…” I trailed off into thought, turning my sights to the gallery halls. How long does a species take to dedicate themselves to the complexities of cuisine till they sample their own? Not long I suppose. 



4 bodies deep into the north east hall was a creature matching the appearance and appendage of the others that had sampled me. I took the garden spade and lopped off its hand. With a wet slap and chime the scanner turned some shade of red and the door opened. “Well… Damn.” A command deck with hundreds of bipedal, wet, grey, thin, and tall Graymen was still in shock. “Truce?” A horrid screech filled the room and from the thin, membranous flesh around the tips of their fingers peeled back and razor sharp bone nails were exposed. More concerning than  their transformation, was what was coming into view through the command deck window.



A luminary pillar of raging opulent gluttony crested into sight. The yellow spatters of aurum light spewed and stained space. A vomit of comic resplendence, the collective piece meal of a million million minds and many more hands. A plant dwarfing bastion of a prestigious and loquacious species. No diamond or pearl equaled one/ one trillionth of the billowing glow. A space station the size of Jupiter, the mother ship.



Nails sank through my skull and split my head in two. Blood flowed down my shoulders and then lavender blood splashed over my hand as I drove the spade into the Grayman’s throat. “I do not, have ever, nor will ever have notes of tangerine!” Another stepped up to bat and took a box cutter to the stomach. Its noodle guts spilled out and I grappled the wrists of a falling claw. I rolled between its legs, leapt onto its shoulders, tied the guts around its throat, pulled, and sent its hand through its face. “3 years of improv classes, Grace me now.” I ran my tongue against my teeth while getting hacked apart and returning the brutality. *“Escape pod, no they’ll just come for me once I get home. Steal the ship, nope they’ll track it and find me… Ram it? Don’t know about comedy, but solutions certainly do come in 3s.”*



They say insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting a new result, but I’ll be damned if smashing your head against a brick wall till the wall caves doesn’t pair wonderfully with immortality. The spade got eaten, the box cutters melted from the Graymen’s box-cutter-dissolving blood, and the P320 was empty at just the perfectly wrong moment. The back of my skull blew open as I was slammed to the ground and dog-piled. “None of you would be interested in a recess would you?” My face got crushed. *“No gun, no weapons, jack-squat…Well, every closed door opens a window… Window!”* Yeah, I had a 80’s crime thriller epiphany, I’m not ashamed to admit it, try it some time.



The great thing about accidentally getting a spark plug inside your guts: it gives you a great window breaker that can be used even while getting mauled by aliens.



I fished the spark plug out from my pocket carved into my thigh. I fumbled it between my teeth and cracked off the ceramic body. I dug out one of the chunks from my gums and waited for an opening. The sea parted and in exodus an ordained ceramic chunk flew towards paradise. The Ozymandias hand of panic eyed Grayman leapt for the escaping fragment. The same time I ran out of biblical metaphor, the window chipped then shuddered away screaming into the mother void. 



My blood vessels and eyes exploded, regenerating in time for me to catch a death grip of the throttle handle. The gray flew into space, exploding as their blood boiled was dragged out of them. The run of air struggled against my regeneration to rip my arm out of socket. The pressure drained from the ship until silence filled it in its entirety. 



The ship jittered as the thrusters belched. I crawled through zero-gravity towards a star map in the center of the command room. “*Earth, Earth, Earth, come on, no whammies.”* Intuition guided my finger, spelling out what I hoped would be home. A line of dotted hope stretched through the image of the galaxy connecting me to home. I committed the direction to memory then climbed. I dragged myself out of the window, carefully stalking along the outside to the point I planned to leap from. 



The mother ship's lights ran crimson, a flashing red that was meant to alert its population to their coming demise. They say it only took 6 miles of rock to eradicate all life on earth however many millions of years ago. As I pushed off the stampeding ship, I wondered how the mothership would fare against a crescent shaped hunk of metal, 11 miles wide, many times denser than granite, charging at a light-chasing speed.



I prayed a quick prayer for the souls chained up in the ship. The mother ship flashed then liquified into asteroids of super heated metal. An explosion so visceral it split atoms and compounded its own destruction. Flames that licked the tail of heaven and stepped on the head of hell vaporized two neighboring planets, spilling out dust and magma into the great cradle of all things. The mothership’s artificial atmosphere facilitated a shock wave that, while helpful when it came to my speed, turned me into a fine mist. 



The journey was long. I grazed the pull of black holes and witnessed unmarked nebulas roil, pregnant with baby stars. I froze and boiled, occasionally at the same time. I was lucky to dodge spiraling asteroid belts, but wasn’t lucky enough to avoid plunging though a bright blue star. I’d mark it down as a positive though. My body went from vaporizing while working with Sisyphean will to reform, to mending before I got so much as a sunburn. By the measure of my trusty internal clock, I rocketed through space for about  3 days. Of all the sights I perused along my gallery walk of the galaxy, the most divine was a star being inhaled by a blackhole. The menagerie of colors and the rivers of fission was something no hand or computer could respect with the finest paint brush, most flowery of language, or complex of generation systems. 



While that may be the most beautiful moment of the trip, the best was getting pasted as I touched down on my beloved mother Earth. 



Two hitchhikes, one bus, and a short walk later, I was home. As fast as you read that sentence, the time passed. All of that cosmic travel for a 5 hour trip till I was able to pet a very anxious and excited Tony. I think the term is: Hollow Victory. I was happier than anyone to be home, but now that I was, I was disappointed. For so long my purpose was killing people who threatened the safety of the people for the French Foreign Legion and Delta Force, then it was being the government hole-patcher, then it was Tony. But Tony had joined the routine. I loved her, but learning to take care of her wasn’t a challenge anymore- beside the weekly bath. The supernatural threats, though terrible and draining, were giving variety to my life which lacked such. As I petted Tony’s head, I came to realize that if these nightmares ever did stop: I’d be more lost than ever.



Nah, I’m fucking with you. You should see the look on your face, I sure wish I could. I spent decades as a killer and now I got to enjoy my fucking land and I wanted to enjoy it dammit. “Aw, oh, wee, I hate having a steady routine that is peaceful and beautiful land.” Yeah right. What I hated was having to wait weeks for the next nightmare to come to life. I wanted these damn things dead ASAP so I could sit on my porch and sip coffee while petting Tony for the rest of my life. 



“What do you think… Anything I could do to speed things up a bit?” I asked the deer who was now, after 4 days of me being back on Earth, comfortable joining me and Tony on the porch for coffee. I rubbed its nose against its hoof. “Blood sacrifice maybe? Know a good goat or lamb dealer?” It licked the wood planks of the porch. “My uncle Jacob might know a guy… I need you to hurry!” I yelled to the woods.



“That won’t help none.” The deer looked me in my widening eyes.



“Huh?”



And that’s all for part 4 folks. Bit sudden, I know but a threat unlike that I’ve ever seen– Tony swan in mud– has just made its presence known and it requires my full and immediate attention.

After putting myself on the waitlist for a bar seat at red hook tavern (I really wanted a post-ikea wedge salad), I stumbled into Pitt's - just a block down van brunt. Peeping into the window I saw two glowing plastic geese behind a bar, and, without any prior knowledge of what this place was, walked in for dinner. 

Unaware of the back bar, I sat at the counter. I was served by the (owner?) partner of chef jeremy salamon, who sold me their signature martini - a take on a gibson with gentian. This was good. I ordered a half dozen oysters and green rice grit with crispy chicken skin. 

**THINGS I LOVED:**

* diner-style drip coffee behind the bar. how i started my meal. AND FREE BREAD ROLLS!
* the vision is honed the fuck in. described to me as ""2001 north carolina"". Think rooster chef figurines and booths with ruffled valence curtains in between. 
* Generally attentive service. Shout out the MD for being so kind.
* the kitchen is between the front and back halves of the restaurant; guests are walking past the pass and a chalk 86 board to get to the bathroom. i appreciate that.
* Oysters were awesome. Smoky tomato situation on top. really gorg. 
* Calvados on the menu to finish my meal. Yum. 

**THINGS I DID NOT LOVE:**

* servers wearing those CIA-ass ear pieces. idk, takes away the neighborhood spot vibe for me.
* the wine list is doing what everyone else is doing. Natural french wine. This is coming from someone who works at a natural french wine bar. I'm over it! IE Lots of Jean Pierre Rietsch. You're going for early oughts south! Bring on some american wine! There's loads of good natural american wine!
* Cocktails with no one liners. This is obviously an intentional choice to encourage guests to ask servers about the cocktail list, but I would prefer to at least know the base spirit in a drink as I see it on the menu.
* The rice grit was decent, but could be refined. Chicken skin and mint were in large pieces that did not eat well bite-per-bite.
* Stilted service. Def feels like it's been open for 4 months. Server lacked graceful communication of cocktail knowledge. Maybe they just need to get the reps in. 

**OVERALL:**

I think this could be the perfect neighborhood restaurant. It feels as though there is a rift between the design and the execution (because the design is perfect). Lean more into the thematic vision and get the reps in to give guests great anticipatory/graceful service. It's almost there. Thanks for reading!",3,1745801283.0,FoodNYC,0,0.8,False

So I’ve (34F) been talking to this guy (43M) that my friend fixed me up with about two weeks ago. We have a lot in common and body want the same things for our future, so today we finally met. 

We had a 3 1/2 hour date that started with sushi, then he suggested we get coffee and go for a walk around the marina. The conversation was flowing easily with so many topics, lots of smiling and laughing. It was really lovely and then when he dropped me off at my car he gave me a hug and said twice “We’ll be in touch”. It’s been almost an hour and a half, I haven’t heard from him and I usually hear from a guy not too long after the end of the date. I’m just sitting here thinking “What did I say or do wrong?”

He’s 43 years old and that’s old enough to know if you’re going to book the second date. It’s also his first date date since his divorce finalized over a year ago, which I didn’t know he was divorced until he told me today. My mom and bestie both think that’s playing a factor into this as well.

I’ve been struggling with my weight a bit (currently 30+ pounds down so I’m working at it) and I’m in freelance writing so I think those are detriments against me dating wise, but other than that I KNOW I am a catch. I am secure in myself that I am a beautiful, intelligent, funny, sexy and talented woman with a big heart and a lot to give. I’ve had my fun and I’m done playing the field, I want something serious. 

Anyways, I just needed to vent and hopefully can get some support back.

When my GP wanted me to get tested, I thought he was overreacting. My symptoms are delayed periods and weight that won't go down. I didn't think it would be PCOS because I'd had an internal ultrasound/sonography (or whatever it's called) and it didn't show any signs of cysts or anything. Literally my report was completely normal. I'm so ashamed and irritated at this diagnosis I haven't even told my family yet. 

The specialist I spoke to offered to give me metformin/inositol (I think that's what they're called?) but I declined because I don't want to take even more medicines (I take meds for migraines and I don't want to have to worry about interactions or more side effects). He also referred me to a dietitian and I haven't made an appointment yet. I know that I should, I'm still kind of avoiding It and not taking it seriously. I feel like I know what the dietitian's going to say. She'll say I need to cut down on carbs and sugar. I already know that because diabetes runs in my family. I've been told to do this for years and I have *struggled so hard.* Despite my best intentions, and I have tried.

Every time I try and reduce sugar, I get these intense cravings for sweet food. I know it's partly habit, right? The body craves what it expects or smth. I love sweet food too, it's one of my great joys. I love dessert, sweet coffees, etc. Everything delicious in this world is sweet. Boba tea? Chocolate? Cake? Ice cream? Those matcha fraps at the cafes that I love?? They bring me genuine joy. I'm really upset that I'm going to have to stop having them. Sugarless drinks don't taste good to me.

Btw, it's not even like I have excessively sweet food. I take one spoon of sugar with my coffee, and whenever I get drinks in cafes it's usually with 1 sugar or 50% sweetness. But I know that the frequency is also the issue, I have this stuff very often.

And then there's carbs, which I find so frustrating because not only are carbs delicious, they're cheap and extremely convenient. On a busy weeknight, the easiest meal I can do is pasta, or a quick rice/noodle stir fry. I do make a conscious choice to include protein, but I really enjoy the carb component. A single bag of rice may cost $20 but it will feed you 3 times a day for a month or more. For $20, you'd be lucky to get 2 packs of chicken, and it won't stay fresh for a long time either. I feel like doctors/healthcare experts just expect you to print money when they give you this advice. I know they mean well, and I know that's what the science says, but it's so fucking frustrating. I try to incorporate beans and lentils into my food since they're cheaper. I'm South Asian, so genetically I'm kind of fucked when it comes to IR and diabetes (it's very very common for South Asians), and so I try and rely on lentils and stuff but even then, for those dishes, *you need carbs.* A bowl of dal and veggies will not fill your stomach without a bowl of rice to go with it.

I just feel so upset. I should just speak to the dietician bc she's the professional and I'm sure she'll have good advice, but I love to eat, I love food, and it just feels like one of my life's pleasures has been yanked out from under me. I don't know how I'm going to stop eating sugar. I don't even know if I'm capable of it. I know this is all kind of childish and I'm avoiding my problems. I'll deal with it...eventually.

Ok, here it goes: 

It was July 17 2019. I don’t remember much the day in question. I don’t remember what I was wearing, how my hair was parted, anything. All I remember, were the memories: 

My grandmother, Grammie, would stay up late to watch cops. She would wake up early to make coffee, watch the news, and never complain, she would…treat a stranger to a greeting. She always made room for the baseball games, professional, and her grandchildren. Boy did she love her Red Sox. 

This had gotten a little quieter since pa passed 6 years ago. I miss him more and more, I was 10, now 16, and wonder if he would like what I’ve done with my life. But my Grammie, she was, fine, calm, hell she got 46 years with the man, and I only got 10, I’m ashamed to say I was mad at god a little for that, don’t worry we patched it up. We were, Grammie and I, partners in crime, she’s the only person who knew I took my bike on a main road, and then proceeded to almost get hit by car. Anyway, she made me happy, we went everywhere together, I’d push my mother out of the way to give her a hug, nothing felt warmer than her embrace. 

I can go on and on and on about everything I’ve ever heard from her, and everything we did, like I said it’s a long story. 16 years. That’s how long it took me to realize that she was the opposite of selfish, she love everything and everyone, but most of all, she loved me. ME, out of everyone in this world, I’m the one she chooses to share a box of pierogies with. I thought to myself on 01/21/2019, my birthday, “when I graduate that’s when I show her, how much I loved her, we’re going to Disney, we’ll see Mickey. Just us” 

But then she got sick, really, really sick. I had never seen someone that sick. Walking into her hospital room that May afternoon, all I did was cry, I cried for 3 hours silently. When I finally stop I realize it wasn’t 3 hours. It was 7, the worst part was leaving. I don’t remember how I got home.

Then that day came. The day I knew, but buried in my head. They lied to me. “We’re just going in to see her again” dad said, knowing they already made a big decision. I sat there while I watch the only person that believed in me, Loved me, trusted me, my Grammie, die. 2:41 pm that was all I remember. The time it happened. That and what I call the feeling. The feel of that warm embrace, it was gone. Thats when I broke. I gave her one more hug and it felt cold, I dropped, fell rather to the floor.  Sobbing, that embrace that made me smile and get comfort, was gone. They, my family, lifted me up and carried me out as I clawed at the bed handle begging for ONE. MORE. DAY. Now, officially everything, was in the past. 

Six years later, I have a good job. I can drive. My daughter stared first grade. And most of all, I’ve finished himym many time over the years. 

This year marks 6 years, 12 since pa died and 6 since Grammie. I have the tradition, taken from Stella crater. Order two drinks, one for me, and one for Grammie, drink mine, and when I finish raise the glass into the air and say “I love you Grammie, where ever you are.” And leave the other full glass for her in the after life.  
I understand if you don’t read it all. I understand if you think this has nothing to do with Ted. But I connected that episode to my life in a way that I can’t explain, but feel.  I apologize if it’s too long and I appreciate if you did read it, it makes me happy knowing people know the person she was. 


Good luck Grammie wherever you are

It be nasty.

I drink daily coffee and tea out of the same travel mug. Over time it builds up with that coffee and especially a tea coating that is brown and disgusting.

Some of you might think - (1) bottle brush, (2) steel wool and a stick, or (3) something of the sort - but no. None of these work. The only thing I've found that actually works is using a wire attachment for a drill but it scares me because I dont want to accidentally swallow a little piece of wire ([see BBQ brushes](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/metal-bristle-barbecue-brush-1.6518641)).

I'm pretty cheap and don't like throwing things out if they can be cleaned. I also understand I could shop for a wider body mug that I could stick my hand into with steel wool and scrub out, but just wondering if any of you cleaning whizzes have any tips or ideas.

Elizabeth ""Ellie"" Gage wasn’t the type of person who stood out in a crowd, and she'd spent most of her life trying to avoid being noticed at all. Her dark brown hair, always a little too messy to be neat, and her round, brown eyes were easily overlooked in the sea of students that filled her college campus. To most, she blended in with the beige walls and faded posters, a quiet background character in her own life.

But Ellie was used to that. She was good at it.

She had always been good at blending. Good at hiding.

It wasn’t that Ellie lacked ambition—she had just never been sure where to focus it. She had tried, briefly, to be a biology major. She liked the idea of helping people, of making sense of the world, but the biology department had its own idea of what success looked like, and Ellie didn’t quite fit into that vision. So, she tried something else. Then another. Then another. Until all that was left was uncertainty, and the quiet resignation that perhaps she didn’t belong in any of the places she’d been.

By the time she boarded the Greyhound bus home for the summer holidays, she had made the decision. She was done. She had dropped out. She couldn’t bring herself to say the words to her parents, but they’d see it when she came through the door. The truth, plain as day, in the way she carried herself, in the absence of her shiny new degree.

The holidays were always supposed to be a time for family—getting together, sharing stories, and laughing around a table. But Ellie wasn’t coming home for the holidays this year. She was coming home to deliver news. The news that, in her mind, had been inevitable for months: that the life she’d tried to build for herself at college wasn’t hers. It wasn’t meant to be.

She sat on the bus, staring out the window at the roads that blurred by. The grey sky matched the color of the asphalt beneath, both heavy and unyielding. Ellie closed her eyes for just a moment, the hum of the bus soothing in a way she hadn’t expected, and before she knew it, the hours slipped by like water over rocks.

When Ellie awoke, the first thing she noticed was the unnatural stillness. Her head ached, a familiar fuzziness from too many hours of sleep, but that was nothing new. It was the silence that unsettled her.

The bus, which had been humming steadily along just a few hours ago, was now completely motionless. She blinked, trying to shake off the remnants of sleep, and glanced out the window. Instead of the highway stretching on before her, she saw only a dusty, empty street. Buildings stood in neat rows, their facades weathered but sturdy. There were no cars. No people.

Ellie sat up with a jolt. The sun—if that’s what it was, though the sky was an unbroken stretch of black—hovered just above the horizon, casting a faint, dim glow over everything. It was as though it had forgotten how to shine. It almost looked like a solar eclipse if not for how bright it was.

Her heart began to race as she peered around the bus. The seats were empty. Every single one. The overhead lights flickered weakly, and for a moment, Ellie wondered if she was still dreaming. She pinched herself, her skin stinging from the cold air, but it did nothing to answer her questions.

*Where was everyone?*

She grabbed her phone, her fingers numb as she scrolled through the dead screen. No signal. She tried calling her parents, then her best friend, but the call failed each time. The buzzing of her own pulse was louder than the phone’s empty ring tone.

The bus doors opened with a soft hiss, and Ellie stepped out into the street, her boots hitting the cracked asphalt with an odd finality. The town around her looked perfectly normal. No signs of destruction, no obvious reason why it had emptied out. It was like someone had simply forgotten to turn the lights on.

""Hello?"" Her voice cracked as it broke through the silence, but no one answered.

She walked toward a small café, the windows fogged over as if someone had just cleaned them. The door was unlocked, the bell above it jingling faintly as she stepped inside. The smell of stale coffee hung in the air, and there, on a table by the window, sat a half-finished cup. Steam curled up from the mug, as if the person who had been drinking it had only just stood up to leave.

The chair was still pulled out, the thin grooves in the wood from where it had been dragged across the floor.

Ellie felt a chill run through her. She looked around the room, hoping for a sign, some indication of where everyone had gone. But all she could see were empty chairs, untouched plates of food, and the hum of silence that pressed in from all sides.

She couldn’t remember how long she stood there, staring at the empty town around her. But the longer she stood, the clearer it became: there was no one here. No one left to help.

Ellie’s fingers fumbled over her phone as she tried to dial her mother’s number. Her hands were shaking—whether from the cold or something deeper, she couldn’t tell. She held the phone to her ear, waiting for the reassuring ring, the familiar sound that would bring her back to reality.

But the ring didn’t come.

Instead, the phone vibrated once, twice, and then fell silent.

“Hello?” Ellie spoke into the device, her voice trembling, too soft in the stillness of the empty street.

There was a pause. Then a distorted whisper, so quiet at first that she thought she had imagined it.

*Don’t turn back...*

Ellie’s breath caught in her throat, her pulse thudding in her ears. She pressed the phone closer to her ear, as if that would bring the voice into sharper focus. Maybe it was a prank, or just some weird glitch.

“Hello?” she tried again, more forcefully this time. “Mom? Dad? Is anyone there?”

*Don’t turn back... don’t turn back...*

The voice came again, the words stretching out, warped and unrecognizable, but unmistakable. The whispering grew louder, distorting into something unintelligible, as if the phone itself was groaning in protest, the sound rattling through the speaker like a broken machine.

Her heart thumped in her chest. She yanked the phone away from her ear, but the whisper didn’t stop. It only grew more frantic, repeating the same words over and over, the voice now a crackling hiss that seemed to seep from the very air around her.

*Don’t turn back...*

The words were heavy, pressing down on her chest, choking the breath from her lungs. Ellie’s hands were clammy as she frantically ended the call, but the whisper lingered in the quiet, like an echo she couldn’t shake.

For a moment, Ellie just stood there, staring at the blank screen, the silence now somehow more deafening than it had been before. She swallowed hard, her throat dry, and glanced around the street. It was still empty, still silent. The world felt... wrong. As if something was watching her from the shadows.

But there was nothing.

Just the whisper.

And the unsettling thought that maybe, just maybe, the world had turned its back on her long before she’d ever gotten off that bus.

Ellie’s mind was racing, but her body moved mechanically, as though it had already accepted the truth her mind refused to. She had to keep moving. She had to find someone—anyone.

The town stretched out before her, its streets empty and silent. There were no footprints in the dust, no sign of recent activity. The air was thick with an unsettling stillness, like the place was holding its breath.

She walked past rows of houses, peeking through windows that showed nothing but abandoned rooms, curtains drawn tight as if the homes had been forgotten in a hurry. But the most unsettling thing wasn’t the absence of people—it was the little things that didn’t make sense. The half-eaten dinner on a table, a child’s bike abandoned in the middle of the sidewalk, the door of a small shop wide open, as if someone had left in the middle of their workday, leaving everything untouched.

Her legs grew tired, but she couldn’t stop. She needed answers.

As she turned the corner onto a quieter street, something caught her eye. A flash of metal—polished chrome and twisted wreckage—shining dully in the dim light. She froze.

A car.

The car had crashed into a light pole, its front end crumpled like paper, smoke still curling up from the engine, but the strange part was... the driver's side door was wide open. There was no one in the seat. No sign of the driver anywhere.

Ellie walked cautiously toward the wreckage, her breath catching in her throat. The car was an old sedan, something that looked like it had been well-maintained before whatever had happened. The airbags had deployed, the front windshield shattered, but the driver—whoever they were—was gone.

She kneeled beside the car, peering inside. A bag lay on the passenger seat, still zipped up. A coffee cup rested in the cup holder, its contents long spilled, the dark liquid staining the seat beneath it. The engine continued to sputter, barely alive, as if the world hadn’t yet caught up with what had happened.

The strangest thing, though, was the car’s position. The driver had clearly been heading toward town, but there was no skid mark, no sign that the person had tried to stop or swerve. They had simply... vanished. In the middle of driving.

Ellie stood and glanced around, hoping for some kind of explanation. Maybe the person had run off after the crash, but the street was empty. No footprints leading away from the wreck. Just more emptiness.

She could feel the weight of the world pressing on her chest again. The hairs on the back of her neck stood up, and she took a step back, her hands trembling.

*Where did they go?*

The thought lingered in her mind as she took a few shaky steps away from the crash. A voice, faint but distinct, echoed in her thoughts, *Don’t turn back...* It sent another chill down her spine.

Ellie felt her pulse quicken, the silence growing louder around her. She had to keep moving. Had to find out what happened. What *was* happening. But the more she searched, the more she felt like the town was closing in on her, like the answer was out of her reach.

Ellie stood there, staring at the empty driver’s seat, her chest tightening as she tried to make sense of what she was seeing. The wrecked car, the missing person, the silence—it was all too much, too impossible. She could feel the world unraveling at the edges, like the fabric of reality was beginning to fray, and there was nothing she could do to stop it.

Her legs felt like they might give out at any moment, the weight of it all pressing down on her. Every step she had taken since waking up in that bus had led her further into a nightmare. There was no one. Not here. Not anywhere. She was alone. Completely alone.

And the worst part? She wasn’t even sure when it had happened. When the world had stopped turning. Had it been days? Hours? She couldn't tell anymore.

Her breath caught in her throat as the truth finally settled over her, like a cold wave crashing down. There was no one left. No one to call, no one to run to, no one to help.

The tears came then, sharp and sudden, burning her eyes as they spilled over. She sank to her knees in the dust, her body trembling with the weight of her isolation. The ground felt strangely solid beneath her, but it didn’t make sense. None of it made sense.

She reached out a hand, touching the twisted metal of the car’s wreckage, her fingers brushing against the still-warm metal, as if the car had somehow just been abandoned in the blink of an eye. She closed her eyes and let her hand fall limply to the ground, her chest heaving with each breath.

“Where are you?” she whispered into the air, her voice hoarse and broken. There was no answer. Just the hollow sound of the wind, the distant hum of the wreck’s sputtering engine.

The world had emptied itself, and Ellie was the last person standing in its wake. It didn’t matter how much she searched, how much she called out for someone—anyone. The world was gone. The people were gone. And Ellie, in that moment, was nothing but a shadow of someone who had once had a place in it.

Her heart felt like it was being squeezed in a vice, her mind a whirl of confusion and grief. She fell forward, her forehead pressing against the dusty ground in front of the wrecked car, as the sobs wracked through her body. It was too much. It was too impossible.

But the tears didn’t stop. And the silence didn’t break.

1k9iure,https://i.redd.it/1czqghit0hxe1.png,"This small ""altered or synthetic content"" tag that you need to click into the description to even see is not blatant enough for videos (particularly music)","I was getting into this one music channel this past week. Really liked listen to their hour long lofi albums in the background. I want to add, the only reason I started listening to them in the first place was they were non-stop appearing in my sidebar, so I thought they must've been pretty quality or something to keep getting pushed so hard when that's not even my usual style of music.


And then I noticed... wow, they upload OFTEN. Like, too often. They apparently make a full new album every two days?? That can't be right... So I decided to check the description for what the heck is going on because I was starting to get suspicious of AI generated music being at play. No where in their channel description does it say their stuff is AI generated (but they made sure to have their ""Buy Me a Coffee"" page link available, apparently). In none of their video descriptions is there mention of it either. And then I go back to their very first video and finally see it. This thing in the description. Not even something they disclosed themselves, it's a little tag they must've clicked when uploading the video.


This is NOT noticable enough. People in the comments (if they're even real comments too, I don't even know at this point) are praising them for the music and the channel just goes along with it like they've made it themselves! People, especially those that end up donating to their Buy Me a Coffee page, deserve to know that this channel is uploading AI generated music. Please, this type of content needs to have a way more obvious label on it that it's AI.

Then I saw it, the connection. I talked about it a little but, but man, what I would do for even ONE more day. It’s a long story. 

Then Ted asked for the 45 days.  But what if it wasn’t 45. What is it was one. 
 And I promise it connects, here it goes: 


It was July of 2019. I don’t remember much the day in question. I don’t remember what I was wearing, how my hair was parted, any thing. All I remember, were the memories: 

My grandmother, Grammie, would stay up late to watch cops. She would wake up early to make coffee, watch the news, and never complain, she would…treat a stranger to a greeting. She always made room for the baseball games, professional, and her grandchildren. Boy did she love her Red Sox. 

This had gotten a little quieter since pa passed 6 years ago. I miss him more and more, I was 10, now 16, and wonder if he would like what I’ve done with my life. But my Grammie, she was, fine, calm, hell she got 46 years with the man, and I only got 10, I’m ashamed to say I was mad at god a little for that, don’t worry we patched it up. We were, Grammie and I, partners in crime, she’s the only person who knew I took my bike on a main road, and then proceeded to almost get hit by car. Anyway, she made me happy, we went everywhere together, I’d push my mother out of the way to give her a hug, nothing felt warmer than her embrace. 

I can go on and on and on about everything I’ve ever heard from her, and everything we did, like I said it’s a long story. 16 years. That’s how long it took me to realize that she was the opposite of selfish, she love everything and everyone, but most of all, she loved me. ME, out of everyone in this world, I’m the one she chooses to share a box of pierogies with. I thought to myself on 01/21/2019, my birthday, “when I graduate that’s when I show her, how much I loved her, we’re going to Disney, we’ll see Mickey. Just us” 

But then she got sick, really, really sick. I had never seen someone that sick. Walking into her hospital room that May afternoon, all I did was cry, I cried for 3 hours silently. When I finally stop I realize it wasn’t 3 hours. It was 7, the worst part was leaving. I don’t remember how I got home.

Then that day came. The day I knew, but buried in my head. They lied to me. “We’re just going in to see her again” dad said, knowing they already made a big decision. I sat there while I watch the only person that believed in me, Loved me, trusted me, my Grammie, die. 2:41 pm that was all I remember. The time it happened. That and what I call the feeling. The feel of that warm embrace, it was gone. Thats when I broke. I gave her one more hug and it felt cold, I dropped,  fell rather to the floor.  Sobbing, that embrace that made me smile and get comfort, was gone. They, my family, lifted me up and carried me out as I clawed at the bed handle begging for ONE. MORE. DAY. Now, officially everything, was in the past. 

Six years later, I have a good job. I can drive. My daughter stared first grade. And most of all, I’ve finished himym many time over the years. 

This is the relevance, if I had a chance to go 45 days in the past and explain what’s gonna happen in 45 days, I wouldn’t do it because you have to bring up your pain again. I can’t imagine how Ted felt in those last 45 days with Tracy, let alone the first 45 before meeting her if I knew that there were only a finite number of days left I would make every day memorable, but instead, I’m here showing you my biography portion to remind you. 
Life never stops even after death. And I don’t think Ted understood that in the moment. But he did later. Hence why he’s telling the story. He leaned that 45 days isn’t enough time. Because it’s never enough, and it never will be. But what would you do if your father or great aunt, or cousin was going to pass in 45 days? What would you do?

This year marks 6 years, 12 since pa died and 6 since Grammie. I have the tradition, taken from Stella crater. Order two drinks, one for me, and one for Grammie, drink mine, and when I finish raise the glass into the air and say “I love you Grammie, where ever you are.” And leave the other full glass for her in the after life.  
I understand if you don’t read it all. I understand if you think this has nothing to do with Ted. But I connected that episode to my life in a way that I can’t explain, but feel.  I apologize if it’s too long and I appreciate if you did read it, it makes me happy knowing people know the person she was. 

Good luck Grammie, where ever you are

Seems like they are finally going forward with a plan! 


West Sacramento’s iconic Club Pheasant would be partially redeveloped into an assortment of eateries and retail space, according to plans released late Friday by the city.

Those plans call for creating 19,900 square feet of indoor space to support up to seven restaurants, with confirmed names including Temple Coffee Roasters and Jack’s Urban Eats.

“We’re really excited to be at a point where we can share plans with the council and the community,” said Traci Michel, West Sacramento’s director of economic development and housing. “The development team has done a really good job of meeting all the city’s goals for the site.”


Michel said other tenants include an Italian bistro and a revamped version of the bar at Club Pheasant, which had more than a century of history at 2525 Jefferson Blvd. as a restaurant, watering hole and community gathering spot before its owners retired and closed it in 2022.

The bar vision comes from brothers Henry and Simon de Vere White, Michel said. The de Vere White brothers are known for operating bars in Sacramento that include Ro Sham Beaux in Midtown and The Snug on the R Street Corridor.

Henry de Vere White didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment Friday.

Other components of the plan include 10,000 square feet of outdoor space, and a 1,200-square-foot retail space where the city will have the master lease.

West Sacramento will designate that space for local retail businesses, Michel said, adding it could house more than one, and either provide more visibility for an existing business or be the first spot for an idea currently run out of someone’s home, for example.

Ram Cor Development LLC, the development group the city selected for Club Pheasant’s overhaul, includes both de Vere White brothers as well as developers Dan Ramos and Mark Cordano. Ken Turton of Turton Commercial Real Estate has consulted on the project with the city as well, while 19six Architects is the project architect.

On Wednesday, the council will vote on a purchase, sale and development agreement with Ram Cor Development for the Club Pheasant project. Ram Cor would buy the property from the city for $1.5 million, according to the city staff report, which did not disclose the total estimated project cost.

Not including construction, the site should provide about 200 jobs, Michel said. The city would also collect lease revenue on its 1,200-square-foot storefront space.

The city bought the 2.15-acre site from the Palamidessi family in 2023 for $3.4 million to keep it from being redeveloped entirely, then brought Turton Commercial in and did a request for proposals.

Michel said she believed Ram Cor is eager to start work as soon as possible, but estimated it would take six to 10 months for the group to get building plans approved.

Under the terms of the agreement, Ram Cor has two years to complete the project once construction begins.",6,1745800286.0,westsacramento,0,1.0,False

I was experiencing issues with a couple important machines. I was frustrated so I ended up cussing. I admit and in the moment admitted it was wrong of me to cuss the way I was. But I guess the girls went behind my back and told the gm I was yelling it at them and making them uncomfortable. Which I won't deny it was making them uncomfortable, will not deny that at all. Though unknown to me when I was telling them to do their jobs earlier in the shift. Mind you they were on their phones if they weren't making drinks. I wasn't giving them the chance to do the tasks I kept asking them to do before telling them to do it again. I'm sorry if I ask you to do something and 5 mintues later check in and you aren't doing it and say it again, I'm the mean one. Idk maybe someone can give me better perspective on all of this.

I had to ask her how it’s going and she said oh yeah we are watching a movie. Then I had to ask. At his house?  I have barely heard from her and honestly I’m not okay with that part.

We got coffee yesterday and hung out for an hour and a half, which felt like 30 minutes max. He’s so easy and fun to talk to, and I knew that already, but I felt it even more so outside of a work context. I’m just terrified I’m leading him on. I’m so scared I’m gonna hurt this guy, that I’m not actually into him. There’s also a part of me that thinks, “Well even if you ARE into him, he’s probably a piece of shit anyway.” Which isn’t fair.

1k9irgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/HoneySub/comments/1k9irgi/how_we_turn_breakfast_chaos_into_recurring/,🥞 How We Turn Breakfast Chaos into Recurring Revenue (AMA!),"*TL;DR: Breakfast subscriptions = packed AM crowds + 30% revenue bump. Here’s my no-BS playbook.*

---

## ☕ **1. The ""Why Bother"" Breakfast Pass**

**What To Offer:**  
✅ **Basic Plan:** 1 breakfast item + coffee daily  
✅ **Big Plan:** Hot meals + coffee daily
✅ **Office Groups:** Deliver if more than 5 people in one office signs up. 

**Why This Went Viral:**  
- 🔥 *""I already paid for it"" guilt* → Members show up 20x/month  
- 🧮 *Exact headcounts* → Cook stops yelling about wasted bacon  
- 👯♂️ *Office FOMO* → Groups sign up together (""Lisa made us do it"")  

---

## 📸 **2. Free Pumpkin Spice = 5-Star Reviews**

**Secret Sauce:**  
- ""Post your #BestMorningEver pic → **FREE seasonal drink**"" (PSL FTW!)  
- **VIP pickup zone** with sign → Normies ask ""How do I get that?!""  

*Pro Tip:* Meal boxes with **YOUR logo** → Members become billboards.

---

## � **3. The ""Dumb Simple"" Trial That Converts**

**The Script:**  
*After someone buys a breakfast:*  
**""Want this FREE today? 1-day free trial → Cancel anytime.""**  

**Upsells That Print Money:**  
- ☕ ""Double/Extra/Different  for 1-20$/month""  
- 🥪 ""Add weekend brunch for $10""  
- � ""Get 1 month FREE per coworker who joins""  

---

## 🚀 **4. How to Scale Without Going Crazy**

| Tactic | Result |  
| --- | --- |  
| **Hyper-local FB/IG ads** | Make sure you are on every screen on the block|  
| **Auto-request reviews** | Subscribers are 5 star machines |  
| **Start pricing LOW** | Stay close to cost and raise every 5 until you find the sweet spot |  

---

## 🚨 Copy-Paste This TODAY to test if it works for you without spending any money

1. Put up **""Free trial → Join Breakfast Club""** sign  
2. Train staff: *""Want breakfast for free today""* at breakfast order.  
3. Setup an automatic subscription system. 

**Why It Works:**  
- 10-minute setup  
- $0 upfront  
- Cancel anytime (you keep trial $ if they bail)  


**[HoneySub.com](https://honeysub.com/r)** 
- Automates all of this, and you could actually sell this subscription within 10 minutes without spending any money.

1k9ir8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1k9ir8h/open_source_uf2c_a_cli_tool_that_writes_commit/,🚀 [Open Source] UF2C — A cli tool that writes commit messages and daily updates based on their git diffs. Built for lazy developers (like me lols),"Hey everyone! 👋

I recently started building UF2C (v0.0.1) — a tool made by lazy people, for lazy people.

Right now, it does two main things:

* 📝 Generates commit messages using AI (because writing “fix stuff” 10 times a day gets old)
* 📋 Creates daily progress updates using the gold standards:
   * “What I did today”
   * “Challenges I faced and how I solved them”
* 💾 And it **AUTO SAVES TO CLIPBOARD** *how cool is that?*
   * *(Currently supports mac for auto copy to your clipboard)*

It’s still a work in progress — but it’s already helping me move faster and stay consistent without overthinking small stuff. *(I use it for work lols, don't tell my boss I shaved a couple of mins writing stuff 😜)*

Upcoming features I’m working on:

* Allowing custom prompt creation
* Automatically running git add . && git commit after generating a message
* Possibly renaming the project because “UF2C” is kinda confusing 😂
* Refactoring the codebase for better modularity

I'm using Go (Golang) for this (code is messy because I'm currently learning the language lol)

For anyone interested, this is a CLI tool aimed for developers, its a FOSS so you can do what you can do with any FOSS. *(FOSS - Free and Open Source Software)*

Anyways, enough babbling, here is the github repo [https://github.com/mosnamarco/uf2c](https://github.com/mosnamarco/uf2c) and do give it a star or fork it, idk, up to you!

I have problem at my current job with coworkers (accidantaly?)

Now my question is does some (preferably in europe) have the capability to make a tungsten coffe mug and if so could give me an cost estimate to make just one? Would be a standard sized mug/cup with handle around 280ml/300ml of volume.

I got a beautiful chakra card from u/old-jellyfish-7664 about the throat chakra -- incredibly fitting as my surgery just removed my thyroids! And one of the oils for this area is one of my favorites -- lavender!

Such a cute and funny sushi card came from u/tiredpantyhose...with a bunch of fun stickers too! All these Japanese foods are making me hungry! 

I got a sweet pink teddy bear card from u/mediocre_radish_7216 with lots of goodies in it, including a whale sticker that says everything Whale be ok!  

u/Thick-Combination785 helped me remember my time in England studying abroad with a London postcard. It has a picture of a double decker bus in from of Big Ben -- I have stood in that very spot!

u/TyeDyeAmish sent a postcard of another place I have been -- Universal Studios! Did you know that the same area that Jaws attacks your tram from is also Jessica Fletcher's own Cabot Cove? (If you did not already know I was ooooold...)

Such a sweet panda bear card came from u/HellaSteph! When I was growing up, my own teddy bear was a panda bear. You must have been on my same wavelength!

So we have a little pot in our LFL that I put bookmarks and book/reading-themed stickers in for peoples water bottles, kindle cases etc. Not all of our stickers are specifically for kids, some of them are geared more towards the YA readers and the adults in my opinion, but none of them are inappropriate either (I made sure to remove any… spicy ones from the selection). The ones in there that I would say are aimed at the adults are “books & coffee” or “all this reality is cutting into my reading time” in a nice font (examples in first photo). 

There are a few sweet kiddos that have brought some of their own to leave for others to enjoy, some skull and cross bones type ones, some pretty mandala ones, they’ve also left some pencil toppers and hand painted pebbles to share as well…but then there was this one (the second photo) 😬

Now, I could be massively off base, so someone please enlighten me if I am, but I did google the meaning of this one and if it means what I think it means, then it is so inappropriate for young children to be leaving. We’re talking 7-10 years old, kids choosing Diary of a Wimpy Kid books and Roald Dahl books etc. Obviously I have removed this one but I don’t want to make them feel like they can’t leave things for others, I’m just hoping they had no clue what this one meant either 🤦🏼‍♀️

## Choosing the Right Bean Bag Ottoman for YOU: A Buyer's Guide

With so many options available, choosing the right **bean bag ottoman** can feel overwhelming. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you narrow down your choices:

**1. Identify Your Needs and Preferences:**

*   **Intended Use:** Will you primarily use it as a footrest, a seat, or a side table?
*   **Room Placement:** Where will the ottoman be placed (living room, bedroom, kids' room, outdoor space)?
*   **style:** What style of décor do you prefer (modern, contemporary, bohemian, traditional)?
*   **Size:** How much space do you have available? Consider a **large bean bag chair ottoman** if you have ample space or a **small bean bag ottoman** if you're space-constrained.
*   **comfort Level:** Do you prefer a firm or soft ottoman? **Memory foam bean bag ottoman** options generally offer exceptional comfort.

**5. Consider Your Audience Segment:**

*   **Home Decor Enthusiasts:** Focus on style, material (leather, velvet), and overall aesthetics in the **living room** or **bedroom**.
*   **Parents:** Prioritize safety, ease of cleaning, and durability. Look for **kids bean bag ottoman** options.
*   **Students/Young Adults:** Focus on affordability, portability, and space-saving designs. Consider **small bean bag ottoman** options.
*   **Individuals with Back Pain/Comfort Needs:** Prioritize comfort and support. Look for **memory foam bean bag ottoman** options.
*   **Outdoor Living Enthusiasts:** Prioritize weather resistance and durability. Look for **outdoor bean bag ottoman** options.[[Explore Top Rated bean bag ottoman on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/nest-cam/?kw=bean bag ottoman)

Try this: Take a quiet moment to simply observe your breath as it goes in and out. Even a few deep breaths can make a difference.
3. Engage Your Senses: Find Joy in Details
Throughout your day, really notice what's around you. The color of a flower? The smell of your lunch? The warmth of the sun?
Why it helps: Engaging your senses brings you to the present, helping you appreciate small pleasures and boost your mood.
Try this: During a regular activity, consciously focus on what you see, hear, smell, taste, or touch.
These are just three simple ways to inject more positivity into your day. Stick with them and watch how they brighten your outlook. Stay tuned for more easy tips to cultivate a happier, more fulfilling life!

As I understand the Frigate LXC crashes the whole Proxmox server it is hosted on, and there is not yet a definite clue why.

This causes that a reboot isn't always successful because the Coral TPU might be assigned to another bus number. To tackle that problem, I have created a script that you can start whenever the Proxmox Server reboots, that changes the parameters to pass-thru the Coral TPU correctly at every reboot of the Proxmox Server.

Name your LXC container 'frigate' and only have one instance running or configured on your host and the script will do the rest when necessary! 👍🏻

Add this script to your server here: /usr/local/bin/update\_lxc\_config.sh

Run the script at every reboot

Add it to your cronjobs with

    crontab -e

and add this line:

    @reboot (sleep 60 && /usr/local/bin/update_lxc_config.sh)

Possible solution to prevent crashing

I changed my LXC config file \[container number\].conf in /etc/pve/lxc/ by get rid of unnescessary lines to end up with  a conf file like this:

I want to learn how to get it organized and growing. Tips on the best way to do that? (Long post),"We are mid 20s in South Florida. My wife started a secondhand vintage clothing boutique over two years ago and has done that as a side hustle aside from her full time job. I would like to preface by saying that I love it the business and SHE HAS ASKED ME TO DO THESE THINGS and I truly want to as I love the business and her! She is just incredibly busy so she has asked me to take charge of the finances and split the work on socials so she can focus on sourcing and markets as her full time has her much busier than mine. She has a business license and credit card. The sourcing consists entirely of going to thrift stores for clothes and jewelry. She does have great style and gets compliments when we go out so I do know she’s really good at the clothing and jewelry part. 80% of her income comes from doing markets on weekends, 10% from online (depop/poshmark), 10% from selling in our showroom (our den converted into a store). Last year I converted the den, which has separate front patio access, into a “showroom” so it can function as her own store. It is small but after putting in racks on the walls along with decent lighting and a giant mirror, it really looks like a little store. The goal is to be able to have people book appointments online to come and shop and have a private experience catered to clients or groups if they like. Also would like to post on the online sales apps more. 

As she is incredibly busy she hasn’t ever been very organized with finances so she asked if I could start getting that in line for her. What would be the best app or software to use to be able to organize the finances like the expenses from thrifting and be able to separate the revenues from markets (zelle, square, cash, Venmo as payments), online sales, and showroom visits? 

Another goal of ours is to really be able to push the showroom visits through her socials with ads and make them feel more like a fun private shopping experience instead of visiting a weird room in someone’s house. (Also just finished up her website which will have the booking calendar as well as links to all socials and the online sales apps) I’m really just trying to learn all the aspects of growing a business as her dream is to open a retail store which I think is very possible since our area of south Florida is growing very quickly and has a ton of people who I know thrift but have nowhere else to buy secondhand besides thrift stores and a single consignment store. I know it’s a broad post and question but what kind of tips do you suggest for growing something like this to a large enough clientele that we can eventually open a retail store? Really appreciate any advice! 

So far some suggestions I’ve seen would be:
- Talk to other similar business owners, invite them to lunch/coffee to get advice
- Build a following online and through showroom in order to be able to hit the ground running if/when you open a brick and mortar",0,1745798635.0,smallbusiness,5,0.5,False

I wanted to ask for some advice — and maybe just some perspective.

I’m not a professional artist by any means, but I really enjoy making art. I’m good at it, and I’ve created a small series of pieces that mean a lot to me. While my work is original, I sometimes take inspiration from other artists' techniques (like their use of textures or layouts), but I don't copy their actual art — I always make it my own.

I’m thinking about hosting a super small, casual art showing — just for family and friends — to share what I’ve made. I'm not trying to sell anything. I just want to create a little moment to present what I’ve done, outside of my work life, and maybe feel proud of it.

I was thinking of asking a local coffee shop or a public library if I could use a small space for an hour or two — nothing fancy, nothing commercial, just a simple gathering.

But part of me keeps wondering: **Is this a dumb idea?** I keep doubting if it's ""allowed"" to show your art if you're not a “real artist” or if it’s cringey to organize something like this.

Have any of you done something similar — just for joy, without trying to sell or “be” an artist professionally?  
Would you go to a friend's small art showing like this?  
Am I overthinking?

On my most recent trip (earlier this month), I schlepped all the way to Burbank to visit the original Bob's Big Boy, the first classic coffee shop/diner that became a national chain.  Designed in the retro-futuristic Googie architecture style I love, Bob's has been serving breakfasts and burgers, fries and pies, milkshakes and salads (with great dressings) since 1949.  
  
The main reason I wanted to go was to pay tribute to the late, great David Lynch, one of my all-time favorite filmmakers, since he passed away in January of this year.  I'm sure most of you know he was a regular at Bob's Big Boy throughout the '70s and early '80s, where he would order black coffee and chocolate milkshakes and write his wild ideas on napkins.  I didn't order what he did, but I did make it there at 2:30, his favorite time to have lunch at Bob's.    
  
I write a food blog, and I wrote a review of Bob's Big Boy that was very much a tribute to the man we're all fans of.  If anyone would care to read it, here it is:

1k9i7wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1k9i7wg/aio_to_my_friends_giving_their_baby_wine_and/,AIO to my friends giving their baby wine and sharing a toothbrush with her?,"Okay, so let me (26f) start this out by saying I am not a parent, so I'm really not sure if I'm over reacting here. I have babysat kids of all ages, which is where my admittedly limited knowledge of babies comes from. I could easily be in the wrong here. They know I'm posting this, and are curious to see what people say as well. So.

I spent last night with a couple of my friends (27f, we'll call her Kayla and 29m, we'll call him Paul) that I haven't seen in 2 years, but we've been friends for over 10 years. In that 2 years of not seeing each other, they had a baby, she's now 19 months. I'm also spending tonight, so this is an ongoing thing. 

It was a spontaneous visit, I had to drive a couple hours so I got here after the baby was asleep. Kayla and I decided to take a couple shots while Paul stayed sober in case the baby needed anything. Shit was totally fine, we both got a little more drunk than we intended to, but it was fun. Woke up to Paul coming in clutch with McMuffins and coffee. Kayla went to take a shower, I went after her and realized I had no toothbrush.

I asked Kayla if they had an extra. Usually, they're the friends that have an extra of everything but they just bought and are moving into a new house so everything is crazy and in boxes right now.

She said, and I quote ""shit girl, I have no idea where the extra bathroom stuff even is. But its okay, our everyday stuff is unpacked so just use ours. Paul won't care. It's in the medicine cabinet, flossers and fluoride too, help yourself!""  

*Ours* I thought *The fuck does she mean OURS*
In that moment I decided to just run to CVS and get one but I still had to know. So, I looked in the medicine cabinet, and sure as shit there is 1 singular, lonely toothbrush. 

I showered, ran to cvs, got a toothbrush. I also grabbed my apparent heathen friends and their  baby their very own individual toothbrushes. When I got back, I gave them their toothbrushes and said ""ok I have to know. Do you guys like... have a family toothbrush... and maybe emergency guest toothbrush? because that is real crazy"" to which they confirmed without a single trace of shame. Yes. They operate on a single toothbrush system. They don't think this is a big deal because they don't have cavities and rinse it with fluoride after.

We had a spirited discussion about that, that was the first thing where I may be wrong because I personally think that that is fucking bonkers and orally likely to cause health issues for, if not them, potentially the baby. They stand by that I'm overreacting. Heathens. 

Second issue where I may be wrong is this. 

While we were watching videos with the baby a little bit ago, Kayla was drinking a glass of red wine. The baby is fussy, teething. So Kayla told Paul to hand her her sippy cup, and she poured a measured shot of wine into her juice. And gave it back to the baby. Baby didn't seem to mind the wine, it did seem to help her calm down and fall asleep, which she's been having trouble calming down all day and this has been her first nap. 

I was pretty shocked and started asking questions like 'did you just give the baby alcohol? is this a standard thing, like how often is this happening? is that even okay because I'm pretty sure thats not okay. the baby didn't even react, she's basically a lush at not even 2. what is happening right now' 

They said maybe once a day and only when she's teething and really having a hard time. That it doesn't harm her. That its pretty normal in some cultures and people used to rub whiskey or wine or rum on babies gums back in the day and this is no different but they understand my being concerned. I told them that I'm not denying that but I'm pretty sure there's other methods for babies than alcohol now and that's dangerous because it can lower her respiratory rate and she could die- I could be wrong there or it might be less dangerous because she's older? But I know I've heard of babies dying from alcohol poisoning before and I just really don't want to see something bad happen.

Am I over reacting right now or is using a shared toothbrush, and giving your baby wine to calm down crazy and carries a potential for harm, and should probably not be continued?

Has anyone gotten into the nitty gritty of which type of salycilates you are sensitive to? I wouldn't have known there were different types except I'm still figuring out my issues...

I have an issue of swelling painful eyes, nausea and sometimes headache while consuming strong organic ginger tea, or coffee from coffee shops.

So far no Whole Foods brand coffee has flared me up. 

And I use White Willow bark for pain daily with no issues and peppermint tea for tummy issues and no problem there either

So got to thinking maybe there are different types? 

I know it's not a
-Organic non organic issue
-It's not a caff/decaff issue (I can drink my own WF coffee all day pretty much no problem) 
-and it's only with some coffees not others
-and a little ginger ale isn't an issue interestingly but I haven't tried a large amount

My nutritional therapist told me salycilate is also the bucket concept of how much can each individual tolerate before issues

I did notice a common denominator could possibly be salycilic acid since methyl salycilate doesn't seem to be a flare 

But then also could it be mold?? Other ideas? 

Other foods I assumed were issues due to salycilates includes coconut, watermelon and all apples but red delicious and opal- those caused immense kidney pain and urgency or colitis (couldn't tell which or maybe both) 

I have also had this symptom come up (eyes, stomach, headache) with a product that had all safe ingredients *except* for natural flavors

So now im just going deeper down the rabbit hole wanting to learn because if there are foods I've cut that would be safe for me I want to keep them in and also I am just voracious with curiosity 

Any weigh ins?

Logistics: Things went very smoothly, there was cool merch and drinks available. Although it gets really hot, and it may be hard to get more drinks if you are in the crowd. 

Sound: Did not blow me away. It was a little lower in volume, try to position yourself near a speaker on the ceiling.

Visuals: This disappointed me because it was clear the visuals were not created for the specific musical act that we were seeing. For much of the time, there wasn't even visuals on all of the screens. The screens did not enclose the entire room, so it really takes you out of the immersive experience. The lights pointing towards the center where the Djs are made it so everyone was still pointed towards the DJ. 

Overall: I had a lot of fun because LP Giobli and Jungle are good DJs, but this feels like they oversold and underdelivered on the experience. It was really no more than the Yuma Tent & Sahara Stage at Coachella combined, but with a lower quality sound system. Didn't feel very immersive or ground breaking, and for what we paid I would have expected better. I also have tickets for the Black Coffee show in LA. I hope they make some changes!

It’s the next chapter in an improbable story,"... That production on the field was created by an incredible devotion to his game off of it. Hassanein became known around Boise as one of the hardest working players on the team, someone who was devoted to getting better each and every day and was simply grateful for the opportunity to play.

“He puts in a ton of time, not only in getting to the building early to get his body ready, get his nutrition right, all those kinds of things, but like, he’s always in the film room,” Chinander said.

“And it’s not just busy work for him. He’s in there, and he’ll come grab us and want to ask questions, like real questions. He’s got multiple notebooks that are full of coaching points he’s got from the head coach, from me, from Coach (Jabril) Frazier. You know, it’s one thing you’ve got to be careful (about) with Ahmed – is he is going to write down what you say? So you’ve got to choose your words wisely, because he will write it down.”

(Boise St. Head Coach) Danielson called him “the most grateful young man you’ll ever be around,” a player who would thank coaches after a hard day of practice, get coffee for staff, treat everyone around him with respect.”

... As NFL scouts and executives prepped ahead of the draft ... if they needed one final sales pitch from Danielson, he’s happy to give it.

“Ahmed can play in any defense you want,” he said a day before the draft’s first round. “He can be a four-down D-end, he can be an outside linebacker in the 3-4. That’s uncommon. I’ve been here for nine years, and we put out a lot of edge guys in the NFL, and we’ve had some of the top defenses in the country, and he’s been the best edge guy that we’ve had, that (is) not only violent in the run game but can absolutely impose his will on tight ends and offensive tackles.

“And I would urge people to watch Oregon and Penn State, watch those games. Watch the top tight end in the country and see how that went against Ahmed. I mean, just watch it.”

1k9i1ps,https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryStories/comments/1k9i1ps/bone_marrow_guy_the_process_of_donating_bone/,Bone Marrow Guy - The Process of Donating Bone Marrow,"The nightmarish, torturous process of having your bones cracked open and drilled into as your consciousness spirals into a vortex of your screams. 


I was matched to donate bone marrow. Now, for almost anyone, they are probably imagining something like what I wrote above, pretty scary. Spinal tap, big needle bone stab, Ouch. So  I documented my process of donating to show you just how terrifying it really was. Buckle up motherfuckers.

Or not. It was pretty damn uneventful. 


(For the anonymity requirement of donor and recipient for the first year after donation, I will be vague about location and timing of the donation)


The process of being matched goes in four steps:


*-Registration*


*-Blood test*


*-Physical*


*-Donation*


*Registration:*


Registration is the first step cuz you can't donate to someone if you can't be found.
You get a cute little envelope with a registry sheet and two cheek swabs. You do the paperwork, apply the spit, and send it off. You can do that in two ways really; at a registry event where someone gives you the envelope, or online where the UPS man gives you the envelope at your house. 



Now you're on the database! That doesn't mean you're about to turn around and donate, you probably never will. You’re just in the pool of people willing to donate bone marrow if a cancer patient is determined that they need an infusion of healthy bone marrow in order to prop up their unhealthy marrow and survive their condition. You'll only get asked to donate if you get found to be a genetic match for a specific patient who needs YOUR marrow. We all have a genetic twin out there and your chances of finding each other when needed are dependent on both of you being registered. Your chances of actually donating are extremely low. For the most part you'll register and forget you ever did it. If you did register and never donated, that's a good thing! You weren't needed and your twin is doing fine at least as far as their bones are related.



The more people that register the greater the chances are that those perfect matches will be found in time to help. The national database is like a dating service for bones. We are all looking to find our soulmate somewhere in the world that will change our lives, cast a wide enough net, and people will start finding them more often. 



It could be needed for a variety of different reasons; they have a disease that compromised their immune system, chemotherapy damaged their marrow’s ability to reproduce itself, or maybe they were just born with crappy marrow. The new marrow essentially almost completely replaces the old, and leading up to the donation, doctors kill off that old marrow to make room. It can't just be anyone’s juice, they have to have a nearly identical HLA type (which is basically your bone marrow’s DNA) or the body will reject it and kill them. 



*Blood Test:*


You got a call randomly one day, informing you that you were identified as a preliminary match for a patient. Congrats! Preliminary means that the DNA off your swab indicates a high potential of being their perfect donor. It's difficult to get a clear enough picture of your HLA type from that spit through all the nicotine, coffee, and hot pocket particles floating around in it. Your spit was your Tinder profile, now it's time for the first date. 

They will mail a blood vial kit to your nearby clinic of choice. There you will give 6 vials of blood that the clinic will send back for further testing. This process for you takes about 10 minutes max. Once that vial goes through testing you'll be contacted again and you'll begin the drum roll to find out if you're THE match. If you are, you move on to Step 3!

*Physical:*


Kind of a strange step for some. You must go to an approved clinic that will do a quick physical and more testing. That could be local and in-and-out, or, like in my case, you don't have a nearby clinic so they fly you to the donation facility for a couple of days to do it. 

It was super easy. A walk through my medical history, some further lab testing, a physical exam, and you're done for the day. In my case I couldn't be there longer than a day as I had a super packed schedule that week. I flew in at night to beautiful [East Coast Beach City] during a storm. I woke up to the same storm and did my physical. They were so confused as to how many of their donors are suddenly coming from the military (What a mystery!). I hopped back on my plane a couple hours later and Step 3 was done. 

*Donation:*

>!It was finally time to fly back to [nondescript East Coast Beach City] and do the donation. A 7 day permissive TDY. It was time for the traumatizing, agonizing experience. A sacrifice for my country, one in which I would carry the scars of for life as a testament of the challenges I endured. All to give someone I'd never met another chance at life. To see their family grow and see years pass that they otherwise never would have. It was worth all the cost incurred to myself to pay for it. 


So basically I was able to hang out at the beach for a week for free and spend like 20 minutes a day getting a shot.       
Ya fkn drama queens. 


Nobody is drilling into your bones, no one is spine tapping you. Nobody is touching your bones at all.
The modern method of bone marrow donation is called PBSC, or Peripheral Blood Stem Cell. It's done through the same process as donating plasma or platelets. You know, that thing you do when you want extra beer money. 


For 4 days your job is to come into the clinic in the morning, get 3 shots of Filgrastim and then leave. Filgrastim is a medicine that induces your body to overproduce bone marrow stem cells. They take up too much room in your bones and you shed the excess into your bloodstream. That's it.
 

Your first 4 days are literally just you getting a couple shots in the morning, and then you are free to do literally whatever you want the rest of the time, so long as it doesn’t endanger that sweet sweet bone nectar flowing through your veins. 


I was going to do a Day 1 - Day 2 - Day 3 style post documenting the whole process and journey but honestly there was nothing to document. The documentary would just be 10 seconds of me getting a shot followed by me goofing off all over [Top Secret beach city] each day. 


The symptoms you could expect are fatigue, mild flu-like symptoms, and mild bone pain as the marrow is pushing out the excess. I had none of these things. I was literally chilling, so much so that I got a bit peeved. Where is my great sacrifice? Where is my battle to save a life? How could I possibly open the gates to Valhalla without letting spill the blood of war? It just doesn't work like that anymore. BUT It is just as vital and important. While I was goofing off and having a good time, my recipients' doctors were actively killing their immune system in preparation for my donation to be couriered over by plane and implanted as soon as it was collected. 


The actual donation is on the 5th day. You come in the same as always and go to a different room with an actual bed and get your shots one more time. The vibe is different entirely. When you get your shots is routine for the nurses; small talk the shot and you're off. Here it's almost electric, there's excitement and focus centering around you. I was greeted by one person after another, they want to meet you. They only see maybe two unrelated donors a month. An energetic healthy person in a clinic that only sees those who aren't. Then they put a needle in both arms and hook you up to a machine that collects the Stem Cells and gives you back the rest. Your job from this point is to just nap, watch netflix, chat with the very pretty nurses, whatever. The process takes around 4-5 hours and once you’re done, you are good to go! Literally. Go back to your overly fancy hotel, maybe eat some food and get right back to goofing off until your flight the next day. Just out of sight there's a courier pretty much in a sprinters position with his hand outstretched behind him waiting for the nurse to hand him the goo baggy like it's a baton, so he can blast off to the airport.


The whole time I was donating, the nurses, doctors, and cancer specialists all came in and thanked me and took special care in making sure I was comfortable. But during that I saw they all looked at that goo bag filling up with a strange deferrance, cared after it like it was the most important thing in the building. I realized that I am just a chapter in the story of this bag. I am just the courier of its contents, like a surrogate carries the hopes of a family. It has a life far greater than my small part. It's not for me and it's not about me. I'm part of the team of this staff today and we came together for what is to me, a complete stranger and a small inconvenience. The staff know exactly what it represents and to whom. It IS a life. They know better than me that this bag has a team of doctors and nurses somewhere far away waiting for it to be rushed through the door. This bag has a family hoping against hope it comes in time. It has a patient fighting for their life awaiting this secret weapon to turn the tide in that fight, and begin taking the offensive. It's the first step in an all new battle for recovery, but it's one they never could have taken part in had I not taken this strange vacation to the beach and sat in a hospital bed for a couple hours.


3,000 People will die this year unable to find their donor. All because people are too scared, too apathetic, too… unregistered to sit in that hospital bed. I am proud that I was able to make that number 2,999. It is up to you to make it 2,998.!<

I’ve been having digestion issues for last few years and want to focus on healing my gut. I’m a 28F with active lifestyle (daily yoga, exercise 4-5 times a week, running 1-2 times a week, walking avg 8k steps/day). I’m mindful about my diet rich in plants and diverse vegetables, legumes, lean protein, seafood with minimal red meat. No alcohol, 1-2 cups coffee/day. I take magnesium citraat, multivitamin, creatine, protein powder, and recently started nootropics supplements).

I’m on a calorie deficit, and am experiencing a plateau due to gut issues, i’ve never been overweight and only have 1kg left to lose, but my gut issues are causing me huge problems. It disrupts my sleep which effects my energy levels which reduces the quality of my workouts, affects my mood, i constantly have stomach ache, i get overwhelmed about  having to plan my life around my bloating and stomach issues, always have an uncomfortable feeling. 

Here’s what i’ve tried so far :

- psyllium husk ( i’ve tried adding a teaspoon in my small yogurt or kefir bowls 2x/day, worked well for the first couple weeks, but i lost BM) 
- flax seed 1-2 teaspoon/day
-chia seed ( i regularly make chia pudding with yogurt and plant based milk or add it in overnight oats) 
- dried prune/fig/ apricot ( i also tried soaking overnight and drinking the juice on an empty stomach in the morning, and i used the soaked fruit in smoothies in the afternoon, no luck)
- warm water with ginger, lemon juice and turmeric ( drink it first thing in the morning, 15 mins~ before breakfast, usually during a morning yoga session) 
- walks ( i increased my steps, helps me pass gass but not with constipation) 
- laxatives ( i’ve been taking the overnight ones -dulcolax- when i didn’t have BM for days , 4-5 days, as a last resort, but i don’t want to take it anymore, it works but it’s painful and disrupts my sleep) 
- water intake ( this is something i’m still trying to improve but i drink 1.5-2L/ day on average) 
- kefir ( i eat kefir yogurt with fruits, adding driedor fresh fruits and husk+flax seed) 
- kimchi ( i’m not a pickle fan so i opt for kimchi, if pickles are the way, i will try!) 
-kombucha ( i drink kombucha fairly often,  started taking the morning kombucha shot by raw culture since yesterday, no BM last two days) 
- i finally tried enema as i was hopeless last week, it worked but again painful,  uncomfortable and unsustainable.

**So, you’ve got a crush on a coworker. Your heart does a little flip every time they walk by with their reusable coffee mug, and you’re pretty sure their spreadsheet skills are the stuff of legends. You’re thinking about asking them out, but the Reddit hive mind has spoken, and the consensus is clear: “*****Don’t shit where you eat.*****” Harsh? Maybe. True? Probably. But let’s not give up on love just yet. Instead, let’s navigate this minefield with the finesse of a cat burglar.**

# Step 1: Check the Employee Handbook (Yes, Really)

Before you even think about sliding into their DMs or lingering too long by the water cooler, do your homework. Your company’s employee handbook is the ultimate buzzkill, but it’s also your first line of defense. **Many workplaces have policies on office romances**, ranging from “absolutely not” to “proceed with caution.” Some might require you to disclose a relationship to HR, while others might just frown upon it like your grandma catching you sneaking cookies before dinner.

Curious if anyone has them and has any insight on how they would do for gaming?

As far as $, I would be willing to spend around **$100-200**, but could probably be convinced to stretch the budget. As far as past experience with headphones for this purpose, I've used wired Hyper Xs, a Razer wired headset, and currently using **Skullcandy Crusher Evos**.

I'll try to be specific with my desires and budget to help everyone narrow their recommendations. 

We are a family of four with two children aged 6 and 11.  We are looking to take our children on their first all inclusive holiday in Mexico.

My wife and I have travelled to many all inclusive resorts in Cabo, Cancun, and Puerto Vallarta--but all as a couple.  We really have no experience going as a family and all the extra things that will entail.

We are looking to go ASAP.  Any time in May works for us.  Feel free to choose midweek or weird days if it makes it cheaper.

The following are pretty much **must haves**:

- A nice resort that is clean.  I've been sick before and want to avoid that for my children.

- Good food.  Since we'll be with the children and the drinking/nightlife isn't the priority I want to be able to enjoy lots of different food options for both the adults and children.  I would love there to be lots of ""kid friendly"" food options.  I would also love if there were quick food options--like areas you can get a pizza or a burger at any time (for the kiddos).

- Side shops.  We stayed at a resort that had an awesome coffee shop with a bakery.  It also had a really nice sports bar that showed sports.  I love hockey and it's the playoffs so it would be nice to have the ability to grab some food and watch a game.  It's fun to utilize these secondary shops/restaurants.

- A family friendly resort with lots of other kids.  We don't want to be in an adult heavy resort and be annoying towards couples trying to relax.  It would also be nice if there were lots of children around so they could all play and potentially make friends.

- Decent things for kids to do.  Example: a couple of slides and some fun outdoor activities.  My wife and I aren't planning on dropping the kids off and leaving, but if there isn't stuff to do it could get boring for them.

- We **need** a room that has a swim up balcony or plunge pool.  We've stayed in a room like this as adults before and it was amazing. If the kids get hot/tired and want to stay in the room, I want to have the ability to be in the water 15 feet from them.  It would also be nice for the morning if they're not up yet or are taking awhile to get ready.  This is pretty much a must.  It must allow children as well--I know certainly swim up rooms are adult only.

For the location, we don't really have a preference.  We are located in Alberta, Canada so keep in mind any flights would be coming from there and pricing would be in CAD not USD.  I am not opposed to Cabo, Cancun, or Puerto Vallarta.  Cancun could be nice because of more of the secondary things to do (ex. Xelha), but with two children the biggest focus is on the resort.  

It would be nice to use the beach as well (and I know that's tough in Cabo) but it's not a dealbreaker.

For budget, I'd love to sit around $10,000 CAD for the family.  If something is perfect and more expensive, I'll see what I can do.  But I don't want to go above budget for something that only checks a few of the boxes.

Super nice, balanced emotionally, kind and caring, career driven but compassionate, checks the boxes if that makes sense.

Got along pretty well after first date (drinks), held hands by the end. She responded after saying had a good time but likes to take it slow and can take her time to show romance physically. Fine, that’s totally cool with me.

Date 2 coffee and dessert, walk along some vintage stores, food market after. Plenty of opportunities to hold hands, I tried to but no attempt from her, no reciprocation. In between texts are kinda dry/non existent (only responds once per day, a couple times I had to double text). After date 2 i had kind of expected her to take a bit more initiative (like carry part of the text chat, even just send a funny meme) but nothing, however happy to do date 3 when i suggested.

Date 3 grab lunch and get matcha then go to a nearby park. Again literally no reciprocity when I try to touch (hands, hold the small of her back etc.). At the end I’m honestly just turned off and don’t even try anymore just walk her to her subway station.

She had asked for some restaurant recs, I sent those over immediately post date with notes on dishes to get, but she takes multiple days to respond.

I just call it off saying i think she’s a great person but im not feeling a romantic connection.

Funnily enough she then responds almost immediately saying she really enjoyed spending time with me, and wants to stay in touch and meet up as she thought I was a really kind and interesting person and wants to get to know me more. I said sure but never followed up

I’d rather not be dragged along especially if someone isn’t reciprocating interest, but just a bit confused about whether I was moving too fast here?

➡️➡️ SOME OF THE EXAMPLES

1. I started to take notice when I posted here in reddit before how our relationship has imperfections but my boyfriend is just really the best, and people were just so negative. He takes care of me. Siya nagpapainit ng mainit tubig pag maliligo na ako, even makes sure maligamgam yung papaliguan ko (may shower but no heater). He cooks me breakfast as in gigising na lang ako at kakain. He buys me coffee outside in the morning every day!!! He doesn't even let me wash the dishes. He pays for grab, he pays for meals and dates, sends me flowers when I'm sad. Makes time for me. Ang effort ko naman ay I pay for cheap shit like ice cream or milk tea. Literal alt+f4 yun sa games with friends when I say I feel sad and need someone. I love him so much. But people here in reddit suddenly started saying ""sa simula lang yan"" or started accusing me that I am delulu at nagiimbento ako???? Bruh

2. My friend who I treat like a younger sister judged me for paying my boyfriend and I's entire Eras Tour trip. It was around 125K all-in including the tickets, and you know what, I feel like my boyfriend deserves more! Ako yung fan ni Taylor, hindi sya. But he listened to her discography day and night so he could sing with me. He took a leave at work just to be WITH ME so I don't understand why she started telling me na nagiging sugar mama na daw ako ng boyfriend ko??? Like sobrang offended ko nun!!! I tried reasoning with her she keeps insisting ""kahit na!"" My boyfriend deserves the world. How can she think relationships are that transactional?! Pag naglabas ka ng pera para sa boyfriend mo pineperahan ka na?! I was so mad I started thinking na if she knew better, eh bakit forced single mother sya now and nabuntis kahit break na sila 😭 no offense to single moms

3. Naalala nyo when I said na cheap shit lang binabayaran ko like Ice cream during dates? Guess what, I earn more than him. He earns around 90K+ and I earn 180K+. Yes, double. Even if that is the case, he told me my money is mine and he wants to provide as much as he can, but will be transparent on instances where he cannot. I told him we are also financial partners and we will help each other out and for him to not feel pressured. I am his safety and he is mine. I told this to a guy friend and he started calling my boyfriend ""dead weight"". I got SO ANGRY!!! His reason was that for him men cannot lead when the woman is earns higher. Hence, he cannot be called a provider and he adds no value to my life daw. Wtf?! Paanong no value?! He PROVIDES emotional security, mental and intellectual security, financial security, love, understanding, everything!!! He even said I should date men earning higher than me. Again, I tried reasoning with him, but he keeps on saying ""di mo kasi gets!"" ???

4. Lastly, my bf asks nothing from me. I want to buy him the latest GPU, get him the best furniture, handheld PC etc. But he wants nothing. He just says that I am enough. Ang gusto nya lang is a stainless steel pan from SM dept store. I offered 50/50 and he felt uncomfy but told me if that would make me feel better, he would be fine. Just not dates. Wag daw mag split ng bill he feels awkward. Sa iba nalang daw. Told this to some of my girl friends and they scolded me for saying 50/50 kase daw there is no such thing bec men dont get pregnant etc. I told them bakit ko bibilangan ang boyfriend ko sa bagay na hindi pa naman nangyayari?! I havent been pregnant and rn we arent thinking about it. Bakit ko sya sisingilin sa future na di pa naman nangyayari?! These friends looked at me like I was an alien after when in reality sila din ayaw nila maganak but yaps about no 50/50

1k9hwcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1k9hwcl/20f_random_heart_palpitations/,(20F) Random Heart Palpitations?,"I take Desvenlafaxine, Plaquenil, Bupropion SE, a multivitamin, and an iron supplement. I have diagnosed Lupus, autism, OCD, anxiety, and depression. 

This started two weeks ago. I vomited randomly at 4 AM on Monday (I have not thrown up in seven years). Tuesday night, I was fine but started having heart palpitations, chest pain, and shortness of breath. I waited it out Wednesday because I thought it was just anxiety, and it would pass. Everything seemed to get better when my parents picked me up from college and brought me home. Thursday comes along, and it came back, so I went to the ER. They said it was acid reflux related. They did an EKG, several blood tests, and a chest x-ray and found nothing. Since I immediately felt better after going into the medical buildings, I thought it was just anxiety and acid reflux. I also tested myself for COVID three times, and it was all negative. 

I thought that an increase of my dosage of Bupropion to being Bupropion XL from the SE 100 mg (went from 100 mg to 150 mg) was responsible for this, so I contacted my psychiatrist about it, and we went back down. 

I don’t really have the shortness of breath and chest pain anymore, but the heart palpitations are still there (they have gotten better though). I am just getting out a mental health crisis, so this could explain things, but today, I was laying down and not stressed at all, and my heart rate was 80-90 BPM, and I was having the palpitations randomly. 

I have had experiences in the past where I will get random heart palpitations and get panicked by it, but now, I don’t know why I could be having it. I quit having caffeine/coffee for the sake of my acid reflux, so it can’t be that. I don’t feel that stressed either to the point where it would cause me to have my heart thumping.

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I’d be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I’m not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won’t jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/bIhpl9X)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

I’ve been failing to finish most if not all of my coursework since I started university (I did it back in high school school as well but it just got worse with the inconsistent schedule of uni life). I was doing so great in March— went out to an academic/artsy/political event almost every single day, ate breakfast(!!!) and meals three times a day, and submitted things on past the deadline (not past it :,)).

Now that Easter break is ending, I was not able to submit a paper that had the deadline during the break and I will have to repeat that class.  But the bigger thing is that for tomorrow Monday, for the class that I DO like, I have a non-existent presentation for a scientific performance. I am so dead. I stayed inside the past two days trying to lock in, I drank not too much coffee, avoided huge meals that would make me sleepy, but I got distracted every time I open my laptop (I reorganized my emails, unsubscribed to newsletters, cleaned out spam messages, opened new non-Google email accounts to slowly start avoiding Google services, and also folded my clothes.)

And now I have less than 7 hours before my class starts.

3. Naalala nyo when I said na cheap shit lang binabayaran ko like Ice cream during dates? Guess what, I earn more than him. He earns around 90K+ and I earn 180K+. Yes, double. Even if that is the case, he told me my money is mine and he wants to provide as much as he can, but will be transparent on instances where he cannot. I told him we are also financial partners and we will help each other out and for him to not feel pressured. I am his safety and he is mine. I told this to a guy friend and he started calling my boyfriend ""dead weight"". I got SO ANGRY!!! His reason was that for him men cannot lead when the woman is earns higher. Hence, he cannot be called a provider and he adds no value to my life daw. Wtf?! Paanong no value?! He PROVIDES emotional security, mental and intellectual security, financial security, love, understanding, everything!!! He even said I should date men earning higher than me. Again, I tried reasoning with him, but he keeps on saying ""di mo kasi gets!"" ???

4. Lastly, my bf asks nothing from me. I want to buy him the latest GPU, get him the best furniture, handheld PC etc. But he wants nothing. He just says that I am enough. Ang gusto nya lang is a stainless steel pan from SM dept store. I offered 50/50 and he felt uncomfy but told me if that would make me feel better, he would be fine. Just not dates. Wag daw mag split ng bill he feels awkward. Sa iba nalang daw. Told this to some of my girl friends and they scolded me for saying 50/50 kase daw there is no such thing bec men dont get pregnant etc. I told them bakit ko bibilangan ang boyfriend ko sa bagay na hindi pa naman nangyayari?! I havent been pregnant and rn we arent thinking about it. Bakit ko sya sisingilin sa future na di pa naman nangyayari?! These friends looked at me like I was an alien after when in reality sila din ayaw nila maganak but yaps about no 50/50

Previous attempt: tried reasoning with them but they kept on putting me down like I should find something negative in this relationship or I should want more",1,1745796896.0,adviceph,49,0.54,False

My (M38) GF (F32) of a 4 years has a decent life. She pays her own bills as in car and insurance but i pay for all house bills and rent and travel and food. Now for food or drinks She will cover it some times when we are out but because my job i am in a position where money isnt a worry so i try and cover everything. Flights. hotels. whatever. also cover therapy  and little lifestyle things like We have a maid, but i cook my own meals, she does do the laundry once a month and dishes. Now she doesnt have a job and i offer to pay for anything she needs help with. My ask is to Just focus on her own self business. Not a bad life.

She has a daughter that isnt mine but i have helped raise them. They call me dad. Love them but I am not perfect. I could be around the kiddo even more but i do work a lot for the life style we have. She has a few of her own rooms in the house. She locks her office so i do not have access too it. Now i will start off with saying this isnt the first time lying or hiding stuff has happened. Even cornered she will lie and i feel its simply and ego thing. I can tell when she is be shady. Now fast forward to the problem

Yesterday I asked for some gum, she has some really good kind in her office. she sits down and say o ok. she needs a moment. I wait and ask again she then says o she will bring it up. From her past behavior this is when i knew something was off. 

\*quick back story one full fledged fight happened because a joke happened on tv but you had to have knowledge on gregor mendal and the only way i knew that was because i watched a video a month before on him. I laughed she did a half laugh and i asked if she got a joke, she said she did and i said o ok....you know mendal She said yes.. it felt weird. the best way i describe when she does a lie. if you have a partner that has been caught lying you know their tells.. best way i can explain it... \*i could have just not followed up but thats on me\* I asked her to explain the joke. She got extremely defensive. Saying i was mansplaning, saying i always do this and she hates it and she never brought up my mansplaning problem because she didnt want to hurt my feelings, I am very big on big or small on comms and asked why she wouldnt bring that up cuz i would work on it if it was a problem. Then told her hey i will work on that done and i apologize. can you please explain the joke tho. she gets up to leave saying she doesnt have to deal with this. Then saying why would she lie about something so small. and im being toxic. fast forward 30 minutes of back and forth. she finally says ok she doesnt get it but i shouldnt mansplan. I just leave the room and sleep in the other bedroom. no apology no nothing.\*



now back to her sitting down. I say i can wait for the gum and she says ok she needs a minute. I clean up the living room and wait. then she gets up after 5 minutes and makes coffee. I say ooo can we grab the gum real fast. She says oooo actually dont worry about the office gum cuz there is gum in the bathroom so grab that instead. I finally say why dont you want me in your office. She then starts to gas light me saying ""You always do this you have to have shit on your time! I ask why she is doing everything but going to the office for gum. She then says im making it about me and starts getting pissed I say please just lets grab the gum from your office what is the big deal, and why dont you want me near your office.... Finally she walks towards her office and says wait out here in the hall way. I follow see you are 100% hiding something.. NO IM NOT... i follow her in and all hell breaks loose. I start asking what the hell is going on and what is she hiding, she finally calls name, nothing bad but like jerk or asshole and then everything escalates from there. yelling and just wrong on both sides, but its my fault because i couldnt wait, and i had to have everything my way i want and its wrong for me to not trust her, and then saying I gas light, and i always do this.... I leave and stay away for a day also during that time Still have no idea what she was hiding. Also This is time number 5 of being caught lying or hiding something like this. Backed in a corner with a lie, with proof its a lie and will still fight tooth and nail that its not a lie until i show proof. I just do not get it.  I dont think she is cheating.. but i have no clue. 

 just cant get over the point of lying and lying. telling someone that are gaslighting and toxic when they just got caught and called out for doing that. I dont know what to do or if there is a way to get around this. out side of this we have an great relationship but breaking trust is a HUGE no go for me. i thank you for the help and im really saddened. Like at a lose

  
So how do I tell her 'Hey why do you think its better to lie or create a giant fight then be honest or have open comms and we shouldnt be saying phrases like gaslighting or narcissist when actively in an argument and we need to work on our ego or behavior. The last one im not even allowed to say ego because \*thats toxic\*?",1,1745796834.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

I'm a sophomore at a large state flagship and I landed an internship at one of the hottest YC-backed AI startups. I won't speak to full time, but here's some lessons and tips that I wish I knew before applying for internships

**1. It's probably not you**

Look - the market's cooked right now, irrespective of degree. Unless you're related to the CEO or extremely cracked, your resume probably never sees the light of day. But you still need an internship, so what do you do?

**2. Network**

You probably don't have a lot of experience, and with so many students looking and so few jobs, you need a way to differentiate yourself. This is what networking is for.

Think about it, your resume doesn't do you justice at all. Maybe you're a great communicator or extremely talented at Excel, but that doesn't really help when everyone puts ""Teamwork"" and ""MS Excel/Word/Powerpoint"" as skills on their resume.

Instead, you need someone at the company to vouch for you through referrals. This is what gets your resume looked at, and gets you a fair shot at the interview. To do this, look up alumni from your school's network and ask them for 15-20 minutes of their time (this is called a coffee chat). Think of this as a quick two way interview. They're seeing if you're someone they like enough to work at their company, while you're seeing if you like their role and the company they work at.

I manually searched, connected, and messaged these people on Linkedin but DONT DO THIS. Which leads to my next point...

**3. Automate. Everything.**

Looking for jobs, networking, and applying is a zero-value add. There are NO skills you learn or benefits you get from manually doing everything. The time can be better spent prepping for interviews, working on something else, or just hanging out with friends. Instead, here's 2 pieces of software I recommend using.

Networking: [https://theoffercall.com/](https://theoffercall.com/) (Automatically searches and sends hundreds of personalized coffee chat invites.)

Applying: [https://simplify.jobs/](https://simplify.jobs/) (Helps you fill out repetitive questions on applications to speed up the process: think Personal Info, Ethnicity, Experience, etc)

He loves chess more than anything and is still actively teaching at schools.  I reconnected with him recently and he mentioned me no longer owned a chess clock because he'd given his personal one to a student. That's just the kind of guy he is.

Out of appreciation, I would like to mail him a surprise package of some nice chess things. E.g. some boards, chess pieces, chess clocks, etc. He is based in the USA.

Can anyone help take a look at my list, and suggest any ways to make it better?

* **Chess clock x5**
   * He and his students play in tournaments, so it needs to be something that could work there
   * From memory, the Chronos GX is awesome but seems to be no longer available?
   * Seems like DGT3000 LE is the current ""best"" option?
* **Chess sets x5**
   * He plays at schools, tournaments, coffee shops - it's for me to imagine him using a wooden board vs the rollable kind
   * Thinking some of these [classic sets that come with bags](https://www.houseofstaunton.com/chess-products/us-chess-supreme-chess-set-combination)?
   * Or possibly some boards with his name [screen printed](https://www.houseofstaunton.com/chess-products/custom-silk-screened-vinyl-chess-boards)?
   * Is there anything anything nicer?
* **Anything else?**
   * Are there other cool chess gifts that anyone would recommend?

1k9hlw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/virgin/comments/1k9hlw4/i_never_thought_i_would_have_to_post_here/,I never thought I would have to post here.,"But the time has come. I'm 28, and I've been browsing subreddits like /r/seduction, /r/socialskills /r/dating, /r/dating_advice, /r/tinder (a joke), and recently /r/hingeapp for information on how to build and tailor my hinge profile, and also complain about getting a lack of matches. I've been banned from the dating advice discord server, the hinge discord server, my hometown's discord server, and the seduction subreddit over the years. If I were to try to rejoin any of these communities I would be unable to. 

I have a steady job in engineering/manufacturing. I have a 4 year degree. I have a luxury apartment in a vibrant neighborhood surrounded by parks, cafes and bars that stay open late. I have lots of things going for me, but what has never gone right is my social life. 

From an early age I was socially stunted. I grew up in a suburban neighborhood which was built as a new subdivision. I wanted to stay inside and watch TV or play on the computer rather than hang out with the guys in the neighborhood. This theme would continue through the years. As an aside, everyone I grew up with back then is either now married or engaged, and their wives are very attractive. 

Anyways, this theme of social isolation continued through middle school and high school. As I would tell therapists and others in Reddit years later, I just had a loose network of acquaintances. I never was close enough to anyone where I could call them my best friend, and it be mutual (that's probably not even a thing for most people anyways though).

I started high school at age 14. In high school, I had crushes, much like I did in middle school. I never acted on any. I would tell people that I liked a certain girl, word might have gotten to her, but I never asked anyone out. It's possible that some girls had crushes on me; I will probably never know. The exception was when I asked a girl to prom in 2014 because my acquaintances pushed me to, but to this day I think that was a stunt because she never really reciprocated anything. We never got close on the party bus. I was nervous the whole time. I just felt like I didn't even belong there, and I felt out of place. I should note, in high school I did NOT think I was attractive compared to my friends. Glasses, braces, the clothes I wore. Some compared me to Steve Urkle. Ironically enough he is married to a pretty successful woman from California. 

College was a wash. When I was 18, I went to a tech school that was a few hours from home, and was 80% dudes 20% girls. One regret I have from this time (2014-2016) was that I did not look into online dating. The city I went to school in actually had attractive women there. If I had used the apps in their early stages, I bet I could have had some successes. 

I transferred home after two years. I'm 20 now. I live at home and commute to school. But now I'm working at a warehouse, and it's another mostly male environment. Another instance where I should have been at a grocery store or the mall, or some place where I would have been surrounded by girls. I needed a job though. 

Around this time is when I landed my first ever date, in the spring of 2017. I was at a now-closed restaurant at a mall nearby with my family, and I recognized her from a summer camp I used to be in years ago with her. I told everyone at the table, my dad suggested I get her number. I did. I ended up texting her, setting a date (I still have the messages saved), and we met for coffee. She shows up in a workout outfit and claims she just got back from the gym. I had to drive 25 minutes to get to this place which was near where she lived and not me. 30 minutes into the date, she says she has a boyfriend. I was so stunned that I just kept participating in the date for the next hour like nothing even happened. She mentioned ""boyfriend"" several more times during the interaction. Mind you, I freshened up, chewed gum, got a haircut, etc. Whether she had one or not at the time is probably irrelevant. She had waste my time. 

At school I helped start a coed club sports team my second year attending, which was 2017. I was 21 and could drink now, but would not have my first full drink until I was 25. For whatever reason I guess, I was scared of alcohol, and in a weird way this stunted my growth in high school because everyone did it. This was how the real bonds were formed. Now this club sports team grew quickly and attracted different groups of people, friends, seasoned athletes, etc. Hitting on girls wasn't a priority for me as I didn't want that to be known as the reason why I was on the team. Alas, I did ask a girl out on the team that I carpooled to practice, and we did go out for breakfast at Denny's. I paid for the meal with $20, but she later returned it. I found out later that she was lesbian. This was the last girl I'd have a date with in college, and I knew that would likely be the case after the fact. Ironically enough there were several couples and one marriage that came about from the team I helped create and the members I recruited. In essence I helped set people up.  

I graduated in 2019, and joined a national volunteer service program in California as a post-college gap year activity. I would travel around the US in a team of 7-9 people for about 10 months with lodging and per diem included. The program's training camp had about 150 people there during the month-long orientation. Interestingly, the program's rules stated that sexual activity could not be had in the program's dorms, yet rumors would swirl for weeks about it happening all the time. I met a girl, I'll just call her Alicia, that I am still friends(zone) with today. I think she was attracted to me when I first met her, but she apparently dated my other friend on her team before they both broke up. And I'm friends with him too, but they both live far away. 

We travel to different assignments across the country, and return to campus in February 2020 for a break. I took a solo day trip to San Francisco for a day and met a girl on a bus who worked in the garment industry. She was dressed up in what she called Lolita fashion. What happened was when our bus reached a stop, I was sitting in someone's assigned seat. So she asked if I wanted to sit with her, and I did. Long story short this turned into us getting off the bus in SF and me inviting her to come with me during my trip. And this turned into a hours long sightseeing date. This was probably my first-ever true date. Unfortunately, I would be leaving the state in a few days, but we exchanged contacts through Snapchat (which I no longer use). I sent her the whole ""great date let's do it again"" message and was promptly left on read. 

The pandemic hits. I am sent home and all of the teams are disbanded. For the next year I'm at home doing nothing for the most part but helping my parents around the house with projects and looking for jobs. In 2021, I decided to officially try Tinder for the first time. I didn't think I needed it until now, so I said let's see. I'm 25 now and a virgin still, it can't be that hard right? Wrong. My pictures at the time were not very good, I hardly got any matches, but I did get some. I went out on a date with a girl who was 6'1"" (I'm 5'11"" 160lbs so it was a bit odd), and the date was the most awkward one ever. We grab coffee downtown, then I say we should go for a walk, which we do, and I try grabbing her hand to ""break the touch barrier"" as the seduction subreddit would tell me. But she was not reciprocating and looked uncomfortable. I sort of made her grab it, and she went along with it. No kiss or anything on the date, and she said later it wasn't going to work out but she wished me well with my job search (she was employed).

In September of 2021, I finally get a job in manufacturing/engineering. This gives me an incentive to move out of the house in the suburbs and move to the city where there's a higher concentration of younger people. I do just that in the spring of 2022. But now I'm working second shift from 2-11pm. When I'm at work, everyone is out, and vice versa. I get back on the apps but I'm paying now. Earlier in the year I had a date with a girl who lived an hour away on Facebook Dating. We decide to meet halfway (it was actually much closer for her) at a donut/coffee chain. She was OK looking. We decided to go on a second date for pizza. Afterwards we go to Target, but in the car we're just talking for a bit about things (seemed like it was mostly her asking me questions), but there was a pause, she asks ""what are you thinking about"" and the implication was she wanted a kiss. I guess I got the hint but I asked if we should. And that was my first kiss. Days later, her previously rapid texts trailed off until she told me the distance was too much for her and things had to end. I became very emotional and depressed after this text. 

Over the next couple of years, I would meet a group of guys on a Discord server that live in Toronto and faced similar issues as I did. We agreed to meet up and decided to approach girls live on the street. This would go on throughout the summer of 2023 and into 2024. We had a WhatsApp group where we would share memes and advice. I was the second oldest and then after our other friend left, the oldest. I also had the biggest chip on my shoulder. My one friend in our group actually lost his virginity to a girl he met on Hinge, but she cheated on him in the process and I think he still regrets it to this day. 

I approached over 150 girls in Toronto and back here at home. When me and my friends went out to eat at a restaurant in Toronto in October 2023, I asked our waitress out and we ended up going on a date that I got rejected from afterwards. I became increasingly frustrated and irate with the lack of progress. I vented to them in the chat and elsewhere. This was when I was banned from multiple discord servers. They told me to get therapy, which I did, and I told her about my issues. She focused on relieving trauma, which seemed to have worked at the time. 

I was now shelling out hundreds of dollars on Hinge and Tinder with nothing to show. I got a couple dates from Hinge with girls who were not all that attractive. One girl I made out with but it didn't go anywhere. I went back to Toronto in November of last year where I met my friend from the group at a bar/club downtown. He's talking to different girls around a pool table and meets one who did the same sport I did when I was in college. This was enough to hook her into me, and I kind of orbit around her for a half an hour. Then I suggest we go dance. She pulls me across the bar to an area that a bit secluded and we made out for like five minutes. It was awesome. We kept doing it. The issue was, I would always drive two hours to Toronto so I didn't have a place to take her to. I get her number, I try setting something up, but I think the distance turned her off and she just wouldn't cooperate over text. 

A few weeks later, Blackout Tuesday is here and I am back home standing next to the stage at a bar with live music. A group of guys and girls are standing next to me, and this girl turns around to me, starts dancing and grinding on me, and I reciprocate. We ended up making out multiple times. I never said anything to her. So I suggest we grab a drink. I meet her friends, we're hugging each other like we've been together for ages. Long story short, when it's time for them to leave, they say they're going to McDonald's. I get cold feet and just ask for her number. I set up a date for Black Friday at the same bar. Something either got lost in translation or she wasn't there, because I couldn't find her. And that was that. That would've been the closest i came to having sex, because this bar is walking distance from where I live. 

So here we are today. I have a better sense of style, I try to keep a stylish haircut, I could probably accessorize the way I look with jewelry or something. But I am apparently not good enough to be desired, otherwise I wouldn't be posting here for everyone. So this is why I'm a virgin.",1,1745796559.0,virgin,0,1.0,False

well

I'm sure as you know

and developed an affinity for

talking

to people



fast forward a couple years

and here we are

head of biotech corp

supply the nation

and the world

with cutting edge medical treatments

and supplies

power?

that's something some say do they

that i have too much power?



i may run a business

yes i can fire people

but besides that

the only power i have is telling my secretary

how many sugars to put in my coffee



i don't know where people could get this idea i have any sense of power



a monopoly

i wouldn't consider the notion

that since I'm the only one

who manufactures and supplies the nation

with limbs and other psychical augmentations

as a monopoly

no one else has come forward

to offer a secondary option

so i remain the only one to do so

not quite a monopoly i dare say

you wont be able to get away



(sigh)

you see

this city

this

nation

is blind

blind to its purpose

we've always thought ourself as our own commanders

in control of our fate

but you have to see the bigger picture

we were simply here

to usher in

the age of the machines

designing and build technology

reaching closer and closer to the singularity



i wont be on the wrong side of that

when it comes

and with my offer of a whole nation

rich of people

who are more machine than human

will only guarantee my seat

as the first human pharaoh

of a digital dynasty



you cant stop the progress of machines

and you cant stop me

but just to make sure

little miss journalist doesn't cause any trouble

you're going to become our first live test

as a loyal

and obedient subject



\*static glitch sound\*

\-hypno-



now not only can i stop you in your tracks

but being linked into your whole system

i can mess around with whatever i like

your sight

your touch

your hearing

all of it

and more



you look a little stiff

lets make you comfortable

more comfortable then I've ever been in your life

mmm that's right

you can try to fight back

but you've never felt more comfortable in your life



it'll feel better if you relax



so warm

so heavy



its alright if you slowly melt into the couch

go right ahead

its quite soft isn't it

how it supports your body so well



why don't make things a little more peaceful

turn down the volume so to say

until only my voice remains

\*dim ambiance\*



is it just you

or does my voice sound

lovely

you might be questioning yourself

do you

enjoy this

the sound of my voice

or is that just me

making sure you do

either way



you find yourself

melting

into the soft rhythmic tones

pulling you down

deeper

and deeper

into a place of relaxation

you've never felt before



it makes me very happy

to see you respond so well

to not only the control i exert over you

but your response

to how i take you down



not to worry

ill take good care of you

you're my first

i want to cherish you

and make sure you stay nice and relaxed

for a very

very long time



you know

ill have to admit

this is my first time

doing something to this caliber

never before have we practiced on bringing someone under our control

but it fills me quite a lot of joy

to see it working flawless

and

also makes me want for more

i enjoy this

and i will be honest

i want to see just how far down i can take you

you know

maybe i can create a new position

just for you

so you can keep me company

and ill have you right by my side

at all times



but you'd like that wouldn't you

as things fade

finding yourself sinking deeper and deeper

that sense of who you were

and even

why you came here

slowly drift of



you find yourself welcoming in

more and more

the sweet amazing feelings i bring you

will my voice

and my control



not too worry

ill keep you here

relaxed

at peace

drifting slowly along

in a heady heavy haze

with only my voice reaching you

the only thing you want

to reach you



its okie

you can melt

as deep down

as you want

ill be here

to keep you together



now

get some rest wont you

not to worry

ill reschedule my next appointment



i have much more important things to tend to

namely

you

Looking for suggestions because my boy just wants to lay in the sun. 

Sorry this ended up being super long winded, I just have the irrational need to give as much relevant info as I can...

I have 2 cats who have been living together since 2021. They're both roughly 5 years old. My male cat has always been an indoor cat and my female cat was a rural stray kitten and was rescued at around 6 months old, but has lived with me (indoors only) ever since.

My male cat loves laying on the patio and sniffing while I drink my coffee or read. While my female cat will act interested in the outdoors, but is terrified and prefers to sit by an open window.

But I've been living in a new place for about a year, and since the move, whenever my male cat comes inside, she doesn't recognize him. I've tried several different times, and the reactions have varied from puffed tail murder yowls (they had to be separated and re-introduced) to just suspicion and warning hisses.

I've tried everything I can think of, so I'm looking for input because right now it seems like the only solution is not letting him outside anymore. 

I've tried only letting him outside if she's already outside and then making sure he goes into the house first (so she doesn't think he's invading) I've tried carrying them in and out, letting them walk themselves.

I've tried rubbing her all over (especially her cheek glands) with a cloth and then rubbing him all over with the same cloth and vice versa.

I've tried high value treats through the entire process. 

They share litter boxes just fine and exhibit normal play-fighting behaviours where both of them take turns rolling on their backs.

There's no grooming or cuddling, but they sleep together every day.

It was easy in the winter, but my male cat keeps asking to go outside now that's its warm.

Any input or advice would be extremely appreciated!

~ On top of being your typical nerd I am also a huge horror movie fan to the point of considering making my own horror movie. I have a couple ideas and I would love to share them with someone who's interested in hearing them.

~ I listen to any kind of music except country cuz it all sounds the same to me lol. So if that's a deal breaker then I apologize but I just can't get into it. I also used to rap and sing and have been thinking of doing it again. I have made about 9 or 10 songs in total. Let me know if you'd like to hear something I've made.

I'm a college professor, which makes my schedule throughout MOST of the year pretty ideal for raising a family. I only need to physically be on campus two days a week (although they are LONG days), and I get long winter and summer vacations. My husband and I moved across the country a few years ago and so have no family in the area, however, his parents, and mine (mostly my mom), comes to visit for weeks at a time to help us with the baby (who is now 8 months old).

Majority of the time, we don't have any help. Grandparents are on opposite sides of the country, so my husband takes care of our baby on the days I'm on campus during the semester. Days I'm home, we have shifts where he cares for her early in the morning, and then I start from 9 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. while he works/freelances from home, and then he cares for her from 2:30 p.m. to 7 or 8:00 p.m. while I go out to a coffee shop to work/grade/prep for classes, and then I usually come home and do dinner/bath/bedtime. We do this for months at a time.

Right now I'm in the final grading push at the end of the semester, and I have hundreds of papers to grade in the next 2 weeks. I pretty much need to use as much of my free-time grading (or readying myself to grade) as much as possible, plus take care of myself and run errands, etc. I've pretty much been sleeping in if I can (since I'll also work after my daughter goes to sleep and will be up grading until 1 or 2 a.m.). I'll take care of my daughter for a few hours in the morning, but otherwise I'm not home so I can focus on work all afternoon/evening until I come back to do bedtime. 

I know I deserve a break--I know I do. But I can't help but worry that my family thinks I'm just never home, or that I'm putting all of the childcare on them. I know they don't fully think that, but still, the guilt is there. I do miss my daughter, but I also need extended periods of time by myself in order to work. I can't help but feel so guilty that I don't manage my time in such a way that doesn't lead to massive amounts of grading at once, meaning that I have to be away each day for so many hours. I'm trying to tell myself that if I had a normal 9-5 job, there'd be no way around it, it wouldn't be my fault that I have to be away, but with a flexible job like I have, I feel so bad that I still need all of that time.

Anyway, just needed to vent! Hope I'm not alone. Anyone have any other perspectives? (BTW I know I SHOULD be grading right now lol).",1,1745795644.0,NewParents,0,1.0,False

You roll the wheel, record the act, upload it to the app as a proof and get points. The points can be exchanged for gifts. Your roll is. Incest Slut. duration of the challenge is 3 month. Completing the extra challenges adds bonuses","The notification Skye had been dreading for two months, twenty-nine days, and twenty-three hours finally dinged on her phone. She clutched her eyes shut, squeezing the device with both hands. “Please be anything else,” she whispered. She dared to open one eye and saw her prayer was unanswered. 

*“Don’t let your streak end! Two more hours to complete Incest Slut”* 

Skye blasphemed under her breath. She had been playing Slut Rulette for three years and had only broken her streak once during the first year. For two years straight, she’d achieved every objective the app had given her, usually tacking on multiple bonus objectives to boot. Some had been easy, like \*Office Slut\*. All she had to do was walk into her boss’ office and suck his dick. When he bent her over the desk to fuck her, she doubled her score, then doubled it again when it turned out the boss was married.

Other tasks had been more difficult, such as \*Furniture Slut.\* In a three-month time span, Skye had to be bound at a party and used freely. Finding a safe environment had taken some time, but Skye lucked out and found a phenomenal BDSM group in town that helped her achieve not only that objective, but several more. The club wasn’t going to be any help this time, though. \*Incest Slut\* required her to “engage in sexual activities resulting in orgasm(s) with one or more member of related family.” Sure, she’d called a handful of club members “Daddy” but that wasn’t good enough for this challenge. She had tried. 

The answer to Skye’s dilemma was upstairs in his room right now. Her step-brother, Josh, was home from college. Skye was a few years older than Josh. He was nineteen, maybe twenty? She wasn’t sure and for penis related purposes eighteen was good enough for her. 

Bedding Josh should have been a home run. He was mildly attractive, with a thin, fit body, a mess of dark hair, and his dad’s piercing blue eyes. But he was quiet and rarely came down from his room except for meals. When Skye did see him, she put all her efforts to work. Brushing past him, accidentally grazing his ass as she walked by. For a month she had spent hours every day by the pool his bedroom window overlooked, sporting her skimpiest swimsuit. After a week of that with no success, she lost her top, laying out in the warm rays with her breasts exposed. After a week of \*that\* not working, she traded her swimsuit for a birthday suit. Still nothing, although Skye swore there were times she could feel his eyes on her. 

Skye blew out a breath and pulled up her thin, pink workout top. She bought it four years and one cup size ago, and she spilled out over the top of the worn hemline. The girls looked good. With a swivel of her hips, she made sure her butt matched. Her shorts revealed too much leg and were being swallowed up by her ass. Not the most comfortable fit, but with some luck she won’t be wearing it long. If Josh didn’t get hard over this, he may be gay and the streak would be a wash. 

Dressed and ready for battle, Skye made the walk up the stairs to Josh’s room and listened for sounds of activity. Nothing. There was a low hum, something playing on his phone, but nothing to indicate that he was even awake. “Fuck it,” she thought, and burst through the door. 

A whirlwind of activity spun in Josh’s bed, arms and legs flailing. When the dust settled Josh was shirtless, chest heaving, clutching a blanket up over his stomach. 

“Don’t you knock!” he shouted. Skye couldn’t keep help herself; her face slowly transforming to match a cat that had cornered a mouse. 

“What were you doing, little brother?” 

“Sleeping,” Josh said after a moment’s pause. His eyes, full of fear, made quick darts around Skye’s body. 

Slowly, deliberately, Skye stalked toward the bed. “You’re breathing pretty hard to have been sleeping. You sure you weren’t doing…something else?”

 In a flash, Skye gripped the bedding and pulled it away from Josh’s body. His hard cock, standing straight up and already slick with whatever lube he used, was not a surprise. The green lace held white-knuckled tight in his hidden hand was. Skye thought she recognized the minty color, and the stitching resembling other pairs she owned. In fact, didn’t she used to own a pair just like that? 

“Are those my panties?” she asked, the seductiveness playfulness forgotten. She waited for an answer, but when it was clear that neither truth nor lie would come, she snatched the underwear from him. “These are mine!” Skye eyed her brother and twirled the fabric around her finger. “Joshy, Joshy. Whatever were you doing, naked, with my panties?” 

“Skye,” Josh stammered. “I’m so sorry. I promise, I’ll never do anything like this ever again.” 

“Oh Joshy.” Skye straddled her brother’s stomach. “Don’t make promises I don’t want you to keep.” 

“What?” Josh fumbled awkwardly with his hands, trying to avoid skin to skin contact with his step-sister. 

“We need each other’s help,” Skye said, taking her phone out and positioning it in an ideal recording angle. “You need me to not tell Mom and Dad that you’re jacking off while sniffing my stolen panties, and I need to fuck a relative in the next two hours.” 

“What? Why?” 

Skye nodded toward the phone. “For Slut Ruletee. I have a two year streak that goes poof in two hours unless we have sex.” 

“Oh my god.” Dawning rose across Josh’s face. “That’s why you’ve been acting so weird and sunbathing naked.” 

“I knew it! You did watch me!” 

Josh’s cheeks turned stoplight red at the accusation. 

“Don’t worry about it,” Skye soothed him. She leaned in, her hair draping their faces, shrouding them in privacy. “I wanted you to.” Tenderly, she kissed the blush. A light tickle caressed her thighs, the tentative touch of fingertips. Josh was getting bolder. 

Skye swept her hair back. “So what do you say little brother? Are you going to fuck me, or do I reveal to Mom and Dad that you’re a pervert?” 

“Fuck me—I mean—fuck you.”

Skye tucked her bottom lip between her teeth. “Good boy.” She reached down and, with a brief fight, pulled her top off. The relief of finally freeing her tits was almost as satisfying as sex itself. 

Skye watched her brother watch her, his eyes locked on her chest. A thrill of pleasure coursed through her at his loss of modesty. How many times had he snuck a look at her ass, or down her shirt when she wasn’t paying attention. How many times had he cum in his hand while burying his face in her worn underwear? She felt herself getting wetter the more she thought about it, about her brother sneakily pleasing himself to her. 

“Just so you know,” Skye said, “I want you bare. I’m clean and on the pill, and I get bonus points for creampies.” 

“Skye, I’m…I’ve…” Josh’s tongue and throat were battling dryness, trying to form words and place them in the correct chronological order to create a sentence. 

“I mean,” Skye interrupted. “You don’t have to say it. If we need to wear a condom for health purposes no big deal.” 

“It’s not that,” Josh said. “I’m clean too. I’m just…” 

“You’re what? Gay? Actually not attracted to me? None of those are a requirements for this challenge.” 

“A virgin,” Josh blurted. “I’m a virgin.”

 

All the sound sucked out of the room. Outside the window a bird was singing it’s song, alerting the entire neighborhood to the juicy gossip it just heard. 

Skye laughed. “I’m so glad I got that on camera.” She leaned in and kissed him quick before he could utter any response, or worse, change his mind. “I’m going to get a huge point boost for taking your virginity.” She recaptured his lips and worked his mouth in a hot, fervent kiss. Skye was surprised to discover she really liked kissing Josh. He tasted like apple cinnamon, a remnant of his morning oatmeal, with a slight hint of coffee and caramel. He smelled like home, a warm, safe, comforting aroma. Even his touch, from his fingers and hands dancing just under her butt, to the feel of his chest under her hand, felt familiar. 

The intensity of their kiss ratcheted up and up. Lips touching, then caressing. Tongues were added. Sucking ensued. Timid hands lost their tenderness and found themselves digging through hair. Her hair. His hair. Her mouth. His mouth. Something hard and thick and definitely his bounced again her backside. Something hot and wet and definitely hers flooded Skye’s shorts. 

“Fuck!” Skye pulled back in a gasp. “You’re really good at that.” 

Josh’s mouth smirked; the first sign of attractive cockiness he’d shown since she busted in on him. “I said I was a virgin, Skye, not that I’d never kissed before.” 

“Fair enough.” Skye shifted enough to strip out of her shorts, tossing the soaking spandex to a corner of the room. A thought slipped into her mind that those shorts may end up in Josh’s face one lonely night. The idea excited her even further. “How far have you gone?” She didn’t wait for another stammering reply, didn’t want him to lose his newly found confidence. She took his hand that had been teasing up and down her thigh and placed it firmly and securely on her breast. “Have you ever done this?” 

“Touched a boob?” Josh asked. “Yeah.” His hand lifted her up, his thumb teasing and rubbing, drawing her nipple out into a stiff pointed peak. 

“Okay,” Skye said, a bit breathier than she intended. She took his free hand and placed it on the opposite tit, but didn’t release him. Her hand kept his clasped as she drew it down her body. “Tell me when we get to a place you haven’t been before.” She watched his eyes, watched him follow their joined hands as she directed his touch around her breast, down her rib cage, across the soft skin of her stomach. He almost spoke when she changed directions, tracing his fingers below her stomach and over the swell of her hips. 

“Really?” Skye asked. “No new territory?” 

Josh shook his head. “Nothing new.” 

“Hmm.” With a jerk he set his hand on her ass. “Here?” 

“Been there.” 

She set his hand on her knee. “Here?” 

“Definitely there.” 

The tracing began again, leading him up and up, to the smooth skin of her inner-thigh. 

“What about here?” 

Josh gulped, his Adam’s apple bouncing in his throat. “That’s new.” 

She moved his hand even higher, closer to her center, into an area normally hidden by even the skimpiest shorts and sluttiest of skirts. “So, this must be new then?” she asked. 

“That’s new.” 

“And, if that’s new, then that means…” She took his fingers and with the tenderest touch traced his tips across her lower lips, “this is definitely new.” 

Josh nodded, all words shorted out by the new sensation of hot wet flesh. 

Skye leaned into him so she could speak into the sensitive spot behind his ear. “Have you ever felt something so hot, so wet, before?” 

“No.” His fingers twitched on their own accord, one finding it’s way across her wet slit. She gasped at the contact, shuddered as he found his way up to her clit, sending scintillating sensations through her. She still held his hand, but no longer in the guiding grip. His hand worked on it’s own, teasing and pleasing her, brining her to a level of arousal only the worst edging had normally brought her. She felt his fingers at her entrance, then felt him breach her. Her walls clenched around the singular digit, desperate for more, fighting to be filled. 

“Josh,” she gasped as he found the rough spot inside her and began to massage. She fell onto her elbows, her hips rocking back and forth against his hand, taking him in the well learned motion she knew she needed. Daringly, the virgin below her slipped a second finger inside and Skye saw stars. It wasn’t fair that he was this good with no experience. Not fair to her that she’d had such capable hands living across the hall from her for so long; not fair that they were step-siblings and shouldn’t be engaging in this kind of mind expanding pleasure. 

Everything coiled and expanded inside her, and with a cry she exploded, her step-brother’s name gasped out with every shuddering exhale. He stopped his motions and she bit out a desperate “keep going” while she fucked his hand, until every bit of her orgasm had passed through her. 

They both stilled, Skye panting, Josh laying awkwardly with his fingers still inside his sister. He spoke first. “Did you—” 

Quickly, Skye shut him up with a kiss before he could ask the stupid question and ruin the blissful peace he’d brought on her. “Don’t speak,” she said, “just fuck me.” 

Josh removed his hand but he wasn’t fast enough. Skye reached between then, her fingers feeling his heartbeat thundering inside his hardness and with expert movement placed him inside her. Relief washed through her as she began to sink down, the needy ache being relieved in inch after agonizingly glorious inch. For a moment, she had the presence of mind to remember this was Josh’s first time, and studied him as she sank. 

He wasn’t watching her. He wasn’t moving at all. His hands held her hips in a death grip while she lowered herself, until the space between them disappeared completely. 

“Open your eyes,” Skye said, and Josh obliged. Blue eyes gazed at her with disbelief. “Congratulations brother, you’re no longer a virgin.” 

His breaths were deliberate, blown out in narrow gusts. Skye recognized the behavior of a man fighting for to keep control, and wondered if they all did the same thing. Was Josh thinking about baseball right now? He wouldn’t be for long, she’d make damn sure of that. 

She moved, and for a second she thought that would be all it took, but Josh held on. 

“Focus on me little brother,” she said as she grinded her needy clit against him. “I want you thinking about me when you cum inside me.” 

“Oh shit!” Josh’s grip tightened, squeezing the meat of her hips. “Skye!” His head fell back on the pillow. “Skye that feels so good.” 

“Damn right.” She worked harder and faster, desperate to reach her peak before he did. 

“I can’t,” Josh pleaded. “Skye I’m going to cum.” 

“Do it,” she gasped, her orgasm a fingertip out of reach. “Fill me up little brother.” 

Josh’s back arched up off the bed, his head thrown back in a might groan. Wet warmth flooded through Skye, his release invading and mingling with hers. She caught her climax and bore down on Josh, both of them wringing out the very last drops of pleasure from each other. 

Exhausted, Skye collapsed on Josh’s chest. His cock’s last spasms still inside her, their mutual juices starting to coat her thighs. Good god, she couldn’t remember the last time she’d been so full. 

“Skye,” Josh whispered as a loving hand rubbed across her back. “That was..” 

“I know, don’t ruin it.” She snuggled into his chest. He was rapidly withdrawing from her, not by choice, but she wanted to hold on to this contact as long as possible. 

A sudden remembrance brought Skye’s head up. Quickly, she shutoff the camera and submitted the video to Slut Rulette. Mission accomplished. Her phone erupted in a symphony of alerts, letting her know the challenge was complete and tabulating her bonus scores. 

“Did you get your points?” Josh asked.

My parents had me arrested over a decade ago for throwing a coffee cup against the living room wall and stating that I was trying to hit them with it. (They were 3-5 feet away from me, respectively—please believe if I wanted to hit them, I would've.) My dad physically assaulted me in the process but I'm the one who got arrested for ""domestic violence."" This is the only mark I have on my 'record' and I'm sure it follows me, professionally.

Long story short, at the end of it all, the case was dismissed. Even so, according to county people (this happened in Fairfield County, btw), nothing on your record ever 'goes away' unless the charges are sealed/expunged, and there's a whole process for that that isn't clearly spelled out anywhere. I'm not a violent person, and I need for this to go away. Anyone care to share how to do this?? Tyia!!",0,1745794857.0,Columbus,25,0.5,False
1k9gzse,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1k9gzse/q_should_i_just_show_up_to_her/,Q. Should i just show up to her?,"First of all, I feel very dumb even for asking this.

Me (M25), She (F19).

I have an anxious attachment style and I'm a huge overthinker.  
She’s avoidant, has a big ego, and is a liar. (-100000 aura for me.)

I had a 6-month relationship with this girl. She moved in with me on the second day we met. Then we spent 6 months living together. (She also lived with her ex before, so I assume this is a common pattern for her.)

At the start of the relationship, we were arguing over little things a lot, but overall we were doing fine. She’s an ""outside"" person and I’m more of an ""indoors"" guy, but I always made time for her. Still, it never fulfilled her needs — she always wanted to go out, while I had work.

Anyway, we spent almost 5 months like this. Things seemed to be improving — or at least I thought so.

The crucial thing is, her ex was living in our neighborhood. We would see him all the time — at the gym, at the store, everywhere.

She always told me she was over him. Meanwhile, that guy was begging her to get back together, but she kept refusing (or at least that’s what she told me). I made her block him.

Then we moved to a new apartment closer to her job. It was a good idea anyway, and I work remotely. Plus, I thought moving away from her ex would be good for us.

In the 6th month, I got a call from her ex. He told me that 3 weeks earlier, they met and she slept with him.

There was literally only one night when she didn’t sleep next to me — and that was the night she cheated.

Half an hour later, she came home. I calmly asked her about it.  
She admitted it.  
She said I didn’t give her enough attention (which I did, it just was never enough for her).

She said it wasn’t an excuse and that it was a huge mistake.  
She also said our relationship was bad.

I asked her, ""If you felt that way, why didn’t you tell me so I could try to fix it?""  
But I guess she’s still a child mentally.

She begged me to stay and promised to fix everything.

I stayed 3 more days, but every time I looked at her face, I saw her ex too.  
After 3 days, I told her I was leaving — while still loving her.

Then I moved to a different city and went back to my family’s house. 2 months of no contact. During that time(i guess end of the first month) she blocked me on ig out of nowhere.

After 2 months of no contact, I drunk-called her at 4AM two weeks ago. We talked for about 2 hours.

She told me her life was super fun now, she loved being single, and she loved being able to date whoever she wanted.

During that 2 months, I hit the gym 4 days a week and got into the best shape of my life (been doing bodybuilding for 2 years).

Then I drunk-called her again last week.  
Again, we talked for about 2 hours at 3AM. She told me that she has a boyfriend but i think that is a lie.

So yeah, I still had hope (hope for a hoe if you want to call it that).

Btw, my social life is absolute zero. I just work and gym, nothing else.

2 days ago, I called her again for a casual talk (this time sober).

Today afternoon, she video-called me while she was working out and asked how to do a lateral raise.  
I showed her and we hung up.

Tonight, I called her again and we talked for about an hour.

She told me that she’s ultra-social and always has dates.  
This weekend, she was planning a trip with a guy to a different city, including a hotel stay — but I also think that's a lie, because it was a different guy than the one she mentioned before.  
If she had a boyfriend, I think she wouldn’t be able to do that, right?

I told her I wanted to meet up casually — like grabbing coffee or something.

She asked when.  
I said, ""As soon as possible. Like tonight."" (We're 3 hours apart btw.)

She said she couldn’t because of work.

I said, ""It won’t affect your life that much.""

Then she told me she doesn't want to meet face-to-face but wants to keep talking on the phone.

She gave me an ultimatum: if I insist on meeting up, she’ll block me.

Then, and I feel really dumb for this, I told her, “I’ll just show up tomorrow after your work. If you really don’t want to see me, you can just walk away. I won’t chase or stop you.”

She got mad and told me *not to come* even though I said she could just walk away.

**My question is:**

Should I just show up tomorrow, accept whatever happens (even if she walks away), and know that at least I shot my shot?

I don’t want to be friendzoned like this — talking for weeks and months but getting nowhere.  
If that happens, I'm out.

I'm in my 20s, and I haven't travelled alone, so becoming a digital nomad is something I want to try out before actually settling down in the future.

Currently, the plan is to go from New Zealand to Mexico City sometime around late 2025 to early 2026. My work is entirely remote, and ideally, I want to spend 3-4 months there before returning home.

However, I have some doubts about some aspects when it comes to planning accommodation. One of my biggest concerns is the approach to finding safe accommodation.

* How far in advance do you typically begin the search, and is it worth waiting a little longer before prices drop? Also, does your booking timeline vary by season, region, or platform
* What factors influence your decision when choosing a rental? I can see from AirBnB that some properties don't have proper amenities, so ideally, I would like to avoid and not live in a coffee shop...
* How do you verify neighbourhood safety, convenience, and accuracy of listings?
* Lastly, is information usually transparent when looking for bookings, Or are there some potential red flags that I need to look out for to avoid potential headaches when booking accommodation?",0,1745794731.0,IWantOut,1,0.25,False
