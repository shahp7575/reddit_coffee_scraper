1jg8fl6,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1jg8fl6/no_one_loves_me_like_i_do/,No one loves me like I do,"It’s been a few months since we last spoke, and I’ve come a long way.

The decision to initiate no contact was, in a way, my first act of love toward myself. It was the first time I chose myself over you, and I’ve grown so much since then.

There are moments when I wish you could see it, and I think you’d be proud of who I’ve become. In what feels like such a short time, I’ve made so much progress. I’ve been taking better care of myself, sticking to my medication, and working through deep-seated wounds I’ve carried for far too long. In hindsight, I realize you were a distraction back then. I needed you, but I didn’t fully see that I was depending on you in ways that weren’t healthy for either of us. With your support, I took risks I wouldn’t have otherwise taken. In the process, I learned so much about myself, love, and life. And for that, I’ll always be grateful for the time we shared.

But I also feel incredibly embarrassed by who I was.

The person I am now would hardly recognize the girl I used to be. I didn’t realize how sick—physically and mentally—I had become during our final months together. Though that was largely due to my attachment issues, it doesn’t excuse the way I was treated.

I didn’t deserve what you put me through.

I begged you for empathy. I cried on the floor, feeling like I was losing my mind, because no matter how distant you became, you insisted that “nothing was wrong.” When I confided in you about having unsafe thoughts, you just stared at me—like I was an inconvenience. “Do you think you should go to the hospital?” you asked, without an ounce of care. And then, you let me drive home alone, late at night, on the edge of exhaustion, without checking in after. You were too busy with your friends. I would never have treated you like that. When you were in crisis, I was there, supporting you through both the darkest and brightest moments. But I was repaid with disinterest, lies, and broken promises. Our shared vision for the future became just yours, with no regard for what we had talked about. Your words and actions didn’t align, and I ended up knowing your feelings before you even realized them. It wore me down. I felt ashamed of who I had become—going through your phone, obsessively tracking your location, waiting for your calls, and desperately searching for the love I thought I had lost. But all I found was more proof of what my intuition had already told me.

I find it almost ironic how things ended. I thought you were so in love with me. I believed you would never dispose of me like you had with others. What we had felt special—plans for weddings, baby names, inside jokes, and shared memories. But looking back, it was all just a fantasy. It’s humbling to realize that the breakup I had been contemplating for months came at my most vulnerable moment. Then again, you were always more selfish than I was.

I’ve had a lot of time to reflect, and a lot of therapy sessions to process everything. I’ve studied attachment theory, pieced everything together, and I understand now why things unfolded the way they did. We were the perfect example of the avoidant-anxious dynamic—two people caught in a cycle of dependence and distance, bound by naivety but struck by reality. How could I rely on you when you couldn’t even rely on yourself?

I’ve worked incredibly hard to become who I am today. For the first time in what feels like forever, I’m proud of who I’ve become. I love who I am. The parts you once criticized are the parts I now cherish most. I’m driven, funny, caring, beautiful, and pretty damn amazing. I would love to be with me—and that’s why you’ll never have that chance again.

I still care about you. I feel for you, even now. But this isn’t about revenge. I know you needed the love I gave you, and I won’t forget the times I was there when you felt like no one else was. I hope, for your sake, you’ll find a way to pick yourself up now. You deserve to feel the relief, joy, and excitement for life that I’m finally experiencing. But I know you won’t get there until you start healing—and I fear you’re not ready for that yet. It took me a long time to get here, and though it was painful, I wouldn’t have made it without the lessons I learned through you.

Every now and then, the memories creep in. I still mention you in passing conversations you have no business being in. Sometimes I miss you at night, when I’m alone with my thoughts. But I realize now that the person I loved is gone. This nostalgia I feel is just another fantasy—just like our relationship was.

I won’t reach out to you again. I’ve said my goodbyes, and I meant them. This is for me. I need to let myself feel what I need to feel in order to fully heal and move forward. I hope you’re doing the same. Maybe one day, we can have coffee and talk like old friends. But I’m not there yet—and I don’t think your pride would allow it, either.

1jg8fff,https://www.reddit.com/r/ANRelationship/comments/1jg8fff/38_m4f_toronto_breastfeeding_breastplay_lactation/,"38 [M4F] #toronto - breastfeeding, breastplay, lactation, adult nursing relationship","Hey there,

Online dating is new to me, so bear with me. I’m told writing essays online isn’t the way to go, but it’s the only way I know how to communicate something that is so important to me.

My experience with online dating is virtually zilch. I’ve met my previous partners in the real world over the years and always love the old fashioned way of sparking a connection: putting myself out there and being playful. The threat of failure was part of the process, which made it even better when you met someone you truly clicked with.

I’ve recently decided that not finding the right partner that I click with, on a very deep emotional level, is no longer an option. For me that means finding a woman who is nurturing and caring at her core, who has a strong desire or curiosity for lactation and desires the deepest of intimate connections with some intrigue about the concept of breastfeeding their partner. I’m putting myself out there and posting here with the goal of making my own luck. I genuinely believe someone out there is waiting for what I have to offer, and I want to complete them as much as they will complete me. 

Physically, I am 6’1” tall, broad shouldered, carry myself with confidence. Women describe me as tall, dark and handsome, however I’m convinced that women conflate what they think as handsome with their attraction to my assertive, ambitious and dominant nature. Women have told me they feel more feminine and sexual with me and that they see me as the “provider”, Daddy, type.

I’m looking for a needle in a haystack. I want to meet a woman who loves breast and nipple play, and has a strong desire to produce breastmilk and feed their partner. I love everything to do with breasts. Truly. I love breasts, areolas and nipples of all sizes and colour. I can suck and play with them all day if I could. I also have strong hands and give great massages, which can be handy if you’re inducing or attempting to relactate. I have also been told I have a good latch, but know everyone is different, and look forward to figuring out what’s perfect for you.

So here is what I have in mind. Once we exchange a few texts, let’s try to meet for a walk or coffee to feel each other out. From there we can decide the pace that feels natural knowing that at the end of that journey is the potential for a connection with each others mind, body and soul at the deepest level possible.

If anything I’ve mentioned interests you, please send me a DM. Even if you’re slightly curious or nervous, I encourage you to message me.  Life is too short, and I don’t want us both to miss any more chances of meeting each other.

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/namenerds/comments/1j4g6no/my_daughter_wants_me_to_rename_her/)**: March 5, 2025**

My 18 year old daughter came out as a transgender woman. My husband and I have been 100% supportive (and I very much welcome another girl in the house — she has 3 brothers!). She expressed initially that she was comfortable going by her birth name, as it is gender neutral, but after turning 18 and getting ready for college, she’s decided she needs a new name. And, she wants me to choose it! She says that she still wants to be named by her mama. I melted.🥹

I come seeking ideas! Her only parameter is that it’s nothing that “seems like she renamed herself”; by this I’m assuming more ‘out there’ names are out. It’s such a challenge picking a name for someone you already know so well, and not a newborn!

She’s incredibly intelligent, bookish, shy but spunky, and a total sweetheart. Gorgeous, curly red hair and freckles. We are a family of Jewish-Irish descent and her brothers are Lev, Raphael ‘Raf’ and Elias. I never had girl names picked out, as I found out later in the game.

Do any names come to mind with this description? Her middle name will be Miriam (family name). Thank you in advance!

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Did you have any baby names picked out for a girl when you were pregnant with your boys? Personally, I love traditional names. I’d go with something along the lines of Ruth, Rachel, or Anna.

Wanting to be named by her mama :’) that really made my day.

>**OOP:** I did not! I found out about my pregnancies fairly late into the game so it was never really a question.

Commenter: Eliana

this whole situation is so sweet, happy for you and her! 💕

>**OOP:** I love this name. Would be one of my top contenders if not so similar to her brother’s!

Commenter: To not seem like she renamed herself, I would suggest names that were ranking in the year she was born.

Suggestions:

* Alicia
* Caitlin
* Callie
* Keira
* Phoebe
* Nadia
* Natalie

>**OOP:** Good thinking! Keira is lovely.

Commenter: Rebekah

>**OOP:** Rebecca is taken.. by me! Otherwise it would be a fantastic suggestion 😆

Commenter: Leah, Elizabeth, Aliza (really like this one), Anna, Delilah, Eve

>**OOP:** Aliza is lovely, thank you.

Commenter: This is so incredibly wholesome. 🤍 I intentionally chose my son’s name to be gender neutral both because I love gender neutral names but I also wanted to make sure the option to keep his name what it is would still be there should he ever come out as trans.

Had my son been a girl, his name might have stayed the same that it is right now. however—I REALLY loved Julian August and would’ve been on the fence about using it instead. I guess I could’ve used it for him anyway but something about Julian as a girl’s name just seems prettier to me, idk. I’m also a big fan of Lillian, Elaine, Meredith, Margot, Teagan, Parker and Chandler. Just to name a few lol picking baby names (even though your baby isn’t exactly a baby anymore lol) is my favorite pastime. 😂

Again, I can’t say enough how much I love this post and the sentiment behind it. Your family sounds so full of love. If you’ve got room for another daughter, I went no contact with my parents years ago and am free to a good home 😂💀

>**OOP:** There’s always room, sweetheart! Dinner’s at 7 ❤️ and Lillian is lovely.

Most Awarded Comment:  How incredibly touching 🥹

Let’s preface this by saying that this will be long and mushy. I took this very, very seriously and would love to share the experience. Feel free to skip to the bottom for the name reveal (sharing with her full blessing!)

First of all, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for the outpouring of support. The love far outweighed the hate, and we were absolutely awestruck by the support. I still have quite a few private messages to get through, but please know that I will read each and every one of them and do my best to respond!

I got quite a few comments asking why I would post to Reddit when my daughter asked ME to name her. The answer is that I’m simply not a very creative person, and trying to come up with a name from scratch is so, so hard! I haven’t named a baby in 16 years and we have an enormous family - ie, difficult to think of names that we love AND aren’t taken. I came here for inspiration and received more than I could’ve ever wished for!

Going about choosing was incredibly difficult, but I eventually got my list down to a top 3. They needed to past a few tests. 1. Does the name suit her? 2. Would 2006 me have chosen this name? 3. Does it sound out of whack with her brothers’ names? And most importantly… does she love it?

I brought the top 3 to her and she said “Mom, this is defeating the purpose. I don’t want to choose!” So, I had another idea. We would have 3 little coffee/lunch dates around the city and use a different name to order with, so she could feel each name out and see if any of them were definitive no’s. That ruled out Talia - gorgeous name, but didn’t feel quite right to her. Aviva was also a top contender that didn’t make the cut.

I mulled over the final two for what seems like years… but I chose, and she expressed that it was secretly her favorite too! It felt like divine intervention to be in this situation, considering this name, with Purim so close.

I am the incredibly proud mama of Esther Miriam! I absolutely love it, and so does she. “Essie May” evolved as a nickname from her father overnight, and it made me fall in love even more. May was the nickname of her namesake and she happens to be a May baby. Esther also has immense meaning to us as Jews, and I can absolutely say that 2006 me would’ve chosen it. The runner-up was Naomi.

I could not have done it without this forum. Thank you all so very much for sharing this with me. ❤️",78,1742529607.0,BestofRedditorUpdates,11,0.91,False

For those who work from coffee shops often. My questions to you are:

- Are you buying a coffee & a treat every day?
( that’s minimum $10/day, $50/week, $200/month)

- What are you doing for lunch? Buying lunch daily too? Or bringing lunch and eating it at the coffee shop? 
(buying lunch is also a minimum of $200/month)

- Are we spending full days in a coffee shop? Or just half a day and going home to eat?

Wondering if renting a co-working space would make more fiscal sense (would love insight on cost for these places if you have any).

CONTEXT:
I will be moving into a much smaller place soon, and I imagine I will spend way more days working in coffee shops. Possibly every day. I’m thinking about the logistics and it seems expensive!

Currently, I work from my desk setup in my bedroom, and probably go to a coffee shop 1-2 times a month. I will spend the whole day, buy a specialty coffee or 2, and a treat. I will go to a restaurant nearby for lunch. 

Trying to figure out how to do this daily coffee shop thing, or if I should consider a co-working space instead.

1jg84jj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1jg84jj/wife_says_i_work_too_much/,Wife says I work too much,"I’m 21 (M), wife is 22 (F) - I retired her when I was 20, as we were engaged and I dropped out of college to pursue a career in the industry I am in now. I have had a lot of success so far, but of course it has come at the cost of a ton of hard work, and a lot of failure. She does not work at all, but does take care of the house and keeps it clean, does laundry, etc. All of which I am grateful for (although she only cooks 2-3 days max out of the week) 

I am in a strenuous process of looking to make a hire in my business asap, as we are about 2 weeks out from having our first baby girl. 
Within the last few days I have made $0, super stressed, due to relentlessly promoting the job opportunity and reviewing hundreds of applications - none of which have been truly qualified for the job, as it does require some skills and experience, and I have been very particular due to it being a high-risk / high-reward industry in terms of how much $ it costs to keep running. So, that has been stressful - but regardless, my wife is extremely ungrateful for the work I put in. I give my all to her, and to providing for our family/future family. Making sure that she can do whatever she wants, whenever she wants. She regularly sleeps in until 11-Noon (before and during pregnancy both), and she then sits on her phone a good bit of the day, along with hanging out with her friends, going to coffee dates, walking the dogs, etc. I feel I give her a super easy life… and I don’t nag her either. 
I am happy to work hard and provide, I feel it is my purpose. But like today, I come upstairs after working super hard, training a potential employee for hours, and eventually deciding that he was months of training away from making us money (great heart, no skill) - so I’m slightly upset, but ready to call it a day at 7pm and put my phone/work away. I sit down with her, and she says “so do you want to go out to eat or want me to make dinner?” I said I don’t care but would prefer to just stay home so we don’t stay out late - so she took 4 day old refrigerated mashed potatoes, and frozen Tyson chicken from the freezer, put them together, threw it in the oven, and called it dinner. I’m peculiar about what I eat (she complains I eat too much steak and beef and not enough of anything else) - and when I walked into the kitchen and sat down at the table, she said “you don’t have to eat dinner if you don’t want this” and I took her up on it, personally I would’ve rather not ate, than ate that. But I didn’t complain or say anything negative whatsoever, I just said “okay”. Then she goes “ARE YOU NOT EATING DINNER?!” I said “you just told me I didn’t have to, not I’m not going to” - I was just going to sit there with her (phone away etc) - then she said “GET OUT OF MY FACE, GET AWAY FROM ME, GO DOWNSTAIRS” (my office is downstairs) 

I didn’t even argue, I just went downstairs. 

So, that led to me utilizing my time to prospect for more potential employees, leading to multiple phone calls until about 10pm - when I decided to come back upstairs to shower and get in bed. When I got upstairs, she raised her voice about how I don’t give a shit about her and only care about work. I then raised my voice back about how my duty as a man is to provide for her, and that the purpose of me working so hard is so that in the very near future, I have the $ to outsource each of my tasks and ultimately automate the business - so I can be much more present for her and our baby girl. Mind you, we are both very young… so I am doing everything I can to sacrifice now, so that it serves us for the rest of our lives. 

She then tells me that providing financially doesn’t mean I’m providing at all… I then get very angry and yell saying that me providing financially is providing her with the new couch she’s sitting on, the hot water she showered with, the bed she sleeps in, the food she makes, the house we live in, the car she drives, the bed she sleeps in, the freedom that she has to never work but rather ‘play’, the security our family will have forever, and etc you get it… she then started crying and I left to get in the shower. When I got out, I got in our bed where she was, and asked her if she thought about what I said. She then told me to leave and sleep on the couch. So here I am, on the couch at 11:45pm, knowing I’m waking up at 5am to work all day again. 

I just want to give my family the best life, and I feel she is the opposite of a supporter, and rather a hater. Maybe this is because she’s just super pregnant, but I don’t think so because she has always been very rude and ungrateful - maybe I have been too, I know I’ve been rude and very intense.. but what is your feedback?

I’ve never cheated on her, I quit smoking marijuana a because she didn’t like it and I got serious about being productive, better, and healthy, I don’t abuse her, I don’t nag her, I don’t ditch her to hang out with friends, I simply work a lot and spend time with her when I’m not working. She always told me ‘her ex brought out the worst in her’ , and has since then said the same about me. I’ve told her that she is the common denominator, but of course this never goes well. I have said a lot of hurtful things to her, and even tonight I told her I am tired of her bitching at me all of the time, especially when the work I put in directly correlates to the free life that she lives, getting anything she wants. 

My parents have been together for 50 years (adopted me), and her mom has had children with 4 different men. She never had a true father figure, and simply does not know how to respect me as a man. What do I do?
We are having a baby and leaving her has never been an option, but she has completely checked out, unless she’s got something to nag about. Will this pass? Or am I fucked for the rest of my life? ",1,1742529245.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False

1jg81l9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jg81l9,Vermispiracy,"My youth education garden gets lots of volunteers, and I have young students that come on Saturdays to learn and feel safe.

We make oodles of compost, both hot piles and worm wedges. we get kitchen scraps and coffee grounds from a local cafe, leaves and grass from our other outdoor programs in our non profit, wood chips from our wildfire fuels reduction program, garden waste, manure from one of my volunteers who had pigs and steers, and smiles from everyone who walks by and sees us working. Our piles are rich and fat.

This largest pile went cold over the winter, so you know I had to call in my wiggly gooey noodle friends to help finish it up. You can throw a fork into this thing and literally never miss a worm, 3 different species have moved in (I added red wigglers), and we also just spotted our first couple soldier flies (pic 2). Hard to tell in the first picture but the pile is about 8 feet long and 3.5 feet tall.

I give compost away to neighbors, community members, other public gardens in the area, and the families of my students.

 This will be the largest worm castings pile I have ever made. I use the stuff for lots of things. We make our own potting mix with coco coir, vermiculite, and homemade screened compost. The castings specifically are absolutely perfect for making soil blocks. It's like a soil block cheat code. A worm wendingo. A vermispiracy

The kids love digging through the pile looking for bugs and worms. Kinda like chickens, but they don't eat what they find (thankfully).

I try to start a new hot pile every 3rd week. We are rebuilding our 3 bay system (a local boy scout is going to do it for us, using it to complete his eagle scout project) so right now we just do it the old fashioned way. Lasagna til it's at my belly button!

Rats have figured out what we are doing. But they only had about 1 month of free bread before the local cats discovered the honey pot. Now there's no rats. Sometimes I honestly miss them, they would get proper drunk off of eating so much bread that they wouldn't even be scared of us, just taking obese naps in the sun next to the pile. Kinda cute

If you worm ranchers are making castings, I highly recommend making soil blocks with it. They're the best soil blocks I've ever made and I add 0 fertilizer. The starts get huge and happy. Next to 0 transplant shock, and the only money we spent was on coir and verm.

And yes. When the kids are gone, I pee on the pile.

I was right.. no intellectual people on here anymore, they all left. Nothing about the acting writing or even the politics of the game or tv adaption.

1jg7sta,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1jg7sta/coffee_shop_or_coworking_space/,Coffee shop or co-working space?,"For those who work from coffee shops often. My questions to you are:

- Are you buying a coffee & a treat every day?
( that’s minimum $10/day, $50/week, $200/month)

- What are you doing for lunch? Buying lunch daily too? Or bringing lunch and eating it at the coffee shop? 
(buying lunch is also a minimum of $200/month)

- Are we spending full days in a coffee shop? Or just half a day and going home to eat?

Wondering if renting a co-working space would make more fiscal sense (would love insight on cost for these places if you have any).

CONTEXT:
I will be moving into a much smaller place soon, and I imagine I will spend way more days working in coffee shops. Possibly every day. I’m thinking about the logistics and it seems expensive!

Currently, I work from my desk setup in my bedroom, and probably go to a coffee shop 1-2 times a month. I will spend the whole day, buy a specialty coffee or 2, and a treat. I will go to a restaurant nearby for lunch. 

Trying to figure out how to do this daily coffee shop thing, or if I should consider a co-working space instead.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jg7p5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spectrum/comments/1jg7p5e/someone_please_help_ill_buy_ya_a_coffee/,someone please help i’ll buy ya a coffee,"hi yall, i’ve had spectrum for almost 20+ years in my home and i have had these issues recently 

the start: basically we were doing home remodeling and they cut the outside wire. no biggie. spectrum came, reinstalled a new wire etc. all good no issues 

later on in the week, internet is randomly disconnecting, ping is spiking up. rubber banding is apparent. now i use my own router(eero pro 6e)and i figured that hmm is it the eeros or the modem? so i went ahead called spectrum, they said everything was good on their end. they restarted it and it was all good 

now, every day it either randomly cuts off on its own or i rubber band severely mid game. i’m hard wired into the mesh wifi node so idk how. i called spectrum and they told me to replace the modem. i went into a store. switched it out and all was good for the night 

THEN AGAIN.. same issue. now i’m thinking okay it’s def the routers. i returned the eero pro 6e under warranty and get the max 7… <- keep in mind i dont even have fiber and this system costs literally 1K

internet works then boom same issue again. so now im on the top of the line asus mesh wifi system meant for gaming and have had the same issue again. 

spectrum denies any issue 
eero and asus say the same 

but my devices still face this 

what can i do :(

1jg7ot9,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobcorps/comments/1jg7ot9/my_candid_interest_in_signing_up/,My Candid Interest in Signing Up,"\* A quick note sorry for the long format but I am really trying to put a finger on my situation in life right now, I seek advice on how to proceed forward at a crossroads like this. I genuinely sense I’m out of all other options, I don’t want to go in blind and mess up this opportunity in my own way I want to cover as many bases as I can\*

I’ve been contemplating it for a while now and I think I have my mind made up on learning an essential trade at this point in my life to get somewhere in terms of a working career and a stepping stone for my functional adult life from what sounds like a feasible setup. I’m 24 and have been stuck living with my mom for 5 years, I’ve made multiple attempts to strike out to become independent but due to obvious external factors like the pandemic, ongoing economic hardship (with a single mom since age 7 to boot), dropping out of college, increasing loss of affordable living, and continual weak job security I am still with her which makes me essentially homeless with no means. The place I currently live in is rural and all the jobs around me expect you to have a working vehicle obviously (can’t even do the local Subway) which I don’t being the first biggest barrier not to mention the few others right next door requiring experience in manufacturing or automotives since I live in the industrial part of town. I even tried to ask in person for applications around town but they turn you down, due to the system being online for the most part now made worse with multiple interview rounds/AI skipping your hit or miss resume and a lot of the work around here involves accumulated blue collar expertise out of my reach. It’s come to the point I do want to throw myself out there for once but not have to be forced to hang my ass out to dry like so many others. I need/seek a jumping off point because I have suffered from being out of the loop from my little tastes of working life taken from me too soon on multiple occasions. I don’t want to lose all hope or sink into a victim mentality when I actually do have a foreseeable choice that I’ve come to understand as a sacrifice worth making. I want the chance to be part of SOMETHING important and permanent, not just another low position corporate body so easily replaceable doing something that kills me inside. I don’t take what I do have now for granted, I can’t let negativity discourage me or to needlessly over blame myself for things out of my control when taking this route is something that I can be in control of.



**Work Experience:**



My track record with employment is there but isn't that impressive but I’m fortunate to have 4 various kinds of occupation under my belt at this rate to get a sense of what I align with from each. A common thing I noticed about myself is I like to be in the middle of the action or work up towards it then I’m more content. I like being a busybody. I suffer from the common issue of having months to a year long gaps of unemployment between and having to leave off the former workplaces that I was let go from in a dramatic fashion or had unpleasant encounters I didn’t ask for, who would give me a bad rap if I named them. I’m well aware of that and that my low numbers can make me look bad on record if I hope to continue being hired even for entry level positions. No, I don't want to have to lie on paper simply because I want to keep my integrity if I can even though it’s come to that in the field more than ever presently. 		



My first job was in April 2018 when I was a junior I started off solely as a Dishwasher for a Valentino's buffet doing carts full of dining plates/cups/utensils on rotation and cooking ware at the end of shift. After 2 weeks of proving my reliability on the sink I was then grouped up with the rest of kitchen staff simultaniously maintaining the salad bar/buffet, bringing out carts of the cleaned silverware, folding pizza boxes, handling drive thru window for salad/pizza orders, prepping meat sauce/dough/lasagna, marinating chicken, unpacking/chopping vegetables, replacing trash/throwing out cardboard, and by the end I got learn to cook some of the food like hand making pizza/making fried chicken with the pressure cooker a bit before having to quit due to moving it lasted 4 months. The thing I liked about it was that I got to move up within the workforce at a good pace, put on more important things and learning the layout like the back of my hand. 	



My second job was after graduation in May 2019,  I didn’t bother with college at first so I apprenticed under my older friend’s connection with his employer's contractor company for 8 months. My longest employment to this day doing things around the central area of the state from day long labor, demolition of old homes, cleaning the worksite, carrying supplies like nails/screws on hand, transporting boards I cut, connecting extension cords/charging devices, setting up air pressures, taking measurements, caulking, walking on scaffolding/climbing ladders, making floor/connecting joint brackets, building up wooden framing, putting in insulation, applying plastic/metal siding (fascia/soffit), excavating for basement foundation cement, using tools: tape/chalk line, pythagoras square, spirit level, drills, miter/circular saws, various nail guns, and grinders. This was all I was able to be taught in that stretch of time, I never got to be part of a completed project besides home repairs nor was it on a scale/level of resource you’d find in a city but I got an introduction to being part of a crew performing manual necessities in an agricultural setting. I was warned plenty of times that it was hard work that I did find out daily but I felt very accomplished each end of the day, that I could go out in the world and materialize things out of my brain or by hand. It was like an acknowledgement that I was improving myself and my surroundings. It felt like being part of a movement that’s the biggest aspect I would like to have back and go further next time. 	



My third job was 2 months in June 2021 for the service industry again at a second hand Krispy Kreme location afternoon shift. The posting only said cashier (front/drive thru) you know pressing order items doing math handling cash or card but the place was small so it involved every other task. All the workers were operating a headset, filling the display with the usual array or occasional theme, putting a selected number in boxes/bags, coating the chocolate sprinkled frosted ones/filling the raspberry or creme ones, making hot/cold coffee drinks, throwing out donuts end of shift, dishwashing trays/filling tubes, replacing the machines fillings, taking apart the chocolate bowl to clean, sweeping/mopping the floor, wiping down counters/tables, replacing coffee filters/iced tea for morning, stocking carrier boxes or bags/plastic gloves/napkins/milk by date, emptying the registers to put in the safe, locking the doors, and unloading the fresh milk/donuts off the delivery truck once weekly from the main location. Though it was the same industry as the buffett it was different because I was in the direct spotlight this time with just myself and one other person mostly under that weight, the one thing I got out of it was the constant routine of multitasking while expanding my stress/performance skills. It was also cool being part of an iconic company for a bit. 	



My fourth and recent job was 3 months in June 2023 at PetSuppliesDelivered under PetPawsRx a pet/livestock pharmacy + retailer nationwide in the warehouse section. The warehouse area was separated into two large parallel rooms, in the left room against the wall were stations for each of us full of writing tools, exacto/box cutting knives/scissors, various tapes, labelling stickers, and different sized boxes that we use to create packaged orders.. A conveyor line went up the side of our stations looping through 2 of 6 aisles that filled the rest of the left room’s space, we start at the other end of this line in the first aisle where printed lists in empty crates would be waiting, we would collect said items off the shelves moving in order of the aisle letter’s ABCDEF checking them off with a pen, once we finished completing a crate we’d stick the pen in the side hole and would add them up at the end near our stations till we finished all, then we would pass them through our stations boxing them up. Sometimes an order would be too small no crate required, just a single crate, or multiple at a time it depends on the buyer. A final conveyor line for our finished work went towards the back of the building where someone handling the computer put the barcode/order information sticker on before storing them at the loading dock waiting for arriving trucks.. Our customer base always varied from individual owners, stores, to livestock ranchers, or farmers. The animal clientele covered dogs, cats, birds, horses, and cattle. Their products range from allergy relief, anxiety, sleep, arthritis/joint care, muscle care, coat/skin care, dental care, flea & tick control, dewormers, medication, diarrhea treatment, digestion, disinfectants, antiseptics, ear care, vitamins, supplements, milk replacer, ointments, shampoos, sprays, and toys for playing. They have treats like Butcher’s Block or Greenies, flavored chews/tablets/capsules/pastes, and bird food. Prescribed vaccines came with vials/syringes out of the pharmacy in front of the warehouse directly or stored in a freezer between the two large rooms which we would take out of and box in ice packed styrofoam coolers in specific white colored boxes with special “FRAGILE/VACCINE/!” stickers. Our main focus was to complete orders from print to cardboard when we had no more for the day we would find ways to be busy like keeping our stations clean, stocking our supplies, taking excess plastic/cardboard to the basket trucks, stacking up crates/pallets, cutting flaps off product boxes for easier access, dumping the basket trash into dumpsters, and when the aisles were running low we would refill them by transferring contents from the right room where we stored our received products in bulk that a forklift driver would take off the high storage shelves. I learned in this transitory environment how behind the scenes it functions, the goal of moving goods to or from our place to the next on the clock. The dynamic here really stuck with me when it comes to a factor in life, things or systems always being in motion. It personally felt unique like I was an active middleman, a crucial piece in supply and demand.  



\*Speaking for myself I really like to put my nose to the grind, it helps me feel like my inner self is reaching the outer. There are negative aspects that bring me down in the process but I don’t like to make them the center unless it’s impactful. I wrote this section to help me look back to understand myself and get an aiding perspective from others. I think I have a strong mind for retaining information and maybe you can steer that if like minded.\* 

  


**Center location:**



\*I am from Nebraska and currently live in the southeast part. I don’t want to go to a far away one because I no longer have a running vehicle so I wouldn’t be able to leave campus much unless I pick a close location, plus my mother could take me back home an hour away to recuperate and I figured I’d still have to live with her longer afterwards if a job/housing isn’t insured. I’ll be honest it's scary to be far away from my family for a prolonged period for the first time in life and I can’t predict if any center could set me on my feet from a world or people I know. This is the closest one and I’m told it’s more practical to attend one near you:\*



* **Denison, Iowa**



This is actually a half hour away from the town where I was born in Harlan. It’s not like I’m uprooting very far but still that adjustment being by myself a distance away as mentioned, however I’ve had my eyes peeled on this place for a while thinking it's right to jump the nest there. I see this location is pretty much limited to Construction and Health Care, but I’m used to living in the country that only needs the bare essentials of infrastructure as opposed to urban settings. I'm not a big city person so I’m cool with that having grown up in a small college town. Since I mentioned my second job beforehand that overlaps with their construction programs, which ones would I pair best with?. While I can be part of a “Building Construction Technology” aspect with a team that handles putting materials together I don’t want to be in charge per say haha. I have no problem being a background follower in that regard, I'm worried about not fitting the brains behind the operations. For Bricklayer I have no gripes about being a simple bricklayer in my mind, it sounds pretty understandable that it includes doing a key single field. One of the places I was a construction apprentice for in the past was a coffee house (post frame design?), I got to see stonemasons later apply a lower rocky facade that I was impressed by after we finished the front end. My earlier stint with construction naturally involved a lot of Carpentry so I think this would be a straightforward groove for me to fall into. Although it mentions “major” infrastructure projects while the only ones I was on were more simple like a two story home, that post frame coffee house, a farm shed, and formwork for a body shop. The most important thing to me I saw from the Virtual Tour website was the Driver’s Education program here. I was late to driving but I got my license at 20 shortly before my third job at Krispy Kreme, I got about 7 months of experience going back and forth from home to work/college. But when we moved to the current place we live at in early 2022 my vehicle had brakes/wheel bearings/shocks that needed repaired but I was unemployed again by that point. My mom couldn’t cover the repairs nor both insurances and her ongoing car payments at the same time so it’s been sitting unused since then. I was going to use my income from my third job to get it back running, but my sister needed what I made so she didn’t become homeless (her and my two nephews stayed with us) so it probably has become more rundown. I’m pretty sure it’s efficient enough to help kids get their license but for my own sake I hope it can reteach me in case I lost muscle memory. I see they have a driving simulator with a racing chair from the classroom image that looks helpful and cool. 

  


* **Transfer to Wyotech after?**



A direction that I feel more akin to is automotives but the problem is there are no centers for that  in the middle of the country where I live. I tend to think my mind is more drawn to understanding mechanics and engineering. My parents think so too as did my older friend who has since passed away, he taught me alot about myself. He was raised to be a mechanic, also did construction in trade school, and went to college to work on windmills. He could take apart an engine and put it back together in one sitting. The guy was a savant, he was also into hotrods and competed in drag races. A lot of my family from both sides were blue collar workers so I feel I inherited this sense or was born into it. I’ve been around my father, uncles (one of them just retired from trucking), and my friend who I got to join in as they did repairs/checkups themselves. I saw oil changes, replacing tires, replacing brake rotor/pads, fixing a brake pad pressure sensor, replacing a left cv shaft, repairing ball joints, fixing transmission, replacing a starter, replacing a steering column, replacing a radiator, and replacing windshield wipers. I haven’t seen every breakdown yet but I got to see a lot of common maintenance and it always raises my curiosity meter no matter what. I think my interest in this speaks for itself. My dad thinks it’s a strong suit of mine and wants me to go here possibly after JobCorp because our cousin lives in Laramie WY who previously worked in an oil refinery who now owns a construction business, maybe my dad wants to me to work/live with him as I can pursue being an automotive technician too! On the website it mentions you’ll learn on the spot as well. 

  


**Mentioning my NeuroDivergence:**



Since it directly impacts me always I want to put it out there that I’m on the spectrum (high functioning). I have never received any social security that my parents did try to apply for and I was cut off disability in 2017 after my diagnosis at school. I definitely think that if I would’ve been able to stay on it I would have been on my own long by this point. I think at that time they removed a lot of people including me due to having “not severe enough” diagnosis or huge numbers of fraudulent incomers. I have no clue but something caused it (I wouldn’t be surprised if cut funding too). In fact I can’t recall ever having full support of my needs or not having the right “connections”. I did have an IEP in school with different specialist teachers throughout that I am thankful for being there, I was in at least 1 Special ED class throughout which did accommodate me but it felt unsupported/sidelined plus a lot of kids making trouble who either did or didn’t have the same results as me. I still felt like I wasn’t getting anywhere I did make honor roll several times, did the advanced history classes, and got a 3.8 GPA at the end. I always knew how disadvantaged my position was due to being largely left out by well off kids who got to do sports or obtained more status but I was sheltered from it till it was shoved in my face when I was let go for a second time in August 2023 for some made up reason on the spot. By that point I felt legitimately discriminated against out in the open. I’ve been fired twice with my recent third and forth job due to being misunderstood and seen as a nuisance in their eyes in my opinion. The third didn’t give me any proper training, the manager always criticized us even when we improved with routine, she’d always passive aggressively threaten us with the cameras, and the people above her would use her to always make us feel worthless while saving $ with understaffing. I admit I was mouthy about their habits the whole time but they kept me because I came in extra days and they liked how friendly I was with customers. One day I walked in to find out they fired me over the weekend without notice all because the manager’s sister was around when I told a customer I didn’t like one donut’s yellow frosting that I did compare to “puke” to be honest (I know very stupid) but fire me over my mouth now and your sister not employed getting personally involved?! The fourth I was only able to get because my mom works in the front office still. There is a popularity hierarchy and they told me the “We’re a family here” trope but everyone was always happy to see me no drama, never had complaints and always kept up with boxing up orders. Till the day before my last we had a big last minute order like 15 crates everyone was rushing full motion, I struggle with the very last to package, the warehouse manager just watches me after she’s done, I cut my thumb with the boxcutter, everyone else comes to help me, and I tell her I won’t do big orders like that way and shift is over. The next day was ordinary about to be over she takes me aside and tells me I’m let go because “I can’t handle big Orders” (I was strong till the END plus you didn’t help at that point) and said I wouldn’t “do big orders” (she used my words against me left out the part where I said I’d handle them differently), 2 excuses that felt so on the fly she had nothing else to use against me never had a gripe with me at this point this but lady also has a bad reputation before I got there. I never made a single mistake either, otherwise they would have mentioned it. It felt strongly in line with companies not caring about their workers so I think continuing to work “At Will” jobs for me will just result in more firings and financial instability. I will admit I do have functioning issues but I can take care/think for myself. I’ve just come to the conclusion that my brain is wired to be within a tribe, like how our species used to be always surrounded by others looking out for you for survival to see the next day. At the core of it I think my needs just involve having a group to take care of one another but nowadays it’s too much to ask for at all, now society runs on everybody being individualistic and competing with everyone else down to the bone. I don’t want to consider myself disabled not that I want to put anyone else down (my Autism is real) they’re valid too to be honest with themselves about it but I’m just driven to escape the mark of ableism, how it just makes you turn on yourself with the inferiority complex while being actively sabotaged by those who think they know better. 



\*On a for real note I am task oriented minded and when I’m stuck at home all day for a whole year not doing anything impactful or feeling every inch of new lessons/stresses, just change in general I regress that is difficult to undo. I very much embody the not doing anything all day state of mind and on my body, if I don’t do a little of something daily it messes me up the next day if I don’t intervene then long term. It affects me socially too where I can’t relate to other people doing things for simple pleasure or survival's sake, even my family. I even grow tired of the limited things I can put my mind to like exercise, writing, gaming, or reading. It makes me not want to expand my comfort zone being stuck in a purgatory of repetition. But this can be an advantage too if I have a place to go to or a muscle memory to act upon for real world results. Some days I realize I wasn’t in charge of this downward state of things, I’m not the ones in charge who hold no concern for the many with no room to grow so I don’t need to completely put this burden on my shoulders. One of the most important factors of my needs is that I NEED to be out in the world. I’m just putting everything out on the table because this feels like my 1st biggest decision in my young adult life that looks like a shot worth taking.\*



**Questions I can come up with right now:**



Does the application process usually range from 2 weeks to a couple of months?



Again which blue collar profession would match me the best since I have dipped my toes into it? 



It’s pretty vague about the full benefits but can any of these trades take you in any boundless direction you desire?  



What support needs do they offer? Would I need to be transparent about it to set up my ideal situation? How is the accommodation? 



Do they teach you extra life skills like in my case my parents weren’t able to pass along? 

I guess I mean things like applying for rent, paying bills/taxes, or managing finances?



Again I saw Denison has a driver’s ed course, would they be able to get me back on the road?  



Since I don’t have a working vehicle do they have solutions for that or not?



If they provide section 8 housing/employment can they set up something like maybe getting a ride from a fellow employee for example? 



For math should I relearn as I wait to be accepted and what curriculum is recommended? 



For Roommates is there a compatibility stage or do I find out the hard way? 



Do they offer getting new glasses prescriptions?



\*In conclusion I want the means to take life seriously again and not have to grow fear of it behind 4 walls any longer. I want to take up opportunities from the services available where you have the option to finally get resources and provide yourself the necessities to take care of yourself through the 21st Century. Thank You!\*

And we were married for about 5 years. So we were together for 15 years total. He’s known my sister since she was 10yo, and she basically grew up with him.
We had a pretty amicable divorce overall. The obvious broken heart and we split for a reason, but we have no ill will against each other. And until now, haven’t really had any problems through our divorce.

Well recently, my sister went down to Texas with some friends, where my husband lives now, and reached out to him about hanging out to catch up. I wasn’t too happy with her, and have voiced my unhappiness towards her for doing so, but that’s a separate thing and not a part of this story.

My husband took her up on her offer and went out to coffee and lunch with her.  I wasn’t just pissed at my sister, but also thought that even though we were broken up, he still owed me the respect of following my boundaries, especially since we were together for so long.
He argued that we were no longer together, and I can’t tell him what to do.
I said it was weird that he was not only talking to my family members, but that he physically went to hang out with them. 
He said that he’s known her for a big part of his life and he watched her grow up, and she’s known him almost as long as she can remember, and sees him as a family member.

Well long story short, I messaged his current girlfriend and told her what happened and that he was in contact with my family.
I thought if it was really innocent and okay, then she should be okay with him still having contact and communication with my family. 
Needless to say, she was not happy, and he accused me of being bitter and said that I was being a crazy ex wife that does what she can to ruin her ex husband’s life.

I told him that obviously boundaries aren’t relevant since he couldn’t respect mine, and that if his current relationship was actually strong, then he would have already told her about it and whatever I said shouldn’t have been a problem. 

To be clear, no kids are involved, so it’s not like our family actually needs any contact with each other for any reason. I’ve never messed with any part of his life or career beyond our divorce, and we had a simple prenup and didn’t get lawyers involved and just followed the pre determined prenup. 

AITAH? He thinks I’m being a vindictive ex wife just trying to start drama. While I think he crossed boundaries he owed me the respect of not crossing given we were together for so long, and if his current relationship was so strong, then it shouldn’t have mattered anyways.",0,1742527460.0,AITAH,28,0.5,False

If you feel lost, alone and want to be part of a community or meet new people, make new friends, etc. Create local events...

Say what!!!

Create a limited local events near you. Repeat them every week and voilà.

By limited, I mean limit the number of people who can join, you don't want to have hundreds attending lol

Use apps like FB, localbrite, meetup or LinkedIn : be precise on what the event is for, example let's meet for a coffee to talk about x, y, z. Put the desired age and sex of people you want to meet (if you need to).

No need to overcomplicate things, just a simple coffee place near you without any reservations etc.

I did that when I was alone and new in China, I created 3 WEEKLY coffee events. it worked like crazy, helped me make very good friends and even found clients that way.

Just saying... Nothing Beats local events, because it is human, social, direct and fast... Humans did that for thousands of years.

Now, I know there's exceptions and loopholes in the restaurant industry regarding breaks. I know if you are in a position where you could be needed at any moment, you don't necessarily get a break. However, from my understanding, there's traditionally enough people at fast food restaurants that people can take breaks... right? There certainly was enough people at this restaurant tonight that this guy could've taken a coffee break at least. And I have the feeling he won't be compensated properly for overtime, either.

All the employees were Indian. The manager of this restaurant is an older white woman that is somewhat known in the area.. About 6-7 years ago, this restaurant hired all sorts of people, old and young, every race (I had friends who worked there in high school). I know a lot of places have resorted to hiring international students for cheap labour. However, I've never actually had any employee admit to me how much they were being overworked, until today. 

Who do I report this to? CAN I report this? Everything I find online is about reporting your own workplace, not another one you don't work at.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes work sends me places so maybe we can meet if I end up near you. I play music badly, write songs that I sing over this bad music. Well, kind of growl since I’m a metalhead and singing is silly. Also I can’t sing.

I’m love a good coffee and a recipe. I love sharing both. I enjoy reading probably as much as I do writing, a bit more sometimes. I enjoy a good drink. Scotch is my main one, I am pretty good at making any mixed drink. I love to bartend when people are over.

Apologies in advance I’m wordy as fuck

I am moving cross country to Seattle alone (YOLO) bc my company offered to fund the move and I’m sick of my city so why not. I’ll be hybrid (1-2 days week I’m thinking) my job at a game studio in Bellevue. So would prefer to be within 30 minutes driving distance if poss. 

I’m about to go on my house hunting trip and trying to nail down some areas. 

* Budget is 3.5k
* REALLY want a back yard - shared or even a large patio or small patch of grass will do 
* Not a fan of massive apartment complexes no matter how nice 
* Looking for a 2bd to accommodate my horde of pets and wfh
* 30f, hoping for a neighborhood with as many child free people my age as possible (nothing against kids but you know what I mean)
* Hoping for an area that’s got cool activities going on, but not things like concerts or nightclubs; I like crafting groups, casual nature activities like foraging and looking for animals / birdwatching, board game meetups, etc. obviously hoping for some coffee shops, parks, or a brewery like everyone else. 

Advice I’ve received from colleagues/friends with Seattle experience:
* Kirkland / Bellevue has a bit of a corporate soulless vibe. 
* Queen Anne is great but parts of it can be a bit more residential / families than what I want 
* Ballard has some good activities but again could be sleepy depending on where I am in it 
* West Seattle’s got the nature but not the level of activity options I’m looking for 
* Capital hill might be too rowdy for me except certain areas in the north

For as long as I remember, I haven't had any attraction to women. The only time I remotely had anything like this is a dumb crush I had in 3rd Grade, which I don't really think counts. I have come to terms with my sexuality and I'm happy with it. 

Back in August, I met a girl (F22) in one of my college classes. She was super sweet and eventually we got closer and just overall vibed together. We had similar interests, senses of humor, etc. 

After a few months of knowing her, in November, I eventually started feeling weird feelings. Just... I liked her a lot. Didn't know how to explain it. Eventually I got drunk one night and unthinkingly called her being like ""idk why but your so pretty and I might have a crush"". She found it sweet/silly and mentioned she had a partner (long-distance). When I was sober again, I apologized profusely and I never really spoke of it again.

Since then, our relationship has gotten much stronger. And my crush somewhat faded. And now we talk all the time. We converse over text nearly every day. We joke with each other. We vent about our silly troubles. Yada yada yada. She's just so cool.

This month though, the feelings came back. She eventually broke up with her partner. And I'm guessing that is what sparked it. Out of respect, I am not initiating anything.

But I dunno. I have never felt this way before about a girl. When I see her, I just wanna make her happy. I want to see her smile and laugh. I want to hug her. I want to be there for her. I want to be around her and give her all the joy in the world. Thinking about her just makes all the ""gayness"" leave my brain. I get all giddy at the idea of going out for coffee with her, seeing a movie, holding hands in the park, etc.

She's a good friend, but that thought doesn't leave my brain. I've never felt this way about a woman before and I don't know if/when I'll ever have these feelings again.

But. She's way out of my league (more beautiful than I deserve). And I'm openly ""gay"". Not to mention she just had a breakup. And that drunk incident.

And most of all... I don't want to ruin a friendship.

My husband has a small company offering translation services and event production. We've worked together for a few years (we’ve been married for 12), until I got pregnant with our second child, now 6 months old. We used to run the company together until I was too pregnant to function, then I switched to being a stay-at-home mom, and he took over. It was really hard on him at first, since my pregnancy ended right before the high-demand season started, and he had to do all the work himself.

The thing is, because of this, he’s changed maybe six diapers in total since our baby was born, rarely does any housework, and I have to nag him to wash his coffee cup or the things he uses after he’s done. I even have to ask him to clean up his shit stains from the toilet or pick up his clothes from the floor (usually I end up doing it anyway because he's always saying how busy he is).
He was never very tidy or proactive with housework before my pregnancy, but at least we used to take turns with the dishes, bathing our oldest, helping with homework—he would fold his own clothes and we'd clean the house together on the weekend. Now, I feel like, because I’m a stay-at-home mom, he thinks it’s my job to do everything.

He works until 9:30 PM every day and barely sees our kids (we have a home office). I feel like, to our baby, he’s more of a fun uncle. He plays with her for a few minutes a day, barely carries her, and—like I said—never tends to her needs. He’s not being a father at all. But I know that if I bring this up, he’ll say I’m being ungrateful, and that not being there for our baby is a sacrifice he hates making, but has to, for the sake of the company.
Am I being ungrateful? Should I not ask him to do anything house-related because he’s working for our family? I hate how little time he spends with us because of work, and I hate seeing families on social media where the father comes home and is actually a partner—helps around the house, watches the kids with his wife. I’m not seeing that.

He only helps with sporadic tasks (like picking things up from the store, going to the pharmacy, or taking out the garbage). I feel like I never stop doing things around the house or with the kids. I never have a break. I still cook for him when he comes out of the office—even when I’m tired—while he gets to rest from work. I feel like I never get to rest. And I’m the one who wakes up early with the kids. He can sleep in if he wants; he’s his own boss. I never have that option, even if I’m sick.

I know he works hard, and that we have a decent lifestyle because of him. That’s why I’m not sure if I’m asking too much or being unfair. I’d really like to hear both men’s and women’s perspectives—I’m genuinely interested. Sorry if I wrote too much.

(Oh, and by the way—we're both introverts and barely talk to anyone or have a social life, or even leave the house much. So I believe him when he says he’s working.)


TL;DR
My husband runs a small company by himself and works until 9:30 PM every day, after which he rests while I make dinner for everyone and put the kids to bed. I’m a stay-at-home mom, but I’d like him to help with the kids and housework after work—so he can be part of our baby’s life as a father, not just a friendly visitor. I’d also like to have a break at least a few minutes a day, but I don’t feel like I can. Am I asking too much? Am I being ungrateful? Should I just do everything so he can focus on growing the company? ",2,1742526581.0,marriageadvice,16,1.0,False

He was always an early riser, so I figured he’d be up before me each morning. To make things easy, I showed him where I kept my coffee and how to use my little espresso machine.

The first morning, I woke up to find him sitting at the kitchen table, absolutely wired. His eyes were wide, his leg bouncing uncontrollably, and he was muttering about how he could “see time.”

Turns out, instead of making a single espresso shot, he had filled an entire mug with straight espresso. Not once. Not twice. But three times. This 75-year-old man, who usually just had a weak drip coffee in the morning, had essentially mainlined enough caffeine to launch a rocket.

He spent the rest of the morning talking a mile a minute about completely random topics, including a very detailed theory about how squirrels were running a shadow government in the neighborhood. Then, just as suddenly, he crashed. I found him an hour later, face down on the couch, snoring louder than I’d ever heard.

When he finally woke up, he just blinked at me and said, “I think I fought God in my dreams.”

To this day, that’s one of my favorite stories about him. I miss him, but I still laugh every time I think about it.

1jg7b3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1jg7b3y/i_work_the_night_shift_at_a_redwood_gas/,I Work the NIGHT SHIFT at a Redwood GAS STATION...There are STRANGE RULES to follow!,"Have you ever walked into a place and immediately felt like you didn’t belong? Not in a social sense, not because people stared or whispered—but because something in the very air told you to turn back? Like the walls held secrets they didn’t want you to hear, and every step you took forward felt like a mistake? That’s exactly how I felt the moment I pushed open the door to Redwood Gas & Mart.

At first glance, it was just another rundown gas station—the kind you’d barely notice while speeding down the highway, the kind with a single faded sign and a couple of pumps that looked older than you. Nothing obviously wrong. But the second I stepped inside, my gut clenched like I’d walked into a place that wasn’t meant for me. A chill slithered down my spine, cold and sharp, even though the summer heat still clung to my skin from outside.

The air inside was thick, unmoving, like a room that had been sealed off for years. It had a weight to it, a stillness that made it feel abandoned, yet I knew it wasn’t. Somewhere near the back, an old refrigerator hummed, its low, constant drone filling the silence. But that silence was wrong. It wasn’t the kind of quiet you find in an empty store—it was the kind that felt intentional, like something was listening.

The place was barely standing. Outside, the neon sign flickered between life and death, buzzing weakly as it cast jittery, uneven shadows across the cracked pavement. The front window was streaked with grime, the edges warped from years of neglect. Inside, fluorescent lights struggled to stay on, their flickering glow making the shadows in the corners shift unnaturally. It smelled like burnt coffee, old motor oil, and something else—something sharp and sour that clung to the back of my throat like a warning.

Every instinct screamed at me to turn around, to walk out before it was too late. I should have listened. I should have gotten back in my car, driven away, and never looked back.

But I didn’t.

I needed this job.

I was broke. Rent was past due, my fridge was empty, and my options were running out fast. When I saw the job listing—cashier, overnight shift, no experience required—it felt like a lifeline. Gus, the owner, was offering more than minimum wage and wasn’t asking any questions. That alone should have set off alarms in my head. But when you’re desperate, you don’t get the luxury of being cautious.

Still, as I stood there in that dimly lit station, something in me whispered that I had just made a mistake.

# The Rules

Gus was already waiting for me behind the counter.

He didn’t say much. Didn’t ask my name or shake my hand. He just looked at me—really looked, like he was trying to decide if I’d last the night. His skin was weathered, stretched tight over sharp cheekbones, deep wrinkles cutting across his face like old scars. His eyes were dark and sunken, the kind that had seen things and learned not to talk about them.

Without a word, he grabbed something from beneath the counter and shoved it into my hands. It was an old, grease-stained notebook, its edges curled and brittle. His fingers twitched slightly as he let go, like he was hesitant to pass it over.

“Read this.” His voice was flat, low. It wasn’t a request. It was an order. “Follow every rule. No exceptions.”

Before I could even ask what he meant, he turned and walked out the door. No small talk, no good luck, not even a backward glance. The door creaked shut behind him, the dull ding of the overhead bell ringing in my ears.

I was alone.

My hands felt clammy as I opened the notebook. The pages were rough, the handwriting inside scrawled and uneven, like someone had written it in a hurry. I scanned the first few lines, and my stomach dropped.

**Rule #1 : At 12:00 AM, turn off all the lights inside the station for exactly one minute. Do not move. Do not breathe loudly. You will hear something moving in the dark. Do not acknowledge it. When you turn the lights back on, check the security monitor. If something is standing outside Pump 4, lock the doors immediately.**

I swallowed hard and flipped to the next page.

**Rule #2 : If a man with no shoes and no shadow comes in between 1:00 AM and 2:00 AM, let him take whatever he wants. Do not speak to him. If he looks at you, look down. If he stops at the door before leaving, close your eyes until you hear the bell chime. If you don’t hear it, you didn’t close them fast enough.**

My pulse pounded in my ears. My fingers felt numb, but I kept reading.

**Rule #3 : At exactly 2:30 AM, the phone will ring. Do not answer it. If it rings more than three times, hide in the supply closet until it stops. If it goes to voicemail, do not listen to the message.**

**Rule #4 : At 3:00 AM, you may hear knocking from inside the cold storage. This is impossible because it is empty. Do not open the door. Do not respond. If the knocking continues past 3:10 AM, you were too slow in ignoring it. You must now leave the building and wait outside until 3:33 AM. Hope that the doors unlock for you when you return.**

I felt sick. My mind screamed at me that this had to be some kind of twisted prank. But deep down, I knew it wasn’t.

I turned the page with shaky fingers.

**Rule #5 : If a woman wearing a hospital gown appears at Pump 2, do not let her inside. She will beg. She will cry. She will say she knows you. She does not. If she makes eye contact, cover your ears and hum until she leaves. If you hear her voice in your head, do not react.**

A lump formed in my throat.

**Rule #6 : Before leaving at 6:00 AM, review the security footage. If there is missing time, stay inside. Do not leave, no matter what you hear outside. Do not let Gus in if he returns before sunrise.**

I read the list once. Then again. And a third time, hoping something—anything—would make it sound less insane. But it didn’t.

I looked around the station—the flickering lights, the grimy counter, the empty aisles. The hum of the refrigerator droned on. Nothing moved. Nothing made a sound. But I wasn’t alone.

I could feel it.

My stomach twisted. My skin prickled.

This wasn’t a joke.

When the clock struck **12:00 AM**, My fingers hovered over the light switch, trembling so badly I nearly missed it. My breath was shallow, uneven, completely useless in calming my nerves. The notebook’s instructions ran through my head over and over—turn off the lights, do not move, do not acknowledge anything.

I swallowed hard. Then, in one swift motion, I flicked the switch.

Darkness swallowed the store.

The change was instant and absolute. The familiar world of dim fluorescent lighting and scuffed tile vanished, replaced by a suffocating black void. It was the kind of dark that pressed in, thick and cloying, making the space feel smaller than it was. My pulse pounded in my ears, loud enough to drown out everything else. For a second, there was nothing. No sound, no movement. Just silence.

Then, I heard A sound.

Faint at first, just a whisper of movement against the floor. Then louder. A slow, deliberate scrape, like nails dragging across linoleum. My breath hitched. My entire body went rigid, every nerve firing at once. The sound wasn’t distant—it was close. **Too** close.

I strained my ears, desperate to track it without moving. The darkness made it impossible to tell how far—or how near—it was. Then, the air shifted, subtle but undeniable. The space around me grew heavier, dense with something unseen. My instincts screamed at me to **run**, to throw myself toward the door and never look back.

But I **couldn’t**. The rules were clear.

And Suddenly came the breathing.

Wet. Ragged. **Inhuman.**

It wasn’t just in the store. It was behind the counter. **Right next to me.**

A wave of nausea rolled through me. My stomach clenched, my limbs locked in place, and I fought the overwhelming urge to bolt. I squeezed my eyes shut, my hand flying over my mouth to smother any sound. My heartbeat thundered against my ribs, a wild, frantic rhythm I couldn’t control.

The breathing grew louder.

It was so close I could almost feel it against my skin—hot, damp, **wrong**. I clenched my fists so hard my nails dug into my palms, a sharp pain grounding me in place. Seconds stretched unbearably long, the darkness warping time itself. I couldn’t tell how much had passed. I needed to count. I needed to track the time.

**Sixty seconds. Just sixty seconds.**

But Then, the tapping began.

**Tap.**

A single, sharp click against the countertop.

**Tap.**

Then another.

Another.

It was deliberate. Slow. **Testing.** Waiting.

I squeezed my eyes shut tighter. My fingers dug into my arm, knuckles white. **It knew I was here.** It knew I was listening. It was waiting for something—for me to react, to flinch, to acknowledge its presence in any way.

I couldn’t.

I focused on counting, my thoughts frantic and disjointed. **How many seconds had passed? Thirty? Forty?** My entire body ached from staying so still, but I **had to.**

Then, suddenly—

**Silence.**

The air in the room lightened, just slightly. The thick, oppressive weight pressing against me **lifted.**

It was 12:01 AM.

I didn’t hesitate. My hand shot toward the switch, fumbling as I flipped it back on.

The store blinked back to life, the harsh yellow glow of the flickering fluorescent lights a jarring contrast to the suffocating darkness. The hum of the old refrigerator returned, grounding me in reality. I gasped, my chest rising and falling in sharp, uneven breaths. My hands trembled as I scanned the store.

Nothing.

The aisles were untouched. The counter was empty. **Nothing was there.**

But I knew better.

However, It was almost impossible for me to believe—everything had unraveled in just one minute. **Sixty seconds?** That was all it took?

My breath trembled as I exhaled, my mind struggling to catch up with reality.

Forcing my limbs to move, I turned toward the security monitor. The grainy black-and-white footage flickered across the screen, showing empty pumps, still cars, silent streets.

My breath caught in my throat.

At **Pump 4**, A **figure** stood just beyond the glow of the overhead lights.

It was hunched and still, its body twisted unnaturally, its features obscured by darkness. But it was there. Watching. **Or at least, I thought it was watching.** I couldn’t see a face. Just a shape—a **wrong** shape—that didn’t belong.

My chest tightened, my instincts roaring in panic. **Lock the doors. Now.**

I spun toward the entrance, my hands shaking as I fumbled with the bolt. The metal slid into place with a reassuring **click**.

And then, it moved.

A **lurching, unnatural motion**, like it had been waiting for me to react.

**BANG!**

I nearly jumped out of my skin. Something **slammed** against the glass door—hard. The entire frame rattled, the impact reverberating through the floor. I stumbled backward, heart hammering in my chest so violently I thought it might burst. My breath came in sharp gasps as I **stared** at the door, fully expecting it to shatter, expecting—**that thing**—to **force its way inside.**

But then… **nothing.**

The store fell silent once more.

The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, flickering slightly. The refrigerator hummed in the background, the only sound breaking the eerie stillness.

I hesitated, every fiber of my being screaming at me **not** to look.

But I had to.

Slowly, cautiously, I lifted my eyes toward the glass.

The figure was gone.

“Oh my God…” I whispered, barely recognizing my own voice. It was hoarse, shaky, filled with the kind of fear that sinks into your bones and doesn’t let go. “How am I supposed to survive the whole night if I have to go through all these rules?”

I didn’t expect an answer, and none came. The gas station remained eerily silent, its dim fluorescent lights buzzing overhead, their flickering glow casting uneasy shadows along the floor. The only other sounds were the distant hum of the old refrigerator and the occasional creak of the floorboards beneath my shifting weight. I swallowed hard, trying to ignore how loud my own breathing sounded in the empty store.

I glanced at the clock. **1:37 AM.**

The bell above the door chimed.

A chill raced down my spine. My breath hitched. **No. Not now. Not yet.**

I turned toward the entrance, my body frozen in place.

A man stepped inside.

At first, he looked… normal. Or at least, **human.** But the longer I looked, the more I noticed what was **wrong** with him. His clothes were tattered, hanging off his thin frame like they’d been worn for months without a single wash. The fabric was frayed at the edges, stained with something dark—**too dark, too much.** His feet were bare, coated in layers of dirt so thick it looked like they’d fused with his skin. The smell of old earth and something faintly metallic clung to him, making the stale air in the station feel even heavier.

But none of that was what made my stomach lurch.

It was the **floor beneath him.**

There was **no shadow.**

My entire body went cold.

**The rule.** It echoed in my head, flashing like a warning siren. **If a man with no shoes and no shadow enters, let him take whatever he wants. Do not speak to him. Do not look at him.**

**Don’t look at him.**

I yanked my gaze away so fast it made me dizzy, locking my eyes on the counter instead. My hands curled into fists, my nails biting deep into my palms. My chest felt tight, like I had to **force** myself to breathe without making a sound.

The man moved past the counter.

His footsteps made no noise.

I strained my ears, listening as he rustled through the shelves. 

The soft crinkle of a plastic bottle being lifted, the faint crunch of a chip bag being grabbed. The small, mundane sounds of a normal customer. But there was **nothing normal** about this.

He didn’t speak. Neither did I.

I counted my breaths. **One. Two. Three.**

Just take what you want and leave. Just **go.**

I heard him turn, his steps still **too smooth, too soundless.** The air in the store should have felt lighter now that he was walking away, but it didn’t. **It felt heavier.**

And then I felt it.

His gaze.

Heavy. Unrelenting.

It latched onto me, curling around my body like something tangible, something I could **feel.** My skin prickled, every instinct in my body screaming at me to **run, to hide, to do something.**

But I knew the rule.

**If he looks at you, look down.**

I forced my gaze downward, staring at the counter with all the focus I could muster. My breathing was shallow, my chest aching from the effort of keeping still.

**Go. Please, just go.**

But he wasn’t moving.

The air pressed in on me, thick and suffocating. It was like being underwater, like something unseen was wrapping around my lungs, squeezing tighter and tighter. I wanted to gasp, to choke, but I couldn’t.

**The rule. Follow the rule.**

Then, another memory of the notebook flashed in my mind, screaming at me now with frantic urgency:

**If he stops at the door before leaving, close your eyes until you hear the bell chime.**

**Oh God.**

My hands clenched into fists so tight my knuckles ached. My entire body trembled as I shut my eyes as fast as I could. So tightly that I saw bursts of color behind my lids.

Now As soon as I closed my eyes, **silence.**

The kind of silence that **isn’t empty.** The kind that hums, that crawls, that waits.

I didn’t move.

The air grew colder, like all the warmth had been sucked out of the room in an instant. The sound of my heartbeat filled my ears, a panicked, **too-loud** rhythm against the heavy quiet.

**The bell. Just wait for the bell.**

Seconds stretched into an eternity.

And then—

**Nothing.**

The bell **didn’t** chime.

My stomach dropped.

Something was wrong.

**Oh God, why isn’t he leaving?**

My legs locked up. Every muscle in my body was frozen in place, paralyzed with sheer terror. I wanted to scream, to run, to throw myself under the counter and pray for morning, but I couldn’t.

I **had** to follow the rule.

I couldn’t open my eyes. Not yet.

Another pause.

A shift in the air.

Then—

**Chime.**

The door creaked open.

A gust of night air slipped into the store, colder than before. **Colder than it should have been.**

I waited.

I counted.

Then, finally, I dared to open my eyes.

He was gone.

The store looked exactly the same—nothing out of place, nothing touched except for the items he had taken.

But the moment wasn’t over.

I gasped, sucking in a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding. My hands were shaking, my fingers stiff and aching from how tightly I’d curled them. My body felt like it had been wrung dry, every muscle exhausted from tension.

But I couldn’t **stop.**

I barely had time to recover before the next horror arrived.

At exactly 2:30 AM, the phone rang.

The phone rang out, loud and unrelenting, A sharp, shrill sound cutting through the thick silence that had settled over the gas station, slicing the air like a blade. The fluorescent lights above buzzed softly, their flickering glow casting uneasy shadows on the floor. But the only sound that mattered was the ringing—piercing, demanding.

The rule was clear. **Do not answer it.**

I didn’t hesitate.

I **let it ring.**

**Once.**

My heartbeat pounded against my ribs, each thud harder than the last. I gritted my teeth, staring at the phone as if willing it to stop.

**Twice.**

A cold sweat broke across my skin. My breathing turned shallow, my chest rising and falling in tight, uneven motions.

**Three times.**

I clenched my fists. **That should be it.**

But then—

**The fourth ring.**

A chill crawled up my spine. The ringing didn’t stop. It kept going. **Unchanging. Unwavering.**

And then, something shifted.

The tone warped—stretched—becoming something unnatural. It was still a ring, but now it **wasn’t.** The sound bent at odd pitches, twisting into something almost… alive. My stomach clenched. Every hair on my body stood on end.

**Run.**

The word screamed through my mind before I even made the decision. My legs moved on their own, propelling me toward the supply closet. My hands fumbled with the door handle, slick with sweat, as the ringing distorted even further.

Then, the change happened.

The ringing was no longer a ringing.

It was a **voice.**

**My voice.**

My body locked up, ice-cold panic spreading through my veins. The sound coming from the phone was **me**—a hollow, warped echo, repeating back **everything I had said that night.**

“Oh my God… how will I be able to survive the whole night?”

**The exact words I had whispered to myself earlier.**

I choked on my own breath, yanking the closet door shut behind me. My back pressed against the cold metal shelves, my hands clamped over my ears. My pulse roared in my head, but it couldn’t drown out the sound.

The voice kept speaking. Kept mimicking.

But it wasn’t just an echo anymore.

It **changed.**

A slow, wet laugh slipped through the speaker—**gurgling, choked,** like someone laughing through a throat filled with water.

That wasn’t me.

That was **something else.**

I bit my lip so hard I tasted blood. My entire body refused to move, frozen in place by a fear so deep it felt primal.

The voice outside the closet shifted, whispering now, softer but no less horrifying.

Then—

**Silence.**

The air around me was still. **Too still.**

The ringing was gone. The voice had stopped.

I waited.

**Five minutes.**

I counted the seconds, my body trembling with the effort of staying quiet. My ears strained for any sound—any clue that whatever had been on the other end of the line was **still there.**

Nothing.

Slowly, cautiously, I reached for the closet door. My fingers trembled as I pushed it open just an inch, peering through the gap.

The store was empty.

Everything looked exactly as it had before. The shelves were stocked. The counter was clear. The flickering fluorescent lights buzzed softly, their glow casting the same uneven light across the floor.

But then, my gaze landed on the phone.

The receiver was **off the hook.**

The plastic cord dangled off the edge of the counter, swaying slightly—**like someone had just set it down.**

My stomach twisted. My breath hitched.

I was sure of it now.

Whatever was waiting for me in this gas station…

Was far worse than I had ever imagined.

For a few fleeting minutes, my body loosened, the tension melting away as if nothing had ever been wrong.

But Then, At exactly **3:00 AM**, the knocking started.

It wasn’t frantic. It wasn’t hesitant.

It was rhythmic. **Steady.**

**Knock. Knock. Knock.**

Each tap was precise, deliberate, like it was following a pattern only it knew. The sound carried through the empty gas station, filling every corner with its unnatural, hollow weight. I held my breath, my muscles locking up as I stared toward the cold storage door—the source of the sound.

**What was the rule?**

Panic clawed at my mind, twisting my thoughts into a tangled mess. There were so many rules, so many warnings scribbled in that old notebook, but my fear blurred them all together.

The knocking didn’t stop.

**Knock. Knock. Knock.**

I forced myself to think. 

**Rule #4 : At 3:00 AM, you may hear knocking from inside the cold storage. This is impossible because it is empty. Don’t answer it. Don’t respond. Don’t open the door.** 

But was there more? Something else I was supposed to do? The rule had been clear—if the knocking continued past 3:10 AM, I had to leave the building until 3:33 AM.

I couldn’t risk being **too slow.**

Instinct took over.

I grabbed the keys and bolted for the door, throwing myself into the freezing air.

The second my foot crossed the threshold—

**Silence.**

Not just from the knocking. Not just from inside the gas station.

Everything stopped.

The refrigerators no longer hummed. The flickering lights inside the store froze in place, locked in an unnatural stillness. Even the distant wind—something I hadn’t realized had been howling all night—was gone.

The entire world held its breath.

I was **alone.**

Or at least… I **thought** I was.

Then—I heard it.

**Breathing.**

Shallow. **Close.**

**Right behind me.**

Ice shot down my spine, locking my joints in place. I didn’t move. I didn’t even blink.

**Don’t turn around.**

The thought screamed in my mind, loud and insistent.

I clenched my fists, my nails digging into my palms as my breath came in short, shaky bursts. The air behind me felt **thick**, pressing against my back like something unseen was leaning in, watching. Waiting.

The seconds stretched into minutes.

**At 3:33 AM,** My fingers were numb as I reached for the door handle. It was **Unlocked.**

I pushed it open and stepped inside. The moment I crossed back over the threshold, the world **restarted**.

The store lights flickered again. The refrigerator buzzed back to life. The faint hum of electricity filled the silence.

The knocking had stopped.

But I didn’t feel safe.

I felt **watched.**

It was 3:45 AM.

I had barely caught my breath, my body still cold from the encounter outside, when the security monitor flickered.

At Pump 2. A woman stood there.

**Barefoot.** **In a hospital gown.**

Her hair clung to her face in damp, tangled strands. The thin fabric of her gown clung to her small frame, her arms wrapped tightly around herself as her shoulders shook with violent, shuddering sobs.

Something was **wrong.**

Not just with her presence. Not just with the fact that she had seemingly appeared out of nowhere.

It was **her posture.**

It was too stiff, too controlled, like she wasn’t crying at all—like she was **pretending** to.

I sucked in a slow breath. She hadn’t seen me yet. I could still turn away. I could still avoid this.

I **should have.**

But I didn’t.

My eyes locked onto hers.

And in an instant, **her head jerked.**

A sharp, unnatural motion, like a puppet whose strings had been cut.

**Then—her eyes met mine.**

My stomach **dropped.**

Every muscle in my body tensed, panic flooding my system as I yanked my hands to my ears—**just in time.**

**Her voice flooded into my head.**

*""Please… you know me. Please, let me in.""*

The words weren’t spoken.

They weren’t coming from the outside.

They were **inside me.**

Echoing, curling around my thoughts like smoke, pressing into every crevice of my mind. The tone was soft, pleading, filled with desperation. But it was **wrong**. Too smooth, too hollow—like someone reading from a script they didn’t understand.

I clenched my jaw, shaking my head violently.

**No. No. No.**

I hummed under my breath, trying to drown it out.

But then—

The voice **changed.**

It became **familiar.**

A memory surfaced—my mother’s voice, calling my name when I was a child. The warmth of home, the feeling of **being safe.**

But that was **impossible.**

My mother wasn’t **alive.**

I squeezed my eyes shut, rocking slightly, trying to force the sound away.

Then—**another voice.**

A friend I hadn’t seen in years. Someone I had lost touch with.

Then—**my own voice.**

*""Please… let me in.""*

I choked on a breath, my body shaking with fear. It was **mimicking.** It was shifting, **changing,** trying to find something that would make me give in.

**No.**

I hummed louder, pressing my hands against my ears until I could barely hear my own breath.

The security monitor flickered.

And then—**she was gone.**

I gasped, my hands falling to my sides, my entire body trembling. My fingers twitched violently, my muscles still locked in the aftermath of adrenaline.

**It was over.**

But then—

Something caught my eye.

**The door handle.**

It had turned.

My chest **seized.**

She had been inside.

By **5:55 AM**, I was barely holding on.

My body felt like it had been dragged through hell and back—every muscle sore, every nerve frayed. My hands wouldn’t stop trembling, my skin clammy with sweat that had long since gone cold. The weight of exhaustion pressed down on me, but I couldn’t give in.

Because there was **one last rule.**

I forced my aching fingers to move, pulling up the security feed on the monitor. The grainy footage flickered as I rewound to the beginning of my shift. My breath came in shallow, uneven gasps as I clicked through the timeline, scanning each frame with desperate eyes.

Then—**my stomach twisted.**

The footage between **2:59 and 4:00 AM** was **gone.**

**Static.**

**Blackness.**

**Nothing.**

I stared at the screen, willing it to change, to rewind further, to **show me something.** But it didn’t. The feed had been wiped clean. It was like those sixty minutes had never existed at all.

My hands turned ice-cold. My pulse hammered against my ribs.

**The rule was clear.**

**If there is missing time, stay inside.**

My mind swarmed with the events of those 60 minutes. 

I had stepped outside at 3:10 AM. I had stood in the freezing darkness, listening to that **breathing.**

**Oh God.**

I squeezed my eyes shut, my hands gripping the edge of the counter so hard my knuckles went white. Maybe—maybe I was overthinking it. Maybe the footage had glitched. Maybe it was nothing.

**But I knew better.**

So, I forced myself to wait.

**6:00 AM.**

The minutes crawled by, each second stretching unbearably long. The store remained **still**, the early morning light slowly creeping toward the horizon.

**6:30 AM.**

A knock at the door.

**Not the bell. A knock.**

A slow, deliberate rap against the glass.

My entire body locked up. I turned my head slowly, a creeping dread settling deep into my bones.

**Gus.**

Or at least—**it looked like Gus.**

He stood just outside the door, wearing the same grease-stained work shirt, the same cap pulled low over his forehead. But something was **wrong.**

**So. Very. Wrong.**

His **mouth was too wide.**

His lips curled into a grin that **stretched too far**, the corners of his mouth pulling past the limits of human anatomy. His teeth gleamed in the dim light, **too white, too perfect, too many.**

His fingers twitched at his sides, but even that was **off**—his hands bent at strange angles, his joints moving in ways they **shouldn’t.**

Then—**his head tilted.**

The movement was smooth, effortless—**unnatural.** His neck bent in a way that no human neck should, like a puppet with its strings tangled.

And then—**he smiled.**

**Not at me.**

**Through me.**

A deep, gnawing terror settled into my gut. Every instinct in my body screamed at me to **run**, to **hide**, to **do something.**

But I knew the rule.

**This is not Gus.**

**Do not open the door.**

So I didn’t.

I stood there, frozen, barely breathing. My fingers twitched against my sides, every muscle in my body coiled tight. I didn’t move. I didn’t blink.

I just **watched.**

And **it** watched back.

Waiting.

The seconds dragged on, suffocating in their stillness. The figure outside didn’t move, didn’t waver. It just stood there, grinning, tilting its head slightly—like it was listening for something.

Then—

The first sliver of **sunrise.**

A car engine rumbled in the distance.

I tore my gaze away from the door as **the real Gus** pulled into the lot. His truck rattled to a stop, the tires crunching softly against the pavement.

I turned back to the door—

**The thing was gone.**

Gus stepped out of his truck, adjusting his cap like this was just another morning.

He didn’t speak.

He didn’t ask any questions.

He just **nodded.**

Like he **knew.**

Like he had been through this before.

I wanted to ask. I wanted to demand answers, to understand what the hell had just happened.

But I didn’t.

Because I already knew.

Whatever had been out there last night…

**Was still out there.**

Waiting.

For the **next** night shift.",4,1742526511.0,Ruleshorror,2,1.0,False

Its like that break up took over me. I did all the begging, I even greeted him on his birthday and got no response HAHAHAHAHA. And the funny part? Yung last date namin last year na samgyup and coffee ay utang pala. LMAO. Siningil pa ako ng 1K huhu. Binayaran ko na kasi baka di pa makatulog. He broke up with me due to the reason na we are holding back each other daw, and I was like saan? He told me rin na I was too much too handle, thay everything with me is too much, where fact all I wanted was reassurance din naman. Don’t get me wrong, may mali din ako ofc. Naging silent din ako everytime may away kami kasi feeling niya I was attacking him, kahit all i am doing is just explaining why I am feeling that way. Umabot sa point na batuhan na ng hurtful words.. pinaka malalang away namin nung sunabihan niya na ako na wala naman na ibang tatanggap sakin as a single mom kundi siya lang. Sobrang sakit non HAHAHAHAHA pero inisip ko na baka galit lang talaga siya at na carried away ng emotion niya..

So last night na bored ako i downloaded bumble, ewan ko ba kung bakit pero siguro dahil bored ako 🥲 but after few hours I DELETED the app rin cuz it just gave me the ick. Bumble rin kasi kami nagkakilala ni ex HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA. So fast forward kanina, pag bukas na pag bukas kong tiktok repost niya agad bumunga, at ang context? “When your ex is hoeing and down graded after your break up”.. and I was like??? Hellooooo??? Damn, iniisip ko tuloy baka may tropa siya na nakita ako sa bumble in that short span of time that I downloaded it. Nagsisi ba ako? NO, kasi after break up his following got high, see his profile in every girls ig reels, and puro babae lang nila-like. Bro made me feel insecure. Feeling ko lowkey ganti ko na rin yon HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

See u around campus! Multuhin ka sana ng presensya ko. Mutual break up mo mukha mo! Ikaw lang naman may gusto. I have a lot of reasons to fight for our relationship, and u easily just drifted away HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA",5,1742526497.0,OffMyChestPH,8,1.0,False

He introduced us and it was like we were best friends forever. 

She doesn’t know anything about anything - as she works in our industry and I’ve tried to keep both our heads up. I try not to tell anyone who knows us both mutually as friends. It’s humiliating. 

We were chatting, and she was talking about how bad her family life was, and how bad her husband’s was growing up. She said, “We both are just so grateful to have found someone who cares about us that we decided we’d never say anything to hurt the other. We don’t fight, we don’t raise our voices. We have enough pain from others. We are each other’s safe space.” 

I broke into tears - which is common for me now. I covered and said it was just so touching (which it was)… I never would tell her that it was like a knife. 

All my friends have husbands who love them. I look at each one of them and think, “What makes you so much more worthy? I love as much as you. I deserve the same love in return.” It makes me sad and honestly a little angry that they get to sleep peacefully and securely every night and I never will again. I’ll always know they’re more loved, more cherished, more valued. 

They get to go through life unscathed and protected and secure. I’m happy for them. They each deserve that - they’re wonderful women. But so am I.  

My family is the opposite of my friends. They think the world of me. They would never hurt me, and have always treated me well. I’m lucky that way.

It’s so sad to me that the one person who is supposed to have my back - who is supposed to protect me and love me - is the person in the world who has damaged me so much that a year and a half later I’m still reeling to the point that I’m crying in a stupid bakery. That I have to look at everyone else’s marriage and feel inferior. Like I have settled for less.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jg757t,https://www.reddit.com/r/TimHortons/comments/1jg757t/lets_go_gambling/,Let's Go Gambling!,"I rarely go to Tim's anymore. But that wasn't the case for over a decade. Throught all my schooling Tim's always had my back. Almost every day, XL steeped tea triple triple. (I've never been a fan of coffee, just not for me) Then something changed.

Once in a while, there'd be no sugar, it sucks. But it happens. Then no cream. Still crummy, but I'm not going to go back to complain. But then it started being just coffee, sometimes black. Every now and then, okay, I'm sure they're just busy. Sucks, but now my friend gets a free coffee.

But by the end of 2022, it was no word of a lie, a 50/50 shot. I'd enunciate the best I could, speak loudly and clearly, but it didn't matter. Didn't matter what was written on the cup either. 
I started trying it right then and there, in the drive thru. I felt like an asshole. But when 3/5 of my days start with something I can't drink and didn't order? It started to really bug me. 

Finally I put my foot down. I said I'm done, and I've never looked back since. Literally never had a wrong order in the 3 years since going somewhere else.

I don’t usually post on Reddit, but I needed to get this off my chest. There’s no drama or big twist—just something I don’t say out loud enough: I’m genuinely, deeply happy. And if you’d told 20-year-old me that this is how my life would look at 36, I wouldn’t have believed you.

I met my wife before we moved to Canada. We got married back home, before we packed up our lives and started fresh in a new country. Just the two of us, figuring it out as we went. That was seven years ago. No family here, no safety net—just a lot of hope and a belief that we could build something better together.

And somehow… we did.

Now, at 36, I live in Canada with my wife and our 3-year-old kid. We own our home. We own our car. I’ve got a steady job with coworkers I actually like (which still feels like a rare gift). We’re not rich, but we have savings. We’re not flashy, but we’re stable. Safe. And honestly, that stability feels like a luxury some days.

Our kid is pure joy and chaos rolled into one—loud, silly, stubborn, hilarious. Some mornings I just stand in the kitchen with a coffee in hand, sunlight streaming through the window, and I can hear my kid laughing in the other room. And I just... pause. Let it sink in. This is the life I never thought I’d have.

I’ve got a few close friends—not many, but the kind who really show up when it counts. I don’t take that for granted.

Fifteen years ago, I was just trying to keep my head above water. I didn’t have a clear vision of what my future would be. I didn’t even think I deserved a life this good. And yet here I am, living it.

It’s not perfect. There are still hard days, parenting stress, the occasional sleepless night. But underneath all of that? Peace. Gratitude. Love.

Fuck, I’m happy. And I just wanted to say that somewhere.

Activities to Enjoy at European Beaches in Winter Months
--------------------------------------------------------

Winter may not be the first season that comes to mind for beach vacations in Europe, but there's a unique charm that coastal areas offer during this time. While summer draws crowds eager to sunbathe and swim, winter beaches unveil a different kind of beauty and a variety of activities to enjoy. Here’s how you can make the most of your beach getaway during the winter months.

### 1. Strolling Along the Beach

The crisp winter air makes beach walks refreshing and invigorating. Many European beaches, especially in places like the Algarve in Portugal or the Costa del Sol in Spain, feature stunning scenery that’s worth exploring. You can take long strolls, listen to the waves crashing against the shore, and breathe in the fresh sea air. These peaceful walks can clear your mind and offer a perfect time for reflection.

### 2. Beachcombing and Shell Collecting

Winter is an excellent time for beachcombing. Lower tourist traffic means that you can find a treasure trove of seashells and unique rock formations washed ashore. Beaches such as those in Sicily or the island of Crete often have beautiful shells lying about. Equip yourself with a bag and discover these hidden gems, perfect for souvenirs or even crafts.

### 3. Photography Adventures

For photography lovers, winter light provides a magical backdrop for stunning coastal shots. The unique colors of the sea, skies, and landscapes change with the winter sun, presenting incredible photographic opportunities. Beaches like Positano on the Amalfi Coast or the rugged coastlines of Norway offer dramatic vistas that are perfect for capturing scenic beauty. A camera or even your smartphone can help you preserve these memories forever.

### 4. Water Sports for the Brave

While summer typically steals the spotlight for water sports, winter can have its adrenaline-packed moments too. Some beaches, such as those in Tarifa, Spain, are famous for windsurfing and kitesurfing. With fewer crowds, the waves may be ideal for thrill-seekers looking to test their skills. Just make sure to check the weather conditions and wear appropriate gear to stay warm!

### 5. Visiting Beachfront Cafés and Bars

Many coastal towns embrace the winter atmosphere with laid-back bars and charming cafés that remain open year-round. Enjoy a cup of warm tea or coffee, or treat yourself to local wines while gazing at the foamy waves. Places like San Sebastián in Spain and Nice in France have numerous culinary delights waiting to be savored, making your beach visit all the more enjoyable.

### 6. Exploring Local Wildlife

Winter is an excellent time to observe birds and marine life that might not be as visible during the warmer months. Head to the beaches in the South of France or the marshlands of the Camargue to see migratory birds. If you’re lucky, you may even spot dolphins off the coast during a boat trip. There’s always something intriguing happening in nature!

### 7. Cozy Bonfire Evenings

While the sea may be too chilly for a swim, a bonfire on the beach is a wonderfully cozy way to spend an evening. Many beaches allow small bonfires, where you can gather with friends or family, roast marshmallows, and share stories under star-lit skies. The glowing fire against the night’s backdrop offers warmth and a comforting atmosphere. Always check local regulations regarding fires on the beach!

### 8. Off-Peak Relaxation

Winter beaches provide a sense of solitude that is often missing during peak season. With fewer tourists around, you can find relaxation and peace. Whether you choose to read a book, meditate, or simply lie on the sand wrapped in a warm blanket, the tranquil ambiance is deeply rejuvenating.

With so many activities to embrace, European beaches in winter can be more than just a destination; they can be an experience filled with adventure, relaxation, and unique moments. So, why not pack your bags and consider visiting a beach this winter? The magic of the coastline awaits you, complete with cold breezes and warm memories.

### Conclusion

When winter sets in, many people dream of warm sandy beaches where they can escape the chill. Europe offers several stunning destinations that provide that perfect winter sun experience. From the Canary Islands to the Algarve and the coastal gems of Cyprus, each location has unique charm and inviting climates that are perfect for your winter getaway. Whether you crave the vibrant nightlife in Tenerife or the serene beauty of Malta's shores, there’s a winter beach experience waiting for you.

The Science Behind Using Pudding Mix in Ice Cream Making Techniques
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Making ice cream at home can be a delightful and rewarding experience. However, getting that perfect creamy texture sometimes feels like a challenge. One popular method to enhance the richness and creaminess of homemade ice cream is using pudding mix. This technique is becoming a favorite among ice cream enthusiasts, and it’s worth exploring how it works.

​ Shop Here --&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com ​  
  
Pudding mix is primarily made of starch, sweeteners, and flavorings. When you add pudding mix to your ice cream mixture, it plays a significant role in achieving that luxurious texture. The starch in the pudding mix serves as a thickening agent, which helps to create a smoother consistency in the final product. This is especially beneficial when making ice cream at home, where traditional stabilizers and emulsifiers may not be readily available.

Here are some reasons why using pudding mix can elevate your ice cream making:

- **Creaminess:** The starch in pudding mix binds with the liquid ingredients, helping to trap air and creating a lighter, fluffier texture.
- **Stability:** Pudding mix can help prevent ice crystals from forming as the ice cream freezes, which is often a problem with homemade versions. This is crucial for maintaining a creamy mouthfeel.
- **Flavor:** They come in various flavors, allowing you to infuse your ice cream with unique tastes easily.
- **Sweetness:** Most pudding mixes contain sweeteners that can enhance the overall flavor of your ice cream without needing additional sugar.

To create your own vanilla ice cream using pudding mix, start with a basic recipe that includes heavy cream, milk, and sugar. You can make this vanilla ice cream even richer by incorporating the pudding mix. Here’s a fantastic Ninja Creami Vanilla Ice Cream recipe that utilizes vanilla pudding mix as a delicious hack.

​ Shop Here --&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com ​  
  
**Ingredients:**

- 2 cups heavy cream
- 1 cup whole milk
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 box (3.4 ounces) vanilla pudding mix
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Follow these simple steps to create your ice cream:

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, whole milk, granulated sugar, and vanilla pudding mix until the mixture is smooth and well combined.
2. Add the vanilla extract and mix it in thoroughly.
3. Pour the mixture into the Ninja Creami ice cream maker and process according to the manufacturer's instructions.
4. If you prefer a firmer ice cream, place the mixture in the freezer for a few hours after processing.

This ice cream will have a delightful creaminess and flavor that’s hard to beat! The pudding mix hack not only ensures a luscious texture but also simplifies the ice cream-making process.

While incorporating pudding mix is a clever trick, it’s essential to understand the science behind it. The key lies in how the starch molecules absorb moisture and expand when heated. When mixed with your ice cream ingredients, they help create a consistent emulsion that keeps air in the mix as it freezes, leading to a rich and creamy texture. The pudding mix stabilizes the ice cream and reduces the chances of forming undesirable ice crystals, making every scoop smooth and enjoyable.

Furthermore, the versatility of using pudding mix enables you to customize your ice cream flavors effortlessly. Consider experimenting with chocolate, banana, or even coconut pudding for unique twists on your vanilla ice cream. Each variation brings distinctive flavors while maintaining that desirable creaminess.

It’s an exciting twist on traditional recipes, allowing you to create delicious frozen treats with minimal effort. So, grab your ingredients and get ready to enjoy a homemade ice cream experience that rivals store-bought versions—all thanks to the wonders of pudding mix!

### Conclusion

Experimenting with the Ninja Creami Vanilla Ice Cream Recipe using pudding mix opens up a world of delightful flavors and textures.

With a confused tail-swish, I pushed myself to my feet, brushing the dirt off my damp knees and heading towards our main site. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw him breathe a small sigh of relief and stand up a little straighter as I walked past him, and it made my ears pin back in frustration.

As I entered the main site, a few gave me discreet side-eyes as I walked past, silencing their conversations and watching me go as they tracked me with their ears. What was going on? This was worse than usual…

I shook my head. *Don’t let them get to you, Lerai… let’s just see what Naartis wants, and then you can get back to your work claw.*

Soon, I was standing in front of the door to Naartis’s office. My fist rose, and I hesitated only slightly before knocking. “Sir? It’s Lerai. You wanted to see me.”

“Yes, yes, come in,” came the Kolshian’s voice.

I put a paw on the door handle, before noticing my tail had gone stiff. I was too tense. Taking a deep breath, I tried to force myself to be calm. Whatever he wanted, it was probably nothing…

My paw turned, and the door opened enough for me to peek my face through. Naartis was sitting at his desk in the center of his neat, prim, and proper office, watching me with bulbous eyes. His tentacles were placed under his chin, slightly obscuring his mouth.

“Welcome, Lerai,” he greeted neutrally. A tentacle waved towards the chairs on the other side of his desk. “Please, sit.”

I flicked an ear in approval and slowly stepped into the room, closing the door behind me. All of my earlier tension had returned, and my tail was as stiff as a tree trunk. As I approached, I tried to calm myself again by looking through the window behind him, which had a perfect view of his *personal* garden. A small plot of land right next to the main site where he was completely free to create as he pleased, without needing to take the sensibilities of other people and species into account. One of the luxuries of being a topsoil School of the Flora grad, I suppose.

That said, it wasn’t pretty. It was filled with beautiful and colorful plants and flowers of all kinds from all over the galaxy, but either I didn’t understand Kolshian design philosophy, I couldn’t see the same colors as a Kolshian, or Naartis just didn’t have much sense of aesthetic. All the colors clashed against one another in strange arrangements to turn the garden into an eye-searing mess. Needless to say, it didn’t soothe me at all.

I took a chair and sat, my paws gripping the hard wooden armrests. Naartis’ gaze never wavered.

“...I’d like to talk to you about your attendance recently,” he said, a bit of a hard edge in his voice.

*…My attendance?* My ears couldn’t help but waggle in confusion reflexively. I hadn’t had any issues that I was aware of—at least, nothing that didn’t have a clear explanation.

“What about it?” I asked.

“Well…” Naartis leaned back in his chair, winding his tentacles across his chest with a dismissive expression. “Frankly, Lerai, there have been too many issues as of late.”

*…What?* “Wh-What are you talking about…?” I asked disbelievingly.

Wordlessly, he took out his pad. He tapped away at it for a scratch before placing it on the table. The built-in holodisplay began projecting a chart in the air between us. It was a graph of the employee attendance records. We had thirty-two total groundskeepers maintaining the park, and the paws that they had showed up to work was displayed as a bar. Many of them were green, or at least yellow. Mine was red, and the smallest bar of all.

“Over the last solar pass, you have had the lowest attendance of any employee here at the Starlight Grove City Park,” he said sternly. 

I stared at the chart. “Wh… Naartis, I’ve missed two paws! And one of them was out sick!” I bleated. *That was the paw after I fought Rika the second time. I was too sore to move…*

Leaning forward to get a closer look, I studied the chart carefully. “I… who made this? The lowest point on this chart is seventeen paws worked out of twenty in a pass! This whole thing is intentionally misleading!”

“Regardless of the chart’s appearance, it does not change the fact that your attendance has been poor in comparison to the others,” Naartis replied with a dismissive flick of a tentacle.

“Naartis, I’m allowed to take sick paws! And you know I don’t abuse them!” I argued, my tail waving wildly. What the brahk was his problem? He was a jerk, but he wasn’t *stupid,* he had to know he was being ridiculous. “And you know why I missed the other paw! That was when I was arreste—”

My voice withered, as the seed finally sprouted in my head. *…Wait… is that what this is about?*

“...You may recall that you recently had a no-call-no-show, Lerai,” Naartis’s voice filled the space.

I didn’t respond for a moment. I was still stunned at the… *brazenness* of it all. I’d heard about this sort of thing happening—someone getting hauled in by the exterminators for a PD screening or some minor crime and being held for a paw or two, coming back clean, and then getting punished at their job anyway for missing work. And despite the obvious problem and lack of protection for the workers, many just waved the incidents off as a personal failure. “*Well, if they didn’t want to be punished, they shouldn’t have acted like a predator,”* they’d say.

Most of the time, the business just didn’t want to deal with having someone *potentially dangerous* around. Too much liability. And in many cases, their solution was…

 “...You’re letting me go,” I concluded. “Now that I have an arrest on my record, I’m a burden to the herd.”

Naartis responded by turning his chair sideways, looking out the window into his private garden. “Lerai,” he began. “The paw I hired you, I knew I was taking a risk. But it wasn’t without purpose… there are some incredible artists who are known to have minor cases of Predator Disease. Polohn. Dorlasav. Sematii. All eccentrics who have caused great waves in the vast ocean of art. Perhaps… I hoped I’d find a little pearl of my own, that I could nurture into something greater. Truly, I did see some potential in you.”

Without turning his chair, he glanced back towards me. “...But not all pearls can become true gems, I suppose. This will be your last paw with us.”

…

*F-Fired…*

*…*

Silently, I stood. I turned, and I walked out of the room without so much as a tail-flick, quietly opening the door and shutting it softly behind me. Naartis watched me go without a word.

Turning down the hall, I trudged towards the locker room to go collect my things and leave my apron. Prey of all kinds stopped their conversations and side-eyed me as I went. Did they all know about the arrest? Had Naartis told them?

Well, not like it matters now.

I shuffled into the locker room, entered my code, and quietly took my bag and hoodie. Then I removed my apron and hung it on the hook. My paw went to the locker’s door to shut it.

And I didn’t. I just… numbly stared at the apron for a scratch. Soon, emotions began to swirl inside me. Sadness. Frustration. Anger. My breath began to quicken.

“RRGH!” I slammed the locker shut as hard as I could, and the crashing sound reverberated through the room. Anyone who wasn’t already staring at me definitely was now.

I threw my bag and hoodie over my shoulder, not even bothering to put them on, and stormed out of the room towards the exit. “Stupid Naartis, brahking… ‘oh you saved your dad and sister from getting harassed great job Lerai now as a reward why don’t we FIRE YOU!’” I brayed into the air, not caring who heard me.

As I exited the building into the park and stomped towards the gate, I happened to run into Vyrlo, shoveling fertilizer into a flower bed near the path. His ears perked up as he saw me approach.

“Oh, hey Lerai…” his voice withered and his ears fell. “Ralchi’s light, what’s wrong?” he asked full of concern.

“I was fired,” I muttered darkly, without slowing down.

“Sorry, WHAT?” He looked towards the main building where I’d just come from, then back at me. “What for?!”

“The arrest. Said it was for a no-call no-show, but we know that’s vyalpic.”

“Well, that’s…” He began to follow after me. “Aren’t there supposed to be protections against that kind of thing? I mean, you weren’t even formally accused of PD! Maybe you could sue–”

“It doesn’t matter!” I interrupted with a loud bleat. “I don’t have the money for another lawyer! Syhan cut me a deal since I helped out Parla and it *still* ate up most of my savings! I-I just…”

The anger started to give way to tears. “...I-I’m sorry…” I muttered, before I turned and ran.

“Lerai, wait!” I heard Vyrlo call after me. But I didn’t stop.

Running for the exit, I paused only briefly, right as I reached the gate. There, bordering the fence, was the nectar drop bush I was just tending a few scratches ago.

A little bit of the anger, and a hint of defiance returned. I grabbed a flower and shoved the whole sweet blossom in my mouth, before my feet carried me down the road.

  

\++++++++++

  

It was a while before the frustration began to fade. I found myself sitting on a public bench.

Make no mistake, I was still *really* frustrated. But it was just sort of… aimless. I wanted to go home, and yet I didn’t want to be alone in the house by myself. And yet at the same time, I DID want to be alone. And also I wanted to talk to someone. The swirling conflict in my mind was just annoying me further.

*Maybe I shouldn’t have run from Vyrlo… I could use a friend right now. Stars, I’ve been a terrible herdmate to him. This is twice now I’ve ditched him.*

The thought that I’d been a bad friend was only making me feel even worse. I leaned forward, cupping my face in my palms and sighing. I needed to do *something* besides mope here on a bench\*,\* if only to let out some of this frustration.

Reaching into my bag next to me, I took my pad and sent a message to Vyrlo, just for my peace of mind.

*TwilitFloret: Hey. I’m sorry I ran off.*

A moment later, the pad chimed.

*HarvestDancer: You just got fired and you’re concerned about ME?*

*HarvestDancer: Please, it’s fine. I know the whole thing must have been a shock. Do you want to talk?*

*TwilitFloret: …Not right now. But thanks.*

*HarvestDancer: I’m only a message away.*

My mood lifted ever-so-slightly, I stowed the pad. *Well, now what? I have nothing to do… I could go to the gym early, but none of my herdmates will be there. I haven’t even been back since the match with Rika. And there’s no one at home either… Should I call Dad or Hiyla? No, no, Hiyla’s at school, and Dad’s having his interview this paw. If it doesn’t go well, we’ll be completely jobless…*

I began to anxiously twist my tail. *I-I don’t know for sure if Dad’s gonna be able to handle being around Humans… and I don’t know if anyone is going to hire me now! Stars, I… what am I supposed to do now…?*

The fear swirled inside me. Supporting three people on one wage was tough enough… even if I found something else, it probably wouldn’t pay as well. If Dad didn’t get the job, or if I couldn’t find something new, we’d be out of the house by the end of the pass!

I shook my head. *Okay. Okay. Calm down… I still have some time… I just have to find something else. Even if it’s cheap work, it’ll be better than nothing. And I’m not gonna do that just sitting here.*

With my mission decided, I stood, and finally put on my jacket and bag. “Okay…” I muttered to myself. “Time to go job-harvesting, I guess. Oh, stars, I haven’t updated my resume since I was hired at the park…! W-Well, I can do that at home later. For now, let’s just see if there’s any ‘help wanted’ signs anywhere.”

  

\++++++++++

  

“I’m sorry, but I can’t really afford any new employees right now,” the Venlil said, hefting a crate of fruit to display in front of the store. Setting it down, he brushed his thick wool out of his eyes. “You know how it is with the recession. But if you leave a resume, we could get back to you if something opens up.”

“I…” *Brahk, I should have just updated my resume first…* “I’ll just come back another time. Thanks.”

With an ear flick, the busy shopkeeper returned to his work, and I continued on my way. *Well, that’s another rejection…*

This was already getting tremendously discouraging. Less people were hiring than I thought… it’d gotten to the point that the lack of a “help wanted” sign was no longer a factor in whether or not I asked. I didn’t realize how lucky I’d really had it. Ever since the Venlil split from the Federation, we’d been deep in a recession. And we didn’t really have the wartime infrastructure of other species like the Gojid or Krakotl… we’d always trusted them to protect us.

Already, the dejection was draining me. Rejection after job rejection had planted weeds in my spirit. I felt completely exhausted and it was barely third sun.

*Maybe I should take a break…*

I looked around. I was near the market… maybe I could see if Pikro was around. I shouldn’t buy a mocha now that we had no income, but he was a great listener, and I really needed an ear. 

So I made the short trek into the market. It was crowded as usual… but I didn't mind. If anything, my mood was lifting just a bit. Pikro’s stall just had a nice atmosphere to it, and thinking about taking a break at his counter and chatting his ear off made my tail wag ever so slightly.

But as I finally broke through the crowd to see his stall, I only found it shuttered. Coffee Gojid was nowhere to be seen.

My ears fell. There was a sign hanging on the shutter itself, and I stepped closer to read it. It was written in rugged Gojid script, so I pulled out my pad and activated the visual translator.

It read “Gone on a trip with the missus. Be back in five paws!   –Pikro.”

I blankly stared at the sign for a moment. The misery returned full force, this time with a nice healthy dash of anger. “Brahking…!” I cursed to no one, before I pulled the hood of my jacket in front of my mouth and let loose a muffled scream into the fabric. The noise was drowned out by the hustle and bustle of the market.

Why was this paw stars-bent on being so awful? Was it something I did? Were the stars watching and passing their judgement? I’d been good, though! Tell them, Mom!

Letting the fabric fall, I let loose a groan of frustration. Now what? I guess I could find another place to rest, or keep looking for work… but honestly, the whole paw had been ruined completely beyond repair at this point. I just wanted to go home. My family should be getting back about now, anyways.

I shook my head again. I still had a little fuel in the reactor. I could look a little longer.

*Hey, uh, Little Flame? Now that we’re more cool with each other, could you maybe give me a boost?*

I waited a moment, but it didn’t respond. Figures. This sorta thing isn’t really *its* thing.

Still, I turned and got back to my search. Asking around the marketplace at each stall, which I realized quickly was probably a flowerbird’s plan. Most of the stalls were family operated, and weren’t hiring outsiders.

So I tried down the street, heading back in the direction of the park. There were a few restaurants around, and I asked in every single one. Maybe someone needed tables waited, or brahk, dishes washed. But at each place I tried, I was only met with further rejection.

Eventually, I’d had enough. I was miserable enough to no longer be able to hide it—my ears were in a constant state of drooping, and my tail was practically dragging along the ground.

*Guess I’ll just go home and deliver the bad news…*

So I turned… when something stopped me.

*…Hmm?*

I looked up. I hadn’t realized it, but I recognized the business in front of me.

*Eorna and Seagal’s.* *This is the bar where that whole thing happened… I met with Vyrlo’s herd, and I threw a Letian into their floor…*

I stared at the building. I couldn’t help but notice that the “Humans welcome” sign had been removed… but other than that, it looked the same. It was open, too. Since Venlil Prime didn’t have a day/night cycle, many bars were open on different suns.

*…Didn’t Vyrlo or somebody else say that they’d buy me a round on the house next time I went in?*

I couldn’t exactly say no to “free” right now… and if I was being honest, I could use the drink. So despite myself, I trudged towards the wooden door and quietly entered. The bell above the entrance jingled to announce my arrival.

The bar itself was moderately busy, with about half the tables and seats filled. Prey species of all types were enjoying the cozy, warm atmosphere with their herdmates, some in joy, and some in sympathy. It really was a nice place… Vyrlo and his herdmates had good taste.

“Hey, welcome!” came a voice. It was the Fissan at the bar, serving a drink to another customer. Was he Eorna, or Seagal? I didn’t remember. “Have a seat, I’ll be right with you…”

He stopped briefly, staring at me for a scratch before his eyes widened. “Oh, hey! It’s you! It’s, uh…”

“Lerai,” I finished for him.

“That’s it! I recognized the pelt!” He turned his head out towards the tables. “Hey! Seagal! That Venlil’s here!”

“What Venlil? We have a *ton* of Venlil, it’s Venlil Prime!” answered the Nevok, serving more drinks to patrons at one of the tables. But then his eyes fell on me. “Oh, *that* Venlil! With the flip!”

A Venlil at his table glanced at me curiously. “What are you two talking about? What flip?” she asked.

“Oh, you shoulda seen it! There was this Letian that got completely plastered, and then–”

“Hey, uh, sorry…” I interrupted. I didn’t really want them to make a big deal out of it. “I was just wondering if that drink offer is still available?”

The Fissan—Eorna, by process of elimination—let out a soft, nickering chuckle. “You look like you need it. Have a seat. Seagal, don’t torture the poor thing, yeah?”

“Alright, alright,” he replied, flicking an ear before turning back to me. “But seriously. We did appreciate it. It’s rare for things to get that rowdy around here, but I’m happy you were here when it did.”

“Has it happened more than once?” I asked, sliding into the seat.

“It’s a bar. The occasional drunk losing their prey inhibitions happens every once in a while, especially given how strong the local liquor is,” Eorna replied. “Speaking of strong liquor, what’ll you have?”

“Sweet stinger. Thanks.”

The Fissan flicked an ear the Venlil way, and pulled a bottle of middle-shelf rymek from its spot. “So what’s up? I’ll be honest, I wasn’t sure you’d actually come back here to claim this,” Eorna said with a sympathetic look, as he began mixing the cocktail.

I sighed, slumping forward on the bar counter. “I got fired…”

“Oh, no…”

“Yeah. Worst part was, I was basically punished for doing a good thing.” I buried my snout in my arms. “I’ve been job-searching for a claw and a half, and haven’t harvested a single thing.”

“Yeah, things are rough right now with the recession,” Eorna said in sympathy. “I know Tarva was right in the end to split from the Federation, but it’s still awful how much pressure it’s putting on the average person. Just hang in there, yeah?”

I let out a weak laugh. “Hey, you don’t happen to be hiring right now, do you?”

Rather than the polite rejection I’d been expecting, to my surprise, the Fissan looked me up and down. “...Well, maybe…”

“Wait, really?” This was the first time all paw I hadn’t been turned down, and I couldn’t help but feel a surge of hope. “Wh-What do you need done?” I brayed, pushing myself up on the counter excitedly. “I can wait tables, I can wash dishes, uh, I could serve drinks, I don’t have a liquor license but I could get one–”

“Whoa, whoa, slow down!” Eorna laughed. “It’s, well… it’s complicated.”

Those were the worst words I’d ever heard. “Complicated how?” I asked, dejectedly slumping back into the barstool.

“Well…” The Fissan placed my finished stinger in front of me. It looked delicious, and the sweet notes of the alcohol filled the air. “Am I safe to guess from the pelt that you’re around Humans often?”

“Uhh… Yeah, I am,” I replied. I took the glass in a paw and gently took a sip of the yellowish cocktail, letting the sour-sweetness envelop my taste buds. *Brahk, I needed this…*

“I see…” the Fissan muttered. “Then, is it true they can drink alcohol? Despite being predators?”

*Uh?* “Why are you asking? Didn’t you have a ‘Humans welcome’ sign up last time I was here?”

“To be fair, we weren’t sure any of the predators were actually going to take us up on that,” the Fissan admitted, picking up a dirty glass and beginning to clean it. “We just figured ‘well, the Humans are clearly here to stay now, and after the Krakotl bombed their planet and Nikonus turned out to have lied about a lot of things, why don’t we just say they’re welcome even if they probably can’t drink?’ We figured we’d look more progressive at the time.”

My ears pinned back slightly in disgust. “So you were just trying to pull people in without actually caring about the Humans?”

“It’s not that we didn’t care. When that Human came in, we agreed to honor the offer and serve them, remember?” the Fissan countered. “We just didn’t think the offer would ever *actually* be taken up, because of their biology as predators. Alcohol tolerance is typically reserved for prey, since it appears naturally in fermenting fruit.”

He let out a snort. “Shows what we get for not doing the market research… Seagal went through the data dump the paw after you showed up, and it claimed that they could eat plants just fine. Which meant they could have alcohol by extension. It’s weird…”

“So if you know Humans can drink, why is it gone now?” I asked.

“Because the one time a Human *did* show up, it turned into you scuffing our nice floor with a drunkard. That was the worst fight I’ve seen since we opened this place\*.\*”

I couldn’t help but look away. “Sorry…”

“No, don’t be. That came out a bit harsher than I meant. We really did appreciate the help, just…” He let out a snorting sigh through his nose. “Too much liability, you know.”

My ears drooped, and I let out a breath. I couldn’t help but feel bad for the Humans. “It wasn’t even their fault though…” I muttered.

“I know… it’s unfair. But it was still too much of a risk,” he replied, though he didn’t seem proud of it. “We should have prepared better… funny enough, now we sort of have the opposite problem. The original offer seems to have spread through the Human pack via word-of-mouth. We’ve had more show up at the door since, and they’re always disappointed when we turn them down…”

“I see…” I muttered, taking another sip of the drink. *I still wish they hadn’t taken the sign down, but I can see why they’d do it…* “Wait, so what does that have to do with you hiring someone?”

“Well, Seagal and I have been debating trying again,” he admitted. “We know it’s risky, but… it doesn’t seem like any other bars are willing to take the chance on the predators. A lot of bars serve as safe-spaces for prey to mingle without the Humans around, you see. But we figure that if we were the first to allow them, and became a similar space for Human-friendly prey to come with their predator herdmates, we’d be filling a gap in the market. We already know there’s a customer base, since they keep showing up.”

“That’s a great idea!” I brayed. “I’d love to come here with my own Humans. You should do it!”

“...Welllll…” The Fissan hesitated. “It’s just… despite everything, neither of us are actually all that comfortable around the predators. I mean… How do you handle a drunk predator? We have no idea. So we’ve been considering hiring someone who really understands them.”

“I mean…” I thought aloud. “...You already know how to handle a drunk predator. You saw me toss that Letian, right?”

“What are you talking about? Letians aren’t predators.”

“They *were.* They’re one of the cured species. They used to be omnivores like Humans.”

Eorna stopped his glass-cleaning. His ears flicked and his snout twitched as he considered my words. “...No, that’s different,” he eventually replied.

“How so?”

“Because they *were* predators. As in, no longer predators,” he explained. “I get what you’re saying, but… regardless of the horrible things the Federation have done, Letians don’t eat flesh. They don’t hunt. They don’t have those latent instincts like Humans do.”

Seagal joined the conversation as he passed by. “What we’re worried about specifically is that if a Human gets drunk, it’ll lower their inhibitions, and loosen their control on their instincts. And then, well… we just don’t want some poor Dossur getting turned into a snack to go with their drinks, know what I mean?”

“They don’t have hunting instincts.” I sipped my drink. “Besides, last I saw, that Letian tried to slice my friend open. Seems pretty violent to me. A Dossur would be at risk there too.”

“That’s… hmmm…” Eorna mumbled. It didn’t seem like he’d thought of that.

“See, I know that’s what the Humans *say* about their instincts, but I don’t know if I really believe it,” Seagal replied. “Like, let’s not kid ourselves, they’re *real predators,* yeah? They’re really good at suppressing their instincts to hunt and kill, but they gotta let ‘em loose at some point. ‘S probably why they mostly keep to themselves over in their own district.”

I grumbled, taking another sip of the strong drink. “Buddy, trust me, I’ve seen them at their worst.” My mind went back to the second time Vince found me being harassed in the alleyway. “It’s not an issue of control, they just don’t have them. You don’t have to worry about it.”

The Nevok, however, just flicked an ear dismissively. “I’m just sayin’...”

I just sighed. Why couldn't people just understand?

Eorna let out deep, soothing chuckle. “Hey Seagal. Why don’t we just ban all the ex-predator species while we’re at it? Gojid, Krakotl…”

“And miss out on those customers? Fat chance,” the Nevok replied dryly. “‘Sides, I do kinda get what she’s getting at. Not like we prey can’t play dirty sometimes.”

“Nonsense. Name one time.”

Seagal just looked at his friend, thoroughly unimpressed. “Well I could start with our species’ respective media all about corporate espionage, buuuuut… Remember that time you snuck into my family’s store in the middle of the night ten cycles back to–”

“Alright, alright, point taken,” the Fissan sighed. “Let’s not go airing out all my mistakes now.”

With the topic seemingly dropped, Eorna quickly began mixing up some more drink orders. “But even though we understand what you’re saying, Lerai, it all boils down to the fact that we don’t really want a repeat of what happened when you were here.”

“Hmmm…” I intoned. *I could hear the unspoken implication: that things would happen with Humans around. I could definitely see someone getting rough with a Human. And if the Human got rough back… regardless of what happened, they’d probably end up getting blamed.*

“But all that said… we do still want to give them a chance,” Eorna continued, as Seagal took the drinks and wandered off. “We’re just worried about the risk, so we first need to find a way to *minimize* that risk. So I guess we’re looking for a bouncer?”

“A bouncer?”

“You know, like the big Mazics and Takkans and whatnot at other bars that check IDs and throw out rowdy drunks,” he explained. “We’ve been considering hiring one for the occasional prey drunks anyhow, especially since the incident. But the issue is that Mazic or not, the prey who are willing to challenge a predator in a show of dominance are few and far between.”

“I see…” I muttered. With a slow sip, I finished the drink and placed the empty glass on the counter. “I could do that.”

Eorna, at my offer, simply let out a soft, nickering laugh, causing my ears to fall slightly. “Listen, I appreciate it, but… we’re looking more for someone like an ex-Exterminator. Someone who really understands predator behavior beyond just being herdmates with them. Do you have any experience in the force?”

“I… no,” I admitted. “But I know I can handle Humans! What, is it because I’m a Venlil?”

“No, no! You’re obviously plenty knowledgeable about Humans, and you can handle yourself, even if I don’t understand how. It’s just… we have to pick *really* carefully, if we do this at all. Because if there’s a slip-up, and someone gets hurt, or worse, eaten…” He shuddered, his snout scrunching up. “Forget business liability, *I* wouldn’t be able to live with myself.”

I must have looked *really* dejected at the opportunity slipping through my digits, because he gave me a look of sympathy. “Look, I can’t promise anything, but if you’ve got a resume…”

“No, it’s fine…” I mumbled.

“You sure? Even if you’re not an Exterminator, I figured you might have some military training, to do what you did…” Eorna questioned idly. “How *did* you do that crazy flip-throw-thing, anyway?”

“I, well…” I hesitated. I didn’t want to put anyone in danger until we were ready to go public. “I’d… rather not talk about it.”

“I see… well, I won’t push it,” Eorna replied, a hint of disappointment in his voice. He motioned to the empty glass. “Want another? You’ll have to pay for it, though.”

“No, I should probably be getting home,” I sighed, sliding from the seat. “Thanks, though.”

“Sure. If we do figure something out and reopen to Humans, then bring your predators, yeah? Assuming they’re not *really* rowdy drunks.”

“I will.”

With a simple tail-flick goodbye, I put my paws in my jacket pockets and made for the door. “Bye! Thanks for stopping in!” Seagal called after me. I repeated the tail-flick towards the Nevok in response.

I gently shut the wooden door behind me. My tail swayed idly—I was still feeling anxious about the future, but at least for now I did feel a little better.

*I hope those two do figure something out… I want to take my Human herdmates places.*

With a little breath of contentment and a hint of disappointment, I turned to start my walk home. Where should I look next paw? Well, I should actually get my resume updated first. Then maybe… I dunno, are the Humans still hiring? Maybe if Dad does get his job he could put in a word—

Lost in my own thoughts, I snoutplanted right into something fuzzy.

SW-200lbs CW-192lbs 46F Perimenopausal 

I am a newbie because I started seven weeks ago. I started with 14-10, but very soon, I increased it to 16:8. I usually do 18:6 on weekends.

I started working out regularly -3-5 times a week, strength training, and walks—three weeks ago. The first month, I didn't have any problem with hunger pangs. However, my hunger pangs have been killing me for the last two weeks. My appetite increases noticeably in the last 5-10 days of my menstrual cycle. This is not new. This has always been the case. 

So now, the combination of my new workout schedule and period food cravings is killing me. I try to include more protein and good carbs—the whole deal. :( But I am really struggling right now. I can't stop thinking about food all the time when I am fasting. 

I have tried black coffee and water, but they only help briefly. The thought of food is always there. Has anybody else felt this before? How do you deal with it?

Snow White: she would adapt very quickly. She’ll sing to the birds but they won’t sing back and she’ll be fine with it. She’s one of those girls that have a very can-do attitude. She’ll find a job right away and excel doing it because she’s one of those people that just wants to be helpful.

Cinderella: also adapts to the world around her. Her dreams might be a little smaller and easier to achieve. She blends in very well.

Aurora would be the tricky one. Because she immediately hides when she meets a stranger and I can’t imagine that going well if someone’s just like trying to be nice and help her. On the other hand, she adapts pretty quickly too.

Ariel wants to get into everything and talk to everyone and she’s very perky and maybe a little annoying to everyone around her. I don’t think she’s the one that knows boundaries quite yet. I love her, but she’s very eager to learn everything, including maybe taking apart a microwave. I think Rapunzel and Anna would follow in her footsteps. Both of them are just poking around at the world trying to figure out what is going on.

Belle: fine just like Cinderella and Snow White. She’s gonna be hanging around; maybe she’ll hang out at that café with her book and a hot chocolate (coffee was everywhere chocolate was a commodity just for the upper class).

Jasmine: judging from the time she took that apple and didn’t pay for it I think she’s gonna have a hard time at first before settling in quickly. She’d love luxury goods and like shop at Bloomingdale’s, she strikes me as having an expensive taste but in a classy way.

Mulan, Pocahontas, Raya, Elsa, and Merida observe and adapt. They like wearing jeans or pullover dresses. Merida is quite disappointed to learn that she doesn’t ride horses everywhere, she likes the big flatbed trucks though and hikes. Mulan becomes a board game junkie. 

Honestly, a majority of their hobbies (except Raya) still exist in today’s world and probably will continue to do them. Merida will find a stable and archery range. Mulan will find those old people that play checkers in the park and watch them for a little bit. Pocahontas likes extreme sports and a roller coaster junkie. Elsa likes school and learns engineering. Raya just rides a motorcycle around everywhere. 

Tiana’s world is closest to our own. No need to get into her.",1,1742524774.0,disneyprincess,1,1.0,False

Tonight we’ll be looking at the AFC South. I have a feeling this one should be fun, so let’s jump right into the biggest one:

Houston Texans: *Force everyone that was born in the state of Texas to live within the stadium*

As complicated it would be, on so many different levels, to have every natural born Texan moved into a limited stadium, it could happen if everyone just chose to freeze in place and lay on the ground like sardines forever. Granted, that would make viewing the actual game much more difficult, but then profits could be made by selling tickets to the lucky few who get to sit in the stands and actually watch the players, who will also be laying down in sardine formation to conserve space. The o-line may not be the best, but they’ll find a way to get under their opponents.

Indianapolis Colts: *Horses everywhere, and multiple games of horseshoes around the stadium*

We’re going full western with this one. Horses around the field putting the janitors to work, on the field munching on that sweet sweet artificial turf, and even in the stands filling up unused seats (would that count as pumping crowd noise?). Just don’t ask the vendors what they use when they’re running low on meat. As for the horseshoes, it may not be the best form of entertainment, but as always, this is about accuracy, not practicality, and hey, maybe this can help them bond with their great-great-great grandparents over entertainment, so this is a family-friendly idea, of course (we are not bringing in Megan Thee Stallion to fit with this).

Jacksonville Jaguars: *Just like the Colts, but put jaguars everywhere, and cover the stadium in plants and vines*

We’re going with some full predatory themes here, and I mean animals, you sickos. Granted, there’s still plenty of safety hazards with jaguars and potentially 5 year old kids in the same room, but as long as we don’t have the next Harambe, and as long as no one is injured, everyone will be a-okay, hopefully. Bonus points if the vines are painted blonde to match Trevor’s hair.

Tennessee Titans: *Bring God down to the stadium and force Him to live there*

Would this be controversial? Sure. Could it count as sacrilege putting a deity in the same building as a man who puts dollops of mayonnaise into his coffee before drinking? Absolutely. But imagine the scene of literal God sitting with the fans watching the Tennessee Titans of all teams play football on a regular Sunday. That could boost some ratings.

**PROLOGUE:**

  
our story begins when audrey, (now with control over the cycle) went to get some coffee from downstairs. But when she returned, she realised the book controlling the cycle disappeared! She realised someone stole it, and took it for themself. in the cycle, we pan to a lost one named Michelle. Michelle is in Charge of searching for supplies to keep the lost ones safe & healthy, but when she exits, she notices a stairwell she didn’t notice before. She goes through it and ends up on another floor of the studio: Level M. She searches for any life, but comes across a GENT Pipe. This seems to have been upgraded by someone… and she then is ambushed by the butcher gang. they knock her out, but before She blacks out, a mysterious figure takes out all the butcher gang.

**CHAPTER 1: “IN A DARK PLACE”**

 Michelle then wakes up to find herself inside some sort of bedroom, and then she exits the room and finds herself inside some sort of safehouse. She then meets a searcher-lost one-mix whose name is Allen. allen agrees to help Michelle find out the secrets of the lost Levels. Allen gives Michelle a key and she leaves. Michelle comes across a door, and it could only be opened by a switch in a nearby storage room. The storage room is gated of though, and Allen seeps under the gate. She then flicks the lever and leaves Michelle to fight for herself. After entering the door, we see a small figure scurrying away. Michelle corners the figure, and it’s revealed to be a small fellow named “Benny.” Benny is small, scared, and has a mechanical arm that can access executive-access doors. they both briefly encounter a version of The Ink Demon. This is a minion of the much more big And powerful Ink Demon. Michelle and Benny both get in a little miracle station, and the demon leaves them alone. They both press on and enter a small storage room. After getting swarmed by searchers, they continue into a large storage warehouse. here, Michelle finds a GENT Pipe upgrade. a syringe for getting rid of searchers easier. They come across a flooded staircase that they need to drain. they find a valve and they insert it into a pipe. Then the stairwell drains. They eventually make it to Level 8. They both see another Ink Demon Minion, this time being battled by a lost one. This time wearing suspenders and welding a wrench, and an axe. the Ink Demon Minion runs from her and disappeared into a wall. It is revealed her name is Carla, and she trusts Michelle because she took care of Benny for her. They both wander into a safehouse of sorts where there is a bunch of friendly lost ones and a pile of bacon soup cans. Carla explains how the Ink Demons Michelle has met were mere clones of a much larger, more powerful ink demon. Located in a large cavern containing a gigantic “REEL INK MACHINE.” and the only way to defeat the REEL Ink Demon, he Has to first be vulnerable. And you do this by turning off the REEL INK MACHINE. 

**”CHAPTER 2: OLD FAMILY RECIPE”**

They all exit the safehouse, and get attacked by more searchers, but this time, Michelle has an upgraded GENT Pipe. She easily takes them out. They find a large room With giant vats of Bacon Soup. AKA: The Bacon Soup Production Plant. After turning on the Bacon Soup Machines, the next room is unlocked, but an Ink Demon Minion lurks nearby. After staying quiet and hiding behind the Bacon Soup Vats, the Ink Demon Minion walks away. they gang find an elevator that has 3 buttons. One to Level M, Level 8, and Level D. They all go to level D, and get out of the Elevator. they wander down a corridor and see Sammy walking down the end of it. He notices The gang and quickly hides behind a door, which he locks. The gang wander around and enter a room where there’s another section of the Bacon Soup Production plant. This time, there are winding corridors and offices, and there are lost ones wandering all around. after The gang navigates the offices they end up at a large bendy statue in front of a giant vat of bacon soup. the door that sammy went through required a key. And that key was somewhere in the area… behind the bendy statue, there were offices where people were employed, and where bacon soup designs were made. But now these halls lurk with Lost ones with machines for their heads… they all welded different weapons and all were roaming the halls of the offices. after the gang followed arrows drawn on walls, they found the keys. After they unlocked the room Sammy entered, Sammy ambushed them, resulting in a boss fight. after the gang defeated Sammy, they got to a part where three levers must be flicked at the same time. After the gang does so, there are bashing and clanging sounds coming from Benny‘s location. Carla runs to investigate and a door shuts behind Michelle. Leaving Michelle alone. She finds a long corridor with a door at the end of it. She walks up to it and enters the room. It’s a control room with a pedestal in the center. There’s a big window and two doors left and right. Suddenly, the wall where the window is is broken open, revealing a giant ink demon standing in-front. The REEL INK DEMON. Michelle must navigate through caves all around the large cavern while trying to find three objects and place them in three control rooms. She does so and pulls a switch in a main control room. after that, it turns off the REEL INK MACHINE. this opens a door to her right. behind it is a stairwell, and at the bottom is a tram. She enters the tram and it goes through a door. a door closes behind the tram and another one opens in-front. the tram goes through a long, inky pipe.

**”CHAPTER 3: INDUSTRIAL CONSTRUCT”**

another door closes behind the tram and one opens Infront revealing a tram station. she navigates through some mysterious corridors and even Enters a recreation of chapter one of Bendy And The Ink Machine, and she wanders to a room with an elevator. She goes up and there is a big tube. She enters through A door in the tube, and she gets sucked through inky pipes through the REEL INK MACHINE. She come out as a cartoonish-human. more of a silhouette, but human. She was made of ink But wasn’t dripping everywhere? She found some suspenders to cover herself. And found out shortly that she had the power to traverse through ink. She entered another train station and it led to an area where she found a dock where she found a boat. She climbed Up a ladder and was met with another control room. She met up with Carla and Benny. Carla commented on Michelle’s human appearance and brushed it off. the Ink demon was still a threat though. So they had to act quickly. carla went to a control panel and operated a giant crane and helped Michelle to defeat the ink demon. Michelle found A drill and used it to attack the giant ink demon. When Carla hit the demon and had it knocked over, michelle travelled To the ink demon through the ink and hacked the demon to pieces. and when it was weak enough, Michelle dove Into the demon through a hole on his back. Michelle traversed tunnels inside of the ink demon and found a film reel in his chest labelled “The End.” Michelle took this item and escaped the demon. When she got out, she went to the crane control room and a Door has opened. She walks through and finds a pipe in the ground. Michelle Jumped into the pipe, and ended up in a room with a projector in the centre. She placed the “THE END” Reel on it, but was ambushed by a group of searchers, lost ones, GENT Minions, and butcher gang members. but then, the gang came back together and fought them all off. Everyone was there, including Allen! After a battle, Michelle placed the film reel on the projector, and turned it on…

**“EPILOGUE”**

Michelle woke up in joeys abandoned apartment as a human in normal clothes. She looked around The abandoned apartment and found a door. She opened the door, and got to the lost ones’ safe house. Back at the beginning.

Here's some things about us:

- We've been together for 2 and a half years.  
- She's not a gamer. I'm one since I was a kid.  
- I never forced her to play games. I asked her once to watch me play Final Fantasy Rebirth on launch (only that day), but that was it.  
- She works from 8am to 4pm. I work from 1pm to 5:30pm.  
- She played through It takes two from start to end with me. She had problems at first, and she asked me if I could skip some sections for her. I gave her clues, but she managed to complete the game without me touching her controller once. I feel that's important, because if I skipped, I'd lack trust for her, and she'd have more trouble later in the game, which didn't happen.  
- We started two other games, A way out and Unravel 2. We've only played each of them once, and I'm not in a hurry to finish those games.  

I feel like that's enough info. Since December 12th, when Split Fiction was announced, I told her I wanted to play this game with her. For me, this game will be the best experience in the year. I just love everything that Josef Fares does with gaming. We watched trailers, I shared my excitement with her.

And then, on release day, I picked her from work, made her coffee (which she likes in the afternoon), gave her time to take a shower. Although I was super excited, I didn't want to rush her. After all this, we started to play. She was playing with an angry face, and ONE hour later she says ""When are we stopping?"". We barely started, but I did turn the game off. 

We've played 10 times already since release on March 6th, but she keeps asking when are we shopping, sometimes she gets stressed and she starts to play badly saying she lost focus, and she uses cutscenes to grab her phone. She can't even recall that much of the game's story.

I feel it's not enough. I give my life for this woman. I put her even before my needs. And always smiling. Never complained about having to do something for her. I was happy because of being with her. But she says I should be grateful and that I do not understand. I know she might be tired, but I feel like at least on the release day, she could've put a little more effort, played a little more, would be more willing to engage with me and the story, but the feeling I get from her is that a burden.

That's it, am I expecting too much of her? We say we are each other's best friends, and I know she works more than me, but it feels like an excuse when I hear it every time we play.",2,1742524511.0,relationship_advice,9,0.75,False

Maybe more. I’ve been listening to some of Neville’s lectures but as I’m pretty busy recently I haven’t got far. And some tips here on this sub have been pretty helpful.

Anyways… I kinda had a realization this week. A realization that me and my family have kinda been manifesting my whole life. We’re in a good spot now, but early on we had a pretty cruddy life, but for simplicity I’ll leave it at that unless it’s relevant.

When we’d find ourselves in a less than optimal situation, like when we all got the flu and our power/water was out, or longer term situations, we’d always say “It will get better. Things will work out like they always do.” And… they always do. A lot of times it happens in the most unexpected or magic-feeling ways. Like when I was in high school and we were looking for a house because our current house was becoming unsafe, I told my bus driver “I may not be here much longer. We’re looking for a new place to rent.” And… she told me her family was renting out a house in the next town over. After giving her my mom’s number to send info, we got into the house within the month, and even at a discounted rent because we were recommended by a family member.

So now I’m thinking… how can I apply this to “consciously manifesting?” As in… I always said things like “things will work out how they’re supposed to” because it was a phrase ingrained in me since I was young, it’s easy to set and forget, but when I’m trying to manifest, even something small like a coffee, I can’t really “assume.” I can tell myself with the utmost confidence “I’m getting a coffee today” but it just… doesn’t. Has anybody had similar experience (realizing you’ve manifested all your life and applying it now) and if so, what advice might you have? I know in the end everyone has their own way of working the law, and I think given some work with this realization I could come to that same point.

Basically the title but obviously some more context 
So I (25F) and (24F) reconnected at the end of 2024 through Instagram. We went to high school together weren’t close but close enough that I can consider her as a friend , we did hang out ALOT during the summer of our senior year, and got her a job at where I worked before. but we just kinda drifted apart. I guess since we went to different colleges and really didn’t have that much things in common so it was a given that we weren’t gonna be speaking to each other a lot. No hard feelings, just life be lifing. Went to college Covid hit and she deleted her social media or more like she blocked everyone from high school, including myself I didn’t know what happened,  from what I heard from other high school friends it was because of her political stand, I personally didn’t care much of it and did my own thing

Now she’s married with a much older man ( none of my business) she added me on Instagram again we started sending some memes and just chatting in general about life and she wanted to talk to me in person. So we scheduled a date in December and I thought it went well. I got her a small Christmas gift as well. It was mostly about her venting that she has no friends and that her only friend is her husband and and told me the reason why she blocked everyone was because someone from her friend group was joining insults to her husband because hes police officer, which made her not want to associate herself with anybody, along with other friendship drama in the group that she was in. she’s currently pregnant and it made her rethink about friends and wanted to get close to me again because of common believes and that she liked my company. we talked for hours in the coffee shop until it was time for her to be picked up by her husband. We still chat, send some song recommendations. Nothing too crazy but we still keep in touch. Probably like every other day. along with sending memes. 

In January, she sent me a baby registry which is fine. I told her I’ll take a look and see what I can (was unemployed at that time and she was aware) 
Now a few weeks back, she just had her baby shower… I wasn’t invited. It looked like a big baby shower with venue. I’m not gonna lie. I was a bit hurt and confused but mostly confused because she sent me her registry but not an invite. I saw her posting in her story about the baby shower so I sent her a message and curtain congratulated her and told her to have fun. Maybe I should tell her I was a little hurt that I wasn’t invited or WIBTAH if I stop talking to her? I don’t want to feel like I was just her therapist and she’s good to go now.",2,1742524103.0,AITAH,3,0.76,False

Same thing with Door Dash, ordering food twice a week adds up. Both are very tempting when you’re tired or not in the mood to cook or to make your own coffee.

I deleted both apps at the beginning of the year. I didn’t delete either account; in case I needed to redownload them (for whatever reason). I have caved a couple times. I had the excuse of “oh I’m running late to work, let just order a coffee quick to pick up” or “I’m not in the mood to cook.” But I’ve kept them deleted for a long time since those hick-ups.

Today, I’ve made the executive decision to delete both accounts. I realized that if I’m not willing to sit in the drive-thru or stand in line to wait for coffee/food (or anything at this point), I don’t deserve to enjoy these splurges. This seems obvious but self-control can be a tricky thing.

**Theme:**

The theme that we're inspired by is Organic Modern - not married to this but it is quite compelling. Minimalistic and Japandi are quite nice too. 

Hoping to feel safe, welcome, cozy and warm. 

I've added a GIF of the walkthrough, a 2D rendering of the space (as close to measurement as possible), and more pictures. 

**What we currently will bring with us on our move:** 

1. We have 2 standing desks. The left table top is oak with grey legs and the right table top will be black with black legs. We prefer to keep these as we work remotely.
2. We have a 55"" TV, and a white ikea [AURDAL ](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/aurdal-wardrobe-combination-white-s09331524/)that has only drawers, with no rods protruding from it.
3. There is overhead lighting and we hope to switch the bulb so we have more control of the lighting, but also are intrigued by floor lamps, or any additional lighting we can bring in.

  
**Constriants:** 

1. The walls are white.
2. The floors are light brown wood 
3. There's overhead lighting in each room, but we will probably want additional lighting 

**Thoughts so far:** 

So far what I've looked at is Lovesac for couches - a sectional chaise, since we don't have an incredible amount of space we were considering a 2 seat with chaise, with each section (3 total) having storage underneath).

  
We also are conflicted between a coffee table and a small dining table - sitting on the floor to eat dinner is a deal breaker, but a lift top coffee table might be sufficient.

1jg6gzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jg6gzl/fn_the_static_bloom/,[FN] The Static Bloom,"The rain tasted like rust in New Veridia. It always did this time of year, clinging to the neon signs and slicking the grimy alleyways I called home base. My name’s Flicker – or at least, that's what they call me. Real name? Doesn’t matter. I specialize in minor inconveniences: rerouting power grids to dim streetlights during rush hour, subtly altering traffic signals for maximum chaos, occasionally swapping out the sugar in the mayor’s coffee with salt. Harmless stuff. Annoying, sure, but harmless. The local supers – the Bright Guard – tolerated me like a persistent mosquito. A nuisance, easily swatted away when they bothered.

I considered myself an artist of disruption. A maestro of mild mayhem. It was all a game, you see. A way to feel… something in this city that felt increasingly grey.

Then came Obsidian. He arrived without fanfare, just a ripple in the usual hum of New Veridia’s energy field. They said he was from the Outer Rim Territories – a place where heroes were legends and villains ruled with an iron fist. I dismissed it as hyperbole until I saw him. A towering figure wreathed in shadows, his eyes burning like cold embers.

The Bright Guard tried to stop him. Foolish, brave idiots. They charged in, all shining armor and righteous fury. Obsidian… he played with them. Twisted their powers back on themselves, shattered their defenses with a casual flick of his wrist. And then... the screams started. Real, gut-wrenching screams that echoed through the city’s underbelly.

I watched from the shadows, huddled in my usual perch above a noodle shop, feeling a cold dread creep into my bones. Obsidian didn't just defeat them; he *destroyed* them. Publicly. Brutally. It was… theatrical. And terrifying.

He moved through New Veridia like a plague, systematically dismantling everything the Bright Guard represented. The city held its breath. Even I, Flicker, the self-proclaimed maestro of mild mayhem, felt powerless.

Then, he came looking for me. Not to fight, not yet. Just… to observe. He found me in my alleyway, surrounded by flickering neon signs and discarded tech scraps.

“You’re Flicker,” he said, his voice a low rumble that vibrated through the pavement. “The little spark.”

I tried to play it cool, leaning against a wall with an air of nonchalant defiance. ""And you're Obsidian. Heard stories.""

He chuckled, a sound devoid of humor. “Stories are often embellished. You, however… you’re more interesting than I anticipated.” He gestured towards the city skyline. ""You manipulate energy fields, don't you? Subtly. Like a whisper in the wind.""

I swallowed hard. My power wasn’t flashy. It was subtle – an ability to subtly influence electromagnetic fields. Enough to dim lights, reroute signals, cause minor electrical glitches. I always thought it was… insignificant. A parlor trick.

“What are you getting at?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

""You have a resonance,"" he continued, ignoring my question. ""A latent potential. You're suppressing it."" He paused, his eyes boring into mine. “Why?”

Suddenly, the alleyway felt smaller, the rain colder. A strange pressure built within me, a tingling sensation that started in my fingertips and spread through my entire body. I clenched my fists, trying to contain it.

“I… I don’t know what you're talking about,” I stammered.

Obsidian smiled, a cruel, predatory curve of his lips. ""Don't lie to me, little spark. Your fear is radiating outwards."" He raised a hand, and the neon signs around us began to pulse erratically, their colors shifting into an unsettling kaleidoscope. The air crackled with energy. “Let it out.”

I fought against it, but the pressure was overwhelming. It felt like my skin was about to split. Then, something snapped. A surge of raw power erupted from me, not subtle manipulations anymore, but a blinding wave of electromagnetic force that sent debris flying and short-circuited every electronic device within a hundred yards.

The rain stopped abruptly. The neon signs exploded in showers of sparks. And I stood there, trembling, bathed in an eerie blue light, feeling… different. Powerful. Terrified.

Obsidian’s smile widened. ""Impressive,"" he said softly. “You were hiding quite the bloom.” He turned and walked away, disappearing into the shadows. “I'll be needing your assistance, Flicker. New Veridia needs a conductor.""

The city was silent now, save for the crackling of dying electronics. I looked down at my hands, still trembling with residual energy. The little spark had ignited. And I knew, with a chilling certainty, that my games were over. My harmless annoyances were a distant memory. Now, I was something else entirely. Something… dangerous.",1,1742523842.0,shortstories,6,1.0,False

1jg6by3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1jg6by3/heres_how_we_managed_to_spend_312_less_in_the/,Here’s how we managed to spend 31.2% less in the last 6 months—without sacrificing our quality of life.,"My fiancé and I are trying to start a business. Unfortunately, borrowing money from a bank isn’t an option for us, and we don’t have anyone to ask for financial help. That means every dollar counts.

Saving enough for a business is a massive challenge no matter where you live, so we decided to get serious about our spending. That meant cutting back, being more intentional with our habits, and making smarter financial choices—including how we power our home.

Here’s exactly how we reduced our expenses by 31.2% in the last six months:

1. Setting a Monthly Spending Limit

If we hit our limit, we don’t spend another dime. Simple as that. Hungry? We get creative with what’s in the fridge. It sounds extreme, but it works. We set a reasonable cap that still covers essentials, and we’ve never actually had to push it to the breaking point.

2. Cutting Out Unnecessary Subscriptions

Everything from streaming services to random app subscriptions—gone. Instead, we use free entertainment options, and honestly, we don’t miss a thing. This alone saved us over $100/month. It’s crazy how much money was going toward things we barely used.

3. No More Takeout or Eating Out

We still eat well—probably better than before—but we cook everything ourselves. We prioritize fresh, local ingredients and have actually started to enjoy the process of meal prepping together. Before, we were spending $320/month on restaurant food. By cutting that out, we’re saving $210/month while eating healthier.

4. Reducing Transportation Costs

If a destination is within a reasonable distance, we walk or bike instead of driving. We still use our car when necessary, but this small change has saved us $80/month on gas and maintenance.

5. No New Clothes or Shoes (Unless Absolutely Necessary)

We realized we already had everything we needed, so we made a rule: no buying new clothes unless we have no replacements at home. In the past six months, we’ve spent just $72 total on clothing.

6. Making Coffee at Home

We used to spend $120/month on coffee from cafés. Now, we use our own espresso machine and take our coffee to go in reusable cups. Not only does this save money, but we also get to make exactly what we want every morning.

7. Optimizing Our Home Energy Use

This was a game-changer. We’ve always been mindful of our electricity bill, but after discovering monalee.co, we realized how much we were overpaying. Their AI-powered platform helped us figure out how to transition to solar in a way that actually made sense financially—without the pushy sales tactics or unnecessary fees. By cutting our dependence on the grid, we’re seeing real long-term savings, which is huge when every dollar matters.

8. Cooking for Our Dog Instead of Buying Expensive Food

We used to spend $230/month on high-quality dog food and treats. Now, we cook balanced meals with real meat and some grains, and our dog loves it. This saves us $112/month while giving our pup healthier food.

Of course, cutting back alone won’t build a business. We’re using the extra savings to invest in growth—funding the tools, marketing, and resources we need. If all goes well, this will help us scale faster and succeed!
