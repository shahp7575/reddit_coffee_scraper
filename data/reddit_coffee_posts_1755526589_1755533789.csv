On the surface, everything looks great: hybrid work, good leave policies, supportive team. The workload can get heavy, but I‚Äôve adapted.

Here‚Äôs my concern: I went on a two-week vacation and came back to find two colleagues (junior to me) have been promoted. I congratulated them and asked my manager what I could do to work towards a promotion. She said she wasn‚Äôt aware of any such promotions and that it was too early for me to think about one, though these two are in her team.

During my performance review, she said my work was excellent, I was approachable, and I supported teammates well. But she added that I should ‚Äúbuild relationships‚Äù by joining coffee/lunch breaks with the team. I‚Äôd already improved my approachability based on earlier feedback, but I prefer taking shorter solo breaks because I‚Äôm introverted and recharge better alone. Meanwhile, my teammates spend hours chatting about reels and shows during these breaks.

I can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm penalized for working differently, even though I‚Äôm delivering. Am I overthinking this?





TL; DR: Went on vacation - came back to find two junior colleagues promoted.

Manager says work is perfect but wants me to ‚Äúbuild relationships‚Äù by joining long social breaks.

Got one solution working to remove that top-right wall. I duplicate the video layer, top layer becomes a Magic Mask of the arm/hands/coffee scoop. The bottom layer is just the normal video + a polygon with a white gradient that covers up and blends that wall.

This solution works wonderfully however Magic Mask does take a bit of time during the tracking process.

My parents, May Allah have mercy on them, are very technologically illiterate, which is why I found myself exposed to pornography before puberty. Such early exposure began an addiction that has persisted 8 years. For the last 5 years, I‚Äôve been trying tirelessly to end this addiction.

I‚Äôve been alone in this journey, ashamed to reveal my addiction to anyone. I have no siblings to relate to and my parents are not understanding of the situation given They grew up in a very different time, not from the US, and refuse to discuss uncomfortable subjects such as this (had to learn abt puberty on my own). My friends are all Muslim and see me as very pious, despite my internal flaws. I feel as I don‚Äôt have anyone to turn to, even my best friends, for this topic is extremely taboo.

I‚Äôve turned completely to Allah SWT but still can‚Äôt find a solution. I‚Äôve tried endlessly to tackle this on my own, but it seems isolation leaves me cornered by shaytaan.

I make dua to Allah SWT.
I try to do as much dhikr to maintain God-consciousness, guided meditation to reduce stress (so I don‚Äôt cope with haram), keep myself busy (so I‚Äôm not bored enough to do haram), use several blocks to maximize friction.

1mtqbg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingSpacesHub/comments/1mtqbg4/does_p_s_interior_cleaner_really_deliver_a_clean/,"Does P & S Interior Cleaner Really Deliver a Clean, Fresh Finish Review?","Testing out the **P & S Professional Detail Products G290P Clean & Shine - Interior Cleaner & Protectant** has been quite the journey. As someone who takes car detailing pretty seriously (I mean, who doesn't love a spotless car interior?), I had high expectations for this product. This cleaner claims to be a triple threat, tackling leather, vinyl, and plastic while providing conditioning and a satin finish. Oh, and it‚Äôs scented! Naturally, I had to put it to the test in a scenario only car enthusiasts and road trip lovers would understand: a post-camping car cleanup. Let‚Äôs dive in.

**Design and Presentation**  
The first thing that caught my eye when unpacking this cleaner was its sheer size‚Äîthe product is a full gallon of liquid. That‚Äôs a massive win for someone who‚Äôs always detailing multiple cars and interiors. The branding, while straightforward, conveys professionalism. The bottle itself is sturdy, and the large nozzle opening makes it easy to pour into smaller spray bottles for application. While practical, I‚Äôd recommend immediately transferring the liquid to something with a more precise sprayer because let‚Äôs face it, trying to use a gallon jug like a pro isn‚Äôt the smoothest experience.

**Ease of Use**  
Applying this cleaner turned out to be a breeze. I tested it on my car‚Äôs notoriously grimy cupholder, where coffee spills meet years of hand sanitizer residue. With just a few sprays and a quick wipe using a microfiber cloth, the grime started lifting off effortlessly. Most importantly, it didn‚Äôt leave behind any sticky or greasy residue‚Äîa pet peeve of mine when it comes to interior cleaners. I also appreciated its versatility; one moment, I was tackling the dusty dashboard, and the next, I was conditioning the leather seats.

**Highlights**  
- Provides a conditioned, satin-like finish.  
- Versatile performance on leather, vinyl, and plastic.  
- Leaves behind a pleasant, fresh scent that isn‚Äôt overpowering.  

[Check P & S Professional Detail Products G290P price on Amazon.](https://interiorsblog.com/p/b0c2x36gj7/)

**Performance on Different Materials**  
My leather seats were the true test. Years of back-and-forth rides with my toddler (and their sticky snacks) had left them looking far from luxurious. After the cleaner was applied, the seats not only looked hydrated but felt soft to the touch. The vinyl surfaces, including side panels, were equally easy to clean, and I noticed how dust adhered less to the surfaces afterward‚Äîsomething I hadn‚Äôt expected! Plastic trims and buttons didn‚Äôt feel slippery after use, which gave me peace of mind regarding controls and switches. 

The fresh scent of this cleaner is another standout feature. Unlike traditional cleaning agents with overpowering chemical smells, this formula leaves your car smelling pleasant, but not like you dumped an air freshener into it.

**Upsides**  
- Convenient one-step solution: cleans, conditions, and protects.  
- Large quantity for long-term use or professional detailing work.  
- Trusted by pros, ensuring pro-grade results for all users.  

**Flaws**  
While I genuinely loved using this cleaner, there are a few things to consider.  
- The product‚Äôs large container makes decanting into spray bottles a requirement.  
- It doesn‚Äôt include a sprayer attachment, which feels like a missed opportunity.  
- Excessive use could leave an overly shiny appearance on certain plastics (less noticeable with lighter applications).  

**Competitive Options**  
I‚Äôve tried a fair share of car interior cleaning products, including big names like Meguiar‚Äôs and Chemical Guys. Here‚Äôs how this cleaner compares:  

- **Meguiar's Ultimate Interior Detailer**: Though similarly effective, Meguiar‚Äôs doesn't combine cleaning and conditioning quite as seamlessly as this product. However, it does come in smaller, ready-to-use bottles, which might appeal to casual users.  
- **Chemical Guys InnerClean**: This one excels in its anti-static properties, keeping dust at bay for longer. Yet, it doesn‚Äôt quite hydrate leather like the P & S product. If preserving leather is your priority, this cleaner takes the edge.  

Out of the three, I felt the **P & S Professional Detail Products G290P** offered a more well-rounded solution, especially for someone who needs versatility and long-lasting performance.

**Value for Money**  
You know the clich√©: you get what you pay for. That phrase couldn‚Äôt be more accurate here. While the gallon-sized container might seem overwhelming for everyday car owners, it caters perfectly to individuals like me who treat interior detailing as a ritual or for professionals servicing multiple vehicles. Considering the product‚Äôs all-in-one functionality‚Äîcombining cleaning, conditioning, and protection‚Äîit‚Äôs a pretty solid bang for the buck. Over time, the larger volume translates to fewer repeat purchases and ensures that even the sporadic user gets long-term value from their investment.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of teak used, the design, and the construction techniques all play a critical role in determining a teak coffee table's overall value and longevity.

**Material Quality:** High-grade, sustainably sourced teak wood is essential for a durable and beautiful coffee table.

Teak wood is renowned for its natural oils and tight grain, which provide remarkable resistance to rot, decay, and insects. Grade A teak, harvested from the heartwood of mature trees, offers the highest oil content and the most consistent color. Sustainably sourced teak ensures responsible forestry practices and environmental preservation. Tables made with solid teak throughout, rather than using veneers or lower grades for internal components, offer superior durability and longevity.

**Design and Style:** Teak coffee tables come in a variety of designs, from modern minimalist to rustic customary, to suit different aesthetic preferences and living spaces.

Consider the overall style of your home and choose a coffee table that complements your existing furniture and d√©cor. Sleek, minimalist designs with clean lines work well in contemporary settings, while tables with intricate detailing and a more substantial presence are better suited for traditional or rustic interiors. The shape of the table, whether round, square, rectangular, or oval, should also be considered in relation to the size and layout of your room.**Construction Quality:** Solid joinery techniques, such as mortise-and-tenon or dovetail joints, ensure strength and stability.

The way a teak coffee table is constructed significantly impacts its durability and lifespan. Look for tables with robust frames and securely fastened components. Mortise-and-tenon joints, where one piece of wood is inserted into a precisely cut hole in another, are a hallmark of quality craftsmanship. Dovetail joints, with their interlocking wedge shapes, provide exceptional strength and resistance to pulling apart. Countersunk and plugged screws add further reinforcement while concealing the hardware for a clean, finished look.

**Weather Resistance:** Teak's natural properties make it highly resistant to outdoor elements, ideal for patios and decks.

Due to its high oil content, teak is naturally weather-resistant, making it an excellent choice for outdoor furniture.It can withstand exposure to rain, sun, and temperature fluctuations without warping, cracking, or splintering. However, regular cleaning and occasional oiling can help maintain its appearance and prevent the wood from developing a silvery-gray patina over time.Key features of modern teak coffee tables include:

*   Durable Construction
*   Weather Resistant Qualities
*   Classic appeal
*   Stain-resistant material

## Core Benefits

Teak coffee tables offer a unique blend of functionality, aesthetics, and long-term value that makes them a wise choice for discerning homeowners.

**Durability and Longevity:** Teak's natural resistance to decay and insects ensures a coffee table that will last for decades with proper care.

Compared to other wood types or synthetic materials, teak stands out for its exceptional durability. Its high oil content acts as a natural preservative, protecting the wood from the damaging effects of moisture, pests, and ultraviolet radiation. This means that a well-maintained teak coffee table can withstand years of use and exposure to the elements without showing signs of wear and tear.

**Aesthetic Appeal:** The warm, golden-brown tones and natural grain patterns of teak add a touch of elegance and sophistication to any space.

Teak wood is prized for its rich, natural beauty. Its warm,golden-brown color and distinctive grain patterns create a visually appealing piece of furniture that complements a wide range of interior and exterior styles.Whether you prefer a classic, traditional look or a more contemporary aesthetic, a teak coffee table can serve as a stylish focal point in your living room, patio, or deck. Over time,teak naturally weathers to a beautiful silvery-gray patina,adding character and charm.

**low Maintenance:** Unlike some materials, teak requires minimal upkeep to retain its beauty and structural integrity.

While teak is relatively low-maintenance, regular cleaning with mild soap and water can help prevent the buildup of dirt and grime. To maintain its original golden-brown color,teak oil can be applied periodically. Though, many people prefer the natural silvery-gray patina that develops as the wood ages. In either case, teak remains a practical and hassle-free choice for busy homeowners.

I‚Äôm not even sure I can explain this well or what I‚Äôm really looking for what I‚Äôm looking for, I guess I just don‚Äôt want to be alone.

Yesterday, I took a mini dose of mushrooms before hanging out with a friend and attending an event for my culture. I was raised in the US and haven‚Äôt really gotten to celebrate, be in, and share my culture with a friend since I was a kid. I‚Äôm always nervous to be in these spaces because I always feel too American to fully be part of it, like a watered down version of what I‚Äôm supposed to be. 

I am estranged from my family for the most part and over the last year have been working through deep family and personal traumas. We started the day just catching up while the event was getting set up, grabbed a coffee, I‚Äôd forgotten what it felt like to just talk openly with a friend. About things we‚Äôd each been working through, struggling with. How we‚Äôve navigated our families and needed to present in specific ways and be perfect, handle everything. 

We went to the event, ate foods from my culture, danced to live music. I translated for him, explained different elements of it. I was with and embraced by my culture and it felt like sharing a side of me everyone I know knows about, but has never really seen and embraced with me. 

Later, my friend suggested we smoke a joint, I agreed. We smoked and talked. About wanting more for ourselves. About needing to figure out what life looks like when you don‚Äôt conform to traditional expectations, getting married, having kids. Needing models of what that looks like and how to be happy. I confessed to him for the first time that I liked women. 

We wandered the grocery store after. As we walked through, I started spiraling. What did he think of me now? What did owning this mean about me, about my current relationship, what did admitting this and owning it with someone change? My partner and I are planning a move across the country at the end of September. Does it make me a bad person to continue to be in my relationship, to move across the country with this person when I‚Äôm healing and growing in a totally different direction? 

My mind was racing. And then we stopped in front of a display of spreads. My friend walked through every option, detailing what each experience would be like. Nothing had changed and the world hadn‚Äôt stopped spinning. I started to tear up as he went on. He asked if I was okay, I nodded, said yes. And next thing I knew I was having a full blown breakdown in the middle of the grocery store. 

I felt like I was dying. Like everything I‚Äôve ever thought might make me a bad person or was wrong with me was nothing. That none of it mattered. A whole world existed outside of living within other people‚Äôs expectations and what could it feel like to live freely as myself? That I could still be loved and accepted and the world wouldn‚Äôt end.  I sobbed and sobbed, repeating oh nos and oh my gods. I remember thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôll know this person forever, i‚Äôm so grateful he‚Äôs here‚Äù ‚Äúthis is what people write about when they talk about god, the divine.‚Äù This is what it is to be connected and seen.

After a while a worker came by asking if I was okay, offering napkins, offering to get help. I started laughing. Oh my god, I‚Äôm so sorry. This is so funny, she has no idea. This is crazy, she must think I‚Äôm crazy. Public breakdowns really happen to people. What the fuck. 

Explaining what happened to my friend afterward felt impossible. I told him I was really high, it was the first time I‚Äôd ever really talked about my sexuality with anyone. That I was spiraling and talking about the spreads just broke something in me. He understood, shared his first experience talking to anyone about his sexuality and identity. Afterwards, it felt like I could barely remember what happened when I broke down. Everything felt so clear in the moment, but so empty after. Now what? A subject change, a return to the event, the world keeps turning just like that. 

I‚Äôve hung out in queer spaces and participated in the community for so long, I think other people have known this about me before I‚Äôve been willing to see it for myself and name it. What does a label mean? Does it matter to label it? Is queer enough? 

I feel so terrified now. I‚Äôve cried all day, I feel like I‚Äôm dying. Who am I and where do I go from here? Was this ego death? What does it mean? Is it wrong to stay in my relationship? Is it wrong to make a big move together now, knowing what I know and admitting it? My partner has known since early on in our relationship that I like women too, but this feels bigger. I love him but it feels unfair to him. Would it feel like wearing clothes that don‚Äôt fit anymore and delaying the inevitable? I don‚Äôt want to hurt him. I don‚Äôt want to be a bad person. I don‚Äôt want to be alone.

1mtq0bk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1mtq0bk/uncover_if_the_best_electric_espresso_maker_by/,Uncover if the best electric espresso maker by Imusa lives up to the hype,"Testing out the Imusa Electric Espresso Maker in my own kitchen has been quite the adventure. From its sleek black exterior to its practical functions, the product seamlessly combines functionality with aesthetics. This little machine gives off such cool vibes that it already feels like a permanent fixture on my countertop. Designed to brew either three or six espresso-sized servings, it‚Äôs a dream come true for someone who drinks their weight in coffee‚Äîor at least their height in espresso shots. This isn‚Äôt just my opinion; my sister, who‚Äôs a bit of a coffee snob, actually nodded in approval when she tasted the Cuban coffee I whipped up the other day using this espresso maker. That says a lot.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The Imusa Electric Espresso Maker immediately caught my eye with its cast aluminum base and sleek black finish. Honestly, it has this charming vintage-meets-modern look. The detachable base and tinted carafe give off a vibe that‚Äôs equal parts retro and futuristic. It feels durable, yet light enough to move around, which is great since I tend to rearrange my counter often. The cool-touch handle is a genius addition because let's be real‚ÄîI‚Äôve burned my hand on my fair share of coffee gadgets in the past.

**Ease of Use and Convenience**  
What I love about this espresso maker is how user-friendly it is. The on/off switch and visual brewing indicator take the guesswork out of the process, making it incredibly simple for even the most sleep-deprived, early-morning version of myself to operate. The detachable base makes serving espresso a breeze, and cleanup is far from daunting. It's the kind of product that understands practicality, and I appreciate not needing a PhD in machinery to make a good cup of coffee.

**Advantages**  
While using this coffee maker repeatedly, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice a few important highlights:  
- Its brewing versatility lets you choose between 6 or 3 cups depending on your mood or crew size.  
- Safe features like the cool-touch handle and visual brewing indicator make it both functional and worry-free.  
- Compact yet stylish, it‚Äôs perfect for kitchens, offices, and even when you‚Äôre on the move.  
- The ability to create various coffee styles like Cuban coffee or Moka makes it stand out in terms of brewing options.  

**Drawbacks**  
No product is perfect, and some less favorable aspects came to light:  
- The brewing process, though effective, isn't exactly whisper-quiet‚Äîsomething to consider if you‚Äôre making coffee before dawn.  
- Pouring coffee from the carafe needs a bit of finesse; quick movements might result in spills.  
- While the detachable base is great, the cord length feels shorter than I‚Äôd like.  

**Diverse Brewing Applications**  
What impressed me most was the range of coffee styles this espresso maker can deliver. Ever since getting this machine, I‚Äôve experimented with traditional espresso, aromatic Italian coffee, and even attempted some Cuban recipes. Sitting in my living room sipping these creations, it felt like I had my own mini caf√© right at home. My coworker, who came over for lunch the other day, asked me about it after a strong Moka brew I served him. He was intrigued enough to note down the product's name‚Äîdefinitely proof of its charm.

**Competing Products**  
Stacking it up against similar kitchen coffee gadgets, the Imusa espresso maker brings strength in its simplicity and portability. Products like the Moka Express or even larger machines like a single-serve pod coffee maker don‚Äôt offer the same multi-cup brewing flexibility. While pod machines win in speed, they can‚Äôt match the flavor depth and customization this espresso maker provides. On the downside, fully automatic machines certainly outclass it in convenience but at a much steeper price and bulkier footprint. If you seek durability and character in your brewing ritual, this espresso maker earns major points.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Given its quality and features, this espresso maker offers a fantastic price-to-quality ratio. Sure, some higher-end models boast additional bells and whistles, but not everyone wants to drop a whole paycheck for their caffeine addiction. Its affordable quality makes it a strong contender in the vast coffee maker market. Plus, you‚Äôre getting versatility, good design, and safety features all wrapped into one, and it won‚Äôt force you to sacrifice half your kitchen counter space.

Batteries often feel like one of those background players in a car‚Äôs functionality‚Äîyou don‚Äôt notice them until they stop working. However, this particular battery doesn‚Äôt just work; it works extraordinarily well. As a reviewer with a knack for testing automotive accessories, I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from diving deep into what makes this battery stand out, and where it could improve. Buckle up, folks, because this isn‚Äôt just any car battery review.

**Design and Build Quality**  
What struck me first about this battery was its compact design. Sized perfectly at 9.53 x 6.89 x 7.48 inches, it‚Äôs quite versatile in fitting vehicles that match its BCI Group 47 (H5/L2) specifications. I made sure to compare the dimensions with my old battery before installation, and the fit was flawless. The sleek design with an SAE Terminal says a lot about how modern and efficient this unit is. At 40 pounds, it‚Äôs not exactly featherlight, but considering the performance it offers, it‚Äôs a small price to pay for durability and power. Speaking of which, installation was straightforward, even for someone as clumsy as me!  

**Performance Highlights**  
The performance stats don‚Äôt just promise big; they deliver. With 660 cold cranking amps (CCA), this battery confidently got my car fired up even on a snowy Chicago morning. I also tested it on our family SUV loaded with heated seats, navigation systems, and an entertainment setup, and it handled the additional electrical load like a champ. The deep-cycle capacity, paired with robust cranking power, means it doesn't just support short trips and stop-and-go traffic but excels at it. Honestly, I think it might have performed better than my coffee machine in the morning.  

**Check [UPLUS NEW TECHNOLOGY BATTERY AGM-L60-UP] price on Amazon.**

**Positives**  
There are quite a few winning points to highlight here.  
- It‚Äôs specifically designed for modern vehicles with stop-start systems, which was a huge plus for me since I live in a city with constant traffic.  
- Durability is another strength. The claim of being 15 times more vibration-resistant genuinely seems accurate based on my off-roading adventures last weekend.  
- Safety features, like the vent cap design that prevents acid leaks, give it an edge over several similar products I‚Äôve tested.  
- Backed by a three-year warranty and local after-sales support in California and Georgia, it provides peace of mind way beyond just the initial purchase.  

**Drawbacks**  
Even the best products have areas of concern.  
- Its weight, though manageable, could be an issue for someone who prefers lightweight options.  
- The price point leans towards the higher end of the spectrum, which might deter budget-conscious buyers.  
- While installation was simple for me, I can see how someone less experienced might find the process intimidating without a manual explicitly tailored for beginners.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this to other contenders in the market like the Optima RedTop or the Odyssey 34-PC1500T, the UPLUS model holds its own exceptionally well. The Optima is known for its faster recharge times, which is one edge it has, but it lacks the robust deep-cycle capacity that this one brings to the table. The Odyssey model, famous for its rugged design, comes close in terms of vibration resistance but falls short on safety features like the vent cap design. The UPLUS battery, balancing safety, power, and compatibility, felt like the most all-rounded option during my tests. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it certainly excels in areas crucial for modern drivers.  

**Quality for Price**  
Examining the value proposition, the UPLUS AGM-L60-UP piqued my interest, especially when weighing its features against the cost. Sure, it‚Äôs not the cheapest battery in town, but what you‚Äôre paying for is reliability. For something that boasts four times the cycling capacity of conventional batteries, you‚Äôre essentially ensuring fewer replacements down the line. When you factor in the cold-weather efficiency, vibration resistance, and deep cycle power, it does feel like it earns every penny of its price tag.

I haven't really thought about it much either until last week bc I was swamped with uni work, it's also not an important one, nor am I someone who celebrates big. The thing is though, I am a huge birthday person. I usually love my birthday, I love to celebrate with my friends and have a nice time, even if it's just small. I also love other peoples birthdays, I love giving gifts and thinking of a great present.

I usually don't celebrate big, first bc I'm a student and broke and second bc I don't want to annoy the people around me with a theme party or anything. Especially as my experience is that half the people don't turn un on theme. Which is kind of annoying as my maximum guest list is like 7 to 8 people, with less attending bc my brother and his gf live far away and are younger than me, so travelling is rarely doable for them. (He does come by as soon as it's possible though, he mostly just can't make it to the party).

Given that I almost forgot my birthday this year I was thinking about just going to a nice restaurant with my husband and two best friends. So today I texted them in our group chat asking if they wanted to join us to said restaurant on the first. The first answer I got back was ""what's happening that day? I mean, sure though"". That friend is kind of all over the place so I joked to my husband if I just shouldn't tell him or wait for my other bf to clap back at him, bc I was positive she knows what that day is. Well, she just texted that she has other plans that day but hopes we have fun. I don't know why but that kind of crushed me. Her birthday isn't too long after mine so we're usually quite in tune about celebrations.

Last year the both of them were planning a trip for this time of year, one that we had usually talked about going on all three of us together. They didn't ask me if I wanted to come and it would have been over my birthday as well. We did talk it out, they hadn't asked me because they knew I was having (still am) a hard time financially. Everything is fine now, the trip fell through anyway and now we were thinking of doing it next year. But still.

Not even my parents have asked if I had any particular wishes for my birthday this year or if I'm planning on coffee with family. It also doesn't help that I constantly get messages from my mum or bestie when it's somebody elses birthday to remind me of it (i had a bad mental health phase were I forgot a lot of birthdays and big events around me but I've been doing way better)

I know everything has been really hectic lately. I got married this summer, my grandparents had their 50th anniversary, my cousin had her communion, my mum is having her 50th bday right after mine, my best friends were as swamped with uni as I was, one of them just finished their degree and started their first real job basically last week.

I am still hurt, I feel like my birthday doesn't really matter and never really will. I would love to be petty, just cancel the dinner, not mention anything and see what will happen when the day comes around.

I also know that that's probably mostly my depression brain talking and it would neither be fair, nor very mature.

1mtpq1a,https://i.redd.it/aj3ijxystsjf1.png,Could Deadly Premonition have existed without Twin Peaks?,"The screenshot above is from the prototype ""Rainy Woods"" version that existed before I suppose it was changed to make Twin Peaks connections more legally safe.

Deadly Premonition is often called a ‚Äúlove letter‚Äù to Twin Peaks, and the similarities are so strong that many people see it as an unofficial video game adaptation of Lynch‚Äôs show. The show also had a very large following in Japan when it aired and even has its own coffee product commercial with Dale Cooper (Kyle Maclachlan). The game's creator Swery 65 has refused to give a definite answer to this but it's pretty obvious where the games ideas came from. Deadly Premonition 2 makes it less obvious and avoided making the choice of adapting the 2017 Return season to fit it's narrative even though some small similarities still exist.

Here‚Äôs why I think Swery 65 has to have been heavily inspired by Twin Peaks:

1. The Central Murder Mystery

Twin Peaks: The story kicks off with the murder of Laura Palmer, whose death exposes the dark underbelly of a seemingly quiet small town.

Deadly Premonition: The murder of Anna Graham fills the same role‚Äîher death reveals secrets in Greenvale and sets up the investigation.

2. The Quirky FBI Agent

Twin Peaks: Special Agent Dale Cooper is polite, eccentric, intuitive, and spiritually attuned, often talking into his recorder for ‚ÄúDiane.‚Äù He finds letters from a magazine under victims fingernails related to past cases.

Deadly Premonition: FBI Agent Francis York Morgan is eccentric in a similar way‚Äîhe talks constantly to his imaginary friend ‚ÄúZach,‚Äù has odd rituals, and balances detective brilliance with strange social quirks. He finds red seeds in victims bodies related to past cases.

3. The Small-Town Setting

Twin Peaks: The town is cozy, full of diners, logging industries, quirky locals, and a looming forest. Sitting on the border between the US and Canada.

Deadly Premonition: Greenvale feels like a digital Twin Peaks‚Äîrural town, diner culture, sawmill, quirky townsfolk, and ominous woods. Sitting on the border between US and Canada.

4. The Strange Locals

Twin Peaks: The Log Lady, Nadine, Audrey, Bobby, and dozens more‚Äîeach exaggerated, weird, and endearing in their own way.

Deadly Premonition: Every NPC has quirks, like the Pot Lady, eccentric gas station attendant or Harry Stewart speaking through a gas mask. Like Twin Peaks, the townsfolk feel like they‚Äôre hiding secrets beneath their odd behavior.

5. Supernatural Elements

Twin Peaks: The Black Lodge, the Red Room, BOB, and dream visions turn the murder mystery into something otherworldly.

Deadly Premonition: York experiences visions, strange apparitions, and encounters with supernatural forces (the Raincoat Killer, shadow people). Reality and dreamlike states blend together.

6. The Tone (Comedy ‚Üî Horror ‚Üî Tragedy)

Twin Peaks: One minute you‚Äôre laughing at Andy or Lucy, the next you‚Äôre terrified by BOB, and then grieving Laura‚Äôs death.

Deadly Premonition: Similarly swings from campy humor and bizarre dialogue to unsettling horror sequences and tragic revelations.

7. Food, Routines, and Mundane Life

Twin Peaks: Coffee, cherry pie, donuts, and everyday rituals ground the surreal story in the ordinary.

Deadly Premonition: Coffee literally gives York ‚Äúvisions,‚Äù and mundane activities (eating, shaving, driving) are baked into the gameplay, grounding the surreal mystery. The Sinners Sandwich even takes the place of Norma's Cherry Pie.

8. Dual Realities

Twin Peaks: The ordinary world of Twin Peaks coexists with the supernatural Black Lodge.

Deadly Premonition: Greenvale has its own ‚ÄúOther World‚Äù sequences where reality twists into a nightmarish mirror of itself.

I could probably find other connections, but this is what I had so far. So what do you think, it really seems to me that it's unlikely Deadly Premonition or Mizzurna Falls for that matter could exist without Twin Peaks.",1,1755531950.0,DeadlyPremonition,1,1.0,False

1mtppcr,https://i.redd.it/mdz7xaintsjf1.jpeg,My Artisan lineup‚Ä¶ So far!,"Absolutely loving my pads. So I thought I‚Äôd whip up a quick review!

With the end goal looking to give others some  insight. As well as receive recommendations on my next artisan purchase.*

All pads are reviewed using a (small) Finalmouse ULX with CorePad Air 607 Skates
(Stock FM skates were great for a stock skate! However a different experience entirely.)

(My CS sense: 800DPI 0.77 2K Polling)

SOFT | Hayate Otsu V1 (Wine Red)

‚Ä¢ Absolutely love the texture. Could be described as denim feeling? (Paired with the Air 607 skates. Initially I was shocked at how scratchy, and loud mouse movement was. However once locked into a game, that was no longer an issue. and now currently, is my main pad.

‚Ä¢ Humidity fluctuations barely, if at all, affect this pad. (V2 I assume is even better for this)

‚Ä¢ A very interesting pad, paired with being prone to humidity, and with the particular weave structure it has, makes for a fantastic experience I‚Äôve really enjoyed. (On finger press, the Hayate Otsu feels softer than the Type99)

RATING: 9/10* Not giving 10 because I want another artisan pad :)


SOFT | Type99 (Matcha Green)

‚Ä¢ Again, incredible quality, really shining in the type99. A premium, consistent, cloth feel, super smooth mouse movement. Slightly more feedback than the Radien, however much, much less than the Hayate Otsu. (This used to be my main pad using a GPW with glass skates)  

‚Ä¢ If this pad arrived with a softness label showing ‚Äúmid‚Äù I‚Äôd believe it. The soft Type99 is surprisingly hard on push down. Understandable, due to it being so consistent with mouse movements.
No BS just quality consistency and control. 

‚Ä¢ The only dislike I have with the Type99 is the friendship between skin, and its surface. 
Even with a sleeve. Any contact with the pad is noticeable. Makes me feel like I need to lift my arm to move my mouse at the speed that I usually would on another pad.

RATING: 7/10* Purely losing points due to skin and or sleeve contact issues

XSOFT | Radien (Coffee Brown) 

‚Ä¢ Out of the box I remember being extremely impressed, tightest most gorgeous weave. Silky almost shiny. Beautiful actually! (I wanted to baby this pad, however it was my first pad and has been heavily used)

‚Ä¢ Ultra speedy for cloth, However now, months after use and being effected by humidity. It‚Äôs more of a mud pad, however still enjoyable. (Still fast‚Ä¶ but In comparison to brand new, it is quite different)

‚Ä¢ Going XSoft on this pick was a mistake, it‚Äôs incredibly soft. Comically soft on finger press. It would be impossible to use dot skates, bottom out would be inevitable. 
Borderline in-game holding down mouse1 pressure is enough to push down into the pad. 
Could be good for some, however was an issue for me personally.
(My current mousepad for when I‚Äôm not gaming lol) 

RATING: 7/10* loosing points due to my softness pick, and being majorly affected by humidity.


MY POTENTIAL NEXT BUYS
‚Ä¢ MID Key 83 
‚Ä¢ MID/SOFT Hien
‚Ä¢ MID Radien 
‚Ä¢ MID Hayate Otsu V2

Please let me know your thoughts for my next purchase! Apologies for the layout of this post. 
Posted from my iPhone. 
Thanks!

We bought a unit from KitchenAid Canada and used it daily for regular coffees - usually 4 double cup brews a day - about 64oz in total.  After about 6 weeks - half way through the second cleaning cycle, the machine stopped putting coffee in to the cups, instead sending it into the drip tray from somewhere inside the machine.  Problem was accompanied by mechanical noises that suggested something was straining to move properly.

Tried cleaning and descaling, no change in what happened.  If you left it off for a day then the first time it would run afterwards would be fine,after that, same thing.

Contacted KtchenAid Canada and they shipped a new one to us and we sent the old one back.  But now, the new one is doing the self same thing after pretty much the same period of time.  Going through a clean cycle as I write this, but not expecting anything to change.

Struggling to believe that I am this unlucky, so thinking that there may be a design flaw or problem with a particular manufacturing run.  Anyone have any similar experiences?",1,1755531892.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

1mtpmed,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTechTakes/comments/1mtpmed/reveal_the_best_mini_pc_for_power_users_is_gmktec/,Reveal the Best Mini PC for Power Users Is GMKtec G3 Plus Worth It,"Testing out the GMKtec G3 Plus mini PC was an exciting experience for someone like me, a tech enthusiast constantly in search of practical yet high-performing devices. I must admit, I had my reservations about this little machine, considering how compact it is, but after weeks of daily use, it proved me wrong on multiple fronts.

**Compact Yet Efficient Design**  
The first thing you notice about this mini desktop is its small size ‚Äì it‚Äôs almost too sleek to believe it packs so much power. Measuring just 4.48 x 4.17 x 1.67 inches and weighing 2.01 pounds, it fits on my crowded desk with ease and even leaves space for my coffee cup (a crucial factor). While the minimalist black finish does not scream flashy, it subtly blends into any setup. I appreciated how the device stayed cool even during extended sessions due to its smart heat dissipation design. However, the compact nature left me wondering whether it might compromise its expandability compared to larger PCs.  

**Performance That Surprises**  
With the 3.6 GHz Intel Twin Lake N150 processor under the hood, routine tasks like word processing, video conferencing, and even light photo editing run smoother than I expected. Paired with 16GB of DDR4 RAM, it handles multitasking pretty efficiently without any noticeable slowdown. On certain days, I‚Äôve had Adobe Photoshop open alongside ten browser tabs, Spotify, and Zoom, and this small computer barely flinched. As someone who often compares specs, I‚Äôd say the Intel N150 is a worthy upgrade over previous N100 and N95 processors, delivering a 10-15% performance bump that‚Äôs clear in real-world usage.  

[Check GMKtec G3 Plus price on Amazon.](https://preciseshop.com/p/b0cq4c9zy1/)  

**Storage and Speed**  
What really impresses me is the 1TB PCIe M.2 NVMe SSD. Booting up takes only a handful of seconds, and file transfers are shockingly quick. Unlike traditional hard drives or even older SATA SSDs, this storage setup lets me load hefty files without delays. It's great for someone like me who often works on editing software and needs ample space for temporary and permanent files. However, if you regularly deal with storage-heavy applications, double-check that the 1TB is sufficient for your needs long-term.  

**Good Aspects**  
- Compact design that doesn‚Äôt sacrifice performance.  
- 4K video output on dual HDMI 2.0 ports makes multitasking seamless.  
- WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 provide modern connectivity for peripherals.  
- Pre-installed 16GB RAM and lightning-fast PCIe storage.  
- Intel N150 processor is punchy for light-to-medium workloads.

**Connectivity Options for Everyone**  
As someone who demands versatile connectivity options, this small computer didn‚Äôt fall short. The four USB 3.2 ports truly shine for basics like a keyboard, mouse, and external hard drives. Meanwhile, Bluetooth 5.2 enabled me to add wireless headphones without the frustration of dropped connections. Ethernet fans, you‚Äôll be pleased with the 2.5GbE connectivity. Streaming 4K movies and even remote team collaborations felt flawless on this system.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Limited processor power handles light to moderate loads well but may struggle with heavier tasks like gaming or video rendering.  
- Lack of upgradability could be a deal-breaker for advanced users who prefer tweaking hardware.  
- Fan noise is negligible, but during demanding tasks, you might notice a faint hum.  

**Dazzling 4K Display Output**  
One area where this mini PC truly punches above its weight is its 4K capabilities. Dual HDMI ports let me connect an external monitor and my TV simultaneously. I even made it my go-to movie streaming device for the bedroom because, despite its size, it handles ultra-HD playback effortlessly. Gaming-wise, it runs older or casual games adequately but lags slightly when handling graphics-heavy titles‚Äîunderstandable, given its integrated Intel GPU.

**Market Rivals**  
When stacked against similar mini PCs, the GMKtec G3 Plus sits at an intriguing spot. Competing options like the Intel NUC line or Beelink devices come with slightly higher price tags for comparable specifications. Yet, for users focused on cost-effectiveness and needing speedy office performance, this model holds its ground. While the Intel NUCs might steal the spotlight in advanced gaming or raw processing power, this product is far better suited for casual users who prioritize modern features like WiFi 6 and 4K display.

**True Value**  
Talking about value, it's hard to ignore what you‚Äôre getting at this price point with GMKtec's offering. For an everyday desktop replacement, it combines affordability with quality in a way that feels less like a compromise and more like a smart investment. Think of it as a premium option for students, remote workers, or anyone with modest computing needs.

I also do om namah shivaya meditation and concentrate on my third eye...what technique should I use? 


> my kundalini surged when I left alot of my bad habits and I have always thought that I should leave alot more, like quiting sugar, coffee, tea..im already on omad..is it too early to quit or shall I just listen to my instinct.


> There is something I found through pure accident, i have kept lot of negative feelings and grudges..like a vessel and in one of my sessions I forgave a person and I physically felt energy leaving me..its like a near fainting experience..usually after which i cant continue meditating, i dont know what to call it...but i do feel better and I tried to re think these grudges and memories, i also have started forgiving myself in the same way and I could find that I had no ill feelings like I had suddenly moved on..its a good feeling but is this the correct way..am I loosing kundalini energy?


> I distrust people and am very anti social, should I really find a guru ? Or can I continue this journey as solo traveler.


> can I use this energy  to be successful in life or to be happy about myself..to move past my trauma? Or would it be selfish to use kundalini for such personal stuff??",1,1755531631.0,kundalini,0,1.0,False

I matched with this guy in mid-February? March?, Let's call him J. So J and I had this VERY LONG talking stage because when he was planning for a date, I had sem exams, and when I asked him out, he had family problems. Hence, he couldn't, and then comes a time where in April that we both thought this is high time for a date, it is so due (mind you guys, this is my FIRST EVER DATE) so I naturally didn't know what to do and how to plan it or what should happen in the process while planning it. J asked me what kind of places I liked, and I told him I like museums, art galleries, and any historic places. Then J continued to say to me that he was thinking of a cafe date, and I was pretty against a cafe date because I didn't want to sit in one place and have a conversation like we are interviewing each other or something (idk that is how I thought dates like those would be) and let me tell you he was pretty against the idea of not going on a cafe date and then somehow he settled to go on a museum date (this was our conversation one week before the date) and then on the day of the date he texted me asking which time do I want us to go on a date (I thought to myself very practically, travelling to the museum is a big task and it will take a while and I want to be able to spend nice time too and then returning would be even tough because of the traffic) and I told him we can start at 10 am and then reach by 11 am or something. J goes ""10 AM? why that early I want to go to gym"" so I told him to decide and he picks the most unusual time, he says, 1 pm okay?' and I just played along and then we met at a coffee shop near by because it was better to travel together than reach there alone.

After reaching the cafe and an awkward handshake that was almost a fist bump, he asked me where we were going, and I was taken aback. I asked him if we were not going to a museum? And he said, ""That is too far, I need to go back home early."" I then continued to call him out for changing the plan again, and then he hesitantly agreed again. While travelling, I wanted to escape and go back home as soon as possible, but I was optimistic that the museum would be open and we would have a nice time. To my bad luck, the museum was closed that day. UGHHH! Then he booked a cab to go to the nearest mall, and that is when we looked at each other and had a laugh about what just happened. We went to the mall and saw a poster of an upcoming movie, and I showed him that telling how much I love the actor and how none of my friends wanted to go to that movie with me, so I might end up going alone. He then said that he will tag along if no one goes with me. Then we go eat and return home (almost kissed but I am SOOOO glad we didn't cause thinking about it makes me wanna puke rn.)

What was funny is that on the way back home, he fell off in the middle cause he wanted to meet his friends (didn't he have to reach home early?? it was 8 pm btw) and told me to call him once I reached home. I called him once I reached, and right after I said that, he cut the call. OH, I JUST KNEW HE WAS DONE. The next day, he didn't text. The day after, he texts me and gives the driest single line text ever, ""Sorry, didn't text."" and I said, ""Oh, don't bother, taking long enough is just the perfect answer I need."" He didn't reply, and then a few days later, he removed me from Instagram and Hinge.

Start by taking a good look at the space. Know where the light comes in, the main walkways, and where you naturally want your seating area to be.

¬†A quick floor plan sketch can help you see what will fit without guesswork.

**2. Choose a Focal Point**

Choose a main feature for your living room, a fireplace, a big window, a TV wall, or a standout piece of art.

Arranging your main furniture around this point creates a natural flow.

**3. Select the Sofa First**

The sofa is the heart of the living room. Choose one that fits your space and matches your lifestyle.

A neutral base gives you flexibility, and you can bring colour and personality in with smaller accents later.

**4. Ground the Space with a Rug**

A rug ties your seating together. Make sure it‚Äôs big enough so that at least the front legs of your sofa and chairs rest on it. This instantly makes the room look more inviting.

**5. Layer the Lighting**

Use more than one light source. Combine overhead lighting with a floor lamp or table lamps to create a warm, welcoming ambiance.

¬†Place lamps where they‚Äôll be most useful, like next to a reading chair or beside the sofa.

**6. Add a Coffee Table That Fits the Space**

Your coffee table should be proportionate to your sofa and allow enough room to walk around comfortably. It‚Äôs a practical spot for drinks, books, and d√©cor,¬† and can also serve as a style statement.

**7. Include Storage Solutions**

Even in a living room, storage matters. Think about a TV unit with cabinets, baskets for throws, or a sideboard for games and books. This keeps the room tidy without losing charm.

**8. Bring in Your Personality**

Now layer in cushions, throws, art, and plants. Mix textures and colours to add depth.

Include a few personal pieces, a framed photo, and a travel memento to make the room feel truly yours.

**9. Step Back and Adjust**

Once everything‚Äôs in place, take a step back and see how it feels. Is there enough space to move around? Does the room feel balanced? A few tricks can make a big difference.

Host of Tier Talk



There are a handful of people in this profession who, when they speak, you stop what you're doing and listen. Not because they demand your attention--but because they've earned it. Russ Hamilton is one of those people.



I've had the privilege of working with Russ for many years. As my cohost on Tier Talk, he's not only helped guide conversations that push this profession forward--he's modeled exactly what it means to be a grounded, committed, and humble leader. But beyond the mic and the screen, Russ has lived a life in uniform. He's been in the housing units, the towers, the command posts. He's made the calls others were afraid to make. And he's made mistakes he's owned--not to shame himself, but to sharpen others.

That's what makes this book different. This isn't just another book written *about* corrections. This is a book *from* corrections--written by someone who has walked the walk and still carries the weight of the profession in his bones.

Complacency is one of the most dangerous and least-discussed threats in our facilities today. It doesn't come crashing through the door. It slips through the cracks. It builds quietly. It feeds off false confidence, unchecked routine, and a culture that sometimes mistakes longevity for immunity. Russ has always had the courage to call that out--not to criticize the profession, but to protect it.

When we talk about officer safety, we often focus on the big things: inmate violence, equipment readiness, emergency procedures. But Russ knows what too many have learned too late--that it's the small things that get you. The corner you cut. The assumption you make. The door you didn't double check. Complacency is the slow erosion of awareness, and if left unchecked, it becomes the gateway to tragedy.

Russ is the right person to write this book not only because of what he knows, but because of how he knows it. Through experience. Through loss. Through close calls. Through conversations with men and women who've been there--and those who didn't make it out. His voice doesn't come from ego or fear. It comes from care. And it comes from a place of deep responsibility.

Our partnership on Tier Talk has been one of the most meaningful collaborations of my career. Russ is more than a colleague--he's a friend, a brother in the profession, and someone I trust implicitly. We've spent countless hours unpacking the toughest topics in corrections, but this one--complacency--has always struck a deeper chord with him. I've seen the fire in his eyes when this subject comes up. I've heard the stories he's carried with him. And I know, without a doubt, that this book is something he had to write.

To every officer, supervisor, administrator, and trainer: this book is a tool, but it's also a warning. It's a wake-up call written with compassion. It's meant to shake you--not to scare you, but to bring you back to awareness. Russ is not here to preach. He's here to remind. And in this profession, reminders like these are what keep us alive.

Russ, thank you--for your leadership, your loyalty, and your unshakable commitment to protecting the men and women who serve behind the wall. Your words carry weight because they come from a place of truth--and because you've never stopped caring.

This is the book we needed. And you're the one who needed to write it.

**Prologue**



This is the book I waited my entire career to read--a guide to staying safer, securing institutions, protecting the public, and making it home every night. A book to sharpen critical thinking, spur decisive action, and arm me with insider knowledge to outsmart the chaos of corrections. It didn't exist, so after thirty-plus years in prisons and jails, I retired, reflected, and wrote it myself. Now it's yours to do with as you will.



My journey began in 1989 with the California Department of Corrections. Fresh from the Richard A. McGee Training Center in Galt, I landed at San Quentin State Prison, starting on Condemned Row, AKA Death Row. The prior 6 weeks of physical fitness, chemical agents, use-of-force instruction, and defensive tactics, was not enough preparation for what we walked into. But more on that in a bit.

Over decades, I transferred, promoted, retired, returned as a retired annuitant, served as a Senior Juvenile Correctional Officer, retired again, and later worked in reentry and rehabilitation for a private company at a county jail and probation department. I witnessed the raw brutality of riots, stabbings, shootings, and escape attempts. I saw gang warfare's toll, the havoc of unchecked contraband, and inmates' ingenuity in crafting weapons, tools, and escape gear. Each incident revealed failure--individual, institutional, or political. Within those failures, a seed took root: the idea for this book, born from the belief that understanding and combating complacency could save lives.

Through my work with Tier Talk and founder Anthony Gangi, I found my voice and sharpened my thinking about corrections' deadliest enemy: complacency. Complacency was often blamed for incidents, but rarely dissected. Two words struck me: insidious and pernicious--gradual, subtle, yet harmful. Corrections though demanded a sharper definition. After years of reflection, I defined complacency as: *""situational awareness perceived, but not achieved.""*

Articles weren't enough; this topic required a dedicated manuscript, a blueprint of tactics, strategies, and mindsets to combat complacency in officers, facilities, and systems. Part One identifies complacency's root causes. Part Two offers mitigation strategies. Part Three dissects real-world critical incidents, inviting you to analyze causes and solutions. Each chapter includes Field Training Officer (FTO) guides with discussion and training points to spark dialogue and enhance practical application.

Complacency's cost is measured in blood, failure, and regret. This book is my effort to spare you that price. Use it to stay sharp, stay safe, and make it home.



**Chapter 1**

*The Complacency of Routine*





**Introduction**



*""Complacency is situational awareness, perceived, but not achieved.""*



\--Sgt. Russ Hamilton CDCR ret. 2018

Complacency is the quiet killer in corrections. It doesn't show up with sirens or alarms--it creeps in through repetition. It hides behind the phrase ""this is how we've always done it."" It disguises itself as comfort, then turns that comfort into vulnerability.

In this chapter, we're not just going to define complacency. We're going to dismantle it--break it down, call it out, and show you how to defeat it. Because in our line of work, the price of letting your guard down is paid in blood, failure, and regret.



**The Evolution of Awareness**



When we first start working in a correctional facility, everything is new. Every door, every alarm, every sound triggers attention. That's a rookie's hyper-vigilance. But over time, familiarity breeds assumptions. We rely on patterns rather than perception. We stop seeing with fresh eyes and start functioning on autopilot. That's where complacency sets in.



Routine is not the enemy. In fact, routine is vital to a well-run institution. It provides structure, predictability, and efficiency. But when routine becomes a substitute for thought--when we stop asking why, stop noticing changes, stop challenging what we ""know""--it becomes dangerous.

Imagine walking the same tier--a floor of cells in a prison block--every day. You nod at the same inmates, glance at the same cells, hear the same noises. But one day, something's off. A blanket is hung where it shouldn't be. A mirror is positioned slightly differently. You miss it because routine tells you everything is fine. But that blanket is concealing a weapon. That mirror is tracking your movements. Complacency lets it happen. Perhaps today the problem will not manifest itself; the complacency grows but the countdown continues toward the inevitable.



**Maintaining Intentional Awareness**



The challenge is this: how do we stay alert in a world of repetition? The answer is intentional awareness. We must make a conscious decision each shift to remain engaged. That means practicing the ""what if"" exercise, in order to mentally test scenarios. That means reviewing incidents and asking, ""Could this happen here? Could it happen now? Could it happen to me?""



Supervisors must foster a culture that encourages critical thinking. They must challenge their staff, not punish them for questioning the status quo. Peer accountability must be real, not punitive and not unaccountable. We must be willing to say to each other, ""Did you notice that? Are you sure that's normal?""



**Confronting Dangerous Myths**



We must also confront the myths we tell ourselves. ""I've been doing this for 20 years"" is not a shield against danger. ""Nothing ever happens here"" is not a strategy. Longevity and safety do not always correlate. In fact, the longer you do the job, the more vulnerable you may become--not because you lack skill, but because you rely on experience instead of awareness.



Every major incident has a backstory of missed cues, ignored red flags, and assumptions. We ask, ""How did they not see it coming?"" The answer is often routine.



**Resetting the Mindset**



To defeat complacency, we must reset our mindset. Each day must begin with the idea that today could be the day--the fight could happen, the escape could be attempted, or the trap could be set. This is not paranoia. It's professionalism.



Complacency is not just a lack of attention. It's a belief--a quiet, dangerous belief that you know what's coming next. But in corrections, nothing is promised. Your best defense is awareness. Your best weapon is vigilance. Your best habit is humility.

I've spent more than three decades in corrections. I started at San Quentin State Prison in 1989 and have seen firsthand how complacency infects every level of our profession. This book is a warning, a reflection, and a guide. It's built from blood, sweat, mistakes, and survival. If one chapter prevents a tragedy, its job is done.



**The Shadow of Black August**



One event that deeply impacted me early in my career was the story of Black August, perhaps the most infamous incident in American correctional history--a deadly escape attempt at San Quentin on August 21, 1971, that exposed the dangers of complacency.



In June 1989, I was thrilled to be selected for the Richard A. McGee Correctional Training Facility in Galt, California, and chose San Quentin as my institution. Around that time, I ran into two brothers, former coworkers from a construction company where I'd worked. When I shared my excitement about my new career, their faces changed. They revealed their father, a San Quentin sergeant, was killed in the line of duty--shot in the head during the Black August escape attempt. That encounter drove home the seriousness of my chosen path and the ever-present risk of complacency.

Years later, after retiring and providing content for Tier Talk, a corrections training platform hosted by Anthony Gangi, I interviewed Richard (Dick) Nelson, a former San Quentin Associate Warden, I had indirectly worked for. Dick was writing *Into Harm's Way: My Life in Corrections--and the Historic Riot That Nearly Ended It*, about the Black August riot/escape attempt. The interview was powerful but somber, marked by the loss of Sergeant Jere Graham, Officer Paul Krasenes, and Officer Frank DeLeon, who gave their lives that day. Dick, a hero for retaking the Adjustment Center--a high-security unit--and preventing further bloodshed, told the incredible story of the incident to me and I was able to record it for posterity.

Dick did not mention one particular, critical detail during that recording: on August 1, 1971, a child visiting an inmate was found with a fake gun strapped to his ankle. Only after his book was published did I find this out. That incident went unreported. This lapse meant this event was never reported up the chain of command. Only after the August 21 riot/escape attempt, did it come to light. Had it been addressed, heightened security might have stopped an inmate's attorney from smuggling a real gun later that month, potentially preventing the tragedy.

I omit the perpetrators' names to focus on the heroism of those who served, pouring out the full measure of sacrifice and the insidious nature of complacency, which this book aims to combat.



**Thrown Into the Fire: Lessons from Week One**



As I mentioned earlier, I started my career in corrections in 1989 at San Quentin State Prison. Nothing I experienced during the academy could have prepared me for what was waiting that first week. This wasn't easing into the job--this was trial by fire. What follows are three moments that taught me more about awareness, danger, and complacency than any textbook ever could. These defining moments, happened week one of my career.





**Day One: The Coffee and Vigilance**

It was Monday morning, the start of our on-the-job training. We had just finished six weeks at the academy, and now we stood at the gates of San Quentin, eager and unsure. The plan was classroom training and orientation, but that changed fast. An emergency search operation had been ordered, and we were told to report to East Block. This information had been delivered to us by an imposing hulk of a sergeant named McGriff.

When we arrived, the unit was buzzing. An inmate had handed a cup of coffee to an officer, asking him to pass it to another inmate in another cell. But the officer, before passing the item, exercised some due diligence. He poured the coffee into another cup--and at the bottom was a small, melted piece of plastic. Following his instincts, he cuffed the inmates involved and began a search.

They found seven homemade metal shanks hidden inside one security light--seven more in another. The plastic piece fit the security screws of the lights perfectly--it had been used to pry them open. The weapons weren't meant for the yard; they'd never pass the metal detectors. These were meant for us--maybe a unit takeover, maybe worse. But none of it happened. That officer's refusal to be complacent likely saved lives.



**First Shift: The Smile of a Killer**

My first real shift was on the sixth tier in North Block, an isolated death row section with no access from other tiers. I was the tier gunner, stationed outside the cells with a mesh barrier and pistol ports every few feet to shoot the inmates if need be. I didn't know much about the inmates, only that this was Condemned Row, and I was there to watch over any officer that was on the other side of that mesh.

It was quiet that night. No one was out. A sergeant was speaking with an inmate--calm, conversational. The sergeant stood just outside the inmate's cell with me in an advantageous position if heaven forbid the inmate got out somehow. I listened as the inmate talked about helping people, pulling over and changing tires for stranded motorists. Claiming he was the kind of guy who'd go out of his way to lend a hand. He seemed decent--polite, soft-spoken. The sergeant spoke with him for nearly half an hour.

When it was done, he walked back and motioned for me to follow. As we neared the front of the tier he leaned in against the mesh and said ""You remember what that inmate was telling me? About being helpful? Friendly guy, right?"" I nodded. He looked me square in the eye. ""That man kidnapped two boys,"" he said. ""Took them into the woods. Shot them both in the head. Then he sat down and ate the hamburgers they had with them. After that, he took their car and robbed a bank in San Diego. These guys will tell you anything. They'll smile, pretend they're saints, but they'll kill you without blinking. Don't ever forget it.""

That Inmate, Robert Alton Harris was executed a few short years later. That moment hit me--this wasn't just a job. This was real, the stakes were high. The wrong situation could cost me my life if I ever let my guard down.



**Double Shift: The Inmate Who Trained Me**

Immediately after that shift, I got drafted for a second one--back-to-back of 16 hours. This time, I was assigned to the fourth tier of East Block, Bay Side, another part of Condemned Row. I showed up early, ready to get the rundown from the officer I was relieving. But when he saw me, he didn't say a word. He dropped the gear, the baton, the keys and walked away. No instructions. No handoff. Nothing.

I stood there, put on my gear but was totally unsure of what to do. Then an inmate called out to me--said he'd tell me what came next. I listened. He walked me through the routine: cuff him up, take him to the shower, move the phone, repeat on the other side. I called the sergeant to confirm. ""Yeah, that sounds right,"" he said. ""Just make sure you cuff them up and stay safe."" That was it. My entire orientation for that shift came from a condemned inmate. That showed me how broken the shift-exchange was--and how quickly staff complacency can endanger others and the ridiculousness of the sink or swim model of training.



**Normalcy Bias**



Something similar to the complacency of routine and closely related which can also contribute to complacency is normalcy bias.





**Normalcy Bias: The Dangerous Assumption That Nothing Will Change**

Normalcy bias represents one of the most pervasive and dangerous cognitive traps humans face when confronting potential crises. This psychological phenomenon occurs when individuals underestimate both the likelihood and severity of threatening situations, operating under the assumption that life will continue as it always has. Rather than acknowledging warning signs and taking appropriate action, those affected by normalcy bias tend to dismiss, minimize, or completely ignore indicators of impending danger.

The roots of normalcy bias lie deep within human psychology. Our brains are naturally wired to seek patterns and maintain stability in our understanding of the world. When faced with information that challenges our established sense of normalcy, we often experience cognitive dissonance, the uncomfortable mental state that occurs when new information conflicts with existing beliefs. To resolve this discomfort, many people choose the path of least resistance: dismissing the threatening information rather than adjusting their worldview.

This bias manifests in several distinct ways. First, there's the tendency to interpret ambiguous warning signs in the most benign possible light. Second, people often engage in social proof-seeking, looking to others' behavior to validate their own inaction. If others aren't responding to a threat, it must not be serious. Third, there's frequently an overreliance on past experience, with individuals assuming that because previous similar situations resolved without significant consequences, current threats will follow the same pattern.

The consequences of normalcy bias can range from minor inconveniences to catastrophic loss of life. When individuals fail to prepare for or respond appropriately to genuine threats, they not only endanger themselves but often create cascading effects that impact entire communities or organizations. Throughout history, normalcy bias has contributed to some of humanity's most devastating disasters. These examples serve as sobering reminders of what can happen when warning signs are ignored and the status quo is assumed to continue indefinitely.



**Hurricane Katrina (2005)**

The destruction of New Orleans stands as perhaps the most well-documented case of normalcy bias in recent American history. Despite clear evacuation orders and mounting evidence of the storm's severity, thousands of residents chose to remain in their homes. Many had weathered previous hurricanes with minimal damage and couldn't conceive that this storm would be fundamentally different. The assumption that levees would hold, that the storm would weaken, and that life would quickly return to normal proved tragically wrong. The resulting flooding trapped thousands of people, leading to over 1,800 deaths and displacing hundreds of thousands more.



**The Titanic Disaster (1912)**

The sinking of the Titanic remains one of history's most powerful illustrations of how normalcy bias can override even the most obvious danger signals. When the ship struck an iceberg, many passengers and crew members initially dismissed the severity of the situation. The ship had been marketed as ""unsinkable,"" and this belief became so ingrained that even as the vessel began listing, many people refused to believe they were in mortal danger. Passengers famously hesitated to board lifeboats, assuming the situation would resolve itself. This delay, in recognizing and responding to the crisis, contributed significantly to the massive loss of life.



**The 2008 Financial Crisis**

In the years leading up to the global financial meltdown, numerous warning signs indicated serious problems in the housing market and broader financial system. However, normalcy bias led many investors, financial institutions, and even regulatory agencies to dismiss these concerns. The prevailing assumption was that housing prices would continue to rise indefinitely and that sophisticated financial instruments had eliminated traditional risks. This collective failure to acknowledge mounting evidence of systemic problems allowed the crisis to build to catastrophic proportions, ultimately requiring massive government interventions and causing worldwide economic hardship.



**Normalcy Bias in Correctional Settings**

The closed, controlled environment of correctional facilities creates unique conditions where normalcy bias can flourish with particularly dangerous consequences. The routine nature of institutional life, combined with the constant low-level tensions inherent in these settings, can desensitize staff to genuine warning signs of serious problems.



***Escalating Inmate Tensions***

Correctional officers develop an intuitive sense for the daily rhythms and conflicts within their facilities. This experience, while valuable, can sometimes work against them when truly dangerous situations begin to develop. Officers may dismiss escalating tensions between inmates or groups as typical institutional drama, assuming these conflicts will resolve naturally as they have countless times before. This normalization of conflict can blind staff to situations that are genuinely different and potentially explosive. The failure to recognize and respond to unusual patterns of behavior, changes in alliance structures, or shifts in institutional dynamics can lead to serious violence.



***Contraband Detection and Prevention***

The ongoing battle against contraband in correctional facilities often falls victim to normalcy bias in subtle but significant ways. Staff members may become comfortable with their existing security procedures, assuming that routine searches and standard protocols are sufficient to prevent smuggling operations. This confidence can lead to a dangerous complacency where officers fail to adapt their strategies to evolving smuggling techniques or miss signs that their security measures have been compromised. The assumption that current procedures are working effectively can persist even as contraband networks grow more sophisticated.



***Emergency Preparedness and Response***

Correctional facilities face unique challenges during natural disasters and other emergencies, as they cannot simply evacuate like other institutions. This constraint can contribute to normalcy bias among administrators who may assume their facilities can weather any crisis. The reluctance to acknowledge the full scope of potential threats can lead to inadequate preparation, delayed decision-making during actual emergencies, and dangerous situations where both staff and inmates are put at unnecessary risk.



***Health Crisis Management***

The concentrated population and controlled environment of correctional facilities create conditions where infectious diseases and other health emergencies can spread rapidly. However, normalcy bias can cause medical staff and administrators to underestimate the severity of health threats, particularly in their early stages. The tendency to assume that standard medical protocols will be sufficient, or that symptoms reported by inmates are exaggerated or malingered, can delay critical interventions and allow health crises to escalate beyond control.



**Overcoming Normalcy Bias**

Recognizing and counteracting normalcy bias requires deliberate effort and systematic approaches. Organizations and individuals must develop strategies that force them to confront uncomfortable realities and challenge their assumptions about continuing normalcy.

The first step involves cultivating awareness of the bias itself. When people understand how normalcy bias works and recognize their own susceptibility to it, they become better equipped to question their initial assumptions when faced with potential threats. This awareness must be coupled with systems and procedures that force regular reassessment of existing conditions and assumptions.

Effective leadership plays a crucial role in overcoming normalcy bias. Leaders must create environments where questioning the status quo is encouraged rather than discouraged, where bringing up potential problems is rewarded rather than dismissed, and where preparation for unlikely but serious scenarios is valued rather than seen as pessimistic overreaction.

Training and simulation exercises serve as powerful tools for breaking through normalcy bias by forcing individuals to confront scenarios that challenge their assumptions about how events typically unfold. When people experience simulated crises, they develop mental models for recognizing and responding to genuine emergencies, making them less likely to dismiss warning signs when real situations develop.

Perhaps most importantly, organizations must develop cultures that balance the human tendency toward normalcy bias with appropriate vigilance and preparedness. This doesn't mean living in constant fear or overreacting to every potential threat, but rather maintaining the ability to recognize when situations genuinely deviate from normal patterns and responding appropriately to those deviations.

Understanding normalcy bias provides crucial insight into human decision-making under stress and uncertainty. By recognizing this tendency in ourselves and others, we can work to counteract its potentially dangerous effects while still maintaining the psychological stability that normalcy bias originally evolved to provide.

In just one week, I saw it all: vigilance, deception, and neglect. I saw how an alert officer can stop a mass stabbing, how a killer can speak with a smile, and how a clueless lazy officer can leave a new officer depending on an inmate for guidance. Those lessons stuck with me. They shaped how I trained others and how I approached every shift. Because in this line of work, you don't get to choose when the test comes--only whether you're ready for it.

  


**Training Points for Supervisors:**

*Training Points from the Fire*



I recommend these points to spark discussion and reflection with new officers. Each story offers a key takeaway about safety, awareness, and professional responsibility:



‚Ä¢ Encourage curiosity--question everything, even the smallest detail.

‚Ä¢ Instruct officers to evaluate behavior, not just words, as inmates can be charming manipulators.

‚Ä¢ Train rookies to be skeptical of inmates who try to ""help"" or control routines.

‚Ä¢ Stress the responsibility of proper turnover between shifts--especially to new staff.

‚Ä¢ Normalize calling a supervisor when uncertain--don't let silence fill the void.

‚Ä¢ Teach the dangers of projecting personal morality onto inmates.

2) Stress of medical school. 

3) Elevation? My hometown is on coastal level, whereas my med school is around 750-1000 ft of elevation. 

I am currently taking Methylphenidate ER 54 mg daily, and have been prescribed 2.5 mg Minoxidil BID, but have not yet started and have been using Rogaine foam nightly. My blood pressure was normal at my last physical, 3 months ago. 

I have gained 5-10 pounds since starting school 3 weeks ago. I have been going to the gym close to 4 times per week, and have noticed some lightheadedness after my heaviest, low weight reps. However I have always had that, and have actually fainted in the past (hometown) after attempting to hyperventilate before a heavy set of overhead press with a weightlifting belt on. At times, I experience lightheadedness after standing up too quickly. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been noticing any more fatigue than normal. I have noticed chest palpitations at times, especially after drinking energy drinks. 

My parents both are diabetic and have controlled high blood pressure. My father also has a history of AML and my entire paternal side has several autoimmune conditions - T1 Diabetes, MS, etc. 

I do not drink, smoke, or use Marijuana. I try to drink 2-3L of water per day. I have been eating a lot of protein products recently, and have been experiencing some constipation, poor digestion, and occasional blood in feces, but I believe this is just diet related. On my quizzes, I have been frequently missing small details on questions, but again, I think this is just related to over caffeination, stress and poor diet causing me to read questions too quickly.

I am interested in knowing if this increase in heart rate is benign, or something that needs a more thorough work up. I am also curious as to whether I should take the oral minoxidil instead of topical minoxidil due to the hypotensive effects. It was prescribed by a PA, who said it was fine, but might as well check with MDs/DOs. 

Edit: I also have a history of sub clinical hypothyroidism. However my T3/T4 have always been in range, with TSH fluctuating between high normal and slightly elevated.",2,1755531440.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I've lived over a 1/3 of my life and am only now discovering how cathartic drinking tea or coffee while reading is. I'm so angry at the church for keeping this away from me. I'm angry that my spiritual trauma is triggered by this. I'm angry that this is the first trigger I've had in years. I'm now worried that I'll keep having my spiritual trauma triggered. I'm angry that because of my spiritual trauma from the church, I can't enjoy this beautiful thing that I was enjoying. I'm angry that I'm crying over this. I'm angry that again, I have feelings that I'm going to hell for enjoying my cup of coffee. I'm angry that feeling cathartic reminds me of all the bad memories with church.

1mtpgqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductCheckpoint/comments/1mtpgqm/should_you_switch_to_tyler_high_maintenance/,Should You Switch to Tyler High Maintenance Laundry Detergent?,"The Tyler High Maintenance Fine Laundry Detergent TYLERWASH16-HIGHMAINTENANCE has a surprisingly posh touch for a laundry product. It‚Äôs one of those items you feel like you‚Äôve indulged in, and yet there‚Äôs a practical undercurrent to its design and effectiveness. For every laundry enthusiast or someone who simply enjoys a luxurious aroma in their wardrobe, this product seems to check multiple boxes. I decided to try it out after reading a few rave reviews, and let me just say, my experience wasn‚Äôt short of aromatic drama.

**Scent and Sophistication**  
From the very first use, the scent of this liquid detergent was an unmistakable standout. It's a floral and woody fusion with patchouli, vanilla, and a strong musk undertone that adds a rare sophistication. Honestly, it smells like something you‚Äôd want in a high-end candle rather than a detergent. After washing, the clothes carried a long-lasting, subtle fragrance that was classy yet not overpowering. Even items I'd left in storage for a while somehow felt fresher and smelled luxe simply because of this detergent.

[Ready to buy Tyler TYLERWASH16-HIGHMAINTENANCE? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://reviews.senaar.com/p/b002wq4i7q/)

**Ease of Use**  
One thing I appreciated about the liquid detergent is how simple the instructions are, though precision is key. A mere 3 oz, or about 1/3 cup, for a machine load. Can‚Äôt lie‚ÄîI double-checked measurements the first few times because it felt minimal for heavy-duty washing, but it worked like a charm. For handwashing, only 2 teaspoons per sink load does the job. I tried it both ways, and the results were equally satisfying.

**Performance and Effectiveness**  
In terms of cleaning power, this glamorous wash doesn‚Äôt just bring the scent game‚Äîit gets the job done. I tested it on a variety of stains, from grass marks on kids‚Äô clothes to light coffee spills on my favorite sweater. While it's impeccable with lightly soiled items, I noticed it struggled a bit with significant grease marks. Pre-treating those might be necessary if you‚Äôre aiming for spotless results. This is definitely a detergent for your nicer items or bedding, where you prioritize the aroma as much as the cleaning.

**Highlights**  
- Luxurious, long-lasting scent that elevates the typical laundry experience.  
- Efficient for High Efficiency (HE) washers.  
- Gentle yet adequately powerful for everyday use.  
- Works especially well for handwashing delicate fabrics.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The cleaning power might not be ideal for heavily soiled or greasy items, so it works best as a supplementary detergent for certain loads.  
- It‚Äôs a bit hard to justify using it for every single load due to its higher-end nature‚Äîit feels more like a ‚Äúspecial care‚Äù item.  

**Packaging and Design**  
Can we talk about the packaging? It's straightforward but fits the upscale vibe this detergent exudes. The standard 16 fluid ounce bottle is compact yet holds enough for a decent number of washes. However, I wish there was a feature to address easier measuring or a design tweak to make pouring spill-proof. Sometimes I found myself pouring cautiously to avoid over-measuring.

**Rival Brands**  
Compared to products like Tide‚Äôs gentle detergents or Persil‚Äôs ProClean options, the Tyler High Maintenance detergent isn‚Äôt about pure practicality. Where brands like Tide shine for varied stain removal and efficiency, this detergent leans hard into the luxurious sensory territory. If you're seeking hardcore stain-busting power, Persil might feel more robust. But for anyone craving a premium experience and that brilliant blend of scent and sophistication? This glamorous wash stands in its own league.

**Cost-Efficiency**  
There‚Äôs no sugarcoating it‚Äîit does come at a premium compared to standard detergents. This isn‚Äôt your everyday budget-friendly product, but it‚Äôs perfect when you‚Äôre splurging on quality for items you truly care about. Plus, a little goes a long way. Sure, it‚Äôs not for those trying to minimize laundry costs, but if you argue it‚Äôs an investment in high-quality results‚Äîits allure becomes more reasonable.

Found a small tin labeled ""Da Hong Pao 1987"" in her cabinet. Almost threw it away thinking it was stale.  
Holy shit. I had no idea tea could taste like that. Rich, roasted, complex flavors that kept evolving with each sip. Spent an hour just drinking cup after cup.  
Turns out grandma had been quietly collecting high-quality oolongs for decades. Found receipts showing she spent more on some tins than I spend on groceries monthly.  
Now I'm down the rabbit hole. Bought a gaiwan, researching growing regions, learning about oxidation. My coworkers think I'm crazy for refusing office coffee.

So I've been playing around with code for a while - you know, random tutorials, weekend projects, nothing too serious. But this year something shifted and I decided to actually get serious about development.

That's when I discovered that HOW you code matters just as much as what you code.

Before: Chaotic coding sessions, whatever was open on YouTube in the background, harsh lighting, just messing around whenever I felt like it.

Now that I'm taking this seriously, my vibe setup:

* Curated lofi/ambient playlists (no more random distractions)
* Proper lighting that doesn't strain my eyes during long sessions
* Intentional tool choices: **Lovable** for quick prototypes, **Kiro** for AI pair programming, **Claude Code CLI** when I want that focused terminal flow, **Replit** for testing ideas
* Phone on airplane mode (game changer for focus)
* Actual breaks and coffee rituals

The difference is night and day. When I was just playing around, coding felt scattered. Now that I'm vibing with intention, everything flows better. The AI tools especially feel like having a mentor right there with me instead of just random Stack Overflow searches.

It's like I went from ""let me see if this works"" to ""let me build something meaningful"" - and the environment shift made that mental shift possible.

Anyone else make this transition from casual to serious this year? What clicked for you? I'm realizing there's so much about the *craft* of coding that goes beyond just learning syntax.

1mtpbgo,https://i.redd.it/alzfgbt6rsjf1.jpeg,A haul of varied perfumes I've bought recently! (Reviews below),"Fragrances are so much cheaper abroad than India, its nuts. Like, why tax me to oblivion and give me nothing in return? Hate how India treats taxation. Anyways, this post is about fragrances, and this is a review of some pretty good fragrances.

1. Afnan Turathi Blue: if youre on fragrance inside, you'll know how many people are talking about this. I thought its a scam, but I got a whiff of this bad boy, and god, its absolutely amazing. Reminds me of fresh soap, very aquatic vibes. Has very little fruity or sweet notes, which I appreciate. I'd say this fragrance is 1 dimensional, but I think you work with these fresh notes with a hint of woody bases, it's the best you can get. For the price (2200 in uae), I'd say a bargain for what its offering, and would work so well for office spaces, where you want a fragrance, but dont want to scream about it. 8/10

2. CK One: this was a purchase for a friend. This has always been top class. I dont think you'll find a better perfume for citrus, and its amazing. Definitely a top class find. In UAE, the 200ml variant costs 2k... which hurts me so much because I bought the 100ml variant for 4k in India. Still, amazing amazing freshness, wherein I smell more mint, citrus, aquatic notes. It almost smells more like lemon zest than citrus. Love it.

3. Khamrah Qahwa: smelled this in a mall, and found it to be much better than the base variant. I purchased this online (cheaper) and my god, its such a heavy coffee flavor with boozy notes. Definitely abused the vanilla on this one. I will say, if you were to only choose 2 or 3 fragrances to work with in India, DONT get this one. Its more of something that'll work on very specific occasions. But I will say its a very *prominent* smell, in the sense that amongst many fragrances, this will cut through most. More like a 7/10 for quality, and I dont think it'll last too long.

4. Versace Eros: the best way to describe it is that its a safe perfume. It doesn't have too much character. It tries, thats for sure. However, its dry down is not that different from eros flame. It doesnt have many vanilla-esque notes, which I'm very grateful for, and has some pepper-corn, woody, musk like qualities that I appreciate. Not big on projection, which I respect. I am not looking to overpower people in my vicinity with fragrances, and this one is such a perfect middle ground for that. Enough for someone close to me to know I smell great, and definitely enough for me to know that as well. 9/10. And the 200ml bottle cost me whatever 200dhs is in rupees, so its a steal.",3,1755531073.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,5,1.0,False
1mtpbd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExploreComputers/comments/1mtpbd8/explore_whether_the_lenovo_thinkpad_e16_laptop/,Explore Whether the Lenovo ThinkPad E16 Laptop Delivers for Pros,"Testing the Lenovo E16 ThinkPad for daily tasks gave me a pretty solid first impression, especially as someone who juggles work files, streaming, and some light gaming in my downtime. The laptop is designed for business users, but its high-performance specs make it appealing to a broader audience, including tech nerds like me. Its AMD Ryzen 5 7535U processor and 64GB DDR5 RAM scream power, while the 2TB SSD is like the holy grail for storage lovers. Having a compact design packed with features, I couldn‚Äôt wait to give it a proper shot.

**Design and Build Quality**  
One of the first things I noticed was the professional, understated design. The black color complements the business-style aesthetic. Weighing around 8 pounds, it‚Äôs not featherlight but certainly manageable for commuting or bringing to coffee shops. The Lenovo E16 boasts a slim profile at just 0.78 inches in thickness, which is surprisingly sleek for a laptop packing this much tech under the hood. Its military-grade durability adds peace of mind, making it a reliable option for frequent travelers. I mean, who hasn‚Äôt accidentally bumped their bag into something? Knowing this machine meets US MIL-STD 810H standards is a bonus‚Äîrugged without being overkill.

**Performance That Stands Out**  
Never in my wildest dreams did I think I‚Äôd need 64GB of DDR5 RAM, but it surprised me with how effortlessly I could run demanding applications, multiple browser tabs, Adobe Photoshop, and even a virtual machine side by side without breaking a sweat. This AMD Ryzen 5 processor isn't just fast; it makes multitasking feel like a breeze. The 4.55 GHz clock speed proves its mettle for more CPU-intensive tasks. It‚Äôs overkill for everyday emails, spreadsheets, or Netflix, sure, but having that legroom means this laptop has future-proofing written all over it.

**Enjoyable Visual Experience**  
The 16-inch WUXGA 1920x1200 display is a treat. The anti-glare feature paired with a 16:10 aspect ratio makes browsing, coding, or gaming less tiring on the eyes, especially when spending hours staring at the screen. Plus, the T√úV low blue light certification is a win; my headaches after long workdays have noticeably reduced. While the brightness of 300 nits is reasonable indoors, it struggles in direct sunlight, which is disappointing for outdoor users.  

**Highlights**  
‚Ä¢ Exceptional performance for multitasking thanks to DDR5 RAM and a high-speed processor.  
‚Ä¢ Large storage capacity on a 2TB SSD, meaning faster access to files and no need for external drives.  
‚Ä¢ Professional design with military-grade durability, ensuring longevity even in demanding settings.  
‚Ä¢ Eye-friendly display with T√úV low blue light certification.  
‚Ä¢ Extensive connectivity options including USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, and Wi-Fi 6.  

[Check Lenovo E16 price on Amazon.](https://mymypc.com/p/b0f6d2d29j/)  

**Connectivity and Versatility**  
As someone who handles diverse projects‚Äîfrom writing to video editing‚ÄîI demand robust connectivity, and the E16 delivers. With an array of ports, including two USB-A, two USB-C, HDMI, RJ45, and a headphone/mic combo jack, connecting peripherals is seamless. The addition of Wi-Fi 6 ensures robust internet speeds, even in crowded networks like coffee shops or co-working spaces. The laptop also integrates Bluetooth for pairing devices quickly. I tested the port versatility by connecting an external monitor, hard drive, and a USB microphone simultaneously, and everything worked flawlessly.

**Downsides**  
‚Ä¢ Not the most portable option at 8 pounds, especially when paired with a charger.  
‚Ä¢ Screen brightness could be better for outdoor use.  
‚Ä¢ Fans are audible during prolonged heavy tasks, though not distractingly loud.  

**Security Features for Peace of Mind**  
The fingerprint scanner is pure convenience, offering secure access without needing to type in a password every time. Lenovo added advanced security measures, which gave me confidence while working on sensitive client projects. Whether it‚Äôs system boot protection or file encryption, it‚Äôs nice to know my data is safe. For tech enthusiasts, these features feel like a cherry on top.  

**Competing Products**  
If compared with other 16-inch laptops like the Dell XPS or HP Spectre X360, Lenovo‚Äôs offering shines in terms of raw performance. The 64GB of RAM and 2TB SSD run circles around what most of its rivals provide at similar price points. However, the XPS boasts better build materials and the Spectre has a lighter, more portable design. While competitors offer OLED displays, the E16‚Äôs IPS screen still holds its ground with good color reproduction. In terms of pricing, it‚Äôs a closer race, but if you‚Äôre after sheer functionality without paying for extra frills, this laptop edges out the competition.  

**Value for Money**  
Is it worth splurging on this powerhouse? For professional users or tech enthusiasts requiring heavy multitasking and ample storage, I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs absolutely a sound investment. While alternatives might offer a snazzier style or ultra-slim builds, the Lenovo E16 is about delivering dependable performance. Its robust specs ensure you won‚Äôt be shopping for a new laptop anytime soon. It‚Äôs the type of machine that adapts to your work demands rather than being the limiting factor.

A large number of my friends from my younger years are now abroad, so I often times have no one to hang out with in-person and that feels kinda lonely sometimes. Also not a church-goer, so I find the only avenue I have left to meet new people is the internet.

I(21M) would say I'm mostly a nerd tbh, but I'm also very outgoing when w/the right people and in the right environment, and I'm open to going to gaming arcades, bowling alleys(been the one at Kigali Universe and I loved it), attending trivia nights, meeting up in coffee shops or nice restaurants to try new foods, and my favourite destination when meeting new people is the movies(the Canal Olympia theatre) for safety reasons.

Eckhart Tolle, who went from suicidal to spiritually awakened overnight (no joke), delivers what Oprah literally called ‚Äúone of the most valuable books‚Äù she‚Äôs ever read. It's sold millions of copies, been translated into 50+ languages, and spent years dominating the NYT bestsellers list.

But don‚Äôt expect a woo-woo spiritual lecture. This book is about one core idea: your thoughts are driving you insane, and the only way out is‚Ä¶ the present moment. That‚Äôs it. No need to fix your childhood trauma first, no need to manifest a better future. Just learn to *be* here. Now. I read this during a messy post-breakup spiral, and I swear it pulled me out like a spiritual reset button.

## **Book Club Rating: 9.2/10**

## **Key Takeaways:**

* **You are not your thoughts** \- Most of us live in a mental fog, mistaking the voice in our head for our identity. But you‚Äôre the awareness *behind* the thoughts. That little distance is everything.
* **The pain-body is real AF** \- Emotional pain from the past becomes a kind of inner parasite, waiting for the next drama to feed on. You can‚Äôt fight it with logic, only with presence.
* **Clock time vs. psychological time** \- Tolle doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt plan your calendar.‚Äù He says stop *living* in the future and start *feeling* the now. That‚Äôs the actual secret sauce.
* **Surrender is power** \- Resisting reality = suffering. Accepting the moment as it is = freedom. Doesn‚Äôt mean you give up; it means you act from clarity, not panic.
* **Silence, space, and the body are portals to peace** \- Want to stop spiraling? Feel your hands from the inside. Listen to silence. Watch the sky. Yes, it sounds simple. That‚Äôs the point.

## **Quotes I Can‚Äôt Stop Thinking About:**

* ‚ÄúRealize deeply that the present moment is all you ever have.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúWhatever you think the world is withholding from you, you are withholding from the world.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúYou find peace not by rearranging the circumstances of your life, but by realizing who you are at the deepest level.‚Äù

  
Tbh, I used to think ‚Äúbe present‚Äù was just Instagram quote fluff. But this book cracked something open. When I catch myself spiraling now, I just... pause. And it helps. A lot.

If your anxiety‚Äôs been running the show, or you‚Äôve been trying to ‚Äúheal‚Äù forever but still feel stuck - read this book. It‚Äôs not a fix-all, but it‚Äôs a damn powerful flashlight.

# My Own V√§in√§m√∂inen Quest

# A Father‚Äôs Journey from Sunlit Shores to Frozen Streets

Allex Ferreira Aug 18, 2025

I left my life in Asia‚ÄîBali‚Äîlike a man giving up a vice: sweating, but with a clean conscience. The sea beach smell still called my name, the salty breeze still brushed my face, but I had already betrayed paradise. The last thing I smelled was grilled satay smoke mixing with the salt air as I said goodbye to my right-hand man, Putu. I crossed oceans not for adventure, not for money‚Äîbut to be close to the only person who could call me ‚ÄúDaddy‚Äù without it being a lie. Leaving Bali‚Äôs distractions‚Äîbeaches, red sunsets, the women, the occasional parties, and the sweaty jiu-jitsu rolls with training partners‚Äîhad been a good living. But it wasn‚Äôt the life I chose to keep.

A father is a daughter‚Äôs first true love.  
A daughter, especially that first daughter, is a father‚Äôs last true love.

I traded the sound of waves for the silence of snow-covered streets, where even your breath seemed to tiptoe out of your mouth. I traded the salt-sticky nights, heavy with the scent of the ocean, for air so dry it cracked my skin like old paint during winter. Back there, life was easy‚Äîflip-flops on, sun on my face, the horizon always in motion; here, the soles froze before the coffee was gone. Courage was measured in how fast you could get dressed before the cold bit you first. Her mittened hand vanishing into mine as we crossed a street under a sky the color of steel‚Äîthis became my new horizon.

In the stories, V√§in√§m√∂inen crossed frozen seas in search of a magical artifact, his journey sung into legend. I crossed them to be beside my daughter‚Äîmy quest far less grand to the world but infinitely greater to me. He had his¬†*kantele*, strings and songs that could enchant a hall; I had a visa stamped in haste, a suitcase with more resolve than clothes, and the old ‚Äúlet‚Äôs see what happens‚Äù rattling in my head like a talisman against doubt. V√§in√§m√∂inen could charm crowds and kings; I only wanted to reconnect what had been disconnected, not through my own doing‚Äîa bond that was mine to guard, mine to keep alive, and mine to reclaim. He sang spells; I spoke in actions‚Äîzipping her coat, holding her bike steady, showing up every time.

I understood the kind of resolve that leaves no room for negotiation. The kind that strips away excuses. That turns ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù into ‚Äúnow.‚Äù It was the willingness to move mountains, cross seas, and dismantle entire worlds if that‚Äôs what it took to be with the person I loved. Not for titles. Not for recognition. Just for her.

If, to be near her, I had to grow old in a biting cold, trade a sunlit paradise for frozen streets, miss the smell of salt air,¬†**be far from my mother**, my close friends, and my own language‚Äîif I had to spend half the year dressed as if scaling Everest just to walk her to the park‚Äîthen that‚Äôs what I was going to do. Without hesitation.

And some nights, listening to the frozen silence, a part of me resented it. That feeling usually faded with the light. But the ache of being far from my mother‚Äîthat was the price the morning never erased. Still, every shiver, every snowflake, every moment stolen from the easy life became proof she was worth more than all of it combined..

V√§in√§m√∂inen waited for his call. I didn‚Äôt. I stayed‚Äîclose enough to hear her breathe.

My girlfriend and I have been together nearly 3 years, and over this summer, not much has changed since the last time I posted.

She works in hospitality, I work in civil engineering. I work a M-F, and her schedule changes week by week, but that‚Äôs how the industry is.

Reason for this post - it seems to me & my perspective that I do a lot for the relationship, and don‚Äôt feel like I get ‚Äòthanked enough‚Äô, not that I need to be praised for doing things, but shown real/heart-felt appreciation so that I don‚Äôt have to feel this way. Our fights the last 3 days have gone as follows & these are notes I‚Äôve taken from the fights:

Night 1:
She seems very invested in watching tik-toks & netflix after work. Tired from work is understandable, but there‚Äôs no desire to do anything with us. The way things started tonight - I had asked you if you had any plans ( not anything of it, just something to talk about, or ask out of the generosity in my heart ) & you seemed to take that very odd. We followed the conversation with if I had any plans, and hinted at going out local to catch a game, or just staying here, which you didn‚Äôt have any particular interest in me with either plan. You never know what you want for dinner if I ask you, nor do you have any suggestions. I then proceed to do a little over an hour of chores ( laundry, vacuuming, dog care, etc. ) & you offered to help maybe 45 minutes in, which seemed disingenuous as your tone would say so. The way you then approached the conversation after the fact, and it got so heated you needed your hour of space, which I was doing by turning off my location, going to the gym, and giving you your peace. She then got more upset at me that I turned off my location, and I then turned it back on. I then come home from the gym, and she has now made a dinner/cleaned it up, without offering me any of it, and I proceed to take a shower, locking the door to have some peace & quiet. She then calls me while I‚Äôm in the shower becoming extremely frustrated with me that I locked her out of the room. Then, the rest of the night I have lay here not communicating with you any longer, and I don‚Äôt know how to make things right. Just sad.

Night 2:
You and I are genuinely really struggling. Talking about making dinner tonight together, and you getting home seemed to be okay. You discussing your issues/hard times at work also seemed to be okay. We were about halfway through dinner, and topics of conversation started to get heated. The conversations that I can process & understand what is happening is as follows, and I know I‚Äôm missing information, but this is the general scenario: GF states ‚Äú I‚Äôm frustrated with the fact that you can‚Äôt seem to understand my issues & that I need space & for a mediator for us to move through this hard time together‚Äú & I talked about ‚Äú it doesn‚Äôt seem like you feel grateful or appreciative / give thanks for the things I do around the house or for the relationship whatsoever, I pick up after us, etc. ‚Äú I proceed to ask her as honest as I can if she wants to continue to be in this relationship with me because it doesn‚Äôt feel that way. Frustrations arise from the comment, and she then shoves over everything off the coffee table, startling the dog, scaring me. She proceeded to begin screaming & cussing at me stating ‚Äú are you f***ing kidding me (first name) ‚Äú I am following her stating ‚Äú(first name) why did you do that? This is not healthy whatsoever‚Äù trying to solve this issue, I‚Äôm just trying to calm her down, with her continuing & trying to go into the bedroom slamming the door on me ‚Äú get the f*** away from me ‚Äú I try & keep the door open ‚Äú fine, but we should break up because this is not healthy, I can give you the ( years worth of rent money, insert $ that I stated ), and move out of here ‚Äú 
We then give ourselves some time and space for an hour or so, and I‚Äôm the first to speak by apologizing for ‚Äú antagonizing her ‚Äú into becoming verbally and physically angry at me. She then apologizes for taking her frustration out in that fashion. For the rest of the night, we pretty much don‚Äôt speak to one another again. 

Night 3:
I get home from a day with friends, where I‚Äôve already eaten dinner with them, and she has ordered food to home. Conversation via text went as follows: ‚Äú I‚Äôm ordering something ‚Äú I responded ‚Äú gotcha ‚Äú where I sent her money as a kind gesture, and she stated via  ‚Äú I don‚Äôt need you to pay for my dinner ‚Äú I responded ‚Äú I just wanted to help babe, sorry ‚Äú she responded ‚Äú thank you, but I don‚Äôt need help ‚Äú I responded ‚Äú it‚Äôs a nice gesture, that‚Äôs all. I know you don‚Äôt need my help, we‚Äôre eating here ‚Äú she responded ‚Äú thank you and okay ‚Äú - back to @ home. She then tells me how it was one of the hardest days she‚Äôs had at work, which is sad, and I tell her sorry, trying to be there emotionally, but not too overstepping, but sympathetic, etc. she then asks me about getting therapy, which I have wanted to get, and am completely on board for. I take an assessment & she asks me what are some of the things I‚Äôm looking for in a therapist. I describe them to her as some things pertain to my self-esteem issues, trauma from some family times when I was younger, trauma through my past relationships & my current relationship. She steps out, comes back teary eyed, and it gets to a point in the conversation where I walk away to the bedroom as it‚Äôs late, and I‚Äôm ready to lay down. She follows suit, and before we call it a night, she says thank you to me for making sure I‚Äôd come home during this work week to take care of the dog, which I state ‚Äú of course, you don‚Äôt have to thank me for everything ‚Äú not thinking anything of it, & she then responds ‚Äú so you want me to say thank you for everything that you do for me, or you don‚Äôt want me to? You‚Äôre saying 2 different things, and it‚Äôs really frustrating me ‚Äú to which I respond ‚Äú it‚Äôs a feeling thing babe, we don‚Äôt need to thank each other for everything, or we should feel grateful to help one another out & not have to expect a response, but to feel a genuine sense of gratitude from one another ‚Äú we continue to bicker, and it gets to the point she‚Äôs yelling at me again, and I tell her ‚Äú I‚Äôm putting my foot down, please stop yelling ‚Äú & things stay heated, to the point she leaves the bedroom & gets ready to sleep on the couch. I‚Äôm begging her at this point to come back to bed, getting teary eyed, and she then looks at me & states ‚Äú it‚Äôs pathetic that you‚Äôre faking crying. Seems like you have attachment issues ‚Äú I‚Äôm stating ‚Äú I love you, I want to work together through this, and I want you to sleep next to me, please babe ‚Äú etc etc. we then fall asleep in our respective areas.

This morning she kisses me on the cheek, she says ‚Äú goodbye, I‚Äôll see you later ‚Äú I say ‚Äú sounds good, I love you ‚Äú she says ‚Äú I love you too ‚Äú

Certainly sad, confused, conflicted, etc. I appreciate any input/insight, thanks all.

1mtp49c,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1mtp49c/repost_ive_been_searching_for_awhile/,REPOST: I've been searching for awhile,"When I was nine months pregnant, I received an email with an electronic bank statement. My husband, Daniel Hart, had been transferring 30,000 to the same woman every month without fail. The first payment was dated back two years, right around the time we lost our first child.

Then, as if on cue, my phone chimed with a messenger notification. from her.

It was a friend request, along with a note that read:-

‚ÄúThe happy woman who gets 30,000 in pocket money every month.‚Äô I felt an eerie calm wash over me, almost unnatural. As I stroked my belly, I clicked ‚Äòaccept.‚Äô

Immediately, a message popped up:

‚ÄòDid you get the bank statement?‚Äò

Ignoring it, I went straight to her account profile. The earliest post was from two years ago, on April 21. In the photo, she leaned gently on a man‚Äôs shoulder, her hand resting on him, showcasing a massive diamond ring.

The caption read:

‚ÄúThank you for the birthday gift, love!‚Äù

Although only the man‚Äôs back was visible, I recognized him instantly. It was Daniel. My husband. He was wearing the shirt Lhad bought him. during a business trip, the one with intricate embroidery on the collar.

Two years ago, April 21, was the day lost our first child. While I lay in the cold, sterile operating room, undergoing a D&C procedure, my ‚Äòon‚Äìa‚Äìbusiness‚Äìtrip‚Äò husband was celebrating another woman‚Äôs birthday.

The irony was almost suffocating.

My hands trembled as I scrolled further through her posts. Since that day, she had been flaunting all kinds of luxury items, each one identical to things I owned, except for one.

A jasmine‚Äìscented perfume.

Then I saw her most recent post, pinned at the top. It was an ultrasound image. She was pregnant.

I dropped my phone, my heart pounding, and frantically searched through the dirty laundry basket. I found the shirt Daniel had worn the night before. Lifting it to my nose, the unmistakable scent of jasmine hit me.

I never wear perfume.

When I didn‚Äôt respond to the message, the person on the other end. grew impatient. My phone buzzed again and again as photos and videos came flooding in. Clutching my belly, I sank onto the couch, struggling to breathe.

I forced myself to look at the undeniable evidence of Daniel‚Äôs betrayal. The woman in the photos was young and beautiful, her ponytail. bouncing with life. There were pictures of her and Daniel.

He was rowing on a lake, playing in the snow, and tucking a maple leaf into her hair. It was as though each season, spring, summer, fall, and winter, was captured in their little love story.

Taking a deep breath, I shakily opened one of the videos. In it, Daniel stood by the ocean, tenderly calling her ‚ÄòMy Carina.‚Äò

She softly asked, ‚ÄúDo you love me?‚Äù

This was my husband of seven years, the father of the baby growing inside me, replying with a warmth I hadn‚Äôt seen in years.

‚ÄòI‚Äôll always love you, Cara.‚Äô

I replayed the video over and over, tears streaming down my face. As dusk fell, the room around me grew dim.

Daniel finally came home. His voice was gentle as he lightly scolded me, ‚ÄúOlivia, why didn‚Äôt you turn on the lights? It‚Äôs so dark! What if you fall?‚Äù

He flipped the light switch, and the room lit up. I quickly covered my tear‚Äìstreaked face as he knelt in front of me and took my hand.

‚ÄúWhy are you crying? Who made my precious wife and our little one so sad?‚Äù he asked, his voice soft as he kissed my belly.

As he leaned closer, I smelled the same sweet jasmine fragrance. Struggling to keep calm, I asked, ‚ÄúWhere were you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was working late at the office. What‚Äôs wrong, honey?‚Äù Daniel replied casually, as though nothing was out of the ordinary..

‚ÄòYou‚Äôre lying, Daniel. You were with Cara! She had a craving for those famous dumplings from the east side of the city, and since there was no delivery, you drove over an hour from the west side to get them for her. She even live‚Äìstreamed the whole thing!‚Äò

Feigning nonchalance, I smiled, gently squeezing his hand. ‚ÄúHoney, I suddenly have a craving for those dumplings from the east side, too,‚Äù I said, resting my hands on my belly.

As if sensing my pain, the baby kicked hard. ‚ÄúCan you get some for me?‚Äù

Annoyance flickered across Daniel‚Äôs face as he pulled his hand away, frustration creeping into his expression. ‚ÄúThose dumplings aren‚Äôt anything special. Besides, you‚Äôre pretty far along. You should watch what you eat.‚Äù Standing up, he added, ‚ÄúFor the sake of our son, just bear with it a little longer, okay?‚Äù

Without waiting for a response, he muttered, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to take a shower. I‚Äôm exhausted. Why don‚Äôt you call Mom and ask her to make you something?‚Äù

The bathroom door clicked shut.

Swallowing my sobs, I gently stroked my belly and whispered, ‚ÄúOh, sweetheart, you and I are about to fight a tough battle together.‚Äù

Chapter 2

Daniel‚Äôs phone blinked on the dining table. As usual, he never even tried to hide his infidelity in front of me.

Did he really think I was that na√Øve?

The sound of water running in the bathroom echoed through the house. With a sigh, I struggled with my pregnant belly and slowly stood up. Hoping for a quick solution, I tried all the obvious. passwords from our wedding anniversary and our birthdays, but none of them worked. My hands trembled as I entered the date from Cara‚Äôs ultrasound report.

Success!

Biting my lip in frustration, I sneered as I opened the messaging app‚Äôs storage. Sure enough, Cara‚Äôs profile picture was there. Their avatars matched.

He said, ‚ÄúIf love lasts forever,‚Äù and she replied, ‚ÄúDoes it matter if we‚Äôre together every day?‚Äù

I clicked into the chat and was greeted by a flood of ‚ÄúDarling, I miss you‚Äù and ‚ÄúBaby, when will I see you again?‚Äù Determined not to let my emotions take over, I activated the screen recording feature.

Next, I opened Daniel‚Äôs shopping app. To my dismay, his order history was filled with pregnancy supplements, skincare products, and makeup. They were all sent to the same address. Every delivery was made to Cara.

With one hand resting on my restless baby, I took screenshots with the other. I sent the videos and screenshots to myself, then carefully deleted the evidence. Satisfied that everything was in order, I placed the phone back exactly where I‚Äôd found it.

Waddling back to the bedroom, I lay down on my side. The weight of betrayal settled over me as my heart felt like it had a hole ripped. through it, and I couldn‚Äôt stop shivering from the cold weight of betrayal. After seven years of marriage, I had been reduced to a cruel joke.

When Daniel came out of the shower, his phone rang. From my vantage point, through the crack in the door, I saw his face soften as he answered the call. Glancing toward the bedroom, he carefully stepped out onto the balcony, closing the door behind him.

Curiosity gnawing at me, I forced myself up and stood by the door, watching him. I couldn‚Äôt make out the words, but his expression was tender, with a slight smile. At some point, whoever was on the other end must have said something that made him frown in discomfort. But soon enough, he caved, agreeing with a subtle smile.

The chill in my chest deepened. Slowly, I turned and dragged myself back to bed, feeling as if the air had been sucked out of the room. Even breathing felt like a burden.

A few minutes later, I heard Daniel tiptoe back inside. One of his. hands rested on my belly while the other gently brushed the hair from my forehead.

His voice was soft as he whispered, ‚ÄúBaby, there‚Äôs an urgent project at work. I need to go in.‚Äù

I turned my head and stared deeply into his eyes. My last shred of hope flickered weakly as I asked, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel well. Could you stay?‚Äù

For a brief moment, I thought that if he chose to stay with me instead of running to her, I could try to forgive him.

But then I remembered: Once the kite string snaps, it can never be fixed.

As expected, Daniel gave me a troubled smile, trying to reassure me. ‚ÄúSweetheart, this project is essential for the company. Lean‚Äôt miss it.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call Mom to come over and stay with you, okay?‚Äù

A wave of nausea washed over me, goosebumps prickling my skin. Still, I managed to force out the words, ‚ÄúDrive safely.‚Äù

I lay there in silence, watching him get dressed and leave. Slowly, I got up, holding my belly, and made my way downstairs to hail a taxi. ‚ÄúMaplewood Estates,‚Äù I told the driver.

He sped through the streets, and just as we arrived, I saw Daniel‚Äôs car pull in. My stomach clenched as I asked the driver to park behind a tree. From the back seat, I watched as Cara fluttered into Daniel‚Äôs arms like a butterfly.

He caught her gently, placing a hand on her flat stomach. His face softened with a look of tender reproach, and he playfully tapped her nose.

Cradling my belly with one hand, I took out my phone and switched to video mode. With trembling fingers, I watched through the screen as Daniel lifted Cara into the passenger seat and carefully buckled her seatbelt.

My eyes burned, but I blinked back the tears.

‚ÄúDriver, follow that car,‚Äù I said.

The car climbed onto the overpass, neon lights flashing by outside the window. In a daze, my nails dug into the window frame until they split, the sharp pain snapping me back to reality. I put my bleeding fingers into my mouth and bit down hard.

As the car wove through the city streets, I repeated to myself repeatedly, ‚ÄúOlivia, endure it. The pain will pass.‚Äù

When we arrived at Riverside General Hospital, I scanned the QR code to pay the driver.

As I stepped out of the car, the usually quiet driver turned to me and said, with unexpected kindness, ‚ÄúMiss, take care of yourself. For the baby‚Äôs sake, don‚Äôt hurt yourself.‚Äù

Since discovering Daniel‚Äôs affair, I hadn‚Äôt told a soul. The secret felt like poison, slowly eating away at me from the inside. The kindness of a stranger felt like a fresh breath of air, pulling me back from the abyss.

I gently closed the car door, offering him a small smile. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, Sir. No‚Äìone can hurt me anymore. Because I‚Äôm ready to throw the trash where it belongs.‚Äù

Chapter 3

I hid behind a pillar, watching Daniel. He had been too busy with work to attend a single prenatal check‚Äìup with me during my entire pregnancy. Yet here he was, running around the hospital, registering, picking up medication, and gently helping another woman in and out like the perfect husband.

At that moment, I realized it wasn‚Äôt that he was too busy. He didn‚Äôt want to make an effort for the wife he‚Äôd been married to for seven years.

In the bustling hospital lobby, Daniel held the woman close, reminding her, ‚ÄúThe doctor said you should eat less tonight and try to stay active. In the early stages of pregnancy, digestion can be tricky, so let‚Äôs follow the advice this time, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúAww, fine, I got it!‚Äù she replied, pouting playfully. But it‚Äôs your fault! You bought way too many dumplings.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, alright, I‚Äôll take the blame,‚Äù he said with a smile. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my fault. for making my sweetheart eat too much, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs better.‚Äù She smirked. ‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôll forgive you‚Ä¶ this time.‚Äù

As I watched them, they bantered like a real couple, close and inseparable, while I stood under the hospital‚Äôs harsh fluorescent lights, feeling like an intruder in my own life. I was invisible to them. With a heavy heart, I held my belly and slowly shuffled out of the hospital. Outside, the scene was no less cruel. The rain had started. The cold autumn wind blew against me, and the rain felt like it was trying to drown the world in its chill. Through the mist, I watched as Daniel draped his coat over her, shielding her from the rain and gently helping her into the front passenger seat.

The woman smiled up at him, grabbing his tie and pulling him in for a kiss. My husband cupped her face and kissed her deeply right there in the rain. When they finally pulled apart, he tapped her nose playfully, and she tugged on his tie again, biting his lip hard.

To my surprise, instead of getting upset, he just smiled like he was

thrilled. Then, he got into the car. As the car was about to pull away, the woman rolled down the window, locking eyes with me.

She gave me a smug, taunting look and said, ‚ÄúOlivia, you‚Äôve lost.‚Äù

I smiled and shook my head. A strange calm washed over me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, Olivia.‚Äù

Then, I whispered to myself, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just a man, nothing more.‚Äù

As the car turned the corner, I waved. ‚ÄúDaniel, I don‚Äôt want you anymore. You‚Äôre hers.‚Äù

In that decisive moment, standing under the hospital awning, I calmly sent all the evidence I had gathered to my mentor, a well‚Äìknown divorce lawyer. I was going to secure the best future for my child, no matter what.

By the time I finished, the rain had already soaked the hem of my dress. Oddly enough, I barely noticed. Just as I put my phone away, it rang.

It was Mom.

‚ÄúOlivia, I made some soup for you and brought it to the house. Where are you and Danny? Why aren‚Äôt you home?‚Äù Her voice was filled with warmth and concern.

Before I could respond, she continued, ‚ÄúOh, that Danny. You‚Äôre this far along, and he‚Äôs still taking you out? You really need to be careful right now.‚Äù

Hearing my mom‚Äôs voice felt like a blow, like opening a floodgate I had been trying so hard to keep closed. All the pain I had been holding in grew into an overwhelming weight, pressing down on my chest. I bit down hard on my lip, fighting back the sob rising in my throat. The pain of suppressing it sent a shiver through my entire body.

‚ÄúMom, don‚Äôt worry,‚Äù I said, forcing a smile even though she couldn‚Äôt see me.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just out having dinner.‚Äù I swallowed hard, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúOh, we‚Äôre being careful. Danny‚Äôs right here with me.‚Äù

I had to keep it together. I couldn‚Äôt let my mom hear me cry. I wouldn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs raining, Mom. Drive home safely, okay? Text me when you get there.‚Äù

I hung up quickly before my voice could betray me. Once the call ended, I took a deep breath and tried to hold everything in, but no matter how hard I tried, the tears finally spilled over. I cried quietly, my body trembling under the weight of it all.

There I stood, a heavily pregnant woman, belly aching, surrounded by strangers coming and going from the hospital. And in that cold, indifferent world, I cried until I had no more tears left in me.

Chapter 4

Daniel didn‚Äôt come home that night. Instead, he only sent a text:

‚ÄòHey Olivia, I‚Äôm working late tonight and crashing into the office. It‚Äôs getting cold and rainy, so don‚Äôt forget to close the window before bed. Love you always, your husband.‚Äò

I read the message without feeling anything. In the past, I would have worried, replied, or waited for Daniel. Now, I didn‚Äôt even bother to respond. I used to think I was the happiest woman in the world because I had the best husband. But reality hit me hard. It had all been a ridiculous facade. People‚Äôs hearts are hidden behind their ribs, and their lies are scribbled on paper.

A few days later, I received the divorce papers my lawyer had drafted. I printed them out, signed my name, and started packing up my things to move back to my mom‚Äôs place. Just as I was getting ready to leave, my phone rang with an unknown number.

It was Cara.

We met at a caf√© downstairs. Cara arrived with an air of confidence, sitting across from me with a smug smile, a supermarket shopping bag by her side. Three months pregnant and balancing on thin high heels, she looked at me as if she had already won.

‚ÄúI thought you wouldn‚Äôt come,‚Äù she said, a smug lilt in her voice. ‚ÄúAfter all, you never replied to my messages.‚Äù

I smiled calmly. My heart was steady, not a flicker of emotion breaking through. ‚ÄúWhy wouldn‚Äôt I come? I haven‚Äôt done anything shameful that I need to hide.‚Äù I leaned back, still smiling. ‚ÄúBesides, Daniel and I are legally married, so I have nothing to hide. Unlike some people who, no matter how hard they try, will always be the hidden third.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou-!‚Äù she snapped, but I cut her off again.

‚ÄúOh, and thank you, by the way,‚Äù I said, my voice steady. ‚ÄúFor sending me all the evidence of your little affair with Daniel. Collecting all that would‚Äôve been much harder on my own.‚Äù

I smiled, this time more dismissively. ‚ÄúSo, this coffee‚Äôs on me.‚Äù

I placed some cash under my cup, stood up slowly, and rested my hand on my belly.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean by that?‚Äù she asked through clenched teeth as she grabbed my arm.

‚ÄúIt means I don‚Äôt want him anymore, I replied, pulling my arm free. ‚ÄúIf you want him, he‚Äôs all yours.‚Äù

Her eyes narrowed, and she threw my arm aside angrily. ‚ÄúWhat game are you playing now? Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm buying this for a second!‚Äù

The force of her shove sent me stumbling backward, and I fell to the floor. At that moment, it felt like a knife had ripped through my belly. Pain shot through me, and I felt my body convulsed.

Blood poured from between my legs, and I screamed in terror, ‚ÄúSave my baby!‚Äù

I barely registered Cara fleeing in panic. Forcing myself to stay calm, I asked the caf√© staff to call an ambulance. By the time they lifted me into the ambulance, my dress was drenched in blood.

As my consciousness began to slip away, I heard a nurse asking for my phone password. I unlocked it for her, and they called my emergency contact, my husband, six times.

Finally, he picked up on the last call.",1,1755530639.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1mtp37t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1mtp37t/repost_please_help_me_find/,REPOST: please help me find,"When I was nine months pregnant, I received an email with an electronic bank statement. My husband, Daniel Hart, had been transferring 30,000 to the same woman every month without fail. The first payment was dated back two years, right around the time we lost our first child.

Then, as if on cue, my phone chimed with a messenger notification. from her.

It was a friend request, along with a note that read:-

‚ÄúThe happy woman who gets 30,000 in pocket money every month.‚Äô I felt an eerie calm wash over me, almost unnatural. As I stroked my belly, I clicked ‚Äòaccept.‚Äô

Immediately, a message popped up:

‚ÄòDid you get the bank statement?‚Äò

Ignoring it, I went straight to her account profile. The earliest post was from two years ago, on April 21. In the photo, she leaned gently on a man‚Äôs shoulder, her hand resting on him, showcasing a massive diamond ring.

The caption read:

‚ÄúThank you for the birthday gift, love!‚Äù

Although only the man‚Äôs back was visible, I recognized him instantly. It was Daniel. My husband. He was wearing the shirt Lhad bought him. during a business trip, the one with intricate embroidery on the collar.

Two years ago, April 21, was the day lost our first child. While I lay in the cold, sterile operating room, undergoing a D&C procedure, my ‚Äòon‚Äìa‚Äìbusiness‚Äìtrip‚Äò husband was celebrating another woman‚Äôs birthday.

The irony was almost suffocating.

My hands trembled as I scrolled further through her posts. Since that day, she had been flaunting all kinds of luxury items, each one identical to things I owned, except for one.

A jasmine‚Äìscented perfume.

Then I saw her most recent post, pinned at the top. It was an ultrasound image. She was pregnant.

I dropped my phone, my heart pounding, and frantically searched through the dirty laundry basket. I found the shirt Daniel had worn the night before. Lifting it to my nose, the unmistakable scent of jasmine hit me.

I never wear perfume.

When I didn‚Äôt respond to the message, the person on the other end. grew impatient. My phone buzzed again and again as photos and videos came flooding in. Clutching my belly, I sank onto the couch, struggling to breathe.

I forced myself to look at the undeniable evidence of Daniel‚Äôs betrayal. The woman in the photos was young and beautiful, her ponytail. bouncing with life. There were pictures of her and Daniel.

He was rowing on a lake, playing in the snow, and tucking a maple leaf into her hair. It was as though each season, spring, summer, fall, and winter, was captured in their little love story.

Taking a deep breath, I shakily opened one of the videos. In it, Daniel stood by the ocean, tenderly calling her ‚ÄòMy Carina.‚Äò

She softly asked, ‚ÄúDo you love me?‚Äù

This was my husband of seven years, the father of the baby growing inside me, replying with a warmth I hadn‚Äôt seen in years.

‚ÄòI‚Äôll always love you, Cara.‚Äô

I replayed the video over and over, tears streaming down my face. As dusk fell, the room around me grew dim.

Daniel finally came home. His voice was gentle as he lightly scolded me, ‚ÄúOlivia, why didn‚Äôt you turn on the lights? It‚Äôs so dark! What if you fall?‚Äù

He flipped the light switch, and the room lit up. I quickly covered my tear‚Äìstreaked face as he knelt in front of me and took my hand.

‚ÄúWhy are you crying? Who made my precious wife and our little one so sad?‚Äù he asked, his voice soft as he kissed my belly.

As he leaned closer, I smelled the same sweet jasmine fragrance. Struggling to keep calm, I asked, ‚ÄúWhere were you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was working late at the office. What‚Äôs wrong, honey?‚Äù Daniel replied casually, as though nothing was out of the ordinary..

‚ÄòYou‚Äôre lying, Daniel. You were with Cara! She had a craving for those famous dumplings from the east side of the city, and since there was no delivery, you drove over an hour from the west side to get them for her. She even live‚Äìstreamed the whole thing!‚Äò

Feigning nonchalance, I smiled, gently squeezing his hand. ‚ÄúHoney, I suddenly have a craving for those dumplings from the east side, too,‚Äù I said, resting my hands on my belly.

As if sensing my pain, the baby kicked hard. ‚ÄúCan you get some for me?‚Äù

Annoyance flickered across Daniel‚Äôs face as he pulled his hand away, frustration creeping into his expression. ‚ÄúThose dumplings aren‚Äôt anything special. Besides, you‚Äôre pretty far along. You should watch what you eat.‚Äù Standing up, he added, ‚ÄúFor the sake of our son, just bear with it a little longer, okay?‚Äù

Without waiting for a response, he muttered, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to take a shower. I‚Äôm exhausted. Why don‚Äôt you call Mom and ask her to make you something?‚Äù

The bathroom door clicked shut.

Swallowing my sobs, I gently stroked my belly and whispered, ‚ÄúOh, sweetheart, you and I are about to fight a tough battle together.‚Äù

Chapter 2

Daniel‚Äôs phone blinked on the dining table. As usual, he never even tried to hide his infidelity in front of me.

Did he really think I was that na√Øve?

The sound of water running in the bathroom echoed through the house. With a sigh, I struggled with my pregnant belly and slowly stood up. Hoping for a quick solution, I tried all the obvious. passwords from our wedding anniversary and our birthdays, but none of them worked. My hands trembled as I entered the date from Cara‚Äôs ultrasound report.

Success!

Biting my lip in frustration, I sneered as I opened the messaging app‚Äôs storage. Sure enough, Cara‚Äôs profile picture was there. Their avatars matched.

He said, ‚ÄúIf love lasts forever,‚Äù and she replied, ‚ÄúDoes it matter if we‚Äôre together every day?‚Äù

I clicked into the chat and was greeted by a flood of ‚ÄúDarling, I miss you‚Äù and ‚ÄúBaby, when will I see you again?‚Äù Determined not to let my emotions take over, I activated the screen recording feature.

Next, I opened Daniel‚Äôs shopping app. To my dismay, his order history was filled with pregnancy supplements, skincare products, and makeup. They were all sent to the same address. Every delivery was made to Cara.

With one hand resting on my restless baby, I took screenshots with the other. I sent the videos and screenshots to myself, then carefully deleted the evidence. Satisfied that everything was in order, I placed the phone back exactly where I‚Äôd found it.

Waddling back to the bedroom, I lay down on my side. The weight of betrayal settled over me as my heart felt like it had a hole ripped. through it, and I couldn‚Äôt stop shivering from the cold weight of betrayal. After seven years of marriage, I had been reduced to a cruel joke.

When Daniel came out of the shower, his phone rang. From my vantage point, through the crack in the door, I saw his face soften as he answered the call. Glancing toward the bedroom, he carefully stepped out onto the balcony, closing the door behind him.

Curiosity gnawing at me, I forced myself up and stood by the door, watching him. I couldn‚Äôt make out the words, but his expression was tender, with a slight smile. At some point, whoever was on the other end must have said something that made him frown in discomfort. But soon enough, he caved, agreeing with a subtle smile.

The chill in my chest deepened. Slowly, I turned and dragged myself back to bed, feeling as if the air had been sucked out of the room. Even breathing felt like a burden.

A few minutes later, I heard Daniel tiptoe back inside. One of his. hands rested on my belly while the other gently brushed the hair from my forehead.

His voice was soft as he whispered, ‚ÄúBaby, there‚Äôs an urgent project at work. I need to go in.‚Äù

I turned my head and stared deeply into his eyes. My last shred of hope flickered weakly as I asked, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel well. Could you stay?‚Äù

For a brief moment, I thought that if he chose to stay with me instead of running to her, I could try to forgive him.

But then I remembered: Once the kite string snaps, it can never be fixed.

As expected, Daniel gave me a troubled smile, trying to reassure me. ‚ÄúSweetheart, this project is essential for the company. Lean‚Äôt miss it.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call Mom to come over and stay with you, okay?‚Äù

A wave of nausea washed over me, goosebumps prickling my skin. Still, I managed to force out the words, ‚ÄúDrive safely.‚Äù

I lay there in silence, watching him get dressed and leave. Slowly, I got up, holding my belly, and made my way downstairs to hail a taxi. ‚ÄúMaplewood Estates,‚Äù I told the driver.

He sped through the streets, and just as we arrived, I saw Daniel‚Äôs car pull in. My stomach clenched as I asked the driver to park behind a tree. From the back seat, I watched as Cara fluttered into Daniel‚Äôs arms like a butterfly.

He caught her gently, placing a hand on her flat stomach. His face softened with a look of tender reproach, and he playfully tapped her nose.

Cradling my belly with one hand, I took out my phone and switched to video mode. With trembling fingers, I watched through the screen as Daniel lifted Cara into the passenger seat and carefully buckled her seatbelt.

My eyes burned, but I blinked back the tears.

‚ÄúDriver, follow that car,‚Äù I said.

The car climbed onto the overpass, neon lights flashing by outside the window. In a daze, my nails dug into the window frame until they split, the sharp pain snapping me back to reality. I put my bleeding fingers into my mouth and bit down hard.

As the car wove through the city streets, I repeated to myself repeatedly, ‚ÄúOlivia, endure it. The pain will pass.‚Äù

When we arrived at Riverside General Hospital, I scanned the QR code to pay the driver.

As I stepped out of the car, the usually quiet driver turned to me and said, with unexpected kindness, ‚ÄúMiss, take care of yourself. For the baby‚Äôs sake, don‚Äôt hurt yourself.‚Äù

1mtp2nr,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mtp2nr/dogs_of_night/,Dogs of Night,"‚ÄúCan you please just find a gas station that‚Äôs not a million miles away?‚Äù Jared grumbled.

I stared out the backseat window at the crepuscular desert as we rumbled through. It had been almost forty-five minutes since our last sign of civilization that wasn‚Äôt a road sign, and my doubts that we were actually going to find the campsite were feeling more and more founded by the hour. Everything was sore, especially my shoulder. I didn‚Äôt have the heart to push Katie off and risk waking her up, so I focused my attention on the darkening world outside once more.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying, there‚Äôs no service out here,‚Äù Jenna snapped back from the passenger seat. ‚ÄúJust give me a minute.‚Äù

I noticed a shape on the hillside by the road, a sleek silhouette with a pair of pointy ears and a tail. Silver dollar eyes gleamed as we drove past. A coyote, stock-still. We made eye contact, though I couldn‚Äôt tell if it could see me.

A clap resounded in the small car, stirring Katie slightly. A breathed a silent prayer of thanks as she relieved some of the pressure from my shoulder.

‚ÄúGot one,‚Äù Jenna exclaimed. ‚ÄúAbout ten minutes till we hit one on the right.‚Äù

Jared examined his dashboard, trying to tell how many millimeters of clearance the fuel meter had above complete emptiness. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôll be cutting it real close,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIs there anything the other direction that‚Äôs shorter?‚Äù

Jenna shook her head. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt seen anywhere to fill up in two hours at least,‚Äù she complained. ‚ÄúGodless land out here, I swear.‚Äù

Katie leaned back on my shoulder once more, causing me to grimace. ‚ÄúHow much further?‚Äù she whispered.

‚ÄúNo idea,‚Äù I whispered back. ‚ÄúStill figuring out if we have enough gas to make it.‚Äù

Jared cracked the windows slightly, allowing cool night air to slip into the stagnant atmosphere of the interior. Taking a breath of air that didn‚Äôt smell like sweat and Monster energy for the first time in almost six hours sounded appealing until I noticed a new stench wafting in through the windows ‚Äì rotting meat.

Jenna crinkled her nose. ‚ÄúGood lord, this desert just gets worse and worse,‚Äù she whined. ‚ÄúFirst it‚Äôs hot, now it stinks like hell.‚Äù Jared rolled the windows back up in defeating, sighing.

The dashboard clock read just past nine p.m., but I remembered it was almost two hours behind when we‚Äôd first set out. We were drawing close to midnight and there seemed to be no chance that we‚Äôd get to the campsite before then. No way was I planning on setting up tents in the dark. Additionally, no way were the four of us fitting in the car comfortably enough for a good night‚Äôs sleep.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting super low,‚Äù Jared said. ‚ÄúHow much further to the station?‚Äù

‚ÄúStill got five minutes to go,‚Äù Jenna replied.

He thought for a long moment before exhaling. ‚ÄúI might be able to just cruise down that hill in neutral,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúGeez, it‚Äôs gonna be close though. Hope you‚Äôre ready to push if worst comes to worst, Brad.‚Äù I mouthed ‚Äúno‚Äù very obviously in full view of the rearview mirror before pointing at Katie, who was beginning to slip onto my lap. Jared rolled his eyes.

Turning my attention once more to the rolling, barren hills outside the window, I noticed two more coyotes coming over the ridge, engaged in what appeared to be a game of tag. The animal in pursuit nipped at his playmate‚Äôs heel, causing the both of them to go tumbling. If I weren‚Äôt so exhausted, I probably would have cracked up.

‚ÄúWatch out!‚Äù Jenna suddenly screamed.¬†

The car swerved before shuddering to a sudden halt, causing my skull to smack off the window. Rubbing the side of my forehead, I sat up to see what the commotion was about.¬†

A skeletally skin German Shepherd trotted carefully through the beam of the headlights, head hanging low. A faded collar dangled from its neck, clearly fitted for a much healthier dog of his size. We sat in silence, all fully awake now, watching the dog disappear into the night.

‚ÄúShould‚Äì should we call somebody?‚Äù Katie asked after a moment of silence. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs clearly someone‚Äôs pet. He probably ran away.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you wanna do that when we get to the gas station, be my guest,‚Äù Jared said, easing away from the site of our near-collision. ‚ÄúI just want to sleep.‚Äù

We made it to the top of the hill without another word. I noticed a few houses were starting to appear, long dirt driveways leading back to the road. Not a single light was on, but I didn‚Äôt blame them, considering the time.¬†

I noticed a few more coyotes slinking around the backyards of a few of the houses, eyes gleaming in the moonlight as they watched us cruise past. One of them was even bold enough to lounge on the front porch, forelegs sticking out through the railings. The hair on the back of my neck stood up, so I focused my attention out the windshield instead.

A small desert town lay below us, and with a pang of nostalgia, I was reminded of Radiator Springs. If not for my hazy, delirious state of exhaustion, it wouldn‚Äôt have been hard to imagine the neon lights of the ‚ÄúLife Could Be A Dream‚Äù scene. Instead, the only illumination came from a distant yellow glow near a four-way intersection ‚Äì the gas station.

‚ÄúI recognize this town,‚Äù Jared said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ten minutes away from the campsite! Thank God.‚Äù

As we started the slow descent into town, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice that the number of coyotes was steadily increasing. Intermingled among their ranks were domesticated dogs as well, as I distinctly recognized a golden retriever and a pair of dark labradors.¬†

‚ÄúIs anyone else weirded out by all these dogs?‚Äù I asked.

Jared took his eyes off the road for the first time since we‚Äôd almost hit the German Shepherd. ‚ÄúYeah, that is weird,‚Äù he said. We slowed slightly as he took stock of our surroundings a bit more, his facial expression becoming more and more confused with each passing minute.

We rolled past a little rundown bungalow, yard overgrown with dry weeds, multiple shingles missing from the roof. I counted the number of animals lurking in its yard, watching us with silver dollar eyes. Fourteen coyotes, three dogs. I shivered.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this,‚Äù Jenna said quietly. ‚ÄúWhere are all the people?‚Äù

No one had a theory, so we rolled on in silence.

We were less than a block away from the gas station when Jared let the car roll to a complete stop. Shutting off the engine to conserve whatever was still sloshing around in the tank, he turned to the rest of us.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna get out of the car,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really freaked out right now, man. Where on earth is everybody? Why are there so many animals?‚Äù

Jenna laid a hand on his shoulder, trying to subdue the hurricane raging within. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be fine,‚Äù she said very unconvincingly. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll just fill up and be on our way. Look, they‚Äôre not even going anywhere near the gas station.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what then?‚Äù he snapped suddenly. ‚ÄúYou think they‚Äôre just not gonna be at the campground? What are we supposed to do then?‚Äù

No response was uttered. Truthfully, I‚Äôd been concerned for our safety once we reached our destination since I‚Äôd seen the first coyote. If there were this many of them roaming the desert at night, a tent was not going to serve as much of a defense.¬†

After a painfully long silence punctuated by the clicking of a hot engine getting its first rest in almost ten hours, Jared sighed. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt stay here forever,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll fill up, get to the campground, and I‚Äôll ask if we can use their phone to call animal control or something because there is no way in hell I am spending the night in a tent with this many wild animals out and about.‚Äù

We pulled into the gas station parking lot, completely barren aside from a beater pickup double parked in front of the convenience store. Something told me it had been there for a very long time.

Jared unbuckled his seat belt, wallet in hand. ‚ÄúJust pay, stick the pump in, back in the car,‚Äù he said in a bizarre self-reassurance ritual none of us questioned. ‚ÄúWait till its full, get the pump out, leave.‚Äù Taking a deep breath, he got out as quickly and quietly as possible.

None of us said a word as he did his best to silently open the gas cap and begin working the pump. Once more, I turned to the window, trying to see what the dim fluorescent light of the gas station would reveal about our situation. Thus far, none of the coyotes or dogs seemed to care about us; none of them were within the halo of light surrounding the parking lot.

Cursing, Jared scrambled back into the driver‚Äôs seat, slamming the door shut. A single coyote, strikingly thin and silently malicious, was on the other side of the parking lot, staring us down. ‚ÄúChrist almighty,‚Äù he gasped. ‚ÄúWhy am I scared? Coyotes aren‚Äôt even that dangerous.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúJust breathe,‚Äù Jenna said, not taking her eyes off the animal as it stood there, unmoving.

The coyote either got bored or realized we weren‚Äôt going to come out of the car, as it eventually turned and plodded back off into the darkness, letting out a small yip as it vanished into cover of night. Another animal responded somewhere in the distance, then another. Before long a deafening cacophony of barks and howls overtook the once silent night, a strangely beautiful yet haunting song with no rhythm or reason.

Katie shifted, forfeiting her position against my shoulder in favor of a near-fetal position, knees hugged close to her chest. I put an arm around her shoulders that I hoped was comforting, trying to angle myself so that she couldn‚Äôt feel my heart beating triple-time.

A sudden clicking resounded through the small car, making us all jump. The tank was full. I looked at Jared to see if he was ready to make the quick excursion back outside and get us prepared to be on our way. He took one more deep breath.

‚ÄúPlease be careful,‚Äù Jenna whispered. Without a response, he threw the door open and stumbled out, keeping low to the ground.

I let my vision wander as we waited, holding our collective breaths. There was a light on in the back of the convenience store somewhere, maybe a fridge or back room that hadn‚Äôt been turned off along with everything else. The back door behind the ice freezers swung gently in the breeze. I noticed a dark stain on one of the windows, partially obscured by an old sale poster.

‚ÄúJesus,‚Äù Jared yelled, slamming the door once more. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all around.‚Äù

I looked past Katie, still in her protective position with eyes squeezed shut, to see the first coyote venture into the light on the other side of the parking lot. Just behind it, hundreds of silver dollar eyes flashed in and out as they slowly moved forward.

‚ÄúStart the car and let‚Äôs go,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúJust drive. Hit them if you have to.‚Äù

As soon as Jared turned the key in the ignition, someone tore out of the back door of the convenience store, trying to apply pressure to their left shoulder while simultaneously reloading a shotgun. They locked eyes with me and I noticed it was a teenager, no older than fifteen. Frenzied panic filled his eyes as he streaked around the corner before noticing the truck was right in the path of danger.¬†

The lead coyote locked onto him almost immediately and charged, howling a chilling battle cry. A split second decision was made and the kid sprinted over to our car, swinging the shotgun blindly by the barrel.

‚ÄúOpen the door!‚Äù Jenna screamed at me. I did, almost shoving it directly into his path. The kid missed by a few inches, swinging around and cramming himself into the seat beside me as I did my best to move Katie over, still paralyzed with fear.¬†

Before the door was even closed, Jared slammed on the gas, hitting multiple dogs in the process. Their sudden yelps were muffled but painfully audible over the engine as we peeled out of the parking lot in the direction of the campground.

I turned back to get one last look at the gas station from hell before noticing the kid‚Äôs injuries. The hand clutching his left shoulder was covered in blood, dried and flesh. Sweat, dirt, tears, and deep bags stained his face.¬†

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the first aid kit?‚Äù I asked Katie, still in her fetal position.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs in the trunk with most of the other stuff,‚Äù Jenna said, turning around to take stock of the kid‚Äôs injuries. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, the campground is only like ten minutes away. We can hold out.‚Äù

‚ÄúN-no,‚Äù the kid croaked. ‚ÄúBlood loss.‚Äù

I turned on my phone flashlight to get a better look at the gash on his shoulder before noticing a massive, dark red stain on his lower torso. ‚ÄúWe need that kit now, Jenna,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIs there a spare somewhere?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs right here,‚Äù Katie said quietly, rooting around in her backpack before procuring a roll of gauze and some ointment. ‚ÄúAlways keep one on you. You never know.‚Äù

Turning my attention back to the kid, I asked the only question I could think to ask before attempting to save his life.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

He stared at me, dumbfounded that I would be so stupid in such a crucial moment, but obliged. ‚ÄúRandy,‚Äù he managed to say before a coughing fit overtook. I decided conversation could wait.

I‚Äôm no EMT but I‚Äôm happy to say that my shoddy bandaging job did enough to stop the bleeding for the moment after some grueling ointment application. Regardless, however, it was crucial that Randy received actual medical attention before long.

Jared, eyes locked to the road, noticed the sign first. ‚ÄúWe made it,‚Äù he laughed, absolutely drained. ‚ÄúPlease tell me someone‚Äôs awake and ready to help us.‚Äù

To our absolute delight, a light was on in one of the buildings. Jared pumped his fist in celebration. Jenna and Katie let out a little cheer.¬†

Fifteen minutes later, we were in the main lodge, sipping straight black coffee and giving our statements to a police officer while paramedics reapplied Randy‚Äôs bandages in a much better fashion than I‚Äôd been able to muster. The old couple that owned the place, to our jubilation, had been awake when we pulled up and called the police before we even made it inside. Jared had to explain that we‚Äôd reserved a campsite before they even let us inside.

‚ÄúThat town you were in is called Dawson Ridge,‚Äù the sheriff explained to us after we‚Äôd all finished giving our statements. ‚ÄúThe deputies are checking it out right now. We‚Äôll have word on the situation soon enough. As for now, I‚Äôm sure you can all get some rest after your‚Ä¶ ordeal.‚Äù

After the paramedics helped Randy outside and into the ambulance, the old man was kind enough to let us spend the night in the main lodge, even bringing out some old cots for us. The others were out almost immediately, Jared‚Äôs soft snoring filling the room.¬†

I sat awake with the sheriff, visions of silver dollar eyes in the moonlight filling my head no matter how hard I tried to shake them. Accepting in defeat that I was getting minimal sleep that night, I decided to try and make some small talk before I went to lay down and roll around in discomfort for hours.

Before I could get a word out, a single howl echoed in the distance.",3,1755530540.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1mtp296,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1mtp296/repost_ive_been_searching_for_this_for_awhile/,"R-E-P-O-S-T: I've been searching for this for awhile, please no app$$$$$$$","When I was nine months pregnant, I received an email with an electronic bank statement. My husband, Daniel Hart, had been transferring 30,000 to the same woman every month without fail. The first payment was dated back two years, right around the time we lost our first child.

Then, as if on cue, my phone chimed with a messenger notification. from her.

It was a friend request, along with a note that read:-

‚ÄúThe happy woman who gets 30,000 in pocket money every month.‚Äô I felt an eerie calm wash over me, almost unnatural. As I stroked my belly, I clicked ‚Äòaccept.‚Äô

Immediately, a message popped up:

‚ÄòDid you get the bank statement?‚Äò

Ignoring it, I went straight to her account profile. The earliest post was from two years ago, on April 21. In the photo, she leaned gently on a man‚Äôs shoulder, her hand resting on him, showcasing a massive diamond ring.

The caption read:

‚ÄúThank you for the birthday gift, love!‚Äù

Although only the man‚Äôs back was visible, I recognized him instantly. It was Daniel. My husband. He was wearing the shirt Lhad bought him. during a business trip, the one with intricate embroidery on the collar.

Two years ago, April 21, was the day lost our first child. While I lay in the cold, sterile operating room, undergoing a D&C procedure, my ‚Äòon‚Äìa‚Äìbusiness‚Äìtrip‚Äò husband was celebrating another woman‚Äôs birthday.

The irony was almost suffocating.

My hands trembled as I scrolled further through her posts. Since that day, she had been flaunting all kinds of luxury items, each one identical to things I owned, except for one.

A jasmine‚Äìscented perfume.

Then I saw her most recent post, pinned at the top. It was an ultrasound image. She was pregnant.

I dropped my phone, my heart pounding, and frantically searched through the dirty laundry basket. I found the shirt Daniel had worn the night before. Lifting it to my nose, the unmistakable scent of jasmine hit me.

I never wear perfume.

When I didn‚Äôt respond to the message, the person on the other end. grew impatient. My phone buzzed again and again as photos and videos came flooding in. Clutching my belly, I sank onto the couch, struggling to breathe.

I forced myself to look at the undeniable evidence of Daniel‚Äôs betrayal. The woman in the photos was young and beautiful, her ponytail. bouncing with life. There were pictures of her and Daniel.

He was rowing on a lake, playing in the snow, and tucking a maple leaf into her hair. It was as though each season, spring, summer, fall, and winter, was captured in their little love story.

Taking a deep breath, I shakily opened one of the videos. In it, Daniel stood by the ocean, tenderly calling her ‚ÄòMy Carina.‚Äò

She softly asked, ‚ÄúDo you love me?‚Äù

This was my husband of seven years, the father of the baby growing inside me, replying with a warmth I hadn‚Äôt seen in years.

‚ÄòI‚Äôll always love you, Cara.‚Äô

I replayed the video over and over, tears streaming down my face. As dusk fell, the room around me grew dim.

Daniel finally came home. His voice was gentle as he lightly scolded me, ‚ÄúOlivia, why didn‚Äôt you turn on the lights? It‚Äôs so dark! What if you fall?‚Äù

He flipped the light switch, and the room lit up. I quickly covered my tear‚Äìstreaked face as he knelt in front of me and took my hand.

‚ÄúWhy are you crying? Who made my precious wife and our little one so sad?‚Äù he asked, his voice soft as he kissed my belly.

As he leaned closer, I smelled the same sweet jasmine fragrance. Struggling to keep calm, I asked, ‚ÄúWhere were you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was working late at the office. What‚Äôs wrong, honey?‚Äù Daniel replied casually, as though nothing was out of the ordinary..

‚ÄòYou‚Äôre lying, Daniel. You were with Cara! She had a craving for those famous dumplings from the east side of the city, and since there was no delivery, you drove over an hour from the west side to get them for her. She even live‚Äìstreamed the whole thing!‚Äò

Feigning nonchalance, I smiled, gently squeezing his hand. ‚ÄúHoney, I suddenly have a craving for those dumplings from the east side, too,‚Äù I said, resting my hands on my belly.

As if sensing my pain, the baby kicked hard. ‚ÄúCan you get some for me?‚Äù

Annoyance flickered across Daniel‚Äôs face as he pulled his hand away, frustration creeping into his expression. ‚ÄúThose dumplings aren‚Äôt anything special. Besides, you‚Äôre pretty far along. You should watch what you eat.‚Äù Standing up, he added, ‚ÄúFor the sake of our son, just bear with it a little longer, okay?‚Äù

Without waiting for a response, he muttered, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to take a shower. I‚Äôm exhausted. Why don‚Äôt you call Mom and ask her to make you something?‚Äù

The bathroom door clicked shut.

Swallowing my sobs, I gently stroked my belly and whispered, ‚ÄúOh, sweetheart, you and I are about to fight a tough battle together.‚Äù

Chapter 2

Daniel‚Äôs phone blinked on the dining table. As usual, he never even tried to hide his infidelity in front of me.

Did he really think I was that na√Øve?

The sound of water running in the bathroom echoed through the house. With a sigh, I struggled with my pregnant belly and slowly stood up. Hoping for a quick solution, I tried all the obvious. passwords from our wedding anniversary and our birthdays, but none of them worked. My hands trembled as I entered the date from Cara‚Äôs ultrasound report.

Success!

Biting my lip in frustration, I sneered as I opened the messaging app‚Äôs storage. Sure enough, Cara‚Äôs profile picture was there. Their avatars matched.

He said, ‚ÄúIf love lasts forever,‚Äù and she replied, ‚ÄúDoes it matter if we‚Äôre together every day?‚Äù

I clicked into the chat and was greeted by a flood of ‚ÄúDarling, I miss you‚Äù and ‚ÄúBaby, when will I see you again?‚Äù Determined not to let my emotions take over, I activated the screen recording feature.

Next, I opened Daniel‚Äôs shopping app. To my dismay, his order history was filled with pregnancy supplements, skincare products, and makeup. They were all sent to the same address. Every delivery was made to Cara.

With one hand resting on my restless baby, I took screenshots with the other. I sent the videos and screenshots to myself, then carefully deleted the evidence. Satisfied that everything was in order, I placed the phone back exactly where I‚Äôd found it.

Waddling back to the bedroom, I lay down on my side. The weight of betrayal settled over me as my heart felt like it had a hole ripped. through it, and I couldn‚Äôt stop shivering from the cold weight of betrayal. After seven years of marriage, I had been reduced to a cruel joke.

When Daniel came out of the shower, his phone rang. From my vantage point, through the crack in the door, I saw his face soften as he answered the call. Glancing toward the bedroom, he carefully stepped out onto the balcony, closing the door behind him.

Curiosity gnawing at me, I forced myself up and stood by the door, watching him. I couldn‚Äôt make out the words, but his expression was tender, with a slight smile. At some point, whoever was on the other end must have said something that made him frown in discomfort. But soon enough, he caved, agreeing with a subtle smile.

The chill in my chest deepened. Slowly, I turned and dragged myself back to bed, feeling as if the air had been sucked out of the room. Even breathing felt like a burden.

A few minutes later, I heard Daniel tiptoe back inside. One of his. hands rested on my belly while the other gently brushed the hair from my forehead.

His voice was soft as he whispered, ‚ÄúBaby, there‚Äôs an urgent project at work. I need to go in.‚Äù

I turned my head and stared deeply into his eyes. My last shred of hope flickered weakly as I asked, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel well. Could you stay?‚Äù

For a brief moment, I thought that if he chose to stay with me instead of running to her, I could try to forgive him.

But then I remembered: Once the kite string snaps, it can never be fixed.

As expected, Daniel gave me a troubled smile, trying to reassure me. ‚ÄúSweetheart, this project is essential for the company. Lean‚Äôt miss it.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call Mom to come over and stay with you, okay?‚Äù

A wave of nausea washed over me, goosebumps prickling my skin. Still, I managed to force out the words, ‚ÄúDrive safely.‚Äù

I lay there in silence, watching him get dressed and leave. Slowly, I got up, holding my belly, and made my way downstairs to hail a taxi. ‚ÄúMaplewood Estates,‚Äù I told the driver.

He sped through the streets, and just as we arrived, I saw Daniel‚Äôs car pull in. My stomach clenched as I asked the driver to park behind a tree. From the back seat, I watched as Cara fluttered into Daniel‚Äôs arms like a butterfly.

He caught her gently, placing a hand on her flat stomach. His face softened with a look of tender reproach, and he playfully tapped her nose.

Cradling my belly with one hand, I took out my phone and switched to video mode. With trembling fingers, I watched through the screen as Daniel lifted Cara into the passenger seat and carefully buckled her seatbelt.

My eyes burned, but I blinked back the tears.

‚ÄúDriver, follow that car,‚Äù I said.

The car climbed onto the overpass, neon lights flashing by outside the window. In a daze, my nails dug into the window frame until they split, the sharp pain snapping me back to reality. I put my bleeding fingers into my mouth and bit down hard.

As the car wove through the city streets, I repeated to myself repeatedly, ‚ÄúOlivia, endure it. The pain will pass.‚Äù

When we arrived at Riverside General Hospital, I scanned the QR code to pay the driver.

As I stepped out of the car, the usually quiet driver turned to me and said, with unexpected kindness, ‚ÄúMiss, take care of yourself. For the baby‚Äôs sake, don‚Äôt hurt yourself.‚Äù

Since discovering Daniel‚Äôs affair, I hadn‚Äôt told a soul. The secret felt like poison, slowly eating away at me from the inside. The kindness of a stranger felt like a fresh breath of air, pulling me back from the abyss.

I gently closed the car door, offering him a small smile. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, Sir. No‚Äìone can hurt me anymore. Because I‚Äôm ready to throw the trash where it belongs.‚Äù

Chapter 3

I hid behind a pillar, watching Daniel. He had been too busy with work to attend a single prenatal check‚Äìup with me during my entire pregnancy. Yet here he was, running around the hospital, registering, picking up medication, and gently helping another woman in and out like the perfect husband.

At that moment, I realized it wasn‚Äôt that he was too busy. He didn‚Äôt want to make an effort for the wife he‚Äôd been married to for seven years.

In the bustling hospital lobby, Daniel held the woman close, reminding her, ‚ÄúThe doctor said you should eat less tonight and try to stay active. In the early stages of pregnancy, digestion can be tricky, so let‚Äôs follow the advice this time, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúAww, fine, I got it!‚Äù she replied, pouting playfully. But it‚Äôs your fault! You bought way too many dumplings.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, alright, I‚Äôll take the blame,‚Äù he said with a smile. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my fault. for making my sweetheart eat too much, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs better.‚Äù She smirked. ‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôll forgive you‚Ä¶ this time.‚Äù

As I watched them, they bantered like a real couple, close and inseparable, while I stood under the hospital‚Äôs harsh fluorescent lights, feeling like an intruder in my own life. I was invisible to them. With a heavy heart, I held my belly and slowly shuffled out of the hospital. Outside, the scene was no less cruel. The rain had started. The cold autumn wind blew against me, and the rain felt like it was trying to drown the world in its chill. Through the mist, I watched as Daniel draped his coat over her, shielding her from the rain and gently helping her into the front passenger seat.

The woman smiled up at him, grabbing his tie and pulling him in for a kiss. My husband cupped her face and kissed her deeply right there in the rain. When they finally pulled apart, he tapped her nose playfully, and she tugged on his tie again, biting his lip hard.

To my surprise, instead of getting upset, he just smiled like he was

thrilled. Then, he got into the car. As the car was about to pull away, the woman rolled down the window, locking eyes with me.

She gave me a smug, taunting look and said, ‚ÄúOlivia, you‚Äôve lost.‚Äù

I smiled and shook my head. A strange calm washed over me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, Olivia.‚Äù

Then, I whispered to myself, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just a man, nothing more.‚Äù

As the car turned the corner, I waved. ‚ÄúDaniel, I don‚Äôt want you anymore. You‚Äôre hers.‚Äù

In that decisive moment, standing under the hospital awning, I calmly sent all the evidence I had gathered to my mentor, a well‚Äìknown divorce lawyer. I was going to secure the best future for my child, no matter what.

By the time I finished, the rain had already soaked the hem of my dress. Oddly enough, I barely noticed. Just as I put my phone away, it rang.

It was Mom.

‚ÄúOlivia, I made some soup for you and brought it to the house. Where are you and Danny? Why aren‚Äôt you home?‚Äù Her voice was filled with warmth and concern.

Before I could respond, she continued, ‚ÄúOh, that Danny. You‚Äôre this far along, and he‚Äôs still taking you out? You really need to be careful right now.‚Äù

Hearing my mom‚Äôs voice felt like a blow, like opening a floodgate I had been trying so hard to keep closed. All the pain I had been holding in grew into an overwhelming weight, pressing down on my chest. I bit down hard on my lip, fighting back the sob rising in my throat. The pain of suppressing it sent a shiver through my entire body.

‚ÄúMom, don‚Äôt worry,‚Äù I said, forcing a smile even though she couldn‚Äôt see me.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just out having dinner.‚Äù I swallowed hard, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúOh, we‚Äôre being careful. Danny‚Äôs right here with me.‚Äù

I had to keep it together. I couldn‚Äôt let my mom hear me cry. I wouldn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs raining, Mom. Drive home safely, okay? Text me when you get there.‚Äù

I hung up quickly before my voice could betray me. Once the call ended, I took a deep breath and tried to hold everything in, but no matter how hard I tried, the tears finally spilled over. I cried quietly, my body trembling under the weight of it all.

There I stood, a heavily pregnant woman, belly aching, surrounded by strangers coming and going from the hospital. And in that cold, indifferent world, I cried until I had no more tears left in me.

Chapter 4

Daniel didn‚Äôt come home that night. Instead, he only sent a text:

‚ÄòHey Olivia, I‚Äôm working late tonight and crashing into the office. It‚Äôs getting cold and rainy, so don‚Äôt forget to close the window before bed. Love you always, your husband.‚Äò

I read the message without feeling anything. In the past, I would have worried, replied, or waited for Daniel. Now, I didn‚Äôt even bother to respond. I used to think I was the happiest woman in the world because I had the best husband. But reality hit me hard. It had all been a ridiculous facade. People‚Äôs hearts are hidden behind their ribs, and their lies are scribbled on paper.

A few days later, I received the divorce papers my lawyer had drafted. I printed them out, signed my name, and started packing up my things to move back to my mom‚Äôs place. Just as I was getting ready to leave, my phone rang with an unknown number.

It was Cara.

We met at a caf√© downstairs. Cara arrived with an air of confidence, sitting across from me with a smug smile, a supermarket shopping bag by her side. Three months pregnant and balancing on thin high heels, she looked at me as if she had already won.

‚ÄúI thought you wouldn‚Äôt come,‚Äù she said, a smug lilt in her voice. ‚ÄúAfter all, you never replied to my messages.‚Äù

I smiled calmly. My heart was steady, not a flicker of emotion breaking through. ‚ÄúWhy wouldn‚Äôt I come? I haven‚Äôt done anything shameful that I need to hide.‚Äù I leaned back, still smiling. ‚ÄúBesides, Daniel and I are legally married, so I have nothing to hide. Unlike some people who, no matter how hard they try, will always be the hidden third.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou-!‚Äù she snapped, but I cut her off again.

‚ÄúOh, and thank you, by the way,‚Äù I said, my voice steady. ‚ÄúFor sending me all the evidence of your little affair with Daniel. Collecting all that would‚Äôve been much harder on my own.‚Äù

I smiled, this time more dismissively. ‚ÄúSo, this coffee‚Äôs on me.‚Äù

I placed some cash under my cup, stood up slowly, and rested my hand on my belly.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean by that?‚Äù she asked through clenched teeth as she grabbed my arm.

‚ÄúIt means I don‚Äôt want him anymore, I replied, pulling my arm free. ‚ÄúIf you want him, he‚Äôs all yours.‚Äù

Her eyes narrowed, and she threw my arm aside angrily. ‚ÄúWhat game are you playing now? Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm buying this for a second!‚Äù

The force of her shove sent me stumbling backward, and I fell to the floor. At that moment, it felt like a knife had ripped through my belly. Pain shot through me, and I felt my body convulsed.

Blood poured from between my legs, and I screamed in terror, ‚ÄúSave my baby!‚Äù

I barely registered Cara fleeing in panic. Forcing myself to stay calm, I asked the caf√© staff to call an ambulance. By the time they lifted me into the ambulance, my dress was drenched in blood.

As my consciousness began to slip away, I heard a nurse asking for my phone password. I unlocked it for her, and they called my emergency contact, my husband, six times.

Finally, he picked up on the last call.",1,1755530516.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

Part 2,"Hey r/coldbrew again, i just made my second cold brew with same honduras mocha beans. medium-light roast, whiskey barrel fermented. big whiskey flavor. Total newbie here. just sharing what i did and hoping for some advice.

i used my Gevi brewone's built-in grinder on the french press setting. Last time, I used the Comandante C40 to grind. Honestly, for cold brew‚Äôs coffee dose (40g), an electric grinder is way easier than manual. At least my hand isn‚Äôt exhausted this time. this time i wasn‚Äôt such a shambles. The built-in scale & grinder really saved me a lot of time, especially on a busy morning. and the grinder‚Äôs height is just right for the cold brew maker, i don‚Äôt have to spend so much time pouring the grounds anymore, since the funnel that comes with the mhw-3bomer is honestly a pain to use.

i did same 40g coffee to 600ml water. 1:15 ratio.And started with a hot bloom like pourover ‚Äî about 40ml water for about 40 seconds ‚Äî then added cold water and put it in the fridge for 20 hours.

This time, the brew was still smooth, but not as silky as the all-cold method. I could definitely taste more acidity, even overpowering the whiskey-like flavor.But the coffee aroma is much stronger than the first time. For me, I prefer the all-cold way for this coffee bean. And I think hot bloom suits light roast beans better, and I‚Äôd probably cut the steep time a bit.

Does anyone know if the hot bloom method still counts as cold brew? Honestly, this batch tasted kinda like pourover coffee with iceü§î.",2,1755530453.0,coldbrew,6,0.6,False

But in 2025, a few clear patterns are emerging, and they all connect to one thing we often overlook: **the quality of our water**.

# 1. Longevity & Biohacking 

People are searching for ways to extend their healthspan, not just lifespan. From supplements to fasting, biohackers are optimizing everything ‚Äî and hydration is at the core. **Clean, mineral-rich water** supports cellular function, energy, and recovery in ways coffee or energy drinks never could.

# 2. Gut Health & Digestion 

We‚Äôve learned the gut impacts everything ‚Äî immunity, mood, even brain health. But chlorine, heavy metals, and PFAS in tap water disrupt gut balance. More people are realizing that what you *drink* matters as much as what you *eat*.

# 3. Sustainable Wellness 

Plastic bottled water is falling out of favor. Consumers are choosing home systems that are both eco-friendly and health-supportive. That‚Äôs where companies like **AlkaViva** come in ‚Äî providing advanced filtration that reduces plastic waste while delivering healthier hydration.

# 4. Immune Support 

Post-pandemic, immune health remains a top priority. Hydration is often the ‚Äúhidden‚Äù immune booster, helping detoxify the body and transport nutrients. Families are upgrading to safer, cleaner water sources to protect long-term health.

# 5. Skin & Beauty From Within 

Beauty isn‚Äôt just about serums and creams ‚Äî hydration shows up in your skin. Dermatologists increasingly stress drinking high-quality water to fight premature aging and dryness. Many AlkaViva customers report **more radiant skin** after switching.

# Why Water Is the Common Thread

It‚Äôs no surprise that hydration is finally taking center stage in health. Clean water impacts every trend above ‚Äî from longevity to gut health to beauty.

For 20+ years, **AlkaViva** has helped families hydrate with **advanced UltraWater filtration and alkaline ionized water**. In 2025, as health trends evolve, one truth remains: **better water = better health**.

üåô **Gemini Moon Turns the Volume Up - Then Slips into Cancer**

The day starts quick and buzzy under a Gemini Moon: talkative, curious, ideas flying everywhere. But here‚Äôs the twist - from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. EDT, we‚Äôre in a Moon Alert. Translation? Great time to brainstorm, NOT the time to make big decisions or splurge (unless it‚Äôs coffee or food - the universe approves those).
By late afternoon, the Moon drifts into Cancer and the vibe flips - suddenly it‚Äôs less ‚Äúchatty chaos,‚Äù more ‚Äúcozy feels.‚Äù Expect cravings for comfort, nostalgia or curling into your shell.

‚∏ª

‚ö° **Saturn & Neptune vs. the Moon - Emotional Whiplash**

Once the Moon settles in Cancer, it runs head-on into Saturn and Neptune. Think: stern reality checks clashing with dreamy illusions. The result? Emotional tension, fuzzy feelings, maybe even a mini identity wobble. If you feel torn between ‚ÄúI should‚Äù and ‚ÄúI wish,‚Äù you‚Äôre tuned in perfectly. Ride the waves - clarity is brewing underneath.

‚∏ª

üî• **Mercury + Mars = Bold Words, Fast Moves**

Amid the mood swings, Mercury sextiles Mars - the cosmic caffeine shot. Suddenly conversations spark, decisions sharpen and motivation kicks in. Use this window to say what needs saying, pitch the wild idea or just get stuff DONE. The key? Be bold, but strategic - not every fire needs gasoline.

‚∏ª

üçÄ **Sun Aligns with the Moon - Luck Arrives for Taurus, Leo & Sagittarius**

Today also carries a streak of cosmic fortune, especially for these three signs. Doors open, synchronicities line up and opportunities feel a little too perfectly timed. Say yes when the universe offers.

‚∏ª

‚ú® **Cosmic Takeaway:**

Today is a cosmic mood ring: buzzing Gemini ideas, a dramatic Cancer mood swing, a clash of reality and dreams and then-bam-clarity, when you least expect it. It‚Äôs a rollercoaster, but one that ends with breakthroughs and lucky openings. Keep your heart soft, your mind sharp and your energy ready to pivot.

1mtp0jv,https://i.redd.it/9tmh7in8psjf1.jpeg,Trying out the new Terre d'Hermes Eau De Parfum Intense,"Ooh this one's an interesting one. This is Terre d'Hermes's latest release this year and is a ""flanker"" of their iconic classic. But don't let that fool you. This is quite different.

Top notes: Bergamot, Black Pepper

Middle notes: Coffee, Licorice

Base notes: Woody notes, Lava Stone

Very interesting list of notes compared to the original. But I think if this is to be reviewed fairly it should be treated as a completely different fragrance from the TdH EDT, or even their Parfum for that matter. You get an overall green and dirty woody profile all around, but there's a prominent licorice note that permeates the whole experience, especially in the opening and the mid.

The coffee note is also very present between the opening and the mid, it's not sweet or creamy but it has a certain roasted and bitter woody element to it. All of that is accompanied by the citrusy bergamot that then settles into a peppery, woody, and slightly warm fragrance. The mid to dry down also has a distinct mineral-y base to the other notes, which I can only assume is provided by the lava stone note. I don't know how they managed that, but it's pretty interesting.

Part of it certainly stays faithful to the Terre d'Hermes DNA, but I feel like they tried to go a different direction with this, especially since Christine Nagel is the perfumer behind this. This pays some respect to the original DNA masterminded by Jean-Claude Ellena but also attempts to create its own sort of path. Ellena, of course, left Hermes in 2016 and Christine Nagel shortly replaced him as Hermes's in-house perfumer.

I have to say, it's bold. A very bold move. Because I imagine this can be quite a polarising release. This is definitely a ""try before you buy"" type of fragrance. And even if you're a fan of the TdH DNA, this isn't a guarantee you'll vibe with this. While a lot of it stays true to the DNA, a lot also takes a completely different direction. Performance is pretty impressive but it's nothing over the top. I get an average of 8ish hours on skin with fairly decent projection for the first few. It's not loud and obnoxious though which is nice. 

This feels like an all year round wear imo. There's no specific time of year. Maybe fall and spring depending on where you live I guess, but honestly who cares about that? If you like something, wear it whenever you like to. Overall, I like this one. But I don't think I could make it a sort of signature scent for me because I'm usually not a huge fan of licorice. But this is masterfully blended like pretty much all of TdH's other releases. Not sure how this fragrance will perform and hold up to the other house staples over time, but that's something we'll have to wait for and see.",7,1755530415.0,FragranceStories,0,1.0,False

This is really just a vent I guess as I cry into my cold coffee. My friends try and help but I don‚Äôt think they truly understand the extent of it. 

I‚Äôm fortunate where a lot of my friends have had children at the same time as me and it seems like I have drawn the short straw. My baby is quite honestly HARD work and has been since day 1.

I‚Äôm not talking a bit of whining or a tough sleeper. I‚Äôm talking 0-60 crying, at anything or everything. 

We have glimmers of hope but he could be fed, dry, rested and still tears pour from his eyes. We‚Äôve been to the doctors and he is perfectly healthy. I‚Äôm just at an absolute loss as to what to do or how to cope with day to day life.

He‚Äôs not a Velcro baby, that‚Äôs not even the issue. He doesn‚Äôt want to be picked up or put down. He might be happy for 2-5 minutes with a toy or in a bouncer and then it‚Äôs back to crying. 
We used to find he was better outside of the house but today we went to the farm and he literally cried the entire time, not even the new surroundings distracted him. 

I‚Äôve left so many outings with friends in floods of tears myself because my son had cried the entire time. 

He might nap for 20 minutes in his pram and then someone will try and be helpful by saying ‚Äòthere you go he was tired‚Äô but nope, he will wake up and cry again. Same with bottles etc.

I thought it was frustration by not moving, or teething or ear infections but actually in reality it‚Äôs just his temperament and I just don‚Äôt want to do it anymore.

1mtoyq0,https://i.redd.it/3ye5ec25msjf1.jpeg,Pre fledging greenfinch that my baby cousin brought home,"Hello everyone and thank you in advance for any help that you can provide. 

I am from Lisbon, Portugal and my young cousin found this pre fledging greenfinch and unfortunately had the good intentioned but awful idea of taking it home. 

Once I found out, I got the bird and bought a bird cage, took him outside to see if the parents would come to find it and repeated this for several days, for hours on time, but no birds came. I can hear the greenfinches in the trees but I also know that they don't tend to come down much. I contacted the only rescue here but they aren't taking any birds that aren't endangered because of funding issues. I had no choice but to keep it home.

The bird has been with me for 9 days now. The photo was from the third day that he was with me, he has since gotten all of his plumage. I bought nutribird 21 and have been feeding it to him every two to three hours. I bought him seeds that I have scattered all over a room that I left for him full of spots where he can land and fly to (and he has been doing so). He loves resting on that doll that I have hanged in my room and on a little nest that is higher up as well. He eats well, is intrigued by the seeds I leave him and also by arugula leaves that I got him but he does not swallow anything yet, he flies really well without hurting himself and I play him greenfinch audios that he reacts to. I think he is around 20-25 days old now, from what I have researched. 

Now what I'm most worried about is him imprinting on me and on releasing him. 

I have always fed him with a coffee spoon, do not talk to him, leave him alone in the room for the most part and have never cuddled with him. Yet, he chirps when I arrive in the room and he is hungry (otherwise he doesn't chirp, I don't hear him chirp very much at all despite him being very active and curious, doesn't seem anxious either, just a young happy bird. He might chirp and I just don't hear it because I really try to not be around him much.) and although he mostly flies to higher areas in the room, he does occasionally fly to my head or shoulder. 

I do not want to keep the bird, for obvious reasons, as for I am not a cruel person, but I wanted some advice on what do to for his best chances of survival and to avoid imprinting. 

I live on the 6th floor of an appartement in a urban area, I don't have a garden or anything, just a balcony that isn't closed off and that doesn't really have much of a view to the outside. I saw somewhere that I should take him, inside of the bird cage, to the balcony so it can get used to the wind and nature sounds. Also to take him, inside of the cage, to where I know the other greenfinches are so he can hear them and be closer to nature.

Any tips on what to do? I've been doing a lot of research but learning directly from people could be helpful. I really want the little guy to prosper and am willing to do anything that ensures that. I'm on vacation from work and am willing to dote myself as much as I can to him (whilst ensuring that he remains wild).

In this watery simulation of an episode, Matt and Chris uncover the true purpose of Scott Adams‚Äô existence: not to shape reality, but to provide training data for future AIs working on plumbing-related problems. Somewhere in a cosmic server farm, Scott is endlessly confronted with blocked drains, dripping faucets, and municipal water conspiracies, while his ‚Äúinsights‚Äù fuel the next generation of household maintenance bots.

Against this surreal backdrop, Naval Ravikant enters the scene ‚Äî investor, tweeter, self-styled philosopher, and, in practice, just another discourse surfer riding the waves of online conspiracism. The conversation opens with a familiar chorus of right-wing talking points, drifts into feverish speculation about lawfare, censorship, and ‚Äúimported voters,‚Äù and finally winds down in the dim light of dorm-room metaphysics, where slogans like ‚Äúhappiness is a choice‚Äù are served up as if they were profound insights.

Naval presents himself as a detached sage, offering a boutique blend of political commentary and Daoist-tinged wisdom. In reality, he delivers little more than predictable polemics and recycled aphorisms. Imagining himself a great man of history dispensing lyrical truths in tweet-sized form, he produces nothing that rises above the usual culture-war debris. The posture is Buddha-with-a-smartphone; the reality is a credulous tech elite mistaking his own Twitter feed for a philosophy seminar.

What follows is Elon-as-Ben-Franklin fanboying, Trump rebranded as a ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù leader of the people, and a level of self-congratulation so thick it could be used to terraform Mars. By the end, you may find yourself nostalgic for the leaky pipes in Scott‚Äôs simulation ‚Äî at least they produce real water...

Sorry for the long paragraph haha but I always had this question. My nmom has been with her bf for a little over 10 years. 
Now, I posted about him and him SA (sexually assaulting) me in this thread before and my mom knowing about it and how it affects me. But why didn‚Äôt she leave? 

Her bf is like that to almost every woman in the house (except my grandma). He even threatened to slap my aunt (even tho it was said in a joking manner, it still bothered her). At one point, in the same day he even screamed at my mom because his coffee was cold. This happened VERY frequently (like a few times a week, especially when we came by my grandmas 
house in the weekend).

The abuse was never physical towards her, only towards me, a thing that she seem to not care about, until it came to her. 
She would let him scream at her, threaten to beat her etc. than complain to me or my aunt which really bothered me. 
Me and my aunt always said the same thing ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you leave‚Äù and she would always make up some lame excuse.
Could it be Stockholm syndrome? Could it be something more? 

Again, the abuse never seemed to bother her when it came to me. Even if I cried, even if i yelled back. She would just brush it off, or sometimes even hit me for responding back to her bf. 

I hate it, and I wish that we would just leave, but she always brushes me off. Her bf even threatened to kick me out the apartment because I was being disrespectful (I didn‚Äôt want him to touch me without my consent) and my mom ACTUALLY agreed to it and even PACKED ME A BAG and threw me out the apartment, and I ended up sleeping at a TEACHERS HOUSE (since I don‚Äôt have any friends and my grandparents live in a different city from us).

What finally worked for me was lowering the pressure.

Might feel awkward at first, but those little things adds up way more than any big plan. People love when you jus task them be it for any small thing, that act of kindness is welcoming and makes people feel included.

And honestly? It goes likewise for other people, People love helping you. Ask your neighbor for their biryani recipe or get music recs from someone with good taste. Ask them to share their playlists.

I would personally label myself as demisexual, although some online tests would tag me as cupiosexual. I want to mention upfront that you could classify me as a neurodivergent individual, since I probably have some sort of autism-spectrum disorder - you won't notice it much but it could be a possible explanation for why I can be weird from time (this shouldn't be an excuse by the way) Since we got that out of the way, *let us dive more into my persona*

¬†

***My persona***

I live in Central Europe, so due to my origin I'm able to speak German as well as English which I have learned in school. I'm of Caucasian ethnicity, I have white skin, an average build at a height of 175 cm (or 5 ft 9 in) have medium-short brown hair on top, green-grey eyes with glasses on rare occasions & a short stubble face to round things off

¬†

***My lifestyle***

My occupation is something I can be very passionate about & really enjoy on a deep basis. When I'm not active due to work, I love to be active in my free time by going to the gym, going for a run or biking for example. Something I like to pair these activities with is listening to music or to a good podcast, but I usually prefer to watch podcasts rather than just listen to them. During the day I really love to drink a good cup of coffee somewhere or at home, so one day I will definitely buy myself a barista coffee machine. Currently I live on an omnivore diet - I like to cook & try different recipes. Next to that I have interests in psychology, philosophy, medicine, health & science to name a few

¬†

***My preferences***

I'm here looking for a female who is open to a long-term relationship aged between 18 - 28 max, though my absolute upper limit is 30. Preferably from Europe, but I'm also open to the UK or the US. Someone who is able to participate in a normal conversation & is emotionally available. Last but not least, someone who looks after their health & therefore has no emotional (lingering) baggage & maintains a rational normal weight

I'm in my mid 30's. I currently live in NYC. I moved here from Nashville late last year to pursue acting but I am a bartender by trade. Originally from Baltimore, moved to Nash to bartend and save a ton of money to move to NYC as it is super expensive. I was successful in Nashville, I made a lot of money in 2 years time, was able to afford my own place in nyc and ended up with almost 6 months worth of savings to live off of while I pursued acting and looked for a job. The hospitality scene has changed all over the country and that's what has me at this impasse. It was HARD to find a job here. Unless you're friends with a bar manager or family or something, it's damn near impossible. I finally found a job but its awful. Its on a rooftop, it's hot as hell, we make no money because its so overstaffed all the time and it's like that everywhere. Now I'm realizing it's like that everywhere (Austin, Vegas, LA, everywhere) and leaving Nashville when I did may have been good for me despite me and my dog having a really great life there. To watch our little life slowly crash and burn because of the current state of things would have been maddening. My dog, he's everything to me and giving him a good life is one of my highest priorities. In Nashville he was beloved by the community, he was a celebrity and got to go everywhere with me. But, from what i've heard, Nashville is becoming oversaturated just like here and every other city. Even broadway bartenders, who used to clear 8-10k a month, are struggling to make ends meet. And that brings me to the shift. People just aren't going out like they used to and when they do, they're not drinking much and they certainly aren't tipping. I understand tipping culture is getting out of hand but there's a difference between a coffee shop cashier (not even the barista) expecting 30% for flipping around a tablet, and being tipped $5 on a $250 tab after I just made you and your 13 friends espresso martinis, green tea shots and kept your waters refilled.

  
I'm worried this is a growing trend and it's not going to change. But I love bartending. I love making drinks, I love the rush, I love being a part of someones overall experience, making something that tastes great and something they'll remember. It's become all I've known over the last 8 years. Everyone in my life is suggesting different things and wants different things for me. My dad thinks I should stick it out here in NYC and keep pursuing my acting dreams (we all know how hard that is to break into the acting scene if you have absolutely 0 connections). Mom wants me to move back to Nashville because I was living so high on the hog down there, but like i said,  things have changed rapidly in just 9 months since I left. Some of my friends and family would like to see me move back to Maryland and settle down. Bear in mind, all of my friends and family are in Maryland. I've made a few friends here in NYC but beyond that I have no roots anywhere but Maryland. 

I guess I'm just lost here. I don't have any degrees. I've been a musician all my life but thats the same uphill struggle as acting. I can't do office/9-5 work, I did it long enough in my 20's to know its the fast train to a nervous breakdown. Do I stay here in NYC and continue to try to find that silver tuna of a bartending gig? Do i go back to Nashville and hope I can make similar-ish money to what I was making? Do I go back to Baltimore and pursue something there? My best friend back in Maryland wants to start a business but we are in very different situations. He's got a family, a fiance and a child, a mortgage. All the trappings that would keep him from taking the risks needed to even make a run at a successful business. I will say, I added up all my paychecks from the 2 years I was in Nashville and between 2023 and 2024, there was a sharp $15,000 drop in what I made in 2024 compared to 2023. I have a feeling if I were there this year, I would have seen another substantial drop. Despite my employer in Nashville telling me I always had a job there if I wanted to come back, is it worth going back to a guaranteed job if that job no longer affords you the life you had? And Maryland will always be my home sweet home and I love it there, but there's very little upward trajectory there. It's almost as expensive as New York and the job market is incredibly lean. My fantasy life has me retiring early there but that'd only be if I were successful in acting/music.

1mtodq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1mtodq1/does_brensten_pack_of_6_charcoal_water_filters/,Does BRENSTEN Pack of 6 Charcoal Water Filters Improve Coffee Taste Review?,"Testing out the BRENSTEN B09Z64RMT7 Replacement Charcoal Water Filters has been quite an experience, and I'll share every little detail with you here. These filters are designed to be compatible with Keurig 2.0 coffee makers and certain Keurig single-cup brewers. If you're a coffee lover like me, you know how crucial great-tasting water is for that morning cup of bliss. This is where the pack of six charcoal water filters steps up to improve both the coffee's aroma and longevity of your brewer.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Straight out of the packaging, the filters feel sturdy and well-constructed. Each filter has precise dimensions of approximately 2-1/8"" x 1-1/4"" x 1-1/4"". I like that the charcoal material feels dense but carefully engineered to allow for proper flow. They aren't flimsy in the slightest, which is great because I‚Äôve seen cheaper alternatives break apart when soaked in water. The basket-shaped design fits effortlessly into Keurig machines, particularly the 2.0 series. I didn't deal with any compatibility issues, which was a definite bonus.

**Ease of Installation**  
Not everyone has time in the morning to wrangle with complicated setups, and this product gets it right. The ease of installation was impressive. Within moments of unpacking, you just follow a simple rinse-and-insert routine, and you're good to go. My sister-in-law, who's notorious for giving up on intricate gadgets, tried these filters and managed it without a hitch. I‚Äôve also noticed no leaks or poorly fitting components, a problem I‚Äôve faced with cheaper filters.

**Positives**  
- Helps reduce chlorine, calcium, and other impurities for better-tasting coffee.
- Easy installation and user-friendly design.
- Prolongs the lifespan of Keurig brewers by preventing mineral buildup.
- Packaged in a set of six, offering a good amount for longer use.  
[Time to see BRENSTEN B09Z64RMT7 cost on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b09z64rmt7/)

**Performance**  
One thing I can't stand is coffee tainted by funky-tasting water. Using these filters, I immediately noticed an improvement in the flavor and aroma of my cup. It‚Äôs the small things‚Äîlike removing chlorine and minerals‚Äîthat make an enormous difference. I brewed my coffee every morning over two weeks, and every cup tasted as fresh as the first. These filters are recommended for use after 60 tank refills or roughly 60 days, and I think that lifespan is reasonable considering their quality. The charcoal does its job well without reducing water flow.

**Downsides**  
- Not compatible with Cuisinart models, which limits its versatility.
- The filters are slightly more expensive compared to off-brand options.
- No visual indicator to remind users when replacement is due.

**Market Rivals**  
When comparing this product with other water filter options on the market, such as the Maxtra Water Filter Cartridges or PUR filters, there are clear advantages and trade-offs. While the Maxtra filters offer a more universal fit across different machines, I've found their performance inconsistent when tested with Keurig brewers. Alternatively, PUR filters are excellent for water filtration but might not fit seamlessly within Keurig systems, especially the newer Keurig 2.0 series. BRENSTEN filters fill this niche perfectly for Keurig owners, offering solid performance and an ergonomic design. Yet, when price is the sole consideration, budget-conscious buyers might lean toward generic brands despite their lower quality.

**Key Benefits**  
- Fits Keurig 2.0 and newer single-reservoir brewers flawlessly.
- Works excellently to maintain optimal water quality for improved taste.
- Offers durability and consistent performance.  

**Cost Effectiveness**  
The financial side of these filters deserves a closer look. Unlike bulkier, pricier options, the BRENSTEN B09Z64RMT7 sits at a reasonable price point without sacrificing quality. Each filter performs at par with higher-end models in its segment. For what it offers in terms of compatibility, water filtration, and coffee taste improvement, I'd say these filters provide great value for money. While cheaper alternatives do exist, many fail in areas like longevity and reliability.

Tin cups, seemingly simple vessels, hold a rich history and continue to be relevant in modern life. From rustic camping adventures to adding a touch of vintage charm to your home, tin cups offer durability, versatility, and a unique aesthetic. As we look to 2025, we've evaluated the top tin cups on the market, considering factors such as material quality, design, heat resistance, and overall value. Whether you're a seasoned outdoorsman or simply appreciate a classic drinking vessel, this guide will help you find the perfect tin cup to suit your needs.

[[Explore Top Rated tin cups on Amazon.]](https://site.healthytargeting.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=tin cups)

## Key Features Analysis

The modern tin cup encompasses a surprisingly diverse range of attributes. From the gauge of the steel to the application of coatings, various aspects must be considered when evaluating quality.

**Material Quality:** A high-quality tin cup is typically constructed from food-grade stainless steel, often wiht a tin plating. The thickness of the steel, measured in gauge, is crucial for durability and resistance to dents and deformation. Thicker gauges offer greater robustness,ideal for rugged outdoor use.

The quality of the tin plating also matters.A well-applied, durable tin coating will resist rust and corrosion, extending the lifespan of the cup. Look for cups with a seamless construction to prevent leaks and ensure hygiene. Some cups may feature an enameled interior for added protection and easier cleaning.

**Design and Aesthetics:** Tin cups come in various designs, ranging from classic cylindrical shapes to more modern tapered or contoured forms. The handle design is another vital aspect, influencing comfort and ease of use. A well-designed handle shoudl be securely attached, provide a comfortable grip, and stay cool to the touch when the cup contains hot liquids.

The overall finish and aesthetic appeal are also considerations.some tin cups feature a polished, shiny finish, while others have a more rustic, weathered look. Consider your personal preference and the intended use of the cup when choosing a design.

**heat Resistance and Insulation:** While tin cups are not typically designed for insulation,the material's heat conductivity is a factor to consider. Thicker-gauge steel will retain heat longer, but also become hotter to the touch. Look for cups with features like rolled rims or insulated handles to mitigate heat transfer.For situations where insulation is desired,consider tin cups with double-walled construction. These cups provide a layer of air between the inner and outer layers,substantially reducing heat loss and keeping beverages hotter for longer.

**Capacity and Size:** Tin cups are available in a range of sizes,from small espresso cups to larger mugs suited for coffee or beer. Consider your intended use when choosing a size. A smaller cup might potentially be ideal for backpacking or travel, while a larger mug is better suited for home or camping.

The dimensions of the cup are also critically important. A wide-mouthed cup is easier to fill and clean, while a narrower cup might potentially be more stable and less prone to spills.

key features of the best tin cups include:

*   Durable stainless steel construction
*   Seamless design
*   Comfortable handle
*   Variety of sizes and designs
*   Optional enamel coating

## Core Benefits

Beyond their simple design, tin cups provide a range of practical advantages over other types of drinkware.

**Durability and Longevity:** Tin cups are exceptionally durable, capable of withstanding bumps, drops, and exposure to the elements. Unlike glass or ceramic cups, they are unlikely to break, making them ideal for outdoor activities like camping, hiking, and picnics. Their robust construction ensures they can be used for years, even with heavy use.

Their resistance to rust and corrosion further enhances their longevity.A well-maintained tin cup can become a cherished piece of equipment, passed down through generations.

**Portability and Lightweight:** Tin cups are lightweight and easy to pack, making them a convenient choice for travel and outdoor adventures. Their compact size allows them to be easily stored in a backpack or camping gear. For hikers and backpackers, every ounce counts, and a tin cup offers a durable and functional alternative to heavier, more fragile drinkware.Their stackable design is an added bonus, allowing multiple cups to be stored efficiently in a small space.

**Versatility:** Tin cups are versatile and can be used for a variety of purposes beyond drinking. They can be used to heat water over a campfire, measure ingredients while cooking, or even as a small container for storing items. Their simple design makes them easy to clean and maintain, and their non-reactive surface ensures they won't impart any unwanted flavors to food or beverages.

Their classic aesthetic makes them a great addition to any home decor, adding a touch of rustic charm to any setting.

**Eco-Friendliness:** Tin cups are a sustainable alternative to disposable cups and bottles. By using a reusable tin cup, you can reduce your environmental impact and help to protect our planet. Their durability ensures they won't need to be replaced frequently, further reducing waste.

Many tin cups are made from recycled materials, making them an even more environmentally friendly choice.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common consumer questions helps clarify the suitability and usage of tin cups.

**Are tin cups safe for hot liquids?**

Yes, high-quality tin cups are generally safe for hot liquids. However, it's essential to ensure the cup is made from food-grade materials and has a durable, non-toxic coating. Be cautious when handling hot liquids, as the cup itself can become hot to the touch, especially those made from thicker gauge steel. Consider using a cup with an insulated handle or a sleeve to protect your hands.

**How do I clean and maintain a tin cup?**

Tin cups are relatively easy to clean. Hand washing with soap and water is generally recommended. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as these can scratch the surface. For stubborn stains or residue, try soaking the cup in warm water with a mild detergent. Be sure to dry the cup thoroughly after washing to prevent rust.

**Can I use a tin cup over a campfire?**

Yes, many tin cups are designed to be used over a campfire for heating water or cooking. However,it's important to choose a cup that is made from fire-resistant materials and has a sturdy construction. Avoid using cups with plastic handles or coatings, as these can melt or release harmful chemicals when exposed to high heat. When using a tin cup over a campfire, be sure to use tongs or gloves to protect your hands from burns.

In 2011, I studied abroad and went to AUT. At that time there was a coffee shop near the student housing on Symond Street that had the best lasagna. I don‚Äôt believe it was Standing Room, but was in that location. Does anyone know what or where or if that place exists? 

My second request. There use to be a Katsubi near there too. It was between AUT and Auckland Sky Tower in a store front or shopping mall type area and they have the best Katsu chicken bowl. Is that the same Katsubi that are scattered through Auckland?

My husband, I and our toddler just attended a free carnival at our local mosque. We had a fun time. I bought 2 drinks ($8 each) from a small business truck. We also paid $10 for dinner for our son which my husband and him shared as I wasn‚Äôt hungry.

We don‚Äôt attend these kind of events often, maybe once in 6 months.

I was telling my husband on the way home in the car about the small business I bought drinks from and how it‚Äôs a profitable business. I told him they do around 10-15 events a month and that‚Äôs when he asked me how much each drink costed. I said $8 (cups aren‚Äôt big, so I do agree it was a bit pricey). He was surprised they were that pricey and kept repeating in different ways about how pricey the drink was, how he feels ripped off and how he‚Äôd never pay that price for a drink. He also said ‚Äúif I knew it was that expensive, I would‚Äôve told you I didn‚Äôt want it‚Äù I said ‚Äúyeah it was a little pricey but I think it‚Äôs ok once in a while, especially since we‚Äôre supporting a small business, the carnival was free and we don‚Äôt splurge like this often. He disagreed and said ‚Äúno I don‚Äôt like being ripped off‚Äù etc etc. It might also be important to note, our household income is around $150k after taxes.

I didn‚Äôt like him going on about the price of the drink since:

A. I felt immediately guilty for buying it.

B. I‚Äôm a stay at home mom, I don‚Äôt work and often feel ‚Äúsmall‚Äù and like a burden since I don‚Äôt bring anything to the table (financially). I have brought this up to him many times too.

C. I come from a wealthy family where spending here and there on these sort of things (we always saw them as an experience) were normal; he comes from a middle class background where it was sometimes difficult to make ends meet and these things were considered extravagant and absolutely unnecessary.

We got into a little argument and I‚Äôm trying to understand his perspective but I simply can‚Äôt. He does sometimes become a ‚Äúfinancial downer‚Äù. The earliest example of that is, we went on our honeymoon (a pretty reasonable trip in the middle of COVID). We were on the road and I asked him to stop for coffee. He got really weird about it and went on about how he doesn‚Äôt understand why we need a drink for our roadtrip, it‚Äôs unreasonable to spend $6 on a drink when we can make it at home etc etc. This was the first time this had happened and I was pretty upset and seriously thought he was being overly stingy!

We‚Äôve been married 5 years and we‚Äôve had multiple clashes on how we both view money. I will honestly and openly say I do not spend crazy. I use coupons and wait for things to go on sale. I try my best to follow a budget and stay within my means. I do value money and realize it comes with a lot of hard work and shouldn‚Äôt be spent lavishly. However, because are backgrounds are so different, how I spend and how I live my life still seems excessive to him sometimes. He sometimes jokes that I‚Äôm ‚Äúhigh maintenance‚Äù and in my head, I think ‚ÄúI wish you saw a truly high maintenance woman, maybe you‚Äôd appreciate me more then‚Äù. I don‚Äôt get my nails done, I get my hair colored once a year, i probably spend around $500 a month on my myself (eating out, shopping, bare necessities).

I wanted him to just say ‚Äúoh wow that drink was pricey but yeah you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs an awesome business and they‚Äôre doing great!‚Äù Instead he just went on about how pricey the drink was and how he felt ripped off.

The whole conversation put a sour taste in my mouth and left me feeling guilty for ever spending HIS money. I feel even more useless as a SAHM; if I worked, I wouldn‚Äôt have to hear this rant about how expensive things were. I could just spend on myself how I wanted. It feels terrible to be dependent on him when he tends to weigh things solely based on how much they cost. I just wanted to have a fun time at the carnival and enjoy the experience at the carnival. It‚Äôs also important to note, it‚Äôs late August in Texas and I just wanted some refreshing drinks for us. I‚Äôm also 20 weeks pregnant with our second baby.

I do definitely want to emphasize, he doesn‚Äôt really restrict my spending, just rambles on about things being too expensive which ruins the experience. If he doesn‚Äôt actually want to control how I spend money, why even go on about things being pricey‚Ä¶also he‚Äôs a lovely husband in all other aspects. He‚Äôs a great provider, the best father I could ask for my kid. Stands up for me with in laws, is caring, kind & understanding for the most part.

What do I do? We aren‚Äôt talking for now and I wasn‚Äôt rude and neither was he. We just got into a little argument and now we‚Äôre just quiet.

I really want him to understand that sometimes it‚Äôs OKAY to splurge a bit without worrying about how much the experience costed.",5,1755528747.0,MuslimMarriage,8,0.86,False

I am unable to relate with most everyone‚Äôs problems like money, traffic, economy, wars, etc.  not as a superior being or anything - just as an impartial observer- these things have lost appeal.  The other day I was stuck in 1 hr traffic - and I was smiling for the opportunity to listen to a bit more music. That one got me somehow.

I'm looking for something to comfort me, a post that speaks to me.

I see all these true crime stories. 

I see all these world events that are going on.

I see all this celebrity gossip and entertainment news.

Like I said, it's getting really late in the evening and I should probably be asleep. 



Then all of a sudden this vampire anime woman comes up on social media and she says, ""I'm catching you doom scrolling again. Go to bed."" 

And I realize she's probably speaking to lots of people, but it really spoke to me because she was a cute woman. 



Yes, I'm single, solitary, alone.

And this cute woman, she made me feel like she was speaking directly to me.

Her message really spoke to me at a time when I needed some comfort, when I needed some empathy, when needed a woman beside me. 

And I felt like this vampire anime woman was interested in me romantically and she's going to come into my life. 

And when she says go to bed, I feel like in the future this woman's going to show me some love, some affection, some romance, even though that's probably a delusion.



I'm like, you know what? 

If the vampire anime woman tells me to go to bed, that's what I'm going to do. 

I'm going to go to bed because there's a woman out there who loves me. 



She says, ""Stop doom scrolling and just go to bed. Get your sleep. Take care of yourself. 

Eat right. Drink water. Stop drinking so much coffee. And just go to bed.

1mtnydb,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugAndProof/comments/1mtnydb/explore_if_the_best_pour_over_coffee_maker_hario/,Explore if the best pour over coffee maker Hario V60 lives up to the hype,"The Hario VD-01T Coffee Dripper has been my companion for the past few months, and I have to say, it has completely transformed my coffee brewing routine. For someone like me, who used to rely on basic coffee makers or even instant coffee, this little cone-shaped masterpiece has been an eye-opener. Brewing coffee now feels less like a chore and more like an art. If you‚Äôre even remotely into coffee, this could be a game-changer.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The clear plastic design of the coffee dripper is simple yet elegant. At first, I was skeptical about the plastic material, assuming it might cheapen the experience, but that couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. The lightweight material is sturdy and surprisingly durable. This design makes it a great option for those who travel or enjoy an outdoor coffee session. Plus, the cone shape not only looks sleek but plays a significant role in enhancing the coffee‚Äôs overall flavor profile.  

**Ease of Use**  
With its single large hole at the bottom, the dripper offers complete control over the brewing process. Adjusting the water flow speed can change the coffee profile entirely, which is an exciting feature for anyone who loves experimenting. For a newbie like my brother, the initial attempts were slightly messy since gauging the pour rate takes a little getting used to. But once you figure it out, the process becomes second nature.  

**Advantages**  
- Spiral ribs maximize coffee grounds expansion.  
- Lightweight and easy to pack for trips.  
- Budget-friendly for those new to pour-over coffee.  
- Cone shape brings out floral and fruity notes.  

**Performance and Brewing Quality**  
This small dripper consistently produces an evenly brewed cup of coffee. I tested it using various coffee grounds and grind sizes, and every single time, the cone-shaped filter worked its magic. The depth that this method adds to my coffee layer by layer is absolutely noticeable. I found it particularly great for light brews, as it had no trouble accentuating the floral and fruity notes in some of the specialty beans I tried.  

[Check Hario VD-01T Coffee Dripper price on Amazon.](https://applegreenshop.com/p/b001hc9gic/)

**Positives**  
- Enhances the intricate notes in specialty coffee beans.  
- Compact dimensions make it easy to store without cluttering the counter space.  
- High customer satisfaction, reflected in thousands of positive reviews.  

**Disadvantages**  
While the Hario dripper excels in many areas, I noticed a few quirks during regular use.  
- The dripper is not the best fit for larger quantities of coffee. Serving a group requires multiple rounds, which can be frustrating.  
- It doesn‚Äôt come with a measuring scoop or filters, so you‚Äôll need to buy those separately.  
- Plastic material feels warm to the touch only briefly; it doesn‚Äôt retain heat like ceramic alternatives.  

**Versus Product Competitors**  
Compared to ceramic drippers like the well-known Kalita Wave, the Hario VD-01T has the upper hand in portability. However, the ceramic models offer superior heat retention, a quality some coffee lovers may prefer. Another close competitor, the Chemex, delivers similarly great coffee but requires significantly more space and care due to its glass construction. The Hario version feels more accessible for everyday users while still catering to someone craving a clean coffee taste.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Considering its compact size, practical design, and ability to produce high-quality brews, this dripper punches above its weight. I‚Äôve found that it outclasses significantly pricier competitors when it comes to value. Pair it with a steady hand, some freshly ground beans, and a little patience, and the results rival those achieved with much more expensive equipment.

1mtnwgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMedical/comments/1mtnwgu/does_the_release_of_caffeine_from_fat_cells/,Does the release of caffeine from fat cells during weight loss leads to sleeplessness?,"I haven't found any studies tackling this specific thing, but have observed in myself the following phenomenon. 

I am a large guy, 6'5"", whose weight tends to fluctuate between 200 and 240 pounds. I also drink a lot of coffee. I usually polish off 3/4 of a standard carafe in the morning without much thought. Some days well into multiple 12 cup pots of coffee. We know that caffeine is able to permeate every cell in the body. When I'm eating heavily and gaining weight, I tend to have no issues sleeping, and am out cold within about four minutes of my head hitting the pillow.

What I have noticed is that when I start on a serious program of weight loss, where I have dramatically reduced my caloric intake, I have noticeable and predictable sleeplessness and insomnia.  This happenstance is standard every time I go through a weight-loss regimen.  I can't ""shut my brain off"" or get it to drift into sleep, everything is over-stimulating, the slightest noise in the room or wrinkle in the sheet can send me fidgeting for hours.  Eventually when the night is almost through, I'll finally drift to sleep at maybe 5 or 6 in the morning and get an hour before I have to be up again. 

My theory is that when I'm going to bed with a calorie deficit, that any fat cells which my body is burning are also releasing caffeine into my system, causing the sleep-lessness. Caffeine being the addictive substance that it is, the body essentially can self regulate the amount that it's getting from how much fat it starts to burn, leaving me perpetually wired.

I haven't seen any documentation on this subject, but the information that is available about what fat-soluble substances can be ""locked away"" in your adipose tissues seems to support that something like this would be possible. 

Or maybe I'm completely over-thinking it, and after going to bed hungry my body is trying to tell me, ""what are you doing trying to sleep!? We're starving over here, go look for food!""

1mtnvbj,https://i.redd.it/s3e3nvxphsjf1.jpeg,"A supervillain team in my gaming groups superhero universe, meet ‚ÄúThe Burnouts‚Äù","Right so as I have made a few posts about it before my gaming group is working on a superhero universe for tabletop called ‚ÄúD-Listers‚Äù which is a parody of the superhero genre with the gimmick being that you are playing the heroes with crappy powers or low social standing in the industry.

So we often play things for comedy, most characters are obvious parodies of iconic characters or events and as such I decided we needed a team of rival villains who could act as our Sinister Six (or Secret Six) proxy. A band of villains with unusual powers and tragic backstories. 

So with that in mind meet **the Burnouts.**

#Origins:

The origin of this team is a tragic case of corporate exploitation. The massive conglomerate Aegis, seeing all the superpowered people in the world decided to make their own homegrown superheroes that they could then use as corporate assets to compete. 

So they began experimenting and testing and came up with various ways to make superheroes then found people who were outcasts and loners, people tossed aside by society and would not be missed, to act as test subjects.

None of the test subjects were expected to be ‚Äúthe one‚Äù and most didn‚Äôt survive. But some did.

#The Members

**1: Manogator** aka Lou Briggs. Growing up dirt poor in the Louisiana Bayous, Lou endured abuse and mistreatment at the hands of his alcoholic father which ultimately drove him from home and into a life of crime. He accidentally killed a cop in a botched robbery and found himself on death row. Promised a pardon if he underwent an experimental treatment Lou underwent a gene hybridisation program designed to merge animal and human DNA to create the ultimate weapon but instead he became an inhuman reptilian monster. Now as the Manogator he is incredible strength, borderline bulletproof hide and ferocity at the cost of low intelligence and a hard to control appetite. His reptile brain is hard to control but luckily his team knows how to aim him. At times he shows signs of empathy and sad reminiscing of his past but mostly he just likes to eat raw meat.

(Originally this character was called ‚ÄúThe Piranha‚Äù and was meant to parody King Shark but we have no fish people so here we are)

**2:Yokai** aka Hoshiko Sato. She was a criminal from the Tokyo underworld who from a young age learned to spy and steal and use hand to hand combat. She was an orphan raised by a crime syndicate who sold her to Aegis like property. Through a highly experimental treatment involving dark magic and psychic abilities she became part ghost, able to phase through walls, turn invisible and create terrifying illusions, which is particular frustrating for her in light of her previous atheism. She is now a deeply cynical angry person with a deadpan blunt way of talking with a fatalist outlook that comes from knowing the afterlife is waiting for her. She is valuable for her stealth, infiltration and illusion capabilities though the last one can also cause intense trauma.

**3: Gun Saint** aka Roman Sullivan. A former marine serving in the core, a veteran of a terrible war who didn‚Äôt come back hole (and I don‚Äôt just mean his lost hand and eye). Losing his family and friends to his erratic violent behaviour he spent years trying to find salvation at the bottom of a bottle but instead found Aegis who promised they could ‚Äúfix‚Äù his mental health issues if he underwent a treatment. Being given a new hand and eye he was pumped with an experimental combat serum which turned him into the ultimate soldier. Fast, flexible and with a built in knowledge of every type of gun on sight alone. He almost would have been a success but sadly his PTSD symptoms only intensified. He was now more dangerous and more unreliable. While he could be controlled with specialised drugs it was not worth the risk and he was ordered to be detained. Today he is the deadly weapons expert and combat leader of the team but requires constant meds and anti psychotics to keep himself stable. He‚Äôs also now massively religious hence his name. 

**4: Nanyte** aka Nancy Vega. Once a teenage runaway turned homeless drug addict in her early twenties. Aegis literally found her on the street near their office when recruiting. With the promise of a new life and a chance to matter Nancy is one of the only ones recruited who didn‚Äôt do so under false pretences. She hoped to become a superhero secretly to impress Captain Evergreen, a hero who once gave her $100 dollars like it was nothing after so many people had spat at her in disgust. The company intended to fuse her with nanotechnology on a molecular level. It worked amazingly. She could create weapons and devices out of nanotech by thinking about it, her blood was nano tech, she could wield and control energy and interface with technology and she had become much more vibrant and beautiful. She was one of the few true ‚Äúsuccesses‚Äù of Aegis‚Äôs vision. However when she saw what she was intended to be used for, namely ‚Äúurban pacification‚Äù against people just like what she used to be she turned on the company and the superhero industry in general and led a revolt. Today she is a beautiful femme fatale, deadly and ferocious but also seductive and sexy. She has taken on the leadership role of the team and is a regular enemy (and occasional lover of) Captain Evergreen, the leader of the D-Listers.

**5: Chemtrail** aka Eric Ward. Eric was his whole life a deeply paranoid lonely isolated man. Raised on the internet and doomed to wander south Florida hopped up on drugs and Reddit conspiracy theories he had what would be called paranoid schizophrenia and his belief that the government was coming after him at every turn led him to join a far right militia to ‚Äúfight back‚Äù against the deep state. His movement would ultimately get defeated by the superhero ‚ÄúAuraman‚Äù and all its leaders would be captured. He escaped and became a wanted fugitive for a few months but he did eventually get caught in a coffee shop when he ranted about 5G lizard people and waved a gun around. His trial was nonsense and he kept pleading amendments that didn‚Äôt exist, demanding immunity while insisting he wasn‚Äôt guilty and then claiming insanity. Eventually the court handed him to Aegis just to get him out of there. He was subsequently the test subject they used a volatile chemical-radiation-heat fusion on. His veins became burning, his body radioactive and everywhere he went he left a trail of hazardous burning chemicals. He had become a living Chemtrail and this became his new identity. He can burn things from a distance, melt things with a touch and poison the surrounding area with deadly noxious chemicals. The only thing more toxic than his powers are his views.

**6: Headcase** aka Gideon Marris. A man who presented himself as a genius intellect but was actually a petty grifter who had built a small empire out of stolen and fake identities and careful manipulations. He once tried to be a scientist but never succeeded, instead using his intellect just for grifting. However the grifter himself got grifted when Aegis promised to give him the ‚Äútools he would need to become a true scientist‚Äù he agreed without question. Too late he realised by tools they meant an experimental intelligence booster and that more importantly it dramatically altered his brain. His cranium expanded significantly, breaking through his skull and becoming a giant pulsating super kind. His intellect was unmatched in exchange for a hideous debilitating appearance (he‚Äôs also now obsessed with the movie The Godfather). His genius also came with psychic powers, notably telepathy and telekinesis. He is a raging egomaniac who constantly reminds the team that he is literally the ‚Äúbrains‚Äù of the operation. His intellect serves the team well in their villainy.

1mtnv4m,https://i.redd.it/x9v5xt5ehsjf1.png,[Whiskey Review #145] Kilchoman Fino Sherry Cask Matured,"After releasing a limited edition of its Fino sherry cask-aged whisky in 2020, Kilchoman released a similarly limited edition in 2023, but with a much larger volume of a whisky aged exclusively in ex-Fino sherry casks. This edition also packs a much stronger punch.

The whisky was distilled in 2018 with a peat level of 50ppm and aged for at least five years in 20 casks owned by Jos√© & Miguel Mart√≠n, a company originally from Huelva but now operating in Jerez, after acquiring the Valdivia winery. Their casks are also sent to distilleries such as Glenfarclas, Ardgowan, and Springbank for their ex-sherry cask-aged spirits.

This version is bottled at 50% ABV.

Made by: Kilchoman Distillery  
Name of the whisky: Fino Sherry Cask Matured  
Brand: Kilchoman  
Origin: Islay, Scotland  
Age: NAS  
Price: $115

**Nose:** In my experience with peated whiskeys, there are two very distinctive aroma styles: one with a smoky aroma and the other with an ash aroma. While most Kilchomans I've tried tend to have that smoky aroma, this one has an ash aroma, much like Lagavulin or Laphroaig. It also has herbal aromas of dried leaves, pine, and rosemary, but then olives, nuts, and hints of citrus, with a finish of asphalt and popcorn.

**Palate:** On the palate, I find flavors of burnt rubber, licorice, almonds, baked apple, and toffee, but also that sweetness that is often found in whiskies aged in sherry casks. Toward the finish, notes of pepper and green apple.

**Retrohale/Finish:** In the aftertaste, lemon zest, ash and burnt coffee.

**Rating:** 8 on the t8ke

**Conclusion:** I had the opportunity to try this whisky at a sherry-based tasting, where we tried sherry cream, then sherry wine, sherry brandy, and finally a whisky that's been aged in a sherry cask, which is this one. I like how this whisky includes that slightly acidic note of the wine, but also the sweet note that characterizes it. I think it's a whisky that would tolerate much more age, but as it is, it's very good.

I‚Äôm 25 now, and today marks 15 years since my mom passed away. She was killed in a drunk driving accident when I was 10. It still doesn‚Äôt feel real sometimes‚Äîlike I‚Äôll catch myself thinking about what she‚Äôd say about where I am in life, or wondering if she‚Äôd be proud of me.

Losing a parent so young messes with you in ways you don‚Äôt really notice until you get older. Back then, I didn‚Äôt fully understand, I just knew my world was broken. Now, as an adult, I feel the weight of everything I missed‚Äîthe conversations we‚Äôll never have, the milestones she wasn‚Äôt here for, even just the everyday stuff like having coffee together or calling her for advice.

One thing that‚Äôs made it harder is that my dad doesn‚Äôt really believe in mental health or therapy. So for most of my life, I just shoved everything down and tried to move on like nothing happened. It wasn‚Äôt until about 9 months ago that I finally started therapy, and it‚Äôs been eye-opening to realize how much I‚Äôd been carrying without even knowing it.

I don‚Äôt talk about this much in real life, but the anniversary always hits harder than I expect. I guess I just wanted to put it out there. If you‚Äôve lost a parent, especially young, how do you keep their memory alive as the years go on?

1mtntsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1mtntsr/is_it_that_bad/,Is it that bad?,"This post came out VERY long. Here is a summary: I have a difficult relationship with my parents. When I visited last I felt my autonomy, privacy, and my sense of self were all violated despite my communicated boundaries. I do question whether they have treated me poorly or I am just too sensitive. When I read others' stories I don't feel mine is so bad. I would like an outsiders point of view on this.



I have been questioning my perception of events for quite some time now and would like an outsider's point of view of my situation. My husband is convinced by parents are emotionally abusive. I know something is wrong with the relationship my parents and I have, but am not sure it is that bad. On occasion I do agree they are abusive and am extremely angry and upset. Then I will second guess myself and think I am being too sensitive and someone better would not be hurt by the situation.

For context, I am 35F, married, no children, and professionally successful (at least from the outside). I do not live in the same country I grew up in. My parents still live in the country I grew up in but are both ""foreigners"" there. This is important for reasons that will make sense later. 

I recently took 10 days off to visit my parents. My husband did not join, and I stayed at my parents' place (I know they would be upset if I decided to AirBnB or stayed at a hotel). Here is what happened during my stay, in more or less chronological order:

Day 1: I arrived at the airport after a 16 hour long trip. My flight was delayed a couple of hours. By parents were picking me at the airport. My dad says ""Hi, tiny one."" (In the language of the country I grew up this was even in the ""male"" gender, which you would use ironically to call someone fat). I have gained weight, but I am not unhealthy. My father has always been somewhat cruel regarding me and my weight. (For context, I have never been actually overweight, i.e. my BMI has always been below 25). For instance, when I was 15 and he saw me in a bathing suit he said ""where do you get ALL OF THAT from?"" with disgust in his face. The prior time I visited he was so relentless with ""you have to lose weight,"" ""do you even exercise,"" ""you should not eat so much,"" ""you should exercise your lower body so it looks more like your upper body,"" that I changed my flight and left earlier because I could no longer stand it. After this, he has been less direct, but will be ""sneaky,"" asking did you exercise today? or look at how fit I was when I was your age! and proceed to show me a picture. During another visit, my father received a picture of my cousin via iMessage (she is sitting next to a Christmas tree) and he mentioned how fat her butt had gotten. To which my mother said it happens to women with age, look at your daughter. So my mother, while better in this regard, is not great either.

The airport reception gave me a terrible feeling but I decided to ignore it. For further context, my father constantly comments on women's bodies. They may appear on TV, he may see them in the street, they may have been my friends when I was younger, it may be his ex-partner. Their butt this, their tits that. If asked to stop, he will say all men think this way, he is just saying it out loud and I should be less sensitive.

Days 2-5: I stayed at my parents' house. I worked (I can perform part of my work remotely, and even if I am supposedly on vacation too many things were going on) some, which drew quite a bit of my mother's criticism. This is Ok, I expected this, and I know that a lot of people in the same line of work as myself struggle with the balance. Interactions that progressively degraded my mental state: 1. We were in a heat wave, and I wanted to have the AC on to sleep. My parents have been telling me how they prepared the AC so that I could use it (They don't want to use it) for weeks before I had arrived. So I used it during the night. The next day my mother complained that I should not have the AC on because I will disturb the neighbors. This means the next night I have the AC off. The sees me being hot and says why I don't have the AC on. I said because it annoys you. To which she replied I should have it on for an hour before sleeping and then close it. I said if I do that I will just wake up overheated in the middle of the night, so I just decide to have the windows open. She then told me I should have both windows and door open. The thing is, I agree, but I don't want to have the door open. While I was growing up we already had a door always open policy and I felt constantly observed. 2.  During my visit, I could not go to the restroom without my mother asking me where I was going. 3. Once, I wanted to start working in my room, and she was using a stationary bike they had put there. She told me she would be done and half an hour and ""why don't I go to the bathroom meanwhile."" 4. When it is mealtime, she cooks what she claims I like (has no relation to what I like, and even if I tell her, she will ignore me). She will prepare a salad and not even allow me to season it myself. If I tell her to please allow me to do it, she will not, she will do it and ask me to stop when I am happy with the amount of seasoning, Only to ignore me and season it whichever way she wants. After I complain and complain about it, she will allow me to season it. The she will say something like ""you use so little oil, no wonder you struggle going to the bathroom."" 5. I was eating the salad she made and seasoned. She told me ""try these chips"". I said, no, not now. ""try them they are good"" No, not now. So she just threw them at my lap and said I should try them. More events like these happened but I think the type of overbearing comes through with these examples.  

I have a whole history of my mother being very controlling/overbearing. She used to go through my garbage when I was growing up because ""I was too wasteful"" and she picked out what I threw. She also constantly criticized me for using tampons (I bought them with my allowance, my parents would not buy them for me) because where she grew up ""only prostitutes used them."" And she would tell me how disgusting it is and how bloody they were. I know I am not a child anymore, but I struggle dealing with her excessive ""care"" when I am staying with them now.

Day 6: Since Day 4, I had been telling my parents I wanted to go to the city (about 15 miles from my parents' house) to do some shopping (treats for people back home, books, and others). This is something I need to do for my parents when I am to do something that is ""unusual"" to them. So I had been explaining what I wanted to buy, and that I wanted to take the train there. Every single time I was met with pushback: let you father take you there and go with you. We can buy those things for you here, you don't have to go. But I kept saying I wanted to go by myself and go by train. I thought two days of ""preparation"" was enough. So after that, I got ready and told them I was going to the city. Here we go again, let your father drive you. No, I don't want to, I want to go by myself. My father insisted he could come with me. I said, I would like to go on my own, because I want to walk around quite a bit (again, heat wave, I want to spend the day walking around, and my father is 82). At this point my father relented and said it was Ok for my to go by myself. Then, my mother started telling me how people get mugged in the city, they get pickpocketed, and even a woman got dragged by the neck and killed. They made me take water bottles and a backpack in case I do not get bags for my shopping. I told them I could buy bags if I wanted to, but I just did what they said so that they would stop nagging me. I felt I had gotten nagged at enough. I went to the city, did my shopping, spent the day there. It felt so good to be out of their grasp for a few hours.

I returned home and complained to my father about the incessant control from my mother. Both in terms of wanting to prevent me of leaving the house, but also in terms of to which room I am going, how I am eating the food she prepares etc. I also was upset that she would not let me make myself coffee. When I mentioned this, he told me she only expressed care. I told him it comes out more as control. And then he just said ""Oh, you have grey hair! The two grey haired women always fighting."" This is something he always does, whenever I complain/criticize/express an opinion they do not agree with, I am either mocked, told I am too sensitive, or told that I am only saying what I am saying to provoke.

My relationship with my dad is difficult. While he is the harshest critic, he is also the one of the two I have actually good memories of. My mother was a stay at home mother but almost never interacted with me. Never played with me, never did anything except take me to extracurriculars. I have literally no good memories of her. On the other hand, my father would play computer games, and take me places during the weekends.

 After this, we had dinner. My mother prepared fried eggs for my dad, which turned out scrambled. She blamed me for it, she claimed to have used very little oil because I don't like oil (due to salad seasoning I believe), and she had originally intended the eggs to be for the both of us. The dinner then proceeded in silence, because at this point I am so deeply tired, frustrated and fed up. 

Even if I wanted, I can not help with chores at my parents' house. I enjoy cooking in my own home, but my mother will not allow me to touch anything in her kitchen. From her point of view, I can not do anything without making a mess or doing it wrong.

My mother also offered to laundry for me while I was there. I said no. The last time she did laundry for me she complained on how disgusting my underwear is. (I use thongs, she does not approve).

My mother also complained that I do not wear the same clothes I wore when I left (13 YEARS AGO) and instead choose to bring my own when I visit. 

I could keep going on but I guess it's enough to get the picture. My parents will also constantly compare me with other people that have children. I have decided to have none of my own, and to them this is a terrible decision. They will show me videos of myself when I was a child and ask if I don't want one. My mother asked me what is even the point of me having a career if it's not to have children, etc.

After all of this, and with a lot of emotional support from my husband (via phone), I changed my flight date to the next day. I told them this, to which they responded ""Mhhh"" in an angry tone. The rest of my stay was silent, until I got on an Uber the next day. Before leaving my mother said ""call me when you arrive,"" and that was that.

Not to mention that my father had cancer for four years and they kept it from me.

I did not call, and I have not called since. I used to call every week at the same time and would talk to them. This would cause me quite a bit of stress, I would get extremely sweaty while I talk to them. In a way I always expect that they criticize/insult me and am prepared for it. Now I stopped calling. I know they will not call me, because in the 13 years I have been abroad they have not called once. They say it's because they do not want ""to disturb."" I am tired, and I don't want to talk to them. Not in a very long time, and I not sure if again. Part of me feels terrible about it. As I said in the beginning, I do wonder if I am too sensitive and should finally grow up.

**5. Voices of the Rainforest** Lush 4K canopy shot at dawn in a tropical rainforest. Cicadas buzz, tree frogs chirp, and toucans call across the humid air as dew drips rhythmically from broad leaves. The layered chorus blends into a vibrant yet soothing ASMR jungle soundscape, looping seamlessly for immersive ambience.

This programmable 12-cup coffee maker immediately caught my eye with its sleek black and silver design, compact size, and thoughtful usability.

**Design and Space Efficiency**  
The product is smaller than expected, fitting snugly under my kitchen cabinets without consuming precious countertop real estate. Its FrontFill water reservoir is a minor miracle‚Äîno awkward tilting or precarious positioning required to add water. The swing-out brew basket works seamlessly, providing easy access for adding coffee grounds. The smart design even stores the carafe handle neatly into the base, saving yet more space. It feels made for my tiny urban apartment, where every inch counts.

**Ease of Function and Programming**  
One standout for me is the Easy-Touch programming. Getting this coffee maker ready to brew up to 24 hours in advance was extremely simple. There's something comforting in waking up to the smell of freshly brewed coffee, without fumbling to set things up when grogginess is stronger than caffeine levels. The digital clock is clear and responsive, making programming smooth for someone who is definitely not tech-savvy pre-coffee.

**Strengths**  
There‚Äôs plenty to appreciate! This coffee maker is:
- Compact yet functional, designed for small spaces.
- Aesthetically modern with a polished black and silver finish.  
- Easy to use thanks to the FrontFill system and programmable features.  
- Convenient, with an automatic two-hour shutoff to prevent forgetful mishaps.    
- Designed with durable, dishwasher-safe parts for low-maintenance cleanup.  

**Negatives**  
However, perfection is elusive:  
- There‚Äôs no built-in permanent filter, so paper filters are a necessity.  
- The machine isn‚Äôt the most whisper-quiet when brewing.  
- A few users reported uneven brewing if water isn't added carefully.  
- Despite its functional design, the materials feel somewhat lightweight and could come across as less durable.  

**Performance and Brew Quality**  
This coffee maker is excellent if you‚Äôre seeking a standard, no-frills brew. It feels dependable, with consistent flavor, although some may consider it on the weaker side depending on coffee-to-water ratios. The borosilicate glass carafe seems built to last, resisting that annoying residue or etching I‚Äôve experienced with past brewers. It also pours without any messy dribbles‚Äîa small but noteworthy win.

**Competing Products**  
Stacking this coffee machine against popular competitors such as the Ninja CE251 or the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker reveals both its strengths and shortcomings. The Ninja wins hands down in premium build quality and advanced thermal technology. Mr. Coffee offers a slightly more intuitive interface for about the same ease-of-cleaning features. Where this Proctor Silex model wins is affordability and compact, space-saving design. For people who value simplicity over frillier features, it hits a solid sweet spot.

**Value for Money**  
Considering its features, this coffee maker holds value for those on a budget. It might not be the flashiest or the most luxurious, but it offers excellent performance within its range, especially for apartments or secondary kitchens. You‚Äôll likely find other options with higher-end features at steeper price points, but for a functional, hassle-free daily coffee machine, it justifies its cost.

1mtne44,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1mtne44/ftm_to_a_miserable_baby/,FTM to a miserable baby,"I‚Äôm just venting as I cry over my coffee this Monday morning and hope someone feels seen. If my husband sees this, I hope he feels seen too. 

I‚Äôm a FTM to an almost 10 week old and he is a miserable baby. I feel awful even saying that but it‚Äôs true. He is rarely happy, cries constantly. Struggles during most feeds, struggles to nap, gets overtired, etc. We have tried everything to help him. We have read every book, tried everything schedule, talked with our pediatrician. He is literally screaming as I type this. I feel like all my preparation was for nothing. And lol at the fact that I literally have a doctorate in psychology. Oh the irony. 

I feel so cheated out of the sweet newborn stage. Even our first night with his was taken because he had birth complications and was taken from our arms and transferred to a hospital an hour away not 12 hours after I had him. He was in the NICU for a week and no diagnosis came from it. But boy did the bills.

I feel like our joy over this new life and our new family has been stolen. And not just my joy, but my LO‚Äôs too. And my husbands. And all of our family who wants to meet our LO and then hears his screams instead of his laughs. I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have these thoughts but I hope by acknowledging them, I am giving them less power. But I wish I hadn‚Äôt had him. I wish we could start over. I dread each morning. I don‚Äôt always feel love when I look at him. I want to just run away. But even when I let my husband watch him, I feel the weight of knowing he is screaming at him. I‚Äôd rather be the one to suffer and make it so everyone around me can only see his sweet moments. All this and also I couldn‚Äôt live without him. 

I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôve wrote because I‚Äôm writing through screams and shrieks and head butts. I feel like a shell of myself. My shoulder is hurt because of carrying him all day every day, I have an eye infection because of probably his poop or pee getting in my eye (gross I know), I‚Äôm bruised all over because he flails with no warning and hits me with his head. I was a successful woman before him and I feel like I ruined my life by having him. And then I feel immense guilt for feeling that way because it‚Äôs not his fault. He‚Äôs trying his best. God he‚Äôs just a baby- who blames a baby like this?!

Idk anymore. I just needed a space to vent and like I said, I hope someone who may relate to me feels seen and not alone. Thanks to anyone who has read all this. I see and appreciate you. 

TLDR- FTM struggling with her colicky babe venting while he screams at her. 

EDIT to answer some questions- we are EBF. Pediatrician thinks could be some reflux so we are on the baby Pepcid since last Thursday. I don‚Äôt eat lots of dairy anyway but trying to cut out dairy just to see if it helps.  Just ordered some gas drops and the frida windi today to see if that could help with potential gas. I also do massages daily with him and get his body moving. We do know that rocking him or bouncing him on a yoga ball helps (at least sometimes) so those are our go to soothing methods. With NICU stuff, he got tested for all kinds of things because the doctors were stumped, and nothing came back positive. On paper he is perfectly healthy, which of course we are happy about. And lastly, we have gotten second opinions from some other doctors in our family (one neonatologist) but have gotten mostly the same feedback- that it‚Äôs probably colic, could be reflux, take the medicine and hold upright, make sure he has a good latch and try to change positions as needed, cut out dairy, could try thickening my breast milk, and the importance of taking time for yourself as much as possible.

Also, I really appreciate all the support. I‚Äôm reaching out to friends/family for support and taking care of myself as best I can. Thankfully already on SSRIs to help. If I don‚Äôt respond to everyone, please know it‚Äôs because baby is screaming. But also know that I‚Äôve read every comment and wish I could hug you all ‚ù§Ô∏è",15,1755526807.0,NewParents,44,0.78,False

1mtndti,https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1mtndti/alumni_lecture_0818_endurance_test/,Alumni Lecture (08/18) - Endurance Test,"Today's lesson takes the campers to the half-moon amphitheatre.

They are invited to come as early as they can, whether early means 6 a.m. or after breakfast. Everyone is welcome, when they are ready. That said, it would really be best if you arrived as early as possible.

The host is already there before the sun has even risen. He busies himself by preparing the stage, mopping the hewn stands, levelling the earthen center, and bringing the canvas roof overhead. He pulls more than a dozen yoga mats, rugs, and miscellaneous rectangles from backstage and lays them out in concentric circles. The young man prepares a water station, with paper cups and markers. He presents a basket where people can put their things for safekeeping, and another basket full of ping pong balls. Oh, he also puts up pre-prepared signs advertising the event around the camp.

Just like any other lesson.

To be quite honest, this event was meant to be hosted for quite some time, weary-minded Chiron asked that this be held after a certain [battle](https://redd.it/1md5fui)‚Äîwhich was fitting to be fair, all things considered. It was postponed further by [demigodly duties](https://redd.it/1mhwt6g) which do not wait for anyone, even the demigod.

What matters is that they are here today.

\~‚Äî\~‚Äî\~

""Ohay≈ç, Camp Half-Blood!"" The lecturer, a young man with [multicoloured hair](https://imgur.com/a/szxaBQS), greets the crowd warmly. He looks at each of the assembled faces, both to look for the familiar and to assess the hardships the fledgling campers have already been subject to. He notes the scars, the slings, and the empty stares. All too familiar.

""Thank you for joining me this morning. I know it takes a lot of energy to get out of bed, so I hope that you'll be able to take something from this lesson that will help you not just in battle but what comes after.""

Though the crowd is spread out, each person should hear him loud and clear. It's a handy perk of his **Legendary Lungs**. Dressed in a pair of sweat pants and a tank top, the young man introduces himself as Caspian Kaito with the associated titles (son of the Muse Thalia, former Counsellor of the Muses, former Guild Master, current sophomore at Julliard, etcetera, etcetera). Curiously, he's applying sun screen on himself as he speaks.

He introduces as well a robatic companion, a ball-shaped drone fitted with fins, a top hat and a monocle. This is Sir Mobius, an adamantine automaton shaped like a miniature whale. It floats through the crowd, offering refreshments and poking the air above people's heads with a tiny cane.

With introductions out of the way, graduated Caspian invites everyone to take a seat on their own yoga mat.

""I understand that..."" The lad looks to the north. ""You guys have just come from a rather intense battle, the latest of a string of other events. Not only did you take the charge against the Titan's forces, you had to face off against fellow demigods, former campers...

And, you had to do all that with plenty of eyes watching."" He nods at an owl or two perched at the back of the stands. ""It is not an understatement to say you likely have a lot of lingering thoughts and feelings about what you've experienced: hurt, confusion, anxiety, frustration, fury, at risk, unsafe.

There are likely plenty of people with which you harbour these thoughts and feelings."" A glance at the owls again.

""I want to tell you that all of these are okay. You are not wrong for reacting to such things. But, we are here today to help you channel all of these feelings‚Äîso that you are not consumed by them, and so that they can motivate you to look forward.

Yes, I know forward is a hard thing to imagine at this moment.

Just hear me out."" He smiles and explains that this lesson will focus on one thing: **endurance**.

A demigod's ability to endure not only physical pain but emotional turmoil is critical in preventing burnout or crash-outs. This does not mean simply taking an emotional or mental beating, but being able to simmer with your thoughts, understand your emotions, and see where you are, so that you can ground and find yourself.

The first part of this lesson, yoga, bridges the physical with the mental and emotional by forcing your mind to concentrate on your breath and body as you go through particular poses to stimulate the muscles and blood flow. The emotion then turns into focus, which allows you to form build on what you're thinking and feeling to figure out something new.

Muse-minded Caspian demonstrates a few complex poses, such as crow pose and even a headstand for that one heckler, but he makes sure that everyone can move appropriate to their flexibility and physicality.

""Your strength will help, but it is your breath that will guide you through this,"" the lad reminds the crowd.

Once the campers have more or less grasped this form of meditation, he moves on to the second part of the lesson: a gauntlet. Being able to ground yourself after an intense experience is important, but staying grounded while that experience is still ongoing is also critical.

The task is simple. The fledgling campers will each be given a ping pong ball. They can decorate the balls, label them, put googley eyes on them‚Äîwhatever they'd like. They must run from one end of the amphitheatre to the other, without crushing the ball. If this challenge is too easy, then they can try a paper cup full of hot coffee.

The trick?

Caspian explains how he has a special ability the directors have dubbed **stage manipulation**. Much like how the schooling children of the sea gods can affect maritime paraphernalia or how sprouting agricultural demigods can control farming equipment, he can command the aspects of any stage to his whims. He can also affect the earth with his ability called esdafoskinesis, or **soil manipulation**.

So, Caspian will run them through a gauntlet. They will have to contend with flying sandbags, floating props, the dirt floor bursting and trapping them where they stand. The tarp roof will fall on them, the lights will shine on them, the sound systems will shout at them.

All the while, they must ground themselves, consider where they are now, and where they need to go.

He fully expects a few campers to just charge through, so Sir Mobius will be on standby to throw a wrench in those plans. (Well, it's more of a cane.) Worst comes to worst, they can have a little sparring session. He's flexible that way.

Whoever successfully makes it to the end of the gauntlet will receive some classic New York-style bagels‚Äîcourtesy of Caspian's partners. Whoever doesn't can simply try again. Whoever doesn't want to participate can just have a chat with the son of Thalia when he's taking a break.

He'll be taking quite a few of those. Using his powers on this scale will take a lot out of him. That's why he's asked half the campers to come back in the evening. (That's right, this lesson is split into a morning and afternoon show for your convenience.)
