3006

The 3006 is a bit cheaper and in my opinion looks nicer (although the black 3007 is nice)
The 3007 has quite a few people saying it's good but I can't find anything on the 3006. Anyone have any info? The stats look the same...

Hi. So I‚Äôm turning to Reddit to see if anyone has any info, help, advice, anything. I‚Äôm located in California (LA) if that helps with providing a resource I may be unaware of. I would really appreciate it. 

A family member of mine has not slept very much in almost a month. They have said they‚Äôve slept at most an hour or two per night, sometimes nothing at all and constantly drinks coffee or energy drinks and are constantly overworked. 

So recently, about a week ago, they started having what the hospital described as some sort of ‚Äúdelirium‚Äù probably due to lack of sleep. I‚Äôm not sure if they have other mental health diagnosis, but their mom told me they have sleep apnea but refuse to get help for it. 

They have started having what I would describe as ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù? I‚Äôm not sure the proper word to use, so please forgive me. They‚Äôve been talking all sorts of nonsense, blowing up at people and doing things that are extremely unlike them. They‚Äôve been blowing up at their mom every day (they live with them) and will verbally abuse her at any given opportunity, unprovoked. Basically, their behavior is the complete opposite of what it normally is. They refuse to get any help, their parents have looked into resources but they all said they have to voluntarily ask for it.

When their parents were able to convince them to go to the hospital, when the staff asked them if they wanted help, they refused. So because of that they said they couldn‚Äôt evaluate them since they‚Äôre an adult. All of the resources their mom has tried said the same thing, since they‚Äôre over 18 it has to be voluntary. 

At this point their mother is terrified they‚Äôll do something to harm themselves or others since their behavior is so erratic or that something may happen behind the wheel since they‚Äôre so sleep deprived. They took the keys to the car when they had hidden them, but they found them and took off to school. 

They have been telling peers that they don‚Äôt want to go back home because they can‚Äôt stand seeing their parents. 

At this point we don‚Äôt know what to do. I know they haven‚Äôt harmed anyone yet, but their behavior is becoming increasingly worrisome as the days go by. 

If there is any help or resource, recommendations, anything, please, I‚Äôd love to hear it.

Thank you so much.

I started at a new job and I really really love it! All the staff is nice and its so refreshing to be in a good work environment nowadays. 

In the short time Ive worked there Ive grown close with one coworker and sorta developed a crush on him. Ive tried my best to keep it chill and be normal about it but its getting kinda unbearable. I know dating a coworker is the worst idea in the world you dont gotta tell me that. But Im just not sure if he likes me back.

I have a notepad I keep with/around me at work and he always writes me little notes or does doodles on it. He makes me drinks and will add wtv in there for me. Hell make a tea if I look anxious or coffee if I look tired.

Hes also made a few comments about me. When he found out that I had a certain hobby he said ""You seem like you would be a [hobby] baddie"". He gives me rides home a lot and is honestly just really nice to me. He goes like way above and beyond for me. Also said I was a ""Sweet girl"".

He helps me with my sidework a lot and is always checking up on me more than anyone else in the place does. I got stung by a bee at work and he got me painkillers anti-swelling cream and a bandaid- which was overkill.

He always compliments me and tells me I look nice and tells me how funny I am (I don't think Im funny but I like hearing it lowk). Also hes taken me home a bunch by now but he misses the turn to get me home right away and ends up going down a block or two before actually taking me home. He has the GPS in front of him and should know the route by now idk why hes missing the turn. Plus hes constantly kinda sorta fussing over me and its really sweet. 

But the problem is hes a LOTT older than me. And that would definitely get a few looks SHOULD anything happen. But hes a coworker so I dont want anything to happen to not make it awkward.

I dont know if its just because hes nice or bc Im new or even because he likes me or if its like he sees me like a little sister but I just need outside perspective. I could give more details if you need it I didnt really plan this out and I was kinda just wanting an answer yk?

Heck, I went out to buy them more fish. I got them more fish. They had their fish. It should have been resolved. But no.

They screamed, involved both my little brother and her son (they're fucking 10 years old) scared everyone to the point that not even the dog wants to be near them now, both ran off, both returned around midnight, and now I need to keep seperating them …ìecause they keep going back to each other to yell and shout. I'm tired. I keep needing to remind them to for fucks sake stop, their kids are sleeping. Do they care? Not one bit.

Secondly, I have not been paid or otherwise incentivized to write this piece other than purely out of my own free will.)

I walk into the white interior of the Los Angeles Arts District coffee shop. The nutty smell of coffee mixes in with the sweet smells of the pastries in my nostrils on this wonderful 70-degree day that‚Äôs Southern California‚Äôs autumn signature. People are seated around the interior on pine benches and tables, some working on sticker-bombed laptops, while others have quiet conversations over a variety of beverages. I take my place in the long line to the cash register. I see a young man approach, and I can instantly spot him after seeing him on social media so many times before: Wes. He‚Äôs holding a clear cup filled to the brim with an iced black coffee, and in the other hand, a black hard-shell case. I wave and introduce myself, as he gives me a firm handshake.

We magically find seats in the busy shop near the back, and we sit together around a cup of joe. I‚Äôm fairly excited as he places the case on the table and opens the lid; inside: the entire current Nodus lineup. We pull one watch out after the other, discussing the design language and the features on each. He points out bestsellers and the different little micro-details of each watch. I am definitely enamored by the Nodus Sector Sport with the salmon dial, a beautiful example of excellent finishing and simplicity with enough complexity to keep my eye on the dial. The Contrail GMT with its bold splash of complementary colors and sapphire bezel keeps my eyes darting to it. And the Sector Deep Destro Polar, with its crisp geometric lines and clear legibility is a wonderful tool watch I can‚Äôt help but handle again and again. I am reminded quickly how difficult marketing and photography in the watch world is, as it is very challenging for two-dimensional images to capture the true spirit of watch designs, displaying their depth, color, how the light catches the diverse surfaces. As excited as I am to see and handle all these beautiful timepieces, I am here to meet the man behind the brand, as opposed to the watches themselves, which have already received heaps of praise throughout the microbrand world.

The conversation starts fairly mildly, we recount our own backgrounds and the watches we‚Äôre wearing. I have on a Waldan Heritage Sportline on a crocodile strap, a relatively attractive Ameriquartz watch out of New York. Wes is wearing the Sector Sport that I‚Äôve been eyeing for the past year or so. As the conversation moves from the watches on the table to design language, we both recover from the initial awkwardness of meeting a stranger and begin to open up significantly. Wes is very easy to talk to, and he has a warm, relaxed ability to make you quickly lower your guard. We discuss the signature style that Nodus has cultivated over years of releasing different models, as Wes, alongside his in-house engineer discovered more and more about what makes the company‚Äôs offerings stand apart. The conversation flowed fairly easily, and we covered, in no particular order: microbrands in the space and the tight-knit community that it is; the amount of travel that Wes puts in every year to promote the brand; Wes‚Äôs heritage, and his recent reconnection to it on his trip to Singapore for a watch event; our upcoming and past travels to Europe; upcoming events for Wes, including Intersect LA (which I will certainly attend!); manufacturing in the US, and the measured steps the industry is taking to get there; the difficulty and reward of building a physical product, and the failures and successes to get there; self-help and ongoing education; the challenge of not comparing our own successes to others; the novel I am currently working on; upcoming models and ideas for products and features; patenting the Node-X bracelet design; the growth pains of a small-to-medium business and the challenges growing companies endure; the design challenges of making something as intricate as a watch; belief in oneself and following one‚Äôs own path; Wes‚Äôs studies in Boston and his music background; the company‚Äôs success, team, and collaborative efforts; the intricate way life takes us outside our plans and on an adventure; my upcoming wedding; work-life balance and delegation in leadership, along with new challenges a leader finds themselves in; our gear-head interests (I‚Äôm a motorcycle guy, he‚Äôs a car junkie); my military days and his father's Navy background.

I‚Äôve barely scratched the surface of the entire coffee-shop talk, but I found Wes to be a very genuine, transparent, and hungry young man, with a bright future ahead of him. He‚Äôs well-educated and well-spoken, yet continues to hunger for more learning and personal growth. Before I knew it, we had spent two hours chatting, and it was time to go. We shook hands, and Wes encouraged me to visit Nodus at Intersect LA next year (which I will). Wes, thank you so much for taking the time today out of your highly busy schedule to sit down with a complete stranger and have a great conversation, and I hope to meet you again soon! As for your watches, you have a customer in myself. If you‚Äôre reading this, keep at it, you‚Äôre killing it!

He‚Äôs holding a clear cup filled to the brim with an iced black coffee, and in the other hand, a black hard-shell case. I wave and introduce myself, and he gives me a firm handshake.

We magically find seats in the busy shop near the back, and we sit together around a cup of joe. I‚Äôm fairly excited as he places the case on the table and opens the lid; inside: the entire current Nodus lineup. We pull one watch out after the other, discussing the design language and the features on each. He points out bestsellers and the different little micro-details of each watch. I am definitely enamored by the Nodus Sector Sport with the salmon dial, a beautiful example of excellent finishing and simplicity with enough complexity to keep my eye on the dial. The Contrail GMT with its bold splash of complementary colors and sapphire bezel keeps my eyes darting to it. And the Sector Deep Destro Polar, with its crisp geometric lines and clear legibility is a wonderful tool watch I can‚Äôt help but handle again and again. I am reminded quickly how difficult marketing and photography in the watch world is, as it is very challenging for two-dimensional images to capture the true spirit of watch designs, displaying their depth, color, how the light catches the diverse surfaces. As excited as I am to see and handle all these beautiful timepieces, I am here to meet the man behind the brand, as opposed to the watches themselves, which have already received heaps of praise throughout the microbrand world.

The conversation starts fairly mildly, we recount our own backgrounds and the watches we‚Äôre wearing. I have on a Waldan Heritage Sportline on a crocodile strap, a relatively attractive Ameriquartz watch out of New York. Wes is wearing the Sector Sport that I‚Äôve been eyeing for the past year or so. As the conversation moves from the watches on the table to design language, we both recover from the initial awkwardness of meeting a stranger and begin to open up significantly. Wes is very easy to talk to, and he has a warm, relaxed ability to make you quickly lower your guard. We discuss the signature style that Nodus has cultivated over years of releasing different models, as Wes, alongside his in-house engineer discovered more and more about what makes the company‚Äôs offerings stand apart. The conversation flowed fairly easily, and we covered, in no particular order: microbrands in the space and the tight-knit community that it is; the amount of travel that Wes puts in every year to promote the brand; Wes‚Äôs heritage, and his recent reconnection to it on his trip to Singapore for a watch event; our upcoming and past travels to Europe; upcoming events for Wes, including Intersect LA (which I will certainly attend!); manufacturing in the US, and the measured steps the industry is taking to get there; the difficulty and reward of building a physical product, and the failures and successes to get there; self-help and ongoing education; the challenge of not comparing our own successes to others; the novel I am currently working on; upcoming models and ideas for products and features; patenting the Node-X bracelet design; the growth pains of a small-to-medium business and the challenges growing companies endure; the design challenges of making something as intricate as a watch; belief in oneself and following one‚Äôs own path; Wes‚Äôs studies in Boston and his music background; the company‚Äôs success, team, and collaborative efforts; the intricate way life takes us outside our plans and on an adventure; my upcoming wedding; work-life balance and delegation in leadership, along with new challenges a leader finds themselves in; our gear-head interests (I‚Äôm a motorcycle guy, he‚Äôs a car junkie); my military days and his father's Navy background.

I‚Äôve barely scratched the surface of the entire coffee-shop talk, but I found Wes to be a very genuine, transparent, and hungry young man, with a bright future ahead of him. He‚Äôs well-educated and well-spoken, yet continues to hunger for more learning and personal growth. Before I knew it, we had spent two hours chatting, and it was time to go. We shook hands, and Wes encouraged me to visit Nodus at Intersect LA next year (which I will). Wes, thank you so much for taking the time today out of your highly busy schedule to sit down with a complete stranger and have a great conversation, and I hope to meet you again soon! As for your watches, you have a customer in myself. If you‚Äôre reading this, keep at it, you‚Äôre killing it!

1gfbzj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ausadhd/comments/1gfbzj1/i_want_to_cry_fluence_and_qld/,I want to cry - Fluence and QLD,"tldr; my GP said she was willing to prescribe my medication, is unwilling to follow the plan. I spoke to Fluence who provided the details of another GP, who I walked out of my appointment with this morning unable to help.

full story: let me start by saying Fluence have been as helpful as they can be, however I can not stress enough to make sure that if you are in QLD that your GP is 100% on board following the plan from start to finish to find your correct medication and dosage.

I was diagnosed by Fluence earlier in the year based on a recommendation from my therapist that I go down the route of diagnosis for Autism/ADHD. 

As anyone who has done this is aware, it's such a seamless experience. I got in relatively quickly, the appointment was exhausting but in the end, I got the answers that my therapist knew I would.

Fast forward to the plan being received by my GP, who then says ""oh... I don't think I can follow this, I have never done this sort of thing before"" so another 2 weeks go by, and I go back and she is reluctant but says OK. I have been seeing this GP for 2-3 years regularly, and been going to the clinic for 4-5 years now.

A few weeks later, it's time to go from 5mg to 10mg methylphenidate, all good. A month later I ask about increasing the dosage and she says she is no longer comfortable doing it, as she's not an expert on the medication and doesn't know what to look out for, and it's up to the psychiatrist to manage this stage of the process.

So she refers me to Hello Doc, who I call and who tell me that I will be up for another diagnosis and will be out of pocket at least another $900.

I can't afford that, so I just continue having my 10mg with a coffee in the morning and afternoon.

I go back to my therapist the next month who she says in no fewer words, ""find a new fucking GP because for her to not following the guidance of an expert is bullshit"".

So, I call Fluence who say ""we don't have a lot of people in QLD we can refer you to contact, but I have one near you who you can call"", so I did.

I read the script, the receptionist says no problem, books me in with the GP a few days later. I go there, he says ""what can I help you with?"" and I explained all of the above to him.

His response is, ""well I wish Fluence asked me first, I can't do that, GP's can't prescribe, the psychiatrist has to, there's nothing I can do"".

I walked out so defeated, I wanted to cry.

So now... I don't know.

I guess I just wanted to make sure that my fellower QLDers are very aware, PLEASE make sure that your GP is 100% on board with following a plan and increasing/titrating your medication dosage. Right now I am at a complete loss, I am tired and I just want this whole ordeal to be over with.",2,1730254054.0,ausadhd,1,1.0,False

I went away on a 3 night trip all the while my partner was sick at home with our young kids. Now I already took a day off work 2 days beforehand to drop kids off and take care of her. 
She called me when I was at work in the morning and I dropped everything and came home, did the kid stuff then took care of her also used the time to pack for my trip in 2 days. 

I cared for her giving her meds, tea, soup let her rest.
I cooked dinner, cleaned up, bedtimes etc. 
The next day she did the usual morning routine, feeling a bit better she carried on

I ended up leaving for my trip thinking she'd feel better, well she ended up getting worse. The whole time there Im feeling guilty I wasn't at home but she had family come and help out. 

I come home on the Sunday, let her rest, pour her a bath, tea, tidy house etc. 
Fast forward to Monday, she was coughing all night and I didn't sleep at all on my trip, nor did I when I got back
 So I got up for work Monday morning made coffees and left to work. 

I find out later on that She was upset I didn't go in later to drop the kids off. 
Then it was explained that I did the bare minimum to care for her when she was sick and I could have done more to show her that I loved her because that's what partners do. 

She said when  I took my day off I could have gone grocery  shopping for the essentials and pre made food  that she would have needed when I was away. - We already had groceries and meals to make plus kids snack in garage. On top of that she mentioned I could have considered staying home from the trip(although she mentioned not knowing she'd get worse) 

So am I the asshole for not doing more, and for not staying home? 
I feel like no matter what I do it's not enough, or I go about things the wrong way. 

Anybody have some non bias  in-site? 

Thanks

1gfbsky,https://www.reddit.com/r/CSFLeaks/comments/1gfbsky/3_months_post_lumbar_puncture_not_fully_healed/,3 months post Lumbar Puncture - not fully healed? Minor CSF Leak?,"It has been about 3.5 months since I had a lumbar puncture. I got it to test for things like MS, Lyme, and other infectious diseases. (long story short, after a bout of unknown illness last year; ive had weakness in my legs, disabling fatigue after minor exertion, tinnitus, and tension headaches which I actually considered relatively unnoticeable by that point in time).

3 hours after the LP, I bent forward a bit while putting on my shoes and felt a sensation like something was essentially being torn or stretched past the point it should, if that makes sense. Nurse said it was probably just a nerve thing, nothing to worry about.

I was stuck flat in bed for a solid week, unable to be upright for more than 5-10 minutes without the craziest headache ever. The lowerback was very sore and painful and I also felt a similiar painful tear-like sensations a few times when just trying to reposition in the bed.

I was at the hospital for a bloodpatch when I tested out my tolerance for being upright and I seemed to be doing better, so we didn't do it. 

However since then, I've still had very noticeable headaches. Both frontal and in the back. Sometimes right when I wake up in the morning. My ears feel wet. (One of my ears actually became clogged randomly as if it had been submerged underwater and I couldn't hear out of it). My ears are dry or no wetter than usual when I put my finger in them though.

My butt also gets very numb and actually has a wet-like sesation while my lowerback still is tender. I've had a lot of crazy sensations in my back, shoulder, and hips since the LP. I can feel my pulse in my back where the LP was whenever my heartbeat is elevated. When straining on the toilet it felt like I was blowing up a balloon (I no longer strain due to this and take laxatives when needed). There hasn't been a very comfortable seated or laying position for months.

I haven't had really bad naseau or thrown up, but ocassionaly I'll have a stomach ache for no apparent reason.

I am upright most of the day. I also drink 1-2 cups of coffee a day (normal for me) so that may affect things.

We did an MRI a couple weeks after the LP to check if I was still leaking and of course it showed nothing. I went to my neurologist again a week ago and he's not too worried. The butt numbness and back issues, probably just a nerve injury that will heal over time. I had mentioned the ear wetness feeling to the assistant but im not sure if the doctor actually read that on the chart since he didn't mention it.

I just dont know what to do, to be honest. The sensations I'm having in my back, the headaches, the ear wetness, it sounds like to me that I might not have healed up completely at this point. I'm thankful I'm not stuck horizontal but I'm unconvinced that I'm out of the woods essentially. I've been avoiding bending, lifting, twisting for months because I'm worried i'll make it worse. What's worse, I got laid off from my remote job so I'll have to deal with whatever health benefits issues that causes in a few weeks.

 Who would I even go to at this point if my neuro isn't concerned and I still have suspicions? Another neurologist? Leak specialist? Should I actually just wait for even longer with these symptoms and see if they improve? I've wanted to do physical therapy and planned to start right after the LP but I've essentially been too scared to even try with this going on.

We have a lot of witty banter with each other which is something I've always craved in my dates but never really found. First date was a coffee date which then turned to an arcade/pool date. We met up a few days later for a second date, which was a surprise because he just told me a place to meet him at. I love surprises so that was very refreshing to hear. Anyway, the date turned out to be at a board game cafe where we played a card game to get to know each other through deep chats. It was really unique and fun, then he invited me over for a tea at his place. We had tea, and just made out since it was obvious we were attracted to one another. But I did stop midway to talk, just confirm that he wanted something long term because for me its quite fast to start making out on the 2nd date unless its something casual (and I wasn't looking for casual). Long story short, we were both religious but his level of religiousness did not match mine, as I didn't wanna do anything other than make out before getting married.

We texted after the date, and decided that we wanted different things. It was a bummer because it was quite hard to find someone where we both felt the connection, attraction and have similar goals/ambitions in life. He realized after having some chat about our religious views that he probably needs to grow more internally before pursuing anything serious, as he doesn't want to do casual stuff. We decided to be friends and connected on instagram. 2 days later, I get an email from an unknown person saying this:

""Hey, I know you have been seeing this guy named X. Just an heads up- he would eventually ask to take naked photos of you and try to extort money or other favors. If you cannot relate to this person, please disregard my email.""

**My criteria:** 

* *Location*: Lower Manhattan (Flatiron and below; ideally, close to TriBeCa)
* *Party size:* I envision that there will be 6-12 people gathered at any given time, so it would be good if the place is relatively spacious.
* *Day of the week and time range*: Saturday, mid-afternoon (like 2 or 3ish)
* *Budget:* No budget for any sort of rental situation. I want place that is somewhat trendy and allows me to stay planted while friends stop by with their partners and kids. 
* *Offerings*: It would be nice if the place offers nonalcoholic beverages and some sort of nibbles. Bonus if alcohol and more substantial food choices are available that people can purchase if they are feeling peckish. But, this gathering is really not food/drink-centric. It's more about spending quality time catching up with friends I haven't seen in ages.

**Locations I've already considered:** 

* *Ace Hotel* lobby bar area in Flatiron (I've already done a gathering there before, so I'd prefer somewhere new)
* *The Marlton Hotel* lobby/espresso bar in Greenwich Village (a bit of a gamble because, if there is high occupancy, it might be a bit tight)
* *Le Pain Quotidien* or *Blue Bottle Coffee* (I'd prefer to not host at a chain establishment, but willing to consider suggestions)

The following countries are currently socialist:   **China, Cuba, Laos, Vietnam**.  That's it.  Is that the government you wish to live by?  Why not move there?  Sell all of your belongings and go find out what life is like for someone who really is oppressed and victimized.  

  
The reason E11, et al are so hard on you is that you do in fact tell us your life story and your innermost thoughts and what you describe is someone who refuses to make sacrifices and **live within your means**.

You don't need to live in, as you described it, the most expensive area of Oregon, you don't want to give up that dirt patch you have outside of your back door.  Wouldn't your rent be cheaper if you just moved upstairs?  Or to a less expensive town?  

You bitched about ""spoiled boomers"" and idealized your mother's ability to make it work in the 70's and 80's ... well guess what?  Your mom didn't have as many bills back then - she didn't have a cellphone bill, internet bill - hell, tv was free, she did her hair and nails at home, if she had coffee outside of her home it was a $.20 cup at a diner, not a fancy coffee from Starbucks... but these days we pay for all of that, on top of our car, mortgage, groceries, utilities, etc.  Your mom brewed coffee at home, she didn't have a coffee maker with k-cups ... a can of Maxwell House is infinitely cheaper.  We have more stuff now, it doesn't come for free.  And that is everywhere in the world.  Nothing comes for free.  

Another thing, you could never survive as a homeowner... you think rent is expensive... wait until a hot water heater breaks, or you need a new roof, or a pipe bursts in your bathroom.  Then you're really fucked.  And there is no such thing as a social service to provide you with new roof.  Anywhere.  

And lastly ... I promise you, not I, nor anyone I know is one paycheck away from losing everything.  I learned to live within my means and have savings for an emergency.  You know what I don't have?  My hair done professionally, diamond paintings, a $150 bong or weed.  

Grow up.  Whatever damage your parents did to you  - you've officially been outside of their home for longer than you were in it.  It's high time you moved on.  ",13,1730252562.0,BottomFeedersofYT,3,1.0,False

1gfbevu,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1gfbevu/my_son_and_i_built_a_free_library_in_our_front/,my son and i built a free library in our front yard. someone left a book in it.,"My neighborhood isn't your cliche movie neighborhood. The lawns aren't perfect, kids don't leave bikes lying around on the sidewalks, and neighbors don't smile and wave as you drive by.  We all kind of mind our own business, for the most part. To be honest, I don't think I've ever had a conversation with any one of my neighbors. But to my defense, my neighborhood isn't built like a traditional neighborhood.

I live in Castro Valley. Emphasis on the ""valley."" The entire town is built on hills. The block I live on resembles more of a roller coaster than a street. I wish I could say you get used to living like this, but you don't. My house is smack in the middle of a hill; and after a decade of living here, I've discovered that I'm a ""house half uphill"" kind of guy.

My ten-year-old son, Cooper, loves it here. There's a single-screen movie theater down the street, next door to that is a comic book shop, across the street is an ice cream parlor, and a few blocks over is Golfland. I'm convinced that Castro Valley was designed by a child.

Cooper had overheard my wife and I talking about how unfriendly our neighborhood felt and he had an idea of how we could do our part in fixing it. When he visits my mother-in-law, they like to go on walks. I guess a neighbor of hers has one of those Little Free Library things in their front yard. The mailbox looking thing that the owner fills with books, and anyone walking by is encouraged to trade one of their own books for one in the library. Cooper said we could fill it with all of our favorite books, so our neighbors could get to know us a little better.

He had spring break coming up, and I had vacation days lying around, so I planned on taking the week off to spend with him. I figured building the library was a great opportunity for a father-son project.

The sun was setting, and admittedly, it may have taken a little longer than anticipated to build, but there it was nonetheless. We took a step back and admired the little library that was now standing firmly in our yard. I handed him a paintbrush and told him that all the library was missing was a name. He gave it some thought, then started with the brush. When he moved away, I could see that he painted ""Greenridge Road Library"" in big green letters. Fittingly named after the street we live on.

The next day, I peeled myself off of my mattress and dragged my feet into the kitchen. Cooper was sitting on the couch, fully dressed, shoes tied, hair brushed, ready to go. I have weird attachments to all of Cooper's stuff. He's our only child, so every little thing of his is tethered to precious memories. I couldn't just let him put his books, which my wife and I read to him over the years, outside for strangers to take. So, I told him we would go to the bookstore to get new books to use.

Before we left, Cooper ran over to check our Greenridge Road Library. I hurried to catch up to him when I saw him jumping up and down with excitement. He screamed ""Dad! Dad! Look!"" And to my surprise, there was already a book sitting inside of the little library, patiently waiting for us to adopt it.

It was a Penguin Random House children's book titled: ""How to Swim and Dive."" It was a cute, little, vintage, book about learning how to swim. And even though it was covered in a clear, but yellowing, protective jacket; the book was extremely weathered. It looked decades old. The style of the cover art and pictures throughout the pages made me think it may be midcentury era. The once bright colored spine was cracking and had a slight tear through the ""V"" in the book name, giving it the new title: ""How to Swim and Die."" That got a guilty chuckle out of me.

The book jacket proudly wore a sticker for the Hayward Public Library. Hayward is Castro Valley's sister city, so it wasn't too surprising that a book from there ended up minutes away in our front yard. What was surprising was the fully intact checkout card still in the sleeve on the inside. The only name and date on the card were: Roger Davis on April 3rd, 1964.

Out of curiosity, I Googled the name Roger Davis. Facebook and LinkedIn profiles popped up, all of smiling young men that were half of the age my Roger Davis would be today. I tried to narrow the search down by adding ""California,"" but no luck. I'm old enough to remember life before the internet, So I went to scavenge for The Yellow Pages book that I thought we still had somewhere.

If I had given it any real thought, I would have remembered that we got rid of our last one about five spring cleanings ago. I figured this would be the perfect time to introduce my son to the public library system. I told Cooper that we could go to the Hayward Library; since that was where the book was originally from. And we could maybe even see if they could look up any information on Roger Davis.

Although he was incredibly eager to get inside and work the case, Cooper still held the library door open for the fragile moving old man walking behind us. The librarian glared at me over the top of her thick lenses, with an ""Are you serious?"" look on her face. She sighed and lectured me on why she couldn't share the private information of their members, even if they had it. Which they didn‚Äôt. Those records were long gone. Also long gone: the Yellow Pages, apparently. I don‚Äôt know why I assumed the library would have them, but they didn‚Äôt. So, I ordered one on my phone to be delivered to my house and we left. On the way out, Cooper whispered to me that he'd be a nicer librarian for The Greenridge Road Library.

The following day was a hotter than usual spring day. My wife and I decided that a family day at the community pool sounded good. We didn't have a pool in our backyard, and no one else we knew did, either. And as a result, Cooper wasn't the best swimmer. But lucky for him, we just so happened to have come into the custody of a how-to swim book.

We got to the pool and I had the highly important job of securing pool chairs for my family. It took me a little while to collect enough chairs. It would have taken longer, if not for the elderly gentleman who graciously volunteered his chair to me. His attempt at hiding from the sun under a bucket hat and sunglasses was failing, so he was leaving anyway. He was amused that I was carrying around such a vintage book. On his way out, he gave the faintest smile and said that he had the same book when he was younger.

I started thumbing through the pages to see if there were any good pointers that I could relay to Cooper, and I must not have looked hard enough the first time we found the book because I now noticed handwritten numbers on the bottom corner of every page. Two numbers on each page and they didn't correspond to the page number at all. The first page had ""37."" The next one had ""66,"" the third page had ""46,"" and so on; fifteen numbers in total. There was no obvious reason or pattern to the order, but they were neatly written and obviously intentional.

I'm not too proud to admit that my wife is smarter than I am, but I still felt like a complete idiot when it only took her a millisecond to glance at the pages and say ""Oh, neat! It's coordinates.""  Of course. Why wasn't that my first guess? Cooper asked what coordinates were and when I explained them to him, he got really excited at the thought of it being buried treasure. That excitement soured to disappointment when I shot down his proposal to go chase the coordinates that exact minute. I told him we could go the following day, and then hit the biggest cannonball he's ever seen as a distraction.

Cooper shook me until I fully woke up. He wouldn't stop until I had Google Maps open. He watched with anticipation as I typed in each number of the coordinates. The pin dropped into a cluster of trees, a little ways off of the Ward Creek walking trail in the Hayward hills. To his delight, it was only a ten-minute drive away.

Cooper was so excited walking that trail. He's not an introvert, but he rarely talks to strangers. That day, he was waving and saying hi to everyone we crossed paths with. The family walking their dog got a hey from Cooper. He said ""Have a nice day"" to the pale-haired, old man, that was catching his breath on a bench. One jogger even got a high-five from Cooper.

I couldn't help but feel like an irresponsible parent when we reached the point of the walkway that we had to diverge off of to get to the coordinates. It didn't seem like the safest trek for a ten-year-old to make, but I couldn't stomach telling him that he couldn't see this through. As we approached the coordinates, I could make out glimpses of unnatural colors in the distance. At first, I thought it was a group of people, and slid Cooper behind me as we walked up.

Standing directly on top of the coordinates, we were dead center to a group of trees. On each tree, was a t-shirt nailed to it; creating a surrounding audience. The shirts were small, like they'd fit Cooper. Six in total. Vintage, ringer style shirts with red trim and matching red font that read ""Hayward Plunge."" On the inside tags, I could make out handwritten names: John, Henry, Susie, Wayne, Donna, and Jackie.

I had no idea what Hayward Plunge meant or who these names belonged to, but that didn't really matter, I was full on panicking. My fight or flight was in high gear. This wasn't the innocent treasure hunt we thought it would be. This was wrong, very wrong. I was wrong to bring my son here. I played enough high school football to know what dried blood stains looked like on fabric.

I didn't want to let Cooper see the concern on my face, and I knew he was on the verge of asking if we could start digging for the treasure that he thought was beneath us. I needed to get him out of there as soon as possible. I tried to drum up fake enthusiasm and say we needed to celebrate us making it to the finish line. I told him we deserved ice cream for our hard work. He wasn't ready to leave until I told him he could get as many scoops and toppings as he wanted. Luckily, that was enough to get him out of there.

I thought a night of sleep would help distance me from the kid's shirts on the trees, but it didn't. It was on my mind as I got out of bed, and as I made my coffee, and was very prominently on my mind as I stood at the front room window watching my own child play in the front yard. I watched him look under rocks for bugs, and lay in the grass, and eventually check The Greenridge Road Library. Then, I watched him run into the house holding a stack of books.

He proudly laid them out on display. My stomach turned as I realized they were more vintage books. Artwork and color palettes from an era long gone. Titles like ""The Clumsy Cowboy"" and ""Hurry Up, Slowpoke."" I peeked over his shoulder as he grabbed one and skimmed through the pages. On the inside cover, read the generic ""this book belongs to:"" with Wayne scribbled under it.

For the last twenty-four hours, six names have been playing on a loop in my head. Wayne was one of them. I grabbed a different book and opened it: Susie. I didn't need to grab anymore, I already knew what I'd find. But I did anyway. One inside cover after the other; John, then Jackie, then Henry, and finally Donna.

I was ready to tear the Greenridge Road Library out of the ground at this point. I scoured through my Ring notifications. Ever since we installed the library, it seemed like all of Castro Valley stops by and looks through it. I had hundreds of clips of people in front of it. It could have been any one of them. I dissected each clip to see if I could find who left the books. The problem was that the library was positioned in a way that the camera couldn't see if someone was taking or placing books. To be honest, this made me incredibly skeptical of my neighbors. Was it the dad walking his kids? The moms pushing strollers? The dog walker group? The mailman?

I gave up the hunt and set my phone on my lap as the clips continued playing. At this point, I was fully losing it. I don't know why this upset me as much as it did. It's not like someone is putting inappropriate material in the library. No one was committing crimes. It was just weird and creepy. I thought maybe it was an elaborate prank. I was willing to accept it as a prank and move on.

When I picked up my phone, it was halfway through a clip. There was no one in front of the Greenridge Road Library, or my house. So, I was confused as to why this was recorded. Then in the corner of the frame, I noticed an old man, standing across the street, and looking at the library. He remained still for an uncomfortable amount of time before turning and leaving. The video was super grainy and he was so far away that I couldn't make out any details of his face. It felt strange, though. This was enough to make me want to solve all of this, simply so I could feel like my family was safe in our home.

I tried to take inventory of all the information I had. The books, the names, the year on the library card, the coordinates, and the blood stained shirts on the trees. Shirts that had text on them. ""Hayward Plunge."" I typed the phrase into a search bar. The first suggestion was a link to the Hayward Parks and Rec website. To the right of that was a small collage consisting of a map, street view, and picture of the inside of a building.

Built in 1936, the Hayward Plunge is an indoor swimming facility. It's essentially one big pool inside of a hangar-like structure. Additionally, after seeing the map of where the plunge was located, I realized the trail that I was just on the other day, ran directly behind the building. Finally, things were starting to click.

I was waiting at the front desk as the teenager working it went off to get the manager. I felt a little foolish, but at this point, there was no way I could leave this thread loose. The manager came walking up and asked how they could help me. I took a deep breath and made the jump. I explained how I came into possession of Roger Davis's swim instruction book, how it led me to the trail, and to the displayed Hayward Plunge shirts. Which all brought me there to speak with her.I don't know what I was expecting. It was a lot of random information to unload on an unsuspecting stranger. I for sure wasn't expecting the manager's face to drop like it did. She paused for a second, then asked ""Could we talk in my office?""

I took a seat at the desk across from her. She didn't hesitate. She said, ""Back in the day there was a small beginner swimming class that had some students who went missing."" That was chilling enough, but she continued. ""This was in the 60's, so they didn't have camera surveillance or anything like that. The Hayward P.D. didn't have any evidence of who took the kids or where the kids went."" I didn't know what to say. I didn't need to say anything, because she wasn't done. This time needing a little more strength, eventually pushing out, ""It's like, an urban legend around here, so take it with a grain of salt; but people say their swim instructor had something to do with the missing kids."" I could see it in her eyes before her words came out. I knew what was coming next. She looked me dead in the eye and said, ""The instructor, his name.... was Roger.""

Everything was still spinning when I strapped my seatbelt in and it didn‚Äôt stop during the drive home. What did I invite to my home? What danger did I put my son in? Who or where was Roger Davis? That last question would be answered a lot quicker than I anticipated.

Waiting for me at our front door, was the gigantic waste of paper that is, the Yellow Pages. It made a huge thud on my kitchen table when I set it down to grab a beer. I could feel it staring at me the whole time. Begging me to open it. I knew I had to, but I really didn't want to. I was already fed up with this whole situation. It had escalated to points that I was not prepared for. I looked back at the yellow pages. It was just sitting there. I took a swig of beer and said fuck it.

I found the residents section and made my way to the names under D. It didn‚Äôt take long to put my finger over the first Davis. It was a page over and near the bottom, but there he was. Roger M. Davis. I should have left it there. Cool, I found him. Mission accomplished. I should have taken the win and moved on with my life. But I just couldn't help myself. I needed to know.

I panned to the right of his name, where his address was. I felt my beer rising in my throat as I did. Next to his name and under ""current address"" was, Green Ridge Road.

The scariest house isn't always the one that looks like it. It's not always the dilapidated house with the dead lawn and shady looking tenets who won't make eye contact with you. Sometimes it's the house that's painted in the friendliest shade of soft yellow. The one that has an American flag perfectly flying from the porch. The one with the old man that comes out like clockwork to hand water his lawn. The house that you have no problem sending your kid to their front door for candy on Halloween. What is it they say about book covers?

Roger Davis was arrested for the murders of John and Jackie Miller, ages 9 and 8. Donna Zimmerman, age 7. Wayne Jackson, age 8. Susie Lee, age 8. Henry Parker, age 6. Almost sixty years after he committed the crimes. He was 86 at the time of his arrest.

I gave the police everything I had. They used fingerprints from Henry Parker's copy of ""The Rise and Fall of Ben Gizzard,"" that was left in our library, to match with some found on belongings of his that his diligent mother kept well preserved after all these years. Roger's prints were also a match on all of the kid's books, as well as the ""How to Swim and Dive"" manual we found in our little library.

Cadaver dogs hit on the area of the coordinates and they were able to recover the remains of all the children. My stomach still fills with shame and dread because I willingly brought my son to the burial site. I let him stand feet above the bones of murdered children as we played around on a pretend scavenger hunt.

We were in the middle of dinner weeks later when I heard the sirens. Flashing lights followed, reflecting off our walls. Our street doesn't get police activity very often, if at all. I knew who they were coming for.

It took me a couple of minutes to walk down my street and get to the house surrounded by the crime scene tape. As I approached, two officers walked out a slightly hunched, white-haired man, in handcuffs. He looked frail and confused, and unremarkable from any other elderly person in the community. He wasn't someone who looked like they would be getting arrested. The policemen closed the squad door behind him, regardless.

I observed him as he sat in the backseat of the cop car. He wasn't moving at all and he was seemingly focused on the nothingness in front of him. He stayed like this for an uncomfortable amount of time.

An officer told me he couldn't share any information on the case, not knowing that I was the one who revived the six cold cases with my findings. There wasn't much more for me to see, and it felt like it was time for me to head back home.

I looked one more time at Roger. I just wanted to burn into my eyes what evil could look like, so I never put my son in danger ever again. After a few seconds, the vile old man slowly started to turn his whole body towards the window. Towards me.

His face was blank and devoid of any humanity. He pointed his vacant and dark eyes at me. I could see the faintest bit of recognition from him once he saw me. I didn't want to look away. I didn't want to give him the satisfaction of seeing fear on someone one last time. Even if I was terrified inside.

My last glimpse of him, before the car hauled him away, was the slow movement of his mouth forming the slightest, perverted, grin. He was enjoying this. He knew that he'd die soon, and he'd essentially got away with his crimes. I don't think that's what made him smile in that moment, though.

He knew that I'd see him again. Every time I watched someone leave a book in the Green Ridge Road Library for Cooper, or when Cooper's baseball coach pulls him aside to give him tips on his swing, or when I had parent-teacher conferences and met Cooper's teachers. He knew that I'd see him in every one of those people that I was trusting to be around my son.

He knew that's how he would live on.",5,1730252317.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

I'm presently staying in the Walker Square area here in town looking for a house I can rent out, with a preference for a top floor bedroom for myself, mostly for the privacy, peace and quiet.

For now, at this point in my life, I'm going to settle for roomies, and would be looking for something chill - social occasionally, in passing, but no obligation either - I'm coming from a really rough ride in life start to present and need a year to recover. I'm here in Milwaukee to do that and then move some year or two later to Washington state to teach at UW!

And so the word of the day is; Ambivert! An ambivert typically enjoys other people, but needs time alone, maybe social ambivert might be accurate too - and likewise other ambiverts are welcome. ^_^

I'll be working from such a home remotely, and have been doing so for the past several years after graduating and traveling from central Virginia across Iowa/Nebraska, Seattle, Port Angeles, Victoria, Vancouver, Honolulu, Tokoyo, and Sapporo before passing back through Virginia and having misadventures in Chicago and then coming here. I've enough saved to take a break and rest, no problem.

Fellow travellers are also welcome! Haha.

Aside from that, I've interests in psychology and tech, love coffee, books, gaming, TV shows, late nights, sometimes nocturnal altogether, and the great outdoors with long walks.

I'm looking for neighborhood recommendations with houses for a more laid back and suburban if not academic feel, probably more north end than south of my experience and travels are anything to go by, and anyone who's also looking in the area to reach out in comments or DMs to do so and we can chat and see if we mesh! All genders and backgrounds welcome!

I'm looking forward to exploring Milwaaauuukeeeeee!!!

Making my rounds on Facebook and other various social and renting, etc, sites for this, too. My time is extremely limited for now, and I have medical issues I'm powering through so I'd be grateful for patience - don't worry if I don't get back right away.

And with that?

I've worked there a bit over a year now and my manager takes tips. I've worked at 2 other coffee shops before this and managers were never allowed to take tips, but I assumed this might just be a kiosk in a store thing and kind of moved on. I was irritated by it but didn't do anything because we could give her a portion of the tips based on if she was actually in the kiosk or not, or if she'd just been in her office. 

Back in May of this year, we gained access to card tips because corporate moved us to the Starbucks system rather than our grocery store system. Cash tips are still divided between the baristas behind the kiosk at the end of each shift, but card tips are distributed based on hours worked that week (in cash for some reason as well rather than just being added to our paycheck). 

Because she's the only full time employee of us (and not salaried to my knowledge), she gets a large portion of the card tips, and is being tipped for essentially being in her office as she is only in the kiosk for maybe 2 hours a day if we're being generous. I looked into it more and found that no manager is allowed to be part of a tip pool, and it says so on the U.S. Department of Labor website on multiple pages. I actually also reported her/the store to them back in July after reading that, but they never got back to me/I have no idea if they did anything because nothing has changed at my store. 

My co-worker that has only been there a few months and has never worked in a coffee shop asked the store manager about it today (she said she'd do it so she could have plausible deniability should our manager try something since she could claim she just didn't want the store to get in trouble and wanted to make our store manager aware) and he said that they do a tip pool (for Starbucks employees) at our store and the manager is included in that. I looked into it a bit more and found that some licensed stores can make some of their own rules about stuff, but since this is technically a federal law, so I figured I'd ask here and see if that's a thing they can do or if I call the Department of Labor again to see if they'll do anything.

In August, we went back to school and of course, there's an ice breaker scheduled for after lunch.

Always end up replacing the laptop every 5ish years due to overheating/performance issues. (Anyone know what to do with the old laptops?) Now have a job where I am home every night so figured it was time to build my own PC to enable part upgrades instead of replacing the entire device. Also coming up on the big 40yr anniversary of my entrance to the world so figured I‚Äôd splurge on my own gift. 

Now for the fun part. I want to build a very portable (Read ‚Äúsmall‚Äù) device as I will be bringing it out to the couch every time I want to use it and will be putting it away when I am done. Want to play it the same way as a laptop on the couch so am looking for some sort of monitor that can sit on the coffee table, or on a portable stand of some sort. I will NOT be playing it on the TV. This is to still be near the family and not at a desk in another room whenever I want to play. I haven‚Äôt worked all those peripheral kinks out yet, but hoping that‚Äôs where y‚Äôall can see my vision and show me what options are out there. 

Used this sub to build my son‚Äôs pc and it has worked out great. He loves it. Hoping y‚Äôall can help me out as well!! Thanks in advance!

New build or upgrade?

New build. Planning to build it as soon as I can get a good blueprint. 

Existing parts/monitors to reuse?

Just a mouse. 

PC purpose?

Couch gaming. Some web browsing. Small family spreadsheets/documents. Important file/paper scan storage. 

Purchase country?

USA. No Microcenter close enough to be feasible to drive. 

Monitors needed?

Yes. Portable or able to be mounted on a portable stand. High quality to help my eyes with detail. 15‚Äù laptop was my norm with 240hz so nothing smaller than that I‚Äôd say but not looking for a 55‚Äù behemoth. 

Budget range?

 Flexible (Happy birthday to me!!) but not looking to spend $5k,‚Ä¶I‚Äôd guess $2k for the PC should do it, no? Peripherals can be extra. 

WiFi or wired connection?

Must have fast WiFi. 

Size/noise constraints?

Small. Portable. Sffpc style would be ideal but willing to see what yall think is best for my situation. I won‚Äôt really be traveling with it but from where I store it to the side of the couch. 

Color/lighting preferences?

Stealth mode activated. White is fine. No flashy RGB. 

Any other specific needs?

Tiny. Portable. Able to be sitting on the couch and have Keyboard on lap and mouse on couch cushion and mousepad. Monitor somehow in front of me.

1gfb0sp,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkAndDarker/comments/1gfb0sp/a_message_to_sdf_and_terry/,A message to SDF and Terry.,"SDF and Terry. Here's my actual suggestion/critique.

I prefer what you are trying to do now. I would love a pvevp dungeon crawler RPG. Its why i started playing in pt.3. But it's too late. That vision was abandoned around the same time pt.5 and EA launched.

You started off with an amazing PVEVP Dungeon Crawler RPG. Talking  about plans for things like Guild halls, skill trees, a small open world hub, actual RPG elements, and a roadmap that would make this the best and only true PVEVP Dungeon Crawler RPG on the market. You hyped that vision up early and often in discord and actually communicated that vision before hundreds of thousands of players even found the game. Me and a ton of other more casual players fell in love with that vision.

However, as your player base expanded you  you listened to the ideas of new players who had a different vision. A community coming to your game because they felt betrayed by games like Hunt, The Cycle, and Tarkov. Games that have all abused their playerbases and disrespected their time and money.

You gave a massive population of refugees from these games a new home, then started building systems to suit their needs vs the prigional vision.

You turned Dark and Darker into fantasy Tarkov to chase that massive wave of players. This isn't the players fault. They aren't being whiney. They spoke up about what they wanted. Instead of politely and directly expression your vision you adapted to the new playerbase. This isn't bad. What is bad is abandoning the people who bought into the first vision and now abandoning the players who have now made your game home, who have already been burned by several other games.


How did this happen? Easy. None of the original vision was actually worked on and instead you took every aspect of Tarkov and started cloning it because that's what those players want. They want a development team that actually cares about them and their needs. They deserve it. Up until recently you've been providing that. No matter how chaotic the development of the game was they supported you. And now you're abandoning the new players because the game is becoming something you never intended or designed it to be. That, is going to be your down fall.

It's too late to turn back the clock. You should never have changed course from your origional vision. But you did and you now need to own that decision or risk losing everything. This game is never going to be what you want to develop again and be successful. You threw away that good will and chance at success when you pivoted to fantasy Tarkov.

Your game is now well established as fantasy Tarkov. It's too late to go back. If you wanted to return to your original you should have expressed that with a clear roadmap and statement about your vision for the game. What the hell do you actually want the game to be now? This should have been done un conjunction with one massive update and a marketing push more than six months ago. Preferably on the test server before live.

It's now going to be one thousand times more difficult to recapture those hundreds of thousands of casual players trust then to try to steal players who are already looking for an alternative to the still struggeling Tarkov, cancled Cycle frontier, and barely improving Hunt Showdown.

If you want to succeed long term, you need to lean into the community that you have currently and develop a game that doesn't fit your ""origional vision"". It sucks, but throwing away all of your current players trust simply isn't the way forward. It's also super disrespectful to their time and agency.

You've already done this once by switching to Fantasy Tarkov and lost 80% or more of your playerbase. A playerbase who supported you through legal issues. Bough terrible coffee to support you. Bough over priced merch to make sure SDF stayed out of jail and so you could affoard lawyers. You abandoned the very people who helped you ""make it"". Now you're abandoning the people you left behind to shift directions. This is insanity. How can anyone trust your conviction to any one vision?


You're just going to alienate everyone you still have then have to spend tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in marketing to recapture the casual player base you abandoned with every change you've made since Pt.4.

It sucks and you might not believe me. But I guess only time will tell. I wish you the best of luck and I'll be here for the ride regardless. I really am hoping you can pull this off, because your original vision sounded sick as fuck and is one of the inspirations for my own game. But as someone who fell in love with the original vision and dedicated his time, energy, and money to providing insight during the court cases you're fucking up. You're directly screwing over the players that you abandoned players like me for.

This is going to be a speed run of how to shutter a studio that had lightning in a bottle if you're not careful. No one wants that. Please be careful and respect the time of the players you still have.",0,1730251124.0,DarkAndDarker,2,0.23,False

The first date we went out for coffee and spoke for 2 hours in the shop and 6 hours after just in her car. The second date we did lunch and a movie after studying and spoke for like 8 hours after both of those, like the connection was so strong, conversation was effortless.

Well she invited me over to her home and we slept together for the first time, and this is where I feel like such a POS. I just wasn‚Äôt into her when she took off her clothes. I had an exam earlier in the day and was stressed and blamed my inability to finish on that, but truth be told it was a lot of things; the exam, me not being super attracted, size struggles (I‚Äôm not bragging, it hurt her physically a lot, she was bleeding at the end and I felt it was tough for me to stay hard physically because of anatomy and mentally since I knew it hurt but she kept insisting we keep going). 

After we stopped we just went to bed together and spent the majority of the rest of the next day together, genuinely enjoying each other‚Äôs company and cuddling/studying. Shes literally just such a bundle of green flags, she‚Äôs ridiculously clean and organized, super bubbly, motivated, and genuinely kind and I feel so fucking awful, I don‚Äôt want her to feel like I was just trying to get in her pants because I wasn‚Äôt.

Other context, shes lost a bunch of weight and is losing more, and usually wears super baggy clothes so I didn‚Äôt have the best idea of what she looked like, but honestly the lack of attraction extended beyond weight, and we are also lab partners with half the fucking semester left.

I don't see myself with her long term after this, and she‚Äôs put in so much effort up front, like writing me a card with various memes printed out inside, as well as insisting on paying for the second date even though I was totally willing and expecting to cover.

Therefore I can't go to bars or do fully ""adult"" things yet. I also do not have a full license yet nor a car. I struggle with high functioning autism  and adhd and that's part of the reason why I'm looking to cope and not go out and make friends until I work on managing symptoms more.

I've been alone for as long as I can remember, I've never had many friends, I've had a few relationships but never a group of friends. This has never bothered me too much previously, being alone was fine. I could do what I wanted without needing input and never had plans outside of work so I had plenty of free time.

That was my life for years, even before I was old enough to work I was home schooled and often spent my time studying or watching movies to keep myself entertained. It never bothered me before, but I've noticed recently that I'm starting to feel lonely. I don't exactly keep friends well due to struggling with autism and adhd, I'm an out of sight out of mind person and it's not fair for someone to have to always text or call first because I can't remember they exist unless I see them, and when I do remember they exist i can't get myself to STFU and often end up being too annoying to deal with because I can't keep myself from talking over people just yet. I'm working on it but it's taking time. Overall, I'm just not in the place where it's ok to be friends with anyone and a manage a friendship. It'd be toxic for everyone involved.

However, as I go through the motions I'm starting to feel sad doing things I once enjoyed doing alone, like going out window shopping or going to get coffee. Things that I was once ok with doing alone just seems boring now.

I'm not exactly looking for advice to find friends, because let's be real- I'm in a small town and everyone my age is already close knit and not taking new people,  and people I do find are often too old to be friends with an 18yr old even if we have insightful discussions. I'm looking for advice on how to go back to enjoying being alone.

I wouldn't say it's depression, all other areas of my life are fine- if not better, I'm getting back into hobbies I once enjoyed and I'm living my best life in all other aspects aside from friendship. I imagine this is something that can be easily fixed with some mind reframing so I'm hoping people here can help. 

Direct questions I'm wanting answers to:

How did you feel at peace with being alone again if you have ever felt a tinge of loneliness?

How did you prevent the loneliness from coming back?

Not translated: Any time there are already subtitles which are accurate. Any time Tian says something in Canto, and then immediately says the exact same thing in English.

These are translated to sound natural in English, and as such, might not be PRECISE word for word translations, as that would sound extremely broken in English. All the meaning and intent behind the conversation is there and as much as is possible, it's word for word.

2:48 - Bin sits with Kenny, playing chess. Bin gets upset.  
Kenny responds in Canto: Dad, enough!

S1Ep3:  
12:44  
Tian is speaking to Kenny in the Diner, after Bin has died. Tian seems almost suspicious of the circumstances. Kenny tries to reassure her. Directly in the middle of this conversation where Tian is suspicious, Sara walks in. There is definitely layers to the scene added by understanding the Canto.

Tian: I'm very scared. Why would that happen? They are normally VERY careful.  
Kenny: Whatever happened last night, it's worse than anything that's happened to us before, but it was an accident.

\*TL NOTE: When Kenny responds, his exact words are, Whatever happened last night, it's gotten way more intense, but it was an accident. That sounds a bit broken so I cleaned it up to impart meaning.\*

\~Later\~  
Jade walks into the Diner, still thinking he's in an escape room. Tian hits him in the head with a whisk, and yells at him.

""YOU'RE BUTTING IN LINE! There's a line! You have to get in line! ... GET. IN. LINE!""

\~Later\~ Jade moves the coffee pot, talking to Kenny.  
Tian grabs it from him: This doesn't belong here! You have to put it back where it belongs!

S1Ep4  
Sara walks into the diner, as Tian is crying over Bin. She quickly gets her game face on and says to Sara  
""Why are you just standing there? Hurry up and come here, there's a lot to do today.

\~Later\~  
Jim and Ethan come to the diner and order pancakes.  
Tian brings the pancakes to Ethan.

""Here are your special pancakes you requested!""

(offscreen, presumably to Sara 'that doesn't go there, that should go over there').

S1ep6  
Kenny's mom, dealing with Jade at the diner, serves him tea.  
Tian: Drink it!  
Jade (in English): I don't want any tea  
(Jade starts looking for a book with the symbol)  
Tian: No, not that one... (hands him the correct book with the symbols)

S1ep7  
Tian is dealing with Jade, who is now living with them and laying in bed refusing to get up and come to eat dinner, she starts screaming at him.

Tian: GET UP! Stop being so lazy! If you don't get up and come downstairs like a normal person...

This is probably gonna be a long one so sorry in advance.

So this probably started a few months ago, me (22f) and my boyfriend (22m) have been together for 2 years, everything was great when we first got together. We had been together previously when we were 15/16 but split, lost contact etc. After a few months of being together I had got my own place and he moved in with me.

When he moved in I asked if he could help me pay towards the bills if I need help. He agreed as he was working at the time. He then lost his job and done(and is still doing) an illegal job that I don‚Äôt want to name lol. We‚Äôre both marijuana smokers so he would pay for our weed and I would pay for the roof over our heads. 

After a few months he let slip that sometimes he tries to calculate how much money he‚Äôs spent on weed for the two of us and multiple shop trips/buying food. I was a bit taken back by that because I didn‚Äôt think about how much money i‚Äôm spending on two people when I get a one person salary. We then had multiple arguments over numerous things, the main thing being that he didn‚Äôt get sex often enough. I apologised but I have an unhealthy relationship with food and sometimes can‚Äôt stand the sight of my own body.

He would say that i‚Äôm using that and my mental health as an excuse as to why I won‚Äôt give him sex. He would threaten to leave and I would always beg him to stay, but in these arguments it would always be my flat that gets destroyed. He broke one of my coffee tables during an argument, kicked my tv into the wall it dented the wall, head butted the fridge it caused a dent, kicked a cup and stained the wall, and more things.

After a while I just ended up getting fed up and just trying to please him because, and i know it‚Äôs probably selfish, but financially I can‚Äôt survive. When we moved in he bought his cat, and we ended up buying another one together, and then he (with me expressing I don‚Äôt want one) went and bought a dog. I know if i was to leave him he would take the dog and probably his cat with him. Which is fine but I can‚Äôt work because of my mental health and I can‚Äôt afford to pay my rent, all of my bills and buy food. He helps me (sometimes) buy food but normally it‚Äôs just takeaways.

Recently i‚Äôve just started to feel fed up with the relationship, he makes subtle little digs at silly things. Like if i was to wake up early and let him sleep in because he hasn‚Äôt told me he wants to be woken up, he‚Äôll make dogs about how I should‚Äôve woken him up. Or if he‚Äôs annoyed at me he will verbally say he‚Äôs ‚Äúfucking pissed off‚Äù but if i‚Äôm annoyed at him, I can‚Äôt express that otherwise it causes an argument.

I feel like I want to leave him and my friends tell me to leave him as well, I just don‚Äôt know if me feeling like this is a good enough reason?
