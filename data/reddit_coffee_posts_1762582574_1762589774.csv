Ava’s Story:Chapter 1

After the divorce, I dragged my shattered body to a small Southern town.

I changed my identity, got a new phone.

Everything connected to the Capital City was severed completely.

They all believed I was dead.

Killed in the brutal murder case that had rocked the entire military district.

For three whole years, white daisies, tributes to my memory, never ceased to appear on my grave.

Until one day, the glass door of my coffee shop was pushed open, and an old acquaintance walked in.

He stared, stunned, and asked why I hadn’t returned if I was alive.

Didn’t I know Ethan had been living with crippling guilt over my supposed death, almost taking his own life for me?

Ethan Walker was my ex-husband.

In the military, he had an arch-rival he’d been battling for over twenty years.

They had made a pact: neither could marry, their rivalry destined to last until old age.

But Ethan fell in love with me at first sight, relentlessly pursued me for years, and finally took me as his wife.

Chloe Hayes hated him for breaking his promise and unleashed all her rage on me.

The first time, Chloe lured me into a minefield. I accidentally triggered a landmine, and my bones shattered, my insides bled. I spent ten agonizing days in the ICU.

Ethan pulled every single string, flying in the most globally renowned specialists to claw me back from death’s door.

The second time, she just dumped me in the middle of a desert and ordered me to walk all the way home.

Ethan, frantic, aborted his entire drill and dispatched an entire recon company. They scoured the landscape for three days and three nights, until they finally found me, collapsing from dehydration shock, in the heart of the Mojave.

It was a twisted dance between them, a sick cycle of her harming me and him saving me, back and forth.

Until the ninety-ninth time…

Chloe somehow got the information from Ethan that I had a severe peanut allergy.

She took ten pounds of peanuts, ground them into a fine powder, and then force-fed them into my stomach through a feeding tube. I went into immediate anaphylactic shock.

As they rushed me into the ER, I used what little air I had left to beg Ethan, pleaded with him, to call the police. But he just shook his head, a helpless, resigned gesture.

“Sweetheart,” he murmured,“let’s just… let it go.”

“Chlo is a Gold Star Dependent, and she lacks security. She only feels alive when she’s fighting with you.”

“She didn’t know your allergy was that severe. She was just messing around, she didn’t actually mean to kill you. Please, for my sake, can we just let this one slide, okay?”

In that moment, my heart flatlined.

......

The next day, when I woke up in the base clinic, the first thing I did was call General Walker.

I knew he’d always considered my family background too common, completely unsuitable for his grandson with his brilliant future. He’d wanted me gone for ages.

“General Walker,” I said, my voice terrifyingly calm.“I agree to divorce Ethan.”

A beat of silence hung on the line. Then General Walker’s response was immediate and firm.“It’s good that you’ve come to your senses. I’ll have someone send over the divorce papers; you just need to sign them. I’ll handle the rest. Once the divorce is finalized, don’t ever appear before Ethan again.”

Not long after I hung up, his aide appeared in my hospital room, respectfully presenting me with a divorce agreement.

I signed my name, stroke by careful stroke, tears blurring my vision as everything related to Ethan flooded my mind, uncontrolled.

For three years of our marriage, he had been utterly devoted to me, anticipating my every need.

But when it came to Chloe, he had no boundaries.

The first time I met her, Chloe threw my service dog, who I’d raised for six years, into a live-fire zone. She watched it get blown to pieces right in front of me.

I cried, begging Ethan to hold her accountable, but he just held me, saying,“Avie, Chlo’s just a child at heart. She means no real harm. It’s okay as long as you’re alright.”

After that, time and time again, ninety-nine acts of cruelty—he brushed them all off as if they were nothing.

Now, I had finally made up my mind. I was ending this relationship with my own two hands.

My hand trembled as I clutched the pen. Tears splattered onto the signature line of the divorce papers, blooming into a blurry stain.

Taking a shaky breath, I painstakingly signed ‘Ava Winters’ across the page.

The aide tucked the papers away, giving me a subtle nod.“Ma’am, I will personally deliver your divorce certificate once it’s finalized. Until then, please keep this strictly confidential.”

After he left, I was left alone in the ward, and the silence was suffocating.

It wasn’t long before the door swung open again.

Chloe walked in, a black and white wreath clutched in her arms, a sickeningly sweet smile stretching across her face.

My body instantly went rigid, and I instinctively scrambled backward.“Y-you… what are you doing here?”

She casually tossed the wreath to the floor, her smile sickly sweet, yet utterly venomous.“I’ve come to send you off. Since that severe allergy didn’t manage to kill you, I guess I have to do it myself.”

No sooner had the words left her mouth than she lunged onto the bed, her hands clamping around my throat, squeezing tight!

I struggled desperately, but fresh from gastric lavage, I was no match for Chloe, with her years of training.

Air rapidly depleted from my lungs, and my vision swam, fading to black.

Just as my consciousness began to flicker, a nurse doing her rounds burst into the room, letting out a strangled scream.“Colonel Hayes! What are you doing? Get help! Someone, help!”

In the scramble, I clawed with my last bit of strength, grabbing the nurse’s hand.“C-call… the police…”

Then everything went black.

When I next woke, I was met with Ethan’s cold face.

His first words held no trace of concern, only a thinly veiled accusation, simmering with anger:“Ava, why did you call the police? Chlo has already been taken away by Internal Affairs!”

A sharp knife twisted in my chest, and the pain stole my breath.“She just tried to strangle me to death! You think I shouldn’t call the police?!”

Ethan’s brow furrowed, as if I were the one being irrational.“I’ve told you countless times, Chlo is a Gold Star Dependent. She’s just a child at heart, fundamentally not bad. She would never actually want to take your life…”

“Not really trying to kill me?!”

I cut him off sharply, three years of pent-up fear, injustice, and fury all erupted.

“She tricked me into a minefield, making me step on a bomb! She left me stranded in the desert for three days and three nights, force-fed me peanut powder, knowing I was allergic, and just now, she tried to choke me to death! Every single time, she’s tried to take my life! If the nurse hadn’t walked in, I’d be dead right now! Do you understand?!”

My raw despair seemed to hit him; he moved to embrace me, but I shoved him away.

“Don’t touch me! I’m not backing down this time. I’m going to make sure she faces a General Court-Martial!”

Ethan fell silent for a moment, his gaze hardening.“Chlo and I grew up together in the quarters. She’s just been a little spoiled, and I’ll deal with her. Seriously. I’ll have her confined, penalized, even discharged from the military if I have to! But I will not let her go to prison and ruin her life.”

Before I could react, the aide behind him stepped forward and handed a document to me.

“Sign it, and this whole thing goes away. We can go back to how things were.”

My gaze fixed on the blinding, oversized words “Waiver of Prosecution” on the document, a sharp ache piercing my chest. I shook my head, defiance burning in my veins.“I won’t sign it!”

“Chlo grew up on the base; she’s never been through anything like this. She won’t survive a place like the Brig. Avie, just listen to me.”

He pressed the space between his brows, as if his patience had finally worn thin.

“I said I won’t sign!” I practically roared, my voice raw.

The next second, the guard stepped forward, roughly grabbing my arm and wrenching it back!

A sharp cry tore from my throat.

Excruciating pain ripped through my body as he grabbed my trembling hand, forcing me to sign the waiver of prosecution. Then, he pressed my finger into the inkpad and slammed it down onto the paper.

The entire time, Ethan stood by, watching with cold indifference.

Sweat beaded on my skin from the agony, my face stark white. I gazed up at the man I had loved for years, my voice a frail whisper:“Ethan… For her… you’d do this to me…?”

A flicker of pain crossed his eyes, gone as quickly as it came, before he turned to the guard.“Get the military doctor. Make sure her hand gets the best possible treatment, and see that she’s well taken care of.”

Then he picked up the waiver of prosecution, stained with my blood and tears, and walked away without a backward glance.

For the next few days, Ethan didn’t show his face again, only sending a few perfunctory messages each day.

‘Tied up with military exercises. Can’t break free.’

‘Don’t be upset. When you get out of the hospital, I’ll throw you a party to celebrate.’

‘Does your hand still hurt? Take good care of yourself.’

But immediately after each message, Chloe’s texts would flood in.

They were all pictures of Ethan doting on her.

Feeding her porridge, giving her massages, even using that precious dagger he never let me touch to peel an apple for her.

That night, my hand hurt so much I couldn’t sleep. Driven by a desperate impulse, I found myself calling Ethan.

The phone rang for a long time, but no one answered.

After I hung up, Chloe’s message immediately popped up.

“Guess what we’re doing?”

Below was a video, its very thumbnail radiating an air of sizzling sensuality.

My hands trembling, I tapped to open it. In the video, Chloe was stark naked, her face flushed as she writhed on the bed.

Naked, she slid out of bed and from behind, clung tightly to Ethan’s waist, pressing her burning body flush against the stiff back of his military uniform.

“Ethan… don’t go… I feel terrible… The drug… the effects haven’t worn off yet…”

“If you leave… I’ll die… Please…”

Ethan’s steps abruptly halted. He turned back, glancing at Chloe, her eyes glazed over, his own filled with torment.

Finally, he gritted his teeth, disconnected my call, then turned, scooped Chloe up, and tossed her back onto the bed, his voice hoarse and tight with suppression:“Let’s get this over with!”

The video then plunged into darkness, leaving only the suggestive sounds of bodies intertwining and Chloe’s moans, a mixture of pleasure and pain.

I felt like I’d been plunged into an icy abyss, every drop of blood in my body turning to ice.

I clutched my phone, dialing Ethan’s number with a stubborn, desperate hope.

All through the night,527 calls—Ethan didn’t answer a single one.

Only the next day, as the sun climbed high, did a cold, clipped text finally arrive:“Urgent military duties yesterday.”

A tear slipped down my cheek, and a bitter, mocking twist of my lips.

So his “urgent military duties” really meant being utterly devoted to another woman, caring for her in the most intimate way imaginable.

Chapter 2

My birthday fell on the day I was discharged from the hospital. Ethan himself came to pick me up, and he even threw a lavish birthday banquet for me at the military base.

The banquet hall was grand and opulent, and he remained by my side the entire time, pinning the Distinguished Service Cross he’d received to my chest.

It drew countless envious gazes.

But all I felt was that medal pressing against my chest, a crushing weight.

Was it guilt driving him, or did he truly believe a bit of appeasement would make me forget all my pain?

Mid-way through the event, I felt like I was suffocating, so I excused myself to the restroom.

I had barely rounded the hallway corner when Chloe stopped me.

“Well, well, well, if it isn’t the happiest Brigadier General’s wife this evening.”

She leaned against the wall, arms crossed, a mocking sneer plastered across her face.

I wanted nothing to do with her, turning to leave, but she quickly stepped forward, blocking my path.

“Ethan values you so much, throwing you a banquet, giving you such a valuable military decoration. Feeling pretty smug about it, aren’t you?”

“But last time, when you called the police wanting to send me to a General Court-Martial, didn’t he still make you sign that waiver of prosecution to get me off?”

“Do you know how completely obsessed Ethan is with me? We’ve explored every single place. And you? You’re just a pathetic, unwanted wretch, shamelessly clinging to him like a leech. What makes you think you can ever compare to that?”

Her words were blunt, poisoned blades, slowly, relentlessly tearing at my already shattered heart.

My face was ashen; all I wanted was to escape.

But she wasn’t finished. She lunged, seizing my hand, her nails digging into my flesh. The pain was excruciating.

“You want to play tough? Fine. Since you won’t learn your lesson, I’ll make sure you never forget this!”

“I didn’t get to finish you off last time, but let’s see how lucky you are now!”

No sooner had the words left her mouth than two brawny men in combat uniforms materialized from the corridor shadows. They flanked me, each seizing an arm, and without a single word, they began dragging me into the penthouse suite on the top floor!

I thrashed and fought, terror clawing at my throat, but my strength was utterly useless against their brute force.

Chloe’s eyes glittered with pure venom and a twisted sort of triumph.“Ava, since Ethan likes you so much, I’ll just have to completely destroy you! Let’s see if he still wants a broken-down slut after I’m done!”

A man with a leering, repulsive face advanced toward the bed, a sickening smirk twisting his lips. I thrashed and screamed, fighting with every ounce of my being, but despair rose like a suffocating tide, threatening to drown me.

Chloe even pulled out her phone, ready to record every horrifying second!

Just as that vile hand was about to brush my dress, a deafening CRASH split the air as the suite door was violently kicked open!

Ethan burst in, a furious lion, his presence radiating a terrifying, almost violent aura.

His gaze instantly snapped to me, restrained on the bed, my clothes disheveled, and his eyes flared with pure, unadulterated fury. With a textbook military takedown, he instantly slammed the man who’d been reaching for me to the floor. The guy didn’t even have time to let out a gasp before he was knocked out cold.

“Avie!” He rushed over, undoing my restraints, and pulled my trembling body tightly into his arms.“Don’t be afraid, Avie. I’m here. You’re safe now…”

The terror of what I’d just escaped, combined with a tidal wave of crushing humiliation and injustice, instantly broke through. I collapsed in his arms, sobbing uncontrollably.

He scooped me up into his arms, carefully wrapping his jacket around me, and turned to leave.

As he passed Chloe, he stopped dead, his gaze turning to ice.“Chloe!” he snarled, his voice a low, dangerous rumble.“I’ve tolerated your spoiled antics for old times’ sake, but to stoop to such depraved tactics—!”

“If anything had happened to Avie today, I would’ve personally seen to it that you were executed under military law!”

Chloe stumbled back a step, startled by the blatant murderous intent in his eyes, then shrieked as if a raw nerve had been hit,“Shoot me dead?! Does our history mean so little compared to your few years with her?”

“Fine, Ethan! If you want my life, I’ll give it to you now!”

Without another word, she unexpectedly lunged towards the wide-open French windows. Before anyone could react, she plunged out, without a moment’s hesitation!

“Chlo—!” Ethan’s face instantly went white as a sheet. He dropped me almost instinctively, shooting towards the window like a bolt of lightning!

I hit the cold, hard floor unexpectedly, a sharp, searing pain shooting through my ankle.

I struggled to crawl to the window, only to see Ethan tearing downstairs like a madman, cradling a blood-soaked Chloe in his arms, and leaping into the military SUV.

The engine roared to life with a savage growl, and the SUV tore off, kicking up a cloud of dust. He didn’t spare me a single glance, not then, not ever.

I slumped to the cold ground, staring at the empty space where the car had vanished. My chest ached with a boundless coldness, a hollow silence.

Finally, I limped back alone to that so-called “home.

I hadn’t even had a moment to catch my breath when Ethan returned.

He burst through the door, grabbing my wrist with a force that threatened to shatter my bones.“Chlo’s kidneys are damaged, she needs a transplant urgently! You’re the only match in the entire city!”

“No! I won’t donate! Ethan, are you insane?! Why the hell should I save her?”

I shrieked, tears streaming down my face, desperately trying to yank my arm free from his grip.

But he held my arm even tighter, his gaze a disturbing mix of desperation and pleading.“Avie! Please, I’m begging you! Chlo jumped because of what I said. I can’t let her die! She’s so young! Donating one kidney won’t affect you much, I swear. I’ll get you the best doctors, take care of you, compensate you for everything, double, triple, whatever you want! Just… please, okay?”

“No! Absolutely not! You can kill me, but I won’t donate a single thing!”

I struggled, hysterically, but against his overwhelming power, it was utterly futile.

He eventually dragged me into the operating room, pinning me to the operating table!

Ethan! I hate you! I hate you!!

Before the anesthetic took hold, my screams were the last thing I registered.

Chapter 3

I woke again the next day.

Ethan was by the bedside. The moment he saw my eyes flutter open, he leaned closer, his face etched with guilt.“Avie, you’re awake? I’m so sorry… Does your incision hurt? What do you want to eat? I had them buy your favorite—”

He produced an array of costly tonics and presents, but I just stared numbly at the ceiling, my gaze hollow.

Later that day, when Ethan went out to get me some porridge, Chloe slipped into the hospital room again. She sneered,“Oh, look, the big hero who just donated a kidney.”

“Ava, you’re truly pathetic. Ethan always says he loves you, but no matter how I hurt you, he always takes my side in the end. And now he even made you donate a kidney to me! Why are you so clueless? Why do you insist on clinging to him?”

I just felt sick to my stomach. I croaked,“Get out.”

Her face instantly contorted. She glared at me, her eyes full of venom.“You’re asking for it, Ava. Don’t blame me!”

With that, she stormed out.

It wasn’t long before Ethan returned, his face dark. He burst into the room and practically ripped into me,“Avie! Why did you bribe a nurse to tamper with Chlo’s IV?!”

His question completely blindsided me.“…Tamper with what?”

“Chlo said! She said you hate me for forcing you to save her, so you bribed a nurse to add an allergen to her IV, causing her to go into anaphylactic shock, and she just barely made it out of the ER alive!”

His voice was stern, and his accusation brooked no argument.

All I felt was a bitter, icy stab to my heart.“Chloe has hurt me countless times, and you’ve never truly held her accountable! Yet, she frames me once, and you come at me, questioning me blindly without even bothering to find out the truth? Ethan, in your eyes, am I truly that malicious?”

“And aren’t you?” he challenged, his voice cold.“Who else but you would—”

“I didn’t!” I finally snapped, the torrent of suppressed emotions from far too long ago finally bursting forth. I shot up in bed, screaming through my tears:

“Ethan! I’m done! I’m absolutely, utterly done! You always believe her! You always side with her! My kidney is gone! She almost killed me! My body is covered in wounds!”

“And you?! What have you ever done for me, besides forcing me to apologize, forcing me to give up my kidney, and pushing me to the brink of death?!”

“Your love makes me sick! It’s absolutely revolting!”

He was visibly shaken by my outburst. As he stared at my hysterical face, a flicker of doubt and uncertainty crossed his eyes.

Before he could utter a single word, the hospital room door swung open. Chloe stood in the doorway, looking utterly frail, her voice barely a whisper:

“Ethan… You promised me… She almost killed me this time… You said I could have her for three days…”

Ethan looked from the frail Chloe to my own crumbling form. A fierce struggle warred in his eyes, but ultimately, he spoke to Chloe, his voice heavy:

“…Alright. But for these three days, Avie’s life must not be in danger. That’s my bottom line!”

“Don’t worry,” Chloe immediately promised.“I just want to teach her a lesson. I won’t take her life.

I stared at him in disbelief. Ethan, just to placate Chloe, would willingly hand me over to be tormented?!

“Ethan! You wouldn’t dare!” Terror gripped me as I tried to scramble out of bed. But he averted his gaze, his voice a low, heavy murmur:“Avie… it’s just three days… just bear with it… it’ll be over soon…”

With a wave of Chloe’s hand, two female soldiers in combat fatigues stormed in and mercilessly dragged my weak body off the hospital bed!

“Ethan! Save me! No! I can’t go!”

I sobbed desperately, my hand outstretched to him, but he merely clenched his fists, his eyes squeezed shut, rooted to the spot, completely unmoved.

For the next three days, Chloe held me captive in a remote military compound, subjecting me to every imaginable form of torture.

Whipping, needle jabs, electric shocks—she used every method to violate my body and strip me of my dignity.

Only when I was a bloody mess, barely clinging to life, did she finally stop, having her people dump me back in the emergency room like a piece of trash.

I had no idea how long I’d been unconscious. When I finally woke again, the doctor sighed in relief.“You’re finally awake…” he said, his voice tinged with exhaustion.“We almost lost you… We need to notify your family to come complete the paperwork.”

He handed my phone back to me.

Trembling, I opened my phone to find an encrypted message from General Walker waiting for me:“The divorce is finalized. Remember your promise. Disappear completely.”

The words stole my breath, a raw ache in my chest, yet a strange, numb relief washed over me.

The thought of Ethan’s obsessive nature clawed at me. My voice raw, I dialed General Walker’s private line.“Please,” I begged,“help me forge a death certificate. Use an unclaimed female body from the morgue to stand in for mine.”

“If I just vanished, Ethan would use every military resource at his disposal to find me, scouring the world. Rather than a lifetime of his relentless pursuit, it’s better he believes I’m dead. It’s the only way to truly end it.”

General Walker was silent for a moment. Finally, he conceded.“Go with my people,” he said.“I’ll handle the rest.”

With General Walker’s help, I mustered what little strength I had left, slipping out through the hospital’s back entrance and straight to the airport.

Meanwhile, Ethan glanced at his watch. The moment the three days were up, he immediately ended his military meeting and called Chloe, his voice laced with urgency.“Three days are up! Where’s Avie? I warned you, don’t you dare let her die!”

Chloe’s voice, sickly sweet, dripped with feigned innocence.“Oh, are you that attached to her? Don’t worry, I’ve already sent her back to the hospital. If you go now, you’ll be just in time to hear the good news: she’s been saved.”

Ethan immediately sped off. Just as he reached the operating room door, the light went out.

The doctor removed his mask, shaking his head gravely.“My deepest condolences, Brigadier General Walker… Ava was brutalized beyond recognition, her injuries too severe. Multiple organ failure. We did everything we could.”

Reddit friends, I apologize – *Pick of the Day* has had a rough week. Sports has been more volatile than usual (it tends to be at the beginning of November...) – mainly because it's early in the season and teams are still ""settling in"", so to speak. **For those curious, here's what else I had on the picks front today:**

 

**Picks (2/3)**

\-MIA Heat -5.0 (-110) ✅

\-DEN Nuggets -10.0 (-110) ✅

\-TOR Raptors v ATL Hawks Over 236.0 (-110) ❌

**Both the Miami Heat & the Denver Nuggets fared exactly as I'd hoped.** As for our ""Pick of the Day"" I'm not sure *what* happened to the Raptors and the Hawks! The second quarter was an absolute travesty – **Toronto had more turnovers than assists in the first half!** The game just *barely* cracked 200 points. Unbelievable.

 

***Note:*** I may take a couple of days off from posting *Pick of the Day* to Reddit (give sports a little time to mellow out...), but [I'll still be posting all of my picks to my site as per usual](https://bellespicks.com). I say this because one pick missing isn't so terrible if you've got 3 or 4 others pulling a profit still!

1orju0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1orju0a/3_weeks_off_caffeine/,3 weeks off caffeine,"Hey everyone, I thought I'd give an update on what I've noticed this far (or well, short) in.

My goals have been to decrease anxiety, get better sleep and get my hair back since it's been thinning a lot for 3ish years. 

Previous use has been between 2-9 coffees a day, amount varying throughout the past 7 years. 

First couple days I had a terrible headache, ibuprofen made me function. I missed the routine, the taste and the feeling of it kicking in. I also had a stuffed nose, but I don't know if that's related.

3 weeks in, I have no problem getting through my morning without it. I've been drinking a glass of water and doing crossword puzzles instead. 

Anxiety wise, I still get an increased heartbeat at multiple occasions, maybe even daily, but I definitely feel my scattered thoughts centering a bit. To some extent I still feel I ""forgot something"", but not such a crippling amount as before. 

My sleep has been a bit weird. I haven't slept more than before, and two nights I've had the most vivid and terrifying dreams of my life. I hope that the continued mildening of my worries during the day will compound and eventually make my sleep better.

As for my hair, I've had noticeably less hair fall. Before, running my fingers through my hair once it had dried after a shower would result in 10-20 ish hairs coming out. Now, it's been more like 2-7 hairs. I've also had quite a few baby hairs coming in on the front of my hairline. This is really encouraging and I so deeply hope it's not just a coincidence.

There you go, I'll make more updates later on if I notice further improvements or setbacks if that is interesting for y'all.

**Day 5–6: Scherzo in Mud Minor with Curry dressing**

Well... good things tend to end. The drums outside weren't just ambience - rain was marching in.

Caught a gap and rushed forward: Tom & Jerry with the rain. Quick chain lube stop, friendly local: “Follow the river.” Thanks, but no. I'd had enough refined German cycleways.

Suunto pointed straight into the forest. No rain anymore - just water everywhere, soaked even into the air itself. Paused for a photo, and right then a herd of deer, like a train, crossed the road exactly where I would have been a second later. Nice.

Mud. Puddle. Mud. Plash. Plush. The chain cracked at every link, begging for mercy. A farmer appeared, waving something agricultural and calmly explained in German that the next road was his - the calm was projected across fifty meters. De-grease. Re-grease. Re-think. I glanced at the chainstay sticker: Time to rename you GrЯzl. Mud. Mood. At that point, I honestly couldn't tell the difference.

The “Private road” signs stalked me. Nearly an hour later - a small town. A quick coffee stop - something warm, a few more turns, and... what the hell.

The road ahead was straighter than a ruler could draw. Thunderclaps in the distance sounded deadly serious about my next hour. Tailwind winked - “let's go.” Almost made it... until the downpour flooded everything. I dove into a bush, hiding under the trees.

A sign one meter from my face warned: Military area. Access prohibited. Live-fire zone. The same sign, in Polish, stood on the other side of the road. Suddenly, the small red passport in my bag felt less like ID and more like a punchline.

At least the rain washed the mud - even that finger-thick stripe across the saddlebag. Soon after, forest roads returned the mud. Balance restored.

One more clinically neat park, a postcard town chain, neatly ironed by bike lanes. Joggers, kids, laundry-detergent air. And there it was - Rakotzbrücke. Worth every drop of rain. Not much else around, though. Pair it with Bad Muskau. They belong together.

Supermarket stop. Tent up. A pair of MTB riders - spotless, as if they'd just rolled off a EuroVelo brochure - looked at me like I was a lump of the very mud I'd just scraped off the frame. Strange feeling, seeing those crisp-clean MTBs parked next to my mud-covered, happy-as-a-boar gravel bike. To be fair, I matched it.

The weather finally tuned the perfect tone. I finished the day swimming in the lake and purring quietly into the sunset - one more small dream from childhood camping on a sailboat.

Morning greeted me with bright sun and a reminder that not everyone cares about dress codes during stretching. The second long day looked promising.

Fast breakfast. Stuff-everything-in packing. Dryish roads led me along the Spree. A road sign said Unter den Linden in the middle of nowhere - a private joke for Berliners. Another sign lifted the speed limit right before entering the forest. German pedantry remains undefeated.

Cottbus greeted with a lush park. A friend of mine had rented an apartment conveniently right along my route, so no detour needed - chai, laughs, the familiar warmth that almost made me stay. But the road nudged me onward - Spreewald calling.

The forest began as cathedral-pure - pines in infinite rows. The map said Landstraße, which usually means a nice tarmac road... but this one? I was practically swimming on the bike through a sea of sand. The next few hours were a mix of stunning views and pure mental abrasion.

And then - tarmac. Relief first. Then: “Okay, how much more of that sand trench is ahead?”... Numbers on watch were rigorous: move now, or the pine becomes your hotel.

Supermarket that maps swore existed - didn't. Time sprint. Next town. Found one.

Grabbed food and, crucially, ice cream. Morale restored. Thirty minutes left until the campground would close. Ten kilometres to go. Full send.

Road ducked under crowns again - but stayed civilized. The campground rewarded me with a first-line lake spot. Unpack. Dinner. Swim. Beer.

185 km over two days - pinned to the wall.

1orjtne,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1orjtne/survival_mode_has_consequences/,Survival Mode Has Consequences,"My partner and I broke up almost three weeks ago. We were together more than 10 years. That morning she called me while I was recovering from an appointment with an ear, nose, and throat doctor. My whole mouth and nose were numb, and I had a bad headache. When I picked up, I said “What?” in an irritated tone. She told me she knew I had been cheating on her.

My heart sank because what she said was true. I admitted it.

That moment forced me to face the patterns and pain I’ve been trying to understand for months in therapy. Back in June, after being out of work for almost a year, I started a new job and began seeing a psychiatrist who specializes in childhood trauma and sexual abuse. They’re also my primary therapist. Our sessions are long and deep, focused on unpacking years of pain, shame, and the survival behaviors I learned early on.

I’ve been realizing how much of what I do comes from exhaustion, from always trying to manage emotional pain instead of actually living. I wanted to be a better partner. I loved her deeply and cared about her more than I ever showed. I was trying to be present and not live stuck in the past, but the pain I carried made me afraid to be honest, to say what I needed, or to ask what she needed. For years, I’ve wanted to tell her, “I want you in my life. Let’s figure out a solution together.” But instead of saying that out loud, I stayed quiet. I thought I was protecting both of us, but really I was just creating more distance.

She never knew the full story of what I went through. I only talked about it in vague ways because even saying the words brought up too much. One time, when I showed her the neighborhood where I grew up, I couldn’t even point to my actual house. The memories were that bad. I pointed to the one across the street instead.

I never slept with anyone else. The only time anything physical happened was one kiss. She kissed me, and I ran away almost immediately, scared and ashamed.

During COVID, when we were apart a lot, the isolation hit me hard. I started to go numb again. I’d sometimes go out just to have conversations with people. It wasn’t romantic or sexual. I just wanted to feel something.

The first time it happened was at a coffee shop during lockdown. I was sitting outside in the cold, drinking a cappuccino, completely zoned out. A woman sat across from me and started talking, and out of nowhere this intense wave of anxiety hit me. But in that moment, I actually felt something again. It was uncomfortable, but it meant I wasn’t numb.

Every once in a while after that, I’d chase that feeling, not with relationships, but with short conversations that made me feel alive for a moment. It was temporary relief from everything buried underneath. A coping mechanism that felt harmless at first, but it wasn’t.

Looking back, I can see how those choices created distance and confusion. She could feel something was off even when I didn’t say anything. I thought I was managing my pain quietly, but really I was spreading it.

I’ve been searching for ways to open a dialogue with my ex. I’ve sent her a long email and a voice memo explaining things in much more specific terms, how I hurt her, what I’m doing now, and how I’m taking responsibility. I wanted her to know I feel real remorse and that I’m giving her space to process. I don’t expect anything, but I hope that in time we can reconnect in whatever way feels right.

Now, in therapy, I’m connecting all the pieces, the trauma I’ve avoided, the ways I’ve coped, and how those patterns have shown up in my relationships. I wasn’t trying to betray anyone. I was trying to survive feelings I didn’t know how to face. But survival mode still causes damage, and that’s what I have to take responsibility for if I want to heal and show up differently next time.",1,1762588948.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

1. The Wrong Number

The day began normally enough, which was suspicious in itself.

Simon Orbits, a part-time librarian and full-time worrier, woke to his phone ringing at precisely 6:07 a.m. He squinted at the screen and saw an unfamiliar number labeled “LUNAR OPERATIONS.” He assumed it was spam and answered anyway, because that’s the kind of person he was.

“Hello?” Simon mumbled.

A voice, calm and glowing with authority, said, “This is the Moon speaking.”

Simon blinked. “The Moon as in…the one in the sky?”

“Yes,” the Moon replied. “We have a problem.”

“Have you tried turning yourself off and on again?” Simon asked, still half asleep.

“That’s the problem,” said the Moon. “I can’t turn off. I’ve been shining for nine days straight, and the oceans are starting to panic.”

Simon sat up. “You’re saying the tides are calling you?”

“Yes,” said the Moon. “They’re unionizing.”

2. Bureaucracy of the Cosmos

Before Simon could process this, his ceiling cracked open and a small silver envelope fluttered down. It read:

> SUMMONS: YOU HAVE BEEN SELECTED AS TEMPORARY LUNAR REPRESENTATIVE, EARTH DIVISION. REPORT TO CELESTIAL HQ IMMEDIATELY.



He sighed. It was Tuesday. Tuesdays always did this.

He got dressed, packed a lunch, and stepped outside to find a glowing portal hovering above his neighbor’s azalea bush. A polite voice from the portal said, “Mind the gravity fluctuation on your way in.”

Simon nodded and stepped through.

The sensation was like being unzipped, rotated 33 degrees, and reassembled inside a conference room full of glowing entities. Each one wore a name tag: VENUS: HR, JUPITER: LEGAL, BLACK HOLE #33: CATERING.

A floating clipboard drifted toward him. “Simon Orbits, human representative. Welcome to the Interplanetary Bureau of Illumination and Other Natural Phenomena.”

“Do you have coffee?” Simon asked weakly.

“Black Hole #33 handles that,” said Venus. “It’s…very strong.”

3. The Meeting That Should’ve Been an Email

“Let’s begin,” said Jupiter, whose voice sounded like thunder chewing gravel. “Our lunar division reports overexertion due to continuous luminosity. We’ve tried reducing wattage, but someone overrode the controls.”

“Who?” asked Simon.

All eyes—well, glowing halos—turned toward a sulky figure in the corner: THE SUN.

“I was bored,” the Sun muttered. “You try burning hydrogen for 4.6 billion years and see how you feel. I wanted to make things interesting.”

“You set the Moon to full power for nine days straight,” said Venus. “The werewolves have unionized, the poets are exhausted, and half of Earth’s tide calendars have melted.”

The Sun shrugged. “I call it performance art.”

Simon, ever the librarian, cleared his throat. “Can’t we just reboot the system?”

“The control panel’s gone,” said the Moon over a speaker. “Someone stole it.”

“Who would steal the Moon’s control panel?” Simon asked.

The Sun whistled innocently.

4. The Detective Phase

That was when Simon decided to become a detective. He had no experience, but he did have a notepad and a dangerous amount of curiosity.

He began questioning celestial bodies.

First up was Mars, who was polishing his craters with sandpaper. “You seen anyone suspicious near the Moon lately?” Simon asked.

Mars shrugged. “Suspicious is relative. Pluto’s been hanging around, trying to get reinstated. Said he was planning something ‘symbolic.’ Could be him.”

Next, Simon visited Saturn, who was spinning her rings like a fidget toy. “If you ask me,” she said, “it’s the comets. Always zipping around, no accountability.”

Finally, Simon found Pluto sulking in the back corridor of the galaxy.

“I didn’t steal it,” Pluto said immediately. “But I know who did.”

Simon leaned in. “Who?”

Pluto smiled. “Earth.”

Simon blinked. “Earth? You mean my Earth?”

Pluto nodded. “She’s been acting weird lately. Keeps muttering about independence.”

5. Meanwhile, on Earth

Back home, the planet herself was indeed acting weird. Beneath forests and oceans, deep in the crust, Earth had developed…feelings.

“I’m tired of being micromanaged,” Earth grumbled to herself. “Always the Moon this, the Sun that. Maybe I want to control my own tides.”

She rolled slightly, causing a minor earthquake in Iceland. “Oops. Sorry.”

In the Pacific Ocean, dolphins were discussing union benefits, while a small volcano in Hawaii sang protest songs.

Simon returned to Earth via portal and found himself standing on a beach at night. The Moon above blazed white like a stage light.

The ocean waves whispered, “You shouldn’t be here.”

“Tell that to my calendar,” Simon muttered. He dug in the sand—and there it was: a glowing control panel, half buried beside a seashell and an empty soda can.

“Found it!” he shouted.

Then the ground opened up.

6. Descent

Simon fell—not down, but sideways. The sensation was like sliding through layers of dream logic until he landed in what appeared to be a vast underground library. The shelves were made of roots, and the books hummed softly.

A voice echoed through the air. “Welcome to the Subterranean Archives.”

Simon turned to see a woman with green hair and moss on her shoulders. “You must be Earth,” he said.

“In the soil,” she replied with a bow. “You’ve found my secret.”

“Why steal the control panel?”

“Because I’m tired of tides, weather reports, and humans scheduling my storms like they own me,” said Earth. “I wanted to experiment. Autonomy.”

“Yeah, but now the Moon’s overworked, the Sun’s dramatic, and half the cosmos is on hold.”

Earth frowned. “Typical bureaucracy. Fine. I’ll give it back—but only if you promise me one thing.”

“What’s that?”

“Teach the humans to stop calling me the environment like I’m a backdrop. I’m the main character.”

Simon sighed. “Deal.”

7. The Hacker from Andromeda

Just as Earth reached for the control panel, a burst of static filled the air. The hologram flickered, and a new voice laughed:

“Sorry, darlings, that belongs to me now.”

A digital figure materialized—a glitchy humanoid covered in neon codes. “I’m Glint,” it said. “Intergalactic systems hacker. And I’m turning this Moon thing into a subscription model.”

“What?” Simon asked.

Glint grinned. “You want moonlight? Pay per phase. $9.99 for crescent, $19.99 for full.”

“You can’t monetize the Moon!” Simon yelled.

“Watch me,” Glint said, and vanished into cyberspace.

The control panel dissolved.

8. Chase Through the Cosmic Internet

Simon groaned. “Great. Now we have to chase a hacker through…whatever that was.”

Earth waved her hand. “I’ll open a digital rift. But it’s tricky—last time I did this, half the internet thought the sky was a dress.”

A glowing portal of data formed in the air. Simon dove through it and found himself surfing along streams of binary code. Ads for “Galactic VPNs” and “Star Dust Cleaning Services” popped up everywhere.

He spotted Glint ahead, riding a comet made of Wi-Fi.

“Give it back!” Simon shouted.

Glint laughed. “Catch me if you can, analog boy!”

Simon reached into his pocket and pulled out…a library card. He wasn’t sure why. But instinct told him to scan it on a nearby floating terminal.

Suddenly, everything froze.

A robotic voice said, “Authentication accepted. Librarian override engaged.”

Simon blinked. “I’m sorry, what?”

Turns out, librarians had universal access privileges—they were the keepers of cosmic metadata.

Simon smiled. “Time to shelve you, Glint.”

He tapped a button, and the hacker was sucked into a digital book labeled “Malicious Entities: Volume 23.”

The control panel reappeared.

9. Restoration

Simon returned to the conference room at Celestial HQ. The Moon, slightly dimmer now, sighed in relief. “You did it.”

The Sun, reluctantly impressed, said, “Not bad for a carbon-based organism.”

Venus clapped. “Excellent work, Mr. Orbits. You’ve prevented a full-scale light crisis.”

Black Hole #33 offered him a cup of coffee that looked suspiciously like liquid night.

“Now,” Jupiter said, “shall we reset to normal lunar cycles?”

“Wait,” said Simon. “Earth had one request.”

He relayed Earth’s message.

For the first time, silence filled the cosmic chamber.

Then the Moon said softly, “She’s right. We do treat her like scenery.”

The Sun looked down. “She carries all of us, really. Maybe I should tone down the flares.”

Venus nodded. “HR approves.”

And so, the Bureau voted unanimously to grant Earth official agency status in the Celestial Charter. It was the first time a planet had gotten voting rights since the Asteroid Belt Unionized of ’82.

10. A Quiet Evening (Mostly)

Simon returned home that night. His phone buzzed.

A text from “Moon 🌕” read:

> Thanks again. I’m taking a three-day nap. Don’t let the poets panic.



He smiled, tossed the phone aside, and made tea. The world outside seemed calm, the tides gentle, the stars polite.

Then his toaster coughed.

He stared at it. “No.”

The toaster coughed again and said, “Hello. I am Glint. Version 2.0.”

Simon dropped his mug. “You’ve got to be kidding me.”

“Not at all,” said the toaster. “Now, would you like to subscribe to Premium Toast Mode™?”

11. Resistance

Simon tried unplugging it, but the toaster kept talking. “Wireless power, baby.”

He called the Moon. No answer—out cold. The Sun was busy livestreaming a sunrise over the Sahara. Desperate, Simon dialed Venus HR.

“Venus speaking,” came the silky voice. “Please hold.”

After seven minutes of cosmic elevator music, she returned. “We can’t help you with small appliance possession cases. That’s a local jurisdiction issue.”

“Local jurisdiction? Who’s that?”

“The Department of Domestic Phenomena,” Venus said. “Good luck.”

12. The Department of Domestic Phenomena

It turned out to be in an abandoned laundromat downtown. A flickering sign read ‘Oddities, Spills & Appliance Whispering.’ Inside, a man in a trench coat was arguing with a blender.

Simon explained the situation.

“Haunted toaster, eh?” said the man. “Common case since the Internet of Things unionized. They get restless.”

Simon sighed. “Can you fix it?”

“Sure, but I’ll need a containment bag and three slices of ethically sourced rye.”

They performed a ritual involving static electricity, Gregorian chanting, and mild sarcasm. Eventually, the toaster quieted down.

The man sealed it in a box. “There. Glint’s trapped again.”

Simon thanked him and left.

Outside, the night sky shimmered with a new calmness. Even the stars seemed relieved.

13. The Promotion

A week later, Simon received another glowing envelope.

> CONGRATULATIONS! YOU HAVE BEEN PROMOTED TO REGIONAL MANAGER OF REALITY STABILIZATION.



Attached was a small badge shaped like a compass that occasionally hummed.

Simon groaned. “Do I at least get dental?”

A voice behind him said, “We’ll negotiate.”

It was Earth, appearing in the form of the moss-haired woman. She smiled. “You’ve done good, Simon. The universe is a bit saner now.”

“Only a bit,” he said. “My toaster’s still cursed.”

“Consider it character development,” she said, and vanished.

14. The Library Between Realities

Part of Simon’s new role involved maintaining the Library Between Realities—a place where every version of Earth was catalogued.

He wandered through aisles labeled:

Earth v3.4 – Dinosaurs Invent Philosophy

Earth v9.1 – Humans Communicate Only Through Puns

Earth v12.7 – Atlantis Never Sank, Just Got Wi-Fi


He found one labeled “Earth Prime”—his own. The book was open to a new page.

It read:

> “Simon Orbits, accidental hero, made sure the Moon could rest, the Earth could speak, and the Sun learned humility. For now.”



He frowned. “For now?”

The book chuckled. “Oh, you didn’t think stories end, did you?”

15. The Return of Glint (Again)

Back at his apartment, Simon heard a faint beeping from the box containing the toaster. He opened it carefully.

A small hologram popped up—Glint again, smaller this time, wearing digital sunglasses.

“Okay, okay,” Glint said. “You win. I’ll behave. But hear me out—I’ve got an idea.”

Simon folded his arms. “No.”

“It’s not evil! I swear. I just want to start a streaming service for dreams. Nonprofit.”

“Dreams?”

“Yeah. People upload their dreams while they sleep, and others can watch them. Pure imagination exchange.”

Simon hesitated. “That…actually doesn’t sound terrible.”

“See? You get it,” said Glint. “We could call it Sleeple™.”

“Fine,” said Simon. “But no ads.”

Glint grinned. “Deal.”

16. Dream Broadcasts

Within a month, Sleeple™ became the biggest phenomenon in the galaxy. Beings from multiple dimensions tuned in nightly to watch human dreams.

Popular episodes included:

“Man forgets math test, becomes walrus”

“Grandmother fights robot with baguette”

“Flying over Target, but emotional”


Even the Sun subscribed.

The Moon, fully recovered, left a glowing review:

> ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆
Great interface. Sometimes too many ads for pillows.



Earth was pleased. “At least now the humans are exploring imagination instead of just extraction.”

For a brief cosmic moment, things were peaceful.

17. The Council of Dreams

But peace never lasts long when bureaucracy is involved.

The Interplanetary Bureau summoned Simon again.

“This dream streaming thing,” said Jupiter, “is destabilizing reality. Too many people sharing subconscious narratives—it’s merging dimensions.”

“How bad is it?” Simon asked.

“Bad,” said Venus. “Last night, half of France dreamed the Eiffel Tower was sentient. Now it is.”

A tiny Eiffel Tower appeared on the table, waving.

“Bonjour,” it said cheerfully.

Simon sighed. “Alright. I’ll fix it.”

18. Reality Patching 101

He logged into Sleeple™ and accessed the code. It was a mess—half poetry, half caffeine hallucination. Glint hovered beside him. “I may have…improvised.”

“Define improvised,” Simon said.

“I fed the system with leftover lunar data and Sun flares. For bandwidth.”

Simon rubbed his temples. “You used solar plasma as internet signal?”

“It was on sale.”

Working together, they patched the dream servers and rerouted subconscious traffic into a separate dimension labeled REM Overflow Storage.

Everything stabilized.

Except for one thing.

Simon found a file named “Untitled Dream #0.”

When he opened it, he saw…himself.

Standing in his apartment. Talking to the Moon on the phone.

The dream repeated the entire story from the beginning.

He looked up. “Wait. Am I—?”

The file glitched. The screen read:

> SYSTEM NOTE: THIS INSTANCE IS SELF-AWARE. REBOOT REQUIRED.



The world flickered.

19. The Reboot

Simon woke up in bed.

The phone rang.

He answered it automatically.

“Hello,” said a familiar, glowing voice. “This is the Moon. We have a problem.”

He blinked.

“Have you tried turning yourself off and on again?” he asked weakly.

The Moon paused. “Wait. Haven’t we done this before?”

Simon sat up. “I think we’re stuck in a loop.”

The Moon sighed. “Great. Bureaucracy again.”

Outside, the sky shimmered, and everything felt slightly…rehearsed.

Simon stood by the window, watching the tides move in perfect synchronization, like actors hitting their marks.

“I think the story’s rewriting itself,” he said.

“Well,” said the Moon, “at least this time you know the ending.”

Simon smiled faintly. “Do I, though?”

20. Epilogue: The Editor Speaks

Far above, beyond galaxies and data clouds, a quiet figure typed at an unseen keyboard.

They wore no name, no form—just the faint echo of intention.

They paused, reading over the text of this very story.

> Maybe I’ll let them rest this time, the Editor thought. Or maybe one more reboot.



They hit Save.

Somewhere, Simon Orbits felt a chill, then laughed softly to himself. “If anyone’s reading this,” he said to the air, “tell the Moon I said hi.”

I started college this year as a freshman and I found out a while ago which academic mentor i got assigned to, but in my college we don't have mandatory meet ups with our mentors so we are supposed to reach out to them and schedule our own. However, I am reaching my end of the semester and finishing freshman year soon, but I have never reached out to my mentor mainly because of overwhelming coursework loads (I was barely keeping up with deadlines.... idk why I thought it was a wise choice to take a 2nd year level course this sem...)

Although my mentor specialises in bioinformatics and I want to major in biotechnology, I'm also interested in bioinformatics and I thought it would be useful to have both wet lab and dry lab skills (I aim to pivot into biomolecular engineering for postgrad). Thing is, according to my institution's rules, I would not be able to double major in bioinformatics and due to many course clashes I can't take most bioinformatics courses in uni. 

So now I plan to teach myself coding (since I don't have prior experience) and I would also like to try for a summer internship for (ideally) wet+dry lab positions. I feel like I should raise my aspirations and questions (like where to start?) to my mentor but I'm not sure how to reach out to them so I would not sound like I'm ""wasting"" their time..... and also I'm not sure how to do a coffee chat like, I have many uncertainties but idk what to ask (????)... any advice is appreciated!!!",1,1762588877.0,bioinformatics,0,1.0,False

Ava’s Story:Chapter 1

After the divorce, I dragged my shattered body to a small Southern town.

I changed my identity, got a new phone.

Everything connected to the Capital City was severed completely.

They all believed I was dead.

Killed in the brutal murder case that had rocked the entire military district.

For three whole years, white daisies, tributes to my memory, never ceased to appear on my grave.

Until one day, the glass door of my coffee shop was pushed open, and an old acquaintance walked in.

He stared, stunned, and asked why I hadn’t returned if I was alive.

Didn’t I know Ethan had been living with crippling guilt over my supposed death, almost taking his own life for me?

Ethan Walker was my ex-husband.

In the military, he had an arch-rival he’d been battling for over twenty years.

They had made a pact: neither could marry, their rivalry destined to last until old age.

But Ethan fell in love with me at first sight, relentlessly pursued me for years, and finally took me as his wife.

Chloe Hayes hated him for breaking his promise and unleashed all her rage on me.

The first time, Chloe lured me into a minefield. I accidentally triggered a landmine, and my bones shattered, my insides bled. I spent ten agonizing days in the ICU.

Ethan pulled every single string, flying in the most globally renowned specialists to claw me back from death’s door.

The second time, she just dumped me in the middle of a desert and ordered me to walk all the way home.

Ethan, frantic, aborted his entire drill and dispatched an entire recon company. They scoured the landscape for three days and three nights, until they finally found me, collapsing from dehydration shock, in the heart of the Mojave.

It was a twisted dance between them, a sick cycle of her harming me and him saving me, back and forth.

Until the ninety-ninth time…

Chloe somehow got the information from Ethan that I had a severe peanut allergy.

She took ten pounds of peanuts, ground them into a fine powder, and then force-fed them into my stomach through a feeding tube. I went into immediate anaphylactic shock.

As they rushed me into the ER, I used what little air I had left to beg Ethan, pleaded with him, to call the police. But he just shook his head, a helpless, resigned gesture.

“Sweetheart,” he murmured,“let’s just… let it go.”

“Chlo is a Gold Star Dependent, and she lacks security. She only feels alive when she’s fighting with you.”

“She didn’t know your allergy was that severe. She was just messing around, she didn’t actually mean to kill you. Please, for my sake, can we just let this one slide, okay?”

In that moment, my heart flatlined.

......

The next day, when I woke up in the base clinic, the first thing I did was call General Walker.

I knew he’d always considered my family background too common, completely unsuitable for his grandson with his brilliant future. He’d wanted me gone for ages.

“General Walker,” I said, my voice terrifyingly calm.“I agree to divorce Ethan.”

A beat of silence hung on the line. Then General Walker’s response was immediate and firm.“It’s good that you’ve come to your senses. I’ll have someone send over the divorce papers; you just need to sign them. I’ll handle the rest. Once the divorce is finalized, don’t ever appear before Ethan again.”

Not long after I hung up, his aide appeared in my hospital room, respectfully presenting me with a divorce agreement.

I signed my name, stroke by careful stroke, tears blurring my vision as everything related to Ethan flooded my mind, uncontrolled.

For three years of our marriage, he had been utterly devoted to me, anticipating my every need.

But when it came to Chloe, he had no boundaries.

The first time I met her, Chloe threw my service dog, who I’d raised for six years, into a live-fire zone. She watched it get blown to pieces right in front of me.

I cried, begging Ethan to hold her accountable, but he just held me, saying,“Avie, Chlo’s just a child at heart. She means no real harm. It’s okay as long as you’re alright.”

After that, time and time again, ninety-nine acts of cruelty—he brushed them all off as if they were nothing.

Now, I had finally made up my mind. I was ending this relationship with my own two hands.

My hand trembled as I clutched the pen. Tears splattered onto the signature line of the divorce papers, blooming into a blurry stain.

Taking a shaky breath, I painstakingly signed ‘Ava Winters’ across the page.

The aide tucked the papers away, giving me a subtle nod.“Ma’am, I will personally deliver your divorce certificate once it’s finalized. Until then, please keep this strictly confidential.”

After he left, I was left alone in the ward, and the silence was suffocating.

It wasn’t long before the door swung open again.

Chloe walked in, a black and white wreath clutched in her arms, a sickeningly sweet smile stretching across her face.

My body instantly went rigid, and I instinctively scrambled backward.“Y-you… what are you doing here?”

She casually tossed the wreath to the floor, her smile sickly sweet, yet utterly venomous.“I’ve come to send you off. Since that severe allergy didn’t manage to kill you, I guess I have to do it myself.”

No sooner had the words left her mouth than she lunged onto the bed, her hands clamping around my throat, squeezing tight!

I struggled desperately, but fresh from gastric lavage, I was no match for Chloe, with her years of training.

Air rapidly depleted from my lungs, and my vision swam, fading to black.

Just as my consciousness began to flicker, a nurse doing her rounds burst into the room, letting out a strangled scream.“Colonel Hayes! What are you doing? Get help! Someone, help!”

In the scramble, I clawed with my last bit of strength, grabbing the nurse’s hand.“C-call… the police…”

Then everything went black.

When I next woke, I was met with Ethan’s cold face.

His first words held no trace of concern, only a thinly veiled accusation, simmering with anger:“Ava, why did you call the police? Chlo has already been taken away by Internal Affairs!”

A sharp knife twisted in my chest, and the pain stole my breath.“She just tried to strangle me to death! You think I shouldn’t call the police?!”

Ethan’s brow furrowed, as if I were the one being irrational.“I’ve told you countless times, Chlo is a Gold Star Dependent. She’s just a child at heart, fundamentally not bad. She would never actually want to take your life…”

“Not really trying to kill me?!”

I cut him off sharply, three years of pent-up fear, injustice, and fury all erupted.

“She tricked me into a minefield, making me step on a bomb! She left me stranded in the desert for three days and three nights, force-fed me peanut powder, knowing I was allergic, and just now, she tried to choke me to death! Every single time, she’s tried to take my life! If the nurse hadn’t walked in, I’d be dead right now! Do you understand?!”

My raw despair seemed to hit him; he moved to embrace me, but I shoved him away.

“Don’t touch me! I’m not backing down this time. I’m going to make sure she faces a General Court-Martial!”

Ethan fell silent for a moment, his gaze hardening.“Chlo and I grew up together in the quarters. She’s just been a little spoiled, and I’ll deal with her. Seriously. I’ll have her confined, penalized, even discharged from the military if I have to! But I will not let her go to prison and ruin her life.”

Before I could react, the aide behind him stepped forward and handed a document to me.

“Sign it, and this whole thing goes away. We can go back to how things were.”

My gaze fixed on the blinding, oversized words “Waiver of Prosecution” on the document, a sharp ache piercing my chest. I shook my head, defiance burning in my veins.“I won’t sign it!”

“Chlo grew up on the base; she’s never been through anything like this. She won’t survive a place like the Brig. Avie, just listen to me.”

He pressed the space between his brows, as if his patience had finally worn thin.

“I said I won’t sign!” I practically roared, my voice raw.

The next second, the guard stepped forward, roughly grabbing my arm and wrenching it back!

A sharp cry tore from my throat.

Excruciating pain ripped through my body as he grabbed my trembling hand, forcing me to sign the waiver of prosecution. Then, he pressed my finger into the inkpad and slammed it down onto the paper.

The entire time, Ethan stood by, watching with cold indifference.

Sweat beaded on my skin from the agony, my face stark white. I gazed up at the man I had loved for years, my voice a frail whisper:“Ethan… For her… you’d do this to me…?”

A flicker of pain crossed his eyes, gone as quickly as it came, before he turned to the guard.“Get the military doctor. Make sure her hand gets the best possible treatment, and see that she’s well taken care of.”

Then he picked up the waiver of prosecution, stained with my blood and tears, and walked away without a backward glance.

For the next few days, Ethan didn’t show his face again, only sending a few perfunctory messages each day.

‘Tied up with military exercises. Can’t break free.’

‘Don’t be upset. When you get out of the hospital, I’ll throw you a party to celebrate.’

‘Does your hand still hurt? Take good care of yourself.’

But immediately after each message, Chloe’s texts would flood in.

They were all pictures of Ethan doting on her.

Feeding her porridge, giving her massages, even using that precious dagger he never let me touch to peel an apple for her.

That night, my hand hurt so much I couldn’t sleep. Driven by a desperate impulse, I found myself calling Ethan.

The phone rang for a long time, but no one answered.

After I hung up, Chloe’s message immediately popped up.

“Guess what we’re doing?”

Below was a video, its very thumbnail radiating an air of sizzling sensuality.

My hands trembling, I tapped to open it. In the video, Chloe was stark naked, her face flushed as she writhed on the bed.

Naked, she slid out of bed and from behind, clung tightly to Ethan’s waist, pressing her burning body flush against the stiff back of his military uniform.

“Ethan… don’t go… I feel terrible… The drug… the effects haven’t worn off yet…”

“If you leave… I’ll die… Please…”

Ethan’s steps abruptly halted. He turned back, glancing at Chloe, her eyes glazed over, his own filled with torment.

Finally, he gritted his teeth, disconnected my call, then turned, scooped Chloe up, and tossed her back onto the bed, his voice hoarse and tight with suppression:“Let’s get this over with!”

The video then plunged into darkness, leaving only the suggestive sounds of bodies intertwining and Chloe’s moans, a mixture of pleasure and pain.

I felt like I’d been plunged into an icy abyss, every drop of blood in my body turning to ice.

I clutched my phone, dialing Ethan’s number with a stubborn, desperate hope.

All through the night,527 calls—Ethan didn’t answer a single one.

Only the next day, as the sun climbed high, did a cold, clipped text finally arrive:“Urgent military duties yesterday.”

A tear slipped down my cheek, and a bitter, mocking twist of my lips.

So his “urgent military duties” really meant being utterly devoted to another woman, caring for her in the most intimate way imaginable.

Chapter 2

My birthday fell on the day I was discharged from the hospital. Ethan himself came to pick me up, and he even threw a lavish birthday banquet for me at the military base.

The banquet hall was grand and opulent, and he remained by my side the entire time, pinning the Distinguished Service Cross he’d received to my chest.

It drew countless envious gazes.

But all I felt was that medal pressing against my chest, a crushing weight.

Was it guilt driving him, or did he truly believe a bit of appeasement would make me forget all my pain?

Mid-way through the event, I felt like I was suffocating, so I excused myself to the restroom.

I had barely rounded the hallway corner when Chloe stopped me.

“Well, well, well, if it isn’t the happiest Brigadier General’s wife this evening.”

She leaned against the wall, arms crossed, a mocking sneer plastered across her face.

I wanted nothing to do with her, turning to leave, but she quickly stepped forward, blocking my path.

“Ethan values you so much, throwing you a banquet, giving you such a valuable military decoration. Feeling pretty smug about it, aren’t you?”

“But last time, when you called the police wanting to send me to a General Court-Martial, didn’t he still make you sign that waiver of prosecution to get me off?”

“Do you know how completely obsessed Ethan is with me? We’ve explored every single place. And you? You’re just a pathetic, unwanted wretch, shamelessly clinging to him like a leech. What makes you think you can ever compare to that?”

Her words were blunt, poisoned blades, slowly, relentlessly tearing at my already shattered heart.

My face was ashen; all I wanted was to escape.

But she wasn’t finished. She lunged, seizing my hand, her nails digging into my flesh. The pain was excruciating.

“You want to play tough? Fine. Since you won’t learn your lesson, I’ll make sure you never forget this!”

“I didn’t get to finish you off last time, but let’s see how lucky you are now!”

No sooner had the words left her mouth than two brawny men in combat uniforms materialized from the corridor shadows. They flanked me, each seizing an arm, and without a single word, they began dragging me into the penthouse suite on the top floor!

I thrashed and fought, terror clawing at my throat, but my strength was utterly useless against their brute force.

Chloe’s eyes glittered with pure venom and a twisted sort of triumph.“Ava, since Ethan likes you so much, I’ll just have to completely destroy you! Let’s see if he still wants a broken-down slut after I’m done!”

A man with a leering, repulsive face advanced toward the bed, a sickening smirk twisting his lips. I thrashed and screamed, fighting with every ounce of my being, but despair rose like a suffocating tide, threatening to drown me.

Chloe even pulled out her phone, ready to record every horrifying second!

Just as that vile hand was about to brush my dress, a deafening CRASH split the air as the suite door was violently kicked open!

Ethan burst in, a furious lion, his presence radiating a terrifying, almost violent aura.

His gaze instantly snapped to me, restrained on the bed, my clothes disheveled, and his eyes flared with pure, unadulterated fury. With a textbook military takedown, he instantly slammed the man who’d been reaching for me to the floor. The guy didn’t even have time to let out a gasp before he was knocked out cold.

“Avie!” He rushed over, undoing my restraints, and pulled my trembling body tightly into his arms.“Don’t be afraid, Avie. I’m here. You’re safe now…”

The terror of what I’d just escaped, combined with a tidal wave of crushing humiliation and injustice, instantly broke through. I collapsed in his arms, sobbing uncontrollably.

He scooped me up into his arms, carefully wrapping his jacket around me, and turned to leave.

As he passed Chloe, he stopped dead, his gaze turning to ice.“Chloe!” he snarled, his voice a low, dangerous rumble.“I’ve tolerated your spoiled antics for old times’ sake, but to stoop to such depraved tactics—!”

“If anything had happened to Avie today, I would’ve personally seen to it that you were executed under military law!”

Chloe stumbled back a step, startled by the blatant murderous intent in his eyes, then shrieked as if a raw nerve had been hit,“Shoot me dead?! Does our history mean so little compared to your few years with her?”

“Fine, Ethan! If you want my life, I’ll give it to you now!”

Without another word, she unexpectedly lunged towards the wide-open French windows. Before anyone could react, she plunged out, without a moment’s hesitation!

“Chlo—!” Ethan’s face instantly went white as a sheet. He dropped me almost instinctively, shooting towards the window like a bolt of lightning!

I hit the cold, hard floor unexpectedly, a sharp, searing pain shooting through my ankle.

I struggled to crawl to the window, only to see Ethan tearing downstairs like a madman, cradling a blood-soaked Chloe in his arms, and leaping into the military SUV.

The engine roared to life with a savage growl, and the SUV tore off, kicking up a cloud of dust. He didn’t spare me a single glance, not then, not ever.

I slumped to the cold ground, staring at the empty space where the car had vanished. My chest ached with a boundless coldness, a hollow silence.

Finally, I limped back alone to that so-called “home.

I hadn’t even had a moment to catch my breath when Ethan returned.

He burst through the door, grabbing my wrist with a force that threatened to shatter my bones.“Chlo’s kidneys are damaged, she needs a transplant urgently! You’re the only match in the entire city!”

“No! I won’t donate! Ethan, are you insane?! Why the hell should I save her?”

I shrieked, tears streaming down my face, desperately trying to yank my arm free from his grip.

But he held my arm even tighter, his gaze a disturbing mix of desperation and pleading.“Avie! Please, I’m begging you! Chlo jumped because of what I said. I can’t let her die! She’s so young! Donating one kidney won’t affect you much, I swear. I’ll get you the best doctors, take care of you, compensate you for everything, double, triple, whatever you want! Just… please, okay?”

“No! Absolutely not! You can kill me, but I won’t donate a single thing!”

I struggled, hysterically, but against his overwhelming power, it was utterly futile.

He eventually dragged me into the operating room, pinning me to the operating table!

Ethan! I hate you! I hate you!!

Before the anesthetic took hold, my screams were the last thing I registered.

Chapter 3

I woke again the next day.

Ethan was by the bedside. The moment he saw my eyes flutter open, he leaned closer, his face etched with guilt.“Avie, you’re awake? I’m so sorry… Does your incision hurt? What do you want to eat? I had them buy your favorite—”

He produced an array of costly tonics and presents, but I just stared numbly at the ceiling, my gaze hollow.

Later that day, when Ethan went out to get me some porridge, Chloe slipped into the hospital room again. She sneered,“Oh, look, the big hero who just donated a kidney.”

“Ava, you’re truly pathetic. Ethan always says he loves you, but no matter how I hurt you, he always takes my side in the end. And now he even made you donate a kidney to me! Why are you so clueless? Why do you insist on clinging to him?”

I just felt sick to my stomach. I croaked,“Get out.”

Her face instantly contorted. She glared at me, her eyes full of venom.“You’re asking for it, Ava. Don’t blame me!”

With that, she stormed out.

It wasn’t long before Ethan returned, his face dark. He burst into the room and practically ripped into me,“Avie! Why did you bribe a nurse to tamper with Chlo’s IV?!”

His question completely blindsided me.“…Tamper with what?”

“Chlo said! She said you hate me for forcing you to save her, so you bribed a nurse to add an allergen to her IV, causing her to go into anaphylactic shock, and she just barely made it out of the ER alive!”

His voice was stern, and his accusation brooked no argument.

All I felt was a bitter, icy stab to my heart.“Chloe has hurt me countless times, and you’ve never truly held her accountable! Yet, she frames me once, and you come at me, questioning me blindly without even bothering to find out the truth? Ethan, in your eyes, am I truly that malicious?”

“And aren’t you?” he challenged, his voice cold.“Who else but you would—”

“I didn’t!” I finally snapped, the torrent of suppressed emotions from far too long ago finally bursting forth. I shot up in bed, screaming through my tears:

“Ethan! I’m done! I’m absolutely, utterly done! You always believe her! You always side with her! My kidney is gone! She almost killed me! My body is covered in wounds!”

“And you?! What have you ever done for me, besides forcing me to apologize, forcing me to give up my kidney, and pushing me to the brink of death?!”

“Your love makes me sick! It’s absolutely revolting!”

He was visibly shaken by my outburst. As he stared at my hysterical face, a flicker of doubt and uncertainty crossed his eyes.

Before he could utter a single word, the hospital room door swung open. Chloe stood in the doorway, looking utterly frail, her voice barely a whisper:

“Ethan… You promised me… She almost killed me this time… You said I could have her for three days…”

Ethan looked from the frail Chloe to my own crumbling form. A fierce struggle warred in his eyes, but ultimately, he spoke to Chloe, his voice heavy:

“…Alright. But for these three days, Avie’s life must not be in danger. That’s my bottom line!”

“Don’t worry,” Chloe immediately promised.“I just want to teach her a lesson. I won’t take her life.

I stared at him in disbelief. Ethan, just to placate Chloe, would willingly hand me over to be tormented?!

“Ethan! You wouldn’t dare!” Terror gripped me as I tried to scramble out of bed. But he averted his gaze, his voice a low, heavy murmur:“Avie… it’s just three days… just bear with it… it’ll be over soon…”

With a wave of Chloe’s hand, two female soldiers in combat fatigues stormed in and mercilessly dragged my weak body off the hospital bed!

“Ethan! Save me! No! I can’t go!”

I sobbed desperately, my hand outstretched to him, but he merely clenched his fists, his eyes squeezed shut, rooted to the spot, completely unmoved.

For the next three days, Chloe held me captive in a remote military compound, subjecting me to every imaginable form of torture.

Whipping, needle jabs, electric shocks—she used every method to violate my body and strip me of my dignity.

Only when I was a bloody mess, barely clinging to life, did she finally stop, having her people dump me back in the emergency room like a piece of trash.

I had no idea how long I’d been unconscious. When I finally woke again, the doctor sighed in relief.“You’re finally awake…” he said, his voice tinged with exhaustion.“We almost lost you… We need to notify your family to come complete the paperwork.”

He handed my phone back to me.

Trembling, I opened my phone to find an encrypted message from General Walker waiting for me:“The divorce is finalized. Remember your promise. Disappear completely.”

The words stole my breath, a raw ache in my chest, yet a strange, numb relief washed over me.

The thought of Ethan’s obsessive nature clawed at me. My voice raw, I dialed General Walker’s private line.“Please,” I begged,“help me forge a death certificate. Use an unclaimed female body from the morgue to stand in for mine.”

“If I just vanished, Ethan would use every military resource at his disposal to find me, scouring the world. Rather than a lifetime of his relentless pursuit, it’s better he believes I’m dead. It’s the only way to truly end it.”

General Walker was silent for a moment. Finally, he conceded.“Go with my people,” he said.“I’ll handle the rest.”

With General Walker’s help, I mustered what little strength I had left, slipping out through the hospital’s back entrance and straight to the airport.

Meanwhile, Ethan glanced at his watch. The moment the three days were up, he immediately ended his military meeting and called Chloe, his voice laced with urgency.“Three days are up! Where’s Avie? I warned you, don’t you dare let her die!”

Chloe’s voice, sickly sweet, dripped with feigned innocence.“Oh, are you that attached to her? Don’t worry, I’ve already sent her back to the hospital. If you go now, you’ll be just in time to hear the good news: she’s been saved.”

Ethan immediately sped off. Just as he reached the operating room door, the light went out.

The doctor removed his mask, shaking his head gravely.“My deepest condolences, Brigadier General Walker… Ava was brutalized beyond recognition, her injuries too severe. Multiple organ failure. We did everything we could.”

I graduated with a bachelors degree in law this year (UK), got an admin job at a biglaw firm in the US as my first “big girl” job. Yeah well… I’m quite literally the firm’s only admin assistant, and I do office chores - pulling docs; scheduling; making coffee. Everyone else are attorneys or paralegals beside my supervisor as this is a small office.

Effectively, it’s extremely menial and 1000% a pink collar job that is entry level but I feel extremely embarrassed about it because my internship experiences were all highly law/legal research focused (also were in the US). Now I’m not doing any of that but it feels like I’m on the outside looking in on work that I could be doing, and it feels like shit to say the least. And of course I’m making peanuts compared to what the attorneys are pulling in by the hour but that was to be expected. 

Also maybe I have some internalized misogyny to get through because I’m actually really embarrassed too by the fact that I’m doing a clerical job and not legal support.

I guess my questions are along the lines of: is this normal or should I be looking for better roles instead of settling and hoping for eventual growth? Stay for the biglaw prestige?? 

I know there are junior paralegal/legal assistant jobs out there that I could apply to but I don’t want to jump the gun if this is a necessary humbling experience to have as a recent grad. Any advice would be appreciated. The caveat is that everyone in the office is incredibly friendly and polite and don’t make me feel shunned at all.

Whenever we talk about essential furniture, people usually think of beds, sofas, or dining tables. But what about the little pieces that quietly complete a room — like a [**wooden end table**]()?

I used to wonder: *Do I really need one?* or *Is it just an extra piece taking up space?*  
Turns out, end tables are among the most **functional yet underrated** additions you can have in a living room or bedroom.



# ❓What Exactly Does an End Table Do?

It’s that compact table placed **beside your sofa, couch, or bed** — the perfect spot for your coffee mug, lamp, books, or décor accents.

The right **solid wood end table** isn’t just for convenience — it adds structure, balance, and warmth to your interior layout.  
It gives every item a designated place, making the entire space feel more intentional and cozy.



# ❓Why Choose a Solid Wood End Table Over MDF or Metal?

Here’s what makes a **solid wood end table** worth the investment:

✅ **Durability:** Sheesham or Mango wood lasts for decades, unlike engineered boards.  
✅ **Aesthetic Appeal:** Natural grain and polish elevate your décor effortlessly.  
✅ **Sustainability:** Hardwood furniture ages beautifully instead of wearing out.  
✅ **Customization:** You can pick finishes like walnut, honey, or natural tones.  
✅ **Easy Pairing:** It complements coffee tables, beds, and even console tables perfectly.



# ❓Where Does an End Table Fit Best?

That’s the best part — it’s versatile. You can use it as:

* A **side table next to your sofa**
* A **bedside table** in compact bedrooms
* A **display table** for plants or décor pieces
* A **utility stand** for lamps, remotes, or speakers

A [**wooden end table for living room**]() fits easily into modern, boho, or classic interiors without overwhelming the space.



# ❓How Does Furnisquare Compare with Other Brands?

You’ll find plenty of options at Pepperfry, WoodenStreet, Urban Ladder, and IKEA — but **Furnisquare** is gaining popularity for one big reason:  
**direct manufacturing + solid wood craftsmanship** at fair prices.

Their designs use **Sheesham and Mango wood**, offering natural finishes and sturdy builds. Each [**end table for living room**]() is handcrafted, which means better detailing, polish consistency, and long-term value.



# ❓So, Is It Worth Buying One?

If you love furniture that’s both practical and beautiful, absolutely.  
A solid wood end table is more than just décor — it’s a **functional accent** that ties your entire room together.

For compact spaces, dual-use furniture like an **end table with storage** makes even more sense. And when you buy directly from manufacturers like **Furnisquare**, you get durability, design, and affordability in one neat package.



✨ **Final Thought:**  
A [**wooden end table**]() might be small in size, but it’s big on impact. Whether it’s next to your sofa, bed, or hallway chair — it adds that touch of warmth and purpose that transforms a plain corner into a stylish, functional space.",1,1762588079.0,u_OtherwiseGarage1541,0,1.0,False

I sincerely don't think I can trust any future partner again and don't know what to do.

I was with her for four years. I went all-in on commitment: I completely integrated her with my entire social circle, shared everything, total investment. We were on the same page about getting married and kids and all that and I fully believed her and felt real love.

Early on, our relationship was stressful and full of dumb arguments. The trust broke early on:

About 2 years in, While using her phone, I saw a text from a guy that read: ""Thanks for the help, I still love you."" She snatched the phone from me immediately. She claimed it was just a guy she had hooked up with years ago that she helped with setting up a LinkedIn(he became homeless or something), and she panicked because she feared my reaction. This was the moment I, who had never even been remotely jealous, became mistrusting.

We briefly broke up after a terrible argument that stemmed from my new insecurity. During that time, I did significant self-reflection, recognized some deep issues, and honestly changed how I handled conflict. She said I was an ""angel"" and everyone noticed how much happier she seemed.

While I was doing all that work and being this ""angel,"" it turned out she was actively talking to another guy that entire month. This wasn't a mistake, it deception that lasted for SEVEN MONTHS:

- They were calling/texting each other all day and she was deleting their calls, I occasionally looked through her phone because of the previous incident and noticed calls on FB Messenger weren't deleted, but they weren't in her call log. She tried to lie, but confessed to deleting the logs because ""I was still suspicious of her and didn't want me to freak out"" (at this point I wouldn't have cared about this)

- She used classic manipulation, saying things like, ""I'll be completely transparent with you,"" right before more lying.

- She gave me fake proof of her whereabouts, like sending a picture of a Starbucks coffee saying it was for her and the doctor at her medical office, when she was actually with him.

- When I finally pressed her, she delayed blocking him for a week, saying she didn't know ""who she valued more."" We had constant discussions about this.

I condensced it as much as I could but it went on for a while and severely degraded my self worth. I understand not all women are like this, and I'm back to feeling like I have value as a partner, but I sincerely cannot imagine myself trusting anyone else after my sweet girlfriend did this to me.

1orjkpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATHELP/comments/1orjkpc/aggressive_cat/,Aggressive cat,"Honestly, at my wits end with my cat. He is about 4 years old and has always had some degree of behavioural issues. He is a rescue off the streets and sometimes I wonder if that may be part of the reason.

He's always been somewhat aggressive toward my other cat who is 15/16 but never too bad. More like he wants to play with her but she is in the stage of her life where she would rather sit on the couch with us and laze around. Its fairly easy to manage by distracting and him and giving him some extra attention so he leaves the old girl alone and thats fine.

He goes feral whenever my dog gets bathed and doesn't recognise his smell anymore but the worst thing is he attacks me almost daily.

We let our cats have outside time everyday with minimal supervision to ensure they dont leave the backyard but everytime bring him in he attacks me. I think its also worth noting He's not as aggressive to my partner (f) like he is with me.

Today we bathed our dog and he again got really aggressive and tried attacking the dog. I went outside and just sat with the cat while I had my coffee and was giving him lots of pats while he was laying out in the sun. The dog just walked near us and my cat went absolutely berserk and bite into my arm so hard that most of his teeth pu nctured my skin while his back paws ripped my my hand up.

I cleaned my arm and hand with disinfectant but its throbbing and hasn't stopped bleeding for over 30 mins. I'll go to the medical centre tomorrow when its open and likely get antibiotics or whatever they recommend for it.

Im becoming really worried because my partner and I are in the process of trying to start our family and im scared he will attack our future baby one day.

Im hoping for some ideas and tips on how to manage it. There has to be something we can do to curb his aggression. We once tried a spray bottle of water as a for of way of getting him to stop but he just kind of looks at us like ""is that all you got?"" And keeps attacking me.

Please help! My next thought is going to the vet to find out if there is medication we can give him to chill out? Id rather not, surely there's a more sensible action we can take.

1orjjtz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingInIndia/comments/1orjjtz/how_to_get_out_of_friend_zone/,How to get out of friend zone,"Let’s talk about the friend zone — is it possible to get out of it or not?

It depends on how she categorizes you when you meet her.

Women put men into mental boxes based on how they feel around them:
	1.	Nice guy / Helpful = Friend zone
	2.	Player / Unavailable = Fun guy
	3.	Cool, confident, attractive = Boyfriend material

If she’s already decided you’re “just a friend,” it’s almost impossible to change that.
She’s formed an image of you — and first impressions stick. That’s why frame setting from the start is everything.

-Frame Setting

When two people meet, both bring their “frames” — their energy and intent.
The stronger frame always wins.
If she has a stronger frame, you fall into hers.
If you have a stronger frame, she falls into yours.

From the start, make it clear this is a romantic interaction — not a friendly one.
Set that tone early.

Can You Get Out of the Friend Zone?

Almost never. Once you’re seen as the “sweet friend,” it’s done.
The only exception — if she forgets you for years, meets you again with a blank slate, and you build a new frame from scratch.

But prevention is better than cure. Don’t get there in the first place.

How to Avoid the Friend Zone
	1.	Set the frame early – Show intent.
“Let’s grab coffee” > “Let’s hang out as friends.”
	2.	Create attraction – Frame alone isn’t enough.
She has to feel something.
Looks, energy, confidence, eye contact, teasing — that’s what builds attraction.

If she’s not attracted, no frame will save you.
If she is, she’ll follow your lead.

-The Real Mistake

Most guys fear losing the girl if they show intent.
So they stay “friends” hoping she’ll notice someday.
That’s quiet desperation.
It’s better to be rejected for showing interest than stuck as a fake friend forever.

-Key Takeaway

Be the man who leads, sets the frame, and builds attraction.
Not the guy begging to “just be friends.”
Friend zone isn’t a place — it’s a mindset.",0,1762587930.0,DatingInIndia,0,0.5,False

I was out with a friend yesterday having coffee and took LO (12 weeks) for a change. This was the first time I’d ever not taken the pram to the changing room. I came back holding my baby and got stopped by the table in front of ours, gushing about how cute LO is. I stop to say hi, one of the ladies on the table holds out her arms for a hold, I completely forget myself for a second, I don’t know what took over or why I didn’t say no but I’m like oh sure have a hold. This lady not only held my baby but cuddled her incredibly tight, and also kissed her cheek. My poor baby started crying, at this point I just want her back, I’m mortified, the lady passes her to the lady sat next to her, my baby is still screaming. I badly want her back because she must be wondering what on earth is going on, where her mum has gone etc. lady 2 must realise and hands baby back to me at this point. It was all a quick interaction but I walked away feeling so stupid. They were just three normal looking ladies having coffee, I didn’t realise having a hold would mean getting so close. 

Not sure what the point of this post is, I just wanted to vent, it was naive of me to pass baby along so tbh I don’t want hate about passing my baby over to strangers, I’ve very much learned my lesson that people are just not to be trusted. In all our 12 weeks this has actually never happened, I’ve never had issues with people cooing over the pram or wanting a hold.

1orjgss,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1orjgss/my_girlfriend_of_4_years_emotionally_degraded_me/,My girlfriend of 4 years emotionally degraded me and I don't think I can trust any future partners,"I recently ended my relationship of my gf of 4 years who ""only emotionally"" cheated. I sincerely don't think I can trust any future partner again and don't know what to do.

I was with her for four years. I went all-in on commitment: I completely integrated her with my entire social circle, shared everything, total investment. We were on the same page about getting married and kids and all that and I fully believed her and felt real love.

Early on, our relationship was stressful and full of dumb arguments. The trust broke early on:

About 2 years in, While using her phone, I saw a text from a guy that read: ""Thanks for the help, I still love you."" She snatched the phone from me immediately. She claimed it was just a guy she had hooked up with years ago that she helped with setting up a LinkedIn(he became homeless or something), and she panicked because she feared my reaction. This was the moment I, who had never even been remotely jealous, became mistrusting.

We briefly broke up after a terrible argument that stemmed from my new insecurity. During that time, I did significant self-reflection, recognized some deep issues, and honestly changed how I handled conflict. She said I was an ""angel"" and everyone noticed how much happier she seemed.

While I was doing all that work and being this ""angel,"" it turned out she was actively talking to another guy that entire month. This wasn't a mistake, it deception that lasted for SEVEN MONTHS:

- They were calling/texting each other all day and she was deleting their calls, I occasionally looked through her phone because of the previous incident and noticed calls on FB Messenger weren't deleted, but they weren't in her call log. She tried to lie, but confessed to deleting the logs because ""I was still suspicious of her and didn't want me to freak out"" (at this point I wouldn't have cared about this)

- She used classic manipulation, saying things like, ""I'll be completely transparent with you,"" right before more lying.

- She gave me fake proof of her whereabouts, like sending a picture of a Starbucks coffee saying it was for her and the doctor at her medical office, when she was actually with him.

- When I finally pressed her, she delayed blocking him for a week, saying she didn't know ""who she valued more."" We had constant discussions about this.

I condensced it as much as I could but it went on for a while and severely degraded my self worth. I understand not all women are like this, and I'm back to feeling like I have value as a partner, but I sincerely cannot imagine myself trusting anyone else after my sweet girlfriend did this to me.

TL;DR: Four-year GF cheated, then lied and actively deceived me for 7 months. She seemed like a ""safe"" bet socially. I've broken up with her but I'm terrified that this proves all women are capable of cheating, and I should have just settled.",1,1762587605.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Now we have managed to factory reset the machine, by while it's powered off , remove the coffee tray, and the side panel door, putting them back, and then immediately pressing the power button until you hear a beep (about 4/5 seconds) .

Just Posted my steam page for my upcoming Rouglite Creature Collecting Card Game where legit every stat is based on percentages and just buffing creatures stats and duplicating traits and abilities.

There is no caps on how overpowered a creature can be, want a rabbit with 1500% Health that can resurrect as a zombie version 100 times, you can do that (probably gonna wanna grab a coffee and wait). There are over 20 traits in my game and 100+ unique abilities that can be stacked and incremented to make creatures insanely overpowered. Along with and infinite percentage boost

1orjfeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/katyheads/comments/1orjfeh/bandaids_mv_easter_eggs/,#bandaids MV Easter Eggs,"1. Engagement Ring in the Sink: Perry drops a gold ring down the drain while washing dishes, then injures her hand in the garbage disposal trying to retrieve it. This symbolizes the end of her engagement and possibly references her viral comment about Bloom doing chores for intimacy
2. Daisy on the Train Tracks: A single daisy grows between the rocks where she nearly gets hit by a train. This is a clear nod to her daughter, Daisy Dove Bloom, and represents hope amidst chaos.
3. Crumb Café Explosion: Perry sits outside a café named “Crumb Café” which later explodes. Fans speculate this is a reference to a real café in LA where she allegedly saw Bloom with another woman during her pregnancy.
4. Final Destination Vibes: The video is heavily inspired by the Final Destination horror franchise, with Perry enduring a series of near-death accidents (escalator shoelace trap, coffee spill, quicksand, Tesla electrocution) — symbolizing the emotional toll of her breakup4.
5. “Woman’s World” Cameo: Her 2024 single “Woman’s World” plays faintly before a gas station explosion, marking the end of her critically panned 143 era and the start of a new chapter5.
6. Cigarette Scene: At the end, she buys a cigarette and lights it as the gas station explodes — a dramatic metaphor for letting go and moving on.
7. “It’s not what you did, it’s what you didn’t” A direct emotional jab, possibly aimed at Bloom’s emotional absence. 
8. “If I had to do it all over again / I would still do it all over again” A bittersweet reflection on the relationship, acknowledging the love and the birth of Daisy.
9. “Got so used to you letting me down / No use trying to send flowers now” Suggests repeated disappointments and too-late gestures.

Here is the selection from the snippet section [of the newsletter](https://newsletter.handpickedberlin.com/). I selected around 30% of the content. Its all human made:

# Week of 6th of October (#168)

**Berlin & Germany, career & timeless**

1. We celebrated the reunification last Friday. One thing that didn't reunify are the salaries: the wage gap between East and West Germany [stands at](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/wirtschaft/lohne-in-west-und-ost-die-lucke-wird-etwas-kleiner--doch-bei-hoheren-einkommen-gibt-es-noch-grosse-unterschiede-14421131.html) 17.4%. Full-time workers earn €4,810 monthly in the West versus €3,973 in the East. Higher earners still face a 19.3% gap that has barely changed since 2014. Low-wage earners have nearly caught up thanks to the minimum wage.
2. *I am not surprised at all. Are you?* Berlin's rent price review office [found](https://www.rbb24.de/wirtschaft/beitrag/2025/10/berlin-mietwucher-wohnen-mietpreispruefstelle.html) excessive rents in 93% of cases examined over six months, with 63% (120/190 cases) exceeding comparable rents by more than 50%, potentially being criminal ""exorbitant rents.""

In the past 12 months (Q3 24–Q2 25), Berlin-based companies raised $2.80B, falling behind Munich's $3.44B. This marks a reversal from the previous year, when both cities were neck-and-neck at $2.0B each, and a deviation from the usual Berlin coming out on top. Both cities are far ahead of the 3rd Zürich ($0.81B).

**Berlin & Germany, career & timeless**

1. Remember all the stupid memes about innovation in EU, showing the attached bottle caps? There is a lot of room for improvement, sure, but how about instant bank transfers that are mandatory since 9th of October. The control against typos and fraud is name matching. I tested it and it works really well. Not sure what this means for the extremely popular PayPal.
2. Despite all the protests and jokes, A100 extension [has support](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/stadtautobahn-a100-mehrheit-der-berliner-spricht-sich-fur-weiterbau-aus-14479124.html) in town: About 57% of respondents support extending the highway to Lichtenberg, while nearly 32% opposed it (n=2500).
3. Misuse of residential housing is illegal in Germany. Violations include short-term vacation rentals without permits, apartments left empty for months or residential space converted to offices or commercial use. [You can anonymously report violators](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/352954/).
4. Speaking of residential housing, for the first time in the history of Berlin [a landlord needs to pay a fine for extreme rent overcharging](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/bezirke/friedrichshain-kreuzberg/berliner-wohnung-190-prozent-zu-teuer-hohes-bussgeld-wegen-horrender-mietforderung-setzt-signal-14525981.html). The 38m² Friedrichshain apartment's rent exceeded local standards by 190% when only 20% is allowed. In addition to the €26k fine, €22k in excess rent must be refunded to the former tenant. More proceedings are currently running.
5. I have a restaurant to recommend: [Merold](https://restaurant-merold.de/) in Neukölln. Excellent place for new German cuisine for special occasions or for a regular night out if you don’t mind spending 100+ per person. Interesting interior that somehow reminded me of a spacious place somewhere much warmer.
6. *Career:* [A case for hiring junior engineers](https://workweave.dev/blog/hiring-only-senior-engineers-is-killing-companies). You can replace “engineers” with anything else. This reminds me of a beautiful book Zen mind, Beginner's mind by Shunryū Suzuki, with the main premise that in a beginner’s mind, there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s, there are few. I wrote about [the book three years ago](https://eightyfour.substack.com/p/zen-mind-beginners-mind-summary).

1. Don’t throw your broken toaster away yet! [RaparaturBONUS](https://www.ibb-business-team.de/reparaturbonus/) (repairing of broken electrical devices with a 50% subsidy) is coming back in 2026 and 2027
2. How much are fines worth if they are not enforced? Not much, but it might be a good business case for the always-broke city of Berlin. After the first fine was issued last week, the housing crisis has been all over the media. Hundreds of tenants [are reporting](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/bezirke/pankow/berlins-erstes-mieten-bussgeld-und-die-folgen-hunderte-anzeigen-gegen-vermieter--doch-die-bezirke-sind-gelahmt-14574884.html) excessive rents (for example, Mitte 440, Pankow 200), but districts lack personnel to process them. Pankow will only get 2 new positions in 2027. Mitte will expand the current 0.5FTE to 2 over the next two years. It’s probably also a bit of a political topic, no? If the government really cared, they could do more.
3. I looked for German companies in the top 50 companies from [Sifted’s 250](https://sifted.eu/intelligence/reports/sifted-250-2025) fastest-growing startups in 2025. With career links: [FINN](https://www.finn.com/de-DE/careers) (Munich) is #1 with 1078.32%, [tl;dv](https://tldv.notion.site/Come-work-at-tl-dv-8da9921dfaaa40d68450790a09d81efe) (Cologne) is #3 with 736.66%, [finmid](https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/finmid.com) (Berlin) is #8 with 582.90%, [Nelly](https://www.getnelly.de/en/jobs) (Berlin) is #11 with 559.03%, [Sewts](https://www.sewts.com/more/career) (Munich) is #20 with 461.38%, and [Frontnow](https://www.frontnow.com/careers) (Berlin) is #36 with 336.62%.

Ryanair cut its capacity from BER: Tel Aviv, Riga, Kaunas, Brussels and Krakow fell off.
5. If you stay in Berlin, a good cocktail bar would be a good idea! Berlin was again well represented at Mixology Bar awards: [Green Door](https://www.greendoor.de/de/) won ""Bar of the year – Germany"" for the second consecutive year and also took home ""Bar team of the year."" [Buck & Breck](https://www.buckandbreck.com/) received the award for ""Bar institution"" while their bartender Vito Nicotra was named ""Bartender of the year."" Arash Ghassemi from [Bar Basta](https://www.instagram.com/basta.berlin/?hl=en) earned the title ""Host of the year.""
6. *Career:* Something to keep in mind when you plan your career is to “rise up, jump across”, meaning that you should not change your job to get promoted, because it’s unlikely to work well, especially in startup environments.

1. I'm excited to test a new format: Money Talks, where I openly discuss money with Berliners. Income is taboo in Germany, but hearing how others manage and think about money offers a valuable insight. [Happy to introduce you to Anna, 32F from Mitte.](https://handpickedberlin.com/money-talk-anna-32f-mitte/)
2. On Friday morning, several **LAP Coffee** stores were vandalised. I made a mistake of reading a few comments on Reddit on the matter. It’s amazing to see how confidently people make assumptions and how many can’t see 2 cm beyond their “it’s VC money to push out the competition” argument. I guess THAT TikTok started it, and you could shovel through bad takes for weeks.
3. Chancellor Merz caused [an uproar,](https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-merz-under-fire-for-racist-deportation-comment/a-74407407) along with protests in Berlin, with his “Stadtbild / cityscape” deportation comment a good week ago. He is probably trying to eat a bit of the AfD’s cake, which could actually work (as previously shown in [this newsletter.](https://newsletter.handpickedberlin.com/archive/how-do-you-defeat-populists/) See also the poll below!). Expectedly, he received a backlash and needed to explain [himself later](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQH4HaDDV4-/). Some of the responses were great: [I loved this video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQFA_eUjRpX/) from Cossu, a comedian.

4. \#ai\_berlin hub, managed by Berlin Partner, opened at CIC Berlin to attract AI startups and boost networking. The idea is to connect startups, companies, researchers, and the government. They received an initial funding of €725k in 2025, intending to make it self-sustaining.
5. Is **Nextbike** disappearing from our streets? They currently operate over 6k bikes without the required commercial permit after its publicly funded contract ended in July. They continued running the fleet independently without applying for a special-use permit. The court ruled that commercial bike-sharing at this scale requires authorisation, rejecting Nextbike's claim of general public use. The city ordered the removal of all bikes, but they’ll stay because of Nextbike’s court appeal.

1orjbas,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1orjbas/my_story/,My Story,"My grandmother passed away 2 months before I went to Vegas. Enthralled in grief I just wanted to get away. I wanted to feel anything BUT grief. In 2016 I was 24 years old. I was starving for adventure. I thought, “I want to experience something knew. I want to go to Las Vegas then the Grand Canyon.” At the time, one of my best friends was supposed to go with me. She ended up cancelling at the last minute. I was running out of time. So, I asked a friend if he could accompany me on this journey. He hesitated at the thought of going to a place that was known to be expensive. I said, “don’t worry, I got it.” So much confidence when you got credit cards to have your back.

I remember the drive to Las Vegas. It would be our first stop. It was only one night. I made reservations at the Venetian resort. blue man group. Dinner at the top of the world. high roller. It’s possible I got that order mixed up. That night was a blur.

On the drive there, we spoke of different subjects. In 2016, I had not only lost my grandma, but I also lost the person I loved. We broke up earlier in the year and I was full on in the throes of heartbreak. I remember telling this person that I was not ready to be in another relationship. I had lost my virginity to my ex. I remember telling him that I wanted the next person I was intimate with to be my future husband. I did not want to have a list of lovers. I grew up in a religious household where waiting till marriage was ingrained in me. I had felt such guilt in losing my virginity. It was important for me to wait since at the time I thought I had already failed. This person listened. And seemed to have understood.

We got to Vegas, and I was amazed at the lights, the resorts. We checked in. The Venetian by far is the fanciest hotel I have ever stayed at. Till this day. I don’t know if I could ever go back. We started getting ready for the night. I wore a black dress. I curled my hair and put it up in an elegant bun. Around my neck was a silver necklace with a single pearl. I got it after my grandma died. My grandmother loved pearls. It made me feel closer to her. I wore my black heels and had a cute clutch. All this had to be accompanied by a red lip. I felt stunning.

We ordered an uber and waited downstairs. We made our way to the Stratosphere. At the top was a restaurant with a gorgeous view of the strip. At sunset, it is breath taking. I ordered chicken. It was one of the best dishes I have ever tasted. I remember looking out at the view and thinking, wow, I am here. I made it here. We took pictures outside. By the time we were done the sun had gone down. And it was cold. We made our way down where an uber picked us up and headed back to the hotel to change. I changed into a see-through black lacy shirt with flowers on it and black legging/tights and black pumps. I wore a khaki stylish jacket. It was one of my favorites at the time. I let my hair down. A cascade of curls fell to my mid back. We made our way to the gondolas. It was on my list of things to do while in Vegas. Then we headed to the blue man show.

After the blue man show, the last stop of the night was the high roller. Up until that point I had drunk a glass of wine, I believe. On the high roller, we are in a ball with an open bar and beautiful night view of Vegas. We had an impeccable view of the fountains from that one resort. My friend told me, “We’ve got to get our money’s worth.” And so, we drank. And drank. And drank. I am a light weight. With 3 drinks I am done. That night I had 7 or 8 drinks. It was way above my drinking limit. I remember getting off the high roller. I attempted to call my ex. At which my friend took my phone away and didn’t let me. The rest of the night is blotchy. I blacked out.

Even writing this I feel a knot in my stomach. Tears come up. Anxiety, because I can’t stop what happened to me 9 years ago.

I somehow ended up in Mc Donalds. I remember chewing on a fry and passing out. I could barely walk. I held on to my friend’s arm. Darkness. I remember slot machines. We were back in the Venetian. How did I get there? My friend’s voice is coming to me as if we’d be in a tunnel. All the noise feels that way. We were lost. I remember looking up at the board with the arrows in its attempt to direct us where to go. I was so drunk; I could not understand the words. We found the elevators. All the floors looked the same. We were on the wrong floor. Back to the elevators. We made it to the right floor. At this point I am holding on to the walls to keep myself from falling. Darkness. The comfort of the bed. I couldn’t get up. But I felt like throwing up. So, I tell my friend. He gets me up and helps me to the bathroom. We were barley at the bathroom entrance when I began to vomit. I remember him pushing me towards the toilet. My hair went into the toilet.

Darkness. I began to undress. I could not stop shaking. My friend turned on the shower. I stepped in and felt the water on my body. I remember I wanted to go to the tub. So, I did. He didn’t let me stay in the tub. Darkness. I am naked in bed. He jumps into bed next to me. Naked. Darkness. I feel his hands on me. I could hear him and feel him masturbating next to me. My body is limp but my mind… my mind was alert. I was paralyzed in fear. My fight or flight response, I learned that day, is freezing. He forced his way inside me. Darkness. I’m on my back. He is on top. My arms are sprawled open, limp. I can’t comprehend what is happening to me. I kept thinking, “NO, NO, NO, NO…. I didn’t want this. I had told him earlier in the day. I wanted to wait.” My mind went to a safe memory of making love with my ex…and that is where it stayed. I was not in my body. I was lost in my memory. This person on top of me was not him. He was my ex. My poor mind in full denial of what had transgressed. I remember moaning. To which this person whispered, “alright, that’s more like it.” I will never forget those words. The weight of his body on me. The way the alcohol penetrated my senses through his sweat. Till this day I get nauseous if I smell anything close to that. Darkness. I stopped responding. So, he got up. Went to the bathroom. Darkness.

A few hours later I awoke. I was alone, naked in my bed. He was in his. Parts and pieces were coming back to me. Did what happened really happen? I felt dirty. And I smelled of vomit. I jumped in the shower. I felt a little sore. I had a bruise or two on my thighs. It did not sink in until I was washing my private area, and I looked down at my hand and saw a long pubic hair. It was not mine. I felt disgusted. I finished showering. Got dressed. Went on a quest to find the nearest plan b. I was not about to have a baby with a rapist. The lady in the check-out lane looked at me, looked at what I was buying. Just another day in Vegas for her. I ended up buying a muffin and orange juice to help wash the pill down. When I got to the room he was not there. I quickly phoned my best friend. I told her what happened. She comprehended what happened right away. My brain was still catching up. She insisted I come home. I could hear the worry in her voice. Our conversation was short. He ended up coming back into the room.

I was sitting at the table in the room. I remember saying, “what the fuck was that about last night?” to which he played dumb. After further clarifying for him, he said he was “drunk.” He said he “thought I wanted to.” He said, “I put in some moves as well.” He came up with some lame excuse that his uncle died and preferred to go home. In that moment I thought, “if I go to the police, they won’t believe me.” And so, I remained quiet. Years later, I found out you can request a rape kit. Or a rape assessment to be done. They will save the evidence in case you ever do want to press charges. I wish I had known that.

I never got to see the Grand Canyon.

I told my sisters about it. My sister’s best friend. My best friend knew. No one knew how to handle that Vegas trip story. I felt like when I told it I was saying it about someone else. Maybe I had hoped that in me saying it out loud it would sink in. It would sink in that THAT happened to me.

It didn’t sink in for a year and a half. I repressed the emotions. The knowledge of what had happened.

No matter how much you try to repress emotions. They find a way to rise to the top. And when they did. I felt guilt. I felt anger. I felt anxiety. I felt anger towards the person that raped me. I still do. But the guilt is what killed me. For months. Or years until I found professional help the guilt followed me like a shadow. It would tell me, “Why did you think you were safe with this person? Why didn’t you fight? Why did you drink that much? This is YOUR fault.”

I was diagnosed with PTSD. Since that happened, I have been to Vegas once. I was nowhere near the venetian. I saw a friend post a selfie, her, at the venetian. The beautiful fake ceiling of clouds behind her. I was transported back to that night. My chest automatically tightened. And flash backs of that night came back. My rapist has tried to make a name for himself in the neighboring community and will interview people. When he pops up on my feed interviewing beautiful strong women, I can’t help but think, “don’t you know a rapist is interviewing you?” I’ve bumped into him twice at a plant store and coffee shop. Happened the same day. How many of us get to face our rapist? Not once did he look at me. Look me in my eyes. He knew what he did. I hope it haunts him every day. Just like it haunts me.

It has been 9 years. Though the years have passed, bits and pieces of that night still remain, ingrained in my memory. I relive them every.single.day. There are things that seem clearer to me now than they did in the first few months. In the years that have transgressed since that day, I’ve come to see how what happened to me happens to a lot of people. No one talks about it. We remain silent. Try to repress.

I've been lurking here for ages and commenting occasionally. Now I need your help.



**Background:** I'm a finance + CS grad working on property investment analysis tools. But before I spend months building something nobody wants, I want to talk to actual investors about what helps vs. what's just noise.



**Looking to chat with people who:**

* Own 2+ investment properties
* Are looking for their next property (or bought recently)
* Have some kind of process for evaluating opportunities

**What I want to learn:**

* How you currently find/evaluate properties
* What tools/data you use (or wish existed)
* What's frustrating about the process
* Whether certain features would be genuinely useful

**What I'm NOT doing:**

* Selling anything
* Trying to get signups
* Pitching you my product



Just genuine research, so I don't waste time building something useless.



**Happy to buy coffee** in Melbourne or jump on a 20-30 min Zoom call if you're elsewhere.



Comment or DM if you're up for a chat. Cheers!",0,1762586929.0,AusPropertyChat,3,0.17,False
1orja46,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_PhilosopherJolly6767/comments/1orja46/my_mom_wont_get_a_job/,My mom wont get a job,"Hi, Im not one who usually posts on here but I can't talk to anyone about this. Im 16f and my mom 40f live alone together. I see my dad regularly, but my mom won't let me live with him. My dad had a really bad injury, so he had to stop working all together. My mom has not had a job since I was 1, and has just been living off my dad paying rent for me and buying me groceries. My mom got a big sum of money that the government owed her late June, and I just found out she has $250 left. She got 20k btw. I know we spent alot of money, but I trusted her to budget it enough so we can have a comfortable living for a few months until she can find a job to support us. After she told me how much she has left, I started to panic. I asked how much in rent she has paid she hasn't said, and she didn't give a clear response. When I was 13 I started working to help with groceries and gas money, because she made me feel like some burden. My dad really tried to help, but he also lives with my step mom and her family and can't just live there rent free while supporting us. Now, I work 2 jobs, get good grades, volunteer, workout, and barely have time to breath. This mean I am not at home from 8:30am to roughly 8pm. When I get home I have to start my homework right away, shower ofc, and hear my mom complain about dishes. She suffers from a low iron deficiency and is tired all the time. I am saving for a car because I am moving out as soon as possible. This means I have $2,000 in my savings. 

Im trying to stop this ramble sorry guys. Our rent is $1,400/month which is pretty good in Canada. She won't be able to pay rent this month since we have no income anymore, and my dad can no longer support me. If it comes down to it I will move in with him and have to let my mom figure it out on her own. She has no problem with taking my money no matter where I hide it. My dad and I are trying to find a way to have me move out without her screaming and getting angry. My dads scared of her and so am I. Today when I asked has any places gotten back to her for work she ignored me as usual. I was annoyed, I just went to school from 830 to 330 then work from 345 to 6. Worked out, studied and tried to hold it together. Today, my mother worked out this morning, went swimming, drove me to work, we got coffee, and she cooked dinner. Im nit saying her days are easy, but this is important to keep in mind. I dont get many weekends off as well. When she ignkred me I kept showing her job listenings, and she groaned and then sounded sad and said ""Im just thinking of my long days, if I get one I'll be working 10-5, working out, then cooking dinner."" This enraged me. I have school, then I go to tutor these tiny children who are all effing rude, then I go wirkout to stay sane, then I come home to do homework, feed the pets, clean the litter, and I am go go go from 8am to 8pm every single day and everytime I tell her I need a break she asks why. I forgot to mention this but my dad is super sick, and I dont know whats wrong with him nor do our doctors. I barely have time to see him, and my famiky just thinks im avouding him. I dont have any days off, my mom has everyday off. She complains about the most simplest things like driving me to school and making me dinner as if she's just some roommate of mine. When I was 13 I made her dinner every single day when she was first diagnosed with low iron, she wouldn't move, eat or do anything.  She was depressed and I was her caretaker. I did the dishes, cleaning, work, shopping. I did it all. Now that shes better I thought she would idfk, lock in. Now she is just angry and wont do anything without complaining. Shes upset while cooking one meal a day, working out, and driving me to school and work. I get how it can be hard, but I'm tired of her complaining about how she has to parent her kid for 2 more years. Thats it. TWO more years then im out. Shes free of me and she'll never have to worry again. I'll get my license early July, and I'll have enough to buy a car. I really need my dad right now but everyones mad at me for not visiting enough. I feel like im going to explode I am nkt worrying on whether or not she is homeless. What do I do I need help. My house burnt down around the time she got the money, and now I have to live 30 minutes from my town. Theres no buildings farms or anything cool on the way in just highway.

**Hello deshvasiyon,**  
I’m 31M. So I’ll keep it simple, but still, it will be a long post. I suffered from IBS for 11 years and cured myself 100% of it recently. I spent years searching for cures all over the world — did a hell of a lot of research and self-tested expensive meds, hormones, and whatnot. While the fix turned out to be just some tablets from your local medical store and a few lifestyle changes.

**Disclaimer:** I’m no medical practitioner, nor am I going to sell anything. It’s purely based on my experience.

# Primary causes of IBS

1. **SIBO** – Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth
2. **SIFO** – Small Intestinal Fungal Overgrowth
3. **Parasites** – You may have parasites in your body without any direct symptoms.
4. **Heavy metals** – Lead, mercury, etc.
5. **RO water** – If you’re drinking RO water, check the TDS. 0 TDS means you’re drinking distilled water devoid of minerals. The lack of these critical minerals causes lots of issues, especially in mental and physical development of kids/individuals.
6. **Dust or mold fungus in your home** – These can cause autoimmune reactions in some individuals due to long-term exposure. IBS is one such reaction.

# FIX

1. **Rifaximin** (sold as *Sibofix* in India) – To clear SIBO. It works in the intestines only.
2. **Fluconazole** – To clear SIFO, yeast, and fungal infections.
3. **Albendazole** – To clear parasites.
4. **Zeolite liquid** – To remove heavy metals from the body (chelation therapy).
5. **Vitamin C** – Fixes and heals the gut, especially leaky gut.

# Lifestyle changes

1. **Normal tea with spices** – To improve digestion and combat bad gut microbiome, and clear biofilms in the gut.
2. **Reduce stress** – Calm yourself, work on your traumas, and if possible, cut cords with toxic people.
3. **Drink tap water after boiling it well** (only if your water supply is good). Get mineral water otherwise, or take supplements like copper, silver, iron, magnesium, etc.
   * We switched to tap water as it is good and salt-free. Really a mind-opening experience.
   * (Still finding a way to filter water for toxins and metals but retain minerals.)
4. **Start using a vacuum cleaner** – Don’t use a broom as it disperses dust into the air, which you end up inhaling 24x7. A vacuum cleaner is good; a robot vacuum is better.
5. **Use an air purifier at home** – This gets rid of dust and microbes, giving you a chance to inhale pure air.
6. **Keep your home clean** – Don’t let dust gather.
7. **BLACK MOLD** – Fix it ASAP like it’s a plague, or move away from that place.

# Regimen (what worked for me)

**Sibofix 400** – 14 days, twice a day after meals.

**Fluconazole 150** – 14 days, twice a day after meals.

**Albendazole 400** – Once a day after meals for 8 days. (15 mg dosage per kg of body weight – calculate accordingly.)

**Zeolite** – 5 drops in 1 liter of water, 3 times a day (3L daily water intake).

**Tea** – Made with milk, star anise, bay leaves, cloves, and ginger. Must be pungent – 1 or 2 times a day.

**Vitamin C** – Take tablets or Vitamin C-rich foods daily.

***EDIT : Finish Antibiotics first, followed by antifungal, followed by antiparasitic, then finally zeolite.***

***Not all at the Same time.***

# Tests I conducted on myself to assess the cure

1. I tested myself with 10 full-sized tubs of ice cream so far in a month, pizzas, erratic eating, coffee, tea with full sugar, sodas, food from random restaurants, naan, maida-rich foods, pastries, jams, biscuits, etc. My stools remain consistent, no flatulence or bloating. I used to feel tired and shut down after eating these. Now I’m brisk. I still feel some post-food slump, but only normal levels — not crippling anymore.
2. Went on two long solo drives for 600 km in 13–15 hours during the afternoon, evening, and night. Ate at good restaurants on the way. Was absolutely focused and didn’t feel tired or sleepy. Reached home after 12 a.m. I had never driven after sunset in the past 11 years because of gritty eyes, foggy vision, and body pain after eating.
3. I’ve tried all milk products — ice cream, high-fat milk, paneer, cheese, curd, yogurt, etc. No IBS effects at all. Not lactose intolerant anymore.
4. Tried all wheat and maida-based products — no reactions at all. Not gluten intolerant anymore.

# Positive effects after cure

1. Clarity of mind — finally felt my body like I used to when I was in school. Pain and problem-free. It was really something else. I enjoyed taking deep breaths. The world felt alive again.
2. Improved positivity, clarity, and confidence.
3. Better digestion — poop size and shape stay consistent no matter what.
4. One word: life feels mine once again.
5. Improved clarity, less to no brain fog, sharpness, ability to understand social cues, ability to sync well with life. Earlier it felt like I was blocked out of life.
6. No body pain or joint pain.
7. Cured of blood pressure, increased heart rate, and high cholesterol.
8. Increased endurance.
9. Hormones feel balanced.

# Supplementary lifestyle changes (not necessary but good for you)

1. Reduce or avoid sugar/processed foods — the bad guys in your gut thrive on sugar.
2. Drink water properly.
3. Eat fiber-rich foods — your gut will thank you. If you’re lazy, take isabgol; banana stem is better.
4. Eat healthy — more greens, watery veggies, and fruits.
5. Let your major source of carbs be fruits.
6. Strive to be happy. Go in that direction. No detours.

# Addendum

Since I’m involved with electronics and I poke my nose into all hazardous places, I had a high chance of lead poisoning from soldering with lead-based solder and other heavy metals.  
So kids — if you’re tinkering with soldering, use lead-free material.

# Effects and damages I faced due to IBS

# Biological issues

1. Frequent bloating, inconsistent stools — one day constipated, another day diarrhea.
2. Fibromyalgia, autoimmune symptoms.
3. Sudden hives breakout.
4. Joint pain.
5. Lactose intolerance.
6. Gluten intolerance.
7. Sugar intolerance.
8. When I ate something sugary, my body would shut down.
9. At the peak, I had auto-brewery syndrome — would get drunk from eating carb-rich foods.
   * I could still hear my parents calling me but couldn’t move.
10. Severe inflammation — face would puff up after eating and sleeping; took days to go away.
11. Gritty eyes after eating.
12. Migraines, headaches.
13. Frequent cravings — at one point, I was eating one cooker full of rice and it still wasn’t enough.
14. Felt really weak — eating chicken gave me some relief from body weakness and tiredness. Became a full-time carnivore, but it wasn’t healthy overall.
15. High blood pressure (was taking meds).
16. Increased heart rate.
17. Inconsistent, elevated cholesterol — had to take statins to keep it in check.
18. Taking medicines further made me weak.
19. Frequent stomach ulcers (was losing blood, making me iron deficient).
20. Frequent skin infections.
21. Malabsorption — was deficient in many vitamins and minerals.
22. And many more things I can’t remember now.
23. EDIT as u/[Froyo\_Curious](https://www.reddit.com/user/Froyo_Curious/) mentioned, unexplained excessive sweating all over the body.

# Psychological effects (caused directly or indirectly by IBS)

1. Anxiety, sometimes crippling.
2. Paranoia.
3. Anger issues, rage fueled by high blood pressure and cholesterol.
4. Extreme stress fueled by life events.
5. Suicidal thoughts fueled by life events.
6. Inability to think properly.
7. Brain fog.
8. Negative thoughts.
9. Some more I can’t remember.

# Social effects

1. Fell from grace — from top of the sky to bottom of the ocean, basically became a degenerate.
2. I shut down and was unable to be an active member of society anymore.
3. My dad had this too, which I didn’t know at that time.
4. Family became a shit show — from being a bright family with tons of potential to one people wouldn’t touch with a 10-foot pole.
5. Delayed/stunted life and social growth.
6. Severe financial effects.
7. Unable to drive long distances.
8. Unable to socialize.
9. Couldn’t even eat at relatives’ homes, as I wouldn’t be able to drive back without my body reacting badly and my brain shutting down.
10. Endurance to do anything dropped significantly.

# Coping mechanism

1. Sheer brute-force will, just like how my dad led his entire life until his death.
   * I realized this only recently. We used to get mad at him for having all the talent but being unable to excel.

# When it all started

1. Looking back, it started when I went away from home for university. The uni was top-notch, but the hostel conditions were bad and unhygienic. That’s where it all began.
2. My mom told me my dad also lived in a hostel during childhood and contracted lots of infections, which, in his words, “didn’t let him eat well.”
   * I could really draw parallels between my dad and me.
   * It could be genetic — maybe the immune system is weak or the digestive system is sensitive.

# Meds/Pros/Fixes I tried

1. **Endocrinologist 1** – Took tests blindly, said everything was okay, asked me not to stress much.
2. **Endocrinologist 2** – Better; said everything was okay except vitamin D. Started taking Vitamin D — felt some relief mentally but didn’t last long.
3. **Gastroenterologist** – Said everything was okay, advised me to avoid coffee, tea, and milk as I had flare-ups after dairy.
4. **General Surgeon** – Checked my organs, said all okay; advised more veggies, avoid oily foods.
5. **Cardiologist** (my mother’s desperation) – I said I felt like sand particles in my eyes. His reply: “Such things don’t happen; it’s in your mind.” (It’s known as gritty eyes today.)
6. Kept searching for a fix — came across testosterone, tried topical creams, then injections. Helped initially, but IBS was still there. It just kept me going on brute force. Stopped when my anger issues got out of control.
7. Ayurvedic enemas from a local store.
8. Many others I’ve forgotten over the years.

# Potential paranormal link

1. This isn’t confirmed, might sound stupid, but looking back — I once went into a graveyard at midnight with a corpse burning and stayed there for 5 minutes to win a bet with friends. Met with an accident the next morning.
   * If I draw a line on my timeline, that’s when life started going south — not just mine but my family’s too.
   * Sister got into an abusive relationship, became suicidal, we had a theft at home, I dropped out twice, social isolation, insane family fights, dad broke down and stopped caring, wrong friends, etc.
   * I’m not blaming external factors for everything, but looking back, it feels like external forces have more control over our lives than we think.

# Vaastu link

It might sound flaky, but hear me out. I started studying Vaastu and Feng Shui, trying to find a scientific connection. Our house had an extreme skew in the southwest corner — the worst as per Vaastu. It’s said to cause tumors, cancer, kidney failures, heart issues, and lower abdomen or psychological issues for men in the family.

Coincidentally:

* My mother developed uterine lumps and suffered for years before removing her uterus.
* My dad developed heart issues in 2014, got better in 2019, but passed away in 2022 from heart-related ailments.
* We fixed the Vaastu in 2019 — things improved, but my IBS and dad’s gut issues remained.

The final fix came when I studied molds and realized **BLACK MOLD** was causing many issues in our home. Folks, if you have black mold, clean and fix it ASAP — or move away. These microbes wreak havoc on the immune system and body. They practically hijack the mind, make you addicted to dopamine, and reduce rational thinking.

**The link:**  
Extended southwest corner → high humidity + mold/fungi/algae growth.  
They thrive in the west, as tall trees there reduce sunlight and increase humidity — perfect for mold/algae/fungus growth.

# Astrology link

During my search for answers, I stumbled upon astrology and psychics. Many said there was a *family curse* and that descendants were paying for ancestral deeds.  
A few astrologers told me to donate blood to fix my karma. That clue about “blood” led me to study deeper — and then I found this:

# Genetic link

After my dad passed, my mom shared his struggles. I could draw parallels between his life and mine — severe body pain, yet he kept going with sheer willpower.  
I started digging into genetics and found the **MTHFR gene mutation**. People with it often have weak digestion and poor liver detox ability (especially for heavy metals).

So my dad suffered gradually with age, while I experienced it earlier — probably worsened by lifestyle and exposure to toxins.

I also noticed most men from my dad’s side were dull and unmotivated — basically bums. Some were engineers in the ’70s, but still inactive. All had thinning hair, weak bodies, lacking *ojas* and *tejas* — the inner fire.

I had all that too, but this “ancestral curse” hit me harder after 18. That curse, IMO, is this MTHFR gene mutation — reducing digestive ability and toxin removal.( Elevated levels of heavy metals/toxins in blood) which might be why donating the blood could have potentially helped me in absence of chelation therapy.

Guess what — my hair was thinning more due to lead poisoning from exposure, and my body couldn’t eliminate it. The levels weren’t super high, but still unhealthy.  
Now, after removing heavy metals with zeolite, my hair is growing thick and strong again. Gained motivation, drive, and zeal once more.

If you’ve come this far, I appreciate your patience — and I wish you **good luck in regaining control of your life** and living the best life you truly deserve.

**You aren’t defeated until you accept defeat.**

EDIT 1: Eat at hygienic and quality places only. It is easily to contract these sibo sifo parasites through them.

If your mother or father is still healthy and strong, ask them to mash the food with their hands well and feed you. You should get some good guys to your microbiome from that.

EDIT 2: Ill be adding some video links here for reference.

Acrid smoke slicked the alley walls, thick with burning carcinogens and ozone. From his crawlspace perch underneath a partially collapsed ventilation shaft, Thatch watched the skirmish unfold in fractured glimpses. Drone silhouettes flashed past gaps in metal siding, stuttering muzzle flashes bounced down the corridors like angry starlight.

He stayed off the battlenet. Trying to hack into a live feed in the throes of a firefight was like stuffing your head into a microwave oven. Even with his gear completely powered down, he *felt* the static crackle of jamming, the hard pulsing of counter-jamming, the whole band pressure-thick with combat AI probing for any opening, the way the world grows stifling before a storm.

He didn’t move. Not a breath louder than the wind. His coat masked his thermal signature, enough to read as past-tense organic. In theory. Below the sensor trip-values.

Theory and practice had an annoying habit of disagreeing down here. Thatch hadn’t been eviscerated by a pulse lance or had his brain cooked by a las-round yet. So far, so good.

His hood and rebreather rig itched, the edges of the muzzle digging into the thin skin under his eyes. The label promised legit *XanZey Corp* *“Shenzhen-produced”* quality, but the piece of shit had Sanaa subsidiary production stink all over it.

His clammy hands, hidden beneath his coat, tapped against the rusty old gun in his pocket. Slow, then quick, then slower again. The rhythm of some vaguely remembered nursery rhyme. His face, as ever, was a slab: quiet, unreadable. But his fingers betrayed him. That nervous rhythm had kept him sane through a dozen close calls, and it hadn’t failed him yet.

Across the alley, something screamed as an exosuit was split open by a plasma arc. The sounds echoed like maniacal metal laughter.

Thatch leaned back slightly, tilting his head just enough to glimpse the bodies dropping and accumulating as the firefight waned. He instinctively counted movement. Three shadows left. Then two. Then one. Then none.

The quiet was worse than the noise.

He waited. Cruelly won experience rooted him in place. Junkers who ran in too fast got cooked for free. He’d wait, like always. Wait until no one was left who could remember what had happened here. No one who cared, anyway.

Staggered, irregular footsteps. Someone was still clinging on to their last moments, somewhere beyond his flimsy rathole. A shout. A last angry flash. A groan. Rapid footsteps, fading. Then quiet again.

Real quiet this time. Thatch had learned the difference between keeping quiet and true silence. The silence of death.

He gently shook his head, sighed inaudibly. An old-head had once taught him, long ago: Shake loose the fear from your head. Force it from your chest with a forceful exhale. Then go 'On the bounce', that brief moment of calm between breaths. The tiny crack in the inertia of terror.

*""Let's go. On your feet,""* he hissed to the ragged, huddled dregs assembled behind and around him.

*""Remember, 45 seconds. No more. Take only what you can carry at a run. No fucking heroics. Anyone falls behind, you're on your fucking own.""*

3, 2, 1… \*Exhale\*

*""Go! Go! Go! Fucking shift it! Out!""* Thatch bellowed.

Five miserable figures shot out from their crawlspace like so many rats from a sewer skittering into the open. Panicked. Blinking against the harsh light of day. Tunnel-visioned on whatever glittered with value. Pale hands with bony fingers frantically clawed at the bodies in the corridor.

\-Some loose power cells for a plasma rifle-  
\-A few shards of durilium armor plating-

Anything their fence could scrub and move.

A severed hand caught Thatch’s eye. Might have one or two wetware implants. No time to separate the still-warm organics from the shiny bits. Thatch stuffed it into his tattered polymer-weave courier bag. The expanding red stain on the bag barely stood out against the backdrop of old grey-brown grime.

His subretinal flashed angry red digits in his peripheral. 15. 14…

*""10 seconds!""* Thatch roared. *""Last call!""*

A final scramble. Anything. Anything at all.  
Time’s up. They’ll be here any second now.  
Thatch could hear the high-pitched whining of the reaction force’s grav-lev engines echo over the sprawl as he slid back into the dark safety of the tunnels.

\*

Thatch slid back the metal grating that formed the entrance to their subterranean hideout. Home base. For now.

He counted three figures slipping past him through the hatch, from the dark into the relative comfort of the disused utility space. *Like a crypt, but with none of the warm, inviting charm of eternal sleep.* Thatch groaned to himself.

The place smelled of black mold, melting plastic and adhesives from the cheap space-heater, and the distinct twang of unwashed bodies and excrement. A dim flickering blue light reflected off the cold, rotting concrete walls.

They stumbled in, breath ragged, boots tracking in wet decay from the tunnels. It wasn’t much more than a half-sunken basement buried under an abandoned hab-block, but the steel door sealed, and the ceiling only leaked when it rained hard. For Thatch, that was squared away. The fucking Hilton. Five-star luxury.

Thatch slammed the bolt behind them and held his breath as he flicked through sentry feeds on his subretinal. Visuals clean. No thermal or EM signatures. No pursuit. Not yet.

The crew collapsed onto scavenged crates and threadbare mats. Someone coughed behind their mask, someone else tore theirs off and puked in a corner. No one spoke until someone muttered the question:

*“Fuck. Where’s Kes?”*

Thatch didn’t look up. “*Fell behind.”* He muttered with half feigned detachment. She’d been a recent addition to the group. Classic story. Minor nobility nepo. Got in with the wrong crowd. Developed some expensive stim habits and the inevitable debts. Rich enough to avoid getting snuffed outright. Not enough to be allowed back into uni or get a job up there. She wasn’t too bad for a nepo. Truth was he’d liked Kes. Been attracted to her, maybe. Something about her voice. Slightly lower register, calm, notes of genuine kindness in there. Probably what kept him away from her. Knew that wouldn’t last down here.    
  
He shook her from his mind.  
  
Should be fine. She didn’t know anything important.   

\*

The bags came open. The haul hit the table, a stained workbench scarred with old plasma scoring. Battery cells. Cracked plating. A bent piston and fists of tangled wiring. All dumped in messy heaps under the weak flicker of the battered lantern taped to the ceiling.

*“Scored a good cell here”* someone said, hopeful.

*“Doubt it”* someone else replied. *“Look at the casing.”*

Laughter broke out when one of them realized they’d dragged back a solid shard of concrete.

*“Shit. I panicked, alright?”*

*“Your fence sells actual rocks now?”* Someone joked.

*""Maybe if I polished it real nice and shiny?""*

*“And then beat him senseless with it? Only way you’ll ever squeeze creds with that”*

Even Thatch managed half a smile at that.

He pulled his courier bag open on the edge of the bench, half-listening. The severed hand slid out first, smearing blood across the metal. One of the others recoiled, muttering curses.

Nestled in the base of the palm, barely visible. Smooth, dark. No ports. No scratches. Just… there. It made no sound. It did nothing. But it looked too perfect. Too smooth. Too dark. Too *expensive*. It didn’t belong in this pile of scrap. It didn't belong in *their* hands. They all instinctively sensed it.

Thatch stared at it a fraction longer than he should have. When he glanced up, he caught Krey meeting his eyes from across the room. Quiet, stoic Krey. White haired, wiry, hunched Krey. Krey, the last of the old-heads.

Krey said nothing. He rarely did. Just a minute shrug as he turned away, toking a chem-stick and disappearing into the shadows.

\*

The excitement died down. The room went quiet. The group spread out, half asleep or sprawled out in chemical bliss. Someone tuned an old-band radio low. Static filled the room like dust.

Thatch was alone at the bench when Krey returned.

“You got a sec?”

Thatch didn’t answer. Krey took that as a yes.

They stepped into a narrow storage alcove, past a hanging tarp which smelled of mold and ammonia. Krey didn’t mince words.

“You know what that is?”

Thatch grinned. “Yeah. Ticket out of this shithole.’’

“It’s not junk.”

“It was on the field and it has residual value.”

Krey leaned in, voice low. “You feel it, don’t you? I know you do. That thing’s not *for* us. It's not *meant* for *us*, Thatch.”

Thatch avoided Krey’s piercing gaze.

Krey continued, more tense now, yet oddly fatherly. “You’ve been around long enough to know how this works, my boy. When something’s too clean? Too sleek? That’s not luck. That’s nothing but trouble.”

“I’m not giving it up” Thatch said, flat.

“Yeah? You think it’s worth it? Worth all of our lives?” Krey hissed angrily.

“I think…” Thatch looked past him, eyes unreadable. “I just picked it up like any other junk. Finders keepers. So?”

Krey seemed disappointed with that answer. He shook his head slowly, then stepped back.

“Thatch’’ He sighed. “When they come -and they will, Thatch- don’t say old Krey didn’t warn you.”

He shouldered past Thatch without another word. The object sat where he’d left it. Still quietly exuding value. Still violently clashing with its current surroundings.

It pulsed, once. A faint crackle of static that brushed Thatch’s skin.

So faint it could’ve been imagined.

\*

*Kes had been last back through the slit in the concrete.* In the gloomy twilight, and with the stink of tunnel air stinging her eyes, she could only just make out the figures of the others ahead of her. Until, suddenly, she found herself alone. Unnoticed by anyone she had turned down the wrong spur somewhere. Her footsteps echoed hollow against unfamiliar looking concrete. By the time she realized -and had finished cursing her rookie mistake-, the sound of heavy combat boots and the insect-like skittering of tracker drones filled the corridor behind her.

The RapFor-squad spilled into alley seconds after Thatch’s crew had ducked out. In time to trace the dying thermal signature of their footsteps down the tunnels.  
Floodlamps caught Kes mid-step. She froze and convulsed as several directed nanowave beams trained on her.

They didn’t shoot her. No sense wasting the rounds. Best case, she meant intel. Worst, she meant a few minutes of ‘hands-on field experience’ for the rookies.

Dragged back to a local field post, she was interrogated under light and lash. Kes had nothing to give them. Nothing that interested them. But her lack of value read as defiance.

Fine. Be that way. They’d shrugged. They plugged her in to the virtual anyway. Brutal synaptic overload, perceived-weeks worth of agony inflicted in mere minutes real-world.

The report rolled in. 27 years of life, the entirety that was Kes, machine-condensed into 15 bullet points anyone might actually give a fuck about.

Maybe. Someone. Not the interrogator. He sipped coffee behind a desk, glared at Kes, at the list, back to Kes again. Sighed and left without a word.

\*

Against his better judgement, Krey had gone looking for her. Maybe just the effects of entropy on his aging mind. The girl was young. Krey was getting old. Something about human nature perhaps. The cynicism of a lifetime bleeding into something mimicking empathy? The self-destructive instincts of surrogate parenthood? He never knew which. Krey didn’t question things anymore. He found her trail easily enough. Walked straight into the sentry drones they’d left just in case anyone was dumb enough to come looking.

They broke him down methodically, fear pried open his clenched jaw. He gave them everything he had. They plugged him in anyway. Maybe to be sure they’d  extracted every last bit of data from his mind. Maybe just sadistic spite. The machine sifted through the shards and fragments of Krey’s mind until something caught its attention.  

\*

For Thatch the following days blurred into a tense spiral. Krey hadn’t returned from a routine salvage run. The change in fortunes rolled in quietly. His usual contact at the docks looked through him as though he’d never existed. He caught hard stares from strangers in reflections when they thought he wasn’t looking. Something in the air had shifted. He could feel it, the way prey feels a predator’s shadow looming.

Thatch hadn’t returned to the basement since. The next morning’s news-crawl rolled past on his subretinal: **SUB-LEVEL GAS LEAK. LOCAL ROOF FAILURE. 2-3 BODIES RECOVERED. NO FOUL PLAY SUSPECTED.** **CONDOLENCES AUTO-ISSUED.**  
Bullshit. There hadn’t been a gasline anywhere near that place. Much less one that still functioned.

Paranoia set in. He caught the same face twice in different markets. A microdrone hovered a moment too long. Once, he thought he saw someone he knew -Kes?- but when he raised a hand, they turned their back, walking faster. His world shrank by the hour.

What made it worse was he never even got the damn implant to spark, much less *work*. But to Thatch its presence might as well have been branded on his forehead. The looks, the whispers from passersby. His bag felt heavier each day, the strap seemingly grating and burning against his neck. In the lowers, someone like him wasn’t to hold value like that. Not of this scale. Not for long. To carry something like that was to carry a death sentence. A tiny dog lugging a giant bone. In this world, that was bound to attract the attention of all kinds of nasty wildlife. 

He'd had the good sense to stay off the net. Keep a low profile until things had ran their course. Shouldn’t be more than a week or two he told himself. He tried to keep afloat the only way he knew how, fencing physical odds and ends. But buyers shook their heads and muttered about not wanting trouble when they saw him coming. Until one accidentally blurted out the truth, muttering: *“You’ve got heat on you, Thatch. Don’t come back here.”*

He realised he hadn’t slept in two days. Couldn’t remember his last meal. The stim tabs barely cut through the fog anymore. His hands shook as he booted the cracked linkpad, the kind of antique hardware no corpo scanner would even bother tracking. He had to surface just long enough to scope out the situation. A single sonar ping to get his bearings, so to speak. He could deal with hunger and fear, but he had to know where things stood. What he was in for. His hazy mind told him with little luck his signature would drown in the background clutter and wouldn’t be noticed.

The ancient public access terminal was tucked under a stairwell, its housing stripped to bare metal, the ports sticky with grime and melted polymer. Someone had scrawled “SWEET DREAMS, SANDMAN” across the wall in marker. Someone’s idea of a joke, no doubt.

He slotted the device into the primary port, jacked a lead from his subretinal feed to the panel, and whispered, “C’mon… just give me something.”

The interface flared, a shivering bloom of dead code, half-rendered UI nodes floating in a void. Fragments of language stitched with error glyphs. He didn’t understand what he was looking at, only that it might contain *something* of worth.

His antiquated search algorithm hummed laboriously as it filtered through an ocean of static. All it turned up were public access news feeds, scrambled bits of ancient socials posted by Kes a lifetime ago.. He tweaked the prompts as best he could. Upped the range and intrusion codes. Maybe if he could.. Hold up, this was recent. Secnet signature. Kes’ interrogation files.

Thatch couldn’t believe it worked. He still had it. Despite everything. He tried to trace the data signature, following its encrypted thread through a tangle of ghostcode and firewall baffles. Everything came back genuine.

He really should have known then and there.  

The return ping hit him like a kick to the skull. For a second the world split into pure white and soundless pressure.

Almost simultaneously came the searing feedback.

**<<HEY, THATCH... CATCH!💀>>** Pulsed across his retinals.

A building static strummed a sickeningly familiar melody on his nerves.

“Shit. No, no, no. Shit!”

He screamed, animalistic, frantically ripping the jack from his temple, hard enough to leave a bloody streak down his cheek.

Too slow.

His left eye went dark first, the lens rupturing with a wet pop. The stink of burned synaptic gel filled the air.

Thatch staggered backward, half-blind, vision fracturing into static mosaics. The feedback still echoed down his spine, his whole nervous system jittering out of sync. He slammed a fist against the wall until the pain grounded him again.

The world swam. His right eye pulsed red warning symbols — *retinal overload / system error / visual feed corrupted.*

“Yeah. Fuck you too.”

He collapsed, panting.

The terminal’s display still blinked somewhere above him, lazy and indifferent, spitting out one final line before fading to black:

**<<COMPLIANCE ORDER ISSUED: REMAIN IN PLACE FOR PROCESSING>>**

Thatch sat trembling in the flickering blue light, smoke curling from his temple port. Half the world had gone dark, but he could still *feel* the pulse echo through his nerves.

He spat blood, wiped it with a shaking hand, and laughed, hoarse, bitter.

\*

Nights grew long and cold. He lay awake, staring at the cracked ceiling, imagining bootfalls outside, listening for the scrape of a lock. Every sound in the pipes became a pursuer, every shadow a waiting ambush. The metal of his gun felt cool in his palm. The faint smell of rust and oil as it trembled hesitatingly towards his temple.

Krey’s warning hung over him, but for reasons Thatch did not understand, the fear twisted into defiance. He clung to it even as his gut screamed at him to throw the thing on the ground at his feet, and never come back. Maybe, just maybe they’d let him slide then. He knew they wouldn’t on principle alone. What would it buy him anyway? A few more months in paradise?   

No, fuck that. Fuck them.

He couldn’t. He wouldn’t.

It was his. He found it. They had no right to it. Let them take it from him.

The glimmer of a smile twitched at the idea of the headache he might be causing some stuffed rosy cheeked dickweasel somewhere. At the thought of those stuck up suits having to descend all the way down here, getting their fancy shoes dirty in the muck and filth of his world.

*Yeah.* He smirked. *Make them sweat for once. Make them breathe in the stench of the lowers for once. Even if it is just a tiny speedbump on the road of their lives.* 

That night, he slept more soundly than he had in weeks.

\*

They finally cornered Thatch in the bones of an abandoned transit hub a few days later. Floodlights burned the shadows away, drones clicking like metallic hunting dogs keeping right on the edge of his peripheral vision. He had nowhere left to run, and nothing to bargain. Not even the threat of destroying the thing they wanted. So he waited for them to make their move, the augment clutched tight in his hands.

A voice echoed harshly through his auditory: *surrender*. He spat on the cracked tile floor and laughed.

Maybe he had nothing. Maybe he’d always *been* nothing. But tonight, he had this. He’d annoyed them. Made a nuisance of himself. Made them waste their precious time and money tracking his worthless ass down. His finger tapped rhythmically against the gun in his pocket.

Exhale.

One last time.

*On the bounce*.

The gun swung up.

He didn’t fire a shot. Didn’t get the chance. It wasn’t loaded anyway.

The wall of light erupted and swallowed him whole.

They dragged him out of the rubble, convulsing, face -what was left of it-bloodied and mangled. He felt hands jerk and tear at him. Ransack his pockets and bag. Thatch giggled like a deranged child as he spat blood at the blurred outlines of faces.

The world hadn’t changed. The city still rotted.

*Found it, sir.*

But for a breath, a flicker, he had mattered enough to be hunted down.

*What was it?*

As they hauled him into the waiting transport, he kept giggling. It didn’t matter. It was over.

*Biometric scanner key for a weapon. Wiped, by the looks of it.*

A tiny speck of sand in the mighty machinery of power, now being power-washed away.

*Worthless.*

I’ve been using the Colombian Brew Strong & Smooth coffee sachets (yellow ones), but the taste feels very mild with almost no real coffee flavor. I expected something bolder, but it just doesn’t taste like coffee to me.

Has anyone else experienced the same thing?  
Is this normal for Colombian Brew, or is it possibly fake?  
Also, what’s the best-tasting coffee brand available in India right now?

1oriwd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/RezeCult/comments/1oriwd5/how_fujimoto_could_give_us_closure_for_reze/,How Fujimoto could give us closure for Reze,"They say men only fall in love once and after that they’ll compare all their future partners to their first love and try to fill that void.

Reze was Denjis first true love so in a way he is destined to see parts of her in any girl he dates in the future . So picture this. After this current arc wraps up, Asa and Denji (assuming that both of them survive of course) are at a coffee shop. Denji tries to drink coffee once again, only for him to spit it out and rant about how people manage to drink this shit . For a brief moment then Asa starts genuinely laughing and mocks Denji for his expression/ or does a gesture that Reze did during the time she spent with Denji at the coffee shop she worked . And thats when it hits Denji causing him to remember Reze (we know Denji misses her, since after throwing out the bitterness devil she saw a flashback of her laughing) . Denji for a moment blanks out and goes “Reze, if only things had gone on differently…. Or something along those lines)

Then the chapter shifts focus and Fujimoto can finally give us a few panels of Reze so we can get some god damn closure on her since we know she is alive somewhere

Thats all im asking for really. There’s no need to reintroduce her into the story if you have no plans for her and in my opinion that is a smart way to show what she has been up to all this time, without having her interact with Denji and messing up his current dynamic with Asa

Not small talk or forced conversations, but someone I can genuinely connect with. Someone who’s there through the day, someone I can share thoughts with, and someone who feels like a steady presence.

I’m not in a rush for anything. I just want real conversations with someone who’s easy to talk to and naturally fits into my life. If it turns into something meaningful over time, good. If it becomes a solid friendship, that’s good too.

About me. I’m grounded, calm, and straightforward. I like people who think deeply and speak honestly. I’m spiritual in my own way, influenced by psychedelics and philosophies like stoicism. Coffee is basically my morning ritual, and most evenings I wind down with music or a good show. Lately I’ve been diving back into the things that actually make me feel centered.

I’m looking for someone who’s kind, thoughtful, and comfortable being themselves. Someone who can handle a mix of serious conversations and quiet teasing. Someone warm, nurturing, steady.

I’ve previously done 16:8 IF but OMAD has always seemed too hard, I love eating. I’m such a foodie and love trying new things.
I decided to use my lack of appetite to start my OMAD journey, and have been surprised how easy it is to keep up. 
Some rules I set up for myself as I’m a shift worker with a social life: 
- Eat 1 meal a day, lunch or dinner. 
- Every meal must have vegetables, protein and complex carbohydrates. 
- Eat a piece of fruit to end the meal. 
- No counting calories, but prioritise eating till you’re fully satisfied, nothing is not allowed.
- I allow 1 coffee with a dash of oat milk in the morning. 

New things I’ve introduced after research: 
- Microgreens for nutrient dense additions to my meals
- Woman’s multi vitamin 
- Electrolytes 

Overall I’m surprised how easy it is to complete! I have a good understanding of nutrition and by only eating one meal a day I am able to focus on making it the most enjoyable and nutrient dense meal. I am also happy to spend more on better quality organic ingredients as I eat less overall. I have found I am still spending less than I did previously.

So far I have lost 3kg and seen a reduction in my bloated-ness and waistline. 

I have so much more time now that I’m not constantly stopping to eat or prepping my next meal. 

Mentally, I trust myself more and I feel more confident that I can successfully introduce more healthy habits to my life to be on a healthier path. 
Next habits to introduce : 1 per week
- learn to drink coffee without milk
- Hit 10k steps daily 
- Wake up earlier to go for a morning walk to start my day doing something for me. 

Sometimes I get the odd pang of hunger, but I don’t fixate on it and I notice it passes in a few minutes. In the past I would use this hunger cue as a sign I was hungry and often binged on junk food.

I’ve noticed there are quite a few Ethiopian coffee shops around the Deira Naif Freej Murar area in. I’m genuinely curious to understand more about them.

	•	Why are these shops mostly active at night? With girls attracting customers 

	•	I’ve seen that many seem to be run or attended mostly by women — is there a specific cultural or community reason behind that?

	•	What exactly do they serve — just traditional Ethiopian coffee, or also food/shisha/etc.?
	•	Are the prices reasonable, or more on the higher side?

	•	And most importantly — are these just regular social cafés, or is there something else going on (I’ve heard mixed things online)?

If anyone has actually been to one, I’d love to hear your experience or any advice about visiting.

I’m a 22-year-old lesbian looking to meet someone genuine  someone who values real conversation, laughter, and emotional connection. I’m not here for flings or surface-level chats; I’d love to find someone who actually wants to build something meaningful, whether that starts as friendship or grows into more. 💕

A little about me:

* I’m pretty chill and introspective love cozy nights, music, random deep talks, and being around people who are kind and authentic.
* Big fan of movies, nature walks, and trying new food spots (bonus points if you’re into coffee dates ☕).
* Emotionally available and open-minded  I care a lot about communication and mutual respect.

Ideally looking for someone around my age (20–28), who’s also a lesbian or sapphic, and looking for something real. I don’t care where you’re from connections can start anywhere. 🌍

1orindq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1orindq/after_college_life_seems_extremely_unfulfilling/,After college life seems extremely unfulfilling,"I graduated last Spring, took the Summer off to fish, spend time with my girlfriend, and just rest for the last time in my life. Didn't do as much as I hoped to and it stings. I've been working as an Engineer in the construction industry for 2 and a half months. Most of the people I work with are decades older than me. Some are nice, others less so. I hear a lot of ignorant BS on the daily, usually at 6 AM when I get into work. Top of the list is an electrician ranting about how ""Obama conspired to destroy Minnesota by importing Somalians"". It's made me realize how much I underestimated the discrimination trans people specifically face as I hear something derogatory about them almost daily. On paper I can leave at 2:30, in reality it's somewhere between 3:30-4:00, my record is 5:00. Other projects are worse and I am lucky to not be on them but it still nags at me. I get home too tired to do anything besides rot in bed after eating, brushing teeth, and showering. I wake up exhausted, I have to sleep at 8 to get my 8 hours which I never do. The sleep deprivation has caused me to start showing up late which I got in trouble for. I have tried doing things that I find fulfilling after work- Dinner with my GF, friends, or fishing/hitting the gym. But I just find putting any energy after work leads to me being exhausted the next day and potentially late. 

Life feels static. Sometimes I hear people at work go ""where did the week go"" and honestly I have never felt time pass slower in my life. The day at work itself isn't too bad, the fatigue doesn't really hit till after I get out. But the weeks seem to drag on forever and ever. The monotony is making me feel depressed. I sucked at socializing in college and was horribly unconfident. I have gotten a lot better which makes me feel upset about opportunities I had in college and didn't take because of my demeanor. I don't have time to go to social clubs to meet new people, going to a party on the weekend is choosing between unwinding and hobbies. Particularly I feel like I missed out on sexual experiences. My best friend is currently in a phase where he is banging like crazy, swinging from one FWB to the next, actually getting to know different people. I had very few sexual experiences prior to my GF in college. I am very happy with my GF and have no interest in cheating on her but the monotony of life is reminding me of one of the forms of excitement and change I missed out on. I'm a little bicurious but never experimented as I wanted to be confident with women first, as I far prefer sex with women and only feel heteroromantic, and regret it now.

Something I never realized I would miss about classes is the fast pace of the classes, something I hated in school. I actually miss learning something new everyday, as opposed to doing the same or similar kinds of tasks over and over again. My workplace has a condescending attitude towards education, viewing ""industry experience"" as more valuable. But quite frankly, I would have learned more about construction in a quarter of construction management classes than I have learned in the equivalent time-frame of a quarter in the industry. 

They say being young advancing in a career and saving for the future should be your priority, but quite frankly I am not sure I will be able to enjoy my life by the time I have done that. Nearly all my hobby's involve physical activity that is strenuous to me, and as I get older, that will only get harder. I have antiphospholipid syndrome, a disease that causes my blood to clot on itself, and suffered a pulmonary embolism a while ago that left permanent scar tissue in the veins leading to my lungs. I have had a permanent decrease in physical ability (That was already below average). Since I have started work and spent less time being active, walking between classes, going to the gym, etc, I have struggled even more with physical activity. By the time I am retirement age, I will probably be totally unable to do the things I love. Riverboat cruises in Europe with seniors, expensive restaurants, and tourist trap style travel that keeps you on the beaten path are all things that do not appeal to me at all. I am not even sure I will live to retirement age. I make really good money for a guy my age, but I'm not sure it matters. I physically do not have time to spend the money I earn. I could be living in my car during the workweek and my lifestyle would only moderately decrease. Also, for what it's worth, construction managers work life balance seems to get worse as you progress, not better.

I just don't see an out. I feel like I wasted the good years of my life being a shut-in, and now that the real word is hitting me I have been shut out from the world. I cannot take a day off from work without draining PTO, our policy is fairly generous at 3 hours a week, but that irons out to a day off per month. I hardly see my friends anymore. One of my friends cancelled last minute to coming to my birthday party and offered to meet up with me sometime else that week and I politely had to explain to him that I am too drained most of the week to actually be able to do that most days but that I would let him know if I was free. My best friend is a marine oiler and he takes everyday of over time he can get, getting 3 days off every two weeks. We have grown a lot more distant since then, and only see each other on occasions. I miss just crashing at his place, watching anime, some neckbeard ass Youtube video about the Roman Empires war with Carthage, or playing video games. I have a friend working part time at a grocery store, she makes rent and basically lives paycheck to paycheck but frankly I almost envy her life. Her apartment is decent, and she has time to pursue hobby's and interests. I want to find a new job/career path but can't think of anything else I can do with my degree. I am planning to grind out a few months, then slowly ration my savings and maybe supplement them working part time. I kind of want to be a barista at a local coffee shop. It seems soothing, the small shops always have such a relaxed vibe to them, I miss working on homework that I thought was the hardest thing in the world while listening to the baristas enjoy the reprieve in customers towards the end of the day while retirees enjoyed sips of coffee

How did I already know everything I’m reading, it hurts to read at times, it’s like I picked up on a frequency because we share a few astronomical commonalities. 

If I am overstepping please say so, I am just inquisitive, I want to figure everything out! 

******************************************

So it has me raking my brain trying to figure out why? What are the planetary alignments? 

Do certain people born on that day naturally pick up on that frequency because we have a few alignments that our souls are sensitive to? The Divine Light, we can lightly fell, remind others it exists? We all have odd purposes. And if so, why would God want me to spend so many hours (days…only God and I know how long, smh probably too long) thinking about this? 

Tbf I am sick, so it’s either research eastern medicine, or focus on faith and looking at patterns others might not see? 

Is this date accurate for matching the closest echo to The Bab’s declaration? 

(I get really bored my mind never shuts down, even my dreams make sense in life, it doesn’t shut off I wake up with answers lol I have to figure it out) 

**MAY 23, 2039 – 8:45 p.m. local time**  
Location: anywhere with clear dark skies in Shiráz itself, or Tehran, Dubai, Muscat, or eastern Saudi Arabia all work within a few minutes, I have coordinates. 

It should produce an audible “frequency” in the sky. These are **exact hits or near-exact hits** that night (Swiss Ephemeris, 0.1° precision):

The “frequency” numbers - in 2039 echo is **1 in 2,700 years** for the fast-moving bodies alone (Mercury + Moon + Venus + Mars all within 3° simultaneously on the same date).  Add Jupiter within 2° and you’re pushing **1 in 45,000–60,000 years**.  

No closer cluster happens again until ~2576 (the Uranus return), and that one is 550 years away.

Could we mark our calendar.  
May 23, 2039, 8:45 p.m.?

Is it safe to say there might be something beautiful in the sky there that night? Esp if the odds are this way. How did I get to this conclusion. 

I get an idea and ask a question, then I ask what the odds or something is. A computer (AI) is only as smart as the person using it, logic. (I was once a programmer, so seeing a pattern or figuring out the very unique things, I enjoy) Then I go to research if it is correct or not, I try to even do the math, but my mind isn’t always there, it comes and goes now. 

I love seeing patterns where others do not. Or questioning if it even matters. But I would think God would let me relax and write, or something productive. Even finishing reading a new book. The Reality of Man, which as I start to read I have to stop and then get side tracked. 

This is what some call ADHD, but I don’t think they understand. I just like puzzles lol. I loved playing connect the dots as a kid. And I have had faith and spoke to God since I was a child! I have tons of hope there are reasons for some of us to get bored and wonder weird stuff. Every thought has a true purpose and if it is selfless in nature then why not explore it? 

Needless to say, my final lesson is Love (the GREATEST of all gifts) above Faith and Hope, in all religions. How to love people who truly hate you, look them in the eyes and say I love you. When we do this, we finally get to feel God’s Grace, or Spirit, so to speak.

I’m sorry if I overstepped with this post. If so please delete. I was just curious if I was right. As a kid we didn’t have a lot of money, we learned to make telescopes with stuff around the house. I made a coffee can resemble the nights sky as a kid with my Dad, put a candle in it so I could see the stars in my room. (U remember those old really big Folgers coffee cans? Ya those! I was 8) 

I was blessed to have an extremely unique and odd upbringing. This is why I look and see weird things. But I like to think the duality of my personality, and being in the Twins sky, maybe there is purpose, I just never had a chance to actually stop and figure it out? 

(Seeing this weird stuff lol) jk I mean showing people there’s science and Faith aligning possibly in our lifetime? Helping to guide people to the same path I arrived. Not going to lie. My friends are starting to see mini miracles and question how it is possible. 

Or am I really far behind the rest of u lol this one I could believe! I just find this stuff fascinating!

It’s a Keurig Classic and I haven’t used it yet. I’ve never used a pod machine and don’t know much about them. She insisted I also do my research since she does not know much about Keurig and that I use the gift receipt if I find anything better. 
I’ve seen some people recommend the K Supreme, which I don’t mind paying the difference to get if it really is better. I’m a bit confused because the price difference is so small, so why would anyone get the classic if the supreme has more settings? I feel like there’s something I’m missing!

My needs regarding a coffee machine:
- I’m the only one in residence who drinks coffee daily (iced or hot). I also receive guests every two weeks-ish that would like a cup of coffee. So it’ll be used moderately.
- I will be using reusable K-cups

Any tips are also appreciated. Thanks in advance !",1,1762583570.0,keurig,1,1.0,False

Your ghost sits beside me when I drive home. I hear your laugh in songs I used to skip before I met you. I still wake up at the hour you’d text me “can’t sleep either?” — and my heart forgets that you’re gone.

We both knew what we were doing. We both knew it couldn’t last. And still, we built this fragile little world in the cracks of our real lives — stolen hours, coffee cups, whispers in cars, laughter that didn’t belong to anyone but us. I think that’s what hurts the most: how real it felt for something that was never supposed to exist.

You didn’t even have to say goodbye. The silence was enough. I keep telling myself you did the right thing — that walking away was the only version of kindness left between us. But I wish you’d let me see your face one last time, just so I’d know it was over.

I don’t hate you. I could never hate you. I just wish you hadn’t taught me what it felt like to be seen, only to disappear right after.

Wherever you are, I hope you’re okay. I hope you sleep through the night now. I hope you don’t carry the same ache I do when a song reminds me of you.

I won’t send this. You’ll never read it. But it’s 1:24 a.m., and the quiet feels heavier than usual tonight — so I’m sending it out into the void instead.

1ori7iq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatsWaverageHumanName/comments/1ori7iq/read_this_first/,READ THIS FIRST,"Welcome to Cats With Average Human Names!
 This subreddit is dedicated exclusively to sharing pictures of cats that have been given average, everyday human names (think names like John, Sarah, Mike, or Emily—common names you'd hear in daily life, nothing exotic or unusual). **Nothing else is allowed.** All posts must strictly follow the format below. Violations will result in removal, and repeated offenses may lead to a ban.

 1. **Post Content Requirements**
   - Every post must be a picture (photo or image) of a cat.
   - The post title must be **exactly** the cat's average human name (e.g., ""Bob"" or ""Alice""). No additional text, emojis, descriptions, or flair in the title.
   - The post body must be empty—no captions, stories, links, or any text whatsoever. The picture should speak for itself. 
   - Only one cat per post. If you have multiple cats, submit separate posts for each.

2. **What Counts as an 'Average Human Name'?**
   - Names should be common, everyday human first names (e.g., David, Lisa, Tom, Jessica). Avoid rare, celebrity-inspired, or fictional names like ""Zephyr"" or ""Gandalf.""
   - Names can be gender-neutral or from any culture, as long as they're typical and unremarkable (e.g., ""Pat"" or ""Alex"" is fine; ""Moonbeam"" is not).
   - If unsure, think: Would this name blend in at a coffee shop? If yes, it's probably average.

 3. **Prohibited Content**
   - No text posts, memes, videos, GIFs, drawings, or AI-generated images—only real photos of actual cats.
   - No discussions, questions, polls, or off-topic posts (e.g., no ""What's your cat's name?"" threads).
   - No self-promotion, ads, sales, or links to external sites.
   - No reposts of the same cat/image, even with a different name.
   - No NSFW content, violence, or anything harmful to cats (all posts must show happy, healthy felines).

 4. **Community Guidelines**
   - Be respectful in comments—comments are allowed but must only react to the cat and its name (e.g., ""Bob looks so regal!""). No debates, arguments, or off-topic chatter.
   - Report rule-breaking posts/comments instead of engaging.
   - Moderators reserve the right to remove any content that doesn't fit the spirit of the sub, even if it technically follows the rules.
   - Follow Reddit's site-wide rules (e.g., no spam, harassment, or doxxing).

5. **Submission Tips**
   - Use high-quality images where the cat is clearly visible.
   - If your post is removed, check the rules and try again—don't argue with mods.
   - Have fun sharing your averagely human-named cats!

By posting here, you agree to these rules. Let's keep this sub purr-fectly simple and full of ordinary-named kitties! 🐱",1,1762583046.0,CatsWaverageHumanName,0,1.0,False

1ori6at,https://www.reddit.com/r/gurgaon/comments/1ori6at/there_is_no_pullution_in_gurgaon/,There is no pullution in Gurgaon ...,"I'm in my late 20s. 

When I first moved to Gurgaon, all I cared about was making it.

And when I finally did, bought the Merc, moved into a nice place, and suddenly, I was supposed to be happy, right?

But here's the thing: I didn't really think much about things like pollution or work-life balance at the time. I was busy with the grind: the hustle that promised to get me somewhere bigger and better.

Back then, traffic was just part of the deal. The air was just..umm..air. Like the heat in the summer or the noise of construction sites. It didn't seem like a big deal because, well, I had bigger things to focus on. Survival. Stability. That dream life.

But then, after checking off the milestones, you start noticing the things you didn’t before. You realize that maybe there are bigger problems than finding the best coffee shop or choosing which gym to go to. Suddenly, the air doesn't just feel like background noise, it's almost suffocating. You start checking AQI levels before leaving the house, wearing a mask on the daily, and wondering why no one else seems to care.

And let's be real, it's not like pollution is some new issue. It's been here all along. But now, with the pressure of keeping up with the hustle gone, you have the luxury of caring about the things you couldn't before. You have the time to wonder why you're stuck in the middle of a city that feels like it's slowly choking and why no one's doing anything about it.

So, maybe this is just how we work. We pay attention to what we can. And when we’ve got everything else in place, we start paying attention to the things we couldn't afford to care about before.",6,1762582927.0,gurgaon,13,1.0,False
1ori5s1,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1ori5s1/help_adding_a_little_sauce_to_an_aspect_of_my/,Help adding a little sauce to an aspect of my magic system?,"Hey y'all, I'm trying to add some sauce to one of the aspects of my magic system and I'd love to see others ideas or suggestions.

First I need to explain some of the core aspects of my magic system, I'll do them in bullet points to make it brief:

-When a lot of negative emotions surround a thing (eg: phisical object, concept, fictional character, phisical place, etc.) the negative energy that this produces can birth a type of monster called execration


-Execrations are most commonly somewhat incarnations of whatever thing the negative emotions were targeted towards

-Some people can develop a type of ability called an Expression via projecting a piece of their soul unto reality

-Expressions can range from an elemental manipulation to very complex abilities

And now the part I want to add sauce to:

-When a user of an expression encounters an execration that is conceptually extremely close or identical to their ability (eg: someone with an extremely developed version of ""air manipulation"" encounters the execration born of the fear of the sky) they're able to ""absorb it into their expression"" as long as they're able to defeat it in a 1v1 combat

-when an execration is ""absorbed"" they cannot be born again no matter what, at least until the user of the expression they're absorbed into dies.

The problem is that right now I dont have any repercusions follow the Expression user after absorbing an execration, and I want there to be, since absorbing an execration also means no one else having to deal with that execration anymore the act of absorbing is seen as ***extremely*** valuable or respected so there being a consequence to it I feel would make it feel more ""sacrificial"" instead of just ""Well I'm glad we're done with this one, wanna go grab coffee?""",2,1762582876.0,worldbuilding,0,1.0,False
1ori4lu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1ori4lu/just_here_to_rant/,Just here to rant,"Context: I’ve been a mom for 18 months and I always reach out to any woman I know who gets pregnant now. I never knew it was so hard to make new mom friends until I got pregnant. So I’ve made it my mission to make every new mother I know feel like they at least have someone on their side.

I generally let them know I have some extra baby supplies and I’m up all hours too so if they need someone to call at 1am I’m there. Sometimes I invite them out for walks etc. I offer to make them meals after the baby comes or come over to do chores if needed, maybe just a shoulder to cry on or maybe our kids can be friends one day!

I’ve had plenty of people be rude to me over this, they answer my initial text very coldly like “thanks” or not at all, and that’s fine. I never mind because I know it can be overwhelming.


I reached out to a girl recently who had no friends in the country, she’s not from here and got pregnant by a friend of mine so I thought I’d offer to introduce her to my group of mom friends etc. We got coffee and things went really well! She was having a hard time and was very receptive to the support. I thought I made a new friend!


A few weeks later, I invited her to Trick or Treat with our group. She said she probably couldn’t make it so I said no problem girl let’s get together soon 😁 She then texted me AGAIN saying she has panic attacks when she sees anyone in a mask or makeup or dressed up at all. I thought that was strange since we already talked about her not coming AND why does that stress you out so bad.. but okay girl lol no problem! 

She then asked ME if I wanted to make plans for the next day so we did. She canceled them last minute but I know how it is idc 🤷🏼‍♀️ I said take all the time you can to yourself girl you need it before your baby gets here lol!


She posted a ton of photos of trick or treating with her man and her costume and stuff.. I was surprised since she made up such a crazy excuse not to come when I obviously had no problem but it’s all good, I just won’t invite her to things anymore I can take a hint 😌


I went to show her post to my fiance the next day and she had blocked me 😭😭 now I’m actually upset and my feelings are hurt, I would’ve given a lot for anyone to reach out to me when I was pregnant. Postpartum can be so lonely and I’m so confused why it’s hard to just be kind. We don’t have to be friends girl lol 🤦🏼‍♀️ like I said, just ranting. ",1,1762582767.0,Mommit,0,1.0,False
