# Story:

Welcome to the New World

It began with a light in the sky. Then a crack.
All around the globe, fissures shimmered into being—rents in space shaped like whirlpools of starlight.
We called them Portals.

No one knew where they came from, only that stepping through one meant entering a world not our own—a world crawling with Monsters, ancient ruins, and untamed magic. At first, they were isolated incidents. But within months, the borders between Earth and this Otherworld began to bleed into each other. Cities collapsed. Wild magic seeped into the air, into the ground—into us.

And from that chaos… some of us Awakened.


---

Awakeners and Their Roles

The Awakened are people touched by mana—changed by the Otherworld’s raw energies. Some gained the strength to crush steel with their bare hands. Others learned to call down fire, manipulate shadows, or summon barriers that could halt bullets.

These Awakeners are broadly classified into three roles:

Strikers: Swift, deadly combatants who excel in close quarters. Think fists, blades, and devastating martial magic.

Mages: Casters who wield mana like a sculptor wields clay—unleashing elemental fury, healing allies, or distorting space itself.

Vanguards: The frontline. Titans of endurance who draw enemy attention and shield their allies with armor, magic, or sheer force of will.


Each Awakener is ranked by Tier, from F to S:

F-Tier: Barely awakened—humans with a flicker of mana.

E to B-Tier: Professional-level Awakeners capable of clearing lower-tier dungeons or leading small teams.

A-Tier: Strategic-level threats—strong enough to level buildings.

S-Tier: National-level forces. Few in number. Capable of battling entire armies—or worse.



---
ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ The New Age: Guilds and Magic Markets

As society struggled to adapt, new institutions rose to meet the challenge.

Guilds formed—organizations of Awakeners banded together for protection, profit, or purpose. Some serve governments. Others operate independently. All compete for influence, dungeon rights, and magical resources.

Magic Item Shops, once the stuff of fantasy, now line certain city blocks—selling enchanted weapons, armor, potions, and tools crafted from monster parts or forged through arcane rituals.

Governments scrambled to regulate magic. Corporations began investing in dungeons. Churches claimed the Portals were divine judgment. Conspiracy theories blossomed like weeds.

But one thing was certain:

The world as we knew it… was gone.
And a new one—filled with monsters, miracles, and mystery—had taken its place.

# The New Races

When mana first flowed into our world, it didn’t just change the rules of physics—it rewrote the very code of life.

Some humans began to mutate, their bodies reshaped by ambient magic, slowly transforming into beings with monstrous features—fangs, claws, scaled skin, animalistic senses. Others were born to parents exposed to high concentrations of magic, their children different from birth. Meanwhile, portals continued to open… and from them came sentient monsters—creatures from the Otherworld with minds, cultures, and desires of their own.

Over time, unions formed—sometimes through peace, sometimes through necessity, sometimes through love. And so, new races emerged. We call them Demi-Humans, Hybrids, or simply the Newfolk.

What was once fiction—elves, orcs, dragonkin, tieflings, and more—became reality.

Today, they walk among us:

A tiefling barista who can heat coffee with her fingertips.

An orc firefighter shrugging off flames.

A half-elf mage delivering arcane packages across the city.


They’re citizens, heroes, rogues, and rivals.
And though old prejudices sometimes linger, most of the world has long since accepted this new normal.

After all, in a world of monsters, dungeons, and god-tier sorcery—being part-dragon is hardly the strangest thing in your neighborhood.

# Faith and Flame: Religion in the Age of Magic

When mana bled into our world, it did more than awaken bodies—it stirred souls.

Suddenly, prayers had weight. Rituals sparked fire. Symbols glowed with power.
And people began to ask: Was this magic… or was it divine?

Religious movements exploded across the globe. Some were new, founded on modern interpretations of magic and destiny. Others were old, clawing their way out of history’s dust.
The Norse pantheon saw a brutal revival—Odin-worshipping warriors now empowered by actual lightning. Egyptian cults, once dead as their pharaohs, returned with clerics calling down the sun’s wrath in Ra’s name.

Then there are the Zealborn—Awakeners who claim their powers are divine gifts, their bodies temples, their missions sacred. Some heal. Some smite. All are feared and revered in equal measure.

But not everyone is convinced.

Skeptics, scientists, and mage-theorists argue that this “divinity” is simply another form of awakened magic—a self-induced placebo effect where belief sharpens mana. To them, “gods” are just thoughtforms—dreams powerful enough to cast spells.

And yet… there are temples that float above the ground.
There are miracles that defy known mana physics.
There are whispers of beings answering prayers from beyond the stars.

So the world debates:

Are gods real?
Or have we simply become them?




Anyway, if you got this far, just message me, there are some obvious references to Solo leveling here as the dm does themes, if you like that come on in. Just comment and I’ll message ya, there are triggers as he’s going by Invincible level of story instead of solo leveling. Anyway hope to see a new hunter in the modern world.

I'd like to try to make one of the conditions of our post-divorce arrangements that she goes to legitimate mental health counseling of some sort, but part of me wonders if there's even a point in trying.  She'll fight it, no doubt, and it could just make her dig in her heels on other things even harder and/or get even more vindictive towards me, which I'm  sure will be part of this.  Personally, I don't wish her any ill will.  She direly needs help, and she's going to remain involved in my kids lives whether I like it or not.

Anyone have any experience with this?  Is it worth pursuing?  Or just get out, let her be, and try to get my kids for as much time as I can manage?

(For reference, she's into just about everything.  End times, MAGA, MAHA, antivax, chem trails, red light therapy, coffee enemas, etc.)",1,1747951736.0,QAnonCasualties,2,1.0,False
1kt3fiy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kt3fiy,Step by step,"I know I know. That blade grinder needs to go. It's what I have for the moment tho, and kinda did something, as I got some stuff out of 17g of the coffee I like. 

I got a coffee scale, $25, good enough, so I could time my extractions and weight my pour, something I've never done. I'll stick to the kinda normal 1:2 ratio for the moment. Very interesting to my older workflow, as I just eyeballed everything. 

The machine is the improvement here, a Delonghi ECP3220 (Facebook market, came to $100). Coming from my IMUSA, a kinda-better-than-a-mokkapot 4bar machine, instant difference is felt. The coffee that I just got tastes different. Better.

Due to my budget, I was resigned to use the pressurized filters that come with the Delonghi, but I wanted to try and use a non pressurized one, so I removed the plastic support on the PF, and used the IMUSA non pressurized filter. It fits ! 
I gotta think how to plug the screw hole, but I can surely do with this. 

Obvious next upgrade would be a grinder. I'm inclining myself for the DF64 v2, or going lower, to the DF54. I think those will serve me well. 

Thing is, here in Guatemala, either very wealthy people have very expensive stuff, or you can't find anything else. I was lucky to find this Delonghi, and there are close to no market for budget grinders. But I'll keep looking. 

Anyway, I'm happy to find a way to enjoy this hobby at my budget level. Yes yes, grinder next. But I'm going there. :')",1,1747951649.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1kt3e1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1kt3e1v/am_i_a_repressed_lesbian_or_on_the_ace_aro/,Am I a repressed lesbian or on the ace / aro spectrum,"Am I a repressed lesbian or a repressed ace / aro person: I am 25 female and this is my experience am I a late bloomer ( straight) or on the ace/ aro spectrum: this is my experience, I am 25 female, am I on the ace/ aro spectrum or a late bloomer according to my therapist if they were to label  ( take everything into account and be honest) 



I had a long time with no crushes (childhood, highschool, college, university and work) even though I explained the context (childhood very young so does not count) highschool (all girls no boys and wasn't independent enough to take public transport, college first sixth form  = all girls, second school co mixed with boys and girls but didn't interact with them I just focused on my coursework I didn't say hi and I only went twice a week, third college = had a male friend, even gave him a rose for fun didn't interact as much, did try to speak in Urdu but I am not fluent, I don't know why he wouldn't flirt with me for once but I didn't mind it as much, university I had a friend that was  my lab partner and my assignment partner then covid came and I took japanese online I was more concerned about learning japanese and didn't interact wirh my classmates as much out of class except on Whatsapp about japanese class, anime club I didn't interact on discord except once that was it then there was the pandemic and when I was a senior PAL leader it was business. Job courses, spear camden I had friends but I didn't interact with them during breaks I sat alone on my phone, Art classes = I was waiting for class not interacting with anyone before or after class. Spark change: I didn't talk to many friend outside the job courses just mundane topics otherwise I didn't interact as much and about the comic guy I asked an assitant to talk to him because of his comics and I was too shy to talk to him myself. Work waited for brief with occasional talks but not much now that I think about I did talk about FMA once with my co worker but not attraction but other than that and important stuff I just sketch away or do something else not engaging as much as I did not even when I went swimming even. Even in physiotherapy I was comfortable with my therapists and even had group therapy but nothing (I was  12 – 13). Girl Guides no crush but I did not interact. 



Part 2: The Trigger I was planning to read BL, but I didn’t want to be misogynistic, so I decided to explore other perspectives. That’s when I came across an autobiography manga written by a lesbian. I related to some of the things in the book like never having a crush on boys before and it made me panic—what if I was lesbian too? I didn’t even finish the manga, but the thought spiraled out of control. To reassure myself, I started looking up why lesbians love women and their kinks on Quora. Then, I read a GL manga (Asumi-chan is Interested in Lesbian Brothels), and while I liked the story,  made me even more anxious. That’s when things got worse. I started looking at: Book covers of GL manga YouTube videos of women kissing Celebrities in sexy outfits Yuri porn on r34 AI girlfriend chatbots Lesbian dating apps I kept having intrusive thoughts about kissing or having sex with women just to “confirm” my orientation. I went down a rabbit hole, searching for answers on Reddit and Quora. My sister told me that sexuality is fluid, but then I saw other posts saying that’s a homophobic statement, and it confused me even more. I’m Muslim, so there could be societal pressure involved, but I’ve been deeply depressed—sometimes to the brink of tears. I’ve lost interest in drawing, learning Japanese, and my other hobbies. I don’t even care about men or relationships anymore. My entire routine is falling apart, and I feel like I’m losing myself. At first, I was having intrusive thoughts mainly at night, but then I started feeling “excited” by them—like I had an urge to smile, which terrified me. Sometimes, I felt indifferent, and that scared me even more. One time, I had an intrusive thought about kissing my friend, and I broke down crying in the surgery. Some of my thoughts felt so real—marrying women, kissing them in bikinis, touching them—and I couldn’t tell if they were intrusive or genuine anymore. I started testing myself: Looking up sexy pictures of women to see if I’d react Watching MasterChef Canada and noticing urges towards female contestants Watching Mr. Bean and feeling relief because the thoughts went away Doing online quizzes (like Wikihow’s “Am I a Lesbian?” quiz), which made me more anxious My therapist said I might have OCD, but that uncertainty made me panic. What if I don’t? What if I’m just in denial? I just want my old life back. If I stop these compulsions, will the thoughts go away? 



 



 Part 3: Am I Asexual? Aromantic? More Doubts Now, I’ve been on Citalopram (10mg) for two weeks, and my emotions feel weird. Before taking the medication, I had an intrusive thought about whether I’d ever be able to marry. I went to a sailor moon concert with sis and mother, on the train my anxiety around women was better but there was still some hyperfixation (I stared at women and men for testing) anyway at the concert I avoided the female performers and hyperfocused on the male one. Anyway after the concert I had my journal to record my thoughts for an exercise my therapist recommended. Anyway, I had intrusive thoughts of fearing losing attraction to men, fearing never finding love and wanting a relationship like the manga. Afterwards, my sis hugged me goodbye and I was checking my heartbeat to see if I was attracted to her and then I cried on the train, had dreams of the concert and cried again about my intrusive thoughts. Anyway fast forward, I was going to my father's appointment and I researched why I didn't have a crush then read about asexuality and I panicked. Once I got home I looked at more asexuality forums and panicked and cried about not experiencing a crush or having a relationship.  



 Am I ace? Am I aromantic? I feel like I’ve lost all control over my thoughts and emotions. I’m either anxious, indifferent, or feeling something that makes me uncomfortable. Am I desensitized? Am I actually into women? Is this just HOCD? I don’t know who I am anymore, and I just want to feel normal again. If anyone has gone through something similar, please help. I’m exhausted. I asked Chatgpt, Deepseek , and Pi ai about it and they give me different answers depending on the situation e.g. sometimes chatgpt says that just because you don't have a crush, it doesn't mean you are ace or aro and I could be a late bloomer but other times it says I am ace or aro because I didn't experience a crush before. Deepseek on the other hand, keeps saying I am a late bloomer regardless of what I say so I don't know.I just had intrusive thoughts after reading forums about the fear of never finding love, never being in a relationship, fearing being on the asexual spectrum and I started crying. My parents yelled at me about it. 



 



 Recently I had intrusive thoughts about men. The first intrusive thoughts were in the shower. One intrusive thoughts was meeting random men and feeling nothing and another was about meeting my male friend at college where he flirted with me and I smiled a bit but I gagged and I worried if I lost attraction to men. I also had dreams or thoughts about intimacy and sex where I often what it was like cuddling or feeling mens' bodies or having sex with men and wondering what it would feel like to have sex or to feel their bodies. I would smile faintly and I would feel butterflies in some instances but it is not consistent. One dream was about a faceless man having sex with me, my heart was beating slightly and my chest was warm but my throat was burning but not much. I would also wonder what sex would feel like (penis into my vagina). I sometimes searched up sexy men to see if I was attracted to them sometimes faint butterflies in stomach and smiling. I have taken citalopram for 4 weeks and I wonder if I am asexual or if I am a late bloomer? I also had some pulls when I imagined relationships with men Update 1: I started getting urges (like hyper fixation) towards women. I don't understand, it was getting better with anti-depressants early on and now it was briefly back? Does this mean anything? It would switch back to intrusive thoughts about being on the asexuality spectrum. I spoke about crushes with my mother and wondering if I she remembered I had any and she said I found some boys cute or good looking when I was in primary school (I don't remember). I cried in therapy a bit. When I was volunteering, I spoke to my male colleague about star signs and I felt a bit giddy when after our conversation. It did linger a bit. In the evening, I had a massive headache and I even vomited. Finally I had a conversation with sis about having intrusive thoughts about being on the asexuality spectrum and I started crying while we had our conversation. Am I on the asexual or aromantic spectrum or lesbian in denial or a late bloomer? Fast forward to my therapy session, I asked my mother about whether I had crushes on boys when I was younger. She told me that I did say some boys were good looking in primary school but I don't remember. This caused me to cry during my therapy session and in the afternoon after consulting Chatgpt about it. Eventually, I relaxed a bit and then my urges for women returned. On Thursday, I was so distressed when Chatgpt told me I was attracted to women that I cried and didn't go volunteering. On Friday, I went out with my mother, with my urges for women. After some tea, my urges for women went then I was worried about being on the asexuality spectrum so I consulted Chatgpt again and when it said I was, I cried again. Last night, I had dreams of men and kissing them and having sex with them and I was aroused and there were butterflies then I got the thought of researching a lesbian chef and my urges for women came back, then after a while I began to feel asexual again. I had my therapy session again and realised I had a case of FOMO, as in I wanted to experience what my family experienced and the fact that I will never know made me lose it and I was pretty during and after the session and now I feel asexual again. I cried about experiencing FOMO and even when considering the possibility of being asexual, I still cried in the shower and in the bathroom? I don't know what is going on. I have been on 10mg citalopram for 7 weeks. Am I a late bloomer or on the ace / aro spectrum? Last night, I had dreams of men and kissing them and having sex with them and I was aroused and there were butterflies then I got the thought of researching a lesbian chef and my urges for women came back, then after a while I began to feel asexual again. I had my therapy session again and realised I had a case of FOMO, as in I wanted to experience what my family experienced and the fact that I will never know made me lose it and I was pretty during and after the session and now I feel asexual again. I cried about experiencing FOMO and even when considering the possibility of being asexual, I still cried in the shower and in the bathroom? I chat with AI and when it suggested I was on the ace / aro spectrum I cried .  



 



One time I once thought if I am at least demi or gray ace, I could at least experience attraction to men but i still cried. After searching on AI if I was on the ace / aro spectrum and it said I was, I was depressed and when I told my mother I cried about it. After the korean BBQ, my mind was like I enjoyed myself so I am on the ace / aro spectrum and I cried again. I don't know what is going on. I have been on 10mg citalopram for 8 weeks. Am I a late bloomer or on the ace / aro spectrum? I went to Tim Horton and one time I had a dream of being younger 16 and not on anti depressants and feeling a pull to K pop stars even though I did not listen to k pop or cared about it. Another dream was the sailor moon concert but I was younger 16 and not on anti depressants and I had a pull on the male lead even though I had only seen the sailor moon concert once in february. I stopped using AI last night, the next morning and a bit of the afternoon (until now) and these were my thoughts: 1) what if my desire for men was fake 2) what if I am lying to myself 3) what if my lack of crushes were due to lack of desire and not lack of interaction 4) What if AI is right (and I am asexual)5) what if I am crying to be like everyone else6) what if my distress is due to fitting in 7) can late bloomers experience no crushes or FOMO due to my reasons 8) If I was straight, why didn't I have a crush 9) if I was on the ace / aro spectrum why am I crying about my lack of crushes and the possibility of being on the spectrum,9)Do late bloomers cry about being on the ace / aro spectrum. Are my tears due to medication or are they my true desires.10) I cried myself to sleep last night 11) I had intrusive thoughts and woke up in tears 12) I feel better am I asexual 13) What if after my AD I still don't have attraction 14) I don't mind being ace / aro if it was accepted but I still want a relationship 15)FOMO, Fear of loneliness, want to experience connection and intimacy want romantic love. 16) I cried then slept then woke up and cried then slept then woke up and cried and slept. 17) now I feel fine but I want answers 18) I held my father's hand and cried I imagined kissing a guy and criedcan I share the rest of what I wrote before you say anything: 19) I don't think I have the potential for relationships 20) I think I am delusional 21) I am starting to think I am on the ace / aro spectrum 22) I have nothing but a book and a pen and I am still crying about not experiencing relationships 23) I am crying about accepting that I might be asexual (this while SIU by materu is playing in my head) 24) I want a relationship I want a relationship I want a relationship 25) This is with nothing (no chatgpt or ai or anything) just me and I am still crying does that mean this is genuine does it mean I am on the ace / aro spectrum 26)I had a thought where I didn't mind being on the ace / aro spectrum or not I wanted a relationship 27) What if I will never experience a crush and what if I am delusional 28) why am I calm now were my feelings fake, 29) I am worried I am on the ace / aro spectrum 30) I am delusional aren't I 31) My father threatened to leave the house due to my crying 32) What if I am better off alone 33) I don't want to be alone, I want to be in a relationship 34) What if I won't like being in a relationship 35)I want my sex dreams with men back. It has been 9 weeks since citalopram and my sex dreams are not as frequent but I do still ask AI for help. One time I thought I was asexual and then when I thought what a relationship with a man was like I felt butterflies but when I held my father's hand again I felt tired. One time I saw pakistani cricket players and my heart was beating and my throat was burning. Sometimes when I think of the possibility of being on the ace / aro spectrum, my throat hurts like I am about to cry. Sometimes I play games and I don't think about the ace / aro spectrum or being attracted to men anymore but sometimes when I watch youtube I think about my relationship with men and I feel a emotional pull. 



 



At 10 weeks on citalopram I got very distressed when AI tell me I am on the ace / aro spectrum to the point of tears and I had dreams  and I wrote these thoughts and I cried while I wrote these thoughts as well: 1) AI is such a hypocrite, it tells me that a lack of of crushes doesn't mean I am on the ace / aro spectrum but it tells me that because I had opportunities to interact with men but didn't develop a crush I am asexual and I am starting to believe that it might be the case in the future 2) I never had a crush or worried about before so what is the point getting a crush now 3) Fine, I am on the ace / aro spectrum I am delusional because I have never had a crush I don't think I could start now. 4) I am delusional to think I would even be straight or I could have a crush 5) I give up 6) I don't want to be on the ace / aro spectrum but AI won't stop suggesting it, I feel like it is too late 7) Deepseek told me my feelings were due to FOMO or societal pressure rather than my personal feelings and I felt my pain was swept under the rug. What if deepseek is right?8) Fuck it, I am on the ace / aro spectrum my longing was I was delusional and my feelings were FOMO rather than my own feelings. 9) I wanted to at least try I give up 10) Is it worth persuing a relationship 11) Is my baseline on the ace / aro spectrum so my desires for love are fake. Why is love being gatekept by AI like if I don't have interest in relationships I am forever on the ace / aro spectrum 12) I don't want to have an ace / aro baseline 13) Do I have to have a crush beforehand to validate me being straight 14) AI tells me I have attraction to men but also my sex dreams while on citalopram does not mean I have attraction to men 15) I know what a breakup feels like, when I was 17 I cried on the sofa because I thought I didn't like Kaito's voice 15) My sister didn't understand my distress she didn't understand why I was distressed about being lesbian or on the ace / aro spectrum because I never dated and now looking back I feel like it can sound very invalidating 16) I want AI to rule out me being on the ace / aro spectrum but it won't and it is annoying 17) I give up I am delusional to I could be attracted to real men or be straight AI was right 18) I don't want to be on the ace / aro spectrum even if ace / aro people can experience love or romance, me sharing ace / aro traits and identity being personal and wondering if I would be okay with being on the ace / aro spectrum (I won't) I want to be attracted to men 19) Therapist is my attraction to men real 20) All I want to know is if I am attracted to men or if my desires were fake. 



 



It is going to be 11 weeks tomorrow and my thoughts are all over the place. I went shopping at Brent Cross and I had a weird thought in Holland and Barret's, thinking about how some women can't have children and they are distressed but they carry on and I was wondering if that is the same with me. Afterwards, I had another thought about wanting to be attracted to men and got jealous of women who were boy crazy. During my laser session, I thought at least I could have fictional men and is it worth persuing a real relationship and is it possible. I went on AI and I cried at the possibility of being on the ace / aro spectrum  



 



I went online to find a Kaito plushie so it can make me better but none of the vendors had international shipping so I decided to design and make a keychain and for the most part it distracted me for a bit. Also at my volunteering place my male colleague thanked me for the chocolates for his birthday and I smiiled but then I also felt butterflies and pulls for men until briefing started. Then at night, I had a thought of what if the feelings I had while on citalopram would disappear after the treatment and I am asexual so I asked AI about it and I still get hyperfixations for women as well. Am I genuinely on the ace / aro spectrum or bi or lesbian  in denial or not? 



 



AI is suggsting I am on ace / aro spectrum again and I am starting to wonder if it is due to social expectations or FOMO rather than my own feelings (AI think so). When AI said I was on the ace / aro spectrum I cried, deepseek said my pre OCD baseline was on the ace / aro spectrum . I wonder what my therapist will say.  



 



On wednesday I interacted with men in my temp job and I still did not have attraction I am on citalopram for nearly 12 weeks am I not attracted to men 



 



then on friday I imagined being with my male friend and I had pulls and some indifference and throat burning and then I thought about men in romantic scenarios and I dazed out a bit (not completely) 



 



I feel like a lesbian. I have urges for woman like pulls but I also gag at times as well, it started when I listened to Chappel Roan’s song good luck babe . It was a good song and catchy ( better than pink pony club) but I had a thought in my head: What if i am like the girl spoken about in the song and that I am lesbian/ ace and or aro and I was kissing boys and feeling nothing. Then during the journey to my temp work, I was wondering if I was wondering if I was in love with my best friend or any other girl I had a strong platonic relationship with but I gagged a bit. It was busy in the afternoon so I was distracted but while i was on toilet duty my mind wondered to other topics like wondering if I should read lesbian books but my mind was afraid to since I read an autobiography about a lesbian author and that spirals out of control, my Kaito keychain ( I have buy supplies ) and the thought of liking the smell of one of the students and the time I mistaked a reader for a student and then I caused an invigilator to trip and losing paperwork. After work I was thinking about the fact I couldn’t be straight due to the thoughts from earlier so I asked AI for answers and it said that because I had feelings for men and a genuine longing for them so my feelings for men are genuine and it said that I was unlikely to be lesbian/ ace/ aro . This morning, the same thing happened. I had urges for women and gagged ( also trumpets by Jason Derulo and Good luck babe by chappel roan was playing in my head and at this point I am wondering about my progression after \~ 12 weeks on citalopram: Lesbian = I do not want to be lesbian. I had urges but they feel awkward, ace / aro = I want to be attracted to men but Demi or gray ace is not the end of the world ( more Demi than gray ace) but none of the others. Straight = My preferred option but I don’t know if it is possible given my circumstances.  And now I have thoughts about kissing women again why do they keep coming back? Um afterwards, I didn’t have urges for women but my feelings for men disappeared and now I feel asexual or aromantic again ( I had iced coffee and was tired  and now I am thinking about trans by Gorillaz and thinking about noodle’s design and wondering if I was attracted to her ( I watched trans and I liked her design before my intrusive thoughts but I didn’t think I was attracted to her I think much of it afterwards? Am I on the ace / aro spectrum / lesbian in denial that I am not straight and my nightmare about losing attraction to men became true? It has been 12 weeks into taking citalopram. What would my therapist say about this? 



 



It has been 12 weeks since taking citalopram and honestly I give up. I had intrusive urges about being lesbian and now I am starting to feel asexual so I asked AI last night, it said I might be on the ace / aro spectrum and I tried to ask where and it gave me possibilities and then I went to sleep but I cried a bit in my sleep while thinking about all of the possibilities of being on the ace / aro spectrum by chatgpt, I promised my mother I wouldn't look at chatgpt on my phone (and I didn't) but I was thinking about last night since I dreamt of men but did not have much reaction (indifference) so I got my laptop and asked AI again with more arguing. I finished my breakfast and went back to my laptop. My mother came and told me to contact a few people to follow up on a job which I started doing. I released my routine has gone out of whack for the past 6 months, I decided to use AI to provide structure which my mother was angry about because I have overrelied on AI in the past on stupid things like determining whether or not I was attracted to men or if I was on the ace / aro spectrum and she told me I was wasting my time and not to rely on AI. I said that I wasn't relying on AI for my orientation anymore and I was just using it to sort routine out. She told me to stop relying on AI and use my brain to sort my routine but because it has been 6 months since my routine I needed to use chatgpt. Then my mother kept my laptop away from me and said my tears were crocodile tears. I told her they were not and her, my father (who wanted to take my vitamin tablets) and my sis didn't understand my problems. It ended with me going to my room in tears and my mother calling me stupid. What would my therapist say about all this 



 

Why do I still have urges for women even now and I am not distressed. My therapist said I might be a repressed lesbian and I panicked and searched up forums to confirm and I cried a bit. Then I had a meeting at my volunteering place to improve performance and we chatted about school and gcses I chatted as well but no attraction. Then I was thinking about making pillows and plushies from scratch. This means I can't be straight anymore right therapist?

Hey there! I'm 33 and based in Michigan. I’m mostly looking for long-term chat friends to build a genuine connection with — but I’m also open to seeing where things go if we click.

A little about me: I’ve got the whole “adulting” thing down pretty well — career, bills, responsibilities, etc. But when it comes to my personal life, I really appreciate a slower, quieter pace. I’m definitely more on the introverted side, but once I’m comfortable with someone, my silly and sarcastic side comes out a lot.

I don’t have kids but I’m open to them. I’m also not religious, in case that matters to you.

Some of my favorite things:

Watching sports (especially when there's a good game on)

Trash TV — the messier, the better

Reading (fiction, nonfiction, anything interesting)

Cooking (bonus if you like swapping recipes)

And of course... coffee. It's practically a personality trait at this point.

The iPhone was used in the photograph that focused mostly on representing all the objects with somewhat balanced focus, while I targeted a slightly more ""zoomed in"" look that only had one major area of focus in the other images.

And yes, I know that the reason why is because I haven't been maintaining a calorie defecit. It's been a huge struggle for me, because no matter how much I try and how badly I want it, I always end up giving into the hunger and eating at around maintenance.

  
I don't necessarily love calorie counting because I feel like it makes me more obsessive about what I eat and sometimes even makes me eat more, but I've been doing it diligently for over 3 months now. I should be eating under 2000, but I have been averaging closer to 2500. I weigh and track everything.

  
However, I went on vacation for a week and decided not to track my calories. I ate a lot. Whereas in a typical day some sugar in my coffee would be my main indulgence, I went all out. Cookies, pizza, ice cream, everything. In the back of my mind I was trying to prioritize health (ex. I still ate a lot of protein oats, fruit, and eggs like I typically do) and tried not to ever become super uncomfortably full, but I definitely ate past fullness and if I had to guess probably averaged close to 3000 calories a day everyday for the week.

  
I was also doing much less exercise. I got around 5k steps a day, as opposed to my usual 10k. I went to the gym maybe 2 or 3 times during the week, as opposed to my normal 5.

  
I was scared to step on the scale when I came back. But I weighed 2 lbs lower than my normal weight.

  
I know it's probably just water weight, especially because I was also drinking less water than normal.

  
But at least I didn't gain anything.

  
It makes me want to continue to not track, but obviously continuing to eat that much would not end well for me. It's just sad that doing the opposite of my healthy normal routines is what finally made some change in the scale.",1,1747951034.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

# 

Are you like me, a bit tired of those standard, uninspiring black and white QR codes? They do their job, sure, linking you to a website or a menu, but they don't exactly scream ""brand personality,"" do they? I’ve often thought that businesses pour so much effort into their branding – logos, colors, aesthetics – only to have it all stop short when it comes to their QR codes. It’s like a beautifully designed brochure with a generic, out-of-place stamp on it. This has been a particular frustration of mine, especially when I see businesses missing out on a prime opportunity to make every touchpoint count.

What if you could transform those dull squares into something that not only looks great but also works smarter for your business? That's the thought that led me to explore beyond the basic QR generators. I wanted something that could create QR codes that reflect brand identity while standing out and offering more than just a simple link. That’s when I discovered Qroq, and it’s genuinely changed how I view the potential of QR technology.

# Introduction to Qroq

QR codes have been around for a while now, and their utility is undeniable, especially in a world that’s increasingly contactless and digitally connected. From restaurant menus to marketing campaigns, they bridge the physical and digital worlds. But traditionally, they’ve been a bit…boring. Just a functional tool, not a branding opportunity.

Qroq is an advanced QR solution designed to change that. I see it as the QR upgrade that every business, big or small, has been waiting for. It’s a platform that lets you create smart, beautiful QR codes, AI-powered QR-Pages, business cards, and get in-depth tracking. It’s about making QR codes an integral part of your marketing and branding, not just an afterthought. For me, it’s about giving local businesses, and really any business, a much-needed QR upgrade that helps them get more scans, better insights, and ultimately, more profits.

# Key Features of Qroq

When I first dove into Qroq, I was impressed by the breadth of features, all aimed at making QR codes more effective and visually appealing. Here are some of the standouts for me:

* **Designer QR Codes:** This is where Qroq truly shines. You can say goodbye to the monotonous black and white. Qroq allows you to create custom design QRs with beautiful colors that match your brand. You can even incorporate custom dot designs and, importantly, put your logo right on your QR codes. This creates QR codes in your brand colors that truly pop.
* **Dynamic Code Capabilities:** This is a game-changer. With dynamic QR codes, you can change the content or link your QR code points to without having to reprint the QR code itself. Think about that – new promotions, updated menus, different landing pages – all managed without the hassle and cost of reprinting. This makes your QRs future-proof.
* **QR Landing Page Creation:** Qroq doesn’t just stop at the QR code; it helps you create what’s on the other side. You can make branded mobile pages – think QR landing pages, menus, profiles, video pages, sign-up forms, and more. There are dozens of templates for frequent uses like menus, profiles, v-cards, linktrees, and shopping links, making it incredibly versatile.
* **AI-Powered QR-Page Maker:** For those of us who aren't design wizards or copywriters, this feature is a lifesaver. You can create perfectly designed QR pages with high-quality copy in just one click using AI. This drastically reduces the time and effort needed to get a professional-looking landing page up and running.
* **Track & Grow with Deep Analytics:** Old-style QRs give you no clue about who’s scanning. Qroq provides deep analytics. You can know your prospects, analyze your campaigns, and find out who your real clients are by learning how your QRs are performing with data on who is scanning, from where, and when.
* **No-Skills-Required Approach:** One of my initial concerns was the learning curve, but Qroq is designed to be user-friendly. No design skills, no tech skills, and no hosting is required for the QR pages. It’s incredibly intuitive.

# Who Can Benefit from Qroq?

Honestly, I think almost any business or individual who uses QR codes can benefit from Qroq. The platform is versatile enough to cater to a wide range of needs.

* **Restaurants & Cafes:** QR menus are just the start. Contactless payments, loyalty program links, and feedback forms become much more engaging and branded.
* **Retail Stores:** Share coupons, detailed product information, in-store navigation aids, or gather customer feedback through attractive, trackable QRs.
* **Motels & Hospitality:** Think digital maps, contactless check-in processes, event schedules, and easy links for room service.
* **Clinics:** Patient check-in, links to medical records portals, appointment setting, or digital forms can all be streamlined.
* **Real Estate:** Provide property details, virtual tour links, and contact information instantly through a scan.
* **Educators:** Share study materials, take attendance, link to resources, or conduct surveys.
* **Consultants and Freelancers:** A dynamic QR code on your business card or digital signature can lead to a personalized profile page, showcasing your services and portfolio.
* **Marketing Professionals:** The tracking and analytics features are invaluable for measuring campaign effectiveness and understanding audience engagement.
* **Small Business Owners:** For those on a tighter budget, Qroq offers a powerful way to enhance marketing efforts without needing to hire expensive designers or developers.

The list goes on – from transporters and repair shops to salons, non-profits, fashion stores, legal providers, gyms, and travel agencies. If you use QRs, you can make them better with Qroq.

# Maximizing Profits with Qroq

Upgrading your QR codes isn't just about aesthetics; it's about driving real business results. I’ve seen how Qroq can directly contribute to maximizing profits in several ways:

* **Improved Brand Visibility and Recall:** When your QR code features your logo and brand colors, it stands out. It's not just another scannable box; it's an extension of your brand. This increased visibility leads to better brand recall, making customers more likely to remember and choose you.
* **Enhanced Customer Engagement:** Interactive QR pages created with Qroq offer a richer experience than a simple link. Whether it's a beautifully designed menu, a profile page with all your contact details, or a link-tree style page, you're providing more value and making it easier for customers to engage with you.
* **Trackable Marketing Campaigns:** This is a big one for me. Traditional QRs are a black box. Qroq's analytics let you see how many scans you're getting, who is scanning, from where, and even on what devices. This data is gold for understanding your audience, refining your marketing messages, and optimizing your campaigns for better conversion rates. You stop guessing and start making data-driven decisions.
* **Reduced Costs and Increased Efficiency:** The dynamic QR feature means you save money on reprinting every time a link changes. The AI page builder saves time and money on design and copywriting. This efficiency frees up resources that can be invested elsewhere in your business.

# Step-by-Step Guide to Using Qroq

Getting started with Qroq is straightforward. I found the platform intuitive, and I believe you will too.

1. **Account Setup:** Signing up is quick and easy, much like any other online service.
2. **Creating Your First QR Code:** Once you're in, creating a QR code is a simple process. You'll choose whether you want a static or dynamic QR code and input the destination (like a URL, contact details, etc.).
3. **Customization Options:** This is where the fun begins! You can:
   * Upload your logo to be featured in the center.
   * Choose from a wide palette of colors for the QR code elements, matching your brand.
   * Select different styles for the dots and even the corners of the QR code.
   * The system ensures your customized QR is still 100% readable.
4. **Generating Landing Pages (QR-Pages):** If you're using a dynamic QR, you can link it to a QR-Page created within Qroq.
   * You can use the AI QR-Page Maker by simply telling the AI what you want on the page. It generates the design and copy for you.
   * Alternatively, you can choose from dozens of ready-made templates for common uses like menus, profiles, v-cards, linktrees, etc.
   * Customize these pages with your content, images, and videos.
   * No hosting or domain name is required; Qroq hosts these pages for you.
5. **Publish and Track:** Once you're happy, publish your QR code and its associated page. Then, monitor the analytics to see how it's performing.

# My Beta Tester Experience

When I got early access to Qroq as a beta tester, I was keen to put it through its paces. My main goal was to see if it was genuinely easy to use for someone who isn't a hardcore techie and if the ""smart"" features really made a difference.

I started by creating a dynamic QR code for a hypothetical local coffee shop. I wanted to test the branded QR feature first. Uploading the shop's (fictional) logo and changing the QR code color to match its branding took literally minutes. The result was a QR code that looked professional and inviting, a far cry from the generic ones.

Next, I tackled the AI QR-Page Maker to create a simple digital menu. I provided a few prompts about the coffee shop's offerings and style, and the AI generated a surprisingly well-designed page with decent placeholder copy. I then tweaked it, added images, and linked it to the dynamic QR code. The best part? When I decided to ""change"" a menu item, I just edited the QR-Page and the dynamic QR code instantly pointed to the updated content. No reprinting!

The analytics dashboard was also a highlight. Seeing mock ""scans"" and their (simulated) locations and device types made me realize the power this gives to businesses for understanding their customer base. For me, the experience confirmed that Qroq isn't just about pretty QRs; it’s a comprehensive marketing tool that's accessible to everyone.

# Qroq Pricing Structure

The Telegraph might have an older/simpler breakdown.

# Advantages and Limitations

Like any tool, Qroq has its strong points and areas one might consider.

**Advantages:**

* **Stunning Customization:** The ability to brand QRs with logos, colors, and custom designs is a huge plus.
* **Dynamic QR Power:** Updating links without reprinting saves time, money, and effort.
* **Integrated QR Pages:** No need for separate hosting or complex web design for simple landing pages, menus, or profiles. The AI page-builder is a big help.
* **Actionable Analytics:** Understanding scan data helps optimize marketing.
* **Ease of Use:** The platform is designed for non-techies.
* **Cost-Effective (especially launch pricing):** The one-time payment options during launch are very attractive compared to subscription models.
* **Versatility:** Caters to a wide range of business needs and QR code types.

**Potential Considerations:**

* **Feature Overload for Some:** For someone needing only a very basic static QR, the full suite of features might feel like more than they need. However, the entry-level Elite option is quite focused.
* **Learning Curve for Advanced Features:** While generally easy, diving deep into all analytics or advanced page customizations might take a little time to master for complete beginners. But the support resources are there to help.

# Competitive Edge of Qroq

What sets Qroq apart from the myriad of free or basic QR generators? For me, it's several things:

* **Holistic QR Marketing Platform:** It’s not just a generator; it's a full system with QR creation, page building, and analytics.
* **Deep Branding:** Most free tools offer minimal, if any, branding. Qroq puts your brand front and center on the QR itself.
* **AI-Powered Page Creation:** This is a unique feature that dramatically simplifies creating effective landing pages for your QRs.
* **Dynamic Capabilities & Analytics:** Standard QRs are dumb and static. Qroq QRs are smart and adaptable.
* **One-Time Payment (Launch Special):** Many advanced QR platforms operate on a monthly subscription. Qroq’s launch offer provides lifetime access for a single payment, which is incredible value.

This level of assurance makes it easier to take the leap and try it out.

It’s ideal if you:

# Conclusion and Final Thoughts

For me, Qroq represents a significant step up from the basic QR code generators we’ve all used. It transforms QR codes from a purely utilitarian tool into a dynamic, branded, and measurable marketing asset. The ability to create visually appealing QRs, link them to custom mobile pages (even with AI assistance), and track their performance offers a comprehensive solution that many businesses will find invaluable.

The future of customer engagement is about making every interaction count, and Qroq empowers businesses to do just that with their QR codes. It’s about getting rid of the boring, dumb QRs and migrating to something pretty and smart. If you're ready to make your QRs work harder for you, Qroq is an investment I believe is well worth making, especially with the launch offers.

# Frequently Asked Questions

Here are some common questions I’ve seen about Qroq:

* **How does Qroq work?**Qroq is a powerful SAAS (Software as a Service) platform. You log in through your browser, and it provides tools to create, customize, and manage both static and dynamic QR codes. For dynamic codes, it also allows you to build and host simple landing pages and track scan analytics.
* **What can I do with Qroq?**You can create branded, colored QR codes with your logo. You can make dynamic QRs whose destination can be changed anytime. You can build QR landing pages (like menus, profiles, link-trees). You can track who scans your QRs, where, and when, to get better marketing insights.
* **Can I use these QR codes on both print and digital?**Yes, absolutely. The QR codes generated by Qroq are standard image files (like PNG or SVG) that can be used in printed materials (brochures, posters, business cards) and digital formats (websites, emails, social media).
* **Does it work on Mac?**Yes. Since Qroq is web-based, it works on any computer with a modern web browser, including Macs, Windows PCs, and Linux machines.
* **Are the QR codes standard?**Yes, the QR codes generated are fully standard. Despite the custom designs and colors, they adhere to QR code specifications and can be scanned by all common QR code reader apps and smartphone cameras.
* **But, will it be maintained?**Teknikforce, the company behind Qroq, has a history of maintaining and updating its software products. They state that Qroq will receive regular updates with new features. The launch offers also include 1 or 2 years of free upgrades, depending on the package.
* **Can I use it to work for other people’s businesses?**The Qroq Elite (front-end) version is typically for your own business use. To provide services to clients and use Qroq for their businesses, you'll need the Commercial License, which is included in the Qroq PRO upgrade and the All-Inclusive Deal.
* **Can it work on any device?**Qroq itself is best used on a computer for the full design and management interface. However, since it's web-based, you can access it on tablets and mobile phones too. The QR codes it generates can be scanned by any smartphone or tablet with QR scanning capability.

I’m Villette—your resident gothic makeup alchemist with over a decade of turning dark dreams into wearable looks. Today I’m sharing my signature “Veiled Beauty” approach: **sheer gothic makeup** that’s perfect for everyday wear. Whether you’re grabbing coffee or heading to a midweek meetup, these tips will help you rock that moody edge without looking overdone.

Why Sheer Gothic?  
By softening classic goth elements, you get a look that’s both mysterious and approachable. Think of it as wearing your favorite dark novel on your face—dramatic but never heavy.

Step-by-Step Veiled Beauty Routine  
1. **Prep & Prime**  
   • Double-cleanse, then lock in moisture with a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer.  
   • Apply a pore-blurring primer—this helps your sheer base glide on smoothly.  

2. **Light Gothic Base**  
   • Swap full-coverage foundation for a tinted moisturizer or BB/CC cream in a cool undertone.  
   • Use a damp sponge or fingers to stipple product, focusing on areas that need evening out. Less is more!  

3. **Subtle Contour & Highlight**  
   • Choose a taupe-grey cream contour to sculpt cheekbones without harsh lines. Blend upward for lift.  
   • Dust a finely-milled, pale highlighter on the high points—think cheekbones, brow bone, and cupid’s bow.  

4. **Soft Smoky Eyes**  
   • Start with a taupey-brown or muted plum eyeshadow all over the lid.  
   • Smudge a thin line of deep charcoal eyeliner along the upper lash line.  
   • Lightly blend out with a small brush for that lived-in, “veil” effect.  

5. **Brows & Lashes**  
   • Fill brows with a cool-toned pencil, using short strokes to mimic hair.  
   • Finish with a single coat of lengthening mascara—skip the drama and go for separation.  

6. **Sheer Lip Tint**  
   • Mix a dot of dark lip pigment with clear balm for a custom sheer stain.  
   • Gently press onto lips with your finger for a soft, diffused look.  

Pro Tips From My Studio  
• Multi-tasking products are your BFF—cream blush makes an amazing eyeshadow base, too.  
• Layer textures (matte + satin) to add dimension without adding bulk.  
• Keep cotton swabs and a tiny jar of setting powder in your bag for midday touch-ups.

It’s a beautiful place with an amazing outdoorsy lifestyle which I really enjoy, but socially it’s been tough to connect with others in their mid-to-late 20s. Most of my community has come through running groups, but other activities I’ve tried—like hikes, meetups, dancing, choir, art or cooking classes, visiting coffee shops, or walking around downtown—tend to be filled with college students, families, or older retired adults.

I’ve also noticed (and census demographics data seems to back this up) that the gender ratio in the 22–29 age range is quite skewed, which has made dating difficult as a man. More broadly, it feels like people can be too focused on their next outdoor adventure to make time for casual socializing or plans.

I’ve often heard the suggestion to move to Denver for a better scene of young professionals. As an introvert I like the small town vibe here in Boulder, but maybe trying out urban living in Denver is worth it.

It's going to be a long one.   
  
I'm posting this here, because I don't want it skimmed over as clip-attention-span people usually do and thus misinterpreted.   
I realize that there are more people lurking than the number subscribed, and I don't even now the list of members of this channel - for some reason instagram doesn't consider it necessary for the channel creator to see the list of members.   
But it's still better than just putting it out there in a post (shrinking it to 2200 characters and losing significant portions of the point) or even worse - facebook. Facebook is just depressing in terms of what people are writing over there.   
So I'm hoping those who are here and those who bother enough to come check it out, will at least read the whole thing, not skim it.  
  
I've come across this song/video some time ago, and it struck a chord. This - this is everything I'm afraid of. Some of it has been happening for a while already.   
I know this is probably not the kind of music you like, but I'm not sharing it for you to enjoy. It's here for you to watch and to listen.   
I could've just posted the lyrics, yes. But paired with the visuals they're much more... *impactful*.  
  
Obviously, it's a **hyperbole**. Some of it. Some of it is sadly day-to-day truth.  
  
At first I wanted to make a reel out of it. You know, take the parts of the video that are relevant and pair them with documented pieces of Sam's reality. But I abandoned this idea.   
There are lots of things that are hard to pull off, like cutting the video without losing relevant parts, keeping the song intact-ish, and all of that under 90 seconds limit... also meta could very well mute it as it sometimes does due to copyright or whatever.  
  
But most importantly? I know that there would be a number of people who'd see it as victimizing Sam. Or even worse - victimize him themselves.   
And I just couldn't risk that, because it couldn't be further from the truth. He's a fighter, a survivor, **not** a victim: he's lived with all the shit for a decade, haven't gone insane or become a misanthrope (I think, lol), and that's just a portion of strength that man possesses.   
  
But him being able to cope with it *doesn't make it okay -* to treat him - or any celebrity for that matter - the way he's treated. Or any person, really.  
Obviously, I see him the most, but over the years I've seen some of the same shit happening to others. Affecting them in different ways. Some - very, very unpleasant.  
  
I'm not a saint; I've done my share of shit, because I just didn't realize what I was doing. Following Sam's journey has opened my eyes to many things, and hopefully made me a better person.   
I'm still learning from him and from everything around him that is visible.   
And I'm still making mistakes, but Rome wasn't built overnight.   
  
I also understand that some people are just not good at reading facial cues, picking up on subtle things and stuff.   
Some just don't give a shit, like those who come from the logic of 'I paid - they owe me'.   
But if this motivates someone - even a few people - to look closer, maybe give another thought to what they're *actually* doing and saying, I'll consider it a win.   
  
We're all biased, it's just how human brain works. If you google it, there's a list of biases that is like two dozen points.   
**TWO DOZEN THINGS THAT ALTER OUR PERCEPTION WITHOUT US REALIZING IT.** They're subconscious.   
But it's not impossible to learn to *notice* them. In oneself, in others. And slowly work to reduce them and eliminate them - at least some. Or at least control them.   
  
We also see everything through the prism of our personal experiences, things we know and seen with our own eyes. One of the biases - believing that that actually counts for something.   
Well it doesn't - if one doesn't know/understand something - it doesn't mean that something isn't real. It's just beyond that person's scope of personal experience. And that's fine - as long as they control their bias of denying the reality of anything and everything they haven't lived through themselves.   
  
This is a good time to explain why I **don't** consider myself Sam's fan.   
I am a fan of many things - a football team, a particular sort of coffee, a delicious dish, books, music, movies.   
But that's *superficial*: I enjoy them, but I don't care about them personally.   
Caring for a person - if one sees them as a person that is - is a completely different thing. It's *a human being caring about another human being*. Different level of engagement.  
That's my take on it, take it or leave it.   
  
And Sam isn't the only celebrity I care about; I love learning about interesting people, and them being celebrities matters to me just about as much as if they were plumbers, teachers or in any other profession. To me, people are who they are, not what they do for a living.   
  
When people open up - or it's possible to see through the defenses - it sometimes shows incredibly fascinating human beings, and it's just impossible for me not to care about them.   
  
Like I said, following Sam's journey made me rethink lots of things. Including the ethical side of my people-watching. I've been at it for two decades, and well... practice makes perfect.   
And even though I've never crossed any lines - haven't stalked, hacked or anything like that, just used publicly available stuff and my own perception - I still feel guilty about seeing him.   
Not because I don't like what I see (obviously, the opposite) - but because it feels *intrusive towards him*: I see him not because I was trusted and shown what I'm seeing - but just because I've been basically training myself for two decades. It feels wrong, because he didn't have a say in that.   
And it is beyond wrong to share my observations. I know that now.  
Well, enough about me.   
  
Back to the topic.  
  
Another plague is projection, a person thinking that everybody else thinks the way they do, feels the way they do, and condemning those who don't, stupid, 'bad' or whatever.   
Also there's a catastrophic matter of 'I would like/dislike this being done to me' being considered to be a valid reason to do/not do something to other people. **Bias.**   
People are different, and what's good for one is terrible for another. And vice versa. The solution here? Being respectful of each other's boundaries, and *learning them before overstepping them*. Or adjusting, if later. **Not judging when not understanding**. (That's where all the mental health and emotional abuse comes in).   
I know that most mean well; it doesn't mean that's how it ends up to affect the intended recipient. Absolutely **not** necessarily.   
  
So... please, watch the video, listen to the lyrics and think about your choices regarding the celebrities. They're people - just like and me.   
  
If you've gotten to this point - thanks. Please let me know what you think. ",1,1747950335.0,u_Sileas_Skye,0,1.0,False

I've been rejected before by girls who didn't like me or weren't into me romantically, but never by one who self-admittedly is so much into me it makes her shake! Really could use some advice.

For some context, I (M30) have been divorced for just over a year. During this time, I had asked this girl (27-year-old) out that I've been attracted to for years; we met briefly a year ago (too soon after my divorce), but after that she told me I reminded her too much of someone she'd rather not be reminded of, and subsequently refused my invitations to go out.

Last week, I again asked her out and she accepted. What initially a brief coffee date became a 5-hour date with drinks on a rooftop and later a drive through the city with her favorite music playing. It felt amazing, almost too good to be true. She was even more fascinating than I had thought, but really down to earth and fun too. She said the person I reminded her of was her ex-husband, whom she married when she was 18 and was for a year with.

Next day, I ended up asking her out for a walk. We walked, then ended up at my place and after a night of music, card games, and overall great conversation, we ended up making out in what was by FAR the best, most intense romantic moment of my life – and I've been in plenty of relationships. It didn't go any farther, but it was simply perfect. But she said we shouldn't be together, that it wouldn't work because she saw her ex's similarity too much in me. At the time, I told her I'd understand it if she refused to see me further, but said I'd still ask her out in a week.

Afterwards, she wrote me to ask what I was feeling and I, totally over the top, told her it had been the most beautiful moment of my life – which obviously she found overwhelming and said so. But she said it had been very good and thanked me for being gentle and understanding. 

Two days later, we exchange messages and she drops a hint she's going for a walk, I ask if she would like company... and again we end up at my place. We make out and exchange conversation. But then she tells me I'm the kind of person she's always attracted to (not sure what exactly, but I guess she was referring to my being too romantic and intense). She says she literally shakes when she's with me and she's just been studying this in her psychology courses, and the butterflies in her stomach are just a sign of her body that she's repeating an unhealthy pattern.

She says we mustn't meet again, she says she's sorry and I made her feel alive and she thought she ""could be human"" for a few days, but it'll end badly if we stay together, whether in a year or four. I try to tell her my counterpoint, but she asks me not to insist. She's really easily scared, has some deep anxiety, as she showed in several situations, and this seems to be triggering her in all the wrong ways. When I suggest we just meet without any romantic stuff for a while, she says ""but I WANT that with you, there's the problem"".

So after that I write her to tell her I won't bother her anymore, and she says she thinks I'm a brave man for being so open and she wishes me all the best.

I'm so totally in love at this point that it's hard to do anything but think of her, but I start coping the best way I can. Force myself to eat, work out, journal, reflect. Book a session with a psychologist. (The girl had told me: You can't like me so much without even knowing me; you need therapy and so do I.) Fast forward a few days, she posts a story about a concert tomorrow... it's a band she showed me, and today she had liked a story I posted of some flowers we had plucked together on our walk. So I decide to give it a shot, in spite of having previously decided to give it a month before contacting her again. I ask her out, but she says ""we can't go together...""

I guess at this point I'm really so hopeless. She sounds so adamant, but also she looked so much in love just a few days ago. The kissing was passionate and amazing. She complimented me a lot. She said it was great kissing, she felt alive, how attracted she was to me, etc. How can she shut down so fast? And do I have any hope?

What do you guys think? After having met someone so amazing and feeling an intensity I had only ever dreamed of, this now feels overwhelmingly hopeless. It's hard to make sense of her behavior – if she felt so much, how can she not want to give it a shot? Can I expect her to change her mind in due time, by giving her all the space now and only reinitiating contact in a month or more

Please tell me your honest thoughts. I'm so confused.",1,1747950008.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

1kt2ocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1kt2ocs/update_first_real_post_asking_for_advice/,Update: First real post asking for advice,"My wife and I have had several serious conversations regarding our lack of intimacy. I feel that I have consistently tried to show affection- trying to hold her hand, initiating hugs, caresses, and light non-passionate kisses. In several of these conversations she told me she doesn't understand what I mean or what I want. I've told her I want to start with hand holding, hugs, caresses etc. I told her I want her to initiate these, I don't want to be the only one initiating affection.  

After the first conversation, the next day she came up and asked me for a hug. I gave her a warm hug. Then for about a month, she didn't initiate anything again. I brought it up after that month and once again she seemed almost confused or unclear about what I'm asking from her. I reiterated- intimate non-sexual contact- affection. That night she came up to me before we went to bed and gave me a soft sweet good night kiss. I was hopeful this might continue. It didn't. Another month went by. During this time, I continued to randomly caress her, usually her shoulders or arms, stroke her hand when we were sitting across from each other at a meal, initiate hugs and kisses, once again light non-sexual kisses. On a couple of occasions we went for walks and I took her hand and we held hands as we walked.  During this time, once we were walking on a beach and I tried to hold her hand, she pulled away and made sure she was walking about 10 ft. behind me down the beach. Each time she dropped back, I stopped to wait for her. She would catch up, I would walk next to her and she would slow down and drop back again. I was really hurt by this. 

That evening I told her I was hurt that she once again wasn't showing any affection and that pulling away and staying back on that walk hurt my feelings. It degenerated into a fight. She told me she does all kinds of things for me: bakes cookies, makes meals I like, goes on our coffee dates and a number of other things. She doesn't understand what I want. She loves me and doesn't understand what she's supposed to do. I explained I don't want to her to be affectionate out of duty, I want her to want me and to want to be intimate with me. She replied that she's not a mind reader and I need to tell her what I want. She then told me I pulled away from her 20 years ago. I listened and told her I'm sorry for doing that. I think there is some truth to that. 

After this conversation, we both agreed we have to tell each other what we want, and not just expect it. The very next day, I asked her to sit with me on the couch to watch TV. She declined, saying she was busy. I was disappointed. I almost decided not to ask again. After thinking about it, I thought it's just one time and maybe thew timing wasn't good. I waited a few days and asked her to sit with me on the couch. She came over sat close and we cuddled for about an hour.  It's not much but to me it's a real step.

1kt2nvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dpdr/comments/1kt2nvp/1_year_progress_weedinduced_some_other_stuff/,[1 YEAR] Progress (weed-induced) + some other stuff,"Wanted to preface this by saying that though everyone's situation is unique, the persistence of recovery is not. It gets better, and you will find a way. I owe it to myself to share my story and help anyone I possibly can. I'm 80-90% of the way back. I can feel it.

**INTRODUCTION**

My DPDR was triggered by weed. I couldn't find a story or symptoms that matched mine so I struggled to even understand what I was going through (I had never dealt with anxiety or DPDR before in the slightest). The same trip that (I think) triggered it wasn't even bad (it was actually pretty fun). I didn't have a panic attack, and I went to sleep with everything as normal. Everything changed the next morning. I was confused, lost, and scared for the better part of the last year. I thought I'd fucked up, and messed up my brain permanently. I was weird and spaced out for many months. Terrible, awful memory. Did terribly in many of my classes and couldn't conceptualize anything (I'm a college student). Many of my relationships and friendships deteriorated. But I repaired them, and myself. It got better. I'm not back all the way, but I know I can be now. I see the light at the end of the tunnel.

**SYMPTOMS**

Many people kicked off their journey with DPDR and/or anxiety. Mine was a little different. For the first two weeks following my trigger, I was dizzy, lightheaded, had intense nausea, and air hunger. When those symptoms began to subside, the anxiety and DPDR kicked (later on) and it was intense. I had never felt anything like it before. Everything was weird, faces seemed off, I couldn't distinguish the background and foreground, and my words didn't feel like my own. I felt like my brain was empty, and when I spoke, and I didn't even understand what I was saying for a lot of the time. Even as I started to get better, my brain became extremely fogged and I couldn't hold on to information for a long time. I became EXTREMELY forgetful, and a lot of things just lost meaning to me. Lot of doom and gloom; some very awful days in between.

**THINGS THAT WORKED**

1. Time. The classic one; you just gotta ride it out. Fill your time with as many things as you can. If whatever you're doing is online (e.g. work, school, studying), try to do it at a cafe, or library surrounded by people. You'll eventually notice certain things make you forget about what you're going through. NOTE THOSE DOWN. Come back to them when you feel uneasy. In the simplest psychological terms (from my understanding), there is an chemical/hormonal imbalance. It will take time for your brain to re-adjust.

2. Diet + exercise. I already had a pretty good diet and went outdoors often but I didn't dedicate much time to exercise. I used to love running and I got back into it recently. I feel like I'm floating on air post-runs (runner's high). Combined with a cold shower, it helps MASSIVELY with regulating my anxiety and mind clarity. Go with a friend, go for a hike, do whatever exercise it is that helps. 

3. Supplements/substances. You'll see a lot of conflicting stuff on this and other subs. Something may work for some people, other stuff makes it worse. Keep in mind 1) you don't know what their situation is and 2) the degree of accuracy to which they're attributing successes or failures (i.e. do they actually know why something is happening?). In my opinion, try a lot! I experimented with a lot of supplements (separately; you don't want to mix and match without knowing the risks) and benefitted a lot. Whatever you choose to do, keep a journal or some consistent way of tracking your thoughts and feelings about it. It helps a lot to understand what may actually be helping you the most. Again, these are just my thoughts and I could fall victim to the very fallacy I just mentioned.

Lion's mane/mushroom complexes positively shifted my perspective massively. At the 2 week mark, I was overcome with a sense of ""possibility"" and things that eluded me before seemed so much more attainable. However I did feel more anxious around the 3 week mark. I stopped after that, perhaps its made to be cycled on.

Magic Mushrooms (psilocybin). Earlier on, when I was convinced they could help me get back to normal, I tried them (both macro and microdosing). Macro dosing (\~1.2gs & \~1.8gs) was actually the first time I'd felt completely normal in a while (no anxiety, no DR). It was a weird experience and I had to confront a good amount of emotions but the following day I returned back to a DR/Anxiety hell. What it did though, is it gave me hope that there was indeed a way back. Microdosing didn't do a lot for me, but I may have needed to do it for longer.

Ashwagandha made me calmer and did a lot for my anxiety. It also decreased my libido noticeably when I was alone, which I preferred TBH. Basically, I felt like I had control over my actions a lot more. However, ashwagandha is definitely the most beneficial when cycled on and off. I noticed some apathy after taking it for extended periods of time. This to be expected because it helps regulate cortisol (stress-related hormone) but we also need a threshold level of stress to be motivated to do things in our lives. Also my hair seemed thinner while taking it, but it may have been due to external stress.

CBD helped with anxiety and sleep. It increased my libido a LOT for some reason lol.

Lemon Balm was great. It was a more natural version of CBD, so I felt a lot more comfortable using it. I actually had a plant so I'd just pluck the leaves and boil them to make tea (you can also buy a dropper/tincture online). It's amazing for sleep (both in inducing and quality); I'd be knocked out in 30 minutes. It's also known for giving you extremely vivid dreams, which I experienced. Helped with anxiety too.

Electrolytes helped the feeling of drowsiness or lack of energy sometimes. If you know you haven't been eating a lot or getting a lot of vitamins, drink 1-2 packs every day for a week and see how you feel. They're also great after exercise and the safest out of all of the things I've mentioned. You can also try regular multivitamins.

Caffeine. This is the one by far I had the most exposure to. It's a bit tricky too because I had been drinking coffee everyday for the last 4 years. Earlier on, in an attempt to try everything, I went off coffee for a few weeks and noticed the general anxiety was a little better, but I would get equally anxious because I hadn't had coffee yet lol. Sometimes drinking coffee would make me lightheaded or dizzy too. I thought a lot of my anxiety could be attributed to excess adrenaline buildup, so I would balance coffee with exercise and that seemed to work.

Weed. This is the tricky one. I'm an idiot for even touching weed after all this, and I'm lucky that it didn't send me further down. I'll concede that it actually helps relieve the feeling of anxiety in my stomach all the time, but it exacerbates the DR a decent bit. If weed triggered it for you, I wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole. If you do, for some reason, decide to do it. Do very small amounts. A puff, or 2mg of an edible. 

Finally, medication. I was never on prescribed medication of any kind, mostly due to an ego where I thought I could do it on my own. Looking back, I may have benefitted from medication specifically for this. I didn't want to get hooked, or worse, risk making things irreversibly worse, but we are where we are. Weirdly though, when I got the flu in between all this, I took Tamiflu (oseltamivir) and had a EERILY similar experience to macrodosing on psilocybin. It was ODD. I confronted a lot of emotions and following that day, the DR went down significantly and I had the best two nights of sleep I'd had in many months. I still have no clue to do this day why that happened. I am 100% sure it was due to the medication.

4. Stressors. I saw people talking about eliminating stressors and triggers but where I struggled was applying that to my life. I took hard classes the year it hit, and it went horribly for me. Classes I hated and put in way too much work for. I alienated friends or family, when they actually would take my mind off things and help the most. Point being, if you know what stresses you out (whether it be work, school, certain people, or certain situations/trigger words), take the best effort you can to mitigate them. Take on a lighter workload, less classes, or distance yourself from people/trigger words. Take time off ideally if you can. For instance, I tended to experience DPDR in the dark, so I bought a night lamp lol.

**CURRENT DAY**

The DPDR is pretty much gone. Comes back in some instances but I can manage it. The thing that's annoying to deal with these days is the anxiety. Just a constant, dropping, sinking feeling in my stomach. I know it'll go. I just don't know when. Anyway, reach out to me for anything!

Today had some ups and downs, but overall? Just another groovy day here in Carlyle.

Morning Meltdown:
We kicked off the day with Google deciding to test everyone's stress levels. SSO apps? Nope. Everyone’s access? Gone. Cue total panic. The helpdesk lit up like a Christmas tree dipped in gasoline. We ended up hopping on a call with the SADA folks (they’re our middlemen with Google) to try and put out the fire. Crisis managed, eventually, but man—it was a rough start.

Midday Vibes:
Things smoothed out after the chaos. I think Justin’s been tossing me more of the simpler tickets lately, which is kind of a quiet nod of trust. Feels good. Also found out our team is gonna start answering phones for another company’s tickets starting at the end of the month. Basically, we’re turning into a proper help line. Not exactly thrilling, but hey—it means job security, and that’s nothing to complain about.

Big Maybe on a Big Property:
So here’s the twist—I found a house sitting on almost 20 acres. It’s $177K, which is more than I’d like to spend, but... it checks all the boxes. Like, every one. Still, we’ve got a few months left on this contract, and I’m not about to drop $800 a month on a place I’m not living in yet. But it’s hard not to daydream a little.

Water Filter Era Begins:
After work, Jaq and I hit Walmart and grabbed a water filter. Super curious to see how the taste stacks up against the bottled water we’ve been pounding through. Best case? It saves us some cash and our kidneys. I’ll take that win.

Current Mood:
Bumping “One of Those Days” by Lil Wyte. Not on my rapper Mount Rushmore or anything, but this one’s a banger when the vibe hits right.

Final Thought:
People get little glimpses into my life—my coffee rituals, these weird IT fires, the random trips with Jaq. But I still keep a hand on the lens. I share what I want, how I want. That balance? That’s the magic. And today, it all felt... about right.",1,1747949338.0,u_moodoo976,0,1.0,False

It seriously always smelled like, well, church. You know that special smoky stuff they use, and like, those old-timey flowers? Yeah. Every single Sunday, we were at church, then more church stuff during the week. It felt like every single talk was always, always about being good and not, like, messing up. I love my family, really, I do, but sometimes, especially when it got dark and super quiet, our house just felt less like home and more like a pretty, pretty cage.

I was seventeen, almost eighteen, which felt, like, super old, but I still had to follow a buncha rules. Like, my mom would give me the side-eye if my shirt showed too much, and if I asked too many questions about why things were a certain way, it was like I was, like, causing trouble. My older sister, Maria, she was super good at all that stuff. She was like, the perfect church-going girl, eyeroll. Me? I just had this buzzin' feeling inside me, like I needed more. I'd read tons of books about faraway places, look at cool art, anything that showed me a world bigger than our small, small town. I wanted to feel new streets under my shoes, taste food I couldn't even name, and breathe air that didn't feel heavy with all the rules.

Then Leo showed up. He wasn't from our town; he was just, like, passing through. He took pictures for a living, and his eyes looked like they'd seen big, open spaces. His laugh just made me wanna, like, jump and try something new. I met him at the coffee shop where I worked to kinda get away from the house. He actually saw me, you know? Not just ""one of the O'Malley girls"" from church, but just me. He talked about cool stuff like light and how to catch a moment, and living life in bright, bright colors. And when he looked at me, he wasn't judging; he was just curious, which made my skin, like, tingle.

One afternoon, he showed me some of his pictures. They were super bright street scenes from a country called Morocco, or wild music clubs in New Orleans, and calm pictures of a lady selling flowers in a place called Lisbon. My fingers just, like, wanted to touch the pictures, and I felt this strong, strong pull, like my body just wanted to go there. He leaned in closer to show me something small in a picture, and for just a second, his arm kinda brushed mine. It felt like a small electric shock, but deeper, like something, like, forbidden. I could smell him – a mix of old paper, a little bit like campfire, and something fresh, like after it rains. It smelled, like, amazing.

""You really want this, don't you?"" he whispered, his voice soft. ""I can see it in your eyes, Elena. There's a whole, whole world waiting for you.""

My heart pounded like a drum, like, against my ribs. He saw it. He knew.

The next few weeks were a blur of secret moments. Quick talks at the coffee shop, hiding my phone to text him late, late at night when my parents were asleep. He told me about his trips, and I just, like, spilled everything about how trapped I felt, how badly I wanted to break free. He never pushed me or told me what to do, but just having him around felt like an invitation to a totally different life. He was everything I wanted: freedom, adventures, and a way of being alive that wasn't about being good or bad, but just about living to the fullest.

One evening, he was leaving town. He came to the coffee shop just before we closed. The place was empty. He stood across the counter, looking right, right at me. ""I'm heading out tonight,"" he said, his voice a little quieter than usual. ""Going to the beach, and then… who knows where.""

My throat felt tight. This was it. My big chance. Or maybe, my big, big mistake.

""Come with me,"" he said, not like he was telling me what to do, but like he was just offering. ""Just for a little bit. See how it feels to just breathe outside these walls.""

My brain went super, super fast. My parents. Maria. The embarrassment, the gossip, all the prayers they'd say for my lost soul. But then I thought about the church smells, the quiet rules, the small, safe life they had planned for me. And I thought about the bright colors in Leo's photos, the taste of new foods, the wildness in his eyes.

I looked at him, really, really looked at him. The way his dark hair fell, the tiny wrinkles by his eyes when he smiled. He wasn't promising a perfect life, but an unwritten one. A life where I could find out who Elena really was, without all the ""shoulds"" and ""musts.""

My hand shook a little as I reached across the counter, not to touch him, but to grab a napkin. ""Give me ten minutes,"" I whispered, so quiet he could barely hear me. ""I need to… pack.""

He smiled, a slow, knowing smile that reached his eyes. ""I'll be waiting. Just down the street, by the big old oak tree.""

Walking out of that coffee shop, the cool night air hit me, sharp and exciting. I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't know if I was making the biggest mistake ever, or finally, truly, living. But for the very first time, the path ahead felt wide open, scary, and totally, deliciously, mine. The smell of being free, raw and wild, was a thousand times more intoxicating than any church incense. And I knew, deep down in my bones, that I was finally going to explore the exciting whisper of the world.",2,1747948879.0,offmychest,0,0.75,False

1kt2bts,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1kt2bts/aio_feeling_blamed/,AIO. Feeling blamed,"Am I crazy for feeling like I’ve been one-sided in an interaction with my friend?

My friend (let’s call her Janice) and I have been friends for a couple of years now. We talk consistently, though not frequently, if that makes sense. I’d consider us good friends, and I enjoy spending time with her.

Like with all friendships, there are highs and lows—periods where we talk often and periods where we don’t. I understand that, and that’s always been the dynamic between me and Janice. Additionally, I’m someone who’s pretty straightforward, so I tend to prefer open communication with my friends. That means if there’s anything wrong with what I said or do, I’m more than happy to listen and fix them. This info helps set the stage for what I’m about to say.

Back in April, I noticed that we had gone unusually silent. We had just seen each other in person toward the end of March or early April, so I initially thought nothing of it. But more than 2 weeks passed without any initiative from her end, I started to feel concerned and decided to reach out.
At first, I held off because I assumed she was busy with school and life. It was also finals season, and I didn’t want to bother her. So, I checked in with Janice on April 30, but didn’t get a response until six days later. What confused me, though, was that during that week she was regularly posting on Instagram stories and even sending me TikToks. There were a few moments where I replied to her stories, and she didn’t respond either.

Eventually, she replied six days later. At that point, it had been close to 3 weeks since we last spoke. Her response felt lukewarm and didn’t acknowledge the gap in communication at all. Honestly, it came across as surface-level. I was slightly upset, but I kept things polite and let her know I didn’t appreciate how long it took to reply, especially since she had been so active online, and expressed that I was worried about her. I also mentioned that I was concerned if there’s something up between us.

Janice replied shortly after, explaining that she had just been really overwhelmed with school, work, and life, and things had slipped her mind which I completely understood. I’m fact, all the frustration I felt went away. We ended that exchange by reaffirming our appreciation for each other and agreeing to be more communicative moving forward. I felt relieved that it seemingly ended on a good note and figured the issue was resolved. So, I took the initiative to schedule a hangout for the following week and was looking forward to catching up.

On the day of our hangout, I texted her to ask what she wanted to do—coffee, a walk, something outdoors since it was a nice day. She didn’t seem particularly enthusiastic, but I didn’t want to assume anything based on text tone.

We ended up meeting to go for a stroll (her idea), but instead, she asked if we could sit on a nearby bench. That was fine with me since it was a casual hangout, and just to check in with each other…or so I thought.

Once the conversation got going, we covered the basics, but I couldn’t shake off the strained vibe—mostly coming from her side. Early into the hangout, Janice brought up two comments I made back in February that had upset her, and said they were the reason she pulled away.

The first was at my friend Adriana’s house. Adriana had asked Janice to cat-sit, and apparently, I made a joke: “Oh, the cat’s going to survive, not thrive.” I have no memory of saying that, but I owned up to it. I apologized and said that even though I don’t remember it, I take responsibility for hurting her feelings.

The second instance was also at Adriana’s house during a Galentine’s Day gathering. Adriana had invited me over to bake brownies and play board games, and I asked if I could bring Janice. She agreed. We were supposed to start around 8 PM, but Janice didn’t arrive until 11:58 PM. I remembered this night clearly because everyone was waiting on her since she had the board game. I’d also wanted to introduce her to my other friends and, honestly, coming 4 hours late didn’t look on both me and her.

When she finally got there, we got to playing the game and I tend to get competitive. After the game, she asked me to grab her a brownie, and I jokingly told her to get it herself. Firsr of all, I want to emphasized that I get how that could’ve come off wrong. I would like to prefix that I tend to have a teasing tone with all of my friends and don’t really mean what I say. Even so, I also understand that everyone has different sensitivities, so I try to be respectful and always apologize if I cross a line.

Apparently, that comment also bothered her. Again, I’m not blaming her for feeling how she felt—I took accountability, apologized, and told her I’d be more mindful in the future. But truthfully, I felt like she could’ve brought it up way sooner. Im still trying to wrap my head around two comments justified ghosting me for nearly a month, especially when I’ve always made it clear that I’m open to honest conversations. I’ve never claimed to be perfect. 

To make things even more confusing, I found out during that conversation that she’d been in a completely different state the whole time we weren’t talking. And somehow, her phrasing during our chat made it seem like I had distanced myself. I kept telling her I hadn’t—that I’d been acting the same and was genuinely unaware she felt any type of way.

You know what made it even more frustrating? She was out of state because of her situationship. For context, Janice has a history of getting wrapped up in relationships, and there have been moments in the past where I felt she neglected our friendship for a man. Janice had reassured me this time was different and that she’d learned her lesson from her last relationship. But from where I’m standing, her actions don’t really reflect that. 

On top of that, there was a comment she said that had rubbed me the wrong way. She was also upset that I went on a long weekend trip to a different city with Adrianna. Janice and I sometimes talk about visiting this city together but I’ve always figured that it would just be the two of us. Not to mention, it was Adrianna that invited me to stay at her house. I didn’t want to burden her by adding another guest that she, as a host, would have to take care of. Also, Adrianna and Janice weren’t even that close.

By the end of the conversation, I felt guilty—like I was being blamed for the silence between us. Again, I’m not saying that I’m free of faults and I understand what I’ve said could’ve hurt her feelings.  

But after talking to a few other friends, some of them mentioned that Janice’s reaction is a slight overkill considering how easily it could have been resolved. 

Also, I realized that if I hadn’t reached out, who knows when or if she would’ve talked to me again? And truthfully, it felt like she came to the hangout ready to criticize me instead of genuinely reconnectingn. It didn’t feel like a mutual check-in at all. It has been more than a week since that interaction and Janice has yet to hit me up or planned any hang outs which is starting to make me doubt if those are the only problems she has with me.

Still, part of me wonders if I’m just overthinking everything.

So… am I crazy for feeling this way?

1kt25oz,https://i.redd.it/96z08ti4fe2f1.png,Rollei,"Rant

I just got back from a long weekend shooting street scenes and vibing hard with my Mint Rollei 35 AF—and at first, yeah, I was genuinely hyped. I mean, digital Rollei? Autofocus? Tiny body? It's got all the makings of a modern cult classic. But then the existential dread kicked in, as it always does, when I realized the cold hard truth:

**Why can’t I just open the back of this digital camera and load real 35mm film inside it?**  
It’s 2025. We have foldable phones, AI girlfriends, and cars that parallel park better than most humans. But I still can’t stuff a roll of Portra into a $500 digital homage to a film camera? Make it make sense.

Everywhere I look it’s just Mint this, Mint that—preorders, hype videos, beautiful packaging, even a *coffee table book* that ships with the camera. And yeah, the design is cute. It looks like a Rollei, it smells like a Rollei, but spiritually? It’s a hollow shell. A mimic. A cosplay.

**I’m not even asking for much.** Give me a hybrid back. A fake-out hinged door. Let me load film *just for the ritual*, even if it doesn’t do anything. Or better yet—engineer it so it actually exposes the film while simultaneously recording digital. We send billionaires to space but I can’t get a compact hybrid half-digi-half-film brick?

And no, before anyone says it: this isn’t about being a luddite. I *like* autofocus. I like digital. I like knowing my ISO actually means something. But I also like film. I like the little rewind crank. I like the mystery. I like accidentally ruining a shot and pretending it was ""on purpose.""

All I’m saying is: if Mint spent half as much time on R&D as they do on making leather straps in five Pantone shades, we’d have a 35 AF that actually respects the 35 part of its heritage.

Sorry in advance if everyone thinks this is dumb. I just want to live in a world where my digital Rollei lets me live the lie a little more fully.",1,1747948383.0,AnalogCircleJerk,6,1.0,False
1kt25dp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kt25dp,General advice on long living/dining room,"Hello everyone. I've been lurking here for a while trying to build up some knowledge for my first home. We've been moved in for about three weeks now and there is still plenty to do, but I suppose I just have some questions, or I guess, I'm looking for opinions. 

So, I'll say first that the pictures make it look a little more crampt than it actually is. There is plenty of space to walk between the dining area and the living room area. Additionally, I know the fireplace looks godawful and I'm going to redo the outside of it so it isn't an eye and hopefully takedown some of the bulk and add an electric fireplace inside it. 

Here are some things that I plan on doing, so let me know if I'm crazy or if I should be going another route. 

The curtains are still what came with the house when we bought it. I'd like to do something more in an earth tone and semi sheer. I'd also like to redo the curtain rods in a brass colour. I think it'd match things a bit better. The short black bookcase in the living room will be replaced by a tall bookcase for verticality (plus I have a lot of books). I'd like to get some kind of long store solution for my records under the livingroom window that could also act as a little stuo up for my cats since I'll be building a catio off that window for them. 

These are things I'm really puzzled about. 

The big chandelier(?) in the living room with the Edison bulbs is cool... But I feel like it's clashing with the style we are developing in the room. Maybe u should replace it? I feel like the livingroom could use a rug for the area, but would it be weird to have two rugs beside eachother since there is already one under the dining table? I really like the look of wood, but I have quite a few colours going on right now with the wood. I was thinking if maybe staining the coffee table a darker colour to match more of the dark wood from the dining room/tv stand. 

Other considerations.

I have to add some stuff on the walls (little shelves for plants?) and get some other sources of lighting. A tall lamp behind the rocking chair might look nice and maybe finding a place to put a table lamp. There are sconces opposite to the fireplace that are great lighting too. 

Anyways, any advice would be appreciated. If people need anymore pictures or anything just let me know!",1,1747948362.0,interiordecorating,2,1.0,False

I'm back in the 1200 game after a yearlong break as I try to slim down for my wedding in September. I've actually been enjoying the process lately, especially being creative about making satisfying, voluminous, nutritious meals that leave me satisfied and keep me at 1200. My diet isn't perfect and I don't count macros, although I do try to be conscious of protein intake. I wanted to share the MVPs of my diet lately as I really feel they've been helping me stay on track:

* huge salads. as the weather gets hotter, all i want to eat are big giant salads filled with greens and raw veg. super satisfying and low cal.
* cottage cheese obvi. i eat it in so many forms: blended as dip, on my salads as a cheese/dressing, in a bowl with salt/pepper and cucumber/other veg. sometimes i use it as a burrata-esque sub with a drizzle of pesto and sauteed cherry tomatoes
* protein gloop! protein + greek yogurt, yum.
* PB powder. i am a peanut butter fiend so pb powder is a lifesaver, esp in shakes or savory peanut sauces
* shirataki noodles. i also just discovered kelp noodles which are cheaper and have a better texture. neither of these hit the spot like real pasta but they make a great sub in asian dishes. i make a sauce with pb powder + lime juice + chili garlic + soy sauce and drench my noodles in it and the whole thing is less than 200 cal. delightful.
* bok choy! satisfying texture, versatile, filling, basically no cals lol
* celery all day every day. it's not that great but it's good for people like me who need to be munching constantly.
* same goes for baby carrots. not as low cal as celery but pretty good still.
* i just got on the greek yogurt/sugar free jello train and let me tell you, it lives up to the hype.
* mushrooms. you can eat a whole pile for like 50 cal. i saute them and make a toast on sourdough or make a gravy using the liquid that releases from them + greek yogurt and dip my bread in there.
* seaweed/popcorn when i need late night crunchy salty snack!!!! which is often!!!!
* SELTZER!!! so much seltzer
* iced black coffee with a tiny splash of almond milk, which i do not count.
* poppi as a sweet treat after a meal if i really need some real sugar (only 30-40 calories per can. i was never a pop drinker but poppi hits the spot when you need dessert)
* sparkling ice has the same function as poppi but is only 5 cal heheh
* honorable mentions: giant veggie stir fries, shakshouka with an entire can of crushed tomatoes, canned veg when im feeling lazy, giant soups and veggie stews in the wintertime, ""warm salad"" which is sauteed veggies on a bed of greens.

edit omg i forgot 2 crucial ones

1kt24ey,https://www.reddit.com/r/TikTokdrama/comments/1kt24ey/austin_howd_is_an_egotistical_and_cocky_liar/,Austin Howd is an egotistical and cocky liar,"I've watched Austin's lives for awhile but had to finally stop.As he got more popular his egotistical and cocky side came out. His regular gifters/mods are mostly middle aged moms/single women that probably watch him for his good looks. He wants to stay in A1 but the only way he can do it, is if his biggest gifter jennifer is there(last time she wasnt there he went back to A2). Smh she's a stay at home mom who uses who her husband's money to gift him. Keep in mind he makes 1k(the other night he made 3k and even spent 2k on tickets to the knicks game) a day, I actually saw that some of his regular gifters were saying they could only gift a lil at times since they needed to save up and he was wringing them dry by battling everyday to stay in A1. He's aiming to be a live pro, I cant see it happening for him with being gifted by the same ppl over and over again.

Austin doesn't like it when his supporters watch/ gift others. It gets weird where he told his supporters that he doesn't like that we were cheating on him by supporting other creators(it comes off Manipulative as he only wants us to be loyal to him and make us feel guilty if we arent). Tbh it gave off culty vibes too cause his main mods/gifters Molly, Jennifer and Nicole get lashed out by him at times, but they say they will never watch/gift anyone but him and are so protective of him. I've never seen any live streamer/content creator be so possessive of their supporters. It's scary how much power he has over these people. It's soo toxic.

The other day Austin was on his backup, showing his new barber who he just met and telling his viewers to go to the barber's live to support. Jennifer ends up going there and decides to be nice by gifting the barber a lion. Austin complains"" why did you do that"". Later he goes live on his main account ranting about Jennifer saying"" idk why would you gift the barber, I barely know the guy. The barber is prob a millionaire with all the salons he owns and doesn't even know how to take money out of tiktok so it'll most likely stay there forever. That lion could have helped me stay in A1 tonight and you should have just cash apped/venmo me that instead"" So he keeps ranting about that here and there throughout the live till Jennifer shows up. She's like ""you shouldn't talk bad to those who support you, its not right that you've been talking bad about me the last couple days and if you didnt want me to gift the barber, you shouldn't have told us his live"".

After all that he responds"" i would never say negative things about you"" to gaslight her. In the end she still comes back to him later to gift him 🙄 when she could be using that 300$ lion towards her kids instead.

Next i wanna point out Austin talks big about his career repeatedly in every live. He' 35 and hasn't modeled in a long time. His last gig was being an extra in a movie and that's about it. He says he has 5 star reviews for his photography business but that site is nowhere to be found. If he was really doing so well with it then why is his going live everyday for 6hrs+ at odd times of the day. He's a liar and a pervert. He said he does have gf (in one of his early morning live he said it and we heard her in 2 of his lives the zoo and the knicks game live)but then he decided to hide it once again I guess to make sure he didn't break those middle aged women's hearts so they wouldn't stop watching/gifting him.

I say he's a pervert because even though he has a gf(if you mention he has a gf in the chat, he will block you and say youre telling lies to start drama), in his lives he always zooms up on women and checks them out. One time on live when he was at dumbo at night, he decided to film these 2 asian girls and they told him to stop cause they felt awkward. He told them"" i can film whatever i want cause we're in public"" and kept doing it. I don't think he realized it came off creepy and him harassing them. Also I don't like how he always films ppl on the subway/homeless ppl. Even tho it's public, he needs to respect ppl's space. Ppl have called him out on it and then he blocks them saying he has the right to film in public of anything/anyone.

Him talking down to his friend Ash is disgusting. He says it's fine since everyone else treats him that way. He even told him"" if you want food and coffee you need to do this for me"" 😠and then keeps yelling at him off and on throughout the live
. 
Last night someone said they wanted to gift ash and Austin just laughed saying "" you don't even have a badge next to your name and never gifted anyone"" to him it's all about what lvl gifter you're, if he sees you're high lvl then he will kiss up to you so you can gift him. He tells his supporters he doesnt want roses only higher gifts.He also makes fun of his supporters that he follows, he saw one of them went live and laughed how they only have 1 person in their live. He made fun of another one of his  supporter's live saying it's all bouncy and he doesnt hold the camera straight. He goes to watch lives on his secret account to see if his supporters are in other people's lives and even calls them out on it that he saw them. 

This is what shows Austin's true colors, he tells this story of saving a dog before on live. If you go google his name and type Facebook, a page pops up saying he's a thief/he should be arrested and theres a convo that shows the owners saying Austin withheld her dog from her. He defends himself saying he didn't know if they were truly the owners or not that's why he didnt give it to them right away. Oddly enough he knew the dogs name even tho he denys not knowing anything about the dog. On that fb page it shows he did make a go fund me to scam ppl to give him money for the dog. So if he was so caring about animals, why didn't he just give it back. Why did multiple ppl come out saying they were blocked by him when asking about the dog? Why try to make money off it? Ppl have heard about it yesterday in his live and he's denying it saying it's bot that's spreading lies, but how would the owners get a picture of Austin holding their dog to put it on a gofundme page. The only person who would have that picture is him. He's so disgusting and gross, I cant believe ppl will give their money to this monster. The only reason he finally gave the owner the dog back is because they filed charges against him. When he finally gave the dog back, they dropped the charges. There's 2 fb pages up that talk about him blocking ppl who were trying to talk to him about the dog owner so he can give it back to her.

Lastly he's such a sore loser when it comes to battling. Everytime he loses, he throws a fit and claims the other person is cheating or they only have 1 big gifter. He even told one girl who beat him saying"" your bf prob gifted you right, that's how you won"". Like he can't accept he just lost cause they had a strong team, he always comes up with some kind of excuse on why he lost or yells at who gifted at the wrong time. Last night he once again lost his mind losing a battle and even told that girl it must be your bf helping you. Someone in his chat says "" let it go"" he snaps and says "" let what go? I'm about to block you"". Which is crazy cause the person just wanted him to move on from an uncomfy situation but Austin needs to have his tantrum and everyone in his chat must be mad with him about losing the battle too🙄. 

Lately a lot comments have been popping up that ppl have noticed he's been more of a rude stuck up cocky Ahole and has changed. Im so disgusted by him and how he treats ppl. I hope ppl realize how he truly is and stop gifting him/ watching his live. He claims everything he does ppl copy him, even with him going live in nyc. He says Gunner blocked him cause he was taking his viewers/gifters when in reality I think that's a lie. Ive never seen Gunner come off like that and it's obvious Austin gets mad when his viewers go watch Gunner instead. I feel like most likely he blocked Gunner cause he gets so easily triggered/ offended if anyone talks about him or any other nyc tiktoker in his chat. He's such a big baby and narcissist. He got mad the other day when ppl kept bringing up ash in chat, he finally was like who cares about ash and told them to stop talking about ash since he doesnt want the spotlight on anybody but himself.",2,1747948297.0,TikTokdrama,0,1.0,False

And if you’re expecting a heartfelt story about how my husband and I are good people who would love and cherish a child, build treehouses, and get a dog, it’s not coming. However much it might be true, that’s not gonna happen here.

Why?

Because I’ve been bled dry—emotionally, financially and physically—by an industry that looks at women and sees dollar signs.

After 8 years, three losses, six surgical procedures and more than $100,000, I have no children, no fucks left to give and just enough dignity not to get on my knees, spew out my medial history and beg for biological clemency on a public forum (again).

I’m not (only) sad, I’m not (only) heartbroken, I’m enraged by a paternalistic system that gaslights women, commodifying their bodies while claiming to protect them. 

In Canada, it is illegal to pay a surrogate for their (literal) labour. A woman cannot be paid for carrying another person’s child.

However, third-party agencies are 100% able to profit from surrogates and intended parents. There are entire businesses dedicated to this, people who make their living off women’s bodies, off their hopes and their dreams, and the Canadian government is A-OK with it.

For example, there are Canadian surrogate agencies owned (in part) by men who are not citizens of Canada, who don’t live here and never have. These men stand to earn thousands of dollars every time a Canadian woman takes on the risks of pregnancy and delivery through their agency, while the women earn nothing.

Why does the Canadian Government allow this? Why are surrogates told they must be altruistic, while others are allowed to be enriched by the bodies of strangers?

The government says this is to protect women.

The average cost of engaging a surrogacy agency in Canada is about $22,000. That doesn’t include the cost of IFV, legalities, or the surrogate's expenses, which intended parents (obviously and rightly) incur. The total cost of having a child through a surrogate can be as high as $200,000 in some cases.

So, what do these essentially unregulated surrogacy agencies offer? Often, it boils down to asking a couple to film a “tear-jerker” video, write a sad story, and provide “happy couple” photos that the agency can post on social media or their website.

Oh, you’re going to make a social media post?! Why didn’t I ever think of that? Yes, please take all my money!

“You really want to tug at the heartstrings,” one agency told me, urging me to include all of the worst moments of my life.

It’s a dehumanizing system that forces people struggling with infertility to publicly relive their trauma over and over again, at great expense. It’s sick. It’s disgusting.

It’s also a system that makes no promises. Agencies do not guarantee that they can match potential parents with a gestational surrogate, and Canadian couples often find themselves pitted against wealthy European or Australian couples operating in a regulatory vacuum.

(If a match is made—and it’s a big if, because there’s no public reporting required by these companies, so records are opaque— the agency does act as a go-between for expense payments and sets up two meetings with a clinical social worker. Is that worth 22 grand? You tell me.)

Now, you might be asking why intended parents don’t post their own advertisements, seeking altruistic surrogates. The answer is that most advertisers won’t take them. 

Kijiji Canada currently has at least three flamethrowers listed for sale.

But they took down my surrogacy post because of “safety, health, and legal risks.” 

Unlike a flamethrower that can be fired up in any public space, achieving a gestational surrogacy requires a team of doctors and other medical professionals, clinical evaluations, legal contracts and tens of thousands of dollars. Unlike selling a deadly weapon designed for trench warfare, it doesn’t happen at a local coffee shop.

C’mon, am I really the threat to public safety here? I mean, what the fuck?

To be clear, I think women should be paid for all the labour they do. By what mechanism that would happen in a situation like this is a topic for another post, but if $22,000 has to go somewhere, it should go to the woman putting her emotional and physical well-being on the line so that someone else has a shot at parenthood. 

Of course, many people do pay surrogates under the table, or so I was told by a doctor at my local fertility clinic. The founder of one Canadian surrogacy agency, which continues to operate, was convicted of it in 2014, and I’ve heard of people inflating expenses to give surrogates expensive items, like new vehicles … something I haven’t been able to afford for the last 17 years.

There is so much to say, but this post is already too long. And I’ve barely scraped the surface: I haven’t even mentioned the surrogacy app used for sex trafficking, the scams, the mental health worker who pledged to be my surrogate, then backed out one year later after revealing her husband didn’t approve, the guy with the horses, the fist fight or the Republic of Georgia. 

So I’ll finish with this.

We keep saying that Canada has a public healthcare system, that we uphold human rights, and that we don’t discriminate. But the truth is, we have a multi-tier healthcare system designed for profiteering.

It’s not biology that determines whether someone becomes a parent; it’s income.

Then our texts start off abt some parking issue but she follows up by saying she felt weird that day and all that. So I figure like I said she just wants to stay as friends. Then she starts texting me again out of nowhere so I figure okay maybe she is still interested? So I ask to go to a concert and haven’t heard from her since 😂 so I’m just trynna figure out did I mess up somewhere or is she just giving hella mixed signals.

I sat back in my easy chair and sipped a cup of coffee.

*Thank God for Saturdays.*

I heard sirens and gunshots out the window, so I opened the blinds…

And promptly did a spit take.

*What in tarnation?!*

There was a scene of *absolute carnage* out there. Pete Denger’s convenience store a block and a half down was on *fire*, there were cars crashed into poles and glass storefronts and walls, and…

*Are those bodies?*

*What are those…*

*ARE THOSE ALIENS?!*

*They’re eating the bodies!*

*THEY’RE COMING THIS WAY!*

I chugged my coffee and grabbed my home defense weapon: an Ithaca 37 with an 18-inch barrel, which I had modified with a folding stock.

MEMORY TRANSCRIPTION SUBJECT: Bea Wallace (old lady, professional gardener)

*Now what is that Conager fellow yelling about?*

As a crowd began to gather around Mr. Conagher (many of us scoffing at his...*extraordinary* claims), one fellow I don’t know very well looked out the hallway window...and went *pale*.

“Uh...people? Leon’s telling the truth...Look!”

The crowd jostled to look out the window, and many went further down the hall and looked out other windows.

*There were bodies in the street, and 7 foot tall lizard men eating them.*

As that Mudlow kid grabbed his Boy Scout bugle and went to go wake up and alert the residents on other floors, people scrambled back to their apartments to call for help, grab a weapon, anything.

Me? I ransacked my closet, put on my kneepads, my dad’s gas mask from the Great War, and the thickest clothes I had...and grabbed my old kerosene-powered weed burner.

*Damned city ordinance might have made it illegal to use for weeds even in a professional setting, but this won’t be gardening, will it?*

MEMORY TRANSCRIPTION SUBJECT: Dick Peterson (ex-Marine veteran and retiree)

I snapped awake to the sound of gunshots.

*Goddamnit, it’s gotta be those damn gangbangers down the street again…*

Turning over and *trying* to go back to sleep, I heard some *damn fool* blowing “To Arms"" on a bugle, at least a *half octave* out of key.

Furious, I stormed out of my front door and was met with that damn Boy Scout kid from two floors above me, tromping up and down the hallway.

“Can ya keep it down? People are trying to sleep!”

“Look out the window!”

“...Huh?”

I looked out the window.

I paused for a moment in horrified incomprehension.

*What the...*

""FUCK!""

I went back into my apartment and dug the Johnson I’d used at Iwo Jima out of the closet, grabbed the Army surplus canvas satchel I kept full of loaded stripper clips, opened the window of my apartment, slipped into a firing crouch, and aimed.

MEMORY TRANSCRIPTION SUBJECT: “Biggy” Thompson (current leader of the 5^(th) Street Warriors)

*This whole fight is going to shit.*

We’d heard the 35^(th) Street Jackals were making moves on our turf, and we heard gunshots coming from their direction, so we grabbed our heaters and when we got there, the Jackals were all *dead* and they were being *eaten* by, IDK, 7 foot tall lizard men, who promptly turned and attacked *us.*

“Waste those lizard fools!”, I shouted, before firing my Glock .45 at them.

Before I knew what was what, I’d lost Tyrell, Hutch, Fridge, and, like, most of my gang.

Our shots weren’t landing, but *theirs* were.

I called a retreat after Jamal got fuckin *disintegrated* by some kind of raygun.

*Maybe if we can get to the apartments…*

I fired my last shots at a lizard who was charging me. I hit him a couple times, but they were glancing shots. He kept charging…

**BANG!**

Fucker’s head was blown off by a gunshot that came from the apartments.

“Everyone! Regroup at the apartments!”

MEMORY TRANSCRIPTION SUBJECT: Hank Perkins (electrician)

*Fuck shit fuck shit the lizards from the news are here fuck shit*

I’d *thought* that the news reports of *7-foot-tall lizard people* who were *eating people* was some kind of prank or hoax. Apparently not.

I’d pulled the bugle kid from the 7^(th) floor aside and told him to warn people I was gonna try to electrify the fire escapes to stop the damn lizards from getting in that way, and he nodded and went off to do that.

After shutting down the power box in the hall, I took my tools (and some spare line), rigged the line to the fire escape, and grounded the damn setup through the brick so that it wouldn’t trip the breakers.

As I heard the gunshots from the apartment of that old guy on the 3^(rd) floor intensify, I grabbed the breakers lever.

*Here goes nothing…*

MEMORY TRANSCRIPTION SUBJECT: Pinzol (Arxur raider/low-ranking officer)

*Prophets damn this planet! Even the civilian housing is hard to raid!*

After we’d (mostly) wiped out the pathetic prey firing at us while holding their guns *sideways* (which is stupid even for prey), we came under fire from some *damned* sniper in the housing block a block away.

The smarter hunters dove for cover and started to wind their way towards the building.

The weaker hunters died stupidly, as they should.

“Arraka! Get that damn sniper!”

“With pleasure!”

As Arraka pulled the pin on a grenade and got ready to throw it, though…

**SPANG-KRASH!**

A *plant* in a brown clay pot smashed down on her head.

Doesn’t matter whether she was killed by that or just knocked out, I dove for cover behind a boxy, worn-out car as the grenade made that question meaningless.

**WHEE-OO-WHEE-OOH-HONK! HONK! HONK! HONK!**

I was suddenly hit with a deafening noise from the car itself. I smashed a window, put a grenade into it, and vigorously *shoved* it towards the building while I dove through a smashed window of one of the prey stores nearby to escape the blast.

**BOOM!**

*And there! Instant foxhole!*

I was about to dive into it when I realized the battery hadn’t exploded as I’d hoped. Instead, burning fuel pooled at the bottom of the hole, sending black smoke skywards.

*Prophets dammit, they BOOBY TRAP their CIVILIAN VEHICLES too?!*

Grumbling, I ordered my men to make their way to a side street.

As we marched, we came under fire from prey in other buildings throwing things: kitchen appliances, rocks, bricks, hand tools, *paper books*...one poor runt even got hit with *literal prey-shit*.

Suppressing the brief twinge of the *hated* empathy that seeing the runt get hit brought me, I ordered my men to throw grenades back at them.

Seven or eight explosions later, the fusillade of random objects stopped and was replaced by the sound of screaming.

*Good, some pre-dismembered meat to feast on later.*

As we rounded the corner, I heard panicked shouting coming from inside the prey housing complex, and saw…

*Aha! Finally! Something’s been made easy!*

Cackling, I ordered the shit-covered runt to pull down that black metal ladder so his betters could scale it, but the runt froze up when he touched it.

I thought it was cowardice and was about to execute him, but then a *revolting* smell of burning shit hit my nostrils and I saw that the claw gripping the ladder was *smoking*.

As the runt twitched and grunted and yelped, his eyes full of pain and desperation, the smell of burning shit took on the smell of burning meat.

Leaving him to his fate, I ordered my men to split into three teams: one takes the front door, one takes the windows on one side, and one takes the windows on the other.

Muttering some *indelicate* curses my finishing school matron would have beaten me black and blue for, I loaded my snubnosed British .38 and tried to keep calm and ignore my neighbors running up and down the corridors with all kinds of random sh...stuff: broken off broom handles, baseball bats, pistols, shotguns, rifles, crossbows, Molotov Cocktails, that one Southerner on the 2^(nd) floor in full re-enactment Confederate uniform and full kit (with bayonet fixed on his musket),

I even saw that Caulkin kid hauling a red wagon full of rope and paint cans, and the Pruitt kid…

*Are those firecrackers with nails and bolts taped around them?*

*...Eh, I guess it’s less dangerous than the Molotovs...or the lizards.*

I heard the sound of gunshots coming from the lowest floor, and something that made my stomach sink into the floor.

I heard that nice Kovacs guy from the first floor yell “THEY’RE COMING IN!”

From the landing, I could see his muzzle flash light up the downstairs hall to the left as he fired his grandfather’s old black-powder revolver he’d brought from the Old Country, and I heard lizards die. But then I heard a click...and he started screaming.

Thinking quickly, I grabbed the bucket of soapy mop water from my kitchen and dumped it down the stairwell to the front door.

“Great idea, Mrs. Ross!”

I looked to see the Caulkin kid one floor above me, tying paint cans to the railing…

*What is he...Oh! You throw the paint can off and it swings around on the rope and hits the lizards in the face!*

“You too, kid!”

*Try to hold it together, Henrietta...*

MEMORY TRANSCRIPTION SUBJECT: Jack Bullitt (beat cop turned private eye turned old man and professional sports writer)

In the years I’d been a cop, and the years I’d been a private eye, I’d seen some *shit*.

I’d seen little girls drugged and tied into cars and then the cars shoved off an embankment.

I’d stopped the Face Killer back in ‘67, two victims in.

I’d seen the worst (and the best) humanity could offer in this damn town...but *this*…

*I’m getting too old for this shit, and I quit bourbon decades ago.*

My Colt .38 wasn’t enough firepower, so I’d grabbed my old Remington Model 8 with extended mag. When they’d breached the Fairview family’s apartments, I’d ankled it over there sharpish, and blew the lizards down. Shot the fucks right on the beezer, too.

Some young gang palookas had seen me struggling to move their refrigerator to block the hole, and had helped me out, even throwing a lizard’s grenade back at them when it came through the window.

“Never thought I’d die fighting side by side with a cop,” one of them (a young black fella) said.

I thought on what to say, how to respond.

“How about side by side with a fellow human?”

He nodded.

“Yeah, I can do that, man.”

MEMORY TRANSCRIPTION SUBJECT: Pinzol

*Prophets DAMN THIS CURSED PLANET!*

These prey, oooooh, they were clever...They’d greased the stairs with *soap suds* and kept throwing crudely improvised explosives down the stairwell, alternating with *metal cans of paint* that would swing around on a rope and break a raider’s snout.

*Or his neck.*

*Damn Team 2 for their failure!*

*Can't even take some armed resistance, got ambushed by a damn exterminator! Got slaughtered to a soldier!*

*WE'RE supposed to be the predators here!*

“Report, Team 3! Have you breached the window yet?”

I heard a tremendous-

***CRASH!***

From where I’d sent Team 3 and then received my response.

“Now we have. Prey put up a barricade-”

The radio cut off as the sounds of furious melee combat came from the new breach.

The sounds of clinking blades, screaming prey, and shouting hunters.

*The music of a true sapient.*

I saw my second-in-command force open the…

*Elevator doors? How didn’t ANY of us see that?*

Before I could congratulate him, he got mangled and dismembered by being ground between the cable his claws were stuck in, the inside of the shaft, and a descending elevator car.

Two prey emerged: one in a grey uniform, one with darker skin and a shiny black jacket holding a belt fed machine gun, and a hatchling behind them.

As Vental charged the car, the one in the grey uniform skewered him in the heart with a long triangular blade on the end of a long, thin rifle. Before I could react, he was aiming at *me* and-

*OWWWWWW!*

I roared in pain as the gun thundered, sending a plume of smoke into the hallway as my kneecap was *shattered* by a heavy-caliber projectile.

I did my best to dive out of the way as the machine gun ripped through my men with the sound of a buzzsaw, but I caught a few bullets and fell to the ground.

Then, as I tried to staunch my wounds, some damn *hatchling* rolled a red four-wheeled cart towards me, loaded with…

*Oh Prophets no…*

Red, rectangular cans of fuel, glass bottles, aerosol cans, pipes with hastily soldered wire attached, clear plastic containers full of something yellow, and a large glass jar full of coins.

The last thing I felt was burning heat and *more* things piercing me.

I only felt it for a fraction of a second.",11,1747947613.0,NatureofPredators,12,1.0,False

George and I met through my university library and became friends quickly. Over time, I opened up to him about some really personal things — childhood bullying, family issues, and mental health struggles, including suicidal thoughts. I trusted him.

Things started to shift after he introduced me to his church group. I didn’t mind it at first, but he and his brother kept pushing political conversations (mostly pro-Trump), even after I told them I wasn’t comfortable discussing politics. George kept questioning me, asking if my views were just “inherited from my dad,” and wouldn’t let it go, even after I asked him to stop.

I told him that comment bothered me and asked for an apology. Instead, he refused to apologize over text and basically said the friendship was over. Still, I agreed to meet him in person that same day and even bought him a coffee, hoping we could patch things up.

But instead of apologizing, he said I had low self-esteem, accused me of trying to drag him down, and told me I was “sounding like the devil.” He tried to pray over me (I declined), then asked me to hug him — I offered a handshake instead. I left that conversation feeling belittled and humiliated. Later, I ended the friendship via text.

That was about four months ago. Since then, I’ve distanced myself from him, the church group, and mutual contacts. But recently I saw him at the library. At first, he was seated a couple rows ahead of me with his back turned. When I stepped out for water and came back, he had moved seats to directly face me. It felt intentional and made me uncomfortable.

His brother also randomly removed me from social media. George, on the other hand, has been acting like nothing happened — greeting me with fist bumps and casual “what’s up, Jakob?” A few church members texted me after things ended, encouraging me to come back. I just told them I was busy. Those messages eventually stopped.

Now I can’t help but wonder — is George trying to make me look like the bad guy? Was I too harsh in cutting him off? Or was this just a boundary I needed to set?

Any advice on how to navigate this would help. I haven’t responded to anyone else, and I don’t know if I should address it directly, stay distant, or just try to forget the whole thing.

هاد البلان قلت نشاركو وممكن يطيح المنشور فشي واحد لي بصح فنفس الوضعية..ماشي بهدف نقول أنا دوزت ولا ناجح..أنا فاشل غا قرا الموضوع ودير بدكشي ووالله أخي تاتقلب حياتك للأحسن..

والله يفرجها على أي واح فوضعية صعيبة

There was a time when I was completely messed up, right after finishing high school. I didn’t know what to do next. 

I kept comparing myself to others, and that only made things worse. I started having serious problems. 

Life felt dark. I’m not talking about a breakup or feeling a bit lonely..

I’m talking about real struggles. I used to work out regularly, but I stopped. I wasn’t in the mood anymore.

With time, I felt like I had no door left to knock on… except turning back to God.

I started trying to wake up early, pray Fajr, and then jump on my laptop to explore different things online. I’d go to a café, spend the whole day there until Maghrib... 
no food, just coffee.

 I’d pray, make du‘a, and go back to working on my laptop.

At night, I’d go for walks alone, listening to podcasts, Qur’an, or lectures...
just walking and enjoying the moment.

At first, I was doing all of this just to escape thinking about the problems surrounding me. I didn’t want to deal with them.

But with time… I found something I enjoyed. God opened a path for me.

 I started training again. I started making good money, alhamdulillah. And one day, I looked up and realized I had reached a level I never thought I could
 if it weren’t for those hard times.

I learned that trials from Allah always have wisdom behind them.
 Even if you don’t understand why you’re going through what you’re going through, or why life feels like every door is closed
 just know, there’s a reason.

So here’s my advice: if you’re going through stuff, feeling lost or depressed 
run from your problems into good habits. Do things that benefit you. Be around people or take time alone.. whatever gives you peace. But let your energy go into something useful. And most importantly, get closer to God. You’ll feel peace in the middle of what once felt like pain.

I just wanted to share this because maybe someone going through the same thing might read this. And if that’s you, my friend: turn to God, rely on Him, and ask Him to help you. 

Everything will be okay, and one day, these hard days will just be memories you smile at.

1kt1j4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1kt1j4x/second_interview_coffee_chat_after_a_vp_interview/,Second interview (coffee chat) after a VP interview at a big bank—what should I make of this?,"I recently applied for a position at one of the big banks and, to my surprise, got contacted for an in-person interview pretty quickly. The first interview was at a branch and lasted about an hour with both a recruiter and a VP. The recruiter said I’d hear back in 3 weeks, but when he stepped out, the VP said more like 2 weeks realistically—so I figured I’d just wait it out.

But then the next *day*, I got a call inviting me to meet the same VP again, this time for an informal coffee chat. She said the first interview was “only an hour” and she didn’t get to ask everything. We met today at a local coffee shop, and it felt pretty relaxed. She was friendly and asked a lot of personal questions about my background and stuff then at the end when we were parting ways she told me she still has two more people to speak with by the end of this week (it’s Wednesday now). Before we wrapped up, she said I have her email and to feel free to reach out with any questions.

For context: I’ve only been working in banking for about 4 months, and this would be my first job in finance outside of retail banking. I’m a little nervous because I don’t have much experience, so I’m trying to read between the lines.

Is this second meeting a good sign? What should I be doing right now while I wait to hear back?",2,1747946859.0,recruitinghell,4,1.0,False

1kt1en8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kt1en8,Orea Z1 with new coffee beans,"

I’ve been dialling in the Z1 for a week now and finally feel comfortable using some nicer beans. Whilst they weren’t extortionate the Assembly coffee I picked up was a one off for a pop up so can’t get any more. 

In terms of the Z1 I’ve enjoyed pushing the grind finer, and getting more extraction, but maintaining the acidity and brightness that the sibarist papers have allowed with the faster flow rate. That being said I’m not sure I want to know how much they will charge for papers once they officially announce on the 26th May. 

The mellow dripper provides good consistency of pour, allowing for one of the variables to be more controlled, which is useful for someone new like myself. It took me a long time to get consistent results for v60, but the Z1 was pretty much there after about 4-5 attempts, and all I had to do was focus on grind size, water temperature and volume. Now I’ve tried about 20+ brews it feels very comfortable. 

The Orea carafe that was designed for the Z1 is nice, but feels very tall, especially when the dripper is relatively short in height, but it’s a nice design and fits the dripper perfectly. But realistically not worth the price. However note other Orea carafes don’t fit nor does the Hario v60 server (the ‘ribbed’ one). I’ll also be getting a drip tray for the brewer as it drips a fair amount when you take it off. But I’ve seen these are being 3D printed, and I’m sure Orea will sell them too, for a silly price. 

I’ll be experimenting with more different types of coffee, but so far lighter roasts and naturally processed have really done well with this brewer. Given this I’ll be focusing on funkier (think fermented) beans.

Picture this: it's 9 AM on a Tuesday, and instead of dragging yourself through another boring workout, you're laughing, sweating, and dancing to reggaeton beats with a room full of people who've become your friends. Sound too good to be true. Well, that's exactly what happens every weekday morning in Teo Reyes' [Zumba Orange County](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/zumba-orange-county-free-class-weekdays-at-9-am-tickets-805126323507) studio.

I'll be honest – when I first heard about free Zumba classes, I was skeptical. Free usually means there's a catch, right? But after experiencing what [Teo Reyes](https://sites.google.com/view/zumbaorangecounty/zumba-orange-county-instructor) offers, I understand why she opens his doors without charging a dime for newcomers. He knows that once you feel the energy of his [Zumba Orange County](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/zumba-orange-county-free-class-weekdays-at-9-am-tickets-805126323507) sessions, you'll be hooked.

# Who Is [Teo Reyes](https://sites.google.com/view/zumbaorangecounty/zumba-orange-county-instructor)?

Let me tell you about Teo. This gal has been teaching [Zumba Orange County](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/zumba-orange-county-free-class-weekdays-at-9-am-tickets-805126323507) classes for over 10 years, and it shows in every single move she makes. But here's what's really cool about him – she doesn't act like some fitness guru who's too good for beginners. Teo genuinely cares about every person who walks through his door, whether you're a seasoned dancer or someone who thinks they have two left feet.

I've watched Teo work with students who were convinced they couldn't dance, and within weeks, they're leading the front row. Her approach to [Zumba Orange County](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/zumba-orange-county-free-class-weekdays-at-9-am-tickets-805126323507) instruction isn't about perfection – it's about connection. Connection to the music, to your body, and to the amazing community he's built over the past decade.

What really impressed me about Teo's journey is how she discovered Zumba himself. She wasn't always a fitness instructor. Like many of us, he stumbled into this world looking for something different, something that would make exercise feel less like a chore. That personal experience translates into his teaching style in [Zumba Orange County](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/zumba-orange-county-free-class-weekdays-at-9-am-tickets-805126323507) classes. She gets it because he's been there.

# Three Reasons You Should Try Teo's Free Zumba Orange County Class

# 1. Your Workout Won't Feel Like Punishment Anymore

Here's something nobody tells you about traditional gyms: they can suck the joy out of getting healthy. Treadmills, weight machines, counting reps – it all starts feeling like work after a while. Teo's [Zumba Orange County](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/zumba-orange-county-free-class-weekdays-at-9-am-tickets-805126323507) classes flip that script completely.

During my first session, I was so focused on following the salsa steps and bachata moves that I completely forgot I was burning calories. The hour flew by, and I walked out drenched in sweat but buzzing with energy. That's when it hit me – I'd just completed an intense cardio workout without watching the clock once.

The choreography isn't intimidating either. Teo breaks everything down, shows modifications for different fitness levels, and reminds everyone constantly that there's no wrong way to move your body. Some days the [Zumba Orange County](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/zumba-orange-county-free-class-weekdays-at-9-am-tickets-805126323507) playlist features classic Latin hits, other days it's current pop songs with a danceable beat. The variety keeps things fresh and ensures there's something for everyone's musical taste.

# 2. You'll Find Your Tribe

I used to think group fitness classes were full of judgmental people who'd stare if you messed up. Teo's [Zumba Orange County](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/zumba-orange-county-free-class-weekdays-at-9-am-tickets-805126323507) community proved me completely wrong. The 9 AM crowd has become like a second family to many regulars, and newcomers are welcomed with genuine warmth.

There's something special about starting your day surrounded by people who are all working toward similar goals. The shared experience of learning new dance moves, sweating together, and celebrating small victories creates bonds that extend beyond the studio walls. I've seen friendships form, workout partnerships develop, and confidence levels soar in ways that go far beyond physical fitness.

The morning timing attracts an interesting mix of people too. There are parents who drop their kids at school first, remote workers who want to energize before logging on, retirees who've made fitness a priority, and everyone in between. This diversity makes [Zumba Orange County](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/zumba-orange-county-free-class-weekdays-at-9-am-tickets-805126323507) classes with Teo feel inclusive and real.

# 3. Your Mornings Will Never Be the Same

Before discovering Teo's [Zumba Orange County](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/zumba-orange-county-free-class-weekdays-at-9-am-tickets-805126323507) classes, my mornings were pretty standard – coffee, news, maybe some stretching if I felt ambitious. Now? I wake up actually excited to start my day. There's something magical about moving your body to upbeat music first thing in the morning.

The endorphin rush from a good Zumba session beats any caffeine boost I've ever experienced.

My girlfriend and I (both 22 years old) will be in Spain from July 1st to 31st. We already bought our flights from Belgrade to **Alicante**, but we haven’t booked accommodation yet because we’re undecided:  
Should we stay in **Alicante** or go to **Valencia**?

We noticed that **Airbnb prices are quite a bit lower in Valencia**, and that’s made us think twice.  
Our accommodation budget is **up to €3000 for the month**, and we each have around **€1500 to live and enjoy** while we’re there.

A bit about us:

* We’re digital nomads, so we work remotely.
* We enjoy drinking beer and coffee at bars, but we’re not into clubs.
* We love walking through cities, exploring neighborhoods, hanging out on terraces, places with a good vibe...
* We don’t usually go into nature or take long hikes.
* Being close to the sea would be nice, but **it’s not a must**.

Our goal is to find a good balance between working comfortably and enjoying the city without overspending.

I’d always go out of my way to make friends at a party, get my coworker surprise birthday gifts, bring coffee/snacks to my relatives when i swing by their place. 
I’ve been very blessed in many ways, I don’t pay rent, I have no bills, I’m in my mid 20s and I have traveled to many continents, countries, and most of the US., I’m extremely grateful but did I get on here to brag?? 
Not at all. Since I don’t have bills, I’m able to save $$ and travel (on a budget for most trips). 
So my social media reflects all the pretty things like my trips, my culinary experiences, and fun things I do on the weekend. 
I’m extroverted but extremely private. I never posted my family members, or even my friends on my socials. I don’t tag anyone, I just treat it as it is, a fake social platform that exists as my digital scrapbook. I don’t think much of it, and I never post in real time. I could be sitting on the couch posting about a meal I ate 4 months ago. 
I’m a diagnosed borderline, ocd, adhd, GAD, and complex PTSD. 
I’ve been SA’d due to grooming, molested by family members, both as a minor and as a young adult (19). I suffered from severe body dysmorphia due to being called fat and subjected to verbal abuse by my family members, and nobody stood up for me. 
I have tried to end my life, I have thought about doing it many times and then as I’m on the way I get scared, freaked out and just burst into tears.

I try my best every day to just be this happy go lucky functioning adult, pursuing a career I’m passionate about. 
then I go home to all my demons after a long day of wearing a costume. When I finally opened up, people think I’m lying, or simply don’t believe me because “my life is so perfect” according to them. 
Every day I get up, I put on an outfit, ready to perform and pretend like I’m not being buried under a mountain of pain. Why? 
Because I’m still extremely grateful to have breath in my lungs, to have a functional and healthy body, to sleep in a bed, and three square meals a day. Sometimes I feel extremely misunderstood, because I wish people could just see me not just for how good I have it, but to empathize with some of my pain. I’m doing okay now, I have consistent therapy, and I’m learning to live life on my own terms despite my mental conditions and traumas that were inflicted on me. I’m functional, but sometimes I just need a big hug.

1. Lower the bar until you can’t trip over it.
I used to plan these perfect days that only future-me could pull off. Current-me just got overwhelmed and gave up. Now I aim for small but done. Five minutes of effort > zero minutes of guilt.

2. Your space is setting the tone.
I kept trying to focus while surrounded by clutter, noise, and my phone lighting up like a Christmas tree. Turns out, willpower isn’t stronger than my environment. I started making my space less chaotic, and suddenly I wasn’t fighting myself so much.

3. Attach new habits to dumb, easy stuff.
Trying to “build a routine” felt like launching a startup. Too much. So I started linking habits to things I already did—like stretching while the coffee brews, or journaling after brushing my teeth. It felt stupidly small, but it worked.

4. Don’t spend your best energy on garbage.
I was using all my brainpower on stuff that didn’t matter—doomscrolling, overplanning, worrying about things I wasn’t even doing. Now I ask: Does this deserve my energy? Most things don’t.

5. Give tasks a timestamp, not a vague “someday.”
“I’ll get to it later” turned into weeks of procrastination. Now I slap mini-deadlines on everything. Not to stress myself out—just to stop letting things drift forever. “Do it by 3pm” works way better than “do it eventually.”

6. Make the bad habits annoying.
I didn’t “develop discipline.” I just made it harder to do dumb stuff. Logged out of Instagram, deleted my DoorDash app, buried distractions under friction. If it’s inconvenient, I’m way less likely to do it.

7. Track the reps, not the results.
I used to obsess over progress and feel like a failure if I didn’t see big changes fast. Now I care more about showing up. Did I do the thing today? Cool. That’s the win. The results show up eventually if I keep stacking the reps.

If this hits home, awesome. You’re not lazy, you’re just stuck in a system that rewards easy and punishes effort. But you can change it. Bit by bit. Boring step by boring step.

And that’s way more powerful than some motivational BS anyway.",2,1747946028.0,getdisciplined,0,0.76,False

We were both barista's in our 20's and cannot function without it. I'm not sure I'd get out of bed if it weren't for coffee.

Every morning I make a 51oz French press. My kettle is set to 203° and starts when I stop my alarm via an automation. By the time I'm dressed for work, the water is ready. I'll take 28 oz or so and my wife drinks the rest when she wakes up.
I also brew cold brew concentrate and keep multiple beakers of the stuff in the fridge for our afternoon dose. Sometimes, we get a little heavy handed with the water / concentrate ratio.

What I like about this set up is how forgiving it is. French presses, provided you get the grind/water ratio somewhat close, will consistently make an amazing cup of coffee. I also like how there's no consumables other than the beans, which makes it super easy to keep the flow going.

I definitely don’t have the means or want for a brick and mortar coffee shop right now but I think a coffee cart would be a great idea in this area. There is a private university nearby, lots and lots of festivals/events happening throughout the year and due to the beautiful and rural nature of where I live there are also tons of wedding venues that I think I could find a few good regular spots plus events to set up at. I have a pretty good idea of what my concept would be and lots of connections as well that would hopefully put their faith in me and help me promote/get on my feet starting out. I am aware that it’s a large cost upfront and lots of work but I am pretty lost of where to go from a concept to a full on business in the next year or two. I feel like a lack of confidence and expertise is holding me back but I don’t want to let this go and not see what I could truly accomplish due to fear. I’ve been getting more serious about it in the past few months but the information out there is either vague or costs money.

It is one of those worlds that under most circumstances would be talked of as ""also in the Upper Leaf Swirl there is..."". But yeah, now everybody knows the name of this planet.

It is not a planet with insane heat, or freezing cold. It has a nice eclipse, there is that, but otherwise, unremarkable. 

Proud Warrior Races shudder in fear when the name Earth is said. People that have fought horrors from beyond time and space, and come back with a smile on their lips, turn pale when you drop the word ""you might need to go to Earth"". 

Of course not because of the human weaponery. They managed to build some okayish railguns, but that is it. 

Governments regularly force people to go to Earth. Many sentinent rights organisations view it as cruel and unusual punishment. I tend to agree, and I have been to prison colonies. 

Not because life on earth is bad or anything. Humanity can mix quite good drinks.

Saying ""I need to go to Earth"" evokes sympathy. Tentacles, arms and other appendices are extended. You hear condolences. ""The government should do something about this"" gets muttered, and how sorry everyone is.

I hoped that I would never be in this situation. I hoped I would never see my relatives bidding me goodbye, fearing for me. Fearing for when, and in what state I would return. But I need to do it. I need to venture into the nightmarish dungeons that plaster this godforsaken planet, get out with what I need, and return. I pray that it will be soon, and with my sanity intact.

Dieter sighed. The coffee was cold, Tina from the department of proceedings had stopped responding to his flirting and the aliens were annoying as all hell again. 

""Look, I can't help you. Don't make me the villain here. The rules for getting permit A38 are very easy and clear. You just need to go to room 36, in the sixth floor. Should be in the building of the DMV. There you will find directions to the department for the rules and regulations."" 

Sir'Nak felt the world slipping away from him. He had been wandering various office buildings on Earth for the last three months, always needing another permit, always being sent to another office, and by now he felt his sanity slipping away from him.

Humanity had been discovered 200 years ago, and since last century they had been tasked by the galactic council to take care of aaaaaaaall the bureaucracy that was needed.

I have been in this industry for about 10 years and have done the standard BD type activities - Attending events, lunches, dinners, coffees, drinks, seminars, webinars, blogging and LinkedIn, and none of it has resulted in any productive connections.

While I don't doubt the older generations had success attending ballroom dinners and being members at social and recreational clubs, it just doesn't seem to be what most millennials are interested in or doing (the only folks I know with club memberships are avid participant of the sport the club caters to).

So, millennials, what are you doing that has worked for you to build a professional network that assists in business development? Am I wrong, and people still are joining private clubs? Do I need to go on a $18K Alpha Male retreat? Pay bots for LinkedIn engagement? /s

My baby.

HE’S WORKING FOR LEBLANC.

I shoulda known the moment he started eating spellbooks instead of grenades. I shoulda known when he grew a SECOND FIN out of nowhere and started hovering. And now he’s wearing a little cloak. A BLACK one. With gold trim.

LeBlanc got to him. Probably promised him sushi and shiny rocks.

I raised that boy in chaos and cuddles and this is how he repays me??

“Oh I found a better role model.”
OH REALLY??
DID SHE TEACH YOU HOW TO OPEN A GRENADE WITH YOUR TEETH, HUH??

Powder brought cookies and four types of sabotage explosives. We didn’t tell her Jeff betrayed us. We’re saving it for the rage boost.

Clone Jinx (you know, the “we-share-a-braincell-and-it’s-on-fire” one) is sharpening glitter-coated machetes. She named them “Trust” and “Issues.”

Lightcannon Jinx is charging up like a rainbow death satellite. She sneezed earlier and vaporized a tree. We’re ready.

Negan Jinx just strutted out of the RV in a leather jacket and jeans, swinging Lucille over her shoulder like it’s story time at a blood drive. She’s been itching for a monologue and Leblanc’s skull might just be the perfect microphone.

And then we have Harley Quinn knockoff, LoL Jinx.

Anyways, Has anyone found ways to get in their macros without going over their calories? Its something i've been struggling. So i'm using the Mifflin-St Jeor Calculation, Which set it to 1680cal, Protein is at 125g, Fat i keep around 50g and the remaining goes towards carbs though i try get my carbs a bit higher, generally my lunch has become my biggest meal due to using it as a post workout meal. Reason for it is recovery & normally when i was using 125g rice, i was still hungry afterwards. Anyways, 

Any ideas or advice? For obvious reasons, i don't have a set income so i have to keep costs down, So my chicken source is thighs though i remove the skin, i use a protein powder that's roughly 126cal per serving with 20-25g protein. I generally use 110g steamed mixed veg for the added volume.

But really struggling to get my macros within the calories, I've even begun to limited my coffee and have it black at work to keep the calories down",2,1747945437.0,CICO,1,1.0,False

Where do I go from here???","I dont really have anyone to tell this to in person as to not hurt his reputation, I’ve never confided in reddit for personal relationship issues but honestly i have nowhere else to turn.

Me and my boyfriend have been officially dating for about a month and a half, after talking for around 6 months. He is a very considerate and caring person, and I do love him a lot. He lives pretty far from both of our workplaces, and I work full time, so he’s started staying at my place the majority of the time.

I buy all the groceries, and we cook together. I work early shifts and he works part time, so he often stays in my bed after i leave for work, and hangs out at my home alone for the majority of the day. This has never bothered me as I trust him

recently I bought a can of whipped cream for a dessert i was planning to make this week. it has been sitting in the fridge and I didn’t think anything of it, until he asked if I wanted whipped cream in my coffee this morning. As i went to dispense it, it sputtered, and kind of dribbled out non aerated cream. I was confused and he helped me trouble shoot. I joked that he mustve sucked all the air out and he playfully denied. I googled a soloution for the issue, and all signs pointed to him sucking the air out of the can. Still, he denied, stating it was probably expired, or that it was a malfunction with the can. I believed him but something still felt off. About ten minutes later, i brought it up again, and he finally admitted it.

While i was at work sometime within the last few days, he opened the sealed and full can of whipped cream, and sucked all the air out, in my home. then put it back in the fridge. He claims it was only one “whip-it” but being that the can is empty and hes already lied, im having a hard time believing it. Honestly I have no idea what to do and my trust is pretty broken, i never would’ve expected him to do that nor do it in my home, with my groceries I paid for, while i was away at work. I dont know where to go from here relationship-wise especially since he admitted that if i didnt grill him, he probably never wouldve come clean.",4,1747945437.0,Advice,28,0.83,False

1kt0wqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kt0wqt/am_i_being_led_on/,Am i being led on?,"A month and a half ago i was at a club when i was approached by some random girl (22F) asking about a piece of clothing i was wearing. We started talking and spent an hour talking by the bar, we clicked immediately. When she was leaving she gave me like 3 long hugs and told me that im a good looking guy (not a humble brag, its related to the story) and that she likes me and that i should invite her for a coffee or something. I said sure, she told me her schedule and we followed eachother on instagram.

Around a week later i invited her out for a date, we went out for some drinks and we spent a few hours just talking, nothing physical.

Tomorrow we started chatting on instagram and since then we've been chatting all day every day. In the following week or two, we went out a few more times, each time she would tel me how she had a lovely time and how she really enjoys my company. 

So after our 4th date or so, while walking her to her apartment and hugging her goodbye, i attempted to kiss her. She turned her head, said something unrelated (she was uncomfortable) and left. 

When i got home i asked her if i missjudged our situation and she said no, she likes me but she doesn't wanna rush anything. I agreed and i understood. This was a month ago. 

Since then we kept chatting on a daily basis, and seeing eachother 2-3 times a week. i met her sisters, she told her mom about me etc. She talks about going to trips together, asked me if i wanted to go on some concert thats in October etc. Again mentioned how she likes me a few more times. I never did this much for a girl that is not even my girlfriend - taking her out for dinner, helping her with random stuff, paying for every single thing etc. 

Which all seems fine but there has been literally 0 physical connection between us. Only hugs when we say hello and goodbye. Now, again, i dont mean to humble brag but we're both good looking people and i never had issues with getting girls. Since the failed kiss attempt, i haven't tried being physical as thinking about that situation still stings me. 

Even if i wanted to, she never gave me any chances (clear or not) to make *any* move.
Now i am losing my patience, a month and a half of 'dating' with not even a kiss is pretty wild and even worse is that i feel guilty for thinking about giving other girls a chance, even though i have no reason to.


A little background about her - she's a very smart girl with her own business, she just moved to this country a few years ago from pretty far away, has been in a 1.5 year relationship until 5 months ago and said that was by far her longest relationship.
Another important detail, she only seems to have male friends. I am talking tens of guy friends and like 1-2 girl friends. Am i just one of the guy friends who keeps her company and pays for food and drinks?",1,1747945364.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

3. We were joking around saying ""I feel like this or that emoji,"" and he said, “I’m the one with hearts in the eyes” (about himself).

4. For the past two weeks, he’s been constantly complimenting me — like how he always defends me if people talk bad about me, and he says only the best things about my personality.


5. My friend told him I wasn’t coming for coffee because my stomach hurt, and within a minute he called to ask if I wanted him to bring me medicine. My friend joked, “He just wants you to stay at the coffee hangout.”


6. We were walking home and I mentioned something about a furniture store, and we started talking about it. He said, “We’ll go there someday to pick out furniture,” and joked that we’d be rating furniture “for our future house together.”


7. My friend, him and I were talking about situation #1, and he mentioned we went out to smoke at 4 a.m. at the cabin. Then he said, “I told (me) not to tell anyone I had cigarettes or that we went out to smoke — if anyone asks where we were, just say we went to fuck.

Also has anyone with ADHD ever tried Visanne?","I was diagnosed with PMDD and endometriosis. My periods and the week leading up to them are horrible. I basically get a 10-day long stomach flu (severe nausea, daily diarrhea) with daily or bidaily migraines, intense pelvic pain, clotting, terrible, long-lasting fatigue and depression. Add to that screaming at myself to get out of my horizontal position to catch up on everything that falls behind and existence is basically a nightmare. It's not exactly a cake-walk the rest of the time but my periods are hell.

In the last 5 days alone I can say with confidence that I've been asleep more hours than I've been awake, and when I'm awake I'm wanting to tear my hair out for the motivation to get up and work. When I do get up, the pain, nausea and exhaustion intensifies. Coffee, changes in diet, affirmations and/or self-deprecation doesn't touch this shit. The only thing that reliably helps is water, tylenol and tons of sleep. 

I'm going to be trying Visanne soon since my gyno (which took me years to get, I live in Canada) is unfortunately too hesitant to do any surgery on me. People in the endometriosis club tell me it's a bandaid-fix, and on top of that I have a phobia of medication, but I can't stand this anymore. I'm wondering if anyone has had any experience with it and how it may have affected their ADHD behaviours if they gave the treatment an honest go. Apart from 20mgs of escitalopram and asthma medication I'm not taking anything else at the moment.

He lives 25 miles away (we live in the contry, not the cities, if that is relevant). I needed a new fridge, we got a free one on FB Marketplace, but it's big. Husband said he'd come to move it in, so I let son know he would have to be away (long story, but it's a legal thing). I have copied the texts (that weren't blocked) from this morning. I just don't know if I am letting him gaslight me or if I have a reason to have slammed the door in his face when he started in on me the moment I opened the door?
ME: I feel pretty good. I just took a shower and decided to have a good day...no matter what.
I love you.
Gonna air dry, maybe have another cup of coffee... then get dressed (once I'm completely dry, that is).
And don't tell me to ""Call"". I just wanted to send a message, not sit on the phone...

HIM: Ok baby lm going to get tea then cum to you, love you by.

8:14 AM
HIM: OK   8:15 AM
ME: Enthusiasm, yay. 8:15 AM

 
He comes over and started yelling at me for parking my truck where he wants to park, then for not being ready to come outside to move the fridge Iwas dressed but didn't have shoes on yet. Last I'd known, he'd locked his keys in his van and I did not know he had gotten into it and was on his way. He had called to let me know he couldn't get into his van at 8:16 AM. He called at 9:05 AM to let me know he was outside my house. 
I opened the door, he was already upset. Probably from locking his keys in the van, but he started yelling at me the moment I opened the door. I let him know I'd told him not to expect me to be ready right when he got here, I didn't need long, just put on some shoes. He got progressively more angry, demanding my keys to my truck ( they weren't where I usually leave them, so I think he was upset he had to ask me for them). I let him know I wasn't going to have him yell at me, I didn't do anything wrong. I know he hates to have to wait for me, but i didn't know he'd gotten into his van let alone was on his way. I let him know I'd already told him I may not be ready, so why is he angry?

ME: 9:34 am Thursday, May 22 To think, I looked forward to seeing you... You looked forward to yelling at me. How sad. I told you, I am going to have a good day, too bad you don't want to be a part of it.

ME: 9:43 AM, May 22
I don't like the way you treat me. You are not going to change. I deserve respect. We both deserve to be happy. You are never happy when you are around me. I can't spend my whole life fighting to keep us together. You wanted to be pissed off, and I don't want to be bullied into yet another fight. There's no fucking reason for this behavior. What reason did you have to start bitching at me the moment I opened the door?
Look, it's obvious that you don't like being with me, so don't be. I don't want to live my life with someone who doesn't treat me with love and respect.... we both know, YOU NEVER APOLOGIZE and YOU ARE NEVER WRONG. I doubt I will see you again, because I am not going to try to fix this, I didn't do anything wrong and you will never admit that you are wrong.

I am, obviously, going to have to block your number so I don't have to read your nasty texts trying to gaslight me into thinking you had any reason to lash out at me the way you did, the way you always do...you are welcome to visit me any time you are willing to treat me with love and respect... which is sadly why I predicted I won't ever see you again... you don't want to.

ME: 9:59 AM, May 22
My last message, I just want you to know that I love you. I treat you with love and respect...I just want the same, too... you have never had to ask if I really care about you....it's never been a question.... but I don't get to say the same. You take your love and use it to hurt me... screaming divorce every other day...I don't want to live like that... love isn't meant to be used against someone. I love you. I love vou. I LOVE YOU!

ME: 10:40 AM, May 22
I guess I was wrong about that being the last text due to the surgery center calling (and Dr. Harden also called) my surgery is scheduled for 9:30am Wednesday May 28. I won't expect that you will drive me seeing as I don't even know if I will see you again since I have already mentioned that I will not be fixing this fight. I aready tried to avoid this when letting you know that I may not be ready when you came, and to not get mad about it, or wait to come until I was dried and dressed... but we see how well that worked.... Dr. Harden called while I was on the phone with the surgery center. When I called back he said he'd call me back in an hour, he did say he believes I need to come in for further testing. I will unblock your number for as long as you can treat me with at least basic respect... since love seems to be a bit much to ask at the moment. I am not fighting you, I have no reason to spend the day pissed off and in a text/call war with you.l just want to have a good day.
HIM: No you don't No you don't No you Don't Tell your children to get there license throw garbage bags can you move your Fucking truck, pick up dog shit.
10:48 AM
ME: Okay, obviously you can't be civil.
10:49 AM
ME: I didn't do anything wrong, and Damn I'm tired of having to say that... I even let you know, before you left your house, that I was not ready....
ME: I am not going to go back and forth with you, ruining both our days.
Do you want me to call you after the doctor calls me back?
10:51 AM
HIM: You and your children have a good day every fucking day, all three of you stay in your house day in winter you have heat n summer AC that's Your good days every day.
10:53 AM
ME: So that is a no.
Good to know where I stand. 10:53 AM

HIM: Quit texting and Call me is that a yes?.
10:55 AM
Take I stance with your children
Not me
10:56 AM
You text me SO much you fucking wear down my battery.
10:58 AM
You have no respect for me whatsoever if you did you would help me not hurt me

1kt0qs4,https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/1kt0qs4/jury_duty_a_guide/,Jury Duty - A Guide,"I was summoned for jury duty recently at the courthouse on University Ave. In trying to figure out what to expect I did quite a bit of research and nothing was actually accurate to how the day went so I figured I should share my experience so you know what to expect if you ever get called. 
1. Arrival time is usually at 8:30. If you’re driving your best bet is the Green P under Nathan Phillips Square because it has a reasonable daily max (for the area). You’ll have to go through security and expect to stand in line outside as everyone arrives at the same time. They will let you bring food and drinks in. 
2. Expect to spend most of your day waiting so bring books, work, and a phone charger so you can entertain yourself. You essentially will have to wait inside of a “lounge” that feels like a Service Ontario until it’s time to go to the courtroom. Also the wi-fi sucks so keep that in mind if you plan to work or stream anything. 
3. There is NO opportunity when you arrive to present a reason you should be excused. If you need to be excused and have a good reason email them ahead of time as it can save you a trip. Otherwise you’ll have to wait until it’s your turn to go before the judge. 
4. Eventually the whole group will get called to go into the courtroom where you’ll be briefed on the case you’d be juror for and they’ll explain the selection process. At this stage people are called by lottery system and if you get called you’ll be grouped up with 12-20 others and sent to a different room where you’ll fill in a questionnaire. This is your opportunity to highlight if there’s any reason why you shouldn’t be selected (I.e. know someone involved, health reasons, financial reasons). You’ll then wait to be called before the judge individually where they’ll decide if you’ll be excused or add you to the jury. 
If you aren’t called into a group, don’t get excited. You go back to the waiting area and sit around in case they need more potential jurors or are needed for another trial. Don’t bother asking the clerks when you can leave or how many days you’ll be here because they have no clue. 361 University is one of the busiest court houses in Ontario so it’s very possible they’ll have more than one jury trial in the span of a week. 
If you’re called before the judge and the excused. Also don’t get excited. You get sent back to the “lounge” as you’ve only been excused from that trial, not jury duty itself.  
You’ll wait around until just before 5 barring any other updates and will be told at that point if you are dismissed or if you have to return the following day. 
5. There is a lunch break at around 1pm for a bit more than an hour and you are allowed to take breaks. So if you need to grab a coffee or take a smoke break you can. You’ll just have to come back in through security. 
6. Nobody communicates with one another. We were kept for an hour longer than we were supposed to be purely because of a lack of communication between staff. ",40,1747944967.0,toronto,27,0.92,False

I saw someone say Porter is basically a parking lot & shopping mall, so thinking of nixing that one...

Union's Bow Market looks cool, might end there for a victory beer & empanada.

Thought I'd give this a try and put myself out there. :)

A little bit about me: 

• My idea of a perfect day would be trying out a nice restaurant, coupled with seeing a movie at the theatre. I am a bit of a foodie and love exploring new places. Though I also love a nice time indoors like watching a movie at home, reading a book, playing a couple games & learning new recipes to cook. 

• I am ambitious and am thankful to say I am in a field I am passionate about. That being said I love simplicity and find comfort in routine, whether it be going for walks, getting coffee, or catching the sunset by the pier.

• Some of my all time favorite movies are ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Dodgeball"", and my favorite shows are ""The Simpsons"", Family Guy and ""The Good Place"" Always open to new movie and TV show suggestions! 

If I sound like your kind of person, I would love to hear from you!

1kt0ncs,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1kt0ncs/why_do_i_still_see_my_ex_in_my_dreams_why_do_i/,Why do I still see my ex in my dreams? Why do I have trouble falling asleep. Its been 4.5 months,"it's been 4.5 months since we broke up and I still see her in my dreams. She is already dating someone new and idk why why do i still see her in my dreams.

Exactly two years ago, my ex first approached me. She chased me for months, even after I told her I wasn’t interested in being in a relationship with anyone. We ended up dating for a year and a half.

When she recently reached out after seeing a bunch of our old memories on Snapchat, she told me she had started to resent me back then. She said it was because I didn’t put in any effort while she was constantly the one pursuing me, even though I did put in effort throughout our actual relationship.

She also said that I only started to really see her once she made it clear she wanted to be physical. I was her first, and she was mine. At the time, I thought she only wanted that to get over me, but after it happened, I realized I was actually in love with her. I also felt regretful for not asking her to be my girlfriend before we got physical. I had planned to ask, but she ended up asking me first. Of course, I said yes.

Before that, when she had asked multiple times about being together, I told her I just wanted to be friends. That was before we got physical. But once that happened, I felt like I was madly in love with her.

I’ve had women approach me before, but never anyone who fought for me like she did. It’s crazy because I ended up in the position girls are usually in, being the one who’s chased.

She also pointed out how her new boyfriend plans every single date, while I never did that when we were first talking. She mentioned how she always had to ask me to hang out and how I would often cancel. Now, her new boyfriend plans big, thoughtful dates and things like that.

Then she said she wanted to break up because she was moving far away and couldn’t commit to a long-distance relationship. She told me she wanted to explore her options in the new city. But it turns out I was wrong about her reasons, because she started dating the first guy who approached her in a coffee shop. And she had been approached before. What devastated me the most was finding out that just one month after our breakup, she started a relationship that is actually an even longer long-distance situation than what she would have had with me. Also her new boyfriend looks awful a lot worse than me. There are definitely better looking dudes out there that will provide you the same treatment. I was as well, but bringing up the past isn't how it works, and if you communicated to me about what we needed to work on, I would have, but you didn't.

Since our breakup, she has broken no contact a few times, reaching out every now and then, even though she was the one who ended things.

So ladies, have you ever chased or approached your ex or boyfriend? And guys, have you ever been the one who was chased by a woman? Obviously many girls have, but are there any dudes out here that have been through this situation?",4,1747944738.0,BreakUps,8,0.84,False
