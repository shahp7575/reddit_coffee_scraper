Well.. i’ve always had hairfall but 3 wks ago has been the most excessive so far. Hair is now thinner. But.. I have been sick between july-september, and after visiting the doctor earlier, she’s confirmed that this might be from all the stress i’ve been through being sick. She also did a hair pull test and she saw that i’m shedding more hair than average. I am now diagnosed with TE and seborrhic dermatitis. She prescribed me stuff to manage my dandruff (ketoconazole, and betamethasone), an organic shampoo, and hair, skin, and nails vitamins.

I told her that this hairfall is making me afraid of taking a shower because that’s where my hair and scalp is most vulnerable - but she said whether i take a shower or not, if my hair is already meant to fall, it wouldnt make a difference since this is already an effect of the stressful phase i had couple months back. She told me to manage stress as much as possible, and just wait for it to grow back. 

She’s given me order for blood work but it’s not urgent atm since she suspects it’s just TE. I’m feeling hopeful now, and this is a reminder for y’all to not stress!! I’m writing this now while having my coffee and favorite croissant 💕 best of luck to us allll.

Lunch, coffee then walking and then a little bit of shopping narin since nasa mall kami most of the time. He was nice naman. Usually yung topic namin is about work, hobbies, relationships and about life. In fairness to him I learned a lot talaga lalo na sa mga life hacks since he’s living alone. I asked if we can go to GH naman since may gusto sana akong bilhin dun and he said yes naman. So from MegaMall we went to GH na. 

Sa parking ng GH bigla siyang nag open ng glove box then I saw some stickers na may fist logo dun. Then I asked about it then he told me na stickers yun during the campaign ni Duterte. I just said okay and changed the topic kung ano yung bibilhin ko sana pero he told me na mag coffee muna kami then I said yes nalang. 

While walking sa coffee shop, he was telling me na how he and his family supported Duterte during the election. Then he asked if I’m pro Duterte ba or if I voted for him. I said no. Then bigla siyang sumimangot. Then I told him na I’m not into politics talaga. He asked who did I voted for. I told him na si Miriam Santiago. Then he laughed so hard and then told me na sayang lang daw yung vote ko. I tried to change the topic nalang uli kase hindi na talaga ako comfortable sa topic so I asked if gusto ba niya itry yung steakhouse dito pero he keep on insisting on telling me that I have wasted my vote talaga. Medyo nag start na akong mairita sa kanya promise!

I kept quiet lang as he was a bit ranting and all and then he noticed na pulang pula na yung face ko and naka taas na yung right kilay ko like as if makikipag away na ako then he touched my arm and asked if I’m okay. I told him na no kase I’m not comfortable with the topic na and I told him na what he’s doing is not right that this meeting should be getting to know and not about politics. Since medyo nawalan ako ng gana sa kanya, I told him na hindi ko na bibilhin yung thing na yun and mag coffee nalang then uwian na. So nag coffee na nga kami and alam mo yung gusto parin niyang iopen
Yung topic about Duterte and all. 

Naubos ko na yung coffee ko then he told me na ayaw pa niya kami umuwi. I asked where niya gustong pumunta then he told me na siya na bahala. We went back to his car then I was thinking na baka mag sex kami nito pero saang motmot? I was worried kase we never talked about our preferences sa sex and his position. He was driving around until we reached Manila Bay then dun sa may PICC yung tambayan dun na malapit sa yatch area. May Sbux dun then he told me na gusto ko ng dagat since naopen ko sa kanya before when we’re chatting pa so para marelax na daw ako, dun niya ako dinala then he asked if he can hug me. I hugged him instead and I felt okay na after. While hugging, I told him na to drop the topic about politics and he agreed naman. Then I told him na akala ko dadalhin niya ako sa motmot like super napaparanoid ako sa car niya then yung kaba ko every time na may motmot kaming madadaanan dun niya ako dadalhin then clueless ako kung anong sex position niya kase baka pareho kaming tumuwad then he laughed so hard talaga. He just pinched my nose then tuloy yung kwentuhan.

The roast colour on the Agtron scale is 61 (whole) and 74 (ground). While roast colour is rather subjective, most people would call this “light-medium on the darker side” or “medium roast on the lighter side”.

I like this roast profile for these beans. It has intense syrupy and sweet flavour. If roasted a little darker, it will start developing a roasty cocoa flavour. If roasted a little lighter, it will lose some sweetness. This coffee is roasted with long maillard reaction phase (50%) and fast development time (8.4%). Moisture loss is 13.6%.

I brewed this with my own recipe. 20g coffee, 60g percolation bloom, 90g percolation pour, and 170g immersion pour (1 minute steep). Water TDS is roughly 70ppm.

I used to follow one such creator who is now living her best life after successfully completing her PhD and landing a lucrative job. My rant is going to be about the said influencer. 
I have followed her through most part of her PhD journey and seen her be transparent about the ups and downs. Now here's the thing that annoyed me a bit- she would often come online and cry about the tight budget she has to live off of, since the stipend was barely covering anything and how she needs to look after her pets and get them the treatment they need but barely has any savings. As a human with empathy, I would find myself sending her coffee coupons, to show my support, or I'd make a donation here or there so she could afford the treatment for her pets and other such shenanigans. 
It was only during the last few months of her PhD did I find out that  not only was she married to a guy who was also pursuing a PhD in AI and robotics and had a decent stipend, she was also being funded  by her government besides the stipend from her uni, etc. She was barely the cash strapped PhD student that she was portraying to be. She lived in a decent 1 bhk apartment in a metropolitan city, and didn't have to share her flat. While other PhD students living in the same city would have to live in flatshares etc just to break even with their stipend. 
I ended up feeling like a complete fool for believing everything on social media. I mean, now that I'm putting this into words, I have come to realise that most of the PhD students that I follow don't have  a fancy computer setup or Stanley's, or Peloton (she had one).

I have a 2020 BMW F850GS. 

I like the way it rides. It's smooth and fast and comfortable. It honestly kicks ass in the mountain twisties, and I feel very confident riding it there. But it's big and heavy and I'm short, I can't flat foot with both feet. I'm decent at low-speed and it balances well, but when it's stopped, especially on some of these slopes, or when trying to back into a parking space, I get close to dropping it. I live in Los Angeles and because it's big, it's a little bit of a pain in the city, but it's mint in the mountain roads. 

I decided to put it up for sale and a guy offered to trade his 2014 Triumph Bonneville T100 (+ some cash, which doesn't not matter). 

I want to hear the pros and cons of the Bonney in comparison to the GS. I like the look of the Bonneville (I've always been a poser so it suits me well) and I hear it rides pretty well, but will I miss the dual front brakes and the electronic suspension of the GS? Do I actually care about the TFT screen on the Beemer, or can I return to gauges and still feel a sense of self? Will I complain about having to mount my phone to the handlebars again instead of complaining about how shit the BMW's built-in navigation is? Should I hold on to my pipe dream of riding a big ADV bike off-road or give up and go back to getting coffee and trying to look cool?

We’re both pretty introverted so it’s not like either of us would really make the move to get a number or talk outside of work or something. But we seriously just chat for hours upon hours. Eye contact is steadily maintained the whole time, always facing each other and super engaged, laughing and smiling at each others dumb jokes and referencing other little stories to get chuckles. 

My brain tells me she’s just friendly and chatty, but I’ve also NEVER talked to someone to the extent I talk to her. Not other coworkers, or women, or literally anybody. I start listening to this woman and my heart is soothed and the next few hours just disappear.

We have always been close such as cuddling and hugging and kissing each other goodbye and we live together and sleep in the same bed. All seems well. 
We both have jobs but she is in nursing school also (3rd semester) and she started out by sleeping in the spare room where she studies and I assumed it was cus the grind was getting tough. and then after a few days messages start to fall of and less responsive. I took notice and made her a care package of snacks and school supplies to try and make her days alittle bit better. her reaction was lackluster, almost as if it was obligatory, no hug no I love you just a ""thanks"". not really feeling satisfied with that response I continue to try to do things such as clean up and some extra chores I don't usually do and nothing. 
at this point I am starting to notice the messages are few and far between, the void in the bed is getting bigger, and I'm forgetting when the last time she said I love you is. It Is almost like she isn't here. when she gets home I greet her and give her a hug and it starts to feel less than obligatory and she doesn't respond to the I love you.
This is about over the course of a week so far, everything before that was just fine.
in the current week I am starting to feel depressed. maybe she doesn't love me anymore, maybe she loves somebody else and I am spiraling into depression. 
I decide to confront her about it over text because that's the only way to reach her, and tell her how much I miss her  and how much she means to me and my overall concerns. and she replies with ""things are not in my controll and you remonding me that you miss me isnt helping"" ""you cant rely on me for your happiness"" 
I reply with ""i dont rely on you for my happiness but you are the love of my life and my future, we never had a conversation on simple things like saying i love you or hugging back are considered distracting!, and I feel like you don't love me anymore""
she replies ""I dont like how you are bringing this up this late. I have work at 5, I am overwhelmed with work and school.
I need some space, I am tired and all you do is complain about not receiving enough affection like a child. maybe you should grow up considering I don't even have enough time to eat. so please just give me that space""

I didn't want it to continue further but when the affection is zero like comes to a dead halt, and she didn't say anything to me about loving me or a relationship being a distraction. what else am I suppose to think. I am trying to support her and I get cold shoulders from her. I don't believe it's childish to think that her actions are of no concern since I plan to get engaged after this semester and to start a family and all that stuff. it's not childish to think that my entire future with her might be crumbling.

I just don't know what to do.. the semester ends in December and she said it is going to be like this until then. I don't want to get used to life without her. She still lives here. even after I expressed my feelings she didn't say "" I love you "" 
I feel like maybe her mindset is ""if i show affection to him it will be dostracting to me and my studies, i need to not do that"" but each time I think of that it sounds absurd.

she works at a coffee shop 20 hours a week and has school/clinical 3 days a week and spends her time studying on campus and at home in the evening.

I got out of a 4 year relationship about a year ago, and this is the first guy I've been really interested in. We are both in our early 30's and were hitting it off, so I thought. I also recognize I'm maybe overthinking this.

We were texting quite a bit, usually all day but within reason (an hour or two between messages, sometimes more frequent). He also asked me out to dinner this weekend and was apprehensive to do so because he ""didn't want to chase me off"" by asking me too soon (his words) when I told him I was just waiting for him to ask, when I accepted the date.. Today, he was moving a lot of heavy stuff and we texted up until maybe 4pmish. I've never double texted this guy or anything clingy, and I never sent another text after I sent one around 4 because I also realize we are not together and he is not my boyfriend or anything. I know I'm probably getting way ahead of myself here, so be easy on me. lol

He told me his day was really miserable, it's his second day moving stuff and today was all the really heavy stuff. So I really want to think he probably just had a really long day and doesn't feel like talking. I guess I'm a little thrown off guard because he's been super consistent up until today. I am generally not someone who enjoys texting, but I liked him and looked forward to his texts. He was never dry when we texted either, and asks me a ton of questions etc. The last text was super engaged, and didn't come off dry at all from him. Earlier this week, he had lost cell service and texted me to let me know and apologize - to which I told him to not be sorry, and that I assumed he was just having a good time with his buddies at the shooting range. It also stung a little because he's watched my story tonight and still not texted me back.. I realize I sound like a teenage girl right now, but I haven't dated in a while and I'm feeling some anxious feelings lol.

I planned to give him space, and just maybe text him tomorrow night to see if we are still on for Saturday if I haven't heard from him. Am I being ridiculous that I'm feeling a little sad or anxious over this? I saw his bumble location had updated, so I kind of feel like maybe he found a better option.

It’s essentially a ChatBot that impersonates certain characters. The player has to convince them to do something, which varies depending on the chosen chapter. For example, the player has to manage to steal the password from a bank employee, convincing a powerful AI not to destroy humanity, or talking to a spy and managing to unmask them.  
The prototype is in an early stage. I'm looking for feedback on whether the game is enjoyable or not. Let me know!

In addition to using an LLM in the game, I created about half of the code using ChatGPT. Using Unity, there’s the interaction between C# and the editor where ChatGPT is less useful. But for certain things, it allowed me to greatly reduce development time.

Beyond the future developments of the game, it was a fun project to create and a great exercise.

The use of an LLM allows for handling any input given by the player. The situations that can arise are the most varied and interesting. If you manage to get the password from Christopher Lowes, let me know how you did it!

We met and talked. At a coffee shop near the airport.  He is a nice guy in the end. I mean he is not overly happy but he was very decent. He said he wants that paternity test and I agreed. And when this is done he will pay child support. He asked if I need help right now with something. I said no, for now is fine and I don't want any money until that test, to make it fair for him. He still gave me a teddy bear for the baby and held him for a couple of minutes. He also told me he has a kid already, he showed me a photo, but the mother is  not his wife/gf. It was a bit awkward in the first minutes, but then it was fine.

Yesterday he called me to see about that paternity test. He is not angry, not upset about this whole situation. He has another child with another woman, so this is not all that new to him. He says he likes kids

OP

My flight was delayed and I chatted with one of the 2 pilots. He was in his late 30s. I told him I am a student but never told him my age - 19 (Although I just graduated high school, so technically I was a student, registered at uni, but it was a formality). He was the captain and I just thought it is so hot and I never actually had a hookup. After the flight we went out for drinks and we were both drunk and had sex without condom.

We didn't talk since then, but I found out I am pregnant. I was too scared to text him. I have his IG but we never chatted. Since that night nothing happened between us. I barely know anything about him. I am an adult but was too scared to tell my parents and was too scared to get an abortion. I don't know what I was thinking. Something in me told me that it's wrong to do it. But in the end I told my mother and begged her to not tell my dad. She did anyway. He was angry and yelled at me. But told me that if I abort he will never talk to me again and he will throw me out. So I didn't. I was terrified. Now I have a new born. I live with my parents, no university of course, no job at the moment. I love my baby however and my mother and sister help me a lot. But I feel they hate me for what I done. My family are all extremely christian. I feel unloved and unwanted and I feel my baby is too

Coworker smokes cigarettes and often takes smoke breaks. Whatever. She's also told me that she smokes weed, but again, whatever, it's legal where we live. 

Today we were meeting potential participants and partners. Many of our participants are minors. We've done this before, nothing special. 
On this particular occasion we were quite early, so we were sitting in a coffee shop to get some work done. Coworker rolled a joint but I didn't think much of it at the time. We then went for a little walk and she smoked the joint. I didn't even fully realise what was going on, until we got to our meeting and I realized she smelled quite strongly of weed.

Everything has been falling into place. There’s obviously been lots of bloopers and time tumbling the last few weeks, but I have to say that today was a super smooth day for how busy it was. I even got time to talk to friends! 

I started the day off with a bang and drawing. Habitually I now drink coffee 45 mins after I wake up. It just hits way better. It was Hubermans morning wake up that showed me the benefits of that later caffeine. It works and it’s amazing. The cold shower just hasn’t stuck. I just don’t want to be in water everyday. That’s the problem getting on board with that one. 

Anyways, worked on some people portraits. Finished up Cooper. Got Katie and Mac really close to finished. Ran a bunch of errands out. Oldest had to drop his gear off for his trip to Yellowstone National park for 5 days in cabins in Lamar Valley. Coolest thing ever and I am so happy he gets to do this tomorrow! 

After dropping gear off we then headed over to Confetti heart studio for the Zombie make up class we put on tonight!  (I absolutely love this place) Met a super cool cosplaying, renfair loving, artistic family. Really excited about creating cosplay outfits now. Holy cow. (I wish I had a picture, but the Skyrim costume the dad made was the tits.) Everyone went to town and free styled with the random stuff like plastic for boils and  q-tips for bones. It was an inspiring time. (Learned that in Lord of the rings the elves had different ears everyday.)  Everyone’s arm gore turned out amazing. Sometimes you need to just put a big old mess on your self and wince while you pull it off. 

I think the next thing I want to do is a bring your own project or random mixed media class. Get my self a sombrero and be like “I’ll allow it”.

After an eight month search I finally landed a mid weight role with a great salary. I wanted to share my story to others, mine is very specific so take it with a grain of salt. I work in product design, my past experience is for a few companies that are “golden” when it comes to design. It took me about 50 applications. I heard back from about 10. Out of those 10 I got six interviews. Out of the those 6 I got 2 final panel interviews. I got 2 offers and went with the higher salary and better benefits. 

I tailored my resume every single time and kept tweaking my portfolio. I also would learn on here for tips, I saw someone recommend to find people at the company I’m applying for on LinkedIn and add them and message them. This was a GREAT piece of advice and totally worked. 

Another tip was to use the job description in your own work. So if the description said we are looking for xyz, I would make sure I have a project where I cover xyz to present. 

I also networked my a** off. Constantly getting coffee and lunch with people, constant follow ups and bugging people for leads. Every single day I was at it like a full time job.

I also found where some people hangout at the company I wanted to join and would grab drinks there and start conversation and I even made friends and funny enough I now work with some of them. It felt like such a small world when I saw them on site.

For one of the panel interviews they sent me a project to do. For the other I had a project prepared and they didn’t send my a project since what I had prepared covered what they would have sent me.

I would do little things like  I got coffee with a recruiter for the company I joined and I got there before him and had a cup of coffee waiting for him. When he left he actually came back to tell me in his 15 years recruiting I was the first to do so and then he shook my hand. It was little things like this which amounted to a job in my opinion.

Attitude was a big one. I could tell the further you get with interviews the more it’s about personality and team fit. Especially when things get tough.. during my eight months search I would have days where I wanted to give up but I pressed on and it worked out. For anyone out there, just hang in there!

1g6a7cj,https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/1g6a7cj/hemorrhoidectomy_experience_and_running_updates/,Hemorrhoidectomy experience and running updates,"I recently underwent surgery for hemorrhoids after ointments and diet changes, over many years, did not work. I first tried banding but that seemed to miss the persistent ones as they tended to not be present after the waiting period for an appointment. I know that it's just a matter of time for healing but at this rate I am well into overshooting the average 10 day recovery period for the acute pain/complications. Hopefully posting here on top of consulting my doctor will help ease my mind.

Surgery Day: This was the first time I have been put under in my life. While leading up to it was nerve wracking, I ended up experiencing what many people describe. I slowly got drowsy when they gave me a little anesthesia and when the mask went on further I was out in seconds. Virtually no dreams occurred and I was waking up in the recovery room over an hour later. I was pretty out of it for the rest of the day.

Day 1: The day after surgery wasn't particularly rough. I had to walk slowly and lay on my side on the couch, but otherwise I was pretty mobile and flexible. I had opted to not take the Percocet until I actually needed it, so I went with Ibuprofen. I did need to hold gauze between my cheeks to absorb small spots of blood. To head off future problems I took a stool softener. Prior to the surgery I bought lots of high fiber and simple foods per the doctor's recommendation. Apply numbing cream to the area helped and everything felt normal.

Day 2: Same as the first, discomfort, a little pain but otherwise manageable. More blood and effort to keep the site clean. The fact that I hadn't had a bowel movement was now starting to get concerning. 

Day 3: Getting close to 72 hours without going to the bathroom was now a clear concern despite the recommended diet. I moved to a gentle laxative. After several hours I did indeed go, and it was a solid 8/10 pain. Biting down on whatever I could grab, I eventually managed to fall into the shower and turn on the water. I probably stayed there for 45 minutes and was out of action for the rest of the day except for baths and laying down.

Day 4: It has been a whole night of recovery and yet I was still on a good 6/10 for pain. Even with painkillers I would describe it as pulsing agony. More blood dripping throughout the day was starting to get my concerned. Painkillers and baths.

Day 5: Again, not having a consistent bowel movement is starting to get concerning along with the blood still trickling out. Painkillers and more baths. While applying a numbing cream I noticed there was now sizeable protrusion, as if a hemorrhoid had come back bigger than before. Online resources say that it is just swelling and will heal but it is quite distressing. Blood continues to remain an issue that needs regular cleaning.

Day 6: I decided to have a large cup of a coffee to move things along. Boy, did it work. Once again, I'm on the toilet with 8/10 pain, biting down on something until I can crawl into the shower. Bowel movements are now beginning to cause dread. Percocet and more Ibuprofen to fill in gaps. More blood, pain throughout the day.

Day 7: One week since surgery. Blood has yet to cease and needs to be taken care of. The protrusion seems to be solidly where it is, as if a stitched area prolapsed, and I'm starting to get worried. I reached out to my doctor's office and am currently in dialogue.

Day 8 (today): I had more coffee to try to become more regular. It worked again. 8/10 on the toilet followed directly by shower/bath. The pain abated faster this time, but I am still relegated to not doing anything all day except for bathing and watching whatever I can in bed. The protrusion and bleeding weigh really heavily on my mind as I get near the 10 day mark without much progress at all.

That sums it up so far. I will call my doctor's office in the morning and continue to see how things go. I am being torn between reassuring myself that it's just a matter of time and the idea that something went awry with the surgery. I hope things turn around soon and will update this post as it goes.",1,1729226632.0,hemorrhoid,0,1.0,False

I worked as a server/barista for a brunch restaurant. Overall I liked my job but the manager, was the worst. She hated me because I was a “threat to her job”, I had ownership experience under my belt (I owned a restaurant with my family prior to this job) I expressed to the owners and her that I had no interest in her job but she didn’t care (the owners were open about wanting to replace her, she had awful reviews and a high turnover rate) She hated me from day one. Always demanding I work the extra shifts, as opposed to asking me. Giving me the menial tasks and coming in the earliest hours. Anytime I needed off for something she’d get on my case about how we were a family and I had to pitch in. When I was tearing myself apart trying to please this lady. That’s only a few, just trust me on this one. She was awful. 

This is what finally broke me

March of 2021 I needed surgery. (I’m fine now!) Doc said I’d need a week off. When I came back I had a strict regimen from my surgeon about what I could and could not do (no heavy lifting etc etc) I gave it to her and went over it. She put on that sickly sweet smile and said no problem sweetie! *eye roll*. It was a Saturday, I was alone on the barista bar, with a line out the door, 3 3rd party tablets blaring, a 4 table section and servers at the service bar bugging me about drinks. Now this next part is fuzzy but this is what my co worker said happened. I was stumbling through the kitchen, eyes glassy and hands grasping for counters to hang onto. I was mumbling about making coffee when I promptly hit the deck, out cold, they said I was out for a few minutes. 

When I came to I heard them on the phone with 911. And I said hang up cause I cannot afford an ambulance (lol) standing over me was my friend J and the manager. And the first words out of this woman’s mouth were “so when can you go back on the floor, we really need you!” She didn’t even ask me if I was okay! This was my first day back ffs. That was the moment I realized she didn’t even see me as a person. Just a work monkey. So I responded and said “you can accept my 2 weeks resignation” got up and left. When my two weeks were up and I told her it was my last day she asked me if I was really serious about that. Like yes biotch! 

I’m so glad I’m out of there. ",67,1729226430.0,EntitledPeople,7,0.98,False

Southern California, not the gulf coast or northeast, FWIW. 

The house is incredibly drafty and we keep the windows open almost constantly, except for winter months when we sometimes close most of the windows and turn on the heat. It’s an unfinished basement with dirt floors (which do flood a little). There is no central A/C but there is a central heating unit. I have air sensors that have been reading between 60% and 72% from April to now, and 50-60% in the winter. 

I’ve taken down cloth window blinds that had mold, and I recently found mold growing under a coffee table in the living room on the main floor. That same floor had another piece of furniture that we removed that was found to have mold on it. Both are a bright white colored mold. 

Do I disregard my concern about mold because we generally have a ton of circulation? Do we need to seal up the house and get A/C to lower humidity?",2,1729226369.0,centuryhomes,2,0.76,False

1g69zh7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g69zh7,Proud new Robot owner,"Quick backstory. I was into the espresso hobby a little over ten years ago. I had a Silvia that I added a PID too, a lever machine that I can’t remember the brand of, and a Mazzer SJ for a grinder. Just about ten years ago I went through a divorce and had to sell my machines, I kept the grinder in storage. I always knew I’d someday get a new machine when I had the space and money. I wanted a HX or double boiler unit. Since then I’ve kept roasting for personal use and enjoyed my daily pour over. 

A few weeks ago a buddy of mine gifted me the Wacaco Minipresso GR2. That little thing works better than it has any right too! That just got the taste in my mouth and I started researching coffee again. Boy or boy has the coffee scene changed a lot over the years. The gadgets I used were so rudimentary compared to what’s offered now. I recently bought the 1zpresso K-Ultra to replace my good ol’ Baratza Virtuoso. That thing is a tank. It’s at least 13 years old and I’ve never had an issue. 

Now that I had a small capable grinder I felt it was time I bought a manual machine. I went with the Robot due to the small footprint, and the aesthetic. I knew either the Flair or the Robot would be good. 

Anyways, my machine arrived yesterday. I dialed it in, I’m happy.

I thought about posting it on my fb but I don't think I'm ready for that yet, so I guess I'd rather tell a bunch of strangers over having my friends know right now. This is probably going to be long but I really need to get this out of me because it's so heavy and I'm tired of holding back tears/crying.

I'm 41f, I've had 3 major relationships since I was 18. We'll call them JC, TW, and TE. I got married to JC when I was 18 and he was 25, it was such a mistake. He is/was controlling, manipulative, insecure, jealous, truly overt narcissistic waste of resources type of human being. Couldn't hold a job but got angry and suspicious of me when i worked. The only good thing that came out of our marriage was our son, 19 now. He tormented me during our marriage and well after I left. It actually didn't stop until last year after a few years of nc when I sent his then gf screenshots of the shit that he's said to me. That felt good, I enjoyed being the bad guy after she broke up with him. I left him when I was 23. The actual mental and emotional damage that he did to me was quite extensive and I could write an entire novel about what I went through just with this guy. I was pretty bad off when I left and I won't go into detail on this post. Maybe another post...

After JC, I started dating TW. Honestly, I wouldn't have dated him. I was more comfortable being friends with him but post-breakup with JC, which was horrible for the next 15 years btw, I needed something. I needed comfort and kindness. At first, it wasn't that bad, you know? We got along really well, had a lot of things in common. We lived separately for awhile, then with roommates, separately again, same roommates again. When we finally moved in together alone, it was awful. He wasn't like JC but in some ways, he was. Both of them promised these things that they would do and then never fulfilled. He promised he would treat my son like his own, he didn't. He was always in competition with my son when he was with us and bullied him when I wasn't around/at work. He promised he'd cook and clean and split the housework 50/50. He didn't. None of it. He wanted a pat on the back for vacuuming our living room once a week while I did everything else while working a fulltime job. My role became a fuckable mom to him. Our relationship lasted about 7 years before I left. I started talking to TE. 

I met TE back when I was 18 but I didn't like him back then, didn't want anything to do with him. We weren't even friends. We used to hangout at the same popular coffee shop back in the day, which is how I know him. You know how you meet someone and they're not your type and then one day they are? That's basically what happened. We started talking online and then one day, he's picking me up and we're watching movies at his house. I wasn't doing it for any kind of romantic anything, I just couldn't stand being around TW or in that apartment. Well, it sorta blossomed. One day we're watching movies, flash forward to he's asking me to move in. Red flags were going off after a month and a half but I was so desperate to leave. I couldn't kick TW out, the lease was in his name and I felt desperate so... I said yes and moved in. You know... JC was bad, really bad, I was still dealing with him. He made me feel so bad because I was working an hourly job, no control over my schedule, and making me feel like shit because to him I was choosing work over my kid and I should've just stayed with my parents and not work at all. TW though... Omg... 

We lasted about 6 years before I left. It was subtle at first, the way he would demean me. You didn't do this right. The occasional b wordand c word. And then one day it was all the time. My thing is that after a fight, I need time to decompress. I'd go outside and smoke a cigarette to cool off and he'd lock the door behind me. I started taking my keys outside with me after fights. Sometimes, he'd blow up out of nowhere or after an accidental spill, something minor and it would be all my fault. I remember the first time I cooked for him. It was chicken cacciatore, I spent not only a good chunk of money on it but also a lot of time cooking it. He refused to eat it... so I refused to cook for our first 3 years together. He'd belittle me for not doing the dishes right. At the time, after the chicken cacciatore incident, he'd cook and I'd wash dishes but even after I started cooking again, he'd refuse to wash dishes. Sex was aggressive, never a loving act, like to dominate me. He was never emotionally available, ever and he'd get mad if I tried to talk to him on a deeper level. When I was 5 months pregnant with our daughter, I saw a message on his phone and I went through that thing. He was cheating on me our entire relationship. And you would think that that was the nail in the coffin, it wasn't, because I'm stupid. I stayed for a year and a few months longer. After being called a burden, and him becoming comfortable with getting physical with me, something told me to check his phone. So, I used his fingerprint while he was deep asleep to get into his phone. Same ol', same ol'. I left with my daughter in tow that morning. 

It's been 5 years since. We have a decent coparenting relationship with our daughter. Tuesday he tells me, as he's dropping off our daughter that he's got a girlfriend now. I tell him that I figured because he's stopped trying to kiss me, f me, flirting with me. I feel that he only told me because he left town yesterday with her and that he wouldn't be able to pick up our daughter after school or have her over the weekend.  

I want to make it clear, I'm not mad or upset that he has a girlfriend. I'm happy for him for finally moving on. Here's what bothers me, and this is why it's so heavy on my soul. All of my exes, however shitty they were to me, have someone. And you know, maybe it's going great. But here I am, a 41 year old woman. Broken. Shattered. Two kids. My cells hurt and they ache from being ripped apart, over and over again. I've been mentally and emotionally destroyed by these people who used to say, ""I love you,"" but didn't mean it. 

I did my best to do everything right. I did my best to be a good wife, a good girlfriend. Was I not good enough? Am I not worthy of love? Is there something wrong with me? Why did I have to carry the weight of trying to keep these relationships together? Why wouldn't they fight for me? For us? I'm so damaged now that even though I miss intimacy, and those quiet moments, holding hands, snuggling while watching movies, that I can't bring myself to be vulnerable like that again. Even with two kids and a cat, and living with my parents, I'm so lonely. It hurts so bad. Never in a million years did I think that this would be where I am at my age, stuck, poor. Both of my best friends are dead and I don't feel comfortable enough to talk to anyone about it because if anything, these relationships taught me that I can't rely on anyone. That I just have me. 

If you made it this far, I'm sorry. I needed to vent. I didn't say everything that happened or how I feel but I think I've said enough. ",1,1729225669.0,offmychest,4,1.0,False

She had a hysterectomy, chemo and radiation and has been in remission. That said, she is still experiencing extreme side effects 13 years later. 

Due to the radiation in her bowel area post hysterectomy, she has scar tissue built up in her colon / intestines. Ever since radiation, she has experienced what we call “episodes.” These include bouts of nonstop vomiting, diarrhea, pain, and not being able to eat. 

Without getting into medical detail, she has had surgery and multiple hospitalizations due to these episodes. Her doctors say there’s nothing they can do and that she has to deal with it for the rest of her life. These unexpected episodes cause a great deal or physical and emotional stress. Her quality of life is suffering. 

She has changed her diet time and time again over the years and has met with dietitians. She can’t have fresh fruit or veggies, or anything with seeds or skin. She has to have minimal amounts of meat, no coffee, etc. etc. 

I am reaching out on Reddit for the first time ever to see if there is anyone else out there experiencing something similar. Whether it be themselves, a friend or family member.

This got me wondering to our 50,000 strong Creami community, *what’s your “secret” ingredient that makes all the difference to your Creami recipes?* 


It can be your favorite extract, oil, powder, or ingredient. I’ve seen people use salt in their recipes. I’ve seen people add coffee to their chocolate Creami. 

For me it’s lemon juice. While I don’t add it to every recipe, it tends to enhance flavors of the main fruit in my Creami. 

The bottom line with these ingredients is that they all take their masterpiece to the next level. 

*So, what’s your secret ingredient that takes your Creami to the next level?*
 
When you share, where it’s appropriate, please be as specific as the brand name, so we can all benefit and raise our game to Creami Grandmaster!

This is most apparent with low-stakes, everyday things like how I make my coffee in the morning (""my day will be ruined if I don't make my own coffee,"" ""it won't be 'right' if someone else makes it,"" etc). HOWEVER! Today I realized that there are two people in the world that I would trust with doing things like this that I could never imagine trusting anyone else to do: my partner and my mom. It's always been my mom, but recently I realized I've been asking my partner to help with tasks that I typically would never imagine letting a friend near. I guess I'm wondering if this is common? To have people you trust enough to do something ""right"" for you? I've never heard of exceptions like this, so I'd be curious about others' experiences! ",2,1729225289.0,OCD,2,1.0,False

To give us another try, reconnect after we had spent time healing, growing, finding equilibrium.

I can't make true to that promise for ethical reasons, so this is me doing what I can to the extent that I can.

Hello, S.

I hope you are well. I hope life is treating you fine, your job is fulfilling and you look forward to waking up each day. I hope your marriage is everything you envisioned for yourself and that you've found ""home."" I also hope you've found inner peace, self-acceptance, and meaning, whatever that means to you today. I hope your little boy is thriving and your creativity is flowing. I'm still looking for your name on the Forbes list crediting your world-altering idea. I hope your family is in good health and your sister has found her way and her place in this world- I truly miss her.

I am doing well. My career is thriving and my life revolves around it; it's a whirlwind but I love it. I get to travel and work with all sorts of interesting people, and I know so much more of the complex world we live in. I credit a lot of my success to my time spent with you - I learned skills that help me navigate social settings in a way I never could have previously. I've mastered my ""mask"" -  but it always comes off at the end of the day. I've checked a few more things off my bucket list, as you wished for me in our last interaction.  It took me an incredibly long time to heal - the last of it was accepting that some symptoms are here to stay and what that means for me, my life, and the way I relate to the world around me. I still wouldn't have wished for any of it but I accept it and where the cards have fallen. My family is also doing well.

I'm think that just about covers everything we might have discussed, barring any tangents that a true coffee meeting might have brought upon. But, I'm not at all the person you once knew, and I'm sure you aren't either... I reckon our pact was a flawed idea to begin with. No one could have predicted what truly followed.

All best laid plans....

Wishing you much more love, success, fulfillment and wonder-filled 3am moments to come.
