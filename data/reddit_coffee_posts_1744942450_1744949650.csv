1k1w30h,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1k1w30h/he_wanted_to_help_with_the_restaurants_social/,He wanted to “help” with the restaurant’s social media… so I blocked him on all the accounts.,"I do the social media for a family-owned restaurant that I’ve been working with for almost a year now. When I started, they didn’t have much of an online presence, so I offered to help for free. Within a month, I had grown their pages, made multiple viral videos, and directly helped triple their sales. They’ve made over a million in profit in under a year — and yes, I know social media isn’t everything, but I’m proud of what I’ve built. This is now my biggest account and how I pay my bills.

Enter this new guy. He just got hired as a barista.

During his interview, he apparently mentioned that he likes social media and content creation. Fair enough. But since day one, this kid has been trying to insert himself into a role that no one asked him to fill. He’s been told multiple times that we already have someone (me) managing the social media… but that hasn’t stopped him from bringing his little camera in, taking videos before his shift, editing random clips, and even showing them to the chef, who was not impressed.

The restaurant is trying to be nice and inclusive, so I get why they didn’t shut it down immediately. But I’m irritated by people who come into someone else’s space, especially a business they just got hired at, and start stepping on toes like they own the place.

On his first day of training, he told me he wanted to “talk” with me. We sat down, and it felt like I was being interrogated. He asked how I got started, and I answered, honestly but directly. I’m not easily impressed — you show me your work, not your talk. He told me he wants to do what I do but doesn’t have a portfolio. That set off a red flag: he wants to build his portfolio on my account just because he now has convenient access by being employed there. Absolutely not.

I told him, plainly: I don’t need help with the social media. And when you keep pushing yourself into a role that already exists, it feels like you’re trying to take my job. If that is the case, we’re going to have a problem.

He apologized, said that wasn’t his intention, and I gave him the benefit of the doubt. I even offered to help him learn — when I had the time — and said he could start by creating his own pages. I even offered to introduce him to some small businesses that could use content for free. But I could tell he didn’t really want to hear it. I think it bruised his ego that I didn’t roll out a red carpet for him.

Now here’s where things got awkward:
Shortly after that conversation, one of the other managers (who I actually trained, btw) came up to me asking what he and I had talked about. She had overheard him going on all morning about how he was going to help with social media. So, manager to manager, I started explaining the conversation we had and where I stood on everything.

Mid-convo, he comes walking up to us — with a coffee for me — and it’s obvious that he overheard us. Yes, I’ll admit, I know it didn’t look great. I wasn’t badmouthing him at all, but from the outside, I could see how it might come off that way. So I took the honest route: I looked him dead in the eye and said, “Hey, I’m sorry if that looked bad. I was just explaining the conversation we had to her since she asked about it. I wasn’t saying anything negative about you. I was actually just about to mention how I offered to help you when the timing is right.”

I was being real, respectful, and transparent. I didn’t owe him that level of honesty — but I gave it anyway.

And then this man looks me dead in the eye and says, “Well, I hope you weren’t talking bad… it’s snake season right now.”

Snake season?? Okay.

Fast-forward a few days — he texts me saying he wants to send me all the videos he shot so I can help him edit them. I don’t respond because I’m busy. Then I see him at the restaurant during an influencer event. He tries to stop me to talk about social media again. I tell him I’m too busy right now and can’t focus on it, but he’s welcome to keep practicing on his own and I’ll help when I can.

And then — this kid has the audacity to interrupt me, talk over me, and say (with a weird tone), “Well, just make sure you communicate with me. That’s all I ask.”

Excuse me?

I literally blinked and said, “Wow. That’s a strange thing to say to someone in a management position. Have a good night.” And I walked away.

I told the head chef afterward, and he just shook his head and said, “He’s not posting anything. That’s your job. And I’ve been noticing that he’s trying to force himself into things he wasn’t hired for.” He assured me the kid probably won’t be around long, and he’d talk to him.

But it still didn’t sit right with me. So here’s where the petty part comes in.

I went home, and I blocked him on everything.
Blocked him on my personal marketing account.
Blocked him on the restaurant’s social media accounts.
He has no access, no visibility, and no way to ride my coattails now.

You want to act like you’re in charge?
You want to treat my paid job like it’s your portfolio project?
You want to “communicate” with me like you’re my boss?

Nah. Let me remind you who actually runs the show.

Enjoy your latte, kid. Snake season’s over.

Hey MaximizeMe fam! 

Let me hit you with something real: **time blocking was killing my vibe.** 🙄 You know, the whole ""I'm gonna work from 9 to 10 on emails, and then from 10 to 11 on that report"" thing? Yeah, it sounded great on paper, but in practice? I was just getting distracted *all the time.* 

Then, I stumbled upon **habit stacking**, and wow, what a game changer! Here's how it shifted my focus like a boss.

**So, what even is habit stacking?** 🤔

It's basically taking something you already **do regularly** and combining it with a new habit you want to create. Think of it as a buddy system for your habits! Instead of trying to carve out an *entire* hour for something, you tie it to an existing habit. 

**Here’s what I did:**

1. **Morning Coffee + Journaling**  
   Instead of just gulping down my coffee, I now sit and journal while I sip. ☕📝 My productivity vibes get a boost, and I start my day feeling clear and focused!

2. **Exercise + Podcasting**  
   I would always say I’d go for a run and listen to podcasts at some point. But making it a routine? I hit the pavement, and now I'm learning something new with every step! 🚀

3. **Break Time + Hydration**  
   Every hour I take a quick break; I make it a point to drink a glass of water. Not only does it keep me hydrated, but it also gives me a little reset! 💧

And guess what? Since I switched to this method, I'm *actually* getting things done without that background noise of distractions! 

**Why does this work?**  
- **Less Pressure**: When you time-block, you worry about fitting things into specific slots. With habit stacking, you just *do it* whenever you’re doing something else. 🙌
- **Flow State**: When you combine habits, you get into a rhythm. It’s like riding a bike—way easier than trying to remember all the steps of balancing, pedaling, and steering separately! 🚴‍♂️
- **Celebrating Small Wins**: Each time I complete a stacked habit, it feels like a mini victory! Who doesn’t love a good success boost? 🎉

I mean, I *loved* my planner. But honestly, all those meticulously crafted time blocks just made me think more about what I wasn’t getting done instead of what I was accomplishing. 😩

**Have you guys tried habit stacking?** Or are you still knee-deep in your time blocks? Let’s chat about what’s working for you, or what you’re hoping to change in the future. I’m all ears!

## What is Aetheron Edge GPT?

Aetheron Edge GPT is an **AI-powered trading platform** designed to make crypto and financial trading more accessible. It uses a GPT-like algorithm to analyze markets in real-time and deliver insights that help users make better trading decisions.

Think of it like having a personal finance analyst who never sleeps and crunches numbers 24/7—except it’s software. The platform can operate in **manual or automated mode**, so whether you want to set your own trades or let the AI do the heavy lifting, you’ve got options.

It reminds me a lot of platforms like Bitcoin Code or Immediate Edge, but with a slicker interface and more emphasis on AI decision-making. Basically, it’s built for people who are curious about trading but don’t want to spend years learning technical analysis.

## Who Created Aetheron Edge GPT?

The creators of Aetheron Edge GPT are a bit elusive—pretty standard in the fintech world. While the platform doesn’t disclose individual names, it claims to be developed by a group of **quantitative analysts, software engineers, and crypto traders** who have worked with major financial institutions.

That sounds like marketing fluff, but from my experience using the platform, it does feel like something built by people who understand both user experience and market behavior. It’s not some slapped-together trading bot. The interface is smooth, and the performance is solid.

Still, I’d love more transparency on the leadership team. Trust is a big deal in this space, and having a few names or LinkedIn profiles would go a long way.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Aetheron Edge GPT Today](https://tinyurl.com/54pssp8z)
## How Does Aetheron Edge GPT Work?

At its core, Aetheron Edge GPT works by using **machine learning** and **natural language processing** to interpret market signals and historical trends. It then uses that data to make predictions and recommend trades.

There are two main ways to use the platform:

- **Manual Trading** – You get market insights and signals, but you decide what trades to make.
- **Automated Trading** – The AI places trades for you based on pre-set conditions and risk levels.

The platform pulls data from multiple sources in real-time, including news, social media, and technical charts. It then uses that data to generate high-probability trading signals. From what I’ve seen, the accuracy is pretty decent—no magic bullet, but definitely useful.

## Aetheron Edge GPT Pros and Cons

Let’s break down the good and the not-so-good:

**Pros:**
- **AI-backed trading insights** for smarter decisions
- **Simple interface** that’s beginner-friendly
- **Supports multiple assets**, not just crypto
- **Demo mode** lets you practice without risk
- **No experience required** to get started

**Cons:**
- **$250 minimum deposit** might be steep for some
- **No mobile app yet**, just a mobile-friendly site
- **Limited transparency** on the development team
- **No guarantee of profits** (but that’s true for all trading)

Overall, the pros outweigh the cons, especially if you’re just starting out and want a platform that's not overwhelming.

## Is Aetheron Edge GPT a Scam?

Short answer: **Doesn’t seem like it**.

That said, always be cautious. Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose, and remember that **AI can help, but it’s not infallible**. Markets are unpredictable, no matter how smart the algorithm is.

The money goes into your trading account and is used to execute trades—it’s not a fee. Still, I wish they offered a lower-entry tier for folks who just want to dip a toe in.

## How to Delete an Aetheron Edge GPT Account?

If you decide to walk away, you can delete your account by:

1. Contacting customer support via email or chat
2. Requesting full account closure
3. Withdrawing any remaining funds beforehand

It’s not instant, but they’ll process it within 24–48 hours. No hidden tricks or long delays.

So I know that after reading that title I have an uphill battle to be labeled ‘not the asshole’, and if I truly am the asshole I’d love some advice on navigating forward.

As a quick overview, my ex wife got pregnant on accident after our marriage was already on the rocks. Before our son was even born we decided to divorce, we lived together for the first few months on his life in separate rooms for logistics and baby bonding, and were divorced and living separately before he was one. Here are the basics of our custody agreement that are relevant: our custody schedule was up to us to determine and could be flexible, there was no court ordered schedule/division of time and I pay $600 a month in child support, based on the fact that I likely would not have him 50/50 due to work schedule and lack of local family support.

At first I did not have him 50/50, I had him on weekends only until he was 2 and I found a new job to give me more time with him. So then I would have him every weekend + some week days, we were about 60/40. Once I had been with my now wife for over a year, we changed custody again to be exactly 50/50. It’s been like this for about 2 years now.

Our son is 6 now and getting into sports and more paid activities and while we’re getting by financially, my pay went down when I switched careers to be more involved, and my wife is a teacher so it doesn’t pay much.
When we sat down to review our budget I took a look at what a difference $600 could make. It would help with our food budget, and free up some more money for my son’s activities he really wants to do.

So I brought up the idea with my ex wife about eliminating child support or lowering it to 250 a month, which I knew would cover a good amount of monthly costs centered around him. She was so pissed about me even suggesting it she called me, screamed that I’m taking food out of his mouth and it’s not fair that I have a two income household and am asking to support him less than her as a single mom. She said no way and if I tried again she’d take me to court for full custody. Later that day even her mom was texting me and calling me a deadbeat dad.

I really didn’t think I was an asshole for asking to at least lower it, considering it would go directly to supporting him, just at our house instead. I get that we have a two income household but she does have a partner who lives with her, so I would hope they’re helping out with household things at least. I also pay for his health insurance, and a larger portion of his school tuition. And when we divorced, I gave her the house that I had already paid a large chunk of by myself so her mortgage is less than average rent in our area. I don’t know the full breakdown of their finances but I do know that our son has a massive amount of toys at her house, and an iPad, and eats our regularly. So I’m wondering what his $600 a month goes to?

I was confident in my ask and my wife says it was a reasonable suggestion to at least lower it but she did say maybe I should have just asked to lower, not totally eliminate. I can see that, but if I’m being honest, I’m struggling to see a side where I’m in the wrong and deserve to be called a deadbeat dad. So what do you think?

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** How much difference would losing the 600 make for her tho?

> **OOP:** That’s a good perspective to look at, and I had given it some thought as I was seeing the positive impact for me.
> 
> That’s why I mentioned the amount of toys and eating out and technology and such. Obviously my opinions and guesses are not facts but I think a lot of money is spent on going out to eat, Starbucks on the way to work every day, new toys, and luxuries more than necessities. If she is making around what she was when we divorced, with basic raises in the interim, after what I know the mortgage payment is and her percentage of tuition, she takes homes within 7k a year of what I do.
> 
> I think $600 less a month would change her lifestyle, but not in a way that would at all negatively impact our son as long as she sacrificed instead of forcing him to. But like I said, all my thoughts could be wrong! Which is why I wanted to just have the conversation and was open to still contributing.

**Commenter 2:** Your current partner's income has no impact on whether you should pay child support or not. Her boyfriend is not responsible for your child either .

But, IF you and your ex both made the exact same income and you had 50/50 time, then there is no reason to pay any child support at all. But, it is the income disparity between you two that would determine what you should pay. If you make substantially more than her, it would be fair for you to pay her even if you 50/50 time with the child . Most countries/states have a income calculator to estimate what child support is due. You might owe more or you might owe less. So it might be reasonable for you to pay less. It is hard to judge without knowing your boths incomes

> **Commenter 3:** Thank you. I can't believe so many people do not know this. Maybe it's different in certain places, but as far as I know, income disparity has been the standard for setting child support for several years.
> > 
> > **OOP:** I did find a calculator that could give me an estimate, and while I don’t know all the exact numbers for her side, I actually got an estimate around 100 a month but I brought it up to 250 for my suggestion because going from $600 a month to 0 felt harsh, as nice as it would be on my side haha. I just wanted to open the conversation with her to go through this process and am still getting berated for even thinking it.

**OOP explains about how his child support is used for and how he has been budgeting**

> **OOP:** I don’t know, you’re right. But when my child support payment goes into the same bank account as her paycheck does, and that account pays for the grocery store trip and the Starbucks, which dollar is paying for which?
> 
> I know that each time we were about to change custody I redid my budget. And I got rid of my morning coffee and breakfast routine that was costing me about $90 a month to allocate that to my gas budget since I would be driving more to and from his school.
> 
> Also just a petty note, I did say ‘my guesses are not facts’ so I’m not claiming to know everything. I just wanted a conversation
> 
+
> 
> I get that, and I’m so glad that it’s not that situation. But my child support is to ensure that he can have equal quality of life at both homes so he doesn’t suffer for his parents not working out.
> 
> Right now I am paying $600 a month and he’s living pretty similarly at both homes. He has less character/novelty toys at our house (more Montessori style or outdoor toys, not a lot of things he’ll grow out of or get bored of very fast) and we cook 95% of our food at home rather than eating out, he doesn’t have things like an iPad, and our most frequented outing is to the library.
> 
> So my point is that I think he can still have the same quality of life at both homes, and I will still contribute, but would less than 600 impact HIS life, or hers? Would she have to get less Starbucks or get her nails done less, or eat out less? If his quality of life can stay the same and she gives up some luxuries, I think it’s at least worth the conversation.
> 
> If I’m still totally ignoring something or my side doesn’t make sense I want to see where it doesn’t, but that’s where I’m coming from.

**OOP on paying insurance, extracurricular activities, who claims their son on taxes**

> **OOP:** I pay health insurance, she claims him on taxes. And no, as much as I’d love more time with him I don’t want to take him away from his mom, and the custody schedule we follow now seems as easy on him as custody changes can be.

+

> I pay for the insurance and all the bills come to me, and I pay them. For a while we were at every appointment together and I always paid the copay. Now if she for example takes him to his regular dentist appointment they bill our copay and I pay it. If he goes to the doctor and needs to pay the copay, she does pay it but no copay is over 40.
> 
> For extracurriculars that he’s in right now we each get him the equipment he needs so he doesn’t have to drag them back and forth between homes but I typically pay like registration fees. His first soccer summer camp ever we split it on the same % we split school and we’ve been doing each a little different, case by case.

*Editor’s note: FOC = Friend of the Court: an unbiased, impartial legal assistance for child support cases*

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/s/C6QtyCRLQd): **April 11, 2025 (five days later)**

I responded to a lot of comments in my last post so I won’t spend much time clearing things up here or making my case. I also was downvoted quite a bit on most of my comments so, not I’m sure how this update will go over.

I will clarify that we do have a custody and support agreement. It’s not a super common one but it set my child support and essentially said we have shared custody and we can decide what the schedule is. I brought it up with my ex first instead of court because for one, I didn’t want to blindside her. And two, we have talked through and agreed on the custody time changes together each time before and agreed it was nice to keep it out of court.

I let things be for a couple days after asking her. The day after I posted, I apologized to her for how I brought it up and asked if she would be willing to go to mediation to at least discuss the topic. She agreed, and my area has a community dispute resolution center that is accepted by the courts and takes cases either same day or pretty quickly, so we went there the next day.

I came with documents for my income and budget, medical records to show my proof of payments, school pick up and drop off data (we have to check in and out) to show my involvement, receipts for extracurricular fees and materials, and communications between her and I on extra things I have paid for and any changes in custody. I was asking for an official 50/50 agreement and an evaluation of my child support. She still said that it would be killing her budget and she wouldn’t be able to provide for him without the 600. So the mediator walked us through the formula. Turns out, she should owe me. Not much, around $100 a month, but I could go after back support from when I was technically overpaying. She was pretty shocked.

We agreed to formalize the 50/50 and put some standard holiday guidelines in place. We also agreed I would pay $200 a month and not go after back support. The mediator did say they will be suggesting the courts open a FOC investigation to see that financial responsibility to the child is being met in both homes. Which I didn’t know was a thing but apparently it was a big red flag to her that I was paying that much support in addition to the custody and other things I pay for, or the majority of. So we’ll see what happens after that, I’m not sure what comes of those considering I just found out about them.

I appreciate the constructive comments on my original post and am just thankful that I have a more formal agreement. I don’t think there was anything wrong with our first one for the time being, but situations change and we’re figuring this out as we go.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Why are you still paying her £200 a month if you've been over paying her, and have been paying for more of the extra costs like health insurance and extra curricular activities etc?

If you've been over paying, and would be entitled to back pay, she should be grateful you're not going for back pay and you shouldn't have to pay her anything?

Seems like she's still taking advantage of you.

She may say she can't afford to live without your money, but people spend their money differently. Whose to say she isn't spending a lot of money meeting friends for lunch or buying clothes or getting her nails and hair done and buying unnecary cups of coffee or lunch at Starbucks everyday? She needs to re evaluate her spending and adjust it to her income, as clearly from the assessment she must earn more than you if she owes you money.

So I'd be reconsidering paying that, coz she already owes you back pay, so why continue over paying her? The £200 a month could go into a college savings account for your kid instead.

The fact the mediator is getting someone to investigate the case and the living environment at her home sounds pretty serious like she's seriously taking advantage.

> **OOP:** Whether she’s taking advantage of me or not I intend for that money to be used on my son. I can’t have him 100% of the time so I at least don’t want to financially cut her off entirely and risk my son paying the biggest price.
> 
> I will wait to see what comes of the FOC investigation.
> 
> I have a post-high school high yield savings account for him that I add a budgeted amount to and a kids bank account set up for him already, through acorn, and anytime I have a surplus from my budget I add it in there. He’s already used his own card to get a couple hot wheels as I try to set the groundwork for learning about money. Once he gets a bit older he will have (age appropriate) access to the account.

**Commenter 2:** Your ex is definitely getting the better end of this deal. You are being very gracious in continuing to pay anything at all and not going after back support. Your ex has been taking advantage of you.

> **Commenter 3:** seriously. no back pay okay fine don't burn bridges but mediator said she should pay yet op is still paying the ex???
> > 
> > **OOP:** I know how I manage my money, and I know how she did when we were together. I can make a happy and comfortable life for our son at my house while paying her $200. Until the FOC investigation is done that’s what we will do, and go from there. I just don’t want him to suffer and if this can maybe help, I can earn more money.

**Commenter 4:** Is she spending the money on your son tho ? It seems she is using the money for herself

> **OOP:** That’s exactly the question I asked.
> 
> I keep a pretty strict budget, which includes bills, living expenses, child support, tuition, activities for my son, contributions to a savings account for him, and an amount set aside each paycheck dedicated to doing things with him. Outings like the zoo, movies, children’s museums, baseball games, and of course some of it gets spent on toys haha.
> 
> I use a budget app that helps me automatically track where all the money goes so it was really easy for me to have this all documented. She doesn’t do anything like that. I had tried to get her to when we were together, and suggested it after we divorced but obviously I can’t make her do anything.
> 
> Knowing what she made when we were together, and that she was still in the same job so it’d be fair to assume she’s gotten a raise, what I pay in child support and toward his other expenses, what the mortgage is, it didn’t make much sense to me that she was saying she relied on that money. She still regularly gets her nails done (like a full set with designs, according to my wife that’s pricey), keeps her regular cut and color hair appointment that I had always paid for, and drives a car with at least a $300 monthly payment. Now I don’t know what her boyfriend makes but he’s in the pharmacy world, which I think pays decently well. So nothing really added up for me and it didn’t for the mediator either. Now we’re both turning over our financial records and doing home visits. I’m not worried about my side, I know he’s well taken care of, and I know at her house he’s taken care of, it’s just a question on where money is being spent.

“You’re good, here’s another one. And another.”

It’s still manageable (barely) because the sites are within reach (within metro manila) . But then they said the magic words:

And I was like… *yes but also no but also yes???*

**Problem:**  
I have no manpower. No engineers, no techs, not even a tambay with a multimeter. Just me, my laptop, and some late-night Google Sheets magic.

## What is Xyberion Apex GPT?

**Xyberion Apex GPT** is an automated trading platform that uses **AI algorithms** to help users trade financial assets like crypto, forex, and commodities. Think of it as your own digital assistant that scans the markets 24/7, looking for profitable trades based on market data, trends, and predictive models.

The platform claims to offer **real-time market insights**, **auto-trading capabilities**, and a simple dashboard that even beginners can use. It’s kind of like having a super-smart robot trader in your pocket—minus the complicated coding or finance degree.

What sets it apart is its **GPT-based algorithm**, which supposedly enhances decision-making by learning from market behavior over time. Whether that’s just a fancy buzzword or actually helpful? I’ll get to that in a bit.

## Who Created Xyberion Apex GPT?

There isn’t a ton of detailed public info on the founders, which is pretty common with platforms like this. But based on what I found, it seems like **a team of fintech developers and AI specialists** are behind it, supposedly with a background in building high-frequency trading systems.

While the anonymous nature might raise eyebrows, it’s not a dealbreaker. **Platforms like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge also launched anonymously** and still managed to build trust over time. That said, I do wish they were more transparent about the development team.

## How Does Xyberion Apex GPT Work?

Xyberion Apex GPT works by combining **machine learning, natural language processing**, and real-time market analysis to generate trading signals. When you activate the auto-trading feature, the software uses those signals to place trades on your behalf.

Here’s a simplified breakdown:

- The AI scans thousands of market data points per second.
- It identifies price patterns, news events, and trends.
- Based on its analysis, it generates buy or sell signals.
- The software can then either **auto-execute trades** or **alert you to take action**.

The platform also has **manual trading options** if you prefer to be more hands-on. So whether you’re a newbie or a seasoned trader, there’s a mode for you.

## Xyberion Apex GPT Pros and Cons

Seriously, talk to a lender or broker before you fall in love with something out of reach.
* **The price tag isn't the** ***real*** **price.** Okay this one gets people. You save for the down payment, awesome! But don't forget closing costs (they can be thousands!), moving expenses, maybe immediate repairs the seller won't cover (that water heater *always* seems to die week one, right?), maybe needing new furniture... budget cushion is key.
* **Please, please DO NOT skip the home inspection.** Seriously. Even on new construction. It might seem like a way to save $500-$800 now, but I've seen inspections uncover issues that would have cost buyers $10k, $20k, even more down the line. It's the best money you'll spend in the whole process, trust me on this.
* **Try not to fall** ***completely*** **in love at first sight.** It's tough! You walk in, the light is perfect, you can picture your couch... I get it! But try to keep a *little* bit of emotional distance early on. Think about the layout *really* working for you, the condition, the location, the *numbers*... before you mentally move in. It makes navigating negotiations and potential inspection issues way easier.
* **You're buying the neighborhood, not just the house.** Sounds obvious, but people get laser-focused on the four walls. Drive around the area at different times. Night time? Rush hour?

## What is Merit Luxis?

The platform’s creators keep a relatively low profile. There’s no Elon Musk-type figurehead here, which is common for many of these types of platforms.

While names aren’t publicly listed (which might raise an eyebrow), they seem to have put serious thought into the design and security of the platform.

This lack of transparency isn’t unusual in this space, and it doesn’t necessarily mean it's shady—it just makes it a bit harder to verify its roots. Still, the platform’s functionality and user feedback seem to speak for themselves.

1k1vprb,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1k1vprb/problems_at_new_daycare/,Problems at new daycare,"We moved our almost 3 year old in February to a new daycare that just opened about 15 mins away. She was in one over an hour drive away before this and had no problems. The new daycare retains camera footage for at least 30 days based on conversations we have overheard.

Well suddenly in the past month she has been crying about going in everyday. I started to look at the cameras more and I see one of the boys pushing kids to the ground, shoving, punching, robbing toys and then smashing the kids in the face with said toy, kicking them, pulling hair which whipped a girls head back roughly, throwing toys across the room, and throwing baskets of toys everywhere. 

If he wants something or wants to do an activity he will just do whatever to the kid currently doing the activity until the child leaves/stops so he can perform the activity. This is constant, all the kids avoid him and it’s just non stop. Not to mention actively looking to see if teachers are watching before doing a lot of this. They catch it some of the time but not all the time, most of them look fed up with said kid.
We complained about it to the director as I saw each of these happen in the space of 30 minutes one of the days and it was awful. Since then we’ve been keeping a close eye on cameras. 

Another little girl started a few weeks ago. Last week I saw him shove her down to where her head was on this wooden coffee table with her neck on the edge. He was kinda pushing and pulling her head back into the table while standing over her. I called immediately and they removed the table. The problem boy was not removed or sent home early.

Well today he’s doing his usual destruction and I see him keep taking a book from our daughter that was reading to some other kids. She was sitting on a little chair. The teacher takes it back multiple times to give to her but as this point all the kids have moved somewhere else except our daughter with one other boy who is cornered at the chair by the problem boy. The problem boy then kicks our daughter in the legs and starts stomping on her feet. The other boy who was trapped in the corner with her kisses her knee and feet before chasing the problem boy away. 

We called and told them we were very unhappy about our daughter being attacked by the problem boy. They said he is on a behavior plan and they are working with the parents. However, they couldn’t give any concrete timeline or answers in regard to the problem boy. We asked about the policy in the handbook; which has 3 steps with no timelines attached and they wouldn’t give any explanation of an expected timeline in regard to the written policies.

Step 1) speak with parents and develop a behavioral plan

Step 2) if step 1 fails revise the behavioral plan and keep trying.

Step 3) if the revised behavioral plan fails the child is expelled/removed.

The daycare offered that they are planning on starting a new preschool class and they would be able to separate the children; again no timeline they could provide to us.

We aren’t happy about this, and asked to move our daughter up to the next class as she’s turning 3 soon. They did this immediately but she’s confused why she isn’t with her friends anymore.

I’m just curious if we did the right thing?

This main issue with this is: it’s always for really long activities like playing golf (takes all day), going to a sporting event (takes a half a day), going out of town to hike (takes all day), he even took him on a fishing charter trip that went from 4am to 10pm (they had to drive 5 hours round trip to get on the boat).

Our baby is 10 months and just myself and my husband care for her so, when FIL wants all this special father and son time (usually on weekends or holidays) it means that I have even more solo parenting time (my husband works full time during the week).

I’d understand if FIL wanted to a quick coffee or lunch or catchup during husband’s lunch break every once in a while (he works from home). But even still… we see FIL with our baby nearly once a week, and I just feel like my husband is a dad now too, to a baby, plus he works full time, has a marriage, a home and lots of friends, and a daily gym routine and it’s not really the season to be going on these long weekly father and son hangouts. Thoughts?

* this started when I was pregnant. MIL is emeshed to my husband (that is obvious) and I’m thinking that maybe FIL is too and I just didn’t see it before. It’s like MIL & FIL view my husband as a forever child and depend on him like a partner or a best friend. And FIL & MIL view me as an incubator that get in the way of there entitled time with our baby and that I also get in their relationship with my husband.

- adding that my husband usually does say no but he makes up a story a lie as to why he can’t, rather than being honest and giving him a reality check.",4,1744947761.0,motherinlawsfromhell,4,1.0,False

## What is Credivo Sync AI?

Credivo Sync AI is an **automated trading platform** powered by artificial intelligence. It’s designed to help users—especially those with little to no trading experience—invest in cryptocurrencies, forex, and other asset markets with minimal effort. The whole idea is to **reduce the guesswork** by using smart algorithms that analyze market trends in real-time and execute trades based on calculated predictions.

Think of it like a co-pilot for your trading journey. You’re still in control, but the AI is doing the heavy lifting—monitoring charts, spotting trends, and even placing trades if you let it. This kind of tech isn't totally new (Bitcoin Era, Immediate Edge, etc., have done similar things), but Credivo Sync AI puts its own spin on it with a cleaner UI and a bit more flexibility.

## Who Created Credivo Sync AI?

So, here’s the thing—**the developers behind Credivo Sync AI aren’t exactly front and center**. Like with many trading platforms, there isn’t a celebrity CEO or a flashy founder doing TED Talks. What we do know is that the tech was reportedly built by a group of software engineers and financial analysts who wanted to make trading more accessible through AI and automation.

That said, Credivo Sync AI is **partnered with licensed brokers**, which gives it a bit more credibility. These partnerships ensure that when you deposit money, it’s handled through regulated channels and platforms, not some shady off-grid wallet.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Credivo Sync AI Today](https://tinyurl.com/266mbxh5)
## How Does Credivo Sync AI Work?

It’s pretty slick. Credivo Sync AI uses **advanced algorithms** trained on historical and live market data. These algorithms analyze trading patterns, news, volatility, and other signals to determine when (and what) to buy or sell. You can either let the bot **auto-trade** for you or use it in manual mode where it just gives suggestions.

Here’s a simplified breakdown:

- **Market scanning**: It looks at thousands of data points in real-time.
- **Trade signals**: It identifies opportunities and alerts you.
- **Execution**: If enabled, it places trades automatically through your broker.
- **Learning loop**: The AI uses new data to improve future predictions.

The key takeaway? It’s not just random guesses—it’s **data-driven** and constantly learning.

## Credivo Sync AI Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real—no system is perfect. Here’s what I found:

**Pros:**
- ✅ Beginner-friendly interface

The **minimum deposit is $250**, which is in line with other platforms like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge. It’s not free to trade, but that amount is reasonable for people testing the waters.

## What is Crythonis Drive GPT?

Crythonis Drive GPT is an **automated trading platform** powered by a GPT-based AI algorithm that analyzes market trends and executes trades based on real-time data. Think of it like having a personal assistant that doesn’t sleep, watching every market move and making decisions on your behalf.

It’s designed to help both beginners and advanced traders make smarter, faster, and more data-driven trading decisions. The AI does the heavy lifting — crunching numbers, spotting patterns, and even executing trades if you let it. You can also use it manually for more control.

## Who Created Crythonis Drive GPT?

The platform hasn’t been super transparent about its founding team, which is pretty common in the crypto-trading space. That said, based on what I could find (and comparing it to platforms like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge), it was most likely built by a group of developers and financial analysts who wanted to **democratize access to AI trading**.

The tech behind it is solid, and the site shows signs of a well-funded and experienced team. But yeah, if you're looking for a named founder like Elon Musk, you're out of luck here. Still, the features and performance speak for themselves.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The selection of an ideal 8 oz cup hinges on several crucial features that contribute to its overall functionality, durability, and user experience.

**Material Durability**

The material used in constructing the 8 oz cup directly impacts its durability and longevity. Options range from disposable paper and plastic to reusable glass, stainless steel, and ceramic. Higher-quality materials ensure the cup can withstand regular use, temperature fluctuations, and potential impacts without cracking, leaking, or degrading. For example, a double-walled stainless steel cup offers superior insulation and resistance to dents compared to a thin plastic cup.

**Insulation Properties**

For those who enjoy hot beverages, insulation is paramount. Insulated 8 oz cups, often made with double-walled construction or vacuum sealing, maintain the desired temperature for extended periods. This not only prevents rapid cooling of hot drinks but also keeps cold drinks refreshingly chilled. Look for cups that advertise specific temperature retention times, allowing you to enjoy your beverage at its optimal temperature for longer.

**Ergonomic Design**

The design of an 8 oz cup influences its comfort and ease of use. Features like a comfortable handle, a non-slip grip, and a well-balanced weight distribution contribute to a positive user experience. Ergonomically designed cups reduce the risk of spills and hand fatigue, especially during prolonged use. Consider the handle size and shape to ensure a secure and comfortable hold.

**Lid Compatibility & Security**

If you plan to use your 8 oz cup for on-the-go beverages, lid compatibility and security are essential. A well-fitting lid prevents spills and leaks, allowing you to transport your drink with confidence. Look for lids made from durable, BPA-free materials with a secure locking mechanism. Some lids may also include features like a sliding closure or a sip-through opening.

**Ease of Cleaning**

Maintenance is a key consideration for any reusable cup. Opt for 8 oz cups that are easy to clean, whether by hand or in the dishwasher. Smooth, non-porous surfaces prevent the buildup of residue and stains. Dishwasher-safe cups save time and effort, while those with wide mouths are easier to clean by hand.

**Environmental Impact**

With growing environmental awareness, the sustainability of your 8 oz cup is increasingly important. Consider reusable options made from eco-friendly materials like bamboo, recycled plastic, or sustainably sourced glass. These cups reduce reliance on disposable alternatives and minimize your environmental footprint. Look for certifications that verify the cup's eco-friendliness.

 ## Core Benefits

Choosing the right 8 oz cup offers several practical benefits that enhance daily life.

**Improved Portion Control**

The 8 oz cup is perfectly sized for portion control, helping you manage your intake of various beverages. Whether you're watching your calorie count, limiting your caffeine consumption, or simply prefer smaller servings, an 8 oz cup provides a consistent and convenient measurement. This can be particularly beneficial for those following specific dietary plans or health recommendations.

**Enhanced Convenience**

The compact size of an 8 oz cup makes it incredibly convenient for both home and on-the-go use. It's easy to store, pack, and carry, making it ideal for travel, commuting, or outdoor activities. The smaller size also means it takes up less space in your bag or on your desk, reducing clutter and maximizing efficiency.

**Reduced Waste**

Opting for a reusable 8 oz cup significantly reduces your reliance on disposable cups, contributing to a more sustainable lifestyle. By replacing single-use paper or plastic cups with a durable, reusable option, you minimize waste and conserve resources. This simple change can have a significant positive impact on the environment over time.

**Cost Savings**

While the initial investment in a reusable 8 oz cup may be higher than purchasing disposable cups, it proves to be more economical in the long run. By eliminating the need to constantly buy disposable cups, you save money over time. Additionally, some coffee shops offer discounts to customers who bring their own cups, further incentivizing the use of reusable options.

**Versatile Use**

The 8 oz cup is a versatile vessel suitable for a wide range of beverages, from coffee and tea to juice and water. Its compact size makes it ideal for children, seniors, and anyone who prefers smaller servings. It can also be used for soups, snacks, and desserts, adding to its overall versatility and utility.

 ## FAQs Section

Addressing common consumer questions about 8 oz cups ensures clarity and informed purchasing decisions.

**What materials are best for retaining heat in an 8 oz cup?**

Double-walled stainless steel and vacuum-insulated cups are the most effective for retaining heat. These materials and construction methods minimize heat transfer, keeping your beverages hot for longer periods. Ceramic cups also offer good insulation but may not be as durable as stainless steel.

**Are all 8 oz cups dishwasher safe?**

Not all 8 oz cups are dishwasher safe. Check the manufacturer's instructions before placing your cup in the dishwasher. Cups made from delicate materials like thin glass or those with intricate designs may be damaged by the high temperatures and harsh detergents of a dishwasher.

**How do I choose the right lid for my 8 oz cup?**

Consider the intended use of the cup. If you'll be using it on the go, choose a lid that is leak-proof and has a secure locking mechanism. Look for lids made from BPA-free materials and those that are easy to clean. Some lids also offer features like a sliding closure or a sip-through opening for added convenience.

**What are the environmental benefits of using a reusable 8 oz cup?**

Using a reusable 8 oz cup reduces your reliance on disposable cups, minimizing waste and conserving resources. Disposable cups often end up in landfills, contributing to pollution and environmental degradation. By opting for a reusable option, you help reduce your carbon footprint and promote a more sustainable lifestyle.

# Best 8 oz Cups with Lids 2025: Top Brands Reviewed

The ubiquitous 8 oz cup with lid is a staple in homes, offices, and cafes. Whether you're enjoying a morning coffee, packing a child's lunch, or serving samples at an event, these cups offer convenience and portability.

[[Browse top-rated 8 oz cups with lids on Amazon]](https://petsknows.com/hot-selling-items/?kw=8+oz+cups+with+lids)
 ## Key Features Analysis

The selection of 8 oz cups with lids often depends on specific needs, and the features vary significantly across brands. Understanding these features is crucial for selecting the right product.

**Material Composition:** The materials used in the cup and lid construction greatly influence durability, heat resistance, and environmental impact.

Plastic cups are typically made from polypropylene (PP) or polystyrene (PS), with PP being more heat resistant and recyclable. Paper cups usually feature a polyethylene (PE) lining or a plant-based PLA lining to prevent leaks. Lids are often made from PET or PP. High-quality cups and lids will be BPA-free and meet food-grade standards. The composition affects the cup's ability to hold hot or cold beverages and impacts its overall strength when handled.

**Lid Seal and Leak Resistance:** A secure lid is crucial to prevent spills and maintain beverage temperature.

Look for lids that snap or tightly fit onto the cup rim to create a leak-proof seal. Some lids feature a raised edge or inner rim to further enhance the seal. The quality of the lid material also impacts its ability to maintain a tight fit over time. Vent holes in the lid can help prevent pressure build-up, but they should be designed to minimize leaks when the cup is tilted. The tightness of the seal is paramount when transporting hot or cold liquids.

**Insulation Properties:** The level of insulation determines how well the cup maintains the temperature of the beverage.

Double-walled cups provide superior insulation compared to single-walled options. Air gaps between the walls slow down heat transfer, keeping hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold for longer. Some cups feature an additional layer of insulation, such as foam or a specialized coating, for even greater temperature retention. The effectiveness of the insulation directly impacts the drinking experience, particularly for those consuming hot beverages.

**Stackability and Storage:** Efficient storage is a key consideration, especially for businesses and individuals who use a large number of cups.

Cups designed for optimal stackability minimize storage space. Look for cups with tapered sides and lids that can be nested together easily. Some brands offer dispenser boxes or storage solutions specifically designed for their cups and lids. The shape and material of the cup influence how many can be stacked without toppling or getting damaged.

**Cup Design and Aesthetics:** The appearance of the cup can impact brand perception and user satisfaction.

Cups are available in a wide range of colors, patterns, and finishes. Some brands offer custom printing options for businesses that want to promote their logo or brand message. The design can range from basic and functional to sleek and stylish. The exterior feel of the cup is also important as a rough exterior can be annoying.

**Environmental Considerations:** Consumers are increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of disposable cups.

Look for cups made from recyclable or compostable materials. Paper cups with PLA linings are a more sustainable alternative to traditional polyethylene-lined cups. Some brands offer recycling programs or partner with environmental organizations to promote responsible disposal. Choosing cups made from sustainable materials helps reduce waste and minimize environmental footprint.

 ## Core Benefits

Choosing the right 8 oz cup with a lid provides several tangible benefits for various users.

**Enhanced Portability and Convenience:** 8 oz cups with lids make it easy to enjoy beverages on the go. This is especially beneficial for commuters, travelers, and parents packing lunches. The secure lid prevents spills, allowing for worry-free transport in bags or car cup holders. For those who lead busy lifestyles, these cups provide a convenient way to enjoy their favorite drinks anywhere.

**Improved Temperature Retention:** Insulated 8 oz cups with lids help keep beverages hot or cold for longer periods. This is particularly useful during outdoor events, long meetings, or when traveling. Maintaining the desired temperature enhances the drinking experience and prevents beverages from becoming lukewarm or watered down. Insulated cups ensure drinks are enjoyed as they should be.

**Reduced Risk of Spills and Messes:** The tight-fitting lids on these cups minimize the risk of spills, especially when used by children or in crowded environments. This prevents stains on clothing, furniture, and car interiors. The reduction in spills also minimizes cleanup efforts and saves time. The secure design offers peace of mind when handling beverages in various settings.

**Cost-Effectiveness for Businesses:** For coffee shops, restaurants, and catering services, 8 oz cups with lids offer a cost-effective way to serve beverages to customers. They eliminate the need for reusable mugs, reducing dishwashing costs and labor. Disposable cups also provide a sanitary option for serving samples or offering takeaway drinks. The low cost per unit makes them a practical choice for high-volume businesses.

**Versatile Usage in Various Settings:** 8 oz cups with lids are suitable for a wide range of applications, from serving coffee and tea to packaging snacks and desserts. They can be used at home, in the office, at parties, and during outdoor events. Their versatility makes them a valuable addition to any pantry or catering supply. The ability to hold both hot and cold items makes them a practical solution for various needs.

 ## FAQs Section

Consumers often have questions about the materials, usage, and environmental impact of 8 oz cups with lids.

**Are the lids on these cups truly leak-proof?**
While no lid is 100% leak-proof under all conditions, high-quality lids with a tight seal minimize the risk of spills. Look for lids that snap securely onto the cup rim and feature a raised edge or inner rim to prevent leakage. Vent holes in the lid can sometimes cause minor leaks when the cup is tilted excessively. Proper handling and upright positioning are crucial to prevent spills.

**Can I recycle or compost these cups and lids?**
Recyclability and compostability depend on the materials used in the cup and lid construction. Paper cups with polyethylene (PE) linings are generally not recyclable in most municipal recycling programs. However, paper cups with plant-based PLA linings are compostable in commercial composting facilities. Plastic cups made from polypropylene (PP) are often recyclable, but check with your local recycling guidelines. Always dispose of cups and lids properly to minimize environmental impact.

**Are these cups suitable for hot beverages?**
Most 8 oz cups with lids are designed to withstand hot beverages, but it's important to check the product specifications. Cups made from polypropylene (PP) are typically more heat-resistant than polystyrene (PS) cups. Double-walled cups offer better insulation and prevent the cup from becoming too hot to handle. Avoid using cups that are not specifically labeled for hot beverages, as they may melt or warp.

**Do these cups affect the taste of the beverage?**
High-quality cups and lids made from food-grade materials should not impart any noticeable taste or odor to the beverage. However, some cheaper cups may have a slight plastic or paper taste, especially when used with hot liquids. To avoid this, choose cups from reputable brands that use premium materials. Rinsing the cups before use can also help remove any lingering odors.

1k1vfjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1k1vfjr/hometown_coffee_run_but_not/,Hometown coffee run but not,"I’ve had this dream many times over the last 10+ years. I go through long periods where I don’t dream much then boom I start having them again and this one pops up a lot. I’ll try to explain what I see…
I’m usually driving in my car from my parents house to highschool and I want to get a coffee first. That’s always true and known but where I go to get it changes…

Sometimes I take what must be the backroads of my parents house through the woods to a Starbucks that’s at the end of a long road alone. Then I have to go the long way around town to school so I always feel rushed when I go to that one.
Sometimes I try that Starbucks but it has a line so I drive past and go to a Burger King like place and I never remember what I get.

Sometimes I’ve gone clear across town to the other side (no where near the highschool) and I go to a small grocery store that doesn’t exist. I know what the inside looks like, kind of a small new seasons and it’s next door to a Chinese food restaurant and donut shop. None of these places exist. The area of town I’m in is actually more industrial and kinda old housing. 

Sometimes I go through a part of downtown that in real life is small stores but in this world it’s all fast food and mini marts, very busy and dirty. I go through a drive thru Dunkin’ Donuts and I’m so happy. Ive never been to one by the way I live on the west coast so I’ve never even seen one other than commercials. 
So that’s my coffee dream. I love when I have it but I wish I knew why. It’s like visiting an alternate town.

Songkran was a blast – celebrated with an amazing bunch of local mates and fellow travelers, but now that the festivity’s over and everyone’s back to work, I’ve been moving solo, exploring new cafes and work spots daily.

If you’re also working remotely and into exploring cool coffee places together, hit me up – I’m all for coworking hangs with good vibes. Recommendations are most welcome:))

That said, I’m also super into fitness – calisthenics, running, gym, or Muay Thai – so if that’s your thing too, even better. I’m down for real convos, sharing stories, and making good connections while we’re all out here doing our thing.

I’m not a big drinker, but I do enjoy a chill smoke time to time – so if that’s your thing, we can vibe that way too.

## What is Nebrion Stack?

Nebrion Stack is an **automated trading platform** designed to assist users by analyzing market trends and executing trades based on pre-set strategies. Think of it as your always-on trading assistant that doesn’t sleep, doesn’t eat, and doesn’t get emotional when Bitcoin drops 5% in 10 minutes.

It’s aimed at both newcomers who want a smooth entry into trading and more experienced folks looking for a tool to simplify their portfolio management. It supports multiple asset classes—crypto, forex, stocks, and commodities—which is a plus for anyone who doesn’t want all their eggs in one basket.

## Who Created Nebrion Stack?

There’s no single celebrity founder behind Nebrion Stack like you’d see with Elon Musk hyping Dogecoin. The platform appears to be built by a **team of fintech developers and trading specialists**, many of whom have backgrounds working with platforms similar to **Bitcoin Era** and **Immediate Edge**.

While the creators prefer to keep things low-key, the platform itself is well-documented and maintained, with regular updates and active customer support. That’s usually a sign that the team is more focused on improving the product than building a personal brand.

You can monitor trades, tweak settings, or withdraw funds while waiting in line for your coffee.

One of my favorite features is the **custom alerts system**. You can set alerts for price thresholds, market volatility, or even news-based triggers. Super handy if you’re not glued to your screen 24/7.

I tested both. The live chat was quick and helpful, though responses can be slightly generic at times. Email support took about 6 hours to reply, which is okay but not lightning-fast.

Still, better than most platforms I’ve dealt with.

1k1vdg4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k1vdg4,Some thoughts after revisiting EDP Extreme and Ambrée from Givenchy's Gentleman Society line,"My only experiences with both fragrances until today were smelling them on tester strips. I decided that I wanted to retry them (on skin this time), to have a better, more ""informed"" opinion of both.

• *EDP Extreme* - My first impressions of this fragrance were not positive at all, I thought it was a very dislikeable scent with a bothersome sweet note and that it didn't smell like the regular EDP at all. Retrying it, I can definitely see the similarities with the regular EDP, to the point I find it redundant to own both, as they're very similar and even more so in the dry down. This time I could also smell the coffee note and it's quite nice but it's somewhat elusive and doesn't stick around too long. 3/10 -> 7/10

• *Ambrée* - My first impressions were that it was a very bland and boring ambery scent with small hints of tobacco and vanilla, and that it also didn't resemble the regular EDP Gentleman Society at all. Trying it on skin the tobacco and vanilla are more noticeable, but I still don't think it's a great fragrance. The tobacco in this fragrance immediately reminded me of Tom Ford's Tobacco Oud, but I suppose a more accurate comparison of the scent overall (that may still be very inaccurate to other people's perceptions) would be Maison Margiela's Jazz Club, although I prefer that fragrance much, much more. I also started noticing similarities to the other two fragrances from the Gentleman Society line, although I'd still say this is the most different of the three and redundant to own if you have either of them and/or Jazz Club (as is my case). 5/10 -> 7/10

Overall, I still think regular Gentleman Society is the best of the three, but I'm definitely biased as I own a bottle of it and I kept misguided first impressions on Extreme and Ambrée for a long time. I can also totally see now why many people think Extreme is the best of the line. Who knows, maybe my thoughts on Reserve Privée will also change for the better once I try that one on skin.

As a small bonus, I also tried Gentleman Eau de Parfum Boisée, a flanker of the Gentleman line I was very interested in trying and it blew me away. The smell was instantly familiar to me, and while I didn't immediately know which fragrance it reminded me of, something in my head was telling me ""*it's Creed*"". After a while I thought of Green Irish Tweed and looked up the notes for both fragrances, and both have iris with sandalwood in the base. Obviously they're very different fragrances, Green Irish Tweed is a green, old fashioned fougère, whereas Gentleman Boisée is a creamy and sweet but refined night time fragrance. Still, their iris accords stood out as extremely similar to my nose, and they're also very prominent accords of both fragrances to my nose. Boisée is now on my fragrance shortlist, and thankfully it's a fragrance that can be found quite cheap on discounters.",2,1744946815.0,Colognes,0,1.0,False

1k1vc8x,https://i.redd.it/rc9pb3jfiive1.jpeg,Ghosting Part 2 ◇,"As mentioned in the previous post; I've had a few paranormal experiences and will describe them up ahead. 

When I got back to what was left of my home post war in late 2020; there was little to look up to - what hasn't been destroyed by the war, was either vandalised or ransacked by thieves.

Like many others living in that area; we were all broke from being ""internally displaced"" and paying exorbitant rent fees for the past 16+ months.

Obviously I had to fix and restore my home on my own.

There was something eerie in the atmosphere and the first thing we all noticed was the absence of chirping birds in the area; or even cats.

Every few hours, you could hear a booby trap go off and people rushing to the rescue etc.

In order to restore my home, 
I was making use of tools such a mason's hammer, angle grinder, Stanley knife and they can all cause serious injuries.

Each time I got to work on something, I would suddenly get mentally carried away in a sort of dream lile state or I'd randomly picture something terrible in my mind for no reason.  

It only happens when I'm using sharp or heavy tools and almost always I'd seriously hurt myself. 
It was like something was interfering with my mind.

One day I suddenly woke up for no reason and decided to stay still so-as to catch more sleep.
But then I had a feeling that something or someone was in my room; I rapidly removed the blanket from my face and flipped myself to see if someone was by the door - and there SHE was.

A figure was standing by the door looking at me; she had long black hair covering her face and back - at knee level - wearing a long white gown with long white sleeves.  

She was almost twice as tall as me and her head was almost touching the ceiling - her skin was visible only from the hands and it was pale white.

When I saw her, she disappeared in a blink of an eye.

One day I was napping on the sofa and I suddenly woke up for no reason; then I heard foot steps stomping on the floor from the room behind me; as if someone was running towards me.  Then I felt sort of two hands ( impact points ) push me violently off the sofa and sent me crashing against the coffee table.

Luckily I didn't get hurt and I was mostly in disbelief of what happened before I could get up.

So now its ""brain fog"" each time I use sharp tools leading to injury, a tall pale girl with long black hair watching over me; and flying off the sofa against the coffee table.

Not bad; I was starting to like this ( except getting stitches post injuries ).

Anyway, to wrap it up, I moved to a different house due to work - I was restoring it post war etc. and it was located in another war torn territory.

From day one shit got real; my dog refused to walk into the property and that's VERY unusual.  He literally clamped his claws to the ground and no matter how hard I pulled on the leash, he refused to walk in.

I brought him food but nope; he looked scared.  After a few hours I was able to pull him in and shut the gate; but he insisted on staying glued to the gate.  

To me that's super strange cause I expected him to go crazy and sniff around the new territory etc.

I made some lunch and he still looked scared and went hiding in a corner; I was getting frustrated at his attitude but there's nothing I could do about it.

After lunch I decided to take a nap before doing some work etc. and boom I had a nightmare.  I've never ever had nightmares in years and let alone a nightmare during a daytime nap.  The best part is that during the nightmare I was seeing myself exactly sleeping where I was and some humanoid creatures walking up to me and thus waking me up.

I was scared by their looks and how they managed to get into the house while I was sleeping but decided not to go into that since there was 4 or 5 of them.

They spoke to me in a threatening tone and continuously asked me if I really wanted to live in this house.

Suddenly I woke up and sat down trying to make sense of what happened.  I made some coffee, checked on my dog ( still in a corner ) and started doing some cleaning.

At sunset I lit up a bonfire with all the trash I collected and began making dinner. 

Suddenly my dog walks out of the corner he was hiding in all day and started growling at a wall, as if he was seeing someone - but its just a wall.
Then he started barking and I got kinda scared cause usually he's never that aggressive - no matter how many times I called his name or told him to stop, he wouldn't stop growling and barking viciously.

I won't mention the dog breed but its a hunting dog that can take down an adult human - they sense danger before we do.

Anyway, after this second ""unusual incident"" we went to sleep.  As I tried to fall asleep and making sense of what happened so far - I heard stuff being thrown on the floor from the room next door.  I went to check and indeed I found all the things I'd put in a corner of the room spilt out on the floor.

At this point I was starting to believe that this house is haunted.  

In the next few months, my dog kept growling at the walls and ceiling for no reason; and I kept having nightmares no matter how or where or when I slept.

The only times I was able to get some uninterrupted sleep, was when I burned incense before sleeping.  

At anyrate, if you got any similar experiences, do write a post about it or let me know via dm.

Im also open to go visit haunted locations and perhaps bring my dog along; if anyone knows of such locations - let me know.",1,1744946704.0,Libyan_Expats,0,1.0,False

Diagnosed around Christmas, went on to 20mg for a month and got the usual life changing buzz for the first couple of weeks and continued with usual caffeine intake (1-2 coffees a day) but after two weeks I wasn’t feeling much improvement. Usual dry mouth which is when I could tell it was kicking in.

I went up to 30mg for two months, much the same experience with a bit of a buzz and could maintain caffeine intake but again after a couple of weeks wasn’t noticing a positive difference. 

I’m now a month or so into 40mg (I requested 2x20mg as I work shift work and I wanted the option for a lower dose on shorter days), what I noticed here was a delay in the medication taking affect, I’m not sure if this is because I opted for 2x capsules. The 40mg makes me anxious more often than not when having my usual coffee. I trialled one day without coffee which reduced the anxiety but it gave me a wicked headache in the afternoon. I also had a bit of chest pain/tightness on the 40mg, I’ve had it looked at and everything heart related is okay. I don’t recall getting any buzz when starting 40mg, I did notice however that I’d still have energy after coming home from work to get home tasks done and wouldn’t fall asleep straight after dinner.

I’m assuming any higher dosage will also bring on anxiety? Or is there some sweet spot I should be trying to find?

Should I be preparing to say goodbye to coffee whilst medicated?

My psych is quite hard to communicate with and seems to just ask me what I want to do and doesn’t provide any advice.

If anyone has any advice moving forward please let me know 🙏 I’ve opted to take 20mg for the past three days and whilst I can still function, it’s very much not noticeable.",2,1744946584.0,adhdaustralia,2,0.75,False

1k1v94q,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1k1v94q/this_time_is_way_easier/,This time is way easier!,"So I tried quitting caffeine for 6 weeks back in 2021 & was miserable.

Tired, sure. But it was more that life felt less sparkly. I was bored and low level depressed without caffeine.

I figured that caffeine just made life better so I was just gonna have to stick with it.

Fast forward to this year - I’m 11 days decaf (I know, not that long) - but it’s been SO EASY & better than that - I am actually just as happy without it??!?

Had a headache for a few hours on day 2 & needed an afternoon nap a few days that first week, but now I feel stabilized!

I’ve been trying to figure out the difference between 3 years ago & now, and this is all I’ve come up with:

1. I’ve been drinking 32 oz of daily infusions thx to an herbalist in working with for over a year.

She made a comment that “you should never make a change before flooding the body with nutrients” - so I feel like all this herbal tea has built up my body to be able to support me without caffeine.

2. Breakfast!! I was doing bullet proof coffee all morning & skipping breakfast (and sometimes lunch 🙈) when drinking caffeine —

(I have adhd so caffeine really turned up the volume on me forgetting to eat)

I think having 3 solid meals a day immediately helped with energy levels.

3. Reconfigured my business 

I’m self employed and 3 years ago I still had client work I didn’t like that I’d fuel with caffeine. So when I quit I didn’t have the motivation to do the work I hated, and just had to sit in hating it.

I’ve changed a lot to my business since then and I have mainly work I really enjoy doing so I don’t need caffeine as a motivator.

4. Dancing!

I grew up competitive dancing but dropped it in college & for 15 years - it’s such a big part of me & such a source of joy & I completely forgot about it!

I started taking dance classes again every week and it’s EVERYTHING.

Waking up the first two-ish days were a lot harder since I was adjusting but I believe I am falling asleep faster now. I also find myself getting up before my alarms most of the time. I have a sleep window of 5.5 hours, and it’s not generally recommended to go under that, so I guess I am just letting the sleep pressure build and my body will take it when it wants it.

After Week 1, my sleep is still fragmented, but I expect that to change in the upcoming weeks.

Also, newer update today: I drank 1 cup of coffee instead of 2 this morning. I was really feeling the fatigue today as a result. I’ll adjust as I go, but hopefully less coffee will help me sleep better at night. I doubt it has much impact, but nothing better than for me to try and see.

I’m making progress, and I’ll stick the journey whether improvements are big or small.

I hope this week has been at least okay for everyone, and I hope my posts about my experience offer you some clarity. I understand sleep-related issues are difficult to deal with.

I met a guy from bumble at first we had a coffee date tamang kwentuhan and chill. I invited him at my place since I need to log in due to work. He showed his interest to me then he decided to delete his account sa bumble same goes to me. He said he wanted to know me more at ligawan (walang nangyaring eme that night). 

Kinabukasn pauwi na siya he asked me to go out miryenda lng at sumama naman ako sa drill kwentuhan snd chill punta ulit sa house ko pero nothing happened umuwi rin siya ng mga 7pm i guess. 

Third pagkikita naman he ask before that day if puede tambay sa bahay ng whole day I said yes. So tamang order food nuod ng movie hangang sa umabot ng late night at inantok siya. Late rin ako naka sleep tabi kami morning nagising ako kasi I can feel his hands touching my face, kissing me in my forehead. I find it sweat actually hangang sa umabot ng passionate kiss then something happened. After that we had cuddles, then deep talks inamin niya sa akin that he smokes and that’s one of my big NO talaga sa isang guy. He was trying to explain his side why siya nag smoke kaso as person nga na sarado ang pag iisip about that wala ayoko talaga. Then may emergency siya and he needed to go home.

Kinabukasan nag kita naman kami he explained his side pero wala talaga ung utak ko hindi talaga ko talaga matangap. But the thing is he made it sure na I will accept him kasi nga may nangyari na sa amin. Wala tanga eh after ng mahabang pag uusap I found myself I love him na din so naging kami.

Marami kaming diskusyon about weeds kasi nga pro siya for that at ako hindi. Nung nakilala ko siya siya naka stop siya mag smoke duto to important matter. So after 3 months bumalik siya ulit mag smoke dumating nanung araw na pinaka ayaw ko talaga umiyak talaga ako ngvsobra and yung traumas ko bumalik. Halos 2 weeks kaming away bati because of it. 
I asked him once “will you sacrifice you habit over our relationship” and he said yes, pero sabi niya it’s should be not the word “habit” daw it’s “peace of mind” daw ang tamang salita. 

Sobra akong nasaktan sa part na un na grabe niya ijustify which is habit na eh kasi hindi mawala sa kanya eh yun. Ang dinadahilan niya it gives him peace of mind. We also talked about na pano ako I’m not okay with that pero I want to keep our relationship, pero sabi niya importante din daw sa kanya yun kasi before pa niya ako makilala ginagawa na niya un.

I asked him gano ako ka importante sa kanya? Sinasama or naiisip ba niya ako kahit minsan sa mga disiyon niya and he said yes. Sabi ko kung ganun pala asan ako sa disisyon mo about weeds if you know na ayaw ko niyan. Sabi ko madaming mag babago kasi nasa isang relasyon ka na after 3 years of being single. Yet he said im not yet ready for changes. Sabi niya di ko daw siya tanggap sabi thats not true. Iba kasi ung tanggap ko siya sa hindi ko tanggap ang bisyo lang niya. Kaya nga I’m still here with you eh kasi iba talaga pag mahal mo yung isang tao ang dami mo ring isa sacrifice, pero bigla akong napatanong sa sarili ko bakit hindi siya ready mag sacrifice? 

So ito ako tinitiis ko ung sakit and peace of mind ko whenever he is smoking sometimes nababaliwala ako we had agreements of him usuing it pero minsan hindi niya natutupad.
Di ko na alam if itutuloy ko pa, kasi wala eh nababastusan na rin ako. I’m too afraid losing him, im too afraid to be alone again after 2 years of being single din. Pero bakit hindi ko maramdamam na he is not afraid of loosing me as well, he is more afraid of loosing his habit. 

Sabi ko kanya ano pang silbi ko? I assured him I can help him. I can give him the peace of mind that wants. I will help him and there for him whenever na di siya ok. But he still wants weeds parin. Pakiramdam ko kulang talaga ako, thats why weeds parin ang pinipili niya to help him.

# Conclusion

The Profitec GO is widely regarded as one of the best single-boiler espresso machines on the market, offering excellent build quality, temperature stability, and consistent performance. Users particularly appreciate its PID temperature control, adjustable pressure, and overall reliability. The main limitations stem from its single-boiler design, which creates a more sequential workflow for milk drinks compared to dual-boiler machines.

For espresso enthusiasts who primarily drink straight espresso or make occasional milk drinks, the GO represents excellent value. However, those who frequently make multiple milk-based drinks may want to consider a dual-boiler alternative. Overall, Reddit users express high satisfaction with the Profitec GO, with many considering it an ""end-game"" single-boiler machine that offers professional-level quality at a reasonable price point.",1,1744945824.0,UnSponsoredReviews,0,1.0,False

So at one point, he came over to the desk that I had my coffee and my belongings at, sat down and started working, which was right behind me at the station that I was working . My coffee has a distinct smell that everybody says smells so good and is always asking about. It’s a crème brûlée coffee with vanilla almond milk creamer.

He eventually comes over and asked me about my coffee and what is my vice. I tell him espresso and he offered to buy me an espresso from Starbucks. I take him up on his offer and he goes to buy me espresso on his lunch. He brings me the espresso and I say thank you very sweetly. My nerves were shot y’all and I’m sure my brown skin was completely flush. I can barely look at this man without thinking dirty things about him.

1k1uzrs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k1uzrs,Lunch at Esterre by Alain Ducasse (*) - Tokyo,"Had lunch at Esterre in Palace Hotel Tokyo last weekend. They offer several different prix fixe menus for lunch, as well as a full tasting course. I went with the cheaper prix fixe lunch menu.

The meal started with an assortment of fresh seasonal vegetables from a farm near the chef’s house in Kamakura, along with edamame(iirc) focaccia and olive mayonnaise. Then came the amuse-bouche: a shiitake mushroom with fresh vegetables and a rapeseed blossom.

After that, they served two kinds of bread, both on the glutinous side, with a generous serving of butter that had an almost blue cheese-like taste to it. Then they offered a selection of other small breads. I went with the sobako one, which seemed to be lightly pan-fried, similar to a Chinese Sheng Jian Bao. It was so good I asked for a second.

The starter was Warm green asparagus, pigeon and shallots. Very good — I’m not a big fan of asparagus, but this one was fantastic. The asparagus sauce was very light and paired beautifully with the char-grilled pigeon. Probably the highlight of the meal for me.

Then came the main dish: Local beef, tender potato and seasonal vegetables, cooking jus. Once again, pretty simple but elegant and perfectly executed. The vegetables had a nice saltiness to them, which balanced well with the sweeter potato and fatty wagyu beef.

After that, they offered a selection of cheese for an extra ¥3,000, from which you could choose three. The selection was great by Tokyo standards (which is a really low bar, to be honest), but nothing mind-blowing.

Dessert was Chocolate from Alain Ducasse Manufacture in Tokyo, light cream and cocoa nib praline, coffee ice cream. That was the only letdown of the meal. It wasn’t bad, but kind of one-dimensional. Just tasted like chocolate with a small crunchy coffee part in the center.

They also offered a selection of various teas, including some special blends. I went with a hibiscus and apple one (for an extra charge), which was good, but again, nothing out of the ordinary.

Lastly, they served small desserts - a chocolate truffle and a canelé - which were both among the better ones I’ve tried in Tokyo.

The focus was clearly on local produce and bringing out the natural flavors of fresh ingredients - nothing overly complex, but very well executed. The total for two people came out to just under ¥40,000, including one cheese course, one extra tea, and two bottles of still water. The dining room was relatively compact and very elegant, and they had beautiful tableware. Service was great throughout. Jackets were required for men, and the clientele mostly consisted of older Japanese couples and a few business people, making it feel a bit too formal for a weekend lunch. One of the biggest higlights was definitely the view, overlooking Hibiya Park and the Imperial Palace, arguably better during the day than at night. Overall, a solid experience — and definitely worth a visit, at least for the view. ",12,1744945540.0,finedining,3,1.0,False

After getting frustrated with all the generic ""best camp stove"" listicles that clearly never tested the products, I decided to create the guide I wish existed when I started camping. I've personally tested over 15 different camp stoves across various conditions and compiled my findings into what I hope is actually useful information.

# Quick Summary of Top Picks:

**🚗 Car Camping King: Coleman Classic 2-Burner**  
No BS - it's not sexy, but it works every single time. I've had mine for 6 years and it still fires up instantly. Puts out 20K BTUs and costs about the same as two pizzas.

**🥾 Backpacking Beast: Jetboil Flash**  
100-second boil times aren't just marketing hype. I've timed it repeatedly. The integrated system just works, and I've yet to find anything that boils as efficiently while using so little fuel. Worth every penny if you backpack regularly.

**⚖️ Ultralight Winner: MSR PocketRocket 2**  
At 2.6oz, it's literally lighter than the energy bar you're eating. The flame control is surprisingly good for something so small, and it fits inside my coffee mug with a 100g fuel canister.

# The Controversial Takes:

* The BRS-3000T (that $17 Amazon ultralight stove) is a death trap. Mine melted after 3 uses.

My ex (33M) owns his own company and employs his uni friends, younger sister (23F), and a junior NZ staff member, so he has a lot more flexibility.

Over Christmas, his mum flew in from the UK to stay with us. Before she arrived, I let my partner and his sister know that due to tight finances (I’d had no income from July to October), I wouldn’t be able to join in on every outing. I was fully supporting myself, covering rent and my share of groceries (split 50% him, 25% each for me and his sister), even though I was spending more than I usually would feeding just myself. They reassured me said don’t worry, Mum will pay for everything.
For context, she runs a successful business and flew business class, so I took them at their word. When she arrived, she generously paid for a dinner and groceries. In return, I covered rounds of drinks, expensive pizzas, coffees, still a stretch for me financially, but I wanted to contribute meaningfully.

A few days later, his sister added all the big grocery shops to Splitwise. Then we were told their mum wanted to be reimbursed for the meals. I was now being asked to pay for things I wouldn’t have agreed to if I’d known upfront (especially after budgeting based on what I was told.)

Two more dinners were planned. I pulled out of one due to finances (it ended up cancelled), but the pressure and guilt were building.

Then came the final night before their mum flew out. I’d just started a new contract in a senior role,  my first time at this level. The job came with more responsibility, better pay, and a chance to prove myself. In film, you’re “only as good as your last job,” and I didn’t want to risk my reputation. I was doing 12-hour days remotely.

That day, I waited until my boss was out of a budget meeting to ask if I could leave technically 10 minutes early to make the dinner. I messaged her around 3:30pm, followed up at 5pm, no response.

At 5:45pm, his mum told me I was a “Silly Girl” for not asking earlier. I explained and offered to come late (the restaurant was 5 minutes away, and we usually spent the first 30–45 minutes having drinks before ordering). She said I couldn’t join late, so I told them to go ahead without me.

My partner was angry for days and later said missing that dinner was a reason he broke up with me.

I understand why he was hurt. I wish I’d been able to make it. But I felt like there was zero flexibility or understanding from their side. I’d been honest about my financial limits early on, stretched myself to contribute where I could, and prioritised a job I desperately needed.

So, Reddit. AITA for missing the dinner? Should I have handled it differently?

## What is Shift 8X Hiprex?

Shift 8X Hiprex is a newer player in the trading tech space that blends automation with hands-on trading. Think of it as a smart assistant that helps you make better trades without being overly complicated. Whether you're into crypto, Forex, or even commodities, Shift 8X Hiprex gives you a centralized hub to manage it all.

And yeah—it supports both manual and automated trading, which is a huge win if you want to test strategies with less risk.

## Who Created Shift 8X Hiprex?

While the exact team behind Shift 8X Hiprex isn’t fully public (which isn’t uncommon in the world of FinTech), it seems to be backed by a group of experienced traders and software developers. A bit like Bitcoin Code or Immediate Edge, it doesn’t focus on the personalities, but rather the tech.

From what I’ve gathered, the people behind it have a solid background in financial markets and AI-driven trading. That might explain why the platform feels polished and functional right out of the gate. Still, I’d personally like more transparency on the dev team in the future.

## How Does Shift 8X Hiprex Work?

Shift 8X Hiprex works by analyzing real-time market data and using algorithms to spot potential trading opportunities. You can either let the platform suggest trades for you (via automation) or take the reins and trade manually.

Here’s the general flow:
- It scans the market 24/7 and identifies trends or anomalies.
- You receive alerts or trade signals based on your settings.
- You can choose to act on them manually or set the system to auto-trade.
- Profits and losses are tracked in your dashboard, with analytics to help you adjust your strategy.

The algorithm isn’t magic, but it’s smart—especially if you know how to tweak the settings. And it’s nice that you can start with demo trading before risking real cash.

## Shift 8X Hiprex Pros and Cons

Here’s the good, the great, and the “meh” parts of using Shift 8X Hiprex:

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Shift 8X Hiprex?

Shift 8X Hiprex runs on pretty much anything with a browser. I tested it on my laptop, iPad, and Android phone—it worked smoothly on all.

Here’s the breakdown:
- **Desktop & Laptop** (Windows/macOS) – Full functionality
- **Tablet** – Slightly compressed UI but solid performance
- **Smartphone** – Fully responsive site, no lag

There’s no standalone app yet, but the mobile site is optimized well enough that you probably won’t miss it.

## Shift 8X Hiprex – Supported Countries

Shift 8X Hiprex supports a wide range of countries, including:
- **United States**
- **Canada**
- **United Kingdom**
- **Australia**
- **Germany**
- **South Africa**
- **India**

There are a few restrictions in regions with strict financial regulations (like North Korea or sanctioned countries), but for most users, access is straightforward. Just remember that KYC is mandatory, so you’ll need to verify your identity.

## Shift 8X Hiprex – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The real-time data engine is snappy and surprisingly accurate. It doesn’t just show you prices—it identifies patterns and opportunities. Think of it like TradingView, but simplified.

It’s fast enough for scalpers and detailed enough for swing traders. I found it helpful even when just watching and learning.

### User-Friendly Interface

The UI is clean. No ridiculous graphs or flashing numbers. Just a dashboard that tells you what matters: balance, positions, recent trades, and alerts.

Even if this is your first trading platform, you’ll feel comfortable in minutes. Honestly, it’s one of the least intimidating platforms I’ve used.

### Mobile Accessibility

No app yet, but it runs beautifully on mobile browsers. You can check trades while grabbing coffee or sitting on the train. Everything resizes automatically and doesn’t lag, which is more than I can say for some “big name” platforms.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set price alerts, volume changes, or even trigger notifications for certain trading patterns. Super helpful if you’re not glued to your screen 24/7.

This feature alone saved me from missing a couple of big moves.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Not just crypto. You can trade:
- **Forex**
- **Commodities**
- **Indices**
- **Stocks** (CFDs)

That means you can diversify your strategy without needing multiple platforms. Huge plus.

## Is Shift 8X Hiprex a Scam?

From my experience and research? Nope, not a scam.

It’s legit and functions as advertised. But like any trading platform, it’s not a guaranteed money machine. The algorithm helps, but you still need to use your brain. You’re not buying a golden goose here—you’re getting tools to trade smarter.

Also, withdrawals work. I tested it twice, and each time the funds arrived within 48 hours.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Shift 8X Hiprex?

The platform requires a **$250 minimum deposit** to start trading. Yeah, it’s not pocket change, but it’s also pretty standard for trading platforms like Bitcoin Era or Immediate Edge.

Would I prefer a lower entry point? Sure. But the upside is that it weeds out bots and unserious users.

### Shift 8X Hiprex Customer Support

Customer support is actually decent. I tested the live chat on a Sunday morning and got a reply in under 5 minutes. You can also reach them via email if you’re not in a rush.

They’re helpful, not robotic, and didn’t just copy-paste answers. So, thumbs up there.

## How do you start trading on Shift 8X Hiprex?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

- Done in under 2 minutes

Anyone else feel like every week there's a ""new and improved"" trading platform claiming to be the next big thing?

This is where Immediate +13X iQuix really shines. The platform uses **AI-powered algorithms** to scan global markets continuously. It looks for patterns, price changes, and news that could impact asset values. This gives users a real-time edge that manual traders often miss.

It’s great for catching short-term opportunities, especially in volatile markets like crypto.

That said, always be cautious. Never invest money you can’t afford to lose.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Immediate +13X iQuix?

The platform requires a **$250 minimum deposit** to start trading. That’s pretty standard for platforms like this, but I wish they offered a lower entry point for people just testing the waters.

1k1ujxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BelleBetting/comments/1k1ujxy/0417_belles_notes_i_had_to_write_about_this/,"04/17: Belle's Notes - I had to write about this. Finally, a normal (big?!) betting night. 🛎️☕️","**Holy hell, friends. As you know, the first half of April was stone cold** – I can't speak for anyone else, but it certainly was for me! To be honest, the first couple weeks of April are always a bit rough due to various factors: teams resting guys for playoffs, teams not caring because they're not going to be in the playoffs, starting pitchers still finding their stride... etc.

**That said, I had a cash cow betting day today.** For the last 3 months, these ""cash cow betting days"" have been a regular occurrence for me. But in April? It's the first time in 10 days, and I'm *thrilled*. But it's also prompting this post. If you're curious, get comfortable...

While there are plenty of reasons (as mentioned above) for April to be volatile, the *reason* for losses doesn't make them feel any less shitty. 😂 I do this for a living (and have been for quite some time now...) so a bad couple of weeks doesn't really phase my bankroll too much. I will say however, *it really does* wear one's patience down *thin*. I've been winning and cashing for months, and yet somehow 2 bad weeks still fucked up my mood. If I didn't post my picks publicly, this might not've been the case – but here we are ;)

**I'm being honest and candid about this for various reasons, but the biggest being this: cold streaks happen to everyone.**

If you're out there questioning your betting confidence, especially at this time of year – don't. Bad weeks (or hell, a bad month) happens to every bettor on the planet. Even the best.

A bad week doesn't make you not profitable. A bad month doesn't make you not profitable long-term. And it sure AF doesn't mean you're reading games wrong (well, perhaps sometimes... ha ha!) But early on in the season, it's always fun when two pitchers with a collective Earned Run Average of 20.0 decide to pitch the game of their lives when you're waiting on the Over to cash!

**But I digress.**

Over the last few months, I've noticed a number of new faces in this community, and I'm so grateful. ❤️🤩 I love sharing Pick of the Day, my Round Robins, and other fun wagers that I think we can all cash in on together.

**But hear this: I'm in this shit for the long haul, betting family.** If you're here to make a quick buck, that's cool – but if you're going to berate me when I go on bad run from time to time, promptly unfollow me. **On the other hand, if you're here to make your year substantially ""greener"", then hang around. And if you ever have questions about my picks or my process, I can't tell you how happy I am to assist. My door (DM inbox?) is quite literally always open.** 

I'm done rambling – but I figured *someone out there* might feel better reading this. Feel free to drop comments if you have thoughts or questions. **As for my cash cow betting night, here's how I did:**

There’s this cabin I know. Down south a-ways, tucked into the side of a mountain between the trees and the quiet. Not much to it, really — just enough.

A firepit out front for the crisp nights.  
A hot tub out back, perched on a balcony with a view of nothing but trees.  
Inside, it’s all flannel sheets and cozy corners.  
A classic arcade cabinet for rainy days — but no Paperboy, I’m afraid.  
And a tiny kitchen with a coffee pot and a fridge, for storing the essentials.

Like looooots of alcohol… (What? You thought I was gonna stop being *fun*? I said cut *back*, not cut *out*. And no, baby… I am never letting you live *that one* down… ever.)

I imagine sending you a map pin and a couple of dates. No context. Just: This is where I’ll be. If you feel like disappearing for a bit…

Meet me there.

We’d sit by the fire, letting the flames dance while we talked about everything… or nothing at all.  
One hand for holding, the other for swirling drinks.

One arm around you, if you’d let me. I’d keep you warm — you know I would.

And the hot tub…

We could let the jets work out the aches in our backs, your head resting on my chest, the water swirling around us…

Or… we could do whatever it is two people who are wildly into each other might do in a hot tub on the side of a mountain, in the woods, with no one else for miles around to see…

or hear…

And mornings would slip by slow, warm, lazy — staying cozy under those covers for as long as we pleased. Then we’d head out to the nearby state park — a place I visited many a childhood summer…

I’d show you the view from the natural bridge. You’d take all the nature photos you want…

I’d end up taking more of you, though.

Maybe one night we’d wander into the nearest town for dinner. Nothing too fancy. Not sure there’s anything fancy out there anyway — but that’s fine.

I’d be with you.

And that’s all that really matters.

And then we’d head back to the cabin and maybe do that thing in the hot tub again…

You know.

If you wanna.

Mmm. Sounds dreamy to me.

But, baby… these trips? They aren’t just for me — they’re for *us*. So, don't be shy… I'd always *love* to hear about what happens in that pretty head of yours…

I’m a young woman in my mid twenties. Unfortunately I am quite conventionally attractive (fit, curvy, petite, long hair, nice eyes, lips etc.) and I understand why many people want to fuck me. But I’m over it 🙃 

I’m a sensitive, intense and weird person. I want someone to love me for that. I’ve experienced too many times the feeling of being desired by someone, only to see their shock and horror when they find out I’m a real person, with real feelings and fucked up parts to my life that I want real human connection to be able to survive through. 

I’ve also experienced violent backlash by simply telling men no. Nothing has fucked up my life more than a man who is in love with an idea of what he can get from me, all the while deeply hating who I am. I’m not your manic pixie. 

Anyways. Yesterday i was working on my computer in a coffee shop. A man behind me was working at a table as well. When i got up to leave, he ran and stopped me at the door. I took my headphones off reluctantly. He said, “I noticed you, what is your name? Go on a date with me” 

That scenario is a common daydream I’ve had myself. I was flattered, kinda. But in my experience, its more fun in fantasy than reality. 

In reality, I felt violated. How long was I being watched? Was he going to be able to take a no? Could I come back to this coffee shop in the future or would this now be an issue?

On the one hand, I do admire his courage and I could give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he’s a great person. But in that moment, he’s a stranger. It was too direct and based off of my looks, or my “mysterious intrigue” which.. 🤮

“I don’t know anything about you to know if I would want to take the risk of possibly being stalked or killed or both” would have been the most honest answer I could have given him. But perhaps that’s too direct. In reality I said a reluctant, “sure” but I will not be following up. I don’t care too much if I’m shitty for that. It might be saving me my life. 

I’m a romantic myself. I want to believe there are good people out there and that spontaneous connections like that can happen and be great. That has not been my experience. Taking risks has gotten me hurt too consistently. 

I know Reddit is an incel infested dumpster fire, but it’s the only place I have at the moment to confide to the masses about these things. 

People of Reddit, is it reasonable to be creeped out by a stranger wanting a date? Without chatting me up or even giving me his name? Regardless, I’m not that impressed. ",2,1744943374.0,AITAH,4,0.75,False

I re-ground it to finest level on my grinder . And to my surprise pulled a decent double shot in normal time range, and… had a nice cream layer.  

This was about a 3 month old folder black silk coffee bin, that was open about a month prior (before I got my first espresso machine).   I like to buy in bulk so have several new bins , and hate to waste stuff.   So I decide to get good at making americano espresso with it.  I mix shots a 2.5 water ratio and comes out very good for americano.   Add some cardamom pod grounds that my daughter got for me for health, and ground cinnamon for a health and touch of sweetness. 

Gotta say, for a dirt cheap coffee, the old black silk makes a cool looking shot and good tasting americano .  

Also makes a very good chocolate milk based Caffè macchiato. ",1,1744943134.0,espresso,0,0.67,False

I just moved here and didn't bring a coffee grinder and don't really want to buy one right now. 

I was just wondering if anyone could help me with some vocab. First of all, how do I ask if they can grind beans for me? I've tried asking using 'hiku' as the verb, but I've got some quizzical looks with that (which could also just be because of my poor Japanese in general). Secondly, I want a grind that's fine but not as fine as espresso. 'Hosobiki' worked once but doesn't always seem to be understood (again, that could just be my general Japanese). What would I say for medium grind? Or even better, fine-medium?

Between long shifts, endless charting, and trying not to live off granola bars, I’m supposed to keep up with IM and critical care for boards or CME credits, and it’s killing me. I’m so broke I’m reusing coffee filters and so zonked I forgot what a day off feels like. Marino’s ICU Book is my lifeline for understanding vents and shock, but it’s dense AF, and I heard UWorld’s qbank is gold for IM boards like ABIM, but it costs a fortune.

Any podcasts or apps you swear by for staying sharp in the ICU? I’m also hunting for free CME or study tools that aren’t total garbage. A friend in my program was raving about this qbank called Quizology CME during a late night study session. Said it’s free, with IM questions on stuff like cardio, ID, and pulm, which sounds clutch for boards or CME credits. It’s got some gamified vibe with badges, so it’s not a complete snooze, and wildest part they give you Amazon gift cards for answering questions. I’m like, “Free CME and I can buy a new notebook or actual food? No way.” But it seems too good to be true. I checked it out ([https://www.quizologycme.com/](https://www.quizologycme.com/)), and it looks legit, but I’m skeptical. Has anyone tried it? Are the questions solid for IM or CME, or just a distraction? Also, how do you even study or do CME when work’s crushing you?

1k1u5ot,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k1u5ot/this_is_how_onlyfans_ruined_my_life/,This Is How OnlyFans Ruined My Life.,"The walls were closing in, $40,000 in student loans suffocating me, instant ramen my only meal in a paper-thin apartment. The pandemic had crushed my barista job, leaving my bank account gasping at $12.37. I was treading water, barely, when the messages started. Random accounts, new ones every day, slipping into my DMs: “Start an OnlyFans. You’ll get rich. Trust me.”  

I thought they were bots, some creep’s twisted prank. But they kept coming, sharper, like they saw through me: “Start an OnlyFans. It’ll change your life. Or end it.” I don’t know why they shook me so bad, maybe I was desperate, but when my landlord taped a third eviction notice to my door, I caved.  

I wasn’t stupid. OnlyFans meant baring myself, but I’d be careful. I created Avery, a version of me who was fearless, seductive, nothing like quiet Joce who faded into shadows. I used filters, wigs, clever angles to keep my face secret. My first post, a shadowy hint, got 50 subscribers overnight. By the week’s end, I had 200, and the tips were unreal. $500. $800. $1200. Every ping on my phone was a high, like I was finally someone. I paid rent, bought groceries, got a new phone. I was flying.  

But the rush dragged something heavy. Comments turned hungry, less “you’re gorgeous,” more “give us everything.” If I didn’t give in, they got nasty: “You’re nothing without us.” I called them trolls, until I noticed something worse. Subscribers started dropping details they shouldn’t know: “Loved your red hoodie today, Joce.”

 “You looked stressed at the library.” I never shared my real life, never showed my face, but they knew. It started small, like coincidences, but soon it was every day, someone mentioning my favorite coffee shop, the exact time I left my apartment, even the song I’d been humming on the bus. My skin crawled, but I kept posting. I needed the money.  

Then he appeared. Username: Collector_J. No profile pic, just a void. His first message was too calm: “You’re perfect, Evangeline. You don’t belong here.”  

My heart stopped. Evangeline wasn’t my name. Nobody, not even my old roommates, knew about OnlyFans. I blocked him, but the next day, another account: “You can’t hide, Evangeline. I see you.” I deleted it, locked down every setting, but the messages kept coming, like he was wired into my phone: “You owe me, Evangeline. Come back.” They weren’t just texts, they’d pop up in my notes app, my email drafts, even my calculator history once, just that name, Evangeline, over and over.  

Sleep became a ghost. My phone buzzed all night, notifications from strangers who knew my routine, what I wore, where I ate. My apartment felt like a trap, like eyes were burning through the walls. I’d catch shadows in my peripheral vision, shapes that vanished when I turned.

One night, I woke to scratching at my window, fourth floor, no way up. I yanked the curtains shut, shaking, but in the morning, white lilies sat outside my door. The note read: “You looked terrified last night, Evangeline. I’m watching.” I tore it up, checked the locks, but the smell of those flowers lingered for days, like it was soaked into my skin.  

I didn’t delete OnlyFans then. I should’ve, but the money was my lifeline, and I thought I could gut it out. I started filming in a corner of my apartment, away from windows, using a cheap backdrop to hide anything personal. It didn’t help. The comments got weirder, more specific: “Why’d you move the lamp, Joce?” “That green wall’s new.” I hadn’t shown my apartment, not once, but they saw it. I stopped eating in my kitchen, stopped sleeping in my bed, curling up on the couch instead, and the phone clutched like a weapon.  

Then the video hit. I logged in to check my tips and saw a post I didn’t make. A blurry video, shot from above my bed, showing me sleeping. No wig, no filters, just Joce, laid bare, my real face exposed. The caption: “Evangeline, unmasked. Mine.” Comments exploded: “We see you now.” “You’re ours.” My subscribers spiked to thousands overnight, but their profiles were blank, names just numbers, all chanting: “Come home, Evangeline.” I watched the video again, hands shaking, trying to figure out how it was filmed. There was no camera in my room, no way anyone could’ve gotten in. But there I was, vulnerable, watched by thousands of eyes that weren’t human.  

I deleted OnlyFans that day, hands trembling so bad I could barely tap the screen. I erased Avery, changed my email, my number, my locks. I even threw out my laptop, thinking it was compromised. It didn’t stop. Gifts started showing up: earrings I’d browsed online, a notebook I’d lost in high school, a photo of me at 16 from an angle I’d never seen, like someone was standing over me. Each had a note: “You’re mine, Evangeline.” I burned the photo, but the next day, another appeared under my pillow, identical, the ink still wet.  

I moved to a new apartment, thinking distance would help. The first night, I found a crack in my bathroom mirror, hairline thin, like it’d been scratched from the inside. I covered it with a towel, but the gifts followed: a bracelet I’d never seen, a torn page from a 60s fashion magazine, a key that didn’t fit any lock I owned. My new phone, barely a week old, started glitching, apps opening on their own, photos I didn’t take filling my gallery, all of the mirrors, reflecting nothing but darkness.  

Then Collector_J texted my new number, one I hadn’t shared: “I have something you want, Evangeline. A video. Not yours. Hers. Do what I ask, and I’ll give it to you. Don’t, and everyone sees your face again.”  

My stomach dropped. Another video? Hers? I didn’t know what he meant, but the threat of my face being exposed again, after that nightmare post, was too much. He sent a photo next: a grainy still of a woman who looked like me, dressed in 60s clothes, her eyes wide with fear, standing in front of a mirror. The text: “She’s why they watch you. First request: find an old payphone, call the number I send, say her name three times. $500. I’ll know if you don’t.”  

I couldn’t breathe. That woman, her face so close to mine, and the idea that she was tied to this, to me, made my skin crawl. I didn’t want to do it, but the video he promised, it might explain who Evangeline was, why he was doing this. And if I didn’t, he’d ruin me, splash my face across the internet for those faceless subscribers to devour. So I went. I found a payphone, rusted and half-dead, in a sketchy lot. The number connected to static, then a faint hum, like someone breathing. I whispered “Evangeline” three times, my voice breaking, and hung up. My phone buzzed: $500 in my account, and a text: “Good. She heard you.”  

The requests kept coming, each one weirder, each one tightening the knot in my chest. He texted: “Find a woman’s scarf from the 60s in a thrift store, wear it for a day. $700. I’ll know if it’s not hers.” I rummaged through musty shelves, found a silk scarf with faded flowers, and wore it. It reeked of old perfume, and all day, I felt watched, like the fabric was choking me. When I took it off, my neck had faint red marks, like fingerprints. I tried to throw it out, but it was back in my closet the next morning, neatly folded. The payment came: “She liked it, Evangeline.”  

Another request: “Take a Polaroid of yourself, leave it under a streetlight at midnight. $900. Don’t look back when you walk away.” I used a beat-up camera from a pawn shop, snapped the photo, and left it where he said. Footsteps echoed behind me, too close, but I didn’t look. The next morning, the Polaroid was outside my door, my face scratched out, replaced with hers, eyes hollow. I locked it in a drawer, but that night, I heard scratching inside, like nails on wood. The payment came: “She’s closer now, Evangeline.”  

He asked me to record a voice memo, just me reading a poem he sent, something about mirrors and lost names, and upload it to a dead website. $1000. I did it, my voice shaking as I read the words, feeling like they weren’t mine. The site was gone the next day, but my phone started playing the memo at random, even when powered off, her voice mixing with mine, saying “Evangeline” at the end. The money hit: “She’s speaking through you, Evangeline.”  

The last request was the worst: “Stand in front of a mirror, hold a candle, stare at your reflection for ten minutes. $1200. Don’t blink too much.” I did it, hands shaking as the flame danced. My reflection started to shift, my eyes turning older, emptier. She smiled, a woman who wasn’t me, her lips moving silently, forming my name, Jocelyn. I dropped the candle, and the room went dark, but her face stayed, glowing in the glass. The money hit: “She sees you, Evangeline.”  

Every request made her stronger. I started seeing her everywhere. In mirrors, windows, my phone screen, even a spoon. A woman who looked like me but wasn’t. Her eyes were wrong, too old, too empty, like she’d seen something awful. I’d blink, and she’d vanish, but each time, I felt less like Joce. My dreams were hell. I’d wake up choking, trapped in a house I’d never seen, her voice calling me Evangeline, hands dragging me into darkness. Sometimes I’d wake with bruises, faint marks on my arms, like someone had held me too tight.  

I tried to fight back. I stopped looking at reflective surfaces, taped paper over every mirror, kept my phone face-down. It didn’t matter. My reflection found me, in puddles, in other people’s glasses, in the shine of a doorknob. Once, I caught her in the window of a passing car, not just standing but walking, matching my steps, her head tilted like she was studying me. I ran home, locked the door, but my keys were gone the next day, replaced with that same strange key from the gifts, cold to the touch.  

Last week, I found a Polaroid in my mailbox. A woman who could’ve been my twin, same jaw, same hair, dressed in clothes from the 60s. On the back, in faded ink: “Evangeline, 1963.” My phone buzzed, a text from Collector_J: “She was sold too, Evangeline. Betrayed by her pictures. One last request. Check your closet.”
 
I didn’t want to, but my legs moved like they weren’t mine. I opened the closet, and there was a mirror I’d never seen, full-length, edges cracked. My reflection wasn’t me. It was her, Evangeline, smiling, her eyes boring into mine. She raised a hand, pressed it against the glass, and whispered my name, Jocelyn, like she owned me. The air turned thick, and I swear I smelled those lilies again, sharp and wrong. I stumbled back, but the mirror kept showing her, even when I turned away.  
I smashed it, broke it into a hundred pieces, but every shard still showed her face. My phone buzzed, a video from an unknown number. It was me, smashing the mirror, but from an angle inside the closet, like someone was right behind me. The text: “You’re hers now, Evangeline.”  

He never sent the video he promised, the one of her. I don’t know who Collector_J is, or why he’s doing this. I don’t know why my eyes are starting to look like hers, why my hands shake when I catch my reflection. I found out Evangeline was real, a woman from the 60s who vanished after posing for private photos, her life chewed up by men who thought they owned her. The requests, the money, they were traps, tying me to her, like I’m reliving her betrayal through OnlyFans. I’ve moved again, but the gifts keep coming, the mirrors keep cracking, and last night, I found that scarf draped over my chair, the red marks back on my neck. I’m posting this from a library computer because my phone’s not safe, my apartment’s not safe, I’m not safe. If you know anything about a woman named Evangeline from 1963, please tell me. I need to know what I’m becoming.  

I’m not just Joce now. She’s taking over, and I’m terrified she’s already won.",16,1744942818.0,nosleep,3,0.75,False

So, there I was, scrolling through rabbit holes of stress-reduction tips on a late Tuesday night (we've all been there, right?), when I stumbled upon a science-backed breathing technique. The promise? *Instant calm and focus*. Yeah, right, I thought. But hey, I'm a sucker for anything that doesn’t require a 5 a.m. wake-up call or an hour-long yoga session.

And here we are. I gave it a whirl every morning for a week. Here’s how it went:

- **What is it?**
  - Imagine this: just 2 minutes of simple, focused breathing. The technique is called **box breathing**, and it’s used by Navy SEALs (if it can calm them down, surely it'll work for us, mere mortals?).
  - **How it works:** Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold the breath out for 4. *Rinse and repeat.*

- **Day 1:** Honestly, I felt a bit silly and borderline skeptical. But the constant mental checklist and ‘did-I-feed-the-cat?' worries seemed slightly quieter. 😬

- **Day 3:** Definitely noticed less morning grogginess. Like that mental fog was lifted just a tad. Hello, productivity!

- **Day 5:** I started feeling...calmer. Like, genuinely less like a pinball bouncing against all sides of my To-Do list. Who knew slowing down could make time feel more manageable?

- **How does this work?** 
  - A quick dive into the science: **Cortisol**, the 'stress hormone’, drops when your body gets these clear signals to chill. Plus, this technique helps increase clarity and focus. 🤓 Makes sense, right? We breathe all day but rarely focus on making each breath count.

- **So, is it magic?**  
  - Not exactly. But it *is* surprisingly powerful. This tiny practice reminded me of how my body holds onto stress and how a few mindful moments can change the day’s trajectory.

Now it’s your turn, *MaximizeMe* warriors. Have you tried this or similar hacks that seemed too simple to be effective? How do you fit mindfulness into your chaotic routine? Let’s swap stories and tips! 🍃",1,1744942639.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I got to know this one guy from the library and we started to hang out a lot (almost everyday). I told him a lot about my past struggles (like family issues, bullying in school etc) and he was a good listener.

He eventually brought me to his church and I met some nice people there. Over time, I got to learn his behaviour even more and I realized he wasn't so nice. His brother tried telling me how good Donald J Trump is and how I should see what he's actually doing for the people etc. Turns out the guy I met from the library is also a trump supporter and was subtly trying to make me become a DJT supporter as well (saying all kinds of things about him and how the media just likes to make him look bad).

I made it clear I wasn't a supporter of his and when asked why is it because your dad is a democrat I said ""yes, partly but not entirely"" and he asked me to give him a percentage of how much influence my dad has over me and I said I wasn't going to quantify that. This turned into an argument the next day when I said I didn't appreciate how he boxed me into the convo about politics and made assumptions and asked for an apology.

Not only did he refuse the apology, failed to take accountability for it by projecting onto me. He said we should meet in person to discuss this because he doesn't like texting. We met up and I bought him a Starbucks coffee and we sat on a sofa. I got belittled, told I'm trying to bring him down to my level by asking for an apology, have no confidence and low self-esteem etc. He even said the stuff I was saying is what the devil says and said he wants to pray with me to which I refused. He told me to get up and hug him to which I refused but I extended my hand (prior to this he said he wanted to say a prayer with me and I said this wasn't about religion and if he wanted to pray to do it in his own time). He mentioned over text how the friendship was over prior to the meeting. Few days go by and his brother deletes me off social media out of the blue.

I stopped seeing him and his friends along with the church people. But now I'm certain he's been ruining my rep behind my back and when he sees me he always tries to give me a fist bump saying ""what's up bro"". I always reciprocate because I dont want to show weakness since he knows about my bullying past.

Last time I texted him was late January and I basically just keep telling his friend im busy when his friend asks me to ""let me know when you're at school and we'll chop it up :) "". AITA ?",1,1744942465.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False
