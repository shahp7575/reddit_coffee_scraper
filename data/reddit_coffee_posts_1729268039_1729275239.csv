Those tea, coffee & to do lists aren't doing the best for me. So should i get a study buddy who can accompany & accountable me... It's not a body double but it's more than that like who can literally poke me for studying & in return i can do the vice versa for them too. Is it worth asking someone? As I'm not sure will even this make me study effectively.. But finding someone for this is hard too as I've no such person in real life, I've my lil sister but i don't think i will obey her, who i will obey i don't know....",1,1729275185.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

You can go through my previous posts so that you can get some insight on what I am going through and you are free to judge me. 

I accept that my thoughts post marriage is wrong. I realised that I need help and seeked psychiatric support and also thought someone may have faced similar thing so reached Reddit to get some advice and to vent.

Now coming to the point,   I genuinely wanted to show some love to my husband and make him happy. I dont want my depression to impact my husband. there are few genuine soul out here who tried to help and give some valuable advice. Thanks to all of them. I also got few abusive comments which is expected.

But then here came a guy : https://www.reddit.com/u/DudeWhereIsMyCoffee/s/K3f9YHX2BE

Here is thread (his comments) 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/s/qiKr5HUIYr

For sure his intention is to humiliate me. But guess what unexpectedly I felt safe and happy for choosing right person as my husband. 
Obviously his question on comment is valid. My husband doesn‚Äôt have the need to support me and stand with me now. We just know each other for a very short time. In the world where there are men like that guy who chose to humiliate someone without even knowing the thinking. Here is my husband who chose to stand by side. 
Thanks to https://www.reddit.com/u/DudeWhereIsMyCoffee/s/K3f9YHX2BE for contributing to make me understand god gave a good person to me. ",1,1729275059.0,InsideIndianMarriage,0,1.0,False

Maine and VT are also possible to travel. ,"Did anyone ever go to Kings Grant Inn for holiday buffet, brunch, festivities? I went when I(43m) was a kid. It had a gingerbread house display, fireplace where you could hang out, warm apple cider and coffee everywhere, Santa in some tropical pool area with parrots. It was amazing as a child! The food was pretty good for buffet food and carolers would come by the tables. It was very festive for the season. Is there anywhere else that does anything like this? I would love to bring my kids.

# Public Transport

Majority of the people own vehicles so public transportation network is not the best but it is still workable. You can use Auto‚Äôs or CTU Buses to get around \[Chandigarh Transport Undertaking\].

There are two ISBT‚Äôs: Sector 43 & Sector 17. \[[Official Website](https://www.chdctu.gov.in/)\]

Google Maps are usually accurate for buses. Tricity Bus App makes it all much easier. \[[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ctulivetrack&hl=en_IN)\] \[[Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/trycitybus/id1527553948)\]

Uber/Ola/Rapido work great in the city, you don‚Äôt need to wait a whole lot and are easily available. Strongly recommended to stay away from InDrive, drivers are often rude, cars aren‚Äôt maintained at all and customer care is non-existent.

All of these libraries are crowded so if you want to save a spot for yourself, get their early. That‚Äôs one of the drawbacks but these are excellent spaces to study at. You would require a membership to use their services, the second one costs somewhere around 1000/- Rs.

**IMPORTANT**: Chandigarh influencers and pages dedicated to Chandigarh on Instagram or anywhere online do paid promotions 90% of the times.

1g6onw9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g6onw9,"Fruit Universe at Mirazur (***üçÄ) - Menton, FR - October 2024 ","After our visit at Disfrutar in August, we were hungry for another fine dining adventure, and no better occasion than both mine and my girlfriend‚Äôs birthdays being 2 weeks apart. Cue, Mirazur. We were interested by their lunar cycle menu, which changes daily depending on the current cycle of the moon. The menu is presented in 4 universes - Fruit, Leaves, Roots and Flowers, each focusing on a different type of ingredients used in the dishes.

We had the Fruit Universe, consisting of 9 courses at 450 Euro, and I had their Terroir pairing at 190 Euro, focusing on local French wines. My girlfriend had the Historique wine pairing, focusing on natural wines from around the world, at 140 Euro. In total, the experience cost us 1248 EUR for two.

The view from the restaurant table is of a sunset over the lovely Menton. We are welcomed warmly and sat at our table, where a basket of fruit is waiting for us. Not long after, they confirm my girlfriend‚Äôs long list of food preferences, and serve us our food. 

Slide 4 - We start off with amuse bouches, we are presented with a white grape tartlet with veal tartare, lobster tartare ‚Äòtaco‚Äô , among other bites, and the one pictured - cheesy ravioli. It was a very nice warm bite to start off.

Slide 5 - the first actual course in the tasting menu, listed as ‚ÄòWalnut, Squid‚Äô - calamari, razor clams and walnuts in three preparations - walnut oil, walniut milk, and the whole walnut fruit. It was a nice light cold dish to start the experience with, very flavourful, tasting like the sea, but also the crunch of the walnut fruit, combined with the richness of the milk delivered a really well-rounded dish.

Slide 6 - the poem from Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, we are served bread as per Chef Colagreco‚Äôs grandmother‚Äôs recipe, with olive oil with pink pepper and lemon from Menton. The bread wasn‚Äôt really soft and felt quite stiff (not pictured), but the olive oil was lovely. 

Slide 7 - Amanila Tart, mushroom carpaccio on the top, with the inside being mushrooms, cooked with butter, chives and shallots. An outstanding dish, a textbook lesson in umami, very fresh, very inspired. I love it.

Slide 8 - One of two courses I actually forgot to photograph (the wine pairings were 8 glasses for god‚Äôs sake, you can imagine how schlossed I was when I left), but thankfully my girlfriend had snapped a picture of it. Funnily enough, also one of my favourite courses of the night. Squash carpaccio, burnt with a flame on top, with tuna tartare underneath, squash puree and squash juice, and mustard ice cream. What a combination of flavours and textures. The tuna was very, very fresh, the preparations of squash tasted sweet, while the mustard ice cream gave a kick to the whole experience. Wowing dish, indeed.

Slide 9 - one of my favourite wines from the wine pairing, Valentin Zusslin Ophrys 2022 - a 2/3 Pinot Noir and 1/3 Pinot Gris. It had this very feint red colour, and tasted a lot, and I mean a lot, like strawberries, raspberries, red fruit. It was gorgeous and combined so well with my favourite dish from this experience, which is:

Slide 10 - Chestnut gnocchi, with chicken jus, chestnut carpaccio on top and sweetbread underneath. This has to be one of my favourite dishes I‚Äôve ever tried, with one of the best wine pairings. Served at the perfect warm temperature, the flavours of the sweetbread and chestnut gnocchi mesh so well together. They create this nostalgic, almost Christmassy flavour, reminiscent of very cozy and warm times. Premium ingredients, combined perfectly. Cannot praise this enough, and the sommelier‚Äôs pairing is just genius. Love my experience so far, despite being ill with the flu.

Slide 11 - second serving of the bread, this one is well crunchy and soft, served with local butter from Menton. 

Slide 12 - our 5th course, mushroom stew (blood mushroom, porcini mushrooms and other local mushrooms), cooked with veal sweetbread. Another strong course, the bread was served perfectly so that I could soak in that beautiful stew juice. The kitchen is putting out banger after banger.

Slide 13 - the basket with the mushrooms. Now granted, at this point in time, the table next to us was seated 30 minutes after us and caught up to us and even got their 5th courses before us . We had a 25-30 minute wait between the chestnut gnocchi and this. And they forgot to bring the basket of mushrooms around while serving the dish, so they brought it out after. We even finished our wine pairing with the course before we even the course itself. The sommelier was really nice and gave us a cheeky top up as a nice gesture, but we have been noticing water glasses being empty for a while, having to ask for water once or twice throughout the meal, ice not being replenished, little details that are being overlooked or omitted. I can cut them slack, but this on top of giving the wrong cutlery once, the take-home menus for my girlfriend not including her subs, the wine pairing on the take home menus being wrong, you can‚Äôt help but notice multiple small details being overlooked. At this level and calibre of cooking, you‚Äôd expect the service to be on par, but unfortunately, we felt a bit underwhelmed by that. That being said, the sommelier team is amazing and brilliant and their pairings are phenomenal.

Slide 14- catch of the day and coffee (Pike with coffee and lemon crepes on top, coffee infusion sauce) - a brilliant course that I also forgot to take a picture of, so using my girlfriend‚Äôs. It was really beautifully presented with the coffee and lemon crepes alternating, and the flavour combinations being brilliant. The nutty, deep coffee sauce really worked well with the fish, and the lemon crepes added acidity and variety to the flavour profile of the dish. Really well executed. A masterclass in flavours.

Slide 15 - Red Fruit and beef - beetroot with black fruit and red fruit, beef and cream from pure milk from Menton. Tart, acidic, rich, combining well with the umami of the beef. Another phenomenal course, and thankfully our last main, as we are getting stuffed.

Slide 16 - the first dessert - persimmon with chantilly with rosemary and armagnac from 1976, the chef‚Äôs birth year, and walnuts from the garden. My first time trying persimmon, the armagnac cream was simply sublime. Such a great combo together, the persimmon was soft and sweet and served at room temperature, while the armagnac cream gave it a lot of depth and the walnut fruit added the crunch. 

Slide 17 - the wine paired with the previous and following dessert. A 2016 red sparkling wine from Clos de la Bierle, made from Gamay grapes. tasting very fruity, light, kind of like lychee. I loved the pairing here again.

Slide 18 - spelt and ricotta rice pudding, with hay and pastry. Rich, malty, slightly sweet, nutty flavours. Brilliant dessert.


Slide 19 - for our celebration, they served us a squash tiramisu to share. Tiramisu is my favourite dessert ever, so I really, really enjoyed this one. A perfect tiramisu, with squash undertones.

Slide 20 - our petit fours, green apple sorbet, lemon pate de fruit, white chocolate and hazelnut fake peanuts, financier cake, chocolate tartlet. All very good, but my favourite by far was the fake peanuts, the combination of the white chocolate and hazelnut spread fake peanuts was fantastic.

All in all, an amazing meal, sadly let down by patchy service throughout. The sommelier team has done brilliant pairings, the hosts took great care of us, and even booked us a taxi for our way back. Small oversights in detail accumulated and left us feeling a bit iffy about the service at the table, but the food was out of this world. One of the very, very best, and I see why it was the world‚Äôs best in 2019. I can definitely recommend Mirazur, if you are in Cote D‚ÄôAzur. The universe concept was executed well, although due to seasonality they re-used squash, using mushrooms and coffee as ‚Äúfruit‚Äù definitely feels weird, and so does ‚Äúwalnut‚Äù. That being said, the fruit concept worked. Definitely an experience and I would happily go back to taste their other ‚Äúuniverses‚Äù. ",3,1729274884.0,finedining,0,1.0,False

Ps: is there a myth to not brushing close to meals? I try to avoid eating 30 min before or after so I think that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt do a mid day brush (that and being busy with work). Are there supplements or anything deficient that can contribute to teeth health?

1g6okm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1g6okm0/questions_post_ercp/,Questions post ERCP,"35 f (afab), weight 416, height 5'9"" ish. Known for anxiety/depression (well managed), hashimotos, Gerd, and recently in the past few years, ulcers. Arthritis in both knees, lower back, mild disk herniation in lower back. In the past year diagnosed with gallsludge. Managed with diet changes. Surgery for stomach sleeve and gallbladder removal December 3rd. Had endoscopy to check for any stomach scarring/ulcers last Fall, nothing to report.

Taking celexa, synthroid, pantalock, vitamin D, and a few supplements. Tylenol arthritis/extra strength tylenol for arthritis pain (gp has informed me on safe dose for a day). 

I have a gp. 

The background info:
Saturday night about 30 minutes after supper (bagels, cream cheese, lox, cheese blintez- due to the higher fat content and even with choosing lower fat options/exercising portion control, I had relatively zero fat in my meals leading up to this) I had abdominal pain that went from 0 to 100 almost immediately. Fianc√© took me home immediately, I followed the gallbladder pain protocol the surgeon in the er told me to follow a year ago when diagnosed (2 extra strength tylenol, naproxen, and 1 mg dilaudid) but I added a second dilaudid because usually I require 2 to control pain. While waiting the 30-40 minutes for it to kick in, I could not lie down or sit. I just did not know what to do with myself because of the pain. I just paced the house. When it kicked in almost all the pain was resolved except for the odd bit of left side chest pain. 

The next day, I had a plain bagel and coffee for breakfast. About 3 hours later, the pain started again. I took my pain protocol again. Got rid of it, but I noticed my abdomen around my diaphragm was tender. Also to note, pain was just slightly left of center. For lunch I had homemade chicken soup. Like on Saturday, pain came on very fast, except I was still in the window of the 2mg dilaudid. Pain was in upper abdomin, back, chest regions. At this point I got super nervous, and began to worry it was my pancreas. Went to er. While waiting an absurd amount of time to be seen, I couldnt take the pain any longer and took a 3rd dilaudid. Was finally seen, doctors were amazed I was still walking with 3 dilaudid, did a bedside ultrasound, ran labs, and did an abdominal CT with gastrograftin (I think that's what it was called). It was here, when i was fasting and drank this stuff, that i realized even liquids sparked an increase in pain. I also realized I was slighly nauseous, which i thought was a side effect from the drink, but looking back, it wasnt completely. After all the tests, everything looked clear. They sent me home saying it was a gallbladder attack.

Monday I was having constant pain/tenderness, but managed with my pain protocol. Ate very carefully low fat.
Tuesday I had an appointment with my gp originally for knee pain, but I brought this up. She thought it could be gastritis. Made recommendations to cut out all tylenols, naproxens, take pantaloc twice a day, take an h. Pylori breath test, and she adjusted my medications, adding the longer lasting dilaudid (3mg) and take half of 1 regular dilaudid at a time should this not be enough.

I took my first long dilaudid Tuesday night about 30 mins before eating a low fat supper. Woke up around 1 am with pain. I took a half dilaudid. It did nothing. Took the other half. Did nothing. At this point, I returned to the er. When the doctor examined me we both found out my right abdomen under diaphragm was insanely tender while on 4 mg dilaudid. Was still experiencing intense pain at this point, as well. Ran more bloods and tests, they find a few gallstones. 1 is stuck in the... biliary duct? And the duct is dilated. After another day waiting in the er with good pain management, I'm brought up for the ERCP. Procedure goes very well. I can attach a copy of the report if needed. They crushed a few stones, and had to perform a sphincterotomy. 

I remained overnight, had mild discomfort and nausea overnight managed by tylenol and gravol. My urine in the er was super dark, and I had no urge to drink, so I made sure I was attached to a bag to ensure I didn't get too dehydrated. This morning my concern turned to constipation due to all the pain meds and no bms since Sunday afternoon. After eating solid food for the first time in 24 hours, within an hour I had a bm. Softer than normal, and slightly yellow. Informed the nurse, we rejoiced. Maybe an hour after I had diarrhea  so bad it was just yellow water. She didn't seem concerned. When I mentioned this to the doctor later he wasn't concerned either. 

I've been discharges from the hospital for a few hours now, and I'm still experiencing discomfort and some mild nausea. Slightly bloated, no real urge to drink anything (and prior to this I drank water very regularly). Nurse told me to return to the er if the intense pain comes back. I took 2 extra strength tylenols and it is helping the discomfort.

Is this normal for what I have gone through? How long is this discomfort to continue? What can I do about the water diarrhea? I was thinking fiber supplements I have. Could the yellow color potentially be from the backlog of bile the stone stopped from draining?

1g6ok3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1g6ok3k/27_f_adnominal_issues_right_side_gerd/,"27/ F adnominal issues, right side, GERD? ","Hello, to start off my symptoms have been going on since June 2024 and have gotten worse over time today, October 2024. 

My first visit for discomfort was with my ENT end of June, 2 months prior (april) I had a tonsillectomy, I was experiencing a weird sensation on the right side of my neck/throat and I genuinely thought my tonsil on my ride side was scarring bad or growing back. She told my it was called globus potentially from acid reflux(no regurgitation )She recommended I change my diet and see if it helps.

Mind you, I've never dealt with acid reflux my 27 years of living. 

I keep going on and about and suddenly I started getting facial cramps/ facial pressure, eye pain, on my right side of my face and it would feel swollen, along with this I'd have a dull feeling in my adomnen but nothing painful. I went to urgent care and they told me I have TMJ. Which is essentially jaw issues from teeth grinding etc. No tests were ran. I visited my dentist because I take anything around my face or head as a serious matter. He told me it could be TMJ but he checked my bite width and it had no change since our previous visit, typically your bite size is smaller. I told them it must be a crazy coincidence that I'm dealing with TMJ and acid reflux? Just my luck.

Awhile goes on and I'm dealing with both off and on, my throat constantly, never seems to go away right side ONLY, facial cramps here & there and weird feeling of pressure in my sternum area. 

Along with this I would get ""nerve pain"" all over my body, felt like my body was inflammed and my skin was burning/stinging. SO BAD. 
 Sometimes my hands would tingle, my face right side would tingle, sinus area would feel strange, burning, flaring, throat would feel swollen, feet and legs tingling. 

Time passed and I wasn't sure what was going on with the constant burning, I'd wake up and feel like I was in the sun all night though my skin didn't look sunburnt, sometimes had a very light tint of pink to my skin, it felt like it was on fire or super sunburnt.
 All of July I fought this feeling out.
In August I was getting really sharp pain on my right side below my ribs, it would knock the wind out of me and I was scared because I thought maybe a lung collapsed or something ?? Because I had right side abdominal pain the urgent care I visited did a ultrasound on my gallbladder, my liver and pancreas, The doctor I saw pushed on that area and I told her that's where I was experiencing pain. She told me that no gallstones were found so she's not sure what the pain could be from. She said everything I am explaining is saying it's my gallbladder but I have no gallstones. I left with nothing except feeling crazy. Was told it's probably anxiety. 

Most recently I have had bad experience with indigestion and chest burning and pain. It feels like anything I eat or drink is getting stuck in my chest. I have lost some weight because I have reconsider what I chose to eat knowing I'll be in discomfort for the next hours. 
I visited my doctor and told her everything, she put me on omeprazole for 8 weeks and my first two days I threw up anything I tried to ingest, the thought of food made me sick to my stomach. I went back into urgent care and they tried to put me on protonix and I broke out in a rash by my thighs and on my stomach my first day taking it, so I went back to omeprazole. 

At my 5th week, my Symptoms got worse. I went back in and my doctor told me it takes 8 full weeks to not experience symptoms which I think is total BS. She gave me a referral to neurology, prescribed me Gabapentin LMFAO... and told me she wants to test me for H pylori stool test. Another two weeks went on and I feel so weak and fatigue not able to eat anything, pain all the time along with discomfort EVERYDAY. I felt this expending doom take over and I feel like this is fucking up my mental health. I spoke with another doctor of internal medicine and he said I HAVE TO STOP THE OMEPRAZOLE FOR TWO WEEKS THEN DO MY STOOL STAMPLE OR ELSE IT WILL READ NEGATIVE????? My GP never mentioned I stop taking anything, not once?
At this point im confused, I'm crying and begging to just be Referred to see a specialist that deals with ""acid reflux"" pleaseee, he said I have to do the stool test first, then take omeprazole for another 6-8 weeks twice a day, THEN They will refer me to a Gastro doctor if I'm not better. This is such bullshit!!!! I'm barely eating and I feel like shit everyday and they expect me to live like this and go to work! I'm livid. I've tried being patient.

 Before this I was in an out of the emergency room with extreme shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing, told them about my facial cramping, nerve pain, everything. I was embarrassed but I would go in when I was really scared and sick. I felt as if they viewed me as a freuqent flyer They ran no tests except blood work and told continued to tell my they treat life or death in the ER. They asked if I'm ""overthinking something and if I think I have cancer or if it could be anxiety"". I literally laughed bc of the gaslighting. My blood pressure usually sits at 110/and my er vitals would be 158 which seemed abnormal for me. I would be in a lot of pain or discomfort. 
I ended up getting super sick shortly after and took a visit the hospital. My right side below my ribs hurt, I was in extreme pain, I was having a spasm like sensation which lasted for 8 hours+ and I ate nothing except for coffee and a banana.
 A very strange symptom I had was when I would apply pressure on my right leg or stand with  all my weight or sit on my right side it felt like oxygen was getting cut off or a nerve was being pinched and I was getting super lightheaded. It also felt like it was hard to breathe, but I swear it felt like a nerve was pinched off or I was lacking oxygen to my head. I finally sat down with the doctor and asked them to run additional testing because I know my body and something is wrong. She took a look at the ultrasounds I got done in August and told me the doctor missed something bc it wasn't mentioned to me that I have Comet-tail artifact associated with adenomyomatosis. She didn't care about my nerve or the lightheadness sensation and blew me off and had me talk to a surgeon, because I didn't have an infection they weren't going to remove it that day. I do have to see a surgeon this up coming week in October. She said she is for certain all of the things I'm experiencing is because of my gallbladder. My question is why so suddenly? Why is my gallbladder the last of my big symptoms? What about my throat sensation? Beig lightheaded? My gallbladder pain isn't always happening and I still have other symptoms. I am also confused because I  my report said ""No gallstones visualized. The gallbladder wall appears normal and
measures 2.45 mm."" I tried to look into and got no answers. I saw that most of the time it can cause issues when there's thickening of the gallbladder walls but they reported my gallbladder walls are normal. I'm lost and stressed and tired. Mentally, and physically at my limit. 

I'm sorry for the long post thank you to anyone who took the time to read it. I am in hopes that someone out there is also dealing with something similar. If anyone has any suggestions or similar stories, please feel free to share them. 

I have also had tons of bloodwork done if there's any questions about that, I can share it also.

Symptoms: 
Chest burning, indegestion sensation of food being stuck in my chest, burping after water or eating, bloated, feeling like I am gassy but can't pass gas, was having diarrhea 2-3 times a day and now constipated, right side spasms, shortness of breath sometimes thought it was an asthma attack, right side of my body doesn't seem to be functioning as well, left side of fine, throat issues right side GLOBUS, difficulty swallowing at times, swelling of the face right side, sinus issues such flaring burning, the feeling of needing to go poop but not being able to, current extreme anxiety, feeling of doom and never ending, fatigue, lightheaded, headaches.

maybe some other symptoms I'm forgetting but just ask!

Every conversation was a pleasure and sometimes we were coming earlier to our shifts to drink coffee and chat when there was noone at work.   
This was happening for a few months and also when i make a compliment to her she was laughing and smiling and saying this is good.  
When our boss when on vacation she was even more talktive and spent sometime in my office and it was honestly the best time and she told me that as well. But when he came back after 1 month she became distant and wasnt interacting so much with me , not starting conversation or anything. And usually she used to text me , but she stopped doing that as well.   
The weird thing is that she started communicating a lot with my boss and chat a lot with him, which make me a little jelaous. If i dont start a conversation she would not start one,  but when i start we talk a lot like before. Anyway since i started having this jelaous periods i started to be distant , she comes at work and say 'hi' i dont say hi back or i just pretend she is not there throughout the day. She told me she dont have time to talk to me because she have a lot to do at work (which is correct), but she do have a lot of time to chat with the boss. One day i tried talking with her and she told me ""i am so sorry i dont have time right now"", which is fine, but then she text on the phone for 10 minutes giggling at the phone . When i approached my boss i saw that she was texting him on the phone (no idea if it was work related or not), but he tried to hide it and panicked a little bit.  
When jokingly asking her ""oo i see you chat a lot with him and he was acting weird"" she laughed and say its not true.  
Before it wasnt a problem if she leaves the phone on the table where i sit, but now she takes it every time. She used to charge it on my desk sometimes, but now she rather have no battery than to leave it on my desk.  
I might have started to have feeling for her and i act jelaous or i dont want to talk to her, she leaves it like that until i say come to say sorry that i was acting like this and that i give her too much stress.  
She is very important for me and i decided it would be better if i just quit so i dont make it more weird. When i told her i am quitting her eyes watered and i could see she was very sad. Later the day we talked on the phone (she called me) and i could hear she was crying for a moment and was asking me why i would do that. So we talked and in the end it went very well. When i go to work the next day she does not try to start a conversation again, but that was fine . Sadly when i was passing by i saw she was texting with the boss again and was giggling, but when our shift ended she told me she was having very bad day and she was very sad, because i was thinking to quit.

Hi, I'm turning 30 soon and I decided to give myself a gift - a week of vacation. I love nature very much and I live near the mountains, so I want to relax among nature and the forest. 

I can describe myself as a very aggressive introvert, if you don't bother me, then I won't bother you. Some would say I have anger issues, others say I wear rose-colored glasses and hide from the world. These are interesting observations and I generally really like to learn about myself  from others. 
 
If we talk about my personality and hobbies, then I hate gossips, pop culture with all obsession with celebrities and trends, love nature more than clubs, cafes more than restaurants, coffee and tea more than alcohol, 10 km walks more than cigarettes, cats more than dogs, and cold more than heat. In my free time I watch horror movies, iceberg videos on YouTube, listen to podcasts (if you know about Acephale, Wrong station, Knifepoint horror, dark somnium, then we will definitely be friends), rock/metal music and no, I can't name 3 least known songs and band members names because I just don't care, I wanna know music and not person or their dating life, sorry.

I‚Äôm also 178 cm and have never had any complexes about my height, but my face expressions are different topic. 3 tattoos, sun in Scorpio, moon in Pieces, intp, I don't know what else to say.",2,1729274386.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

First off I am very new to TRT injections as I started beginning of September. I initially began with SUBQ but recently changed this week to IM injections. 

My first shot this past Monday went well with no issue. 

However my follow up shot on Thursday was different. 

I took it late unfortunately but went to workout (3 hours later) and started to feel very faint, heart beating like crazy and extremely tired. 

I did have coffee and a Celsius that day but never had this kind of reaction. 

Could this be a side effect of the IM TRT injection? (When using subq. I experienced no issues.)

I am currently using 120mg over two shots (60 x 2)

But my car started smoking pretty bad from the exhaust pipes,  white smoke. Lasted about 30 seconds after turning on. I know very little about cars but I thought I remember my dad saying white smoke could be oil. Checked the oil. The dipstick was covered in oil, I cleaned it off then put it in and removed right away.  There was only a little oil on the indents of the stick. Then I cleaned again and put it in and let it set for a minute then had about 2 inches of oil on the stick. Added oil because, of course,  I was at work and not close to home. But there was coffee ground like sludge(?) on the oil cap. Took it for oil change today but it's now shaking and smoking again.

I'm 3 weeks caffeine free and my doctor wants to put me on sleep medication.,"Context: My doctor recommended going off coffee (I'm anemic. It's mild but persistent and I hate taking iron). I'm three weeks coffee-free and for the first time in my life I have trouble sleeping. 

Before: 3 - 6 cups daily. Absolutely no issues with anxiety or jitteriness (if anything I feel calmer after coffee), or sleep. I fell asleep easily, and would sleep consistently 8 hours a night. 

Now: I have trouble falling asleep and only sleep 6 hours max before I'm wide awake. I feel a little sleep deprived. Not as much as I would expect after 3 weeks of not getting enough sleep but I'm more jittery and get cold super easily, which are typical when I'm sleep deprived, so I'm pretty I need more sleep.

I also have ADHD (not on meds currently) and my doctor freaked out at the change in my sleep and wants to put me on sleep medication because ""an ADHD brain needs sleep."" The idea of quitting caffeine making sleep *worse* is a foreign concept to him although I've seen some people talk about it here. I hate the idea of taking sleep medication and honestly would rather just drink coffee again and take more iron, but also realize three weeks isn't a super long time so maybe the sleep issues are temporary? Wanted to make a poll and see what other people's experiences are/were with sleep to gain some perspective. Thanks in advance!

Every year I celebrate right at midnight and set a resolution for the next year because it feels more meaningful to me than doing it on January 1. I still haven‚Äôt settled on ‚Äúthe one‚Äù but one of my front runners right now is to let myself be more comfortable taking up space, and that got me thinking about how being poly has already helped me with this quite a bit!!

A silly example: I spent 6 months drinking black coffee in the morning any time I slept over at my person‚Äôs place because I was too chicken shit to ask for sugar. One morning after he had slept at mine he saw me put sugar in my coffee and was like hey what the fuck?? Now any time I sleep over him and my meta(his NP) get out the sugar and caramel sauce for me because they know I probably won‚Äôt ask on my own(I have started asking and advocating for myself since they started doing this). It‚Äôs something so silly and small but a good reminder that people love me and WANT me to take up space!! I have a drawer in their bathroom full of contact lens solution and makeup remover and my morning meds because they WANT me there and want me to be comfortable and happy!! They have literally made a space for me to take up in their home and their lives and are waiting for me to inhabit it!!

I think getting to design my own relationship structure has made me a lot more aware of my needs and wants, and that‚Äôs given me a lot more confidence in asking for them. It also helps that I‚Äôm surrounded by AMAZING people who create space for me to take up in so many ways(one time while I was over my meta made TWO batches of potato salad from scratch because I‚Äôm allergic to one ingredient in the recipe and they wanted me to still be able to have some). 

Before starting this journey, and even after, I would have muted my own needs/wants in favor of ‚Äúkeeping the peace‚Äù or ‚Äúnot troubling anyone‚Äù. Being involved with multiple people who create space in their hearts and lives(and schedules!!) for me, I‚Äôm reminded every day that people love me and are CHOOSING me, and that the least I can do is take up the space they have given me and show up as my whole self.

Anyway, at the time we broke up he had met up with some girl he briefly dated 2 days before then he got distant with me so I think he cheated. He was also in a muddle over another long term relationship ending and still in angsty contact with that ex. So I think I was his rebound who nursed his ego back to health.

Fast forward 1.5 years later: he's bought a house and says he's in a great place. He casually floated the idea of coffee if I'm ever in the area, saying it's been ""unfathomably long since we've spoken"".

**What Is the L.o.G Curriculum?**  
The **L.o.G Curriculum** is a structured yet flexible daily practice designed for students of *ACIM* who are ready to integrate the Course‚Äôs principles into their everyday lives. It is a curriculum of self-honesty and conscious choice, where each interaction becomes part of a living classroom, and every encounter is an opportunity to teach and learn either *love* or *fear*.

**The Core Purpose**:  
In this curriculum, you become both the **teacher** and the **student**, recognizing that **what you teach is what you learn**. Each moment holds a lesson, and by reflecting on these moments, you start to shape your mind‚Äôs deeper patterns, moving from automatic reactions of fear to deliberate choices of love.

# Key Elements of the L.o.G Curriculum

1. **Daily Reflection in Real-World Interactions**:
   * Throughout the day, you engage with others‚Äîat home, at work, on the bus, in the coffee shop. Each of these interactions is a part of your spiritual curriculum, a chance to observe how you show up and what you teach yourself and others.
   * You‚Äôll capture your reflections in quick, simple journal entries, noting whether you aligned with *love* or *fear* and what you learned from each moment.
2. **Teaching as a Continuous Process**:
   * As *ACIM* teaches, **‚Äúto teach is to learn, and to learn is to teach.‚Äù** The L.o.G Curriculum emphasizes that this teaching isn‚Äôt confined to a classroom‚Äîit‚Äôs happening all the time, in every conversation and even in silence.
   * Each interaction becomes a lesson plan: you choose what you want to teach (and thus learn) in each moment‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs patience, understanding, defensiveness, or judgment. This awareness turns your life into a dynamic classroom of spiritual learning.
3. **Simple and Time-Efficient Reflection**:
   * Recognizing that life is busy, the L.o.G Curriculum is designed to be achievable with minimal time investment. Most of us have a limited number of daily interactions‚Äîperhaps 20-30 across a day with around 10-15 people.
   * The reflection process requires just **15-20 seconds per entry**, making it easy to jot down insights even in the middle of a busy schedule. By the end of the day, you‚Äôll have a series of small reflections that build toward a larger understanding of your own patterns.
4. **Choosing What to Learn**:
   * A key theme of the L.o.G Curriculum is conscious choice‚Äîdeciding what you want to teach yourself through your behavior. If you want to learn peace, you must teach it through your actions, even in challenging moments.
   * By writing down your insights at the end of each day, you become more intentional about the lessons you are reinforcing in yourself. You shift from passively reacting to life‚Äôs events to actively choosing the direction of your learning.

# How to Engage with the L.o.G Curriculum: The Daily Practice

Each day, you‚Äôll capture your learning through a series of quick journal entries, reflecting on the interactions that make up your day:

1. **Interaction Summary**: A short note about each encounter‚Äîwho you met, where it happened, and what stood out. This can be as brief as ‚ÄúTalked with Kim about the project‚Äù or ‚ÄúQuick chat with the bus driver.‚Äù
2. **Thought System**: Identify whether you were teaching from *love* or *fear* in that moment. Write **‚ÄúLove‚Äù** if you felt patient, open, and connected, or **‚ÄúFear‚Äù** if you felt defensive, rushed, or anxious.
3. **Key Insight**: A brief observation of what you learned about yourself or the interaction. This is where the lesson emerges‚Äîwhat the experience taught you about your patterns or beliefs.
4. **Intention for Next Time**: Write a short intention for how you want to handle similar situations in the future. This turns reflection into forward momentum, helping you shift your teaching and learning over time.

# Example of the L.o.G Curriculum in Action

Here‚Äôs a glimpse of a day in the L.o.G Curriculum, focusing on the theme of **timing**:

* **7:15 AM**: Bus stop. Driver didn‚Äôt return my greeting. Felt slight irritation. (Fear)
   * **Insight**: ‚ÄúI expected a response and felt ignored when I didn‚Äôt get one. My timing was rushed‚Äîwanted to feel acknowledged.‚Äù
   * **Intention**: ‚ÄúOffer kindness without expecting it back.‚Äù
* **9:00 AM**: Team meeting. Felt pressure to answer my boss quickly. (Fear)
   * **Insight**: ‚ÄúI spoke too soon, trying to defend myself. Timing matters‚ÄîI need to pause before speaking.‚Äù
   * **Intention**: ‚ÄúBreathe before I speak in meetings.‚Äù
* **12:15 PM**: Lunch at a caf√©, thanked the barista warmly. She paused and smiled back. (Love)
   * **Insight**: ‚ÄúTaking a moment to be genuinely kind shifted her mood and mine.‚Äù
   * **Intention**: ‚ÄúRemember the power of a small pause in my interactions.‚Äù
* **5:15 PM**: Crowded bus ride home. Felt tense as people jostled me. (Fear)
   * **Insight**: ‚ÄúMy first reaction was irritation, but I took a breath and let it pass. Timing again.‚Äù
   * **Intention**: ‚ÄúKeep practicing that pause before my reactions.‚Äù
* **10:00 PM**: Night Reflection
   * **Key Insight**: ‚ÄúToday, I saw how my sense of timing influences whether I react with love or fear. When I rush, I end up defensive and tense. When I slow down, I connect better. I realize that in each moment, I am teaching myself either to rush or to pause, and that shapes what I am learning about peace.‚Äù
   * **Choosing What to Learn**: ‚ÄúI want to learn that patience is more powerful than haste. Tomorrow, I‚Äôll be more mindful of how I use time, knowing that each pause is a lesson I‚Äôm teaching myself.‚Äù

# Why the L.o.G Curriculum Matters

The L.o.G Curriculum makes it possible for students of *A Course in Miracles* to bring its teachings into the practical reality of their lives. It‚Äôs about making **small, conscious choices** that add up to profound changes in perspective. By capturing these moments and focusing on the lessons we are teaching ourselves, we move from **automatic, fear-driven reactions** to **deliberate, love-centered responses**.

**This curriculum is for those who are ready to become true learners of God, who want to be more aware of what they are teaching and learning in each moment. It‚Äôs about turning everyday life into a classroom of spiritual growth, and it‚Äôs achievable for anyone, even in the busiest of lives.**

**Join the L.o.G Curriculum and let every interaction become a lesson that brings you closer to the peace and clarity you seek.**",1,1729273351.0,sheerawareness,0,1.0,False

1g6o0yi,https://www.reddit.com/r/SupportforWaywards/comments/1g6o0yi/tmts1_have_you_thought_about_why/,TMTS1: ‚ÄúHave you thought about why?‚Äù,"I think it is helpful for me to process therapy after the session. I‚Äôve found it helpful a couple times I‚Äôve shared here to the perspective of others because I often have screwed up thinking patterns. I also think it‚Äôs helpful for me to practice some level of vulnerability even if it‚Äôs pseudo vulnerability since this is all pretty much anonymous and frankly
I could still sugar coat and curate and none of you would know. But it‚Äôs helpful to me and sometimes people tell me it‚Äôs helpful to them so here we go. 

**Things My Therapist Says** 1: Have you thought about why?

Man I really don‚Äôt like this question. I find examining my motivations to be so difficult and often I‚Äôm left disappointed in myself. Probably non-wayward partners might look at a wayward admitting this and go ‚Äúduh!‚Äù But man I think there are few things I like less than looking in the mirror.

This week‚Äôs example was me talking about not really knowing what I want long term out of a relationship.  When I envision the future there is an absence of people. I don‚Äôt just mean like I don‚Äôt see my partner, I mean like I don‚Äôt see other humans at all. (Which will become weird as I elaborate).

I envision riding my bike along a bike path near a highway and the away is empty of cars. I‚Äôm riding my bike from my rustic mountain home to some bike shop or maybe woodworking studio ‚Äúin town‚Äù. At the shop or studio I repair things. For whom? That‚Äôs the odd part of a vision with no people‚Ä¶ whose stuff am I repairing.

I ride my bike home in the early afternoon and sit on my porch drinking a beer or G&T watching the day come to a close. I watch some TV (who is acting in shows if there are no people?) and then I go to bed.

The next morning I wake up and make a small French press of coffee, read a paper or magazine (who is writing if there are no people?) and I repeat my day.

I do not see myself with a partner in these visions. I don‚Äôt see myself with anyone.

To this my therapist really didn‚Äôt know what to say and said what if we take a different approach. They asked me have I thought about why people want partners in the first place?

No. Of course not. Which is probably strange given I pursued, dated, and married my BS‚Ä¶ and I never really thought about what the point was. I mean I guess I did think in some way that the purpose was to have two incomes - making things easier to afford; and to have children - making me a parent which I wanted to be from the time my father passed and I had to have all the surrogate dads.

But after those objectives? I am struggling to remember ever thinking deeper about the topic. 

I mean I only recently recognized that I didn‚Äôt count my BS in my list of friends. They were in this special category called ‚Äúspouse‚Äù and spouse and friend didn‚Äôt overlap. The idea that if I saw a funny meme that I would send it to my spouse instead of to a friend never crossed my mind. But equally the idea that I would share chores or finances or parenting strategy with a friend was also unheard of - that‚Äôs what I do with a spouse.

So now I‚Äôm home the next day and feeling pretty stupid and ashamed I never thought about this and how in the world would I explain to my BS I took almost 20 years of their life without thinking? And what am I supposed to say about the fact I don‚Äôt see humans in my future?

Am I just too scared to be hurt and left alone so I won‚Äôt let myself see a future with people? But I do like this future vision‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs filled with stuff I like and find fulfilling while also it avoids the part of life I find so hard: dealing with the expectations of other people around me.

Truly if you thinking about it, the replies here on reddit could all be done by different AIs and I‚Äôd really never even know if I‚Äôm connecting with real people‚Ä¶ and maybe that would be OK.

My therapist pointed one other thing out to me that I absolutely know I can‚Äôt bring up. The biggest part of my infidelity - the thing I kept chasing with partner after partner - was connection. The partners when it was simply sex fizzled quickly but the ones where I found something interesting about them were the ones I kept returning to‚Ä¶ so maybe I am seeking this connection? But again why do I never see one of them in the future if I really thought I was finding connection? I liked that they were throwaway. It was a lot of work to keep finding new people and hide my behavior but I also got to learn about someone new without having to deal with the part where they get boring and begin having expectations of me.

And I‚Äôm like why not give it a shot, we‚Äôve only got this semester together and it‚Äôs halfway through. We do talk occasionally, I‚Äôve got her number (study partner type stuff), and we‚Äôve gone to a coffee shop to study together and that was great and it felt like we clicked. However when we text it seems like she is interested at first and slowly loses interest as it goes on.

So I figure I‚Äôll give it a shot sooner or later before this semester is up, but what‚Äôs the best way to go about doing that? 

Im way out of my depth here, I‚Äôve never been in a relationship where I‚Äôve been the one to start talking first yknow?

Basically, how should I ask her out, or is that even a good idea?

*Maximillian and Rachnia had always wanted one of their own... Even if their family was large, and they treated their adoptive daughters as their own... They still wanted to some day... somehow... have a child of their own.*

*One they could raise from the very start...*

*But fate... was unusually cruel. Even with Maximillian's insane luck... Even with the blessings of gods... Genetics would not have it. Failure after failure... The two continued to try... Again... and again... negative results.*

*They knew they could ask for help... Nhak had offered... Jean had offered... but they were sure it'd work out eventually... At some point... but that, it did not...* 

*Matters only got worse once Max was no longer human... Draconic genes and Arachne genes do not mix well... Even if they were to succeed now... The child would have many health problems... something they did not wish upon their offspring, and so finally... they buckled.*

*They asked Jean and Nhak, who were both all too happy to help. It was not even a week later, when they were faced with their child's egg. One of merely five embryos, that were painstakingly made viable through the efforts of a master scientist and an arch-biomancer... The other four placed in stasis, in case they'd wish to have another child in the future.*

*They already had a name... They've had a name for over seven and a half centuries...* 

*Clarissa Silverweave.*

*And so... it was another wait...* 

*A wait that was anything but lengthy...* 

*But felt like an eternity.*

*Until... at the hatching of Jean's child... Clarissa too decided she wanted to see the world.*

*She wished to see the spotlight for the very first time...*

*And so... a tap... a thump... the purple glow of the egg starting to intensify... A crack... a thump, more cracks... before one thin, arachnid leg bursts out of the side of the egg. A few more thumps... more cracks... and the top and side of the egg crack apart. The curious golden eyes of a small child could be seen.*

*Arachne were known to hatch at a fairly late stage of their development... but this... was extreme.*

*Rachnia swiftly helps her get into a small dress, already somewhat small for their large daughter.*

 *""Mwornin, peoples.""*

https://preview.redd.it/e9j1460zkjvd1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4989b4dd5595000f4c4b09329b3a859bd45ec54

*She swiftly gets caught in a hug between her two overjoyed parents. Maximillian is... completely broken, weeping out of joy and relief. He had waited for this... for so long...* 

*Rachnia welcomes her to the land of the living... but as Rachnia tries to snap Max back to reality, him being stuck crying... Clarissa worms her way out of the hug, to move to the coffee table.*

*Her family is seated around... everyone is there... some had already greeted her... and so...*

""I'm Clarissa Silverweave! That's... all I really know about me... but nice to meet you!""

*And after uttering these... fairly simple words... she stood there, proudly, all four hands on her hips...*

*She then moved back to her two parents, overjoyed to see their child in a state like this... in good health... yet strangely old even for an Arachne... They were just happy she was alright... That they finally succeeded... and that their new member of the family was here.*

*But as the night went on... and Rachnia brought both her crybaby husband and her new daughter to bed... she worried. She asked Fortuna to keep a close eye on Clarissa...*

*And in the morning, they found out just how important that had been. Fortuna had asked her sisters as well... and gotten the information they needed.*

*As it turns out... she was on a cruel timer. Her parents both shared a divinity, meaning their child too would be of divine nature... and as Eastorea's divine system would have it... no Child could carry a god's path... so she would have to grow into an adult... and waiting patiently was not how that was going to happen.*

*Kaguya's words were of warning. She had until sunday to grow up into an adult. Her body and mind would age at a steady yet massively increased rate... but there was a way around it. It was dependent on the time in Eastorea, not on Zeroth... and so, using Jean's chronal dilator, they could extend these days to over a year... Preventing the agony such incredibly rapid growth would cause.*

*It was still short... but it was manageable. They could work with this... they could give her somewhat of a childhood... and what they couldn't give her, they'd have to make up for, later... but that... was a problem to solve when the time came.*

*.......................................................*

*The first day... Max had made sure to teach her things like socialisation, respect for the people around you... and made sure to teach her how to cook and bake. At the end of midday, he showed her how to sew alongside Rachnia, a skill that all Arachne have an instinct for, but should still be taught regardless.*

*Her silks turned out to be vastly different from Rachnia's. Almost like thin, flexible metal wires. She'd be a stellar surgeon with such a tool built-in, Max was sure of it... but that would come another day.*

*Next, was a lesson in creature caretaking. A skill that would teach her compassion for the world around her, and would let her help with many things in ARMADA if she wished to take that path... Her affinity with the slimes and griffons was staggering... Max couldn't help but be proud of his little girl...* 

*Then... at the end of that night... Her magical abilities would have sufficiently developed for her to be taught how to use them. The Silverweave family's mental magics... How to wield them, when to wield them, and the responsibility that came with magic... a lesson of utmost importance.*

*She was a true prodigy in all that she was taught. A genius, like her parents. Max is sure she will surpass him, sooner than later.*

*......................................................*

*The second day...* 

*Basic weapon training. Eastorea is a cruel place... and to leave his daughter defenseless was an insane thought to Max. She had already grown from around 1m tall, to 1.4m tall... it's going so fast... he scorns his homerealm... he hates the divinity that is speeding things up like this... but to think about all that while he has a daughter to raise, is not his definition of a good idea.*

*They finished up the training from the past few days. Max taught her how to hold tools and weapons without hurting herself in the process... Rachnia continued to teach her how to use her magic... Max showed her how to appraise relics... how to work with technology... and before long, she found a blueprint in Maximillian's office. She gathered the pieces she needed from his workshop, and got to work in the kitchen... making a small tonfa/flamethrower hybrid fueled by a fire crystal.*

*Max's pride for his little girl was overflowing.... Rachnia stood by as she watched it happen... Creating functional complicated machinery... Even if it was dangerous, she was proud just the same...*

*and by the end of that day... Jean came by to teach the three of them a skill. A method of seeing based on echolocation, paired with the Silverweave's natural tactic of a psychic web... as rough as it was on Clarissa, such an advanced technique, with such a loud training method...* 

*She wanted to be strong... she was told stories by big sis Sarah while cooking... She had heard tales from big sis Nagisa while they painted... though some of them were about big brother Talios as well, someone who had already praised her a bunch...*

*She toughed it out, working through the training until she got a hold of it. All she thought of was how Auntie Jean came over to teach her how to do something cool... and Dad looks up to Jean so much... So it has to be important to learn... something that'll help her follow in those cool adventurer footsteps...*

*And once they finished training... the three of them rested... before they packed their bags...* 

*.......................................................*

*The third day...*

*They headed to Eastorea. Max, Rach, Clarissa, Sarah, Aoi and Cerne together... a camping trip in the woods, to show how to survive in the wild, to scavenge and to seek adventure. It was plenty clear to Max this was what she wanted to do... and so who was he to say no.*

*His daughter had already grown quite a bit... she was almost done... by tomorrow, she'd stop growing entirely... it was sad... but he was proud of the woman she had become in such a short span of time... and just glad they could do what they had done.*

https://preview.redd.it/2singg1trjvd1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a2461a4a6896a84b0a5522a1819e126e081d94f

*First setting up the tents... the bonfire... the portable stoves... the perimeter defense... working with nearby animals to find food...*

*And then, finally, proper combat training.* 

*Clarissa was taught tricks by each of the five accompanying her... the ruthless speed of an Arachne... the power and precision of a Cyclops... the brutality of an Oni... the refined strikes of a Centaur.... and finally... the showmanship of her draconic father.*

*And so... as she stood there, two blazing tonfa, one attached to each of her two chitinous arms... and a rapier in both her human hands... she was able to make use of all four arms...*

*The meadow they fought in was a blaze, the noisy fire obscuring vision... but now with Jean's teaching... this did not matter... she drowned out the sound of the fire as she closed her eyes... and let the mana around her speak for itself...*

*Max teleported from place to place as he struck... but she managed to block every single strike...*

*Until finally, she felt an opportunity, and stabbed her rapiers forward... she opened her eyes, seeing both of the points hovering against his adam's apple, drawing a single drop of blood...*

*In such a short period of time, she had been able to train years worth of martial expertise, with the help of these titans in their fields...*

*And was able to defeat her father in a duel.*

*She tossed the two blades to the side, and hugged her dad.*

""I did it! I finally did it! Are you proud of me, dad?""

""Of course I am, sweetie... you've made your old man proud beyond measure...""

*......................................................*

*The fourth day...*

*Was a day to celebrate. No more chronal dilation... No more training... She had everything she needed to become her own self...*

*And so... they went to Araheim. The city where Max and Rach had lived so long ago... a city Max had restored to it's former glory, and beyond, using ARMADA's resources... now the capitol of ARMADA itself, holding it's HQ.*

*They met with many old friends, stopped by many spots they wanted their daughter to see... but as night fell... She heard something. There was word about a slavetrader in the city... some big wig... Something she picked up by invading into the surface thoughts of the people they walked past, much like her mother... who heard the same thing...*

*And so, their celebration turned into something different... an evaluation... She wished to join Division Zero, the Hunters of ARMADA, just like her two parents... and this was the perfect opportunity to test it.*

*This big wig was supposed to arrive at a night club at the edge of town in about two hours for a deal...*

*And so the six of them went to the club's back door, and made their way inside. Max, Rach and Clarissa each disguised themselves as bartenders, using mental magics to alter the perception of the other employees to simply accept their presence as a fact... same for Sarah, Aoi and Cerne, who disguised as bouncers...*

*As the first hour passed, Clarissa had swiftly learned how to mix drinks, and the theatrics involved... She was like a mimic to her father... no less a showman than he was... and then... two and a half hours later... the man of the hour entered the building... and it was go-time.*

*First, a false fire alarm, using both Aoi's magics and Clarissa's flamethrowers... as everyone inside rushed outside, Sarah tailed the men that Rachnia had marked as the trader's clients... and Clarissa tailed the trader himself...*

*As he made his way out of the city... she finally made herself known. An attempt to peacefully apprehend her... which ended horribly. Several gunshots came her way, but each of them was deflected, except for one... which she skewered onto her rapier... just to make a point.*

*The trader ran into the woods... this... this was perfect. They had all agreed that she'd chase the guy to the campsite... where the rest would be waiting for her... so, she did what she knew would work best by now... and made walls of flames as she jumped between the treetops. Her staggering arachnid speed made it an effortless endeavour to keep up with the slavetrader, as she steered him right into the trap...*

*And as he continued to run... and run... he finally rushes into the unmoving body of a very pissed off cyclops... and as she holds him up by his collar, he turns to see the thing that hunted him down...*

*The grin of a predator, that dragged it's prey into it's web... the scorching flames only accentuating her golden eyes...*

*A new hunter was placed on the roster... Clarissa Silverweave, Daughter of the Founder.*

Backstory from me- I‚Äôve been in 2 serious relationships over the past five years. This is my 2nd ‚ÄúFWB‚Äù arrangement, as the first one got too attached. I‚Äôm a romantic at heart but have been clear about what I want to both of these men. I want to have my fun and experience new things before I settle because I know with my heart, It won‚Äôt be too long. 

I work with my current FWB. We agreed to keep things casual and just have fun. We also both agreed we only like to sleep with one person at a time to keep things clean/ less complicated. He said himself he has commitment issues and I made it clear I‚Äôm not trying to fall for anyone right now. Yes, there‚Äôs a significant age gap, but I can‚Äôt help being attracted to it.

However, we‚Äôve started spending the night together every other day since he lives far away. Recently, he expressed that he wants me around all the time. One night, after a long day, we had plans for me to come over.. We know what that means.. except after getting there, he expressed he was really tired and I told him I was too and let‚Äôs try in the morning. Didn‚Äôt happen. No bad vibes, he was just happy I was there and didn‚Äôt hint anything about sex. 

He often brings me coffee in bed, makes breakfast, and buys me food whenever he can because I‚Äôm trying to gain weight. He even offered to not flirt with other woman if it would make me feel less attracted to him.. that‚Äôs a lot. It‚Äôs hard to ignore these signs and keep things strictly physical.

Phenome-wide association studies revealed consistent links with obesity and red blood cell traits, but other associations differed by cohort, suggesting that GWAS in different populations may reflect cultural influences on behavior and genetics.",1,1729272905.0,GenomelinkOfficial,0,1.0,False

I went inside one of the apartments to get something I'd left there. 

I remember trying to be quiet as to not wake my friend that lived there. 

But in my shuffle I managed to knock over like 10 acoustic guitars that were all on guitar stands next to each other. 

  
I struggled to put them all back but eventually was able to. 

I went outside and walked around a corner to a parking lot. 

There were two Uber drivers waiting to give me a ride and I was very confused. 

One was a man, and one was a woman. 

The man was also confused as to why there were 2 drivers here for 1 person. 

I decided to go with the woman and the man decided to ride along with us for some reason. 

I found the woman quite attractive so I was hoping to sit in the front with her. 

But the man was ahead of me and I remember thinking that he would for sure take the front seat but he actually didn't. He pretended to and then jumped into the back and let me sit in the front. 

  
The next think I remember was the woman driving us down a road with a lake on the right. 

She asked me ""how's it been living in that body"". 

I responded with something like ""It's been alright, but they run track so I'm not sure how that will go"". (Implying that the body I was in was an athlete but I myself IRL am not. Not out of shape but definitely haven't ran a marathon). 

Then I remember looking at the water to my right and thinking about how we may crash off the bridge coming up on the road. I looked at the handle on the car door to locate exactly where the lock was in case I needed to crawl out of a sinking vehicle. 

  
When I woke up there was some weird after effect where I mistook 2 different words for ""Vortex"". 

I saw some mail on the table when I was making coffee. It was one of those generic voting flyers. The word was ""Voters"" but I saw ""Vortex"". Then I went to play pokemon whilst drinking my coffee and mistook ""Pokedex"" for ""Vortex"". 

Not really sure what that's about. I would think dreaming about sinking in water and then seeing Vortex everywhere would be a bad thing but it didn't feel bad. It felt like something important but I don't quite understand it. ",2,1729272875.0,DreamInterpretation,0,1.0,False

I'm a 24(F) - I'm currently a government contractor and work retail on the weekends. I'm working 7 days a week - I'm extremely drained but I have goals. I'm a little less than $20k in credit card debt from various factors and about $25k for student loans (undergrad). I have never missed a payment on my CC - even if it is a minimum payment. As for student loans, I'm on that SAVE plan, so I haven't been paying into it. I've currently started this $10k (52-week saving method).

I‚Äôm 24, and the past couple of years have been humbling to put it very lightly. From about 19-23 all I did was work and got myself into a pretty nice position managing a restaurant and was making ~$75k. I was debt free, good credit and saved up lots of money, putting the rest in investments. Basically, I had my shit together. I bought a house a little over 2 years ago. My (now ex) boyfriend moved in and has always helped with 1/2 the mortgage and utilities. I got pregnant shortly after buying the house. My wonderful little boy is now 17 mos. After having him my life got pretty much turned upside down with all of my health issues. Basically, I need a new heart but won‚Äôt get into that here. I ended up quitting my job 4 months after having him to stay home. My ex encouraged this and told me he‚Äôd be able to handle all our bills. This never really happened. I went to trade school for a few months and invested LOTS of money into learning to shoe horses (which I do currently as my own business, but I am still not consistent with clientele/income). We recently split up, he‚Äôs still living here and has been paying me but I‚Äôm really worried things are going to go south more than they have already. Also, I don‚Äôt want him here I‚Äôm just poor.

1g6nthu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1g6nthu/petty_best_friend/,Petty Best Friend ,"Hello Petty Queen,

So my friend was petty and I could use some advice if possible. 

So I (F30) had a fight with my friend (F32), Kristy, because for her birthday we hung out at my house and she invited a friend who was extremely disrespectful (vaping in my house, arguing that it was fine because it‚Äôs weed not nicotine, fully dumped Doritos directly on my table, not using coasters, opening a brand new comforter, throwing wet stuff directly on my 100 year old wood floors, etc). I tried to ask Kristy to ask her friend not to vape in my house and she retorted that her friend isn‚Äôt a dog and she can‚Äôt just tell her what to do. Kristy also got high (edible) and was acting very entitled, throwing a pouting fit because I used the pillows I bought for myself. 

Now for the petty, well, I had a ‚Äúconfrontation‚Äù (friend claims to love confrontation), where I brought up everything and said that her friend was rude, if she doesn‚Äôt think a friend will respect my house rule then don‚Äôt bring them, and that if she feels entitled to my house then we need to have a conversation. She came back saying that I was harsh and I don‚Äôt use coasters at her house and don‚Äôt take off my shoes immediately. I took that feedback and the next time I went to her house, I stopped and put the food in my hand down and unzipped my boots (used to come in, sit down, and unzip them since I‚Äôm not coordinated lol) and asked for a coaster. She rolled her eyes and said you‚Äôre fine, I retorted that she used not using coasters in a fight, so I figured her house rules changed, but she said it was just ‚Äútit for tat‚Äù and the issue was I never asked. When I first came to her house 5+years ago, I asked for a coaster and she said we don‚Äôt do that here and when I looked concerned at her wooden coffee table, she rolled her eyes and said ‚Äúyou‚Äôll be fine‚Äù. 

All this seems like a bad use of petty, but I‚Äôm not sure how to deal with the petty. What should I do about this friend? She said she feels like I‚Äôm drifting away, but I feel like I‚Äôm being pushed. ",2,1729272724.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

1g6ntcx,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalMalpractice/comments/1g6ntcx/note_that_will_destroy_my_life/,Note that will destroy my life,"This is very long because I am not sure what details fully matter, nor how simple the issue is. The question without details is at the bottom, but I'm not sure if the value of my details changes the answer. I know many won't wish to read this. Regardless, hiding details or lying gets me no closer to a solution. Also, I know getting legal or medical advice on the internet is not the best of moves, but maybe general advice to help me because I am the father of 4 children and the actions of a NP have set my life on a really bad path. I take some blame, mainly out of ignorance and lack of financial ability, but I do fully believe that what was done to me a few weeks ago was uncalled for and, at the very least, negligent (to be honest, I believe it was purposeful due to my interaction with the NP in question, but I have no concrete evidence of such and it would be unfair for me to dispute evidence while simultaneously making claims without it, so I will stick only to facts). In short,  I am desperate, shocked and don't believe I have ever felt so violated by anyone before.

I am 40 years old, male, father of 4, married to a RN and both of us work full-time to make ends meet. I am not prone to going to Doctors very often, maybe once or twice a year at most, so I don't have an extensive medical history to speak of.

Back in March I began to get ill. It started with periods of shortness of breath but progressed to pain in my chest, dizzy spells and my lymph nodes hurting. It would peak the same time every day M-F and get better on the weekends, so right off the bat I assumed that something in my routine was affecting me. 

My job at the time was split in the day with a 5 hour break, I worked a couple blocks from home so this was fine, and the symptoms would peak (and progressed over time) a couple hours after I would go back to work after my break. My office at work was near a boiler and it would vent towards me (this will be important later).

It got to a point where I visited a doctor. She did blood work and X-Ray of my lungs, not finding much outside of minor irritation, and prescribed me antibiotics and a steroid. These did not help, but I stayed the course for 2 weeks.

At the end of the 2 weeks I revisited the doctor, my symptoms had worsened and I had shooting stabbing pains around my body and spots forming in my vision. The dizzy spells were worse, the pain in my lymph nodes were worse, etc. Once again, peaking around the same time every day. At this point I was certain I was getting Carbon Monoxide poisoning because of the timing and symptoms. She did more labs, but didn't find much. She also ordered a carbon monoxide test but as this was a Saturday morning I wasn't sure how accurate it would be. I went home with no idea. (I do not blame this doctor by any means. I fully believe she tried, but the cause is sometimes illusive until it isn't).

My work performance was slipping and I was missing days, I couldn't afford to lose my job or continue to miss work, so I brought my concerns up with my boss who installed an air quality tester in my office that didn't do Carbon Monoxide, which left me nowhere.

Now is a point where I will bring up that I am an extremely routine individual and I had a couple other parts of my routine and habits during this time:

1. I smoke.
2. I drink coffee every weekday morning (14 ounce CUP but mainly ice and milk, I eventually measured the amount of actual coffee in cup and it is 3 to 4 ounces). (This was misconstrued early on as I drank A LOT of coffee, my bad in my explanations, so I took the effort to get the exact amount to clarify).
3. Most importantly, during my 5 hour breaks M-F I would go to a work shed on my property to get things ready for Spring/Summer projects. Only really went there on week days (weekends spent with wife and kids) and the building didn't look troublesome inside.

My symptoms progressed and the spot in my vision was getting worse. I went to an Ophthalmologist to get it checked as well, nothing abnormal.

As there are many wild cats in my town and we just got our children pet Ferrets I thought maybe I had a parasite, so I reached out to the doctor a little while later and requested to be checked for Toxoplasmosis, as the symptoms somewhat lined up in my searches when I considered a parasite perhaps. I went back and got tested, this was my 3rd visit to her in under a month. (3 visits + 1 opthalmologist visit to attempt to stop this).
Results were negative.

I was beginning to get concerned I was dying due to how bad the symptoms were getting, but from what? By now I had stopped drinking coffee, even quit smoking outside of a drag or two a day. Stopped all vitamins... I was certain something somewhere was poisoning me and I had told everyone I knew this.

Exactly 1 month from my initial Doctor's visit I was at home on the weekend. Since I had felt so bad during the week I didn't get much done at home, and I was feeling well enough to work on my stuff. I went out to my shed that day and worked for a bit and went in. A couple hours later I thought I was going to die. Chest pain was horrible, short of breath, stabbing pains and so dizzy. My vision seemed delayed and my mind didn't feel right either.

I told my wife to take me to the ER. I kissed my kids goodbye that day because I really wasn't sure if I was going to make it. I had never felt like that before.

My wife rushed me to the ER, I was hooked up to an EKG, blood pressure was high (normally isn't) labs started getting drawn after I explained my symptoms. I mentioned CO poisoning again and they attempted a painful test that uses the artery in the wrist. They failed at it 4 times and came back again to try and I denied it, I couldn't stand it anymore. I wasn't well, I couldn't think fully straight and I was in a lot of stabbing random pain.

Shortly after that I seized. Never had a seizure before in my life, didn't even know I had it, didn't believe my wife and the Dr at first. Just time lost and then being told.

That is where the problem arises.

I got an ambulance ride to a larger ER and more tests were done. Blood pressure was fine. EKG was normal. Drug test, etc. All fine.

A neurologist visited me and told me he saw no reason I should stay and that I just needed a follow up. ""Sometimes people get sick and have a seizure"" (I heard variations of that from a few people during the aftermath). More labs were done, including drug test, all fine. EKG was fine. Blood pressure was fine. I felt better. Nothing was accomplished, and the debt from all of this (our insurance was horrible, I owed thousands of dollars for my visits already) was piling.

So the next day when I left the ER I went to visit the Neurologist office and met with an NP (not the one in question). She ordered an EEG, MRI and heart monitor to be worn 2 weeks. She discussed that the seizure wasn't probably a giant issue and then said something that changed everything to my wife and I (and I fully believe saved my life): ""The symptoms sound like they could be Toxic Mold"".

I walked over and I got the $900 heart monitor and went home. Immediately my oldest son, wife and I (cautiously) started to check for areas of mold in every area I frequented, but mainly the workshop/shed because none of them were getting ill. Within my workshop (this was just a shed built of wood and drywall) behind cabinets that spanned one wall, was a considerable area of mold at the bottom of the wall that spanned the length of the cabinets along with mold on the back of the wood cabinets as well. My wife and oldest son never spent time in there, but an hour or so after being in there both of them also complained of feeling dizzy and having issues with their airways hurting.

I avoided the workshop for a couple weeks after and my symptoms went away slowly. Knowing that it was dangerous, and that we couldn't afford to fix such an issue, we tore the workshop/shed down wearing masks over a couple weeks after that so that our little ones wouldn't go in ever. Symptoms were gone. Everything was fine. It was over. 

It wasn't.

My previous employer shut down and I was set to transfer to a new job, but I was without insurance for that period. I attempted to postpone the EEG and MRI to when I thought I would have insurance again but the only option was to cancel. So I did. Symptoms were gone and horror story was over.

After starting my new job in August I was informed I would need a DOT physical. I scheduled that for later in August and got a call the day before that since I had a seizure I needed to get a Neurologist to look at me. Kind of figured that they wanted to be reassured I didn't have a history of Epilepsy or any injuries/etc. that would cause Epilepsy. Thought no problem. Insurance had kicked back in and I knew that they'd want the EEG and MRI, plus I knew the cause, so I rescheduled the EEG and MRI and went. (Test results for both were fine.)

Employer informed me that I needed my DOT Physical by Oct 1st and my Neurologist visit was Oct 16th, so I reached out and begged them to get me in sooner because it was extremely important and I needed to finish the process so I could move on. They scheduled me for late September - and I was extremely thankful - but sadly the last NP no longer worked there. Still didn't think this was an issue, I am fine, results are fine, found the cause (and the symptoms, including the seizure, fully matched long term toxic mold exposure). Medical records show I was having issues for a month leading up, but common sense tells me that no one that is Epileptic is considered safe on the road. Thing is, I'm not. 1 seizure with no abnormalities at 40 (or any age) isn't epilepsy. No cause for epilepsy. No abnormal readings that would show epilepsy. Average age for Epilepsy diagnosis is around 4 years old, I am 40. No family history. Simple I thought. Something that affects the central nervous system negatively - venom, mold, poisons - isn't Epilepsy.

I visit. Immediately this visit was NOT normal. She didn't want to discuss my test results. She didn't want to discuss my other symptoms. She didn't want to discuss the mold. She wasn't nice, or friendly or respectful in any way. She was dismissive and seemed genuinely angry with me. The ONLY thing she wanted to discuss was my coffee intake (which I began to explain, was cut off with ""that is excessive"") and then the fact I shouldn't had been driving until 6 months. Which - and I will fully admit, this isn't an excuse - I didn't know and no one informed me of. I had not driven for weeks until I felt better, mind you, but once I found the cause and was sure I was better I drove again. I didn't want to risk my family's life, or mine or anyone elses, but I approached it from what I thought was sensible and it does seem that was wrong and I had no idea.

She informed me that she was going to add a note saying I shouldn't drive until the 6 month mark (2 week after this visit), that what she was adding was ""legal"" in her eyes (which struck me as odd that she was defending it as legal even before I found out what was added) told me I didn't need any further visits or medications and walked out.
I should have checked the notes then, especially knowing the visit was so strange, but I trusted that she wrote I shouldn't drive until 6 months and knew 6 months was coming. I told her the cause, she had all of my records and results.... she was unpleasant, sure, but the thought that she did anything horrible (in my eyes) to my notes didn't cross my mind. I had to drive myself home - no one would come get me - but after that I informed my work and wife and pushed everything back until 6 months mark. 

At the 6 month mark I drove again and called to make my physical appointment. That was when I found out, because before I needed to see a Neurologist and now I had ""odd and concerning notes on my file"" and no one would be comfortable seeing me anymore.

I checked the notes.

She glossed over my cause and test results at the top. The very large remainder of the notes was copy and pasted state/federal law. A small portion of which applied to me, yes - and she hadn't explained that correctly to me either - but a very large portion of which clearly dealt with people with Epilepsy (once again, a condition that requires diagnosis that I wasn't diagnosed for nor meet criteria for). Just the parts to do with Epilepsy drown out the small notes she put at the top. Let me reiterate: She didn't diagnose me with Epilepsy, and I don't believe she could because from everything I see I don't meet the criteria AND it is highly unlikely I am based upon my age and results alone, not to even mention the symptoms I had and other evidence.

First. I wasn't too keen on having someone who isn't qualified in law putting it on my medical record, but I can plainly see that this heavily misleads others to believe that I am diagnosed with Epilepsy. She did not, in any way, clarify what she was actually putting on my notes not the gravity of what it implied.

My wife has been an RN for almost 15 years and has never seen anything like this. Other RNs we know have never seen anything like this. My medical notes from my visit are almost entirely a copy and pasted section of law that most of which doesn't apply to me... unless she diagnosed me with Epilepsy with no evidence, didn't tell me and didn't specify that anywhere in my file.

I can see why no doctors will now see me for anything to do with driving ever again, hell, even normal visits may assume I am Epileptic now because who in their right mind would put law regarding people diagnosed with Epilepsy on a non-epileptic patient's file?

So, I wrote letters to her and to any Dr in charge in Neurology. (Never heard anything back) that clarified the damage, and that I wanted the notes to change (and specify those portions of the law don't apply to me) or remove them or respond with clarification on whether or not I am diagnosed... Nothing. No response. I even offered to provide them with any evidence they needed, because I have ample people that know me that know this was uncalled for and are willing to tell anyone that I have never had previous seizures in my life (people that have known me my whole life willing to), that I was sick, that I got better, that they saw the mold and felt effects and we removed it, that the previous NP suggested it was toxic mold, anything and everything I could provide. Nothing.


Soon I will lose my job. 

The main question for those that do not wish to read:

So can a NP copy and paste law on the notes of a patient? Should they? Should they make sure the law actually applied to the patient in full? Are they even qualified to be throwing law around?

What do I do to stop this or what would you do? 

I am in North Dakota, I don't have a wealth of Neurologists and I suspect any further Neurologist visits will probably think she had information that I am hiding, which I'm not. I even requested what evidence she had for such a claim in my letter so that if she won't fix it I can show another that nothing is being hidden.... I don't know what to do.

1g6nqcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1g6nqcv/introducing_clariss_generate_and_download/,"Introducing Clariss: Generate and download beautiful color palettes from images, color names, and hex codes","A month ago, I was trying to build something interesting. I got the idea to create a simple website to detect the colors in an image [Clariss](http://www.clariss.xyz). I finished it on a weekend and started sharing it with people for feedback. In a while, I had enough feedback to iterate and improve the tool. The more I talked to people and implemented it, the more the tool changed into more than just a color detector.

Finally, it became a color palette generator that can generate palettes in four modes using images, a list of provided color names, and Hex codes. It can also download the palettes and convert Hex codes to Pantone color matches widely used in print projects.

[Clariss]([https://www.clariss.xyz/](https://www.clariss.xyz/)) is a free online tool for generating color pallets. It creates color palettes in the four color schemes; Monochromatic, Complimentary, Analogous, and Triadical. The color codes are in Hex and Pantone.

# # Generating color palettes using Clariss

You can generate color palettes on Clariss using four methods explained below:

1. Using [colors from an image](https://www.clariss.xyz/)
2. Using a provided [list of color names](https://www.clariss.xyz/color-names/)
3. Using a [specific color code](https://www.clariss.xyz/generate-palettes-from-hex/)

# # Method 1. Using an image color scanner

There are two ways to select images to upload:

* **Drag and drop**¬†- You can drag an image into the image drop zone.
* **File selection**¬†- you can also click on the drop zone, and a file selection menu will open to allow you to select the image from your local storage.

https://preview.redd.it/1djyi8uftjvd1.png?width=1790&format=png&auto=webp&s=1da0d84ca89e5db377cd00291749f13936f21919

# ## Scan Level

After selecting the image, you can click on the drop-down menu below the drop zone and pick the scan Level you want on your image. There are four choices:

* **Quick scan**¬†extracts the top¬†**10**¬†most dominant colors from your image.
* **A basic scan**¬†extracts the top¬†**16**¬†most dominant colors from your image.
* **Extended scan**¬†extracts the top¬†**24**¬†most dominant colors from your image.
* **Extreme scan**¬†extracts the top¬†**32**¬†most dominant colors from your image.

If you don't select scan level,¬†**Quick-scan**¬†will applied by default.  
Upload the image using the upload button and wait for the results.

**Image Scan results page**

The image Scan page looks like the below example:

https://preview.redd.it/j93980xktjvd1.png?width=1827&format=png&auto=webp&s=028219832057cc07e732df196d7552dd52fa2fb1

The results are the colors extracted from the image uploaded, their color codes, and the estimated percentage of that color shade in the scanned image.

**Getting a specific color from the scanned images**

If you want to know a specific color code that is on the scanned image, you can click on that part of the image, and the color code will appear below the scanned image as shown below:

https://preview.redd.it/y6887dyotjvd1.png?width=1899&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc00b42d39cc0619157d764df5f9949a0943ca13

**Color palettes**

To get color palettes from the colors scanned from the image, click on the color boxes. When you click a color box, its color palettes will appear in a pop-up. In the pop-up, you can select the color palette mode you want between the four options shown below.

https://preview.redd.it/gpyb8fjttjvd1.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecbac57e10757eabd10bcff7a16f838c25afbcb5

On the results page, there are three download options below the color boxes:

**1. Download colors**¬†- in this option, you can download the color boxes and their corresponding color codes. Example:

https://preview.redd.it/3o4m2l8ytjvd1.png?width=1674&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2b36e3c2984b1776c97ed5780d45760679beda6

**2. Download colors + image**¬†- in this option, you can download the color boxes, their hex codes, and the scanned image. Example:

https://preview.redd.it/uznegnb1ujvd1.png?width=1674&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ceceeb4f5ac954ae42275e481fab5c5d1ba9345

**3. Download a \`.act\` file**¬†- in this option, you can download a \`.act\` file that can help you import the colors into Photoshop or any other image editing tools that allow color importation using a \`.act\` file. Example:

https://preview.redd.it/pim2qhf4ujvd1.png?width=2180&format=png&auto=webp&s=93b82daa7a61fc15ba69fe8caf1b35522589769b

You can download the color pallets using the download button.  
You can also copy color codes from specific color swashes by clicking on the code.

# Method 2. Color palettes from color names

Clariss has a list of more than¬†**700 color names**¬†and their respective color codes in both hex code and Pantone format. To generate color pallets from the colors, click on the color boxes.

By clicking the color box, a pop-up appears with the four color palette schemes.

https://preview.redd.it/vicdyaqaujvd1.png?width=1109&format=png&auto=webp&s=d92c32ed649afcddef519e71f1400c706d38b7c4

The color palettes are downloadable using the download button. Their respective color codes are convertible to Pantone using the Pantone switch.

You can also use the search bar to search for specific colors, or filter specific color shades:

https://preview.redd.it/ca5ymmedujvd1.png?width=1109&format=png&auto=webp&s=514fb8b93cb4493e76819b6f117ac33d10246b42

# Method 3. Generating custom color palettes

You can also generate custom color palettes in the four-color palette schemes using Hex codes. To do so, enter your hexacode in the color code field and click the \`Generate\` button.

https://preview.redd.it/slj9k8ahujvd1.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=67dcf8913700ce944504d269824fcb6d9aa71d19

In the above case you should get results similar to:

https://preview.redd.it/egcoo9ijujvd1.png?width=948&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ec7ce6c6c3a6efe5ab7c055e7998dbf3643ee22

# Color codes conversion

Clariss offers two color code formats. By default, the color codes are in¬†**Hexacode(HEX)**¬†format. But in they can be converted into¬†**Pantone(PMS)**¬†color codes and back to hexacodes. There are several ways to do that:

**1. Image color results**

After [scanning an image](https://www.clariss.xyz/) for its color compositions for palate generation, the results page lists the colors in hexacode. You can convert the color codes to Pantone colors and back to hexacodes using the Pantone switch between the scanned image and the colors. Below are the colors listed in Pantone color code format:

https://preview.redd.it/viqe5x2nujvd1.png?width=1672&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea8de601efdbf74fb563ca4172d456efef4891b3

**2. Color names**

In the [color names collection page](https://www.clariss.xyz/color-names/), you can change the color codes from hexacodes to Pantone and vice versa using the switch button between the search bar and the list of colors. Below is an example:

https://preview.redd.it/ct3srqppujvd1.png?width=1738&format=png&auto=webp&s=af61a0a10b77a64ee6033e5606da77ed3eb5de32

**3. Color palettes pop-up**

Upon clicking any color box in clariss, you will get the pop-up showing you the color palettes of that specific color in the four color schemes. The color palette swashes are in Hex codes by default. To convert them to Pantone and vice versa, use the Pantone switch at the top of the page. Here is an example of a monochromatic color palette with the color swashes labeled in Pantone color codes:

https://preview.redd.it/w24or79sujvd1.png?width=1124&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfefb85012a7f62c2362a0f004d4e2f64dc8de62

**4. The Hex ‚áÑ Pantone converter**

The [Hex ‚áÑ Pantone converter](https://www.clariss.xyz/converter/) converts hexacodes to Pantone codes and vice versa:

https://preview.redd.it/hemx1oxuujvd1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=19647a2e678ac84a9e13dd5c3f2604bdba10a205

The image above shows the results of converting¬†*#ffb1bb*¬†to Pantone. You can do vice versa by using a well-known Pantone color code name.

# Downloading color palettes

In the palettes pop-up, it is possible to download color palettes. The downloaded color palettes get labeled in either hexacodes or Pantone depending on the state of the Pantone toggler switch. Here is an example of a pop-up with the download button highlighted:

https://preview.redd.it/on4yvalxujvd1.png?width=2096&format=png&auto=webp&s=74269ec7bf5184f7af3db717dff44693aec5bf10

1g6noq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1g6noq1/lion_diet_for_6_months_still_depressed_any/,Lion diet for 6 months - still depressed - any suggestions?,"Tried higher fat, more calories, eating OMAD, tried eating in more meals a day to fit in as much as I can‚Ä¶

The only thing that seems to help depression is when I‚Äôm fasting for 7 days & really hungry- right before eating I feel happy.

Otherwise can‚Äôt seem to kick the depression

I know that diet can‚Äôt fix being trapped in a horrible chronic life situation but we need some level of optimism to be able to start to work out a way out of it & to have energy to escape it. 

Mid 40s so could just be natural aging but hope not as I‚Äôm now in the worst part of my life situation-wise, after a very happy and successful life until recent years in top earners, now lost everything including all Family & friends. Tried to get some semblance of a normal life back for over a decade- nothing worked so far: need to kick this depression.

Is there anything other than eating only ruminant meat that I haven‚Äôt tried that might help?

I‚Äôve also tried going to carnivore including eggs etc. result? I guess happier merely because of mouth pleasure but no change in overall mood- still depressed.

I also tried stopping the diet & going down to keto- same happened again. Mouth pleasure = increased mood before eating. Tried starting coffee (never had caffeine in my life) & it acted like an anti depressant , it worked but it made me jittery & caused acid reflux & severe GERD so can‚Äôt do that. I Tried coming off diet completely & having tea & cake occasionally- this helped with mood again because of mouth pleasure. I can tell sugar is a drug. But I became gradually (over months) really unwell physically going back to high carb diet. Many illnesses. It‚Äôs like lion diet stripped my defences. 

Tried blood work - all normal (except elevated cholesterol as expected on lion diet)

Tried more electrolytes, real salt, Malden salt etc. no change‚Ä¶ 

On lion doet this is my food:
Ribeye lamb cutlets , chops, lamb rack, sirloin, I eat liver in proportion with the animal  & organs when I can find them

I NEVER cheated. 

Must it always be a choice between mental health & physical health for me? 

I realise diet can‚Äôt fix life situation but we need optimism to fight it in modern times.

Dr palmer‚Äôs work shows keto under 20g a day fixes depression and almost all
Known mental illness. 

Am I so addicted to sugar that I now rely on sugar for feeling normal ? Clearly lion diet felt best physically (all physical illnesses gone) but I can‚Äôt handle the depression. 

Appreciate any dietary suggestions I haven‚Äôt tried.

Absolutely desperate here but I fear it might just be that I‚Äôm born in an awful overpopulated urban country with too many laws against living free, and I‚Äôm kind of check-mated. 

FYI also depressed on sugar diet but at least have daily 50% of the time happiness as opposed to 1%.

I tried doing grass fed only, and tried switching to lamb only and beef only. 

Also tried more time - carnivore for an extra 3 months totalling 9 months carnivore (6 lion).

Dietary advice welcome. 

Thanks

A night owl but I'd love to be an early bird. I live in Laguna but currently dorm near UST.

I enjoy eating, cooking, playing games, watching anime and youtube videos. I love playing sports, namely badminton, table tennis, and soccer. I'd like to think I go to the gym regularly, but more of 2x -1x a week at most due to college, I go more on vacations. Currently studying in UST, hopefully for only 2 more years. My clothing and style goes hand in hand with my taste in music I think, I am very loyal to Punk Rock and Emo, but I also like more relaxing music like Laufey and Jason Mraz, so I wear monochromatic clothing in blacks grays and whites, sometimes with a striking but miniscule pop of color to contrast. I love dressing for comfort, If it was socially acceptable to walk around in my PJs I'd walk out more, but I also love dressing up for occasions, looking suave hopefully. I love accessorizing with earrings, rings, necklaces, a watch.

I do not like smoking, I'm pretty sure I'm allergic to alcohol, enough so that I will probably die before I get drunk, I think I'm addicted to vaping, but I do not actively vape, I believe its a waste of money and health, but I will not judge those actively vaping, but I will still attempt to dissuade friends.

I'm ISTJ-A, if you are into that sort of thing. I'm an ambivert, I'm shy initially but I don't open up too hard. I'm lazy, so I work hard so I don't have to work anymore as soon as possible. I'm not very spontaneous, but I'd like to be a bit more spontaneous. My humor is generally adaptive, jokes in bad taste will be heard, but I hope the good ones land well enough for the bad ones to be forgiven.

About you:   
- 21-24  
- I dont mind any height as long as you don't mind mine xd  
- preferably active in sports or in the gym  
- No smoking, pref not vaping, but im more fine with it, casual drinking is ok  
- Mainly speaks english or taglish  
- from Laguna (Sta. Rosa - Calamba, laguna is huge lol) or Manila  
- Outgoing or Introverted, both fine with me  
- Likes food and coffee as much as I do  
- Willing to eat what I cook, but that shouldn't be hard after seeing what I cook (must be ok with rare-medium rare steaks :3)  
- Fine with some alone time, Its just something I'm used to, being ssb, or maybe you'll make me not ok with alone time  
- Honest and frank, I might be dense so I need to be told straight

I have been single for my entire life, not that I haven't tried, or maybe I didn't try enough, or maybe that says something about me, I don't know, but I hope you can judge for yourself. Ask any questions I'm an open book.",0,1729272357.0,PhR4Dating,0,0.5,False

We immediately connected. An experience and feeling I really didn‚Äôt think existed. We talked for 30 minutes, exchanged contact info, and planned the first date. I really thought I was over the whole ‚Äúgushy texting‚Äù thing that comes with most relationships, but everything flowed so naturally. We talked and talked every day and night until our first date, which was 6am coffee. I drove to her place and waited outside of my car for her to come down. When she walked outside my heart skipped a beat and time started to slow. We hugged and greeted and drove off to get our coffee. Once we got our order, we sat it the parking lot and just talked. It was the easiest time I‚Äôd ever experienced talking to someone new. We talked about life, music taste, religious/political views, and what really fired us up. I couldn‚Äôt help but to get lost in her eyes every time I turned to reply. I really couldn‚Äôt tell if I was dreaming. We sat in that lot for 2 hours and drove back to her place, and sat in the parking lot for ANOTHER 2 hours. So much was shared, and when I turned to ask her something, she went in for the kiss. As soon as our lips met there were sparks flying. A warm and gentle feeling and our hands intertwined. The chemistry was immaculate. We were there until 10am and so much passion was shared. When it was time to depart, I got out and hugged her goodbye. I knew that she was the one the second I let go, I was already falling in love with this astonishingly amazing woman, whom I connected with on the deepest levels. I sent her an ‚ÄúI miss you‚Äù text before I even left the parking lot (cheesy I know) and she was just so happy about the entire experience. She went off to work, we messaged constantly throughout the day, and I found myself being invited back over to her place the night. She is the first person I have ever been 100% honest and open with, no closed door, nothing to hide, right out of the gate. We talked about the future, what long term goals looked like, and the stars were aligned. She already has kids, and that‚Äôs something that I had zero hesitation about. I personally don‚Äôt need to have kids of my own to live a happy and fulfilling life. I left around 4am and I‚Äôm sure it can be inferred how the remainder of the evening went. This was the most magical time I‚Äôve ever experienced with another human being, and I was previously engaged to an ex I was with for 4 years (a story for a different time). We had another coffee date for our second date, and took an extravagant day trip out of state for our 3rd date. With her I felt free. No disagreements, no clashing, no arguments. Just a purely blissful experience through and through. 

The tough part

Two days after our trip she had messaged me with concerns for her current situation (we both struggle with mental illness) and said that I was just so amazing and sweet and good to her, but she needed to get her situation sorted out before moving forward with anything. It felt like everything, all the momentum built, had come to a halt. I couldn‚Äôt be upset or angry at her for that. I mean I truly believe that we were meant to eventually cross paths and enjoy life together. I continued to express my feelings on the situation, and told her that I would be okay but it definitely hurt to think about. The important thing is that she‚Äôs doing the best thing for her right now. The days following, we still texted, but my depression started eating away at me. It made me wonder what I had done wrong, why did it end up this way, and it left me lying in bed for 2 days straight. I had cancelled plans, called out of work, and just laid there with my heart broken. I wanted to get answers as to how it would proceed or ultimately get closure so I could move forward. She told me that I didn‚Äôt scare her away, that I did nothing wrong, and that I was one of the sweetest people she had ever met, she just needed to get this figured out for herself. I told her that regardless of whether we‚Äôre together, friends, or whatever the situation may be, I will always be in her corner cheering her on. We‚Äôre on great terms, but I don‚Äôt know if getting back together is a pipe dream or realistic. She is all I could ever ask for or want in someone. She is someone I would move mountains for to ensure she gets the life that she deserves. She knows how I feel, and I would and will continue to remind her just how strong she is for being able to push through all of the shit she‚Äôs been through, and provide for her kids the way that she does. Right now I‚Äôm holding on to the hope that we will get back together after, but for now just being here for her is okay with me - as long as she‚Äôs happy and getting into a better situation. 

For context: I have talked to her about the possibility of getting back together after. This post was mostly written to express my feelings and to gain outside perspective. We also made it exclusive at the end of the night of our first date.",1,1729272355.0,LoveAtFirstSight,0,1.0,False

Feel a little tired and irritable.,"I recently quit caffeine and after 3 days my hunger has gone up, sex drive through the roof, and my performance in the gym has improved. Anxiety is a mere fraction of what it was. I had no idea how much of my daily anxiety and mental rumination was caused by it. Furthermore, I am finally sleeping all the way through the night. My quality of sleep has improved exponentially and I can feel the need for sleep creep over me by about 9-30pm. Historically this has not been something I was experiencing before bed. 

I was not drinking coffee. Coffee had soo many negative effects on me. The anxiety was unrelentless. So, some years back I switched to caffeine pills and I was taking 400mg every day split into 2 doses. I have been consuming caffeine in coffee and then pill form for the better part of 18yrs. Quite a while now that I think of it. 

I weaned off of the caffeine pills I used to take over the course of the past two weeks. I kept halving the dose until I was at zero. Now, 3 days later I have no headaches and no crashes to report, but I do lack the energy to get going and I do find myself unmotivated in the gym. 

I don't have that ""higher"" gear I once had, which is concerning. I am also finding myself irritable and annoyed with the people around me, especially my family. I am in control, though. No snapping or snippy comments just negative thoughts. Strangely enough I feel more tethered to Earth and more present. 

The whole experience has been a net gain! I don't see myself going back to caffeine anytime soon.

A preface to my question: I workout frequently, eat an animal based diet, get great sleep, and prioritize sunlight.

Oura change DISCOVERIES depending on which tag you choose instead of looking at true associations,"I love the idea of advanced machine learning but I don't find that Oura is being honest with tagging in regards to the DISCOVERIES feature.

When I tagged every coffee as ""coffee"" I got a Discovery that it decreased my ""total sleep time"".

All good if the machine learning found that association BUT when I changed every ""coffee tag"" to ""medication"" Oura suddenly removed that association.

If the algorithm actually just looked at associations between this tag and ""total sleep time"" then it would have remained with changing every ""coffee""-tag to ""medication"". But it did not.

Why? u/locke-at-oura

I love your work and I want tagging and Discoveries to become agnostic to which tag I choose and just look at associations.

I tagged ""coffee"" 42 times before changing it to ""medication"" to be sure that the Discoveries feature had enough data points. But it didn¬¥t matter in the end. The tagging and Discoveries didn¬¥t look at any true association between the tags and measured biometrics.

TLDR: what‚Äôs the best plan for weight loss and balancing hormones etc when OMAD doesn‚Äôt feel supporting or good yet? 

I‚Äôve been keto for two years now, but falling off due to food addiction pretty regularly. Carnivore has quieted food noise for me, which is great. In the past, I was able to fast better/longer (until I binged again), but I‚Äôm not there yet right now.  
(My highest weight was 555lbs. I got to 398 then regained some and have been ‚Äústuck‚Äù at 420 for over a year playing the ‚Äúdirty keto‚Äù game which caused so much inflammation. What finally pushed me to fully commit to carnivore was the fact that I ballooned up to 440 quickly and I also know I have so many food sensitivities paired with sugar/food addictions it seems like my ‚Äúonly hope.‚Äù Before carnivore, I joined OA and have been off sugar and flour for over 3 months. This has also been a major shift. 
Anyway, I‚Äôm finding a lot of peace doing carnivore and I‚Äôve lost 18 pounds in less than a month. I hope to keep a good mindset about it and not think about when I‚Äôm gonna fall off track because it feels really good right now.
I‚Äôm eating all meats, some bacon and eggs, some cheese and a measured amount of heavy cream in my coffee. 
I am eating breakfast around 10 AM. Sometimes I can stretch that to 1 PM. 
I would love advice on how to structure my days and to hear how anyone who has lost over 100 pounds has structured this for the long haul. I workout daily which is the only thing that kept me from gaining even more back and drink a gallon of water most days.

1g6ncf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/rome/comments/1g6ncf2/trip_reporta_week_in_rome_and_no_pickpockets/,Trip report--A week in Rome and no pickpockets!,"Trip Report‚ÄîA week in Rome and no pickpockets! Sheesh.

Thank you all, redditors. I lurked on this sub for months before our trip and you were a goldmine of information that was really helpful.

And thank you, Rome. What a glorious, beautiful, wonderful city.

I just got back from a week in Rome. My family rode the Metro, walked through crowded touristy areas looking at beautiful things, spent time in the Termini train station, and I have to report that we did not see any pickpockets, did not see anyone who seemed sketchy in the train station or in the Metro, only saw one bracelet guy who immediately ran off when I blocked him, and were not impressed by the level of litter (which was mostly a sprinkling of cigarette butts). 

We had a great time. We love Rome!

Of course the taxi drivers tried to rip us off, like the one going from the airport to town who, when I verified it was 55 euros, said ‚ÄúEach,‚Äù but we laughed in his face and said, ‚ÄúNice joke, not happening.‚Äù Same thing for returning from town to the airport, he wanted 65 euros once we arrived. We said ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs 55, that's all you're gonna get,‚Äù and that was that. For the record, we are women in our 60s traveling with a 20-something special-needs person, so we are not exactly burly threatening types. Stand your ground, there is nothing they can do about it if you know the price and refuse to let them rip you off.

We stayed in Prati, in an apartment with a daily outdoor fruit/veggie marked in the street next to it. This was fabulous! Italy has the best produce I‚Äôve ever had. There is nothing fresher or more wonderful than food from these little markets. Prati was great. Lively during the day, totally dead at night for those who like to sleep. We walked all over Rome from our home base there and loved it.

I am pleased to report that POCKET COFFEE is now in season. I saw it at every grocery checkout line and brought some back to the US with me.

About the bracelet guy, he approached my son thinking he had an easy target, but I stepped between them with my arms out in a basketball-guarding move, and he immediately veered off and went away. I did not see any people selling those fake-squeaky splat toys, no rose sellers, no roving pickpocket gangs. There were a few panhandlers stationed outside churches and some people claiming to sell tickets to the hop-on hop-off buses (maybe they were legit; didn't seem like it to me, though). That was it. Honestly there are far more sketchy people and ripoff artists in Times Square or Penn Station in NYC. In fact, when we got home, a vendor in Penn Station tried to charge us $5.85 each for bottles of water (we laughed at him and said ‚ÄúNice joke, not gonna happen‚Äù), so NYC clearly has the upper hand on scamming. Come on, Rome, better up your game here if you want redditors to have shady stuff to complain about!

We did encounter a couple of waiters who tried the ‚Äútip is not included‚Äù gambit on us, but it did not work, thanks to all of you redditors who warned about it.

Favorite places in Rome:

Castel Sant‚ÄôAngelo. It‚Äôs a mausoleum/fort/castle, with a sword-wielding angel on top. How could you not love it!

Santa Maria in Trastevere church. Beautiful!¬†

The Pantheon. Also beautiful, and incredible because it has been continuously used for so long.

The Gianicolo Hill, and the walk back along the top of it to St. Peter‚Äôs. A beautiful, peaceful walk with great views.

The Aventine Hill, also peaceful with great views.

Basilica of San Clemente: WOW. If you like archeology (and even if you don‚Äôt), this is one of the most fascinating places you will ever see.

Isola Tiburina: Another beauty spot in Rome.

Tips for people going to Rome (and Italy in general):

Learn some Italian. We did learn enough Italian before we went to be able to greet and thank people, order gelato, order in a restaurant, ask for things, shop at the grocery store/pharmacy, and buy tickets. Yes, there were many people who spoke English, but everyone we used our limited Italian on truly appreciated that we had made the effort to adapt to their language and culture instead of just assuming they would adapt to ours. We met up with a friend there who did not make any effort to speak Italian (not even a ‚Äúbuongiorno‚Äù), and she was irate that everywhere she went, people were ‚Äúrude‚Äù to her. I went to the same shops she did and people were perfectly polite and friendly to me; the only difference was that I didn‚Äôt just barge in and start speaking English. I used Duolingo as a base but also learned from blogs, books, youtube, etc.¬†

Use the ‚Äúyour turn‚Äù ticket machines. If you go to any customer-service situation, like a pharmacy or train-ticket office, there may be no visible ‚Äúline‚Äù of waiting people and it looks like people are just randomly standing around. This is because there is a machine that gives you a ticket with a number indicating your turn. Find the machine, get your ticket, and look for the board behind the counter that indicates when your number comes up.

Pretend you‚Äôre a New Yorker. You will never have to deal with scammers if you just act like you know where you‚Äôre going and what you‚Äôre doing and don‚Äôt make eye contact with people who come up to you. Don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúNo, grazie.‚Äù You have no obligation to be polite to people who want to commit crimes on you. Don‚Äôt acknowledge that they exist at all. If you do this, you will walk through a field of sketchy people like Moses parting the Red Sea, and you will have a great trip. Scammers can see they'll be wasting time on you, and they will look for softer targets, leaving you more time to enjoy the glories of Rome.",11,1729271515.0,rome,4,1.0,False

We‚Äôve been together almost a year and it‚Äôs honestly been like a dream come true.

We met at this cute coffee shop, and I can‚Äôt even describe how cute she looked when she walked in (total heart eyes. We ended up talking for hours about everything from our favorite books to our weirdest childhood stories. It felt like I‚Äôd known her forever, you know?

And it just keeps getting better. We have spontaneous dance parties in our livin room, weekend trips to adorable lil towns, and movie marathons with popcorn and blankets. She even made me a scrapbook with pics and memories from our first year together, and I seriously ugly cried.

But here‚Äôs where it gets complicated. I just found out she met someone else online and is kinda confused about what to do. I‚Äôm not mad, just‚Ä¶ worried? Like, I love her and I want her to be happy, but I can‚Äôt help but feel this pit in my stomach. We have such a good thing going, but I don‚Äôt wanna hold her back if she‚Äôs got feelings for someone else.

We did have this super awkward moment the other day when we tried cooking dinner together for the first time and ended up burning the pasta and setting off the smoke alarm. We laughed so much it was ridiculous, but it also made me realize how much I treasure our time together.

I just wish I knew what to do. It feels like I‚Äôm in a fairy tale (smoke alarms and all), but with this confusion hanging over us, I‚Äôm not sure how to navigate it. Anyone else ever been in a similar situation?",1,1729271467.0,LesbianActually,9,0.67,False

My gf and I have been in a relationship for over 4 years now. While we have had our ups and downs, I‚Äôm totally dedicated and loyal to her and want to marry her sometime soon in the future, as soon as she is done with her higher education. I genuinely love her and see a future with her.

My female friend Sarah and I have been friends for the past couple of years, honestly as long as I‚Äôve been dating my gf. Her family and my family are friends as well, and I have always looked out for Sarah‚Äôs younger brother and mentored him, as their father passed away due to cancer. Whether it‚Äôs providing career advice, writing letters of recommendation, job referrals, or even financially assisting the family at rare times, I‚Äôve always casually looked out for Sarah and her family when I am able to. I was raised by a single mother and know personally how hard it can be. My gf is aware of me helping out this family in the past, and has met Sarah a couple of times but is by no means close to her in any way. 

Recently my gf went on a week long trip to Atlanta for work. During this time Sarah got into a car wreck. Luckily she wasn‚Äôt injured. We decided to hang out on the weekend and grab some coffee or boba and catch up, talk about some of the issues her family and her were facing recently, and see if I could do anything to help them out. We have hanged out in the past before but always in a group setting. 

On the day Sarah and I were going to hang out, I texted my gf about me having plans to hang out with Sarah. She asked if it was just going to be her, and I responded with ‚ÄúRight now yes, but her siblings might join like they‚Äôve done in the past tbh.‚Äù I then asked ‚ÄúIs that fine with you‚Äù to which she responded ‚ÄúDo whatever you want.‚Äù 

Uh oh. I knew she was troubled if she said that. I immediately said ‚ÄúIf this makes you uncomfortable I can cancel right now‚Äù, as well as ‚ÄúI just want to be transparent with you‚Äù. She kept responding with ‚ÄúNo‚Äù and stonewalling me, saying she was fine. Eventually I just took her word for it, picked up Sarah, and we went to a cafe I enjoy 30 minutes away in a nearby city, where I paid for the coffee and we chatted. I updated my gf when I arrived at the coffee shop, telling her the name of the coffee shop (she never responded). After our conversation I updated my gf that I‚Äôm heading back to drop Sarah off, and I then proceeded to take Sarah home. I then texted my gf that I was going to go hang out with another male friend of mine and then went on with my day. 

My gf has come back from her trip to Atlanta and is now extremely upset at me for hanging out with Sarah. She is saying that I went on a date with Sarah and cheated on her. Her main argument is that I didn‚Äôt tell her that Sarah‚Äôs siblings didn‚Äôt come along when I picked her up so it was just us alone, that I picked her up and dropped her off, paid for her coffee, and went to a nearby different city but didn‚Äôt specifically mention I was going to a nearby city. Furthermore, my location via Snapchat was not on, but this is due to me having a week ago bought a new phone and I didn‚Äôt set up my location via Snapchat yet. 

After thinking about it, I can see her point of view. It does look bad. If that happened in reverse to me, where a man picked up my gf, took her out to coffee, paid for her drink, and my gf‚Äôs location was off, it would seem suspicious and I would be upset as well. It‚Äôs the perfect storm.  

I picked up Sarah and dropped her off since her car was totaled, and paid for the coffee since she‚Äôs going through financial hardship right now. I was just genuinely just trying to be a good guy and help out a friend, and have no romantic feelings whatsoever towards Sarah. I do however feel that my gf is going to far of accusing me of being a cheater and saying I went out on a date with Sarah. We were just hanging out and seeing if I can help her and her family out. Being accused as a cheater and her repeatedly saying I went on a date with her is causing me emotional pain and anxiety. I don‚Äôt think a cheater would announce he is going to hang out with a girl, provide some level of updates, and even say he can cancel the hangout if she‚Äôs uncomfortable with it. I even tried to give her a chance to communicate with me even before the hangout, which she refused to do so. 

I‚Äôm not excusing myself however. I could‚Äôve communicated more clearly, let my gf know l of the city I went to instead of just the cafe name, provided more updates throughout the time I was hanging out, and made it clear it was just me and Sarah. For these mistakes I do sincerely feel bad and own up to them, and have  apologized to my gf. I‚Äôm not trying to discredit her feelings, they are valid. But I‚Äôm still continuously hurt but what my gf is saying about me being a cheater and going in a date with another woman.

We have taken some time apart to cool down and think. Am I being unreasonable here in saying that I‚Äôm not a cheater and did not go on a date with Sarah? Or are my gf‚Äôs accusations too much?

Any guidance, advice, or feedback are appreciated. 

TL;DR - My gf is upset that I hanged out with my female friend and is accusing me of cheating. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm in the wrong here or if her accusations are going too far.",12,1729271458.0,relationships,11,0.88,False

After playing Wild World religiously as a kid, I haven't picked up and other Animal Crossings on any other consoles, but a while ago I got my hands on a switch and got New Horizons! Unfortunately I found myself overwhelmed by how much has changed since the old days and haven't played in a long time. I've recently picked it back up and determined to play the game to the full extent! Complete all nook acheivements, collect all DIY's, etc, and yes I know it's going to take forever...

I've tried to read all the guides and pages and posts on tips and tricks for the game but I'm struggling to take it all in! Therefore.. I'm trying to create some sort of Ultimate Daily To-Do list and I could use some help from all you amazing people!

I've got most of the basic stuff.. hit the bell rock each day, dig the fossils up and get them assessed, check all the shops on my island and Harv's island every day, have a coffee at the roost every day, shake 2 furniture out of trees every day, do the daily Kapp'n boat tour, talk to all villagers each day, E.t.c

If you guys could help me out with any more daily/weekly tasks that would be amazing! Especially with the less well known ones, apparently theres a villager DIY you can obtain each day or something? And what is all this 'wish on a star' stuff??

I have no desire to reach out, reconnect, rekindle. Our interactions since are just so fundamentally different, the feeling of being at home and safe in her presence is gone. we did polite small talk, she was very casual as she always is, she'd gotten a coffee like we were gonna be chilling but I was just there to do what was long overdue. we sorted some leftover bill stuff that I absolutely did not need to help her with but it's fine I just think I deserve a nobel peace prize perhaps. she mentioned that her and her partner (cheated on me with/left me for) were thinking of getting a dog when they move in together. I in no way asked but didn't give much of a reaction. she gave me her new contact details (purely for practical reasons- although she's moved out we're on a lease together so it's just in case anything comes up with that) and inputted her contact name as ""evil ex"", I again didn't much respond. as I left I let it slip ever so slightly that since we've gone our separate ways I've started to find myself into the kind of social spaces we'd both always wanted, she asked to know where and I told her that they were mine which I know is petty/not completely in the no contact spirit but I was lighthearted about it and also let me have this one lol

and after that, for the first time, I started feeling like I didn't care so much about getting justice or karma hitting her. just more of an ""eh that really sucks but whatever"". don't get me wrong, those feelings do still hit and I still definitely know I've been wronged, but it felt like the beginning of truly letting go. I know I've got a long way to go still. today I miss her. like really fucking miss her. my silly girl with the purest heart who would do the goofiest things to make me laugh or smile. I haven't cried about it for a while but yesterday sure was the day lol. it's almost been 6 months now which is simultaneously so hard to believe but it also feels like it's been forever. this is my first real relationship breakup so I don't have the experience of getting through it and finding love again but I really really hope it'll come when it's time and if anyone who has more relationship experience would like to reassure me that I'll live that'd be appreciated haha. some days still feel like mourning and yesterday was one of those. just feeling a lot so needed to get this out and feel heard

What has worked for you?,"One year ago I gained a lot of weight within a few months. I went from being a size 6/8 to a size 12.¬† months prior to the weight gain I was diagnosed with PCOS at age 27.

I am frustrated as I have tried so many things to lose weight in the past 12 months including;

* A high protein, mainly whole food diet. A typical day for me is Chia seed pudding & berries for breakfast, chicken salad for lunch and Salmon, sweet potato and greens for dinner. If I want something sweet it will be dark chocolate or banana and peanut butter for example.¬†
* I take berberine which has helped reduce sugar cravings and food noise.
* I started 1,500mg Metformin 9 months ago which has regulated my periods. But it has caused acne for me and some hair loss.
* I‚Äôve been strictly gluten and dairy free for 9 months. This seems to have helped a bit with extreme bloating and inflammation but tbh I find this measure quite miserable as I love sharing food with friends and family. I don‚Äôt like to restrict too much due to a history of Eating disorders and often question the validity of influencers who say GF, DF is the only way forward‚Ä¶¬†
* I always get at least 10,000 steps a day.
* I go to the gym 3 times a week to do strength training, pilates and Zumba for fun.
* I get 8 hours sleep without fail.¬†
* I stopped drinking coffee and alcohol.
* I regularly consume gut healthy foods like apple cider vinegar, kimchi, kombucha etc.
* I do lymphatic drainage massages every night.
* I started therapy to heal childhood trauma.

Despite all this, my body has been incredibly resistant to weight loss. I am wondering if there is something else at play? It could be due to something else including:

* I recently got an ADD diagnosis and have started Elvanse medication a couple of days ago. I am hoping that this will address the stress I experience in my work and home life.
* At the time of the weight gain I had just quit my SSRI medication cold turkey. I wonder if I need to be patient and wait for my brain to recover from that shock/withdrawal?¬†
* Extreme constipation, blood in my stool, painful bloating, pelvic pain and brain fog are other major symptoms for me. Sometimes I wonder if I have an autoimmune disease like Hypothyroidism or celiac disease. The NHS tells me my blood work is okay and just gives me laxatives‚Ä¶
* Nine months before my weight gain I took a few rounds of antibiotics and strong painkillers for a tooth infection and I think it negatively affected my gut health maybe causing SIBO or Candida overgrowth. I also lived in a damp room for three years at that time.

Has anyone else experienced anything similar? I‚Äôd love to know what lifestyle changes have worked for you and helped you to finally lose the weight?¬†",13,1729270712.0,PCOS,26,0.93,False

The weather is decent, tourists are everywhere, and I‚Äôve got my swagger on full display. Why? Because I‚Äôm rocking my Rolex GMT-Master II Pepsi‚Äîagain. The way it glistens in the light, I‚Äôm convinced people are noticing.

I walk into this trendy caf√© for a quick espresso. It‚Äôs one of those hipster spots where the coffee costs ¬£10, the baristas have beards longer than Gandalf, and they serve everything on slate slabs instead of plates. I sit at a window table, casually sipping my coffee, and every so often, I ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù raise my wrist so that the watch catches the light. You know the move.

Suddenly, I hear a voice behind me. ‚ÄúOi, mate, that‚Äôs a lovely Rolex you‚Äôve got there!‚Äù

I turn around, and there‚Äôs this random guy dressed as if he‚Äôs just finished competing in a strongman competition. Picture a man about seven feet tall, built like a mountain, covered in tattoos of‚Äîwait for it‚Äîwatch parts. Yes, watch parts. Gears, springs, tiny hands, you name it. His arms are basically an exploded diagram of a Swiss timepiece. He‚Äôs got one of those thick cockney accents that makes every word sound like he‚Äôs about to throw a punch for no reason.

Before I can even respond, he‚Äôs already sitting down at my table, uncomfortably close. ‚ÄúLet me have a look at that beauty,‚Äù he says, without waiting for permission. He grabs my wrist with his giant, calloused hand and brings my arm up to his face, inspecting the watch like he‚Äôs peering into the soul of the universe.

At this point, I‚Äôm trying to pull my wrist back, but his grip is like a vice. He doesn‚Äôt even blink as he stares at the watch, muttering to himself, ‚ÄúHmm, sapphire crystal‚Ä¶ brushed stainless steel‚Ä¶‚Äù

And then‚Äîwithout warning‚Äîhe whips out a massive* jeweler‚Äôs loupe* from his back pocket. I don‚Äôt know why he‚Äôs carrying it, or how it even fits in his pocket, but suddenly he‚Äôs pressed this giant magnifying glass to his eye, and he‚Äôs leaning in so close to the watch that I can feel his breath on my wrist.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs strange,‚Äù he says, his tone suddenly serious. ‚ÄúThis looks... off.‚Äù

I‚Äôm sweating. ‚ÄúOff how?‚Äù

He grunts. ‚ÄúHang on.‚Äù And then, like something out of a fever dream, he takes a deep breath, closes his eyes, and‚Äîwait for it‚Äîlicks the watch.

Yes, LICKS it. Full-on, tongue-out, saliva-on-the-bezel, LICKING my Rolex.

The caf√© goes dead silent. People have stopped mid-sip, forks frozen halfway to their mouths. A barista near the counter drops a glass. I hear someone audibly gasp from the back. One guy whispers to his friend, ‚ÄúDid he just... lick his watch?‚Äù

I‚Äôm too shocked to speak. Frozen. Staring at this giant man in disbelief as he pulls back, smacking his lips like he‚Äôs just tasted a fine wine. He nods slowly, as if he‚Äôs just confirmed something.

‚ÄúYep,‚Äù he says, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. ‚ÄúDefinitely fake. I can taste it.‚Äù

The silence is unbearable. I‚Äôm looking around, and I swear every single person in the caf√© is now staring directly at me. The girl at the next table whispers to her friend, ‚ÄúWhat kind of lunatic tastes watches?!‚Äù Another guy, holding his cappuccino, mutters, ‚ÄúMate, I‚Äôve seen it all now.‚Äù

I‚Äôm speechless, my brain desperately trying to comprehend what‚Äôs just happened. Did this man really just taste-test my watch? In a caf√©?

I try to protest. ‚ÄúMate, you can‚Äôt be serious. You can‚Äôt tell by tasting it.‚Äù

He leans back, giving me a pitying look like I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs lost the plot. ‚ÄúNah, trust me, mate. I‚Äôve been licking watches for 15 years. You can always tell a fake by the taste.‚Äù

Someone from the back blurts out, ‚ÄúIs this some kind of weird London thing? I‚Äôve lived here for years, never seen that!‚Äù

As if that wasn‚Äôt insane enough, he proceeds to pull out his own Rolex, which is basically the size of a dinner plate strapped to his wrist. ‚ÄúHere, give this one a try,‚Äù he says, pushing it across the table toward me.

Before I can refuse, he grabs my hand, pulls it toward his watch, and waits. He‚Äôs staring at me expectantly, like it‚Äôs the most normal thing in the world.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ you want me to lick your watch?‚Äù

He nods, dead serious. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the only way, mate.‚Äù

I glance around the caf√©. One guy is filming the whole thing, and the barista in the corner is practically choking on laughter. I swear someone‚Äôs betting on whether I‚Äôll actually do it.

Now, I don‚Äôt know what came over me, but in that moment, with his intense eyes on me and the entire caf√© watching like we‚Äôre performing some kind of bizarre ritual, I lean in and‚Äîyeah‚ÄîI give his Rolex a tiny lick.

He smiles, all satisfied. ‚ÄúNow, that‚Äôs the taste of a genuine article.‚Äù

At this point, I‚Äôm mortified. My coffee‚Äôs cold, I‚Äôve just licked a random man‚Äôs watch, and I‚Äôm wondering if I need to rethink my entire life. He stands up, towering over me, pats me on the back like we‚Äôve just shared a deep, bonding experience, and says, ‚ÄúGood on ya, mate. If you ever need help identifying fakes, you know where to find me.‚Äù

With that, he walks out of the caf√©, leaving me sitting there, staring at my watch, wondering if I‚Äôve just hallucinated the whole thing. The guy filming bursts out laughing, and from the back, someone shouts, ‚ÄúOnly in London!‚Äù



So, consider this a warning to anyone out there thinking of flexing a fake in public‚Äîespecially in London. You never know when a giant man with a loupe and a taste for timepieces might be lurking nearby, ready to call you out in the most ridiculous way possible.

The way things are organised in Japan for your personal convenience and privacy should be universal in concept.

Since I've been coming more into an office environment as of late, people who are disagreeable and have a lot of toxic masculinity and something to prove have entered the frame.

One of such demanded that I introduce myself while he is giving info to a group about the new machines for production.

I was sitting behind a monitor screen that was elevated and made sure no one could bother me as I was reading on the notes.

This instructur demanded I lower the monitor screen, which was at a perfect ergonomic height, and introduce myself. He said he doesn't care it doesn't bother me but it bother him.

This type of directness already set the tone.

An awkward antagonistic mood fills the room .

I was going to leave the place as I don't do introductions and tell about myself among people I don't know.

So I did a fake introduction. Telling superficial crap that wasn't true. I already knew he was going to be put into another department if I would report this to the manager. 

However I would have rather said directly that I don't do introductions and only if it's spontaneous and not arranged with barbaric pressuring.

So should I next time and what if it comes to a stand-off. Some people are not from the same city and try to put you on the spot not knowing the local culture. 

It was a big faux pas as the right way to apprehend this is saying that's all right you can introduce yourself when you're ready at coffee for example.

I was not in the mood to talk about myself and what I do.

This is personal distance to your integrity as a human. If anyone wants to test your boundaries would it be best to opt for passive aggression or direct confrontation for the experts in sociology. ",3,1729270367.0,introvert,0,1.0,False

There was a reply earlier today about ""Super Dave"". The guy who knows every system in the company inside and out and how it's painful to be that guy

I'd also like to propose that there's a ""Cool James"" who can be massively overlooked and undervalued.

James may or may not have Dave's pure technical skill but he knows enough to be competent. Ideally he's your Scrum Master but he's just as likely to be one of the regular engineers or maybe he could even be the same person as ""Super Dave"". James knows the magic words and to whom they should be spoken to in order to open up the giant red door made from red tape that's blocking your progress.

He's built up relationships with coworkers and contractors all around the company, has earned their trust and knows he can come to them for favours in the same way that they know they can come to him with their needs.

Especially in larger, older orgs figuring out how to get something done in a timely manner that doesn't entirely conform to the standards or that requires multiple teams to work together can be a nightmare to navigate. Need to set up a server in the test environment that has to be reachable from an external site for a PoC?

* *Well, first you need to get the guys from security to sign off on it so you don't run into trouble halfway through the PoC when they notice the network traffic. Get their approval in writing and double check it. Kevin has a tendency to ""forget"" stuff he approved for our team because our PO embarrassed him during the last beer drinking contest.*
 
* *After that you create a ticket in Jira for the Cloud-Ops guys with these specific tags so it gets routed to the correct team immediately, without getting sent back and forth between two different, unrelated teams.*
 
* *Oh and remember to explicitly write into the ticket that they have to add the server to this domain and to add the proper access groups from that domain as well so you can actually remote into it. If you can, tag Mark in that ticket because he's the only one in the Cloud-Ops team who actually knows what he's doing and they'll end up asking him anyway.*
* *As soon as it's been deployed you gotta get the VPN and the firewall rules configured. So create a service request with the network team by emailing this shared mailbox with a seemingly random email address and include an excel file using this specific template from 2003. And for the love of the Omnissiah do not deviate from the template. Half of it seems redundant to fill out but if you don't, the entire thing will take three moths to get done properly.*

All of this institutional knowledge is crucial to have things run smoothly. Mishandle a single step and suddenly the project is overshooting deadlines by months or worse, gets shut down because it wasn't compliant with some requirement.

This is harder to learn and mostly just comes through experience. The basic process is probably documented somewhere but if you need only miniscule changes to the default you'll end up running from department to department trying to figure out how to actually get the things you want.

It's also important to know the right people and be in at least somewhat good standing with them. Being able to speed up processes or who to ask when you need a specific question answered is invaluable. Not to mention knowing who you should NOT speak to if you want an actual competent answer or solution.

I've seen too many teams, filled with excellent devs, complain about how they can't get anything done because they were unwilling to do anything that wasn't coding and always pawed off that stuff to Cool James, who then got let go during the last budget cuts and took all that knowledge with him. And suddenly their changes no longer get approved because they never bothered to learn how to fill them out properly. Their requests take three times as long to get answered because nobody knows who to actually send it to and other teams won't do more than the bare minimum for them because they've never even had a friendly chat over a cup of coffee.",8,1729270329.0,sysadmin,5,0.68,False

Last evening, after wrapping up my deadline, I went to the kitchen for some coffee.¬† I have a side door from my study that leads into a weird little hall where I can go through the pantry.¬† Just as I was about to push through the swinging door, I noticed Jon and PJ through the window, sitting at the table.¬† So I paused for a second to listen to their conversation (don‚Äôt judge me).

It was a moment when I wished that I had a camera in my hand, the way Suzie always did.¬†

Jon was coaching PJ‚Äôs speech.

PJ‚Äôs lisp is far improved from what it was, though still evident; especially when he‚Äôs tired.¬† He was three or four when we brought him to a speech therapist, and he‚Äôs had some coaching over the years. ¬†But I still remember Suzie asking, ‚ÄúDo we have to fix it?‚Äù¬† Everyone in the room chuckled because they understood her question.¬† You see, his lisp has only added to his charm.

It's become something of an issue because he hasn‚Äôt transitioned out of it naturally, the way most kids do, usually by age 7.¬† We‚Äôve ensured that there are no underlying concerns, no anatomical or dental maladies or developmental glitches ‚Äì it just is what it is.¬† After his last appointment, the prescription was to keep practicing his exercises.¬† Enter Big-Jon.

Jon huffed out a sigh.¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wearing out the back of your teeth, PJ!‚Äù

[Scene opens in an old castle] 


[SFX: The Listener preparing for bed / a subtle shift of a dagger] 


[You are preparing for bed, late one night, when you feel something is amiss in the room. The sound of a dagger sliding free barely hits you before you feel someone grab you from behind and press a blade to your neck] 


[SFX: The above, with an elevated heart beat] 


[The stranger whispers calmy in your ear] 


‚ÄúShh‚Ä¶ It will be over soon.‚Äù 


[. . . ] 


[He keeps you flush to him, breath calm, despite the tension] 


[C] ‚ÄúShh‚Ä¶ If you panic, you will force me to respond before I am ready‚Ä¶‚Äù 


[. . . ?] 


[C] ‚Äú...If that is true, why have I not responded already? I am‚Ä¶ unsure. I‚Äôve never had my body reject my task so violently before, truth be told‚Ä¶‚Äù 


[His cool breath tickles your ear as he holds you, one hand over your mouth and the other around your neck] 


[C] ‚Äú...how soft and fragile your neck is‚Ä¶ The thrum of life in your veins, surging oh-so-violently, like a bird desperate to escape a house cat. I could make a simple indent, oh‚Ä¶ here-‚Äù. 


[His thumb taps a spot on your neck] 


[C] ‚Äú-and, well, you‚Äôd be dead in an instant. Painlessly, no time to think‚Ä¶ I save that technique for clients I like, but I‚Äôm not out of practice‚Ä¶‚Äù 


[...Pause?] 


[C, amused] ‚ÄúMay you ask a question‚Ä¶? Oh, why not? But, my lady‚Ä¶ no getting angry with me if I come to my senses before I finish answering.‚Äù 


[...Pause?] 


[C] ‚ÄúWho requested your murder‚Ä¶? Mmh, well, that is interesting, isn‚Äôt it? Wondering, ‚ÄòWho could hate me so much they‚Äôd pay to have me killed?‚Äô... Who, indeed‚Ä¶ I think you know, at least partially‚Ä¶‚Äù 


[He moves his hand from your throat with a confidence that‚Äôs outright bewildering] 


[C] ‚ÄúIf I just take my hand off your neck and bring it down to this bare little shoulder here‚Ä¶ Oh‚Ä¶? How curious that a noble daughter would bare so many scars on her arms and legs and, well‚Ä¶ as much as I am curious, I try to remain at least somewhat gentlemanly, you know?‚Äù 


[...] 


[C] ‚ÄúSomeone in your family, yes‚Ä¶ Very good. But so many people push you around, don‚Äôt they? Your father is apathetic, at least, but his wife and your stepbrothers? Certainly worthy of a side-eye‚Ä¶ You are a noble woman though, you know. Who is to say some other noble didn‚Äôt hire me to cripple your family?‚Äù 


[. . .] 


[C] ‚ÄúOhh‚Ä¶ You say that your death would make no difference, but you are mistaken.‚Äù 


[Pause‚Ä¶?] 


[He‚Äôs an oddly affectionate assassin‚Ä¶] 


[C] ‚ÄúI mean it, my lady. A good assassin studies his mark before he kills them. A *great* assassin obsesses over them. Memorizes their schedules, likes, dislikes, how to talk to them‚Ä¶ every single thing that we need to complete our contracts. I got to know you from afar for months, nearly an entire year, because of the complexity of this job. One wrong move and, well‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd be food for your hunting dogs, I think.‚Äù 


[Pause‚Ä¶] 


[C] ‚ÄúDarling, please‚Ä¶ You are no burden to this kingdom nor its people. What you are is a kindhearted spirit, completely burnt out from shouldering the emotional needs of her people, while being partially blind, and constantly being the punching bag for incompetent oafs. Your father has committed the sin so many men who remarry do‚Ä¶ he forgot about you to assuage his guilt. The rest is just evil stepmother nonsense‚Ä¶‚Äù 


[...Pause?] 


[He hesitates, which seems to startle him as much as it does you] 


[C] ‚Äú...I wasn‚Äôt meant to say-‚Äù. 


[Pause.] 


[He pauses again, curious] 


[C] ‚ÄúWould I consider a deal‚Ä¶? What sort of deal would you request of this Crow, my lady?‚Äù 


[Pause‚Ä¶] 


[You turn to him and the sudden confrontation seems to startle him. He‚Äôs not used to not being in control] 


[C] ‚Äú...My Lady?‚Äù 


[Pause‚Ä¶] 


[He ponders your words] 


[C] ‚ÄúWere you to promise me a greater payment‚Ä¶ Might I consider betraying my patron and taking their life instead‚Ä¶?‚Äù 


[Pause‚Ä¶] 


[He ponders this in the shadows, obscured save for his glinting eyes in the blackness] 


[C] ‚Äú...A Crow is bound by law, as odd as that seems. To hire us to take a life is to take Death‚Äôs work from him and quite gratefully so‚Ä¶ There is only one price one could offer my kind in order for us to turn our blades on our patron. To break our anathema‚Ä¶‚Äù 


[Pause?] 


[C] ‚Äú...No. Fame. Fortune. Riches‚Ä¶ Drink, drug, food‚Ä¶ All of it is pointless to something of my ilk. But something you can offer me is something I cannot acquire elsewhere, from anyone or thing else. If you can offer me this thing, then my blade shall turn from your flesh and toward the person who hired me.‚Äù 


[Pause?] 


[C] ‚ÄúThe price I ask‚Ä¶ is marriage.‚Äù 


[. . . ?] 


[C] ‚ÄúYes. To you. A Crow can take a mate without trouble, but to turn his blade on any that has earned his black heart is considered the ultimate crime. I would be put to Death himself, eternal torment, were I to betray my promise so.‚Äù 


[. . . ] 


[C] ‚ÄúYou hesitate‚Ä¶ Because you cannot see me, nor what I look like. You ponder how you will explain away marriage to some sort of demon or beast‚Ä¶ You ponder if people will have you beheaded for such a marriage‚Ä¶ But, my Lady, consider this - where the frail humans may falter in their loyalty, my kind does not. We are loyal to those that care for us, more so than even the most loyal of bloodhounds. You may lose some humanity‚Ä¶ but your Crows will be with you, eternally.‚Äù 


[Pause‚Ä¶?] 


[C] ‚Äú...You ask what I am‚Ä¶ I wish I could tell you, my Lady. Truly‚Ä¶ The dagger trembles in my hand‚Ä¶ It must know blood, but the thought of striking you down‚Ä¶ I dislike it. You have only been warm and reasonable‚Ä¶‚Äù 


[. . . ] 


[SFX: The Listener taking a few steps closer / him, a few steps back in tandem] 



[C] ‚Äú...Please do not look too closely upon me‚Ä¶ You will find it impossible to look away if‚Ä¶‚Äù 


[The moonlight fills in some of his details. He is beautiful, beyond what a human can accomplish, but the red of his eyes paralyzes you in place] 


[P-Pause‚Ä¶] 


[C] ‚Äú...Vampire‚Ä¶? I do not know this word.‚Äù 


[P-Pause‚Ä¶] 


[C] ‚Äú...Here. Let me shut your eyes for you, before the paralyzing effect my gaze has takes full effect.‚Äù 


[SFX: Him gently shutting the Listener‚Äôs eyes] 


[C] ‚ÄúThere we are‚Ä¶‚Äù 


[SFX: A pounding at the door] 


[A furious pounding at the door jolts you both, you moreso. The guards shout from the other side] 


[G] ‚ÄúMy lady?! My lady, please respond!!‚Äù 


[C] ‚Äú...Our time is at an end, it seems‚Ä¶ What shall it be, my Lady? Will they find you dead when they open the door, or‚Ä¶?‚Äù 


[. . . ] 


[Pause-Fill with ambiance to create uncertainty / tension] 


[SFX: The door opening] 


[The guards all jump as you open the door calmly] 


[G] ‚ÄúMy Lady! Are you alright?!‚Äù 


[Pause‚Ä¶] 


[G] ‚ÄúWe thought we heard a commotion‚Ä¶ There were reports of strange shadows, and we thought-‚Äù. 


[SFX: A distant, bloody female scream] 


[The guards all gasp and race off as you hear your stepmother shriek bloody murder from down the hall‚Ä¶ somewhat literally] 


[G] ‚ÄúThe Duchess! Men, move! My Lady, lock your door! We‚Äôll let you know the second the danger has passed!‚Äù 


[Pause‚Ä¶] 


[SFX: Fade out on the door slowly shutting] 


[You shut the door, acting the part of a concerned stepdaughter. In reality, you admire the ring on your finger now, hidden against your palm]

A [pink noise ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_noise#)is the signal resulting from the superposition of cosines whose amplitude is the inverse function of their frequency. Basically, an example of pink noise would be the signal S(x)=1\*cos(x/1+a)+2\*cos(x/2+b)+4\*cos(x/4+c)+8\*cos(x/8+d)... where a, b, c, d, ... are latencies. Such signal interpreted as audio sounds like [this](http://gget.it/ghg0x5ny/pink.mp3).

A [white noise ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise)on the other hand is a signal where all frequencies have the same amplitude: S(x)=3\*cos(x/1+a)+3\*cos(x/2+b)+3\*cos(x/4+b)+... It sounds like [that](http://gget.it/9dvvb9h1/white.mp3).

A [red noise ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_noise)(Brownian noise) it the same as a pink noise, except that cosines amplitudes are an inverse function of the squared frequency. It sounds like [this](http://gget.it/py1uzpmi/brown.mp3).

Those are opposed to less noisy signals, where one cosine would have more amplitude than others. For instance S(x)=1\*cos(x/1+a)+1000\*cos(x/2+b)+2\*cos(x/4+c) is a signal that has a strong periodicity, with a cycle that repeats with a period of 4. It sounds like actual music, voice, or anything meaningful to you.

So I wanted to see whether such cyclic patterns are present in market prices fluctuations. Ran my fast Fourier transform to get the spectrum, plot it, and it turns out that most markets over the last 3 years (interval H1) behave pretty much exactly as would a pink noise. Below is the plot I got for the S&P500 over the last 3 years (well it's US500 as I'm using futures, but still pretty much the same).

There are several points in the middle-plot, because I used a sliding windows of length 365 days to check whether some of the frequencies would consistently appear in the spectrum -they do not.

So, bad luck for people looking for cycles, there are none. Well, there are, fractal ones, which results in what this graph shows: noise. Profiting off the market in this way would mean to consistently exploit the small deviations of this spectrum from the aforementioned power-law.

I did the same considering only the hourly returns, to see whether something cyclical was going on there, and ended up finding a white noise (constant spectrum over all frequencies).

So, (indices and forex) markets seem to be a lot of noise, but we knew that already. Simply, here is yet another proof of it. It doesn't mean you cannot profit from it. Noise in this sense means there are no predictible cycles ; prices will not always go up before xmas, or drop at the end of a quarter.

Now, what's the point of this? Well, this kind of noise is pretty well studied and has some nice mathematical properties that have been layed down on papers for you. For instance, you can put a probability for this ot that move to be happening under a pink noise assumption, and use it to close a position, or simply to place your stop losses beforehand. You can use it to generate synthetic data to test your strategies and compare to your real data to find whether you actually spot an inefficiency or you just got lucky. If the market seems to deviate from the pink-noise behaviour, you can be pretty sure in the end it will return to it: how would that translate in terms of price action?

I'd be glad to read your other suggestions on how to use it, remarks and also caveheats of such analysis!

# Multilingual speakers have a unique charm‚Äînot just because of the convenience their skills offer, but because their worldview and way of thinking are often more expansive. Learning diverse languages like French, Chinese, Arabic, and Russian can broaden your mind. It makes you wonder: could mastering several languages actually make us smarter, or even give us a heightened sense of awareness, like in the movie Arriva

# That‚Äôs why we created VocaPal, an app designed to immerse you in a multilingual environment with the help of AI technology. The name ‚ÄúVocaPal‚Äù comes from ‚Äúvocabulary‚Äù and ‚Äúpal,‚Äù emphasizing that it‚Äôs more of a friendly companion than a traditional teacher.

# We‚Äôve worked hard to make the experience as natural as possible‚Äîjust talk to VocaPal as you would to a real person. If you‚Äôre curious, you can even explore VocaPal‚Äôs ‚Äúbrain,‚Äù which is actually the AI‚Äôs memory of your conversations. You can view and edit these memories, customizing your experience.

So I've been using this laptop since 2019(y540-15irh 2060rtx 6gb + i5 9300h). It's been a good ride but I'm not sure if I should upgrade it right now or not. I'm playing only League(Lol) and I was thinking into getting a new laptop/PC for my gaming sessions. This laptop, sometimes in my sessions, is frame dropping and I'm not quite sure why is that happening. League is a CPU game, my gpu is never feeling overwhelmed IMO. Whenever I start new programs its dropping frames by quite a bit ( like a third party app/discord ). I did optimize settings from the game, nvidia and set up the lenovo app as of recently. All benefited me 20-30 frames extra at least. But i still can't keep 144 constant ( my monitor  is locked at 144hz).

Now the main issue comes. I want to start streaming, haven't upgraded my setup yet because I'm not sure If i upgrade it.. (as if I'd upgrade this setup only for the streaming part, I live in Romania, where average wage is like 800E, and don't wanna spend 2 months of salary for a setup I won't even use).

Not planning to play any other games really, just streaming on youtube/tiktok/twitch with league, as I always loved it but never had the courage. I'm 21 now in uni, and I'd like to try that ""path"" aswell in my spare time.

Back to the point, I'm afraid streaming may not work and I have more important financial responsabilities in life right now than a gaming pc that I don't even need!

My question is, do you think I could stream league with no issues on this laptop? Considering my specs, etc..

If not, what upgrades would you add? (even laptop-wise)..(e.g extra ram).

Will leave some photos from the Hwinfo RUN while playing 1 game of League, so you can see maybe something I'm not even understanding :D

Btw ,because of temps on the CPU, I will dust-clean it this week-end ( haven't cleaned since December 2023), will re-apply thermal paste. Was thinking about getting a new cooling pad as mine isn't working anymore and I use it as a ""stand"" ( for better air-flow, I assume :>> hehe, check photo) + if nothing cools the laptop down, maybe undervolt the cPU?

Any opinions, ideas, or thought are more than welcome. I appreciate taking the time! : )

A leather purse has to be the most versatile accessory ever. It is a perfect choice if you want to go out for a party, run errands, or casually dress up. But choosing which purse to choose for which occasion is the catch.¬†

Let us explore the types of leather purses you can pair with our outfits on different occasions and how you can make a perfect selection.  


**How to select a bag: Based on type** 

First, let us understand the types of leather bags you can opt for.¬†

**1. Tote bags**¬†

[Tote bags](https://www.fabricakraft.com/products/cloud-sunbrella-tote) are open-top bags; they usually do not have a zipper. They are perfect for everyday use, such as running errands, brunch, and going for coffee. Choose the size as per your need.¬†

**2. Crossbody bags**¬†

[Crossbody bags ](https://www.fabricakraft.com/products/mandala-muse-circle-crossbody)can be helpful in multiple situations, like casual outings, running errands, or grabbing a cup of coffee. It is an ideal choice if you want to keep your hands free during these chores.¬†

**3. Clutch bags**¬†

These bags are perfect for any special occasion. These are hand-held and look perfect for any function or dinner date.¬†

**4. Satchels**¬†

These bags have a strap attached for you to hang around the shoulder. Also, they have a handle at the top to hold it. They come in different sizes and patterns and are ideal for everyday use and work.¬†

**How to select a bag: Based on Occasion**¬†

**1. Work and business meetings**

The tote bag is a strong competitor for business meetings and work because of its size. As per your requirement, select your bag's size and color. It would help to look for a bag that will accommodate your laptop and all the essentials.¬†

**2. Outings and shopping**¬†

If you plan to buy a leather bag for such occasions, we suggest a crossbody bag or a shoulder bag. You can buy these bags in trendy colors that will help elevate your outfit in no time.¬†

**3. Parties**

For a dressier look, I prefer a [clutch or embellished bag](https://www.fabricakraft.com/products/emerald-etchings-carved-clutch). This will complement your party outfit.¬†

**4. Traveling**¬†

You need to ensure that you're comfortable while traveling. This is why you should carry a sturdy backpack, which ensures you have all your belongings and essentials while comfortably carrying it around. We recommend not investing in a leather backpack, as they can be a little heavy.¬†

**5. Formal occasions**¬†

If you are attending a gala, wedding, or any other formal event, you must have a clutch or purse made from a premium cloth like satin or silk. This will adorn your outfit and give you a chic look.¬†

**How to select a bag- based on qualities**¬†

Once you have figured out the occasion and type of bag you're interested in, we are here to give some points to remember before purchasing.¬†

**1. Quality of leather**¬†

If you're investing in a leather bag, ensure superior quality. It is a crucial factor in determining the bag's longevity and durability. You must select a bag with a smooth surface and natural grain, a sign of good quality leather. You may invest only once in a leather bag, but ensure you invest well.¬†

**2. Style and color**¬†

The style and color should match your style. You must check the color you wear often and the bag style you carry; this will help you decide.¬†

**3. Size and shape**¬†

The size and shape of your bag should be functional for you as per the occasion. Before buying, you must consider the purpose of your bag.

**4. Budget**¬†

A leather bag can cost from a few dollars to hundreds of dollars. But keep in mind that these bags are an investment. A high-quality purse will last years and is worth the investment.¬† 

**5. Body type**¬†

Your body type will also determine if a bag is suting you. For instance, a huge bag can look overpowering if you have a petite figure, and a small bag can look dull if you have a good height. So, consider your height, weight, and body structure before purchasing any bag.¬†

**6. Hardware and closure**¬†

The hardware and closure elements play a huge role in the functioning of a bag. So, if you invest in a leather bag, ensure the zipper is high quality. Also, the buckles are built out of sturdy materials. These elements also contribute to the longevity and durability of your bag.¬†

Now, if you have decided which bag you must buy, you should also follow the steps to take care of your leather bag. A leather bag requires proper care and maintenance, so always follow the manufacturer's instructions for your bag to last years. Invest in some good quality leather cleaners and avoid using harsh chemicals altogether.¬†

You can also condition the leather to prevent it from breaking. Keep these factors in mind, and your bag will remain beautiful and supple over the years.¬†

1g6mi2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1g6mi2x/i_think_im_undatable/,I think im undatable,"This is going to be a long one but here i go. So i think i might be ment to be single for life as every time i dip my toes into dating it goes horribly.

Im on 3 different dating apps and i honestly hate them despite the fact i keep using them. I get a maybe a match every other week if i use the apps every day and 80-90% of the time the following happens. We exchange ""how are yous"" and I make some small talk and try to get to know her and after 3-4 responses i get ghosted. Many times when they do respond in the first place i have to be the one to show all the interest while they can give short responses and never ask my anything. Is this a normal experience to have as a guy on these apps?

Beyond apps there have been only 3 girls i have gone out with at least once over the past 3 or so years.

Girl 1 was a tinder match and went to my college. She was busy a lot of the time so we ended up mostly texting. We did go on one date and things seemed to be going well but her responses got slower, eventually getting to the point she would take 2-3 days to answer a simple yes or no question. I broke things off with her as i didnt see things going anywhere.

Girl 2 worked at coffee place i frequent and she wrote her number on my recipt one day. We texted then went out about a week later. Things went good and about 1.5 weeks after that she invited me to her dorm room and we talked for a while. She was really talkitive and i was ok with this, im shy but i made an effort to talk back and add things because i really liked here tbh. A few days after this she said suddenly she isnt interested in me anymore. I was sad and asked why and if i did something wrong and she said i was ""dull and boring in person"". I broke contact with her after this and im still confused on how i should feel. She was talking the ENTIRE time i was in her dorm room, idk what she expected me to do beyond me adding and responding to what she was saying like i did.

Girl 3 i matched with on bumble the past summer. I really liked her and we saw a movie together. After the movie she drops a bombshell that she is going away and wont be able to go out for a few months. I didnt think things would work out due to this since we had just started talking so i broke things off. A few months later she messaged me again and said she was back so we started talking again. I invited her to my dorm to stay the night and all was going well till, out of nowhere, at arround 1am she said she hates in my dorm and wants to go home. Mind you i told her i had class the next morning, it just rained, and she lived 40 mins away in the middle of some really windy backroads. She didnt have a liscence so i had to make the 1.5 hour drive and got back at arround 3am. I was willing to let it go at first but after some thinking i realized just how shitty this was of her and, after a comment she made about me i was not a fan of a few days later,  i told her im done.

My experiences with dating have left me drained and it seems like im doing something wrong or im just repulsive since this keeps happening. Is the happiness of having a partner really worth all this bs to get to that point? Any idea what if anything im doing wrong? Ive considered asking out girls in real life but it seems creepy to me and im not sure if id ever be able to figure out how to, the few times ive tried i think i messed up the timing or something as i felt like a creep due to their reactions.",1,1729269358.0,dating,2,1.0,False

I think he is in pain and sick, and that this is a phase where he is going to require more help than he would normally and more chores will fall on me. I try to get these tasks done as efficiently as possible, including having the housekeeper come over to do cleaning when I feel overwhelmed. I don‚Äôt enjoy doing these tasks but I get that he needs help and I am not blaming him for being sick or in need of help. I do get frustrated when he tries to micromanage how I handle various tasks, and have asked him to stop giving unsolicited feedback. 

I very much am practical about the situation: he needs help and I am helping, but I don‚Äôt think it means I have to be cheerful about it all the time. It‚Äôs work and it detracts from the amount of work I can accomplish for my own stuff during the day. 

For him, the fact that I‚Äôm not like cheerfully helping seems to be a really big issue. He seems to be conflating practical tasks with an expression of love. This morning, he was upset that I got myself food (cereal and coffee), before I made food for him. I didn‚Äôt know he hadn‚Äôt eaten. 

He then was also upset that when we were hanging out last night I was on my phone for part of the time. 

For me, this reeks an unhealthy perspective on what a relationship is and feels kind of gendered. I have tried to express this in totally dispassionate terms to him and how it makes me feel and that I understand he‚Äôs in pain, but he can‚Äôt talk about it rationally imho. 

AITA? And if I am, how do I keep managing this and my sanity?",4,1729269153.0,AmItheAsshole,15,1.0,False
1g6mex5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g6mex5/asking_for_more_money/,ASKING FOR MORE MONEY,"So I (24m) was living with my best friend since high school and her bf because they wanted me to move closer and I was wanting to move closer to them as well since I was there at least twice a week and live about 2 hours away. I was planning on moving to their city but got fired from my job and didn‚Äôt think I would be able to, they invited me to stay with them till I found a job and got a place. We had a vacation planned a week after I got fired. The day I got fired they said I should move in to make things easier while I found a job in their area. This happens the start of September. I knew the bf wasn‚Äôt the biggest fan of me staying there, but didn‚Äôt say anything about it and told me to my face that he was okay with it and understood my situation and wanted to help. But I always tried to be extra nice to him and made sure he knew me and his gf were only friends and have been since high school (we never once had anything romantic and I see her as sister). Everything was going good till after we got back from the vacation which was the third week in September. My friend was switching jobs and had a week break before she started her new job and she was at home this week. They had a little spare bedroom they let me stay in and I stayed in that room the majority of the time trying to get a job and wasn‚Äôt having the best of luck. When she was home we talked a little while she did things around the house and she asked me to grab coffee with her and go to the gym. I didn‚Äôt think anything of this. But later that week her bf stared to become will hostel with me, wouldn‚Äôt talk to me and gave me bad looks, whenever I came out of the room. I kinda thought it was because my best friend was at home while he was working and there was another guy there. I get that and I started talking to my friend less while she was at home and trying to give them more time to themselves when they were both at home. This was about 2 and a half weeks of me staying with them and one of those weeks we were on a vacation. The start of the third week there I got a job with an insurance agency and my friend started her job so she wasn‚Äôt at home now and her bf started talking to me again, I had to get my licensing and pass the exam to actually start this job and getting paid. I told them this and they were excited that I got a job. Also when I first moved in they said that I wouldn‚Äôt even have to pay and if I did it would only have to be $300. I paid them $500 the first week because I was thankful they were helping me. The third week I paid them another $300 cause I didn‚Äôt want her bf thinking I was staying there for free or anything. My friend was really understanding of my situation and really was the one who convinced me to move in, originally I didn‚Äôt want to cause I didn‚Äôt know my situation and didn‚Äôt want to put them in a weird place with me being there.  The week before they kicked me out my cat had to move in with me or I had to get rid of it. I talked to them about it and they said it was okay and everything was okay the first couple days and then my cat got into a fight with one of their cats. I felt really bad so I kept my cat locked on the room and paid them another $200 dollars for the inconvenience. The end of that week my friend had a conversation with me about how her bf was feeling about me being there and was ranting to me about relationship problems, I agreed with her on the points she was saying and told her that she should have a conversation with him about these things if they are bothering her that much (her bf can act immature at times and is very emotional, nothing bad about being emotional) but the immaturity thing was the biggest thing. He licks beer of of restraunt tables, obsess with poop jokes and hawk tuah jokes, which at times are funny but most of the time it‚Äôs too much. She told me that she wants him to act more mature and maybe in 10 years he‚Äôll be where she wants him at and I told her she shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúassume maturity‚Äù and should base things off an image she has of him in her head that‚Äôs currently not what he is. She also said that she‚Äôs not a fan of his mother and complains about how his mother treats her mother and she thinks he talks to his mom too much. I didn‚Äôt think much of this conversation because I thought it was just another rant. She has had a few conversations like this with me which I‚Äôve said the same thing each time. The night before they kicked me out get bf cat got into a fight with my cat, which ended up giving his cat an eye effect that wasn‚Äôt serious but still caused by my cat. I told them after the fight that I‚Äôll take my cat somewhere because I knew it wasn‚Äôt working out with him being there. She apologized to me and said she felt bad but understood that that will probably be the best. The next day her bf took the cat to the vet and she asked me to pay her bf $100 for the vet visit. I was a little frustrated just with getting rid of my cat and the situation with my exam and I told her that I wanted her bf to text me if he wanted money and stop having her talk for him. Her bf then sent me just a picture of his Venmo and I paid him. When they got home that evening, she was really stressed out and said that they will just stay in their room because it was a long day. I told them that I‚Äôll stay somewhere else so they can have the house to themselves cause I felt like my presence wasn‚Äôt wanted. Now I paid for my apartment I was originally living at for the month of September, and at the end of the month I wasn‚Äôt planning on paying for my next month but I felt like my situation was there and moving might not work out so I paid for my apartment for October just in case but I didn‚Äôt tell them that. The night the cats got into a fight again I went to that apartment cause that was the only place I could go. She has my location and that night she sent me a long upset text saying that she and her bf talk and said me staying there wouldn‚Äôt work out anymore and said I should just stay at the apartment that I have had this whole time and told me they put all my stuff outside the trailer except for my tv and expensive stuff. I ended up just picking everything up that night and they wouldn‚Äôt even talk or look at me when I did. They both stopped talking to me and even kicked me off of her Netflix which I‚Äôve been on for years. A week later, she texted me and said their electric bill was $100 more the month of September and I should help pay for it. I told them I thought my $800 that I gave them when they only asked for $300 should be enough to cover the rise of the bill for the month. Also they didn‚Äôt pay for anything for me while I was there. I cleaned there house even because I wanted them to know I appreciated them letting me stay there. Sorry for how long winded this was, but I just feel confused and lost. Felt like I lost two friend and they think I‚Äôve taken advantage of the situation. 

Also her bf didn‚Äôt have a job for 6 months and she found a job for him because he couldn‚Äôt find one. I feel like I paid them more than enough and don‚Äôt know what I did wrong except bringing my cat. 

Also she said that she was also upset because she felt like we were talking shit about her bf behind his back and instead of saying anything I should have just agreed with her and let her vent like her other friends and not try to give solutions.",3,1729269136.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

As I entered the job market I wanted to be able to ask people to get coffee with me, but this was peak Covid. 

So I developed a collapsible coffee brewer that I could send through the mail to people that I wanted to have conversations with. 

While developing the project I realized that a few large outdoor equipment companies have also attempted to create similar products, but none of theirs are as light or as compact as my design (or as easy to use, IMO). 

The design is patent pending, I would love to start pitching it to companies like MSR or Sno Peak to see if they‚Äôre interested - does anyone have any advice for this??

Also, would love feedback on the project!

1g6mdbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1g6mdbb/what_everyone_gets_wrong_about_putting_them_off/,What everyone gets wrong about putting them off the pedestal. ,"This may change the way you think so read with care. 

People don‚Äôt realize that when you fall in love with a person you also fall in love with their flaws. Everyone has flaws. You don‚Äôt fall in love with part of them but with all of them. So if you get out of the relationship and you try to convince yourself to see only those flaws would be lying to yourself. Trying to divide that person in small pieces so you can hate the pieces that you don‚Äôt like won‚Äôt work because that is not how emotions work. First of all because you are rationalizing emotions and trying to box them to your liking which brings to nothing, and second of all because you are trying to convert part of those emotions into something else. Hate maybe? Yes, of course this won‚Äôt work. Let every emotion good or bad flow into you. Don‚Äôt try to contrast it by trying to change how you feel about them. Don‚Äôt try to convince yourself that they are bad because you were in love with them nonetheless and your body knows it. Denying it is blocking the flow of energy and it will always backfire. Always.

And about putting people you love in pedestals. People get this all wrong. Putting someone you love in a pedestal is normal. It comes with the love package. You cannot avoid it. Every time love is involved you see the other person different from the other. It also happens with parents and their kids. A mother would never stop loving his child even if he turns out to be a murderer. Because it has nothing to do with his qualities or lack of. What people don‚Äôt get about this is that you putting them in the pedestal has nothing to do with them or their qualities but it has all to do with the time and resources you invested. YOUR BODY VALUES THAT. Emotions are costly. Physically speaking. And so everytime you have them your body is investing a hell a lot of energy and it‚Äôs resources for this person. And that is why they will always have such a great value even with their flaws. You can‚Äôt tell your body that they have no value because they did this or that. Because that is not how your body is measuring their value but by the time and resources invested.

So obviously trying to put them down from the pedestal by finding all their flaws doesn‚Äôt work. Because you are missing the point. It has nothing to do with the flaws. And this will only end up by making you frustrated because your body will keep reminding you that they were the right person for you based on how much it invested and not their qualities or lack of. You will again read their flaws and two hours later you still want to get back with them so badly. And the cycle continues. Even though it would be correct to call it a battle since you are practically having one with your body every time you do this.  

So how do you get out? First of all understand very clearly what I have just wrote. Let it sink. 

And then, Invest in yourself. Find things to do. Practice meditations. And please go out and talk to new people. I repeat, go and talk to new people. Check your diet. Work out. Sweat. Gaze at the sun. Plant your bare feet on the soil. Stop over consuming stimulants and give your nervous system a break i.e. coffee, alcohol, porn. Sleep. Sleep is the thing that is doing the healing. And stay away from social media and I would say from your phone as much as you can. Invest in every aspect of your being. Your body will eventually start seeing value in that and remove the value it has placed on them because now it feels better even without them. Your body doesn‚Äôt like wasting resources. It doesn‚Äôt like to use all that energy in feeling bad. But you have to give it something else to invest on. Otherwise it will keep on desiring the last thing it invested all it‚Äôs resources on. That is why investing in yourself is always a win. Always! 

Or you can write down a list of their flaws and keep reading it daily and see where that goes. 

Don‚Äôt try to trick you body people. Understand it‚Äôs mechanism and work with that. And when I say body I obviously also mean your mind because to me they are the same entity. ",9,1729269021.0,ExNoContact,1,0.92,False

(My nervous system's ""toxic positivity"")","This year has been a lot. At the beginning I was diagnosed. I had my gallbladder taken out shortly after (binge-eating is a big symptom of mine). Right after I recovered from surgery I moved, and right after I moved I had the worst work project of my career, and so I lived in a mess of an unorganized new home for months on end almost going insane with work before getting things together, and I guess I haven‚Äôt realized that this was probably not something I have fully recovered from even though several months have passed.

All during this I was processing being ADHD and hyper-fixating on it to learn more how to better manage myself while often doing the opposite out of burnout and being overwhelemd. Eventually I came to more embrace being AuDHD, as I saw ADHD as a more ‚Äúactionable‚Äù problem at first and am now still processing the even more confusing autism aspects of myself.

Too much has happened this year. I have had great moments playing live as a musician that filled me with hope and joy, other times where other musicians and such bothered me so much on gigs I had to suppress full autistic meltdown until I got home. I have become fully jaded with my day work in tech despite knowing I‚Äôm capable of truly enjoying what I do for that. I have had falling outs with friends and friend groups of different magnitudes and outcomes all year, become more connected to new people just to get frustratingly held at arms distance like usual without knowing exactly why, etc. Socially it‚Äôs been a nightmare for me and I‚Äôve just retreated from most people except the musicians I like that I at least routinely see to play with and get outside.

Recently I finally found the Zen or whatever you want to call it to stop these mental burdens from keeping me from doing what I do enjoy, and I have found through the complexity the urge to get back to basics and do the little simple things that give me satisfaction without worrying about the big picture, the way I want to pursue my interests and such in the first place anyway.

This week was the first week in many months where I have maintained a relatively healthy routine where I kept my stress low, exercised, not done self-destructive things, ate relatively well, kept up with my day work without having , practiced music more purely in a way where I‚Äôm not just stressed about getting stuff together for a future gig, etc. I‚Äôve had times in my life like this before but it‚Äôs been a while where I‚Äôve felt the ability to do it and feel like it‚Äôs coming from a real desire to do it.

That has felt amazing. It feels like I‚Äôm almost myself again in terms of the good side of me. However, I can feel the pendulum potentially swinging back as my enthusiasm in life can overwhelm me in its own way. When I‚Äôm doing poorly I often binge eat and smoke weed in the evening. When I don‚Äôt do that, I realized those have been my ‚Äúsleeping pills‚Äù for months. And my joy I get out of things keeps me up at night, I want to do everything that I didn‚Äôt feel like doing before.

I used to experience this in greater extremes when I was younger and much worse at managing myself, where I‚Äôd be a complete depressed wreck for weeks and then get one weekend day where the light of real hope in myself would shine, but when my brain would ‚Äúturn on‚Äù out of a depressed state the motivation and ideas and such would flood my conscious mind so much that I couldn‚Äôt even handle it. I was in the worst shape of my life by far but I remember going on a run when this would happen just to try to exhaust my suddenly overactive mind and body. I was crippled by my own motivation because too much would flood in at once, which makes sense now considering how much I‚Äôve realized I need to do to properly stimulate my mind and creative side, which has much better outlets than before.

I haven‚Äôt connected that what I‚Äôm experiencing now is like that but on a bigger scale. It‚Äôs good that it‚Äôs not as extreme and that I can actually exist with my ‚Äúlight side,‚Äù but when my enthusiastic nervous system keeps me from sleeping and such. It‚Äôs weird, I get this feeling like I‚Äôm hyped up on coffee or something even if I‚Äôm on nothing. I felt it last night and had to force myself to watch TV at 5 am to get to bed. Then I woke up in the monring feeling wired. This mood happens to me when I start to be healthy sometimes and I‚Äôm seeing how it can work against me simultaneously. I can trace it back to feelings of enthusiasm and joy though. I want to work on all my creative projects, get all the things done that I wasn‚Äôt in the mood for, but I know that actually doing so will eventualy ironically kill this state. That's what made me realize it's like my more extreme episodes described earlier, where either I couldn't do things because I was depressed or couldn't do things because I was overwhelmed by myself.

Have you dealt with this ‚Äúinternal toxic positivity‚Äù before? It‚Äôs like when I‚Äôm doing well I can do too well in certain aspects so that it starts disrupting my base needs, and then disrupting my base needs is the entry point to losing this joy altogether, which I don‚Äôt want to happen since nothing other than my own body and mind is triggering this. Do you find that you are able to smooth out this part of getting into a better mindset and routine?",3,1729268990.0,AutisticWithADHD,2,1.0,False

‚Ä¢	2 kids under 2

‚Ä¢	265lbs- lost 25lbs so far this year

‚Ä¢	Sleep apnea- have never been able to adjust to a CPAP but I use a custom oral appliance

‚Ä¢	Medications- Lisinopril, Vyvanse 30 MG, citalopram 20mg, asthma inhalers, metformin- first thing am and before dinner

‚Ä¢	Nicotine- I got through 2 cans of Zyn 3mgs 

‚Ä¢	Exercise- lift two days a week, HIIT 2 days a week, walk at least 8500 steps a day

‚Ä¢	Intermittent fast till noon Monday-Saturday. I like IF a lot, I am much more productive when fasted and helps to reduce calories

‚Ä¢	Diet is all over the place. Early in the weeks I am generally healthy but towards the end of the week I tend to binge on garbage



Here is an example of my typical day.



4-4:30am-  wake up feeling decent some days, sluggish others. 

4:45am- take my medications 

5:00am- workout- either lift or HIIT. After workout I feel fantastic 

8am- have a coffee and work. Good focus, good energy and I am quite productive. 

12pm- first meal of the day. 

2pm- I‚Äôm basically zapped. I slug through the rest of day with small bursts of energy and focus facilitated by coffee or diet coke 

5pm- leave work and get home to the family

6pm- dinner- no consistency on what I eat or if we are cooking or not

7-730pm- Put the kids to bed

8pm- I am in bed, watch tv till I fall asleep. I am usually asleep between 8-10pm 



I know some of the advice or recommendations will be obvious and that is welcomed. Getting hit over the head with the obvious truth will be helpful. But I am very interested in suggestions on medication timings, meal timing and diet.

I, like a lot of people nowadays, went into software development for the supposed ""easy money"". My passion was always game development, but I went into software because a broader qualification seemed like a better choice. But over the pandemic, I started disliking my program and technology as a whole. After 3 years, I got a diploma in software development. The reality of programming as a job began to dawn on me, and I started getting really depressed. In all honesty, I wanted to be an artist, but due to my condition precisely controlling a pen or a brush is difficult for me. When I was younger, I didn't think this was a factor I could overcome, so I went with my second choice, being game development. But over the years, I naturally lost interest in gaming. I still like the idea of developing games, but I also realized that I could still do art if I really worked at it. I never understood the concept of overcoming adversity well, but I began realizing it's the only way to progress in life. Despite my diploma, I could not find a job in the industry. I ended up working at a coffee shop for a while, but I didn't make enough to move out of my parents house. So I decided to to the optional overseas semester, despite my growing dislike for it. I mostly went because there aren't many opportunities to make connections outside of college. However, I'm struggling to get my work done, which is in turn hurting my ability to socialize. There's a part of me that wants to leave and explore my actual passions, but then I lose my opportunity to meet people. On the other hand, I have no desire to work because the material is so disinteresting. My final year project is doing a full litterary review and analysis of a concept and then developing it as a real application. But I can't bring myself to even start it. I just end up scrolling youtube until I get tired. I'm not even sure if I have enough time to catch up. Now I have an almost constant conflict in my head that makes it hard to tell what I actually want to do. One part of me says things like: ""You can find other social avenues"",""you should leave and try working on your art, you don't even have to succeed at it"", just try"",""You know programming doesn't make you happy"". But the other part is along the lines of: ""Your job shouldn't make you happy, that's what socialization is for"", ""You're not really creative, too much youtube put that in your head"", ""You actually like this subject, you're just too lazy and dont want to put the time in."", ""and even if you do hate it, you need to realize thats just life and grow the hell up"". I feel trapped between two trains of thought, neither of which are entirely right, but also not entirely wrong. I tried to do some of the project research this morning, but I just sat there staring at the screen trying not to cry. Decisions have never come easily to me, but I've been so stressed and conflicted recently that I can barely think. Emotionally, I want to take a few months and work on developing some artistic skill. Logically, I know what I want to do is irrelevant, and the Bacholers Degree will make me more employable. If I leave, I'd still have my qualification from my previous college, but a much lower chance of gaining significant employment. However, I could get a part time job and practice art in my free time. If I stay, I may still be able to catch up and finish my degree. But as short as it is, I'm not sure I can take 6 more months of what feels like dunking my soul in battery acid.

1g6m9vk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1g6m9vk/what_should_i_do_food_and_pills_getting_stuck_in/,What should I do? Food and pills getting stuck in my throat. ,"36 yo black female located in Georgia, USA. Potentially relevant info: I don't have a gallbladder. I take Vyvanse, Wellbutrin, lamictal, prasozin, and a birth control pill. I have endometriosis. The Vyvanse is for diagnosed ADHD. I often go all day without eating or eating very little. (I'm working on that.) I drink a lot of coffee some days. (Also working on that.) 

I have been consistently getting something stuck in my throat for the past three days. In the past, this has been an occasional issue that usually resolved after eating a piece of bread or taking a large gulp of water. Currently, however, each insident over the last few days has been persistent and stubborn AF. Tuesday, I'm unsure what sparked it, but it may have been a bite of a chicken biscuit. That lasted for several hours. It seemed to be getting better for a bit, but it may have been because I was distracted as it picked back up and continued well into the night. I eventually fell asleep. When I woke up, I was back to normal. 

Wednesday I was good all day, but I also didn't really eat much that I can remember if at all. That evening though, I got a burger and some fries. I ate the fries first and made it through the entire batch with no problem, but the very last one got stuck in my throat. Same thing as before, lasted forever but woke up fine. 

Last night, I was good all day. I did have a light breakfast/lunch. (Small pancake, some bacon, a big cup of coffee). I didn't eat anything else for several hours. Later that evening, I started feeling nauseous and kinda gross. I figured it was cause I hadn't eaten all day again, so I had dinner. My friend made some ravioli in a cream and tomato sauce. Not sure that this matters, but I also had what seemed like a really bad sinus headache so I took some Tylenol and sudafed before eating. After dinner, I started to feel even more gross. Still nauseous, lots of burping, felt really bloated, and overall miserable. I think there was a bit of acid reflux that happened and then once again, i felt like I had something stuck in my throat. After a few hours, I have in and took a Pepto bismal pill which was the worst fucking decision I've made in this entire week. It was stuck in my throat all. night. long. Nothing, and I mean nothing, would make this thing go down. I finally fell asleep around 5am with it still stuck. 

I woke up for work today around 8:15am, but I was so drowsy that I can't remember if the stuck feeling was still there from the night before. I do know that I took my morning meds then went back to sleep until they kicked in. And from the time I got up at 9ish and this very moment, there is still a pill stuck in my throat. 

I am at my wits end. I've tried so much. Bread. Large gulps of water. Small constant sips of water. Tuesday, so much water in a short amount of time that it was almost too much water. Chugging an entire can of soda. Honestly, I even tried to throw up but I can't make myself do anything beyond gag. I know something is there. I can feel it move around from one side of my throat to the other as I try to swallow it. It's occasionally painful, like something poking when it moves a certain way. It's in some purgatory where it feels like if it slips down just a bit, I might choke but I never do. Oh and I have been taking extra care to chew my food even more than I normally would and swallow even more carefully. I've never been a fast eater, so it's not like I've been inhaling my meals in 60 secs. 

I can breathe just fine. I'm not turning blue. I'm not wheezing. I'm just miserable, and my throat hurts. I also don't quite know what can be done. My PCP is booked until November. Should I go to urgent care/can they even do anything to resolve this? 

Sorry for the wall of text, but please help. üò≠üò≠üò≠ This feels like such a dumb thing to go to urgent care for if they can't even fix the problem. ",1,1729268775.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Typically, I usually get the same symptoms of scared, gloom and doom, losing control and just overall being worried and on edge. Some have gotten really bad to the point of near fainting and losing bodily and mental control. However, I experienced something yesterday that was incredibly alarming. I was feeling fine, and then out of nowhere, I started having strange memories and thoughts permeate my mind and I was near losing consciousness with reality. It was if these random memories that I had seen in a dream or had experienced in the past were trying to surface to the forefront of my thinking, but just before they arrived enough for me to understand what they were, I was unable to recognize or understand them. This lasted for close to 2 hours on an intense level where my heart rate increased by about 40 beats from resting, and my wife said that I was repeating myself a lot. Almost like I was drunk or out of touch with reality. I still managed to make dinner for the family the entire time this was going on, and I was fully aware of how disturbing and unnerving this experience was while it happened, so I don't think I completely lost consciousness at any point. But I must say that this was unlike any other experience I've had in a panic attack. It was almost like a Deja vu over and over again for 3 hours before it finally started to subside. I'm not sure if this is a symptom of panic or something else. I was really wired and tired after the experience, and I only got like 3 hours of sleep this last night. Thankfully I seem to be out of the attack, but I am drained and now everything seems very different to me today. Not the same person I was before this happened if that makes sense. I don't do recreational drugs, drink coffee or caffeine, take any supplements, or even smoke or drink alcohol. Could it have been something I ate or is this something you've heard about with a panic attack. 

  
I'm just curious if this is something I should be concerned with, or if this is indicative of a typical panic attack. I appreciate any feedback and thank you kindly in advance for reading and responding.",1,1729268649.0,PanicAttack,0,1.0,False
1g6m7vf,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1g6m7vf/get_chicory_closer_to_coffee/, Get chicory closer to coffee ? ,"Hi there coffee lovers,

Please forgive me for bringing the attention to this probably unloved, maybe hated, coffee alternative which is chicory.

But real coffee lovers will indulge me cause passion for coffee is often mixed with passion for experiments. And this is it.

I bought some pure roasted chicory and wanted to taste it while experimenting with it. And probably as many before, I've been disappointed... Like my dear sir Hoffman in this [video](https://youtu.be/KArQ3mBzWC4?si=hgGZKUyNNwmJEo_o).

Indeed, I tried a few times, with different chicory to water ratio (for 250ml of water, going from 8g to 20g of chicory) and I don't really like it BUT (very important point coming) how many of us tried coffee or wine for the first time AND DID NOT LIKE IT ? So I'm not giving up, I'm pretty convinced that like coffee or wine, it might be a getting-use-to-it flavor. Maybe what one needs is to give time to one roof of the mouth, or palais as we say in French ?

That being said, having experienced with coffee, I feel confident to say that just hot water and chicory will have a really hard time being as ""good"" as coffee. But first, let's state the obvious out of the way : Since chicory is not coffee, chicory will never taste like coffee. Having said that, while taste is taste, it's not everything there is to coffee or any beverage. What I'd like to explore with you, with the community here, is how can we bring texture and a little bit of taste of chicory closer to coffee ?

Here are my thoughts : I know coffee has a great amount of different chemicals reactions and effects like realising CO2 when in contact with hit water, and having different oils that will conduct flavours to one's tastes buds while also trapping the realised CO2 to form foam etc... So my points is trying to understand what might chicory miss that coffee has ? So maybe one can add it some how ?

Example : my first try to improve the drink was to try to melt a piece of dark chocolate in it. But dark chocolate does not dissolve well in hot water, or maybe I did not do it optimally ? Thinking : maybe it lacks a bit of fat, a bit of oil and maybe dark chocolate will add that ? That being a half victory half failure, I want to try next with hot milk, and dark chocolate melted in hot milk. But I'm not a fan of the idea of hot milk, what brought me to chicory, amongst other things, is its digestive benefits and hot milk feel like going against the purpose of it, a bit like taking sleeping pills with your coffee... üòÖ

So are there coffee experts, or chicory experts, or chemistry experts or simply not experts in anything but just interested people that would have suggestions on that ?

If you are none of the above, please restreint yourself in adding a useless comment... Aka don't be a smart ass üôèüôè‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

1g6m3wd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMcDojoLife/comments/1g6m3wd/grappling_a_tai_chi_grand_master/,Grappling a Tai Chi Grand Master,"I thought the McDojo community would appreciate this story.

Many years ago, I worked at coffee shop with a girl who practiced Tai Chi. I had met her instructor several times when he came into the shop, we actually got along nicely and he was a pretty cool guy.

One day, my coworker showed me this video of a [Tai Chi ""Grand Master"" throwing around a wrestler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTP16HPFMms). Apparently, the Grand Master was her instructor's instructor. At this point in my life, I was a blue belt in Jiu Jitsu and had wrestled through high school. I told her it was complete bullshido, and I guaranteed her that I would toss this dude on his head.

She immediately tells me I'm in luck, because the Grand Master is coming to our city to do a seminar that very weekend, and I was welcome to come. It is not in my personality to go confront some guy and challenge him to a grappling match, but at this point I felt completely obligated to back up my words.

So I show up to the seminar and see my friend's instructor, who I had met before. I walk up to him to shake his hand, and the guy just stares me down and tells me, I kid you not, ""I know what you have said.""

At this seminar were about 20 people who paid 60 bucks each to learn from the Grand Master. As the seminar is getting ready to begin, I'm sitting with a group of guys who are in complete awe that they're in the same room with this Grand Master. One very out of shape middle aged guy with a bandana tied around his forehead kept going on and on about how deadly this dude is and how he's mastered this and that technique. I can't lie and say I wasn't doubting myself at this point.

The Grand Master says that we will now do a grappling demonstration. This was my moment, but before facing the Grand Master, I had to grapple his student (my coworker's instructor).

The instructor warned me that he, ""Doesn't have the self control of the Grand Master."" We shook hands, I hit a blast double. This dude had obviously never grappled a day in his life. He went straight to his hands and knees with zero effort to protect his neck, so I sunk in a rear naked choke. The dude didn't even know how to tap, so I just let him go after his frame collapsed. We stand back up and got into a collar tie. My favorite takedown of all time is a slide by, and I hit a perfect one on this guy, took his back standing, hit a mat return to plant him on the ground, threw in a rear naked choke but this time I was standing while he was on his knees in front of me. I didn't even throw the hooks in, I just ragdolled the guy, holding him up by his neck as he was making some fairly funny choking sounds.

At this point, the Grand Master stepped in. This dude was genuinely tough and had great balance and physicality, he just lacked actual grappling knowledge. I took him down several times, but unlike his student, the Grand Master was pretty quick to throw in a guillotine attempt whenever I was in on his legs.

During one guillotine attempt, after I passed to the correct side, he would not let go of the guillotine grip or stop cranking my neck. Those of you who have grappled before will know that this is the perfect recipe for a Von Flue choke. He was damn near out cold, but he bridged and managed to get me to let go of the choke in order to keep top control. I passed to full mount, applied a forearm choke that really shouldn't have worked, but got the tap.

Ultimately, I just ended up ruining the entire vibe of the evening. The Grand Master couldn't continue to teach the class, instead we all heard him coughing and throwing up in the bathroom and he spent the rest of the class sitting down while his student taught the class. For my part, we were grappling on super thin mats on top of concrete and I was bleeding from my face and arm. The entire group of students just kept looking at me as though I had done something wrong, very much a ""dad just slapped mom at the dinner table but nobody is going to say anything"" vibe.

At the very end of the seminar as I was leaving, the instructor stopped me and told me that ""if we were fighting a real fight"" he would have destroyed me using his superior speed and techniques. I debated just telling him right at that moment that we could fight no holds barred until one of us was unconscious, but I was just over it.

The McDojo delusion runs deep, and I don't think I changed anyone's mind, but it was a very fulfilling experience. I hope you enjoyed my story.",8,1729268369.0,TheMcDojoLife,7,0.79,False

# The resilient, native fruit has a cult following and could be small farms‚Äô hedge against climate change in a fast-warming world



By¬†[Anna Phillips](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/anna-phillips/?itid=ai_top_phillipsa2) October 18, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EDT

LOCKPORT, N.Y. ‚Äî When Kyle Townsend and Mitchell Gunther decided to start an orchard in this town just east of Niagara Falls two years ago, they quickly dismissed the idea of growing conventional fruit.¬†[Warmer winters,¬†](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/summer-winter-seasonal-warming-global-trends/?itid=lk_inline_manual_1)followed by snap freezes, were devastating apple and peach crops. They nixed grape vines and berries, which invasive pests were targeting.

‚ÄúJust hear me out,‚Äù Townsend told his business partner, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre putting in a pawpaw orchard.‚Äù

[Pawpaws](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/09/03/pawpaws-forgotten-fruit-washington/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4)¬†are North America‚Äôs largest native fruit ‚Äî and are exceedingly rare, found mainly in the wild across 26 states or in small orchards in Appalachia, where the trees have historically thrived. Praised for their flavor, which is sometimes described as a cross between a mango and banana, the custard-like fruit is an ideal spoonable dessert. You won‚Äôt find them in the supermarket ‚Äî but some plant breeders are trying to change that.

Western New York is considered the very fringe of the pawpaw tree‚Äôs northern range. But as¬†[climate change](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2023/american-agriculture-farming-climate-change/?itid=lk_inline_manual_6)¬†brings warmer temperatures and more erratic weather to the region,¬†a small but growing number of farmers are drawn to pawpaws‚Äô low maintenance and adaptability.

In the wild, they grow from northern Florida to southern Ontario, tolerating a broad range of conditions and often spreading to form thickets. They are the only temperate genus of the otherwise tropical custard apple family ‚Äî a traveler that made its way north long ago and, farmers hope, might be a way reduce their risk as climate change increasingly threatens their crops.

‚ÄúTheir popularity is really exploding,‚Äù said Blake Cothron, owner of Peaceful Heritage Nursery in Stanford, Ky., which sells pawpaw trees. Pawpaws are vulnerable to snap frosts, like¬†[apple and peach trees.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/10/25/new-apple-species-climate-change/?itid=lk_inline_manual_10)¬†But unlike them, pawpaws have the unusual ability to produce more flowers if they lose their first set of blooms to a cold snap, he explained, making them hardier.

Pawpaws have developed a cult following among some backyard farmers and horticulturists, for whom the idea of restoring native fruit and nut trees to an overheating planet is urgent. Now the fruit‚Äôs resilience is giving it a wider audience in places it wasn‚Äôt common before, among both hobbyists and those who make a living growing fruit.

‚ÄúBackyard growers are planting pawpaws all over the country, that continues to grow. But small farmers are also looking at growing pawpaws as a supplement to their income or to diversify their offerings,‚Äù Cothron said.

The reasoning has as much to do with farmers‚Äô bottom line as the climate: The unpredictable bouts of¬†[extreme weather](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/06/22/deadly-heat-wave-climate-change/?itid=lk_inline_manual_16)¬†that have made pawpaws an appealing alternative are hurting some traditional crops.

Last year, a record-breaking spring frost killed most of the Northeast‚Äôs peach blossoms and¬†[hurt its apple crop](https://newyorkagconnection.com/news/new-york-apple-orchards-feel-the-effects-of-may-frost), prompting agricultural commissioners in 10 states to ask the federal government for aid. The University of Vermont described it as ‚Äúthe worst freeze/frost damage observed in more than 25 years in the industry.‚Äù

Anya Stansell, a Cornell University fruit-production specialist, said she knew farmers who are giving up on their peach and apricot trees ‚Äúbecause you get a good crop so few years.‚Äù

When the latest agricultural census surveyed pawpaw production for the first time in 2022, it tallied only 65 farms in New York state. More than 1,600 farms grew apples. Yet Stansell, who works with pawpaw growers in the state, is confident their numbers will grow. Demand for trees has soared, she said, doubling or even tripling the cost over the last several years.

Brandy and Nigel Sullivan know this problem too well.

The couple bought a 64-acre orchard in Mexico, N.Y., a town about half an hour north of Syracuse, with the dream of drawing in pick-your-own enthusiasts and selling fruit at farmers markets. After discovering many of their apple trees were diseased, the couple attended a pawpaw growers conference hosted by Cornell University and quickly pivoted. They planted 20 pawpaw trees two years ago and are now on a wait list to buy more.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sticking with things that, as the weather changes and we get more floods and warmer temperatures, are going to be the best for our orchard,‚Äù Brandy said.

Townsend and Gunther said they also see growing pawpaws as a hedge against climate change. Several years after they first sketched out the idea of an orchard on a coffee-stained piece of graph paper, it has become real: Swiftwater Farm is growing 60 pawpaw trees today, with plans to quadruple that number. The pair hope to fill the rest of their 44-acre property with a no-till vegetable garden, a native plant nursery and a wild landscape where visitors can walk through a food forest planted with American persimmons and Canadian plums, as well as pollinator-attracting shrubs and flowers.

As temperatures warm, and growing zones in the United States shift to reflect the changes in where plants can survive, Townsend and Gunther anticipate their orchard will become as favorable a place for pawpaws to grow as Kentucky or central Pennsylvania.

‚ÄúWe actually have the same growing zone now as some orchards in Ohio,‚Äù Townsend said, ‚Äúso I think that‚Äôs a tell of what‚Äôs to come.‚Äù

Though people in rural areas have long foraged for pawpaws, inspiring the nickname ‚Äúhillbilly banana,‚Äù it‚Äôs only in recent years that the fruit has become a sought-after star of farmers markets. From mid-August to October, the height of the season, pawpaw lovers flock to festivals in the Midwest and East Coast, eager to sample the fruit before it disappears.

As word gets around that he‚Äôs growing¬†[pawpaws,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/09/25/pawpaw-dc-fruit-love/?itid=lk_inline_manual_35)¬†Townsend said his phone is ringing with calls from interested buyers. Earlier this year, a chef contacted him looking for 500 pounds of fruit. Craft breweries are eager to buy huge quantities of pawpaws to make sour beers and meads, he said, and there‚Äôs already a market for frozen pawpaw pulp for smoothies and ice cream.

‚ÄúSometimes it feels like a race to get trees in the ground, to get fruit production to where you want it ‚Äî as fast as you can,‚Äù he said. The trees can take three years to produce fruit, sometimes as long as eight. Would-be buyers ‚Äúare kind of just waiting,‚Äù he said.

But if growers are eager to bring pawpaws north, farmers further south are beginning to wonder if climate change will hurt their crops. A¬†[severe drought in Ohio this year](https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-pawpaw-ohio-midwest-harvest-drought-spring-freeze-c060f2ca0ff9a110db922342a7c81ed3)¬†has farmers complaining of earlier-than-expected harvests and small, sour fruit. Some have also attributed the poor crop to heat stress, raising questions about whether the fruit can survive the effects of climate change in Appalachia, its cultural heartland.

Pawpaws have their share of skeptics. For as hardy as the pawpaw tree is, the fruit bruises easily and can go from ripe to mush on the counter in several days. Refrigerating them extends their life by a few weeks, but not enough to counter their reputation as a fragile oddity.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre almost ephemeral,‚Äù said Adam D‚ÄôAngelo, a plant breeder who is working to develop new pawpaw varieties that have a longer shelf life, while preserving the unique flavor.¬†[Project Pawpaw](https://www.projectpawpaw.com/), his crowdfunded effort to bring pawpaws to supermarket produce aisles, has a research orchard in New Jersey and is planning another in Wisconsin, where D‚ÄôAngelo is based, and where it has historically been colder than pawpaws would like.

Yet, ‚Äúthey grow just fine up here,‚Äù he said.

D‚ÄôAngelo said the United States needs more commercial pawpaw orchards if the fruit is to survive its increasing popularity. Otherwise, he worries pawpaw fanatics will continue to forage for them, picking wild stands clean and damaging the trees.

‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre trying to get more people into this, then we need to start growing them, we can‚Äôt just decimate wild stands,‚Äù he said.

In Lockport, Townsend and Gunther said they see themselves as part of that effort.

In late September, Townsend pointed to a section he calls the orchard‚Äôs northern research plot, where they were planting sweet-tasting pawpaw cultivars from Appalachia grafted onto northern pawpaw rootstock. Mixed in were a handful of wild pawpaw trees they were growing to ensure their genetic survival.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to build a little refuge here,‚Äù Gunther said. ‚ÄúWe have every intention of preserving as much of the ecology of western New York here as possible.‚Äù

Brand new set up after ditching home brewing for the last 2 years. I'm hoping I have better results this time around. Last set up was the Baratza Encore with Moccamaster/v60/Chemex. I could never consistently get a good resulting brew. I sold the whole thing and have been buying coffee every morning from the local roasters of my choice here in Denver. Great options by the way here in Denver.

I need help please. We brewed about 5 single serving (2 cups) examples so far and we are having deja vu. Going down the same road as last time. Everything we try, the coffee is just completely missing the 'body' or flavor notes that we get from the roaster. We are NOT buying junk beans. They are typically from Corvus, Queen City, Huck, Middle State, etc. All top notch roasters in the Denver, CO area.

I've used the preset 'light roast' and 'medium roast' settings on the Aiden. From what I can tell, it's just a difference between a 1:16 and 1:17 ratio on the two. The grind settings on the Ode Gen 2 we have tried all the way from 4.2 up to 8. 4.2 being just tasting like sour water, and 8 tasting like....water. We are using bottled water, no tap water, and the filters that Fellow provided.

Any tips at this point would be extremely helpful. I can already see this being the same frustrations we once had, so I'm hoping we can get this figured out before I decide to return the Aiden and sell the Ode Gen 2.",3,1729268228.0,FellowProducts,4,1.0,False

This time im gonna plug my youtube video talking about my recap. 

[https://youtu.be/8swTDDm\_z54](https://youtu.be/8swTDDm_z54)

But if you're more of a reader im still going to write it all out!

  
**Training**:

Post Ironman 70.3 victoria I seriously increased training time and mileage from about 13 hours a week to 20+ hours per week. Things were going very well all the way through till my next race, the Vic Half, where I took off considerable time on the bike. Going from a 4:22 to a 4:07 on a very similar course.

I kept training through after that event. Eventually 3 weeks after the race I hit a bit of a tipping point and felt super burnt out of many weeks of intense training. What I think happened was I was doing good absorbing the training and recovering, but as time went on and we got more into the summer my job got busier and I was starting to let things slip by. 

  
Sleep was getting shorter, eating was not as much of a priority, rest at work was shorter. Basically I just wasnt able to recover as much to really absorb the training. 

  
After taking about a week off I came back strong to training, with things actually going very well and feeling good, but ended up getting a bit of a cold/flu. Back to taking a week off and coming back slow to training. 

  
SO in conclusion, training was not as ssmooth as I was hopping, but still was excited for the race. Felt like I was doing good on the bike and wanted to see what I could really do.  But I feel like I learned a lot through this training block.

  
**Race Lead up:**

  
This was the shortest time I was giving myself pre race in a way to save a bit of money. I drove from Vancouver to Yakima on the friday afternoon. Then stayed in yakima. Woke up early on Saturday and drove the rest of the way to tri cities. Did a bit of course recon driving the course before pulling over and hopping on the bike for part of it. 

  
After doing some riding we drove down to the registration and did a quick shakeout run. Weather was definitely a bit hot, but not too bad!

Got registered, learned that there are only limited ""premium"" spots for AWA athletes and they are on a first come first served basis. So unfortunately I didnt get the rack positioning but I wasnt too bothered, but something to keep in mind for future races.

  
Due to time constraints I decided to skip a shakeout swim and focus on carb loading instead. Headed back to the hotel and grabbed some lunch from chipotle.

  
Dinner was pasta from another restaurant in town. 

  
Unfortunately it didnt seem like my stomach was gonna like my choices the next day.

  
**Race day**

Wake up. Have some granola and oat milk. Normally I would have instant oats but I didnt have access to hot water in the hotel room :/. I would also usually have a black coffee but also decided to try something new with a starbucks frappuccino. This was I think was did me in.

  
Walking to the car I was already feeling nauseous. 

We drove to the shuttle parking lot and before getting on the bus I threw up.

From there I was still feeling like shit the rest of the morning. I went to transition, set everything up and tried to forget about it. I tried to take a bit of carb drink but my body was just rejecting it.

Do the walk to the start line with my gf.

Get to the front of the swim start pack. Race gun goes off. Run into the water and there was a guy who look like he passed out almost??? I dont know if anyone else noticed this. But I stopped and tried to get officials attention because he was head down in the water and I was seriously worried he would die. 

Then out of nowhere he gets up and starts swimming. I was very confused but just continued on!

The swim was a bit of a blur. I just went at a consisten pace. I dont train swimming much so I dont have a whole lot to expect. Did the swim in about 19 mins. Downriver swim is a blessing haha.

Get to the swim exit and was just hugely confused for a bit as there was a dock and a marching band playing music and I just didnt really understand where to go. I think its more because I was tired and out of it rather than it being badly marked haha.

Get to my bike, get everything on. Bit of a slow transition. Im grabbing my bike and running with it when I realise I didnt do up my helmet. So I have to stop to buckle it up. Bike kinda falls down on me haha. Bit of a mess of a transition

Get onto the bike and not feeling too terrible but still scared to take in much nutrition. 

Then I notice a few people passing me. I assume its cause im feeling bad. Maybe Im sick.

But more people pass me

and more 

and more.

Im doing 290-310 watts avg and I weight 70kg which puts me at 4.2 w/kg. How are so many people passing me????

Do I have a flat? Is everyone at this race a uber biker???

  
Something has to be going on.

  
I keep riding and seriously it feels like people are just flying by me. I start thinking maybe my power meter is missreading and Im actually sick and just doing horrible. 

  
I get past the big hill. Somebody on a road bike passed me? I was such a difficult thing to go through mentally cause all my metrics are saying, ya you are actually doing decent. But everyone is passing me and my avg speed is down to like 30km/h

  
Finally I get to the part of the course that I did recon on my bike the previous day. I was doing similar power and going 10km/hr slower. SOMETHING WAS SERIOSULY WRONG.

  
I decided theres no way I could possibly bleed more time at this point. I hop off my bike to inspect. Something had gone wrong with my wheel and the FRONT RIM BRAKE WAS RUBBING THE WHOLE TIME. 

 

I was so DEFEATED. I wanted to DNF right there cause my race had just been ruined basically. All this time I also havent been able to take on any carbs as ive still felt like shit.

  
I decide to just get back on the bike and see what I can make of it.

  
Instantly im flying. 41km/hr+

  
I keep pushing and just passing back everyone that passed me. 

  
I fell back all the way to 84th place from about top 20 out of the water. I keep giving er and passing more people all the way till the end of the bike. Managed to claw my way back up to top 20 again. 2:24 was my finaly bike split. Did 52 mins @ 30km/hr, then 1:33 @ 41km/hr once I fixed the brake....

When I get to transition im not feeling too great due to lack of water, fuel and electrolytes, but we march on.

  
Grab my Nerd belt and get to running. Im just terrified im gonna bonk at this point. I tried taking a sip of my nutrition and the body was not having it. 

Figure if I cant get nutrition in, then I atleast need to get water. 

  
Every aid station I would take 2 water to drink and 2 to dumb on my head and back of my neck. It wasnt crazy hot but it was heating up a bit. 

  
The run really just was an emotional struggle. Emotional that I failed the race essentially. Emotional as I was really struggling with lack of carbs. It honestly was not a very fun run. But I managed to pull off still a 4:00/km pace. 1:23. I was aiming for 3:40-3:45 pace given my last two races were on a gravel trail and I held 3:50 pace :/

  
Finished with a 4:13

11th overall, 2nd in Agegroup(25-29)

**Post race thoughts:**

This was not the race I was hoping for. But I learned some things and will be making adjustments to my fueling, training and race prep for the future. 

My short term future will see me signing up for some more running races over the off season. I think maybe getting more experience racing and dealing with race nerves. As well as practicing race lead up. Could be something that really helps me for future races. 

Figuring out a way to bring my own food while staying in hotels, or booking an airbnb to cook my own meals I think is very important for me in the future. 

Next year Im looking at just doing more 70.3 races. While I didnt have the race I wanted and its a deflating way to end the season, Im still really looking forward to next season and making the changes necessary to really smash my season and goals.
