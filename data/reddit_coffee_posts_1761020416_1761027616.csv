Subways operate not only in Seoul but also in Busan, Daegu, Incheon, Gwangju, and Daejeon, and several other cities in Gyeonggi Province and the greater metropolitan area also run their own urban rail systems (including light rail). 

Here’s my guide to things you should *never* do. Following these rules will save you from awkward moments and sometimes heavy fines. Enjoy a smoother subway ride like a local! 

---


##  Strictly Prohibited by Law
- **No smoking**  
  - Within 10m of station entrances → fine up to ₩100,000  
  - Inside stations, platforms, restrooms, and trains → ₩300,000 (1st) up to ₩900,000 (3rd or more)

- **No fare evasion**  
  - Always have a valid ticket. 
  - If caught: pay the fare + up to 30× penalty (₩1,550 → up to ₩46,500 fine)

- **No alcohol and drunken disorderly conduct**  
  - No drinking alcohol inside subway trains or stations
  - Drunk, behaves in a riotous or disorderly manner by rough words or conduct in a public place may be fined up to ₩100,000.

- **Never step on tracks** 
  - If something falls (phone, bag, AirPods, etc.), ask staff to retrieve it.
  - Taking photos on the tracks is illegal and dangerous, even if no train is present 
  - Fine: ₩300,000 (1st) up to ₩900,000 (3rd or more)
- **Emergency button – for real emergencies only** 
  - Fine (False or prank use) : ₩1,500,000 (1st) up to ₩4,500,000 (3rd or more) 

- **No begging/selling/soliciting** – Unauthorized activities prohibited.  
  - Fine: ₩150,000 (1st) up to ₩450,000 (3rd or more)  

- **No unauthorized filming** 
  - Secret filming, especially with sexual intent or focusing on body parts, is punishable by up to 5 years in prison or a fine up to ₩30 million.  

---

##  Safety & Order
- **Stay behind the safety line** 
  - Wait behind the marked yellow line.  
- **Queue properly** 
  - Always line up, never cut in.  
- **Let passengers exit first** 
  - Always wait before boarding.  
- **Step aside at doors** 
  - If standing near the door in a crowded train, step aside to let others off, then re-board.
- **Don’t rush into closing doors**
  - Never try to squeeze in when the doors are closing; it’s dangerous and impolite.
- **Don’t push into crowded trains**
  - If the car is already full, wait for the next train.
  - Some people may squeeze in when in a real hurry, but it’s generally considered rude.
- **Prepare for your stop** 
  - When the train is crowded, move toward the exit early; don’t block others.  
  - If you don’t prepare in advance, you may miss your stop and have to get off at the next station.
- **Escalator etiquette** 
  - Stand on the right, leave the left free (though some campaigns promote standing on both sides).  
- **Walk on the right** 
  - On hallways and stairs, keep to the right.  
- **Don’t block with photos**  
  - Avoid stopping on platforms, stairs, or escalators. 

---
 
## Everyday Etiquette 

- **No food or drinks in trains** 
  - You may drink coffee on the platform, but do not bring it into the train. 
  - Note: Long-distance trains are different. On KTX, ITX, Mugunghwa and other intercity trains, eating and drinking are allowed. Many passengers bring lunchboxes or buy snacks from the station or onboard service.
- **No loud noise** 
  - Keep calls short (texting is preferred), avoid loud conversations.
  - Use earphones at low volume to prevent sound leakage. 
- **Priority seats (blue)** 
  - Reserved for elderly & disabled; always keep them free.  
- **Pregnant woman seat (pink)** 
  - The principle is to keep this seat empty at all times.
  - However, if you do sit there, you must give it up immediately when a pregnant woman boards. 
- **Respect the seats** 
  - Don’t lie down, put feet on seats, or sit on the floor.  
- **Backpack etiquette** 
  - In crowded trains, wear your backpack in front or place it on the floor.  
- **No filming/photographing others** 
  - Selfies or photos of your own group are fine, but avoid capturing strangers in the background.
  - If someone thinks you are deliberately pointing a camera at them, they may complain or even report you, so be cautious.
- **No excessive PDA (public displays of affection)**
  - Light hand-holding is fine, but avoid kissing or over-intimate behavior inside the train.
- **Dress modestly** 
  - It is taboo for men to go shirtless in public spaces (including the subway).
  - For women, very low-cut tops or excessively short skirts may also attract uncomfortable stares.
  - Tip: Carrying a light cardigan is recommended.(Anyway, subway cars are often too cold due to strong A/C).  
- **Mind physical contact**  
  - Minor brushing : Light bumps are common in crowded trains. No apology needed.
  - Apologize for strong contact : If you step on someone’s foot or bump into them hard, say sorry right away.
  - Don’t get upset if bumped : Even if you’re brushed against, most people won’t say sorry. It’s considered normal, so stay calm!

It appears they have tea from their local supplier, J’enway Tea Co! (Moonlit Orchid Oolong, Lychee Rose, Lady Blue Earl Grey, etc.) Reservations are highly recommended and afternoon tea is Saturdays and Sundays from 11:00 am/12:45 PM to 2:30 pm.

It’s paralyzing but I want to live. I know in my heart I want to. I want to love, to examine paintings, to see myself with white hair. I have so many things I still need to do. I want to listen to my favorite albums again and again. When I get into crying spells I can't help but see little me also crying. I have no choice but to keep trying.

There’s nothing wrong with treating yourself, but I think real self-care is about the boring, consistent things that actually keep you healthy and steady long-term. To me, it’s less about escape and more about building habits that make daily life smoother.

For example, I’ve heard some people take “self-care” trips or buy big-ticket items, only to come back stressed because the important stuff (like bills, savings, or deadlines) was still waiting for them. In those moments, what they really needed was to look after their future selves, not run from the present.

So here’s what self-care looks like for me day to day:

- Brushing and flossing with an electric toothbrush.
- Using a massage gun in the evenings to release tension before bed.
- Keeping my space clean so I don’t start the next day in chaos.
- Walking 30–40 minutes most days.
- Doing some stretching and basic breathing exercises.
- Staying on top of my budget and to-do list.
- Making time for social check-ins (a text, a call, grabbing coffee).
- Journaling at night to plan for tomorrow and clear my head.

Nothing glamorous but these habits make me feel grounded and, like I’m actually taking care of myself instead of just putting out fires. ",1,1761026845.0,productivity,2,1.0,False

So APPARENTLY my fiancé didn’t ask or talk to my brother prior to proposing to me. My father already gave him approval (via FaceTime because my parents haven’t been able to meet him in person due to living situations and conflicting schedules) and my fiancé said he did talk to my older brother a few weeks ago at dinner while I was in the bathroom.

I haven’t always had the best relationship with my father due to alcoholism and poor mental health but he had been in recovery for the past 1+ years and we are genuinely in such a good place. My older brother had been kind of like a surrogate dad during the time my father wasn’t around but once he got married and began settling down, we kind of started distancing ourselves a bit. Without getting into the weeds too much, this makes sense and is normal as far as I’m concerned. Despite everything, we’ve always been very close because growing up we only had each other and what not. My fiancé and I even spent Christmas with him and his wife, and I go over to just catch up and see my brother semi-regularly given my schedule (I’m a grad student)

I found out recently from my current roommate (who full disclosure does NOT like or respect my fiancé, nor does she seem to believe or respect my defenses of him; a long story that would be a post of its own) that my brother is upset that my fiancé did not even talk to him prior to proposing. I asked my fiancé about this and he says he definitely talked to my brother a few weeks prior about it and I full on trust him on this. He has no reason to lie to me and honestly, if he didn’t talk with my brother, I don’t care. I love him and that’s all I care about.

I’m livid and don’t even know what to do because 1) my brother should NOT be talking about this with anybody other than my fiancé and I as far as I’m concerned, especially not with 2) my roommate who has been very verbally disrespectful to my fiancé, a situation which I have discussed with my brother and stated makes me upset and uncomfortable. 

I have asked my brother to meet with me over coffee once he is back (he’s on vacation right know) and my fiancé texted him to clear the air as well because he believes it’s just a misunderstanding but I’m just so beyond irritated. I was not very supportive of his marriage when he got engaged but I kept my mouth shut because he was and is happy. It just feels so disrespectful to have him airing out his complaints (allegedly) with my roommate who we all know does not like my fiancé, but also not talking to me about it.",0,1761026497.0,wedding,4,0.4,False

1oc50ri,https://i.redd.it/qpe0a3fkmewf1.jpeg,The Beauty of Love,"The best love stories are often the ones you never saw coming—proof that it’s never too late to feel that spark again, to rediscover the light in your eyes when someone truly sees you.
When love blossoms later in life, it carries a gentler kind of magic. It’s not about chasing or proving; it’s about feeling safe enough to just be. It’s the kind of love that grows in laughter over morning coffee, in unspoken understanding, and in the simple joy of companionship.
In our younger years, love is about building—a home, a family, a future. But as we grow older, love becomes about sharing the present. Both hearts bring with them their history—their triumphs, heartbreaks, and the lessons carved deep into the soul. There’s no posturing, no pretending. The walls come down, and what remains is truth.
Because at this stage in life, love isn’t about changing someone—it’s about accepting, celebrating, and complementingwho they’ve become.
💞 When the Priorities Shift
The focus drifts away from high-stakes drama toward peace, joy, and genuine connection. You start realizing that laughter, security, and emotional meaning matter far more than the intensity of a whirlwind romance.
This is the love that holds you on bad days, cheers you on during good ones, and reminds you—over and over again—that life still has beautiful chapters waiting to be written.
It’s not flashy. It’s not chaotic.
It’s real, grounded, and deeply satisfying.
🕊 When Outside Forces Try to Dim the Light
But not everyone will celebrate this kind of love. Some people—out of jealousy, insecurity, or their own unhealed pain—will project negativity into something they don’t understand.
They’ll twist the story, question your heart, and try to insert chaos where peace has finally settled. Their goal isn’t to protect—it’s to control. Their intention isn’t love—it’s power.
They haven’t taken the time to know your soul, yet they feel entitled to judge it.
And that’s where discernment comes in.
Because when you’ve walked through the fire and healed your heart, you recognize when someone’s energy doesn’t align with your peace. You learn to step back with grace, not anger. You protect your love—not with walls, but with boundaries.
Remember this: what’s real doesn’t crumble under pressure—it grows stronger.
Outside influences may stir conflict or attempt to separate you, but authentic love holds firm. It listens, it heals, and it chooses understanding over reaction.
🌹 A Second Chance at Love and Life
For those who’ve lost a great love or watched a long marriage fade, it’s easy to believe that your story has already been written. You make peace with solitude. You convince yourself that maybe this is it.
And then—just when you least expect it—someone walks in and sees you.
Not the past version of you.
Not the one defined by heartbreak or survival.
But the you who stands here now—strong, wise, radiant, and still capable of being loved in full color.
That’s the miracle of unexpected love: it’s not about reliving your youth. It’s about honoring your growth. It’s dancing again—not recklessly, but with confident grace.
Because the heart doesn’t grow old—it grows wiser.
And the greatest love stories aren’t about how they start…
They’re about how two people choose to show up, again and again, when life gives them another chance.

“Sorry, my girlfriend is tired and just fell asleep.”

Chapter 1 Let's Break up 

Everyone in the play circle knew that Janet Hernandez was hopelessly in love with Brian Clark. 

Her love consumed her life, leaving no room for herself. She wished she could spend every hour of the day by his side. 

Every time they broke up, it took less than three days before she'd come back to him, pleading for reconciliation. 

Anyone could bring up breaking up in this world, but Janet was the exception. 

When Brian entered the room with his new flame in his arms, an eerie silence fell for five seconds. 

Janet paused peeling an orange. ""Why the silence? Why are you all looking at me?"" 

""Janet..."" Her friend cast a worried glance at her. 

But Brian was unfazed as he settled onto the sofa with the woman. ""Happy birthday, Larry."" 

It was blatant as if nothing was amiss. 

Janet stood up. It was Larry Nelson's birthday, and she didn't want to cause a scene. 

""I'm going to the restroom."" 

She could hear the conversation picking up inside as she closed the door. 

""Brian, didn't I tell you in advance that Janet would be here? Why did you bring her here still?"" 

""Seriously! Brian, you've gone too far this time."" 

""It doesn't matter."" Brian let go of the woman's delicate waist to light a cigarette. 

Amidst the rising smoke, he smiled like a carefree playboy. 

The rest of the conversation was cut off as the door shut behind Janet. 

She used the restroom calmly. While touching up her makeup and looking at herself in the mirror, she suddenly curled her lips. 

""How ugly."" 

She was living an ugly life, lacking in dignity. 

Janet took a deep breath, making a decision in her heart. 

Yet, when she returned to the room and pushed the door open, the scene before her made her tighten her grip on the doorknob and almost broke her composure. 

Brian was pressing his lips to the woman's tender lips, their saliva moistening the tissue between them. 

Laughter and jeers erupted around them- 

""D*mn! Brian knows how to play!"" 

""They're at it! They're at it!"" 

""The mood's set. Just kiss before us!"" 

Janet's hand on the doorknob was trembling. 

That was the man she had loved for six years, and now, the irony stung her deeply. 

""Hey, cut it out..."" someone whispered, nodding towards the door. 

Everyone turned to look. 

""Janet... Are you back? We were just messing around. Don't take it..."" 

But Brian cut the man off, looking over nonchalantly. ""Janet, since you're here today, let's make it clear."" 

""Sure, go ahead."" 

""These years of breaking up and getting back together have been quite tiresome. The spark between us has long faded."" 

Janet clenched her fingers, her nails digging into her palm, yet she felt no pain. 

Ha, six years of affection and all it boiled down to was ""faded"". 

""I like Heather and I want to be with her."" 

Janet numbly nodded. ""Okay."" 

""Although we're breaking up, we're still friends. If you ever need anything in Vespera, you can still reach out to me."" 

""No need."" Janet forced a light smile. ""Since we're breaking up, I want it to be a clean break. It's only fair to Heather."" 

Brian raised an eyebrow, seemingly surprised. 

""Larry."" Janet turned to the birthday boy Larry. ""Happy birthday. Everyone, enjoy yourselves. I'm leaving now. Those oranges on the table are peeled by me. Eat and don't waste them."" 

Brian didn't like fruits, except for oranges. 

But he was picky, insisting on removing every bit of pith before eating. 

Over the years, to ensure he had his daily vitamin from fruit, Janet would peel oranges meticulously, clean off the pith, and place them neatly on a plate before him. 

When Brian was in a good mood, he would hug her affectionately and say like a spoiled child, ""My girlfriend is so perfect. How did I get so lucky?"" 

""You are already doing a wifey job."" 

He always knew what she wanted, yet he never proposed. 

Brian said, ""I'll have my driver take you."" 

""No need. I've called a car."" 

Larry offered, ""Janet, let me walk you to the door."" 

Janet waved him off and turned to leave. 

""Brian, look at the mess you've made... I think Janet is really angry this time."" 

""It's not that serious."" 

""Exactly! How many times have they broken up like this? When hasn't Janet come back to Brian after a few days, acting as if nothing happened at the next gathering?"" 

""This time I bet five days."" 

""I say six."" 

Brian glanced at the slightly ajar door of the private room and smirked coldly. ""I bet she'll come back to me within three hours."" 

""Right, Brian's got this. The whole world knows how madly in love Janet is with him."" 

""Man, why can't I find a woman who's as devoted to me?"" 

""You? Dream on!"" 

""Ha-ha..."" 

... 

It was past midnight when Janet returned to the villa. 

She spent half an hour packing her luggage. 

She had lived there for three years, yet now, everything she wanted to take with her only fitted into a small suitcase. 

She didn't take all the designer clothes she never wore and the jewelry she never donned. 

The only thing she regretted leaving behind was the wall of professional books. 

But it was okay. She had absorbed their content, so the physical copies weren't as important. 

Her gaze swept over the dressing table. Janet walked over and pulled open a drawer. 

Inside was a check for ten million dollars. 

Underneath the check was a document - ""Transfer Contract for Plot 3-5, East Suburbs No. 72."" 

Although the plot was located in the suburbs, it was valued at least four million dollars. 

Both items were signed by Brian during their last breakup and left untouched in the drawer since. 

He was sure Janet wouldn't dare to take them because to accept would mean their relationship was truly over. 

Six years for fourteen million dollars? 

Suddenly, Janet felt it wasn't a loss. 

How many women could claim their youth was compensated so handsomely? 

She packed both items into her bag. 

Why not take them since Brian had given them to her? 

The love was gone, but the money was real. 

She wasn't one of those naive heroines in Billionaire Romance who regarded money as nothing. 

""Hello, cleaning service? Do you take urgent requests?"" 

""Yes, a deep clean, I'll pay extra."" 

Janet left the keys at the door and took a taxi straight to her best friend's place. 

On the way, the cleaning lady called again to confirm- 

""Miss, are you sure you don't want to keep any of these items?"" 

""Yes, just handle it as you see fit,"" Janet said before hanging up. 

When Brian got home, it was the wee hours, and the cleaners had already finished and left. 

The pungent scent of perfume on him made his head ache. He loosened his collar and planned to sit on the sofa, but ended up falling asleep there. 

When he woke up the next morning, he heard the familiar sound of dishes clinking in the kitchen. 

He lifted the blanket and sat up, rubbing his temples while reaching for his water glass. 

However, he grasped nothing, and his hand paused above the coffee table. 

Then he smirked. She had returned and tucked him in with a blanket, but hadn't she prepared any hangover tea for him? 

Had she not gotten tired of this ""incomplete defiance"" after all these years? Ha... 

Brian got up. ""Today you'd better..."" 

""Mr. Clark, are you awake?"" 

""Teresa?"" 

""Please wash up first. Breakfast will be ready in two minutes. By the way, were you cold while sleeping? I turned on the heating and was still worried that you might catch a cold, so I covered you with a blanket."" 

""Oh..."" 

Chapter 2 Become Rich

At the dining table, Brian frowned, ""Where's the oatmeal and nut porridge?""

""Do you mean the stomach-soothing porridge?""

""Stomach-soothing porridge?""

""Yes, the one Miss Hernandez usually makes. Almonds, walnuts, pecans, and hazelnuts all simmered together, right? Oh, I didn't have time to prepare that. Just chopping the nuts needs to be done the night before, and then I'd need to get up early to start simmering.""

""And the heat has to be just right. I don't have Miss Hernandez's patience to watch it constantly. It wouldn't taste the same even if I tried, and...""

Brian interrupted, ""Get me some beef sauce.""

""Right away, Mr. Clark.""

""Why does this taste off?"" Brian glanced at the jar. ""The packaging is wrong too.""

""That jar ran out, and this is all we had.""

""Pick up two jars from the supermarket later and keep them at home.""

""They won't have it.""

""What?""

Teresa gave an awkward smile, ""That's Miss Hernandez's homemade recipe. I don't know how to make it...""

Clang!

""Huh? Mr. Clark, aren't you eating?""

""No.""

Teresa watched his retreating figure with a puzzled expression.

Why did he suddenly lose his temper?

...

""Lazybones! Time to get up!""

Janet turned over, her eyes still closed. ""Stop yelling. Let me sleep a bit longer...""

Laura Garcia, already made up and choosing a handbag, remarked, ""It's almost eight o'clock. Don't you need to go back and make breakfast for Mr. Clark?""

Janet used to stay over occasionally but would rush back before dawn to prepare nourishing porridge for Brian who had a sensitive stomach.

Laura was very speechless about this.

Was Brian incapacitated or what? Was ordering takeout too much of a hassle?

He always made Janet bend over backwards.

To put it bluntly, it was just a spoiled bad habit!

Janet was sleeping soundly when she heard that. She waved dismissively. ""No. We broke up.""

""Oh? How many days are you planning to part with him this time?""

""...""

""Then sleep in. Breakfast is on the table. I'm off to work. I have a date tonight, so don't prepare dinner for me... Forget it. I'm sure you'll be back later. Make sure to close the balcony window when you leave.""

Janet woke up hungry.

Eating the sandwich made by Laura, she watched the brilliant sunlight outside the window, hardly remembering the last time she had woken up naturally.

After finishing her breakfast-turned-lunch and changing clothes, Janet headed straight for the bank.

First, she cashed the check for ten million dollars.

Money was always more reassuring in hand.

Then she visited the neighboring bank. ""I need to speak to your private banking manager. I want to deposit two million dollars.""

In the end, the president of the bank offered a decent annual interest rate, but Janet pushed for two more points, and they happily reached an agreement.

Following the same strategy, she went to two more banks, depositing two million dollars at each, negotiating a higher interest rate with each.

Stepping out of the last bank, Janet was now a rich woman with three bank black cards, six million dollars in deposits, and a liquid fund of four million dollars.

""This breakup is nice.""

Overnight, she had become rich.

Passing by a bustling hair salon, Janet pushed through the door.

She immediately purchased a four-hundred-dollar card, gaining queue-jumping privileges.

Sitting in front of the mirror, she looked at her brown, wavy hair with disdain for the first time.

""Miss, your hair is so well-maintained, like a doll's...""

Her curly hair was because Brian liked long and beautiful hair.

After their intimate moments, he liked to linger his hands in her tresses.

But beautiful curls meant spending more time on maintenance.

Janet smiled faintly at the stylist, ""Please cut it short, straighten it, and dye it black.""

No matter how beautiful a doll was, it was just a toy.

Let someone else play that part; she was tired of it.

Stepping out of the hair salon, Janet felt a weight lifted off her shoulders. Right next door, a shop was having a sale. She walked in and picked out a white T-shirt and a pair of jeans, wearing them out of the shop.

They matched perfectly with her sneakers today.

As she wandered, she found herself outside the gates of Crystal Cove University. Watching the students cycling in and out under the setting sun, Janet paused, lost in thought.

""Eric! Over here-""

A young boy brushed past Janet. ""Why is everyone gathered here?""

""We're planning to visit Professor Johnson, so...""

Eric Scott interjected, ""With so many people, the hospital definitely won't allow it. Let's do this. Just two representatives from the bioinformatics department will come with me.""

Bioinformatics... Professor Johnson...

Janet's expression sharpened slightly, and she quickly stepped forward. ""Who did you say was sick?""

Seeing this pure and pretty girl, Eric stuttered slightly, ""Pro... Professor Johnson.""

""Emily Johnson?""

""Yes.""

""Which hospital?""

""West Vespera Hospital.""

""Thank you.""

""Uh... which department are you from? Were you also a student of Professor Johnson?""

His question was left unanswered as Janet strode away.

Back in her apartment, Janet's mind was restless.

Was the fiery old lady who would smack someone on the head when angry ill?

Was it serious?

She opened her contacts, found the number labeled ""Patricia Harris"", and hesitated for a long time before ultimately lacking the courage to dial.

Years ago, she had unhesitatingly given up the opportunity for a combined master's and PhD program to be with Brian for what she called love.

She hadn't worked a day since her undergraduate graduation, living instead as a housewife whose mind was focused on a man.

Emily must have been extremely disappointed.

""Huh? Janet, didn't you go back?"" Laura exclaimed as she changed her shoes.

Janet's mouth twitched. ""What, do you want to kick me out?""

""Wow, it's amazing how long you're holding out this time. I remember last time you and Brian broke up, it took less than half an hour for him to call and you went back obediently.""

""There's porridge in the pot. Help yourself.""

Laura's eyes lit up. She dashed into the kitchen, ladled out a bowl, and remarked while eating, ""That jerk Brian is really lucky, getting to drink this every day...""

Janet said, ""Remember to wash the dishes and clean up after yourself. I'm going to bed.""

""Hey, are you really not going back?""

The bedroom door closing was her only answer.

Laura clicked her tongue softly, ""She's finally standing her ground...""

Under the same night sky, at the riverside villa.

""Mr. Clark, the bank has confirmed that Miss Hernandez personally cashed the ten-million-dollar check today at 12:05 PM...""

Brian hung up and gazed out at the night view coldly.

""Janet, what new game are you playing now?""

If she thought that this would win him back, she was sorely mistaken.

There was no stepping back in the decisions he made.

""Larry, care to join me for a drink?""

Half an hour later, Brian pushed open the door of the private room. Larry was the first to greet him with a smile, ""Brian, everyone's here, just waiting on you. What are we drinking tonight?""

Brian walked in.

Larry didn't move, looking behind Brian.

""What are you waiting for?""

""Where's Janet? Still parking?""

Brian's expression darkened slightly.

Chapter 3 Blocked

""Can't find a spot? Let me go out and help...""

Oops!

Noticing Brian's displeased expression, Larry suddenly realized. ""Ahem! Brian, don't tell me Janet hasn't... come back to you.""

It had been over three hours.

Brian spread his hands and shrugged. ""Come back? Do you think breaking up is a game?""

With that, he walked past Larry and sat down on the sofa.

Larry scratched his head. Could Janet be serious this time?

But he soon shook his head, thinking he was overreacting.

He believed that Brian could easily break up on a whim, but Janet...

Of all the women in the world who might agree to break up, she wouldn't.

That was a well-known fact in their circle.

""Brian, why are you alone?"" Jacob Wright, adding fuel to the fire, crossed his arms and smiled faintly. ""You bet three hours, and now it's been a day.""

Brian smirked. ""Lost a bet, accept the consequences. What's the punishment?""

Jacob raised an eyebrow. ""Let's change it up today, no drinking.""

""What?""

""Call Janet, and say 'Sorry, I was wrong. I love you.' in the gentlest voice.""

""Ha-ha...""

Laughter erupted around them.

Larry even grabbed Brian's phone and dialed Janet.

After a few rings, it said, ""Sorry, the number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable...""

Was Brian's number... blocked?

Brian was momentarily stunned.

The laughter gradually subsided as everyone exchanged glances.

Larry quickly hung up, handed back the phone, and tried to cover. ""Well... Maybe it really is unavailable. How could Janet block Brian? Pigs might fly, ha-ha...""

He trailed off, embarrassed.

Jacob thoughtfully said, ""Maybe Janet is serious this time.""

Brian scoffed, ""If breaking up isn't serious, what is? I'm not playing this game a second time. From now on, if anyone brings up Janet, don't blame me for ignoring our friendship.""

Jacob's eyes narrowed slightly, and he said after a long while, ""Just don't regret it.""

Brian sneered, unconcerned.

He never regretted his actions.

Seeing this, David Miller hurried to lighten the atmosphere. ""Come on, guys. Let's not get too serious, ha... We're all friends...""

......

At seven o'clock in the morning, Laura finished her morning run and just entered the house when she smelled the delicious aroma of breakfast.

Janet emerged from the kitchen with hot porridge, dressed in a houndstooth dress that showcased her fair and straight legs. Her face was bare but stunningly beautiful.

""Hurry up and shower. Then come eat breakfast.""

Laura asked, ""Oh? Did you change your hairstyle? Black, long straight ponytail? You're dressed so nicely. Are you planning to go back? Or is Brian picking you up?""

""Humph, can't you wish me anything good?""

""Isn't Brian coming to pick you up good enough?"" Laura approached the dining table, seeing a feast laid out.

""Go shower."" Janet swatted away her reaching hand. ""You're filthy.""

""You're double-standard! You never hit Brian when he uses his hands to grab food before washing them.""

""Well, I'll definitely hit them next time if there's a chance.""

""Yeah right...""

After Laura showered, Janet had already left with a thermal lunch box.

""Tut-tut, you made breakfast for me but didn't forget to pack something for your man, always prioritizing romance over friendship...""

Private ward, West Vespera Hospital. 

""Emily, how are you feeling today?""

Emily set down her paper and pushed up her reading glasses. ""Joshua? What are you doing here?""

""Don't move."" Joshua Martin quickly stuffed a pillow behind her. ""Your wound hasn't healed yet.""

""Appendicitis, just a minor surgery. But at my age, recovery isn't as quick, so the doctor's kept me here for so many days. By the way, have the quotas for this year's master's program been released?""

""Yes, you have three, and I have four.""

""Three, huh..."" Emily murmured.

""What, do you still plan on taking only two this year?""

""Yeah, I'm old and can only manage two.""

Joshua pursed his lips. One of those slots was specifically reserved for her, yet she wouldn't admit it.

""Professor Johnson- Oh? Professor Martin, you are here too."" Eric entered with two junior students, setting down fruits and flowers. ""We've come to visit Professor Johnson.""

During the casual conversation, a student mentioned, ""I heard there's a super talented freshman this year who got direct admission to the integrated BSc-MSc-PhD program.""

At the School of Life Sciences at Crystal Cove University, only three undergraduates had earned this distinction in nearly a decade.

""I heard that she snagged two gold medals in one go at the International Mathematics and Computer Science Olympiads last year, securing her a spot in our department.""

""Two gold medals? That's not so impressive. I remember a senior, one of Professor Johnson's students, who entered undergrad with four gold medals - math, physics, chemistry, computer science. She got them all! I think her name was Ja...""

""It's about time!"" Joshua interjected at the right time, ""You should head back to campus.""

""Oh, then... We'll take our leave.""

""Alright.""

As they left the hospital room, the student looked downcast, ""Eric, did I say anything wrong? Why do I feel like Professor Johnson and Professor Martin looked unhappy?""

Eric was also puzzled.

Inside the hospital room, Joshua said, ""Those students didn't mean it. Don't overthink it.""

Emily waved her hand, but her lips trembled uncontrollably, and tears began to pool in her eyes, eventually running down her face.

""Such a talent... She shouldn't have... But why... Why didn't she cherish her gifts?""

""You need to calm down...""

""Joshua, do you know what she told me the last time we met? She said she wanted love... Ha, she wanted love? She broke my heart...""

Janet stood at the doorway, clutching the thermal lunch box, tears streaming down her face as well.

She thought, ""I'm sorry... Professor Johnson...""

Ultimately, she didn't have the courage to enter, leaving the lunch box at the nurse's station. ""This is for Professor Johnson. Please pass it on, thank you.""

""Hey- You haven't checked in yet! Why are you running off?""

Janet ran to the outside of the hospital building, gasping for fresh air, but the suffocating guilt lingered.

""Janet?"" A tall, elegantly made-up woman in high heels and carrying a classic five-grid Dior bag approached.

She was wearing a suit with a sheath dress. Her straight hair draped over her shoulders, and she exuded intellectuality from head to toe.

She was Carol Clark, Brian's younger sister.

""Is that really you? What are you doing at the hospital instead of being at home?"" She glanced at the building.

It was the general ward, so Janet was probably not here for obstetrics.

Carol breathed a sigh of relief on behalf of her mother.

If Janet were actually pregnant and forcing a marriage, Marilyn Clark would be beside herself.

""Carol."" Janet managed a weak smile.

""Why are your eyes red? Have you been crying?""

Janet didn't respond.

""Did you have a fight with my brother again?""

""No.""

Carol assumed Janet was just being stubborn, her eyes showing a hint of sympathy.

She actually liked Janet. Janet was good-looking and had a pleasant personality.

Unfortunately, she just wasn't quite up to the Clark family's standards, especially since Marilyn highly valued academics, only favoring top scholars from prestigious schools as potential daughters-in-law.

""It must be tough being with Brian, right? He's got a bad temper. Just bear with it.""

Janet said, ""Actually, we've already broken...""

""Well, I have something else to do, so I won't keep you.""

With that, Carol checked the time and headed inside.

She was there to visit Professor Johnson. She heard that Professor Johnson favored smart and well-behaved students, so she meticulously dressed up for today's visit.

A few years ago, people said FiDi sucked as a place to live because it's mainly for 9-5 commuters during the weekdays, and is dead on evenings and weekends. It was especially dead during Covid.

Now, I don't mind having to leave the neighborhood to meet up with friends for dinner or clubbing, or to concerts and comedy shows. People complain about that stuff too much but since SF's such a small city, it's not too bad to take MUNI to other parts of the city, or even walk to places, or take the occasional Waymo/Uber. I already do that to visit friends in different parts.

But it would be nice to have day-to-day stuff like grocery stores, coffee shops, barbers etc nearby within 10-15 min (maybe max 20 min) walking.

FiDi seems to be more alive now at least in the weekday thanks to companies doing RTO. Also, there are some bars there like Pagan Idol and Madarae, and nightclubs like Temple.

It’s like I forgot what they were talking about and always ask my fiance to translate “just in case” I actually wasn’t following along and made up the topic of conversation in my head then I respond in English and let him translate that back to his family. Idk if it’s insecurity and doubting myself but even when it’s just my fiance and myself speaking he’ll be speaking in French and I respond in English so I feel like I must be able to understand fairly well and something is just lagging in my production. I completely blank. 

Even when he and I are practicing French often I understand what he asked me but then I can’t even think of a response in English let alone French. For ex he could ask something as simple as what’s your coffee order and I’ll be like “uhhh… ché pas”. ALL WORDS JUST LEAVE MY BRAIN! 😭 unless it’s in the moment in which case I can do simple things like order for myself when we’re in France. 

WTH is wrong with my brain? I am ADHD diagnosed is it something to do with that bc I am grasping at straws. I really want to know what my problem is so I can figure out how to fix it and improve my French. I’m terrified to take the exam to get B2 with this blanking, it needs to be rectified. 

Thanks in advance!

1oc4q9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1oc4q9n/the_burning_line_the_watch/,The Burning Line: The Watch,"The sensor tower smelled like burnt wiring and someone's forgotten coffee. Hayes leaned against the console, watching readouts that hadn't changed in four hours. Green lines. Steady pulses. The same gentle wave pattern that meant nothing was trying to kill them today.

Three weeks since the last contact. Twenty-one days of this: standing watch, checking equipment, waiting for something that might not come. The kind of waiting that made you stupid, made you careless. Made you forget that out there, past the perimeter, past the minefield and the plasma nets, things were hunting.

He pulled out the notebook. Worn leather, pages soft from handling. Clicked his pen.

*Emma,*

*Day 427 on the Line. Nothing happened today. Nothing will happen tomorrow. I used to think boredom was the worst part of this job. Now I know better—*

""Sarge.""

Hayes looked up. Toller stood in the doorway, rifle slung over one shoulder, looking young enough to make Hayes feel ancient. The kid had that fresh-scrubbed academy shine, hair still regulation-neat, uniform without the stains and patches that marked veterans.

""Relief's not for another hour,"" Hayes said.

""I know. Couldn't sleep."" Toller stepped inside, letting the door hiss shut behind him. ""Mind if I...?""

Hayes gestured at the spare chair. The kid sat, careful, like he was afraid of breaking something. For a minute neither of them spoke. The console hummed. Somewhere in the tower's guts, a fan clicked with every rotation.

Toller cleared his throat. ""My father used to quote Tennyson. 'Ours not to reason why, ours but to do and die.' He said it before every deployment.""

""He still serving?""

""No. He died when I was fourteen. Reactor breach on the *Valiant*.""

Hayes capped his pen. ""I'm sorry.""

""It's fine. I mean, it's not fine, but—"" Toller's hands moved, shaping something invisible. ""He died doing his job. That matters, right? That it meant something?""

The kid wanted reassurance. Wanted to hear that sacrifice was noble, that death in service was beautiful. Hayes could give him that lie. Could quote something back, make it sound profound. He'd done it before, for other kids who needed to believe.

But he was tired.

""Sometimes people just die,"" Hayes said. ""And all the poetry in the world doesn't change that.""

Toller flinched. Good.

""Sorry,"" Hayes said, because he was still a sergeant, still responsible for morale. ""Long watch.""

""No, you're right."" Toller's voice went quiet. ""I just... I want it to mean something. If I die out here. I want—""

The console chirped.

Both of them looked at it. A blip on the edge of the scan range. There one second, gone the next.

""Probably just debris,"" Hayes said, but his hand was already moving, pulling up the sensor log. ""Tower Three, you seeing this?""

Static, then: ""Negative contact. Screens are clean.""

The blip didn't come back. Hayes stared at the readout for another thirty seconds, watching for movement, watching for anything. Green lines. Steady pulses. Everything normal.

""See?"" He leaned back. ""Just a ghost.""

But he didn't pick up his pen again. And Toller didn't look away from the screen.

---

The mess hall served breakfast at 0600, which meant Hayes had twenty minutes to shave, change his uniform, and pretend he'd slept. He managed two out of three.

Kowalski was already at their usual table, surrounded by what looked like half a weapons locker scattered in pieces. He had a plasma rifle stripped down to its core assembly, fingers moving with the kind of easy confidence that came from years of knowing how things fit together.

""Morning,"" Kowalski said without looking up. ""Coffee's shit today. Someone forgot to filter the recyc water again.""

Hayes grabbed a tray. Protein paste dyed to look like eggs, something that might have been bacon in a previous life, coffee that probably wouldn't kill him. He sat down across from Kowalski and took a sip. It tasted like the sensor tower smelled.

""What are you doing?""

""Upgrading the plasma conduits. Standard issue caps out at forty percent charge efficiency. I can get it up to sixty, maybe sixty-five if I—""

""In English.""

Kowalski grinned. ""Making the shooty bits shoot better.""

""And if it explodes in someone's face?""

""Then they should've been nicer to me."" He fitted a component back into place with a satisfying click. ""Besides, I test everything on myself first. Lost some arm hair last week, but the principle's sound.""

Ming slid into the seat next to Hayes. No tray, just a cup of coffee she held like a lifeline. Dark circles under her eyes. Her uniform looked slept in, which probably meant she hadn't slept at all.

""Tower Three reported movement last night,"" she said. ""0327 hours, sector seven, range twelve thousand klicks. Lost contact after four seconds.""

Hayes set down his coffee. ""You pulled the logs?""

""Of course I pulled the logs."" Her fingers traced invisible equations in the air. ""Cross-referenced with Tower Two and Four. Neither saw anything, but there's a sensor shadow in sector seven where—"" 

She stopped. Took a breath. Hayes waited.

""Sorry. Been running numbers all night."" Ming rubbed her eyes. ""If something was out there, at that range, moving at standard approach velocity, we should have seen it for at least thirty seconds."" Her hand flattened on the table, thumb tapping. ""Four seconds means either it was moving way faster than anything we've encountered, or it dropped into the sensor shadow deliberately. Patrol route seven passes through that sector at 0400. If something's hunting, that's where it would wait.""

Kowalski's hands stopped moving. ""You think they found us.""

""I think we should change the patrol routes. Randomize them, or at least—""

""Ming.""

She looked at Hayes. For just a second, he saw it: the fear underneath all that tactical analysis, the thing she was trying to calculate her way around.

""Take it to Graves,"" Hayes said. ""If she thinks it's worth adjusting the schedule, she will.""

""She'll say I'm being paranoid.""

""Probably. But that's not your call.""

Ming's jaw tightened. She drank her coffee, stood up. ""Fine. But when something comes through sector seven and eats half our patrol squad, remember I told you so.""

She walked away, still muttering. Hayes caught fragments: ""—blind spot coverage—"", ""—three-point triangulation—"", ""—basic tactical awareness—""

Kowalski went back to his rifle. ""She's fun at parties.""

""She's right, though."" Hayes pushed his tray away, appetite gone. ""Something's out there.""

""Something's always out there."" Kowalski held up a conduit to the light, checking for cracks. ""Question is whether it's coming here or just passing through.""

Hayes didn't answer. He was thinking about the blip on his screen, there and gone. Thinking about Toller's question: did it mean something, dying out here? Did any of it mean anything?

His radio crackled. ""Sergeant Hayes, report to Lieutenant Graves. Now.""

---

Graves's office was smaller than it should have been for a commanding officer. Barely enough room for a desk, two chairs, and the tactical display that took up most of one wall. She stood in front of it, hands behind her back, studying something Hayes couldn't see from the doorway.

""Sir.""

""Close the door.""

He did. Graves turned. She looked tired—not the kind of tired that came from one bad night, but the deep exhaustion that lived in your bones. Her uniform was perfect, though. Creases sharp, insignia polished, not a hair out of place. She wore control like armor.

""Corporal Ming brought me an interesting theory,"" Graves said. ""About our sensor ghost.""

""Sir, she's just being thorough—""

""She's right."" Graves touched the display. It lit up, showing Firebase Prometheus in green, surrounded by the white grid of their sensor net. A red dot pulsed at the edge of sector seven. ""That's not debris. That's intentional.""

Hayes stepped closer. ""How do you know?""

""Because it happened three more times last night. Different sectors, same pattern. Four-second contacts, then gone."" She zoomed out. More red dots appeared, scattered around the perimeter. ""They're probing us. Testing our coverage, looking for blind spots.""

""How many?""

""Unknown. Could be one ship running multiple passes. Could be a dozen."" She met his eyes. ""Command thinks it's a scout element. Early warning for something bigger.""

Hayes looked at the dots, counting them. Twelve. Thirteen. All around the base, a slow careful circle. ""When?""

""Best guess? Twenty-four hours. Maybe less."" Graves pulled up another screen, this one showing force deployment. ""I'm doubling patrols, pulling everyone off secondary duties. Rivera's prepping medical. Kowalski's workshop is now an armory. Every available weapon gets distributed.""

""What about evacuation?""

""Command says we hold. Firebase Prometheus is the anchor point for this entire sector. If we fall back, we lose forty light-years of territory."" She said it flat, like she was reading a manual. Like it was someone else's decision. ""We hold.""

Hayes nodded slowly. He'd known this moment was coming—had known it since the day he enlisted. Maybe since the day he watched Meridian Station burn with his daughter still inside. There was always going to be a last stand, a place you couldn't retreat from, a line you held or died trying.

""Rules of engagement?"" he asked.

""Anything that moves outside the perimeter, you drop it. No warnings, no attempts at communication. If it's out there, it's not human anymore.""

""And if it gets inside?""

Graves's expression didn't change. ""Then we make them regret it.""

---

By noon, Firebase Prometheus had transformed. The casual sprawl of off-duty hours vanished, replaced by something harder. People moved with purpose, checking equipment, reviewing defensive positions, saying things they might not get another chance to say.

Hayes found Nakamura in the armory, testing Kowalski's modified rifles. She fired at the range target—three shots, center mass, tight grouping—then checked the power cell readout.

""How's it feel?"" Kowalski hovered at her shoulder.

""Recoil's different. Lighter."" She ejected the cell, examined it. ""Cell life?""

""Should get you fifteen percent more shots before burnout.""

""Should?""

""Okay, twelve percent. But still—""

Nakamura loaded a fresh cell, fired again. Six shots this time, alternating between two targets. Perfect placement. She handed the rifle back. ""It'll do.""

Hayes watched her walk away. No acknowledgment, no thanks. Just that flat assessment, like everything else was just noise between her and the next fight.

""She's in a good mood today,"" Kowalski said.

Rivera appeared in the doorway, medical bag over one shoulder. ""Hayes. You're overdue for a check.""

""I'm fine.""

""Humor me.""

She steered him to a corner bench, pulled out a scanner. Hayes sat still while she ran it over him, the device humming softly. Numbers scrolled across the screen—heart rate, blood oxygen, stress markers.

""When did you last sleep?"" Rivera asked.

""I sleep.""

""How much?""

""Enough.""

The scanner beeped. Rivera frowned at the display. ""Your cortisol levels are through the roof. You're running on adrenaline and caffeine. That's not sustainable.""

""None of this is sustainable, Doc.""

She put the scanner away, pulled out a small bottle. ""Sleep aids. Military grade. Take one tonight, before watch.""

""Can't. Need to stay sharp.""

""You won't be sharp if you collapse."" She pressed the bottle into his hand. ""That's an order. And yes, I can give you orders about your health.""

Hayes pocketed the pills. He wouldn't take them—couldn't afford the risk of sluggish thinking—but arguing would take more energy than pretending to comply.

Rivera hummed softly. Some old melody Hayes didn't recognize. She did that when she was worried, filling silence with sound.

""It's going to be bad, isn't it?"" she said.

""Yeah.""

""Bad like last time, or worse?""

Hayes thought about the red dots on Graves's display. Thirteen contacts, maybe more. Patient, careful, hunting. ""Worse.""

Rivera nodded. She'd been here long enough to know what that meant. ""I'll prep the overflow tents. Just in case.""

*Just in case* was medic-speak for *because we'll need them*. Hayes didn't correct her.

---

The afternoon passed in preparation. Hayes walked the perimeter with his squad, checking defensive positions, reviewing fields of fire. Ming muttered calculations at every stop, measuring angles, counting steps, building invisible maps in her head. Toller asked questions—too many questions—until Nakamura told him to shut up and pay attention.

At the northern checkpoint, they found old Sergeant Ruiz replacing a sensor node. He'd been on the Line longer than anyone, twenty-six months without rotation. His hands shook slightly as he worked, the tremor of someone who'd seen too much and couldn't unsee it.

""All quiet?"" Hayes asked.

Ruiz grunted. ""For now."" He finished the connection, closed the panel. ""You know what the worst part is? The waiting. Give me a straight fight any day. But this..."" He gestured at the empty horizon. ""Knowing they're coming and not being able to do shit about it.""

""How many times have you done this?""

""Six major assaults. Lost count of the probes and raids."" Ruiz wiped his hands on his uniform, leaving grease smears. ""Want some advice? Don't try to be a hero. Heroes die first. Do your job, watch your sector, and maybe you'll live long enough to wish you hadn't.""

They left him there, standing watch over empty ground. Hayes wondered if Ruiz had been like Toller once—young, idealistic, quoting poetry. Or if he'd always been hard, just with more skin on it.

At 1800 hours, Graves called everyone to the main hangar. Two hundred people crammed into a space meant for half that, shoulder to shoulder, waiting. Hayes positioned his squad near the front. Ming stood rigid, vibrating with nervous energy. Toller kept touching his rifle, checking the safety over and over. Nakamura looked bored.

Graves climbed onto a supply crate so everyone could see her. For a moment she just stood there, looking at her people. Hayes saw her count them. Saw her doing the math: how many would still be alive in twenty-four hours?

""Listen up."" Her voice carried, command-sharp. ""Long-range sensors have confirmed hostile approach. Multiple contacts, closing on our position. Estimated contact in eighteen to twenty hours.""

No reaction. Everyone had already heard the rumors, the whispers in the mess. Confirmation just made it real.

""Firebase Prometheus is tactically critical to this sector's defense. Command has ordered us to hold this position. So that's what we're going to do."" She paused. ""I won't lie to you. This is going to be rough. But we've trained for this. We've prepared for this. And when the sun rises tomorrow, we're still going to be here.""

Someone in the back called out: ""What if we're not?""

Graves's expression didn't change. ""Then we make sure they remember why.""

It should have been inspiring. Should have fired them up, sent them out ready to fight. Instead, Hayes watched people exchange glances, watched them calculate their own odds. Graves was a good officer, but she wasn't a liar. And right now, they needed a lie.

Hayes stepped forward. Didn't plan it, didn't think about it. Just moved.

""Three weeks ago,"" he said, voice carrying, ""we held this line against twelve hostiles. We lost two people. Two. Because we did our jobs, watched each other's backs, and didn't panic."" He met eyes in the crowd, picked out faces he knew. ""Yeah, this is going to be bad. Yeah, some of us probably won't make it. But that's not new. That's every damn day on this Line. And every day, we're still here.""

He pointed at the hangar door, beyond which lay kilometers of defensive positions, weapons, traps. ""Out there, they see targets. Prey. Things that run and die. They don't see us. Don't see two hundred people who've already survived everything they could throw at us. Don't see Firebase Prometheus, where things come to die.""

Now people were listening. Now they were standing straighter.

""So let them come,"" Hayes said. ""Let them test our walls and probe our defenses. Let them think they've found easy meat."" He smiled, and it wasn't friendly. ""And when they hit us, we show them they were dead the moment they chose this target.""

Someone whooped. Someone else started clapping. It spread, turning into noise, into energy, into the thing they needed: belief that they could do this, that survival was possible.

Graves caught his eye. Nodded once. *Thank you.*

Hayes nodded back. He didn't tell them what he really thought: that eighteen hours might not be enough. That when the attack came, half of them would be dead in the first five minutes. That he'd done the math, knew the odds, and they weren't good.

But sometimes a useful lie was the kindest thing you could give.

---

Evening found Hayes back in the sensor tower. Different shift, same view: green lines, steady pulses, emptiness that promised violence.

He opened the notebook.

*Emma,*

*They're coming. Finally. After all these weeks of waiting, they're actually coming. And you know what the fucked up part is? I'm almost relieved. At least now something happens. At least now I know.*

*I keep thinking about that last morning. You ate cereal, remember? Made a mess on the table, milk everywhere. I was annoyed—we were late, I had to catch the transport. I told you to hurry up. My last words to you were ""come on, we're late.""*

*I'd give anything to go back. To sit there while you ate slowly, to not care about the time, to just be with you for five more minutes.*

*But I can't. So instead I'm here, writing letters to someone who'll never read them, waiting for monsters.*

*I'm tired, Emma. I'm so damn tired. But I can't stop. Because if I stop, if I let myself think too much, I'll remember that you're gone and this is pointless and—*

A hand touched his shoulder. Hayes nearly dropped the pen.

Rivera stood there, medical bag at her feet. ""Sorry. Knocked, but you didn't hear.""

Hayes closed the notebook. ""What do you need?""

""To check on you. Humor an old woman.""

""You're not old.""

""I'm old enough to know when someone's running on empty."" She sat down without asking, pulled out her flask. Took a sip, offered it to Hayes. ""Bourbon. Real stuff, not synthesized shit.""

Hayes hesitated, then drank. It burned going down, left a warm trail to his stomach. ""Where'd you get this?""

""Traded six sutures and a field dressing to a supply sergeant."" She took the flask back. ""Worth it.""

They sat in comfortable silence. The console hummed. The sensor lines stayed green.

""You think we'll make it?"" Rivera asked.

""Some of us will.""

""That's not what I asked.""

Hayes looked at her. Rivera's eyes were kind, patient. Waiting for the truth.

""No,"" he said. ""I don't think we'll all make it.""

She nodded. Drank again. ""I've been doing this for twenty years. You know what I've learned? Everyone thinks they're ready for war. They're not. You can't be ready for watching people die. Can't be ready for the smell, the sounds, the way bodies come apart. You just endure it and hope there's something left of you at the end.""

""Inspiring speech, Doc.""

""I'm not here to inspire. I'm here to tell you—"" She capped the flask. ""—when this is over, when the shooting stops and we're counting bodies, you're going to feel like you should have done more. Saved more people. Made better choices. That guilt will eat you alive if you let it.""

""Speaking from experience?""

""Always."" She stood, picked up her bag. ""Get some sleep, Hayes. Even an hour helps.""

She left him there. Hayes picked up his pen, but the words wouldn't come. He stared at the page—at Emma's name at the top, at the half-finished thoughts.

Not breaking. Just... cracking. A fracture line running through everything.

He closed the notebook. Leaned his head back against the wall. Just for a minute, he told himself. Just a minute of rest.

The console chirped.

Hayes's eyes snapped open. He looked at the display.

Red. Multiple contacts, all across the board. Not blips anymore. Solid signatures, coming in fast.

He keyed his radio. ""Tower One to command. Multiple hostiles, all sectors. They're here.""

Graves's voice came back, steady as stone. ""All units, battle stations. This is not a drill. I repeat: this is not a drill.""

Alarms shrieked through the base. People ran to positions, weapons charged, defensive systems came online with whines of building power.

Hayes stood at the window, watching the horizon.

At first he saw nothing. Just darkness, stars, the familiar emptiness of space above their world. Then movement—shapes blotting out constellations, dozens of them, moving with purpose. The largest ones eclipsed whole sections of sky, swallowing stars as they passed.

Not ships. Not the clean lines of human vessels with running lights and navigation beacons. These were *things*. Organic curves, asymmetric forms, surfaces that seemed to breathe and pulse. Some small, darting like insects. Others massive enough to block out half the horizon, slow, predatory.

And eyes. Jesus, so many eyes. Scattered across their hulls, blinking independently, searching.

One of the large ones passed close enough for Hayes to see details. Bone-white plates overlapping like scales. Muscle tissue flexing beneath transparent membranes. Spines and barbs jutting at random angles. It moved wrong—not thrust and momentum, but sliding, slithering, hunting.

As he watched, it turned. Dozens of eyes swiveled toward the base.

Toward him.

Hayes felt the moment of recognition. Felt the thing acknowledge his existence, mark him, file him away as prey. Something in the set of its movement changed. Became focused. Became *interested*.

He grabbed his radio. ""Graves, they've spotted us. They—""

The first impact hit like a hammer. The tower shook. Lights flickered. Warning klaxons added their voice to the chaos.

Hayes ran for the door, rifle in hand, notebook forgotten on the console. Behind him, the sensor display showed what he already knew: red everywhere, closing in, surrounding them.

The Plague had come to Firebase Prometheus.

1oc4opl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_mtagay/comments/1oc4opl/i_like_him_but_he_has_sex_with_his_friends/,"I like him, but he has sex with his friends","It’s been a minute since I’ve written on this Reddit. I had the idea to chronicle my escapades and my contribution to the gay agenda in New York City. Well, I have something to complain about, so here I am. Are you ready to be my proxy for a second source of therapy?

I met this really lovely guy on Grindr. We hooked up. But then, he seemed to like me so much that he asked me out for coffee. I’ve been liking him very much, so I said yes. We’ve had some really lovely dates. And the sex has been amazing. It’s intimate and connective.

I’m ready for romantic relationship with someone. I started considering that this is someone I would certainly consider dating seriously.

(Oh, and by the way, he lives a few blocks away from me. GAY HEAVEN. CUE THE HALLELUJAH CHORUS.)

Tonight, when we were together, I learned that he creates explicit content for a social media website. He and I talked about it. I told him I’m a jealous guy, and that I’ve really started to like him. He also says that he likes me.

After I came back home, he sent me the link to his content. I took a look at it out of curiosity (and because I’m a 33 year old man). It was very sexy stuff. But then I noticed something.

He has sex with people he calls his friends.

This isn’t really an issue for me in and of itself. I don’t judge it, and to an extent, I understand it. Ad for me, I prefer not to have sex with my gay friends. To each their own.

However, because I lean way more monogamist, when it comes to dating and a relationship with someone, this is an issue for me. 

So now I’m home, and I’m on the verge of spiraling about this guy I only met one or two months ago. The reality is, when I get excited about a guy, I tend to have all these expectations. And I’m actively learning how to not have those expectations, to remain open, and to still stand by what I want in a relationship, regardless of how great a guy is whom I meet.

So here’s to me,  not letting myself spiral, and instead, telling myself that:

1) This guy is great, and we have wonderful intimacy. And that’s awesome. 

2) As great as this guy is, the way we actually live out our sexual lives wouldn’t meld well in a relationship for me. 

And that’s okay. 

Is it possible that he’ll denounce his social media sex content and sex with friends all for me? Because my wants and needs are the most important? Because I’m a jealous person and I need him to not make me jealous? Because I’m a monogamist, and monogamists a dying gay breed, and I need him to prove to me that I’m not part of a dying breed?

(Please note all the sarcasm.)

Sure, it’s possible that he could change how he lives out his sexuality to date me. But, I’ve learned over the years that I cannot bank on any man changing the way he lives for me. And that’s because, I certainly won’t change the way I live for them. 

They’re not my whole world, and I shouldn’t be their whole world. It’s more like we’re two moons transiting in the same solar system, and maybe we decide to orbit the same planet. But certain conditions have to be in place for the dual orbiting to work just right. In this case with this guy, I don’t see those conditions being right for romantic relationship.

I’m done victimizing myself and making one experience with a wonderful guy the be all and end all, only to then give up on dating altogether. All of this brings up a lot of crap that really triggers me. But I’m owning my trigger, remaining open to getting to know this man as a person, and setting a boundary to remind myself that his sexual expression is not the kind that I want to coexist with in a romantic relationship. 

I’m disappointed. I’m upset. But it will pass. In a city of thousands of gay men, I’m not the only one looking for what I’m seeking. 

So, Self, stop victimizing yourself, enjoy the good sex with him, keep your head up, and unapologetically be yourself and go where the dating waters are warm. ",1,1761024824.0,u_mtagay,0,1.0,False

1oc4ndj,https://www.reddit.com/r/LastDriveIn/comments/1oc4ndj/joe_bobs_portland_appearance_was_a_waste_of_time/,Joe Bob’s Portland appearance was a waste of time and money.,"Spent $45 for an advertised Joe Bob intro, Q&A, screening of Bubba Ho-Tep and a meet and greet. 

Joe Bob’s intro was sad; some lame tired political cliches, reading from the forward of the book and then reading off a piece of paper to intro the movie. The intro was the best part but after that he said he would be in the lobby before and after.  He also let it slip in the intro the event was supposed to have been a double feature. 

The advertised Q&A never happened and for the meet and great, after standing in line to see the book was a $55 oversized coffee table book, I peaced out; found out he’s doing a free signing tomorrow in town as well. 

Whole thing felt like a soulless cash grab which doesn’t shock me given Dark Horse sponsored it.

I will say his last appearance here was wonderful and I’d give Darcy a ton of credit for that; her energy and enthusiasm was sorely missed. ",0,1761024692.0,LastDriveIn,1,0.4,False

I go by the handle **Pawkt**.

I’m a bluntly honest freelance journalist with an insatiable love for Indie games. Gaming isn’t just a hobby, it’s my waking life. I’ve always gravitated toward indies, not just for their creativity, but because of the way many indie developers openly engage with their player base. There’s something much more special about that connection between each other, it makes the whole experience feel more personal.

I’m not here to promote myself. I’m here to spotlight the incredible work of indie developers and their upcoming games, following the recently wrapped up Steam Next Fest: Fall 2025 Edition. I'm quite docile and quiet. I don’t typically speak up unless I’m truly passionate about something. And in this case, that something is Indie video games.

Over the past month and weeks, I dove headfirst into behind the scenes access to SNF, sampling hundreds of demos through personal exploration, community recommendations, and some direct dev & PR requests. The amount of talent on display this time around was... Let's just say not as great as the Spring / Summer variants, but there were still some gems hidden beneath all that grime.

Over the years, I’ve had countless conversations with indie devs while trying out their games. I’ve seen firsthand the effort and heart they pour into their projects, only to see those same titles quietly disappear without much recognition. It’s frustrating. Many of these devs are genuine, passionate, and incredibly talented, and they deserve to be seen far beyond small circles. That's where I come into the mix.

I spend so much time, tirelessly compiling massive lists fully spliced commentary and gameplay from these events. A mix of well-known titles, niche curiosities, and under-the-radar gems. I want to celebrate these developers and help bring more eyes to their hard work as small and insignificant as I may be.

But, I’d also love to hear your suggestions too! It's not all about me. What games flew under the radar this Next Fest that you think more people should check out? Or any titles you think I’d love? We're all ears!

Let’s keep spreading the love for indie games.

1oc4hho,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/1oc4hho/fire_in_rental_as_a_tenant/,Fire in rental as a tenant,"Asking some advice here on behalf of my dad. He has been renting a house with a basement suite (other tenants live downstairs) for about a year, landlord moving back to the unit in June. Its a nice place, but it unfortunately has those stoves with the knobs right at hip height instead of against the back. He was house sitting at someone else's house and was coming back home this weekend. As they were moving their stuff back in, he set a bin with his coffee machine on the stove while they unloaded the rest of the car. Within 15-30 min (he isnt sure exactly how long but no more than 30 min) there was fire. Basically the entire stove area has been burned, but the actual serious damage is the flooding from the sprinklers and the fire department. The tenants downstairs have been flooded as well as the entire top floors. He didn't have tenants insurance because his landlord never required it and he doesn't really think ahead about those things. He's kicking himself now. Funny thing is when the insurance inspector came, the stoves knobs were melted, but melted in the off position.


Now here's the real tea. His landlord did not disclose to her insurance company that she has been renting out her unit and has had tenants for several years, so they're telling her its highly likely they will not cover the damages because she didn't disclose that. Now she's coming after my dad saying she's going to sue him, that he has to pay rent to her until June, that shes spoken to many lawyers and he's screwed because she's coming for him, all the sorts. He knows he fucked up, but accidents like this happen all the time (the insurance guy literally said its his 3rd call like this in a month) and thats why landlords have insurance and disclose that they have renters.


Realistically, what position is he in here? Is he on the hook for rent? Can she successfully sue him? He said that had he known she didn't disclose her house is a rental on her insurance that he wouldnt have moved there, especially because now her insurance provider is telling her she committed insurance fraud and they will not cover any of the damages",1,1761024126.0,legaladvicecanada,3,1.0,False
1oc4h2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/tribit/comments/1oc4h2r/stormbox_blast_low_volume_eq_tips_for_cozy_living/,"StormBox Blast, low volume EQ tips for cozy living room podcasts?","We host a little “Sunday stories” get together, friends on the couch, tea on the table, podcasts and audiobooks at truly whisper levels. I’m running a StormBox Blast by the bookshelf, and at these volumes I want voices to feel natural (no hiss, no harsh “S” sounds), just that comfy “someone’s talking in the room” vibe.



What’s been working so far



Placement: raised to about chest/ear height, slightly toed in toward the seating, a little space from the wall so it doesn’t sound boomy off the corner.

Volume discipline: set one notch above “too quiet,” then leave it, no riding the dial mid episode.



Light EQ nudge (phone + Tribit app)



Tiny presence lift for voices (just a little bump in the “speech” band), and a gentle trim up high if sibilance pokes through. Nothing dramatic, subtle moves only. 



Where I could use your tips



Your go to “speech” EQ in the Tribit app, simple, repeatable settings that don’t make S sounds sharp. 



Any placement hacks that tame table reflections (coffee table right in front of the couch).



Night friendly routines for keeping dialog clear without touching volume once people settle in.

Below is a detailed comparison chart of the best carpal tunnel wrist braces right now, lined up side by side with their price, support type, material, fit range, key features, and who each one is *best for*. This way, you can skip the endless scrolling and find what actually works for *your* wrist.

# Understanding Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

Let’s start with the basics. The **carpal tunnel** is a narrow passageway in your wrist that’s home to the **median nerve** (the one responsible for sensations in your thumb, index, middle, and half your ring finger). When that nerve gets squished thanks to swelling, repetitive motion, or inflammation you get the delightful cocktail of pain, tingling, and numbness known as **carpal tunnel syndrome**.

Typical symptoms include:

* **Pain** in your wrist, palm, or fingers.
* **Tingling or numbness**, especially at night.
* **Weak grip** (hello, dropped coffee cups).
* **Burning or electric-shock sensations** in your hand or forearm.

CTS is often caused by repetitive hand use (typing, gaming, driving, lifting), poor wrist posture, or conditions like arthritis and pregnancy. The good news? You can usually manage mild to moderate CTS without surgery and that’s where wrist braces come in.

# Why a Wrist Brace Actually Helps

A good wrist brace does three critical things:

1. **Keeps your wrist in a neutral position,** so your median nerve can breathe.
2. **Prevents over-bending or twisting**, which worsens inflammation.
3. **Gives the area a chance to heal** while you go about your life.

Here’s what that means for real people:

* **Pain Relief:** The biggest reason people use braces. By limiting motion, the nerve finally stops screaming.
* **Reduced Nerve Compression:** No bending = no pinching. The brace acts like a physical reminder to chill.
* **Improved Circulation:** Many offer gentle compression that helps reduce swelling.
* **Faster Recovery:** Rest equals repair.
* **Prevention:** Once symptoms ease, you can keep using a brace for high-risk activities to stop flare-ups.

If your pain spikes at night, a **night brace** can work wonders. If you spend all day typing, a **day brace** that allows limited movement might be better. We’ll get into all those types below.

# Types of Carpal Tunnel Wrist Braces

Not all wrist braces are created equal. Some are soft and cozy, some are rigid like a cast, and some look like medieval armor but actually feel great. Here’s the breakdown:

# 1. Night Braces

Designed for bedtime use because that’s when most people unknowingly bend their wrists. They’re soft, padded, and breathable.

* **Best for:** Nighttime numbness or pain.
* **Pro tip:** Go for something plush, like the *ComfyBrace* or *Dr. Arthritis* models. You’ll actually wear them all night instead of throwing them across the room at 2 AM.

# 2. Daytime Braces

Rigid enough to keep you stable while typing, driving, or holding tools but flexible enough that you can still function.

* **Best for:** Work hours or repetitive tasks.
* **Examples:** *FEATOL* and *FREETOO* are good middle-ground options, firm support without feeling like a prison cuff.

# 3. Hand Braces

These extend support to your palm and fingers, ideal for people who have pain radiating beyond the wrist.

* **Best for:** CTS that affects the hand and wrist.
* **Examples:** *ZOFORE SPORT* and *Medibot Thumb Splint* provide full-coverage support.

# 4. Adjustable Braces

Flexible designs that let you tweak compression and tightness depending on how bad your symptoms are that day.

* **Best for:** Mixed-use wear or variable pain levels.
* **Examples:** *Rakiie Carpal Tunnel Brace* and *BraceUP* let you fine-tune comfort levels easily.

# 5. Rigid Splints

Think maximum immobilization. These are the heavy-duty braces used for severe CTS or post-surgery recovery.

* **Best for:** Severe cases or after medical procedures.
* **Examples:** *ACE Brand Stabilizer* or *MUELLER Fitted Wrist Brace*—both rock-solid but surprisingly comfy.

# 6. Thumb Stabilizer Braces

These support both wrist and thumb, great for when CTS blends with thumb tendonitis or arthritis.

* **Best for:** Pain involving both wrist and thumb.
* **Examples:** *Rakiie Wrist & Thumb Brace* or *Medibot Spica Splint.*

# 7. Wrist Sleeves

No splints here just mild compression. Great for early-stage CTS or when you just need gentle support.

* **Best for:** Mild symptoms, swelling, or post-recovery maintenance.
* **Examples:** *CERBONNY* or *Fitomo,* lightweight, cheap, and discreet enough to wear under long sleeves.

# 8. Wrist Straps

Minimalist options that focus on compression and stabilization during activity.

* **Best for:** Early signs of CTS, tendinitis, or gym support.
* **Examples:** *NuCamper* or *CERBONNY 2-Pack.*

# 9. Combined Wrist Braces

All-in-one solutions that stabilize your wrist, thumb, and hand, useful for severe or multi-area pain.

* **Best for:** Chronic CTS or combo issues.
* **Examples:** *Rakiie Wrist & Thumb* or *Medibot Spica.*

# How to Choose the Right Wrist Brace

Picking a wrist brace shouldn’t feel like defusing a bomb, but it does help to know what you’re looking for. Here’s the step-by-step approach that actually makes sense:

# 1. Assess Your Symptoms

* **Nighttime pain only?** → Go for a soft night brace like *ComfyBrace* or *Dr. Arthritis*.
* **All-day pain from typing or gaming?** → Choose a daytime brace like *FREETOO* or *FEATOL*.
* **Thumb hurting too?** → Grab a thumb stabilizer.
* **Severe or post-surgery?** → Go rigid, like *ACE* or *MUELLER*.

# 2. Check Comfort and Fit

A brace should be snug not tourniquet-tight. Look for:

* **Multiple straps** for better fit.
* **Breathable fabrics** like mesh or neoprene.
* **Soft padding** for long wear.

Avoid cheap Velcro that dies after a week especially on low-cost models like *CERBONNY*. If you’re sensitive to heat or live in humid weather, pick breathable ones like *MUELLER* or *Copper Compression*.

# 3. Match the Support Level

* **Mild support:** Wrist sleeves or straps (early CTS).
* **Moderate:** Adjustable braces for daily tasks.
* **Maximum:** Rigid splints for serious cases.

# 4. Consider Durability

Look for reinforced seams, metal (not plastic) splints, and reputable brands. Braces with removable splints like *FEATOL* are easier to clean and maintain.

# 5. Talk to a Professional

If symptoms persist or worsen, it’s not a “grit through it” situation. A doctor or physical therapist can guide you toward the right brace and exercises to pair with it.

# Key Features That Actually Matter

When you’re browsing through dozens of identical-looking wrist braces, keep these in mind:

|Feature|Why It Matters|Pro Tip|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Adjustability**|Ensures the brace fits snugly and comfortably|Look for 2–3 Velcro straps|
|**Material**|Breathable fabrics prevent sweating|Mesh or copper-infused = less smell|
|**Splint Type**|Determines rigidity and support|Removable splints add flexibility|
|**Ease of Use**|You should be able to put it on with one hand|Test closure placement before buying|
|**Portability**|Slim designs fit under clothing|Ideal for office or travel|
|**Maintenance**|Washable fabrics last longer|Always air-dry to protect Velcro|

# Getting the Right Size

A brace that’s too tight can cut off circulation; too loose, and it’s basically a wrist sock. Measure your wrist circumference at the crease and check the manufacturer’s chart.

**Pro tip:** Some braces (like *FEATOL* or *Copper Compression*) have left- and right-hand versions for better ergonomics. Universal “one-size-fits-all” models like *CERBONNY* work for most people but may feel bulky on small wrists.

# How to Actually Use a Wrist Brace

# When to Wear It

* **During symptom flare-ups:** Wear when pain or tingling increases.
* **At night:** Most people naturally bend wrists in sleep, which worsens CTS. Night braces help a lot.
* **During repetitive tasks:** Typing, cooking, gardening any wrist-intensive activity.

# How to Wear It Correctly

* Keep your wrist **neutral**, not bent.
* Adjust straps so it’s snug but doesn’t leave marks.
* The splint should align under your palm or along your forearm.
* Don’t overuse it. Take breaks for light stretching.

# How Long to Wear

* **Night:** Every night for 6–8 weeks.
* **Day:** During strain activities, but remove during rest. Overuse can lead to stiffness or muscle weakening, so balance is key.

# Cleaning and Care

Most braces can be **hand-washed** with mild detergent and air-dried. Machine-washing wrecks the Velcro and padding. Replace your brace if:

* It loses firmness.
* The Velcro stops sticking.
* It starts smelling like a gym sock graveyard.

Budget options like *CERBONNY* may need replacement sooner, while premium models like *Copper Compression* last several months of regular use.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**1. Do wrist braces really help CTS?** Yes. They keep your wrist neutral and reduce nerve compression, most users report less pain and tingling within weeks.

**2. Can I wear a brace all day?** You can, but don’t overdo it. Take breaks and stretch your fingers to prevent stiffness.

**3. Should I wear it while typing?** If your symptoms flare up from computer work, absolutely. Go for slim models like *FREETOO* or *BraceUP* that let fingers move freely.

**4. Can I sleep with it on?** Yes, in fact, that’s when it helps the most. *ComfyBrace* and *ACE* are excellent for night use.

**5. How tight should it be?** Snug enough to stabilize, loose enough that your hand doesn’t go numb. If it cuts off circulation, loosen it immediately.

**6. Can I wash my brace?** Most are hand-washable. Always air-dry, no dryers unless you enjoy melted Velcro.

**7. When should I replace it?** When it’s stretched out, flattened, or smells permanently like regret. Usually every few months with regular use.

**8. Can braces help other wrist issues?** Yes. They also help with sprains, arthritis, tendonitis, RSI, and post-surgery recovery.

1oc4f1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/1oc4f1v/being_more_upfront_about_my_wiring_when_im_not_up/,Being more upfront about my wiring when I'm not up for plans feels like a breakthrough,"**TLDR: trying not to have too much social contact is awkward in a social world and hard to balance with also being friendly. I can defend my solitude needs a little more easily by naming the fundamental difference that others might not be aware of. ""As an introvert, socializing takes energy and I'm a little spread thin right now. It would work a lot better for me if we do that when I have some extra energy to spare!""**

Rarely, if ever, have I seen real life social interactions play out where one person wants to get together and forge a friendship basically and the other person is like, aw thanks but I'm good. It's like there are no scripts for it, as if it's not normal/acceptable.

I'm a solitary person and don't want to spend extra 1-on-1 time with most people. Yet I've still been going along with people who are really draining and mismatched for me all because *they* want to go for coffee, go for lunch, talk on the phone, have ongoing text conversations, etc. I'm in my mid 30s now and asking myself, WHEN am I going to stop! I DID stop, but then it all started up again because I've had to be around so many people this past year for various reasons.

It's often hard for me NOT to go along because it's difficult to say no directly and still be on good, friendly terms... or say no indirectly and then try to evade plans forever. It's made me resent how I am when I'm with people because it makes them want to establish more of a relationship with me. And then I'm like, ""Oh crap. That's not what I meant by any of this."" (even though the person can be totally great! I just have no room and need all the compatibility and right elements to enjoy the relationship and get something out of it because simply socializing is not usually innately rewarding.)

It's also hard to say no because forging connection here-there-everywhere seems to be so foundational in society. So it's like the way the current is flowing. They're the ones being normal, meanwhile I'm on the other end of the spectrum. And being that way is foreign to some. Like I don't think it ever crosses their mind.

And it feels rude to be friendly when around people, accidentally giving them the wrong impression just by having a good conversation with them (because that's all it takes for some people to feel like the 2 of you are friends, which is a quality I admire and probably had more of when I was younger), and then do an about-face (in their eyes) like, ""no I'd rather not to do more things with you or spend any of my spare time on you.""

To say no is received as rejection, not seen as innate preference and wiring that isn't personal. And so I struggle, because I'm not trying to say NO to them as a human. I'm not trying to say, ""I don't like you."" I'm trying to say, ""I only have room to invest in like 3 relationships, and I really can't help it."" But it seems like you can't turn down the development of further friendship without them receiving a negative message.

All of this to say, ""no"" doesn't feel at all like a *neutral* thing to say. Turning people down doesn't leave everything feeling fine and still at the same level of harmony for all. ""No"" feels weird and not ok. It feels like you're bafflingly shutting the door in someone's friendly, kind, hopeful face. So of course it's hard to say, and this whole predicament leaves me feeling edgy around people and disempowered and like the boundaries I need are constantly being infringed upon by all the normal people, and to uphold my boundaries I have to be a bad guy to good people.

But here's how I cancelled a recent dinner meet up with someone (someone who regularly texts me, ""HELLOOO are you dead?"" when I don't reply to texts in a day):

*Actually I'm finding myself spread really thin right now so another time would be better. As an introvert, I need to have energy to spare in order to socialize, so people time is best for me when I have enough extra energy!*

That might sound cringy, I don't know. But my thinking here is this: I believe one big problem has been almost pretending I'm not the way I am, which never solves the fundamental miscommunication of energy styles. I'm bright and shiny in person and in my communication. And people assume I'm a non-asocial human who's just kind of turned out to be inconsistent and rude by dropping the ball a lot.

And it's actually just hard for some people to understand unless you explain to them that interacting takes a lot of energy, and so you have to have some to spare in order to be social. Naming the wiring is a way of saying: I'm not experiencing life the way you are, and my No's are not personal.

What kinds of things have you learned to say to protect your time and space from enthusiastic people who hope to connect and don't understand that you'd rather sit in a dark room alone than make friends and plans?

1oc4ehq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oc4ehq,Montale Intense Café or Mancera's Coco Vanille ?,"I'm a proper gourmand and sweet scent lover! Roses, milk coffee, floral, coconut are my signature scents. I have tried both above mentioned scents, Coco Vanille I have had purchased a decant and Intense Café is what I tried at an outlet in London. 

Intense Café is what I remember evoked sensual warmth and it's like stepping into a Parisian Café where air is filled with coffee, rose syrup and amber sweetness. It projected crazy and lasted literally 10+ hours. 

Coco Vanille is like golden skin, warm cozy and bit sensual. Tropical in nature and very coconuty! Feels like applying those luxe lotion while relaxing on a sunshine beach. Again being from mancera it projects very good and lasts 8-10 hours. 

Now I wanna get a full bottle of anyone of the above but since I have likings for both I'm not able to make my mind. If anyone of you have used them or can give me a third angle view, would be great to make my final call.

Back in college, me and my cousin used to run on instant coffee, deadlines, and regret. Half the time, coffee didn’t even work — either too weak or straight-up stomach pain 💀

So we ended up creating something called Dosed — a zero-sugar energy drink mix that actually tastes like juice and gives clean, crash-free energy. Not a gym bro preworkout, just something that helps you function better through your day — classes, fests, work, whatever.

Now we’re looking for college students in Kerala who get what we’re trying to do — people who can make fun, creative stuff like memes, reels, or UGC content that feels real, not ad-agency fake.

It’s a paid gig, but more than that, we want people who think creatively and want to be part of building something new.
We want Dosed to be for energy drinks what Canva became for design — something easy, relatable, and made by the same people who actually use it.

If you’re into content creation, fitness, or just like experimenting with ideas, drop a comment or DM me.

I can’t seem to appreciate the ordinary. A cup of coffee? It’s nice, but forgettable. A nap on the weekend? I always have one. Chatting with coworkers about office gossip? I get it, we all need to vent but I just can’t care enough.

It’s not that I want to feel grand or special. I don’t need to be the hero of my story. I just can’t stand the idea of life feeling ordinary. Because once it does, it feels plain, boring, and meaningless.It eats at me.

This tiny hilltop village above the Mirna Valley is one of Croatia’s most atmospheric inland stops — a living art colony wrapped in cobbled streets, blue shutters, and endless views.

https://preview.redd.it/ylwbqo8078uf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f5d403ac00309228991262ffc2b03d888dd1c8b8

Grožnjan has been known as the “town of artists” since the 1960s, when painters and musicians began restoring its empty stone houses. Today, studios, galleries, and music schools fill every corner. From May to October, it hums with creative energy: the sound of violins floating from windows, easels in doorways, and evening concerts on the Belvedere Terrace. July brings **Jazz is Back! BP**, a free open-air festival that turns the whole town into a stage. Late summer adds **Ex Tempore**, an art event that covers the streets with paintings and sculptures.

Beyond the art, Grožnjan rewards slow travel. It’s small enough to explore in a few hours but rich in details. Wander its twisting alleys, peek into ateliers, and pause for a view over the Mirna Valley. The surrounding hills hold olive groves and vineyards, producing Istria’s classic flavors — golden olive oils, crisp **Malvazija** whites, bold **Teran** reds, and the world-famous truffles from nearby Livade.

If you like light adventure, walk or cycle a section of the **Parenzana**, a former narrow-gauge railway turned greenway linking Trieste and Poreč. The stretch around Grožnjan is one of the prettiest: tunnels, stone cuttings, and wide valley views. Bring a headlamp for the tunnels and enjoy the mild grade — it’s perfect for families or casual riders.

Grožnjan is easy to reach by car from Istria’s coast. Umag, Novigrad, and Poreč are all within an hour, making it a great half-day or full-day trip. Pair it with **Motovun** or **Oprtalj**, two other hill towns nearby, for a loop through Istria’s quiet interior. Parking is outside the old core — the center is car-free — so wear shoes with grip for the cobblestones.

Plan to visit between May and October, when studios and music programs are in full swing. Spring and autumn bring mild weather, open trails, and fewer crowds. In winter, the rhythm slows, but the views stay timeless.

Whether you come for art, jazz, or food, Grožnjan’s charm lies in its scale. There are no big sights to tick off, just small, genuine moments: a painter at work, the echo of a saxophone, or the golden light on stone at sunset. Buy a small artwork, sip coffee on a terrace, taste truffles and wine, and let time stretch.

It’s one of those places where you don’t need a plan — just curiosity and a free afternoon. And when you leave, with Malvazija on your lips and music still in your ears, you’ll understand why Grožnjan feels like the soul of Istria.

I am still somewhat functioning in a demanding position at work. It’s mainly work that creates my stress or it manifests through work related issues.

I’m in a pretty tough place now and seeking my way out. One area of improvement are my mornings. I really can’t get myself to start any better habits.

Here is is in all its gruesome today:
-I wake up around 5am as some work staff starts to run in my head.
-I try to overcome the thoughts and get back to sleep but the anxiety starts to build up
-eventually around 7 I am lying in bed completely anxiety ridden
-I force myself up to bathroom and brush my teeth
-I grab my phone to try and escape the thoughts somehow
-I crawl to the sofa and drink a mug of coffee while scrolling phone
-I put on clothes and run to the office
-feeling tired, busy, anxious 
-I try and get my act together when I arrive at work.

Now considering I am in a bad place, where could I start. Should I am for habits to be present with the feelings or should I aim for a more activity based morning to keep myself busy? 

Let me know if you have any tips or similar stories to share.

In a short summary he hurt me and offended me in ways I can never forgive. He was also the type that didn't respect when I told him I was demisexual and for me to be interested in him and to have a sexual relationship with him was unique.

But of course, once he hurt me and i realised I could never ever connect with this guy long term because of our mismatches in fundamental parts of our way of being and the way our lives are lead I've lost all attraction for him altogether. None. Not interested at all.

Now he's back talking to me he of course is trying to meet me 'just for coffee' and 'I messed up' and he's trying to butter me up with being overly complimentary.

What is the West Coast Express and why riders love it

The West Coast Express is Metro Vancouver’s commuter train that helps riders cruise into downtown Vancouver without battling traffic or juggling bus transfers. 

Grab a comfy seat, sip your coffee and enjoy the scenic ride while the train does all the work.

It runs weekdays during rush hours: 

westbound into Vancouver in the morning and eastbound in the evening. It connects communities like Mission, Maple Ridge, and Port Coquitlam to Waterfront Station in the heart of downtown.

Inside, it’s a quieter, more relaxed ride. You’ll find spacious seats, quiet cars and room for bikes. It’s not a high-speed bullet train, but it’s smooth, scenic, and surprisingly chill, especially compared to Highway 1 at rush hour.

Think of it as Vancouver’s calm, scenic and slightly fancy way to commute.

Like what?? And then when my friend (who I’ve known since we were both like 10) turned up and then they all started talking to her and with eachother and acting normal with me?

What is the West Coast Express and why riders love it

The West Coast Express is Metro Vancouver’s commuter train that helps riders cruise into downtown Vancouver without battling traffic or juggling bus transfers. 

Grab a comfy seat, sip your coffee and enjoy the scenic ride while the train does all the work.

It runs weekdays during rush hours: 

westbound into Vancouver in the morning and eastbound in the evening. It connects communities like Mission, Maple Ridge, and Port Coquitlam to Waterfront Station in the heart of downtown.

Inside, it’s a quieter, more relaxed ride. You’ll find spacious seats, quiet cars and room for bikes. It’s not a high-speed bullet train, but it’s smooth, scenic, and surprisingly chill, especially compared to Highway 1 at rush hour.

Think of it as Vancouver’s calm, scenic and slightly fancy way to commute.

1oc3u3z,https://youtu.be/i9flhhwkTTA,"“Well, that outta do it.”","# I did something stupid last week. Stupid and a little bit lucky. For Christmas i got my wife a fire table. Its one of those outdoor coffee tables with a strip down the middle for a gas fire. It was a little more than I wanted to spend but she had been asking for one for some time. It's designed for a simple propane tank hookup but comes with a conversion kit to use your house’s natural gas. Thinking it doesn’t make much sense to be replacing the tank all the time, I wanted to go the natural gas route. I decided that since I have absolutely no experience with gas hook-ups or simply anything that comes out of a pipe, I would get a plumber to do the work. But when the plumber gave me a quote, my cheap ass decided I could do this myself (could?). Days after following the instructions and hooking this massive table up to the detonator, I decided to sit on the deck and watch the stars by the fire. Minutes later while relaxing with my feet up on the table the flame suddenly goes out then the whole thing jumps 6 inches off the ground. Fortunately my wife was putting our oldest to bed so it was just me out there but I wasn’t sober which made the experience all that more scary. It reminded me of an explosion that caught Butch by surprise (“Well that oughta do it”). Thinking back on both scenes just cracks me up.",1,1761021919.0,MatineeMovieScenes,0,1.0,False

long story short, one of my friends was evicted and realized they couldn't give the proper care to their boy, and hence, called me. I absolutely said yes i would take him, and we've spent close to two weeks trying to find a shelter or another home that might be able to take him! But alas, i think i am his new home.

I've really come to love him, so I have no issues with it. But I've never personally owned smaller rodents because of their smell. (Literally the only reason.) I have SEVERE sensory issues and having ""my scent"" in my room be disrupted (permanently) sends me into a panic attack. Like, if my room doesn't smell like me then the world is clearly ending. (I'm sorry if that makes no sense!)

So, how do you guys keep the scent under control? I of course expect some, it's unavoidable, but how do you keep it as contained as possible? I've heard having baking soda or coffee grounds near it (outside the enclosure) helps, or an air purifier. I just don't want to use something unsafe because I am still learning and didn't have ample research time like I normally do.

I was out at a bar with some of my guy friends after a work dinner. Saw this lady glance at me. Went up to her chatted her up and asked for her number all this was very plutonic and not romantic in any sense. 

I then played it really cool and all my initial texts were very plutonic. Asked to meet her for coffee which turned to dinner and drinks. All throughout the night played it very cool no intention or romantic interest intended…but I was attentive and listened and really conversed well…helps I am naturally a little funny. Had an excuse to stay out till late…so no suspicion.

Booked another dinner since we vibed and half way through the night once we had a great time and some drinks in us I became brutally honest. Told her about the sparks between us she expressed she was single and I explained my situation and asked her if she would be willing to be my AP and be discreet. I let her mull it over and didn’t message her after that for a few days. Reached out setup another meet and she said yes

Now we are few months in going strong. She is extremely discreet understands my situation and loves it. The sex is amazing partly because of its forbidden nature. 

Now note: Helps that I am a good looking dude. I am 8 years younger than her and am blessed and good in bed. We have already agreed when she gets in a relationship we will continue to see each other as that would make the sex even hotter. 

I never thought I would be in a situation like this or even had it in me but goddamit The sex is phenomenal.

1oc3pmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/tron/comments/1oc3pmb/the_recycled_plot_was_the_worst_part_of_ares/,The recycled plot was the worst part of Ares,"Soundtrack? A deviation from the grandeur orchestral flavours of Legacy, but makes sense since the movie originates from the Dillinger systems. It's harder, it's industrial, it's rough, and it fucks like an animal.

Visuals? Stunning. Dillinger system in eternal darkness with angry reds and oranges matches perfectly the soundtrack (or is it the other way around?). The utopic sights of the ENCOM system in daylight and blue are beautiful. The old grid is a classic, and I appreciate the effort of replicating it first before trying to build something new on top of it (the gray filter and how the red pops is so good).

Action scenes? Visual effects? Sound mixing? Incredible (though that last one was a bit too loud for my sensitive ears).

Acting? Adequate at worst. My only negative highlights are how bland Evan Peters was, >!even as he was mourning his mother!<, and how Leto doesn't emote that much, pretty single note though the movie (though I guess it is in character for him to be so, since he wasn't coded to emote).

But the story is just... Something we have seen a million times before. Recycled over and over: they race for a thingamajig that the evil guy wants, and in his chase he bites more than he can chew, his servant sort of betrays him, and then they both get nothing and even lose more, while the good guys survive and... That's it.

It's so hollow. It's great visuals, stunning scenes, amazing music, but just... Empty. LEGACY at least had an emotional plot of a son and a father reuniting after so many years missing, and it gets emotional. It speaks of sacrifice for something bigger than yourself, not Flynn's legacy as the one that discovered the grid and wanted to bring something good out of it, but of his son. LEGACY has a heart!

Ares has no heart. Even its one call to Frankenstein's monster is just... Lacking resolution. Sure, on the literal reading of the meaning, the creator gets betrayed by his creation and whatever. But the monster wanted to be something more than the monster society saw him as, even though he WAS a monster. And honestly, either the script or Leto didn't really bring that forward to be felt. Frankenstein's monster is a tragic creature, Ares is just a badass bad guy turned good.

I came into the movie holding all of my expectations BACK. I cleared my mind of the love I had for LEGACY, and I rewatched Tron '82 to have a full appreciation of the entire filmography thus far. And though I appreciated all the references to the previous two movies (huge face communicating with a program, the coffee cup, the Ducati bike, the Akira slide, the blocky absorption into the grid, the bit, the 90-degree turn bikes on the old grid, and so on), and I could see that the movie was properly written as a sequel to the '82 film more so than to Legacy, I came out of the theatre sour.

I just wish Disney could see more in Tron than just cool-neon-cyberpunky-gamer-whatever aesthetics, and could TRY to deliver something as punchy as Uprising. End of line.",0,1761021496.0,tron,2,0.44,False

I've been through a long term on-off abusive relationship. For the past decade, that relationship was all that i knew. I've done the healing, I've done the learning, the unlearning, the correcting, and everything in between. The journey wasn't easy and I know I'm still not perfect. I've grown a lot since the horrible break up, though. 

Recently I decided to open my heart again and I met this wonderful woman. She was younger than me but we had pretty much the same interests and lifestyle. It also helped that we were on the same industry. We bonded well together. Problem is she lives on the other end of the country. Luckily i still got to see her. I cooked for her and got her coffee. She was the sweetest, kindest, most respectful person I've ever met. We pushed each other to be better. She showed me what real kindness was. She made me feel like I was enough.. actually, no. She made me feel like i was the best. It was something I never felt before. 

Sadly, all good things in my life have to come to an end. She had to leave. She was burnt out and tired with her personal life and had to take a break. Of course I can't stop her. I love her enough to want her to be at her 100%. She said I shouldn't wait for her because it will only be a burden for the both of us. She also wasn't sure about ""us"" which I get because of the distance. She then deactivated all her socials and that was the end of it. There was no goodbye. 

I would still want to wait. We were never together and it was such a short time that i knew her. But that 2 months felt like a year of happiness and adventure. But like, will she get back to me? I don't know. 

I'm lying on my bed here again hungover from all the drinking last night and now getting ready to face yet another cycle of healing. Although this time there's no anger, no hate, no negativity. It was all love, respect, and kindess from beginning to the end. It was something i never knew existed. That's why it stings so bad. For once in my life someone treated me so well but she had to leave all of a sudden. Of course I'm thankful for her. I will treasure that forever. 

I'm just tired of all the ups and downs this year. My head and my heart can't keep up. I still believe in love. I haven't given up at all. I'm just exhausted. ",3,1761020977.0,OffMyChestPH,3,1.0,False

1oc3jpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1oc3jpr/night_school/,Night School,"I don’t go to regular school anymore.
I go to night school.

It’s different from other schools. The lights are always dim here, or they just feel that way. Everything smells like the lemon wipes Mom uses to clean the tables at home. My teacher is always nice to me. Her clothes make swishing sounds when she walks over. She asks how I’m feeling and writes things on her clipboard. I tell her I’m okay so she won’t worry too much.

The desks here are strange. They can lean forward or lie flat depending on which buttons I press. There’s this one button that’s harder to push. It made everyone rush into my room. Mom cried a lot after that, so I don’t press it anymore. 

There aren’t many kids in night school, just me and this Boy from the other room. He always seems so happy. He talks with the teachers a lot. Once, we met in the hallway during sunlight time.

“What’s your favorite color?” he asked.

My Mom held me from behind and I turned my head to her. 

“Green,” I replied to him.

Mom likes green too.

There are a lot of things I miss from regular school. I miss the food there. The food here tastes like nothing. Even the cookies and apple juice Mom bought aren't as sweet. I smile anyway, so she won’t feel bad.

My teacher said my friends can’t visit me because it’s not safe. That’s okay. They have their own classes to go to. But sometimes I imagine them walking into my room to surprise me.

Mom stays beside me most of the time. She pretends to read, but she flips the pages too fast. Dad visits too, but not as often because he has to “work extra.” When he does come, he smells like coffee and the outside. I love that smell. It makes me feel like I’m free and healthy again.

Dad tells me many stories, from the things he sees on his way to work, the bakery near our house, to the tree in our yard that we planted together. The one that stopped growing. He said that every morning, he checks on it and finds new leaves. I try to picture all of it, but my head gets tired and I fall asleep.

The lessons here are strange. I learn to lie very still while machines click around me. I learn to count while my teacher guides my breathing. We practice being brave, that’s when they bring the needles, and Mom squeezes my hand until the lesson is over. They say I’m doing great. I like when they say that.

There’s one teacher I don’t like. His hands are bigger and stronger than the others. He tells me to count backwards, and I try, but the numbers get slippery when I’m tired.

In night school, there’s this thing called graduation. No one tells me what it means, but it’s when kids leave and don’t come back. Some get better. Some don’t.

Last week, the Boy from the other room graduated. I don’t hear him anymore and he’s never in the hallway. I asked Mom about him, and she kissed my forehead and said he got better and went home.

Mom’s been quieter lately. She holds my hand longer, even when I’m just resting. Her hand feels thinner. I told her that when I graduate, I want to be brave and happy like the Boy. She didn’t answer. She just kept holding my hand.

I miss seeing her face. I’m starting to forget what she looks like.

I think my graduation is coming soon. That’s okay. I like to think that after I graduate, I can finally see again.

Because at night school, if you listen very carefully, you can hear the other kids who already graduated.

They’re laughing and whispering to each other about how they could finally play in the sun outside again.",1,1761020941.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1oc3jmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1oc3jmv/my_crazy_experience_on_the_carnival_radiance_and/,My crazy experience on the Carnival Radiance and my review of the ship,"At around 2-3AM on our first night, another passenger on our floor was loudly getting violent with his girlfriend, slamming her against the door, and she was screaming. 
It woke up my brother in law down the hall. He opened his door, and there was a bunch of people peeping out their doors. He asked where it was coming from and in unison everyone pointed to the door. He went and knocked on the door and told the guy to take it easy and that security was on the way. (Security had been called by others but they hadn’t showed yet)
The guy(is HUGE) comes out with his fists up and punches my brother in law in the face, also clipping my mother in law’s arm. They ended up pinned on the floor and then about 10 or so security gaurds showed up to pull them apart. 
(The commotion in the hallway woke me and my partner up and we came out to this chaos)
They took statements, and took the other guy away to a different room, and his girl separately. Turns out he broke the Tv in his room and there was broken glass everywhere in the room. 
Even though they had like 1 drink in the beginning of the day and that was it, my brother and mother in law were both banned from drinking the remainder of the cruise because of their involvement in the incident, and got letters after the cruise that they were banned from Carnival. LOL
They saw the other guy around the cruise for the rest of the weekend too, so he wasn’t kicked off or anything. 

That was our crazy experience, here is my review on the rest of the cruise: 

Guy’s burgers, shaqs chicken, and the pizza were decent. The buffet food and main dining room food was mostly awful. Service at MDR was good on the first night and then the following nights it seemed to get slower and slower. 
We paid for ramen at the sushi restaurant which ended up being our favorite thing we ate on the ship.

My favorite part of our cruise was the comedy club. It’s super cute in there and we really enjoyed the first comedian we watched (18+show). The second comedian was funny too but darker I would say lol. I can’t remember either of their names though. 

Our on-demand movies weren’t working the first night, it was late when we called so they couldn’t fix it until the following day. The Tv has like 7 channels and there’s about 7 free on-demand movies

The specialty coffee spot ~ the coffee was honestly gross and the guy working was super rude. The free coffee was better. 

There was a lot of “sales” driven activities.

The layout of the ship was hard to navigate and we got lost a couple of times.

The arcade was fun, and I enjoyed the chilli peppers penny slots in the casino.

The mini golf was terrible. The wholes aren’t deep enough so the ball just goes rolling away.

The “adults only” escape was a nice place to post up with a book in the mornings. 
Other times, it could get crowded and the bartender there was rude.
Other than that bartender and the coffee guy, the rest of the staff on board was really nice. And the housekeeper coordinator for our floor was awesome. I think his name was Greg. 

There was a weird smell in the halls sometimes, and some leakage in the hallway on our floor. 

Overall, I had some fun and enjoyed the ocean views and our morning in Ensenada with fresh and delicious seafood. But I don’t see myself cruising with Carnival again.

i guess it suffers from the fact it requires coffee that is still full of the trapped roasting gasses - roasted to at least full city - and roughly between 4 and 12 days old.

i might make a video to post here. i see this technique being done by youtubers with coffee that is not gassy enough for it to work well.

I've plotted the Frequency of enemies by type that have a given poise using the base game spreadsheet at [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BVwmKqB8pvuyJkSTGYOM2kAJxFMQ0jVsc6aKYz\_Upes/edit?gid=0#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BVwmKqB8pvuyJkSTGYOM2kAJxFMQ0jVsc6aKYz_Upes/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

How would you use this? Well between the fextra wiki and this old spreadsheet..... [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1j4bpTbsnp5Xsgw9TP2xv6d8R4qk0ErpE9r\_5LGIDraU/htmlview#gid=1512110930](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1j4bpTbsnp5Xsgw9TP2xv6d8R4qk0ErpE9r_5LGIDraU/htmlview#gid=1512110930)

We can see great hammer stamp upper (42) should break poise on \~54% of mob types.  
Or stamp upper claymore (33) + 1h charged R2 (33) = 66. therefore poise break for 75% of mob types.

At least that's how I'm understanding poise calculations at the moment. Useful? or does this exist elsewhere?

Day 1:
Admitted to pre-op around 9a and went in for XLIF at 10:45. Surgery was less than an hour. Went for CT scan and X-rays about 2pm to check placement and see if I needed anything else and Dr called around 4:30 to tell me that he wanted to put a stabilizer in on Tuesday.  Pain level around a 3 - really only felt it when I needed the bathroom. 

Day 2: 
Went to pre-op around 8:30, didn’t really feel any pain from the XLIF prob about 2. At this point I just wasn’t in any pain. Went to surgery around 10, I think it lasted about 2 hours, but not at all sure. The procedure was called “posterior decompression & robotic fusion”. I woke up at about a 9 on the pain level… so this was much worse - probably because they actually had to cut muscle. 

Day 3:
Still around a 9 for pain, passed OT &  PT tests.. no problems climbing stairs or walking. Went home early afternoon.

Day 4:
Laid in bed all day - husband was at work (10 minutes away) - so I got a lot of snoozing time. Around lunchtime the pain kicked to about a 10 - the meds were not doing anything to touch it. Call Dr, they gave me Percocet - I had had Vicodin - and that change made a lot of difference. Also told me I could use celebrex for inflammation. 

Day 5:
Slept in, pain had subsided to about a 4… finally took a shower and put on real clothes. Daughter came home from college for a long weekend. 

Day 6:
Sleep sleep sleep! Pain was about a 2/3 - Percocet was working. Then took my kids to dinner - used a walker, didn’t really need it. Right as we were paying I got a super intensive chill that would not go away. Got home, changed and wrapped in blankets - then felt much better. The pain was also so that I didn’t feel anything when I was laying in bed or walking - just when I had to adjust myself. 

Day 7:
Still mildly painful when moving around, but daughter was leaving to go back to school so went downstairs and had coffee with her.. the pain got better during the day.  Dr called to check in and I forgot to mention the chills. Husband and son went to a neighborhood party. Sometime in early evening I felt warm - took my temp, it was 100.3, so called husband home to get me the paperwork and I realized I should have told him about the chills. Temp never went above 100.3, so I was fine there, and my incisions looked fine.. 

Day 8:
Husband went to work early and was supposed to come back mid morning to take our son to work (school holiday) but he lost track of time, so I drove my son to a halfway point - my last dose of meds had been at 2 am and it was nearing 11, so I was okay to drive that short distance, but prob shouldn’t have. It totally exhausted me.  Spent the rest of the day in bed, which is where I’ve been except for short walks around the house. But! Pain never got above a 1 today - and even a 1 is exaggerated. Hopefully the pain stays away. I started weaning off the Percocet - hoping to be on straight Tylenol only for pain by Thursday. 

Happy to answer any questions that I may have missed in my summary… will update in a few days.",3,1761020423.0,spinalfusion,0,0.81,False
