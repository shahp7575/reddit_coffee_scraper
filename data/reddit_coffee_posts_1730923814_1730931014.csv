Those who wish to experience similar, if not identical, results without the prescription and side effects have turned to high-quality Phentermine alternatives. Here, we review the best alternatives to Phentermine in 2024, all from natural active ingredients available over-the-counter and proven to be very effective in weight loss by enhancing metabolism, suppressing appetite, and enhancing energy.

  
[**PhenQ is ideal for you if you're done with diet pills that promise the moon and deliver only side effects.**](https://www.wb22trk.com/XR12ZC/BP658/?uid=2344)

**Why Consider Phentermine Alternatives?**  
  
Phentermine is effective for weight loss but isn't suitable for everyone because of its potential side effects, such as increased heart rate, anxiety, and sleep issues. Besides that fact, Phentermine is not indicated for long-term use. Fortunately, natural over-the-counter alternatives can offer similar weight-loss benefits without the unwanted effects or prescription requirement.  
How Do Phentermine Alternatives Work?  
  
Most of the Phentermine alternatives employ natural ingredients to provide identical weight-loss results like that of Phentermine.  
  
Appetite Suppression: It reduces appetite, hence making it easier to control calorie intake.  
Boosted Metabolism: Leads the way for the body to start burning more calories by using the fat reserves.  
Increased Energy: Energy which surely will act as a catalyst and not allow tiredness during workouts.  
  
Top Phentermine Alternatives in 2024  
1. PhenQ

Benefits: Suppresses appetite, amplifies metabolism, boosts mood.  
For whom: Great for both men and women who are looking for an all-in-one weight loss supplement.

2. PhenGold  
  
PhenGold is an intense, multi-action fat burner that suppresses your appetite, reduces cravings for food, and revs up the metabolism. Its all-natural formula features extracts from green tea, green coffee bean, and the amino acid L-theanine, which work together in a self-synergetic manner to support fat loss, focus, and mood.  
  
Pros: All-natural ingredients, fat loss focus, energy boost. Who Is It For: Anybody that likes taking all-natural supplements. Possible Drawback: May take a little longer to work due to different tolerances.

Cons: Must be taken each day continually.  
  
4. PrimeShred  
  
PrimeShred is suitable for any one who would like to have an extreme feeling of fat burning because of thermogenic and energy-enhancing compounds combined in it. If one is focused on observing noticeable fat loss and muscle definition, then green tea extract, cayenne pepper, and caffeine make the right combination in this vitamin supplement.  
  
Benefits: Strong thermogenic effect, energy boost.  
For: Anyone who wants to lose fat and define muscle mass.  
Possible Red Flag: May not suit those too sensitive to caffeine, due to the high amount used.

Yerba mate, guarana, and damiana are all key ingredients in its formula and are known for their appetitive-reducing properties, which help in metabolism.

Possible Con: Results may show up much later compared to the rest of the supplements in this review. How to Choose the Best Phentermine Alternative  
  
To find the perfect alternative to Phentermine, consider your goals on weight loss, possible caffeine stimulant sensitivity, and active ingredients that fit into your lifestyle. Some general recommendations are outlined below:All-around support: PhenQ  
Caffeine-free options: Leanbean  
Natural formula: PhenGold  
Intense fat burning: PrimeShred  
Appetite control: Zotrim  
  
Safety and Possible Side Effects  
  
While alternatives to Phentermine are generally safe and of a natural origin, they can also cause side effects in people who are sensitive to stimulants.

Will we ever get back together again?,"I have anxious attachement style, with abusive family history and trauma but I've always tried to live a normal life, I have a job I look good I'm healthy and try not to dwelve too much in the past. But my boyfriend or ex for that matter doesn't know about my past.

Our relationship was good mostly, but when he would take too much time to reply to me I would start panicking or when he didn't pick up my calls immediately. Or when he would like other girls picture on instagram, even tough he follows only people he knows and they follow him back. I'm not insecure about how I look, he actually took an interest in me in the beginning because of my looks, but I've always found the liking of other girls picture while in a relationship as a sign of disrespect.  And I would also panick when he didn't say goodnight wich wasn't often but I found it odd that it always happened when he had a ""guy's night"" wich mostly involved gaming or football. 

 He was always the nonchalant type, very easy-going, calm, and hated drama and arguments and especially hated when I got angry with him. Last time I got very upset because he canceled our date night because he wanted to delay it  to watch a formula 1 live transmission of wich he is a massive fan since forever. He broke up with me told me can't have a future with an angry woman and told me I need to make myself happy first and then be in a relationship. Also he never was the type to plan a date, get me flowers unless I told him so but he said this is because he simply isn't the type to do so.

We ve had fights like these before but he would always come back to me the next day and make up.

Ever since we ve been texting back and forth, he would only text me if I texted him, told him I'm sorry I want him back but he refused to make up or to meet up.

3 days later I told him I want him to help me choose my new eyeglasses and he accepted to meet-up. He then invited me to go shopping for something, grab some coffee and eat for which he paid. Then I told him I want to try to make myself happy and finally go to the gym as he had always suggested. He even bought me gym shoes that day and told me he will come to my gym and show me how to use the equipment. At the end of the meet-up  I hugged him and told him I missed him and then he said he misses me too. 

I don't know if it means anything as he has always remained in good terms with ex girlfriends but do you think there is a chance he will want to be together again?",1,1730930800.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Like, we all know it’s not just about sending proposals into the void. So, what secret (or just weirdly specific) metrics are you tracking to really gauge if you’re winning on Upwork year over year?

And yes, I know *earnings* is the obvious one. But I’m talking about the little things, like:

* **Average Project Value** – Aka, “Am I moving up the freelance food chain, or still working for coffee money?”
* **Client Retention Rate** – A fancy way of asking, “Do clients actually like me enough to come back, or am I the one-hit wonder of freelancers?”
* **Hourly Rate Progression** – Like a fitness tracker, but for my wallet. Are clients willing to pay me more over time, or am I just forever ‘affordable’?
* **Proposal-to-Interview Ratio** – Because if I’m writing 20 proposals and getting ghosted, maybe my pitch needs a glow-up.
* **Profile Views** – *Did that one tiny profile tweak make me Upwork-famous yet?*

So, what off-the-wall metrics do you all look at? Bonus points if you’ve got some quirky tricks for landing great clients without burning out on proposals. And feel free to say *earnings*—I get it.",1,1730930730.0,Upwork,0,1.0,False

I got this idea from a comic in this Subreddit, which I have a hard time finding now. Golconde isn't narrating this time because he himself appears in the story.

\-----

That day was like any other day. I had spent the morning filing paperwork at SCHALE, visited the Foreclosure Task Force in the afternoon, teaching the Make-Up Work Club in the evening, and played with the Game Development Department until late at night.

I fell asleep at the Game Development Department clubroom. However, when I woke up, I realized I was sleeping on the bench in a public park, as opposed to the sofa in the Game Development Department clubroom.

Sensei: (Where am I? Why did I wake up on a bench?)

Spontaneously, I took out the Shittim Chest and turned it on. Immediately, I noticed something was very off.

Sensei: Arona?

The Shittim Chest’s user interface looked very different. It didn’t have the typical logo and Arona was nowhere to be seen. It looked like a regular tablet. Actually, since it was nothing like the Shittim Chest apart from outer appearance, it would be more accurate to say it was just a regular tablet.

Sensei: Plana?

I tried calling out to Plana, hoping she might be there, but no answer came. Confused, but not alarmed, I opened the navigation app in the tablet to look up the way back to SCHALE and the train schedule. That was when I noticed that the calendar was off.

Sensei: (Hold on, why is the year…?)

The year displayed in the calendar was not the year it should have been. The year indicated was nearly a decade before I woke up at the General Student Council.

Sensei: (Hold on, is the calendar mistaken? I couldn’t have time traveled, could I?)

I looked at the settings and found out the displayed date and time was automatically set. In other words, unless something is wrong with the universal time in the internet, the tablet’s calendar should be correct.

Sensei: (No, that can’t be possible, can it?)

Unwilling to believe it, I went to a local convenience store to buy a newspaper or magazine to check the year. I somehow had my credit card with me, though I wondered whether my credit card could be used in the case that I really traveled back in time.

Convenience store clerk: A newspaper and a small bag of hot taiyaki. Is there anything else you’d like?

Sensei: No, that’s enough. I’ll pay with my credit card.

Convenience store clerk: Thank you for your purchase. Please come again.

I went to the same park bench I woke up on and read the newspaper as I ate the taiyaki. The newspaper clearly indicated I traveled back in time. Even online news sites displayed the same year. I had to accept it, I traveled back in time.

I needed to figure out what to do next. Going to the General Student Council was one option. I would be able to meet the GSC president. The only problem was that there was a chance none of them could recognize me. SCHALE didn’t even exist yet. How could I explain myself?

Just as I was deep in thought, I realized a small girl looking at me with drool in her mouth staring at me. She had dirty and tattered clothes, probably a vagrant and an orphan. The smell of taiyaki must have attracted her.

Sensei: Little girl, are you hungry?

The little girl nodded without saying anything. I gave her some of my taiyaki. She happily ate it. I then realized who she might be. White wings, yellow halo with a flower motif. There could be no mistaking it. This girl was Azusa, though much younger and smaller.

Sensei: Little girl, what’s your name?

Azusa: My name is Shirasu Azusa.

Sensei: Where do you come from?

Azusa: I’m from the Arius autonomous district.

Seeing the younger Azusa made my heart flutter. She was adorable, but more importantly, still innocent. She’s not the girl who was broken down by Beatrice. It made me wonder how the Arius Squad looked like, all young and innocent.

Thinking about the Arius Squad and Azusa made me wonder, has Beatrice taken control of the Arius Branch School yet? If she hasn’t, then I can maybe go to the Arius Branch School to prevent that from ever happening.

Becoming the headmaster of the Arius Branch School doesn’t sound so bad. I will be able to give the girls from Arius a proper life, one without hatred or suffering. I can potentially give these girls a brighter future.

Besides, I have a feeling I can get their trust by bribing them with food, unlike students from other schools, whom I suspect will treat me with suspicion as an unknown adult in Kivotos.

Sensei: Azusa, can you bring me to the Arius autonomous district?

Azusa: I sure can! But what do you want to do there, Mister?

Sensei: I’d like to give you and your friends food to eat.

Azusa: Really!? Then let’s go quickly, Mister!

Sensei: Please call me Sensei.

With that, I follow Azusa back to Arius autonomous district, only stopping to buy food at a convenience store to feed the Arius girls.

Working to rebuild the Arius Branch School was a herculean task. In fact, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say it’s harder than working at SCHALE. I never realized the number of things working in the background to keep a district alive. The work at the Arius Branch School made me appreciate them.

Gaining the trust of the Arius girls was not hard, and neither was preventing the internal conflict that would allow Beatrice to take control over Arius later on, but that was just the beginning of a path of difficulties. I had to rebuild the Arius autonomous district by myself.

To begin with, I needed to fix the infrastructure and buildings of the Arius Branch School. That’s easier said than done. Pretty much everything was dilapidated. We had to rebuild everything from the ground up. The dorm, the campus, the field, the pool, and so many more.

Next, I had to prepare study materials for the Arius girls. This shouldn’t have been so hard, but it was hard because I was the sole teacher and staff member of the Arius Branch School. That means I had to write all the homework and test myself, teach every lesson to every class, and the list goes on.

As if that wasn’t enough, I had to secure a source of fund for reconstruction too. The Arius girls are either orphans or come from a poor family, and the Arius district’s economy is too weak for anything, so I had to look for investments and slowly revitalize the economy of the Arius district.

I have never underestimated any of Hina’s work, nor have I ever thought that Yuuka’s work is a simple task, but I never truly understood their work until I became the headmaster of the Arius Satellite School. If I ever meet them again, I need to give both of them applause for their thankless work.

???: Sensei?

Sensei: Wha…? Who’s there?

Atsuko: It’s Atsuko, Sensei. You finally woke up.

I must have fallen asleep while doing paperwork.

Sensei: What time is it?

Atsuko: It’s currently 8 in the evening.

Sensei: Ah, it’s not that late yet. I’m going to quickly finish the paperwork.

Atsuko: That’s no good, Sensei. You’ve been working non-stop since the morning. You need a break.

Atsuko: Let me and the Royal Council handle the rest, Sensei. You established us to handle administration of the Arius School, so let us take some of your workload off your shoulders.

The Royal Council. It’s the new student council of Arius Satellite School. We named it so because Atsuko is the student council president of the school. As to why Atsuko is the president, everyone agreed her lineage gave her the legitimacy.

Atsuko: Besides, you haven’t eaten, have you, Sensei? I cooked some chowder. Why don’t we eat together?

The chowder smells good. I really am hungry.

Sensei: The chowder tastes amazing. Did you make this?

Atsuko: I’m glad you like it. I made it especially for you, since I know you’ve been subsisting on cup ramen lately.

Atsuko: Truthfully, I’m worried about your health, Sensei. You shouldn’t keep eating cup ramen. You should also get enough sleep. You barely slept 4 hours yesterday.

Atsuko is right. I need to take better care of myself. Fuuka, Mimori, and Serina won’t be able to take care of me now, so I’ll have to take care of my own health. I still have a lot to do, but that’s not an excuse to let myself fall sick.

Atsuko: You’ve already rebuilt the school and the district. Take a break, Sensei. You already did everything for us.

Sensei: No, there’s still work to do. We still need to establish more clubs as apparatus for the school as well as secure a source of funding until we can run the school independently.

Atsuko: Sensei, you need to rest. I won’t take no as an answer.

Sensei: I know. I’ll rest before I tackle these problems.

Atsuko: Then in the meantime, why don’t you let the Royal Council handle the clubs?

Atsuko: Everyone is still new to their jobs, but I’m confident we can at least do this much. We can’t let you overwork yourself to death.

Sensei: Very well. I’ll leave it to you.

Atsuko: How about the financing? Do you have a plan, Sensei?

Sensei: Don’t worry, princess. I know someone.

In the headmaster office of Arius

Black Suit: It’s a pleasure to finally meet you, Sensei, the headmaster of Arius.

Sensei: It’s a pleasure to meet you too, Black Suit. Please, take a seat.

Black Suit: Thank you.

Black Suit: Allow me to get straight to business. I’d like to know who you are.

Sensei: I am the headmaster of Arius. Is that not clear?

Black Suit: I know that, but I also know you are more than that.

Black Suit: We sent a letter to you, but the reply came too fast, almost as if you were expecting it.

Black Suit: Moreover, in the reply letter, you referred to us as Gematria, even though we made no mention of the name in the letter.

Black Suit: Clearly, you are more than just the headmaster of Arius. Tell me, how do you know who we are, before we even tell you who we are?

Sensei: It’s a secret and let’s leave it at that. Why don’t we talk about what you’re here for instead?

Black Suit: In that case, allow me to be frank.

Black Suit: I’m here to recruit you into Gematria, Sensei.

Sensei: Why do you want to recruit me?

Black Suit: We are impressed by what you’ve done to turn around the Arius district. The school was wallowing in poverty, and yet you turned it around within a few years. That’s not an easy feat.

Black Suit: Your quick reply, and your knowledge of our recently built organization also piqued us. You are a very capable adult. We believe we can achieve much more if you work with us.

Sensei: What kind of cooperation do you need from me?

Black Suit: The cooperation we need from you is rather simple. Your skill and knowledge are impressive. We’d like you to assist us in our study of the secrets of Kivotos.

Black Suit: My esteemed colleague, Maestro, is also in need of a place to use as a laboratory for his machinations. The Arius catacombs are the perfect place for that.

Sensei: And what’s in it for me if I join?

Black Suit: That’s what I’m here to talk about. What do we need to secure your cooperation, Sensei?

Sensei: What I need is simple. Money.

Black Suit: Oh? Is money all it takes?

Sensei: Wealth isn’t important for me. However, to continue improving the Arius district, I’m in need of funds.

Sensei: I know for a fact that you have connections with large corporations and money from selling technologies of the Nameless Priest. We each have something the other needs.

Black Suit: I’m… impressed. This is our first meeting, yet you know that much about us, and we know very little of you.

Black Suit: Very well. We have a deal, Sensei.

Sensei: And one more thing. I will cooperate with your research, but I refuse to participate in anything that could harm others. I have my moral standards.

Black Suit: That is unexpected, but I believe we can make arrangements.

To be honest, I don’t really want to work with Gematria, or be part of them, but the funding is important to fully rebuilt Arius into a proper school rivalling at least Hyakkiyako or Shanhaijing. Moreover, I hope I can influence Gematria from the inside, to reduce the suffering they do inflict upon Kivotos.

Sensei: Speaking of which, is there anyone in Gematria named Beatrice?

Black Suit: No. There’s no one there who goes by Beatrice. Who is that?

Sensei: It’s just someone I have bad blood with.

Black Suit: Rest assured, Sensei. We do not have plans to recruit anyone else besides you.

Sensei: Thank you. That gives me peace of mind.

So far, Beatrice has not appeared in this timeline. I have already taken control of Arius and prevented their civil war, but Beatrice is nowhere to be seen, despite previously taking control of Arius after an internal conflict erupted. Where did she go now?

Somewhere in the Arius district

Saori: Sensei? What are you doing here?

Sensei: Good afternoon, Saori. I’m here to check on the Royal Peacekeepers.

The Royal Peacekeepers. The Arius district needs an organization to enforce law and order. Therefore, the Royal Peacekeepers was established. They are the Arius equivalent of Trinity’s Justice Task Force. Saori is the president because she is both a great leader and one of the best combatants in Arius.

Saori: Um, but what is there to see here? We’re just cleaning up after a scuffle.

Sensei: I don’t mind just seeing you clean up. I want to make sure you’re not having difficulties.

Saori: Then you can be rest assured. We’re doing well. We’ve gotten used to navigating and patrolling the district.

Saori: But, Sensei, is it okay for you to come out just to see us? I heard you’ve been busy with the Royal Council. Shouldn’t you finish your work?

Sensei: Ahaha, speaking about that…

Sensei: Princess kicked me out of my own office, because I’ve been spending too much time doing paperwork. Princess said I shouldn’t be sitting on a desk for hours.

Saori: Ah, I see. So this leisure visit is because you have nothing better to do?

Sensei: Wait, no, that’s not what I meant!

Saori: I’m just kidding, Sensei. My apologies. The opportunity just presented itself.

Sensei: Now that I think about it, cleaning up after a scene isn’t your responsibility as the president of the Royal Peacekeeper.

Saori: Ah… About that… Sensei…

Saori: An offhand comment I made got me here. I said I was bored of paperwork, so the others offered to take the load.

Saori: With no paperwork, I had a lot more free time, so I decided to help the rookie members break up a fight and clean up the scene.

Sensei: Oh, so your job got taken away from you, and that’s why you’re with the rookies doing the more menial tasks?

Saori: That’s… not exactly wrong.

Saori: However, I don’t mind. Guiding the rookies through their tasks is surprisingly fun. I might do this more often.

I’m surer than ever that Saori will become a great teacher in the future. She even shares the trait of disliking paperwork just like me.

Saori: Anyway, when are you going to take a bodyguard, Sensei? You’re not resistant to bullets. You shouldn’t be walking around with no one to protect you.

Sensei: I’m fine. I can’t possibly trouble my students by having them guard me all the time.

Saori: But Sensei, we don’t mind being your bodyguard. You’re our precious headmaster!

Saori: If you’re worried about exhausting us or taking our time, we can just work in shifts. That way, we can share the responsibility and burdens.

Sensei: You always insist on this whenever we meet, Saori.

Saori: I’ll say it again, Sensei. You’re our precious headmaster, our hero.

Saori: You’re the one who gave us hope for a better future. We owe our lives to you.

Saori: So please let us guarantee your safety. The Royal Peacekeepers are at your service!

Sensei: …I’ll consider it.

Saori: Really? You’re finally agreeing to it?

Saori: Thank you, Sensei!

I have a feeling Saori will never stop suggesting it if I refuse each time. I still disagree with the idea, but I might not have a choice. I don’t have Arona or the Shittim Chest to protect me, so I need protection from the numerous gunfights in Kivotos.

Within the headmaster’s office of Arius

Maestro: Good afternoon, Sensei. I’m here to discuss my plans with you.

Sensei: Good afternoon, Maestro. Have a seat. Would you like tea or coffee?

Maestro: Neither. I would like to start the discussion immediately.

Sensei: Very well. What’s on our agenda to discuss?

Maestro: The mimesis. I have successfully produced copies of the Saint Justina Council.

Maestro: However, they cannot last more than a few minutes at most. They cannot act or do anything in their current state.

Sensei: What can we do about that?

Maestro: I believe we’ll have to activate their presence here. We need to recreate a situation specifically tailored for the Saint Justina Council. That would solidify their presence in Kivotos once more.

Maestro: The Trinity cathedral would be the perfect place for that. We can hijack the upcoming Eden Treaty. It would also be a great place to test out the Communio Sanctorum.

Sensei: I’ll have to suggest against that. Trinity is in a political upheaval. They have heightened security, and we’re not even sure the treaty will take place.

Maestro: It’s a shame, but that is to be expected.

Maestro: Ever since the GSC President proposed the Eden Treaty, the Sisterhood has been politically rocked. They suddenly abandoned their isolationist policy and increased security.

Maestro: Why did they suddenly abandon their policy? Why do they want to get involved in the Eden Treaty? How did they even know of the treaty before it was announced?

Sensei: I suspect someone wants to change the political landscape of Trinity. The Eden Treaty is the perfect opportunity to do that.

Maestro: Then, is the GSC President trying to change Trinity?

Sensei: We can’t be sure of that yet. This whole thing could be orchestrated by her, but it may also be a coincidence.

Actually, that person is me. Without Beatrice being the catalyst for the Eden Treaty incident, the Eden Treaty can move smoothly, but that also means the political factions in Trinity will remain divided. To do something about that, I made contact with the Sisterhood and leaked crucial information.

I told them about the Eden Treaty and why they should get involved. This should hopefully cause a chain reaction to help Trinity’s political force unify into one. I did not leak information to the Remedial Knights, but they should get involved sooner or later anyway.

Sensei: In any case, taking advantage of the Eden Treaty is out of the question. Instead, I suggest we use one of the ruins in the Trinity district near the beach.

Maestro: We can use ruins? Are you sure?

Sensei: I’m sure of it. The ruins won’t draw attention and they will work just as good as the Sisterhood cathedral.

Hopefully, this means that Maestro’s machinations won’t go around causing chaos within Kivotos. This isn’t a perfect solution, as Maestro’s creation will go on to wreak havoc anyway, but it’s better than nothing. I can minimize the damage this way.

Hiyori: Come in!

Hiyori: Sensei, welcome! To what do the Royal Academicians owe the pleasure?

The Royal Academicians. They were originally a club that is the Arius equivalent of Trinity’s Library Committee, but they changed into a club that helps me handle the academics of teaching. They help me create homework for other students, grade tests, and teach.

I put Hiyori as the president of the club because her score is consistently good and she can surprisingly be a good teacher. Saori also tried to join the club, but she eventually chose to keep Arius safe by joining the Royal Peacekeepers.

Sensei: I came to pick up this week’s test results. Have you finished grading them?

Hiyori: I have! And I have good news!

Hiyori: This time, everyone passed their exams!

Sensei: That is very good news.

Sensei: Speaking of which, Azusa and a few other students are going to go out to pick up some books from the surface. Do you want to go along with them?

Hiyori: Eh? Can I?

Sensei: You sure can. I’ve heard that you wanted to go see the surface. Now would be a good opportunity to do that.

Hiyori: But, Sensei, I heard Misaki tell me that the surface is filled with dangerous things. Pollens, thugs, and so many more!

Arius Student A: Oh, come on, president! It’s not that dangerous.

Arius Student B: You’re the only one in the Royal Academicians not to have visited the surface at least once anyway. Give it a try, will you?

Hiyori: Uh… Well, if Sensei and you guys insist, I’ll go.

Sensei: While you’re at it, why don’t you try buying your favorite magazine by yourself? You ought to try buying it for yourself at least once.

Hiyori: Okay, I’m not going then.

Arius Student A: President! You’re just going to buy a magazine!

Arius Student B: Relax, president. Azusa will be with you. If anything goes wrong, you can rely on her.

Hiyori: Fueeh…

It would be great if all the students went to the surface regularly, outside of the Arius catacombs. They’ll learn more about the world by being outside. Unfortunately, some seem to be content with staying in the Arius district, so I have to give a little push to some of them.

\-----

Atsuko: Sensei? I have a question for you.

Sensei: What is it, princess?

Atsuko: Why should Arius reintegrate with Trinity?

Sensei: It’s because Trinity has more resources than us and because it would be much better for us to open up rather than stay in isolation.

Atsuko: You always say that, Sensei, but I want to know deeper. Why do we need to do this? We’ve been split from Trinity since ages. What’s the point now?

Sensei: I don’t mind explaining it, princess, but I’d like to ask why you’re asking this now when we’ve already made the appointment to meet the Tea Party.

Saori: I must agree, princess. It’s a little too late to ask for that.

Atsuko: I tried to understand the underlying reason by myself, but I’m not as good in politics as you are Sensei. That’s why I’m asking now.

Sensei: I see. Well, where should I begin?

Atsuko: We’re already self-sufficient, so why do we need the resource from a bigger academy like Trinity?

Sensei: We are indeed self-sufficient, but the resource we need isn’t simply monetary resources. We need the administrative power too.

Sensei: As it stands, Arius isn’t registered as a school. You don’t have any student cards or recognition. It’s the reason why we always pay in cash for our finances.

Sensei: It would be difficult for us to continue without any recognition as a school, hence we need the administrative power of Trinity to register us as a proper school.

Saori: Hm, if we need recognition, wouldn’t contacting any school be fine? Why are we contacting Trinity to be specific?

Sensei: Arius is an old and forgotten school. Most schools wouldn’t even recognize us, so the best option we have is Trinity.

Atsuko: Then, why do we need to integrate to Trinity, Sensei? I think our school can stand on its own just fine.

Atsuko: Certainly, getting our school proper recognition is important, but I don’t think it necessitates integration.

Sensei: The integration part is an attempt to break our isolationist culture of Arius.

Sensei: Currently, most of Arius students are content to stay in the catacombs. Some have barely even seen the surface.

Sensei: Liking home isn’t a bad thing, but there are things that can only be learnt by experience. Even just visiting another school can be wild.

Sensei: This is where the reintegration comes in. Arius students will be much more compelled to leave the catacombs and see the world at large.

Sensei: That is the long and short of why we should reintegrate with Trinity. Are you satisfied with my explanation, princess?

Atsuko: Yes, I’m satisfied. I’m glad you’re always doing more for us Sensei. Thank you.

Sensei: I hope you learnt something from the explanation.

Saori: I think I learnt that I’m not savvy at politics.

Atsuko: It’s fine, Saori. You’re not attending as a delegation, just as Sensei’s bodyguard.

Saori: That’s not exactly reassuring.

\-----

Hasumi: Seia-sama, the delegation from Arius is here.

Seia: Thank you, Hasumi. Please bring them in.

…

Seia: Thank you for coming, delegations of Arius. I am Yurizono Seia, the current host of Tea Party. You must be Sensei, the headmaster of Arius, Atsuko, the student council president of Arius, and Saori, the president of law enforcement in Arius, correct?

Atsuko: That is correct. Thank you for agreeing to this meeting.

Seia: The pleasure is mine.

Sensei: Before we begin, may I ask where the other Trinity hosts are?

Seia: They are not present at the moment. May I ask why you need to know?

Atsuko: We’d like to discuss with all of you instead of just discussing with you alone.

Seia: Why is that necessary? As the current host, I am the de facto student council president of Trinity.

Sensei: We did our research. The Tea Party changes their host regularly, and that poses a problem to our discussion.

Atsuko: The political situation is Trinity is problematic. We can’t accept only discussing with only one head of the political factions.

Atsuko: It will only take one coup to render our discussion moot. I hope you can understand our concern.

Sensei: We’d also like to avoid any chances of miscommunication down the line. Talking with all three hosts now would prove to be more worthwhile than communicating with all three in different occasions.

Seia: …

Seia: Very well. Please wait a moment.

…

Nagisa: Good afternoon, I am Kirifuji Nagisa, the next host of Tea Party after Seia.

Mika: Hello! I’m Misono Mika, also a host of Tea Party!

Nagisa: Mika, please watch your manners.

Saori: You got them here very fast.

Sensei: The power of your dreams is amazing.

Nagisa: …!

Mika: …!

Seia: You know of my power?

Atsuko: Please don’t underestimate us. It’d do good if you were to treat us as equals.

Seia: …Let’s begin the discussion.

…

Nagisa: I’m not sure I like this idea.

Mika: You’re such a worrywart, Nagisa. We’re only adding another signee to the Eden Treaty.

Nagisa: But that signature will have a lot of political implications.

Nagisa: Besides, the Eden Treaty is meant to be a treaty between Gehenna and Trinity. Arius, a school seeking to reintegrate to Trinity, should have no business signing the treaty.

Seia: I see your point, Nagisa, but they do offer good reasons to request that.

Atsuko: Since Arius will only be partially integrated by the time of the Eden Treaty, Arius will be a legal loophole in the agreements. I’m sure none of us would be happy if Arius is exploited for whatever reason.

Sensei: It would also be the best way to get the General Student Council to acknowledge our school. Their chaos after the disappearance of the GSC President is making bureaucracy complicated.

Seia: If it’s too hard to agree on, why don’t we discuss this further later on? We still have time until the Eden Treaty.

…

Nagisa: Then we can consider this topic finished. We’ve gone through our entire agenda now. Is there anything else we still need to discuss?

Atsuko: I believe we finished everything. Thank you for the discussion.

Seia: The pleasure is ours. We’re happy to accept Arius back into Trinity.

Atsuko: Then, before we end the discussion, there is something I’d like to comment on.

Seia: Yes…?

Atsuko: Is Trinity really a unified academy that has stopped going to war?

Mika: What do you mean? We’re not at war, are we?

Atsuko: On the surface, no. You don’t bring out arms and fight. However, it seems to us that each faction in Trinity is vying for power and acting for their own interest.

Atsuko: It seems more like you gave a rule for your war and then called it unification, and then made yourself look good in front of everyone else.

Seia: …

Nagisa: That’s…

Mika: Uh…

Atsuko: It makes me wonder too, is the Tea Party truly the student council of Trinity?

Atsuko: Do you really hold authority of the school or are you simply just the strongest faction at the current time? Will you still be the student council once you lost power?

Sensei: I think that’s enough, princess.

Atsuko: My apologies. I’ve let my mouth run wild.

Saori: Princess, sensei. We need to hurry up for our meeting with the Sisterhood.

Atsuko: Please don’t take it to heart. I simply had mild concerns over the reintegration if this is the political climate of Trinity.

Atsuko: Thank you, and goodbye.

\-----

Atsuko: So, how did I do?

Saori: That was really harsh.

Atsuko: But it delivered the point better that way.

Sensei: That was indeed harsh. You were really sharp with your tongue.

Atsuko: It’s the best way to leave a lasting impression. None of what I said was truly wrong either.

Sensei: Right. Trinity has a rich history and culture, but it’s a shame the political infighting may be among the worst.

\-----

Sakurako: That wraps up our discussion. I thank you for your time and patience with us.

Sensei: Thanks to you too. With this, we are one step closer to reintegrating Arius.

Sakurako: Pardon me for asking, but how did the discussion with the Tea Party go?

Sensei: It was splendid. They’re considering Arius to be another signee to the Eden Treaty.

Sakurako: That’s fantastic. Arius can expect to attend the Eden Treaty.

Atsuko: On another note, I have questions about Trinity. Why is it that we need to discuss with another group besides the student council in regards to politics?

Sakurako: It’s because the Tea Party and the Sisterhood are separate entities with political influence.

Atsuko: Then why are you separate? Can you call yourself unified if you can’t agree to work together?

Sakurako: The Sisterhood has different views and methods than the Tea Party. It’d be hard to truly unify us.

Atsuko: Because you are different, you decide to have your own organization? What about the differences? Simply being a different political entity does not solve the underlying issue.

Atsuko: You’re just sugarcoating it. The Sisterhood and Tea Party’s inability to work together, that is.

Sakurako: T-that’s…

Atsuko: And what does the Sisterhood expect to achieve with isolationism? Are you hoping to protect your own ideals by shunning the world? A deliberate attempt at willful ignorance?

Atsuko: Does the old promise to unify mean nothing? The predecessors worked together to end the war and to bring everyone together, so the school then fractures from the inside out?

Sakurako: …

Sensei: Princess, let’s not go too far.

Atsuko: Ah, I’ve gone and done it again. I’m sorry, Sakurako.

Sakurako: No, it’s fine. It’s really… fine…

Sakurako: H-Hinata, please escort the Arius delegation out.

Hinata: Yes, but are you okay, Sakurako?

Sakurako: I’m fine… I just need time…

\-----

Sensei: That was a bit excessive, wasn’t it?

Atsuko: But it went as planned, so everything went well, didn’t it?

Saori: I’m not sure we should leave such an impression, princess.

Atsuko: Impression aside, I think I’ve found my true calling. I should be a politician.

Saori: Uh…

Sensei: I’m not sure whether to be proud or laugh.

Atsuko: Thank you for your compliment, Sensei.

Saori: I don’t think Sensei meant it as a compliment.

### Background

As ""only"" my 4th Marathon, this was another learning experience of sorts, so I think some context is valuable to understand the report.

I'm a 47M. Started running in 2018-ish, becoming more serious about it over time. Height about 5""10, weight about 160lbs. Not overweight (good genetics), but not athletic. Never been a high school/college athlete. Nerdy, software engineer, spends most of my time sitting.

Had 3 previous Marathons ran:

* Reykjavik Marathon (August 2022): target 3:25:00, did 3:39:00. Never walked. Hal beginner training. Running about 4x a week, ~30mpw. 
* Vermont City Marathon (May 2023): target 3:30:00, did 3:37:35. Walked a bit. McMillan training through Strava (very convenient). Running about 4x a week, ~30-40mpw.
* Mad Marathon (July 2023): ""fun"" race, target 4:00:00, did 4:26:46 (very tough course and weather, kicked me in the nuts). Walked a LOT. No training, just ""base"". Running about 4x a week, 30mpw.

All of these races had their own great lessons. But I left desiring that sub-3:30 time, and was a bit mad about walking in Marathons 2 & 3.

As a warning... I'll mention a lot of data in this report. I double down on getting metrics and pay a lot of attention to all the data I can get. This is for two reasons:

* I really like analyzing the data; it just works well for me. Honestly, half the fun of running for me is looking at the data after a run. I don't think I go crazy about it... I take everything with a grain of salt. But I still enjoy the heck out of it. So I'm the kind of person who has a lot of fun using Runalyze, and I have a ton of my own spreadsheets with some calculators of my own.
* I'm not a good ""instinct"" runner. I know some people are like that and they might scoff at those like me who pay too much attention to their Garmin. Unfortunately for me, I have trouble knowing things like my pace, how I'm feeling, how much effort I'm putting into something, how fast I can go, etc. It's just hard, and I'm not getting much better at it over time. So I do use my watch and my data to get a sense of my progression. It works wonders for me! My progression over the last few years is almost solely based on learning how to use that data (and adjacent tools) better, as I'll talk about here.

### Pre-training

I have been running a lot over the last year, after that 3rd Marathon. Got my frequency up, from 3-4 runs a week to 6 runs a week. Increased my default ""base"" run distance too, from about 5k+ to 10k+. Started running to work more frequently (a 10k+/6mi+ commute, carrying a 7kg/15lb backpack), doing it 3x a week and increasing mileage to about 13k/8mi by default, up to even 22k/14mi when logistically feasible (FTR, I haven't had the chance to say ""oh btw today I run a half marathon to work, how's your day going?"" to my coworkers yet).

My weekly mileage wasn't that higher than before though. It stayed at around 25-30mpw for this base building. And I wasn't doing many long runs - in fact, I was doing *fewer* long runs than before. While I previously could do a HM run every weekend, now I did that maybe once every 3 months. I just didn't have time due to family obligations on the weekend.

Still, I was coming in hot. I knew I had a much stronger base than before, with just more running under my feet. I also did a 5k ""season"" from Dec 2023 to Jul 2024 where I became a much better 5k runner and improved my speed and form. Lowered my 5K PR from (about) 22:00 to 20:26 (chip). So I was feeling great for a new Marathon. Got in to NYCM sorta by surprise (I did the lottery and got in), so I decided that was going to be The Race.

I just didn't have a target time for the race yet because the variables had changed. I wanted it to be between 3:15 (effective VO2max based equivalent to my 5Ks) and 3:30 (my original target). I was going to start with a plan for 3:20, and then adapt after a few test races.

That was the general idea, at least.

### Training

#### Part 1: Everybody has a plan

I did a lot more reading over time before I started the training - Pfitz, Jack Daniels, Hanson. I wanted a more advanced, more efficient plan. I also wanted something that worked with my schedule: not only I had a kid (which prevented me from doing very long runs on weekends, and requires my time in the morning/afternoon), but I had a new child on the way. This would make lengthy, 3h+ runs even more of a problem. A PR is not worth of a divorce.

After some reading, I settled on doing a 18-week Hanson's ""advanced"" marathoning plan. It matched my schedule nearly perfectly: runs almost every day, with a more or less evenly distributed distance, without massive long runs. I was also excited for the speed/strength workouts, which looked a lot more structured than I had done before.

The one adaptation I did was to shift the week by 4 days: Wednesdays became my ""long run"" days, with everything following accordingly. I figured that I could take a day off from work here and there when I needed a really long run, when my kid was at school. All in all, I was pretty happy with that plan, even proud.

As a preparation, I also did some lab tests (for the first time) to see where my fitness stood. I wanted to get a baseline to see how much I'd improve after my training plan. I got some pretty informative metrics out of it: VO2Max at 67.7 ml/kg/min (much higher than my Garmin's predicted VO2Max of 52, and ""elite"" for my age according to the lab guy); Max HR at 173 (matching what I already knew); L1/Aerobic Threshold at 154 BPS / 9:15/mi / 5:47/km; L2/Anaerobic Threshold at 165 BPS / 7:30/mi / 4:41/km; and body fat at 20.8%.

In general, I knew running economy was my weak link, and it wouldn't be bad if I lost a couple of pounds (literally).

Interestingly, I also got some leg-related numbers, indicating a severe imbalance in strength between left and right leg. I never felt any issue, so I ignored those. You can probably see where this is going.

It was early July. I felt great and optimistic. But of course, things sometimes happen.

#### Part 2: Until they get punched in the face

Days after my test, it was the second week of my training plan. I started feeling some soreness on my right achilles heel. It went away briefly and then ""moved"" to the calf. It didn't bother me as much during running (mostly during walking) so I continued to run hard: commuting to work, running on the heat. I did that for a few days and then it became clear it wasn't improving: it was becoming worse. After a week, I had more pain while walking, but weirdly, I could still run fine.

I decided to ""rest for a couple of days"" to make it better. It didn't; if anything, it got worse. By then, I couldn't walk without a limp, and couldn't run either.

This was my first injury ever, as a runner. I had no experience with that sort of stuff, and I had botched it. It was clear I made it worse by trying to ignore it.

I went to see a doctor and he diagnosed a calf strain on my leg. Recommended physiotherapy, and said I'd probably be out for a couple of weeks, then back running another 4 weeks.

I was bummed, but truth be told, I was already starting to feel a bit of training anxiety regarding our upcoming baby. I didn't think I'd be able to fit all the training runs around the schedule. That, coupled with the injury, made me decide to skip the NYC Marathon for 2024, and move it to the next year (you can ""cancel"" once and get a guaranteed entry in the following year).

It was an easy decision, and a very positive one. It made me less anxious: it and gave me freedom to let my body recover at its own pace, without the stress of trying to catch up with a plan.

That said, I didn't cancel my entry right away. I decided to wait and see how things looked down the road.

#### Part 3: But maybe...

I was out of running for 2 weeks. I biked to/from work on a heavy Citibike (over the Brooklyn Bridge) to try and keep my fitness. Biking didn't affect my strained muscles at all.

I went to PT, which was very ""meh"" (recommendation: don't see a ""generic"" PT for running injuries; they can only give cookie-cutter workouts that might not fit the bill). By then my calf strain had extended and was affecting my hamstrings and lower back as well. After 3 weeks of PT I started running again, very slowly at first, to ""get a feeling"" for it, then slowly increasing my mileage. I dropped out of PT and made my own, more custom recovery plan, targeting the right muscles to aid on recovery.

Running felt very hard! I could barely keep with my previous marathon pace, and reaching my 5K pace for even 200m felt like hell. I could also reach my max heart rate in like 10 seconds of hard running, something I could *never* do before.

I felt a bit dejected for a week or so. I felt like I was set back years. But I was happy to be back on my feet and improving.

Luckily, things came together quickly after that. It took me about a month (from mid-August to mid-September) to be back at my previous ""effective VO2Max"" according to Runalyze.

Meanwhile, I was also tracking my GCT Balance (using the Garmin HRM). My balance used to be 50%/50%, meaning each of my feet stayed on the ground roughly the same amount of time. But it was clear after the injury that my leg was messed up: it shot up to 46%/54% ([see chart](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@zeh/113006326390616328))! This showed I had work to do.

I also started using a Stryd (""Duo"") at that point. I wanted to test it out, and my excuse was getting better metrics on how my leg moved (indeed, my L/R steps were VERY different from each other). I used it to analyze my movement, and to read my pace (more on that later), but not much else. I ignored all the ""power"" stuff the device offers.

At some point, my leg was feeling fine, but with the metrics I got, and some benchmark exercises (like jumping in one leg), it was clear my right leg was still weaker. I started doing more of my own strength training by then: after some research on the subject, I learned some good exercises, and realized I should have been doing this all along (I know, I know).

All in all, I lost probably 9 weeks (of my potential 18 week plan) with this injury. But then I thought, you know what? I feel good, GCT balance is improving, so I think I'll run the Marathon after all.

#### Part 4: Still forward

I slowly started getting into a rhythm where I tried following my original plan to the best of my ability. I never got to the prescribed volume: the closest I got was probably about 70% of it (probably matching Hanson's ""beginner"" plan in the end). I didn't want to push too fast, too hard, of course. So at first I wanted the race to be a ""fun"" run, not an all-out race.

But you know, I'm not a competitive person... I don't care if I'm slower or faster than anyone else... but I certainly care if I'm improving. And at some point I thought, I wanted to see some improvement in this race.

Anyhow, I adapted my plan further. I dropped my 3:15+ target and decided I'd do something around 3:25-3:30. I started training with a 3:25 equivalent pace in mind.

One interesting thing that I did was to plan for a 42.6k run, not a 42.2k. I'm not sure how others do it... but since the length is always longer (even if you ignore/correct GPS discrepancies!), I felt it would be better to plan for it. So my planned paces were a few bit seconds faster than they would otherwise be at.

I also had to juggle my training around my (then) newborn. Some days I couldn't run, some days I had to make it short. I started free-styling the workouts, still more or less around Hanson's original plan.

For example, if I couldn't do the prescribed 16k/10mi tempo run, I'd do a 10k tempo run, followed by 1mi @ HM, 800m @ 10k, and 400m @ 5k. I incorporated a lot more hill repeats into the schedule. I did my work runs (weighted) at a faster pace.

This could have been a disaster, but, surprisingly, it worked super well. I adapted the plan for what I thought I needed, and could fit into the schedule. It felt great.

One interesting thing I did was... incorporate the newborn into Marathon training, in a sense. You see, I need to bounce my newborn to sleep several times a day. And I could only bounce her to sleep by... squatting repeatedly while holding her to my chest! So I ended up doing literally thousands of mini-squats a day with her (at some point I counted 4000 mini-squats on one afternoon). That should have helped my leg strength, I hope. I ended up skipping my strength training several times, and I want to believe those squats are what did it OK (I tried incorporating different workouts into the bouncing, but they were not exactly safe while performed with a newborn).

Anyway. I did have a few long runs (2 HM-distance commute runs to work with the backpack, one un-laden HM at race pace, and one ""standard"" prescribed 20 mile run: 10k commute run to work, followed by 22k without the backpack). So it's not like I missed a ton of long runs, but it was the bare minimum for a ""serious"" plan.

Additionally, I didn't do any really good time trials (like, no 10k or HM). But I did a few tempo and progression runs to see how I felt about the speeds. In the end, I settled on a 3:28:00 time target - felt a good compromise between the somewhat aggressive 3:25 and my ultimate target of sub-3:30.

#### Part 5: Knowing the enemy

One interesting thing I did this time was study the course better, and plan better.

On my previous races, I barely knew the course I was running. I just went out and ran. I maybe had a pace in mind, and tried staying on it, but I had no other preparation. In fact, in my first Marathon, I trusted my watch's GPS too much and was surprised when 42km came and went with no finish line in sight! The race was finished with 42.9k marked on the watch. I was so confused; I didn't know better.

The NYC Marathon is one that is easy to study, since it's so popular. So I watched 3 (!) full runs of the course on YouTube, recorded on GoPros; I read all about it; I studied the elevation. I watched all the clowns on YouTube (and some not-so-clowns) talking about their experience running the course. I felt like I knew all there was to it.

I also ran almost all of the course (everything except the Verrazzano bridge). You know, someone asked a while ago on Reddit if they should run the NYCM course prior to the race... at the time I thought this was a dumb idea: it's boring, there's a lot of traffic lights, and you can't run the full course anyhow, so why bother? Go run the West Side Highway or something instead.

But I decided to do it and boy, am I glad I did it! I did it by incorporating it in some of my long-ish runs, or my runs to work. I'd run a different piece of it once in a while, 10k here and there, culminating with the last day, where I ran the last half of the marathon course at race pace, as a sort of a ""dress rehearsal"". It felt amazing.

Yes, there were traffic lights. That gave me a LOT of confidence for the run: I knew what to expect at every point! Several things no one mentioned, the little valleys to take into account, the landmarks to watch out for.

The last part I did better was race strategy and planning. Previously, I had decided on a given pace (say, 5:00/km or 8:00/mi for my 3:30 finish) and stuck to it, until I couldn't anymore. And by ""stuck to it"", I mean really stuck to it, even trying to ignore uphills and downhills and run the same speed always!

This time around, I was a bit smarter. I planned for uphills and downhills. Also I also did a little bit of a mind trick.

You see, I tend to run too fast at the start, even if I tell myself I'm running too fast. I'm getting better over time, but I know I still do it: I try to ""do better"" than my expected pace. So my plan was to do a slight negative split. I had done negative splits in most of my long runs and it actually worked well; I was confident. BUT, my suspicion was that I would run a bit too fast the first half of the Marathon, and then lose steam. So the negative split was a way to account for that: if I ran too fast, I could slow down a bit afterwards, getting to an even split in effect. My rational mind trying to account for what my more emotionally excited mind would do later.

Just having a plan is not enough though. Execution matters. This is where something else comes to play: Garmin's Pace Pro.

Previously, for pacing, I had relied solely on knowing what my pace should be, and looking at my watch. Yes, I had used things like the ""Race screen"" data field, but it wasn't enough.

I started testing the Pace Pro feature of Garmin a few months prior, during my commute/training runs, and found it was the perfect solution. You see, if you feed a prescribed course into it, and then create a plan around it, the watch will match the course - not relying on GPS distance by itself - and tell you what the expected pace is for every split, as well as how you're doing with your expected finish time (your time ahead/behind, etc).

So I spent an embarrassingly long amount of time getting [a proper NYCM course map done](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunNYC/comments/1fupofn/proper_nyc_marathon_map_for_garmin_connect/), with the correct elevation (even the official NYCM map is messed up). I fed it into Garmin, created a Pace Pro plan with the splits I wanted (by arbitrary elevation), adjusted it to be slightly negative, and some uphill/downhill adjustments. I knew that's what I'd use.

### Pre-race

The day before the race, I did the usual stuff - fueling, deciding on outfit, going through the routine.

I had decided on fueling by going back to SiS packets, after some months training with Gu (didn't work for me). I've always liked SiS, and their new ""beta fuel"" was perfect for me. I previously stopped using them because they were hard to find in the US and to be honest I hate their flavors, but they're much easier to buy now (thanks to a new distributor), and the ""neutral"" flavor is just perfect (due to its *lack* of flavor). I settled on one every 30 min, so I'd need about 7 packets for my 3:28-ish run. I brought 8.

I also decided that differently from previous races, I wouldn't bring my water handheld. NYCM has plenty of water station, and it was going to be a cold and dry day, so I figured I could finally start drinking water from the course.

For shoes, I used a pair of Vaporflys. I had already had about 40km on them. I had used Vaporfly on some (short) races and long runs and liked them, but this would be my first time wearing them on a Marathon.

For outfit, I picked one of my favorite Janji short tights with 7 pockets. Between gels, phone, a printout of my splits (which I never used), salt packets, and some band-aids, I had stuff in just about every pocket!

My shirt was a standard soccer Jersey from the (Brazilian) team I support, São Paulo FC. This was a deliberate choice. Because I normally get easily overwhelmed and somewhat distracted by people shouting my name (or words of support), I didn't want to do any of the usual ""put your name on your shirt"" thing or anything like that. Instead, I wore a team shirt. I knew Brazilians would recognize it, and shout the team's name (or one of its rivals), and that's the amount of acknowledgement I knew I could stomach.

My sleep on the weeks prior to the race was pretty bad (newborn and all, waking up every 3 hours or so). But I don't think it affected much. I tried banking more of it by going to bed earlier.

I got a hotel near the ferry that takes you to the start (in Staten Island). I live in Brooklyn, and it'd take me about 30 minutes to get there, but with two kids and visiting in-laws, my wife didn't want to deal with someone else waking up at 5am.

The day of the race, I woke up, did bathroom stuff, took a shower, got some coffee, and headed to the ferry with my clear bag of fueling stuff for the next 2 hours and the race. I was supposed to take the ferry at 7AM, and my wave was Wave 2 (starting at 9:45AM).

Much has been written about the transportation to the NYCM start, so there's not much I can add. I can say the scale of the whole thing is staggering. A lot of people moving from one place to another. Everything went extremely smoothly - from the ferry, to the buses, to the start village. Before I knew, I was there, in porta-potty land.

The start village was very cold (and windy), and I was dressed for the race, not for waiting. But that was the only moment I felt cold, so I wasn't worried.

I ended up using the porta-potties twice (something I usually avoid in races). Too much hydrating. But it all went smoothly as well. I moved around and suddenly, I was on the bridge, waiting for the race to start.

### Race

#### 0-5k

The race started very smoothly as well. I had heard stories of crowded starts, lots of people going too fast or too slow, but things couldn't have been better for me. Everybody respected their predicted pace (I was around the 3:30 crowd) and started at a pragmatic pace. I decided to go a bit slow at the start, to get a feeling for it.

My first mile was basically Zone 1. Maybe I was cold, maybe my heart rate strap wasn't working well. But it felt perfectly business-like.

All in all it was the best start I've ever seen of a Marathon, to be honest. Didn't have to swerve much at all. I've been to smaller Marathons that were more chaotic! This might be because I was in the ""orange"" lane. I felt like the main, ""blue"" lane, was way more packed. But who knows.

The first 5k came and went. I was feeling great and doing well. As predicted, I was a bit faster than my intended pace. Pace Pro was working great to tell me how I was doing, and Stry was awesome thanks to the more accurate, more real-time pace it provides (even though I had to do proper calibration first). Still, I did the whole thing at about 5s faster (per km) than my intended pace. 

#### 5k-10k

The race continued well. I stayed at my pace, still a bit faster than intended. This part - 4th ave - is mostly flat and spacious, so not much to write.

I started picking people in the race to follow, if I felt like they were doing more of my target pace. That's usually my strategy and it worked well. I really admire people who can just run at that same even pace without looking at their watches or something. That's not me, but I admire them. Thanks ""middle age Italian dude"" and ""generic guy in gray shirt"", your pace was great for this segment.

#### 10k-15k

After 10k I crossed from the ""orange"" lane (left side of 4th Ave) to the ""blue"" lane (right side). That side was crazy! I felt it was a lot more packed, and it had more supporters. I had crossed to see my family, who would be standing from that side. After nearly missing them, I briefly saw my in-laws, high-fived my son, and my wife took a picture. Re-energized and emotional, I crossed back to the orange side.

The run continued as expected. A bit of an uphill, and tighter crowds. Lafayette was one of the segments that made me glad I ran the course beforehand: it has a surprise hill, not very strong, but it can break some people after the relative flatness of 4th ave. I did well there.

Some people were yelling something related to my shirt, in supported of the same team. I smiled every time.

#### 15k-20k

The race here was a blur. I was still doing a bit faster than expected - by now, about 45 seconds ahead of my time - but feeling great. Bedford was insane with supporters - I'm glad they had the barricades! now - and energizing.

My pacer here (and for the next 10k or so) was ""girl with the puffy yellow shorts"". Thanks!

At the end of Williamsburg, I started feeling a bit of beck and upper back pain. This is something that always bothers me on long runs, especially when I'm heading to work with the backpack (usually after the first 10k), so I wasn't too surprised. I know my back isn't very strong, and in general I tend to bend down over time as I run. I was trying to make a conscious effort to keep good form and not make it worse.

We approached the halfway mark, and I knew things were about to start. I was stepping into charted, but untrained, territory.

#### 20k-25k

Getting to Greenpoint, and then going over the Pulaski Bridge (HM point), is where I realized I had to be a bit more pragmatic about my pace.

I pulled the breaks a little bit going up, going a bit slower than expected (maybe 5s below my expected km pace for that segment). I still felt strong, but I knew I had to start conserving energy.

The run before the Queensboro bridge was a blur. I know there was a bit of an uphill here (I felt it during my runs) but I was so zoned out, I didn't feel it. I actually remember very little of it.

Queensboro bridge came and I was apprehensive. I had done that bridge many times, but I didn't know how it'd affect me.

The switch from a screaming audience to the clop-clop-clop of running feet was a welcome change, mentally. I slowed down a bit - about -5s/-10s on my km pace - but stayed steady.

It was a great climb. I felt pretty good. Up to that point, I was mostly on pace with people around me, but that's where I started seeing people dropping around me.

At some point I switched my pacer to ""girl with the Argentina singlet"".

#### 25k-30k

This is where I reached my halfway point.

Going over 1st ave was as expected. Huge crowds, good running, lots of space.

I didn't felt exactly impacted by the Queensboro climb, but my time was slipping behind; I was probably 10s ahead of my time now (down from 20), and dipping. But I was fine with this; my ""negative split"" trick was working.

My neck and upper back pain intensified, though.

#### 30k-35k

This is where I started suffering a bit. Things were getting hard.

For one thing, my heart rate started climbing a bit. This coincides with the time the temperature was rising, so maybe that's part of the cause. But I was hitting true untested space, since I didn't have many long runs (and certainly nothing longer than 32k/20mi) during training.

Still, I kept my pace. Dipping a few seconds from my km pace here and there, but still steady and according to plan overall.

At the 33k mark, I started feeling pain on my right knee, something I never feel. I was a bit scared. Luckily, it went away after a while.

The back and neck pain got a bit worse. They felt stiff - as if, it was all fine if I didn't move my neck or my shoulders around, but if I did, it was maybe a level 3 sort of pain (from 1-10).

If I wasn't paying attention, my pace would start dipping. I think I got about 20-30s behind my expected time at this point.

At this point, I switched my pacer to ""Mari from Brazil"". She was a bit faster than me and it's probably what I needed at that point as I entered the final 10k or so.

#### 35k-40k

This is a part I am glad I was mentally ready for what was to come.

I tried keeping the neck pain at bay, and kept pushing hard. I was doing more effort than ever, but managed to stabilize my pace to an expected even split.

The 5th ave climb (mile 24) came, and I wasn't too sure how I'd react to it. But I was keeping my pace and energized for the challenge.

To some surprise, it went terribly smoothly. I was a bit slower than my expected pace: about 5s slower (per km) than my original plan. But all things considered, I was still on my plan.

I ran up steadily, picking people left and right, going from one group of runners to the next. I had enough space. I never stopped or slowed down. I don't remember feeling the bends. I reached the top and entered Central Park about 30s behind my time.

That first half of Central Park was... interesting. In my original race plan, I was thinking I'd reach Central Park and then maybe SEND IT when going down the initial hill (Cat Hill), reaching my 10k or even 5k pace. That's what I had done during one of my pre-race training runs and it felt great.

In reality it didn't work that well here. I was still feeling strong, but I didn't have the legs left to go too fast. I did good speed (slightly below my HM pace I'd say), and regained some of my lost time, but couldn't go much faster than that.

After that, the rolling hills of Central Park seemed to go on forever! I was in a daze and I could swear someone had doubled the amount of time we had to spend in Central Park... it was curve after curve. I did well, but couldn't wait for it to end.

I was so dazed I missed the 40k marker (I was doing ""manual laps"" every 5k on my watch, but missed that one).

Near the end of that stretch, someone screamed at me in support of one of my jersey's team main rivals (in jest). I appreciated the humor. I like the roasts more than the blind support.

#### 40k-end

As the hills gave way to the final stretch of 59th street, I was a bit apprehensive once again. Things were tough, but going according to plan so far... but I know the final stretch was a climb. The climb of 59th would be specially annoying to me: for some reason, I hate how uneven the climb is there.

The energy of the whole even was otherworldly, though. Just the sheer amount of noise mutes everything else. Truth be told, the climb came and went unnoticed. I sped up a little bit here, as I entered the last mile, trying to give it more juice and make up for a bit of my lost time. I decided I didn't want to check my watch anymore. I knew I wasn't going to recoup the 30-ish seconds I was behind, but I was going to try and improve things a bit.

I ran a bit until we got to the last 320m (""0.2 miles"") and steadily got faster until the end. I was one of those try-hard weirdos passing people 30ft away from the finish line.

I reached the finish line at 3:28:21 at my 10k-ish pace. I stumbled a bit over the finish line and had to stabilize myself, to prevent myself from bumping onto all the genius runners that decided to stop completely over the timing mat.

It took me a while to understand: I had finished the race. There was no more running to be had. My knees went wobbly. I had some severe (superficial) pain on the sole of my right feet.

### Post-race

After the race, I did the expected zombie walk out of the area. I walked slowly and in a daze. I tried soaking it all in and not using my phone much. I texted with my wife to let her know how things went. I don't remember much from this part; I was basically looking down. I got my medal, my care package (water, Gatorade, Maurten bar, apple, mini-pretzels), and their AWESOME poncho.

I stopped to put my stuff on the ground to take one of the medal pictures, and then couldn't bend over to pick it up afterwards.

I walked out of the park at some point. Things around the area were nuts. Too many people - families and friends trying to meet runners. I walked a bit, slowly regaining my wits. My legs were shot, my neck and back were killing me, but I decided to walk a bit for the blood to circulate and all that.

At some point I walked into a Pret and got a sandwich to try and fuel up. I couldn't eat it. I also spilled half of my juice on my leg. I wanted to take my right shoe off. Yeah, I was still a bit off.

Eventually I walked some more (for a total of 7k or so), got into a subway, and headed back to the hotel. Got a lot of ""congrats!"" on the way, chatted with a few people (spectators) and probably, maybe, even behaved as a normal person most of the time. I got to my hotel, showered, couldn't nap, changed into civilian clothes, promptly lost my Garmin charger somewhere in the hotel room, checked out, and headed home to help with dinner for the kids.

By that night, my body was almost recovered. Except for my quads, nothing was in pain or sore, surprisingly. The soreness in the quads was expected because of the downhills, and lasted for about 3 days afterwards.

### Final thoughts

I think this was an amazing race - one of the races I'm most proud of, and certainly my strongest Marathon.

Regardless of the finish time, it's a race I was able to keep on a even pace all the way (accounting for hills). This is the first time I was able to do it; previously, I'd go at a target pace and start fading away at mile 20.

I wasn't able to give as much of a kick at the end as I would have liked, but that's no big deal. I did have SOME kick, and finished reasonably within my target time. My main goal was the sub-3:30, and getting to that with over a minute to spare, feeling good, and not having walked, was exhilarating.

I'm of the opinion you learn more from your failures than your successes. As such, there's not a ton I ""learned"" from this race that I have to correct. Feels weird! But I think I reaffirmed a bunch of things that were still unproven. Some idle thoughts:

* Using Pace Pro with a planned course and pace plan worked like magic. I'm certainly doing that going forward for longer races. I'm not sure why more people are not talking about it. Maybe they don't need it. But for me, it worked wonders. When I got home my wife was so impressed she told me ""you should be a pacer"", which is about the best compliment I ever got from my running (thanks, Garmin Pace Pro and random strangers!).
* I'm not super sold on Stryd. I love it for the real-time pace, and I'm enjoying the metrics about leg differences while I recover from m injury. But I'm not sure it's worth much more after that. It's certainly expensive, and the paid premium service (which I'm trying out) doesn't seem to justify itself. Maybe there's some hidden magic behind ""training with power"", but I don't see it either.
* New York is a great race. I enjoyed it! But I'm not one of those people who think it's ""THE BEST RACE IN THE WORLD"". Maybe I'm too much of an introvert. But the fact that it's so hard to get into the race is a turnoff for me. I want to do more exotic Marathons rather than doing NYCM again, even though I live here.
* I'm still a bit surprised at home my re-juggling of workouts worked. I used to be a bit lost trying to follow training programs, not knowing what was important and how. This training left me way more confident on my ability to adapt things to my liking and needs. Next time I'll probably find some variation of a Jack Daniels' plan, but I'll certainly adapt some workouts as well.
* Thinks could probably have gone even better with longer runs/longer mileage. I wish I could have done that. But I think this report is a good counterpoint for people who are adamant weekly mileage is the one factor to take into account, that you can't do sub-4h without 70mpw (yes, I've read people saying it), etc.

Each month, I tell myself I’ll set something aside, but somehow it gets eaten up by the end of the month, sometimes leaving me needing to dip into credit just to make it to payday. I’ve already cut out anything that’s not essential—streaming subscriptions, coffee runs, and any takeout. I want to build an emergency fund, but my budget feels stretched to the max already.  
  
Recently, I had a bit of unexpected cash come my way, which was a small relief, but I know that won’t happen every month. I’m wondering if even setting aside small amounts could add up or if it’ll just feel like pennies in the bigger picture. I’ve heard about people doing things like the “envelope method” or tracking every dollar, but I’m worried it’ll just end up discouraging me further if I don’t see much progress. I want to know what strategies people in similar situations have used to save, even when it feels impossible.  
  
For those who have successfully saved while living paycheck to paycheck, did you focus on eliminating debt first, set mini savings goals, or find other ways to make it work? Any creative tips for finding extra room in a tight budget or staying motivated would be a huge help.

Have had all the usual tests and scans. Have been controlling it with OTC Omeprazole and Esomeprazole most of that time.  About 2 years ago, i got covid twice, once with pneumonia (I am asthmatic and immunocompromised so this is not unusual). Since then, nothing will control my reflux. Not Pepcid, PPIs, Gaviscon, Tums, nothing. Foods that should not cause heartburn were triggering.  Even a protein shake (like Boost or Ensure) would trigger it. In fact, just taking the PPI gave me instant reflux. I have tried literally every antacid known to man and every PPI the doctor can prescribe.  I tried intermittent fasting and it helped somewhat but there were literally only 10 foods I could eat. I was resolved that surgery was going to be my only option,  but was warned about side effects and recovery time. 

In the meantime,  I met my insurance deductible for the year so finally decided to get my chronic sinusitis evaluated. The ENT discovered that I had a badly deviated septum,  an extra hole in my sinus cavity (not drug related, lol) and LOTS of scar tissue from a botched balloon sinuplasty 11 years ago. I am now 5 weeks post surgery (FESS, Sinuplasty and Vivaer) and can breathe better than I have ever breathed in my life. I still have months to go before I am fully healed but every day is better. 

I mention all this because a bizarre side effect of the sinus surgery is that it appears to have cured my GERD. I have heard lots of stories about GERD causing sinus issues, but this wasn't my issue, and besides, it's the opposite.  I can drink coffee when I haven't had it in a year! I am certainly not pushing the issue by keeping trigger foods to a minimum and keeping Pepcid and Tums handy. After years of weaning myself off these foods, I find that I don't even crave them anymore.  I do still find that if I eat after 7pm or overeat in general, it can give me heartburn, but nothing a couple of Tums won't fix. I can't find any stories like mine anywhere. The ENT seems baffled other than perhaps post-nasal drip was causing the GERD. HAS ANYONE experienced anything like this or am I a freak of nature? I am beyond grateful and feel like my prayers have been answered but would love an explanation or at least to know that I am not alone. ",4,1730929568.0,GERD,0,1.0,False
1gla2i4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/comments/1gla2i4/betrayed_and_want_to_work_on_it/,Betrayed and want to work on it,"A few weeks ago, I found out the most crushing truth: my wife cheated on me. And not just in some small, forgettable way—it was brutal, devastating, and completely unimaginable.

I trusted her with every fiber of my being. After all we’d been through—our rocky start, the mistakes we both made in the past, but ultimately the life we built together—I thought we were solid. We had two beautiful kids, we laughed together, we shared joy, and we had a strong connection. At least, that’s what I thought.

But then we moved abroad—back to her home country. We had our second child, and I didn’t see it at the time, but that’s when everything began to shift. She started using drugs. Naturally, I was concerned, but instead of confronting it, I pulled away. I felt like she was choosing the drugs over her family, over me. I resented her for it—deeply. I came home to a house in disarray, no help with the kids, no effort on her part to make things better. I took on everything. And the worst part was that I let that resentment build and fester. 

But then, sometimes, when she’d get sober for a few days, things felt okay again. We’d reconnect, enjoy family time, and the intimacy between us would feel incredible. But when that faded, the resentment would return, and so would the distance between us. I didn’t see it at the time, but I wasn’t there for her. I neglected her emotionally. I didn’t stop to think about her struggles—her depression, her internal battles. I just focused on my own pain and frustration. The spark between us started to fade, even the sex, which had once been so passionate. I thought everything was just in a rough patch. 

And then, she cheated. She told me it was because she felt neglected, alone, and emotionally abandoned. I don’t completely blame her for that—because I played a part in it too—but the pain of knowing someone else was there for her when I wasn’t, that someone else felt the things I didn’t give her, is excruciating.

She told me that she wants to work things out. She says she still loves me, and we’ve been trying to work through this together. But the truth is, I’m terrified. Terrified of losing her. I’ve taken her for granted in ways I never realized. Now, I appreciate everything about her more than ever—her beauty, her laugh, the way she smells—it all feels so much more precious to me now. I’ve been doing everything I can to make this right. I’ve watched countless videos on emotional availability, read self-help books, tried to be a better listener. But even as I’m doing all this, it feels like I’m the only one trying.

Here’s where we are now: We both agree that we want to try to make this work. We’re starting couples therapy. But she’s still talking to him. Every day. She hasn’t met him for coffee yet, but she wants to—she says she needs closure, to tell him in person that it’s over. And I just can’t understand it. How can this man, someone she’s known for just a few weeks, have such a hold on her when we’ve been together for ten years, when we’ve been through everything life can throw at us?

I told her I didn’t want her to meet him. I don’t want her to give him that kind of closure, to see him one last time. But she insists, and I reluctantly agreed. And now, they’re still messaging every day. It drives me crazy. Every time I check her phone, every time I invade her privacy, it feels like I’m losing my mind. But I can’t help it. The trust is gone, shattered completely. I’ve never struggled with trust before, and now it’s all I can think about. Every time I do something I swore I would never do—like checking her phone—I feel more and more like I’m losing control.

And every time I confront her about it, we fight. The progress we’ve made feels like it’s erased in an instant. We’re stuck. I don’t know how to move forward when everything feels so broken. How do you rebuild trust when it’s been shattered so badly? How do I act like everything is okay, like we’re still a family, when inside, I feel like I’m falling apart? How do I stop being consumed by jealousy, by the need to check her phone, by the constant fear that she might still have these feelings for him. 

She says she’s doing this for *us*, for the kids, that she wants to make it work. But I’m starting to feel like I’m just a placeholder. Like I’m here waiting, hoping she’ll come back to me, but not knowing if she ever will.

I’m lost. I don’t know what to do. Should I give her more space? Should I just pull back completely and let her figure it out on her own? Is it time for me to stop caring so much? Should I just focus on being a good dad and stop trying to fix things with her? 

I’m struggling to see the light at the end of this tunnel. And I’m scared. I don’t know if we can come back from this. I don’t know if I can trust her again. And I don’t know how to stop the constant pain. 

Any advice would help. But I feel like no one really understands what this feels like.",1,1730929553.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,3,1.0,False

\---<Might just need special glasses>---

Started out of state out of nowhere, triggered by lord knows what and made infinitely worse by being in a moving vehicle (that was not a fun 4 hour ride home on the highway).. full mental breakdown, only things I could say were ""no no no"", a few swears and ""Im gonna puke"" (which I never did interestingly enough nor do I ever..) got home to 3 days of intense anxiety which finally abated. Spent several years slowly acclimating myself to leaving the house. Couldn't go into stores at all and once I finally could I had trouble waiting in lines. Trouble being around large groups of other people. over the years I had some downturns where the anxiety would get me and I'd have to stop whatever progress Id made and take time off but eventually wound up working again at a great place. Seasonal so I got 4 months off. Been there 6 years now with most all symptoms gone. had some pretty bad anxiety last year but I figured it was just end of year burnout and wrote it off, kept going this year. No problems until end of September, the day started out with some nausea, I figured 'too much coffee' and kept going. on the way home had a repeat full-blown panic attack rolling around my head like my brain was in a bender. managed to drive a mile or so til I found a spot to pull off and wandered around the edge of the woods for an hour and a half til the series of rolling panic attacks eventually calmed down and I could get home. soon as I was on the road again the anxiety came back but manageable enough I stopped for gas on the way back in. next few weeks were odd, sometimes driving was fine sometimes I rode the razors edge of not being able to focus (cant talk straight, abject terror, BPMs in the high 120s (I have one of those finger clip things that measures that), feel extremely hot, trouble focusing, dizzy beyond dizzy, nausea in the upper stomach/lower esophagus, etc). Its to the point now where I have trouble driving a quarter mile up the road to the dump every week.. and thats WITH lorazepam.

The interesting part of this all, from diagnoses via doctors to various antidepressants they tried to stick me on to the various conditions they all threw at me.. having the attacks again with such intensity Ive started to notice a pattern to their occurrences.. usually driving past other cars on the road. Turns out theres a condition called BVD where your eyes arent in perfect alignment and can cause a lot of the symptoms of panic disorder. It fits for me since riding passenger through busy areas sometimes causes me to get 'information overload' and get dizzy, then nauseous, then anxious and eventually to have a panic attack.. and sometimes Id be fine driving through these places. Im a week out from my appointment for BVD evaluation and the anxiety wont stop since Im deathly afraid of having another panic attack during the travel, being trapped at an ophthalmologists office for a couple hours then travel again but Im hoping the benzos will help me through.. granted they dont always work for the panic spikes.

tl;dr - after dealing with doctors throwing pills at me for over a decade I may just need a gosh darn set of prism glasses for a condition called BVD (Binocular Vision Dysfunction). I never knew this was a thing and wish someone had mentioned it years and years ago for me, so.. here you all go. If you get anxiety in big stores, in crowds, while having cars drive past, have trouble reading or get headaches or have meh eyesight even with normal glasses.. check out the condition.

I dont know if suggesting you google BVD counts as 'medical advice' or not but hey if pills aren't helping and glasses will, Im posting for the possibility regardless.",1,1730929545.0,panicdisorder,0,1.0,False

The thoughts that fly around my head are really annoying and I’m unfocused and I am pretty sure that I’m OCD. I want to blame it on everyone around me and say that they’re uninvolved your unsensitive but really it’s me who is overly sensitive and triggered by the energy around me. Feeling myself be judged or just exist is very uncomfortable to me right now. I just went through a break up so I think it has something to do with why my energy is so exposed. I also spoke with a hypnotherapist yesterday who, after listening to me rant for a little little while asked me about my relationship with my mom.

This happened so consistently that I thought that it was actually OK and it’s just simply who I am that deserves to be treated like trash.

During this time, I've been on countless dates, all but one of which has been through Hinge or Bumble. A handful of these multitudes of meetings I halfheartedly took further. They lasted 3-4 months max. 

The past 6 months of app-dating has been the worst I've ever experienced. Ghosting, dishonesty, erratic behaviour etc. Utterly, soul destroying. I persisted only because I thought it was the only game in town and I'm determined to find a life partner. 

And then, a couple of weeks ago, I found myself at an event standing next to a women in a striking coat. Without really thinking, I complimented her fashion choice. After the event, I asked if she wanted to join me for a coffee and she accepted the invitation. Incredibly, for two strangers who had just met, we vibed amazingly well.

Since then, we've met up once more, spending several hours together and talking non-stop. Our next meet is coming up soon. We've been texting frequently in the meanwhile. Whereas app-dating almost always feels like a grind, this feels genuinely exciting. 

Obviously, it's still very early on and I can't know whether this will ultimately go anywhere or not. But even if it doesn't, I won't go back to the apps. I'll trust in the universe instead. 

Don't be afraid to seek out organic encounters - particular in those spaces that bring people with shared values together. I genuinely believe that this provides a much firmer foundation for a relationship than the contrived bullshit that is app-dating.

I love coffee but I'm new to drinking filtered coffee. I want to buy one that has dishwasher safe parts.   
  
1. What brand and type do you recommend? I checked online, the price ranges between 15 euros to 250 euros or more. I'm not sure if I should go for a cheaper one or a more expensive one. I think less than 60 euros is a reasonable price. 

2. Does the flavor differ greatly according to the machine quality?

3. How long your coffee machine had lasted?

Thank you.

I am currently supporting my wife through grad school, she graduates in May and will be back in the work force come July. She is likely to make $80-$90k when she returns to work. I currently make $133k through a business which I own 5% of with a vesting schedule to own an additional 5% in the coming years. We have no debt other than student debt for my wife at $20k and the business pays for my car, WiFi, gas, phone, health insurance and laptop and coffees etc. 

I grew up in a low income family in Europe and moved to the states, started a business and am now looking to set up my life in a way where I can build a vibrant and secure life for my family. I also want to set my wife and I up for a great retirement which I know starts now. My plan is as follows, please give me your honest opinion: 

1. We are moving in with her parents for a year and both working together to save $100k which I want to put in taxable brokerage account. I need help with what to invest in, VOO? I will aim to contribute an additional $6k a year to this and forget about it for the next 30+ years. We will also begin saving for our emergency fund and keep that in a high yield savings account. 
2. I will also begin to max out my 401(k) and keep that going until I retire. We will do the company match with my wife’s new employer because we will need the cash. The hope is to eventually max this out. 
3. After a year, we will then move out and get a cheap 2 bedroom rental beside her parents and begin to save for a house and take advantage of free childcare while we can. 
4. I will live my life with my reduced salary due to the max 401(k) contribution and invest any bonuses and distribution through the business into maxing my ROTH IRA and funding the brokerage account. 
5. Continue to grow the business and work my salary up to $150-$175k over the coming years.  
6. Start a college fund for my kid(s) once we get settled and have a decent savings under us.

1gl9lbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1gl9lbx/hr_my_child_hasnt_been_sleeping_part_1/,[HR] My child hasn't been sleeping.. (part 1),"Hello,

Let me start by saying I don't believe in curses and I am not religious. My name is Doug, and my wife and I have struggled with our son. He has sleep problems that just came from nowhere. It all started one night, it was only a week or so ago, on the night of the first rainfall, we live in a pretty small eastern coastal town of Briggem, so when it rains it can get pretty bad. I was at my home watching reruns of Miami Vice, while my wife was getting dinner ready. We live in my childhood home, a single story. I had our youngest daughter in her walker. When the rain started to hit the window.

That was when Charlotte and I realized we didn't know where Finn, our 10-year-old was. We called all over from his friends' parents to the school. No one knew. My wife started to blame me, while I was getting my coat on to go - at this point, I was a few beers down the chute when I opened the door ignoring my wife's rant - and there he was. He stood there on the front step, drenched. I don't know how long he was there or what I just took my son in and hugged him. I carried him inside and put a towel around him, trying to warm him up. My wife started to draw a bath, through her cloudy eyes. I asked him where he was and why no one knew where he went.

He just said, ""I wanted to go to the woods."" I didn't find anything wrong with this, I used to go to the same woods all the time when I was a kid with my brother and with friends.

""Near the creek?""

He nodded.

""Did you see anything?""

My boy just looked up at me his blue lips barely hanging onto his face and shook his head.

""Something red.""

I didn't know what the hell that meant so I helped walk him over to the bathroom where my wife was and she started to take care of him. I just walked back towards the family room, aghast at what I allowed to happen. I didn't know what to do so I just thanked whoever was listening in my head.

My wife and I knew that he was probably going to get a cold or something worse from this, so we kept an ear open and barely slept ourselves that night. His coughs kept us up as we took shifts while sitting nearby. Some were empty like a wheeze scratching the walls of his throat while they escaped, others were full of gunk and sludge, followed by him rolling over and spitting the excess in the nearby trashcan. It was around 5 am when I tapped my wife out, letting her go to sleep for an hour or so. I sat there after brewing some coffee and listened to Finn go through hell. In Times like this it's good to have a wife who's as caring as Charlotte, when I have to go to work, I know that she will be here with my kids. I was slightly nodding off around 5:30 before I awoke. Something was off, I didn't know why yet but I could feel it.

That was when it hit me. I was dozing off because the house was silent. I jumped up from my seat and ran into my son's room. The door slammed against the wall as I dove at my son fearing the worst. Swearing at myself for not taking him to the emergency room. But, as I got to him I realized his chest moving up and down. He was fine. He was better than fine, he looked as peaceful as ever sleeping. Lying on his side, his left hand under his head. Even my landing on him barely made him budge. I scratched my head looking around. When I looked in his garbage off the edge of the bed, where I imagined seeing a mound of phlegm and mucus but nothing was in there. Nothing at all. Thinking I lost my mind I just shook my head and walked out of his room. Over a day or so Finn was all back to normal health and at school.

A few nights later, it happened. I got up out of bed around 1 am, I was the one having trouble that night. I walked into our kitchen and opened the fridge, reaching into the case and opening the tab on the side so it wouldn't crack too loud and wake my wife. I took a long sip of it, following it with a loud breath. The cool lager put my mind at ease as I turned from the fridge - he stood there. Half covered by the door frame he watched me. I put the can behind my back, failing to hide what he clearly already saw.

""What's up, buddy?""

""Why do you drink so late Dad?""

I just shrugged bringing the tone down in the conversation to again not wake my wife. I put my finger up to my mouth to shush him a little. I opened my mouth to try to answer -

""Do you drink because of Kevin?""

My answer got caught in my throat before it could exit. He blinked at me - twice. Then he turned around and went into his room. Leaving me speechless. I could only clench my teeth together, hidden behind my cheeks. I drank the last bit of my beer and couldn't help but open another.

I barely told Finn about Kevin. I barely told Charlotte. I kept it in my head, and just with my parents. I still never understood. Kevin was my little brother. I don't know if I wanted to get into it. But, over the last few nights, I need to talk about it. See Finn has gotten worse, not coughing or anything he hasn't been right. He just hasn't slept, at all. It was bad, Charlotte found him one night, she checked on him just slipping her head through the cracked door. He was in bed, but sitting straight up. Staring at the wall, he didn't even turn to her when she called him. He was in a trance, mouth open, his breathing in deep and out shallow. She ran over to him, rubbing his back his breathing got better but his eyes stayed on the wall. When she came to our room and told me, I had nothing to say, I chalked it up to maybe a horror show or movie he caught when we weren't paying attention. I told her that I was going to check on him as she got into bed, I left my room but on my way to his something overtook me. I couldn't have him ask more about Kevin, at least not yet.

I turned into my kitchen and grabbed my bottle of vodka from above the fridge and walked out into my garage. I only took a few pulls, but it was hard to keep down, I got so used to just beer. I walked into my home after getting a good bit of the bottle down. I put it back grabbed the OJ carton out of the fridge, and took a few sips out of it. That's when I heard the giggling coming from the crack of Finn's room. It was light and soft, but it creeped the hell out of me. I decided to try to look in the room myself, the dark room was only lit by the window above his bed. But, he wasn't in it. The sheets and covers were thrown to the side. Then I heard the giggles, there were two of them. My head whipped over towards my right where Finn stood by his wall. I turned to the lights on in fear, as Finn slowly turned to me. I looked in the room for a second.

""Go to bed, Finn.""

He nodded and slowly walked back to his bed. I shut off the light after taking one more look in the room. I couldn't sleep that night. Not a minute. Because, before I turned his lights on, I could have sworn I saw a hand reaching and touching my son's face.

The next morning I was out and about I forgot what for, but on my way home I saw the flashing lights. I saw the ambulance rush past me out of my neighborhood. I feared the worst and sped home. I found my wife on the porch, crying on the phone. I jumped out of the car and held her asking her what happened.

She told me this verbatim: She was doing laundry, and our daughter was in the living room bouncing. She went to bring folded laundry into Finn's room, hoping that he was napping and catching some sleep. She didn't even knock; she just barely opened it - she saw him in there. She saw our boy standing in the center of his room, arched backward, his head almost touching his calves. She couldn't breathe, as Finn's right arm started to rise in the air, that's when she noticed that he wasn't standing. His feet were inches off the ground. When she screamed that was when he fell.

I just took my wife into my arms. Holding her there, confused as all hell. Hoping this one moment could last forever before we would have to find out what was wrong with our boy, by her words he had to be paralyzed with a broken back. I then ushered her into the car, running back inside and grabbing our baby girl. Before we were off to the hospital.

So, now it's time to talk about my brother Kevin. I think it's time that I bring up Kevin. Kevin was my younger brother, he was only 8 years old when he got sick. At first, it came off as the flu, he was bedridden and only missed a few days of school. I remember it like it was yesterday because frankly, it was all so odd. Kevin got home late the day before his sickness. He was always a sprite and fun kid, always looking for an adventure even at a young age. I always took him places too, because he could keep up with 13-year-old me on any bike ride. He had this gummy smile and an infatuation with Superman.

We weren't rich or anything growing up, so my mom had bought him a cheap cape from a hand-me-down store. For the next year, he always wore that cape, while he was biking down to his friend Anthony's house, I remember it always flailing in the wind as if he were flying in the air.

After he got sick, I don't remember him putting it on ever again. He came home that day. From what I remember my mother telling me, rest her soul, that he walked into the house for the first time in complete silence. He got ready for bed without eating anything, and that was it. In that bed, he stayed for days. I would always knock to see if he wanted to do anything and he would refuse. During those days, I started to feel off. I woke up one night in complete sweat, confused and not remembering my dream that I had I left my bed and went into my kitchen. I poured a cup of water and chugged it as it was so cold it burned my throat. I took a second and then went to go back to bed.

When I heard something soft coming from inside Kevin's room, behind the closed door. I stopped and put my ear to it. It sounded like he was talking to himself. It sounded like he was maybe giggling. Then it sounded like two voices talking at the same time. They overlapped each other, but no distinct words were actually being stated. I held my ear there longer maybe to get a nugget of information. Then the voices stopped. A coldness drafted up my spine, a bead of sweat down my nose.

""Dougie."" The voices said.

I backed away fast and ran into my room. Clawing into my bed, and sitting there. I didn't sleep the rest of the night. It took only twenty or so minutes when I started to hear creaks from outside my room. I stared at the door, terrified of my own little brother. Scared of how he knew it was me outside his room. But, when I saw the shadows cross underneath my door. I saw two sets of legs. Just standing there. No knocks on my door, no whispers, nothing. Those legs stood there, motionlessly for ten minutes. Before, they turned back to his room. I just stared and stared all night.

From there things took a turn for the worse. Kevin slid into a brain coma due to a lack of oxygen a few days later. He then died a week after that, fluid in his lungs built up to the point of suffocation but the doctors never detected it. It always seemed like he was breathing normally to everyone that checked. He was only eight years old. It was odd too, because after he got sick, I remember his buddy Anthony started to miss school as well.

I always hated myself for being afraid of him. His saying Dougie outside of his door could have been a call for help, it could have meant anything. But, young me mistook it for something frightening something that was meant to warn me to stay away from my only brother. That's why I bought my home, my old childhood home, as a reminder of my brother and what he meant to me. I still keep it deep down though, I rarely talk about it to my wife, and never to my son. Kevin almost completely died when my parents passed away. The only people that really might remember him are Anthony and I. We don't really speak, I say hi whenever I walk into him at the liquor store. He has been looking worse. But, we both know and we both remember.

When Charlotte and I got to the hospital, they were running tests on Finn. Finn never looked more alive. He was sitting up in his chair and smiling with the nurses. My wife through tears looked as confused as everyone else did once they saw her. She ran up and held our son in the brightest embrace, like the first time she ever held him. I stood there, my wife doesn't lie. My wife doesn't over-impose anything. How did she see what she saw? How is it that now I am being told that Finn is doing great and that we can take him back in only a few hours? I insisted that they watch him and take care of him for at least a night. But, they needed the bed in case of an emergency. I was at that point done with the conversation and didn't want to expedite it further, maybe upsetting my wife and son who have both been through a lot.

We got home that night and I carried my son into the house while my wife carried our daughter. We laid them both to bed. I told my wife to call the police if anything happened, but that I needed to go somewhere. We had a light argument. Before I told her that I had to go to the creek. That was the last place Finn was before he got sick. She didn't want to hear it but she knew that it wasn't the worst decision. Before I left, she stopped me. She asked me if I believed her and if I didn't think she was crazy for what she told me. I told her of course. That I was as confused as she was. I kissed her and then I left.

Driving up to the woods at night can be daunting. Darkness. It was even worse because it took everything that I had to not pull into any of the bright signs above the bars that I passed. Drink it away. Drink the thought of Kevin, the thought of my home, and the thought of anything all away. But, I pushed on. Now that I made my decision, I moved into the bush, through the trees, and into the dirt. Hindsight was 20/20 because I forgot a flashlight but I knew my way. Even though it has been 20 or so years since I last came down here, this place has been sunken deep into my soul. I made it to the low-tide creek and stood over it on the bank. It was filled with leaves, and couldn't have been any more than a few inches deep. This creek used to be big for fishing.

I barely heard anything other than the light water going against rocks, no squirrels, no owls, nothing but the creek. I looked around and realized that my hope was all but lost. What was I even expected to find here that I came all this way? Left my wife at home with our kids. I turned and walked the creek a bit. Looking up and down, the big bright moon cut its way through the tree limbs and guided my trail a little.

Then I swore I felt it, something grabbed my ankle as I turned and fell down into the water. The water didn't expect me and I smack against it. My head hit the edge of a rock and I stayed in the water for a second using it to cover my scream of agony. I then pulled myself up and looked around. I swore I felt something grab me, that I didn't just catch the lip of the bank. That I wasn't that clumsy. I swear it. I clung to the dirt as I crawled up the side of the bank, hoping that my head wasn't bleeding too badly. I got to the edge and looked over, it was then that I saw it.

I saw what Finn saw. It was red, but it was covered. I got out of the bank and ran up to it. I looked down, and my heart sank. It couldn't be it just wouldn't make sense. But, I knelt down moving everything that was on top of it all the leaves and broken branches, and picked it up in my hands. I knew the material and the way that it would move in the air. As if it were just yesterday.

I was holding back tears, as I looked down at Kevin's old cape.

A feeling overflowed me, and my head snapped as if I had been plugged into a computer. Everything came to me at once, every memory, every feeling, why I was so awkwardly terrified that night with Kevin. I ran through the trees back to the road, back to my car, and hopefully back to safety. I just hoped through the pain of my grip on my brother's scarlet cape. I drove home in silence. The lights of the bars hadn't lost their appeal, they shined even brighter. But, I pushed ahead. I needed to get back to Charlotte. To my wife, to my son, and to my daughter.

I pulled onto the driveway. I walked up opening the door. Charlotte jumped at the door when I walked in. She was wide awake on the couch. I looked at her, with every word on the tip of my tongue ready to spill. But, just one glance at her was enough. I think she saw something was wrong, I hope she did. Because I stood there and I wept. I fell to my knees, as I couldn't hold back anymore. She stood up and this time, she held me while I didn't have the strength myself.

When I touched that cape, it took over and I couldn't let go as much as I wanted to. All of the memories that I pushed out that I didn't care for, flooded back into my mind. They clenched on with knives and bit with teeth as they seeped back into my brain.

I then told Charlotte, about my last day with Kevin before he slipped into his coma. I was in the living room watching television when I heard him coughing from his room. I went to go check on him, and there I saw him sitting straight up in his bed like he was waiting for me. I went and sat at his side.

""How are you feeling Kevin?""

""Good. How are you?""

I nodded at him.

""Dougie, I never got to tell you something.""

""What's that?""

""Well, it's just that I am worried for you.""

""Why are you worried?""

Something in the corner of my eye caught my attention, and I looked down at his trash.

Inside the bin laid a large mound of black gunk, which must have been a week's storage.

""Because you're son is going to die just like I will.""

I looked at him.

It wasn't my brother. His eyes were flooded with black sewage as it dripped and creased through his face, his teeth were rotted to the gums, the gums grey to the gills. I jumped as he looked up at the ceiling and his mouth opened - then like a fountain blackness canvased out of his mouth and to the ceiling. I looked at it for a moment and fell to the ground. Knocking me out.

I awoke on the couch. It took every bit of strength of mine to go back to the room to find any evidence of the accident happening, but I walked inside of the room and it looked just as clean as when I entered prior. I waited for my parents to get home and when they did I told them about it.

""Don't rile your brother up with these hysterics!""

""Your mother has been going through so much with all of this, why bring up this? You need to stop watching those horror movies with your friends!""

That is all I got.

I stayed silent, I thought it was all in my head. I remember it so clearly now.

Because, after touching that cape it all became so clear. Everything aligned correctly. That night, when I heard Kevin whispering in his room, and when he stood outside my door, that was three days after he slipped into a coma.

If anyone lives or has lived in Briggem if anyone knows anything about the creek in the woods. If anyone has any idea what the hell might be happening to my son. Please, and by all means reach out. My family is so lost. I am terrified for my son Finn. Because he collapsed today, we had to bring him into the hospital, and about an hour ago, the doctors told me that he was building a large amount of fluid in his lungs, more than the normal case of pneumonia. I am afraid what happened to my brother might happen to him.

If anyone can, please help us.",1,1730928335.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

For my Mom's whole life up to until she was 30 or so she lived with her parents who were controlling and manipulative. When I turned 8 my Mom finally found a relationship with somebody but her parents weren't having it and would harass us and file court proceedings claiming her husband was a predator (which he wasn't) and also while she was with him she became pregnant with my sister, but for some reason my Mom decided to divorce him under my Grandpas suggestion and move to Panama with them, in retrospect to isolate her and get control over her. For a while everything went well, I was in school, made a few friends and gaming became a hobby, but after 6 months when my sister was born my grandma said something about my other dad that pissed my mom off so much she snapped and moved out within an hour and told me I'd never get to live grandparents again, being 8 this was very traumatic. She quickly rented a house and invited here divorced husband to Panama and remarried him and life kind of returned to normal.... for about 2 weeks. My grandpa caught wind of it and was so enraged he tried attacking my Mom by breaking in and I remember walking outside hugging my mom crying( her husband arrived a little while later). Afterwards my mom took a taxi to David, picked her partner up and tried returning to a normal life. A week goes by, the police show up and tell us to get in the car and drive us over to court for seemingly no reason. At this point everything is a blur, I was interviewed by a phycologist lady idk and she began to cry and me not knowing that my statements as an 8 year old would determine what happens next I thought everything was ok and it should of been. The judge had been bribed. There was nothing on earth we could do. Men in black suits showed up ripped my 3 month old nursing sister from my mothers arms, grabbed me by the arms and legs and physically ripped me away from my mother, threw me into a van and drove me to Casa Hogar Triscar, an orphanage with kids just like me.

This was longest I'd ever been away from my mother and was extremely traumatic. The first thing that happened was a lady screamed take my clothes off and get in the shower which was freezing and then got me dressed and left me in a large room with around 200 other kids watching the movie ""Trolls"" on repeat all day every day. I cried myself to sleep every night and prayed I would get out of there, miraculously my Mom got me out of there within a week but couldn't have custody of me so she left me with a nice woman named Patsy.

Again my grandparents found out what happened and began stalking us and the lady got scared and I think I somehow ended up at some resort place with my Grandma since my Mom had a protective order on my Grandpa. I played xplane 10 everyday and my Mom had visitation rights, here comes the absolute batshit crazy part of this story. One night my mom comes over and visits like usual but unbeknownst to me and my Grandma was that I kid you not a WHITE VAN was sitting in the street. My Mom grabs me by the arm in my pajamas into the pouring rain into a white van and drives off with her husband and a native guy to the San Blas Indian reservation across the entire country on the border of Columbia, we made it all the way across the country but we were wanted and got caught at a checkpoint, I think that was most terrified I've ever been. We got shipped back across the country in yet another white van, the Native guy who helped us was put in prison my Mom also scarily was almost put in prison for 10 years for ""kidknapping"" her own children who were ILLEGALY taken from her. I then was returned to my Grandmother and the protective order was lifted on my Grandfather and I moved to a secluded mountain coffee plantation 2500 ft. above sea level, in other words I was back to where I lived originally when I moved to Panama. This is where everything became true suffering. I was put into a Spanish speaking public school and drew for 8 hours a day and learned absolutely nothing since the teaching must of thought I was lost cause and this lasted 6 months.

On a positive note I met one of my 2 best friends Christopher but with any friendship at that age... you know things might get interesting. He introduced me to porn and I was a porn addicted, human trafficked neglected 8 year old now. My grandma pulled me out of that school and put me into a different one called the Oxford School which actually SPOKE ENGLISH. I was bullied there by a South African girl who was also ripped from her mother. I was too traumatized to learn anything and also I think they gave up on me there too because they let me draw again for 8 hours a day. There I finished second and third grade and my Grandma randomly pulled me out again  and put me into homeschool. She essentially did my school for me (4'th, 5'th and 6'th grade) and still I learned absolutely nothing and would essentially game (Roblox Phantom Forces FPS) for 7-10 hrs a week up until my mom finally rescued me and my sister. Also keep in mind my sister was also neglected and had stunted development and severe tantrums due to her not nursing during her infant years, never being disciplined ever and having very few friends. My Mom fought desperately to regain custody but the court was biased and my Grandparents had more money. Tragically one week my mom briefly left her husband to file legal paperwork and he was most likely murdered by a hitman that my Grandpa hired. He said to my Mom a while before ""See this number, it only costs 500 dollars to hire a hitman in Panama : )"" sick... When my grandpa heard the news that this ""sexual predator"" had died of an apparent ""Suic\*de he was overjoyed and told me to me to be happy too, I was not happy but I kept to myself. My Mom was at this point emotionally broken, she'd lost her two babies for 2 years, lost her husband, spent thousands of dollars on lawyers who were fucking useless to fight a biased court which took bribes from my rich grandparents. She moved to a neighboring mountain town called Volcan and met another victim of the Panamanian ""legal system"" who also lost custody of her kids but was trapped in Panama and still is to this day. Under her advice my mom travelled to the US just after the pandemic began to go to her last bastion of hope, the FBI, even then it took years for her to finally get through to them but in the meantime I still had 2 more years my grandma signed me up for a carpentry class with a very odd 40 year old man named Angelo Nelson who coincidentally was the Ex-husband of my Mom's friend. Kid after kid kept joining and one of the kids was a kid named Daniel who was older than me and his dad was some pastor, believe me this kid was nasty. He bullied me worse than the girl before, beat me up, insinuated a diagnosed OCD complex about my ""intelligence or IQ"" by calling me all sorts of derogatory statements behind the teachers back, for some reason I couldn't speak up for myself and endured this bullying for 2 years. At the same time my grandma (looping back to the beginning) being an extremist evangelical herself began indoctrinating my little 10/11 year old brain all sorts of weird religious beliefs and extremes like if I ""Blasphemed the Holy Spirit"" (I know it sounds ridiculous but I was 10/11 years old) I would go to hell forever and I believed every word of it or another example (of the many) was when the only time I expressed my feelings to her about being depressed, she said I was demonized and forced me to cough into a bucket to ""CAST OUT THE DEVILS"". At this point I was completely numb emotionally and my physical condition had deteriorated due to the constant 24/7 gaming addiction. But out of nowhere my grandma gets a call from the FBI that went somewhere along the lines of ""give this bitches kids back or were launching a full scale investigation"" and just like after 4 years of constant suffering through the best years of childhood (many experiences I haven't talked about) I was back with my mother and fled the country of Panama to the United States. (Summarized) When I got all the emotions built up for so long released themselves and I got severe religious and ""IQ"" based OCD which was left untreated for 3 months, I couldn't eat, sleep, shit or anything else cus' I'd contort myself and shriek in agony and stared blankly into nothing for hours because some voice in my was like ""I if you touch that tile you'll go blaspheme the holy spirit and you'll never be forgiven etc..."". My sister still has issues as well as my mom which I'm not trying to minimize. All this is, is my summarized experience and nothing more.",3,1730928252.0,stories,3,1.0,False

We both are introverts and I am a soft-spoken person who can talk well after getting comfortable with someone). As both of us are Christians, 80% of the conversations during the meeting was around God/religion. After the first meet, replies started coming after 2 days or a single reply throughout the entire day. In the last 7 days we must have sent only 10 messages from both sides.

I totally understand that something had happened after the first meet. Not sure if she is testing me (to see if I am keeping sane when she doesn't text/replies late) or simply keeping me as one of the options while talking to other prospects.

As a 21 years old, i am a senior student at college. Due to pandemic, i nearly lost 2 years at the start, so i was left with 4 semesters. On my junior year, i spent my time putting my grades in place, so here i am, at the middle of my last year. 

I am trying so hard to meet new people, i am trying so hard to dress really nice everyday, make my hair, put good cologne every day, i try to be helpful for everyone, i try to smile, i try to have hope everyday, every, fucking, day…

But i feel like i am at the end of my will to do this, i try to offer grabbing coffee to chat with some girls that i know, but i always get rejected. I lost like 4 people in the last 6 weeks due to this, even those who i thought that they were my friends rejected my offer and won’t even suggest for another time.

Also there was this girl that is very sweet and charming, who i knew from the last year. I tried really hard to just make her allow me into her instagram account, found her on a random day and chatted for a while, later asked on dm to grab a coffee and rejected again,

Normally i am not a person that focuses too much on these but i believe all this work and effort has depleted my self respect, and i am becoming platonic for this girl which also makes my heart pound when i see her. I can’t help but think about why it can’t happen, because for once i really wanted her to like me.

Since we are seniors many of my friends have girlfriends and they give me suggestions like it happens when you don’t expect it to be, or don’t give up your hopes or don’t stress about it, but at the same time they have someone to go home to. 

I don’t want to be seen as too materialistic or such also, i have nothing to do with body or physical attributes, i just want someone in my life to whom i can say kind things or go to concerts together, i don’t want to be alone anymore.

Sometimes i cry myself to sleep, or sometimes i find myself very stressed and down, i was a happy and exciting person, but this whole running out of time thought and not having a single person to date with makes my life really hard.

[A Trump Victory? If So, Break Glass In Case of Emergency](https://malcolmnance.substack.com/p/a-trump-victory-if-so-break-glass)

What to do if the worst happens? 

Jefferson Wrote it in the Declaration of Independence.

[Malcolm Nance](https://substack.com/@malcolmnance)Nov 06, 2024

*Authors Note:  Sometimes I astonish myself. Before I wrote my last substack about Washington’s Crossing called* [*Kneel. Pray. Win.*](https://open.substack.com/pub/malcolmnance/p/kneel-pray-win-we-have-orders-from?r=adfbl&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web) *I had written another one just in case things went South. That moment has come. The United States has voted for a dictatorship … and decisively. The Supreme Court will be lost for most of the century. Women will lose most of their reproductive rights and lives. And white people happily voted to impose tyranny over all other races and creeds. So what can you do that doesn’t involve the good Bourbon?*

 *Let’s face it: America has fundamentally changed from what it was founded to be. It is now an autocracy ruled by the white tribe. Here is what I wrote a few weeks ago for that break-glass moment. Read it and Weep.  Then get busy. We have work to do.*

*Imagine that it is Christmas morning in 1776. You are with George Washington’s army.  Midway through the crossing, the Marblehead sailors who are rowing hear something.  Before they can say a word, cannons sound all along the New Jersey side of the river.  Washington’s daring move is defeated before the boats touch dry land. Imagine British cannon fire raining down on them as surprise British troops had moved from Princeton in the night, and the Hessians were waiting to the south and raking them with gunfire. Now, picture the American experiment slowly drifting as a drowned failure under the ice of the Delaware River … and George Washington’s corpse is being paraded by German mercenaries.*

My dear readers, if you are reading this, then the worst has happened. Donald Trump has been elected the 47^(th) President of the United States.

You are likely filled with two feelings.  Some will be the same as you felt in 2016.  You feel shame and grief. But now add a complete collapse of understanding of how the Trump train hit you into the mix.  Your wits are torn asunder.  Your heart aches and is in deep throbbing pain.  You likely feel as if a close loved one has died, and you will be correct.

Like Washington, we risked a bold and daring campaign and since you are reading this, we have failed.  Benjamin Franklin’s words now ring true.   We were a Republic if we could’ve kept it.  We did not and it died today, so  Welcome to America, the Tyranny!

***The End of 248 Years of Experimenting***

What is now dying is the American experiment itself. And as our Russian enemies learned long ago (and passed on to their right-wing extremist toadies) was that the fastest way to kill Democracy was to use Democracy as the very knife to slit its throat.  We do not have a president; we now have a King with all the powers George III had at the time of the American Revolution.

In the Star Wars movie Revenge of the Sith, Queen Amidala summed it up neatly when she said, “So this is how Liberty Dies, to thunderous applause.”  Our problem is there is no Jedi order full of mystical space wizards to save us.  We did this to ourselves by popular demand.

A Trump presidency means the United States is about to get the government his sycophants voted for. You likely feel adrift as a voter of progress, goodwill, and true of heart.  We are on a boat alone in a vast ocean filled with terrible storms. But as all mariners know, there is a way for a sinking ship to save its crew and, in some instances, get back aboard and salvage it. But you can’t do it when crying, even if it’s a crying shame.

I feared for America these last few weeks; I believed we would win, but I kept a reserve of 5% caution that this could end in tragedy. (Author’s note: My prediction was 100% correct, and Trump won in a landslide.)

You are most likely feeling fear, trepidation, anxiety, and a burning pain in the middle of your gut that says things are going to get nasty. You are correct in those emotions as well. So, I will give you till the end of this article to feel all of those things and then get with the program.

At the end, I want you to have a deep, sobbing cry. Then I want you to stand up, get a hot beverage, and commit yourself to not surrendering all that you presently feel hold in your heart.

Trust me, I'm a widower, and your psychological well-being demands it.  Your family will look to you, and your friends will want to lean on you for the stalwartness you need to develop pronto.   

You must Hold Fast! That’s a nautical term to ‘grip the rope more tightly, or disaster will strike a worse blow than the first.’ Hold Fast. To what you know is right and true, and that is not MAGA. So no matter what they send at you, Hold Fast.

But Malcolm, why not just give in?

It is easy to surrender in a storm, to pass under the waves, and slowly die inside.  It is easier not to engage, go into isolation, or try comprehending the crisis that befell us. I understand it.

You may want to do what I do when the politics are at their worst. I turn on MTV and watch the vapid video show *Ridiculousness,* or I dial up *Midsomer Murders* or *Poirot* and binge for hours to cleanse my mind. But while I watch, I am also writing and formulating new ideas to help me with the predicament. I am constantly crafting new plans, whether for my house repairs, Christmas decorations, or memorial garden.  Strategizing and adopting major projects is the highest form of grief management.  Obsessively getting your affairs in order is something those of us who have lost immediate loved ones well understand. 

However, one cannot – nay, must not surrender to the sweet, cold admission that it is hard to fight. It is hard to stand against outrages, insults, and arrogance. But those are your only choices on this day of days. You can surrender to an America that is dictatorial and fascistic and will grind into the day-to-day affairs of your life without any input from you, your friends, or your family. You can let other people dictate what your life will be.  That’s why it’s called a dictatorship.  Information will now be sent to you in any form of “truth” they want you to see.

Or you can commit to taking some time off between now and inauguration day and prepare yourself for the upcoming political battle. It will not be waged with weapons of war, as many on the extreme right-wing lustfully imagine. In this struggle, you must become the ultimate ally of the true promise of the Constitution of the United States. And, like the oath, we swear in the Armed Forces that we will uphold, protect, and defend that sacred document.  The time has come for you to do the same.

I don’t want you to do it in the cheesy Q-Anon, Mike Flynn way of standing in front of a video camera and taking a fake oath for TikTok. I want you to take the moment that hurts you the most, which will likely be high noon on January 20, 2025, and hold it in your heart. Swear to yourself that you will not let this abomination abide without your voice of opposition. Be it in op-ed commentary, Twitter responses, or calling into local radio shows, Facebook, whatever – Swear to make your voice heard because suppressing your voice is next up after suppressing your vote.  In fact, they want you to suppress yourself.

Take in the words carved into the Thomas Jefferson memorial as a touchstone, “for I have sworn upon the altar of god eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.”  That’s it.  That’s your mission statement. Better memorize it because every form of tyranny over the mind of man is about to be imposed on you.



***Remember Rockwell Too***

Interestingly, the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, is one of my favorite places in the world. My greatest pleasure is walking into the hall of the Four Freedoms. It has Rockwell’s four iconic paintings facing each other, including the Thanksgiving dinner table themed Freedom from Want.  Next is the chilling Freedom from Fear, with the father and mother tucking their sons into bed while reading a newspaper about men dying in the European war. Next is the beautiful Freedom of Worship with its multinational, multi-ethnic hands in prayer.  However, the one that touches me the most is freedom of speech.  I gasp every time I see it.  You must embrace its meaning.  You must stand up, even when afraid, and say what you mean and feel.  Right now, you feel a miasma of grief and pain.  But learn to stand up and say what you mean.  Tell everyone what you think is right, honorable, and true … before it is illegal.

Tomorrow, you may feel anger and a desire for change.  OK, Stand up and say it.  Soon, you may have to choose if you will protest if and when America lurches into a complete dictatorship and/or civil war.  But once you have stood up and said you intend to speak up, remember these immortal words at the end of the Declaration of Independence: [""We mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.""](https://founding.com/our-lives-our-fortunes-and-our-sacred-honor/)

You, the reader, must understand the stakes of what speaking up means if the nation is to be saved.  You must become the most loyal and ardent defender of the founding principles at the risk of your life and fortune. If you cannot risk it for that foundational biscuit, then your voice will just become one of many that will be ignored -like drowning oarsmen in the alternate universe’s Delaware, where prideful British troops drink mulled wine and piss on your body.   Nobody wants that.

Right now, your MAGA neighbors v will likely view you as a foreign enemy to be intimidated, detained, or destroyed.

Be sure that the next four years will be a time of turmoil, economic hardship, and possibly civil unrest.  Before you can follow instructions on navigating through it, you must first organize.  Get your lifeboats back together, tie your fortunes to each other, and move with a purpose in opposition to the storm threatening to scuttle your hopes, dreams, and families. 

Today is the day to let go of the mourning and make the American Experiment work again.

Have a good cry. Spin on your heel, get a coffee, and Lets Fucking Go.

I waited for 4 day and didn’t get any relief and even the pain was occasional which got me thinking. The next day it radiated to a little left which is center abdomen it stayed there for a day and then it radiated to the back side of my kidney area from where it started but this time just opposite side. 
And then the next day I felt a little discomfort in my bladder area and it felt a little hard to urinate and also had to go 12-13 times to pee.

I went to the GP next day and a few more symptoms were added by that time, I had mild testicular pain, burning sensation while urinating, feeling of incompletion of bladder and urgency. After having my ultrasound and abdomen x-ray done, he diagnosed me with mild BPH and constipation, urinalysis and culture were negative. Now, he’s referred me to a urologist and I’m waiting for my appointment. 
TBH I’m still not convinced that I got BPH, is it possible to verify BPH with an ultrasound? He said it’s very rare to have BPH at 23. I told my doc that I do masturbate 3-4 times a month and he said that’s the reason you got BPH. I don’t believe masturbating 3-4 times is considered excessive.
I’ve stopped drinking alcohol, coffee and am totally avoiding dairy products or any highly processed foods. I’ve added variety of fruits to my diet and pumpkin seeds, along with that I’m doing yoga 2 times a day. With these changes my symptoms have relieved, now I only urinate 5-6 times a day(16 hours). I pee every 2-2.5 hours, I can control it for more time if I want. The symptoms that I have now are
:-  discomfort in my bladder,  
:- feeling of urinating after 40 minutes of finishing urinating. 
:-hard to maintain an erection

What steps should I take further? 
Any suggestions would be highly appreciated, Thank you.

When I stopped to have a look, I noticed all the switches (window and wing mirror) were not lit up and wouldn’t operate anything. The other window switches on passenger doors worked fine. 
Initially I suspected a fuse. I have a friend who works at a BMW dealership who I messaged and asked for a fuse diagram. I explained what had happened and he got back to me after speaking with the techs. They said the wing mirrors are the problem and they would need a new loom!?(see photo, looks like a controller) at the tasty price of £200 each side +VAT. 
I arrived at work and parked up, later, after work I got in the car and the switches were working again, but by the time I got home the problem came back. Today I drove to work and same issue, then driving home they worked fine all the way home. 
So, has anyone had or seen this issue and worked out what it was? I cannot justify spending £480 on a bit of wiring.

1gl8td1,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1gl8td1/mom_guilt/,Mom guilt,"My 1 year olds father asked for every second weekend and 2 6 hour visits in the off week and I refused. 

Back story. We broke up right before I found out I was pregnant. I tried to make it work but he was totally unsupportive and inconsiderate. He has another child with another woman and they are high conflict coparents. He has 50/50 custody of this child. 

In short, I end up doing the whole pregnancy alone. He is a self employed millionaire that doesn’t claim half of his earnings. He lives in a million dollar home that he paid for with all cash. During my pregnancy I tried to work out a child support agreement as I am in school working towards my degree and didn’t want to apply for welfare. He refused to support me and things just continued to go downhill from there. He was sleeping with and dating other women while I was home dealing with being pregnant and going to school and never checked in once to see if I was OK or if I needed anything. 

Our son ended up being born five weeks premature and he spent no overnights in the hospital with me even when our son had to go in the incubator for 48 hours, he would come in the hospital with coffee and food not asking if I had wanted anything. He was very cold towards me. He refused to help me financially while I was in school and would not make a schedule for custody reasons he made my life very difficult. When our son was discharged from the hospital, he was not there and I had no idea how to put the car seat in and was driving home crying. I was so overwhelmed. He didn’t spend any nights helping me with our child and he wanted without asking how our son was doing. 

I ended up finding out he was moved on with another woman since our son was a newborn and this would account for his long absences. For example, he would go anywhere from a week to 3 weeks without asking to see our son. 

When he went away for work for 100 days, he didn’t reach out to see how our son was doing one time, even though I told him he could FaceTime a few times a week. 

So you can understand, when he asked for every second weekend, I am very hesitant to give it to him. 

However, I did go back and offer him one night a week AFTER a period of consistent access -  three 3 hour visits per week. I stated that if he could maintain this schedule for 30 days we could work towards one overnight and then after another period of consistent overnights with no parenting concerns, we would work towards giving him every second weekend. 

Since we have sent this email back - through lawyers - he has went MIA for 75 days. He is posting online of him and his new girlfriend and her kids out doing things and has not reached out to see how his one year-old son is doing - not one time. I even went so far to send him an email asking if he wanted to mediate this between us with no response. He has my cellphone blocked so I cannot reach him that way either. I have had my lawyer contact his lawyer numerous times for an update but to they can’t get ahold of him either. In addition, he has stopped paying child support and it is now gone to support enforcement who also cannot get ahold of him. 

To add, one of the last times he had our son for a few hours our son came back covered in pee as he had no diapers to change him in and another time, he returned him running a fever because he had no medication to give him. Our son is still being breast-fed and is very used to my care and I do not trust this man for long periods of time with our son, as he has not shown up from him since the day he was born on a consistent basis. I also had to apply for welfare and he is living the high life with his new partner and their children. He refuses to pay me even though I settled for a small amount to avoid a years long court battle. I am on welfare barely getting by and also trying to graduate university to better my son and my life long term. 

As a mother, I feel guilt as I know it is beneficial for my son to have a relationship with his father and his half brother, But I also feel like I need to protect him from an inconsistent person who has shown that he does not put his children first. With me our son has a stable, consistent and peaceful home. But I still feel fear that our son may resent me one day from somewhat protecting him from this man. I have not dated since becoming pregnant and decided to put my child and raising him first. 

How would you feel in the situation? Am I wrong or right in how I have acted? Does anyone have any advice? I am trying my best not to be bitter but it eats me up inside. I feel robbed of the family I thought I deserved and the father my son deserved. ",1,1730926370.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1gl8t66,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gl8t66/grind_time_breville_barista_pro/,Grind time [Breville Barista Pro],"Hi all,

Even though I have tried to research a lot, I'm still new to espresso so please be gentle. :-)

I just purchased and received a Breville Barista Pro. After researching and viewing some videos on guidance on starting points for dialing on, I was met with something rather unexpected when first starting to grind.

I'm starting with a rather light roast (Ethiopian Sidamo Guji from Fresh Roasted Coffee) so I knew grind times were going to be relatively longer but it almost seemed like the grinder wasn't even working at first.

I have the upper burr internal setting at 3 and ended up at around a grind setting on-screen of 8 such that my 18g dose ended up at a 36 mL espresso around a time of 30s. My grind times are in the realm of 50-55s to get 18g. Is this normal for this built-in Baratza grinder at this roast level, am I doing something wrong I'm unaware of, or is it possible there's something defective? Appreciate any guidance here.

A woman confronted me at a coffee shop, accusing me of touching her while we were waiting in line. I knew I hadn’t, as we were standing far apart, but she insisted that I had touched her shoulder. I denied it, but she kept pushing, so I eventually apologized just to end the conversation.

Despite that, she continued cursing at me. My husband got involved and started arguing with her, which only seemed to make her angrier. He even said something like, ‘Stop with the attitude—my wife is pregnant!’ At that, the woman cursed at us again and threatened to punch my stomach.

A bystander stepped in, pointing to their head and twirling their finger, as if to suggest the woman wasn’t in her right mind, and apologized on her behalf. She accompanied the woman outside, but even as they left, the woman kept glaring at me, cursing and threatening to punch my stomach.

I told my husband that next time, we should avoid engaging with people like her and just walk away, and that we shouldn’t mention my pregnancy.

Hey Reddit! 

We wanted to do our next Team Style Guide on the Après Pant. While not the pants we’d recommend for say, date night, these have proven to be incredibly versatile. While made to lounge, they certainly aren’t inside pants only (unless you’re Tyler). Fit details below. 

We’ve also asked our friends from past style posts to show us how they’d style these, so keep an eye out as you’ll see it from our point of view and your fellow Redditors as well. 

As always, we’d love to know your thoughts and how you style your own Après!

**Tyler:**

I tend to use my Après as true loungewear: on the couch in the evening or as my pajamas. Considering that I am chronically cold, I go big on wool, so the rest of my lounge ensemble tends to be merino layers for the shirt, sweatshirt, and socks. Whenever I am at home, I tend to reach for my shearling lined slippers and a wool blanket to stay warm.

**Phil (Michelle’s Proxy):** 

A good lounge means tucking in for a good pvp session. While I’m probably aging us both, it’s generally a thermal, then tee and then hoodie. Thermals are the annual Christmas gift from his parents along with the Marks and Spencer socks. Birkenstocks double as slippers and a way to run a quick errand. We just replaced his pair that were still going but looking a bit worse for wear in the 15+ years he’s had them. No clue what he’s writing in that notebook, but it’s never far away from a good cup of coffee or tea, headset on, and the sound of the mechanical keys clicking away.

**Chris** 

Now, some may say I’ve “given up” by wearing lounge wear out and about—and hell considering last time we did this I featured Crocs, these allegations are getting hard to beat. But it’s not that serious. I find when Après pants are worn with a flannel, not only am I cozy and warm, but it looks presentable. No shame in running a few errands around town, or even heading to a friend's place for a game night. But of course, they do feel at home, at home too.

**Jamie**

Here’s my take on The Après Pant: for starters, it’s a sharp-looking jogger silhouette. In my head, though, I also can’t shake the family tree picture of joggers being related to sweats, and sweats having some cousins that are basically pajamas. But you know what? When I do decide to wear them outside of the apartment, they almost always get a compliment, and that feels good. So I’m often looking to strike a balance of dressing them up, without sacrificing comfort (nothing fussy), and in otherwise simpler materials and neutral colors, to put the focus on the sashiko texture. I’ve had my pair for almost 3 years now, and they’ve continued to get better and better, truly.

I recently purchased an Aiden brewer from Amazon and was super excited to use it! Unfortunately, once I got it all set up in my kitchen, it immediately tripped my GCFI breaker when I tried to brew my first instant pot of coffee. It’s likely when the heater starts attempting to heat the water. My troubleshooting was as follows:

- I updated it to the latest firmware, it seemed to get a little further in the brew cycle.
- I tried multiple outlets and made sure it was the only device on the circuit, it still tripped the other breakers.
- I exchanged the Aiden for another one because at this point, I thought it was a faulty product. Unfortunately, the new Aiden was tripping the breaker still. At this point, I repeated the same troubleshooting steps above with no luck.
- In my research I found that a surge protector could help so I tried two different models and both of them still tripped the breaker. 
- I’m trying to work with Fellow support but so far they just have been asking simple questions and taking a full day to respond with more questions to my ticket and they have no support number to call.

Has anyone experienced similar issues and overcome them? Does anyone have any other advice on what I can try? I’m desperate to get my machine working and just want to enjoy a good cup of coffee. Thank you in advance! ",1,1730925865.0,FellowProducts,1,1.0,False
1gl8lkh,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1gl8lkh/was_told_i_was_having_panic_attacks_for_several/,"Was told I was having “panic attacks” for several years. Turns out, I have epilepsy, and my “panic attacks” are seizures. ","I’m so angry. I’m so angry at all the times I went to the ER for panic attacks that would start and stop and start and stop and start and stop where I felt like I was literally going to die, and the ER doctors just said “it’s a panic attack, she’s overreacting, give her ativan and she should calm down.”

I eventually stopped going to the ER, my psychiatrist doped me up to high heavens, I had a prescription of ativan for whenever I had panic attacks. 

Did you know ativan is also commonly used to treat seizures? And not just one type of seizure, but ALL types of seizures? 

I do have an anxiety disorder, but these panic attacks genuinely made me feel like I was going to die. 

These panic attacks came on suddenly, they’d happen out of nowhere, there would be no cause, I’d just be running around like a chicken with its head cut off. 

A month ago I had my first tonic clonic “grand mal” seizure. my arms started spasming, I felt exhausted, and then I got up and took a sip of my coffee and then it was lights out. My partner has never been so scared in his life.

Since then I’ve had over 38 seizures, usually twice a day (clusters), sometimes going motor, each lasting for (on average) five minutes. My heart rate goes to 130-143bpm before my seizures and then drops to 56bpm during them. my oxygen levels goes from a steady 98% to 92%, sometimes 88%. this shit can fucking kill me. I was neglected for who knows how long, all because I’m an over dramatic woman who’s crying wolf. 

Since then I’ve gotten an apple watch that helps detect the seizures in my sleep. I’m having seizures in my sleep. No wonder I’m fucking exhausted all the time. (Yes, I’m considering a sleep study.) 

My epileptologist believes that I’ve been having seizures for a really long time, and it just went unnoticed because no one thinks about focal seizures— they light up half of your brain, and they frequently have no motor symptoms, just pure panic and dissociation and feeling deja vu and jamais vu and feeling like you’re in a trance. And then they’re over, you’re exhausted, and are confused and can’t stop crying. Sometimes a focal seizure is just crying out of nowhere for a few minutes and then it’s over and your body is so sore. His suspicions seemed to be confirmed when I let him know one of my nephews has epilepsy and that I have autism. 

Currently waiting for meds to build in my system, got put on keppra for the meantime while they build in my system, and have a rescue nasal spray that sucks when I’m coming out of a seizure because it drains to the back of your throat and tastes like garbage. So grateful for it though because it stops them and has stopped grand mals from occurring right as they’re about to start. I’ve lost a lot of my independence (can’t go to the gym by myself, can’t bike anymore, can’t swim anymore without an experienced swimmer, can’t cook by myself anymore), but I’m alive. 

If your doctors keep brushing you off, push them. This shit is no fucking joke and isn’t something to mess around with. push for that sleep study. push for a visit with neurology. push for a visit with an epilepsy specialist and get that eeg. push for that heart test. push them. it’s your life on the line, not theirs.

Overall 2nd cruise but first time with Celebrity. Previous cruise is a 7-day alaskan itinerary with Discovery Princess. We usually don't take a 3 day itinerary, but due to a tight timelines, we had to. Also, we are neither fans nor haters of any line. I'll try to provide my best and honest review.

**Ship:**

One word - Gorgeous. For its age, she has been maintained quite well. Every nook and corner look very premium. Love the ambient lighting in the ship. Even public restrooms felt very luxurious. The layout is pretty good, we feel the foyer on decks 3,4,5 felt rather small. It doesn't necessarily has a nicer flow, but not really felt like an issue. Loved the areas of Hideaway, Library, iLounge on the passenger decks, but we couldn't use much (more on the Vibe section). Elevators were very nice, there is a tree hanging in the elevator bank and you can view the interior all the way up to deck 14. Nice size pools and solarium. Plenty of loungers all over. You ""may"" not get a pool side chair, but you will sure get something nearby. Solarium felt more premium space with padded loungers. Crew does remove unattended items, towels to prevent chair hogging. Celebrity also provides complimentary Sunscreen lotions on the pool deck, which is a nice touch. Lawn garden and Sunset bar were excellent spaces, but almost always busy. I personally didn't like the layout of the Lawn Garden and they do not have bean bags during our trip (we saw in one of the YT ship tours). So, you either have to sit on the grass or grab a towel to make a little picnic. Love the Sky observation deck, especially in the mornings when its almost empty. This ship didn't cover the forward part of the ship with a pay wall (yet), so we can access that area, which is very nice.

**Embarkation & Vibe:**

Embarkation is very smooth. The staff were exceptional at handling crowds, they were very polite and efficient. We had a the Premium Access (more on that later), but we didn't even need to use that. We reached the cruise port around 11:30ish and its not at all crowded. There were some waters kept at boarding (a nice touch). It is a very busy ship, appears like fully sold out. The Crowd, however, is a mixed bag of party-focused and relaxation-seeking. Guests were also very polite and courteous to others. The ship, however, tried to keep the vibe more towards the party. Almost every evening, there is loud music (DJ, singers, bands) on Deck3, because the space is open up all the way to Deck 14 at the elvator bank, the sound spreads all the way to the top. So, in the evening the Hide away and Library and other areas were not at all quiet. Which is a bummer for us, but can't complain (Not sure if the same goes for 7 day itineraries too). Having said that, we were still able to find quiet spots on the ship. Loved the evenings on Lawn garden and Promenade on Deck 5. Mornings were exceptional in the Sky observation lounge Or the walking path.

**Room:**

We booked a balcony room on Deck 7. Room is very nice and clean. I know Bed is a kinda personal preference, but I loved it. The space is a bit bigger too. Love the size of the balcony. Even the ship is old, the room still felt a bit premium. There were a few areas, you can see it a bit dated, but not much really. The yellow lights in the room, however, make you go back in time :D. They replaced the couch with a new one and ""one"" chair replaced in the balcony with a new one. Bathroom is of a good size and shower capsule is big for a cruise ship standards. I am very impressed with the water pressure of the shower. Also love the quality of the bath products (especially the moisturizer). Shout out to Agus, our room steward, who did an exceptional job of keeping our room clean. Celebrity does provide 2 times service (morning and nightly turn down). He also provided pillow chocolates, another nice touch.

**Dining:**

Food is very subjective. But we found that food quality is very good in both MDR and Buffet. Its surely better than Princess dining (about 25% better). Celebrity makes bread and croissants much better than princess. Princess's Lido pizza and Danish pastries were much better than celebrity. I also feel that there isn't much variety on celebrity in general.

**Main Dining Room** \- Although food quality is very good, the organization is not. It felt like the team don't have much clarity. I had one rude experience from the staff that got quickly resolved by the supervisor. Staff in general were very polite, courteous and efficient, but not warm. It feels like they don't mean what they say. It felt like scripted and coming directly from the corporate marketing team. The main problem I felt is that they were understaffed and everyone seemed overworking. You can literally see in their faces that they were not happy. So, they just say and do what they needed to do. Not even once, the MDR supervisors approached our table and asked if everything okay. Princess was way better at hospitality.

**Buffet** \- The food is above average to good quality in the buffet. It gets busy during the peak times (as every cruise), but we were able to find some seats in the shoulder hours of peak times. The space is organized very well and almost no queues to pick-up any item. Although it had ""enough"" variety, certainly less than princess. There aren't any staff asking us if we wanted a drink / coffee etc. but they were cleaning up the empty plates pretty quickly. Again, the issue of understaffing. On the debarkation day, someone came to our table with the coffee trolley and asked to give him a review and 10 rating. We never saw anyone on the other days.

**Room Service** \- Room service menu is very limited (hardly 4 items to choose), we haven't gotten room service during the day or the night. We, however, used their breakfast delivery. For regular guests, Continental morning breakfast in room is included. we felt its a pretty decent selection for the breakfast items. You'd need to fill-in the form and put on the door handle before 2AM and you'll get your breakfast delivered on the time you mentioned. They'll give you a courtesy call before someone show up. For Premium access guests, you can have Hot breakfast (eggs, hash browns) delivered too (Room service fee and gratuity is waived). For others, it will cost $9.95 + 20% gratuity per order.

We haven't dined in any speciality dining since its a very short cruise.

**Drinks:**

One word - Overpriced

Beers are not priced equal, like Heineken is $9, and Stella is $11. White wine is $12-15, Red wine is $17-19. Funniest part is, 4 glasses of ""Decoy"" cabernet costs $68.. and they were selling the bottle (4 glasses) for $70 (Nickel and Dime 101). And add a 20% gratuity on top of everything. And sign a receipt for every drink you take. Basic mixed drinks doesn't even feel if they have any alcohol in them. Now, the part that I hated the most is that you don't even know the price of liquors. There aren't any menus (only some bars have) for you to see how much does this cost. You have to ""ask"" someone to get the price of everything. This is super stressful (may be that's the idea). Even if you have a classic drink package, there were only a very limited selection of drinks you can get. The ""good"" drinks start at $17 and goes a lot above. In this entire thing, I am not even mentioning about speciality cocktails at World Class Bar. I still can justify the price tag there because they really were amazing. Rather than delighting the customer, they were squeezing the customer in this area.

Well, if you think that they were made with premium liquors and celebrity is a premium line. I don't find Titos vodka to be a premium vodka to justify that. Also, I might ask you to check either Disney, Virgin and Viking drink prices. They are also very premium lines with premium drinks which are priced very less than celebrity. You can compare beer prices, wine prices and mixed cocktails. I am not including Princess in this, they are the best in the industry for their drink packages, you can literally have a full bottle of McAllen Quest for free in their premium package. So, with my limited intelligence, I couldn't really justify the price from whatever angle I see. If you find the value in them, I salute to you.

**Coco-cay:**

Summary - Best experience, Exceptionally well maintained

What can I say, it is really awesome. The beaches were very clean and in excellent condition. There were signs everywhere, thousands of lounge chairs with umbrellas. They were nicely color coded for 2-seater, 4-seater. White sands, awesome beaches. We were in the south beach most of the time, it was so lively with music and games. Nice bars all around. I loved the snack shack a lot. What a little decent spread of items. Simple, subtle and very good quality food and a very fast service. There were multiple beverage stations near it, so no waiting/lines. We didn't even go to buffet, snack shack was sufficient for us. Royal Caribbean perfected this island. Love every part of it.

**Service:**

Overall, the vibe of the service seems stressed out. I can see they are severely understaffed. I rarely found any waiter at the pool or near the bar areas to ask and get you a drink. There is ""one"" waiter I found in the Solarium, who took more than 30 mins to deliver a beer after waiting 30 mins to order. There aren't anyone in the buffet or other areas even to ask. Dining room waiters were as I mentioned above, polite, courteous, efficient, but not warm. We haven't seen the supervisor coming to our table, not even once, and ask ""how's everything going"". I don't know how better to put it, may be I had a better expectation from Celebrity.

**Entertainment:**

Live music at different places. There was a night party on the pool deck, and Production shows were good. We are not really entertainment people, so we use to find a quiet place almost every time.

**Premium Access:**

I don't think anyone needs it. We didn't use much of the wifi (only 1 device, that too just for messages). Once we ordered hot breakfast and once a premium seating in theater. Embarkation and Debarkation is very smooth that you don't need any special thing.

**Nickel & Diming:**

Its a beautiful and premium ship and all the basic items such as food, coffee (not speciality), tea, ice-tea, water etc. are included (Like any other cruise line). Most nickel and dime I saw in the drinks. I have already touched upon them in the Drinks section. Personally, the most irritating thing is to sign a receipt. I mean, really? Also, the classic drink package doesn't give you much and the premium (or whatever) drink package is about $110 pppd. Even then, it only covers drinks upto $17. That means, if you take a red pinot wine, you still had to pay an extra $2. I also feel the reduction in the staff in MDR is kinda their push for speciality dining. Nonetheless, it failed to create a memorable experience. We have received a future cruise form BEFORE the sailing, which is very weird. Surprisingly, we haven't seen much of a sales pressure anywhere. We got approached for drinks package on the embarkation day, but thats it.

**Overall Summary:**

Its a real mixed-bag of feelings for us. Its a beautiful ship, looks premium, felt premium. Food is fantastic. Room is awesome with extraordinary room steward. Dining Service is mediocre with fabricated greetings/responses, mostly because they were very hard-working and severly understaffed. Drinks were outrageously expensive with that additional receipt sign. At this point, I am not really sure if some of the issues were because of a 3 day sailing and mostly not there on 7 day sailings. And the drink prices fluctuate? like they are this expensive for party cruises, and normalize for others? I really would love to hear from others on this sailing OR in general celebrity sailings.

As far as us concerned, well, celebrity didn't really stood out. I mean, at the similar price points, we have Virgin, Disney and Princess available. Sometimes, celebrity costs as much as upper premium lines like Oceania, Viking, Azamara. Where most of the things included. We are not there to exclude celebrity completely, but not our first choice for the next cruise.

If you come this far. Thank you and I hope I have provided some useful insights.",3,1730925681.0,Cruise,1,0.81,False

Their first conversation went off the rails immediately when Emily asked, “What are you going to take me to eat on our first date?” Jake responded with a message about his favorite all-you-can-eat Korean barbeque restaurant and warned her that government secrets plague the parking lot. 

Despite the tension, Emily decided to give it a go, and they met for coffee instead. At the shop in Silverlake, their differences only grew more glaring. Emily sipped her almond milk latte while Jake dug into a ham croissant. He lectured Emily on his theories about how ""they"" were controlling the weather and tried to get her to eat a bite of his pastry. 

The date quickly spiraled into a series of awkward silences and strained attempts to find common ground. Emily tried to steer the conversation toward yoga, but Jake couldn't grasp the concept of focusing on one's breath, insisting it was “too soft.” By the time they reached climate change…Jake called it a conspiracy and Emily knew it was time to go. The date ended with a polite goodbye, and the perverse matchmaking algorithm, somewhere in the digital abyss, laughed at its masterpiece of mismatched chaos.

**DIVISION 1**

*Scenarios:*

* ***EpiKnightz*** needed a win to secure the Division 1 title.
* ***Vijaygarv*** needed to have a better outcome to claim victory.
* ***leosondek*** or ***Acrobatic\_Employ\_798*** had an outside chance of taking the top spot, with Relegation looming for whoever loses.
* ***soximent*** and ***StuartA19*** had a tough battle ahead as they seek to avoid Relegation, and must win to survive.

A win for [u/EpiKnightz](https://www.reddit.com/user/EpiKnightz/) was all it took to ensure they claimed the Division 1 title, while a loss for [u/StuartA19](https://www.reddit.com/user/StuartA19/) means they finish bottom and are relegated down to Division 2.

[u/Vijaygarv](https://www.reddit.com/user/Vijaygarv/) scraped through with the minimum required to keep the pressure on, and secures 2nd place while [u/soximent](https://www.reddit.com/user/soximent/) also joins the ranks in Division 2.

[u/Acrobatic\_Employ\_798](https://www.reddit.com/user/Acrobatic_Employ_798/) defeated [u/leosondek](https://www.reddit.com/user/leosondek/) (currently Top 50k) as both avoid relegation thanks to results elsewhere.

**DIVISION 2**

*Scenarios:*

* ***theseane*** only needed a draw to finish top.
* ***\_13characters*** has an outside chance to claim the title, but needs favourable results elsewhere.
* ***FanFareApp*** and ***Fooicus*** both need a win in the hunt for, at least, promotion.
* *It's a must-win for* ***Justchillin1123*** to avoid some H2H drama relegating them.
* ***JS794*** is also desperate for a win which should keep them up.

u/theseane went above and beyond to earn the title of Division 2 Champion, and joins the elite in Division 1 as a result. u/FanFareApp joins them after also winning, and already leading u/Fooicus in a H2H victory in GW8.

Despite the loss, u/\_13characters has avoided relegation thanks to a H2H win, also in GW8, against u/Justchillin1123, who, in turn, is relegated to Division 3.

Joining them, is u/JS794, who also lost in the final battle of Stage 1.

**DIVISION 3**

*Scenarios:*

* ***larsriedel*** needs to win to secure the top spot.
* ***Loosee123*** is hoping for a glimmer of hope that a win can steal the title.
* ***Keumars*** has a chance to claim the spoils of war, but a win is essential, as well as other results.
* ***Name19389*** has a similar chance to push for glory.
* ***StraightDifference75*** needs to win, and stands a strong chance of survival should they do so.
* ***Dioulio*** has an interesting battle that could mean relegation for the loser.

For the first time we've seen it this season, the Division leader after Match 4 has lost, and allowed a contender to nip in and take the glory. [u/larsriedel](https://www.reddit.com/user/larsriedel/) lost heavily to [u/Name19389](https://www.reddit.com/user/Name19389/), meaning the title, and Promotion is out of the question. The latter done all they could to stake their claim, but will have to settle for 2nd place and Promotion.

[u/Loosee123](https://www.reddit.com/user/Loosee123/) won with one of the lower scores in the Division, but it was enough for them to go top and take the top spot.

In the epic battle at the bottom, [u/Keumars](https://www.reddit.com/user/Keumars/) lost to [u/Dioulio](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dioulio/) and is relegated to Division 4. [u/StraightDifference75](https://www.reddit.com/user/StraightDifference75/) also lost, meaning they finish bottom while [u/Dioulio](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dioulio/) survives.

**DIVISION 4**

*Scenarios:*

* ***Andrew643521*** and ***JonnyTic*** will face off for the title. Further H2H will decide if the loser will still earn promotion.
* ***Zakedawn*** and ***lolAdvantage*** patiently await the loser to see if H2H will land in their favour.
* At least one of ***Early\_Damage*** and ***VillagerCorTree3*** will be relegated, with the final place coming down to H2H.

[u/Andrew643521](https://www.reddit.com/user/Andrew643521/) defeats [u/JonnyTic](https://www.reddit.com/user/JonnyTic/), and wins the Division. Given other results and previous H2H matchups, both are also promoted to Division 3.

[u/Zakedawn](https://www.reddit.com/user/Zakedawn/) takes the win but it's not enough to earn that second promotion place, having lost a the deciding H2H battle in GW9. [u/lolAdvantage](https://www.reddit.com/user/lolAdvantage/) prevails in a GW8 H2H challenge against [u/Early\_Damage](https://www.reddit.com/user/Early_Damage/) to send the latter down to Division 5.

[u/VillagerCorTree3](https://www.reddit.com/user/VillagerCorTree3/) is also relegated, having lost their final match.

**DIVISION 5**

*Scenarios:*

* ***rdtalks*** only needs to avoid defeat to earn promotion and the title, otherwise ***ZAK5UMA*** will take the spoils.
* ***Separate\_Ad2919*** just needs to avoid defeat in order to survive.
* ***RealOronian*** is a string favourite to stay alive.
* ***skotos2phos*** is also in good stead to survive.
* ***1ntrepid\_*** must win to have any hope of continuing in the competition.

With [u/rdtalks](https://www.reddit.com/user/rdtalks/) taking on [u/ZAK5UMA](https://www.reddit.com/user/ZAK5UMA/) for the title, it was the latter who turned up with a destructive scoreline. This result opens up the floor to what is eventually a 4-way H2H mini-league.

[u/RealOronian](https://www.reddit.com/user/RealOronian/) and [u/Separate\_Ad2919](https://www.reddit.com/user/Separate_Ad2919/) also both win, meaning we have four managers on 3x wins. [u/ZAK5UMA](https://www.reddit.com/user/ZAK5UMA/) prevails, having beaten all other contenders, while the other three beat each other and leave it to Overall Rank to decide the rest.

Fortunately for our former table-topper, [u/rdtalks](https://www.reddit.com/user/rdtalks/), that's enough to seal the deal and earn them promotion up to Division 4.

The other contenders survive Elimination, while [u/skotos2phos](https://www.reddit.com/user/skotos2phos/) and [u/1ntrepid\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/1ntrepid_/) finish as the bottom two and are ultimately Eliminated from FPL Swiss. The Consolation Cup awaits later in the season, so time to rebuild and focus efforts elsewhere - because this league is obviously the priority for many, right?

**DIVISION 6**

*Scenarios:*

* ***utham12*** only needs a draw to stay top and survive.
* ***DukeManBearPig*** leads the H2H group, and a win should secure survival.
* ***ThePersiflager*** needs a win to take it to a smaller H2H requirement.
* ***Topacali*** and ***CrazyFrogSY3*** also each need wins, and other results to go their way.
* ***thebrazenkaizen*** is eliminated and H2H results mean they cannot catchup to the top two.

[u/utham12](https://www.reddit.com/user/utham12/) took the win, and tops the Division.

[u/ThePersiflager](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThePersiflager/) wins while [u/DukeManBearPig](https://www.reddit.com/user/DukeManBearPig/) loses. Given this covers other necessary results, the former survives, while everyone else is Eliminated.

A win for [u/CrazyFrogSY3](https://www.reddit.com/user/CrazyFrogSY3/) wasn't quite enough as they previously lost the deciding H2H back in GW6.

A loss for [u/Topacali](https://www.reddit.com/user/Topacali/) seals their fate and joins the others in Elimination, while [u/thebrazenkaizen](https://www.reddit.com/user/thebrazenkaizen/) already knew their fate at the end of GW9.

**DIVISION 1**

*Scenarios:*

* A win for ***Long-Seaworthiness50*** will secure the Division 1 title.
* ***QuantumParadox\_27*** needs a better result than ***Long-Seaworthiness50*** should they falter.
* ***CardozoSmash*** probably cannot win the title due to H2H, so a win would go a long way to avoiding relegation.
* ***NoobyDoobyDoooo*** is in the same boat as ***CardozoSmash*** and a win is almost essential.
* ***DiamondPalkia*** must win to avoid the drop.
* ***Distinct\_Pick6261*** must also win, and will likely need other results to go their way or they will be relegated.

[u/Long-Seaworthiness50](https://www.reddit.com/user/Long-Seaworthiness50/) earned a narrow win and finishes top of the Division, claiming the title.

Despite their best efforts, [u/QuantumParadox\_27](https://www.reddit.com/user/QuantumParadox_27/) finishes 2nd thanks to another narrow H2H result at the beginning of Stage 1.

[u/DiamondPalkia](https://www.reddit.com/user/DiamondPalkia/) was the only other victor meaning we are left with a 3-way H2H tie-breaker with [u/NoobyDoobyDoooo](https://www.reddit.com/user/NoobyDoobyDoooo/) and [u/CardozoSmash](https://www.reddit.com/user/CardozoSmash/), where [u/NoobyDoobyDoooo](https://www.reddit.com/user/NoobyDoobyDoooo/)'s Overall Rank is their downfall. Given that fixture only had the two managers 3pts apart, it couldn't have been much closer.

Unfortunately for [u/Distinct\_Pick6261](https://www.reddit.com/user/Distinct_Pick6261/), a loss means they are rooted to the bottom of the table and also relegated to Division 2.

**DIVISION 2**

*Scenarios:*

* ***sparrowhawk73*** is already guaranteed to win Division 2, seeking a 100% record to the end.
* ***FPLExpert*** is the favourite and needs to avoid defeat to get promoted.
* ***pa\_ra\_dox*** and ***NielsRandomShirt*** with an outside chance, but both also at risk of relegation.
* ***DrainMember1312*** needs a win to swap places and survive.
* ***rocknil*** was guaranteed to be relegated.

[u/sparrowhawk73](https://www.reddit.com/user/sparrowhawk73/) finishes Stage 1 with a 100% win record, and joins the elite in Division 1 with a chip on their shoulder.

[u/FPLExpert](https://www.reddit.com/user/FPLExpert/) losing to [u/NielsRandomShirt](https://www.reddit.com/user/NielsRandomShirt/) means the latter jumps into the remaining Promotion spot as the only other manager on 3x wins.

At the bottom,[/pa\_ra\_dox](https://www.reddit.com/user/pa_ra_dox/) also lost to [u/DrainMember1312](https://www.reddit.com/user/DrainMember1312/), but their fate is worse, as it means they lose out on the H2H tie-breaker and finish in the relegation zone.

Down at the bottom, [u/rocknil](https://www.reddit.com/user/rocknil/) could not improve despite their sealed fate, as they whimper down to Division 3. Recoup and come bouncing back - still plenty of time time to sort it out.

**DIVISION 3**

*Scenarios:*

* ***Vegetable\_Design8330*** is the favourite for the title, but a loss could open up a 5-way H2H.
* ***wo27*** is also chasing promotion, but should ***coolBballer*** win, they lead in H2H.
* ***henkkaasd\_*** can join the ranks of H2H if they can beat bottom-of-the-table ***Existing\_Succotash95***.
* ***DoubleDeez21*** is hoping to join that H2H battle as the only hope for promotion.

A win for [u/Vegetable\_Design8330](https://www.reddit.com/user/Vegetable_Design8330/) has secured their place at the top and up to Division 2 they go. Despite losing though, [u/DoubleDeez21](https://www.reddit.com/user/DoubleDeez21/) has managed to avoid relegation gven other results and H2H wins.

[u/wo27](https://www.reddit.com/user/wo27/) losing to [u/coolBballer](https://www.reddit.com/user/coolBballer/) means the latter takes the remaining promotion spot.

It was a case of *""I'm taking you down with me""* for [u/Existing\_Succotash95](https://www.reddit.com/user/Existing_Succotash95/) as they restored some pride in beating [u/henkkaasd\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/henkkaasd_/) \- both will meet again in Division 4.

**DIVISION 4**

*Scenarios:*

* ***FinnMundy7*** avoiding defeat would keep them top.
* ***LiteratureCurious42*** would also be promoted with a win.
* ***sikingthegreat1*** and ***bb53040*** each need to win to push for promotion and equally avoid relegation.
* ***FaustRPeggi*** winning would take them out of the relegation zone.
* ***Significant\_Bad4014*** must win and hope for good results elsewhere.

It all ended in a draw between [u/FinnMundy7](https://www.reddit.com/user/FinnMundy7/) and [u/Significant\_Bad4014](https://www.reddit.com/user/Significant_Bad4014/) meaning the former tops the Division while the latter is consigned to the foot of the table, and relegation down to Division 5.

[u/LiteratureCurious42](https://www.reddit.com/user/LiteratureCurious42/) lost to [u/bb53040](https://www.reddit.com/user/bb53040/), killing their hopes of promotion, but it does mean [u/bb53040](https://www.reddit.com/user/bb53040/) takes that next spot themselves, joining the ranks of Division 3.

[u/sikingthegreat1](https://www.reddit.com/user/sikingthegreat1/) lost to [u/FaustRPeggi](https://www.reddit.com/user/FaustRPeggi/), and given other results and H2H losses, they are relegated down to Division 5 also.

https://preview.redd.it/zx7oc9mwfazd1.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=069420f92ca9757de69bf6f9a5a3958ce82ab337

**DIVISION 5**

*Scenarios:*

* ***IVIorgz*** just needs to equal ***AugmentedMrHippo***'s result to claim the title and earn promotion.
* ***newfountain22*** or ***WEAluka*** winning won't do much for promotion hope, but avoiding Elimination is key.
* ***MemeWorksPictures*** was probably always going to be Eliminated given any potential H2H tie-breakers.
* Likewise, ***PhzyLicka*** is also probably resigned to Elimination but a win, as well as a loss for ***WEAluka*** could save them for now.

[u/IVIorgz](https://www.reddit.com/user/IVIorgz/) scored the lowest in the Division in the final GW, and ultimately lost to [u/MemeWorksPictures](https://www.reddit.com/user/MemeWorksPictures/), leaving [u/AugmentedMrHippo](https://www.reddit.com/user/AugmentedMrHippo/) able to step up and claim the title with a win over bottom-of-the-table [u/PhzyLicka](https://www.reddit.com/user/PhzyLicka/), whom they dispatched of appropriately.

The final Promotion and elimination spots then relied on the outcome of [u/newfountain22](https://www.reddit.com/user/newfountain22/) versus [u/WEAluka](https://www.reddit.com/user/WEAluka/) \- both of which scoring 60+ points in an otherwise low-scoring week. A quick look at the teams shows that it all came down to the final match of the GW, and the Flekken debacle that so many of us fell foul to. However, both survive as [u/WEAluka](https://www.reddit.com/user/WEAluka/) holds a H2H advantage over [u/MemeWorksPictures](https://www.reddit.com/user/MemeWorksPictures/).

https://preview.redd.it/xgz1syl4iazd1.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=69f730bcc918e0f896ce729a890d3179705a392c

**DIVISION 6**

*Scenarios:*

* ***BiLLer\_17*** most likely will claim a promotion place.
* ***adstomko*** faces ***soulblast300*** for a remaining place.
* ***immchuckbass*** must win to have any chance of survival.
* ***ShitActor*** and ***IzaYoke*** are both eliminated.

Woops! We've hit this point pretty early this season, where I screw up a little and give false hope.

Despite accurately mentioning that it was a must-win fixture for [u/immchuckbass](https://www.reddit.com/user/immchuckbass/), I neglected to mention how that would impact [u/BiLLer\_17](https://www.reddit.com/user/BiLLer_17/). As it turns out, pretty badly, and not the ""likely survival"" I'd anticipated. My bad!

Either way, a win for [u/soulblast300](https://www.reddit.com/user/soulblast300/) over [u/adstomko](https://www.reddit.com/user/adstomko/), and subsequent H2H results previously, means BOTH finish in the top two and survive, sealing everyone else's fate.

As I said... Woops!

At least I got something correct - both u/ShitActor and u/IzaYoke were definitely Eliminated.

**DIVISION 1**

*Scenarios:*

* ***pauld95*** is guaranteed to be the Division 1 winner.
* ***ShadowGallConcierge*** is up against ***Just7Callum*** and ***thepalegreenpants*** to ensure they stay in Division 1.
* ***Mundanewisdom99*** plays ***Gilez\_89*** in the final GW, meaning whoever wins would be in a H2H battle with those above.

[u/pauld95](https://www.reddit.com/user/pauld95/) claims the Division 1 title, largely unrivalled, finishing with 5x wins from 5.

[u/ShadowGallConcierge](https://www.reddit.com/user/ShadowGallConcierge/) losing to [u/Just7Callum](https://www.reddit.com/user/Just7Callum/) puts them in a 3-way H2H with [u/thepalegreenpants](https://www.reddit.com/user/thepalegreenpants/) and the winner in the relegation zone.

That winner is [u/Gilez\_89](https://www.reddit.com/user/Gilez_89/), meaning [u/Mundanewisdom99](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mundanewisdom99/) is relegated. Unfortunately, with H2H not breaking the deadlock between the 3x managers, Overall Rank is the decider, and  [u/Gilez\_89](https://www.reddit.com/user/Gilez_89/) also drops down to Division 2, with only 500k in the Top 3M doing the damage. They even scored the same as [u/thepalegreenpants](https://www.reddit.com/user/thepalegreenpants/) in GW10, so anything more could well have been enough to survive.

https://preview.redd.it/lkqie0e72bzd1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ff6ced0bcb8accde32818bb1a83efc33fa67545

**DIVISION 2**

*Scenarios:*

* ***0ng0Gabl0g1an*** leads ***eglantinel*** in H2H at the top, with a win for either staking a claim for the title.
* ***Gloomy-Strawberry808*** is hoping for a double slip-up above them, so the can nip in and maybe take the honours, although unlikely with current H2H and Overall Rank.
* ***WaningCynicism***, ***the\_Vegetabull*** and ***GamamJ44*** are all seeking to avoid relegation as the only goal.

Well, well, well! As things have turned out, the top two ([u/0ng0Gabl0g1an](https://www.reddit.com/user/0ng0Gabl0g1an/) leads [u/eglantinel](https://www.reddit.com/user/eglantinel/)) both lost, leaving an ideal scenario for [u/Gloomy-Strawberry808](https://www.reddit.com/user/Gloomy-Strawberry808/) but would you believe it, they failed to take advantage, and it's cost them dearly.

[u/0ng0Gabl0g1an](https://www.reddit.com/user/0ng0Gabl0g1an/) leads [u/eglantinel](https://www.reddit.com/user/eglantinel/) stay separated by H2H at the top, while [u/Gloomy-Strawberry808](https://www.reddit.com/user/Gloomy-Strawberry808/) drops all the way to the bottom of the table after losing to [u/GamamJ44](https://www.reddit.com/user/GamamJ44/). H2H decides the ordering, but both are relegated to Division 3.

This is a result of [u/the\_Vegetabull](https://www.reddit.com/user/the_Vegetabull/) and [u/WaningCynicism](https://www.reddit.com/user/WaningCynicism/) both winning, and having previously drawn in their match in GW8, they are safe.

https://preview.redd.it/42vtbm416bzd1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=b80c19ecd7577f33b0cb2dc762ed5c2c1e564851

**DIVISION 3**

*Scenarios:*

* ***bubreadsreddit*** leads ***docvampirina***, a draw for each secures promotion.
* ***This\_is\_so\_not\_right*** and ***DasHotShot*** are hoping both leaders lose, and open the door for either.
* ***SneakyTina*** and ***TheJet-BlackWings*** each must win to have any hope of staying up.

[u/bubreadsreddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/bubreadsreddit/) fails in their efforts as [u/docvampirina](https://www.reddit.com/user/docvampirina/) wins, and therefore takes the top spot and the title.

[u/This\_is\_so\_not\_right](https://www.reddit.com/user/This_is_so_not_right/) loses to the eventual champion, but [u/DasHotShot](https://www.reddit.com/user/DasHotShot/) grasps the opportunity to claim the next Promotion place and moves up to Division 2.

[u/SneakyTina](https://www.reddit.com/user/SneakyTina/) loses, so finishes bottom and is relegated, while [u/TheJet-BlackWings](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheJet-BlackWings/) wins and has the advantage over [u/This\_is\_so\_not\_right](https://www.reddit.com/user/This_is_so_not_right/) who goes down instead.

https://preview.redd.it/8udp1xqfpbzd1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=615450d80553d937c724f1149686cecd0290b2ed

**DIVISION 4**

*Scenarios:*

* ***fusrohdab*** needs to avoid a slip-up and they will stay top, but H2H is in their favour for the most part.
* ***\_LilDuck*** needs a better result than ***macioman\_00***, who has the H2H advantage.
* ***appealtoreason00*** and ***Midnightinaperfect*** must win if they have any chance of promotion, but relegation is more likely.
* ***mrg1607*** has a must-win ahead of them to escape relegation.

[u/fusrohdab](https://www.reddit.com/user/fusrohdab/) scored low, but not as low as their opponent, so is promoted as Division winner. That also means [u/mrg1607](https://www.reddit.com/user/mrg1607/) is relegated at the foot of the table\*.

[u/macioman\_00](https://www.reddit.com/user/macioman_00/) gets the essential win to earn promotion also while [u/appealtoreason00](https://www.reddit.com/user/appealtoreason00/) sits just above the relegation zone.

[u/\_LilDuck](https://www.reddit.com/user/_LilDuck/) misses out on promotion at the hands of the H2H tie-breaker, but still time to climb their way out of trouble in Stage 2.

[u/Midnightinaperfect](https://www.reddit.com/user/Midnightinaperfect/) is not so lucky, and with defeat, they are relegated down to Division 5.

*\*It's missing from the table, but* [*u/mrg1607*](https://www.reddit.com/user/mrg1607/) *still finishes bottom on the H2H tie-breaker, not that it makes much of a difference.*

https://preview.redd.it/nwox8z5crbzd1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2ce6732fa0f71bc4c8978ae6ceeed8a21dc2a3e

**DIVISION 5**

*Scenarios:*

* ***No-Art1873*** and ***m-bizant*** are aiming to secure the top two spots with wins.
* ***LUCANUMBER10*** and ***knoxvox*** are eagerly awaiting an opportunity, should they be able to take it.
* ***dedosii*** are ***YaT3N01*** each chasing a win to avoid Elimination

[u/No-Art1873](https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Art1873/) loses to last season's Champion [u/knoxvox](https://www.reddit.com/user/knoxvox/), and ultimately gives up their promotion place to the victor.

That gave [u/m-bizant](https://www.reddit.com/user/m-bizant/) the opportunity to claim the top spot with a win over [u/YaT3N01](https://www.reddit.com/user/YaT3N01/) to claim the Division 5 title and move up the ranks, while the loser ends up finishing bottom of the table and is eliminated.

[u/LUCANUMBER10](https://www.reddit.com/user/LUCANUMBER10/) versus [u/dedosii](https://www.reddit.com/user/dedosii/) remains then as the decider for the final Elimination spot, and it was a well fought battle to the end too, but [u/dedosii](https://www.reddit.com/user/dedosii/) survives to fight another day.

https://preview.redd.it/rbb173lqtbzd1.png?width=1892&format=png&auto=webp&s=d719a5bdbbcccc728debfcf3c3240cbb79e0caec

**DIVISION 6**

*Scenarios:*

* ***BurnThemAll69*** only needs a draw to survive and stay top.
* ***FPL\_06***, ***sockar101***, ***hansibit***, and ***fsagoalkeeper13*** are all chasing what will most likely be the one remaining Survival position.
* ***Darkshit2*** has a very small chance of survival at best, heavily dependent on other results.

[u/BurnThemAll69](https://www.reddit.com/user/BurnThemAll69/) claims a small victory to finish top of Division 6 and survives with flying colours to fight another day.

[u/FPL\_06](https://www.reddit.com/user/FPL_06/) secured an even smaller win against a fellow contender, and ultimately takes the final survival place at the very bottom of the FPL Swiss League system. This was largely helped by each of the other contenders all losing.

[u/fsagoalkeeper13](https://www.reddit.com/user/fsagoalkeeper13/), [u/sockar101](https://www.reddit.com/user/sockar101/), [u/hansibit](https://www.reddit.com/user/hansibit/) and [u/Darkshit2](https://www.reddit.com/user/Darkshit2/) all ended up on equal WDL records, and went into an, albeit irrelevant, 4-way H2H tie-breaker. The results of this have been added for completeness only.

https://preview.redd.it/uwp5u0g5vbzd1.png?width=1892&format=png&auto=webp&s=17a1c7c1f677644a6b1ea3fe217ac6965a046fab

That just about rounds up everything in Stage 1, and Stage 2 is ready and waiting for those who are eager to begin in GW11 (and everyone else, whether you are ready or not).

As usual, all links can be found below to each Stage and Tier, as well as previous posts.

If I have missed anything, or you've noticed something not quite right with the above, please do let me know as soon as I can as mistakes may not be able to be rectified in an ideal manner, if at all, once the GW starts.

Best of luck to everyone.

We’re in the process of selling our house and I see her from time to time as she comes back to grab stuff. 

I can’t believe she’s the same person. 

I can’t believe the woman I snuggled before bed at night, who I brought coffee to every morning, who I laughed, cried and reminisced with, who I had worked into every single aspect of my life and my being… is now there but not there. 

It’s still her.. but not her.

I see her when she comes back and her hair is different but ehe clothes are the same, her voice is the same, her eyes are the same.

She responds to the same name and calls me the same name but it’s not her.. Everything and nothing all at once. 

She was my darling, my beloved, my ‘rest of my life’… and now she’s nothing.

In the blink of an eye she’s gone from my fiancee, to just somebody that I used to call my fiancee.

I cannot begin to process how odd it is that all the neither, laughter, tears, kisses, random acts of kindness, all of those things … are just gone.

I’m only 31 but the process of rebuilding with another person seems SO MUCH WORK. To rebuild everything from the ground up and form something with somebody new seems like an impossible task.

I just bought the Breville Barista Touch, I set it up and got stuck at the point of grinding the coffee beans as it has an error on the screen saying “Hopper Unlocked” and “Twist to Lock”. The thing is the hopper is locked. I even cleaned out the beans and started again and I’m still getting this error. Any idea what I have to do to fix this?

They stopped to get some coffee and use the bathroom at a gas station and when they returned the truck wouldn't recognize their keys.  The dealership says the parts, which I can overnight directly from Ford, are going to take 5 months to get there and now our nearly new $120k truck is stuck at some shithole dealership.  We recently went through a total loss due to an electrical fire on our 2020 F450 work truck (only 40k miles on it) and now we are having to deal with this BS.   Ford wouldn't help get their truck or RV towed back to CA and now we're stuck paying on a truck that we can't use and having to pay $10k to get the fifth wheel towed to CA.  

  
My 2022 F350 Superduty with less than 20k miles has eaten through 3 front tires (even after an alignment at the dealership) among other electrical issues.  Ever since the end of Covid the quality of Ford's vehicles has gone downhill.  Buyers beware, electrical fires seem to be a norm on Super duties and Ford will do absolutely nothing to help you if/when this happens to you.",1,1730925076.0,Ford,2,0.67,False

There was no service and he was taken off to be cremated and that was that. We decided that we'd have a ""gathering"" with some family and friends a few days after he was cremated, mainly so my mum could see everyone without them all individually stopping by her house. 

My dad's sister who he kept in touch with via phone / text, she lives about 45 mins away on a plane. My dad was sick for about a year before he passed and she saw him once for 20 mins while she was in the country for another reason, and before that she hadnt seen him for about 2 years. We always thought it was odd she didn't visit again when he got really sick as she is retired with bucket loads of money but didn't hold it against her. She also helped us when dad was sick in that she used to be a nurse so if we needed advice she would always try to help. I kept her updated on how dad was however she never texted or called to ask it was always down to me, and the month before he passed I was so busy at the hospital I didn't update her much and she never texted to check in. (Though my uncle who also visited dad may have been updating her I don't know)

In the days after my dad passed both my mum and I reached out to check in with my aunt but couldn't get through and got no response to texts, she eventually voice noted my mum back to say she was far too upset abour my dad to talk on the phone. So we left it that my uncle (who happened to be over visiting her that week) would mention to her about the gathering, with us having no expectation for her to come over since it was only an hour and a cup of coffee 

We didn't hear from her in the weeks following the gathering despite me texting her to check she was OK and calling, I even told her I was pregnant in one of my texts and got no response. Eventually she responded to my mum to say how much worse we had made her grief by not inviting her to my dad's funeral. We went back to explain he didn't have a funeral as there was no service, and that we only had a cup of coffee / chat for an hour, and also that we had tried to get in contact but she was too upset to talk. Now I can't get through to her and haven't spoke to her in over a month.

AITAH for having not made more of an effort to invite her to the gathering?

Turns out she is 28 and she told me that unfortunately I'm too young to date her. Which I get I doubt a woman almost in her thirties wants to be with a 21 year old guy but it just sucks we connected on everything and she talked so deeply and it did make me fall head over heels for her, our interests and how we saw things were so alike.

I take don't medications but I take vitamin C and D. I rarely ever drink alcohol, no coffee, no energy drinks, no cigarettes or any nicotine. I mostly eat healthy (Little salt, seasoning) with the occasional KFC here and there (Not more than once per month). No chronic illnesses. No one in my family has high blood pressure (quite the opposite).  
Ive been playing sport through my whole life, 9 years of swimming, 4 years of soccer, 10 years of basketball (I did some of them simultaneously).

I even got off of my sports drink to rule out the possibility of that raising my blood pressure.  
The ingredient list / label on the back:

    Dextrose 39%, sucrose 20%, isomaltulose* (Palatinose™) 18%, sodium citrate 8.5%, flavors, citric acid, black tea (Camellia sinensis) leaf extract 2%, calcium salts of citric acid 1.9%, magnesium bisglycinate 1.8%, L-ascorbic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride. *Isomaltulose is a source of glucose and fructose.

This has been going on for the last 5 months, after my GP discovered I had elevated normal blood pressure (124 and or above/80 and or below) they referred me to a cardiologist.  
I had taken an ABPM measurement which resulted in a average blood pressure of 139/79 (Interesting because I have never had a blood pressure that high and the bp meter we have at home is accurate to papers published by the manufacturer).  
My cardiologist has sent me to a dozen of extra test to rule out anything other than genetics.  
Since the next appointment is going to be at the end of this month, I though about sharing it on reddit to see if there are any hints about what might be causing my issue.

I am from Hungary (Europe), so there might be a language barrier but I have checked most of them and the expressions in English are very similar if not the same. (I have translated most of them, but just a heads up if you see some special characters :) ) Feel free to reach out to me if there is something you don't understand.

Thanks for any help / advice you can give, I am really curious about this test.

I almost forgot to mention that I did not do any kind of activity for 4 days before the blood was taken, which would've otherwise explained my high\* CK levels.

EDIT: For some reason not all of my translations were in the post (I don't know what happened to them), but I corrected most of them, sorry for the inconvenience.

I woke to my brother’s face, his eyes half-lidded.

“Gehhht uuuup.”

Every year since we were twelve, Mom drugged us before the ritual to stop us escaping. 

Last year, Jasper puked everywhere, barely able to make the long walk up to the hot spring– and it was a lot harder with his hands tied behind his back. 

This year, we had a plan. 

Jasper was already dressed, backpack slung over his shoulder. 

His crown of entangled bone sat crooked on his curls, ash streaked across his cheeks. 

I ripped it off his head, then tore off mine. Mom must have crowned us while we were asleep. 

The crown had always felt like an ending. 

Until I was twelve, I thought my crown was beautiful, my sacrifice worth billions of lives. 

Then I watched the eighteen year olds mercilessly sacrificed. 

Supposed to be cheering with my parents, hands bound in silk ribbons, I dropped to my knees and puked.

The image of them never leaves my mind. Flesh dripping from bone. 

Skeletal screams. 

Jasper handed me my backpack, and we pulled Maddie from her bed. 

She was less likely to be chosen—girls were meant to bear children for the ritual—but she, too, wore her crown, ash on her cheeks. Jasper had a car waiting. But before we got to it, Mrs. Benson grabbed me from behind, bony arms around my waist. Jasper was violently pulled from the driver’s seat, Maddie forced to her knees. 

*“Devil children,”* Mrs. Benson hissed, dragging us up the mountain to join the line of teenagers stumbling toward the hot spring. *“Children of fire,”* the adults chanted, my mother forcing my crown onto my head. 

Beads of red streaked down my face, the jagged edge slicing into my flesh. 

*“Children of ash,”* They shoved me into line.

All of us were ignited flame, already polluted. Ash wearing the skins of human children. Awaiting her eruption.

I hit the ground, breath tangled, inches from the hot spring. 

I’d seen kids boiled alive, skin melting, their screams rattling in my skull. 

I didn’t cry out when my brother was lifted by the scruff of his hair and dumped into the water, disappearing in a hiss of steam. Maddie screamed my name, dragged back by strange men. 

I was supposed to be next. 

I would be the 50th sacrifice, saving billions from Yellowstone. 

Somehow, I crawled back, choking on the stink of boiling flesh, clawing my way down the mountain. 

I ran away from my fate, abandoning my brother and sister who were reduced to steam clinging to my glasses. *Sam Gallows, the 50th sacrifice, had escaped.*

The next morning was quiet. The lights in my hotel were off. 

No room service. 

I sat up, made coffee, and burned it. 

I burned the bed, then my crown. 

I was free.

Standing in front of the window, a thick layer of grey already covered the ground below. Childish excitement filled me, and I found myself smiling. 

It was *snowing.*",97,1730924569.0,shortscarystories,3,0.98,False

I’m your friendly neighborhood 23-year-old with a well-curated collection of dad jokes, a dad bod that’s perfect for cozy cuddles, and a personality that’s about 75% sarcasm, 25% “did he really just say that?” (Yes, yes I did).

Here’s the deal: I’m looking for someone who’s as down-to-earth as they are up for an adventure. Maybe we hit up a dive bar and see who can come up with the worst karaoke performance of all time, or we grab some coffee and I proceed to judge your taste in TV shows while pretending I don’t secretly love every trashy reality show ever made. (Pro tip: Just say The Office or Parks and Rec if you want to win points.)

What’s on offer? A one-way ticket to Good Vibes City, with pit stops at “Respectful Listening” and “Compliments You Didn’t Know You Needed” Station. I’ll bring the humor, decent cooking skills (emphasis on ‘decent’), and a strong commitment to keeping things drama-free and fun.

If you’re up for trading sarcastic banter, going on a little adventure, and maybe turning up the heat if we vibe, let’s chat. Bonus points if you have a pet I can befriend (hey, I’m trying to grow my cuddle buddy squad). Requirements? Good hygiene, a solid sense of humor, and the willingness to laugh at my bad puns.

Let’s keep it light, local, and see if we can turn some laughs into something a bit more memorable. So, what’s your guilty pleasure show, and how many tries do you need to land a good selfie? Let’s chat and maybe make DMV a bit more interesting.",1,1730924480.0,VirginiaR4R,1,1.0,False

Tea Recommendations ","I am mainly a coffee drinker, but I am trying to find more teas to sub-in. I have had trouble finding teas I like because my preferences differ greatly from the other tea drinkers in my family. I am mainly a tea bag guy, but am open to loose leaf.

Some Teas I **DO** like:

Celestial Seasonings - Morning Thunder  
Bigelow - Lavender Chamomile + Probiotics  
Bigelow - Peppermint  
Bigelow - Toasted Coconut Almond Bark  
I also enjoy various Yerba Mates, but I don't care for the fuss of the traditional way of drinking it (w/ gourd and bombilla)

Some teas I **DON'T** like:

Anything Spiced (chai, cinnamon, etc.)  
Fruit Teas - (too tangy and weird aftertaste, don't mind the occasional Lemon Ginger though)  
Earl Grey - (not the worst, but not my favorite)

Sorry in advance if this question gets asked too much. Any recommendations are appreciated.

I enjoy romanticising my life with making mundane things extra special.. and since there’s a hole 🕳️ where I’ve removed alcohol, I’m feeling the urge to really romanticise my coffee + herbal tea drinking - a beautiful mug or two, perfecting the flavour, moving from tea bags to loose tea. Instead of being the wild drunk girl, I wanna embody the sober girl who really enjoys a _sober_ drink instead of an alcoholic one.

Is it only me who thinks this way? Perhaps you really got into juices or smoothies. Tell me anything, something, you’ve done similar to the way I think.

Context: Last season, your son, Danny, appeared to skip town. While you were searching for him, you were taken hostage by Aldo Mitzrati, a rather charming mobster, who revealed that your son had stolen from him. Worse, that he worked for him. Yet, you and Aldo hit it off, agreeing to a date and, well, the rest is history. You thought you’d put the past behind you. Buried it with your abusive ex-husband. But, tonight, another ghost from your past has resurfaced… and he’s your father. Worst still, he might not be the only lingering ghost from your past…

Setting: Cael and Sandy’s Home

***

[Scene opens in the kitchen, the day after the call] 


[SFX: Danny and Julian murmuring quietly together] 


[You walk into the kitchen early in the morning and are surprised to see Danny and Julian conspiring] 


[Pause?] 


[D] “Oh… Morning, Ma…” 


[J] “Morning…” 


[Pause…?] 


[D] “...We’re about as OK as you are, if we’re honest… Hearing Dad’s voice… His *real* voice after all this time…” 


[J, quiet] “...I’d forgotten his voice was a little raspier than the fake’s… It was so… bizarre to hear his real voice after all that time…” 


[Pause…] 


[D] “...No, Ma, you sit. We’ll fix your breakfast, for once… You need to take it easy.” 


[SFX: The boys working together to make breakfast while the Listener sits] 


[They try to play it off, but you know your boys. You know when they’re conspiring] 


[D, quietly] “Just play it cool… What Ma doesn’t know won’t hurt her.” 


[J, also quietly] “Danny, I don’t feel good about this… Especially not after what happened last year…” 


[Pause?] 


[Both boys jump and yelp] 


[D] “Christ, I forgot the supernatural hearing!” 


[J] “Guh! Uh… S-Sorry, Ma… We weren’t talking about anything in particular…” 


[. . . ] 


[D] “...Let us finish making breakfast… Then we’ll talk, OK?” 


[Pause…] 


[Pause - Fill for extended length as desired by VA] 


[The boys sit once done, their expressions hard. They set down a full breakfast but you hardly glance at it] 


[Pause…] 


[D] “...I know you don’t want us going, Ma.” 


[J] “And we know it’s dangerous. Trust us…” 


[D & J] “-but we’re still going!” 


[. . . ] 


[The hormones and stress finally get to you and you break down in tears. The boys immediately lose their composure and comfort you as best they can] 


[J] “Oh, w-wait, don’t… Mom, please don’t cry… Please?” 


[D] “Oh God, human emotion… Ma, it’s OK! We’re tough guys! We’ve survived way worse!” 


[Pause!] 


[D, less sure] “...OK, you had to come save us, but-”. 


[J] “Danny. You aren’t winning this argument…” 


[D] “I ain’t even arguing! I just…” 


[He heaves a heavy sigh] 


[D] “...Ma, I gotta do this. That’s one of my Dads out there, in danger, and he owes me a lot of fucking answers and you a whole HELL of a lot of child support, you know?” 


[Pause!!!] 


[At your distress, Aldo hurries into the room. He looks to the boys, to you, and then frowns] 


[A] “Boys, I already told you - this is not a mission that ANY of us are going to attend personally!” 


[D] “But, Dad-!” 


[A] “Daniel, he is in the heart of Belize, if those coordinates are correct. That is deep gang territory, where even money can’t save you. You and Julian are good, yes. You know how to fight, but you aren’t ready for this kind of mission!”


[The boys grow stormy but stay quiet, eyes on the floor as Aldo comforts you] 


[A] “Shh… Sugar Mama, it’s alright… It is alright…” 


[P-Pause…] 


[A] “You aren’t going to lose anyone… Not us, not him, OK? It’s all going to be alright…” 


[Pause…] 


[D] “...Sorry, Ma…” 


[J] “Sorry… We just… We wanted to help, you know?” 


[A] “The best thing you can do right now is be good big brothers and sons, boys… I know you want to help, and it’s damn admirable that you do, but she needs you. And, believe it or not, Daniel, I kind of like you being alive.” 


[D] “Pfft. Best go check if pigs started flying…” 


[Julian lets out an innocent gasp and runs for the window] 


[J] “My babies, no!! You don’t have the proper landing gear!” 


[Aldo and Danny share a chuckle, but your nerves are shot after everything that’s happened] 


[A] “...You’re shaking… OK, that’s enough excitement for one day.” 


[D] “...Ma, are you OK?” 


[Pause…] 


[Your son looks away, guilt in every line on his young face] 


[D] “...Sorry. We’ll drop it. Just… Go get a nap or something, will ya? You look like you’re gonna pull an Exorcist and I doubt Julian wants to clean up barf.” 


[Pause… <3] 


[He sighs and rolls his eyes, but you see that little smile] 


[D] “Yeah, yeah, love you too… Take care of her, Aldo, will ya?” 


[Aldo scoffs but plays along] 


[A] “Well, of course! Anything else while I’m at it, Bossman? Perhaps a latte?” 


[Danny grins at him] 


[D] “Well if you’re offering-!” 


[Aldo laughs and shakes his head] 


[A] “You’ve taken that barista class, Daniel. You know vast leagues more than I do on making coffee taste like something besides bitter bean juice.” 


[Pause <3] 


[D & J] “Love you, too, Ma!” 


[SFX: The Listener retreating with Aldo] 


[Aldo helps you stand and walks you back to the guest room] 


[A] “Here we go, my lady love… Do you need me to call Sandy? She said she could run home from the hospital in an emergency, and Cael is just down the road at the farm supply store. I think Frank is only ten minutes away doing horse lessons or something…” 


[Pause…] 


[Aldo holds you while you break down, gently rubbing your back] 


[A] “Shh… it’s OK, my lady love… I promise you, it’s all OK, alright?” 


[Pause…] 


[A] “The boys aren’t going anywhere, and neither am I. I sat down and talked things out with them, with some excellent help from Frank, to be honest. It took some convincing, but they seem to finally get that the three of us aren’t soldiers or mercenaries… I’ve taught them the basics, sure, largely to protect themselves, but we’d be more harm than help going to get Lorenzo. We’re staying right here, and I’m sending the best people I have for the job, alright…? Don’t know why those two thought they could slip by after that talk… but I get it.” 


[Pause…] 


[He continues to hold you until you calm down] 


[A] “There we go… No stress, remember? Sandy said she’d ax-kick my head off if I let you stress too much, hmhm.” 


[. . . ] 


[He looks to you, and there’s a tremendous pressure and pain behind his brilliant green eyes, even though his smile is gentle] 


[A] “Don’t you apologize… Don’t you *ever* apologize for ‘dragging me into this mess’, do you hear? None of this is your fault. This is just… the ugliness that comes from running with mobsters… and you don’t deserve it. You deserve the world, and I’m damn sure going to make certain you get it, no matter what happens when he comes home… OK?” 


[Pause <3] 


[He holds you until you calm, at long last] 


[A] “Rest for now, sweetheart… OK? Tomorrow will be better. I promise.” 


[Pause <3] 


[SFX: Fade out on them cuddling] 


***


[Scene re-opens in the guest bedroom] 


[You wake, some hours later, and find Aldo snoring away, still holding you close. It’s hard not to smile at him, even though he snores like a bear] 


[Pause…?] 


[A, sleepily] “Huh…? Mrmhlr… OK. You walkie. Clear head. Understood.” 


[He smiles and makes happy, rumbly Dad noises as you kiss his cheek and head out into the warm night air to clear your head] 


[SFX: The Listener creeping on old, wooden floorboards and out into country, nighttime ambiance] 


[You walk around the farm a bit in the peaceful quiet. It’s rare that the house isn’t full of laughter or yelling or Sandy chasing your boys, so you take your time… Perhaps, that was a mistake] 


[SFX: Subtle footsteps on the grass] 


[The hairs on your arm stand up simultaneously, and you know you aren’t alone. Cold metal presses to your back and a worn, but somewhat familiar, voice rasps against your ear] 


[???] “In the truck. Now.” 


[. . . ] 


[SFX: The Listener obeying] 


[The mysterious invader prods you into a truck hidden in a nearby clearing, still running. He’s moving fast, too fast for you to think] 


[Pause…?] 


[???] “Don’t speak. I will put you down if I have to, pregnant or not.” 


[ . . . ] 


[???] “You’ve made a lot of problems for me, little lady… I’ve played a very careful hand all these years to make sure the power imbalance in the Mitzrati family shifted back to someone who actually knew how to handle it…” 


[...Pause?] 


[The man pushes you hard enough that you almost stumble, snarling at your simple question:] 


[???] “Who I am doesn’t concern you… It’s time for you to join that snake ex-husband of yours while I fix the damage your current one has done. Now, get. Fucking. MOVING!!” 


[SFX: The Listener being forced into the car] 


[You have no choice. You get in the car as it idles, and the man quickly takes the driver’s seat and peels off on the old dirt path. You can only hold on to your swollen stomach, at this point, and pray…] 


[SFX: Fade out on the car screeching away]

So, for the record, I'm not diagnosed with ADHD but I highly speculate I have it. I am currently, because of a paper I wrote earlier this week which left me incredibly stressed and the election today, struggling with racing thoughts. It's like my brain is constantly wired and I cannot calm it down. It being wired isn't unusual for me and I usually counter-act it with coffee, but in the evenings I've usually been tired with my brain slowing down, which isn't the case the past few days. 

How do I calm down, both, the anxiety and racing thoughts? I don't mind thinking about things before bed but I wanna think about things I actually wanna think about which I can't do either at the moment because I am so focused on the stress. How do I distract myself? Obviously this also comes with sleeping issues since I can't stop thinking about the stuff that's going down, which does not help.
