1pg7y3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1pg7y3k/nespressos_welcome_gift_promo_is_a_scam_terrible/,Nespresso’s “Welcome Gift” promo is a scam + terrible customer service (chat log inside),"I just had one of the worst customer service experiences with Nespresso, and wanted to warn anyone else confused about their so-called “Welcome Gift” promo.

**TL;DR:**  
It took me **over 30 minutes** to reach a human. When I finally got one, they **didn’t answer my question**, kept repeating irrelevant info about some machine-bundle promotion I never signed up for, and then **hung up on me**. The whole “welcome gift after 2 orders” thing feels like a scam.

# What actually happened

I saw a Nespresso promotion called **“Nespresso Signature Welcome Gift.”**  
It clearly says:

>

I placed 2 orders.

No welcome gift. No email. Nothing.

So I contacted their chat. Here’s how it went:

# Chat Timeline 

**Me:** Hi, I placed 2 orders but haven’t received my welcome gift.

**Bot:** Please rephrase.  
**Me:** Talk to an agent.  
**Bot:** Your place in queue: 46… 36… 29… 22… 12… 2.  
(About 30 minutes waiting.)

**Agent:** Can I have your name/email/phone?  
I provide it.

**Me:** I placed 2 orders but didn’t get my welcome gift.  
**Agent:** Which welcome gift?  
**Me:** The one the website says you get after ordering twice.

**Agent:** That’s part of our *three-step Welcome Journey*. You get:  
– $10 off with your machine  
– Insert in the box for a second offer  
– Insert for a third offer, etc.

**Me:** I never bought a machine from you. The promo simply said “receive welcome gifts after 1st and 2nd coffee order.” It didn’t say anything about machine purchase or needing special codes.

**Agent:** Please send a screenshot.  
(I send the text.)

**Agent:** Which gifts are included in that promotion?  
**Me:** It didn’t specify—just said “welcome gift.” Isn’t that what I’m asking you?

Agent repeats the machine promo **again**, word-for-word.

**Me:** I don’t understand. The promo didn’t mention needing a machine.

**Agent:** Please call us at 800-562-1465.  
(Does not answer the actual question.)

**Me:** You didn’t answer my question.

**Agent:** *Thank you for contacting Nespresso. Have a lovely day!*  
**→ Chat ends. They disconnected.**

# Why I think this promo is misleading

* The promo **literally says** you get a welcome gift after your 1st and 2nd *coffee* orders.
* Nowhere does it say you must buy a machine, use codes, or find inserts in the box.
* Their agent refused to answer a simple question (“Where is my welcome gift?”), and instead pushed some unrelated *machine bundle* program.
* When I pointed out the mismatch, she just **ended the chat**.

If this isn’t a bait-and-switch, it’s very close.

If anyone else has gone through this or actually received these so-called “welcome gifts,” I’d love to hear what you were told. Right now it feels like a total scam.

So I built Gitffy - a life metrics dashboard that reads from a markdown file in your private GitHub repo.

How it works:

\- You maintain a [life.md](http://life.md) file in a private repo with daily entries

\- Connect Gitffy to your GitHub (via GitHub App)

\- It parses the markdown and shows charts, trends, and insights

\- Auto-syncs when you push changes - no manual uploads

Example entry format:

\## 2024-12-07

\- mood: 8

\- sleep: 7.5

\- exercise: running

\- coffee: 2

\- productivity: 7

Features:

\- Multiple chart types (line, bar, radar, etc.)

\- Dark/light mode

\- AI-powered insights (optional, uses Gemini)

\- Timeline and day-detail views

\- Your data stays in YOUR repo

Why GitHub?

\- Version history for free

\- Private repos = your data stays private

\- Edit from anywhere (phone, VS Code, etc.)

\- No vendor lock-in - it's just markdown

Basically I'm looking for general thoughts, prose, pacing, what your first impressions of Calden are.

For context, this is probably going to end up being Chapter 3 or 4 in my novel, so readers will have a little bit of context as to some of the proper nouns. Basically there is a civil war that just kicked off between Commonwealth of Rosalia and the Dominion of Eldaria. Eldaria, Draymont, and Gaspardine are essentially states in the Dominion of Eldaria. Nostrov is an empire that the then unifed Commonwealth of Rosalia had fought a few years prior.

  
\*\*\*

Brigadier Calden Rhyne sat atop horse overlooking the hastily assembled collection of farm boys and village folk that was to be his grand command in the newly formed Army of Eldaria. Puffing the cigar held in his white gloved hand, he inspected his troops.

Three thousand in the brigade, evenly divided into three regiments—two from the Realm of Eldaria, one from Calden’s home in Draymont.

“Well TJ,” he said to the Gaspardine captain serving as the entirety of his staff. “They certainly don’t look like soldiers.” Calden removed the cigar from his mouth and spat.

The young captain—he had to be no more than twenty-five—replied, “I’m sure you’ll whip them into shape soon enough.” He scratched his chin, the only part of his face that *wasn’t* covered by his thick black beard. “Although it certainly would help their cause if you try not to burn the supplies we’re after. Hardee coughed, and then added, “Sir.”

He was right, of course. The farm-boy soldiers—if you could call them that—wore mostly homespun butternut uniforms. Scant few had hats, and some just wore plain farm clothes. Cal shook his head and chuckled in dismay when he noticed that more than just a few didn’t even have shoes.

They were armed with any and all weapons they could scrounge—from antiquated muskets from the Nostrovian War, to long barreled deer hunting rifles, to shotguns. A few lads even seemed to be armed with old flintlocks stolen from their grandfathers’ attics, for what little good they’d do.

But there was something about his motley crew of men—a spark in the eye, and eagerness to fight for their rights. Some of it, Calden knew from his own experience, was the naivety being young, but he could feel their fighting spirit.

Most of the officers, on the other hand, looked the part but didn’t inspire the same level of confidence in Calden. Sons of wealthy aristocrats and planters, they wore elaborate dyed orange uniforms, complete with gilded sabers, bleached white gloves, and brand-new flat top, wide brimmed hats. Somehow, they were able to procure their uniforms—more like costumes, Calden mused—at a moment’s notice while he was still clad in the hunter green uniform of the Rosalia, the land he betrayed.

“For those I haven’t had the pleasure of meeting,” he said, taking off his hat in a mock bow. “I’m Brigadier Calden Rhyne.”

“General Romark, our esteemed leader, has ordered us to advance a few miles over yonder,” Cal said, pointing to the east. “There we will find ourselves a Rosalian supply depot.” He took another puff of his cigar. “We’ll be relieving those poor souls of their wares.”

“A couple hours from now you’ll be equipped like real soldiers, not boys playin’ make believe.” Cheers and whoops bellowed from the assembled men.

“Is it true you’re a Wielder, General?” A boy from the ranks called out, clearly lacking any semblance of military discipline.

A crooked smile grew on Calden’s face. *This will be fun.*

“Well boy—you’re about to find out.”

\*\*\*

Calden rode at the head of his charging infantry, green flames of his Wielding flaring on the fingertips of his free hand. As they surged forward, he shot small green flames at enemies, engulfing any poor bastard in a deadly s embrace. Sorcerous fire mixed with the smoke of musket shot, casting an eerie glow lingering on the battlefield.

It wasn’t fair really. It was hard enough for disciplined infantry to stand against a Wielder in their midst; he had learned that firsthand years ago in Nostrovia. But the untrained men in his way—no different than the men charging behind him, save for their equipment—never stood a chance.

In less than thirty minutes of fighting, the Commonwealth troops broke and ran. Cal urged his mount forward, fire still flinging form his fingers, taking men in the back and sending them with a jolt to the ground, never to rise again.

Calden felt it then—the darkness returning with a sharp punch like a musket ball in the stomach. Caught off guard, he lurched in the saddle, his hands gripping the reins with all their might being the only thing stopping him from falling.

He regained himself, the strange feeling inside pulling him forward, urging him on. It did not speak to him in words, but he knew instinctively what it wanted—to kill more. Every foe felled fueled him further, more than any of his starstone vials could do. He rode on, giving in to the calling.

Three foolish brave men stood as he galloped forward, lowering their muskets to take aim. Balls of flame bounding between fingertips coalesced into a scythe-like shape. Calden swung it as he surged forward, ethereal weapon cleanly relieving three heads from their bodies.

Soon, there were no more targets for Calden’s sorcery. He let the last of his starstone fueled magic peter out, slowing his mount to a trot. His victorious men swarmed about and through the abandoned supply depot, helping themselves to muskets, munitions, and clothes.

Some few enterprising men had stumbled upon stores of coffee and fresh bacon, and were handing them out with childhood glee. A few more had found some whiskey and after taking large gulps, passed around the bottles like men about a campfire.

Calden dismounted and turning away from the all-too-easily won spoils of the supply depot and back to the carnage laid bare behind him. The small green masses of Commonwealth dead spotted the clearing behind him like the stout green shrubs in the deserts of Nostrov from wars prior. An occasional Dominion body laid unmoving, although there were far fewer. *Thank the gods for that, at least*.

A trail of blood caught his eye. Following the red path led him to a Commonwealth soldier, pulling himself inch by inch away from the carnage. Calden watched for a moment as the crawling slowed and then stopped, body falling defeated in a puff of dirt and dust.

Calden approached curiously. The boy—not much older than his son Holden—lay on his side, clutching at seeping entrails, desperately trying to put them back where they belong. As he came closer, the wisps of green smoke could be seen rising from his wound. Calden had done this himself.

The boy noticed him then, with those glassy, distant eyes that always came shortly before death. “Why?” the boy spat out weakly as blood leaked from corner of his mouth. “You…were one of us once.”

Cal clenched his clammy hands, forcing down the bile rising from his belly, his eyes struggling to meet the gaze of the human face his powers had all but snuffed the life out from.

“I’m sorry, son,” he muttered. No other words came to him. He knelt down beside him on one knee.

The young soldier struggled with one hand to reach into his coat pocket, pulling out a letter. The leaking blood from his mouth became a gurgle now; he didn’t have long left. He held out the letter, stained from the blood and guts on his hands. Cal watched as it flapped lazily in the breeze, like autumns leaves drifting from trees. “For…mother. At least see to it she gets it.”

Calden looked at the nearly dead man and blinked. He slowly reached for the letter, taking it from his pallid hands. “I’ll do what I can, boy.” He placed his hand on the downed man’s chest as the life left his eyes. “I’ll tell her you fought bravely.”

Pressing his two fingers to his victim’s lifeless eyes, he softly closed them. Rising, he stuffed the letter into his breast pocket and began to head back to the supplies the Rosalian soldier died to defend. With that, the sorcery—and the darkness along with it—only then fully left his body.

Captain Hardee approached not long after, a mix of awe and horror on his soot-stained face. “Well done, sir. That was…well it certainly was something else,” he spit out between ragged breaths.

A pained smile formed across Calden’s face. “Thanks, TJ,” he said pointing out towards the treasure in front of them. “Give ‘em a few minutes to enjoy themselves, then get the colonels to start reining them in a bit. There needs to be *some* order, you know.”

“Will do, sir.”

Calden nodded, gesturing with his eyes for Hardee to get to it. Hardee saluted quickly and ran off. Once he was safely out of sight, Calden walked behind a nearby oak tree, the refuge the dead soldier had been headed towards. Removing his blood stained gloves, he wiped the sweat from his brow.

1pg7cyw,https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSfoqt7V4/,Help me find this novel please,"

I'd been dating a rich boy for a year. He never made me feel small for being broke. When I scored some crazy group deal takeout, he'd grin and say, babe, you're a genius. 

When I caught a limited-time sale on a dress, he'd go, damn, that's impressive. When my crappy studio started leaking and I patched the ceiling myself, he kissed my forehead and called me independent. Then on Black Friday, I borrowed his Amazon account to snag a pair of $9.99 canvas sneakers. 

Right as I checked out, the app popped up a little banner. On this day, last year, it was a pair of Chanel heels, size 5, marked as a gift for his ex. The note he'd left on that order said, my baby girl's feet shouldn't have to hurt in cheap shoes. 

The second I saw that order, my thumb moved on its own. I opened it. They were gorgeous, sleek black stilettos, all glossy leather and red soles. 

I could picture the woman who'd wear them. Flawless legs, perfect posture, the kind of competence that walks into a room and owns it. The high I'd felt from winning the flash sale sneakers disappeared like smoke.

My chest tightened. I started scrolling through his old orders. They were all from two years ago, back when Ethan was still with his ex. 

Joe Malone perfume, a Louis Vuitton bag, a Tiffany necklace. I didn't even need pictures to see her. She was the type who'd fit right into some downtown Manhattan cocktail party. 

Perfume on her pulse points, Chanel on her shoulders, lipstick that never smudged. You didn't need a diary to see how hard Ethan had loved her. You could see it in the tracking numbers. 

My chest felt heavy. I backed out of the app. I told myself, that's all in the past. 

A good current girlfriend doesn't interrogate her boyfriend about his ex. A mature woman doesn't get jealous over things that are already over. At least that's what I tried to chant to myself. 

But the unease didn't leave. My thumb drifted to the notes app. I meant to close it. 

And froze. There was a file named, her. I knew I shouldn't open something that private. 

I knew. I opened it anyway. And yeah, a tiny part of me was hoping, what if her is me? I knew it wasn't by the first line. 

She loves spicy food. Strike one. I can't handle heat. 

She's picky. Won't touch cilantro, scallions, or garlic. Not me. 

I grew up eating whatever was cheap and filling. She loves rainy days and walking barefoot on hardwood floors. She loves cats. 

She's impossible to coax out of a mood when she's mad. But when she smiles, her eyes light up. On her period, her stomach cramps like hell. 

But she still eats ice cream. Then the last line. You always make my heart ache. 

I never want you to struggle. Every letter screamed Chloe Sinclair. Ethan's ex. 

The one before me. My fingers clenched so hard around the phone my knuckles went white. I could feel the color drain from my face. 

The shower cut off. Water stopped pounding tile. The sound yanked me out of my spiral. 

I slammed the screen dark. Shoved the phone away. And rearranged my face. 

Ethan walked out of the bathroom shirtless. Towel in his hand. Water rolled down over his pale, solid chest. 

Slid over the line of his abs. He popped the fridge open. Grabbed a cold beer. 

Cracked it one-handed. Took a long pull. Then walked over to me. 

He caught my expression and smiled. What's up? You didn't get them? I did. I said. 

He grinned wider. Reached out to pinch my cheek and dropped onto the couch beside me. That's my girl. 

Only 500 pairs in the whole country and you still snatched one? On any other night I would have been stupidly proud. But the image of those Chanel heels flickered through my mind. My mouth moved before my brain could stop it. 

Ethan, aren't you embarrassed by me? He blinked. Beer halfway to his lips. Then set the cam down slowly. 

Why the hell would I be embarrassed? Because I'm always chasing discounts. Hunting coupons. Buying the cheapest crap.

His expression sharpened. Serious. That's not embarrassing. 

That's called being smart with money. My buddies are jealous as hell I've got a girlfriend who actually knows how to stretch a dollar. My heart sank another inch. 

All the grinding and hustling I'd done just to survive. The way I stitched leaks, patched things, made every penny scream. In his eyes, it was just, she's good at managing money. 

She's thrifty. He didn't hurt for me. He didn't see how hard it was.

I wasn't Chloe. He'd never not let her struggle. The mask slipped off my face. 

I stood up. He caught my wrist. Where are you going? Not staying over? I just remembered I've got an early shift at one of my side jobs tomorrow. 

I'm tired. I should go home. His expression didn't change. 

He just picked up his phone. I'll drive you. It's fine. 

I'll grab an uber. Go to bed early. Text me when you're home. 

Yeah. His fingers loosened. Down on the sidewalk, waiting for the car. 

I glanced up and saw his bedroom lights go dark. It hit me, suddenly, brutally clear. Maybe Ethan didn't actually care about me that much. 

Maybe I wanted a fight. Maybe I wanted proof. Maybe both. 

The next day, I sent him a link to a pair of YSL heels and typed, what do you think of these? He texted back, they're pretty, but not really you. I think sneakers suit you better. Except in that note on his phone, he'd written, it doesn't matter if it suits you. 

If you like it, you should have it. I didn't respond. Didn't want to. 

After that, I just, went quiet. I stopped texting him first. Thing is, Ethan was never the kind of guy who came chasing when I went quiet. 

So when I stopped, the conversation simply, died. Monday he'd texted me a good morning smiling face with smiling eyes. I'd seen it. 

Put the phone face down, and never replied. He didn't follow up. On day five of this weird cold war I'd started with myself. 

I turned my phone off and focused on watching for the bus. The sky chose that exact moment to open up. It didn't just drizzle, it dumped. 

My mood, already in the toilet, went straight to the sewer. Rain slapped against the street, exploded in little white blooms on the asphalt. And suddenly I remembered the first time I'd met Ethan Blake. 

It was raining then, too. I was working the night shift at a 7-11 knockoff, dead on my feet and counting down the minutes. He burst through the door soaked to the skin, dark hair plastered to his forehead, hoodie dripping all over the cheap tile. 

He bought an umbrella. I poured him a cup of hot water from the breakroom kettle. He gave me a polite, thanks, like I'd handed him a miracle. 

That was the first time I really looked at him. He was stupidly handsome. After that, it was a slow, easy slide. 

He came by the store more often, by coincidence. We swapped numbers. Started texting. 

He picked me up after shifts a few times. Took me to late-night diners. Walked me to the subway. 

Then one night, under another stupid rainstorm, he stood outside my building with a massive bouquet of red roses. I remember thinking, this is a prank. Rich boys don't actually date broke girls out of K-cup coffee and instant noodles.

He was younger than me, from money. I was a broke woman from a single mom family, two jobs deep. It made zero sense. 

But his eyes were shining when he said, Nat, let me take care of you. Maybe it was the way he said my name. Maybe it was the way my heart slammed against my ribs. 

I said yes. After we got together, Ethan surprised me. He was calmer than guys his age. 

Steady, soft-spoken. And for a spoiled rich kid, he never once made fun of where I came from. If anything, every time I stretched a dollar, he praised me for it. 

My coworkers envied me. Sis, you hit the jackpot. Rich and gentle? That's husband material. 

At first, I thought so too. But the longer we dated, the more something felt... off. He never really got angry in front of me. 

Never raised his voice. Never argued. Whatever I wanted, he agreed. 

There was no impatience, no irritation, no real friction. On paper, it was perfect. In my gut, it felt wrong. 

I used to think I was just being dramatic. Until that night with his notes app. Because that's when I realized, for all his perfection, I couldn't feel his love. 

My life had never been pretty. Single mom. Dad gone before middle school. 

Right after I graduated college, mom got seriously sick. My kid sister was still in high school. So I never got to be one of those girls who could afford to float. 

From freshman year on, I juggled multiple part-time jobs. After graduation, I once worked three jobs a day just to keep us afloat. Dating wasn't on the table. 

Ethan was the exception. For the first time, I let myself believe I could be loved and But the joke was on me. Because I couldn't actually relax around him. 

I didn't dare show him how hard things really were. My apartment was a cramped, soggy shoebox and a shitty walk-up. When it leaked, I bought sealant and patched the ceiling myself. 

When the light blew, I changed the fixture. Every day I squeezed into rush-hour buses and trains, wearing $9.99 sneakers and $5 t-shirts that faded after three washes. Food? Discounted pre-packed salads after 8 PM. 

Marked-down meat at the end of the day. Half-off sandwiches from the convenience store floor display. Sometimes I'd treat myself to an expensive meal once a month, which meant a Groupon for a cheap set menu at some chain restaurant. 

I never thought of it as suffering. It was just life. Then I met Ethan, and suddenly there was a comparison. 

I finally understood that line. Love is the ache that says, I can't stand to see you struggle. I knew I was being a little irrational. 

To be fair, I'd never told Ethan how bad it actually was. Never asked him for anything. But was I really that invisible to him? Did he not see the faded shirts? The worn-out sneakers? The dark circles under my eyes? He'd once written, If you sit quietly next to me while I work I feel guilty. 

Like you're bored. And one tiny frown will hurt my heart. He'd written that. 

For Chloe. Would he ever let her hustle three jobs and patch a leaking ceiling alone? Would he watch her live in a sketchy neighborhood because it was cheaper? Would he let her walk home alone in the dark? Of course he wouldn't. But me? For me, you're so independent. 

Was praise. On the third rainy night, I finally admitted it to myself. Ethan didn't love me like that. 

I honestly thought our silent war would drag on until we just, fizzled out. Break up by ghosting. But that evening, when I walked out of my office, Ethan was leaning against his black Mercedes at the curb. 

He'd dressed up, dark shirt, tailored coat, hair pushed back, a bouquet of flowers in his hands, and a easy smile on his face. The kind of picture every girl walking by did a double take at. I felt, nothing, no flutter, just the weight in my chest. 

I walked over anyway. Some things deserve to be said out loud. He slipped his fingers through mine like nothing was wrong. 

Happy birthday, Nat. An entire week of radio silence. He added, I figured you were buried in work. 

Didn't want to bug you. But I'm not letting your birthday go by without seeing you. The word breakup lodged in my throat.

I mean, how petty would it sound? Dumping him on my birthday because he hadn't loved me the same way he loved his ex years ago? He brought me back to his penthouse and cooked dinner himself. Then he dramatically pulled a cake from the fridge like he'd planned out the perfect surprise. Make a wish, he insisted.

My preferred area is usually closer to Playa 88 because that's my favourite beach and it's (relatively) quiet. The closest I've stayed to the highway before was on 35th in Zazil Ha, and I didn't mind how long it took me to get to the beach since I would just take a bike down fifth after walking, but I'm wondering if this is a bit too out of the way on foot (I'm not a fan of the busy central beaches, Playa 72 is the closest to this location I would go hang out). 

I know Playa is just loud in general but there are definitely better areas than others for some peace, so wondering if this pinned\^ area is noisy. 

I'm also solo female, and wondering about the general safety above the highway there? I've never stayed near Benito Juarez. I'll be grocery shopping and cooking at the air bnb so restaurants and things aren't a big priority (more of a nice to have)

I have to book last minute so my options are limited, it will be a longer term stay, and there are a couple other options closer to 5th closer to nicte ha, but the quality of the rental is a lot better here -

Any information you could give me to help make me a snappy decision would be greatly apprectiated! Thank you

1pg7710,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1pg7710/2_years_ago/,2 years ago...,"Mom passed 4 months ago and the holidays approaching brings with me an extre layer of grief. The intensity of my grief has hightened this month just as I thought I was getting better.

Mom always loved the going ons around Christmas and for many years would go on solo outings to this place or that place mostly to window shop or look at the decorations. As a guy who didn't like shopping or long strolls around malls, i never felt much inclination to go. I always encouraged her to go, she was retired and i felt she was entitled to do whatever she liked. It never occured to me those were lost opportunities to make memories with her when she reached out to invite me. Those were my regrets.

Roughly 2 years ago in December 2023, about half a year before she complained about pain on her right breast and nine months before her cancer diagnosis, she asked and I agreed to accompany her for a special christmas train ride to the city where upon arrival we split up; she went around the city and the harbor looking at all the christmas displays, had some scones and coffee for lunch, while I went to catch a movie. We met up again after a couple of hours for the train the trip home. It was all things said another uneventful day in the life. Something i've never done, that she wanted to do that I thankfully agreed to do with her. Looking back, knowing what i know now, i would have cancelled the movie and went to lunch with her instead and do the window shopping and christmas stuff. Another regret.

This year, I went on the same train ride again. I felt like it was a trip I needed to make to honor her memory.

That day in 2023, I took some pictures of us waiting on the train platform, of her sitting in the train looking up at me as I had to stand due to how crowded the train that day was and i found those pictures that were mundane memories filed into my google photos heartbreaking to revisit this year. I couldn't help it but i scrolled through them again this morning, looking at her on the train platform on my phone, and looking up to see an empty space where she would have stood.

Looking from photos from that day 2 years ago, i could only feel sadness, pain and sorrow. There's a sense of quiet pride, and perhaps appreciation in the photo i took of  her looking up at me on the train in that fleeting photo 2 years ago. This is something i've only recently noticed.

1pg76cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoShillReviews/comments/1pg76cn/review_of_amazon_basics_aaa_alkaline/,"Review of Amazon Basics AAA Alkaline High-Performance Batteries, 1.5 Volt, 10-Year Shelf Life, 36 Count (Pack of 1)","The listing says 36 AAA alkaline batteries for $11.07, which works out to about 31 cents a cell. That’s cheaper than Duracell or Energizer, but only if you ignore the fact that these are alkaline cells, not lithium. In other words, you’re getting the cheapest chemistry money can buy, and the shelf life claim of 10 years is only true if you store them in a cool, dry place and never let them freeze or overheat. The reviews are mostly positive, but then again, most people don’t test batteries beyond seeing if they work. Amazon’s own brand is made in China, and the specs are what you’d expect for the price. If you need a lot of AAA batteries for low-drain devices like TV remotes, these will do the job, but for anything that needs reliable power for more than a few weeks, you might want to consider spending a bit more for lithium cells. The 10-year shelf life claim is a bit of a gamble, as alkaline batteries can leak if left in a device for too long, and these are no exception. The packaging is a frustration-free cardboard box, which is good for the environment but won’t protect the batteries from a drop or crush in transit as well as the plastic blister packs Duracell uses. All that said, if you just want to stock up on cheap AAA batteries and don’t mind the risk of them being half-dead on arrival or going flat before you get to use them, this is a way to do it for less than the price of a couple of cups of coffee. Just don’t expect them to last like the marketing claims unless you use them right away in something like a wall clock that only needs replacing every few years.

Fairly good Japanese ♡ LINE/Mixi2 ready.  
5'11"" (180 cm) bear build — trimmed beard, thick arms, broad chest. Boyish smile under the beard.

About me:  
- Cook cast-iron steaks here, okonomiyaki and oden when I’m in Japan  
- Retro games (SNES co-op nights), spooky movies, history books at 2 a.m., perfect pour-over coffee  
- Travel rhythm: long summers traveling, Midwest winters, always planning the next flight

What I want most:  
I’ve loved deeply before, though I’ve never been married. I know how rare and precious that quiet, intense love is — the kind where every day we choose each other, support each other, and slowly build the exact life we both dream of.
  
That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other.  
I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You:  
- Japanese (living in Japan right now, or already in the US)  
- 23–46  
- Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever  
- Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)  
- Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

A little more about the woman I hope writes me:  
You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip. You don’t need to be perfect; you just need to be ready to choose “us” every single day, the same way I will.

Reply with:  
1. One thing you’d love to do together on a lazy Sunday  
2. Where you are right now (city/prefecture in Japan, or US city)  
3. One question for me

First five thoughtful replies get a 60-second calm voice note (English or Japanese).

I’m patient and only looking for one person.

My relative is very unclean and needs my help getting their home ready to sell. When I first started helping, it was sooooooo bad, even non ocd people wouldn’t go inside. It would’ve been fine if they kept up the cleaning…. Every time I go back to clean, it’s the same if not worse.. I cannot take it anymore.

They found out they had a contagious lung infection the day I was supposed to come over to clean and didn’t tell me until they opened the door coughing saying I could still clean... then they didn’t disinfect a single thing once they felt better, until I said something.

You know, I’m also going to vent about the rats. They have a baddddd rodent problem and they do nothinggggg about it. Nothingggggg. I don’t feel safe eating a single thing from that household because I’ve seen the rat pee on the cutting boards and the rat poo in the coffee cups. I know nothing is washed prior to use. Nastyyyyyyy.  

I love my relative but cmonnnnnn. It’s been a year now, and I’m the only one cleaning a house I don’t even live in while they continuously make more messes. I’ve sought help for them but they’re an adult, gov can’t do much at all.

So I wanted to vent about the mess because thinking about it makes me want to scream and I can’t stop thinking about it. Im tired of internally panicking every time I’m there, and sometimes just leaving because I’m crashing out over it. Thank you for your time lmao ",2,1765074879.0,OCD,0,1.0,False

I am a 19 year old female currently in my 3rd year of college. For as long as I can remember, I have had issues with fatigue. As far back as kindergarten, I remember feeling sad that I no longer had nap time like I did in Pre-K. All through middle school and high school I slept through classes and took naps after school. 
This had always been attributed to laziness by my parents, and then eventually depression in my early teenage years. However, all other variables in my life have changed in some way but this has not. Caffeine has never helped (only makes me shaky), I can drink coffee and other things late at night and fall asleep perfectly fine. I switched antidepressants to Wellbutrin about 9 months ago, and during a checkup the doctors were surprised that I took it before bed with no issues.
 I fall asleep anywhere, anytime. I can get 10 hours of sleep at night, wake up at noon, take a nap from 2-6pm, and go to bed perfectly fine at 10pm. No matter how much sleep I get I never feel rested, I am always sleepy, and always feel like I have no energy. I have tried keeping myself from taking naps during the day but it doesn’t help. I fall asleep without trying or realizing it. I fall asleep taking notes in class, words turning into ink stains or incomprehensible scribbles. I fall asleep having conversations over the phone, and end up mumbling gibberish before something snaps me out of it. I’ve fallen asleep at sporting events, driving, standing in line, and nothing seems to help. I snooze my alarm in the morning and fall back asleep and have an entire dream in the 10 minutes before it goes off again. 
I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2022 and was on strattera (non stimulant) until 4 months ago when I switched to Adderall XR 20mg. For the first month it was amazing, I no longer felt like I was going to fall asleep and like I could actually do stuff during the day. However, that started to fade and then was prescribed 10mg IR Adderall to take for afternoon slump. Again, this helped, but it has started seeming ineffective now. Last week, I took one of my IRs and intended to nap for an hour while it kicked in, and then get up and do homework. This was 5pm, I didn’t wake up until the next day at 11am. I have taken these later in the evening than recently several times, but it never seems to give me the boost I need, and I’m able to fall asleep like normal.

I am just so frustrated, i finally had a breakthrough after years of dealing with this, and now it’s not working anymore. I have lost jobs, friends, and missed out of so many opportunities because I simply cannot stay awake. I am so tired (no pun intended) of dealing with this, and anytime I bring it up to doctors it’s always linked back to depression or that I just need to make sure I have a good sleep schedule bla bla bla. I am not lazy, I graduated at 16 in the top 6% of my high school class, was captain of the dance team, and did many other activities. I am in college 2 states away from my family by myself, handling a difficult major and a laboratory job. I eat relatively healthy and worked out 3-4 times a week (I got pneumonia 2 months ago which put a halt to that but I’m trying to get back to it). I am 19 years old, I shouldn’t be staying home from evening events because I’m exhausted, I want to be able to actually spend time with my boyfriend rather than just sleep the entire time. I want to wake up and go to the gym, go to class, go to work, but it just seems so impossible.

I am going to a primary care physician for the first time in 4ish years next week, and plan to bring up this issue in addition to other random health concerns (mostly digestive issues). I do have a history of autoimmune diseases and sleep apnea in my family which I’m assuming would make sense to look deeper into.

26 'And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?'"" (John 11:25-26) 

Jesus says something here that most of us don't hear from any other source.  I think we humans are geared to search for answers to spiritual questions.  We're prone to seek truth outside ourselves because we know we don't have it all.  It's human nature to look to an earthly parent-figure for answers if we were raised by people who seemed to ""have it all together."" But our Messiah tells us, ""Call no man on earth 'father,' for one is your Father, He who is in heaven -- and you are all brothers. And do not be called teachers; for One is your Teacher, the Messiah."" ([Matthew 23:9-10](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/mat/23/9-10/s_952009), [Jeremiah 3:19](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/jer/3/19/s_748019))

Life is a classroom. The lesson God wants to teach us is how to live forever, in unity with Him and each other. Unfortunately, humanity without God either accepts death as part of life, or tries to find ways to live forever for selfish or pointless reasons. We have to look for answers from a teacher we want to emulate. Jesus showed us that He knew how to live forever by rising from the dead. He showed us how to make eternal life worth living with His teachings and His love. We aspire, as Enoch did, to learn to walk with God and become His eternal children.

Knowing who to learn from is of limited value if we think we already know what's being taught, and rush through our lessons. We've all heard ""love your neighbor as yourself,"" but how many of us love ourselves enough to make healthy choices all the time?  How often is my neighbor's emergency as high a priority as my own?  
We have to admit it when we're in the dark -- not just as an admission to ourselves, but to those who depend on us.  Facing our human insufficiency together lets us reach out to our Savior in unity.  ""Wherever two or three are gathered, there I am in their midst.""  ([Matthew 18:20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/mat/18/20/s_947020), [Malachi 3:16-17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mal/3/16-17/s_928017))  I didn't realize how powerful this was until my grown son said the best thing I did as a parent was to tell him that someday he would figure out that I'm not perfect, and that I hoped he still loved me when it happened. 

I'm blessed by Charles Spurgeon's interpretation of Jesus' parable, The Pearl of Great Price. He said that for Jesus, we humans were the pearls of great price and the hidden treasure that Jesus gave up everything for.  When we truly appreciate the depth of suffering Messiah went through for us, it changes our hearts. He becomes our Pearl; our greatest pursuit in life.  He's worth everything we give up so we can be His hands and feet to the world.  I could barely give up a cup of coffee for the sake of a higher good when the Lord blessed me with this truth.  I'm thankful He doesn't leave us like He finds us!  ([Luke 14:27-33](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/luk/14/27-33/s_987030), [Romans 12:1-2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/rom/12/1-2/s_1058002), [Ezekiel 16:6](https://www.blueletterbible.org/rsv/eze/16/6/s_818006))  

I don't know how Jesus does it, but His parables keep me on track so I can draw closer and closer to Him.  When we, like the pearl merchant, give up worldly pursuits to have Jesus, for awhile, we have nothing but our precious Pearl.  Without our creature comforts, we find ourselves in the lowest earthly room at the wedding feast of His word. ([Job 23:12](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/job/23/12/s_459012), [Psalm 100:3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/psa/100/3/s_578003), [John 1:1-4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/jhn/1/1-4/s_998001), [John 1:14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/jhn/1/14/s_998014), [John 6:35](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/jhn/6/35/s_1003035), [Song 2:4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/sng/2/4/s_673004))

1pg6pii,https://i.redd.it/6wmj7kpdyo5g1.jpeg,Candle Day Haul,"I had a list of 10 candles or so, mostly bring back scents and candle day exclusives that I wanted to purchase. Such as Brown Sugar and Fig, Smoked Vanilla, Snow Day, Coffee and Donuts etc.

I smelled Brown Sugar and Fig in store but they all smelled really light. The scent didn’t wow me either. Coffee and Donuts wasn’t anything special. Although I will say it did smell like a donut shop, or as someone else said the inside of a Dunkin’ Donuts. Smoked Vanilla I actually enjoyed. It reminded me of a bonfire, which I wasn’t expecting. But all the ones I smelled were light. I smelled multiple of each candle to try and find the strongest one I could, to no avail. 

I really enjoyed Peppermint Marshmallow. It’s just what I was expecting. Neapolitan is the star for me though. The scent is ACCURATE. And the jar design is pretty too. I smelled Chocolate Drizzle and it smells like what you would expect. Was kind of light though, so if I want a chocolate scent I’d rather just stick to Hot Cocoa and Cream. 

Glazed Cherries was one I was interested in but just smelled a little too similar to Black Cherry Merlot, so decided against it. 

Blueberry Sugar was one I was interested in but was not special, to me. I got no graham cracker note in any of the ones I smelled at both stores I went to. 

Winter is a scent I smelled the previous couple of years but it never did anything for me. This year it clicked for me though and find myself really enjoying it. Same with Snowflakes and Cashmere. 

Both stores near me had the Chips and Salsa and Pizza and Ranch candles left. Chips and Salsa was pure tangy and gross. Pizza and Ranch is a whole different level of hell. It’s SOUR. And I’m not being overdramatic when I say it smells like vomit. Vomit might actually smell a tad better.  🤢 

All in all this candle day was underwhelming. Probably for the best since I had enough at home already. I’ve burned Winter, Fresh Balsam, and Snowflakes & Cashmere from a previous sale and they performed well. However, I burned Peppermint Sugar Cookie this morning and smelled nothing. It was good on the warmer when I warmed it a couple of days ago for a couple of hours. 🙄 ",10,1765073722.0,bathandbodyworks,1,1.0,False

## **Episode 4: “Reading for Subtext (And Getting It Wrong)”**

**Feat. Dr. Ferro Vane**  
**Feelings Bucket Word: “PARANOIA”**  
(Dr. Ferro Vane immediately corrects the card to “HYPER-AWARENESS”)

---

## **COLD OPEN – Full Cast Musical Unraveling**

A cheery children’s jingle begins on a toy keyboard. It’s too slow. Too happy. The wrong amount of happy.

**LAMB CHOPPED (singing, brittle smile):**  
🎵 *Some people say every story has a message inside…*  
🎵 *Some people say that the author’s trying to hide…*  
🎵 *But sometimes the frog is just… a frog in the rain…*  
🎵 *And your English teacher has… unresolved pain…*

**DJ SKIBIDEESCREE**  
(glitch beat drops, way too loud)

🎛️ *bass drop / dial-up scream / Windows XP error sound*

**DJ SKIBIDEESCREE (singing/rapping):**  
🎵 *You think the curtains are blue ‘cause the writer was SAD*  
🎵 *Maybe they were blue ‘cause that’s the paint that he HAD*  
🎵 *Stop building labyrinths inside a single plain line*  
🎵 *You’re not decoding art — you’re just traumatized online*

**MS. MUTUAL AID (spoken word, monotone affirmations):**  
“Not everything that is unclear is unsafe.  
Not everything that is complex is about you.”

**The Shadow Child** appears behind them, holding cue cards that read:

* “YOU’RE PROJECTING”  
* “THIS IS NOT A CLUE”  
* “STEP AWAY FROM THE THESAURUS”

Suddenly — **a metal clang**. Sparks. A lab light turns on.

**DR. FERRO VANE** stands already there, arms crossed.

**DR. FERRO VANE**  
“This is the problem with your century. Everyone is a detective with no evidence and a podcast about it.”

Music collapses into static.

**TITLE CARD:**  
**“Lamb Chopped’s Play Along – Episode 4: Reading for Subtext (And Getting It Wrong)”**

---

## **SEGMENT 1 – What’s In The Feelings Bucket?**

Lamb reaches into the glittery bucket.

She pulls out:

> **PARANOIA**

Dr. Vane snatches the card.

**DR. FERRO VANE:**  
“Unscientific term. The correct designation is *HYPER-COGNIZANT PATTERN SEEKING WITH A TOUCH OF HUBRIS.*”

**LAMB CHOPPED:**  
“So… paranoia in a lab coat?”

**DR. FERRO VANE:**  
“Respectfully: yes.”

**MS. MUTUAL AID:**  
“And gently: why?”

Beat.

---

## **SEGMENT 2 – “READING FOR SUBTEXT”   CLASSROOM**

A little chalkboard rolls in:

> **TODAY’S LESSON: SOMETIMES A STORY IS JUST A STORY**

**LAMB CHOPPED**  
Now class, what is subtext?

**DJ SKIBIDEESCREE:**  
It’s like the hidden meaning behind the meaning behind the meaning.

**MS. MUTUAL AID:**  
And sometimes… it’s just the meaning you brought with you.

**DR. FERRO VANE (smug):**  
In my era, we called this confirmation bias. And we didn’t romanticize it.

On screen:  
A clip from an old cartoon: a bunny eating a carrot.

**LAMB CHOPPED:**  
What do you see?

**DJ SKIBIDEESCREE:**  
Capitalism.

**MS. MUTUAL AID:**  
An oral fixation.

**SHADOW CHILD (silent):**  
*Crunch.*

**DR. FERRO VANE:**  
It is a rabbit. Consuming a vegetable. End of data.

**LAMB CHOPPED (to camera):**  
Sometimes the meaning isn’t hidden. Sometimes *you* are.

---

## **SEGMENT 3 – THE DR. FERRO VANE INSERT (as if he’s been here forever)**

Old grainy footage plays:

**“Metal Matters with Dr. Ferro Vane”**

**DR. FERRO VANE (1960s broadcast voice):**  
“Ancient metallurgists believed materials had spirits. Absurd. They knew nothing.”

He gestures at a chart of alloys.

**DR. FERRO VANE:**  
“They guessed. We measure. They guessed wrong. We are correct by default.”

**LAMB CHOPPED (voiceover, soft):**  
But weren’t they the first to try?

Pause. Dr. Vane freezes slightly, then continues, louder:

**DR. FERRO VANE:**  
“Trial and error is embarrassing when I exist.”

Suddenly — the power cuts. His tech dies. Silence.

**LAMB CHOPPED (appears in frame):**  
What if you’re not smarter. Just later.

A long, uncomfortable beat.

He doesn’t answer.

The tape glitches out.

---

## **SEGMENT 4 – “Crafts with Cringe: Subtext Edition”**

The cast sits around a table of junk mail, old notes, screenshots, and receipts.

**LAMB CHOPPED:**  
Today’s craft: Making a story out of things that weren’t a story.

They take innocent objects:

* A coffee receipt → “They hate me”  
* A late reply → “They’re plotting”  
* A wrong emoji → “It’s a sign”

The art becomes absurd, deranged conspiracy posters.

**MS. MUTUAL AID:**  
Sometimes your brain isn’t solving a mystery.  
Sometimes it’s just… panicking creatively.

**DJ SKIBIDEESCREE (quiet):**  
…oh.

Everyone pauses.

---

## **DIRECT-TO-CAMERA TRUTH MOMENT**

Lamb steps forward. Close-up. No music.

**LAMB CHOPPED:**

“Trying to read subtext in everything is just another way of trying to feel safe.  
But if you reduce people to puzzles to solve…  
you’ll miss who they really are.

And if you keep trying to solve them…  
you might become the thing they need to be protected from.”

A small, gentle smile.

“Curiosity is care.  
Control is not.”

---

## **FINAL MUSICAL CONFESSION – “Just Let It Be”**

Soft, wobbly lullaby. The others slowly join.

**LAMB CHOPPED (singing):**  
🎵 *Not every silence is a secret kept away*  
🎵 *Not every glance is something you must say*  
🎵 *Sometimes a story doesn’t need a key…*  
🎵 *Sometimes the meaning is setting it free…*

**DJ SKIBIDEESCREE:**  
🎵 *You don’t have to dig for ghosts tonight…*

**MS. MUTUAL AID:**  
🎵 *Some doors are just… closed because it’s night…*

Dr. Ferro Vane stands slightly apart. Then, very quietly, almost ashamed:

**DR. FERRO VANE:**  
🎵 *Sometimes the future shouldn’t judge the past…*  
🎵 *Sometimes the strongest metal… learns to last…*

For the first time, he looks… unsure.

The Shadow Child nods once.

Fade to black.

But when I do break my fast, I feel exhausted and want a nap.

Big mistake, atleast for me.

Seroquel doesn’t just gently ease you off into a sleep, no. The first time I took it, it felt like I was being tranquilized by a heavy duty tranquilizer. I felt systems in my body being forcibly shut down against my will, my breathing became slower and more laboured which caused me to panic, my brain couldn’t make any conscious thoughts. I literally thought I had to go to the hospital. 

I panicked into unconsciousness for 2 weeks. I don’t know why I kept taking it thinking that feeling would go away, it got better but still happens. Today I stop and I was only taking 6.25 to 12.5mg at most. Maybe placebo, but it certainly seemed potent. Most concerning was the breathing issues.

# Freedom Not Free

After freeing the slaves, we negotiated with the merchants. In exchange for the wagons and other gear of the slavers, the merchants would ensure the former slaves were taken care of and set on a path to a new life.

The merchants weren't eager to incur our wrath, many of them having witnessed the destruction of the slaver wagon and the speed at which we dispatched the rest.

It turned out we would be going in the same direction for a while. Their plan was to catch the ferry across the lake as well. Once we were on the other side, they would be going South, trading along the different small towns before returning to where the former slaves could find new homes.

It wasn't until later, when we were sitting around just the three of us, that what happened finally caught up to me.

""I killed. I've never had to kill someone before.""

I began to shake. Nyla held me, not saying anything, just holding me tight.

Skia began to whimper, looking at me with concern.

""Skia, I'll be alright,"" I said, spreading my arms to welcome her into our embrace.

She scooted up on my other side. My two favorite people, comforting me while I comforted them.

After we parted ways with the merchants and former slaves, we continued our trek Northwest. We still had months to go.

**Hollow Ridge**

We were approaching a small town. Our foodstuffs were getting low. We had been hunting and foraging, but we really needed to restock salt and other spices, as well as vegetables that you couldn't forage.

The problem was we didn't have any coin. Having given most of it to the former slaves to help them build new lives, we were broke.

When we entered town, we went to the main Inn and explained our situation, asking if they knew of any work that might need doing.

The Innkeeper was an older woman wearing a clean but tattered apron, her brown hair done up in a bun. Not beautiful, but certainly not ugly. She eyed us with suspicion and said we needed to talk to the Mayor. She pointed to a gray-haired gentleman who was watching us and nodded as we approached.

""I'm Daley, Mayor of Hollow Ridge. How may I help you?"" the older man said.

He continued when he saw the confused look on our faces at the strange name. ""We're quite proud of our town, but we didn't name it. The founders apparently saw a hollow and a ridge and decided to name it after the two landmarks. Long time ago. Nobody's for sure. So what can I do for you young people?""

Nyla bowed her head slightly and explained our situation. ""We're honest travelers. Our supplies are getting low, and so is our coin. We were hoping to find some honest work to replenish our supplies. If you know of anything, we'd be happy to do any kind of labor. We're not picky as long as it's honest.""

The Mayor looked us over. I was still carrying *Chain Breaker* and Nyla carried her sword. Skia was her own weapon, but considering she looked like a Dog-kin, the Mayor only briefly glanced at her.

Turning his attention back to Nyla, he said, ""There is something. If you know how to use those frog stickers."" He gestured to our weapons. ""We are having trouble with a monster, but don't know what kind. It attacks our cattle at night. We're not a wealthy town, so we can't hire a guild to come and take care of it.""

He paused, looking at my Halberd.

""But we can resupply you. And give you a place to bed. We will provide you one meal each and a room here at the Inn you can freshen up in as a down payment of sorts. Tonight, you find the monster and either kill it, or prove it won't be back, and we will fully provision you. Do we have a deal?""

A quick glance at Skia and Nyla confirmed my suspicion that they were glad to take on the work.

I stuck out my hand. ""Deal, Mayor Daley.""

**The Investigation**

After eating and freshening up, we got more information about where the attacks were coming from. All the attacks happened from the East side of the community. We went out and talked to several of the farmers who lost livestock.

It always happened the same way. Late at night, they would lose an animal, a goat or a cow. The next day they would find the animal dead and consumed. Next to the body would be a large pile of rocks. No one had an explanation for the rocks.

Nyla commented, ""Why rocks? And how often is this thing eating? Is this happening daily?""

The farmer told us, ""No, no. It happens once a month, on a moonless night. One animal, one pile of rocks.""

The farmer's son piped up, ""The rocks are payment. The monster doesn't want to steal, so it leaves rocks as payment.""

The farmer said to his son, ""That's not payment. I don't know why it piles rocks, but that's not how you pay.""

The boy looked at his father and said, ""But you're not a monster.""

**Scary**

Later that night as we were patrolling near the edge of the farms, I spoke up.

""I think the boy is right. I don't think the monster, or whatever it is, is just leaving a pile of rocks. It thinks it's paying for the animal. And it's only eating once a month. Doesn't sound like a monster to me. I grew up on a farm not unlike this. These animals are their livelihood. The farmers are going to be upset regardless. But this doesn't seem monstrous to me.""

Nyla agreed, then with a smile she said, ""So were you as bold as that young farmer's son? I bet you were just as cute.""

My face flushed. Fortunately, I was saved from further embarrassment when Skia caught a whiff of something. She started her signature pebble-dancing growl as she looked into the darkness.

""What do you smell, Skia?"" I whispered.

""I don't know. I've never smelt anything quite like this. It's not man. It's not an animal I've ever smelt,"" she said.

Nyla laid her hand on Skia's shoulder. ""Let's not scare it away. How far away do you think it is?""

""Hard to say for sure. I'd guess a quarter of a mile, and it's coming this way,"" Skia confirmed.

""Okay. Why don't you two take up positions to the left and right behind the fence lines? It shouldn't be able to smell us until it's on top of us since we're downwind. I'll be behind that heap.""

The heap was a small hill of broken and discarded items the farmer would be burning during the rainy season.

We took up positions, and within a few minutes saw a large creature walking towards us. It was at least seven feet tall. It had a large rack of antlers on its head. But it was no deer or other natural creature. In the dim light, I could make out its skin tightly pulled over its muscle and bone.

Any farm boy knew what that was the instant they saw it. A Skinwalker.

I hesitated for a second, then jumped out with *Chain Breaker* pointed at the Skinwalker. Nyla had her sword drawn. Skia was baring her teeth. The Skinwalker had nowhere to flee.

**Sweet**

The Skinwalker collapsed to its knees. Even in the dim light, you could make out its crying.

Through the sobs, the Skinwalker said, ""Please just kill me fast. I don't want to suffer.""

I looked at Skia, who was no longer baring her fangs, but tilting her head, looking at the creature. Nyla still held her sword, but now not pointing at the Skinwalker.

""I'm sorry, but why would we kill you?"" I asked the creature. As I stepped closer, I could see it was emaciated. You could see the ribs protruding from its sides.

""Because that's what humans do to Skinwalkers. You kill us. And I'm too hungry and tired to run away. So please just be quick. I beg you.""

""Maybe some humans do, but we don't kill defenseless people. We are here to stop you from stealing the livestock. Not hurt you."" I told her, sympathy evident in my voice.

""People? But I'm not people. I'm a monster,"" she said.

And it was definitely a she. I was close enough now I could see the tears staining her face, the mouth of razor-sharp teeth. The claws on her hands were longer than our fingers. But she had the physique of a woman. A starving woman, but a woman.

I squatted slightly so we would be eye to eye. ""Monsters kill and torment for their own pleasure. All I've seen so far is someone sneaking in the dark to get enough food to last until they can sneak back. I do have a question. Why did you pile the rocks up next to the carcasses?""

""I heard that humans valued rocks. I didn't understand it, but I thought if I gave the rocks they wouldn't be mad at me for eating the animals,"" she said.

""It's true, humans do like rocks. But not all rocks. Different rocks have different value,"" Nyla explained.

As she did, there appeared a look of horror on the Skinwalker's face.

""Please... I didn't know. I was so hungry. I didn't want to take what wasn't mine, but there is no good hunting here,"" she said and began to cry again.

Skia had got close enough that she gently stroked the Skinwalker's shoulder. The Skinwalker flinched at the touch. Skia didn't seem to notice as she simply continued to stroke.

""It's all right. You're not in trouble. No one's going to hurt you.""

The Skinwalker looked hopeful, but said nothing.

Nyla offered, ""We have some rations. Would you like to have something to eat?""

""You would share with me? Really?"" The Skinwalker asked.

""Of course we will,"" I said.

We sat around a small fire, sharing our rations. The Skinwalker, starving, ate everything handed to her.

Skia took a roll and dipped it in honey. ""Try this,"" Skia encouraged.

The look on the Skinwalker's face when the honey touched her tongue... she seemed to beam with joy.

""This is so good. Oh, I've never tasted anything so good.""

Skia said, ""I'm glad you like it. So what is your name?""

The Skinwalker looked at Skia like she had asked ""what is the temperature of your voice.""

""Name? Skinwalkers don't have names. We live solitary lives, only meeting one another to breed. We don't need names.""

Skia said, ""Well, if it's okay with you, I would like to give you a name.""

Skia smiled when she received no objections from the Skinwalker.

""I name you Sweet. Because you are sweet, and you like sweets.""

""Compassion""","\-----------------------------------------------------“Compassion”--------------------------------------------------------

 

It stood tall above it’s compatriots. It’s size was worth three soldiers now walking at it’s side. It’s strength worth ten and speed enough to make horses weep. It was grand and beautiful Lion of Jabir. It’s form like that of a wonderful lion, it’s teeth sharp and unbreakable like it’s faith in love of Allah Most Loving of All. It had mighty Wings now resting, useful for traversing difficult terrains over short distances. It’s eyes were like rubies, it’s mane like the night sky filled with beautiful diamonds as it’s stars. Golden helmet it wore with pride and it’s arms and back were adorned with golden plates depicting important lessons of Allah The Most Wise of All.

They were trampling over the ashes of No Man’s Land. Another mission. Another test by it’s creator adorned with golden armour and a white mask filled with jewels of all colours. Great Alchemist Jawahir. Her strength lied in her intellect that surpassed even that of the Lion itself. It respected it’s creator. It loved Jawahir and would protect her with all it’s might even if she hardly needed such protection due to her expertise in alchemic arts that made any Zindiqs or their terrible masters regret ever stepping in her way.

There were few signs of danger around them so far. Only few minor skirmishes resulting in minor wound to a very skilled Azeb of name Mahir caused by one lucky wretch. Lion once heard a proverb that the greatest swordsman of all should not fear the second best, but the worst and in that moment Mahir had to learn that lesson. Lion knew he would remember. The scar on his shoulder would always remind him. But aside from that it was oddly quiet in No Man’s Land. They weren’t very far from the wall, but the route they took was strangely peaceful. The lion almost considered blinking at one point. Incredible achievement. Something was wrong.

Suddenly he heard a quiet whisper in the wind. A small, delicate sound of distant carnage. Quickly the Lion turned it’s head towards that sound. Other soldiers turned their heads as well, readying their weapons. But then the lion roared once and spoke in a voice that sound like it was made of brass and gold.

“Be at ease. I hear a skirmish in the distance, but it is taking it’s last breath. Coming to an end.” The Lion looks back at the Alchemist who slowly nods and gestures him to move forward. To see the battle’s end “I’ll be as swift as the blade of Alamut.”

And so it moved forward. Ran on it’s for paws with great speed towards the place it heard fighting from. There was a chance there for great treasures to be found and if there was any remaining Zindiqs they would meet a swift end with it’s claws. One dune after another and as it climbed over the wreckage of the Christian machinery it saw it.

It was a bloodbath. A meeting point between three forces. One of them was a group of soldiers who came from the great city of Antioch forever enduring. He saw familiar sights among them. Like the man wearing armour made for tanks. A priest holding unto the wooden cross standing with defiance in the middle of the battlefield. Even in death still embracing it. Mouth of the mas stopped mid prayer. Most honourable of all ends.

Another group was most certainly cause of the carnage. The horrid Zindiqs and their masters. A mask of a witch throwing bombs was lying there shattered, but the craters from it’s bombs were still visible. It most definitely took many lives in this fight both it’s enemies and allies. Terrible soldiers brandishing hellish fetuses, some of which kept crying terrible songs into the sky as they passed on. They were more of those demonic bodies scattered everywhere. He noticed pieces of a War Wolf possibly destroyed by the bomb of a witch. But most captivating piece of this whole tapestry of carnage was the gigantic carcass of what is known as the Sin Eater.

It’s body was huge, but what was curious about it was that it’s head was mostly destroyed. Pieces of it’s helmet were scattered everywhere. Some Zindiq soldiers were dead on it’s stomach, possibly still fighting even once it fell. But what was most curious were the pieces of some kind of vehicle in the place where it’s head should be.

Lion tried to ponder over it, but then he heard something faint and looked over to the side of the third fighting party. This was another group of Christian faith, but one far more devout and zealous than the brave soldiers of Antioch. The ones who scream from Earth to Heaven. Trench Pilgrims as they are known to Antioch. Their bodies mangled, their numbers many, but visibly unprepared for the fight they became a part of.

Among them were bodies of woman clad in helmets, but no chest plate. And odd choice to say the least he found only in few fellow Lions of Jabir. Why did they act like them when their bodies were so fragile and small? Then there was a man in a gasmask and a long whip still held tightly even in death. His body was pierced with a long spear and not far from him a woman with a face still screaming even as there was no more voice. Her hammer lodged itself deep into the heretic, it still stood despite her head being next to her standing corpse.

But then he saw it. The one who kept breathing. Making a sound. It’s body was huge, bloated, contorted. It was powerful, but it’s lower half has been destroyed. It’s blood and guts were slowly seeping out of the creature’s body. It was holding a small silver cross in it’s hand. It’s face had visible scars, but not from the fight. No. There were remains of a cross that was once part of it’s face. Now it was crushed and from the remains the Lion could see eyes in colour of silver almost as pure as the cross this being held. It was breathing heavily.

“Greetings.” Lion said respectfully not really knowing what to do in this situation beyond such simple word

“Wh-wha-” The creature looked at him and suddenly it shielded itself with it’s small cross as it looked away in terror. It spoke with voice both deep like an ocean, but also weak and fragile like a child “L-let thy will be… Thy will be-”

“Do not be afraid.” Lion spoke as it took one step closer “I am no threat to you. I walk the path of faith as well. I walk path of Allah most gracious above all.”

“Wh- Y-you-” for a moment it lowered it’s guard, but then quickly raised it’s arms again “N-no! One true Lord! One God! Not gonna take! Demon! Heretic! NO!”

“Be at ease, I wish you no harm or to disrespect your beliefs.” Lion tried to calm the creature down and for a moment it seemed to work “I am not here to cause you harm. I am not here to hurt you.”

“No?” The creature said weakly as it lowered it’s arms again. There was a small tear running down it’s face “Wh-who you?”

“I am, but a humble servant of Sultan Malik Khan the Second. May Allah keeps him in health and grace.” Lion bowed it’s head and looked at the creature again, it looked very confused which was understandable given the circumstances “And who are you Mighty One.”

“M-me?” It pointed at itself and Lion nodded “G-Grey. Name Grey.”

“Pleasure to meet you Mighty Grey.” Lion answered with all the courtesy this being deserved for having lived through this carnage “What happened here?”

“W-We saw a-a- fight. Bad demon people fight the friends from big city. We help. Me help. Gun Priest he-” Suddenly something shifted in the Grey’s expression and he started to look around feverishly “B-big one dead!? It dead?! Please say. Is it dead!? The big one with scary teeth!” It moved it’s hands above it’s head as if to picture the circular helmet of the Sin Eater. Lion looked back at the giant carcass.

“Yes Grey. It is dead.” Lion said as he looked back and that news made the giant smile for the first time

“Y-yes! GUN PRIEST SIR!” Grey looked back at the rock he was sitting under at the top of it was unmoving man with a piece of cloth over his eyes and a sniper rifle held tightly in an embrace “I threw! It work! It dead! Won! WE WON!” It kept saying and something made the Lion feel a primal need. A need to get closer.

“Mighty Grey” Lion said in a tone gentle like falling leaves “He cannot hear you anymore.”

“…” Grey stopped and for a moment kept staring at the corpse before turning to the Lion again. His eyes looked… defeated “I know.” It started to tremble “I’m alone… All alone.”

“No. Not anymore.” Lion said with an encouraging tone “You… threw something yes?”

“Y-yes. Big monster hit with hammer. It made Grey hit here.” It knocked behind on the rock. Just a gentle knock made few cracks in it “Could not move, but Gun Priest say to throw the big car. Me throw big car when monster scream. Then Priest shoot and BOOM!” It moved it’s hands outwards as if to simulate this event “Boom loud, made not see. Now I see and hear it dead. I did good. Yes? Did I do good?”

“Very good.” Lion nodded “Amazing feat Mighty Grey.”

“Yes!” Grey said happily, but he clearly was getting weaker. He did not seem to realize he was dying. Lion decided to keep him ignorant of the fact. To the best of it’s ability.

“Do you… have a family Grey?” Lion asked, something like this usually helps with those not long from the world “Anyone to call a family?”

“Fa-mi-ly” it sounded like for this being it was almost a foreign concept “No one, but…” Then it looked at the cross in it’s hand again “Sis-ter.” It said slowly “Cla-ra.” It’s grip around the cross became tighter, but it never crushed it “Little. Gave it. Me wanted to help. I became strong! For Clara. I fight for Clara. I pray for…”

“I understand.” Lion tried to be as gentle as possible with it’s words “I pray she is in good health.”

“…” It kept clinging and then looked up “You family have?”

“Me.” Lion seemed surprised to be asked that. Somehow it felt… difficult “I was born alongside another. One could say they are my brother.” Lion somehow felt like it was about to smile even though such concept should be foreign to it “I remember him once telling me of the time they interrogated a merchant over a shipment of coffee.” Lion almost let out a small chuckle from beneath it’s mane “They had sacks of them delivered right to them over the next week. There were so many once we could lay on them like on a bed.”

“Co-feee….” Grey did not seem to grasp this concept very well either “What that?”

“Invigorating beverage.” Lion said as it shook it’s mane “I remember trying it once. It gave me greater focus, but it ruffled my fur like nothing else I ever felt.” It’s wings started to awaken for the first time at the mere memory of that drink “I would not recommend it too often. But it can be of great help.”

“I see” Grey laughed quietly after this story “I…” Then he looked away for a moment and started to shake again and whispered “I’m scared.”

“…” Lion said nothing. It just came closer. It was right above Grey now. He saw just how tightly he was holding the cross. His fingers were bleeding “I can… help Might Grey.”

“How?” Grey asked with little confidence in the Lion’s words

“Me and my brother like to speak poems to each other.” Lion closed it’s eyes to remember better those good times “We are creatures always afraid. Uncertain of our place in this world. Those help us feel more at ease. Help us understand ourselves and this world better.” Lion spoke gently to the giant who seemed to shake a little less now “Do you wish to hear one?”

“… Yes.” Grey answered after some hesitation

“…” Lion took a deep breath and started to remember “But first try closing your eyes. Just for a moment.”

“Okay.” Grey listened and Lion begun

\-

In the place where earth and sea meet is stand.

The water before is both gentle and impossibly grand.

Above me is a sky of blue endless and peaceful.

Below me is sand of gold so soft and beautiful.

The trees sing as the wind caresses their leaves.

And the waves are giving the coast a gentle kiss.

Please speak now the truth to me.

Is this something you can see?

\-

“… Yes.” Grey said in a satisfied tone

“Good. Now open your eyes.” Lion instructed and the giant listened again

\-

I stand here. In a place of victory most true.

A place that could exist thanks to you.

Above is peace and silence

Below is enemies in Hell getting impaled on spires

This is now where you stand victorious

Is this something you see oh most glorious?

\-

“Yes.” Grey said as he looked around and Lion smiled as it saw the joy on his face, but then a shadow crept into Lion’s mind

“When where you born Glorious one?” Lion asked somehow fearing this answer more than any enemy he would meet here

“Old?” It looked at him confused “Me born 19-0-4. Correct. Yes? That answer?”

“…” Lion tried not saying anything, but something within it wanted to weep “Close your eyes again for me. Please.”

“O-okay.”

\-

Here you are on the streets of gold.

Among you walk people both young and old.

There is love. There is laughter.

There is innocence that could never be, before or after.

This is made for you. A moment to smile.

Where there is no place for horror or guile.

If you can please just tell me.

Is it somewhere you can be.

\-

“Yes.” It said with confidence

“Good. Now open them again.” Lion now saw a small tear building in Grey’s eye again, but this one was of joy

“One more. Please.” He clapped as he said it and Lion bowed his head

\-

There is quiet. There is peace.

A moment for you that shall never cease.

No more war. No more strife.

Let it be the happiest moment of your life.

Here you sit. Happy at the end.

Tell me. Can you call me a friend?

\-

“Yes! Friend!” Grey said without hesitation and… it made Lion feel good. “Friend…” It repeated as if to understand what it meant” Never had… friend. I think.”

“I’m sorry to hear that.” Lion looked away in shame

“You.” Suddenly it pointed at him. Or rather at one of the diamonds in his mane “Pretty.”

Lion looked over to the side and with quick motion of it’s claw gave the giant one diamond from it’s mane. Grey said nothing as he took it, but in a quick motion it shoved it into the cross. After a moment it stopped and showed it to the lion. It was a beautiful cross. Now feeling complete with this diamond.

“Cla-ra…” Grey looked mesmerized when he caressed the cross in his hand. Holding it close to his chest

“Mighty Grey I-”

Then Lion saw Grey starting to shake

“So cold.” It must have been close now. It was about to die “So cold.”

Then as if by instinct Lion took off it’s helmet, put it on the ground and lay next to the giant. Close enough so it’s fur was touching it’s flesh and Lion’s wing awakened fully to embrace his body like a blanket.

“Is it better?” Lion’s question was genuine

“Yes. Thank you.” Grey said happily and then looked at the lion again and seemed… surprised “L-Lucien?”

“Excuse me?” Lion turned it’s head towards the giant

“Friend.” Suddenly it started to caress it’s mane “Forgot. So long.” Lion did not hate it, but it felt deep pity “Lucien. I missed you.”

“…” Lion’s mind was in disarray. He could not find right words to say. He was a proud Lion of Jabir, but here he felt so… powerless “Me too. I missed you too.”

“Will you stay?” Grey asked as he kept scratching Lion behind it’s ear “I want to sleep.” He said with an innocent tone “I don’t want to be alone.” Grey sounded tired “No more. Please.”

“Always.” Lion answered surprisingly quickly

And there it lied. The lion who’s claws took lives of hundreds, destroyed mighty demonic machines and creatures now was laying there. Embracing this lonely giant. But for some reason it never wanted it to end. For a moment it felt like… his life was meant for this very moment.

“Ah…” Grey spoke one last time “Cla-ra… there you…”

…

Lion was there for a few more minutes. Even when Grey stopped breathing. It stayed with him. Just to make sure he would not get cold. Finally he wanted to stand up and pushed grey’s face with his leonine snout. He did not move or speak or breathe. He was dead. Gone.

“Gone.” Lion said and felt empty

He looked around and on the edge of this battlefield he saw his group. Jawahir at the front. Looking at him. He felt ashamed. He wasted so much time on this… event. He slowly moved up the dune and stood before Jawahir. He bowed his head. The rest of the group slowly moved down towards the battlefield leaving only him and Jawahir behind.

“I deeply apologize for my most wasteful use of time great alchemist. I promise this situation will neve-”

But then his apology was stopped as Jawahir touched his mane. Lion realized he left his helmet behind on the battlefield next to Grey. He looked at Jawahir. There was not much that could be discerned from the mask, but the light in her eye behind it betrayed… so much genuine joy.

“You are so bright.” Jawahir’s voice sounded like she was about to weep “So beautiful.”

“I…” Lion did not know how to respond, only bowed his head “Thank you great Jawahir.”

As it moved it’s head up again it saw an assassin right behind her. It did not move. Only watched. Was it part of their group? Did it follow them? For what purpose however? Another test perhaps.

“Is something wrong?” Lion looked at her again and when he looked up the assassin was gone. Jawahir did not looked back even once. She must’ve known. So instead he looked down and looked her in the eye.

“I have a request if I may.” He bowed and she nodded with great curiosity in her movement “I wish to bear a name.”

“A name?” She tilted her head to the right “For a Lion to request such thing. What name would you want?”

Lion looked back at the battlefield. At Grey’s body. He felt… free.

“Lucien.” Lion said and did not look back at her “My name is Lucien.”",2,1765073135.0,TrenchCrusade,0,0.75,False

They’re overall pretty decent friends and I enjoy my time with them. But jesus fucking christ they are the messiest people I have ever met and it’s starting to really affect me. They leave dishes that don’t get touched for WEEKS and add to it over time. They leave ground up weed all over the floor and coffee table. They doordash and leave bags all over the house. They almost never sweep or clean the stove unless asked despite it VISUALLY being messy/gross. Me and my partner share a private bathroom, so they share the guest bathroom on the other side of the house. Guests have to use that, my parents when they visit have to use it. When I tell you that bathroom is a hazard, you couldn’t even image. It’s horrific. I can’t walk in there. Today I am feeling sick, dealing with financial troubles, and slept like 4 hours so when I came home to my sink of dishes from the morning that I was going to do, COVERED in sticky, grotesque smelling, blobs of their fucking bong wax (from cleaning it) I lost my shit and threw a dish across the house and broke it lmao. No one was around and I would never do that in front of them/or anyone for that matter. But being alone and being exhausted I just lost it. I get it. They’re clinically depressed (but won’t take meds) and are in their senior year of college. But my god it takes any inch of care to do the most basic fucking pickup. It boggles my mind how anyone can live this way. Especially with roommates. And i’m clinically depressed too, I had my messy days. But acknowledge it and make an effort to be mindful of my roommates and clean any mess over time. I do my best I sweep multiple times a day, I pick up their trash. I do what I can to show I care and to help them accomplish other things. But nothing works. I’ve spoken to them a million times but It’s like i’m asking a brick wall to give a shit. Idk this is our last year together and while i’m sad, I’m a little relieved lmao. Anyways that’s all. I needed one big rant to the world so I can keep my cool around them. Fun fact so; my roommates tossed an old soiled litter box in the backyard and then threw a whole pan that he burnt (you can clean that???) and after the rain that shit is still there and GREEN.

Base Notes: Agarwood, Incense.

Background: I found this brand on olfactoryfactory and the notes seemed interesting, as well as the packaging so I said screw it, it's only $59.

This cologne, is inspired by Fyodor Dostoevsky's ""Notes From The Underground"". This came with a nice black envelope with notes broken down into ""chapters"" and an excerpt from the book it is inspired by

This brand is based in Germany and seems to do liftle to no marketing with bottles not readily avail in US, and I'm not even sure if they're still in business - but there are a few bottles up for grabs on olfactoryfactory.

REVIEW

Scent Profile: Mysterious, Resinous, Smoky + Sweet
Gender: Unisex
Atomizer: 10/10
Longevity: Moderate
Projection: Moderate
Sillage: Strong
Scent Rating: 9/10
Packaging: 10/10
Concentration: EDP
Size: 3.4ML


I was hesitant to try this as it was a blind buy and there's no information on the brand or cologne anywhere but upon first spray I was extremely surprised.

The cannabis at the top mellows out with the brighter green notes, creating a very unique and alluring olfactory splash. The middle is where this thing shines, it's where you begin to smell the resins, tobacco and light roast coffee (and even the incense lingering in the background). The incense + agarwood moves its way further along the drydown and sticks close to your skin at that point.

Overall, Notes from the underground is masterfully blended. So much so, to the point where without a developed nose it is extremely difficult to make out the individual notes. No single note stands out per se, it's just a masterful blend and I think for $59 you can't go wrong.

If I had to compare this to any scent, I would say it's DNA is reminscent of grand soir with more prominent woods, resins, incense and green notes.",4,1765072868.0,fragrance,2,1.0,False

Hey everyone. I’m 33 and born and raised in Michigan. I’ve never really posted here before, but I’m trying to branch out and meet new people to chat with, vibe with, and hopefully build some simple, genuine connections.

A little about me:
I’m big into anything outdoors when the weather’s good like  hiking, kayaking, camping, all that good stuff. Once winter hits though, I fully switch into homebody mode. Give me reading, good coffee, TV show binges, and warm cuddles with the right person and I’m set.

I’m a friendly, laid back guy who can get pretty goofy once I’m comfortable. I love sarcasm and I’m always down for good conversation, whether it’s light, funny, or deeper “talk for hours” type stuff.

If you’re looking for someone to chat with, get to know, share random thoughts with, or just build a chill friendship, feel free to message me.

Looking forward to meeting some new people.",0,1765072194.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.5,False

i had honestly been looking forward to this and BNW didn’t disappoint.

However, as I walked up and down the store shelves, I came across the infamous Ranch, chips and salsa, slushie and coffee(I think)candles. The ranch smells bad was nasty and I put it down. Then I realized I may never see these again and I decided to buy 2 to keep for nostalgic purposes. Yes, the ranch smells exactly like ranch. The slushie smelled okay, the chips and salsa smelled bad too, I set that one down though And got pizza and ranch.

I may go back tomorrow before Candle Day ends. Something about smoked vanilla is appealing and I regret not buying it. I did buy 12 candles all together. I will share photos of those soon.

Seeking a cheeky, creative Catholic woman for eventual life in New Zealand.","I am going to start with the heavy hitter because it’s my core. I am a deeply Catholic man, and my relationship with God is the foundation of who I am. But here is the nuance: I am looking for a partner who understands that Faith and Reason are not enemies.

I want to sit with you and discuss how God exists in the vastness of the cosmos, from quantum mechanics to the multiple dimensions we explore in theoretical physics. I seek someone who sees the wonder in the world, who feels reverence for both the altar and the asteroid. I am looking for a faith that is intellectual, deep, and constantly growing—not blind obedience. If we can grow in our faith together, I will be the happiest man alive.

I know the woman I'm looking for is rare, so I'm casting a wide net. An initial long-distance relationship is welcome. However, please be aware that my home is in New Zealand, and for this to progress into a serious future, you would need to be genuinely open and willing to relocate here eventually.


Who I Am

I am the kind of man who values quality experiences, but I know that possessions aren't the metric of success. I practice kindness daily, striving to be a gentle and supportive partner. I value radical empathy, and I admit when I’m wrong (eventually!).

Who You Are (The ""One"")

While age range is flexible, I'm looking for someone with palpable vibrancy and energy. I am drawn to women whose eyes hold kindness and intelligence—a reflection of the beautiful soul I want to learn to cherish.

You are a Creative: Maybe by trade, maybe just in spirit. You see the world in color.

You are Cheeky: You have a wit about you. You can banter. You don't take yourself too seriously, even though you take your values seriously.

You are Dog Tolerant/Lover: I plan to get a dog (or two) soon, so you must be completely comfortable and supportive of future canine companions. If you're a passionate dog lover, you get priority messaging!

You are Faithful: You have a relationship with God. Ideally, you are Catholic, or at least someone who wants to grow in faith together.

To save us both time, we won't be a match if:

You deny science and reason: I love a good intellectual investigation into the unknown (e.g., UAPs, anomalies, or high-strangeness), but if your theories are anti-science, medically dangerous (like anti-vax), or politically ungrounded (like flat-earth or election denial), we operate in different realities.

You lack empathy: If you are unkind to waitstaff, bullish, or try to isolate people, please move on.

Your politics exclude reason: If you are a Trump supporter or cannot engage in critical reasoning, we aren't a match.

You do drugs/smoke: I live a clean lifestyle and look for the same.

TLDR

I’m looking for the woman who wants to go to Mass with me, grab a coffee afterwards, or perhaps just sit quietly and enjoy the beautiful peace of a Sunday morning together, before debating scientific philosophy and the mysteries of the universe.

If you are a cheeky, faithful, intelligent woman who has been looking for a man who loves God and Science: send me a message. Tell me your take on the intersection of faith and scientific inquiry, and let me know if you’re a fellow Catholic or what your own journey of faith and reason looks like.",0,1765072012.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

When I needed a break from writing, I wrapped all the presents I have at the moment. Three for mother and one for father. I have more set to arrive soon. I also finished up the pleiades painting and I am mostly satisfied with it. The varnish I added made the colours pop but the think light lines I added to the stars were sort of swept away. I'll probably redraw them tomorrow. Aside from that though, I am very happy with the painting. It'll make a lovely back-cover. I wonder if I'll be able to use my own paintings as the cover and back-cover if I traditionally publish? There is a lot I still don't know about the industry. Maybe I can find a subreddit or something for traditional publishers and ask.

Anyway, I am going to relax for the night. I went to bed early and slept in today but I am still more tired than I'd like. Not exhausted, but I'd expect to be more awake right now. Maybe I just need a coffee. I suppose there is one way to find out, isn't there?

While exciting events and monumental achievements certainly have their place, it is often the small, everyday moments that truly enrich our lives. Recognizing the joy in these seemingly mundane experiences can lead to a deeper appreciation for life itself.

https://preview.redd.it/dqiuff8nso5g1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc1a9918bfb141b3f815807c421d3d417ea8f573



Embracing Routine



Ordinary days are often marked by routine, and there’s something incredibly comforting in that predictability. Waking up to the sun filtering through your curtains, sipping a warm cup of coffee, and starting your day with familiar tasks can establish a grounding rhythm. These routines may seem trivial, but they offer a sense of stability and security. Embracing routine not only fosters mindfulness but also allows us to savor each moment without the stress of constant novelty.



Finding Joy in Mundane Tasks



Everyday tasks also hold their own unique beauty. The simple act of cooking a meal, tending to a small garden, or taking a leisurely walk can bring immense satisfaction. These activities may not seem significant at first glance, but they provide an opportunity for mindfulness. Engaging your senses—whether it's the aroma of fresh basil, the vibrant colors of blooming flowers, or the gentle sound of leaves crunching underfoot—can make even the smallest tasks a source of delight.



Through these mundane acts, we can take a moment to disconnect from the chaos of external pressures. Allowing ourselves to focus on the present moment can lead to a peaceful state of mind, fostering gratitude for what we have and the beauty surrounding us.



The Power of Connection



Ordinary days often provide the perfect backdrop for meaningful connections with others. Whether it’s a casual chat with a neighbor or a heartfelt conversation with a friend, these interactions are the threads that weave our social fabric. In a world increasingly dominated by social media, it can be refreshing to cherish face-to-face moments, where genuine emotions and sentiments are shared.



Taking the time to engage with those around us reminds us of our shared humanity. The laughter, support, and camaraderie found in these simple exchanges can create lasting bonds, contributing to our overall happiness and fulfillment.



Nature: The Ever-Present Beauty



One of the greatest gifts of ordinary days is the opportunity to appreciate the beauty of nature. Whether it’s the blooming flowers in spring, the vibrant colors of autumn leaves, or the quiet serenity of a snowy day, nature offers countless moments of wonder. Taking a moment to step outside and truly observe the world around us can provide a refreshing perspective.



Time spent in nature can also serve as a gentle reminder to slow down and breathe. Instead of focusing solely on goals or future endeavors, embracing the present moment can lead to a sense of tranquility and contentment. It encourages us to become more aware of our surroundings, fostering a connection to the world that often goes unnoticed.



The Art of Reflection



As ordinary days unfold, they provide the perfect opportunity for self-reflection. Taking time to journal or simply ponder the day's experiences can cultivate a sense of clarity and purpose. Reflecting on the small joys, challenges, and lessons learned allows us to grow as individuals. Documenting our thoughts can help us appreciate the nuances of everyday life, reinforcing the notion that every experience holds value.



Celebrating the little victories, no matter how insignificant they may seem, strengthens our resilience. Each day offers a blank slate, a fresh chance to approach life with optimism and gratitude.



The beauty of simple and ordinary days lies in their ability to teach us the greatest lessons about mindfulness, connection, and gratitude. By cultivating an appreciation for routine, engaging in mundane tasks, fostering connections with others, cherishing nature, and allowing time for reflection, we can enrich our lives immeasurably.



It is in the ordinary moments that we often find the extraordinary. As we embrace these simple experiences, we can create a life filled with joy, contentment, and an ever-deepening appreciation for the beauty that surrounds us daily. Each day is a gift waiting to be unwrapped, filled with endless possibilities and the potential for joy. Let us celebrate the ordinary, for it is here that the true essence of life resides.",1,1765071804.0,mypersonaldevelopment,0,1.0,False

At 35, I'm finally depressed enough at the life I've created to clean up this shit storm and be better - be as good as I possibly can given the cards I was dealt.

First thing's first.  I am going to clean my apartment and get rid of everything I do not genuinely need - and there is a lot of it.  I'm going to donate as much as possible.  In addition, I am going to buy anything that optimizes my day to day, along with clothes that actually fit and make me feel good.

Beyond that, I'm going to address my body that is constantly in pain and finally see a PT and get into a regular stretching routine, and actually take my yoga practice seriously.  I know I need to learn how to cook actual meals as well so that I'm not putting straight trash into my body on a regular basis.

~~Coffee~~ Tea

~~Fast food~~ Actual meals

~~Chips and pizza~~ Snacks that aren't filled with shit.

..and so on.

Baby steps.  I absolutely do not plan on waking up tomorrow and trying to implement 100 new concepts into my life.  But at the very least I can clean my apartment and eat clean, and then go from there.

Because of this, I am having the most difficult time having a bowel movement, going 4-5 days without a normal size movement. 

My gastroenterologist said do a daily miralax and that has done absolutely nothing. I always have at least 25 g of fiber daily (even before the diagnosis) and minimum 120oz of water. I've been prescribed senna/colace, which only worked a few days. I've done, prunes, hot tea, coffee, dates, milk of magnesia, enemas. I even did the 4 caps of miralax a day and that took over a day to work with minimal results. Nothing is working. 

I do not have a bowel obstruction, a CT was done and it just showed stool at the base of the colon. 

I suspect because of the cyst pressing the colon, the issue is actually inducing colon to have a movement. I have pressure from it right in that area. I'm so bloated and just would like to be back to a daily movement.

She ordered a drink that is meant to be consumed quickly and was too slow to grab it.

For context, a cappuccino at our REAL cafe not starbucks, is 2 shots of espresso and 18 oz of foam with whatever milk they choose. Since the drink is mostly foam it does not hold heat very long, she wanted me to make it somehow be boiling hot when it is MOSTLY foam. Then on her way out complained and said I should have apologized at the very least ( I apologized for not being able to remake it not for her not grabbing it sooner because I called her number MULTIPLE times) and that even if it wasn't sitting there for that long it still would not have been hot enough which it literally was hot when i poured it into the cup she was just too slow to grab it.

I'm not allowed to remake drinks unless there is smth wrong with it, it being cold because they waited is not warranted a remake.

I have a partner, a boyfriend (33m) of just over 10 years. We have a 2 year old together and I have a 12 year old from my previous relationship. He got laid off 2 year ago right before we had out baby, who was a surprise and cryptic pregnancy. He has been unemployed since and I work full time, remote, sometimes overtime for more than 10 hours a day. He has chronic depression that has just gotten worse since hes been laid off. He has lost friends due to our arguments and fighting and he feels excluded by his family like his sister who had her baby a few months after we did. She is always doing things with cousins who aren't actually cousins and going to disney with them and not inviting us while we would ask everytime we would go to Disney if we could all plan to go together. Well its christmas time and in a few months will mark 3 years of unemployment. He got laid off right after his birthday too. He sleeps till noonish every day and on the weekends I admit I will also sleep in because... its the weekend.

Today he had a fit. Lets see... first we live with his grandma who has dementia and she came banging on our door about something but we ignored it because it was literally about her phone and there was nothing wrong with it. So then she went around to the neighbors trying to get them to help her call the police for some reason. Which we have had to deal with before, and the police here (Miami) suck when it comes to dealing with calls from dementia patients. She has a call log on their computers in their cars, its not that hard to look through it before knocking on someone's door. The last officer that came by we had mentioned that a captain told us the officers should check the logs and the officer we told that to was like, ""well i don't do that"" well that's a problem especially if a higher ranked officer told us they should be checking the logs.

Anyway, digressing, we had plans to go to his moms house to help decorate. His uncle dropped his wife there earlier to clean and was gonna pick up grandma. We left before he got there in order to avoid her and any issues with her towards us. We got to his moms house. He ordered Mcdonalds. He didnt order anything for my 12 year old but I was like thats okay I can share or his mom has food there. But no he gave her his burger, complained about not having food even though I told him just to eat. He ate 3 nuggets and slept in his car until a little after his uncle arrived with the grandma. I didn't eat my food, its still in my purse.

Now flash forward, we came home and he refuses to let me feed him and he is sleeping now. The kids are in their room and I am in the office writing this rant. I am not just waiting for him to wake up whenever he does and have another fit over something else. I have already told myself I am sleeping in the office and will get up in the morning to make breakfast and start my sunday cleaning.

Like I said, I have 3 kids... wait 4 if you count grandma. I live off coffee, and redbull.



EDIT: Well now he's having a mental break. He's telling me there is an in-between realm inside of ours and people are trapped there. That no one is as lucky and some honestly crazy mumbo jumbo. I believe in other realms but when you speak about it like no one around you is believing you then it's concerning especially when someone does believe them but wants to just have a conversation and eat.  I got him the same meal he wanted before but larger and he asked to eat alone. So that's where we are now. ",1,1765070900.0,RantAndVentPH,0,1.0,False

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message and introduce yourself !

I'm changing my diet immediately but I still need a little guidance.,"My urine has turned darker in color recently (no red or anything like that, just light-to medium yellow more often than not unless I drink loads of water) - so I decided to go get a blood test.

For context, my liver wasn't great in a blood test I had last year either. But seeing my urine a darker color constantly in the toilet bowl (again no pain, no blood, great amount) had me worried.

urine analysis and comprehensive blood test - Everything is great except for the ALT (which went from 37 to 69) and Triglycerides (which went from 175 to 224). My PCP doesn't have any idea yet because I got this blood test on my own. Quest Diagnostics is really good with this - you pay them a little money and you can get all sorts of blood work done (no insurance needed, I'm not a sponsor or anything just shout out to them).

For breakfast, I'm just going to have organic oats with lactaid milk and a few fruits.

For lunch, probably just tuna with water and some more fruits.

For dinner, I need help from you guys. All I can think of is macaroni and some sort of vegetable. What else can I do here?

I'm trying to stay away from fats altogether.

Also, I take a slew of vitamins once a day - including liver support. I was taking the liver support once a day but I might just start taking it as the bottle says - 2 twice a day.

Question, can I still drink coffee? I used to add creamer but I'm going to try and use my lactaid milk (that is, if I can still drink it.)

My biggest issue is the excercise. I can't really do much outside since its like 20 degrees and the snow's coming any minute. What kind of excercises can I do inside the house?

Any and all reccomendations are welcomed.

Oh and does sleep patterns help? My sleep pattern right now is not good at all.",1,1765070848.0,FattyLiverNAFLD,5,0.67,False

I've never resolder before so if someone could link good videos or something on how to do it that would be great. 

The video port itself seems to be soldered fine maybe it's the capacitors? You can see some yellow almost coffee like stains which I am assuming are leaks.

Cappuccino was the last coffee I made. All drinks r done I call her number (54) at least six times, she was sitting three feet from the front counter where her drinks were. Eventually I give up calling and directly call her out, ""maam ur drinks r ready and have been sitting here for a few minutes"" she says sorry and grabs her drinks. Few minutes later says the cappuccino is cold and she would like a remake. I said ""unfortunately we cannot remake that for you as there is nothing wrong it was just sitting there for a while"" she continues to complain but I literally am not allowed to remake it for it just being cold. She ordered a drink that is meant to be consumed quickly and was too slow to grab it.

For context, a cappuccino at our REAL cafe not starbucks, is 2 shots of espresso and 18 oz of foam with whatever milk they choose. Since the drink is mostly foam it does not hold heat very long, she wanted me to make it somehow be boiling hot when it is MOSTLY foam. Then on her way out complained and said I should have apologized at the very least ( I apologized for not being able to remake it not for her not grabbing it sooner because I called her number MULTIPLE times) and that even if it wasn't sitting there for that long it still would not have been hot enough which it literally was hot when i poured it into the cup she was just too slow to grab it.",1,1765070501.0,AITAH,11,0.6,False

The machine ha PID (shades of coffee), 9 bar spring, manometer, 1 hole steam wand and some accessories like a bottomless portafilter. This seems to be a decent machine if it worked.
