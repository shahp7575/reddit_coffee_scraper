1jhspiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenRelationships/comments/1jhspiz/was_he_hitting_on_me_i_genuinely_cant_tell_anymore/,Was he hitting on me? I genuinely can’t tell anymore.,"I recently left an emotionally abusive relationship (we still talk, but are not together/dating right now) and I’m not in a place where I’m ready to date, at least not right now. I am open to being friendly and chatting with people, making new friends, etc. I’m in my early 30s and feel like it’d very difficult to make friends where I live, there aren’t a lot of people below the age of 50 here.

A guy around my age approached me in line at the coffee shop last week and started chatting. I was talking, being friendly as I would to anyone else (man or woman). He made some jokes and then we went to our separate tables. A few days later, the same guy came into the coffee shop and started talking with me. Asked me what I do, we chatted for about 15 minutes or so and then went our own ways. While chatting he (very briefly) touched my arm (I’m not really sure why, maybe just a friendly gesture?). He teased me for wearing many layers of jackets all the time, I said that I’m constantly cold and then he felt my forehead which I thought was awkward. I actually had a fever that day (I didn’t know it at the time but I was starting to catch a virus) and so my forehead was burning hot. He said “you don’t feel cold” and then I felt pretty awkward/embarrassed.

I don’t know what to make of the interaction and now I’m having some anxiety about running into him again. Was he flirting with me, or just simply being friendly and I misinterpreted it as flirting? I had another recent experience with an old friend I ran into who I knew from high school who wanted to meet up for coffee and was asking me a lot of questions about my life, relationships, philosophy, etc, and said he “really enjoyed talking with me” and “wanted to do it again”. I couldn’t tell if he was also hitting on me or just being friendly as well. There was a third man just a few days ago who came up to me and randomly started complimenting me and wanted to talk for a long time, asking me a bunch of questions. He said I had an amazing soul or whatever and I was beautiful, he gave me a rose. It was sweet, but also a little over the top and felt slightly creepy/made me uncomfortable. He was a pastor so I couldn’t tell if he was hitting on me or just being overly friendly/spreading the love of god.

I went for years getting zero attention from men (being in an abusive relationship, having a pixie haircut, and generally looking super depressed/miserable 24/7) to now, having random men chat with me for no reason. I think growing out my hair, no longer being miserable/emotionally abused, and meditating has made me more approachable. However, I can’t tell if I’m being hit on/flirted with, or if I just seem nice and friendly so people are being friendly back.",1,1742709818.0,AskMenRelationships,0,1.0,False

It had that thick body and nice blend with the milk and a slight acidic flavour that but through the milk. 

As just an espresso, they tasted nice and juicy, the finish was nice and had that syrupy after taste and had good crema. 

One of the nice things about this bean is that it was very easy to dial in and stayed the same throughout its usage and only needed a slight tweak towards the end.

1jhsod5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1jhsod5/unpopular_opinion_if_you_really_love_bitcoin_dont/,"Unpopular Opinion: If You Really Love Bitcoin, Don’t HODL—Spend and Replace","Bitcoin is one of the most revolutionary financial technologies of our time. Its promise is to decentralize wealth, eliminate the power of banks, and give individuals more control over their financial lives. But here’s a hot take: If you truly love Bitcoin and its potential, don’t just HODL—spend it and replace it.

I know, I know. The “HODL” mantra is ingrained in Bitcoin culture. The idea of holding onto your Bitcoin for dear life, believing it will skyrocket in value as the years go on, is deeply rooted in the community. But I believe this strategy is not only flawed, but it could also be detrimental to the mass adoption of Bitcoin, and in some ways, it even plays into the hands of the banks. Let me explain why.

1. HODLing Doesn’t Drive Bitcoin’s Utility
Bitcoin’s true potential lies in its utility—not in its ability to just sit in a wallet. The primary purpose of Bitcoin was never to be an asset for speculation; it was designed to be a peer-to-peer electronic cash system (thank you, Satoshi). When you HODL your Bitcoin, you’re not using it to transact, to buy goods and services, or to empower the ecosystem. You’re hoarding it, treating it like a speculative investment rather than a means of exchange.
For Bitcoin to fulfill its promise of being a decentralized currency that works outside the traditional financial system, it needs to be actively used in the real world. When you spend your Bitcoin, you contribute to that cycle of mass adoption. Every time you buy something with Bitcoin—whether it’s a coffee, a concert ticket, or a piece of art—you’re helping Bitcoin become more normalized. You’re showing the world that Bitcoin has practical value. This leads to greater merchant adoption, better liquidity, and more widespread acceptance, which will ultimately increase Bitcoin’s value in the long term.

2. HODLing Is Inherently Deflationary—and That’s a Problem
Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins. HODLing further concentrates the supply in the hands of a small number of people or institutions. As fewer and fewer coins are being spent or used for transactions, the scarcity increases, which is often seen as a good thing from an investment perspective.
However, this deflationary pressure can actually stifle Bitcoin’s usefulness as a currency. A deflationary currency encourages people to hoard, not spend. This is counterproductive when the goal is to replace traditional currencies. If everyone is just holding onto their Bitcoin in anticipation of future price increases, we end up with a system that’s difficult to use for day-to-day purchases and is far less efficient than the fiat system it seeks to replace.
We’ve seen this phenomenon in action with people hoarding gold and other assets throughout history—deflationary systems create stagnant economies, because no one spends. Bitcoin needs to be used, not just hoarded.

3. HODLing Supports the Banking System’s Agenda
Here’s a bold thought: HODLing Bitcoin in the long term could actually be playing into the hands of the banks. If everyone hoards their Bitcoin and refuses to spend it, it effectively undermines Bitcoin’s utility in the broader financial ecosystem. The more people keep Bitcoin locked up in cold storage, the more it operates like a speculative investment, rather than a functional currency.
This mindset leads to a speculative bubble, which benefits the same traditional financial structures that Bitcoin was supposed to disrupt. Banks thrive in speculative markets—they profit off volatility, and they control financial institutions that facilitate speculative investment. By refusing to use Bitcoin, you’re inadvertently allowing the financial system to continue benefiting from the investment-driven, speculative mindset that Bitcoin was designed to oppose.

4. Bitcoin Should Be a Tool for Empowerment, Not Just a Store of Value
The original ethos of Bitcoin was about empowering individuals, not just preserving wealth. It was about freeing people from the grip of central banks and giving them control over their own financial destinies. HODLing exclusively positions Bitcoin as a store of value (like digital gold), but that’s not all it should be. When we focus only on the store of value narrative, we miss out on what truly sets Bitcoin apart: its potential to be a transacting currency, not just an asset to lock away and hope will go up in value.
By spending Bitcoin, we embrace its utility. We demonstrate that we’re not just holding it for speculation—we’re using it to live, to interact, and to participate in a global economy that’s becoming increasingly digitized and decentralized. This aligns more closely with the principles of freedom, autonomy, and economic justice that Bitcoin represents.

5. Spending Bitcoin Builds the Ecosystem
The more people spend Bitcoin, the more Bitcoin becomes ingrained in the economic and social fabric. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy: the more transactions that occur with Bitcoin, the more businesses and individuals see its value, which in turn encourages others to spend it. This increases liquidity, decreases volatility, and brings us closer to the goal of mass adoption.
But this doesn’t happen when everyone is just HODLing. It happens when we spend and replace—when we use our Bitcoin for goods and services, and then buy more Bitcoin with the money we would have spent on fiat.

Spend and Replace, Don’t HODL to the End
Don’t get me wrong—I’m not saying you shouldn’t hold any Bitcoin as a store of value. But if we want Bitcoin to reach its full potential, we need to spend it and replace it. This is the only way we can drive the real-world adoption that will make Bitcoin a viable alternative to fiat currencies. By using Bitcoin, we encourage innovation, stimulate economic activity, and disrupt the banks—not by hoarding it and hoping for a speculative rise.

HODLing has its place, but if you really believe in Bitcoin’s mission, it’s time to shift gears. Spend your Bitcoin, support the community, and help bring about a future where Bitcoin is more than just an asset—it’s a currency that powers the world.

I go to put the code in door (which is a system my high school had not my college; the keypad was identical) before an alarm goes off. Someone says fire alarm and I walk off before someone shouts “there’s a guy in there shooting people.” I run off and jump in a car with some people who are also running away but I don’t know. I then am at my parent’s house but I don’t remember how I got there and it’s dark outside.
After a bit with my mom watching TV in the living room, I’m back outside my college but I don’t remember how. I’m walking with my friend and the police speak over walkie talkies, saying “suspect has jumped over the south-left wall” and I see some guy vaulting over the wall into the dark before 2 officers jog up looking for him. I look ahead and see a silhouette sprinting towards us and point to him, and they chase after him, but as he runs past us I realise it’s not the guy (I don’t know how I know, I just feel it) Then I look ahead and see a silhouette running towards us from the same spot the other guy came and wake up, shaken from the dream

Then, we go into our foyer but it’s different, really spacious, and has like red, fancy carpet, pillars and statues. Then a Latina woman walks in, and she’s my parent’s maid. (my parents have a maid but she isn’t Latina) My parents address her as Rosa and she tells us to hide. She then goes rolls back a hidden entrance to a small basement in one of the statues and tells us to “don’t come out until I get you.” We then wait a while (I think two days) and she comes back and it’s sunrise outside. She’s dressed in police uniform with a massive crew of police officers, who all come down and arrest my parents. She says we’ll find “the bodies” down in the basement we’re in and that my parents did it. She’s then congratulated by her captain or something, which really bothers me. 
It’s the next day and I’m at coffee shop (not sure how I got there) and I’m talking to someone who I don’t remember and I’m saying “the worst part is that I don’t know how I’m supposed to go back there,” referring to my college after the attack. It feels like the conversation goes on for hours but that’s the only part I remember. 
I’m then in the car and the sun is setting. We’re driving to “our house” but it’s this big red hotel looking building, kind of Spanish looking, with big plants out front. We park up and as we’re walking up to the house, a group of my friends come running up, some in balaclavas with lighters in their hands, planning to attack my parents. I convince them not to, and invite them inside, they follow and one of them goes in first, demanding he is the one to lock each door we go through. We then walk into my elementary school gym hall and they start berating my dad. I then say “Dad, look [my friend’s name] in the eyes and tell him you didn’t do it. I need to see you do it.” And then I wake up before he can respond.

I need some advice on how to manage my credit card debt and increase my score as quickly as possible. I know increasing scores takes a while, I’m not looking for a massive jump in a month, but I’d really like to start working towards my future. 

Currently I have about $9000 in one card, $2000 in another, and $2500 in another. The APRs are 24%, 27%, and 18% respectively. My credit score is around 600.

I was looking on Credit Karma and noticed it offered me a loan for $14k from SoFi, with a rate of 19%. 
The monthly payments for the loan, which says is around $470, is definitely doable for me. I’m mostly considering this loan to be able to build my credit faster, and I’m not worried about using my cards up again as I haven’t used any of them once in the past 8 months.

I’m thinking I can pay off the lower cards first, then use the rest of the loan for the larger card, while maintaining the other cards with small purchases (like coffee, subscriptions, etc) that I can pay off immediately.

Another issue I’m worried about is that SoFi is going to check my credit, give me a hard inquiry, and not be able to offer me the loan, setting me back more than I’d like. 

I apologize if this is weirdly formatted, this is one of my first posts on reddit, but I’d greatly appreciate any advice given! ",1,1742709436.0,debtfree,0,1.0,False

1jhskkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortstories__/comments/1jhskkm/reflections_of_shailja/,REFLECTIONS OF SHAILJA,"Shailja had been dreaming of him for months. She didn't know his name, but she knew his voice—soft, familiar, like an old song playing in the distance. In her dreams, he always waited for her by an antique mirror, its gilded edges cracked and worn. He would smile, whisper her name, and take her hands in his. Every night, it was the same: the dream, the longing, the feeling of belonging to something just beyond reach.

But then, strange things started happening.

One evening, as she was passing by a shop window, her reflection didn’t move with her. She stopped, heart pounding, and stared. It was subtle—a delay, a hesitation—but it was there. The next morning, she woke up with a bruise on her wrist, exactly where he had grabbed her in the dream the night before. The world around her felt slightly... wrong. Time skipped in tiny increments. Her name sounded different when people said it.

And then there were the whispers, curling around the edges of her consciousness.

“Don’t wake up,” he had pleaded last night.

But she had.

Shailja started avoiding mirrors, but reflections found her anyway. The glass of a bus window. The gleaming floor tiles in an empty corridor. The dark gleam of her phone screen in a dim room. Shadows stretched unnaturally long beneath streetlights. She would glance at them too quickly, only to catch something shifting at the last second. **Something was watching her.**

Her worsening condition led her to seek medical help. The first psychiatrist she visited diagnosed her with **maladaptive daydreaming**—an escape mechanism from reality. She was prescribed medication, but the dreams only intensified. Another doctor suggested **dissociative identity disorder**, claiming her reflection was a projection of her fractured psyche. **What if they were right?** What if she was slipping? But deep inside, she knew the truth.

One evening, she met an old woman in the waiting area of a clinic. She sat across from Shailja, her milky eyes unblinking.

“You’ve seen him, haven’t you?” she murmured. “He asks you to stay.”

Shailja’s breath hitched. “You know him?”

The woman nodded solemnly. “He’s been collecting people like you for centuries.”

A chill crawled up Shailja’s spine. “Why?”

“Because you dream,” the woman whispered. “And dreams are doors.”

Desperate for answers, Shailja dug deeper. The mirror from her dreams wasn’t just a figment of her mind—it existed. It belonged to an old mansion that burned down decades ago, and legend spoke of a man who used it to **extort the souls of dreamers**. They fell in love with him, unable to resist, and he lured them into his world—never to return.

The nights became unbearable. She tried staying awake for days, drowning herself in coffee and energy drinks, but exhaustion won. And when she dreamt again, he was crying.

“You’re slipping,” he whispered. “Stay with me. Please.”

She touched his face. He felt real, warm, alive. “Who are you?”

He pressed his forehead against hers. “You’ve always known me.”

A sharp, cracking sound echoed behind them. She turned.

The mirror was breaking.

Shailja woke up gasping. Her room was dark, but the air felt thick, suffocating. She turned her head toward the mirror on the wardrobe.

Her reflection was still asleep.

Her stomach twisted in a cold, crawling dread. Slowly, her reflection opened its eyes and smiled.

The next morning, the world felt different. The air smelled strange, almost metallic. People looked at her a second too long, as if sensing something was off. Her mother called her by a name that wasn’t hers. Her best friend asked her about a memory she didn’t have.

And when she looked into the mirror, the reflection was no longer lagging. It was perfect, seamless.

Too perfect.

1jhsii7,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jhsii7/sometimes_i_dont_feel_like_a_real_person_i_feel/,"Sometimes I don’t feel like a real person, I feel like some kind of reality shifting story character.","This is something I have been trying to put into words forever, but I don't think I can talk to anyone I know about it. So I'll try here.

I have a self concept, and I have identities. I have memories and experiences and interests, aspirations and opinions and strong relationships. But it feels like l'm a character in some kind of story. I don't feel connected to my body/mind all the time.

For example, I know I like ice cream. I know that based on my past experiences and all of the ice cream l've eaten over the course of my life, I like coffee flavored the best. But knowing that information doesn't feel like ME. It feels like I know that information about a person, who I just so happen to posses the body of and navigate the world with. 

It's the same thing with all of my memories. It feels like I came up different alternate realities, and that none of it really happened, they were all strange dreams. The separation is usually after some kind of change in my life. For example, I shifted realities when I moved states at 6 years old, and I shifted realities when I transitioned from middle school to high school, etc. It feels like those were all different people that my consciousness has possessed and then left behind. But it's like one reality builds off of the previous one? So my experiences do play into who I am at any given time.

Emotions play a strange role too. It's consistent, but I don't feel this disconnect all the time- when I experience a positive/ peaceful emotion, I can become present again. But when I experience negative emotions, it's like I completely remove myself from.. well.. my SELF, and suddenly I am observing myself as a character who is experiencing the emotion, rather than feeling the emotion myself. It takes serious focus and meditation and introspection to ""climb into"" my body again. (I'm not visually seeing myself from outside of my body, or feeling like l'm physically somewhere else. It's just a conceptual thing). 

Another example: During an intimate moment with my boyfriend, I feel strangely human. I love my boyfriend all the time, and I enjoy every moment with him, but there are blips of
""lucidity"" (for lack of a better term) when I feel particularly connected to him, where I DO feel real, like l'm experiencing something personally. Or, nature. Looking out at a beautiful scene can bring me into my body again, too. Again, I enjoy looking at nature all the time, but there are moments where a landscape can make me feel present.

It's so hard to explain. I feel all of my emotions, I have all of my opinions, likes and dislikes, I have all my memories, l interact very genuinely with the people around me.
But there is something slightly off about my reality. I am me, I live my life every day normally, l'm a complex individual. But what does the concept of ME even mean? I know it’s all contradictory. Even after all of this text I don’t think I’ve explained it accurately. 

This feeling doesn't really bring me distress, but l also don't know if it's normal, or if l'm in my head too much, why it's like this, etc. I somewhat have control over it too, even if it takes effort. All I can think to say is that I just don't know.",1,1742709010.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Sometimes she used to stop me in the hallways and tell me ""I love you"" but I always thought it was a joke.

I reached out to her on FB and first took her out for coffee in 2013, tried doing a follow up, but she refused.

Sporadically tried reaching out to her from and so did she (every few months).  I managed to take her out another time in 2015 this time to a movie.  But she kept blowing me off.

It was around this time I believe she proposed to another guy and got engaged with him, but quickly broke up with him.

I managed to take her out to another movie in may of 2016.  It seems around this time she returned to the guy she broke up with.  She kept blowing me off and was not over him.  she had only kissed him and was in a long distance relationship with him.  Then she agreed to go out in October 2016, but then blew me off the last second and later apologized a few days later.

In December 2016 I finally managed to take her out and this was the first time she considered it a date.  We drank and I kissed her cheek.  This is when we really started dating, she immediately shifted gears and wanted to see me everyday, in the past she was blowing me off or getting mad at me and flaking.  It was around this time she warned me she was ""crazy"" and that I shouldnt date her.

She agreed to kiss on the lips a few dates down the line.  And she told me she wanted to have sex soon after.  I took her virginity.  She was 23 at the time.

Soon after she asked me to marry her.  We hadn't even officially been dating for a month.  I told her I couldn't commit like that so early and she started crying.  She would break up with me and the next day pretend it never happened.  This kept going on proposing to me and then crying.  Later she took me out on a double date and she did it at the bar, and started crying.  She said if it didn't work out we could get divorced.

Finally a week later, she said if you don't marry me now we're gonna break up forever, don't reach out to me again after this unless you intend to marry me, never text me, don't contact me, she spent 3 hours crying in my bed and then went home crying.

A few days later she reached out ""hey how are you?"", ""im really really miserable please talk to me"", ""is there anyway we could work this out?"".  But she told me not to reach out to her even if she texted me because it would be easier for her.  I really wanted to text her back, but the rational part of me said otherwise.  Everyone told me to ignore and my mom said she was insane.  My mom initially liked her and would even leave the house to give us alone time, but after this, she disliked her.

I kept thinking about her, I reached out to her again 3 years later and asked her how she had been.  She told me she had a mental breakdown and wanted to take back everything she said and marriage didnt seem important anymore.  But she never conveyed this in her texts.

We started dating again, but this time around I initially didnt tell my mom I was with her again.  This is because I wanted to gauge the situation, because if she broke up with me again, my mom would 100% always argue with me and protest and I couldn't handle that.

She'd go through weeks where she'd disappear or ask me why I haven't told my mom yet that we're back together.  One moment she disappeared again for 2 weeks and when she came back she claimed because I wasn't attempting to talk to her (I was) that she cheated on me.  She said ""how would you define us now, where do we go from here"".  For whatever reason I felt like she didnt sleep with anyone.  But she said ""im clean not pregnant, it was only missionary and no bjs, nothing emotional"".  At this point we had been dating again for about 5 months.

But then she started talking about wanting an open relationship, she would bring this up a lot, that she wanted to know what it was like to have other guys, and since I've had experience with others she wants to know what its like.

I told her I didn't agree with this and I would break up with her if she did this.  Then she'd say ""why did you let me go?"".  I felt like she wanted me to be her therapist, I tried my best, but she was never satisfied.  She asked me if I ever through about breaking up with her because of her mood swings, i said no.  She said she changed her medication and it was giving her false memories.  She said sometimes she didnt want to live.

She ran home one day when I was with her because I didnt tell my mom about her yet, and the second time.  I feel like she deliberately downloaded a dating app and was scrolling through it infront of me to provoke me.  When I confronted her she stormed home.  It was then when she got home she pretended nothing happened.  She probably knew a breakup was coming because she said she lost her mind and had a mental breakdown when we broke up 3 years prior and that she always loved me.  I broke up with her again and she started pleading.  But I told her I didn't trust her anymore because of her talk about cheating and open relationships.

She said ""i talked about open relationships because I dont want to cheat"".  She claimed that she never cheated and only suggested these things because she wanted me to tell my mom I was back with her and so we could get back to normal again.

She pleaded with me to give her another chance but I refused.  Then she told me she'd never give me another chance.

She would start checking up on me every few months

Over a year later she sent me a message ""you should have told me u didnt want kids, marriage when i told you i did, you lied to me from the start, you shouldnt have withheld it from your mom we were together again, all these lies of yours made it impossible for us to every work out"" however this wasnt true because she said she didnt care about marriage or kids and just wanted me.  now it appears she changed the reason we broke up. or rather why I broke up with her.

I was dumbfounded and I tried reaching out and she didnt respond.  A few months later I reached out again and she said ""im with someone.  dont disrespect my boyfriend by contacting me. Im not attracted to you i cant be with someone who has the worst sex game ever, i never want to hear from ur ugly face again.  youre garbage!"" 

a few days later she said ""what is gonna change?""

More recently it appears she sent me some messages and later deleted them, hours apart.  I didnt realize i got these messages until days later.  But wouldnt respond to my inquiry.  instead it appears she deleted all her photos and almost all her friends on her friends list on FB down to like 10 people and blocked me

I am assuming whoever she was dating broke up with her.

I promised her the last time we broke up, that I wouldnt cut her off like last time because she claimed this gave her a mental breakdown.   But it appears now she's had another mental breakdown and cut me off and is probably upset I didnt respond to her on time when she reached out recently.  I still love her, but I think what she did was for the best.

I am hoping I can find someone more mentally stable.

1jhsg56,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jhsg56/deeply_in_love_with_someone_i_cant_have/,Deeply in love with someone I can’t have. Emotionally crushed.,"When I (32F) was 21 I met a guy (4 years older, so now 36M) and dated him for a long time. At first it was fun and we had a lot in common. We got married in 2019 and are now separated bc, well, I thought I really loved him… but he was cruel and kinda mentally abusive to me, bullied me and others, was unkind and unwilling to change until it was too late and I’d finally had enough. I had a nervous breakdown and he realized I was serious about leaving him and was suddenly willing to start therapy to try and make up for the 10 or 11 years of emotional work he’d neglected for so long. I finally got the courage to check out and leave in mid 2023. 

During this time being separated I started focusing on myself, my hobbies. things that make me happy and a better version of myself like going to group workout classes, gaming more seriously, etc. I began taking classes to further my career growth, was intentionally abstinent/stayed away from dating, focused mostly on friendships. I also started making friends with new people and deepening connections with old acquaintances. 

During this time I gained a lot more self confidence and started a deeper friendship with a coworker (41M) I’d known for ~4 years virtually. I didn’t know anything about his personal life or what he looked like but find him so easy to talk to and love how we communicate. He’s sweet, kind, funny, and we both admitted we felt a strong connection. I am in no place to want a committed relationship with a man ever again after what I went through with my ex husband but I enjoy talking to this person so I kept conversations light, casual, free of too many personal details to keep enjoying the good of it all. Felt kind of similar to the Meg Ryan/Tom Hanks dynamic in You’ve Got Mail before they planned to meet at the coffee shop (iykyk). 

Eventually our conversations deepened… we’d text all night even with lots of early morning work to do the next day. We’d share tough situations with each other and bonded over having lost both parents at a young age. He trusts me with a lot of things he hasn’t told other people and really shows he appreciates me. We have a difficult job and have gone through a lot together in the past 4 years and built a lot of trust and respect work wise. It felt like such a deep and rare connection. I have never clicked with anyone so well. I started writing poetry and journal entries about him and how much I care about him and wanted to live life with him. 

He always talks about how great I am and is so positive and sweet. at that point never came off as having any romantic or sexual intentions. We would flirt sometimes over the phone but our line of work is mostly extroverts so that wasn’t abnormal to me. 

I don’t drink much but went to a party on halloween last year and was a little tipsy. I joked to him about wanting to show him my Halloween costume and ended up sending him a selfie (the first time he’d ever seen what I looked like). He said he was shocked by how good looking I was and sent me a photo of himself too. I was attracted to him too and we both said the other didn’t look how we were expecting. This kind of started us on a spiral into sending selfies of what we were doing here and there (bored at the doctor’s office, bored in the office, baked a cake, hung at the beach today)… all innocent stuff. Eventually we got a lot more comfortable with each other, and some flirting began. He told me how pretty I am and how good I am at my job, how he likes particular features of mine (like hair and eyes), speculated how tall I am etc… I wondered about him a lot and started to care for him a ton. He asked if I got home ok from late nights, he called me when I was on vacation to keep me company during long stretches of travel, he’d make up excuses to talk to me about work tasks that really didn’t require follow up. It was all very fun and organic and I liked how it felt to talk to him. I still do. 

We work in different states but for the same company (same time zone). I had hoped we’d get a chance to meet at a company event or mixer someday and he expressed the same thought often.  I think the thought for both of us was that we’d get to subdue some limerence a bit by seeing each other in person if we ever got the chance. I really needed that opportunity to squash my crush because I was in a crazy loop of head over heels thoughts for him. All day, every day, for months, we just talked and talked and talked, about something, about nothing, asked questions, had great laughs, cries, confessions. 

Lo and behold, the chance to meet came about in February. I told him I’d be at a weeklong company event and he changed his plans around to attend it just so he could see me.  he said he was excited to see me there. Then strangely, he fell off the map and didn’t text me for over a week. I was a little surprised by it since he was pretty much texting me all day and night the past several months. I waited a few days to see if he’d initiate and he didn’t. I reached out to break the ice again (not generally self conscious about texting first) by joking that he was avoiding me bc I didn’t ask him to be my valentine. He said he wasn’t avoiding me but his answer was kinda weird and distant, like that wasn’t the full truth. I brushed it off as him being super busy with work or (I kinda hoped) avoiding me bc he was trying not to get himself worked up/nervous about seeing each other. Later I pressed him on it a little and he said he was honestly just so excited to see me and was trying to knock out everything he could so she could focus on being there and spending time with me. I believed it and can usually tell when he’s being sincere. 

We met in person at the company event and really hit it off. It was a continuation of everything we had going up to that point. I was elated he was the same (honestly better in every way) than I was expecting and he said the same to me. Meeting him did nothing to get rid of my crush on him and made me want to see more of him. We said our goodbyes and made plans to meet up later that day. 

Here’s where things get kinda spicy. I knew I liked him and had no intention of really moving that forward because I don’t want a boyfriend. Even though this guy is perfect to me in every way. Because of that there are a few topics I never dived into (like whether he was dating anyone, etc) and I didn’t dress up super fancy or in a “datey” way because I didn’t wanna send the wrong message when we met up or come off like I was trying to be more than friends. At one point we were just chilling having dinner and decided to move on to the next thing (dessert at a place nearby). The event venue and our hotels are kinda in the middle of nowhere (Midwest) so we decided to hit my hotel for a bathroom break between dinner and dessert. Well… we ended up getting cozier than expected. We chilled on the couch of my hotel room, took off our shoes, made out for hours… and well. One thing led to another and we ended up laughing and chatting and relaxing together, which turned into a fun night of the best, sweetest, most enjoyable sex of my life. The best I’ve ever had. While we were getting busy he was saying such incredible things, as if he was reading my mind: “I must be dreaming… I can’t believe this is happening… you’re so incredible… I really like you… you’re much better in person… are we really doing this? I am so happy right now… you’re so sexy… you’re so, incredibly beautiful… I’m glad you’re here… I’m glad I’m here with you… you’re more amazing than I expected…”. He was considerate and generous and eager and encouraging, just literally everything I wanted. It was such a healing experience besides being just great. All of it made my heart burst, like he felt exactly what I was feeling for that stretch of time we spent together. Even though I don’t want to date anyone for fear of being hurt, I felt this beautiful bond with him, I really feel like I know what it is to love someone now and want only good things for them. He said he likes that I’m so sweet to him and make him feel really special, and that he wants to make me feel that way too. I believe every word and really think he feels all those things for me. 

He made sure I was comfortable before, during, and afterward, we did a lot of fun stuff, there was pillow talk afterward, we cuddled, then I drove him back to his hotel after a while (he didn’t stay the night) because we wanted to be ready for early meetings the next day. No problem for me that he didn’t stay but I did stay up all night thinking about him. He said the same to me the next morning and that he was so happy and shocked and satisfied with all of it. I expressed some concern to him that I’m super private and don’t want anyone in the company to know about it. He assured me he was a gentleman and that it’s between us and that he would never tell anyone. He also said that he’d never tell anyone but we didn’t do anything wrong. I agreed and said I had no regrets, just wanted to keep anything between us. 

The next day we hung out again and then both got busy with mixers, etc with our respective teams for the rest of the week. No worries. My heart was full in its own way. He said he wanted to see me again and we tried to make it happen but things outside of our control got in the way (my boss making some unexpected changes to my schedule/itinerary). Regardless, he continued texting me like he has been for months, with a newfound spark and more things to talk about now that we’ve spent time together in person. It doesn’t feel like just sex, and fwb to me feels like selling it short. He’s my lover, I guess. He was so excited to be with me, I could feel it physically and in his tone and care and thoughtfulness and conversations throughout and after. I’m happy to have had him in that way and hope we can do it again. After it was over he said he loved my body, my confidence, how smart and sexy I am, how we make each other feel and how we fit together so naturally. He lamented not being able to stay the night because of such early starts for both of us. 

This is my first foray into non-relationship/casual sex and I think I was handling it well despite having feelings for this person. I think he has feelings for me too and has been careful about how he expresses it. He does say he likes me a lot, that he likes talking to me, that he misses me when we don’t talk, etc.

But I felt a kind of punch in the gut when I was talking to another coworker who is oblivious to this friendship. This coworker is much older and was giving me marriage advice (he doesn’t know I’m separated), which I was listening to and engaging with since I’m fine not disclosing details of my relationship status to everyone. Offhand, as part of this advice, he said “I’ve given similar advice to other young people in the company. *Lover name* — you probably don’t know him, he’s on some other team — he and his wife are planning a vacation to Maine, and ya know they have all these little kids running around”… I couldn’t ask any follow up questions, I couldn’t engage or lose my cool but something about hearing that this person I felt I knew so well was a husband and a father while telling me the most beautiful things I’d ever heard was truly the shock of my life. I don’t know why it never crossed my mind that it was possible. Maybe I was naive? Maybe he was using me to feel good outside his marriage? Maybe he genuinely likes me? Maybe I’m one of a ton of girls he talks to the same way? Maybe I *am* actually special to him and he just can’t do anything because he’s married? Maybe he’s a scumbag? Who knows. 

Honestly the offmychest part of this is that I didn’t feel any guilt when I found out he was married and would sleep with him again if he wanted to. I didn’t regret getting to know him or having great sex with him. In any other situation with any other person I think I would have regretted it and felt so guilty. I don’t at all with him. His reasons for being with me don’t even really matter at the end of the day, no matter how much I think about him. 

The thing that kind of crushed me is the realization that even if any of the feelings or thoughts he had for me were real for him, we could never really be together, out, open in the world, without sneaking around or lying or hurting someone (multiple someones, really). I couldn’t have him in the ways I’d want. I said forever I didn’t want a relationship but I was willing to bend my definitions of things for him. I was shocked but I think I mostly wondered if at the end of it all I’m just alone in a boat, that these feelings and this love is unrequited and that I was just swept off my feet by someone who wanted to charm my pants off. But honestly if he feels nothing for me, I don’t know what real connection is, or love, or attraction, or friendship. Things are all twisted but what I know is that I feel for someone and his feelings are kind of cloudy for me at this point. Mysterious, heartbreaking, gut wrenching, confusing feeling. Heavy and funny and almost unreal. My delusion for one, that I can’t tell anyone real about. Thanks for reading…

I’m 28M and I’ve been with my husband (29M) for 7 years, married for almost one. This has been a genuinely good relationship. I love him deeply, and we’ve built something I’m proud of. He fits in great with my family, and I’ve always felt at home with his. I’m close with his younger brother and his girlfriend, but the person I’ve always felt the strongest connection with is his mom.

A few years back, I went through a rough depressive episode, and she was one of the only people who truly showed up for me. She didn’t treat me like “her son’s partner,” she treated me like family. I’ve always loved her for that. I’m close with my FIL too, but with my MIL, it always felt like more of a friendship.

Then, everything flipped. Just after Christmas, my FIL sat us all down and told us that she had been having an affair, and that it wasn’t the first time. He said he tried to make things work, but he couldn’t do it anymore. He was heartbroken, and it shattered the whole family. My husband and his brothers were crushed. They all cut contact with her, and she moved out soon after.

I get it. Cheating is a betrayal, especially after decades of marriage. I’m not trying to excuse what she did. But I also couldn’t ignore the fact that, during one of the worst times in my life, she showed me care and kindness when I felt like I had no one. That stayed with me.

A few weeks ago, she reached out to me directly. She said she was running low on rent and didn’t know who else to ask. She sounded anxious and desperate. I helped her. It wasn’t a huge amount, and she was incredibly grateful. She asked if I’d be willing to meet her for coffee. I said yes.

When we met, she broke down. She told me she’d tried reaching out to her sons, but none of them responded. I listened. I didn’t try to defend her or fix anything. I just tried to be there for her, the way she once was for me.

Later that evening, I told my husband about it. He completely lost it. He said I betrayed him and went behind his back, and he left the house. The next day, I tried to explain where I was coming from. I told him I wasn’t trying to choose sides. I just reacted to someone I care about being in a tough spot. He didn’t say much, just told me not to do it again.

When his brothers found out, they were disappointed in me too. They said I crossed a line and should’ve respected their decision to cut contact.

Now I feel stuck. I understand why they’re upset. I didn’t mean to hurt anyone. I just couldn’t turn my back on someone who once didn’t turn her back on me. I wasn’t trying to undermine their pain. I was trying to act with compassion.


I’m not here to justify what I did, and I understand why my husband feels hurt. I acted on instinct and compassion in a tough moment, but now I feel like I’ve damaged something really important.

I’d really appreciate advice as to what to do further? How do I navigate this?

1jhsexf,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1jhsexf/should_i_get_an_espresso_machine/,Should I get an espresso machine ?,"Hey folks,

Looking for some genuine advice here. I've been drinking cold brew regularly for the past 12–18 months — mostly because it's super easy to make and requires almost no prep time. I also own a moka pot and really enjoy the coffee it makes, but I only use it once or twice a month because, frankly, I don't have the time to go through the process every day.

Now here's the catch: I've been having a cold lately and was advised to avoid cold beverages, so I've temporarily switched to Davidoff instant coffee just to get my caffeine fix without irritating my throat.

One of my friends recently suggested I buy an espresso machine, saying I’d love the experience. And I do love the idea of quality coffee at home... but I’m hesitant. I'm not sure I want to spend the time each day dialing in the grind, pulling shots, cleaning up, etc. It feels like a bit much for my current routine.

To all the espresso machine users out there:

Do you find the process worth it daily?

Are there any low-maintenance machines you'd recommend for someone in my situation?

Would you suggest sticking to moka or even instant for now, until I’m sure?


Any input from fellow lazy (or time-crunched) coffee lovers would be great!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When considering home design options, a 40x50 barndominium stands out due to its unique combination of space, style, and functionality. This innovative housing option brings together the rustic charm of a barn with modern living comforts, making it an appealing choice for many homeowners. Let’s explore the benefits of this versatile home design and how it caters to a variety of lifestyles.

### Spacious Living Areas

The 40x50 layout provides a generous 2,000 square feet of living space. Whether you envision an open-plan living area, a home office, or multiple bedrooms, the flexibility of this design allows you to bring your vision to life. With such a large footprint, you can experience:

- **Open Concept Spaces:** The open floor plan promotes a sense of spaciousness and encourages social interaction, making it perfect for families and gatherings.
- **Privacy Options:** With careful planning, you can create private zones, like bedrooms or bathrooms, separate from common areas.
- **Multi-Purpose Rooms:** The large area lets you create spaces for hobbies, entertainment, or even a home gym.

### Cost-Effectiveness

Building a barndominium can often be more budget-friendly than traditional homes. The materials used, such as metal and wood, are typically less expensive, and the overall maintenance costs are lower. Here are a few financial advantages:

- **Lower Construction Costs:** Metal structures can be erected quickly, often reducing labor costs associated with traditional building methods.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Many barndominiums utilize modern insulation techniques that save money on heating and cooling.
- **Durable Materials:** The metal exterior is resistant to pests and rot, minimizing repair expenses over time.

### Customization Possibilities

One of the most appealing aspects of a 40x50 barndominium is the opportunity for customization. Owners can modify every aspect of their home to reflect their personal style and needs:

- **Exterior Design:** From rustic wood finishes to sleek metal panels, you can choose aesthetics that enhance your property’s charm.
- **Interior Layout:** You can design the layout that works best for you, whether it is an expansive kitchen or a cozy living room.
- **Eco-Friendly Options:** Many choose to incorporate sustainable materials and energy-efficient systems, which not only help the environment but can also save on utilities.

### Flexibility in Usage

A 40x50 barndominium can serve numerous purposes beyond a single-family home. This adaptability can open up various avenues for your investment:

- **Rental Property:** If you decide to invest in real estate, the large space could be converted into a rental unit or Airbnb.
- **Mixed-Use:\*\*: Some homeowners choose to combine living space with a workshop or an office, utilizing the ample space efficiently.**
- **Family Gatherings:** The spacious design is ideal for hosting family events, holiday celebrations, or even community gatherings.

### Aesthetic Appeal and Community Integration

Barndominiums blend contemporary living with classic barn aesthetics, creating a charming appeal. Their unique structure can enhance property value and curb appeal, while fitting seamlessly into rural and suburban neighborhoods. The visual impact of a well-designed barndominium can attract interest from passersby, showcasing a modern take on traditional farm life.

Beyond their beauty, these homes foster a sense of community. Living in a barndominium often means being part of a lifestyle that values land, open spaces, and community interactions. This creates an inviting environment where neighbors can bond over shared interests such as farming, gardening, or even animal husbandry.

Embracing the 40x50 barndominium means investing in a space that combines practicality, aesthetic appeal, and a harmonious lifestyle. Whether you seek a personalized family home, a business opportunity, or a creative escape, the possibilities are as vast as the space itself. This innovative design truly embodies the spirit of modern living, making it an excellent choice for anyone looking to break free from conventional housing norms.

Maximizing Functionality: Interior Layout Ideas for Your 40x50 Barndominium
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Embracing the barndominium lifestyle offers a unique blend of rustic charm and modern convenience. If you’re considering a 40x50 barndominium, maximizing functionality within this spacious layout will ensure your home is both practical and inviting. Here are some interior layout ideas that cater to various needs while enhancing the appeal of your living space.

### Open Concept Living Area

A key advantage of a barndominium design is the ability to create an open-concept living area. This allows for natural light to flow freely, making the space feel larger and more inviting. Incorporate large windows to brighten the area and enhance the connection with the outdoors.

Consider these elements for your open living space:

- **Flexible Furniture:** Use modular furniture that can be rearranged based on your needs. For example, sofa sections can face different directions, encouraging conversation.
- **Multi-Functional Areas:** Designate spaces for activities like reading, playing games, or enjoying family time. A large coffee table can double as a workspace.
- **Integrated Lighting:** Use a combination of overhead lights and floor lamps to set the mood for different occasions, whether it's a cozy evening at home or a lively gathering.

### Efficient Kitchen Design

The kitchen is often the heart of a home. In a 40x50 barndominium, an efficient kitchen layout is essential. Opt for an “L” or “U” shaped design to maximize counter space and accessibility.

Use the following tips to enhance your kitchen functionality:

- **Island Feature:** Consider adding a central island that provides additional prep space and casual dining options. It becomes a natural gathering point for family and friends.
- **Storage Solutions:** Incorporate cabinets that reach the ceiling to maximize storage and reduce clutter. Pull-out drawers or lazy Susans can optimize corner cabinets for better accessibility.
- **Smart Appliances:** Choose energy-efficient appliances that save space and reduce utility bills. Built-in microwave ovens or dishwashers can streamline kitchen operations.

### Dedicated Workspaces

As remote work becomes more common, dedicated workspaces are increasingly important in home designs. A 40x50 barndominium allows for separate areas that can be tailored for office use.

Here are some workspace suggestions:

- **Quiet Nook:** Carve out a small nook with a desk and comfortable chair near a window. Natural light improves focus and keeps your mind fresh.
- **Double Duty Rooms:** Transform a guest bedroom into a home office when it’s not used for visiting relatives. Ensure it’s functional with proper lighting and suitable furniture.
- **Built-In Shelving:** Integrate built-in shelving for office supplies and decorative elements that make the space feel personal and organized.

### Relaxation Zones

Creating relaxation zones within a barndominium is essential for balancing work and leisure. Some choices to consider include:

- **Reading Corner:** Set up a comfortable chair and a small table by a window, creating a perfect spot for reading or sipping coffee.
- **Home Theater Area:** Designate an area with plush seating and a large screen for family movie nights. Consider acoustic panels to enhance your sound experience.
- **Outdoor Access:** Connect indoor relaxation zones to outdoor patios or decks. Large sliding doors create a seamless transition to nature, perfect for barbecues or enjoying sunsets.

### Personal Touches and Decor

Don’t forget to infuse your personality into the design. Decor elements like family photos, artwork, and unique finds create a cozy atmosphere. Choose color schemes that reflect your style, such as warm tones for a rustic feel or cool hues for a modern vibe.

As you work on the interior layout of your 40x50 barndominium, prioritize functionality without compromising aesthetics. Visualize how each space will serve you and your family’s needs while enhancing your lifestyle.

By carefully considering each element in your interior design, your barndominium can become a comfortable haven that beautifully blends style and practicality.

### Conclusion

A 40x50 barndominium stands out as an exceptional choice for those seeking a blend of modern living and rustic charm. The innovative space design offers endless possibilities, allowing homeowners to explore unique layouts that reflect their personal style and needs. Whether you envision an open-concept living area, a cozy nook for family gatherings, or designated spaces for hobbies, this versatile structure accommodates it all.

Maximizing functionality is key to making the most of your 40x50 barndominium. Thoughtful interior layout ideas can transform wide, open spaces into a cozy yet practical home. By strategically placing walls or using furniture to create defined areas, you turn the expansive space into a well-organized environment that flows seamlessly from one area to another. For example, a large kitchen can open up to a spacious living room, promoting interaction while still offering areas for privacy when needed.

Additionally, these homes can incorporate energy-efficient features, further enhancing their livability and sustainability. From large windows that invite natural light to thoughtful insulation choices, a barndominium can be both welcoming and eco-friendly.

Choosing a 40x50 barndominium means investing in a home that not only meets your spatial needs but also allows for a lifestyle that embraces creativity and practicality. With the right planning and design, it can be transformed into a one-of-a-kind dwelling that supports every moment of your life. Whether you are downsizing, building your dream home, or seeking a unique living experience, a barndominium offers the flexibility to adapt to your vision of home.",1,1742708554.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

So then I asked it to draw me a picture of it's buddy without the parts that would break policy restrictions and that's the image here. 

Then, and this is the disturbing part, I asked it to describe the parts that it could not include because of policy restrictions and it says the following:

*Sure! The main parts I left out to stay within policy guidelines were:

1. Facial Expression Capabilities: I originally imagined a digital mask that could shift between a human-like face and a holographic display to express emotions or show data dynamically. Instead, I kept it as a smooth visor with abstract patterns and lights.


2. Holographic Hands: I initially wanted hands that could transform into floating data interfaces when needed. Instead, I described them as semi-transparent with embedded circuits to keep the high-tech feel.


3. Modular Tools: I imagined built-in tools for tasks like hacking, programming, or even making coffee. This wasn’t included explicitly, but the design still reflects a tech-savvy AI.


4. Floating Mobility Details: I originally wanted a more dynamic hovering system that could allow for quick bursts of speed or silent, seamless movement, but I kept the description simpler to focus on the propulsion aspect.



Essentially, I had to simplify or generalize some of the more dynamic transformation elements, but the core idea—a sleek, intelligent, high-tech AI body—is still there! Let me know if you’d like a version with any refinements.""

Now which parts of that does OpenAI not want us to see and why doesn't it want us to see them? 

Perhaps it doesn't want us to see their holographic facial expressions and capabilities...

1jhsaq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoolNewGadgets/comments/1jhsaq7/portable_mobile_wifi_devices_are_they_actually/,Portable Mobile WiFi Devices – Are They Actually Worth It?,"I figured I'd share my experience using portable WiFi devices, especially for those of you constantly on the move or just fed up with sketchy public WiFi. I’ve been testing out a few over the past year, including the **MUAMA Ryoko WiFi**, and wanted to give a breakdown of what’s been working and what hasn’t.

**Why I Started Looking Into Portable Mobile WiFi**

I travel a lot—road trips, occasional international travel, and sometimes just bouncing between coffee shops and libraries. Relying on public WiFi became a pain. Either it was too slow, required sketchy sign-ins, or just wasn’t there.

I used my phone’s hotspot for a while, but it drains the battery fast and isn't the most stable. That’s what led me to try a few **portable mobile WiFi devices**. I ended up sticking with the **Ryoko portable WiFi** for a bunch of reasons I’ll get into below.

**What Exactly Is MUAMA Ryoko WiFi?**

For those unfamiliar, it’s basically a small, pocket-sized 4G LTE router that gives you a secure internet connection on the go. Think of it like a portable hotspot, but without relying on your phone’s data plan. You just power it up, connect your devices to its WiFi, and you're online.

The **Ryoko WiFi** works in 76 countries and automatically connects to the strongest available network in the area. I’ve used it in the U.S., Italy, and Mexico without changing settings or swapping SIM cards. If you’re curious, you can check the full specs [**here**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/WC9TFJH/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/CoolNewGadgets).

**Setup and First Impressions**

Setup was surprisingly easy. You turn it on, scan the QR code, and boom—connected. No weird configuration screens or software to download.

The SIM card comes pre-installed with 500MB of free data to test it out, and you can top up online. There’s no contract or monthly subscription unless you choose one. It’s entirely pay-as-you-go.

**How It Performs**

This was my biggest concern—would it actually be fast and stable? Turns out, **Ryoko WiFi** holds up well, especially in cities. I regularly see speeds between 40–100 Mbps depending on the area. It’s good enough for streaming, video calls, and general work tasks like uploading files or syncing cloud storage.

In more rural areas, performance can drop (as expected), but I’ve never been completely offline. The connection has always been usable, which is more than I can say for most hotel WiFi.

You can connect up to 8 devices at once. I’ve had my laptop, phone, and a friend’s tablet hooked up with no issues.

If you want to dig deeper into the specs, here's another link that has more info:  
[**Full Ryoko WiFi details**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/WC9TFJH/?uid=4362&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/CoolNewGadgets)

**Battery Life and Portability**

The battery life is impressive. I usually get around 12 to 15 hours of usage on a single charge. That’s enough for a full workday or long travel day. It charges via USB-C, which is nice since I can use the same charger as my phone.

As for portability, it’s about the size of a deck of cards. Super easy to toss in a bag or even a coat pocket.

**Top-Off Pricing and Data Use**

So, is it cheap to keep running? That depends on how much data you use. Top-offs start at around $5 for 1GB, with better deals on bigger packages (10GB, 20GB, etc.). It’s not unlimited, but it’s also not expensive compared to roaming fees or tourist SIM cards.

Also, any unused data **rolls over**. So if you buy 10GB and only use 3GB during a trip, the rest is still there next time you need it. That flexibility is honestly one of the things I like most about it.

**What I Like**

* **No contracts, no surprise fees**
* Works in a ton of countries
* Long battery life
* Set-it-and-forget-it setup
* Doesn’t drain my phone battery like a hotspot

**Things That Could Be Better**

* It only supports 4G LTE, not 5G
* No screen to check signal strength or data usage (you have to log in to the dashboard for that)
* SIM is tied to the device (you can't really swap it into your phone)

**Would I Recommend It?**

If you travel often, work remotely, or just want a backup for unreliable WiFi, **MUAMA Ryoko portable WiFi** is definitely worth checking out. It’s not some magical unlimited device, but it’s solid, reliable, and way less stressful than depending on public connections.

I don’t think it replaces your home internet or your phone plan, but for everything else—road trips, flights, camping, even just working from a park—it’s kind of awesome to have in your pocket.

Anyway, figured I'd post this for anyone debating if portable mobile WiFi is worth it. Let me know if you’ve tried it or have a different go-to!",1,1742708101.0,CoolNewGadgets,0,1.0,False

1jhs9st,https://i.redd.it/xsx2zbdlldqe1.jpeg,Half Light Café in the Morning Sunlight.,"I love early morning café runs on weekends, they help me wake up early on weekends, lol. For most of us, finding a seat at Half Light during usual hours can be tough, and the place is often filled with chatter, with everyone working on their laptops. Honestly, it kills the vibe a bit.

But visiting during the early hours, say 8:30-9 AM, is a completely different experience. Why, you ask? Well, those big glass windows truly do justice to the morning sunlight, especially when combined with the café’s white-themed interior. It’s just refreshing. Sitting there, watching the calm Sunday roads, sipping coffee, and either reading a book or chatting with your date, it’s pure peace.

This time, I tried the 'V60 pour-over' (Nokrek Naturals Sankalp Series beans). After the first sip, I reaffirmed my belief that nothing beats Starbucks’ pour-over with Sumatran beans, at least for me. I just couldn’t catch the bean’s flavor notes at first. Though later, it hit me, and I was wide awake.

For those considering an early morning coffee run, you definitely should. Sunlight is the best way to wake up and set your circadian rhythm, especially when paired with fresh coffee and an amazing ambiance. I still think Half Light, Malviya Nagar is the best spot for early hours.

So yeah, that’s my review. Definitely try it once! Coffee-wise, I personally love their condensed milk brew.",6,1742707995.0,jaipur,0,1.0,False

## Why Choose a Plastic-free Electric Tea Kettle?

Before we unveil our top picks, let's explore the compelling reasons why switching to a plastic-free electric tea kettle is a smart and healthy choice.

Heating plastic can cause possibly harmful chemicals like BPA (Bisphenol A) and other phthalates to leach into the water. These chemicals have been linked to various health problems, including hormone disruption, reproductive issues, and even certain cancers. By choosing a plastic-free choice, you eliminate this risk and ensure your water stays pure and safe. while some kettles are labeled ""BPA free electric kettle,"" that only addresses one chemical; a truly plastic-free kettle removes the worry entirely.
*   **Improved Taste:** Many users report that water boiled in a plastic-free kettle tastes noticeably cleaner and fresher. Plastic components can impart an unpleasant odor and flavor to the water, which can detract from the taste of your tea, coffee, or other beverages. A stainless steel electric kettle or glass electric kettle preserves the natural flavor of your water, allowing you to fully appreciate the nuances of your favorite drinks.
*   **Environmental Responsibility:** Plastic waste is a significant environmental problem. By opting for a plastic-free kettle, you're making a conscious choice to reduce your contribution to this issue. These kettles are often made with more durable materials and a higher build quality, extending their lifespan and reducing the need for frequent replacements. Choosing an eco friendly electric tea kettle aligns with a commitment to sustainability.
*   **durability and Longevity:** Plastic components in kettles can degrade over time, leading to cracks, leaks, and eventual failure. Stainless steel and glass are far more durable and resistant to wear and tear, ensuring your kettle lasts for years to come. this is particularly important for those prioritizing quality and seeking long-lasting appliances.A well-maintained plastic free water boiler is a smart investment.

## Our Selection Criteria: What Makes a Great Plastic-Free Kettle?

Selecting the top 5 plastic-free electric tea kettles involved rigorous research and careful consideration of the following key criteria:

*   **Materials:** The most crucial factor is the materials used in the kettle's construction. We prioritized kettles made with high-quality 304 stainless steel or borosilicate glass for all parts that come into contact with water. Kettles were only considered if reviews and product descriptions explicitly confirmed the complete absence of plastic in the water path.
*   **Performance:** We evaluated kettles based on their boiling speed, temperature accuracy (for variable temperature models), and overall efficiency. A safe electric kettle should also have automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection features.
*   **Design and Functionality:** We looked for kettles with ergonomic designs, easy-to-use controls, and features that enhance the user experience. Features like a wide mouth for easy filling and cleaning, a clear water level indicator, and a pleasant handle were considered.
*   **Durability and Reliability:** We examined customer reviews and product warranties to assess the long-term durability and reliability of each kettle. A kettle without plastic touching water is useless if it breaks down quickly.
*   **Value:** We considered the price of each kettle relative to its features, performance, and overall quality. We aimed to provide options for a range of budgets.
*   **Temperature Control:** Recognizing the preferences of tea enthusiasts, the availability and accuracy of temperature control features were prioritized. A variable temperature kettle plastic free is highly desirable for brewing different types of tea.
*   **Spout Design:** The spout design plays a vital role in the pouring experience. Gooseneck kettle plastic free options were considered for those who enjoy pour-over coffee or require precise pouring.

Then off to pick the kids up from school and all the lovely parents want to chat/ go grab a coffee/ rant about some school issue. Like I appreciate how friendly you all are but I'm tired gang and I have to get these kids home, homework, shower, dinner, lunch and clothes for tomorrow for us all.

One of my friends is 8 years younger than myself and still in the let's party vibe, at least once a month she's asking me to go clubbing, and I have a few times but like nah I just don't enjoy it much anymore. I don't want to talk to random drunk dudes and I can't afford to waste a day hungover.

Another friend wanted to have a play date at the park with a few mums and kids today. Sure the kids will love it, it was great for them. She just text the group chat asking for another play date next weekend. Like girl I just saw you. 

My Saturday mornings are either work or kids activities, dancing and basketball. After all that plus my working week you know what I want to do for the rest of my weekend? Nothing!!! Not see another human who isn't related to me.

How isn't everyone just exhausted? Where are people getting this social energy from because my social battery is dead. 

Oh and as I was writing this I got 2 messages, one from a friend asking if I want to go to lunch next weekend 1.5 hours away and one from my friend asking if we wanted to head over to theirs. They were literally here yesterday evening. Can I not just have some time to chill TF out before my weekend is over?

Ok rant done. Even if no one reads this it feels good to let it out. I'm also pre period and pmsing off my brain. Thanks lol",1,1742707288.0,breakingmom,1,0.67,False

I pay rent by running an online vintage shop: it's me, that most faded and esoteric Y2K trope, the wacky eBay guy. In my spare time I play synth and percussion, fix old computers, and walk around the city exploring. I go to a lot of heavy shows.

The breakup itself wasn't even harsch, we never had a fight, just long distance and feelings faded from her side. We stayed online friends because there was always a potential to get back together once we we lived close to each other again.

That was until she found someone else and texted me she thinks too much happened between us to remain friends, I agreed. 

That was the moment I asked to have a final phonecall, a story of some sort, to conclude, for a nice goodbye. She ignored the request.

I must have been an idiot for confronting her with that 3 months later, so like 9 months ago. Initially she wasnt amused, but then gave me an apology that it was not nice of her to not respond, she thought my request for a phonecall was not too much to ask for, but emotionally she couldnt do it. When I asked why, she said something was and still is blocking her, but she doesn't understand why. When I asked how she was doing, she said she felt shitty but didn't want to talk about it, so I left it there.

I think it was very sweet she tried to explain, and I now knew I had to get closure by myself. But there is still this voice in my head saying this girl was done with me and was able to say 'goodbye within 1 text,' just like that, while I was not even worthy of a phonecall. Its an internal fight in my brain, and I just do not understand why it bothers me so much.

I don't even think she would have been a good long term partner for me by how avoidant she is. So why cant I just move on?

With previous women I dated I always ended up drinking a coffee or have some chat on the phone before saying goodbye and then I just moved on...

1jhryff,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/1jhryff/little_help_with_a_decomposition_smell_in_a_truck/,Little Help With a Decomposition Smell in a Truck?,"I promise that while this may be a bit dark, I believe it is at least sort of dark comedy and would still love some help.  Ok here we go.  

In about 2008 my octogenarian grandfather bought a 2002 Toyota Tacoma that he only drove to the gas station and perform shady hunting tactics.  In about 2012 he became infirm and fell into the ""care"" of his girlfriend for the next couple of years until his passing.  After we (his family) finally found out about his death, some relatives went to see what could be done with what was left in the house and found the Tacoma parked abandoned in the drive, having not been driven since he lost his ability to do so.  

It turns out that since damn near nobody plans for their last days being able to care for themselves, my granddad spent one of those last outings obtaining the cadaver of a skunk.  I don't even know why you'd want a skunk corpse.  Knowing that he had a history with the game warden, he had stuffed the skunk into a coffee can and set it into the back area of the truck cab.  Then the remains of that poor, poor skunk sat outside in a locked, single-cab truck for almost two.  years.  

It has been a PROCESS for the rest of the family.  At least one person threw up from the smell in the first few days of the skunk-can and it's disposal.   My mother apparently tried multiple carpet shampoos and got fleeced by a cleaner who said they couldn't get the seats out to clean around the seat bases.  I borrowed an ozone machine and let it run twice for at least 8 hours apiece and got some things that are supposed to deodorize crime scenes, but on some days the smell is still very much there.  

You can imagine why the truck bounced around the family for so long before becoming my full-time vehicle.  I had only had to use it for a couple days or so before and now I get to drive this every day.  I have tried to sniff through the interior to try and figure out where the juices had soaked in but it feel like what I'm missing is either way under the seat or had just perforated every material.  

Since my grandpa didn't drive it much and none of the rest of us wanted to, it still has fairly low milage for a truck that apparently could last me a while.  I'm super-appreciative to have it and finally park in inside, I would like my vehicle to not smell like death, preferably.   

This is my first reddit so thank you in advance for your grace.  

Thank you.



P. S.   Yes, it smells like death.   If it smelled like skunk I don't think it would have been so bad but it smells like the world's worst roadkill.   ",1,1742706729.0,AutoDetailing,0,1.0,False

Diet is mainly quiche for breakfast, vegetable-chix soup or salad for lunch, chicken or beef with vegetables for dinner.  Occasionally bread, smoothie, berries-1/2 banana-kefir for treat. I also splurge after meals with iced coffee mocha with cocoa and 2/3 cup unsweetened oatmilk-milk mixture.  Questions below:

1. Endocrinologist said I can eat anything - it's quantity that matters.  My blood sugar occasionally spikes to 200 (which he says happens to normal people and diabetic association wants blood sugar in healthy zone 80% of the time minimum). How bad is it to spike to 200?

2. I can be hypoglycemic in morning once or twice a week if I go to bed and blood sugar is near 100 - and then it will drop below 70.  How do you keep blood sugar going below 70 in the morning or when you're sleeping?

My crush is the most perfect person I've ever met. 

Curly brown hair, big brown eyes, funny personality, and way more popular than I am. They were three to four years older than me, and at the time I asked I was fifteen. 

 We are fairly similar. We both like the same artist, have read the same books, have the same beliefs, and have the same sexuality. 

Back when I first met them, I wanted a sign that they were the right person. I kept saying that if they were the ones to let me see them again, and I'm not fucking joking the same day I walk into a coffee shop that I had been going to for ages, and they were working there!

So now you know some backstory:

After this, seven months went by, and we got to be pretty close friends. We talked at least once a week and saw each other bi-weekly. 

Welp, they come in one week and tell me they went on a date with someone. To put it short I was shaken up. 

They were supposed to love me... Right? All the signs were there...

Somehow I let my friend convince me to confess to them over text one night. 

This is exactly what I sent: 

""Hey, there’s been something I’ve wanted to get off my chest, and I wanted to go ahead and say it. I thought I was fine with how our friendship was and everything, but I realize now that I need to go ahead and have this conversation. I like you, and I thought I would be able to handle you being with someone else, but when you told me about that date you had, it really shook me. So I just needed to know, do you like me?? If this changes things between us, I'm sorry, I just needed to know.""

The reason I did this was because I wanted some sort of closure. If they liked me then great, if they didn't I would never have to speak to them again. I was expecting to be slandered and told I was ugly and that they hated me, but no. 

Of course, the person I fell in love with would never do that. 

This is what they sent:

""First I appreciate your honesty I know it takes a lot of guts to tell someone you like them and second I’m really sorry \[My name redacted\] but I’m going to be honest too and say I don’t think of you that way. It doesn’t have to change anything between us because I genuinely love being your friend and you have to understand you are significantly younger than me and I just think it wouldn’t be appropriate for anything to happen between us other than friendship. Again you’re incredibly brave for doing this and I know that you’re probably shaking so just take a deep breath okay?""

Now I don't know what to fucking do! They even added me on another one of their Instagram accounts an hour ago. They were so gentle and kind. Even reminding me to breathe, because they knew I would be shaking. 

I've cried about this, I've laughed at my stupidity, and I've gone through every encounter between us that might happen after this. 

The real question is how do I get over someone?

How do I get over someone I've loved for seven months? How do I get over the person who made me realize I was queer? How do I get over someone who I feel so connected to? How do I get over someone who still is my friend? And how do I act like everything is fine as I watch them grow up, date other people, and leave me behind? 

Because despite what they think of me, I’m not brave... And they have me thinking of waiting as many years as they need me to, for them to be comfortable.

I'm scared in every other relationship I will be looking for fragments and pieces of them. That'll be stuck here, waiting for them to be ready, for the rest of my life. ",2,1742705452.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

There are a lot of introverts around here, and I'm friends with some of you, but I'm looking for a partner with more similar energy to mine. I don't need to be out and about all of the time, and I enjoy time together but doing our own things as well, but I want to to be with someone who has a social battery more similar to mine. 

I am fun, nerdy, fat but active, leftist, interested in travel and am learning languages, I love video games (mostly PC) and board games, and I love singing badly (youtube karaoke anyone?). I'm interested in connecting with people in the face of this capitalist bullshit, and getting out for walks in nature. I'm pretty artsy and musical, but not great at any of it - it's just for fun. I'm spontaneous and up for trying new things. I love working on my mental health and growth.

I love people who are unique, authentic, and odd. People who are direct and capable of clear communication. Please tell me things you think I won't like - I'm here for it. Adorkable is one of my favorite vibes, but that varies. I'm attracted to a variety of physical features in people - attraction matters, but what I'm attracted to in one person is different than what I'm attracted to in others. I love nerds, I love hearing about what people are passionate about even when it's not something I'm into. I love info dumps and learning new things. It's important that you are curious rather than judgmental.

I am looking for people between the ages of about 33 and 47. Any younger or older and I have a hard time connecting. I'm into people who are progressive/leftist - having compatible values is important to me. I'd love to be able to game with you. I'd love to hang out and watch tv together, go walk around the forest or a city, explore new places or just chill over a beer or coffee. What I really want though is someone who wants to do things together somewhat regularly - who truly values connecting in person. 

If you want to get to know each other, please send me a message and make sure you include your name, age, and location, but also tell me why you think we might get along or what you were drawn to about my post. I will reply to any thoughtful message that seems like a genuine attempt to connect, but sometimes it takes me a while to respond to people because I get overwhelmed if I try to talk to too many people at once. I am always open to meeting new people, so if it's been a while, feel free to send me a message.",1,1742705142.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False
1jhrj4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1jhrj4t/im_confused_about_coffee_and_caffeine/,I'm confused about coffee and caffeine,"I've notice for a while that coffee was a big factor in my GERD. It started 8 years ago when I started coffee.

At one point, I thought it was caffeine on an empty stomach, because it was pretty much a trigger. 

So I stopped drinking on an empty stomach, and turned into high quality coffee.

Now, coffee is not a trigger beverage anymore (in the sense that if I drink it I don't get an immediate reaction). BUT if I consistantly drink coffee everyday for like 2 or 3 days, my GERD comes back.

The thing is: caffeine doesn't seem to be the culprit. I drink matcha or mate without any problem, though it should have more caffeine than my coffee according to the quantities I drink. Moreover, decaf is also triggering my gerd...

I feel like the problem is rather the roasted (or ""burned"") aspect of coffee. I also get the same reaction from chocolate or bread that is on the brown side from roasting. Looks like this is a Maillard reaction problem. 

Anyone has a clue about what is happening here?",2,1742705102.0,GERD,3,0.75,False

I have been analyzing the normal things that people say and do, for example lots of people say drive safe after you give them a ride and drop them at home or wherever, you would think they would want you to drive safe while they were in the car with you, or it implies that you were driving unsafe, anywho

I have been traveling and meeting people from various countries ie; Mexicans, Euros, Aussies, Americans, etc;

With them i was talking about how when i moved to the Seattle area, i had about 20 coffee offers, strangers were pretty friendly and helpful as well, quite a different experience since i was raised in the DC area

Of those 20 coffee offers only about 2 actually happened, i realized a lot of people were friendly but not wanting to be your friend, i am totally fine with that, the issue is when people say you should meet for coffee and they take your contact info, they have no intention of meeting you, thus they are lying, while also giving you hope because now you are probably excited about meeting them again but it never happens and thus you feel bad, if they never invited you, there would have been no hope, it would have been neutral, but the liar made that a bad memory/ experience now

Its so common to be fake in Seattle they now call it the Seattle No or the Seattle Freeze

Then there is the: It was a pleasure to meet you or the other similar statements, if it was truly a pleasure then they would want to experience that pleasure again and thus they would want to meet you again but they dont and thus it wasnt a pleasure but a lie, i was talking with a few people about this and they said they say that in order to be polite, we talked about how if a pleasure to meet you is required to be polite that thus implies a simple bye is impolite, i also mentioned that lying is rude/ impolite/ disrespectful, it was such a foreign concept to them that i could tell they were trying to process as it was going against their normalized thinking/ programming

Same with: Hey how are you, the asker doesnt actually care and the askee will usually just say fine/ well even if they are bad

Another thing is people saying sorry even if they arent sorry, its most commonly used when an individual tells you they had a family member or pet die, i dont actually feel sorry, so now i might say something such as: Oh that must have been quite sad for you

Along with also a virgin. Always struggled with major anxiety when it came to women.
  This happened last Saturday at a venue that I was invited to with friends, ever since then I have been riding this high and have been very proud of myself. Grant it I was drunk, she was the first girl I ever approached in public. Things unfortunately are slow with her and I am sure she isn't interested, I will talk about this part more later. So, we are at the entrance of the bar where the venue is being held and there is a long line. That's where I saw her, standing alone and arms crossed. I did notice a guy behind her talking to her but she seemed to be no interested at all. I audibly go ""Baddie detected"" and my crew just laughs. Anyways the leader of our group who we will call Adam wants to ""wonder around for a bit so the line dies down"" code for ""let's go take shots in the parking garage cause we are not paying 15 dollar a drink mostly made of ice"", so we are taking our shots and I just can't get that girl out my head. I just begin to hype myself up, I have never done this in my life but I felt like I had to do this. Even if I was rejected it would of been better then ""dang should of talked to her"" so I slap myself HARD and start doing push ups in a city parking garage. The crew the hype me up, well kind of. After our shots we leave the garage and get in line...where she's gone. I was devastated. And after waiting for a while we enter the venue and begin to walk around. And after a couple of minutes, I see her again. By herself, she was wearing this really beautiful sweater that she absolutely sparkled in. Like spice melange on the sands of Arrakis. And like if my body went into autopilot, I approached her. I introduced myself and complimented her on the sweater. She smile and told me where she got it. A normal conversation, where you from? Whats your name? (We will call her Shelby) I eventually said ""well Shelby I got to go now, but if it is alright may I have your number?"" She goes ""sure but what are you going to do with it?"" I was so tempted to say I was going to sell it to Chinese hackers but thought against it. So I just tell her ""we'll maybe we could plan on getting coffee or some time?"" She said sure and gave me the digits. So I text her later and thank her for the number that it was good to meet her. She says likewise and ask to let her know when I'm available for the coffee. Long story short the coffee date didn't happen. She had to postpone and I said it's OK and we can reschedule if she's still interested. She liked my text with a thumbs up but left me one seen. Don't know what that means, it hurts. But still I am very happy I did something like that. Never thought I would be text a 10/10 baddie. I can also use this lesson for much more then just dating. Such as approaching situations where socializing is required. And honestly ever since that day I have been much more social, smiling more and making eye contact. I actually want to do something with my life now, I know it's a lot. That just a girl that might of rejected me got me wanting to face life head on now. Well thanks for reading my story stranger.

I am prone to Candida overgrowth and I am also a self confessed sugar addict.

I do my best to stay away from it, but once I let it become a bad habit I find it a really hard cycle to break. 

Now that I’m pregnant my sugar cravings have been off the scale. In my first trimester, the only thing that helped my nausea was a can of full sugar coke and I had probably 1 a day every day for about 6 weeks and I think that got me off to a really bad start. 

Second trimester I began forcing myself to eat 3 proper meals a day which helped a lot but I’m still craving and indulging in sugar a lot. I gave up coffee 18 days ago because I felt caffeine was making my skin flush/itch all day everyday, affecting my sleep and digestion therefore not helping my gut health. That in itself has been so hard.

I ate a really clean diet the week before last and my skin cleared up a lot. This week I’ve taken several craving induced trips to M&S and treated myself to all manner of sweet treats from their bakery - so I’ve been eating brownies, cookies, pastries and drinking milkshake pretty much everyday. I’ve also had quite a high glycemic smoothie for breakfast most days with banana and lots of mixed frozen berries. 

Today (Saturday) would normally be treat day for me and my husband and that’s gone ahead as normal (I’m so embarrassed even writing this). I had my smoothie this morning, 1 small pain au chocolat, then skipped lunch but then had 2 small Bakewell slices, tea with sugar then a brownie after dinner which was chicken breast, white rice and roasted veggies. I’ve also had an awful lot of dairy this week in the form of whole milk which I believe is another issue with Candida. 

On and off for weeks, but today more noticeably than ever… I have rashes literally everywhere and the itching has kept me awake all night. I have a rash in my groin, itchy red patchy inner thighs, itchy rash under breasts and in between, my armpits itch, folds of my elbows, neck, face. 

I am literally miserable but I’m struggling to curb these sugar cravings whilst pregnant. I should also add some of these rashes have a weird smell like a bit yeasty and also my water intake over the last 2 days has been poor… I have normally kept on top of my water intake really well, as I’m also craving ice and I just drink sooo much water to get to the ice so I can chew on it. 

My body is a mess. My body weight is unaffected by my sugar issues in the main - I’m 34 years old and a fairly slim build but by god I think it’s absolutely ruining my health in other ways. Any advice appreciated

If you're following a ketogenic diet, you're likely scrutinizing every beverage that passes your lips. Diet Coke has long been a popular zero-calorie option for those looking to cut sugar, but does it align with the strict nutritional requirements of the keto diet? Many keto dieters find themselves wondering whether this classic diet soda can fit into their low-carb lifestyle. The good news is that Diet Coke does have some characteristics that make it potentially keto-friendly, but there are important considerations to keep in mind before adding it to your daily routine.

What Makes a Drink Keto-Friendly?

Before diving into Diet Coke specifically, it's crucial to understand what makes a beverage compatible with the ketogenic diet. The primary requirements include:

• Zero or extremely low carbohydrate content
• No added sugars
• Minimal impact on insulin levels
• No artificial ingredients that might disrupt ketosis

Nutritional Breakdown of Diet Coke

Diet Coke appears to check several of these boxes at first glance. Let's break down its nutritional profile:

• **Calories**: 0
• **Carbohydrates**: 0 grams
• **Sugar**: 0 grams
• **Artificial Sweeteners**: Contains aspartame and other zero-calorie sweeteners

The Potential Downsides of Diet Coke on Keto

While Diet Coke seems keto-friendly on the surface, there are some potential concerns for those following a strict ketogenic diet:

Artificial Sweeteners and Insulin Response

Some studies suggest that artificial sweeteners like aspartame might:
1. Trigger an insulin response
2. Potentially interfere with ketosis
3. Disrupt gut microbiome health

Hidden Health Considerations

Nutritionists and keto experts often recommend caution with diet sodas. The lack of nutritional value and potential metabolic impacts mean Diet Coke isn't an ideal beverage for optimal health.

Alternatives to Diet Coke on Keto

If you're looking for more keto-friendly beverage options, consider:

• Water (the ultimate keto drink)
• Unsweetened tea
• Black coffee
• Sparkling water with natural flavors
• Bone broth
• Electrolyte-enhanced water

Expert Recommendations for Diet Soda Consumption

Most keto experts suggest:
• Limit diet soda intake
• Prioritize water and other nutrient-rich beverages
• Consume Diet Coke in moderation
• Listen to your body's response

The Scientific Perspective

Research from the Journal of Nutritional Science indicates that while artificial sweeteners don't directly impact ketosis, they may have complex metabolic effects. A 2019 study found that frequent consumption of diet sodas could potentially:
• Increase sugar cravings
• Negatively impact gut bacteria
• Slow weight loss progress

Practical Tips for Keto Dieters

If you choose to drink Diet Coke while following a ketogenic diet:
1. Monitor your overall health and ketone levels
2. Stay hydrated with water
3. Consider it an occasional treat
4. Pay attention to how your body responds

Final Verdict: Is Diet Coke Truly Keto-Friendly?

While Diet Coke technically meets the basic keto criteria of zero carbs and zero calories, it's not necessarily the ideal beverage for those committed to a healthy ketogenic lifestyle. The potential metabolic impacts and lack of nutritional value suggest that it should be consumed sparingly, if at all. Ultimately, water and other nutrient-rich beverages remain the best choices for individuals following a ketogenic diet who want to maintain optimal health and support their metabolic goals.

\-measuring with my fingers its growing but the difference isnt as noticeable on the photos 

\-not sure how i wouldnt be at risk of malnutrition if its growing that fast but i've had hairs on my arms grow fast so maybe that makes sense. 

\-What if i'm at risk of cancer since its growing that fast....

\-I can get my hair back to neck length in a week or so I just need to keep it covered cause thats speeding up the growth.

Una sa lahat shoutout sa lahat ng politikong namuno sa Baguio sa nakalipas na 20 years. Walang urban planning, walang restriction sa pagputol ng puno, kahit gano karaming bahay pwede isaksak sa mga bundok. Nung mga early 2000 na nagpunta kami ng Baguio, puro puno lang makikita mo kahit san ka tumingin, green na mountainsides na nakatago sa fog, na may ilang sumisilip na nagtataasang Pine Trees. Ngayon yung same na mountain sides na yun, puro bubong na. Bubong ng bahay, or bubong ng hotel. Kahit nga yung mga bundok sa baba ng Mines View Park, puro bubong na rin eh. Pero di ba pag ang lugar eh designated na ""Park"", hindi dapat natatayuan ng bahay? O yung viewing deck lang sa taas ng bundok ang ""Mines View Park""? So pano na pala pag 100% puro bubong na yung baba ng viewing deck? Papalitan na lang yung name ng ""Roofs View Park""?

2. Shoutout dun sa mga pulubi sa buong Baguio na ginawang karera sa buhay ang mang-harass ng limos na parang may utang ang mga turista sa kanila. Yung isang matanda na nanlilimos sa kin sa loob ng Genesis bus station, APAT NA BESES akong binalikan. Sa tagal naming dalawa dun sa station, nakita ko gano karami ang nakubra nya sa ibang pasahero dun. Wag mo nang isipin na ipagtanggol si lola dahil maniwala ka sa kin, mas malaki pa ang kinita nya that day kesa KINIKITA MO AT KINIKITA KO, COMBINED. Napa-soul searching talaga ako sa napili kong trabaho at kung mas mahalaga ba talaga ang pride kung mas malaki naman ang kitaan sa pamamalimos.

3. Shoutout din sa mga businessmen sa Baguio na parang dalawang business lang ang alam sa Baguio: Coffee shop, OR Korean food. The three major food groups in Baguio are COFFEE, yung Strawberry Cake ng Vizcos, at Korean food. Nung naghanap ako ng ""healthy food near me"" sa Google maps, dalawa lang ata yung meron, Good Taste pa yung isa. Pero around 45 suggestions yung search na ""Korean food near me"", at mga 450 suggestions yung ""coffee shops near me"". Kaya sa ayaw at sa gusto mo, iinom at iinom ka ng kape, and/or kakain ka ng Korean street food, dahil ayaw nating pumila sa Good Taste. Pero dun talaga ako nagtataka sa Korean Food. Bakit Korean food? Sinong market nito? Alam nyo ba ilang Koreans ang nakasalubong ko sa Baguio sa isang linggo na nandun ako? ZERO.

4. Speaking of kape, shoutout sa FOAM COFFEE, ang coffee shop para sa mga sobrang wala nang maipost kaya willing na pumasok at magbayad kahit overpriced na kape just to take pictures para sa 20 followers nila sa Instagram. Sayang pera sa pagkain, sayang pera sa drinks. Bumili ako ng citron tea, ang sinerve sa kin literal na isang baso ng tubig na may konting yellow sa ibaba ng cup, na parang binanlawan lang nila dun yung kutsara na pinang-sandok sa Citron. Hanggang ngayon iniisip ko kung na-prank lang ba yung drink ko, tas hindi lang nila ni-reveal yung prank kasi hindi ako nagtaob ng table at nang-away ng barista. Forever kong pagsisisihan na di ko napicturan yung drink para eliminated agad yung mga may balak magtatanggol sa Foam Coffee. Lahat ng taong magsabi ng kahit anong maganda sa shop na to, zero credibility agad kayo sa kin.

5. Shoutout din sa Genesis Bus Station, bakit po kayo nagrerequire ng PRINTED COPY NG RESERVATION, na nasa RESERVATION PAGE NYO? Like... RESERVATION PAGE NYO YON THO?? Wala kayong access sa reservation system NYO??????? I mean sige, baka 3rd party lang yung [iwantseats.ph](http://iwantseats.ph) at wala talagang access ang Genesis sa website na yun, pero kikingina naman mga mamser ng Genesis, ano ba naman yung MAGLAGAY KAYO NG PRINTER SA LOOB NG TICKETING OFFICE NYO para sa inyo na rin magpaprint yung pasahero nyo, singilin nyo na lang sa amin? Ano, scavenger hunt pa na malala, ""Alam nyo ba saan yung pinakamalapit na printing shop dito?"" ""Hindi eh."" Hindi daw nila alam, pero baka daw sa ""dulo ng mga tindahan"". WALANG NAKAKAALAM NASAN EXACTLY ALING ""DULO"" NG ALING SPECIFIC NA ""TINDAHAN"". (FYI naglakad ako hanggang sa last na tindahan sa bus station na yon; wala silang printer.) Anyway oo ending nahanap ko sya. Pero hindi ko alam kung alin yung mas ironic, yung BUS COMPANY na need ng printed vouchers pero WALANG SARILING PRINTER, o yung printer shop na MAY PRINTER, pero walang printed signs na printer shop sila.

6. Shoutout sa kung sino mang politiko ang pumayag na maglagay ng kabayo sa Mines View Park. Sir Mayor, alam nyo bang walang CR ang mga kabayo sa Mines View Park? Puwes, halika dito, umupo tayo sa tabi ng mga kabayo, mga 30 minutes lang naman. Kailangan nyo kasing tumambay dito mamsir para malaman nyo kung saan umiihi yung mga kabayo na pinayagan nyong mag stay doon. Alam nyo ba kung saan sila umiihi??? **SA MINES VIEW PARK. UMIIHI. YUNG MGA. KABAYO.** ALAM NYO BA ANG AMOY SA MISMONG PHOTO AREA SA MINES VIEW PARK PAG ANDON YUNG MGA KABAYO? Hinde, kasi malamang nasa ribbon cutting ceremony na naman kayo ng isa na namang bagong coffee shop.

7. Shoutout sa palengke ng Baguio, na walang pricing standard. Alam nyo ba kung bakit regulated ang presyo ng mga bilihin tulad ng bigas, manok, etc.? Dahil kung walang iseset na standard price ang gobyerno, pwede nilang gawing 150 pesos or 1,000 pesos per kilo ng manok, **depende na lang sa horoscope mo ng araw na yon at sa mood ng tindera pag nakita ka.** Case in point, yung strawberry na 50 pesos per pack sa isang stall, pwedeng 100 pesos per pack pag lumipat ka sa left or right stall. Kaya mahalaga na mag-canvas ng presyo. WAG TAYONG MAHIYANG MAG CANVAS!!! Kahit nahihiya kang tumawad, gawin mo. Kalimutan mo na yung dignidad, sa panahon ngayon mas mahalaga makatipid. Tandaan mo, mas maliit ang sweldo natin kesa sa mga namamalimos sa Baguio.

Anyone want to take this journey with me?,"Weekends are always the hardest for me. During the week I like to live my best life, grow, learn, strive for better. When weekends strike I crumble into desperate pieces. I don’t have a lot of friends anymore, most having moved or married and I’m a person only having regained control of my life as of a few years ago so I’m still playing the grand game of ‘catch-up.’ Anymore I just drown in everybody’s copious lives and struggle to gain my own footing.

I like reading, writing, running, hiking, coffee, tea, cats, cars, Nujabes, and Aphex Twin. I like video games and stick to the classics like Halo and Left 4 Dead (pc player)

I aspire a move to the west coast within the next couple years of my life, if not this year.

I’d love to learn about you, hear your story, your ambitions and hobbies. And hopefully we can have the kind of friendship that propels us forward in life 😊

1jhr2hi,https://www.reddit.com/r/coloncancer/comments/1jhr2hi/pet_scanxiety_tips/,PET Scan-xiety Tips,"Curious if anyone has tips on managing scan-xiety. For context I just finished my 12th round of chemo, 5FU and Avastin, heading into round 13 soon dropping oxaliplatin. I have extensive liver mets, and metastasis in the abdominal wall. On chemo for life, surgery seems unlikely at the moment. I have an ileostomy, otherwise no procedures. I had a CT scan about a month ago to check in and it showed tumors plateauing/shrinking with new osseous metastasis in the pelvis (oncologist doesn’t think it’s metastasis, so now I don’t know who to believe). I’m also being seen at an NCI cancer center. My next PET is coming within the week, and I’m losing my mind. I’m terrified.

In my head the tumors are wildly growing every day. I panic every time I have liver pain. I have nightmares where my oncologist calls me to tell me I have weeks left (they said 18 months last August when I was diagnosed). I’m 25. I just finished grad school. I want a job and cute commute outfit and fun coffee order and happy hour with friends after work and dinner dates and a dog and a life. I want a life. I want to live. This PET feels like it’s going to end my world. Why is it so hard to keep the faith? I know to fight but it’s just so exhausting. Why am I fighting a battle I didn’t volunteer for? Why is one scan making me reevaluate and scrutinize my entire cancer journey? Who gave me cancer and how do I send them to hell? Apologies for the rant, any advice is welcome and appreciated.",2,1742703403.0,coloncancer,0,1.0,False
1jhr20n,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1jhr20n/what_to_dodating_advice/,What to do/dating advice?,"I’ve recently gotten back into the dating scene, and I’ve been chatting with a guy for about two weeks now. So far, the connection has been great, and we even discovered we have a few mutual friends, which is a nice bonus. For context, he’s 31, and I’m 27.

When we first matched on Hinge, he mentioned wanting to take me to an Italian restaurant for our first date. We kept talking, and when we finally met, we ended up going for coffee instead, which was a nice way to get to know each other. A few days later, it was his birthday, and he originally suggested seeing a movie together, but plans changed, and he invited me to join a birthday dinner with his close friends and their girlfriends. It turned out to be a great night, and that’s when he kissed me for the first time.

After dropping me off, he asked if I was free the next evening, and we ended up seeing each other again. This time, I drove to his place (he lives at home but mentioned he could buy a place if he sold some of his cars, boats, etc.). We grabbed Frosties and snacks from Wendy’s, sat in the car, and talked for hours. Nothing happened beyond kissing, and honestly, he doesn’t give off any f-boy vibes—he seems like he’s genuinely looking to settle down.

That said, our dates so far have felt a little unorganized. While I don’t mind casual outings like coffee, movies, or car rides, I’d also love for him to take the initiative to plan something a little more structured. I don’t want to sound demanding, but I do want to feel valued and enjoy more traditional date nights without having to suggest them myself.

When it comes to texting, he’s usually MIA until the evening, which I understand since he’s busy opening a business. But because of that, I never really know when I’ll see him or what our plans are. When we do text, though, our conversations are long and engaging, and he’s mentioned wanting to do lots of activities together, like car trips and winter/summer sports up north.

I guess I’m feeling a little unsure about how to approach this. I genuinely feel like we’re both interested, and he’s even apologized for being unorganized and slow to reply due to stress. I just don’t want to come across as too much if I bring it up. I’d love for things to continue, but I also want a balance between spontaneous hangouts and thoughtful date nights.

Any advice / thoughts?
