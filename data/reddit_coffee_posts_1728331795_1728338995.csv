1fyk3e2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowSlave/comments/1fyk3e2/sunny_still_has_shadow_bond_after_the_3rd/,Sunny still has shadow bond after the 3rd nightmare ,"I honestly believe that Cassie is the main antagonist. Not because she is with aster or any other group but because she wants to turn sunny into a tool. AND SHE HAS ALREADY DONE THIS IN THE 3rd NIGHTMARE. Does anyone not find it suspicious that when Cassie confessed to Sunny about seeing the sin of solace she told the wraith to be quiet and it immediately stoped talking. It was also confirmed that the sin of solace is a part of sunny which means it also has shadow bond. CASSIE IS SUNNY’s MASTER. Also when Cassie goes to see sunny at his diner for the first time she gives him an order, “tell me” which he immediately does with 0 thought and no narration. When I went and reread Cassie and Sunny’s conversations she makes it a point to never tell sunny to do anything and always responds with questions. I’m stating to question if Sunny actually loves Nephis because if you remember Sunny hates coffee but all of a sudden after the third nightmare he loves it now. I think that was a test Cassie ran to see how far she could manipulate him. AND THEN OF COURSE ERASED HIS MEMORY AND OURS TOO!!!! I also think the blind fold is a misdirection and she can control memories with anybodies eyes who she is connected too.  And as for my title of course we know he still has shadow bond it was outright told to us but because he lost his true name it can’t be activated but I think he still has his true name but Cassie hides it. Lost from light can literally mean STOLEN FROM NEPHIS!!!!",2,1728338799.0,ShadowSlave,1,1.0,False

***MAIN SCRIPT:***



*Fade in.*



*The sound of a heart monitor can be heard beeping slowly in the background.*



*In the distance however, a door creaks open, eerily.*



**ROSE:** Ughhh… coffee… need my coffee…



*Liquid can be heard being poured.*



**ROSE:** (sighing, relieved) Much better. Why is it so hard to find coffee around here?



**ROSE:** Huh? Oh, hi. You awake yet?



**ROSE:** Don’t worry. You're perfectly alright. Do you recognise where you are?



**ROSE:** Yes, you're in a hospital. One of the more secure ones our funders were able to build before this mess occurred.



**ROSE:** I’m Rose. Doctor Rose. I work for the World Health Organisation, and I am, or rather, was in charge of your recovery.



**ROSE:** (covering a small laugh) Yep, I’m a medical professional named Rose who works with other doctors at WHO. Trust me, I’ve heard the jokes before.



**ROSE:** Try not to move around so much. The binds will hurt it.



**ROSE:** That. The cut on your left arm.



**ROSE:** Look, try not to panic. I’ve done this procedure before. You just need to trust me. Can you do that?



**ROSE:** Thanks. Now, can you tell me what you remember? Do you have any recollection of what happened for the past 3 months?



**ROSE:** No, it’s quite alright if you don’t. If anything it all but confirms what you had.



**ROSE:** Last year, a virus spread throughout the world. We’re still trying to locate its origin but the mutations would travel very quickly.



**ROSE:** For the people who were infected, they developed an unquenchable desire for blood and meat. They became Zombies.



**ROSE:** I wish I could think of a more creative way to describe them, but no, they pretty much became Zombies. All their worst traits included.



**ROSE:** And in one year, that virus was spreading. In one year, it felt like the whole world was ending. Until we came in.



**ROSE:** Our scientists worked quickly, and a cure has been rolling out world wide. It hasn’t been easy, especially towards the more struggling countries out there, but it’s getting there. 



**ROSE:** From our reports and blood tests, you were someone who was infected roughly 3 months ago, and detained by one of your neighbours around the same time before they reported it to us. 



**ROSE:** We’ve had you down as a John or Jane Smith for a while but since our third wave of vaccines have been distributed, that makes you one of the lucky few to receive it. Congratulations.



**ROSE:** Well, as much as I’d love to get you a large bell to ring, we have procedures around here. And that includes asking questions and taking notes of those formally infected.



**ROSE:** I hope you don’t mind, but this will hopefully test how bad the infection was on you. And if there is anything we can do to prepare for it, should other formerly zombified individuals be suffering as well.



**ROSE:** Alright. Let me start simple then. What’s your name?



**ROSE:** Last name as well, please.



**ROSE:** Date of birth?



**ROSE:** And where were you living before you were infected?



**ROSE:** Yep, that all matches up. Thanks for that.



**ROSE:** Now, here comes the personal stuff.



**ROSE:** Do you feel hungry right now?



**ROSE:** Just answer, please? We’ll decide if it's serious or not.



**ROSE:** Okay, how hungry? Do you have any cravings or not?



**ROSE:** Ah. Fruit. That’s a relief. Easily redeemable though, we’ll get you sorted on that eventually.



**ROSE:** Next, what was your last memory before you were turned?



**ROSE:** You were out with a friend? Can I check to see who they were? We can contact them to let you know you're safe.



*Papers shift a little.*



**ROSE:** (muttering slightly, as if reading a list of names on a list, then quietly, shocked) What?! Is that…? No… no that can’t be right…



**ROSE:** Huh? Um… listen I don’t know how to say this gently. Your friend is no longer with us. They were turned, just like you were…



**ROSE:** I’m sorry. It’s a lot to comprehend. We can leave you for a bit but, their sacrifice wasn’t in vain, that much I can tell you.



**ROSE:** Now, just one last thing. We’ll need you to run around for a bit. Compare your speed to that of those who are still infected and those who have been cured.



**ROSE:** Most people who have formally been a zombie are said to have some increased speed, but only a little bit. We just want to make sure.



**ROSE:** Good. I’ll undo your straps then. Let’s get you moving.



*Fade out.*



*Fade back in.*



**ROSE:** And time. Not bad. Roughly point twenty-three seconds quicker than individuals in your median age. Not to worry though, again, being slightly faster is expected for those who were formally infected.



**ROSE:** How do you feel now?



**ROSE:** Good. We’re almost done then. We’ll just grab your things from the containment zone and have you cleared from there.



**ROSE:** Come with me. I’ve got the ID needed to get by.



*Footsteps can be heard.*



**ROSE:** Yeah, it is a bit unusual alright.



**ROSE:** I don’t think I’d ever miss the sound of kids playing, always waking me up in the middle of the morning. 



**ROSE:** We’ve had to do a lot to make this work though. And too many people sacrificed themselves, willingly or not, to get where we are now.



**ROSE:** Don’t worry though. Once you’ve cleared, the only thing you’ll have to worry about is the occasional booster vaccine from one of the other doctors. Everything else though, we’ll handle.



**ROSE:** Sure, ask me if you have any questions. Might as well now before you head out.



**ROSE:** Um… I thought I told you already. Your friend isn’t with us anymore.



**ROSE:** It means exactly what I said it means. Is it really hard for you to trust my words?



**ROSE:** Listen, just worry about getting your stuff okay? That’s all you need to worry about. Leave the complicated stuff to us.



**ROSE:** See, left hand side here. Grab your belongings and go.



**ROSE:** Don’t. 



**ROSE:** I said don’t.



**ROSE:** What is happening in the right hand side room isn’t your concern.



**ROSE:** Look, can you please just leave already?! I’ve got a lot of other patients to deal with and I have no time for babysitting here.



**ROSE:** Thanks, thank you. So just head on through and-



*Fast sprinting can be heard.*



**ROSE:** Hey, stop! Don’t go in there!



*A large, creaking door is heard being opened.*



**ROSE:** Listen to me, you have no idea what you're stepping into. Step away from the light cord.



**ROSE:** I said, stop!



*A light bulb flicks on.*



*A zombie howls and screeches loudly.*



*Large banging on sturdy glass can be heard.*



**ROSE:** Stay back!



**ROSE:** It’s okay. They only react if you're close enough to them.



**ROSE:** Yeah, yeah, alright just shut up! Let me explain…



**ROSE:** Yeah. That’s your friend. We call her Patient Zero.



**ROSE:** For whatever reason, there’s something in her bloodstream. A form of white antibodies that is strong enough to kill certain parts of the infection.



**ROSE:** That’s the thing. It’s tough, but not tough enough to overpower the zombie strain outright.



**ROSE:** When we found her, we took some blood tests, like the other infected. And that’s when we noticed the antibodies.



**ROSE:** We isolated them and, thanks to her, we’ve been able to replicate and multiply the effects of her white blood cells to create the cure.



**ROSE:** No. We can’t let her go.



**ROSE:** Look, I know you're angry. Sure, if the whole world found out about this, they’d be after our heads without question. But there’s a reason we still have her down here.



**ROSE:** While it’s true that we’re keeping her restrained against her will, we still need her to help produce the vaccines. To help save people like you.



**ROSE:** What do you think will happen if we just let her be cured? We’ll be losing our only known chance to fight against these things!



**ROSE:** Hell, for all we know, the zombie mutation could increase, and we’ll need to update our vaccines from there!



**ROSE:** I’m not saying that what we’re doing is right! But you have to understand that there are some things we can’t take for chance when the lives of thousands are at stake!



**ROSE:** Yeah, we’ll… No, I don’t like this idea. I’m one of the doctors on call to make sure she doesn’t escape.



**ROSE:** Every night I come in only to see pure hatred in her eyes. I can’t even tell if it’s her disease or because there’s a small part of her still there that wants to strangle me the first chance she can get.



**ROSE:** All this time, I just told myself we were doing the right thing. That maybe one day we wouldn’t need to syphon her blood every night and just give her the last vaccine we would ever need.



**ROSE:** But, she’s still here. And I tell myself the same, damn lie every time I see her.



**ROSE:** I don’t like this. I never liked this. But that doesn’t mean we can’t change it.



**ROSE:** I have the ID to let us inside after all. If you give me a few minutes, I can see myself borrowing one of the vaccines on reserve inside.



**ROSE:** Butt again, that’s the dilemma we’re both facing. Do we either save one person or save hundreds overtime?



**ROSE:** So what would you do? Do you want to save her?



**ROSE:** What would you do if you had the choice to save or doom everyone?



*The background sounds slowly fade out, leaving the question unanswered.*

for many months when starting the MCO training i would also sink the jing, that second bigger layer of full body heat, postural energy... i think from personal experience this is very fucking bad to do... the first layer that falls into the dantien usually pretty fast like 5 min, sliding from the organs, this is the qi, you hold it there with that exact pressure, you don't take the second layer of heat surrounding your body and sink it as well... you want the gentle qi sunk in the colon, and organs, and the slightly warmer heat of the external body still in tact, and circulating around the dan tien lke a kind of molasses... Being able to correctly feel both and correctly manage the pressure and diferent heats is Soooo important for not getting tired all the fucking time.

i will say i still have issues on the elixer leaking out of my field/ not entering the MCO, and also related to that gathering too much qi, before my weak external body can catch up to my internal power, so im working on finding the perfect amount, while working on the gym, and PT, as to not have it overflow as i dont really have my perineum set up to utilise it, and pull it into the orbit without a lot of tricky coaxing

i cant imaging it will be that easy but yeah just wanted to share, and also see if anyone else has had to deal with filling the dan tien to overflow mode before you could properly accept it, for me it will ussually disperse into the macrocosmic prbit which kinda sucks, is comfortable, or painfull, and so thats why im keeping it at a manageable level for now.

ps: After 3 years the big kicker in fixing my pelvis and leg pain has been meditating enough to realize that porn, videogames, and multiple coffees in a day are HUGE fucking traffic jams to my nervous system, obviously. For years i was doing qi gong, or meditating, or yoga and then playing a competitive videogame, or reaching down and cranking out some jing to a pawg video and wondering why i had constant anxiety, pain, nervous system fatique. the hangover from porn and videogames is real and causes issues for days later, and honsetly is probably dangerous to do with energy work, so yeah if still there, take up zazen, and take up QI Sinking to find your baseline energy levels and always think of what you can do to improve that charge.. for me is is and probably always will be nature walks, looking around, breathing in the trees.

Like, come on! I’m in Arizona, where buying from a private seller means no sales tax. It’s a beautiful, tax-free dream... until the dealer swoops in like “SURPRISE!” Now you’re slapped with an 8% sales tax – plus the dealer's ""I'm-taking-a-cut"" markup.

Seriously, why do people bring in a middleman for selling a car? It's not like we're trying to broker peace in a foreign land here! You can list your car on Craigslist, eBay, Bring a Trailer, or even slap a homemade ""For Sale"" sign on it and call it a day. Boom! Done. Interested buyers will flock to you like bees to honey.

Are people really scared of selling their car? Do they think a dealer has some magic wand that makes the car worth more? (Spoiler: It usually works the opposite way.) If you just took the dealer's fee off your asking price, your car would look like the deal of the century. It would fly off the market faster than I can down my morning coffee!

Not sure how much your car's worth? Try a five-minute eBay or Kelley Blue Book search. It's not rocket science. And yet, people throw their car to a dealer, inflate the price, and sit back wondering why it's gathering dust in a showroom.

Also, when I buy a car from a dealer, I get zero backstory. It's like I'm adopting a pet without knowing if it’s ever bitten the mailman! Super impersonal. I mean, come on, does anyone else feel like handing your car to a dealer is just straight-up lazy? You're practically giving away money for something that takes, what, an hour to do?

Don't read if it bothers you, of course.I have some doubts about my ex-boyfriend's manners. could It be related to paranoid schizophrenia (plus NPD maybe)? ","My F32 ex-boyfriend M39 (he is in a autistic spectrum, maybe this information is relevant, given that the topic is behavior.) seemed an introvert when I met him so I took the initiative of contacting also kissing on our first date, after a few weeks talking, which he later told me he took as a red flag; he told me that for him, things worked by going out for *""a coffee, then another coffee, and another coffee, and then...""*  He didn't finish the sentence, but it made me thoughtful because he had told me that in our previous conversation he had only been with only one person before me,  (in terms of kissing or having sex) according to him. But that day we repeated many times and after we left each other to go home, we kept talking and he told me it was nice and enjoyable;
On our second date, he said he already felt like he was in a relationship. Caveat: We were both equally open to it. The enthusiasm in the conversations was mutual, as it was for the schedules initially. But soon after, some arguments arose when I started to question him after observing some behaviours such as omissions, inconsistencies and a few lies. I think the justification for that may go beyond insecurity. Eg.: telling me he needed to go out to buy something when he was actually going out for a coffee with a friend.  At first, that was somewhat understandable, but as time goes on, it's natural we get more confident and leave the excuses. But it wasn't what happened in so many cases.
So I observed behaviours like that and would point them out to him with the intention of helping him understand that he could be transparent with me about what he wanted/needed, and that I would understand him.
And I kept realising that, and trying to do the same, so I was getting frustrated but I was trying to show him the best way would be to communicate better, and I asked for that several times. We just started having arguments. 
Then he would stop responding to my messages or would reply with gaps of several hours, which was not usual, however I assumed it was a little because of his autism (I mean the fact he chose to be quiet and refusing any type of communication, I got it as a difficulty to face the conflicts in order to solve them as I read). On the other hand, it seemed like an attempt at emotional manipulation. I started feeling like he was trying to manipulate me over time with silent treatments, in order to condition me to accept that kind of behavior. He said he distanced himself because I was being accusatory, but he refused to have any clarifying things properly, giving  short and evasive answers only, followed by silence and later saying he didn’t want to talk about that matter. Eventually, he refused to discuss anything related to us, claiming that I only talked about that, but that's not true, because we connected in the first place with common interests. I was insisting on clarification because it was bothering me, obviously.

I wrote to him several times in an attempt to resolve that because he refused to call or talk personally claiming to feel uncomfortable. 
He started saying I was just  interested in emotional drama and that I was being abusive, which sounds like gaslighting to me.
In order to break that loop, I invited him to reflect and ask himself why things were happening that way. And after some other unpleasant events, I suggested we go to therapy with the same professional. At one point, he briefly said he would think about it, but later replied that he didn’t want to.

Let's go back in time for a while: Knowing he had previously used dating apps, one day I asked if he still used them. Not only did he tell me he wasn't using that, but he also made a gesture of handing me his phone as proof that there was nothing there. That alerted me because it doesn't take much intelligence to know that doesn’t serve as proof. A few days later, I asked again, and then he told me that after one of our early arguments, he stopped believing our relationship would work and simply went back to using dating apps. So yes! He had underestimated my intelligence by handing me the phone then. 

Similar things happened regarding conversations with ""other people,"" and what seemed to me like simple things that could be resolved through dialogue became triggers for avoidance. He told me that when ""I started being like that,"" his mind started to go in other directions. I also heard something like ""I did things that must have discouraged you, and you didn’t leave."" Would that be an implicit hint? Why didn't he tell me what he wanted then? What do my readers understand as ""other directions""? HOWEVER...  I asked a few times if he wanted to continue meeting/getting involved with other  people because he conveyed this in previous conversations about people 
he was talking to when we met and his answer was: ""Sigh"", ""I'm not doing this conversation anymore, let's talk about music"", or simply nothing. So he never gave me the confidence that he had stopped talking to ppl who he used to flirt with. He even said he was still having some conversations with one of them  at some point (by the way, the one he had shown attraction for, and according to him, it wouldn’t work out because he had a “sexual hobby” that didn’t work for him, but he continued talking to her because he wanted to understand what she wanted from him. That was also during our relationship) I naturally asked questions about his feelings/ intentions towards that person (She lives at the same country he was going to live for a couple of months for some specific reason, well.... It's natural since he told me he started talking to them during the days we were in bad vibes. So he said I was jealous and he simply adopted an: ""I'm not talking to anyone,"" as a standard response for anything that referred to a similar subject.

*Just one more topic about ""I'm not talking to anyone"" Once, during one of our conversations when he was in a good mood, he mentioned that he basically only talked to family members and three friends, and months before he had said he had two or three female friends who lived in the UK / Corea and it was very rare for him to talk to them. I felt that his tone was defensive, which conveyed more insecurities. I don’t want to sound like a judgmental fool, but I will point out a few things and leave it to the reader to draw their own conclusions. The person had 'theoretically' stopped using dating apps after having used them for several years. He considers himself a nerd, and much of his life is online, with several social media accounts. It’s a bit strange to say he limits himself so much in chats. I asked a few questions trying not to sound invasive, but that’s the response I got. And then: I saw a few conversations, when he opened his Instagram one of them with a girl (from USA) btw and reactions with ""♥️"" although the subjects at least at that moment, the topics were generic. Discouraged, I just said in a sarcastic tune: *""Anyone is too little!""* He called me jealous, claiming they were just friends.. Actually the conversations were about general stuff. I don't believe that girl would even be interested in him in a romantic way (for reasons that I won't elaborate on further) but the conversation seemed very ""enthusiastic"". Before ppl ask me how I could see that and call me invasive.... I asked him for that and he showed me. 
And he told me: she’s my friend. (Wtf?) Further down, there were 3 or 4 more chats with girls, and I asked about the one closest to the bottom (he had done the same thing with me before when he saw my chat open, and I responded without any issues. The difference is that I never said I didn’t talk to anyone; on the contrary, I even mentioned a male friendship I made through a dating app in the past).

At the bottom was a conversation with one of his former students. Hey, it’s fine to have friendships with the opposite sex, but when you start hiding it... Bro? Why the insecurity at this level? Could they have been the targets of some previous flirting? (Maybe not just 'previous' 🤔)""
But my point wasn’t about the people or the conversations with them because of jealousy simply. Actually it was more related to the fact that he was always on the defensive, giving evasive answers and inconsistent justifications in various aspects of our conversations about topics like that. He used to say he basically was talking to five other people. I just asked him things like that because of the other manners, I already started to think that he was maintaining the relationship with me because it was 'real' at the moment, but he wanted to keep the possibility of something better or simply 'something' in case things didn’t work out between us. The traditional game of those who embrace the idea of fluid relationships. 
Could this behavior be partly related to the difficulty of resolving conflicts? That's it: instead of having a conversation with me about what was bothering him and what was bothering me, he simply tried to sweep it under the rug and avoid me. I struggled to believe that someone I admired precisely for showing me that they were above various types of behavioral neglect was choosing that path.
 I was kind of waiting for the person to face the reality because some behaviours seemed childish and therefore incompatible with the part of his personality that made me get interested. He used to present good arguments and articulated consistently on the general topics we discussed, which made our connection enjoyable initially.
 We enjoyed a good moment together of course.
Things heated up between us, like with any couple. The difference was that, by his choice, we didn’t have privacy, and he only agreed to go out in public places. That was okay for me, but after a few months, I suggested doing something different, like going camping or going somewhere that would allow us more privacy. This wasn’t necessarily for having sex, but we always went to pubs, for a walk in town, or to parks, which, although still public places, allowed us a few minutes of 'peace.'

We  had sex only once, for literally 3 seconds, and it caused him extreme concern about the condition of the condom (which was intact and fine) and a huge paranoia about all the negative possibilities.
We did that in a place without total privacy, and he was so worried while I was trying to calm down he disclaimed about the spot - a park -  but that was the only option we could think about. (📌 On that day, we had gone to that place somewhat prepared for it, and he even made some funny comments about it. I felt a bit embarrassed, but I was okay about it.)

After that, he told me he wouldn't be prepared to do that again anytime soon, I said ok but I didn't understand such a big block around it since he told me I used to make him uncontrollably horny and sex would be something dangerous. 
Days later he said something like ""I want you"", ""let's do whatever you want"", "" let's have sex"". He had a few beers that day and the next day he sounded like his changed his mind a little and in some time later he sent me a 15-min You-Tube video containing some basic principles of Geomancy. He told me he had asked some questions during that practice about whether he should have sex with me or not. He was looking for answers regarding a decision about a trip he was going to take related to professional matters.

I was willing to have patience with almost everything that would be different for me, but no cheating. I basically found myself wrestling with someone else's partially fictional universe.

He said emphatically: ""You ruined everything"" was his sentence when he saw me struggling against an end in that condition, bc letting a lack of communication create a society of monsters to destroy expectations and good feelings becomes sad, poor, even ridiculous. That's my ""doubt"" (if I really can call it doubt) because that represents a weak manipulation tactic usually used by neurotypicals lacking emotional intelligence or / and respect, but technically that doesn’t match him because he usually analyzes facts and situations more intelligently, in a high level common sense, I would say. At the same time I’m talking about a person who *literally* ran away a few times when I sought him out to have a conversation. 

Later, he started engaging in apparent narcissistic games, like singing while I was talking to him (I understand he was anxious about making a difficult decision for him in those days, but…) He complained that I only wanted to talk about relationship issues while he preferred to talk about movies or music, which sounded a bit bizarre to me; I wasn’t talking about problems because I enjoyed it but because I found it necessary to  clarify what was bothering me. And he seemed to start hating me and for a while I felt the same.

There were times when I went to see him (without us schedule it and I know that's not the best thing to do but he just stopped talking once again, I was sad, because I know there's a lot of better ways to solve that. I just wanted to have a decent conversation. Although I understood he got nervous and anxious with our issues.
One day I approached him saying, ""Hi, I'd like to talk. I know you're uncomfortable, but can we at least have a brief conversation?"" He seemed to hate me at that moment, but I insisted, telling him how disproportionate it was imo. He certainly interpreted many things from my side in a way that I didn't intend. He even said a few times he was paranoid; 
Naturally, people ask why I stayed. I wish I could have done something to change that *because/however/although* I can't see a logical reason for that set of strange manners. I got irritated in the process, and I made mistakes in how I treated him too, but nothing unforgivable to the point where I didn’t get any response, even if neutral.
So he told me that if I didn't leave, he would notify the police. I laughed ironically, but in a state of perplexity. Really? Something we could clear up over coffee, talking like the 30+ year-old adults we are. He started laughing in a strange way—nervous, sarcastic—and turned the corner. I asked where he was going, and he answered, ""To the police station."" I said, ""Really? I’ll go with you, and we can clarify the exact reasons driving you to do this, right?""
I couldn’t understand what led him to this extreme but wouldn’t allow him to have a conversation with me as the situation required. There were no screams, no violence, no offense or anything that would make the involvement of a police officer necessary imo. 
He claimed that I was ""following"" him. It was: I went to meet him on the same path we used to take when he was coming back from work. It was our way to the train station. We had an arrangement, and apparently, he wasn’t keeping it. I believe I had the right to understand what was going on. Simply blaming me, saying I was ruining the relationship, was neither fair nor sensible. I had some indications that he was seeing other women.
I never made any comment that would make him think it was a criterion for me that a man should only have had one woman /s or that he couldn't go out with a friend, or that someone couldn't have had a past or other loves. 

He also told me he felt threatened by the tone I used when I let him know I found out where he lives. 📌There we go: : we don’t live far from each other, there’s just one neighborhood separating ours, and a friend recognized him because he had seen us together and asked if I knew, and I responded that I only knew the general area. My friend was even a bit surprised because most people in relationships usually visit each other’s homes. But in our case, he would feel awkward about his parents and there are other implicit factors, like him having thought I might have some material interest, a different nationality, given that he also made it clear he held some prejudice toward people of my nationality (yeah... I know). This would be another barrier for certain things. I know that the way he processes some thoughts is very different from mine, and I let a lot of things slide because I believed time would help him feel more at ease with me. But his behavior went from 100 to 0 in some aspects towards me. The conversations got a strange tune, he started frequently giving up on our schedule; apparently, the inconsistencies about trivial day-to-day things were increasing in proportion.
There was a moment when we reconciled, and we exchanged an ""I love you,"" which once again came from me, but he reciprocated. Also, one day, when I suggested I might leave the country, he said he felt wrecked, empty... 
My understanding of that guy's motives fluctuates as much as his emotions and feelings, I think. In part, he was afraid of being left, so he preferred to do it first, as he did but in the process, he decided to inflate his ego by showing narcissistic traits. Did he use the fact that I chose to stay and try to fix things as a means to inflate his ego, seeing the opportunity to cheat?
He justifies the feelings I had for him by saying that this was the result of magic spells he did before we met. 
I've already put myself in his shoes several times, but I don’t know if he has the same ability. 
I was disappointed and perplexed by his reaction to my attempt to talk + he had said that his friends advised him to stay away from me. Did his account contain valid justifications for my dissatisfaction? I don't think so
So I wrote a text similar to this one for his friend, slightly shorter than this, telling what would be 'my version' of the events. And probably now he hates me because of that. 
Any comments on the subject are welcome, except about the length of the text, as I'm aware that it’s worthy of a magazine article, lol

I had checked on the status exactly a week after the event, which stated that my payment was IN PROGRESS. Today, 10/7 marks business day 6 still awaiting payment. Before work, I go to buy a coffee, and my card is declined. I check my account and lo and behold money has been TAKEN from it with absolutely no explanation from stubhub via email. I received no communication about the situation as it happened, but upon calling customer service, I was made aware that I had posted my ticket under a 2 day pass listing instead of a 1 day pass listing. Luckily, my livelihood does not rely on the $300 i was going to make off of this sale, nor the $300 i ended up /losing/ as of today (paid $150 for the ticket, was charged $150 today by stubhub). I understand it was my mistake in that I posted it on the wrong listing, but how is it possible that no one reviews this type of thing? With the type of money that's at stake? Especially because I got an email that said the ticket I submitted was ""accepted"". that was the language used, which to me, implies it had been reviewed or something to assure that it was what I said it was by posting it on that listing. Anyways, customer service told me that per their policy, there was nothing I could do, but that he would submit a claim to a review board or something asking for at least some of my money back or whatever. He didn't rlly specify what exactly the claim would be. He told me this reviewing would not be done immediately, but would also take 5-8 business days to be processed and that it was unlikely I would see any money back. When I asked when or how I would be notified after the claim is reviewed, he said in his experience, they won't notify me and I'll have to be the one to email or call. I'm really grateful for this customer service rep's honesty and compassion; I know that the policies are out of his hands. I just find this whole situation completely and entirely absurd. He said that giving a testimonial ""wouldn't help"" when I asked if I could give one, so I have absolutely no way to advocate for myself aside from the way the facts are laid out in their records. He said that the buyer did submit a complaint ""late"" but did not clarify what day that was. I feel terrible knowing she may have come from out of town, had a hotel, and gone day 2 and tried to scan the pass I sent her just to be told it was a 1 day, but I just can't believe she got to use my ticket and in the end, I paid for it. I'm unsure of how much she was refunded, but to me it sounded like it was the whole amount. So she gets to go to day one for free and I pay the price I bought the tickets for and a $145 fee for fucking up selling a ticket on a website i'm not familiar with? I just can't believe they're getting away with this and the law is probably not in my favor, since I'm sure I signed terms and conditions without reading.

I have some capital I can put towards doing this but no knack for social media (and I’m not sure how much that helps anyway since I’m targeting b2b?)

The emphasis for me has always been on high quality, single origin loose leaf teas. Part of what rankled and inspired me in equal measure to start importing teas is because I would see upmarket cafes serving coffees with lots of attention and care but have a very poor tea selection that was brewed sub-optimally (think pyramid bags dumped in boiling water).

The reviews of the teas I sell are great (a roasted oolong and naturally honey-like Chinese black tea are very popular). I’m currently stocked in just over a dozen food service outlets that was gotten by happenstance - essentially me walking into a cafe and getting the decision maker to try the teas, showing that it was a minimal to no change to cost for them for a 3-5x better tasting product. As a new mom I need to figure out how to grow in a way that doesn’t involve me actually hitting streets and going in person to show off the tea.

I also have a nice-looking retail range of the same teas in response to the cafe owners asked if I could make a range to put on their shelves.

In my country Orthodoxy is a tiny minority, and such I am not friends with any practicing Orthodox apart from my God father and those I see at the coffee hour.   
the friends I have now do lead me to sin, I used to many bad things with them and often led them to sin. I have come to regret this a lot. Here is my dilemma, they are not Christians, and often I just stay silent when they are talking because I don’t want to jeer at someone or talk about women etc. 

  
what should I do? Not be friends with them? I already don’t go out with them outside of school for the most part but i am still concerned. I want to preserve myself from sin but also I do love them as my friends who I have been friends with for years.

Apologies for my stupid username, I can’t change it now.

I recently started my journey into the world of coffee, and I’m excited to explore and taste as many types as possible. A family member will be traveling to the US soon, and they’ve offered to bring back some coffee for me. I’ve seen a few brands come up often on various coffee subs (Black & White, Sey, Perc, among others), but I’m hesitant to buy a single 12 oz bag and stick with just that for a while.

I’d love to try something as experimental as Black & White, but from what I’ve gathered, they don’t offer box sets of different coffees. I noticed that both Perc and Onyx have box sets available, so I’m considering those.

Which one would you recommend? Or are there other brands/sets worth considering for a variety of high-quality, experimental coffee?

The next day I had to work, but luckily got someone to cover half of my shift. That way I could be at the therapy session like I said I would. I was heading that way when I got caught in traffic. I tried to call and text Sarah, but nothing. Eventually I got there, but about 5 minutes late. I got up to the office and told the receptionist why I was there. She looked at me like I was kind of crazy. She said she would ask the therapist and would be right back. Thirty seconds later she came back and told me what room to head to. I got to the office and inside was Sarah sitting on a couch. And her therapist is sitting across from her in a chair. I apologized for being late. I told Sarah I tried reaching her, but she didn’t pick up. She looked at her phone and saw the missed calls and texts. She apologized saying she barely looked at her phone these days. “What!! The candy crush wizard doesn’t look at her phone anymore. Now I am really worried.” Sarah gave a weak smile and a little chuckle at this. So it was good to see she still had a bit of a sense of humor. The therapist asked me to sit down and introduced herself. She said she was shocked to find out that I not only got back in contact with Sarah, but that I offered to come to therapy with her. She asked what my intentions were. I figured this was a valid question. So I told her that seeing that Sarah has been beating herself up over this for over a year was heartbreaking. Yes I was mad at her, but I didn’t hate her. I said people can do bad things, but that does not make them bad people. And that I believed that at the end of the day, Sarah was a good person, who just did a bad thing. And that maybe this would help us both get some closure. The therapist seemed to accept this answer. She asked me to tell her a bit about myself. I told her how I was also in therapy and had BPD. What I did for work and other hobbies. I only described myself briefly. She asked me about my BPD and what it was like during our relationship. Considering it tends to put a big strain on relationships. I explained to her how Sarah had helped me get through some of my worst symptoms. Not that she cured me, but that she helped me to pull myself out of my depression. That most of my BPD traits were a thing of the past. I still had some symptoms, but for the most part, I was doing much better. And I had been since the start of our relationship. The therapist started asking me questions about our relationship. How it got started, what it was like and how it ended. She wanted to hear things from my perspective. Since she had only been hearing one side of the story so far. She asked me if I had any questions I wanted to ask Sarah about in regards to her cheating. I said that there were two things that still bothered me. If we were so in love, then why did she cheat on me at all? And why with Josh of all people? Sarah was just quiet. Either she didn’t know what to say, or she was too scared to. The therapist stepped in and said that in the past year, one of Sarah’s biggest hurdles was to understand why she cheated at all. That she knows why Josh, but she just can’t explain why she did it at all. That Sarah was always disappointed in any reason she could come up with, because none of them were justified. It was one of the biggest things holding her back from getting better. So I asked her to explain why Josh then? She started speaking in a whisper, but the therapist urged her to speak louder and more clearly. That it was important that I hear what she has to say. So she sat up a bit straighter. Half faced me, still unable to look at my face and started to speak. 



She said that she was just out one day. It was maybe a week or so after our talk about marriage. She was feeling really down and sad because she couldn’t stop thinking about what I said about marriage. That she kept replaying it in her head so often that my maybe, was nothing more than a no in disguise. That’s when she randomly ran into Josh. They said their hellos and how are yous. But Josh could tell that something was up with Sarah and asked if she was okay. She said she was fine and didn’t walk to talk about it. But Josh insisted. He asked her to join him for coffee and to just vent about what was going on. And she agreed. As they sat sipping their drinks Sarah just launched into this whole thing about how she really wants to get married one day, but she doesn’t believe I ever will. How she loves me so much, but she doesn’t know if she wants to stay with someone who isn’t on the same page as her when it comes to this. How she felt like she wasn’t good enough for me. At least not to marry. How more than likely I would just end up leaving her one day anyway. And that is when Josh tried to comfort her. He started showering her with compliments. Telling her that I was the lucky one and that in reality, she is actually the one who could do better. She said she actually snapped a bit at him for that one. Saying that I was a wonderful person and that there was no one who was too good for me. That actually warmed my heart a bit. But even after that he just kept love bombing her. How she had been feeling depressed for a while and how because of that, his words just hit differently that day. She felt just a little bit wanted and admired. That she knew Josh was not a great person, but still couldn’t help but to fall into his words. She noticed that she was getting a bit too hung up on what he was saying, and realized she needed to go. He offered to walk her to her car. She declined at first, but again, he insisted. They talked all the way back to the car. Mostly him love bombing her some more. When they got to the car she turned around to give him a hug and thank him for his kind words. But he just leaned in and kissed her. And she didn’t stop it. That in that moment she knew what she was doing was wrong, but it felt like punishment. A punishment she deserved. They went from making out next to the car, to them both in the back seat taking each other's clothes off. And that’s when they had sex. Afterwards, Josh just put his clothes back on. Said that was fun, got out of the car and walked away. Leaving her in the back seat frozen and trembling. Wondering why she just did that. Feeling nothing but guilt and shame.



At this point, I was mad. Not so much at Sarah. I had already processed those feelings. I didn’t need to know the details to know she cheated, and that was all that mattered at the end of the day. I was mad at Josh. To take advantage of a girl, no, a friend, when they are obviously going through something. To play on her emotions like that and then to drag her down to his level. What a scumbag. 



Oh yeah, last I heard Stacy had divorced him, uncovered about 5 affairs that he was actively having. Used this to take him to the cleaners. Now I guess he lives in a studio apartment because that’s all he can afford after alimony and child support. Stacy moved saying she and their kids just needed to be closer to her family. 



After Sarah was done, the therapist asked how it felt knowing the details. I said that for one, I was disappointed. Disappointed that Sarah let herself get caught up so easily in Josh’s obvious manipulation. Sarah just lowered her head. I said though that if she was really feeling that depressed, I guess I can understand how she might have been swayed. She didn’t really react to this. I asked her if there was anything else that was going on. Were there any other times or any other people. Sarah said no, and adamantly. I asked if there was anything that might have been contributing to the depression? That it couldn’t have just been the marriage talk. She agreed and said that the depression started to set in before that talk. I asked her was it something that I was doing, or not doing? Was I not being a good partner for her? She immediately raised her head and for the first time met my eye line. She said in a serious tone that I never did anything wrong. That while I was not perfect, that I still gave her everything she had ever wanted, and that she threw it away for nothing. She broke down and started crying.



 Her therapist looked at me and said that this was how much guilt she has been carrying around since our break up. That she just seems unable to move on from her mistake. She has acknowledged where she went wrong and takes responsibility for it. But it’s really the reason that has been her anchor. I went to put my arm around Sarah’s shoulder but she jumped so I pulled away. Her therapist told me that Sarah has become very sensitive to physical contact and preferred to keep it to a minimum. Sarah spent most of the remaining time crying. 



After the meeting we both walked outside. I asked her how she felt about that. She said it was a bit uncomfortable, but in a kind of good way. She was just happy I kept to my word and showed up. She wasn’t sure if this was a trap to get back at her. I let out a small laugh and told her she sounded like me when we first met. She cracked a small smile at this. We both stood there silently for a moment before she asked what now. I said well now I continue to join you for these for as long as you and your therapist are okay with it. I wasn’t looking at her when I said this, but I could feel her gleaming. She asked me again why I was doing this. That again, I should hate her and that she really doesn’t deserve this kind of kindness from me. Still without looking at her I told her that I owed her more than I think she even knew. That it’s been over a year since we broke up and that I was ready to move past it. That while we will never be a couple again, maybe, just maybe, we can get back to being friends again. She asked if I was being serious and I assured her I was. I told her that out of everything that I regretted this last year, the worst was losing my best friend. That I missed her, and I think I’m at a point where I can let them back into my life. It was weird, but I swear I could hear some of the weight lift off of Sarah’s shoulders. She thanked me and said she should be going. She walked maybe 5 or so feet away before I asked her what she was doing that night. She stopped not knowing what to do. Like a broken gear she slowly turned around. In a soft timid tone she said “nothing”. I walked over to her and asked her if she wanted to come over for dinner. Again, she was dumbstruck. She just stared. I waved my hand in front of her face and asked if she was okay. She snapped out of it and said that she appreciated it, but she probably shouldn’t. I asked her why not? She didn’t have a response to this. I told her that if we are going to start maybe repairing our friendship, then let’s start with a nice dinner and conversation. She again said she wasn’t sure. I asked her what she has to lose. As if she couldn’t control it she said “well, my mind for starters”. I asked her to explain. She said that like today, she wouldn’t be able to stop thinking that there is some kind of trap around the corner. That she still isn’t sure if this is some kind of long planned out revenge. It was honestly the longest and most coherent set of sentences I had heard her put together in 2 days. I kind of laughed at this and told her that she really did sound like me when we first met. I assured her there was nothing nefarious going on. That I just want to bury the hatchet, and that I wanted to start that off by cooking her dinner as an olive branch. But I made it clear that this was nothing romantic. That I am only looking to mend a friendship and that is all. She still looked skeptical, but she reluctantly agreed. I told her I still lived in the same place and to be there at 7. She turned around and walked to her car. But with a slight spring in her step. ",1,1728338090.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Backstory: I’m in my early 30s and have been working out for 15 years. My diet is fairly good; I eat well and am very active. I don’t drink, don’t smoke, and have never had any major health issues other than shoulder surgery and some COVID-related problems. I’ve used pre-workouts since my early 20s without any side effects. Even when Alani first came out, their pre-workout was fine. In 2020, I started to have some bizarre health issues after getting COVID and quit drinking pre-workouts during that time. In 2021, when Alani energy drinks came out, I fell for their great email marketing tactics and began drinking them regularly until I quit again in May 2022.

In April 2023, I started drinking Alani Nu energy drinks again because coffee was making me gain weight due to the creamer (I can’t stand the taste of black coffee). It was a busy year, and drinking two a day helped me push through. This is where I wish I had read more about what was going on with Alani Nu (I don’t follow fitness companies or many influencers).

This spring, I began experiencing weird joint issues that I attributed to previous injuries or overdoing it at the gym. Now, as I type this, every single one of my joints seems to be failing me. Since I stopped drinking Alani, I haven’t been able to sleep for more than three hours at a time before waking up and struggling to go back to sleep.

After several appointments with specialists and multiple ER trips, I’m stuck with no answers. My first ER visit showed that my blood was acidic and my liver enzymes were more than double what they had been during my last test. This was a few weeks after quitting, so I can’t imagine what they were while I was consuming the drinks. Now that I’m on Reddit and seeing others having issues with this company and how the owners are terrible, I wish I had ditched them long ago. I’m hoping that, with time, my joints will recover and my sleep will return to normal. Figured this might help anyone that is thinking twice about quitting energy drinks or even pre-workout. Just do it, your body will thank you down the road. 

Side Note: I reached out to Alani Nu because I read that guarana seed extract contains caffeine, and since the FDA classifies it as a “herbal supplement,” the added amount of caffeine doesn’t have to be labeled. Alani Nu energy drinks may contain more than the advertised 200 mg, but they would not disclose the total caffeine content. ",2,1728337960.0,gymsnark,1,0.67,False

I started drinking coffee when I was about 14 and it had a pretty strong effect on my mood in all these aspects. Of course, self-medication for the same depression is not particularly effective in the long term, and I already learned this from my own experience before I started taking mild antidepressants at 19, which evened out the situation. Now my mood is under control, my energy level is more or less normal, and I have fixed some memory and cognitive problems with the help of various supplements and nootropics. But I still can’t fix my problems with motivation and maintaining focus on one task. Only sweetened coffee helped me achieve this productive and focused state on tasks, it may sound silly, of course, but it is the only thing that helped me improve these problematic aspects.

The point is that coffee with sugar allows me to focus on one task for a long period of time, unlike regular coffee. I can completely immerse myself in a task and achieve that state of hyperfocus that I have experienced often throughout my life, and especially when I started drinking coffee at age 14. Starting at age 19, I cut out a large percentage of fast carbohydrates from my diet, including sugar from coffee for some reason, adjusted my diet, started exercising, and generally more or less optimized my body's processes. However, from that point on, and to this day (I'm 22 now), my executive function has declined significantly, I have definitely benefited from changing my diet and life in general. However, I have not experienced that hyperfocus since then, and my attention and motivation are not as strong or long-lasting as they used to be. I definitely get cognitive benefits from the nootropics I take from time to time like noopept, aniracetam, alpha-gpc, etc., but the ""desire and pleasure"" from completing a task and the flow state that I used to get from sweet coffee is something I haven't noticed for a long time and now it's more about willpower than desire. And I haven't found a single supplement that can mimic the effects of a cup of coffee with sugar.

I've never been diagnosed with ADHD, so the problem could be that or something else.

So I want to know what the problem could be, why is it something as simple as coffee with sugar that helps me with concentration and motivation the most? Of course, I'd like to find a healthier alternative to it. I don't know which subreddit is best to post this request in, so I'll post it in several for greater impact.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1fyjl1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1fyjl1i/alert_for_a_long_text_dont_read_if_it_bothers_you/,"📌Alert for a long text! Don't read if it bothers you, of course.(My therapist asked me to tell the story I used the same text) I have some doubts about my ex-boyfriend's manners. By demanding responsibilities from him, could I have triggered narcissistic behaviour? ","My F32 ex-boyfriend M39 (he is in a autistic spectrum, maybe this information is relevant, given that the topic is behavior.) seemed an introvert when I met him so I took the initiative of contacting also kissing on our first date, after a few weeks talking, which he later told me he took as a red flag; he told me that for him, things worked by going out for *""a coffee, then another coffee, and another coffee, and then...""*  He didn't finish the sentence, but it made me thoughtful because he had told me that in our previous conversation he had only been with only one person before me,  (in terms of kissing or having sex) according to him. But that day we repeated many times and after we left each other to go home, we kept talking and he told me it was nice and enjoyable;
On our second date, he said he already felt like he was in a relationship. Caveat: We were both equally open to it. The enthusiasm in the conversations was mutual, as it was for the schedules initially. But soon after, some arguments arose when I started to question him after observing some behaviours such as omissions, inconsistencies and a few lies. I think the justification for that may go beyond insecurity. Eg.: telling me he needed to go out to buy something when he was actually going out for a coffee with a friend.  At first, that was somewhat understandable, but as time goes on, it's natural we get more confident and leave the excuses. But it wasn't what happened in so many cases.
So I observed behaviours like that and would point them out to him with the intention of helping him understand that he could be transparent with me about what he wanted/needed, and that I would understand him.
And I kept realising that, and trying to do the same, so I was getting frustrated but I was trying to show him the best way would be to communicate better, and I asked for that several times. We just started having arguments. 
Then he would stop responding to my messages or would reply with gaps of several hours, which was not usual, however I assumed it was a little because of his autism (I mean the fact he chose to be quiet and refusing any type of communication, I got it as a difficulty to face the conflicts in order to solve them as I read). On the other hand, it seemed like an attempt at emotional manipulation. I started feeling like he was trying to manipulate me over time with silent treatments, in order to condition me to accept that kind of behavior. He said he distanced himself because I was being accusatory, but he refused to have any clarifying things properly, giving  short and evasive answers only, followed by silence and later saying he didn’t want to talk about that matter. Eventually, he refused to discuss anything related to us, claiming that I only talked about that, but that's not true, because we connected in the first place with common interests. I was insisting on clarification because it was bothering me, obviously.

I wrote to him several times in an attempt to resolve that because he refused to call or talk personally claiming to feel uncomfortable. 
He started saying I was just  interested in emotional drama and that I was being abusive, which sounds like gaslighting to me.
In order to break that loop, I invited him to reflect and ask himself why things were happening that way. And after some other unpleasant events, I suggested we go to therapy with the same professional. At one point, he briefly said he would think about it, but later replied that he didn’t want to.

Let's go back in time for a while: Knowing he had previously used dating apps, one day I asked if he still used them. Not only did he tell me he wasn't using that, but he also made a gesture of handing me his phone as proof that there was nothing there. That alerted me because it doesn't take much intelligence to know that doesn’t serve as proof. A few days later, I asked again, and then he told me that after one of our early arguments, he stopped believing our relationship would work and simply went back to using dating apps. So yes! He had underestimated my intelligence by handing me the phone then. 

Similar things happened regarding conversations with ""other people,"" and what seemed to me like simple things that could be resolved through dialogue became triggers for avoidance. He told me that when ""I started being like that,"" his mind started to go in other directions. I also heard something like ""I did things that must have discouraged you, and you didn’t leave."" Would that be an implicit hint? Why didn't he tell me what he wanted then? What do my readers understand as ""other directions""? HOWEVER...  I asked a few times if he wanted to continue meeting/getting involved with other  people because he conveyed this in previous conversations about people 
he was talking to when we met and his answer was: ""Sigh"", ""I'm not doing this conversation anymore, let's talk about music"", or simply nothing. So he never gave me the confidence that he had stopped talking to ppl who he used to flirt with. He even said he was still having some conversations with one of them  at some point (by the way, the one he had shown attraction for, and according to him, it wouldn’t work out because he had a “sexual hobby” that didn’t work for him, but he continued talking to her because he wanted to understand what she wanted from him. That was also during our relationship) I naturally asked questions about his feelings/ intentions towards that person (She lives at the same country he was going to live for a couple of months for some specific reason, well.... It's natural since he told me he started talking to them during the days we were in bad vibes. So he said I was jealous and he simply adopted an: ""I'm not talking to anyone,"" as a standard response for anything that referred to a similar subject.

*Just one more topic about ""I'm not talking to anyone"" Once, during one of our conversations when he was in a good mood, he mentioned that he basically only talked to family members and three friends, and months before he had said he had two or three female friends who lived in the UK / Corea and it was very rare for him to talk to them. I felt that his tone was defensive, which conveyed more insecurities. I don’t want to sound like a judgmental fool, but I will point out a few things and leave it to the reader to draw their own conclusions. The person had 'theoretically' stopped using dating apps after having used them for several years. He considers himself a nerd, and much of his life is online, with several social media accounts. It’s a bit strange to say he limits himself so much in chats. I asked a few questions trying not to sound invasive, but that’s the response I got. And then: I saw a few conversations, when he opened his Instagram one of them with a girl (from USA) btw and reactions with ""♥️"" although the subjects at least at that moment, the topics were generic. Discouraged, I just said in a sarcastic tune: *""Anyone is too little!""* He called me jealous, claiming they were just friends.. Actually the conversations were about general stuff. I don't believe that girl would even be interested in him in a romantic way (for reasons that I won't elaborate on further) but the conversation seemed very ""enthusiastic"". Before ppl ask me how I could see that and call me invasive.... I asked him for that and he showed me. 
And he told me: she’s my friend. (Wtf?) Further down, there were 3 or 4 more chats with girls, and I asked about the one closest to the bottom (he had done the same thing with me before when he saw my chat open, and I responded without any issues. The difference is that I never said I didn’t talk to anyone; on the contrary, I even mentioned a male friendship I made through a dating app in the past).

At the bottom was a conversation with one of his former students. Hey, it’s fine to have friendships with the opposite sex, but when you start hiding it... Bro? Why the insecurity at this level? Could they have been the targets of some previous flirting? (Maybe not just 'previous' 🤔)""
But my point wasn’t about the people or the conversations with them because of jealousy simply. Actually it was more related to the fact that he was always on the defensive, giving evasive answers and inconsistent justifications in various aspects of our conversations about topics like that. He used to say he basically was talking to five other people. I just asked him things like that because of the other manners, I already started to think that he was maintaining the relationship with me because it was 'real' at the moment, but he wanted to keep the possibility of something better or simply 'something' in case things didn’t work out between us. The traditional game of those who embrace the idea of fluid relationships. 
Could this behavior be partly related to the difficulty of resolving conflicts? That's it: instead of having a conversation with me about what was bothering him and what was bothering me, he simply tried to sweep it under the rug and avoid me. I struggled to believe that someone I admired precisely for showing me that they were above various types of behavioral neglect was choosing that path.
 I was kind of waiting for the person to face the reality because some behaviours seemed childish and therefore incompatible with the part of his personality that made me get interested. He used to present good arguments and articulated consistently on the general topics we discussed, which made our connection enjoyable initially.
 We enjoyed a good moment together of course.
Things heated up between us, like with any couple. The difference was that, by his choice, we didn’t have privacy, and he only agreed to go out in public places. That was okay for me, but after a few months, I suggested doing something different, like going camping or going somewhere that would allow us more privacy. This wasn’t necessarily for having sex, but we always went to pubs, for a walk in town, or to parks, which, although still public places, allowed us a few minutes of 'peace.'

We  had sex only once, for literally 3 seconds, and it caused him extreme concern about the condition of the condom (which was intact and fine) and a huge paranoia about all the negative possibilities.
We did that in a place without total privacy, and he was so worried while I was trying to calm down he disclaimed about the spot - a park -  but that was the only option we could think about. (📌 On that day, we had gone to that place somewhat prepared for it, and he even made some funny comments about it. I felt a bit embarrassed, but I was okay about it.)

After that, he told me he wouldn't be prepared to do that again anytime soon, I said ok but I didn't understand such a big block around it since he told me I used to make him uncontrollably horny and sex would be something dangerous. 
Days later he said something like ""I want you"", ""let's do whatever you want"", "" let's have sex"". He had a few beers that day and the next day he sounded like his changed his mind a little and in some time later he sent me a 15-min You-Tube video containing some basic principles of Geomancy. He told me he had asked some questions during that practice about whether he should have sex with me or not. He was looking for answers regarding a decision about a trip he was going to take related to professional matters.

I was willing to have patience with almost everything that would be different for me, but no cheating. I basically found myself wrestling with someone else's partially fictional universe.

He said emphatically: ""You ruined everything"" was his sentence when he saw me struggling against an end in that condition, bc letting a lack of communication create a society of monsters to destroy expectations and good feelings becomes sad, poor, even ridiculous. That's my ""doubt"" (if I really can call it doubt) because that represents a weak manipulation tactic usually used by neurotypicals lacking emotional intelligence or / and respect, but technically that doesn’t match him because he usually analyzes facts and situations more intelligently, in a high level common sense, I would say. At the same time I’m talking about a person who *literally* ran away a few times when I sought him out to have a conversation. 

Later, he started engaging in apparent narcissistic games, like singing while I was talking to him (I understand he was anxious about making a difficult decision for him in those days, but…) He complained that I only wanted to talk about relationship issues while he preferred to talk about movies or music, which sounded a bit bizarre to me; I wasn’t talking about problems because I enjoyed it but because I found it necessary to  clarify what was bothering me. And he seemed to start hating me and for a while I felt the same.

There were times when I went to see him (without us schedule it and I know that's not the best thing to do but he just stopped talking once again, I was sad, because I know there's a lot of better ways to solve that. I just wanted to have a decent conversation. Although I understood he got nervous and anxious with our issues.
One day I approached him saying, ""Hi, I'd like to talk. I know you're uncomfortable, but can we at least have a brief conversation?"" He seemed to hate me at that moment, but I insisted, telling him how disproportionate it was imo. He certainly interpreted many things from my side in a way that I didn't intend. He even said a few times he was paranoid; 
Naturally, people ask why I stayed. I wish I could have done something to change that *because/however/although* I can't see a logical reason for that set of strange manners. I got irritated in the process, and I made mistakes in how I treated him too, but nothing unforgivable to the point where I didn’t get any response, even if neutral.
So he told me that if I didn't leave, he would notify the police. I laughed ironically, but in a state of perplexity. Really? Something we could clear up over coffee, talking like the 30+ year-old adults we are. He started laughing in a strange way—nervous, sarcastic—and turned the corner. I asked where he was going, and he answered, ""To the police station."" I said, ""Really? I’ll go with you, and we can clarify the exact reasons driving you to do this, right?""
I couldn’t understand what led him to this extreme but wouldn’t allow him to have a conversation with me as the situation required. There were no screams, no violence, no offense or anything that would make the involvement of a police officer necessary imo. 
He claimed that I was ""following"" him. It was: I went to meet him on the same path we used to take when he was coming back from work. It was our way to the train station. We had an arrangement, and apparently, he wasn’t keeping it. I believe I had the right to understand what was going on. Simply blaming me, saying I was ruining the relationship, was neither fair nor sensible. I had some indications that he was seeing other women.
I never made any comment that would make him think it was a criterion for me that a man should only have had one woman /s or that he couldn't go out with a friend, or that someone couldn't have had a past or other loves. 

He also told me he felt threatened by the tone I used when I let him know I found out where he lives. 📌There we go: : we don’t live far from each other, there’s just one neighborhood separating ours, and a friend recognized him because he had seen us together and asked if I knew, and I responded that I only knew the general area. My friend was even a bit surprised because most people in relationships usually visit each other’s homes. But in our case, he would feel awkward about his parents and there are other implicit factors, like him having thought I might have some material interest, a different nationality, given that he also made it clear he held some prejudice toward people of my nationality (yeah... I know). This would be another barrier for certain things. I know that the way he processes some thoughts is very different from mine, and I let a lot of things slide because I believed time would help him feel more at ease with me. But his behavior went from 100 to 0 in some aspects towards me. The conversations got a strange tune, he started frequently giving up on our schedule; apparently, the inconsistencies about trivial day-to-day things were increasing in proportion.
There was a moment when we reconciled, and we exchanged an ""I love you,"" which once again came from me, but he reciprocated. Also, one day, when I suggested I might leave the country, he said he felt wrecked, empty... 
My understanding of that guy's motives fluctuates as much as his emotions and feelings, I think. In part, he was afraid of being left, so he preferred to do it first, as he did but in the process, he decided to inflate his ego by showing narcissistic traits. Did he use the fact that I chose to stay and try to fix things as a means to inflate his ego, seeing the opportunity to cheat?
He justifies the feelings I had for him by saying that this was the result of magic spells he did before we met. 
I've already put myself in his shoes several times, but I don’t know if he has the same ability. 
I was disappointed and perplexed by his reaction to my attempt to talk + he had said that his friends advised him to stay away from me. Did his account contain valid justifications for my dissatisfaction? I don't think so
So I wrote a text similar to this one for his friend, slightly shorter than this, telling what would be 'my version' of the events. And probably now he hates me because of that. 
Any comments on the subject are welcome, except about the length of the text, as I'm aware that it’s worthy of a magazine article, lol

1fyjjvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1fyjjvx/friendship_and_changing_expectations/,friendship and changing expectations?,"I made a friend from work more  than 5 years ago, we quickly 'clicked' and became very close. There was a time where we spent hours talking about random topics and major/minor things going on in our lives, sharing our perspectives, opinions, past experiences and it was great. We have a lot in common and a few personality differences - I am more independent,  looking for/needing less social validation, and just generally less feelings-oriented, while she's more emotional, neurotic and socially motivated - she very much values relationship and emotional connection above most things. It didn't cause any problems for a long time because we both appreciated and learned from each other's perspectives. She would listen and energetically engage when I have some novel, new interests or experience to rant about, and I would be there for her when she has a tough or vulnerable moments, and provide a calm perspective or reassurance that she needs.

Now that worked well when we were in our mid-late 20s, had few responsibilities, many things in adulting life we were making sense of, and tons of time to spare. In the last 1-2 years that has no longer been the case for me. I started to get challenged with some real hard adult life stuff - taking care of a sick parent who lives with me, becoming a parent myself (soon!), dealing with unexpected tragedies, growing with my increasingly demanding job etc. I just don't have as much time or energy to spare, so I started to bring up things less, politely cut conversations short, respond less frequently to random texts (that arent urgent or important). Her life has mostly remained the same, her parents are luckily healthy, she doesnt plan to have kids, she's been working at the same job/company for years, which is all fine and great to me. I see the division brewing where she still somewhat expects and wants the same close, frequent and emotional connections, and as it looks like i'm not offering as much, she's doubling down on texts, bids for attention and validations, which starts to become a source of irritation rather than joy and comfort for me. Sometimes it feels like she's prying for me to open up (asking how i feel just one too many times before i even have the time to know how i feel), share something with the implicit expectations that I should validate her feelings that she is doing the right thing, and if i share anything, she's overly validating and affirming before i even finish the story, which makes me wanna share even less. Our friendship doesn't feel as organic and fun any more and has become an avoider-chaser relationship thats probably not enjoyable for anyone. I have still done my best to show up positively and politely when i do because i would hate to hurt her feelings, but behind the scene sometimes just seeing a message coming from her fills me with dread. Most likely another tedious/mundane or over the topc feeling on something random and unconsequential. I really don't want to feel that way.

As I take a step back and reflect on it, I have a maybe naive hope that we can still make this right and establlish a new understanding of where we're individually at and how our friendship will look at this time in our lives. It is not her fault to want the emotional connection - that is essential to who she is and I do appreciate that about her. But I and my life have changed, so it just can't be the same. I have a few tactical ideas - suggesting less aimless texting and more in person coffee dates/calls to catch up that has a start and end time, assuring her that im still here when she needs me but drawing some boundaries on what i want and dont want to do/talk about, giving her direct feedback on not 'prying' anymore and let me come to her when i feel like it (i probably would more often if i werent pried open like a clam lol). 

Have any of you navigated similar friendship dynamics changes and challenges? How did you do it - renew your friendship, set new boundaries, maybe even bringing up a complaint, to your probably lovely, well meaning, frustrating friend who cant read your mind and adapt to changes without you having to spell it out clearly:))?",1,1728337416.0,AskWomenOver30,0,1.0,False

-been snus’ing since like 2008. 

- was on the camel frost for a long time, like 12 years, but quit because I got freaked about long term tobacco use. Then I discovered On!  And the low dose 2mg , got absolutely hooked when they were like 3 for 5 bucks. It was insane, so cheap, No tobacco, so I figured ah this amazing! 

-I rolled that way for a few years, I was always like a 3/4 tin a day , but did quit a couple times when they’d hike the price, only to inevitably get back on them. 

-year ago a buddy of mine gave me a Rogue on a camping trip and I was instantly in love (god those things are tasty) … low dose only 3mg. Just enough to rip all day long during work and stuff. 

-this last year I have been so f’ing hooked on Rogue spearmint and peppermint, I was eventually doing a tin and a half a day to 2 tins PER DAY. Yea…30 to 40 pouches a day. I was literally spitting them out and putting one in 60 seconds later at times. Oh…..And they are almost $10 bucks a can where I live!!!! 

-couple months ago my upper inside of lips and gums started peeling and when I’d wake up they were dry as sandpaper. Just a disgusting feeling , yet I kept ripping ‘em starting right after my first cup of coffee all the way til right before bed. 

-with the lip peeling and just completely being a slave to such a stupid fucking addiction…. I said enough is enough. 

-I am on day 4 of cold turkey. First day I was crabby as shit and craving hard. Toes tapping and fidgeting type craving. Those have subsided and my mood is actually way better than while I was using them. Sleep has been absolutely horrendous, basically just wired in bed in my head even though my body is tired. Last night was marginally better. But the sleep has really been the worst of my side effects (thankfully I guess?) seeing as some people are having a pretty rough go. 

-even without sleeping great I feel so much better already. Calmer, heart rate lower, saving 20 bucks a day can make anyone smile, my lips are completely fine feeling already, that only took a couple days to heal. So nice!

Anyway just wanted to post this to give some hope. Maybe because I wasn’t hammering super high MG’s it’s not as bad for me, I don’t know, but the quantity I was consuming was insane. So if I can do it you can too. ",8,1728337259.0,QuittingZyn,0,1.0,False

1fyj70z,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RiveraRamos/comments/1fyj70z/wrestlorama/,Wrestlorama,"Chapter 4.5: The Enlightenment of Wrestling Physics

The bell rang through the halls of Wrestlorama Academy, signaling the start of a very special class. Students shuffled in, whispers filling the room with anticipation. This wasn’t just any class. No, this was Physics of the Ring—a course legendary for explaining the very essence of what made Wrestlorama so… unique.

As the students settled into their seats, the door swung open with theatrical flair, and in strutted the one, the only…

Professor Edgar Sandow—The Intellectual Savior of Wrestlorama. Dressed in his velvet robe, complete with a golden sash, his hair slicked back, and monocle perched perfectly on his nose, Sandow exuded a grandiose air of superiority. He paused dramatically at the front of the room, basking in the awe and confusion radiating from his audience.

“Ah, finally,” Sandow began, his voice smooth yet dripping with self-importance. “You have arrived at the moment of enlightenment, where your minds shall be opened to the true brilliance of Wrestlorama’s physics. Do not fear, young plebeians, for I, Professor Edgar Sandow, shall elevate your understanding beyond the simple confines of… ordinary existence.”

He stopped, his gaze piercing through the room before slowly turning toward you—yes, you, the reader.

“Ah, yes, I see you there,” Sandow said, pointing directly at you, breaking the fourth wall with a knowing smirk. “I suppose you’ve been following along with the story, haven’t you? Watching as these wrestlers perform feats of athleticism that, dare I say, seem almost impossible? Well, dear reader, it’s time you, too, understood the secret behind it all.”

He gestured grandly to the blackboard behind him, where the words WRESTLING PHYSICS were written in bold letters, surrounded by a chaotic array of chalk lines and exaggerated diagrams of suplexes, dropkicks, and high-flying elbow drops.

“Wrestlorama is not bound by the trivial laws of real-world physics,” Sandow declared, spinning dramatically on his heel to face the class and you. “Oh no, no, no! Here, we have our own unique set of rules—rules designed to amplify the grandeur, the spectacle, and the absurdity of professional wrestling to heights you’ve never dreamed of. Let me educate you!”

With a flick of his wrist, Sandow grabbed a piece of chalk and drew a quick sketch of a wrestler mid-suplex, their opponent suspended in mid-air, body contorted as if gravity itself had taken a coffee break.

“First and foremost, let’s talk about Momentum,” Sandow continued, spinning the chalk in his hand with an impressive flourish. “In your pedestrian world, momentum is the product of mass and velocity. How quaint. But here, in Wrestlorama, momentum is governed not just by physical properties—oh no, it’s directly tied to your wrestling spirit!”

He jabbed the chalk toward you again, as if this were the most profound revelation in history.

“In this world, the more emotionally invested you are in your move, the more energy, power, and—dare I say it—oomph that move will have. Observe!”

Sandow snapped his fingers, and a holographic projection appeared above him. It showed Ricardo Taino Ramos executing a perfect suplex, except in the hologram, Taino’s determination caused his opponent to be suspended in mid-air for an extended moment before being slammed into the mat with exaggerated force, the ring vibrating like a trampoline.

“Behold!” Sandow crowed. “The physics of Wrestlorama are shaped by sheer willpower! The more a wrestler believes in their move, the more momentum it gains, often launching opponents halfway across the ring as if propelled by invisible rockets! Marvelous, isn’t it?”

He turned to the board again, erasing the suplex and replacing it with a drawing of a wrestler soaring through the air, cape fluttering dramatically behind them. The words MAGNITUDE & SPECTACLE were written beneath it.

“Now, let’s address Magnitude,” Sandow said, pacing in front of the board like a lion surveying his domain. “Magnitude, dear students—and reader—is the size, the scale, the spectacle of a move. In the mundane world, magnitude might be determined by the force of impact or weight behind a blow. How… dull.”

He waved his hand dismissively.

“In Wrestlorama, magnitude is directly linked to audience reaction! The louder the crowd roars, the higher you soar! If the audience is on the edge of their seats, if they believe in you, then the move grows in scale—turning a simple clothesline into a devastating collision that could topple mountains!”

Sandow snapped again, summoning another hologram. This time, it showed Taino performing a springboard dropkick, but as the crowd’s cheers grew louder, the kick gained more power, launching his opponent out of the ring in a dramatic spiral.

“Ah, yes! The feedback loop between wrestler and crowd—a symbiotic relationship that defies all known laws of physics! One cannot simply measure a move’s impact by Newton’s laws here. No, we go beyond Newton into the realm of wrestling greatness!”

He pointed dramatically at the ceiling, as if Newton himself might descend from the heavens to argue, but alas, no one interrupted his tirade.

“But let’s not forget the most important factor of all: Madness,” Sandow continued, his voice dropping into a conspiratorial whisper as he leaned over the podium. “In Wrestlorama, chaos is not the enemy, my dear students. Madness is where we truly thrive.”

He paused, his eyes narrowing, clearly building up to something big.

“Let me break it down for you simpletons!” he shouted suddenly, causing several students (and probably you) to jump in their seats. “In this world, the more outrageous, the more absurd your move, the more likely it is to succeed! A spinning corkscrew moonsault from the top of a 20-foot ladder? Why, that’s practically guaranteed to win the match!”

He drew a wild diagram on the board, this one depicting a wrestler performing a gravity-defying, mid-air cartwheel into a corkscrew piledriver, the sheer ridiculousness of which seemed to increase its likelihood of landing.

“You see, here in Wrestlorama, the line between the possible and the impossible doesn’t just blur—it vanishes entirely! Moves that would seem absurd or impractical in any other world become routine here. Why, you ask? Because wrestling is not just a sport—it’s an art form! It’s storytelling, drama, and athleticism combined into one glorious package!”

Sandow spun around, addressing you and the class directly once again.

“So, dear reader, the next time you wonder why someone can leap off the top rope and practically hover in mid-air before crashing down on their opponent, know that it’s because this world celebrates the impossible. Wrestlers here channel the spirit of wrestling itself, bending the rules of gravity, momentum, and logic to their will!”

He tossed the chalk into the air and caught it smoothly, his final flourish.

“Now, remember this, all of you: Wrestlorama is not bound by your pedestrian understanding of reality. Here, the laws of wrestling physics are the only truth that matters. Moves become more powerful with belief, greater with spectacle, and downright unstoppable when infused with a healthy dose of madness.”

He gave a smug smile, brushing imaginary dust from his robes.

“You’re welcome.”

With that, Professor Sandow straightened his monocle, gave a small bow to his students, and turned toward the door. But just before leaving, he looked over his shoulder, his voice smooth and dripping with satisfaction.

“Now, back to the action. I believe a match is about to reach its… breaking point.”

And with a dramatic flourish, Professor Sandow exited the room, leaving the students—and you—more enlightened, and perhaps a little more prepared for the madness that was Wrestlorama.

My wife and I ( late 20s ) have different groups of friends from different backgrounds and we have been struggling to make time for them as our life gets super busy. We’d plan to meet up, but between work, responsibilities, and everything else, our schedules never lined up. It started feeling like a chore to plan something that most of the time just fell through.

Until we thought: maybe instead of overplanning, we could just live our lives, let people know what we’re up to and join if they want to. So we started just sending a quick “Hey, we’re grabbing a coffee if anyone wants to join” or “We’ll be home tonight if you want to stop by.” We’ve had more spontaneous hangouts with friends and managed to squeeze more of them in our busy life.

We both work in the tech industry and we couldn’t resist creating a little web app to make it easier to notify them. Basically you can easily share what you’re up to with your favorite people, they can let you know if they want to join and otherwise they don’t even need to answer.

We’ve been testing it with our friends, and it’s working well so far. We found that even if they don’t join, at least they get some news about what we are doing, which is great to keep the connection alive.

If anyone’s interested, the app is called JoinIfYouWant and you can find it there: [https://joinifyouwant.com](https://joinifyouwant.com). We would love to get some feedback and we are curious to know how you are balancing a busy adult life while finding time to see friends!",10,1728336526.0,Adulting,2,0.92,False

Tuesday,8october 2024

The farms converted to outskirts and more and more lights we visible we took a break to have dinner, well I had a cold coffee and some fries so I don't think that's a proper dinner but for some reason I really didn't want to eat. We took takeout and sat again in the car. Now that we had dropped my uncle and aunt the car wasn't so cramped anymore the whole backseat was mine my legs could finally stretch. I was listening to some music and before I knew it I was asleep. I wake up to my mom calling me we reached home...
We unloaded the luggage and got inside. My body hurts my legs feel like falling out and my whole body is cramped after making my bed I decided to take a bath. I don't know if it helped or not but at least I feel clean now.
I am tired but I can sleep I guess really want to tire my body so that I don't have to got to school tomorrow or maybe it's the unanswered questions that keep me awake


Charecter x has become a part of me for the past few years it worked good my friends who are not friends anymore liked me. X is made of nothing but lies, x speaks nothing but lies. I really liked the sense of security it gave me I could just lie about anything through x.
After lock down x started playing a bigger role in my life. I never had good grades Bs and Cs always an occasional D too but to my classmates I was a grade A student and they liked that about me. For the past two year this went on until a week ago...


I am now in 11th grade and the subjects are a lot more harder but if I want to persue my dream I have to study them. We at the starting of the year I decided to become a straight A student for real but somewhere I stopped doing that I indulged back to my old habits. I know my teachers know about my situation, I know my parents know about it as well but my peers didn't and they always complimented me ""you are so smart"", ""dude you have to tell me how you study"". I surround myself with this, I created a false reality for myself....


A week ago my midterms got over my family had a trip planned the next week my aunts family was visiting so we decided to go to the hillside a road trip. I knew how I had done in my midterms, only one word to discribe it terrible. 

I didn't go to school on Monday cause we were supposed to get our answer sheets. I was trying to avoid it, maybe if I don't go to school today I won't see my answer sheets, after the trip I will and lie to everyone I will do better next time a line I always tell myself but never follow.

Well around 4 my friend texted me hey call me it's urgent. I called and he said
""dude are you okay we got our answer sheet the teachers announced all the marks you have failed in all your main subjects, you've got the lowest in class""
He tried to comfort me and say you will do better next time and he believed in me. He is the only friend I have right now or at least I think so. After hearing his words I cried I failed my midterm what if I fail my whole grade I would be required to repeat a year. My brain spiraled out of control. Before I knew it it was 6 my parents were about to reach home, my eyes were swollen, my face was red, I cleaned myself up and went downstairs after an hour of pondering and wandering my face was now normal I went back home didn't tell my parents anything. at night i couldn't sleep I was thinking what would everyone think of me and that's when it snapped to me


More than my grades more than anything else I was worried what would others think of me I had adjusted so well in my false reality that now that it's broken I don't understand anything I don't know what to do.....

On Tuesday I didn't go to school told mom nothing important was happening today and decided to pack for the trip. The day passed in a blink of an eye I don't remember what I did when my parents returned home I decided to tell my mom. She did not show it but I could tell she was crushed,worried about me and my future. We decided not to tell dad and went on the trip

Charecter x showed up on the trip too. Not a spec of worry was shown on my face I was enjoy to the fullest but deep inside I felt like dieing....

Now it's 2:55 I am laying in my bed writing this post I should be sleeping but I can't. I don't know what will happen tomorrow

He had just received another rejection email for a job he thought he was perfect for. Anger surged through him, hot and consuming, until it felt like he might explode.

In that moment, something unusual happened. A sudden jolt coursed through his body, and the world around him warped. Colors blurred, sounds distorted, and then, silence.

Ethan found himself standing in a nursery, the walls painted a soft blue, adorned with cheerful animal decals. He looked down to see tiny hands gripping the edges of a crib. Confused, he realized he was a baby, barely able to control his emotions or understand what was happening. He let out a wail of frustration, the weight of his adult worries slipping away, replaced by the simple hunger and discomfort of infancy.

The scene shifted again, and he was now a teenager, awkward and gangly, standing in a high school hallway. A group of kids laughed at him from across the room, and a familiar sense of rage bubbled up. He wanted to confront them, to show them he was more than the outcast they saw. But instead, he felt trapped in this moment, unable to change anything.

With another jolt, he leapt into adulthood, his mid-twenties. He was in an office, surrounded by coworkers who whispered and pointed fingers. He could feel the weight of expectations pressing down on him, the anger rising as he remembered the struggles he faced every day, fighting for respect and recognition. He slammed his fist on the desk, but it only echoed in his mind.

Suddenly, he was thrust into a retirement home, now an old man. Wrinkles lined his face, and memories of missed opportunities washed over him. The anger had transformed into a profound sadness. He longed for the vitality of his youth, for the chances he had let slip away. The anger he had felt in his prime felt misplaced now, irrelevant against the backdrop of years gone by.

Each jump through time became a lesson in perspective. The baby learned the helplessness of rage, the teenager felt the sting of social rejection, the young adult wrestled with ambition, and the old man reflected on lost time. Ethan began to understand that anger, while a powerful emotion, could not change the past nor dictate the future.

In one final surge, he found himself back in his apartment, heart pounding, thoughts racing. The email still sat on his computer, but now it felt less like a weight and more like a stepping stone. He took a deep breath, let the anger dissipate, and instead focused on the possibilities ahead.

With newfound clarity, he started typing a response, not just to the rejection but to himself. He would embrace every part of his journey—baby, teenager, adult, old man—and use it to fuel his next steps forward.",2,1728336393.0,ChatGPT,1,1.0,False

3. In a different mixing bowl, mix together the milk, oil, eggs, vanilla, and sourdough discard. Whisk until the sourdough discard is fully dissolved and everything is fully incorporated

4. While stirring continuously, slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry until the batter is as lump free as possible.

 5. Pour the hot coffee in and stir, scraping down the sides as needed, until your ingredients are fully combined. The batter will be very thin, this is just how we want it!

Like many people, I didn’t start out with weight issues. I was always pretty active, but life has a way of catching up to you—especially after college when the 9-to-5 routine kicks in. Over time, I found myself sitting at a desk all day, snacking out of stress, and feeling the pounds slowly creep up on me.

I tried it all—diets, gym memberships, apps to count calories—you name it. Some things worked for a little while, but nothing really stuck. To be honest, I was losing hope of ever feeling like my old self again. But then something happened that changed my perspective.

**A Weekend Brunch That Changed Everything**

A few months ago, I met up with an old friend, Jessica. We hadn’t seen each other in ages, and when she walked into the brunch spot, I almost didn’t recognize her. She looked amazing. Not only had she lost weight, but she seemed happier, healthier, and just full of energy. Naturally, I had to ask what her secret was.

Jessica told me about this thing called Nagano Tonic. At first, I was skeptical. I’ve seen my fair share of “miracle” weight-loss products, and they usually end up being all hype and no substance. But Jess wasn’t just talking about losing pounds. She explained how Nagano Tonic was different—it was all about balancing metabolism, controlling cravings, and even helping manage stress. I wasn’t convinced yet, but her story had me curious enough to look into it.

**The Research That Made Me Try It**

I did some digging, reading up on Nagano Tonic’s ingredients and how it worked. What really caught my attention was that it wasn’t just another fad supplement. The ingredients were all natural, which was a big deal for me. I’ve always been wary of putting weird chemicals into my body.

The formula includes things like green tea extract to boost metabolism, Garcinia Cambogia to reduce cravings, and Ashwagandha, an herb that helps with stress. That last one was especially important to me because my stress levels were through the roof—and, of course, stress eating was a major problem for me.

Feeling a bit more confident, I ordered my first bottle.

**My First Taste and What Happened Next**

Okay, real talk: I was expecting this thing to taste terrible. I’ve tried health drinks before, and they usually taste like I’m punishing myself. But Nagano Tonic? Not at all. It has this light, refreshing flavor with natural herbs and spices. Drinking it didn’t feel like a chore—it was actually a nice part of my morning routine. I started replacing my usual coffee with the tonic, and it gave me this smooth energy boost without the jitters or the crash later in the day.

I wasn’t sure what to expect in terms of results. I knew it wasn’t going to melt the weight off overnight, and I didn’t have unrealistic expectations. But after just a week or two, I started noticing some subtle changes. First, my cravings—especially for junk food—were way down. Normally, I’d be reaching for a snack every few hours, especially in the afternoons. But with Nagano Tonic, I felt fuller for longer and didn’t feel the need to constantly munch on something.

And the energy? Wow. I’ve never been a morning person, but suddenly, I was waking up with more energy and actually looking forward to my workouts. Running didn’t feel like a chore anymore—I had this natural boost that made it easier to stay active.

**15 Pounds Later: What I’ve Learned**

Fast forward a few months, and I’ve lost around 15 pounds. But here’s the thing: it wasn’t just about the weight loss. Sure, I’m thrilled to fit into clothes I haven’t worn in years, but more importantly, I feel better than I have in a long time. My energy levels are higher, my stress is more manageable, and I’m not constantly battling cravings or feeling like I’m depriving myself.

One of the things I appreciate most about Nagano Tonic is that it’s not a quick-fix solution. This isn’t about dropping pounds fast and then gaining them back as soon as you stop. It’s about building healthier habits and supporting your body’s natural processes. It’s sustainable, and that’s what’s made it work for me.

**Is It Worth It? Here’s My Take**

For me, trying Nagano Tonic was 100% worth it. I’ve tried so many things over the years, but this is the first time I’ve found something that feels sustainable and actually helps me in a holistic way. It’s not just about weight loss—it’s about feeling more in control of my health overall. And the fact that it’s all-natural made me feel good about what I was putting into my body.

One more thing: they offer a 180-day money-back guarantee. I figured if it didn’t work, at least I could get my money back. But I’m glad to say I didn’t need to. Nagano Tonic has become a regular part of my wellness routine, and I’m grateful for the changes it’s helped me make.

**Final Thoughts**

If you’re feeling like nothing is working and you’re tired of yo-yo dieting or struggling to stick to a routine, I’d recommend giving Nagano Tonic a try. It wasn’t a magic fix, but it was the missing piece that helped me turn things around. **At the very least, you’ve got nothing to lose with the money-back guarantee. For me, it was the start of a healthier, happier chapter in my life.** [**https://naganotonic.com/**](https://freezegluco.com/Naganoleanbodytonic.html)",1,1728336069.0,PopularSupplements,0,1.0,False

My symptoms aren't that bad, I can eat pretty much anything without a problem, the silent reflux, burping, bloating seem to be the worst problems. But I can drink lemon juice, Betaine HCL, even watered-down apple cider vinegar (vinegar hurts very little).

But the moment I drink anything that has caffeine in it, it's like my body can't handle it. If I'm not mistaken, lemon juice is much more acidic than coffee but I can handle water with lemon, lemonade, etc just fine. After I drink something with caffeine my stomach will be in pain for days. Will feel like I did an ab workout. Almost like little needles.

1fyizdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1fyizdg/3_months_hard_mode_ama_and_reflecting/,3 months hard mode. AMA and Reflecting,"Hey everyone. So, as the headline says, I've reached 3 months on hard mode (so no MO either). I am 23M and I've discovered this community and the movement already 2 years back and since then had many medium-length streaks but always relapsed. Then, at some point, I said to myself: enough is enough. And it finally worked. So, I want to tell you some advice that helped me out. Lets go

**What worked and what didnt.**

First of all, there has been a big discussion about counting days, where some people encourage and others discourage it. For me, it has been quite helpful because it turned the whole experience into something of a game. Maybe its just me.

Also, being around family and friends and reducing time alone has been great. Bc you will probably not even think about doing the deed while you are with other people.

Reducing social media to a minimum has been incredibly helpful. Like all people, the algorithms are way smarter than I am so I would always find myself mindlessly scrolling on IG, tik tok, etc for hours on end. Then I decided that I need a little help with discipline. I use an app called Opal (but there are probably others out there) that essentially blocks the apps you select during selected day time periods. And there is no way around it. So, I allowed myself 30 min of IG per day, where I would check my messages, etc. Honestly, insane help for NoFap but also generally for life. Check it out for yourselves, I can only recommend these kinds of apps.

And of course, something that is obvious, educating yourself on the true harm of pornography. Your brain will try to convince you that it is harmless to do it a little bit. But the truth is, its like heroin. One time is one time too many. Instead of dying physically (like with hard drugs) you die inside. I have thought so much about this and I have realized that pornography has fried my brain completely, as I have been using it since I was about 12. The negative effects it had on my life are countless. But that is a whole different post.

**What changed in these 3 months**

First of all, No, i did not get any superpowers. I think that people who spread information like that, (you get x ray vision and all the girls in your vicinity fall into your arms type shit) actually make it worse because thats what some people expect when starting nofap. Remember, you still have to work to improve yourself physically and socially. You will not suddenly go from being a skinny-fat, social-anxiety ridden gremlin to Chad himself just because you stopped touching yourself for a bit. Sounds harsh but thats the reality. And thats how its supposed to be. If it was easy, everyone would do it, right.

What really changed is that I can notice less anxiety and definitley more mental stability. More desire to go out rather than stay in (and I dont only mean go out partying, also things like going to lectures at uni instead of staying in and skipping them, hitting up and meeting someone you havent seen in a long time for a coffee, going for a walk and sitting down for a coffee (even alone) on a lazy Sunday afternoon instead of just watching movies at home, etc). Also, I guess more motivation to change the other issues in your life. I wholly agree with the point that so many others made in this group about PMO being a veil that conceals all the other issues you have in your life because you use it as an escape. When you stop, you suddenly have to face all those issues without a crutch. And then the only thing to do is to work to solve them. And I think that is the biggest value of doing it.

Generally, when you do NoFap, you are not doing something extraordinary for yourself. You are just stopping what is basically daily self-abuse and going back to becoming normal, to becoming what you are supposed to be.

**So, what is next?**

I think the best part of NoFap being a 90 days challange is that at the beginning you only commit yourself to this limited time period, because you believe (if you don't, youre better than I am) that you are giving up an activity that brings you a lot of pleasure, but only for some time. Not forever. And that makes it much easier for so many people to start. Even people who dont think they have an issue who might think ""I just want to prove to myself that I can do it"". But, the beautiful thing is, after 90 days, I have absolutely no desire or any urge to go back to it. I honestly believe that I've kicked it forever. And I think that is one of the best decisions I've made in my life.

If i could do it - so can you.

To be honest, I'm super tired of people playing Spotify or Pandora or what have you at coffee shops, etc. Most of the time if I bring up the song playing to someone working there (who assumedly might have put it on), they don't even know what it is and they're not even connected to it. They're just like ""it's on my playlist."" Or like, the songs repeat. Right now I'm at a coffee shop where a song playing played before less than 30 minutes ago. This is so annoying!

For real, I'm kind of tired of EVERY place I go into playing music. Are people so into shutting others out and avoiding their own thoughts that on top of having a phone, they need music blaring, too?

I personally think there should be a decibel limit at establishments because at certain places even if I'm on a date or with a friend I can't even hear them over the music, and at some venues I'm generally worried about hearing loss, even with ear plugs. But especially for those without. Like if someone works at a noisy bar continually, won't they go deaf early?

Also, I will say it's super cool to be in vinyl shops because the media is tangible, some albums bring back memories, and it's fun to explore new songs and talk to the owners/other patrons.",0,1728335682.0,GNV,0,0.15,False

1fyir9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Enneagram/comments/1fyir9w/what_would_you_type_me_as/,What would you type me as?,"I’ve taken both the 16 personalities test and the enneagram test a few times over the years.

Consistently I am both an ENTP and an 8w9. 

I’m open to the idea that I am mistyped, although from what I know, I relate to both well. However, I am not well versed in the subject. 

Overall, I’m just interested in this topic as a whole and how I relate to it. 

I don't know if this is the right place to ask and learn about this. 

So below is my best take at describing who I am. (Edit: turned out longer than expected, there is a TLDR at the bottom.)



Whether I am introverted or extroverted can change based on circumstances. If I’m interested in the topic, I may be one of the most talkative people in the room. Willing and happy to clash ideas with others, and excited to see if I’m proven wrong. I won’t hesitate to disagree with anyone if I truly do (I won’t disagree for the sake of it though). Whether they be a peer or someone in an authoritative position like a teacher. I want my understanding to grow, and I will proclaim my worldview forward until it shatters against something better. 

Even if my thoughts are changed by a revelation of new knowledge, logic or facts being presented to me. This does not necessarily mean I will agree with the conclusion, provided the facts leave the option for different conclusions. I will however gladly throw away my old conclusion if it is proven wrong or unlikely. I will assimilate the new knowledge gained from my discussions with others and develop my world view. I like truth, theoretical physics, space, religion, philosophical things, and also silly things like lore in video games or anime. I day dream often and I like abstract ideas.

Often times I need a reason to talk to someone, I likely will not talk for talkings sake. I am comfortable with silence. 

On the other hand, the purpose behind talking doesn’t always have to be educational, perhaps I want to make someone laugh, or be hyped about a common interest, or make them feel loved or comforted. 

I will burn and have burnt bridges with little or no hesitation. Friendships of many years, I can cut off with a single text and never talk to them again. I don’t feel bad about it nor feel social anxiety around doing so. It’s easy. I don’t really care if what I say hurts, though I don’t tailor my words to harm, my words will be my blunt thoughts on the matter. I wouldn’t cut someone out of my life with no reason however. They would have had to no longer align with my life in some way. Whether it be harming my loved ones, myself, or excessively immoral behavior in general. Honestly, I could see myself ending a friendship over being too time consuming as well. 

I am VERY picky with my time. I simply am not interested enough in most people to talk to them unless it’s about something I am interested in. Although, people’s feelings are things I am interested in, I would gladly be there for someone to vent to me. If someone needs my help, even if they are an acquaintance, I will be there for them. My thought process on this can even be odd to me. If I am doing something for someone, “it’s just my time”. Being able to use my time to help someone is the best use case for it. I guess I feel like I got my money’s worth for my time in those cases. However if someone is talking to me about something I do not care for, or they somehow limit or remove my control over my time, I can become annoyed quickly.

I found my group, I’m happy with my group. I don’t have any desire to make any new close friends. I do have a desire to meet people and learn about their view points, but I do not want more out of them. If I have time to hang out, I’ll see if one of my current friends has time to do so. If not, I’m happy to do my own thing as well. I don’t want to get new friends and then have overlaps or have my time constrained in any manner.

 Lack of control over my time is probably one of the only things that can annoy me greatly. I don’t have any desire to control others, but my time is sacred to me. I must have control over how I spend it. 

When I walk into a room of strangers, I typically get on good terms with everyone fast, I stay focused on whatever reason we are meeting, I will lead it if no one else does, although I won’t fight to lead it. I’m neutral to leadership. If someone else is the leader but I feel it’s being lead off track or they are wrong, I will say so, although I typically never end up on bad terms with them when I do disagree. I do try to speak kindly, but always true to what I know to be true. 

I don’t view disagreements as bad or negative. I can actively enjoy them. I affirm the facts they use, I bring my understanding or information forward and see how our minds mixing and clashing brings us closer to the truth. I don’t get upset at being proven wrong (If they mix in insults I may get tilted still though). I also do not care for emotional arguments and will likely brush them aside. Excessive use of emotional arguments may affect the respect I have for that person. Unless the conversation is innately about emotions, in which case an emotional argument is valid. If I made you feel a certain way, and my goal is to make you happy, I’d of course hear out the emotional argument, since in that context the emotions are the facts and good feelings are the goal.

I’ve always been the guy everyone is on good terms with, but not close to anyone in particular. In school I would follow those talking about what I already was interested in, or I would form my own group if there was none. I don’t particularly care for social hierarchy one way or another. I have been told that I probably have issues with authority, as I treat everyone as if they were my peer. 

I just don’t view others as being in a position of authority over me. Sure, some people can affect my life in ways, I could be fired, I could get a bad grade or expelled, etc… but it’s my life, it’ll turn out just fine, because I know I’m in control of it. There isn’t a thing anyone could do about that. You could shoot me, but I know my actions led me to where I am, I lived my life as me and that’s a success. I’ll always be victorious. Much like being wrong in a debate is just me learning. It’s just the opening and closing of some doors and I choose which door to go to next. 

I have fought and would still fight others to protect someone else. I do not stand for injustice. If someone is being hurt, I will be on the assailant very quickly.

I genuinely thought I’d probably live my life celibate, as the idea of finding someone who interested me enough to be with them forever seemed ridiculously impossible. Then I found my now wife, from the moment I first met her, it felt as if I was partaking in my favorite interest or activities. I still feel that way now 5 years later. She is an interest of mine. I’d happily spend all of my time on her. She definitely became apart of that exclusive club of things that I desire to spend my time on, whether it be talking, walking, getting her a coffee, whatever it may be, if it relates to her, it’s what I want and I’d do anything to continue it. As a lover, I’m very much a lovey dovey guy who fawns over his wife. 

I can be outgoing and spontaneous. I can also be a homebody and very habitual. I’m decisively one or the other depending on the goal. If we are going outside, I’m going to try new things (I’m especially a sucker for seasonal things or events). I can be an adrenaline junky and may advocate to ride every possible roller coaster (though I wouldn’t force it). My goal would be for everyone to enjoy the adventure to the fullest. If I’m staying in, I’m doing all my favorite and normal things I know I like to do. I don’t have a preference between doing my normal routine or breaking it. Although I could see that continuously going out to places could eventually be tiresome and I’d want to recharge at home.

When working, I work in burst. These aren’t organized, organization is not my strong suit. There is a method to my madness, but it’s very messy. I can sometimes complete a whole week’s worth of task in a day, or I can struggle to do the most basic thing for hours. The greatest killer of my motivation and inspiration is when a relatively easy, uninteresting and tedious task comes up. Although I can do monotonous repetitive work with ease, especially physical labor doesn’t bother me. But when doing mental work, I excel with being asked to do a new inventive task, but if it’s some sort of slog work with multiple yet clearly different steps to it… I struggle. 

------------------------------------------

TLDR: 

My time is sacred to me. 

I can be very extroverted or introverted depending on circumstances. 

I may disagree and converse with pretty much any person of any status. I don’t do this for the sake of disagreeing but for the sake of an ultimate understanding or truth of the matter. If this pursuit of truth rubs someone the wrong way, I’m okay with that. 

If I’m interested in the topic, I may be the most talkative person around, even in a group of complete strangers. I will debate points I disagree with, I will gladly learn from them if I am wrong, even if I’m right, there might be points they brought up I can assimilate. 

I will lead without hesitation or I will follow if someone else is already leading or simply wants to be the leader. Position in a group is meaningless to me. If I am following, I will still be an active participant and make sure it’s being lead correctly (not going off topic for too long or being outright incorrect), I might clash with whoever is in charge, but it would be for the sake of truth and not to be difficult. 

I am not adverse to physically fighting someone if need be. I have done it before and would do it again. I won't stand for injustice. Although I wouldn't initiate a fight with someone over words. 

I’m very interested in abstract thoughts and ideas. Logic, physics, theories, video game plotlines, etc… 

I fawn over my wife like Maes Hughes (from Full Metal Alchemist, an anime). Basically I adore her and spending my time on her or things related to her. Favors don’t bother me, my time could not be better spent.

If I didn’t have friends, I’d have no problem seeking out new ones and I quickly am on good terms with most people. I do not want too many friends, my time is precious to me, I cannot maintain friendships that are high maintenance. Either be a friend I might see years from now and hang out once in a blue moon with, or you’re one of my few close friends I will hang out more often with. I treat people I haven't seen in years with the same energy and enthusiasm as the last time I saw them. My friendship really doesn't degrade over time unless specifically ended. 

My energy in work is spontaneous and I’m disorganized. I hate tedious work (lots of little but different things) but love inventive challenging work, monotonous work is neutral to me. ",1,1728335434.0,Enneagram,0,0.67,False

Here are some tips to help you stay healthy and feel refreshed throughout your journey.

[https://www.podcasterpicks.com/biohackers-guide-to-beating-jet-lag-and-staying-healthy-while-traveling/](https://www.podcasterpicks.com/biohackers-guide-to-beating-jet-lag-and-staying-healthy-while-traveling/)

TLDR-

* Optimize for sleep
* Don't drink alcohol
* Match your caffeine and meal schedule to your destination as soon as possible
* Travel gear- Noise cancelling headphones, hand sanitizer, good eye mask, moldable earplugs, inflatable neck pillow, compression socks, blackout stickers
* Supplements- lysine, vitamin D, vitamin C, melatonin

# Optimize for Sleep

With early and late flights, long transits, and uncomfortable environments, traveling can wreak havoc on your circadian rhythm and make sleep difficult. Time zone changes can be particularly challenging. When possible, I start adjusting my sleep schedule a several days before my trip. I gradually shift my wake-up and bedtime closer to my destination’s time zone. I try to do this by waking up 15-30min earlier each day for 5-6 days before my trip. For a North America to Asia itinerary, this can be difficult but, for Europe, even shifting 1-2 hours beforehand will help alleviate the stress on your body. The [Timeshifter App](https://www.timeshifter.com/) is a great tool to give you a detailed schedule, including when to nap, have caffeine, and melatonin while in transit. To help shift my body’s circadian rhythm, as soon as I begin my journey, I will adjust my eating and caffeine consumption to match my destination time zone.

When I arrive, even after a red eye, I avoid napping. I try to power through the first day, adding extra caffeine if necessary. This way, when bedtime finally rolls around, I will be very tired and I will take melatonin to help reset my circadian rhythm. Napping can make falling asleep at the proper time more difficult, particularly when your body is already off its normal rhythm.

# Travel Gear

Noise Cancelling Headphones- After trying many Bose and Sony over-the-ear and earbuds over the past several years, I recently upgraded to the Sony WF-1000XM5 and they are my favorites so far. They have great noise cancellation and sound quality. The small size makes them comfortable to have in for a long-time, even while sleeping. Foam tips for your earbuds can give a better fit and block more noise. Comply makes them for the Sony earbuds and for Airpod Pros

Hand Sanitizer and Sanitizing Wipes – I like this Purell sanitizer with a loop, so I can keep it outside my bag so it is always easily accessible. Whenever I board a plane, I use the wipes to sanitize everything- the seat, tray table, screen, armrests, and seatbelt.

Eye Mask – For a bright environment like a plane, an eye mask can help you sleep more comfortably.

Moldable Earplugs – Moldable earplugs are the first ones have found that are comfortable and effective. Being able to mold them ensures the perfect fit to block as much noise as possible.

Inflatable Neck Pillow – If I’m not flying business class, I will pack an inflatable neck pillow. This one doesn’t take up much space and can certainly make a nap on the plane much more comfortable.

Compression Socks – Anytime I am on a flight over 8 hours, I put on my compression socks when I board. By improving circulation and reducing fatigue, compression socks can help you feel more energized and alert during your travels.

Blackout Stickers – I always want my room to be as dark as possible, which can often be a challenge in hotel rooms. These little stickers are super easy to travel with and are great for covering up little lights on TVs, phones, thermostats, etc.

# Supplements

L-Lysine – Lysine contributes to a healthy immune system by supporting the production of essential immune components, promoting tissue health, and regulating processes involved in immune responses. It will also help support mucous membranes in the nose and mouth, which can become dry and vulnerable from dry plane air. Take 1,000mg daily four days before you start your trip, during your travel, and 1-2 days after you arrive.

Vitamin D3 – Vitamin D supplements can help ensure adequate intake, support the immune system, maintain bone health, and promote mental well-being during travel. I take 1,000 IU most days and will double the dose to 2,000 IU in the days leading up to a trip.

Vitamin C – Vitamin C contributes to a healthy immune system by protecting cells from damage, supporting tissue health, and enhancing the function of immune cells. Take 500mg daily four days before you start your trip, during your travel, and 1-2 days after you arrive. Emergen-C packets also make a convenient way to get good dose and dissolve easily in a cup.

Melatonin – Your body naturally produces melatonin based on your circadian rhythm. When you change time zones, your body will not change its schedule immediately. A 3mg dose of melatonin can help you sleep on the plane

Nuun Electrolyte Tabs with Caffeine – Even just for taste, airplane coffee is questionable at best. I prefer to take Nuun tabs with caffeine to properly dose my caffeine. They dissolve easily in water",8,1728335330.0,TravelHacks,0,0.9,False

I’m looking for beta readers to give feedback on the first three chapters of my YA manuscript “The Brave,”  97k words. 

The blurb:  

Seventeen-year-old Diana Mason just wanted a prosperous life. Working at a New York coffee shop to help her unemployed mother, while the fear of losing her ill sister consumes her, makes her desire a different reality. Everything’d be better if her father hadn't disappeared, leaving an unfillable void in her heart. Her ordinary life changes when a mysterious man arrives at her job with an opportunity. Diana’s courage and determination attracted the attention of the secret agency C.A.D.E., who selected her for biannual spy training. The agency pays more money than Diana ever dreamed of. The chance to help her family and get the life she always wanted arrives. Diana leaves for the peculiar world of C.A.D.E., the agency hidden underneath the Mojave Desert, where robots and submarine cars are as commonplace as the blue sky.   

The training consists of eight phases, where in each one, fifteen recruits face different challenges - such as learning to fight, facing fears in hyper-realistic simulations, and surviving in extreme scenarios - which become more dangerous as the training progresses. At the end of each phase, C.A.D.E. eliminates the worst performing recruit, taking their money, skills learned during training, and C.A.D.E.-related memories, returning them to their old lives like blank canvases. Only the best recruits become agents.         

Diana finds herself at an enormous disadvantage. The other recruits are physically more prepared; the challenges are like nothing she has faced before, and to her surprise, she’s the only girl among the recruits. As if the pressure isn’t enough, Diana discovers that her father is a C.A.D.E. agent, and he’s closer than she thinks. Diana must overcome her limits and carry on the phases while accepting that her father wasn’t who she thought he was. To become an agent, aid her loved ones, and preserve her identity, Diana must be more than just strong. She must be brave.

This year's blend had all the flavors I've come to associate with Jon Huber's work: Pastry dough, citrus, and chocolate. This year's Las Calaveras takes that formula and adds some red chilis and coffee to the flavor profile. Construction was near perfect with only a slightly crooked burn line in the final third. This year's release is a strong addition to the collection. It starts sweet and dessert-like but gets more robust as it goes. The LC48 vitola can be had online for ~$14 which is exactly where I'd price it. The annual Las Calaveras releases are great to revisit each year, so grab one if you can!

1fyintd,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1fyintd/90_days_hard_mode_reflecting_and_ama/,90 days hard mode. Reflecting and AMA,"Hey everyone. So, as the headline says, I've reached 3 months on hard mode (so no MO either). I am 23M and I've discovered this community and the movement already 2 years back and since then had many medium-length streaks but always relapsed. Then, at some point, I said to myself: enough is enough. And it finally worked. So, I want to tell you some advice that helped me out. Lets go

**What worked and what didnt.**

First of all, there has been a big discussion about counting days, where some people encourage and others discourage it. For me, it has been quite helpful because it turned the whole experience into something of a game. Maybe its just me.

Also, being around family and friends and reducing time alone has been great. Bc you will probably not even think about doing the deed while you are with other people.

Reducing social media to a minimum has been incredibly helpful. Like all people, the algorithms are way smarter than I am so I would always find myself mindlessly scrolling on IG, tik tok, etc for hours on end. Then I decided that I need a little help with discipline. There are many apps that will let you do that- essentially blocks the apps you select during selected day time periods. And there is no way around it. So, I allowed myself 30 min of IG per day, where I would check my messages, etc. Honestly, insane help for NoFap but also generally for life. Check it out for yourselves, I can only recommend these kinds of apps.

And of course, something that is obvious, educating yourself on the true harm of pornography. Your brain will try to convince you that it is harmless to do it a little bit. But the truth is, its like hard drugs. One time is one time too many. Instead of dying physically (like with hard drugs) you die inside. I have thought so much about this and I have realized that pornography has fried my brain completely, as I have been using it since I was about 12. The negative effects it had on my life are countless. But that is a whole different post.

**What changed in these 3 months**

First of all, No, i did not get any superpowers. I think that people who spread information like that, (you get x ray vision and all the girls in your vicinity fall into your arms type shit) actually make it worse because thats what some people expect when starting nofap. Remember, you still have to work to improve yourself physically and socially. You will not suddenly go from being a skinny-fat, social-anxiety ridden gremlin to Chad himself just because you stopped touching yourself for a bit. Sounds harsh but thats the reality. And thats how its supposed to be. If it was easy, everyone would do it, right.

What really changed is that I can notice less anxiety and definitley more mental stability. More desire to go out rather than stay in (and I dont only mean go out partying, also things like going to lectures at uni instead of staying in and skipping them, hitting up and meeting someone you havent seen in a long time for a coffee, going for a walk and sitting down for a coffee (even alone) on a lazy Sunday afternoon instead of just watching movies at home, etc). Also, I guess more motivation to change the other issues in your life. I wholly agree with the point that so many others made in this group about PMO being a veil that conceals all the other issues you have in your life because you use it as an escape. When you stop, you suddenly have to face all those issues without a crutch. And then the only thing to do is to work to solve them. And I think that is the biggest value of doing it.

Generally, when you do NoFap, you are not doing something extraordinary for yourself. You are just stopping what is basically daily self-abuse and going back to becoming normal, to becoming what you are supposed to be.

**So, what is next?**

I think the best part of NoFap being a 90 days challange is that at the beginning you only commit yourself to this limited time period, because you believe (if you don't, youre better than I am) that you are giving up an activity that brings you a lot of pleasure, but only for some time. Not forever. And that makes it much easier for so many people to start. Even people who dont think they have an issue who might think ""I just want to prove to myself that I can do it"". But, the beautiful thing is, after 90 days, I have absolutely no desire or any urge to go back to it. I honestly believe that I've kicked it forever. And I think that is one of the best decisions I've made in my life.

If i could do it - so can you.

1fyingg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fyingg/24f_wondering_about_my_digestive_issues/,24F wondering about my digestive issues,"24 Female, 5'6"", fluctuating between 263lbs and 253lbs. 

Diagnosed with PCOS. History of migraines without auras, nonalcoholic fatty liver, gallbladder removal at 19, heel spurs both feet, prior anemic episodes but managed, history of exercise induced asthma and recent bronchitis in July/August 2024. Been told I probably have IBS. 

Medications taking regularly are Ovima 28 for birth control and managing PCOS for last month, bupropion 150mg once daily in am, multivitamin complete for last 3 weeks, ibuprofen and acetaminophen as needed for migraines, salbutamol as needed for asthma. 

Birth control medication history of Alysena 28 for 2 months prior to Ovima, depoprovera for 1.5 years, Lolo 28 since 16 years old. 

On to my current question that may or may not require my history: I have frequent lower left pelvic pain seemingly unrelated to my menstruation. I have been managing my Fibre intake for my whole adult life and have a history of rectal bleeding, fissures, hemorrhoids. Whenever I am constipated I feel pain. The best way for me to not be constipated is to drink a single cup of coffee as it seems to activate my digestion and get me to go. However this usually means that instead of normal looking BMs they're loose or diarrhea. My doctor told me last time when I brought it up that I probably just have IBS but I keep thinking about the worst possible cases. As far as I know my family does not have a history with colon cancer but everyone in my family has issues with digestion. I also get frequent acid reflux and heartburn but that's usually when I haven't eaten on time or when I lay down too soon after eating. 

What I want to know is if it's better to keep managing my digestion with coffee or if I need to advocate for a more thorough exam. I have had full abdominal ultrasounds done but I don't know if they have looked at my intestines/colon.

1fyilm5,https://www.reddit.com/r/rome/comments/1fyilm5/my_rome_101_what_we_learned_on_our_first_trip_to/,My Rome 101 – What We Learned on Our First Trip to Rome (Updated),"First off, we learned a lot of helpful tips from ‘fabulous’ You Tuber ‘Stay Fabulous’.  Kudos to her!!  Many, many thanks!!  Start here for your journey to Rome and beyond!

Speak a Little Italian.  You're going to Italy, learn the 10 or so most common phrases, Buongiorno - good morning, Buona sera - good evening or good afternoon, Mi scusi – excuse me, Grazie – thank you or Grazie Mille - thank you very much, Bagno - bathroom.  Ciao is informal for tourists is not used as often you may think.  Always begin your conversation and end your conversation in Italian (Buongiorno … Grazie). You'll be surprised how many tourist-facing people speak English well in Florence and Rome.  Do not say Ma'am.  This is a Midwest polite thing but not appreciated in Italy. (I was quickly corrected by young lady serving gelato.)  

Coffees are the thing. All sorts of coffees!  All day long!  Figure out what you like to order ahead of time, not in line.  You won't see people walking around with a paper cup of coffee in their hand like you see in US cities.  Drink it there in the shop.  Also, you won’t see people eating or drinking on the go either.  Gelato was the only exception we saw. 

No Diet Coke in Italy!  Full strength Coke or Coke Zero.  Apparently, it’s an EU thing. You’ll have to just settle for Aperol Spritz.  Bummer, I know!!  Plastic bottle caps do not separate from the bottles and will stay connected. Again, it's an EU thing. 

Shoes.  Wear well-fitting and cushioned sneakers. Leather shoes are seldom worn and will hurt. Heals will kill you.  Rome and Florence streets where tourists walk are, are paved with 12cm x 12cm black basalt stone with gaps to facilitate drainage (called “sampietrini”). Essentially square cobble stones. Cute but uncomfortable. Dragging luggage will be sporting, so make sure your luggage has sturdy (large) wheels.  We had Travel Pro luggage which did fine but if you have smaller wheels you'll be in trouble.  We did see several lost and lonely luggage wheels along the way.

Money and Contactless ‘Machines’.  Both Rome and Florence were mostly cashless.  We got 150 EUR which was fine for eight days in Italy.  The ATMs in the Rome airport baggage are safe places to get money (Thanks, Fabulous).  You will not be handing over your credit card to a waiter or shop clerk.  Instead, they will hand you a portable contactless machine for you to tap your card.  If you don’t see one, ask for a ‘machine’.  Some machines may give you an option of charging in EUR or US Dollars.  Always, pick EUR because you don’t know the vendor’s bank conversion rate will be for EUR to Dollars.  Let your bank at home figure it out and it will likely be the best rate.  We used Galaxy smart watches with Google Wallet app which worked most of the time.  This saves you from dragging out your wallet to get your card.  NB: First, make sure your bank card does not charge a ‘Foreign Transaction Fee’. 

Trains.  Go First Class reserved seats when you can.  The train from Rome airport (FCO) to the Rome Terminal (Termini) will be crowded and standing room only. There is no First Class option here.  If you do get a seat, watch your luggage.  There are very, very little seating in the train stations, expect to stand the entire time waiting for your train, so don't arrive excessively early.  We took a fast train to and from Florence, from the Termini station.  Nice comfortable ride in First Class.

Pick Pockets. Unfortunately, this is a real thing in crowded areas and at the Metro. On the Metro, we were 'helped' with our large luggage by a well-known gang of teenage girls. Pushing/blocking to get on the car at the station, the backpack was checked, and the wife's fashion cross body bag (with fancy zipper tabs) was opened/checked.  Fortunately, nothing was taken, and she still had her cell phone in that pocket.  I had a plain (non-fashion) cross-body bag with a compartment on the backside for my wallet and passport.  AMZ – Look for an anti-theft bag (e.g., “Sling Bag Anti-Thief Crossbody Personal Pocket Bag Lightweight Chest Shoulder Backpack for Travel”).  If you see a group jumping on and then off at stops, BEWARE!

Rome Metro. If you can navigate the large metros in Seattle, Chicago, BART or DC metros, you'll have no issues here. Basically, there are only two underground lines in Rome which intersect at Roma Termini.  Termini also supports the fast trains and regional trains above ground.   Metro passes also include the Rome busses.  There were 48-hour, 72-hour, and 7-day passes for tourists.  For the Very popular tourist attractions, you'll be using both A Line and B Line.  We stayed near the Barberini station for convenient connections.  The Spagna station was closed for remodeling.  Be sure to check for the latest closures on the Rome Metro web site if you're picking a hotel close to a station. 

Taxis are only at marked Taxi Stands. There is no hailing like you see in NYC or Chicago.  In Rome, the taxi to the airport were a flat charge of 55 EUR. Four passengers via the fast train from FCO to Termini (the central Metro and train station in Rome) cost 63 EUR total, so taxis are cost effective to FCO for parties of four+ but will take longer.

Dining and Tipping. We heard pasta portions were smaller, but we didn’t see this at all.  Plenty of pasta!  Pasta is really a la dente – much more so than in the states.  Water at dinner or lunch is either sparkling or ‘still’.  You’ll be paying for it.  Tipping is not generally a thing in Italy, and you should not feel obligated.  In fact, on the check/bill from a machine there is no “Tip” line.  Waiters on the other hand are there to take your order and deliver your meal.  The service is adequate, rushed but not exceptional.  One place we saw a waiter was touching and adjusting a cash tip jar at the counter – clearly aimed at Americans.  Taxis may do the same thing.  Don’t feel obligated.

Hotel Electrical Outlets.  Don’t expect a lot of electric outlets in your hotel room.  They are not every 6 feet like in the states.  You will likely have several USB-A ports but no USB-C ports.  Grab a handful of USB-A to USB-C converters for your USB-C devices.  Also, for your laptops, etc. which have inline power bricks, these Euro cords will be helpful AZM “EU 2 Prong 2.5A Power Cord Plug Type C Molded Power Cord”.

Snacks.  All morning and afternoon you can swing into a pastry shop for a quick coffee and pastry.  Probably, pistachio is their most favorite flavor.  Lots and lots of different psalteries – more than my waistline in my pants would allow.  They all looked so great.  Some local pizza shops will have different kinds of pizzas on a cookie sheets.  They will slice off a square and charge you by weight.  I didn’t have a bad slice once.  If you’re not sure what to get, a Margherita pizza (tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and basil) is always a safe bet.

Rome Tours.  Time is precious.  Do only group tours which allow the tour to skip the line.  They cost more but will save you time in line.  Expect to be in groups of 20\~25 people.  They’ll use wireless headsets during the tour with ear buds.  The lines for the Very popular attractions were over 2 hours long for non-tour groups and this was in late September/early October.  You’ll be expected to show your passport for entry, sometimes multiple times.  Supposedly, you can have a copy of your passport or a picture on your phone, but we didn’t see people doing this.  Do keep a copy of your passport in your hotel room – just in case (see below).   Reserve your group tours well in advance of your trip to Rome.

 We will be back and a tad more experienced.  Have fun and enjoy your time in Rome and beyond!",3,1728335045.0,rome,0,1.0,False

Oh, [#FacebookMarketplace](https://x.com/hashtag/FacebookMarketplace?src=hashtag_click)? Bruh, it’s like the internet’s version of a sketchy yard sale that you didn’t even ask to go to. First of all, why does everyone on there think they’re selling a rare Picasso? People out here listing their busted-up couches like, “$600. No lowballers.” Bruh, that couch looks like it’s been through a world war \*and\* a frat party. You know it smells like regret and pizza rolls. But nah, they really out here acting like they’re sitting on a throne of gold while you’re staring at a broken La-Z-Boy from 1987.  
  
And the pictures, man. Why does every post look like it was taken with a flip phone in 2003? Blurry, bad lighting—half the time, you can’t even tell what you’re looking at. “Is that a chair or an abstract sculpture?” People taking photos of their furniture like they’re in a witness protection program, trying to hide the truth. Just admit your coffee table’s seen better days, man. Don’t hit me with “Like new!” when it’s clearly “Like almost in the trash.”  
  
Now, the people? Bruh, the people you deal with on Marketplace are a whole different breed. You’re trying to sell a bike, and some dude rolls up with an offer of $3 and a pack of gum. “Yo, is this cool?” No, bruh, I’m not trading my bike for a half-eaten Snickers and a promise. Then you get the ones who straight-up ghost you. “Is this still available?” You respond, all hopeful, “Yeah!” And then, crickets. Vanished. Like, where’d you go, bruh? Did you get abducted by aliens after asking about my futon?  
  
And don’t even get me started on where they want you to meet up. “Hey, let’s meet in the darkest alley you can find at 2 a.m.” Nah, man! I’m not about to end up on a Netflix true crime documentary over a used blender. We meeting in a public place, with witnesses, and in broad daylight. I’m not trying to get jumped over your grandma’s old nightstand.  
  
And then the weird stuff people sell. Bruh, I’ve seen people trying to sell half-empty bottles of lotion, used socks, and I swear I once saw a “slightly damaged” garden gnome missing half its face. Like, who wakes up and says, “You know what someone needs? My broken gnome that looks like it just survived a bar fight.”  
  
And the free section? It’s not “free,” it’s “come take my trash.” Free broken washing machine? What am I supposed to do with that? Build a time machine? People acting like giving away their busted vacuum is some kind of gift to society. Bruh, no one wants your junk!  
  
So yeah, Facebook Marketplace, where everything’s overpriced, broken, or haunted by bad decisions. You’re not shopping, you’re surviving.

I f28 have been with my partner m33 for four years, living together for 1.5. We have pets together and generally our relationship is very happy and loving. I have no intention to end things or even to open up the relationship - the sheer thought of hurting his feelings by proposing this feels devastating and I could never see myself cheating or anything like that.

However, I sometimes miss the life I had before we met. I miss waking up alone, drinking coffee by myself, and being in my own apartment. And - I am almost ashamed to say this - I also miss dating. I think what strongly plays into that is that I am currently studying for a master's degree, so naturally I sometimes hear about my classmates' party weekends, dating life, and little adventures.

I don't have any sudden urges to leave my partner or cheat or anything like that. But I think it is harder for me to accept that I have aged and that my single and self-sufficient years are over forever. I find myself immensely flattered anytime someone (even one of my younger peers) tries to flirt with me.

I feel terrible everytime I have these thoughts, but somehow they also just don't go away. I don't know what to do with this.

Here’s a list of things I’ve experienced since childhood:

* I was always told I was slow at doing things (chores, homework, getting ready for bed, etc.).
* I was a straight-A student from primary school to university (PhD level), but:
   * My report cards always had the same comment: ""Very good student, but always daydreaming.""
   * I had difficulty understanding verbal instructions (“What did the teacher say?”), so I would always refer to notes and textbooks.
   * I would daydream when the teacher or professor wasn’t engaging enough and then had to catch up and figure things out.
* I wasn’t exactly shy, but I didn’t enjoy group interactions in primary school, so I was often alone at recess. I frequently felt like people didn’t like me and felt rejected.
* I’m social and sociable, but often prefer my own company. When I've had enough, I just want to go home. I rarely stay late at events.
* I struggle with multitasking:
   * In high school and university, I didn’t go out much because I focused entirely on my studies and took forever to finish projects. I was never a last-minute person though, that stressed me out too much. I'd start way ahead of time and still need all the time allotted.
   * I avoided serious relationships during university because I was too focused on my studies. I didn’t get married until my late 30s because of this.
   * I only had one child because I couldn't wrap my head around taking care of more than one.
   * I feel overwhelmed at the thought of organizing things like closets or the pantry, as there’s so much to do on top of the usual daily chores.
* I have trouble focusing on a conversation if there's background noise (TV, music, loud talking).
* I research everything thoroughly, even for small purchases like a brand of coffee or a phone case.
* I find a standard 9-to-5, five-day workweek exhausting. I do better freelancing, which is more flexible, though not as financially stable.
* I’ve had several different careers because I'm interested in so many things. Fortunately, I have many marketable skills, so I’ve never struggled to support myself and my family.
* Even when I have a good job, I’m always looking for ways to improve things—whether it's scheduling, equipment, or processes.
* If I have an appointment or something, even if it's short, I have trouble doing anything else that day. I have trouble understanding how people can be on the go all day from one thing to another.
* I’m often exhausted on weekends and have trouble tackling tasks on my to-do list (like organizing closets). I prefer tasks like cooking, cleaning the kitchen, or doing laundry because I know exactly what needs to be done. Thankfully, my husband does a lot of the indoor and outdoor chores, which makes me feel guilty since I don’t have the energy to do more.
* I’ve never had a lot of physical stamina, even as a child. It’s worse now that I’m older. Some days I’m so exhausted I feel like something must be wrong with me, but then I snap out of it and feel okay again. This has been happening for years, and I’ve had it checked by a doctor. I haven’t slept well since my 40s. I fall asleep easily but wake up frequently. It was horrible during menopause but has improved, though my brain still wakes up a lot.
* I’m addicted to my phone; I check it constantly and play Candy Crush a lot, knowing it’s for the dopamine hit. Thankfully, I’ve never developed substance or gambling addictions.
* I tend to fixate on things and learn everything I can about them. This can be a double-edged sword, though it has its benefits (like learning about health issues or for work).

These are the main things that come to mind right now. I don’t know if I feel the need to seek treatment or even a diagnosis, but I think reading everyone’s stories here will help me find coping strategies. My main challenges are getting things done and having enough energy. If you've made it this far, thanks for listening :) ",2,1728334418.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

For the listener:

*You're making coffee in your treehouse. Making coffee has nothing to do with your crush. Making coffee is easy. Predictable. Making coffee doesn't cause you to feel lonely and lost. Making coffee is....it has nothing to do with your crush. And your crush is.....yeah, she's just gorgeous, and pretty, and beautiful, and standing outside your treehouse.* 

*Wait, WHAT?!*

**SCRIPT:**



*(SFX: Soft chirping of cicadas)*

So this is where you like to hide away from me, huh?

Woah, easy there! I didn’t mean to startle you. Sorry (giggling- she’s definitely not sorry).

What am I doing here? Hm. You could’ve phrased that better. I’m a guest in your treehouse, aren’t I?

Why, thank you. I think I’ll take you up on your invitation to come in.

Wow. You must really spend a lot of time in here. You’ve really....um, decorated the place (giggling).

Is the guitar on the wall yours? How come you never told me you play?

You’re not that good yet, huh? (Smiling) Well, I’d still like to hear you play some time.

Even if it’s only to laugh at you. Yeah (a little chuckle). You know me so well.

I kind of like this place. You’ve got so many posters. I actually recognise some of these TV shows. And is that.....wow, is that a Darth Vader action figure?

No, no! Don’t get embarrassed! I....I actually think it’s kind of cool, honestly.

Yeah. Girls like guys with hobbies. That being said....I most humbly accept the honour of being the first ever girl to walk in here. You’re welcome!

Awww. Are you pouting? (Sighing softly- suddenly sincere) My heart. You’re simply too precious.

I hope you don’t mind me sitting close to you. It’s kinda cramped in here, after all.

Lovely. So, what were you up to before I came in?

Making coffee? Really? How’d you even-

Ah. An electric kettle. You’re full of surprises, aren’t you? And you actually have a power socket up here. I’m impressed. If ever we have a zombie apocalypse on our hands, this could turn out to be a neat little bunker for us.

Well, of course zombies can’t climb up trees. Didn’t they teach us that back in fifth grade, silly? Or were you too busy admiring me during class even back then?

(Whispering) Mmn. And there it is. I knew I’d have you blushing soon enough. So you admit you did like me even when you were-

Oh? You admit to nothing? (Giggling) Okay. Alright, then.

Why am I smiling? (Very faintly) As if you don’t already know.

I’ll tell you all about it one day. But for now- I believe you said you were making coffee?

Why, yes. I would like some. Thank you.

By the way, what kind of coffee are you making?

Espresso? Come on! That’s so basic.

Yeah. It tastes like a....like a walk at night through a quiet suburb. It’s what you get on a casual outing with your friends. Espresso is the taste of buzzing streetlights and school night basketball games. What else have you got?

Capuccino? Hmmm.....

No. Not capuccino. Too much foam. You’ll use it to hide your embarrassment, and then I can’t see you blushing again. Cappuccino conceals. It’s for dark and rainy nights, to be drunk near a window on a lighthouse as you try to forget the past, and stare out at the dark, churning ocean. It’s too much adventure for a quiet and calm evening.

(Giggling) What? Why’re you giving me that weird look? You know I’m right! Come on, we must make something else.

A latte? Huh. Well, that *is* the taste of quiet and calm evenings. It’s what you sip on, and sigh, as the late autumn wind ruffles your scarf. Latte. Sweet, and balanced. But also....thin. Fleeting, like autumn. A reminder of the coming winter, and the fragile things in this world that shall soon be buried under snow. It’s not for you and me. Do you have nothing else?

I’m sorry?

Mocha.....? Interesting. It’s basically hot chocolate, but with a touch of coffee. Rich and welcoming and mysterious. The perfect drink for someone like me. Yes. Very well, I think I’ll have a mocha!

What? Why are you shaking your head?

(Quieter) Yeah. Of course I’ll always be there to boss you around. What would you do without me?

“Just make espresso”, huh? Jerk. (Giggling playfully)

*(SFX: Boiling water/cauldron sounds)*

Hmm. Now, what to do while you prepare it? I....wait. Hey, look at that! The orange cat just got up! That’s an actual cat? I thought you just had a plushie lying around on the cushion.

Oh? She likes to pretend she’s a stuffed toy so she can surprise people? That’s....cute.

How come you never mentioned her to me before?

She never came up? Uh huh. How difficult would it have been to naturally bring up an orange cat in a conversation?

Exactly. So, what’s her name?

Lula? I see. Hey there, Lula! It’s very nice to finally meet you.

*(SFX: Meowing of a cat)*

Well, why wouldn’t she greet me back? Cats like me. They know what I am. As do you. Which reminds me- I really do hope you’ve not told anybody else about my secret.

Good boy.

(Smirking) Aww, don’t pretend you hate it. It’s true! You *are* a good boy. When I call you that, it’s a reward. One which....I think....you enjoy quite a bit. I can see your spine tingle every time you hear it. Like right now. (Whispering) Good boy.

See? It’s like clockwork. And really, I mean what I say. I’d never lie to you. And you know why? (Whispering up close) Because you’re such a good boy for me.

Well, I think I may have been too hasty earlier. Not even the foamiest cappuccino could hide that blush. (Giggling for a little too long)

(Finally, with a sigh) Oh, dude. Would you look at that? The sun has almost set. We’re losing daylight.

Yeah. The view from your window is pretty sweet. I can see your lawn. It’s like one of those- what do you call them?- one of those chiaroscuro paintings. An interplay of light and dark. Of green and fading gold.

Mhmn. It is quite a sight. But if it’s okay with you....(voice drops) I’d rather be looking at something else.

*(SFX: Rustling of fabric)*

(Giggling) What? It’s not like we’re doing anything! I’m only trying to get on top of you. Now, hold still.

Come on. I may not look like it, but you *know* I’m stronger than you. So you should just-

(Enjoying herself) Hey! Hey! Hold still! Just be a good little boy and....

*(SFX: More rustling. Then, a dull thud and something metallic softly falling.)*

(Breathing up close) You look even cuter when you’re pinned below me. Such a cute, indignant expression on your face.

Hmm. No, I won’t get off you for a while yet. Tough luck.

What do I want? (Whispering) Isn’t it obvious?

Well, if you’re going to make me spell it out.... (sighing)

(Faint) I want you.

(Firmer) I want you. Be mine.

No jokes. No toying with your feelings. Just the truth. I’m being serious.

How long have we known each other, hm? We spend practically all our time together. Do everything together. You’re the only one I shared my secret with. We’re lovers in everything but name.

Oh, I’ve tried to make a move on you before. Trust me. You have no idea how many times I was on the verge of slipping a love potion into your coffee. How meticulously I practised my charm spells to try on you. But every time, I just....got cold feet, I guess.

That, and I didn’t want to....you know.....(taking a deep breath) I didn’t want to break your trust in me.

Yeah. I want you to be mine. Willingly.

So what if I’m a witch? (Seductive laughter) You let me worry about how things would work out between us, ‘kay? My kind has long had relations of a rather....intimate nature with you humans. It wouldn’t be a problem.

(Sighing) And that, is where you’re wrong, sweet thing. You are magical. You’re the most magical thing I’ve seen. So what if you can’t cast spells? I’d say you cast quite a fine one on me.

Yeah, okay. That....that was lame. Sorry. But the point remains.

What? Why do you look like you’ve just eaten a goldfish?

You like me too? Yeah, no kidding. I’ve known that since the day I met you. All the stuttering and shy staring and looking away when I notice you- lingering around me, leaning into my touch whenever I “accidentally” brush up against you- no, dude. You don’t like me. You’re in *love* with me. Hell, even your cat knows it at this point.

(Whispering) You’re kinda obvious. But I like it. I think it’s adorable.

Have you ever seen cherry blossoms? Pink and pale, drifting on the breeze in spring?

There’s a grove of blossoms near my cottage in the woods. Every proper witch has a cottage of her own. I go to the grove sometimes, and carve your name in the trees. Spring may last for a short time, and birds may stop singing too, but my affections for you shall remain, etched into the wood for all to see.

And when spring gives way to summer, I go to the beach at night when nobody’s around. And I write your name in the sand with a stick, but the waves always wash them away. And then I stare at the ocean and sigh, louder than the ocean winds, scaring away all the fish from the shore.

(Giggling) Yes. It’s difficult being a lonely witch. And whose fault is that? (Kissing the listener)

I….uh….(kissing him again)

(Hesitant) When….when summer gives way to autumn, and everything is candies and cobwebs, the laughing pumpkins remind me of how much I miss going trick-or-treating with you. Then I get sad, and talk to the cats in the neighbourhood, until they get tired of listening to how much I like you. And they yawn, and fall asleep, and then I’m alone with the mocking pumpkins again.

But worst of all is winter, when I get cold and shiver in my room because you’re not there to hold me. No blankets can keep me warm, and my heater always stops working at that time of the year. Everything is…is still and silent, and all I can see is the snow falling from the sky. Drifting, like the dust around us in sunbeams. So many sunbeams. Are they always here?

Oh. Then that kind of makes me feel a little special.

What? I don’t get it. (A little laugh) What a weird thing to say. But I suppose you’re right.

(Softly) Of all the treehouses in the world….I climbed into yours. Why do you think that is?

(They share a few slow kisses)

You know….your cat is looking at us funny. Almost like she’s disappointed in us.

Really? That’s just normal orange cat behaviour? (Giggling) Yeah. No arguments there.

You know….if this was, about a couple of centuries earlier, I’d make you my familiar. You’d help me collect herbs, and brew potions, and draw glyphs, and….(sultry) I would reward you for being oh so very good for me. I’d reward you and spoil you every day until you couldn’t imagine being away from me. And….And I, from you.

Will you be my familiar?

We witches don’t really form such contracts anymore, but….it can be our little secret.

(Strangely shy) Yeah. This is my way of asking you to be….to be….you know….

My face isn’t getting red. You’re imagining things.

(Sighing softly) I’m not flustered. I’m in love.

Will you be my familiar?

(A slightly longer pause)

(Smiling…wide, mischievous, smug….blissful) Good boy.

I knew you’d say yes. Of course I did. But, in spite of that, thank you. Sweetness.

No. I don’t care about the coffee anymore. You can make another cup later. Right now, you have something else that….needs your attention….

(They kiss a few more times)

(Barely audible) I love you.

*(Chirping of cicadas fades out)*

(A pause)

*(SFX: Phone ringing/Incoming call)*

Hey, honey. I’m sorry I missed your call earlier. It has just been a really, really busy day. Who knew leading a legal firm would be this much work?

(Quieter) Yeah. Yeah, you did.

So….did something happen, or…..?

Oh. You were just missing me. How cute.

No. I didn’t miss you or anything (giggling over the phone). Don’t be silly.

(Sighing longingly) I know, darling. I’ll be home in a few hours. I wish I could bring you to work with me. It’s not fair. (Pouting) A witch should be allowed to bring her familiar to office with her.

Where would you sleep? Well….I’m sure I could arrange a bed- of sorts- under my desk. I mean, I have a pretty large desk. Yeah. I could probably have one of those, um, those little puppy-pads for you to sleep on! How does that sound?

What? No! No, it’s not demeaning! It’s….okay, maybe like, a *teensy tiny* bit, but tell me you’ll at least consider it!

Good. Because I am being half-serious.

Mhmn. So, what were you doing at home? Playing those video games of yours again?

Oh. Taking a nap, huh? (Coyly) Did you dream of me?

Wait, really? That sounded way too sincere! And-And kind of sad. Awww, babe, you know you’re married to me, right? You’re not still that silly boy pining away in his treehouse and playing with his action figures. Right?

(Sighing) No, nothing’s wrong with him. I happened to fall in love with that boy.

What did you see in your dream?

Oh.

Hey, um, listen. I kinda have to get back to my work now.

Yeah.

Right. You too. I’ll…..wait. Wait! Hey, you still there?

I was just thinking that….would you like to revisit that treehouse with me this weekend?

Yeah. Really. It has been such a long time. I’m kind of….attached to that place myself. Let’s drive up there Saturday morning. What do you say?

(Giggling) Yes, sweetness. It’s a deal.

My doctor seems to say my caffeine intake is not an issue.

I think it is. 
I drink a half pot of coffee a day. I start at midnight because my sleep schedule now fubar.

I start my night a of sleep around 9 pm. 
Wake up at 11 ish. 
I'll have a cup of coffee if I can't sleep again. Which is normal. 
 I'll sleep from 2am to 3am. Again then. Get up and repeat. Sleep again from 5 to 6 and repeat. 

6 am is usually my last cup. 
 And I'm done . So thats 14 hours of no caffeine.
 
I pass out again by 7 to 9 pm. As I can't even function. Because I've been doing this ritual for a year. 

I'm trying to not get up at 11 pm ish and have coffee. 
It works occasionally. And it's getting slight more and more often they I'm able to sleep more. But it's really difficult. 

I just can't seem to sleep more than 2 hours at a time no matter what. And it's been like this for a long time. 

2 sleep studies. No apnea. 
Again doctors are fully aware of my coffee habit and insist it's not an issue as long as I'm not having caffeine past a certain time. 🤷‍♀️ 

I'm struggling with this. 
I'm having a gut feeling it might be causing some insomnia. 

That being said. I have had issues on and of for years before this habit started. 

Getting off this caffeine has been one of the hardest things I've done in a long time. The migraines alone are terrible. 

Anyways.

I'm that guy who turned wanderlust into a lifestyle, running my own business that lets me chase sunsets across different time zones. But you know what they say about all the beautiful places in the world? They're better when shared with someone special.

About me:

* 35 years young, 5'11 (180cm), rocking the bald bearded look with confidence (Mr. Clean wishes he had my blue eyes 😉)
* Proud future Polish citizen (just a few more steps to go!)
* Fluent in 3 languages (because why limit yourself to just one way of saying ""I'm lost""?)
* Currently learning bachata (two left feet slowly becoming one right and one left) and tennis
* Food adventurer who'll try anything once (except maybe that one street food that looked back at me)
* Ironically, my biggest fear is ocean swimming (thanks, Spielberg!)

What I'm looking for: A partner who:

* Embraces their feminine energy while being ready for spontaneous adventures
* Can go from Netflix and takeout to ""pack your bags, we're catching a flight in 3 hours!""
* Wants to build something real and lasting (yes, I'm talking about the forever kind of love)
* Dreams of creating a family (my wandering heart is ready to build a home)
* Appreciates both planned adventures and impromptu escapades
* Isn't afraid to try new things (except maybe swimming with sharks - FEAR)

Despite all my travels, I haven't found what I'm looking for yet: a genuine connection with someone who wants to create their own adventure story. While I love exploring the world, I'm ready to explore the possibility of being a husband and father - just need the right co-pilot for this journey.

So if you're:

* Comfortable with both staying in and going out
* Ready for something serious
* Want to create a beautiful life story together
* Don't mind dating someone who occasionally disappears to another continent (but always comes back with great stories and local treats) or want to tag along even better! 

...then let's chat! Maybe we can start with coffee and end up planning our next international adventure together. Who knows? The best journeys often start with a simple ""hello.""

**BACKGROUND**

42M, 5'8"", 145. I ran track (mile) soph year in HS and XC senior year, was pretty average. Basically didn't run after HS until around 2021 when I decided to give it a try again (at the time, my fitness routine consisted solely of lifting and hiking). I really got into it that first year, topping out at 45mpw but didn't follow any structured training or sign up for any races, I just ran as part of my fitness regiment. Ran less in 2022 and 2023, maybe 15-25 mpw. End of 2023 I developed a plantar wart on my foot that completely sidelined me for 3 months, until mid March of this year. Getting over felt like a miracle, and after being sidelined for so long, I was itching to hit the ground running again. Randomly decided to sign up for a half to provide added motivation, picking the Rock N' Roll one because it's a fairly popular local race and flat. I have Pfitzinger's book and decided to do the 11/47 HM plan. Unfortunately, given that I was re-starting my running in mid March, I didn't have much time for base training if I wanted to do the entire 11 week training block. 

  
**TRAINING**

I had about a month of base training where I built up mileage to around 30 mpw, then went straight into the 11/47 plan. I followed the plan almost to a tee, except I somehow miscounted and had to skip one of the last 2 tapering weeks. I decided to skip the last tune up, and do a v02 max workout instead. I really enjoyed this training block. It felt like (for me) the perfect combination of mileage and intensity. I would always be excited/anxious about workouts but completing them built so much confidence week after week. Initially I had access to a track, which was great for the workouts, but then I lost access to it. Fortunately, where I live, there's a rectangular block that is about a mile around, and it's a perfect neighborhood track. Ended up doing all my v02 max workouts here and it's almost preferable to a track for me simply because there's less turning. Only downside is 90 degree turns when you do have to turn but it wasn't a problem. I would say the hardest workouts during this block were the progression long runs with three miles of LT at the finish, or the 10k tune up, which I had to do as a time trial since signing up for a local race wasn't feasible. Stayed pretty much injury free, with my only real issue during this block being a strained extensor tendon on top of my foot (I think?) that hurt for a few weeks. But it went away on its own and I never had to rest or reduce mileage or intensity. I didn't change any lifestyle habits during this time, with the exception of abstaining from liquor (although not wine) the day before a particularly intense workout (i.e. progression long runs). One problem I have with fitness in general is underfueling, I'm just not a big eater, especially carbs. Most of my carbs come from rice and potatoes, aside from that I'm mostly a meat eater. Due to a GI condition (Crohn's), I don't eat veggies at all. I also rarely drink regular water, opting for either coconut water or mineral water with salt/lemon. 

Running became my top priority during this block, but I continued to do upper body lifts (completely stopped lower body lifts except for calf raises), simply because I didn't want to lose muscle and maintain a certain physique. I also bike, but it was very here and there, never being more than 2x a week and never long/intense. 

**PRE-RACE**

I mentioned above I have Crohn's disease, albeit a moderate version (no surgery) and it's generally under control, although you never know when it'll flare up. Unfortunately, it did somewhat flare up 1.5 weeks out from the race. Fortunately, it usually clears up within a week, so I was pretty good to go in the few days leading up. The area had been experiencing a heatwave all week, and it was projected to continue through the weekend (highs in the upper 90s) so the race was moved up half an hour. Despite all these ideas in my head about things to try for the race, I told myself nothing new and pretty much stuck to that. Which is pre-run: black coffee with raw honey, although I did drink a bit of an electrolyte drink in anticipation of the heat and I felt a little dehydrated during the night (got carried away at dinner and had 2 glasses of red wine). Got a bit less sleep than usual since I woke up earlier than planned because of the earlier start (sleep at 10, wake up at 5). I wanted to warm up for 2-3 miles pre-race but this didn't happen. I probably could have but it was pretty chaotic around the race area, and the only warm up I got in was running maybe a mile from where I was dropped off to my corral. Once I got in my corral, I stood around and waited for half an hour, not ideal but whatever. I never really did any stretching during training, and didn't do any pre-race here. I accepted the fact that my warmup would have to come during the race. I was a little confused by the race organization as I thought they would place runners in corrals based on your anticipated run time but clearly it was all mixed up.

  
**RACE**

Although projected to be hot, at the start the temp was around 67, not bad at all, although warmer than my normal training temps (50s). Being my first race, I didn't really have a concrete plan. In my mind, I was treating this as one of my long runs, just a bit faster. Starting out was slow due to the crowd, once I got in the clear I checked my watch and it read around 7:30, a bit slower than I wanted, so I picked it up. At the first water station, which was pretty early on, I checked again and saw I was at 6:50. At this point, I decided I'll just run on RPE. In my mind, I was a bit apprehensive about cooking myself early, but I found this pace to be tough but sustainable. My HR was immediately in threshold, but it always wavered around the same range, which was encouraging. By mile 6, I was still sustaining this pace and for the first time I thought maybe I could do this the entire way. I took my one and only gel at this mark (something I had been doing on 12+ mile long runs). Around mile 8, I developed a blister at the base of my left big toe, a very unwelcome development. I actually stopped for a few seconds to adjust my sock but that just made it worse. I knew the remainder of the race would be somewhat painful now but I was close enough to finishing where I thought I could tough it out. By mile 10 I felt I was fading a bit, a combo of simply being tired and the blister. Mile 12 was my slowest mile after the initial warmup miles. But at that point, the finish was in view so I dug deep to regain my pace. I also glanced at the time and got extra motivation knowing 1:30 was actually within reach. But I really couldn't give more at this point and passed the 13.1 mile mark at 1:30:06. The finish line was at 13:26 and I didn't try to kick, just finished. 

  
**POST-RACE**

Overall, I'm very happy with my time. I would never have guessed I could run this time, even during training when my confidence was building, simply because I've never ran this far this fast, not even close. My 13 mile progression long run, I averaged 7:36/mile and granted, the non LT miles weren't run fast but not slow either. But I killed myself those last 3 miles and only average 7:36/mile. This race, I was realistically aiming for 7:15-7:20/mile. My LT runs were run at 6:45-6:55/mile. So being able to basically average my LT pace for the HM was so eye-opening for me and leads me to wonder about possibilities for the future. I was just telling a friend that my long term goal for the HM was to run it averaging sub 7 min miles and I'm already there. I wasn't sure what I'd do with running after this race, but this result has made me fully committed. I now have my sights set on a 10k and marathon. ",4,1728333858.0,AdvancedRunning,1,0.75,False

TIFU by Setting Off the Fire Alarm at My Girlfriend’s Parents’ House During Dinner

This happened last weekend, and I still can’t show my face around her family.

So, my girlfriend invited me to her parents’ house for a fancy dinner. I’m talking multi-course, wine-pairing kind of fancy. Her parents are well-off, so they have this huge mansion-style house with a full chef’s kitchen that I was honestly scared to even touch. But after dinner, I wanted to impress everyone, so I offered to help clean up.

Her dad mentioned that the last person to touch their really expensive espresso machine was him and warned me to be careful. But being the idiot I am, I thought, “How hard could it be?” I figured I’d make everyone coffee as a nice gesture. Well, I somehow set it to some steam mode that basically turns the thing into a high-pressure lava cannon.

The machine starts whistling, and the next thing I know, steam shoots out, I panic, and I accidentally hit a switch that triggers their fire suppression system. Foam starts pouring out of the ceiling like it’s a foam party from hell, the fire alarm goes off, and everyone’s running around. Her dad’s yelling at me to shut it off, but I have no idea how this thing even works.

Long story short, the fire department showed up, the entire dining room was covered in foam, and her parents now think I’m a walking disaster. My girlfriend’s barely spoken to me since, and I’m pretty sure her dad had to spend a fortune resetting everything.

TL;DR: Tried to make coffee at my girlfriend’s parents’ fancy house, accidentally set off the fire alarm and covered the place in foam. Fire department showed up. Girlfriend’s family now thinks I’m a liability.

I bought a 7L E61 Heat exchanger (2006 Astra Mega ii Compact 110v) to start my coffee cart but would like to modify it to perform more like a boutique machine with a PID. Now it appears adding a PID to a machine that already uses a pressure-stat isn't impossible through the use of a relay to bypass the pressure-stat from controlling the heating element. The question is where the hell do I place the temperature probe to get an accurate reading? Should I insert it in the line feeding the group head? I feel a little out of my league figuring this out haha.

Add your thoughts.,"ChainFEST 2024 was a SCAM. I've been going to Chain events for about 2 years now and to sum it up, this event was awful. There was nothing ""gourmet"" or ""Michelin"" about it. It was basically a poorly thrown carnival in an attempt to create viral interactive marketing for these brands, spew low quality merch and serve cold, mediocre grade food. Pure cash grab / bait and switch tactics going on here. They opened 45 minutes late and we spent more time waiting in line sweating in the heat than eating. The event was so overpacked, we were constantly dodging the trash staff, who was tirelessly working to clear out the tiny little bins that filled up every 5 minutes. Each booth had these poorly amateur constructed wooden pylons made out of 4x4 planks to hold the branded flag lined strings that were used to corral us into a line. I think I tripped on them about 25 times throughout the event. They clearly oversold and under-delivered and didn't have the event experience, resources or proper staff to pull this off. They definitely deleted posts and made changes to the advertising from initial marketing after tickets were starting to be sold and were super misleading. FAILFEST.

So many of the bites were different than what they advertised. Our first stop was Cafe Panna, which advertised this multi-layer dessert and at the event, they gave us a little cup of ice cream with a tiny wooden spoon. The ice cream melted faster than we could enjoy it. Then we went to the Dominos booth and opened up our pizzas without any caviar or dill mascarpone topped like the advertising pictures showed. We asked them about it and they said ""it's in the sauce"". Uh, nope. We saw videos later on of the night time invite-only ""influencer"" event and they all had dollops of caviar on top. KFC booth, 1 lukewarm chicken tender with some frozen food grade dry potato waffles. The sauces were pretty good, but what's the point when there's not much to use the dip for. DutchBros coffee was decent, and they gave away stickers and trucker hats that were fun. Next, we made our way over to Panda Express, where we were served a tasty duo of spicy orange chicken and fried mushrooms. After that, White Castle, which was probably the item that most tasted like an ""elevated"" version of the original at the event. Krispy Kreme, was Krispy Kreme, so there's not much to say there. Portillo's served a pretty fun hot dog on a poppy seed bun and was nice, since we don't have it here in LA. Hot Dog on a Stick's elote corn dog was was decent, but would have been better if it were hot. The Cracker Barrel biscuit was good, but the sandwich as a whole was not great. The Red Robin burger was OK, but definitely looked nothing like what was advertised before the event. We had a sloppy joe at a booth that for some reason was sponsored by Volkswagen, but they ran out of the special ketchup that was supposed to come with it. The last item we had was the Lactaid cookies and cream ice cream on top of a warm cookie, which was actually super tasty. We skipped out on the dixie cup sized milkshake from Johnny Rockets, because the line was way to long.

Here's a takeaway to sum it all up. ChainFEST scammed us. There were a few good bites, but the poor experience overshadowed the charm that Chain used to have. I guess they truly embracing the CHAIN theme of showing you glamorous pictures of delicious food, but serving a lackluster version. They clearly favor celebrities, instagrammers, influencers and food reviewers and provide a different experience to them versus what the public received. The picture painted on IG did not reflect the reality of the event, which is par for the course these days. I hope they see this.",44,1728333211.0,FoodLosAngeles,19,0.87,False

1fyhsap,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fyhsap/downfall_from_bliss/,Downfall from bliss,"I've (30M) been struggling with something for a year... This is going to be a bit of a story so please bear with me. I'd love to hear your thoughts.

I've been an avid weightlifter for 4 years doing whole body workouts combined with body weight exercises 3-4 times a week. Ever I had started on that regimen I felt AMAZING. The harder I trained, the better my sleep was. I woke up feeling like a million bucks. Everything in live became easier. I could concentrate and articulate better and overall it was a major source of happiness for me. It got to a point where I never felt too lazy to work out because I actually WANTED to do it. I became very passionate about it.

Now here comes the kicker....

For the last year I have been suffering with strange symptoms related to my training. Now when I do any kind of prolonged muscle straining activity, I get poor sleep, overall fatigue, a strange pressure in my head and weird muscle spasms and stings throughout my body. It feels like my body is under some sort of tension that just doesn't want to go away. I feel charged in a bad way. Now the inverse is true regarding sleep, the harder I train the worse my sleep gets. The more volume in the training, the worse the symptoms get. One training session can cause a sort of domino effect where the symptoms stay for a couple days up to a week until they go away. Training in between those days only makes things worse.

When I stopped my training, the symptoms disappeared gradually. The first couple months I was still having flare ups, but not nearly as intense as when I would exercise. Now I live symptom free. But as soon as I do any training it all starts again.

This is the reason I haven't been able to train in over a year. On many occasions I have tried to slowly pick it up but as soon as the intensity goes up, the symptoms start. Especially doing supersets really triggers it. Doing HIIT cardio also triggers it, but not as much as weight training.

Some things to note:

* Drinking a lot of coffee can trigger the symptoms, but not as much as training. I've stopped drinking it for over a year.
* I used some basic supplements when I trained (AlphaViril by dr. Sam, vitamin D3 and vitamin C, protein shakes) but have stopped using everything for over a year and it makes no difference.
* I am in general a very relaxed person and don't get worked up easily. I don't overthink or have trouble shutting off my mind before sleep or anytime else. People always commend me for my ability to handle stress.
* I am lucky to say that I don't experience any stress at my job and enjoy working. Nor do I experience stress from my personal life.
* I would describe myself as a mindful person.
* I don't use any medication (and never have) and have no existing medical issues.
* I rarely drink, maybe 1 alcoholic drink per month.
* I sometimes smoke but not much. A couple puffs or maybe 1 cigarette per day at most.
* I use recreational drugs on average once per year.
* I'm from the Netherlands.

This is why I'm fairly certain it's not psychological. It feels physiological.

I have gone to my doctor and got a full bloodwork panel; nothing was out of the ordinary. I have been referred to a sports physician and he did a PFT test of my lungs, ECG of my heart, and a cardiac stress test. Everything was NORMAL.

I am incredibly sad that I can't train anymore as it made me feel amazing and improved my quality of life greatly. I really hope I can train again one day...

1fyhng3,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1fyhng3/worst_birthday_everrant/,Worst birthday ever(rant),"I've been thinking about writing in here for a while now, but I never felt right about it until today. So quick warning this is probably going to be long and confusing as it's mostly me venting.
I've used to love my dad, he was the best. We did so much togheter, built a treehouse(or he did, I held the tools and thought I was contributing) camped, worked in his workshop he had at home for fun and stuff like that. He even saved my lige when I was 4 or 5. I had gotten a remote controled toy car as an early Christmas gift but accidentally stepped on it and fell, hitting my neck on the edge of the table and I mean like the 90degre corner edge. He rushed me to the hospital just to be told it wasn't serious and we went home but came back a day or two later when I developed a huge lump on my neck. Again they said it wasn't serious and sent us home, but things only got worse and he took me back this time demanding they took a scan of my neck. And low and behold if they had waited like 3 days I would never have been here. So yeah we where close and he was my everything and my hero.
Then disaster. When I was 7 my mom and dad told me they where separating of course me and my younger brothers where devastated (mostly me as they didn't really understand). Then a couple of weeks later my dad got taken away by the police, but i didn't know why. All i knew was that it was my mom's fault. Then I began hearing rumors at school. Just for context we lived in a small town so rumors where everything and they spread fast and went out of control almost as quick. At first I heard that my dad had threatened my mom, then a knife came in to the picture and soon a gun. The rumors kept getting worse and people kept coming to me and asking if they where true. In the end my mom had to tell me the truth. My dad had hit her and threatened her because he had finally realized that they weren't just taking a break but they where getting divorced. So my father went to prison and we of course came to visit him once in a while but as my mom wasn't allowed to go with and was too scared too, a prison priest took us. It was weird seeing my dad like that but I still loved him.
From that point on my dad have never been the same or maybe he has but I just never saw it back then. He began talking badly about my mom and making us believe all his lies. Like how he was innocent, how he had proof and how it was all my mom's fault. Throughout it all my mom was amazing, she was dealing with PTSD (from what happened between them), raising three boys and she never once tried to make us resent our dad. Yes she defended herself because she wouldn't lose us to his lies but she always made it clear that despite everything he was still our dad and we should cherish our bond with him. Unfortunately noone is perfect and my mom made a mistake that would forever impact us. In her loneliness and desperate for help state she found a guy. He seemed awsome but he was everything but. This story is going to be too long if I explain about him too but just know he was there for 6 years and is still affecting our mental state to this day.
When my father got out of prison things got worse, I began believing more and more of his lies now that he had a weekend every two weeks to fill my head with lies. I began to hate my mom for what she had done to my dad. Luckily as I got older I saw my dad's true face. It was in the little things, I regularly caught him saying things about my mom I knew was false. After that I began noticing how he never came to anything I invited him to, like school festivals, the time I was performing a play or other stuff like that. I also began noticing how he would promise all kinds of things but never fulfill them. I got so frustrated and angry, and to this day I still can't believe anything he says without a voice in my head saying ""what if he is lying"".
I also began feeling neglected by him and at some point I felt something had to be done so I took a talk with him but all I got from him was ""you are a child it isn't your responsibility to be the one fixing things it should be me"" and yeah it should be he didn't so I had to. I had to grow up fast to learn how to communicate with people like him, how to handle him, how to talk in a way that wouldn't get him defensive but still get my point across. These are all skills I'm now very glad I have as they help not just with him but in many situations.
Sadly I eventually realized our relationship was a lost cause, but in stead of giving up I kept pressing on. Because even if I didn't get anything from it maybe it would help him realize that if he kept this up he would eventually lose my brothers and me. Sadly our relationship have only gotten worse but at least I can say I have managed to preserve his and my brothers relationship. This is something I'm very proud of as I know how much it hurts to be in this situation and I don't ever want my brothers to feel this way. But after a little over 8 years of struggling (I began trying to fix things when I was around 12 and I'm 21 now) I have finally given up on him.
I know this has been long and I hope I haven't lost everyone, there's just so much to say that I wouldn't be able to write it all. But it's almost over.
Around 9 months back I went to my dad's place and made a last ditch effort to fix us. Until this point I've always been very gentle with him as that is how he works but this time I told him how I felt, all be it without yelling or using nasty words. I put it simple for him and said I was tired of it all and I couldn't do this anymore. I told him how much he hurt me throughout the years and I put a lot of emphasis on how much it hurt when he made the same mistakes with my brothers as he had made with me. I also told him that if he didn't start contributing I was done with him. After around an hour of talking I left and I didn't hear anything from him. I had a backpacking trip in south America planed in 3 months that would last 3 months so my plan was to give him those 6 months to do anything, and I mean anything. The only thing I heard from him was him asking for pictures of my trip, I ignored all those requests as that wasn't him taking initiative and contributing to the relationship but just him being curious. When I came back and hadn't heard anything from him, not even a ""how was the trip"". I realized he was never going to take the initiative and actually invite me to coffee, text me from time to time, call me or my biggest disappointment. Saying sorry for all he had put me through. I have never heard those words from him, not even when we got in fights and wouldn't talk for months I heard them. I always just came back, but not this time. I texted him and made it very clear we where over until he could behave like a dad and say sorry for how he had treated me. I poured my whole soul into that text. I told him everything, I cried texting it. Realizing that when I send this text it would probably be the end, because he would never say sorry, he would never invite me out or call me or anything.
Then today on my 21st birthday he sent me a text like nothing had happened and like we where still talking. I had deliberately not blocked him as I somewhere deep down hopped he would realize his mistake and say sorry. By sending that one ""happy birthday"" text and and greeting me like normal he destroyed all my hopes, and I lost it. I lost it and wrote the nastiest text I have ever written to someone and told him he was a horrible dad and that I hopped I would never see him again. And then i blocked him, so yeah that was my birthday. My first birthday after I moved out and my first birthday without my brothers and my mother and the birthday I will never forget because my dad ruined it.
Again sorry it was so long, hope you all have a better day than me. I will go to bed now as it's 22:22 and I have school tomorrow.",1,1728332707.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1fyhmj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkAdvice/comments/1fyhmj9/i_left_work_due_to_being_sick_and_accidently/,"I left work due to being sick and accidently didn't tell my shift lead or manager, how should I proceed?","TLDR at the end.

Hi everyone, just to start with this is my first time on reddit. If I'm doing this wrong or that I'm on the wring subreddit then just let me know. First thing I should start with is that I'm currently new at my job (only been there a little over a month) and that it's my first job. I work at a chain coffee place that only does drive through. Another thing you should know is that I'm autistic so communication is not the best, but that no one there knows that I'm autistic. So if my wrinting seems off, just know it's probably that. And no, my autism is not an excuse for this, just an explanation of my actions.

I started my job like normal this past Sunday except for feeling not too well but assumed it was just seasonal allergies. Think sore throught, stuffed nose (no sneezing though), and coughing occasionally. I did not have a fever nor was there any vomiting or things like that. I should also mention that my job is hurting for people to work there as its getting very busy now. I start working and everything is fine until I have to take orders through the headset and started to cough pretty badly. Like, I can hardly talk badly. One of my coworkers take over for me as others are asking if I'm ok. I was coughing for like a good few minutes straight and was not feeling well, so I told them no and that I had to leave. 

For more context, all workers there wear headsets we use to communicate with each other and to hear the orders coming in. The only one who doesn't wear a headset is the person running the window station (where customers pay for their coffee and we hand them the coffee). When I was having trouble with headset (coughing) I did see that my shift lead was working window but at that time was wearing a headset. So when I told everyone that I was not well, I assumed that she heard me and was fine with me leaving as she didn't object. (Yes, I know this was a mistake on my part).

As I was getting ready to leave I did here her ask another coworker of mine if I was still here and the coworker said I was here. When I went to leave (having a hard time talking due to my throat and the coughing) I did wave and said goodbye to everyone in a place she definitely would have saw me. I though when I was leaving that I had let my shift lead know and I knew for a fact that all my other coworkers knew and they wished me to get better soon.

When I get home I get a message from my manager asking if everything was alright and that if I was sick I need a doctor's note when I get back and that I should let my shift lead know if there was a family emergency. They ended the note with ""you can't just up and leave"". I should clarify that my manager is a very nice and understaning person who goes out of there way to make sure us employees are having a good time and that she was not at the coffee when I was scheduled to work. I also took 30 minutes to answer this as I had to walk home due to car issues and didn't notce she had messaged me until I got home.

I sent her an apology saying that I was sick and will get a doctor's note (which I have now for when I go back to work). I explained that I told everyone through the headset that I was sick and needed to leave (not that it was really needed since all could hear me coughing and a good number of them went up to me dirctly to ask if I was ok). At least I thought I told everyone, as I found out that my shift lead took off her headset so while she heard and saw my coughing fit, she did not hear me say that I needed to leave.

I also sent a message apologizing to the shift lead for not telling her I was leaving, though I did leave out that I thought she heard me as I thought that would make it sound like I was giving excuses for not telling her. I really did thought I had told her though, especially when I waved and told them all goodbye. I guess I am making up excuses though huh.

I really am sorry about leaving the way I did, I was just super panicked about what to do, could hardly talk, and though she had heard me. I also did not leave immediately as I tried to call family for a ride, but did not get a response. I do see now that I made ALOT of mistakes such as not talking with my shift lead personlly instead if over the headset and not letting my manager know immediately either. I made sure to apologize to both of them for that.

Really I'm just worried that I will get in serious trouble. Another coworker nearly got fired for walking out without telling anyone (not even other coworkers) due to something private that was classified as a non-emergency. So I'm just really worried. I feel guilty to as when I clocked out a huge line of people came through and I just feel so bad.

My manager later messaged me that she understood and to come back with a doctor's note and that we'll have a discussion about communication. My shift lead messaged thanked me for the apology and stated that she wished I had told her before leaving and that she hoped I got better soon. I think this is good? I don't know, I just feel awful about the whole thing and want to set it right, but I also want to explain that I did thought I told her but I think that wouldn't be a good thing to do. I've been worrying about this all day and all of yesterday after work when I realized my mistake, I did not mean to leave without telling her and I feel awful. What should I do?

TLDR; I got sick at work and told everyone through our headsets that I was sick and had to leave. Due to this I though my shift lead had heard me since last I saw she was wearing one. Come to find out she was not wearing the headset but knew I left and didn't hear me explaining that I was sick and had to leave. I apologized when I got home via our messages to both her and our manager. What should I do to make sure I keep this job and right this wrong?",1,1728332647.0,WorkAdvice,1,1.0,False

The harder I trained, the better my sleep was. I woke up feeling like a million bucks. Everything in live became easier. I could concentrate and articulate better and overall it was a major source of hapiness for me. It got to a point where I never felt too lazy to work out because I actually WANTED to do it. I became very passionate about it.

Now here comes the kicker....

For the last year I have been suffering with strange symptoms related to my training. Now when I do any kind of prolonged muscle straining activity, I get poor sleep, overall fatigue, a strange pressure in my head and weird muscle spasms and stings throughout my body. It feels like my body is under some sort of tension that just doesn't want to go away. I feel charged in a bad way. Now the inverse is true regarding sleep, the harder I train the worse my sleep gets. The more volume in the training, the worse the symptoms get. One training session can cause a sort of domino effect where the symptoms stay for a couple days up to a week until they go away. Training in between those days only makes things worse.

When I stopped my training, the symptoms dissapeared gradually. The first couple months I was still having flare ups, but not nearly as intense as when I would exercise. Now I live symtpom free. But as soon as I do any training the symptoms get triggered.

This is the reason I haven't been able to train in over a year. On many occasions I have tried to slowly pick it up but as soon as the intensity goes up I am screwed. Especially doing supersets really triggers it. Doing HIIT cardio also triggers it, but not as much as weight training.

Some things to note:

* Drinking a lot of coffee can trigger the symptoms, but not as much as training.
* I used some basic supplements when I trained (AlphaViril by dr. Sam, vitamin D3 and vitamin C, protein shakes) but have stopped using everything for over a year and it makes no difference.
* I am in general a very relaxed person and don't get worked up easily. I don't overthink or have an active mind before sleep or anytime else. I find it easy to let go. People always commend me for my ability to handle stress.
* I am lucky to say that I don't experience any stress at my job and enjoy working. Nor do I experience stress from my personal life.
* I would describe myself as a mindful person.
* I don't usually feel anxious but when I do, I notice that it makes the symptoms worse. 

This is why I'm fairly certain it's not psychological. It feels physiological.

I have gone to my doctor and got a full bloodwork panel, nothing was out of the ordinary. I got sent to a 'sports doctor' (as they call it here) and he did a PFT test of my lungs, ECG of my heart, and a cardiac stress test. Everything was NORMAL.

I am very sad that I can't train anymore as it made me feel amazing and improved my quality of life greatly. I really hope I can train again one day...",0,1728332143.0,bodyweightfitness,0,0.25,False

My husband (35m) and I (35f) moved into his mother's house (lets call her J) a couple years ago to save money so that when the housing market drops a bit we can afford to buy a house of our own. Besides the usual minor annoyances of living with someone who doesn't always do things to our same standards or preferences, we all get along well. In fact his mother and I have had a great relationship for the whole of the 11+ years he and I have been together. However, tensions have began to increase here and there since she started dating an older woman (lets call her L)... L, has a very fake friendliness whenever she's around my husband or I, and makes very judgmental comments about the things we do around the house, etc... and while J is usually an independent person, around L she becomes very easily manipulated and influenced. This influence resulted in the inciting incident a few days ago...

At the beginning of October I had pulled out our autumn decor boxes as I do every year and decorated the living room. Tapestry, garland, faux hop strigs, and candles on the fireplace. Pumpkin decor all around. Random decor on the coffee table, side tables, etc. I had planned to also do the dining table (not anymore!). A few days in and my husband was at work and I was getting ready in our bathroom with the door closed. I heard L come over and her and J began to make fairly noticeable noises in the living room. I had assumed they were assembling or figuring out the replacement fan system J was going to install in our bathroom once I left for the day. When I came out of the bathroom and walked into the living room I was shocked! L had convinced my MIL to completely rearranged the entire living room, along with some of my decor items, saving only the fireplace decor unaltered, and had either moved my decor or add a bunch of my MIL's decor to the other areas of the room. First of all, the new arrangement is ugly and not functional at all. Secondly, my MIL knows I'm an introvert with depression and anxiety, and have a particular spot in the corner of the living room I call my safe space. Its been my comfort zone for the past few years. I've also been dealing with reproductive system related medical issues and was recently diagnosed with severe iron deficiency anemia. Having a comfortable place I can rest (because my condition often makes me feel tired and weak) is very important. The moment I locked eyes on where she had moved my chair I was furious! There is no way I can feel at ease with where she put it and as I realized she had also moved a bunch of my stuff to who knows where, I just got more and more upset. When I acted shocked in the moment her companion L asked in a bitchy tone ""what? its great!"", to which i could only respond with ""Its a lot!...maybe its the layout?"". She said again in a bitchy tone, ""its a good layout"", and without being able to stop myself I just said, ""No!"" and left the house to go visit my family a few towns away...

I spent most of the car ride pissed my MIL could be so inconsiderate and disrespectful of my space, my condition, etc...and also, I began plotting some petty revenge. 

When I got home that night and talked through everything with my wonderfully supportive husband, I told him my plan to move some of the autumn decor into our room and take down and put away the rest. He laughed and gave me his full support.  We both agreed that if I couldn't feel comfortable in the living room and enjoy all the work I had done,  she shouldn't get to either!

The next morning I received some upsetting medical news about a recent test I had and will likely need surgery in the near future, with the possibility of never being able to have children after. This coupled with the lingering feelings from the previous day fueled my petty desire to get back at her for her actions... So as soon as she left the house for an appointment, I got to work enacting my revenge! Putting what decor I could into our room, and taking the bits of decor off the tables and back into their boxes. She sadly came home before I could finish the fireplace, but in a last minute bit of pettiness I opened her antique clock and stopped it from ticking. She knows I hate the sound of ticking clocks, but often starts them up when L is around (its strange), but now I sit and wait for her to realize what's happening...and yes, its bringing me great joy in this less than ideal time.

...I will finish my petty work when she leaves again...

So AITA for reacting like this, or are my actions justified? ",1,1728332060.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,0.67,False

1fyhbpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1fyhbpm/be_careful_about_caffeine/,Be careful about caffeine! ,"Nicotine doubles the rate at which caffeine is metabolized, and greatly reduces the effects of caffeine.

I fully quit zyns 5 days ago so nicotine is really out of my system now. Yesterday I was so low energy and was craving a bigger pick me up, so had an extra cup of coffee.

I felt terrible and dissociated all day, and around 5 pm got a full blown panic attack. Like one of those ones so bad I was unsure if I needed to go to the hospital.

It was a risk to my nicotine sobriety, because I blamed it all on quitting and started to think there’s no way I can do this.

But turns out I basically ingested 4 times my normal level of caffeine unknowingly, on top of my withdrawal symptoms, and I feel better today and glad I stuck it out.

Be careful! Quitting makes you crave caffeine, but that insane pump of anxiety from caffeine being more effective will confuse you and make you question quitting lol. ",4,1728331897.0,QuittingZyn,0,1.0,False
