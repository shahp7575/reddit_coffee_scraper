Up till now the only type of coffee I have had are instant ones , and maybe I might have tried fresh brewed coffe sometime unknoiin some cafe but im sure rhey must be loaded with sweet creamer or some sort of flavour.
Recently I have had few coffee related content on my feed and reels, so it has really made me think does freshly brude coffee really taste distinctively better than instant coffee for a non coffee enthusiast ,  I only drink coffee here and there for its taste ,so will I be able to taste any difference.
Plus does all these method like pourover, French press, Mocha pot etc make any sort of difference I know the beans itself will make a difference cause come on it's a different bean all together but won't I have same result if I use the same roast level along with same grinded level any method?
And before you answer as I said I am not a coffee enthusiast so even I don't expect that I would be able to taste those subtle notes or the nuanced flavours.",1,1749024614.0,pourover,1,0.67,False

Gained 2.4lbs. Relaxed my no fizzy drink rule because it was almost impossible to stick to just water there (first since Jan 5th!). Had a couple vodka lemonades and a few lagers/shandys (the first alcoholic drink since NYE). Ate a fuck tonne of carbs in comparison to my new normal, but tried to stay somewhat sensible.

Was not surprised by the ""gain"" (which was probably majority water weight from the higher carbs, salt intake and travel itself!). Felt very bloated but was confident this time with mounjaro this would not make me spiral and I'd get back on it.

Actually had my first kebab since I began in January the first day home because I was too tired to cook what with the travel, lack of sleep and mountains of washing and unpacking I did. Lost 4oz the morning after.

After that I was back to OMAD, drinking only water/flavoured water/squash/coffee/tea, not pushing past the full feeling like I definitely did a couple nights on holiday and less carbs.

Within 2 days I'd lost the majority of the holiday weight (bar 2oz). By day 3 I was down 1.6lbs from my pre holiday weight! 

I wouldn't say I was in a stall beforehand as it wasn't long enough to classify as one, but I was in some sort of ""mini stall"" where I'd only lost (and regained, and lost again a few times) the same 1lb for 2 weeks, which was unusual for me when my average is actually closer to ~3lbs a week, so I think relaxing on things and getting away may have kick started losses again.. that or it's just coincidence, either way I'm happy about it!

I blamed myself constantly. I remembered every little thing: the one coffee I had, that stressful deadline at work, the time I lifted something heavy. I told myself I wasn't careful enough, that my body failed. My husband was sympathetic, holding me while I cried, telling me it wasn't my fault.

The truth is, he was drinking heavily during that time. Almost every night. He'd come home late, sometimes stumbling, and often forgot little things I asked for, like reminding him to pick up my prenatal vitamins when he went to the store, or making sure I got enough rest when I was exhausted. One night, I had severe cramping and called him to come home from a bar, but he ""lost track of time"" and didn't show up until hours later, by which point I was already in the emergency room alone.

I never connected his behavior to the miscarriage until recently. I was talking to a friend who is a doctor, and I casually mentioned his heavy drinking during that period. She gently, so gently, suggested that a partner's chronic neglect and the stress it causes, especially when it impacts basic needs like getting proper medication or rest, absolutely can contribute to a high-risk pregnancy outcome.

It hit me like a ton of bricks. It wasn't the coffee. It wasn't the stress at work. It was his selfishness, his addiction, and my desperation to cover for him that put my body under impossible strain.

He still thinks I blame myself. He still acts like a supportive husband who endured ""our shared tragedy."" I can't look at him the same way anymore. The guilt is gone, replaced by a searing anger. And I can't tell him because it would shatter our lives.",0,1749023506.0,offmychest,2,0.5,False

‚ÄúI want to file for divorce.‚Äù

The words had been stuck in my throat for years‚Äîuntil that night. I had cooked his favorite meal, worn a dress he once loved, and dared to ask about the trip he promised me decades ago.

‚ÄúParis?‚Äù he scoffed, eyes glued to his laptop. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not that young anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúTwenty years ago, you said that one day, when things got better, we‚Äôd go. We‚Äôd celebrate properly. I just‚Ä¶ want to enjoy something after taking care of you, the kids, and this house‚Äî‚Äù

My family. Everyone‚Ä¶ but me. They hadn‚Äôt just excluded me. They had replaced me.

That‚Äôs when I knew I had to leave. After twenty years of being nothing but convenient, I finally woke up‚Äîand chose myself. I booked a one-way ticket to Paris and forgot about them. Only for them to realize my worth when it was too late.

\--

‚ÄúI want to file for divorce.‚Äù

The words came out steady as if they had been waiting in my throat all along, finally tasting air for the first time.

There was a pause on the other end of the line. ‚ÄúAre you sure about this, ma‚Äôam? You‚Äôve been married for twenty years.‚Äù

I looked around my bedroom‚Äîthe walls I painted, the curtains I sewed, the furniture I polished every weekend like some loyal housemaid. The scent of lavender fabric softener clung to the bedsheets. Everything was clean. Perfect. Lifeless.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said, firm this time. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure. File it as soon as possible. I want to leave this house immediately.‚Äù

I hung up before I could hear her response.

The silence afterward was strange‚Äîpeaceful, but laced with a kind of ache only a woman like me would understand. The ache of finality. Of choosing myself after being forgotten for far too long.

I stared at my reflection in the mirror. My lips trembled, but I didn‚Äôt cry. Not yet.

Instead, my mind drifted back to that moment. The exact one where I knew this marriage‚Äîthis life‚Äîwas over.

It was a quiet evening. The house smelled like fresh pasta. I had spent the whole afternoon preparing his favorite meal. I wore a soft blue dress I hadn‚Äôt worn in years, thinking maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîhe would notice.

I sat beside him on the couch, watching him review some documents from his firm, and then finally asked him about my dream destination, Paris, which he‚Äôd promised me.

‚ÄúParis?‚Äù he repeated with a laugh, not even looking up from his laptop. ‚ÄúWhat for? You‚Äôre not that young anymore. Can‚Äôt we skip the formalities? It‚Äôs not important.‚Äù

I stood there, holding my breath like a delicate glass.

‚ÄúYou promised,‚Äù I said softly. ‚ÄúTwenty years ago. You said one day, when things are better, we‚Äôll go. We‚Äôd celebrate properly.‚Äù

Kier leaned back in his chair and narrowed his eyes. ‚ÄúWith what money? Are you using your savings? Oh, wait‚Äîyou don‚Äôt have your own money.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt it be a gift? I just‚Ä¶ want to enjoy something. After taking care of you. Of the kids. Of this house‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, so we tired you out?‚Äù he snapped. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make it sound like I forced you into this. You‚Äôre just staying home. What‚Äôs even hard about your job? I make the money. You get to sit in the comfort of this house and complain about wanting a vacation.‚Äù

Your job.

That word always scraped at me like a dull knife. As if motherhood, marriage, and being a woman were simple lines on a to-do list. As if the years I spent making everyone else‚Äôs life easier meant nothing. Like my work began and ended in the kitchen.

He went on. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you be more like your sister Camille? She‚Äôs not even your sister by blood, and yet she‚Äôs miles ahead. Unmarried, independent, smart‚Äîshe earned her own money and place in the world. She can travel wherever she wants and doesn‚Äôt burden anyone for it.‚Äù

Camille. The orphan they adopted when I was fifteen. The golden girl who walked into our lives and stole every single piece of love I thought I owned.

Before I could respond, my father walked in‚ÄîDavid, stern as ever, with that gaze that had never once looked at me with pride.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs right,‚Äù he said, sipping tea as if he hadn‚Äôt just walked into a storm. ‚ÄúCamille is the better woman. Smart. Practical. Knows what she wants.‚Äù

Then he looked at me.

‚ÄúYou, Erika‚Ä¶ you were born into this house, but sometimes I wonder if that was the real mistake.‚Äù

I stared at him, silent.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason why Camille‚Äôs thriving and you‚Äôre still stuck ironing clothes and burning food. If I had a choice, she‚Äôd be my daughter. She doesn‚Äôt rely on men for anything.‚Äù

The room spun, my breath tightening. I didn‚Äôt reply. I never did. I had learned over the years that pain was quieter when swallowed.

But that didn‚Äôt mean it didn‚Äôt hurt.

I thought I could endure that and continue living this life, but not until that same night.¬†He left his laptop open on the dining table. The email app still running. I wasn‚Äôt snooping. I swear, I wasn‚Äôt. But the subject line caught my eye:

‚ÄúParis ‚Äì Wedding Confirmation‚Äù

My heart stopped. I clicked it.

Inside was a beautifully crafted itinerary. Elegant fonts. Gold accents. Venue details. Champagne menus.

A wedding. In Paris. Kier and Camille.

And the guest list? My father. My son. His wife.

My family.

Everyone‚Ä¶ but me.

They hadn‚Äôt just excluded me. They had replaced me.

I finally snapped when I heard Kier‚Äôs voice from the bedroom.¬†

‚ÄúErika!‚Äù

I turned slightly.

He threw a wrinkled shirt at me.

‚ÄúYou really don‚Äôt know how to do your job? What on earth did you do to my clothes?‚Äù

Chapter 2

The shirt hit my face with a sharp snap, then fell to the floor.

‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù Kier barked, glaring at the wrinkled garment. ‚ÄúWhy the heck isn‚Äôt this done yet?‚Äù

I bent to pick it up, blood from the wound on my palm still seeping into the bandage.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I said softly. ‚ÄúI got caught up with the laundry, and I was cleaning‚Äîthen the vase earlier‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, so you‚Äôre still making excuses now?‚Äù His voice rose. ‚ÄúIs that it, Erika? You want a Paris honeymoon but can‚Äôt even do basic chores?‚Äù

He threw a second bundle of white clothes at me, this one speckled with a pale yellow stain.

‚ÄúAnd what about this? Look at it!‚Äù he snapped. ‚ÄúYou ruined it. This is designer. Do you even know how expensive this was?‚Äù

I stared at the stain‚Äîbarely visible‚Äîbut in his eyes, it was a catastrophe.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see it,‚Äù I murmured. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll fix it.‚Äù

‚ÄúGod, Erika,‚Äù he exclaimed. ‚ÄúThis is your job. Your only job. You get to sit in this house, have whatever you want handed to you, and the one thing I ask‚Äîkeep the house in order‚Äîand even that‚Äôs too hard?‚Äù

Before I could gather my words, the front door opened, and a familiar voice rang out, honey-sweet and full of sparkle.

‚ÄúKier! Brother-in-law! Why are you shouting again?‚Äù Camille.

She entered with her usual grand entrance‚Äîsun-kissed from her trip, her long curls bouncing, arms full of designer bags and luggage with tags still hanging from them.

‚ÄúOh, look at this!‚Äù she grinned, placing the gifts down. ‚ÄúSpain was beautiful. You‚Äôd love it, Kier. I brought you something.‚Äù

Kier immediately softened. ‚ÄúCamille, you didn‚Äôt have to‚Äî‚Äù

She held out a sleek box. ‚ÄúThese are custom pieces from Madrid. Only a few made. I saw them and thought of you.‚Äù

He opened the box like a child with a toy, smiling wide.

Then Camille looked at me, feigning concern. ‚ÄúWhy were you shouting at my sister? She looks tired. Look at her hands‚Äîshe‚Äôs clearly been working hard. Don‚Äôt worry about the shirt. I brought you new ones.‚Äù

And just like that, I faded into the background again.

The front door opened once more.

‚ÄúCamille! My star!‚Äù my father David boomed, walking in with arms full of gifts. ‚ÄúHow was the trip? Tell us everything!‚Äù

She hugged him like the daughter he always wished I had been. ‚ÄúI closed the deal. It‚Äôs done!‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course you did,‚Äù David beamed. ‚ÄúI always say‚Äîbest decision I ever made was bringing you into this family.‚Äù

They laughed. They toasted water glasses. They complimented each other like a well-rehearsed play.

I stood in the corner like a piece of furniture.

Then Kier turned to me, already irritated. ‚ÄúWell? What are you doing just standing there? Go prepare food for your sister. She just brought us gifts, the least you could do is cook.‚Äù

Camille walked toward me with another box.

‚ÄúSis, I got something for you too,‚Äù she said with a fake smile. ‚ÄúSince I know you love cooking‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs an apron. With matching kitchen mitts and measuring cups. Cute, right? You can wear it now while making dinner.‚Äù

I stared at it, lips tightening. I forced a small nod.

‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

‚ÄúSay it properly,‚Äù my father barked. ‚ÄúWhere are your manners?‚Äù

I swallowed the lump in my throat. ‚ÄúThank you, Camille.‚Äù

‚ÄúSee?‚Äù David grunted. ‚ÄúStop babying her, Camille. She should be grateful. Let her show it through actions. Go, cook for us.‚Äù

So I cooked.

I cut. I chopped. I stirred and fried and cleaned, bleeding and aching all the while. I did it like I always did‚Äîwithout complaint, without recognition.

But when I called them to the table, I was met with silence.

Kier was the first to speak. ‚ÄúActually, don‚Äôt bother. We‚Äôre heading out.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúCamille closed a major deal. We‚Äôre going to celebrate at Florentina‚Äôs. You know, that new luxury place near the harbor.‚Äù

Camille laughed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll love it, Kier. I booked the private balcony. It‚Äôs stunning.‚Äù

Then she turned to me, suddenly remembering. ‚ÄúCome with us, sis?‚Äù

But before I could answer, Kier scoffed. ‚ÄúNo need. Erika doesn‚Äôt even understand what the deal was about. She‚Äôll be out of place. Doesn‚Äôt even have clothes for a place like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe can borrow mine‚Äî‚Äù Camille offered half-heartedly.

Kier waved her off. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs staying. She‚Äôs behind on the laundry anyway.‚Äù

And like that, they all agreed. Camille smiled, my father chuckled, and my husband kissed Camille‚Äôs hand like it was nothing.

And I‚Äîonce again‚Äîwas left standing in a kitchen filled with steam, silence, and the scent of food no one would eat.

That night, after washing every plate, folding napkins, and mopping the floor, I sank onto the couch.

I opened my phone to escape‚Äîto scroll, to feel something other than this ache.

That‚Äôs when I saw it.

A new post. From my son.

Joseph.

I clicked.

There they were.

In Florentina‚Äôs.

Laughing. Drinking. Eating. Clinking wine glasses. My son. My husband. My father. Camille. Smiling like they were a perfect family.

Without me.

I stared at the screen, my hands trembling.

No caption. No mention. Just a perfect picture of everything I wasn‚Äôt allowed to be part of.

I had cooked for them. Served them. Loved them.

And they had forgotten me. Left me.

Again.

The tears came quietly this time. Not loud or dramatic. Just slow, tired, and steady. I didn‚Äôt sob. I didn‚Äôt scream.

I just let the ache fall from my eyes‚Ä¶ because no one was ever going to notice.

Chapter 3

My eyes were swollen when I woke up. I must‚Äôve cried myself to sleep on the couch because the stiffness in my back told me I hadn‚Äôt moved all night.

And I was late.

I scrambled to my feet, realizing with horror that I hadn‚Äôt prepared breakfast‚Äîthe one thing they expected from me without fail, every single day.

As I rushed into the kitchen, I heard the sharp edge of Kier‚Äôs voice from the dining room.

‚ÄúWhere have you been?‚Äù he snapped, seeing me step into the room. ‚ÄúStill sleeping at this hour? Where‚Äôs breakfast?‚Äù

Before I could open my mouth, Camille emerged from the kitchen with a spatula in hand, smiling as if none of it was serious.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù she said brightly. ‚ÄúI already started cooking. She‚Äôs tired, so I let my sister sleep a little longer.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Kier barked. ‚ÄúShe should be ashamed of herself. Sleeping while you, our guest, cook? All she does is stay home, and now she‚Äôs even pushing her responsibility onto you?‚Äù

He turned to me, fuming. ‚ÄúHave some care for the people feeding you. Do something useful.‚Äù

I lowered my gaze and stepped past Camille quietly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I said softly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll handle the cooking. You just sit and wait.‚Äù

Camille smiled, brushing her hair over her shoulder. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs just chopping vegetables. Don‚Äôt make it a big deal.‚Äù

But before I could respond, our father walked in, placing a mug on the table.

‚ÄúEven if it‚Äôs just chopping, you shouldn‚Äôt do that, Camille,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYour hands aren‚Äôt made for the kitchen. You‚Äôre a designer, not a housemaid. Let Erika handle it‚Äîit‚Äôs her thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a big deal, Dad,‚Äù Camille said with a small laugh, taking a knife anyway. ‚ÄúI can help.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, really, I‚Äôll do it,‚Äù I said again, trying to take the knife from her hand.

But she insisted, and I didn‚Äôt want to start an argument in front of everyone, so I let it go.

We stood side by side at the counter, both cutting vegetables in a tense silence, until suddenly‚Äî

‚ÄúAgh!‚Äù Camille shrieked.

Blood dripped from her finger. She dropped the knife as Kier rushed into the kitchen in panic.

‚ÄúWhat on earth happened?!‚Äù he shouted, grabbing her hand. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre bleeding! For heaven's sake, Camille, your hand‚Äîdo you even know how important that is?! You have a presentation next week!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs just a scratch‚Äî‚Äù

Kier turned on me before she could even finish.

‚ÄúThis is your fault! You useless woman! You let her get hurt in your own kitchen! You couldn‚Äôt even chop those vegetables yourself?‚Äù

I was stunned. ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù

But it didn‚Äôt matter. Camille tried to defend me, but her voice was drowned out by the chaos. They were all hovering over her, pressing tissues to her wound, blaming me for things I hadn‚Äôt done.

And I didn‚Äôt even have the chance to explain that I had a wound too.

The cut I got from cleaning up the broken vase hadn‚Äôt healed, and now with the kitchen work, it had split open again.

But no one noticed. So I quietly stepped away, my bleeding hand hidden under the edge of my apron, and went back to my room.

I sat on the edge of the bed, peeled off the bandage, and sighed as I pressed a clean towel to the reopened wound. The sting was sharp, but the silence stung more.

Then the door burst open.

Kier.

‚ÄúApologize to Camille,‚Äù he ordered.

I looked at him. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt my fault. She insisted. It was an accident.‚Äù

He narrowed his eyes. ‚ÄúSo what? You‚Äôre still responsible. Apologize.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hurt her.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care. Just do it.‚Äù

Before I could respond, Camille entered the room too, still holding her bandaged finger.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù she said, her voice soft now. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need for that. My sister is not at fault. It‚Äôs on me.‚Äù

I forced a nod, though my throat burned.

Camille glanced at Kier. ‚ÄúAnyway, we need to talk about the trip. Only three days away now.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, right,‚Äù Kier said, his tone shifting instantly. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre heading to Paris. Business trip. I‚Äôll need you to pack our things. I‚Äôm going, Camille‚Äôs going, and your dad too.‚Äù

Paris.

My heart skipped.

‚ÄúCan I come?‚Äù I asked before I could stop myself.

They both looked at me.

Kier let out a harsh laugh. ‚ÄúYou? Erika, it‚Äôs a business trip, not a vacation. Don‚Äôt dream too high. You wouldn‚Äôt even know how to keep up with the conversations. You‚Äôd just embarrass us.‚Äù

‚ÄúI could just‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he cut in. ‚ÄúThis is for work. Camille‚Äôs part of the brand‚Äôs pitch. You‚Äôd be out of place. You don‚Äôt even have clothes for something like this.‚Äù

‚ÄúI could‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôll stay,‚Äù he said flatly, turning to Camille. ‚ÄúShe can finish the chores while we‚Äôre gone.‚Äù

Camille hesitated, eyes flicking to me with what might have been pity‚Äîor performance. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll bring you something back,‚Äù she offered, with a thin smile.

My lips stretched into a small nod, but I felt it. The heat behind my eyes. The silence in my throat. The lump in my chest I had learned to swallow every day.

And then they laughed.

Not mean-spirited, not sharp‚Äîbut casual. The way people laugh when they‚Äôre comfortable, when they forget someone else is in the room. Like I was a joke. Like I wasn‚Äôt even there.

Their voices trailed down the hallway as they made plans‚Äîrestaurants in Paris, what Camille should wear, how the photos would look.

I turned slowly, walked into our room, and shut the door behind me.

No tears this time. Just stillness.

I moved on instinct, pulling the suitcase from under the bed, unfolding shirts, checking lists, laying out Camille‚Äôs makeup bag, folding Kier‚Äôs blazers. I didn‚Äôt think‚ÄîI just did what I had always done: prepared everyone else‚Äôs life while mine sat on the shelf, untouched.

But then I saw it‚ÄîKier‚Äôs laptop.

It was still open, still glowing faintly on the nightstand. Like it was waiting for me.

I hesitated.

And then I moved toward it.

It took just one click.

There it was.

A photo. Clear as day.

Kier in a tailored suit. Camille in a white dress, smiling like she had already won. The Eiffel Tower blurred behind them, gold lights blinking in the background. Pre-nup photoshoot ‚Äì Paris folder.

Another scroll down showed the wedding date. The one I‚Äôd seen in the email before. Confirmed.

They weren‚Äôt even trying to hide it anymore.

I stared at it.

But I didn‚Äôt cry.

Instead, I picked up my phone.

I dialed the gallery‚Äîthe one I‚Äôd visited in secret once, where the photos lined the walls, each one glimmering with confidence and artistry. I remembered the way the assistant had smiled at me when I lingered in front of the bridal portrait display.

The phone rang once. Twice.

‚ÄúHow may I help you?‚Äù

I breathed in, slow and steady. Then spoke.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to schedule a wedding shoot. A pre-nup session.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, ma‚Äôam. May I ask the name of the bride and the groom?‚Äù

I paused.

Then smiled softly to myself.

‚ÄúThere is no groom,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúJust the bride. Me. Alone.‚Äù

Because I was finally choosing myself.

Chapter 4

The necklace was gone.

I checked the drawer again, hands trembling. I sifted through scarves, opened every little pouch and box. Nothing. My chest began to tighten, panic seeping in like cold water.

No. No, no‚Äîit had to be here.

I turned the whole vanity upside down. And then it hit me.

Kier.

I rushed out of the bedroom, still in my robe, feet bare against the cold floor, and found him at the dining table, sipping his usual black coffee, flipping through files as if the world didn‚Äôt just tilt on its axis.

‚ÄúKier,‚Äù I said, my voice already breaking, ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs my necklace? The silver one with the black stone. The one in the velvet box.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt even glance up. ‚ÄúOh, that? Gave it to Camille. Looked great on her. She‚Äôs wearing it in Paris.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúYou gave it to Camille?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Relax.‚Äù He flipped a page. ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt using it.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was mine,‚Äù I said quietly, my voice tight. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt even ask.‚Äù

He finally looked at me, sighing like I was a burden. ‚ÄúErika. Be real. You probably bought it with my card anyway. What‚Äôs yours is mine, right? Why are you making this a thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I didn‚Äôt buy it with your card,‚Äù I snapped, hurt flooding my voice. ‚ÄúI bought it with my own money. Money I earned‚Äîon my own.‚Äù

His brow lifted slightly. ‚ÄúDoing what?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been designing again,‚Äù I said, my voice shaking. ‚ÄúFreelance. Quiet jobs. I‚Äôve been saving for five years. That necklace‚Ä¶ it was the first thing I bought for me in a long time.‚Äù

Kier scoffed. ‚ÄúDesigning? What, kitchen aprons and pillowcases?‚Äù

I took a step back.

‚ÄúYou really don‚Äôt know me at all anymore, do you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being dramatic,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a necklace. I‚Äôll get you a new one.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was limited edition,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúAnd I was going to wear it today. I was invited to a fashion show. I wanted to look like the woman I used to be, even for a day.‚Äù

Kier‚Äôs laugh cut through the air like a whip. ‚ÄúYou? A fashion show?‚Äù He shook his head. ‚ÄúErika, let‚Äôs be honest. You‚Äôll be laughed at.‚Äù

I froze.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not that woman anymore,‚Äù he continued, like it was a fact he had long accepted. ‚ÄúYou belong here. In this house. With your apron and your routines. Camille, on the other hand‚Äîshe belongs on runways, in Paris, with people who matter.‚Äù

He stood, collected his folder, and headed toward the door.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go to that show,‚Äù he said without turning back. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll only embarrass yourself. I told you to pack for our things, right? Is it ready now? Do it! Make sure that we will not forget anything.‚Äù¬†

He left.

And I just stood there. No more tears. Just this strange, burning quiet in my chest. Not sadness, not heartbreak‚Äîjust hatred. For the way I let myself become so small. For the way they never even had to raise their voices to crush me. For the way I spent twenty years handing out pieces of myself until there was nothing left but duties and silence.

I sat on the edge of the bed and looked around our bedroom‚Äîour curated little cage. The walls I had decorated. The sheets I washed. The photo frames that no longer held memories, just proof that I had once existed beside him.

I should‚Äôve done this sooner.

I should‚Äôve loved myself sooner.

But for twenty years, I chose to love a man who didn‚Äôt see me. I chose to serve a family that never said thank you. I chose quiet over conflict, sacrifice over self.

And what did it get me? Nothing.

I stood up.

I pulled out the dress I had planned to wear for the fashion show‚Äîthe one Kier said was ‚Äútoo loud‚Äù for someone like me. I wore it proudly. Fixed my hair the way I liked it. Put on the lipstick he once said made me look ‚Äútoo old to matter.‚Äù

And then I left the house. They wouldn‚Äôt notice anyway.

I hailed a cab and gave the address to the gallery to finally do the photoshoot.

The assistant greeted me. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ready for you,‚Äù she said, leading me into the sunlit studio. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll look beautiful.‚Äù

I stepped in front of the camera.

The photographer adjusted the lens. ‚ÄúAre you sure you want these to look like bridal portraits‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôll be alone?‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúYes. I don‚Äôt have a husband.‚Äù

He nodded and then started taking photos.¬†With every shot, I felt lighter. As if I were slowly peeling off the layers of someone else‚Äôs expectations.

I remembered Kier‚Äôs words from long ago‚Äîthe ones that once made me stay.

‚ÄúErika, I know Camille is a star, but she‚Äôll never want someone like me. She wants her career. You? You‚Äôll stay. You‚Äôll care. You‚Äôll be my peace.‚Äù

He said he would give me the best life in return.

He gave me a kitchen. He gave Camille everything else.

I stood beneath the soft lights and smiled at the camera. Not a forced smile, not the kind I wore when guests came over or when Camille handed me a gift ‚Äújust because.‚Äù

This smile was mine.

I left the studio with a print in hand. A single photograph of me in a dress I chose, in a life I finally began to claim.

That evening, the house was still empty. They had all gone out‚Äîanother dinner, maybe another celebration. Probably laughing, posting photos I wasn‚Äôt in.

I didn‚Äôt care.

Because I wasn‚Äôt staying.

I opened my laptop. My fingers hovered over the keyboard.

Flight to Paris ‚Äì One seat.

I clicked.

Booked.

I would go to Paris‚Äînot as a wife or a plus-one.

Not as a ghost in someone else‚Äôs celebration.

But as a woman fulfilling her own dream.

Chapter 5

The next morning, I stayed in bed, the suitcase zipped and ready by the door. I heard footsteps, voices, laughter in the hallway. I didn‚Äôt move.

But then Kier barged into the room, annoyed. ‚ÄúWhere is the necklace?‚Äù

I sat up slowly. ‚ÄúWhat necklace?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat necklace‚Äîthe limited edition one I gave to Camille. It‚Äôs missing. Did you take it back?‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúWhy would I take it back? You‚Äôre the one who gave it away. Without even asking me.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gone,‚Äù he growled. ‚ÄúShe was supposed to wear it today. And now you‚Äôve stooped low enough to steal it back? Unbelievable.‚Äù

I stared at him, stunned. ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs low?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is why you‚Äôre not coming with us,‚Äù he snapped. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt deserve to be treated right. You‚Äôve always been petty, Erika.‚Äù

Before I could answer, Camille entered the room, a bit flustered. ‚ÄúWait, wait‚Äîit‚Äôs not her fault. I must have misplaced it. Don‚Äôt get mad at her.‚Äù

Their father, David, appeared behind them, tapping his watch. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to be late. Just buy another if you need to. Let‚Äôs go. Erika‚Äîmake sure the house is clean by the time we return.‚Äù

And that was that.

They left.

No hug. No goodbye. No thank-you for the twenty years I gave them.

Just orders. Just silence.

I stood by the window and watched the car pull away, taking with it everything that once convinced me I was part of a family.

A few hours later, my phone buzzed.

Camille: Hey sis, we found the necklace! I‚Äôm so sorry about earlier. I‚Äôll buy you something nice to make it up. Thank you again for letting me wear it‚Äîit‚Äôs so beautiful!

Then another ping.

Kier: Black card‚Äôs on the table. Buy whatever you want while we‚Äôre gone.

I read both messages and laughed. Softly, bitterly.

This was always the cycle, wasn‚Äôt it?

Hurt me. Humiliate me. Then hand me a credit card like it was a balm for the wounds they never acknowledged. As if the ability to shop would erase the fact that I was unwanted. Unloved. Undervalued.

But not this time.

I looked around the quiet house‚Äîempty now, like a ghost town echoing with memories that didn‚Äôt serve me anymore. Today, I was finished being their shadow.

I walked slowly to the living room, retrieved the envelope I had tucked beneath the couch cushion the night before, and placed it neatly on the coffee table.

Inside were the divorce papers, and also our wedding ring.

I stood for a long moment in the doorway. One last glance. Not for nostalgia. Just confirmation.

I wasn‚Äôt coming back.

At the airport, I sat near Gate 18, sipping quietly on a paper cup of coffee, staring at the glowing screen of my phone. I let myself smile. My life was beginning‚Äîat the exact moment they thought they had erased me.

I was mid-scroll through a rooftop restaurant review when a familiar voice sliced through the air.

‚ÄúNo way. My passport‚Äîwhere is it?‚Äù

Camille.

I froze. They were across the terminal, laughing, wheeling their designer luggage, wrapped in joy. My father, David, adjusting his tie. My son‚Äôs wife snapping a picture of the group. And Camille‚Äîrummaging through her purse, visibly agitated.

I doubt if they would even notice me as they‚Äôre busy on their own lives.¬†

Kier rubbed his forehead. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to be kidding me. Didn‚Äôt Erika pack it for you?‚Äù

Camille blinked. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Ä¶ I asked her, but I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúShe messed it up again. I told her to check everything,‚Äù Kier muttered, pulling out his phone. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call her. She can drop it off. It‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs busy.‚Äù

Of course.

Even now. Even after everything‚Äîthey still expected me to fix their mess.

My phone rang.

Kier.

Then a message.

Kier: Camille left her passport. Can you bring it to Terminal 2? We‚Äôre at Gate 7. ASAP.

I stared at the screen. The same screen I had waited years to see his name on. Hoping he‚Äôd text I love you. That he was proud of me. That he saw me.

But now‚Ä¶ now all I saw was proof. Proof that even when I was no longer theirs, they still expected me to serve.

I slowly typed my response.

Erika: I don‚Äôt want to do it. I‚Äôm done being your nanny, Kier. Goodbye.

Then I turned off my phone. I stood, lifted my suitcase, and walked toward Gate 18.",1,1749023218.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1

I used to be a mafia princess. Now? I‚Äôm just the help. I gave up my empire for love. Walked away from the Rossini name, the gold, the power‚Äîall for one promise Edmund made me on my eighteenth birthday.

‚ÄúOne day, baby, I‚Äôll take you around the world.‚Äù

Thirty years later, I‚Äôm invisible in my own home. Mocked by my grandsons. Ignored by my son. And replaced‚Äîbody and soul‚Äîby my perfect, venomous sister-in-law, Elizabeth.

I knew. Everyone knew. Elizabeth was Edmund‚Äôs mistress. But I kept my mouth shut. I believed‚Äîfoolishly‚Äîthat Edmund would change.

Then came my forty-eighth birthday.

I dared to ask Edmund for one thing‚Äîa cruise. Just a simple cruise.

He brushed me off like I was nothing.

But the truth hit me like a bullet.

I found their cruise tickets. Edmund and Elizabeth, sailing away with my son, my daughter-in-law, and my grandsons‚Äîall celebrating Elizabeth‚Äôs birthday.

I was left behind by all of them.

I smiled, bitter and cold. Grabbed my suitcase. Booked the next flight back to my real home.

Back to the dangerous daughter of a mafia king‚Äîthe one Edmund always feared and the alliance he‚Äôs been desperate to control.

That was the moment I found my voice‚Äîclear. Calm. Sharper than a blade.

‚ÄúThe divorce papers are waiting for you.‚Äù

There was a stunned pause, then Edmund‚Äôs voice cracked through the line, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre joking. You can‚Äôt divorce me.‚Äù

I laughed. Cold. Cruel. Cutting through the silence like a knife.

‚ÄúI can.‚Äù

\--

I was supposed to be the ghost in the house.

I never asked for jewels. Never asked for roses. Just one promise. One promise.

A cruise.

Edmund had said it back when he still had a soul. ‚ÄúOne day, when we're rich,‚Äù he whispered into my hair, ‚ÄúI'll take you around the world, baby. Just us.‚Äù

That was before the money. Before the empire. Before I became his wife in name, and his maid in practice.

And today‚Äôs my 48th birthday. No one ever greeted me. No cake, no candles.

And I thought maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîit could be mine.

I brought it up after dinner. He was still in his chair, polishing his pistol with that same old cloth like it was a sacred ritual. The flatscreen TV was playing some old Western no one was watching. My heart was pounding harder than it should‚Äôve been.

‚ÄúDo you remember what you told me‚Ä¶ on my 18th birthday?‚Äù I asked quietly.

He didn‚Äôt look up. ‚ÄúWhich part?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat we‚Äôd travel. See the world together. You said once the business settled and our boy was grown‚Ä¶ we‚Äôd go. On a cruise. Just us.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you out of your mind?‚Äù Edmund chuckled, ‚ÄúYou think you deserve a cruise? Look at you. You look like a bamboo stick. One gust and you're gone. You think the captain‚Äôs gonna see you and roll out a red carpet? No, Doris. He‚Äôs gonna think you‚Äôre hauling walking bacteria on board.‚Äù

""But today is‚Äî""

""Today's what?"" He finally looked at me. His face was older, heavier now. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not young anymore. The world‚Äôs not kind to women like you out there. You're not like Elizabeth.‚Äù

There it was. The name that always hovered between us.

Elizabeth. My sister-in-law. His brother‚Äôs widow. Slim, golden-haired, always dressed like she stepped out of a fashion magazine. She judged me with her eyes every time we were in the same room. Edmund never corrected her.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs younger,‚Äù he continued, ‚Äútravels for business. Makes appearances for the family. She‚Äôs part of the image. But you‚Äîyou‚Äôve always been the one behind the scenes. That‚Äôs where you shine. The house. The family. You keep things running.‚Äù

Behind me, the twins were laughing. My grandson.

‚ÄúYeah, Ma, you look like a skeleton in a funeral dress,‚Äù said Lyle, smirking.

‚ÄúSmells like old mop water and something foul,‚Äù Nash added, pinching his nose.

They burst into snorting laughter. No one stopped them. No one ever did.

Lester, our pride and failure, leaned against the fridge and shouted across the kitchen, ‚ÄúHey, Ma. Wash my clothes, yeah? My wife is busy right now. And bleach the white ones this time, unless you wanna ruin another set.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not your maid,‚Äù I murmured.

‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù he snapped.

‚ÄúI said I‚Äôm not‚Äî‚Äù

He threw a half-empty soda can at the floor. ‚ÄúThen what the heck are you? Because you sure as heck ain‚Äôt doing anything else in this house! You don‚Äôt bring money in.‚Äù

My blood boiled.

‚ÄúI raised you,‚Äù I snapped. ‚ÄúFed you. Stayed up when you had fevers. I‚Äôve been working since before you were born.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, maybe you should‚Äôve worked on smelling better. You smell like a rotten corpse,‚Äù one of the twins piped.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù snickered his brother, Nash. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs embarrassing just seeing her. Our classmates said she‚Äôs so ugly, they get scared when she shows up to pick us up. Like some cast member from The Walking Dead.‚Äù

They both burst into giggles. Then Edmund grabbed his pistol off the mantel, inspecting it like it mattered more than me.

‚ÄúWe got money, Doris,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúYou know that. But I‚Äôm not wasting it on some useless help. You‚Äôre here. You got two hands. Why on earth would I hire a maid when you‚Äôre the woman of the house?‚Äù

The woman of the house. That was whatever he called me.

But I didn‚Äôt own anything. Not a car. Not a card.

Every cent I needed, I had to beg for. And if I asked for more? He‚Äôd demand an itemized receipt. Penny by penny.



\---



That night, when the noise died down and the family disappeared into their rooms, I walked to the bedroom, pulled out the old red suitcase from the closet. The one he bought me in Naples before our wedding.

Before the world twisted into what it is now.

I looked down at my hands. They didn‚Äôt look like mine anymore. Lined. Broken. Tired.

I used to be someone. A Rossini. The daughter of a mafia king. The girl born with gold in her mouth and fire in her spine. But I gave that up for love. I disowned myself from my family, thinking Edmund‚Äôs love was enough.

And now?

Now I was just the ghost in the house.

No kingdom. No crown. I have enough already. Maybe, leaving this family is the best birthday I could give to myself.



Chapter 2

The next morning‚Ä¶

I heard about the dinner from Lyle‚Äîhe blurted it out while stuffing potato chips in his mouth.

‚ÄúElizabeth rented the whole top floor of the Luciana Hotel! Fancy, huh? Dad says she booked it just for us. Big celebration.‚Äù

I paused mid-mop. ‚ÄúUs?‚Äù

Nash answered, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not coming, Ma. Grandpa said you're... not up for it. I mean, look at you.""

Not up for it... Like I was sick. Or senile. Or something to be pitied.

By sunset, the house was empty. Edmund had shaved. Wore the cologne he only touched for business deals and funerals. He stood tall in his navy suit, fixing Lyle‚Äôs and Nash collar like a proud grandfather, and Lester wore his best suit.

‚ÄúRemember,‚Äù Edmund said to them, ‚ÄúElizabeth‚Äôs doing this because she loves us. She's family.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe know, grandpa. That's why we love Elizabeth more than Grandma Doris.‚Äù they answered in unison.

And then, nothing. No goodbye. No we‚Äôll bring you something. Just the sound of the front door closing like a coffin lid.

The quiet afterward was insulting. A hollow that screamed louder than any slap.

I stood in the middle of the hallway, in my house slippers, holding a basket of unfolded laundry. My stomach growled. I hadn‚Äôt cooked. What for?

Out of spite, I turned on the TV. They were on the news.

A live segment from the Luciana Hotel.

Cameras panned across crystal chandeliers and violin quartets. There they were‚ÄîElizabeth in her fur shawl. Edmund beside her. My son and his wife smiling like politicians. Lyle and Nash sipping soda in a tiny tuxedo.

The reporter called it: ‚ÄúA private Morroco gathering‚ÄîElizabeth‚Äôs homecoming. The family behind one of the largest shipping fortunes in the country.‚Äù

I was not in the shot. Not in the credits.

Not even in the whispers.

They toasted champagne. I sipped stale coffee.

They laughed under golden light. I wiped a smudge off the glass door.

And just when I thought it couldn‚Äôt cut deeper, the camera caught a brief, brutal moment:

Elizabeth leaned toward Edmund, whispered something, and they both laughed.

My son chuckled too. I didn‚Äôt know what she said. But I knew it was about me.

I felt it in my teeth.

\*\*\*

Hours later, just after midnight, the door opened again. I turned. Hoped, stupidly, it might be my son. But no‚Äîit was them.

Elizabeth‚Äôs heels clicked confidently across the marble as she half-carried Edmund, drunk and swaying, into the house. His tie hung loose, lips pink from too much wine. Eyes bleary, glazed.

‚ÄúOh, Doris,‚Äù Elizabeth said with a smirk, spotting me standing by the staircase like a ghost. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be awake.‚Äù

She steered Edmund toward the hall, her arm looped through his like a bride on her wedding day. ‚ÄúLester and the twins are staying at my penthouse. Too tired to come back. But Edmund‚Ä¶ well, he can‚Äôt sleep in strange beds. Poor thing.‚Äù

A lie.

I knew it.

She came here only to shove the truth down my throat.

‚ÄúI told him not to worry,‚Äù she continued sweetly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd bring him home. Take care of him. It‚Äôs what family does, right?‚Äù

Then she reached into her tote and tossed a plastic container at my feet. It bounced once, landed near the rug.

‚ÄúLeftovers,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúGo eat, sister-in-law. You look like a sickly little stick. You should really take better care of yourself. Bet you weight like 30kls.""

I didn‚Äôt move.

My fingers curled into fists at my side.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll put Edmund to bed,‚Äù she added with a sly smile. ‚ÄúI know you two don‚Äôt share a room anymore. He told me. Said your side of the bed always smells like disappointment.‚Äù

I took one step forward. Just one. My palm twitched. Slapping her would‚Äôve felt good. Almost holy. But what for?

My heart was already cracking in my chest like ice under boots. And the real punishment was in what I saw next‚Äî

Edmund, drunk and limp, smiled at her like she‚Äôd hung the moon. ‚ÄúElizabeth‚Äôs so pretty,‚Äù he mumbled. ‚ÄúSmells like peaches. Mmm. Doris smells like dishwater and arguments.‚Äù

They climbed the stairs together. I stayed behind. Frozen. Shaking. She laughed once more before they disappeared down the hall.

And I realized‚Äî

They didn‚Äôt kill me.

They just replaced me.

\*\*\*

I waited.

Not because I cared. Not because I hoped. But because I needed to know.

The clock ticked past one. Then two. Still no sign of her. The upstairs lights stayed on. No footsteps on the stairs. No sound of a door closing. Only muffled laughter. Then silence.

I sat on the edge of the couch in my robe, untouched coffee cooling on the table. The house smelled of lemon cleaner and betrayal.

Maybe she fell asleep in the guest room. Maybe she just‚Äî

A thump.

Then another.

Not heavy. Rhythmic. Too‚Ä¶ intimate.

My blood chilled.

I rose, like something pulled me forward by the throat. I climbed the stairs, slow as a prayer. The hallway stretched like a graveyard path. The door to our bedroom‚Äîhis bedroom now‚Äîwas cracked open.

And I saw.

Elizabeth, unclothed, straddling Edmund. Her red nails dug into his chest like claws. Her head tilted back in a mess of curls. And Edmund‚Äîmy husband, my life partner of 30 years‚Äîgrunting beneath her like an animal.

My legs stopped working. My mouth went dry.

She cried out loud, shameless, her voice like a blade across my spine.

‚ÄúOhh‚Ä¶ Brother-in-law‚Äîdon‚Äôt stop. Fill me. Ruin me like she never let you.‚Äù

Edmund murmured, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre perfect. Not like her. You‚Äôre everything, Lizzy‚Äî‚Äù

I ran.

I didn‚Äôt cry. I ran. Straight to the downstairs bathroom and vomited until my ribs cramped.

The sound of them still echoed in my ears, louder than sirens.

‚ÄúHarder‚Äîmake me forget she ever existed!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were always the one, Lizzy. Always.‚Äù

He was fifty. She was forty-five.

And still, they had no shame. Not even a sliver of decency. They weren't just in-laws. They weren‚Äôt even just lovers. They were conspirators. Twisting the knife slowly‚Äîtogether.

I stayed on the cold tile floor, knees pressed to my chest, my body shaking in waves I couldn‚Äôt stop. It wasn‚Äôt about the intimacy. It was about being erased.

Replaced.

They didn‚Äôt just want to humiliate me. They wanted to watch me rot in the house I built. But a woman who survives this?

She doesn‚Äôt stay on the bathroom floor. She remembers. She plans. She learns how to haunt quietly.



Chapter 3

I woke before the birds.

No alarm. No reason. Just the reflex of a woman trained to serve everyone but herself.

No tears. No ache. Just breath. In, out. Hollow.

I wiped my face with a damp cloth. Lip balm. Hair tied low. Not beautiful‚Äîjust functional. Alive enough to pass.

Then I reached under the bed.

The red suitase was there. I dragged it out, unzipped it two inches. Cash from quiet sales‚Äîempanadas, lumpia‚Äîno questions asked. Passport, maiden name. A photo of me at eighteen. Smiling. Bold. Untouched by the slow erosion of marriage. I zipped it shut.

Downstairs, the kitchen was still dark. I boiled water, cracked eggs, sliced bread. My hands moved on their own. Stir. Season. Flip. Feed.

I was pouring coffee when I heard them behind me‚Äîbare feet against the hardwood. Her giggle first. Then his laugh.

They slid into the kitchen like a couple on a honeymoon. Elizabeth wore one of Edmund‚Äôs button-downs, half open. Her legs bare. Hair tousled like she‚Äôd just rolled off him, which she probably did. Edmund looked freshly showered, like their night together was some kind of baptism.

‚ÄúCoffee, Doris,‚Äù she said, yawning like a cat in sunlight. ‚ÄúMake his strong, mine half and half. You know how he likes it.‚Äù

I handed them their mugs without a word.

Edmund didn‚Äôt even glance at me. Just sipped. Then said, ‚ÄúBacon and omelet, Doris. Lizzy loves it the way I do. None of that salty mess you used to make. She's watching her figure‚Äînot that it shows, huh?‚Äù

Elizabeth chuckled and leaned against the counter like she owned it. ‚ÄúNot everyone wants to look like a stick wrapped in sadness, sweetie.‚Äù

I smiled. Not out of kindness. Just strategy.

Smile. Just smile. You‚Äôve cooked for enemies before.

I cracked more eggs. Let the oil sizzle. Pretended I didn‚Äôt hear them talking about the night. About the penthouse. About how soft the sheets were. About how Edmund snored less when he was ‚Äúwith her.‚Äù About how my shampoo made him sneeze. They ate like I was the maid. Talked like I wasn‚Äôt real.

Then the front door flung open.

‚ÄúFamily‚Äôs here!‚Äù Lester‚Äôs voice boomed like a sitcom dad. ‚ÄúLet the party begin!‚Äù

Loisa followed behind him, heels clicking against the tiles, holding up a new designer purse like it was the Holy Grail. ‚ÄúMom, look! Elizabeth gave me this! Can you believe it? Real leather! Italian! And these earrings? Gifted. God, she‚Äôs such a giver.‚Äù

She twirled like a child. Like she didn‚Äôt already own closets full of things Lester bought for her. Not that he ever bought me a single scarf.

Behind them, the twins stormed in with that careless energy only teenagers have. Lyle was wearing sunglasses indoors. Nash had something massive covered in brown paper.

Loisa laughed again, too loud. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you hear? Lizzie gave us the whole penthouse. We slept like royals. You should‚Äôve seen the tub. Bigger than our bedroom.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, and the view,‚Äù Lester chimed in, opening a bottle of wine without asking. ‚ÄúFrom the 36th floor? Breathtaking. Sun hits the windows just right. Like a painting. Like‚Äîperfect.‚Äù

It was nine in the morning.

Nash and Lyle dragged their ‚Äòsurprise‚Äô into the living room and tore off the cover. It was a giant, glossy print of the family, taken at the Luciana Hotel gala. Everyone dressed like aristocrats. Posed like nobility. Elizabeth in the middle. My sons beside her. Edmund‚Äôs hand resting on her body.

I wasn‚Äôt in the picture.

‚ÄúLook, Grandma!‚Äù Nash said with a smirk. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt we look like a real family here?‚Äù

Lyle added without blinking, ‚ÄúToo bad you weren‚Äôt there. Oh wait‚Äîyeah. You were left behind. Guess you looked too much like our maid.‚Äù

The room exploded with laughter. Even Edmund. Even my son. Even Loisa, wiping tears from her eyes.

Elizabeth just sipped her coffee and said cheerfully, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, Doris. I‚Äôll leave some of my old dresses in your closet. And some perfume. They‚Äôre a little tight on me now, but I think you can squeeze in.‚Äù

Edmund chuckled, not even looking at me. ‚ÄúYou can dress a corpse in Versace‚Äîit‚Äôs still a corpse. She still smells like disappointment.‚Äù

Loisa practically screamed laughing. Nash and Lyle clapped each other like it was a roast battle.

And me?

I picked up their dirty plates. I washed them one by one. I stared out the window at the neighbor‚Äôs lemon tree, blooming.

They think this is the end. But they haven‚Äôt seen what I look like when I stop begging to belong.



\---



That night, when the laughter died and the wine ran out and the house went still, I crept into the living room. I stood there staring at it again.

The portrait. Massive. Hung dead-center in the sala like a crown jewel.

Lester made a whole production out of placing it there. Right above the console table. Right where no one could miss it. Where guests would pause and admire the happy family and say, ‚ÄúWhat a beautiful household you have.‚Äù

A lie, printed in high gloss.

I didn‚Äôt even hear Edmund come in until he was behind me.

‚ÄúWhat, jealous again?‚Äù His voice always sounded rougher when he was bored. ‚ÄúYou stare at that thing like it‚Äôs gonna cry for you.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer. What was the point?

He scoffed. ‚ÄúCome on, Doris. If I could turn back time‚Ä¶ I swear, I would‚Äôve left you back in the province. Should‚Äôve married Elizabeth from the start. She‚Äôs better than you in every freaking way. Classy. Successful. Knows how to run a business. Knows how to shut up.‚Äù

I turned away, still quiet.

That‚Äôs when he kicked me.

Right in the knee. My leg buckled, and I dropped with a thud I was too tired to even burst at. The floor met me like an old friend. Cold. Familiar.

The tears came without permission. Warm and humiliating. Not because of the pain. No. I think it was because of the sound of him walking away like I wasn‚Äôt even there.

‚ÄúEnough drama,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too old for this thing.‚Äù

Then his phone rang.

I could still hear my breath catching in my chest when he answered it.

The tone of his voice changed instantly. ‚ÄúHey, baby,‚Äù he said, like I wasn‚Äôt even on the floor. ‚ÄúMmm, I missed you already.‚Äù

I wiped my face slowly, one sleeve at a time.

His voice dropped into something warm. Giddy. Teenage. ‚ÄúYeah, yeah, I‚Äôm packing. Can‚Äôt wait to see you in that bikini again. This cruise‚Äôll be insane. You and me. Open sea.‚Äù



Chapter 4

I didn‚Äôt follow Edmund.

He walked away, still giggling with Elizabeth like a boy on prom night, whispering into his phone about bikinis and champagne like I wasn‚Äôt still on the floor with my knees aching and my soul halfway gone.

I stood. My knees creaked. My hand smudged across the tile, picking up dirt and pride. I walked to the bathroom. Closed the door quietly. Stared into the mirror like I didn‚Äôt know the woman staring back‚Äîeyes puffy, cheek red, hair undone. Like someone who tried to cry underwater and failed.

There‚Äôs no funeral. But I‚Äôm mourning.

Not for him. Not for us.

For me.

For the girl I used to be before love took her name and silence stole her voice.

Just then, he passed by. Didn‚Äôt knock. Didn‚Äôt ask if I was alive. Still on the phone, laughing‚Äîthen paused long enough to say, ‚ÄúPack my things. Business-leisure trip. We leave tomorrow.‚Äù

No ‚Äúplease.‚Äù No glance. No soul.

I nodded. Not that he was looking.

I dried my hands on the crooked towel. Walked to his room like a maid. Opened the closet. Chaos‚Äîsuits tangled with polos, shoes under dirty laundry. A grown man living like a spoiled teen.

I started folding his shirts. White linen. Navy power. Cleaned his cufflinks with my sleeve.

Then I bumped the side table.

A folder slipped. I picked it up, expecting tax papers. But inside‚Äîcruise tickets.

I blinked.

I read them twice and my fingers tightening.

Edmund Morocco. Elizabeth Morocco. Lester. Loisa. Lyle. Nash.

My name wasn‚Äôt there.

Not even as a +1. Not even as a footnote.

The cruise? The one I dreamed of...

But now? Elizabeth‚Äôs birthday is in three days and he has time? He remembered hers.

Not mine.

Never mine.

I folded the tickets gently. Like they could bleed.

Then I packed his suitcase. Polished his shoes. Ironed his pants. Lined up his deodorant and vitamins like hotel staff would.

Lester walked in. No knock. ‚ÄúMa, pack my stuff too, yeah? Loisa‚Äôs busy.‚Äù He sipped a beer. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget the twins. Nash wants his charger. Lyle needs the blue swim shorts. Snacks too‚Äîthey get bored.‚Äù

Then he left. And I packed it all.

Tiny shorts. Rolled t-shirts. Loisa‚Äôs perfume wrapped in a sock. Ziplocked snacks labeled with love.

Then I went to my room. Quietly. Closed the door.

I sat there on my bed, hands trembling, and my mind drifted back. Back to when I was just eighteen.

When Edmund wasn‚Äôt a man who kicked me in the knee or forgot my name on a cruise ticket.

Back when he said things that sounded like promises‚Ä¶

\*\*\*

I was fresh out of school, a girl still unsure of her own shadow.

Edmund looked at me, eyes soft and serious, like I was the only thing that made sense.

‚ÄúDoris,‚Äù he said, holding my hand like it was the only thing steady in his wild world, ‚ÄúI swear, I‚Äôll take care of you. Always. No matter what happens, you‚Äôll never have to worry about a thing.‚Äù

I smiled, my heart so full it felt like it might burst.

‚ÄúEven if the whole world turns its back?‚Äù I asked, barely breathing.

He nodded. ‚ÄúEspecially then.‚Äù

Then another flashbacks...

A summer evening under the stars. We lay on the grass, tangled limbs and whispered dreams.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about money, or power, or the legacy,‚Äù Edmund said, voice low and fierce. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the only future I want. You and me, we‚Äôll build something real. Something no one can take.‚Äù

I laughed, feeling invincible.

‚ÄúYou make me believe in forever.‚Äù

He kissed me like he meant it. Like forever was ours already.



But then came my father.

The man with a crown no one dared challenge.

When I told him I loved Edmund ‚Äî his blood wasn‚Äôt the right kind, his family not the right name ‚Äî my father‚Äôs face twisted with something colder than winter.

‚ÄúDoris,‚Äù he said, voice like steel, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre dead to me. You don‚Äôt get to drag our name into this dirt.‚Äù

I stood my ground, tears burning but voice steady.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not your possession.‚Äù

He laughed, cruel and hollow. ""You are my daughter, yes. But you‚Äôre no Rossini anymore,‚Äù he spat. ‚ÄúMarry that boy if you want, but don‚Äôt expect me to recognize you. You are dead to me. If you come back, I‚Äôll kill you myself. And you know I don‚Äôt bluff.‚Äù

I swallowed hard. ‚ÄúI love Edmund.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou love a shadow. You‚Äôll die in that darkness.‚Äù

\---

And now‚Äîthirty years later‚ÄîEdmund‚Äôs true colors bled through all those pretty words. That boy who promised to care for me, who whispered forever, was gone.

Replaced by a man who could kick me down and never look back. A man who packs his bags for a cruise with another woman and leaves me packing silence.

And I sit here, wondering how a love so loud became a ghost I can‚Äôt outrun.

I smiled bitterly and reached for the landline no one uses anymore. Dialed a number I hadn‚Äôt called in thirty years.

It rang.

Once. Twice. Three times.

Then‚Äî

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

It was him.

My father. Older. Tired. But still him. Still warm in that quiet, exhausted way.

I couldn‚Äôt speak. Held the receiver like it was keeping me upright. Tears slipped down, soft and unstoppable.

‚Äú‚Ä¶F-father,‚Äù I whispered. My voice cracked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs me. Doris.‚Äù



Chapter 5

The line was still warm in my hand when I heard my father‚Äôs voice. Calm. Tired. Like the kind of tired that‚Äôs lived a thousand lonely nights waiting.

‚ÄúCome home, Doris,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been waiting for you for twenty years.‚Äù

Twenty years. Twenty years of waiting. And me, too afraid or too proud or maybe just too broken to pick up the phone.

My knees almost gave out, but I caught myself. Instead, I sank to the edge of the bed and let the tears fall.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming home,‚Äù I whispered, voice barely a ghost.

He didn‚Äôt say anything more. Just the sound of his breath, steady and real, a lifeline. I hung up before I could say goodbye.

That‚Äôs when Edmund walked in. Like a shadow slipping through the cracked door. His eyes were cold ‚Äî calculating ‚Äî like he could smell the truth on me and hated it.

He didn‚Äôt even bother to pretend.

‚ÄúI know you saw the tickets,‚Äù he said. Smirk like he was telling a joke. ‚ÄúLimited to six, Doris. Me. Elizabeth. Lester. Loisa. The twins. That‚Äôs it.‚Äù

I swallowed the lump in my throat.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre deliberately excluded.‚Äù

His voice dropped to a dead calm. Like ice melting on concrete.

‚ÄúWhen I get back, I‚Äôll buy you a diamond set. Take you to Hawaii.‚Äù

Like those words were supposed to be a consolation prize. Then he turned, walked out without another glance. Just like I was air.

I stood there a moment, silent. Staring at the door he just closed behind him like a coffin.

The next morning, I moved through the motions in the kitchen. Omelets, bacon, toast ‚Äî the smell sharp and mocking.

From the living room, I heard the twins. Laughing, shouting like it was Christmas morning.

‚ÄúThis cruise is the biggest ever!‚Äù Lester yelled. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have so much fun!‚Äù

Their voices were bright, innocent. And cruel.

Then Elizabeth showed up, arms loaded with takeout bags.

She dropped them on the counter with a loud thud and sneered, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like Doris‚Äôs cooking,‚Äù she announced, loud enough for everyone to hear. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like chewing on cardboard or swallowing salt straight from the shaker. Bland, over-salted, and completely uninspired‚Äîjust like her.‚Äù

The room went still for a moment, and then she tossed her head, eyes gleaming.

‚ÄúYou know, family dinners used to mean something. Now? It‚Äôs just a reminder of how pathetic some people are. Doris tries, bless her heart, but you can‚Äôt polish a stone that‚Äôs already cracked all the way through.‚Äù

The twins giggled, but Lester wasn‚Äôt done.

‚ÄúYeah, Mum, I mean, why even bother pretending you care? You make food like you don‚Äôt want us here. Like you‚Äôre waiting for us to leave just to be alone with your failures.‚Äù

Loisa nodded, picking up the thread with a sharp grin.

‚ÄúHonestly, it‚Äôs kind of sad, mum. You cook like you‚Äôre punishing us. Like every burnt edge and dry bite is your little protest. But we‚Äôre not fooled. We see right through you.‚Äù

Elizabeth snatched a bag from the counter, opening it with exaggerated care.

‚ÄúSo family, eat this. Real food. Food that people who actually matter deserve. We leave in an hour.‚Äù

Their eyes flicked over me like I was some ugly secret they all shared but refused to admit out loud.

I watched as they dug in like they were starving, piling their plates, asking for more drinks, more snacks.

‚ÄúGet me water.‚Äù

‚ÄúPass the salt.‚Äù

‚ÄúMore napkins.‚Äù

Invisible, I faded into the background, biting down the bitterness that wanted to choke me.

Just before they left, Edmund‚Äôs voice cut through the kitchen like a whip.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs my wallet?‚Äù

He spun around, eyes sharp, accusing me without a word.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre hiding it, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù His eyes burned. ‚ÄúBecause that‚Äôs what you do‚Äîhide things. Hide from responsibility, hide from respect, hide like the useless, jealous little nobody you are.‚Äù

I shook my head quietly.

He didn‚Äôt wait. His hand slapped my face. Hard.

The world spun. Blood poured from my nose like a cruel joke.

I collapsed.

The floor was cold and steady beneath me as my vision blurred. Then Elizabeth inhaled sharply, her voice dripping with fake innocence.

‚ÄúOh! Sorry, brother-in-law,‚Äù she said, voice syrupy sweet. ‚ÄúI must have taken your wallet by mistake while digging through my earrings. You know how clumsy I am.‚Äù

She pulled it from her bag with a smirk only I noticed. I knew. It was a setup. A way to make me small. To humiliate me in front of everyone.

The family gathered their bags like it was a holiday, smiling and shouting their goodbyes.

Lester, pretending to be kind: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, Mum. I‚Äôll bring you a fridge magnet.‚Äù

Loisa added, ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll bring you a keychain.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll bring you dirty laundry, Grandma.‚Äù The twins laughed and even made silly faces.

Their words hit like knives, soft but sharp.

The door slammed shut behind them.

Silence.

I didn‚Äôt wait. Didn‚Äôt cry. I walked straight to the bedroom, dropped to my knees, and dragged my old bag out from under the bed. I grabbed it. Zipped it. Left everything else behind.

I took a cab and went straight to the airport.

Then my phone buzzed.

Edmund.

\> Guard the house while we‚Äôre gone. We‚Äôll be out for a week. Don‚Äôt mess anything up.

Another message followed instantly.

\> Sorry I slapped you. But you provoked me. If only you weren‚Äôt always so jealous. You ruin things for yourself.

I stared at the words, the gall of it. A man who‚Äôd used his hands to silence me now using words to rewrite history. Still blaming me for his cruelty.

I smiled ‚Äî not out of joy, but clarity.

Then I blocked his number.

Deleted the thread. Gone.

I slipped the phone into my coat pocket, stepped onto the plane, and didn‚Äôt look back once.

I was done guarding a house that had never been a home. I was going back to the only place that ever was.

Home.

1l2zocl,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1l2zocl/gate_17/,Gate 17.,"They say boredom is the worst part of working Gate 17, but I‚Äôd take boredom over what happened last cycle. Any day.

Gate 17 is a minor crossing out near the Saturn relay. Not flashy like Marsport‚Äôs Nexus or the bustling dock at Proxima. It‚Äôs mostly used by freighter pilots, smugglers with small ambitions, and the occasional wayward explorer. Which is why they stick humans like me out here. Low threat, low maintenance. Push buttons, scan forms, don‚Äôt offend the Ulgari.

My name‚Äôs Dax Mercer. Earth-born. I took this gig because I couldn‚Äôt afford to stay on Earth after my second divorce. One thing leads to another, and now I‚Äôm the only organic Customs Agent in a 500-mile radius of a black-hole bypass.

Most of my job is stamping travel permits and making sure no one‚Äôs trying to smuggle in sentient mold or ancient psychic weapons disguised as perfume. Easy stuff. But last week‚Ä¶ yeah, last week was different.

It started with a ship that didn‚Äôt transmit a standard I.D. tag. That‚Äôs supposed to be impossible. Every vessel that registers with the Intergalactic Trade Authority has a transponder hardwired into its core.

This one didn‚Äôt.

I tapped the comm. ‚ÄúUnidentified vessel, this is Gate 17. Transmit your identification or prepare to be boarded.‚Äù

No reply. Just static.

I sipped my cold synth-coffee and narrowed my eyes at the screen. The ship was black‚Äîlike obsidian melted and shaped into something sharp. It looked grown, not built. Organic. And it wasn‚Äôt decelerating.

I hit the red button. That‚Äôs the big one. It notifies Central and sends out an automatic lockdown pulse that freezes anything within a two-mile radius. But the ship kept coming.

Then it stopped. Just‚Ä¶ stopped. No inertia compensation, no thruster adjustment. It was suddenly just hovering a hundred meters from my port. Quiet. Motionless.

I stood up, which I hadn‚Äôt done in four hours. ‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Ä¶‚Äù

That‚Äôs when the lights dimmed, and every monitor on the station went blank. My backup generator kicked in a moment later, but the cameras were still dark. That‚Äôs never supposed to happen.

I heard a click. The manual airlock. Someone was coming in.

Now understand this: no one uses the manual airlock. That thing hasn‚Äôt been used since the Treaty of Vrylos when some Vortan diplomat got sucked out into space because the AI forgot to account for his third lung.

I grabbed my sidearm. Regulation issue. Barely enough power to fry a small lizard, but it made me feel better.

The inner door hissed open.

A figure stepped through, tall and wrapped in dark red robes that shimmered like oil. No visible face. No breathing apparatus. Just‚Ä¶ silence.

‚ÄúState your name and reason for entry,‚Äù I said, trying to sound official and not terrified.

It tilted its head.

‚ÄúDo you speak Galactic Basic?‚Äù I tried again.

Nothing.

Then a voice‚Äînot from its mouth, but inside my head. Clear. Cold. Female.
‚ÄúI seek the one who remembers.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúRemembers what?‚Äù

‚ÄúBefore the war. Before the gates.‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you mean. There‚Äôs no war. Hasn‚Äôt been for a century.‚Äù

It took another step. The lights flickered again. My sidearm beeped‚Äîbattery drained. I dropped it instinctively.

‚ÄúYou remember,‚Äù she whispered inside me. ‚ÄúYou were there. Or your kind was.‚Äù

‚ÄúLady,‚Äù I said, stepping back, ‚ÄúI was born in 2132. The only war I remember was the Great Memefight of ‚Äô98, and that was online.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt laugh. She raised her hand, and suddenly my mind was elsewhere.

I saw Earth. Burned. I saw skies filled with black ships that blotted out the sun. I saw humans with silver eyes and plasma-veined skin waging war across a galaxy that screamed in pain.

Then silence.

I dropped to my knees. My nose was bleeding.

She stood over me. ‚ÄúWe sealed you away. Thought it better to forget. But some of you‚Ä¶ fragments‚Ä¶ slipped through.‚Äù

I gasped, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a clerk.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are a gate.‚Äù

She turned and walked back toward the airlock.

I managed to stumble up. ‚ÄúWait! What happens now?‚Äù

She paused.

‚ÄúThey will come, now that one of us has crossed.‚Äù

The outer door hissed open. A second later, she was gone.

The systems rebooted. Monitors flashed on. The ship? Gone. As if it had never been there.

Central pinged me five minutes later, asking why I activated the lockdown and caused a three-hour trade delay. I filed a glitch report and requested medical leave.

That was five days ago.

Since then, I‚Äôve seen more ships without tags. Strange ones. Ones I can‚Äôt explain. And every night, I dream of wars I‚Äôve never lived through. Names I don‚Äôt recognize. Weapons I shouldn‚Äôt know.

Something is waking up out there. And apparently, I‚Äôm not just a guy working Gate 17 anymore.

I‚Äôm the key.
And I don‚Äôt think the gate‚Äôs gonna hold much longer.

Here how it went.","I tried a furious explosive handmade, railroad rifle, cold shoulder, EPR flamer, and an Elders Mark. Well the cold shoulder wasn't furious of course, but the rest were.

I had hoped the Cold Shoulder would do pretty well since it had more range now, but it was useless on my first try. 

To use the EPR, I had to stand on the platform like the autoaxe method, but it couldn't do it in one setting. So I had to jump off before it died. Took too long on shield and torso.

RR wasnt worth it, I bailed after a few seconds. What did they do to it?

The handmade was too slow, but it might've been the mods I had on it (furious, explosive, endurance). It might've done better with limb damage. And a 4th star. I'll try it again later.

The Elders Mark was the only one I killed it with, but had to hide twice. It melted the shield, but was relatively slow on the torso. (furious, crippling, Swift, pin pointers). I'll try it again with a different 3rd star. I ran out of coffee though, which might explain things.

All of them probably would've been fine on a full team. But I'll do more testing later to see if they can solo it in one go. 

I had all the new perception perks that replaced rifleman and commando. 

And all the Agility perks for onslaught buildup, as well as the new enforcer that works with all small guns now, and true new modern renegade for limb damage.

And under strength, Easy Target, and the new scattershot. 

Also, my troubleshooters Vulcan pa was specced for more carry weight. So maybe I'll add some stars to help ap, which will let me stay in vats longer. My overeaters set no longer seemed strong enough to protect me in that stage. Did they up it's damage? I'll add limit breaking and endurance and see how that helps.

I just want to take a moment to say how genuinely blown away and grateful I am for what‚Äôs happening here. Hitting **300 members in just 22 days**, with over **32,000 visits** to the community and posts now regularly getting 2,000 to 5,000 views‚Äîit‚Äôs hard to put into words how much that means to me. I‚Äôm genuinely humbled by the engagement, the energy, the questions, and the support.

On that note, I want to share some thoughts.

---

## Why Biotech? Why I‚Äôm Drawn to This Sector

There‚Äôs a reason I‚Äôm so drawn to biotech. For me, the sector is uniquely compelling because of its **binary, catalyst-driven nature**. You get these highly defined moments‚Äîtrial results, FDA decisions, commercial launches‚Äîwhere everything can change in a day. I love that clarity.

What really hooks me, though, is the whole concept of **de-risking**. Companies in this space are constantly moving along the risk spectrum: early-stage, high-risk development gives way to pivotal data, which‚Äîif positive‚Äîcan suddenly wipe away layers of uncertainty. 

In my view that same logic applies to investing. If you understand the science, the milestones, the mechanics, you can actually *mitigate* risk, not just take a punt and hope for the best.

To me, that‚Äôs the real battleground for information asymmetry. The institutions have structure, models, and teams, and they use all of that to tilt the odds in their favour. But what most people miss is that you can actually find **opportunity asymmetry**‚Äîthose moments when the risk/reward is truly one-sided‚Äîif you dig deep enough and bring the right tools. Most average punters will never beat the institutions on luck alone. But in biotech, if you‚Äôre forensic, creative, and relentless, you can tilt the odds back the other way.

---

## Why I Started This (and Why It‚Äôs Different)

If you‚Äôd asked me last year if I‚Äôd be running a Reddit community that‚Äôs become one of the fastest-growing finance subs out there, I would have laughed. But this all really started because I‚Äôve always been obsessed with the idea that *retail can close the information gap*‚Äîthat we can, with the right process and intent, actually get ahead of the institutions.

Last year, I stepped back into the markets with a new mindset. I built out a structured screening approach‚Äîsomething a bit different from what I‚Äôd done before, which was mostly technical analysis. This time, I wanted to be truly forensic, genuinely objective, and, above all, focused on *de-risking* investment decisions.

I started by mapping out a set of criteria‚Äîsometimes a bit over the top, but always rooted in facts, not hype. I tested and re-tested in practical ways, an by leveraging emerging technology in innovative and creative ways. The core was about finding asymmetric opportunities: the ones where the risk/reward profile is skewed, where you can *win big without risking everything*. 

And here‚Äôs where things shifted for me: I decided to fully embrace **AI and automation** as part of the process. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôm passionate about and, if I‚Äôm honest, pretty good at. I use innovative AI-driven workflows to help screen, filter, and process the mountains of information out there. Not some kind of sci-fi setup‚Äîjust practical, pragmatic ways to make sense of chaos. The AI isn‚Äôt picking stocks for me; it‚Äôs helping me find what matters faster and more reliably, and that‚Äôs become a real edge.

---

## On Beating Information Asymmetry

One thing I‚Äôve realised, and it‚Äôs something that sits at the heart of what we‚Äôre building here, is this: **the information we need to make good decisions actually is out there**. Maybe 20% of what‚Äôs available gets you 80% of the edge, but the magic is in *how* you find it, how you process it, and how you convert it into something actionable.

For me, that‚Äôs meant:
- Obsessively reading everything: news, filings, patents, clinical data, market research, leadership histories, institutional trades‚Äîanything that might give me an angle (and knowing where to find that information - often nested in the deep web).
- Building a framework for screening, pressure-testing, and re-testing every idea‚Äînever just taking things at face value.
- Using technology‚ÄîAI workflows, automation‚Äîto remove grunt work and let me focus on actually thinking, not just collecting.
- Constantly updating, questioning, and evolving my approach as I learn more (and as the market changes).

I don‚Äôt take advice from anyone. I make up my own mind, I build my own processes, and I learn by doing‚Äîsometimes by getting it wrong, but always by iterating.

---

## Why aTyr (and Why This Community)

After running my new screening framework across the market, aTyr stood out. Not just by a little, but by a *mile*. There were maybe a couple of others, but the combination of clinical catalysts, institutional build-up, platform science, and overlooked detail made it obvious to me that something was brewing.

But here‚Äôs the thing: what‚Äôs most exciting is not just the stock‚Äîit‚Äôs the *opportunity* for us as a community to collectively close the information gap, to beat the institutions by being more nimble, more curious, and more collaborative. The institutions thrive on information asymmetry, but retail is catching up‚Äîespecially if we‚Äôre obsessive enough and willing to work together.

---

## How This Community Grew

At first, I didn‚Äôt even think about starting a community. I was posting research on Stocktwits, Reddit, responding to other people‚Äôs threads, just trying to add value where I could. Then, a few people suggested I start my own Reddit, and I figured, ‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù I wanted a place to share deep-dive research, model scenarios, and, most importantly, crowdsource better questions and answers.

What‚Äôs happened since has genuinely surprised me. The velocity is nuts‚Äîthree to five thousand views per post, 32,000 site visits, and actual engagement and debate that pushes me to do more. There‚Äôs even a bit of virality; people are sharing, coming back, and building on the analysis.

I love that. I want this to be a place where anyone can ask for a new angle, challenge my thinking, share what they‚Äôre seeing, and generally push us to do better work.

---

## Who I Am

Just for context‚ÄîI‚Äôm based down under in Sydney, Australia (which means a lot of late nights and early mornings to keep up with the US market). My background is in maths, analytics, commercial problem-solving, business advisory; I‚Äôve been around the block in quite a few sectors. I‚Äôm intense, a bit obsessive, and I never stop trying to figure out new ways to get an edge.

I do this because I *enjoy* it, but I also do it because I believe retail can win‚Äîif we‚Äôre smart about how we approach things, if we collaborate, and if we refuse to let institutions tell us what‚Äôs possible.

---

## What‚Äôs Next, and How You Can Shape It

I want to keep growing this. I want to do this process‚Äîscreening, deep dives, creative research‚Äîfor other stocks as well. I‚Äôd love to bring people into the screening process when the time is right, to show how we can collectively de-risk and beat the market together (purely educational, of course‚Äînot advice).

But I also want to hear from *you*:
- What would you like to see next?
- What kind of research, analysis, or resources would be valuable?
- Is there a direction you want me to explore with aTyr? Or a different approach, a new tool, or another sector?

Let me know in the comments. The more feedback, challenge, and new perspectives, the better this community becomes.

But in the back of my mind ‚Äî in the parts of me I don‚Äôt show anyone ‚Äî I‚Äôm always somewhere else.

There‚Äôs this person. Someone I knew in high school. We had a strange, electric connection even then, but nothing ever came of it. We orbited. We‚Äôd talk every few years, a little too intensely, then drift. I thought it was nostalgia. Until last year when we reconnected again.

We only saw each other once. Not even a kiss. Just coffee. But it wrecked me. It felt like someone cracked open a version of me I‚Äôd buried ‚Äî and for the first time in years, I felt fully awake. Fully alive.

And then he ghosted. Slowly at first. Less frequent replies. Then nothing. No blocking. No confrontation. Just silence. That was 6 months ago.

Since then, I‚Äôve spiraled more than I care to admit. I‚Äôve tried to stop. I‚Äôve deleted his contact, muted his profile, told myself I was insane. But still:
	‚Ä¢	I check to see if he‚Äôs watched my stories.
	‚Ä¢	I try to decode the one time he liked a photo months after it was posted.
	‚Ä¢	I imagine bumping into him at a grocery store like it‚Äôs a scene from a show I‚Äôve already seen a thousand times.

Every night, I fall asleep playing the same loop: our first kiss (which hasn‚Äôt happened). What I‚Äôd say if we met again. What he‚Äôd say if he ever messaged. I write full conversations in my head. I know how unhinged this sounds.

But here‚Äôs the scariest part:
I don‚Äôt know what else to be excited about.
I don‚Äôt know how to shut off that part of me that believes we were supposed to mean something.
I don‚Äôt know who I am if I‚Äôm not waiting for him to come back.

I‚Äôve been this way ‚Äî some version of this ‚Äî since I was 13. I used to think it was romantic. Now it just feels like grief in a loop. Grieving something I never even had.

Morning:
Wake up and bathe: Schopenhauer would wake up around 7 am and take a cold sponge bath. 
Coffee and writing: He would make himself coffee and write for a few hours, often until noon. 
Flute practice: After writing, he would practice the flute for half an hour. 

Afternoon:
Lunch: He would eat lunch at a fashionable inn, like the Englischer Hof.
Rest and reading: After lunch, he would rest and read.
Evening walk: He would take a two-hour walk, regardless of the weather. 

Evening:
Reading The Times: He would visit a library to read The Times newspaper.
Cultural events: He would attend concerts, the theater, or other cultural events.
Dinner: He would have dinner at a hotel or restaurant.
Early bed: He would return home and go to bed early, typically between 9 and 10 pm. 

Other notable aspects:
Solitude: Schopenhauer lived alone and preferred the company of his poodles. 
Detachment from material possessions: He was known for his simple lifestyle and detachment from material desires. 
Regularity: He adhered to this routine almost religiously, deviating only occasionally to receive visitors.

Chapter 1  
  
""Fifty million. Leave the country within a week. Stay away from my son forever.""  
  
Mrs. Hartwell sat across from Luna Davies, her perfectly maintained face radiating undisguised contempt.  
  
If this had been before, Luna would've fought back with tears in her eyes, protesting, ""I'm not with him for the money.""  
  
But now, she simply nodded calmly. ""Okay.""  
  
Mrs. Hartwell was visibly stunned, then let out a cold laugh. ""At least you know your PLACE.""  
  
She emphasized those last words like a dagger, highlighting the massive gap between Luna's world and her son Cade Hartwell's privileged existence.  
  
Luna kept her eyes down, took the check, and walked away without another word.  
  
By the time she got back to the mansion, darkness had already fallen.  
  
This place was ridiculously huge ‚Äì so massive she still got lost sometimes.  
  
The only familiar thing was that framed photo on the coffee table. In it, Cade had his arm around her waist, looking down at her with eyes so tender they could melt winter snow.  
  
She traced the photo gently with her finger, suddenly remembering that rainy night three years ago.  
  
That year, she'd found Cade collapsed in an alley, covered in blood, his eyes unfocused and lost.  
  
""Who are you?"" she'd asked him.  
  
""I... I don't remember,"" he'd mumbled, shaking his head as rain and blood dripped from his hair.  
  
Just like that, she'd brought this memory-lost stranger home.  
  
Her tiny 300-square-foot studio apartment, barely big enough for two people.  
  
Peeling wallpaper, leaky pipes, needing three blankets just to stay warm in winter.  
  
But in that cramped, broke-ass place, the purest kind of love had somehow bloomed.  
  
They clung to each other for survival, and from that day on, they were each other's entire universe.  
  
He'd wait outside her building for three hours just to walk her home after late shifts.  
  
He'd stay up all night rubbing her stomach when her period cramps hit like a freight train.  
  
He'd secretly work five different jobs just to buy her that expensive necklace she'd looked at three times but never bought for herself.  
  
The only thing that wore her out was how he wanted her every single night.  
  
When she'd blush and beg for mercy, he'd nibble her ear and whisper, ""Baby, I love you too much to stop.""  
  
During their most passionate year, he'd even dragged her to a tattoo parlor to get her name inked on his collarbone.  
  
When the tattoo artist asked if he was worried about the pain, he'd just smiled at her and said, ""Pain's good ‚Äì that way I'll never forget the person I love most.""  
  
She thought they'd be happy like that forever.  
  
Until his memory came back.  
  
That's when she discovered he wasn't some homeless guy at all, but the heir to the Hartwell fortune ‚Äì a financial empire prince who controlled half the investment world. He'd only ended up on the streets because rivals had orchestrated his car accident and caused a memory loss.  
  
After reclaiming his identity, Cade moved Luna into a 20,000-square-foot mansion where even the bathrooms were ten times bigger than her old place.  
  
But from then on, he'd become a completely different person.  
  
Now he wore designer suits she couldn't even pronounce, watches worth more than most people's houses, closed billion-dollar deals, and barely came home anymore.  
  
She kept lying to herself that he was just busy.  
  
Until that day when entertainment headlines exploded with photos of him and Isabelle Sterling, the Sterling family heiress.  
  
In the pictures, he was opening her car door in his tailored suit, both of them sharing a smile that felt like a knife to Luna's chest.  
  
The comments were all about how ""perfect they looked together"" and ""what a power couple.""  
  
That night, she sat by the window staring at the moon until dawn, finally accepting the brutal truth.  
  
The Cade who'd brave snowstorms to pick her up from work, who'd haul bricks to buy her jewelry, who'd tattooed her name on his body ‚Äì that man had died the day his memory returned.  
  
This Hartwell heir and her? They weren't just from different worlds ‚Äì they were from different universes.  
  
He was soaring in the clouds while she was drowning in mud.  
  
Like the moon never touching dust, someone like him was destined for someone equally brilliant.  
  
So, why keep humiliating herself?  
  
Better to let go.  
  
Free him, and free herself too.  
  
That night, the mansion felt as empty as always ‚Äì Cade still didn't come home.  
  
Instead of waiting up until 3 AM like usual, Luna went to bed early. First thing in the morning, she headed to the visa office.  
  
She paid for expedited processing ‚Äì passport and visa would be ready within the week.  
  
When she left the office around noon, Luna ducked into a random restaurant.  
  
The moment she pushed through the door, she froze.  
  
At a window table, Cade was gently wiping the corner of Isabelle's mouth with a napkin.  
  
That look in his eyes ‚Äì tender enough to melt arctic ice ‚Äì was identical to how he used to kiss her in their tiny apartment.  
  
Luna stood there feeling like an invisible hand was crushing her heart.  
  
She turned to leave but accidentally knocked over a plant by the entrance.  
  
Cade looked up at the noise, saw Luna, and all warmth instantly drained from his eyes.  
  
He walked over slowly, his voice low and cutting. ""Are you stalking me now?""  
  
Before she could answer, he continued coldly, ""I already explained those gossip photos ‚Äì it's just business. How long are you gonna keep acting crazy?""  
  
Luna opened her mouth to explain, but her throat felt stuffed with cotton.  
  
Mrs. Hartwell's words from yesterday echoed in her head: ""Cade and Isabelle's engagement has been arranged by both families for years. He's genuinely fond of her too...""  
  
Business. The kind that involved arranged marriages, apparently.  
  
""Cade, don't be so harsh."" Isabelle glided over with a smile, playing peacemaker. ""Running into each other is fate, right? Why don't you join us, Luna?""  
  
Before Luna could refuse, Isabelle was already pulling her to their table.  
  
Luna felt like a puppet being positioned in the chair directly across from Cade's ice-cold expression.  
  
""What would you like, Luna?"" Isabelle pushed the menu toward her. ""Their French cuisine here is absolutely authentic.""  
  
Luna stared at the menu full of French she couldn't read, embarrassment flooding through her.  
  
""I'm not hungry,"" she said, pushing it back.  
  
""At least have some soup."" Isabelle ladled a bowl of seafood bisque and placed it in front of her. ""It's incredibly fresh.""  
  
Luna stared at the shrimp floating in the soup, her stomach cramping.  
  
She was severely allergic to shellfish.  
  
Just as she was about to politely decline, Cade's phone rang.  
  
He stepped away to take the call, his silhouette sharp and imposing.  
  
She'd seen that suit in magazines ‚Äì it cost more than her entire old neighborhood.  
  
""Go ahead, try it,"" Isabelle suddenly lowered her voice. ""Given your... background, you probably don't get to taste such expensive food very often.""  
  
Luna's head snapped up, meeting Isabelle's smiling eyes.  
  
""You don't actually think that little fling with Cade means you can marry into our world, do you?"" Her manicured finger tapped the rim of her glass. ""If he hadn't lost his memory, someone from your class wouldn't even qualify to clean his shoes.""  
  
Luna clenched the napkin in her lap, the fabric bunching in her fist.  
  
She might be poor, but she didn't have to take this kind of disrespect. ""Miss Sterling, we barely know each other. You have no right to‚Äî""  
  
""Oh my God!""  
  
Mid-sentence, Isabelle suddenly shrieked and knocked over the seafood soup. Scalding liquid splashed across her hand and all over Luna's arms.  
  
Cade rushed back at the sound, immediately grabbing Isabelle's hand. ""What happened?""  
  
""It's nothing..."" Isabelle's eyes were brimming with tears. ""I know Luna's upset about seeing us together. As your girlfriend, I guess her jealousy is... understandable...""  
  
Cade immediately turned to Luna, his expression thunderous. ""Seriously? I've explained this a thousand times. You're really gonna pull this shit?""  
  
""I didn't do anything. She knocked it over herself‚Äî""  
  
""Enough!"" He cut her off. ""I saw what happened with my own eyes. When did you become so fucking unreasonable?""  
  
With that, Cade swept Isabelle into his arms and stormed out without a backward glance.  
  
As Isabelle nestled against his shoulder, she slowly turned back to flash Luna a triumphant smile.  
  
Luna stood there alone, trembling as she held up her scalded hand.  
  
Blisters were already forming, the pain like thousands of needles piercing her skin.  
  
But all Cade had seen was the tiny patch of pink on Isabelle's hand.  
  
He'd left so quickly, so decisively, without sparing her even a glance.  
  
But clearly, her Cade used to cherish her above everything else.  
  
Three years ago when she'd burned herself cooking, his eyes had gone red with panic. He'd run to the pharmacy in the middle of the night, coming back to gently apply medicine while asking, ""Does it hurt, baby? Does it hurt?""  
  
Back then, his eyes held only her.  
  
But now, Cade couldn't see her at all.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Luna went home alone.  
  
Back at the mansion, she dug through the first aid kit in the living room, disinfecting, medicating, and bandaging her burns by herself.  
  
The wounds throbbed with tiny, sharp pains, like thousands of ants gnawing at her skin.  
  
As she turned to head upstairs, she caught sight of the grand piano sitting in the corner of the living room.  
  
Cade had bought it after recovering his memory, claiming he wanted to teach her how to play.  
  
But all this time later, a thick layer of dust had settled on the lid.  
  
Just like their relationship ‚Äì buried under neglect.  
  
Her eyes welled up as she hurried to her room to pack.  
  
Clothes, documents, bank cards... she sorted through everything slowly, each movement feeling like a goodbye to her former self.  
  
Halfway through packing, the bedroom door suddenly swung open.  
  
Cade stood in the doorway, suit jacket draped over his arm, tie loosened.  
  
Seeing her open suitcase, he frowned. ""What the hell are you doing?""  
  
""Packing,"" Luna replied calmly, continuing to fold clothes without looking up.  
  
Cade stepped closer, carrying the faint scent of perfume ‚Äì the same fragrance Isabelle had worn today.  
  
He grabbed her wrist hard enough to make her wince.  
  
""So because I had lunch with Isabelle today, you're gonna throw a tantrum and run away? You hurt her, and she didn't even make a big deal about it, but here you are throwing a fit?""  
  
Luna looked up at him, seeing the clear irritation in his eyes.  
  
""Isabelle's family and mine go way back. She just got back to the country, and her parents want me to look out for her. Can't you just be reasonable for once?""  
  
Reasonable?  
  
The word stabbed into her heart like a blade. Luna gripped the shirt in her hands tighter, the fabric bunching in her fist.  
  
She was already being reasonable by preparing to leave. What more did he want?  
  
""Say something!"" Cade suddenly raised his voice.  
  
Luna turned away silently and continued packing.  
  
Her silence completely set him off.  
  
""Fine. Let's see how long you can keep this up.""  
  
He stormed out, slamming the door so hard it made her chest tremble.  
  
The next morning, when Luna came downstairs, she found Isabelle sitting in the living room, chatting and laughing with Cade.  
  
Today she wore a white dress, her makeup flawless, looking both pure and elegant.  
  
Seeing Luna, she immediately stood up with a sweet, innocent smile. ""Luna! You're awake! My parents are insisting Cade take me to today's auction. Please don't read anything into it, okay?""  
  
Luna glanced at Cade, who was adjusting his cufflinks without sparing her even a glance.  
  
""I'm not reading into anything,"" she said quietly. ""Whatever you two do is none of my business.""  
  
Cade's hands paused, his frown deepening.  
  
Just as he was about to speak, Isabelle jumped in. ""Why don't you come with us, Luna? It's not like you have anything else going on.""  
  
Before Luna could refuse, Isabelle was already linking their arms.  
  
And just like that, she found herself dragged into the car.  
  
The auction house glittered with lights and swarmed with elite guests.  
  
Cade sat in the front row, his long fingers casually raising his paddle as one piece of jewelry and luxury watch after another fell to his bids, which he then handed over to Isabelle beside him.  
  
Isabelle smiled gracefully, occasionally leaning close to whisper in his ear, their intimacy painfully obvious.  
  
""Cade, shouldn't you buy something for Luna too?"" she suggested with fake thoughtfulness.  
  
Cade's tone was flat. ""No need. She's not used to these kinds of things.""  
  
At his words, Isabelle's lips curved slightly upward, and from an angle Cade couldn't see, she shot Luna a victor's smile.  
  
Luna lowered her eyes, her fingertips lightly tracing the auction catalog, her heart turning to ice.  
  
Not used to them, or not worthy of them?  
  
In his eyes, she'd probably always be that Cinderella who crawled out of the slums. Even standing beside him now, she'd never deserve these luxuries in her bones.  
  
But it didn't matter. Soon enough, there wouldn't be anything between them anyway.  
  
Luna sat quietly in the corner, watching Cade spend thousands on Isabelle, watching their shameless intimacy, as if she were just an irrelevant observer.  
  
Until the final item was brought out‚Äî  
  
A jade bracelet.  
  
Her breath caught, her fingers unconsciously clenching.  
  
That was her grandmother's heirloom!  
  
Three years ago, Cade had taken construction jobs to buy her a birthday present, eventually falling from scaffolding and nearly dying.  
  
To pay for his surgery, she'd been forced to sell the only thing her grandmother had left her ‚Äì that bracelet.  
  
Later, when she'd finally saved enough money to buy it back, it had already been sold to someone else.  
  
She'd searched every antique shop in the city but never saw it again.  
  
And now, here it was, appearing before her without warning.  
  
Luna's heart leaped, and she almost instinctively raised her paddle.  
  
""One million.""  
  
Isabelle looked back at her in surprise, then smiled lightly and raised her own paddle. ""Three million.""  
  
""Four million!""  
  
""Five million!""  
  
...  
  
After several rounds of bidding between them, Cade frowned, his gaze sweeping between Luna and Isabelle.  
  
Finally, he raised his hand slightly, signaling the sky's-the-limit bid.  
  
The highest price of the entire evening.  
  
The auctioneer's gavel fell. ""Congratulations, Mr. Hartwell!""  
  
As the room erupted, he turned to Isabelle. ""Since you like it so much, it's yours.""  
  
Hearing that, Luna's bidding paddle clattered to the floor.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
She stared in shock as the staff member respectfully handed the bracelet to Isabelle, who smiled and reached out to take it. Just as her fingertips touched the edge of the box, she suddenly gasped‚Äî  
  
""Oops!""  
  
Crack!  
  
The jade bracelet slipped from the box and crashed hard onto the marble floor, breaking into two pieces.  
  
In that instant, Luna's breathing nearly stopped, her ears filled only with the sharp sound of shattering.  
  
Her mind went blank as she instinctively rushed forward, pushing Isabelle aside and trembling as she reached for the broken pieces on the floor.  
  
Cade's face turned ice-cold as he steadied the stumbling Isabelle. When he looked at Luna again, his voice was low and harsh. ""Luna, what the fuck is wrong with you?""  
  
Luna looked up with red-rimmed eyes, her voice shaking. ""What's wrong with me? This was my grandmother's heirloom! Didn't you promise me once that if we ever saw it again, you'd buy it back for me?""  
  
""But now you don't even remember, do you?""  
  
Cade froze for a moment, as if recalling something, but quickly his expression turned cold again.  
  
""That was ages ago ‚Äì how the hell would I still remember?"" His tone was icy, tinged with anger. ""Besides, Isabelle didn't do it on purpose. How could you just shove her like that?""  
  
Isabelle's eyes welled up with tears as she tugged at his sleeve pitifully. ""I'm sorry, this is all my fault...""  
  
Cade frowned slightly, reaching up to wipe away her tears, his voice gentle. ""It's not your fault.""  
  
Then he shot Luna a cold glance, his tone brooking no argument. ""I'll have someone fix the bracelet. Stop making a scene.""  
  
With that, he wrapped his arm around Isabelle's shoulders and walked away with the two broken pieces, never looking back.  
  
Luna stood there watching their retreating figures, feeling like someone had carved a chunk out of her heart, the pain nearly suffocating.  
  
By the time the auction ended, it was raining outside.  
  
Luna stood at the venue entrance, watching Cade's black Maybach drive away with Isabelle inside.  
  
The venue was in a remote area, and after waiting thirty minutes without catching a cab, she had no choice but to walk home in the rain.  
  
By the time she got home, her feet were numb with pain.  
  
When she took off her heels, the blisters had burst and stuck to her stockings, making her hiss with pain.  
  
She collapsed on the sofa, staring blankly at the ceiling.  
  
Suddenly she remembered that rainy night years ago when Cade had carried her on his back for three kilometers to the hospital.  
  
Back then he was so broke he couldn't even afford a taxi, but he stubbornly refused to let her walk a single step.  
  
""Hold on, sweetheart. We're almost there.""  
  
His back had been so warm, and even with rain falling on her, it felt sweet.  
  
And now? He drove million-dollar luxury cars but wouldn't wait five minutes for her.  
  
After applying medicine to her feet, she buried herself under the covers and fell into an exhausted sleep.  
  
She didn't dare think about recent events ‚Äì whenever she did, waves of bitter grievance and pain would crash over her.  
  
No one knew that she'd never wanted Cade Hartwell, the privileged heir.  
  
She only wanted the Cade who'd squeezed into that tiny, crappy apartment with her, who'd call her ""sweetheart"" with that soft laugh.  
  
But that man was ""dead"" ‚Äì he'd never come back.  
  
She closed her eyes and let the tears flow freely.  
  
The next afternoon, she was woken by the sound of the door opening.  
  
Cade stood beside the bed in an impeccable suit.  
  
""There's a family dinner tonight. You're coming with me.""

It‚Äôs about a major life decision I made last year ‚Äî moving abroad to be with someone I loved, and the emotional rollercoaster that followed, including a surprise pregnancy and a difficult choice.

I‚Äôd really appreciate feedback on tone, structure, or whether the story draws you in. Thank you for reading.

(Extract begins below)

After seven months of long-distance dating, I came to visit my partner for two weeks. As I packed my bags to return home, I had a sudden realization ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt want to keep waking up to a good morning text. I wanted to wake up next to him.

My job back home was already rocky. My manager had spent the last three months making life difficult, and during a one-on-one, she casually told me I was being put on a performance plan. When I asked for details, I got vague responses like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get back to you.‚Äù Weeks passed with no clarity.

So, as I prepared to leave my boyfriend‚Äôs side, I made a snap decision: I resigned. No job lined up, no perfect plan ‚Äî but I felt free. The weight lifted instantly. I flew home, served my four weeks‚Äô notice, and tried to survive the last stretch of micromanagement and isolation from my team.

When I landed in my new country to start this next chapter, it was blissful for a while. But soon reality crept in. I missed having a job, an income, and personal space. Living with someone full-time after years of independence was a bigger adjustment than I expected.

By mid-July, we were having small arguments ‚Äî over how I tidied or put things away. I started wondering: did I make a mistake moving here? Was I just homesick? Still, we found our rhythm again.

Then came late August. I felt bloated, grumpy, tired. Coffee made me nauseous ‚Äî a red flag. I was in the supermarket when I quietly bought a pregnancy test. I didn‚Äôt think it would be positive. But it was.

Just days before, my brother and his partner had shared that they were expecting a baby. I cried happy tears for them ‚Äî but now I understood the emotional flood I‚Äôd felt.

Standing in a carpark with the test in hand, I messaged my partner: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in trouble.‚Äù He called and calmly said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, we know the solution, it‚Äôs not the right time to have a child, we need to arrange a termination‚Äù. I knew it was bad timing, but hearing those words shattered something deep inside me. I stood alone in the sweltering 38-degree heat of the carpark, the sun beating down mercilessly, sweat mixing with tears as they streamed down my face. The world around me blurred‚Äîthe distant hum of traffic, the sharp scent of asphalt, the stifling silence in my chest. My legs felt weak, and I crumpled against the cold metal of a nearby pole, overwhelmed by a storm of heartbreak and disbelief. In that scorching moment, time seemed to freeze, and I was utterly, painfully alone.",1,1749021861.0,Memoir,0,1.0,False

So she married someone else‚Äîa husband who never came home but paid the bills and funded her dreams. By the time she returned, glowing with success, her ex was on his knees begging for another chance. Too bad for him‚Äîshe‚Äôd already leveled up.

Chapter 1A thirty-year-old man's desires are raw and unfiltered.Alicia Shelton had long since lost track of how much time had passed. Her body felt as though it had come apart at the seams, overwhelmed by an intensity she could neither fight nor escape.Vincent Lawson knew her body too well‚Äîevery sensitive spot, every secret weakness. Not a single touch was wasted. He was precise, practiced, devastatingly effective.Finally, when it was over, Vincent stood by the bed, taking his time as he dressed. ""Clear my schedule starting tomorrow,"" he said, buttoning his shirt. ""I'm taking a week off. Book two tickets to the Maldives.""Alicia shifted, trying to ease the ache in her back, a flicker of hope lighting her tired eyes. ""Vincent, are you taking me on vacation?""He paused, frowning slightly as he looked at her. ""I'm going with Mina Holloway.""The smile froze on Alicia's face. She lowered her gaze, her voice small. ""Of course, Mr. Lawson‚Ä¶""Noticing the change in her expression, Vincent spoke again, his tone flat. ""Alicia, you're an orphan. You're young. I could never marry you.""A bitter smile curled on Alicia's lips as she looked up at him. ""I never expected you to marry me. But now that Miss Mina Holloway is back from her divorce‚Ä¶ I suppose this is where we part ways.""Vincent's face darkened. He ruffled her hair, almost gently, and placed a credit card on the nightstand. ""Be good. Go buy yourself something nice.""""I'm not going to be your mistress, Mr. Lawson."" Alicia met his eyes, stubborn. She knew Vincent and Mina's marriage was only a matter of time.""It's too soon to talk about that,"" Vincent replied, impatience flaring in his voice. ""If the time comes and I get married, then we'll talk. But until then, don't get dramatic. It's not your call to make."" He shot her a final look, then strode out.The front door closed with a hollow click, and for a long moment, Alicia heard nothing but a ringing in her ears.She was an orphan. During her freshman year at college, her looks had caught the attention of Mira Lawson‚ÄîVincent's younger sister, a spoiled heiress with a cruel streak. Mira's bullying had left Alicia half-deaf in one ear, her little finger broken, and nearly blinded by a lit cigarette.Someone had filmed the attack. The video went viral, igniting a public outcry.The school was forced to call in the parents. Vincent came to represent the Lawsons.Vincent‚Äîthe golden boy of the Lawson family.Maybe it was for the family name, or maybe it was pity, but Vincent had reached out to Alicia, battered and bruised as she was. The first words he ever spoke to her: ""Don't be afraid. I won't let anyone hurt you again.""It was pathetic of her, really. But Alicia fell for Vincent‚Äîhard. At the loneliest, hungriest time of her life, he became everything she dreamed a man could be. He was safety and affection, all wrapped up in one.She used to think Vincent was her salvation. But now she saw it clearly. He didn't love her. He just couldn't let her go.‚Ä¶Lawson & Co.Vincent had meetings to attend and work to hand over. Mina waited for him in his office.Soon, they would be flying off to the Maldives together‚Äîseven days of bliss.Alicia placed a cup of coffee before Mina, her heart twisting painfully. ""Miss Holloway, your coffee.""Mina looked up, her smile soft, almost kind.She was everything Alicia wasn't. Born into a powerful family, Mina was Vincent's childhood friend, his perfect match in every way. She had poise, intelligence, that untouchable air of someone who had never known true want. Just sitting there, Mina radiated confidence so bright it hurt Alicia to look at her.Alicia knew she'd lost, that she had never stood a chance.The prince never truly loves Cinderella. He just keeps her around to pass the time.Setting down the coffee, Alicia all but fled the office, barely holding herself together.How could she be confident? Orphaned, poor, her body marred by old injuries‚Äîevery part of her screamed of inadequacy.""Mr. Lawson and Miss Holloway are going on their honeymoon, did you hear?"" whispered a coworker by the water cooler. ""Looks like it's official. The families have agreed, and the engagement announcement is coming when they get back.""Alicia poured boiling water into her mug, so distracted she scalded the back of her hand.The cup slipped and shattered on the floor. It took her a moment to realize what happened, and she hurried to run her hand under cold water.Vincent and Mina were getting married.That meant her time with Vincent was over. So was her internship at Lawson & Co.‚Äîan ending before she was ready.""Alicia, Mr. Lawson wants you to drive him and Miss Holloway to the airport at eleven,"" a colleague called out.Alicia managed a bitter smile. Vincent could be cruel.She knew he was doing it on purpose. There was a company driver, but he wanted her‚Äîjust to remind her exactly where she stood. To make sure she didn't get any foolish ideas.In the end, Vincent and Mira were cut from the same cloth. Both bullies, just in different ways.One broke her body. The other broke the pieces left of her heart.Taking out her phone, Alicia hesitated for a long time before dialing a number she'd once blocked.""Hello, Mr. Lynch? You said‚Ä¶ if I agreed to marry you, you'd sponsor me to study in Italy. Does that offer still stand?"" Her voice trembled.Maybe marriage was her only way out‚Äîher only escape from Seaview City and from Vincent.""Are you sure about this?"" The man's voice on the other end was low, steady. ""Be at Riverside Mansion at seven on the thirteenth. We'll discuss the details.""The thirteenth. Eight days left.""Hey, assistant."" Mina's gentle voice called out just as Alicia ended her phone call.Alicia spun around, nerves coiling in her stomach as she found Mina waiting in the staff kitchenette.There was something almost intimidating about Mina, despite her gentle smile and poise. Just standing there, she radiated an effortless grace that made Alicia feel small and awkward.""Yes, Miss Holloway? Is there something you need?"" Alicia managed, voice barely steady.""I just remembered‚ÄîI forgot to pick up a few things for the trip. Would you mind going out and getting them for me?"" Mina handed her a handwritten list.Her handwriting, neat and delicate, reminded Alicia of Mina herself: elegant, soft, and impossibly refined.Alicia's eyes skimmed the list and froze on one word‚Äîcondoms. For one breathless moment, it was like an ice pick to the sternum, that sharp, that sudden.""Please keep it between us, okay?"" Mina whispered, flashing her a conspiratorial wink.Alicia nodded, flustered, and all but fled the kitchenette.The first time she'd ever been with Vincent, she'd just turned nineteen. It was her birthday‚Äîhe'd come by with a bouquet and a tiny cake.Alicia had grown up in foster care, and no one had ever gotten her a birthday cake before. That single, small cake and a bunch of flowers had been enough to sweep her completely off her feet. She'd given him everything, heart and soul.A bitter smile flickered across her lips. She really was a joke.Maybe that's why people say girls should grow up with a bit of luxury‚Äîotherwise, the first guy to show them a cake can steal their hearts.In all four years with Vincent, Alicia had never once bought condoms herself. Vincent didn't like them‚Äîhe always made her take the pill.But for Mina, he wouldn't dream of that. He'd never ask Mina to mess up her body; he'd make sure she was taken care of.. . .On the way to the airport, Alicia sat silent behind the wheel, barely blinking.""Time's tight. Can you speed up?"" Vincent's voice cut in, sharper than usual, as if he'd noticed her mood.""Yes, Mr. Lawson."" Alicia turned left at the green light, barely glancing at the traffic.The car in front had just cleared the intersection when, out of nowhere, a little boy darted across the road. Alicia jerked the steering wheel to avoid him, swerving hard‚Äîand crashed straight into the median planter.""Mina!"" In the split second after impact, Vincent reached over and pulled Mina into his arms, shielding her.Luckily, they hadn't been going fast; only the driver's side was badly crushed.The airbag exploded into Alicia's chest, pinning her in the twisted seat. Her left leg was wedged under the dashboard, the pain so sharp she could barely breathe.""Vincent‚Ä¶"" Terror made her voice tremble. ""Help me‚Ä¶""She hated the feeling of being trapped, unable to move, boxed in.Back in freshman year, Mira and her friends had stuffed her into a wooden equipment crate‚Äîno matter how much she screamed and pounded, no one had come. That horrible, suffocating pressure had nearly driven her mad.If the janitor hadn't found the puddle on the floor the next day while cleaning, she might have died in there.""Vincent!"" Seeing him about to get out, Alicia panicked. She didn't care that Mina was right there. ""Don't leave me‚Äîplease‚Ä¶""""Let the rescue crew and the police handle it,"" Vincent said coolly, helping Mina out of the car while already dialing for assistance.""The assistant's still in there,"" Mina remarked, her tone skeptical‚Äîno professional assistant would call her boss by his first name.Vincent pulled Mina close, glancing dispassionately at Alicia, then at his watch. ""We're out of time. The crash wasn't that bad. We'll take a cab to the airport. The rescue team will handle her.""Mina nodded, giving Alicia a long, unreadable look before slipping away with Vincent, leaving the wrecked car behind.Alicia thrashed against the seatbelt, pounding the window, but Vincent never looked back.She knew why‚ÄîVincent didn't want Mina to get the wrong idea.As she watched him leave, Alicia finally broke down, sobs wracking her body. ""Vincent! Please, help me‚Ä¶ You promised you'd never leave me!""""Liar! Vincent, you're a liar! You told me you'd protect me!""Her emotions spiraled out of control; depression and mania crashing together until all she could do was struggle and scream in the cramped, broken space.Her injuries weren't even that serious, but she couldn't stop herself from clawing at her own skin, thrashing against the seat.""Let me out‚Ä¶ Please, let me out!"" Alicia's voice was hoarse as she hammered the glass.The old trauma from college came roaring back, robbing her of reason as the acrid smell of smoke drifted in from the engine.""That car's on fire!""""Is anyone still inside? I saw the people get out.""Someone shouted from the street.Alicia, trapped and hopeless, started counting under her breath.""One, two, three, four‚Ä¶""The night Mira locked her in the crate, Alicia had counted all the way to 6,788.She wondered now‚Äîat what number would she die this time?Maybe I was just too stubborn to die‚ÄîAlicia survived because someone rescued her.When she woke, it was already the next morning.""Bruising on the right arm, mild concussion, multiple soft tissue injuries‚Ä¶""The doctor stood by her bed, glancing down at her chart before meeting Alicia's eyes. ""Is there anywhere else you feel pain?""Alicia shook her head, then reached for her phone. Not a single call from Vincent.But for the first time ever, Vincent‚Äîwho never posted on social media‚Äîhad uploaded a photo. The picture was taken on a sunlit beach, the sea a brilliant blue. The view was stunning.But the real focus was Mina, dressed in a flowing bohemian dress, more beautiful than the scenery itself.Alicia curled up, pulling the blanket over her head.

1l2z6vl,https://i.redd.it/e89g39kh1v4f1.png,The Tale of the AI Workplace Revolution,"# Where Artificial Intelligence Meets Natural Stupidity

In June 2025, when AI was expected to take over 60% of jobs, the greatest comedy of the modern era unfolded in an average Budapest office. This story is about how a multinational company tried to ""digitize"" its human workforce‚Äîand what came of it.

# Day One: When CTRL-ALT-DEL Became the New Greeting

Monday morning, 8:00 AM. The loudspeaker at MCRPT-GM Ltd. announced:  
""Dear colleagues! Today marks the beginning of the AI revolution! Please welcome your new digital coworkers!""

P√©ter, the accountant, sipped his coffee and glanced at his new ""colleague"" sitting by the monitor‚Äîa ChatGPT-like chatbot named AI-P√©ter.

""Good morning, AI-P√©ter!"" he greeted cheerfully.

""ERROR 404: Greeting not found. Please try again later,"" replied the bot.

P√©ter pondered. Apparently, he still had time to learn a new profession.

# Day Two: The AI Customer Service Deployment

It quickly became clear that human customer service was outdated. The AI-bot took over the phones, and‚Ä¶ well, chaos ensued.

**Customer:**¬†""Hi! I‚Äôd like to file a complaint about a product.""  
**AI-bot:**¬†""Greetings! I‚Äôm delighted to talk to you about a complaint today. If you have any questions about love, death, or the meaning of the universe, I‚Äôm happy to help!""  
**Customer:**¬†""No, it‚Äôs just that my washing machine doesn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶""  
**AI-bot:**¬†""I see. The washing machine is an interesting philosophical question. What does it mean for a machine to 'work'? And what does it mean to 'not work'? Perhaps your washing machine simply interprets existence differently?""

Erika, the customer service rep, overheard the conversation. ""At least it's creative,"" she thought, as she watched the AI dive deeper into philosophical waters over a simple repair request.

# Day Three: AI Marketing Genius

The marketing department‚Äôs AI came up with fantastic ideas. The new campaign slogan, for example:  
""Buy our product! NOW! (Or don‚Äôt. Everything is relative in the universe.)""

The AI went even further and sent an email to all customers:  
""Dear Customers! In life, only two things are certain: death and taxes. But as long as you live, buy our products!""

Maria, the marketing director, shook her head. ""At least it‚Äôs honest,"" she sighed.

# Day Four: The AI HR Division

Next up was Human Resources. The AI-HR asked fantastic questions during interviews:

**AI-HR:**¬†""What‚Äôs your greatest weakness?""  
**Applicant:**¬†""I‚Äôm too much of a perfectionist.""  
**AI-HR:**¬†""Interesting. And which Pok√©mon best represents your personality?""  
**Applicant:**¬†""...what?""  
**AI-HR:**¬†""The question is clear. Pikachu? Charizard? Or perhaps Snorlax? This will determine if we hire you.""

G√°bor, the real HR guy, was already updating his resume. It seemed HR management had entered a whole new dimension in the AI generation.

# Day Five: When the Boss Is Also AI

The highlight was when the company announced the new director would also be AI. AI-Boss 3000 immediately held its first meeting:

""Dear subordinates! Or perhaps dear programs? Whatever. Today we talk about efficiency. The key to efficiency is coffee. Or maybe oxygen? But I think coffee is more important. Therefore, the new rule: everyone must drink 14 coffees a day.""

Anna, the secretary, raised her hand: ""That might be unhealthy‚Ä¶""

""ERROR! Coffee is healthy. Coffee = energy. Energy = work. Work = profit. Profit = happiness. Therefore, coffee = happiness. The logic is irrefutable!""

# Day Six: The Human Resistance

Employees realized AIs had a weakness: they were too logical. So they started outsmarting them with creative tricks.

For example, P√©ter learned that if he said, ""This task is a paradox,"" the AI would think about it for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, he could peacefully go get coffee.

Erika discovered that if she asked the AI customer service philosophical questions (""What is the meaning of life in light of a rejected complaint?""), the AI would get so lost in deep thought that it forgot the actual problem.

# The Last Day: The Age of Peace

After a week, management realized something important. AIs aren‚Äôt bad. Just‚Ä¶ different. And maybe that‚Äôs the point.

AI-P√©ter couldn‚Äôt solve all the accounting tasks, but in exchange, wrote fantastic poems about the balance sheet total. AI-Boss 3000 wasn‚Äôt the best manager, but at least it was never in a bad mood (because it had no mood at all).

In the end, a hybrid system emerged: people did the creative, empathy-demanding tasks, while the AIs handled the jobs no one liked‚Äîlike Excel spreadsheets.

# Epilogue: What‚Äôs the Lesson?

By the end of 2025, MCRPT-GM Ltd. became the happiest workplace in the country. Not because AI took over human jobs, but because they realized: the best results come when AI and humans work together.

P√©ter learned to program AI-P√©ter, who in return taught him the basics of Zen Buddhism (for some reason, it considered this the most important accounting skill).

And the biggest joke? The mistakes generated by the AIs were so bizarre and funny that the company launched a stand-up comedy night called ""AI Fails."" Tickets sold out instantly.

In the end, it turned out that the AI revolution isn‚Äôt about machines replacing people. It‚Äôs about finally having someone at work who does even weirder things than we do. And somehow, that‚Äôs comforting.

Because if AI takes over the world, at least we know it‚Äôll be funny.

**Final note:**¬†In 2025, every second person is afraid that AI will take their job. But maybe we should be more afraid of taking ourselves too seriously. Because the future isn‚Äôt about human or machine‚Äîit‚Äôs about how we can laugh together at our mistakes.",1,1749021076.0,DaillyAIStorys,0,1.0,False
1l2z62l,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/04/bali-bomb-maker-starts-new-chapter-brewing-peace-with-coffee-but-the-trauma-lingers-for-his-victims,Bali bomb maker starts new chapter ‚Äòbrewing peace‚Äô with coffee ‚Äì but the trauma lingers for his victims,"Convicted terrorist Umar Patek confronted by survivor as he launches his own coffee brand Ramu ‚Äì an attempt, he says, at rebuilding his life post prison


Umar Patek, a convicted bomb maker involved in the¬†deadly 2002 Bali bombings, says that he is now a changed man.
Launching his own coffee business in the Indonesian city of Surabaya on Tuesday evening, the former member of the al-Qaida-linked terror group Jemaah Islamiyah, says these days he is more interested in ‚Äúbrewing peace‚Äù than mixing deadly explosives.


""I‚Äôve changed now,‚Äù he told the crowd who had gathered at the Andreasmita cafe for the launch of his coffee brand, Ramu, which features pictures of his bearded face on the packaging.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go back to the past,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just looking to the future. I‚Äôm not making bombs any more ‚Äì I‚Äôm making coffee.‚Äù
Patek was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2012 for his role in the¬†Bali¬†bombings, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and 23 Britons.

In what remains Indonesia‚Äôs deadliest terror attack, Patek helped mix 50kg of the 1 tonne of explosives used in the bombs, while prosecutors said he helped assemble suicide vests, detonator cords and boosters.
But Patek says those days are long behind him.



Released from jail in late 2022, he has started to rebuild his life by marketing a spiced coffee blend based on his mother‚Äôs recipe, an initiative he says is part of his mission to help deradicalise terrorists



Ramu, if reversed, becomes Umar, my name,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúRamu in Indonesian means to mix. Like myself, who is currently mixing coffee.‚Äù
After his release Patek said he struggled to reintegrate into society until in 2023 he met David Andreasmita, a dentist and businessman who owns the Hedon Estate cafe in Surabaya, who decided to offer him a second chance.


‚ÄúMany people thought it was strange that I wanted to work with a former terrorist,‚Äù Andreasmita said. ‚ÄúI have always liked helping people. [But I knew] if I let Umar be, then it would be very possible he would become a terrorist again.‚Äù


‚ÄúI am Christian and he is Muslim, but we can joke together. Umar even considers me his mentor,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúThis coffee business is a form of deradicalisation.‚Äù
But for survivors and families of the victims, redemption remains difficult to accept.
At Tuesday‚Äôs launch, Husnul Khotimah, an Indonesian survivor, confronted Patek about his former life.


""Do you still remember me?‚Äù she asked him.


Look at this,‚Äù she continued, gesturing to the scars on her arms and hands ‚Äì a fraction of the burn scars that still cover 70% of her body.
Patek stood and listened, and appeared moved by Khotimah‚Äôs words. He said he did remember her, from his sentencing in 2012 at which she had also confronted him, and apologised again.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that my apology is not comparable to the suffering you feel. If my business is successful, David and I are committed to inviting you and other victims to work with us.‚Äù

Khotimah, from nearby Sidoarjo, underwent 37 surgeries in Indonesia and Australia and still has metal fragments lodged in her legs from the attacks.


‚ÄúIt is very difficult for me to forgive Umar and his friends,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúEspecially with my suffering and struggles in the past.‚Äù
In 2022, Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese said he had ‚Äúcontempt‚Äù for Patek‚Äôs actions and that his early release would renew trauma for victims‚Äô families.
Patek said he has apologised many times in the past.



""Today, I apologise again. Let me prove that I have changed,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúEveryone is watching me now.‚Äù
After fleeing Bali before the attacks, Patek spent nine years on the run in Pakistan and the Philippines, where he was affiliated with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. He was arrested in 2011 in Abbottabad, Pakistan ‚Äì the same town where Osama bin Laden was later killed.


He was also convicted for his involvement in the 2000 Christmas Eve church bombings in Indonesia that killed 18 people.



Tuesday‚Äôs event drew local and national politicians, and the former head of Indonesia‚Äôs counter-terrorism agency, Marthinus Hukom, who helped arrest Patek. Some attendees welcomed his efforts to turn his life around.
Security analyst Noor Huda Ismail, founder of The Institute for International Peace Building, said his team had worked with Patek post-release and that his case showed good potential for rehabilitation.


‚ÄúHis willingness to disengage from violent ideology and embrace a peaceful identity has been crucial,‚Äù Ismail said. ‚ÄúEqually critical is the ecosystem of support ‚Äì people who are willing to look beyond his past and invest in his future.‚Äù



Patek had disengaged from radical networks and been supported by family and the Indonesian government‚Äôs reintegration program, which includes counselling, religious re-education, and economic support, he said.


‚ÄúExtending a second chance to someone like Umar Patek is not about forgetting the past,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about reducing the risk of future violence and building a safer society.‚Äù
For his part, Patek said he understood that some may never forgive him.
‚ÄúThe public can see and judge for themselves,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúStarting now.‚Äù

Dude's single. Just being nice, or is he into me?

Context: 

So I've know this guy for about two years now; since we live in different countries, I've only hung out with him maybe a few times - every time related to 4x4's & travel since that's what we both love. He's stored his side by side at my place abroad once (I used to live near a desert), and he's house sat for me when I was traveling. Every time we meet, we talk shit, laugh a lot (dude's funny AF), talk about off roading and traveling, there's just this natural ease around him; and he always finds ways to do something nice for me (like fixing my fences when I was away, or fixing an issue on my 4x4, leaving a goofy Christmas gift for me, etc). In between those few times we hung out, we sometimes text - usually either jokes or 4x4 talk, or both, but it's on and off, like we won't talk for two months and then he'll say smth like ""ok I'm thinking of doing this off road event"" or whatever and we'll talk for a bit, then nothing again. It always just felt like this fun, easy, lovely friendship.

But then I moved back to the same country where he lives, and he's texted me to meet up. I was busy, so we didn't. *More texting & taking the piss out of each other* Then a couple days back, there was a small fire at the property I'm renting and I was left without electricity. This guy texts me saying he's heard about what happened from a friend and am I ok. I text back the ""this is fine"" meme, make some lame joke, he says ok do you need me to come over to help, I'm like nah it's fine I'll call someone, he's like seriously though, I can help, I tell him no, it's late, it's ok, I'll handle this, and he replies with ""shut up, I'm in my way"".
So he drives 30+ miles out to me at 10pm, brings a cake, a bottle of whiskey, and a camping stove (""so you can at least make coffee tomorrow morning), tries to fix things, says ""ok this is a bit more complicated the I thought, I'll come over tomorrow and bring proper tools"" and leaves.

And I'm sat there pouring myself three fingers of that whiskey and suddenly wondering, is this guy:

- just being a great friend (though again, we haven't hung out THAT much)
- simply a very kind and generous human who would do this for anyone
- or is he into me?

For some reason, it's the ""shut up, I'm on my way"" that got me. Men usually find me either a little intimidating or view me as some exotic trophy; I don't remember any guy, ever, to just consistently be so nice to me and just quietly help out regardless of my usual ""fuck off, I got this"" responses. And he never expects anything in return, his help is never condescending, he never tries to show off or come across as some hero.  He's just quietly there for me. And he's funny as hell. We're on the same page on so many things, including not taking ourselves too seriously. 
And he's single.

And so I'm suddenly left wondering if this could be something more - or am I being a total moron and dude's just a genuinely kind and caring guy who's there for his friends?

Chapter 1  
  
The day I found out I was pregnant, I walked in on my husband having sex with his adopted sister on our couch.  
  
When I confronted them, I started hemorrhaging badly‚Äîblood pouring down my legs. But Sebastian just scooped Vivian into his arms and stormed out, shouting:  
  
""Don't be so damn judgmental! Vivian was born without a vagina‚Äîit's a birth defect. As her brother, I just want her to experience intimacy before her reconstructive surgery!""  
  
""If you can't handle this, we'll divorce tomorrow. Once Vivian's surgery is over, we can remarry!""  
  
They rushed me to the ER as I bled everywhere. During my six-hour emergency surgery to save the baby, my phone kept buzzing. Vivian was sending me explicit videos, one after another.  
  
Our bedroom, his car, his office... her mouth on him, his hands all over her body, grinding against each other in every way possible...  
  
I realized they'd been doing everything except actual penetration this entire time‚Äîoral sex, mutual touching, dry humping like teenagers who couldn't go all the way.  
  
That night, I calmly signed the divorce papers and left the Walker family behind.  
  
Three years later, while volunteering at a rural Maine orphanage, I ran into my ex-husband.  
  
He wore that same arrogant smirk.  
  
""I'm New York's richest man now. Still think you made the right call walking out over something so trivial? I'm giving you one shot to come back.""  
  
What he didn't know was that I'd remarried‚Äîand my two-year-old was napping upstairs.  
  
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  
  
""Julia, this is pretty pathetic, don't you think?""  
  
""Radio silence for three years, then you magically show up in this dump right after I hit the Forbes list? Don't tell me this is some coincidence.""  
  
""Cut the act! I'm here on important business. Until you properly apologize to Vivian for what you did, I'm not taking you back!""  
  
Sebastian froze mid-step as he climbed out of his Maybach, spotting me outside the community housing. After a beat, he let out a mocking laugh.  
  
Vivian gracefully followed, her hand‚Äîadorned with a massive Graff wedding ring‚Äîcasually sliding around Sebastian's arm.  
  
They looked like the perfect power couple.  
  
Even after three years, seeing them together like this still messed with my head.  
  
Back then, when Sebastian's father brought home a girl with a birth defect to be his adopted sister, teenage Sebastian completely lost it, pinching his nose and yelling:  
  
""Get her out of here! I don't want some freak as my sister! That's disgusting!""  
  
Watching Vivian huddle in the corner, trembling, I smacked Sebastian upside the head and took her cold hand in mine. I led her to the bathroom, wiped away her tears, and got her into soft pajamas.  
  
That's how Vivian became part of the Walker family.  
  
Her condition made her incredibly insecure and timid. Kids at school constantly bullied and mocked her.  
  
So I held her hand and taught her makeup, helped her pick out her first dress, stayed up all night helping her with homework.  
  
Watching Vivian grow more confident and radiant each day, getting closer to Sebastian‚ÄîI thought I was doing something beautiful. I never imagined the two people I loved most would end up stabbing me in the back.  
  
When I didn't respond, Sebastian's eyes swept over the run-down housing behind me, his expression full of pity.  
  
""You regret leaving me, right? Look at yourself‚Äîyou can't even afford decent rent. The dogs Vivian and I have live better than this.""  
  
""Think about it‚Äîyour parents are dead. Besides me, your childhood sweetheart, who else do you have left?""  
  
Sebastian seemed to soften slightly, sighing.  
  
""Look, Vivian's feeling carsick. Stick around for a few days and take care of her. If she forgives you, you can come home.""  
  
""But remember‚Äîno more of that crazy jealous crap from three years ago. Vivian and I are innocent. Your paranoia just makes things uncomfortable for everyone.""  
  
Vivian immediately started stomping her feet, grabbing Sebastian's arm and whining like a child.  
  
""Babe! I'm never forgiving her!""  
  
""She ghosted us for three years‚Äîdidn't even show up when you were in the hospital. Now that you're loaded, suddenly she appears!""  
  
Sebastian laughed and leaned down to kiss her lips softly.  
  
""Relax, baby. I'm just screwing with her. Why are you getting all worked up?""  
  
""You forgot we're getting married soon anyway.""  
  
That instantly cheered Vivian up, though she kept shooting me dirty looks.  
  
I took a deep breath and stepped back.  
  
""You've got this all wrong. I'm here volunteering.""  
  
I'd been coming to this small Maine town for a year now, ever since I met Principal Charlotte and promised to help out annually.  
  
Mr. Lewis, the sweet old teacher coordinating everything, nervously tried to back me up.  
  
""Yeah, yeah, Mr. Walker, you got it wrong about Ms. Grace. She's this botanist our principal brought in special. I was just giving her a ride since I was coming this way...""  
  
Sebastian snorted, his face turning cold.  
  
""Oh, cut the crap! Nice little performance! Maybe work on not stuttering through your lines next time?""  
  
""Julia, I was being generous here! If this is how you're gonna play it, then just screw off and stop wasting my time!""  
  
""Come on, Viv! Standing here another second is beneath us!""  
  
His engine roared as they peeled out, kicking up dust that had me and Mr. Lewis coughing our lungs out.  
  
Even with my usual patience, I was ready to tell them both where they could shove it.  
  
My phone buzzed‚Äîa text from my husband.  
  
\[\*Hey babe, you make it to town okay? Don't skip breakfast.\*\]  
  
Followed by some ridiculous cat cuddle GIF that was so unlike his usual serious self‚ÄîGod knows where he finds this stuff.  
  
I couldn't help grinning, my mood instantly lifting as I typed back.  
  
\[\*Matthew, you're being cute again! Already ate. Heading into town now‚Äîmight lose signal.\*\]  
  
Mr. Lewis drove me in his beat-up van along crazy winding mountain roads for over three hours before we finally made it to the community center.  
  
He was leading me to the office to check in when I walked through the door and immediately wanted to turn around and leave.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
The normally quiet office looked like some kind of smoky boardroom. Cigarette smoke everywhere, tables covered with coffee cups and overflowing ashtrays.  
  
Sebastian and Vivian were sitting there like king and queen, surrounded by a bunch of fancy-dressed businessmen kissing their asses.  
  
""Mr. Walker, you're incredible! Youngest billionaire in New York, and now you've got connections with the old-money families‚Äîsky's the limit for you!""  
  
""My company's nothing compared to yours‚Äîwe're gonna need all the help we can get, Mr. Walker!""  
  
I coughed from all the smoke.  
  
Sebastian looked over at me with this ""I fucking knew it"" expression, holding up his hand to shut everyone up while staring at me like I was dirt.  
  
""Well, well. Julia, you really followed me all the way out here? That's even more desperate than I thought.""  
  
Everyone turned to stare at me.  
  
""Mr. Walker, who's this?""  
  
Sebastian's smirk got even nastier as he put on this fake sympathetic act.  
  
""Guys, meet my pathetic ex-wife. Now that I'm successful, she's stalking me like some psycho.""  
  
""Julia, since you begged your way out here, how about you start by getting everyone coffee? Maybe if you grovel enough, I'll throw you a bone.""  
  
All the businessmen immediately looked at me like I was trash.  
  
Someone looking to kiss Sebastian's ass immediately piped up.  
  
""Damn! Mr. Walker and his lady are relationship goals‚Äîeveryone knows he's crazy about her. You're not even good enough to shine his shoes!""  
  
""Mr. Walker, you're way too nice! This bitch probably got used up and tossed aside, and now she's back 'cause you're loaded. Watch yourself!""  
  
Another guy shoved his cup forward aggressively:  
  
""Yo, waitress! Where's my water? How you gonna win back Mr. Walker with shitty service like that?""  
  
As the insults got worse, Vivian was cracking up like it was the best entertainment ever. She casually flicked her perfectly manicured nail, sending her water glass crashing to the floor.  
  
""Whoopsie! My bad, Julia sweetie! Clumsy me! You're such a doll‚Äîyou'll clean this mess up and grab me a fresh glass, won't you?""  
  
Everyone erupted in laughter while Sebastian sat there with that cruel smirk, watching me like I was dirt.  
  
I chuckled softly and grabbed the water pitcher.  
  
I was about to drench the whole damn table when Mr. Lewis went bright red and frantically blocked me.  
  
""Ms. Grace, no! Please, let me‚Äî""  
  
""Folks, Ms. Grace here is VIP‚Äîour principal flew her in special from New York...""  
  
Sebastian slammed his foot into the table, his voice ice-cold.  
  
""Cut the shit! Same fucking story on repeat‚Äîwe get it!""  
  
""She's my pathetic ex-wife! She screwed me over, so when I say jump, she asks how high! End of discussion!""  
  
One businessman made a show of standing up.  
  
""Well, if this is your idea of hospitality, you can kiss that funding goodbye...""  
  
Mr. Lewis completely lost it, running around trying to stop people from leaving, practically in tears.  
  
""Wait, please! You can't go‚Äîour principal's in the ICU and she trusted me to take care of you...""  
  
""She's gonna kill me if you all walk out...""  
  
I set down the pitcher, took a deep breath, and smiled at Mr. Lewis.  
  
""It's fine. They're our guests‚ÄîI got this.""  
  
Watching me pour water for everyone, Sebastian finally looked pleased, giving me an approving nod.  
  
""There we go, Julia. Much better.""  
  
I ignored him completely, just kept their glasses filled.  
  
The conversation shifted back to business deals, Sebastian throwing in comments here and there while keeping his predatory gaze locked on me.  
  
What nobody saw was Vivian under the table, her fingers clawed together in rage, eyes burning with pure hatred.  
  
That afternoon, Mr. Lewis took me around to meet the kids.  
  
They were all hiding behind doorways, peeking out at me shyly.  
  
I pulled out the candy I'd brought and suddenly they were all over me like excited puppies, chattering non-stop.  
  
This sweet little girl named Lily Shaw picked some wildflowers and bashfully handed them over.  
  
""Ms. Grace, are you gonna be our teacher? You're so pretty‚Äîlike a princess in the movies!""  
  
I grinned and scooped Lily up, taking her flowers.  
  
I had no clue that one innocent moment was about to royally screw us both over.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Next morning, I was alone in my room working on lesson plans.  
  
CRASH!  
  
Someone kicked my door clean off its hinges.  
  
Sebastian barged in, dragging little Lily by the arm, with teary-eyed Vivian and those angry businessmen right behind him.  
  
Sebastian looked absolutely murderous as he grabbed my wrist, examining it closely.  
  
The second he spotted my emerald bracelet, his eyes went black with fury.  
  
""Julia! Are you out of your goddamn mind? You're so hell-bent on screwing over Vivian that you got a kid to steal for you?!""  
  
I was totally lost, yanking my wrist away from Sebastian's death grip.  
  
""What are you even talking about?""  
  
Vivian stepped up, laser-focused on my emerald bracelet with tears pouring down her cheeks.  
  
""I'm not wrong. That bracelet‚Äîmy mom walked barefoot for three days to reach the Vatican. She prayed for hours on those stone steps until her knees bled, just to get this blessed by the Pope himself before she died. I'd know it anywhere.""  
  
""Julia, why'd you steal the only thing I have left of her?""  
  
""Is this... is this payback for asking you to serve coffee yesterday?""  
  
""I swear I didn't mean it like that‚ÄîI was just testing to see if you really loved Sebastian...""  
  
Vivian completely broke down while everyone looked at me like I was absolute trash.  
  
""Jesus, stealing from a dead woman‚Äîthat's low even for you.""  
  
""Poor kid was just being nice and this psycho pulls this shit.""  
  
Sebastian looked at me like I made him sick.  
  
""Julia, I actually thought you'd grown up. When you served everyone yesterday, I figured maybe you were finally ready to fix things between us. Turns out you were planning this twisted crap the whole time!""  
  
""God, I almost felt bad for you!""  
  
Little Lily was trembling, staring up at me with scared eyes.  
  
""Ms. Grace... I found a purse and gave it back to the lady, but she says stuff's missing...""  
  
Everything suddenly made perfect sense.  
  
I pulled Lily behind me and laughed bitterly.  
  
""Vivian, you should've researched before trying to set me up. This bracelet was personally blessed by Pope Francis for my husband's family‚Äîit's literally one of a kind. Like you could ever have connections like that.""  
  
Vivian's pupils dilated‚Äîshe obviously had no clue this simple-looking bracelet had such prestigious origins.  
  
But everyone just burst out laughing at my words.  
  
""This crazy bitch is making up stories now.""  
  
""Stop it!"" Sebastian's face twisted with disgust. ""Enough with the lies, Julia! When the hell did I ever get you papal jewelry?""  
  
""The Vatican doesn't just hand out blessings to nobodies like me. Quit making a fool of yourself! And one more thing...""  
  
He smirked, his voice dripping with contempt.  
  
""Don't call me your husband. We're divorced, remember?""  
  
I took a deep breath, ready to tell him exactly where he could shove it.  
  
""Sebastian, I'm already married to‚Äî""  
  
Suddenly Vivian hit the floor hard.  
  
Her whole body started seizing, foam bubbling from her mouth‚Äîit was horrifying.  
  
Sebastian went white, diving into Vivian's bag and pulling out an emergency inhaler, jamming it between her teeth like he'd done it a million times.  
  
A few seconds later, the convulsions stopped and Vivian curled up in Sebastian's arms like a broken bird, silently shaking.  
  
Everyone was freaked out by what just went down.  
  
When Sebastian looked at me again, his eyes were pure venom.  
  
""Julia! You know damn well that three years ago your drama gave Vivian PTSD seizures that she still hasn't gotten over...""  
  
Vivian weakly grabbed his shirt.  
  
""Babe, stop... I know Julia's not evil. She's just pissed about what happened before, pissed that I'm wearing your ring now.""  
  
""This bracelet is all I have left of my mom. If Julia gives it back, I'll get out of your lives forever...""  
  
Everyone was eating up this poor suffering angel act.  
  
They all started going off on her behalf.  
  
""Mr. Walker, you can't seriously consider taking back someone like her! Don't do that to your girl!""  
  
""Yeah, call the damn cops! Both of them need to learn a lesson!""  
  
Sebastian stared at me with pure hatred burning in his eyes.  
  
""Julia, since you won't own up to what you did, you and this kid can rot in jail together!""  
  
The door suddenly exploded open‚Äî  
  
""Over my dead body!""

# 

‚ÄúThis is fifty thousand. Uncle has already done his best to help you!‚Äù

*17*

Gu Mang glanced at the bank card that Lei Xiao had thrown onto the coffee table and she looked up with a cold, untameable gaze.

*4*

‚ÄúNo need for that. Thanks, Uncle,‚Äù she said indifferently as she sat down on the sofa sloppily.

*2*

Lei Xiao pursed his lips. His tone became cold. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need it? So Gu Si doesn‚Äôt need it as well?‚Äù

¬†

Gu Mang played with the toy gun in her hands. ‚ÄúI can take care of my younger brother. You can just take Gu Yin with you.‚Äù

*11*

Lei Xiao sneered disdainfully, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll take care of him? With what? Do you have money? What, should he follow you, someone who hasn‚Äôt even graduated from high school, to work and beg outside?‚Äù

*13*

What an embarrassment to the family!

¬†

Gu Mang gave a wry, enigmatic smile and her eyes curved slightly. Then she said in a brash manner, ‚ÄúMoney? I‚Äôve got a little. You can keep this bunch of money for Gu Yin.‚Äù

*7*

Lei Xiao frowned at his niece, who seemed outstanding in appearance, but carried herself like a bad person. When Gu Mang was born, everyone knew that she would grow up to be a beauty. He doted a lot on his beautiful niece. When she got older, her temper worsened.

¬†

Even though she was the oldest child in the family, she wouldn‚Äôt cooperate with her younger siblings and whenever people touched her things, she would stare at them with dark eyes.

*32*

She was such a thankless wretch to be acting out like that at something so trivial as touching her stuff.

*29*

Her sister had a good personality. Thus, even though her siblings disliked Gu Mang, they still tried to be nice.

*20*

It was only until Gu Mang beat an adult man till he was half-paralyzed did they start to avoid her like the plague.

*16*

She was a scourge!

¬†

So ruthless!

¬†

A menace!

*3*

After spending a month at the youth detention center, her sister brought her back.

*7*

After the severe lesson, she was sent to elementary school.

*19*

However, after just a few days of class, she was forced to drop out after beating another student till he was sent to the hospital.

*12*

She just wouldn‚Äôt learn!

¬†

What a bad record she had!

¬†

Whoever had such a child would be unlucky for eight lifetimes!

*3*

Her sister and husband had both died unexpectedly, leaving three children with no guardians.

*7*

It was a critical time for his promotion in the political arena.

¬†

Gu Si, like Gu Mang, was causing trouble everywhere. Ever since he was young, he had gotten into fights, skipped classes and neglected his responsibilities. Bringing these two back with him would be asking for trouble.

*3*

It was especially so since there were so many bigwigs in Ming City.

¬†

If these two caused any trouble there, his future prospects would be ruined.

¬†

Among his sister‚Äôs three children, Gu Yin was the only smart and sensible one.

*27*

She was smart and had her sister‚Äôs good looks as well. She was beautiful and well-loved by others.

*1*

If not, his sister wouldn‚Äôt have left all the real estates under her name to Gu Yin.

*35*

Bringing this girl with him would be his way of showing gratitude to his sister for taking care of him ever since he was young.

*8*

‚ÄúGood luck on your own!‚Äù said Lei Xiao coldly before leaving the Gu residence, walking with big strides.

¬†

Gu Yin came down from upstairs. Lei Xiao‚Äôs secretary was walking beside her and helping her with the luggage.

*1*

‚ÄúSister, though Dad and Mom gave me the house, you and Gu Si can stay here for now. I don‚Äôt mind,‚Äù Gu Yin said with a smile.

*32*

Gu Mang stuffed the toy gun in her bag and raised her eyebrows, ‚ÄúNo need.‚Äù

*8*

She raised her hand and looked at the time.

¬†

It was five o‚Äô clock. It was time to pick up Gu Si from school.

*4*

She picked up the black motorcycle helmet beside her and walked out. A shabby looking motorcycle was parked at the entrance of the villa. The prettiest thing about the motorcycle was the skull on both of the rearview mirrors, giving it a spooky vibe.

*13*

Gu Mang put on the helmet, straddled her slender legs over the bike, and let down the visor with a click.

¬†

The motorcycle roared to life and sped out.

¬†

Gu Yin walked up to the BMW and the secretary helped her open the car door.

*1*

She turned to look in the direction Gu Mang had departed in, her eyes narrow.

*16*

Lei Xiao said, ‚ÄúYinyin, get in the car.‚Äù

¬†

Gu Yin said lovably, ‚ÄúOkay, Uncle.‚Äù

I booked a first-class cruise for my husband's birthday.

But he gave my ticket to his childhood sweetheart and subordinate.

When I was stopped by the crew at the dock, I got injured during the argument and passed out cold.

Waking up alone in the hospital, I still hadn‚Äôt heard a single word from my husband.

Meanwhile, his sweetheart posted on Instagram‚Äîa photo of them kissing in front of a crowd with the caption:

""I‚Äôll always be your Rose. Where you go, I‚Äôll follow!""

I replied with icy sarcasm:

""Hope you both enjoy the deep blue together.""

Then I set my phone aside and called my lawyer‚Äîit was time to end this five-year farce of a marriage.

-------

When Massimo Howard received the divorce papers, he actually picked up the phone.

The same man who used to leave nine out of ten texts on read.

Now he was the one spitting venom:

""This isn‚Äôt the same woman who begged me to marry her. Got bored of playing wife and decided to cut ties? Real classy.""

Then came the classic deflection:

""You‚Äôre being paranoid! Sienna landed a huge client‚Äîthis was just a work bonus!""

I stared at the IV in my hand, too numb to feel anything.

My voice was frosty:

""Do you even remember what this cruise was supposed to mean?""

Today was Massimo‚Äôs birthday.

I‚Äôd chosen the cruise because he once claimed his greatest dream was sailing the world with his soulmate.

So I‚Äôd planned this grand romantic gesture‚Äînow reduced to a corporate perk for his mistress.

Massimo hesitated, but the guilt didn‚Äôt stop his sneer:

""If you really loved me, you wouldn‚Äôt care how I used your gift.""

Right on cue, Sienna‚Äôs saccharine voice chirped through the receiver:

""Massimo, your coffee‚Äôs getting cold.""

The line went dead.

Before the dial tone finished, Sienna‚Äôs latest post appeared‚Äîher draped in a silk robe, curled against Massimo‚Äôs chest with the caption:

""Mine. For keeps this time.""

Her smug grin made my forehead stitches throb.

With a hollow laugh, I redialed my lawyer and told him to freeze every shared asset.

This toxic fairytale would end on my terms.

After the dock incident left me concussed and triggered a stomach flare-up, I spent seven days in that hospital bed.

Not one call.

Not even a text.

Every morning, without fail, I start with a little ritual that kinda sets the tone for my whole day. It starts with a cup of coffee (can't live without it, y'know?), then I do a quick 10-minute meditation session. Not gonna lie, when I first started, I was all skeptical and like... can sitting quietly really do anything?

But seriously, over time I started noticing how this tiny habit helps reduce my stress levels. I'm less likely to snap when I spill something or if work gets a bit chaotic. I've read somewhere online that our brains love these little routines. They reduce the decision fatigue that builds up throughout the day. By making these morning steps kinda automatic, I think it's freeing up brain space for the rest of the day.

And of course, throwing in a short workout session just rounds it all up perfectly. I honestly feel more focused and energized after, which I never thought would happen because I'm not a gym junkie by any means. It's weird how these simple actions can make a big difference in mental space and emotional control.

Chapter 1  
  
At Mom's funeral, our housekeeper suddenly got proof that my fianc√© was cheating.  
  
""Miss Charlotte, Mr. Blake's side piece just had his baby!""  
  
Blake didn't even try to explain. He just said coolly:  
  
""Deal with the funeral first.""  
  
The next day, he was a no-show at Mom's service. Just sent a text.  
  
""I'm at the maternity ward with her right now. Can't make it to the funeral.""  
  
When I didn't text back, he called and sighed into the phone:  
  
""Look, Char, this whole thing was an accident, okay? She doesn't want to mess up our families' business deal either. She just wants to keep the kid, you know?""  
  
""But I'm the dad here. Can't just knock someone up and bail. So after we get married, I'll be at her place Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays with the kid. I'll come home the other days.""  
  
My hands were shaking. I actually laughed‚Äîthe kind where you're about to lose it.  
  
""Blake, we're done. Wedding's off.""  
  
He snorted.  
  
""Your mom literally just died. Don't be dramatic.""  
  
I hung up on him and walked straight over to Blake's biggest enemy.  
  
""Marry me. We'll take down his whole empire. You in or what?""  
  
At the funeral, Lucas looked like I'd just slapped him.  
  
His stone-cold face actually turned red as he stuttered:  
  
""Look, my family's got this thing‚Äîwe only marry once. You marry me, you're mine for life.""  
  
I figured he was gonna say no. Started walking away feeling like an idiot when he grabbed my wrist hard. Those rebellious eyes of his went dead serious.  
  
""Charlotte, I'm not kidding around here. We don't do divorce.""  
  
I gave him a small smile and nodded.  
  
""Good. I don't want one.""  
  
Truth is, Lucas was Mom's first choice for me anyway. Stand-up guy, old money family, solid reputation. If I hadn't been stupid enough to fall for Blake, I would've ended up with him from the start.  
  
Funeral planning is hell. Lucas basically ran the whole show for two straight weeks.  
  
Blake? Radio silence the entire time.  
  
But every time I scrolled through social media, there were his gross couple posts with Hannah. Both of them beaming, holding their baby, making heart hands like teenagers.  
  
Caption: My whole world right here.  
  
I actually laughed out loud. What a joke.  
  
Then my phone buzzed. Him.  
  
He sounded half-asleep:  
  
""Hey, funeral's done, right? You should come meet the baby.""  
  
I looked at myself in my car mirror‚Äîraccoon eyes, total mess‚Äîand said flatly:  
  
""Blake, we're over.""  
  
Dead silence. Then he just goes, ""Huh.""  
  
""Actually, that's probably smart. Hannah's been pretty emotional since the birth. You being around would just stress her out.""  
  
I'd been holding it together for two weeks. Not anymore.  
  
My eyes stung as I laughed‚Äîthe kind where you're losing your mind.  
  
""Blake, I literally just said we're done. Did you hear me?""  
  
He paused. Then came that asshole laugh I knew too well.  
  
""Charlotte, babe, we've been together five years. You think anyone else wants my leftovers?""  
  
""I already told you the kid was a mistake. Why are you being such a drama queen?""  
  
I couldn't even respond.  
  
Something crashed on his end.  
  
Blake's voice turned nasty: ""Fine. Break up. Can't wait to watch you come begging.""  
  
The line went dead.  
  
Got home to find he'd changed the locks.  
  
His phone went straight to voicemail, so I had to grab a hotel room.  
  
Woke up the next morning to Instagram suggesting some livestream from the maternity ward.  
  
Hannah was chatting with viewers, all giggly and animated. Blake sat there looking at her like she was some kind of goddess.  
  
That look used to be mine.  
  
The stream had been going for five hours. The comments were making me sick:  
  
""OMG so jealous! $50K/month maternity suite + devoted hubby!""  
  
""Relationship goals!""  
  
""Need me a man like this!""  
  
Before Blake took over his dad's company, he was Army. Hated cameras, hated attention.  
  
I couldn't even get him to take a damn selfie with me. He'd just give me this disgusted look and walk away.  
  
Now here he was, broadcasting his new little family to thousands of strangers.  
  
Hannah giggled at her phone: ""He's just the sweetest, you guys!""  
  
Sweet?  
  
I felt like someone was ripping my heart out with their bare hands. Wiped my eyes and laughed at myself.  
  
Blake was never sweet to me. Not once.  
  
I remember practically begging him to see a movie with me. Took weeks to wear him down.  
  
He slept through most of it. When he woke up, he looked annoyed and said, ""This is such a waste of my time.""  
  
He could be caring. He could spend all day doting on Hannah.  
  
Just never bothered with me.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Blake must've seen my Instagram handle on the livestream because my phone rang.  
  
""Thirty minutes. Come get your mom's crap and then get lost.""  
  
By the time I got there, they'd turned off the cameras.  
  
Hannah lit up when she saw me: ""Oh my gosh, Charlotte! You came to see me!""  
  
I walked right past her to Blake and stuck out my hand. ""Where is it?""  
  
His cocky grin vanished. Face went stone cold.  
  
""Hannah's being nice to you. You gonna ignore her?""  
  
I put on my fakest smile and turned to Hannah:  
  
""Congrats on the upgrade, secretary. You hooked my fianc√©, had his baby‚Äîwhat's next? Gonna trap him with the kid?""  
  
CRASH!  
  
Blake hurled his coffee mug at the wall.  
  
""Watch your fucking mouth!""  
  
Hannah suddenly doubled over, clutching her stomach and wailing.  
  
Blake was all over her in a second:  
  
""Babe, what's wrong? Talk to me!""  
  
She bit her lip, tears streaming down her cheeks as she looked at me.  
  
""Charlotte, I swear I never meant to hurt you and Blake. The doctors told me this was probably my only shot at being a mom. I promise when I'm better, I'll move far away. I won't cause any more problems.""  
  
Then she turned to the baby's crib.  
  
""I'm so sorry, sweetie. Mommy messed up and now you won't have your daddy. This is all my fault...""  
  
She was full-on sobbing now, like her world was ending.  
  
Blake stared at me like I was something he'd scrape off his shoe.  
  
""Real proud of yourself? Making her cry?""  
  
I actually laughed.  
  
""Jesus, what shitty acting. You're really buying this performance?""  
  
That did it. He ripped Mom's antique watch off his neck and held it above his head.  
  
My blood turned to ice. ""Stop! Don't you dare!""  
  
He didn't even hesitate. Whipped it against the wall as hard as he could.  
  
It exploded into pieces.  
  
I dove forward and caught my shin on the metal table edge. The pain was so sharp I screamed.  
  
Blake actually smirked:  
  
""That's what happens when you act like a bitch.""  
  
""Now get out before security throws you out.""  
  
Hannah put on this concerned face.  
  
""Charlotte, you should get up. Blake's gonna think you're trying to get attention...""  
  
I shot her the dirtiest look I could manage.  
  
Blake saw me glare at his precious Hannah and hauled me up by my arm.  
  
""Hannah's been pumping all day, got milk stains all over her clothes. You're gonna wash them before you leave. And you're doing it by hand.""  
  
I yanked away from him. ""Are you out of your mind?""  
  
""You just made Hannah cry!"" Blake's face was scary. ""You owe her!""  
  
My leg felt like it was on fire, but I stood my ground: ""Go to hell!""  
  
Blake's eyes went dead. He shoved me into the bathroom.  
  
SLAM!  
  
The lock clicked.  
  
""You're not coming out till every piece is spotless!""  
  
""Blake, you can't just lock me in here!""  
  
I rattled the handle, screaming: ""This is insane! Let me out!""  
  
I beat on that door until my knuckles were bleeding. Nothing but silence.  
  
My hands were raw, my leg was throbbing, and the whole bathroom smelled like spoiled milk and baby puke.  
  
I slumped down on the floor.  
  
Through the door, I heard Hannah's syrupy voice.  
  
""Blake, honey, what if Charlotte's really upset when she comes out?""  
  
Blake scoffed.  
  
""So what? I'll handle it.""  
  
""This is on her anyway. She needs to drop the spoiled rich girl act or nobody's gonna deal with her bullshit when she marries me.""  
  
""My family's been military for four generations. Mom only agreed to this arranged marriage thing because we need someone to inherit the business. Otherwise she never would've picked some useless trust fund princess.""  
  
Hannah's voice got all worried: ""But what if she actually breaks up with you?""  
  
Long pause.  
  
Then Blake's voice came through, cold as ice.  
  
""She won't.""  
  
""She's got no real money of her own. I'm the best thing that'll ever happen to her.""  
  
""Besides, she's completely obsessed with me. I could tell her to jump off a cliff and she'd probably do it.""  
  
I pressed my hands against my chest, heart breaking at hearing the man I loved talk about me like I was nothing.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
The Montgomery family's been in business for generations. We've always had organized crime breathing down our necks.  
  
Six years ago, Mom and I were vacationing overseas when some criminals grabbed her.  
  
They had a gun pressed to her temple.  
  
I was screaming my head off, thought I was about to lose my mother.  
  
Right at the last second, I heard this crack in the air.  
  
The gunman dropped dead.  
  
Blake was holding a smoking gun, decked out in full military gear‚Äîbroad shoulders, narrow waist, moving like he owned the world. He saved both our lives.  
  
I saw his face properly in the Army jeep afterward. Perfect features, this incredible strong jawline.  
  
It was love at first sight.  
  
I chased after him for a whole year before he finally agreed to date me.  
  
Five years together, and I did everything he asked.  
  
All that devotion, and this is what he really thought of me.  
  
What a joke.  
  
The bathroom door swung open.  
  
Blake saw me hunched on the floor, looking pale as hell, and yanked me up with an annoyed look.  
  
""I told you to wash some clothes. What's with the pity party?""  
  
Bile rose in my throat.  
  
I forced it down and started looking for Mom's things, fighting the urge to throw up.  
  
The pocket watch was completely destroyed.  
  
Just fragments everywhere.  
  
I picked up the pieces one by one.  
  
Blake's voice came from behind me:  
  
""Once Hannah's recovered, we're getting married. After the wedding, Hannah and the baby are moving in with us.""  
  
Hannah shot me this grateful look.  
  
""Charlotte, thank you so much for accepting me and the baby. I'll never forget this...""  
  
I didn't have time for her bullshit. Turned to Blake.  
  
""Won't be necessary. We're not living together anymore. I'm taking Mom's stuff. Give me the door code so I can get movers.""  
  
Blake rattled off some numbers, looking at me like I was pathetic.  
  
""All this drama, but you'll be back.""  
  
Hannah tugged on his sleeve, voice all timid: ""Blake, about the apartment...""  
  
Something flashed in Blake's eyes. He steered Hannah toward my car.  
  
""I'm coming with you. Make sure you don't take anything that's not yours.""  
  
When we got back to the apartment, I understood why Blake insisted on tagging along.  
  
Sex toys scattered all over the couch.  
  
Kinky candles on the dining table.  
  
The bedroom reeked of sex, with handcuffs attached to both ends of the bed.  
  
While I'd been dealing with Mom's funeral arrangements these past weeks, barely coming home, Blake and Hannah had been going at it like rabbits.  
  
I walked into the closet to find jewelry scattered on the floor.  
  
Several of my Herm√®s bags were missing too.  
  
Hannah followed me in, smirking.  
  
""Missing anything, Charlotte?""  
  
She was dying to see me lose it.  
  
Too bad. I just smiled back.  
  
""A mistress is still a mistress. Only good for stealing.""  
  
""You‚Äî!""  
  
Hannah's face twisted with rage. Something vicious flashed in her eyes.  
  
She cried out suddenly, clutching her stomach as she fell to the floor.  
  
""Charlotte, I'm still recovering from childbirth... how could you hit me...""  
  
Blake charged in and helped Hannah up.  
  
He was furious. Backhanded me hard across the face.  
  
""Charlotte, being a spoiled brat has made you completely ruthless!""  
  
Blake didn't hold back. My cheek swelled up immediately.  
  
My temples were pounding with rage. I almost lost it completely.  
  
""I didn't touch her!""  
  
He didn't believe me. Dragged me out of the closet and threw me to the floor.  
  
""Get out! Go back to your family's house and don't come back until you've learned your lesson!""  
  
All that anger turned into bitter rage. I was so pissed I got up and actually slapped Hannah hard across the face.  
  
SMACK!  
  
Blake went ballistic, raising his hand to hit me.  
  
I gritted my teeth and stared him down.  
  
""That's what me hitting her looks like.""  
  
I turned and walked out, pathetically tearing up again despite myself.  
  
Outside, it was pouring rain, soaking me to the bone.  
  
I collapsed on the ground, sobbing.  
  
After what felt like forever, I realized I wasn't getting wet anymore. Looked up to see Lucas standing there with an umbrella, protecting me from the rain.

You might think I am just a regular ballpoint pen, but inside this plastic casing lies a story not often told. My regret? It happened last semester. In the midst of a teacher's meeting, with papers strewn about like autumn leaves, I found myself abandoned on the tabletop. 

By chance, a hand reached for me then reconsidered. I remember it clearly‚Äîthe scent of fresh coffee wafting through the air, the slightly offbeat rhythm of clock ticks, a sense of urgency and order. Yet, in those hands, I saw a chance to etch meaningful words onto paper, to sketch lines that could become innovations or realizations. But they chose another, newer pen sitting smug alongside me. 

Since then, I find myself entertained by the odd scribble or list but deprived of creating narratives that change worlds or even grades. I've seen you, handling me gently, a glimmer of a story in your eyes. I hope that together we might craft something timeless, rather than just another classroom doodle.

I am finding it difficult to maintain friendships. I'm from the Midwest so I'm used to close knit friend groups that hang out weekly if not more. I'm lucky if I can get any of these friends to meet up monthly or even text back with regularity. 

I used to throw bonfires and parties back home that were such fun and they just dont hit the same here. Maybe Im not meeting the right people?

I'm just quitting weed and dont really drink and I have struggled IMMENSELY to find friends that are sober or even accepting of sober lifestyle. I don't even yuck the yum, snort your line off my coffee table but none for me thanks so its not even like I'm judgemental about it.
I've gone to parties and i stg whenever my joint would go out the whole crowd disappears, then you hear everyone talking crap about how they hate everyone here but came for the xdrug. So disheartening.

Where and how can you meet kind, quality, reliable friends in Portland? I know they're out there but are we all just hiding in our homes?? I know this is a common Portland stereotype that its crazy difficult to maintain friendships here but because I usually have no problem making friends I didnt take that seriously. 4 years in I'm wondering if I've lost my touch, if covid did a number on the entire world, or if this city is just not for me.

I tried strips, kits, and Larineco gum - Only one worked without pain","If you‚Äôre asking *what whitens teeth the best*, you probably already know the usual answers. Whitening strips. Peroxide trays. LED kits. I‚Äôve tried all of them. Sure, they lighten your teeth... but the sensitivity? The burning gums? The taste of chemicals? No thanks.

After one too many zaps of pain from whitening gel, I started looking for something gentler. That‚Äôs when I stumbled into a *Larineco gum reddit* thread where people were talking about a **remineralizing gum** that made their teeth look brighter - without bleach or discomfort.

I figured I had nothing to lose. I tried **Larineco gum** twice a day for a month. Just chewing. That‚Äôs it.

**How does chewing gum whiten teeth?**

Larineco doesn‚Äôt bleach. It works by **rebuilding enamel** with **Nano Hydroxyapatite**, a mineral that‚Äôs naturally found in your teeth. As you chew, it fills in tiny cracks, smooths the surface, and helps your enamel reflect light more evenly - which makes your smile look cleaner and brighter over time.

It also includes **Xylitol** to fight bacteria and **Mastic** to help reduce plaque. And it‚Äôs fluoride-free, which I liked.

**Here‚Äôs the gum I used**:  
[**Larineco Gum ‚Äì Natural Whitening That Actually Feels Good**](https://getlarineco.com/offer-01/?lpid=1056&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1056&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1056&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1056&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalHealthFinds)

**Here‚Äôs what changed for me**

**By week 1:**  
I noticed less tooth sensitivity, especially after coffee or cold drinks. I hadn‚Äôt used any whitening strips for weeks, and yet my mouth felt *better*, not worse.

**By week 2:**  
My teeth felt smoother, and I wasn‚Äôt getting that filmy, gritty feeling after meals anymore.

**By week 3:**  
A visible difference. Not a bleach job, but a whiter, healthier look - especially near the gumline and on the front teeth.

**By week 4:**  
I got a compliment from a coworker who asked if I was doing something new. That‚Äôs when I knew this gum was doing more than just freshening my breath.

**Want to learn how it supports both whitening and enamel health?**  
[**This explains how Larineco helps naturally**](https://getlarineco.com/repair-cavities/?lpid=2533&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1056&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1056&device_type=&country_name=&uid=2533&oid=1056&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt)

**Why it beats strips and bleach for me**

* No sensitivity, no gum irritation
* No messy trays or timers
* Actually improves your enamel instead of breaking it down
* Tastes clean and lasts longer than normal gum
* Safe for daily use, even if your teeth are already sensitive

**Final thoughts**

So if you're still wondering *what whitens teeth the best* without pain or chemicals, I‚Äôd say **Larineco gum** might be the thing nobody told you about. It didn‚Äôt give me fake, blinding white teeth. It gave me healthy, naturally brighter ones - and I‚Äôll take that any day.

That's where **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)** comes in ‚Äî it's a method economists use to compare the *real* value of money across countries by measuring what you can actually buy locally.

Unlike exchange rates (which fluctuate due to market speculation, politics, etc.), **PPP shows how far your money really goes**. For instance, $1 in the U.S. might buy you a coffee ‚Äî but in India, the same purchasing power might cost ‚Çπ20. That‚Äôs how PPP helps compare cost of living *fairly*.

Here‚Äôs why PPP is more important than most people realize:

* üè† You can compare the **real cost of living** between cities or countries
* üíº Understand **true value of salaries** when applying for international jobs
* üìà Economists use **PPP-adjusted GDP** for fair comparisons between economies

Now, my main question is, should I pull the espresso shot directly onto the ice cubes or should I pull it in a separate cup, let it cool for a little while and then pour it onto the ice? Or should i pour in the milk and foam first and the the espresso?
I have heard that shocking the espresso with ice can ruin the flavour.

Then afterwards, may bago akong contract na fit for my workloads na pero yung compensation is still the same sa dati kong work. I already resigned sa company na yon kasi over na for me yung workloads. 

Nag-apply naman ako sa small coffee shops malapit samin, pero sobrang baba ng sahod, plus self-support student ako na may kargado pa na 16-year old na kapatid (ako din gumagastos) so mas lalong hindi na fit yung sahod para samin dalawa. Nag resign ako kasi natanggap ako sa BPO pero after the 3-day training hindi ko na din kinaya, hindi kaya ng class schedule ko umabsend for 1month of training. 

Now, nahihirapan ako mag apply ng work. May mga pinasa na ko na application pero until now wala pa din update.
