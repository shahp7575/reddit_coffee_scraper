1gt8tkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1gt8tkr/5_years_ago_i_ended_my_marriage_with_my_exhusband/,"5 years ago, I ended my marriage with my ex-husband of 10 years, and I regret it every single day","I, 39f Milly (nickname) was married to my ex-husband 39m V.J. (nickname) for 10 years, we had known each other since middle school, got into relationship during sophomore year, we were what our friends and families would call 'childhood sweethearts'.

We both got a nearly full ride scholarships, while the other part of the tuition were covered by our parents, so we didn't have to worry about student loan, we focused on our studies while at the same time our relationship blossomed, In 2009 we got married, as he came from Hindu background, so I knew how important it was to have baby in first year of marriage, but he reassured me we didn't need to rush and understood that with the financial crisis going around, bringing a child into the world and raising was going to be difficult, and we want to give our future child the best life possible, so we held back from trying for a baby, and focused on growing in our career and being more financially stable.

Around 2014, I had just landed a promotion, which meant longer working hours and possible travels, it also meant that we had to put trying for a baby on hold for at least another year, V.J. was supportive, understanding that I can't go on maternity leave just after getting a promotion.

We both were 30 now, and here is when things started to get bad, V.J. asked if we can finally try for baby as we were more than financially stable, he was earning nearly twice as much as me and said I could take maternity leave while he takes care of the finances, I was hesitant and said I will think about it.

What I did next was probably the 2nd biggest mistake of my life, during one of the lunch break with few colleagues and a friend who worked in HR (I always thought she was my friend well I guess I was just another workforce slave they company couldn't afford to lose), I asked them about their opinions, all of them seemed to have similar response that I was peak of my career, after I revealed that V.J. was making nearly twice as much as me and was willing to take over the finances, one of them said that V.J. was probably trying to turn me into a SAHM breeding and raising his babies.

For the next 3 years this thought remained in my head, got me thinking what if it what they said was true, we went from having sex 5 times a week to 5 times a month and even then I tried to make sure he didn't finish inside me and when he did, I took a morning pill.

In early 2018, I got another promotion with significant raise, I was basically living in the office, travelling for work, was barely at home

Then one day out of the blue my mother called me asking for lunch over the weekend, so when I met her there was concern on her face asking me if I was happy in my marriage, as it has been nearly 9 years and V.J. and I haven't had a baby, I shrugged off her concern saying we haven't had time, we both had been busy building with our work, my mother then said with serious look that if I was having an affair, as V.J. had found empty packs of morning pill, and showed it to her and my dad, I came clean that I wasn't having any affair, and that I didn't want a baby, at least not yet, she shook her head and said that I am wasting V.J. life, that he has been unhappy for a while but put on happy masks because he loves me, she warned me and said if I can't give him a baby, eventually someone else will, those words shocked me to core.

After the talk I had with my mother, I didn't know how to approach V.J., then one day I noticed V.J. was genuinely smiling, he was happy, it wasn't and our sex life had got back on track, V.J. was happy that we were intimate both physically and emotionally.

In late of 2018, I lost the baby in the early week of pregnancy, we both were devastated, V.J. tried to console me saying that we can try again, but I was too depressed, we tried again after few months, but it didn't work,

Then in mid 2019, we ran some test and learned that I was never going to conceive, it was heart shattering, I felt like this was god punishing me in some way, V.J. suggested we could try alternative (I should have listened to him then) but I had gone into complete autopilot mode, I focused on work, and then I received a text with dozens of photos from friend which destroyed me, it was V.J. with woman probably in early 20s who looked like she was at least 3 months pregnant, they were at a coffee shop where he was holding her hand, maternity clinic, an apartment building which looked like the girls house with him holding some groceries and hugging her, and then it reminded me what my mother told me, ""If I can't give him a baby someone else will"", I jumped to the conclusion that he was cheating (stupid mistake)

My colleagues rather trying to make me think rationally suggested that if V.J. was screwing around, rather than confronting him I should get even, hurt his ego and emasculate him (never take relationship advice from single female in their late 30s), without thinking afterwork I went to a bar got drunk with them and then ended having sex with a complete stranger, (another stupid mistake), somehow word got out to V.J. and was devastated crying in pain, he didn't say anything and just packed his bag and left, the next few days were blurred, then I was served with divorce paper, my phone started blowing up with messages and call from my family, my mother came over and asked me how I could do this to V.J. after 10 years of loyalty, cheating on him, hooking up with a random stranger, and when I showed her the pictures of V.J. infidelity she just laughed hysterically, and asked me if I showed it V.J. and I said no, she had this look on her face that says she was disappointed in me, and told me that the girl was just fresh out of high school was knocked up her boyfriend, V.J. learned about her through one of the fertility doctor, he got contact with this girl because he wanted to show her that V.J. and I could be great parents to the baby, my mother then took out her phone showed me the profile of the girl Alice (fake name), V.J. wanted to surprise me as the girl was leaning towards the decision that once the baby born she was going to give is the baby, but now it was out of question as V.J. was heartbroken and devastated.

I honestly didn't think for once rationally through this ordeal, how if I could have just talked to him before making a hasty decision, that not only ended our marriage but cost us both a chance of parenthood.

Our divorce went through amicably, without contesting.

A few weeks back, I learned through my family that V.J. had continued to help the girl during her pregnancy, having promised that he wanted to be part of the child's life in some way, when the baby was born it was a boy, the girl even let V.J. be her son's godfather, And V.J. was expecting a child with his new wife Samantha, 29F

It still breaks my heart and kills me, that how I did not once think to talk it out with V.J. maybe just maybe today I would still be married celebrating 15 year wedding anniversary with a 4-year-old boy, but I am not, instead I have become a single white female in her late 30s just like my colleagues....",1,1731830500.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I always thought there was a specific type of bean, roast, or fineness needed, so any recommendations are appreciated, as well as what I should look for, if any.

I am just looking to save money brewing at home [so, budget is 500] or whatever is best. I don’t need an expensive machine. I am thinking most of the money will be spend on coffee, milk, and maybe flavoring with the idea of spending less than $3600 a year.

Good afternoon everyone, 

I hope you’re well. I’m living in the Netherlands for a one year master programme that finishes in February. I was oblivious to the rental market situation and ended up booking a last minute room in a co-living house with one other student roommate and the landlord (60yo man). 

At the beginning it started really nicely. He was polite and attentive and would speak to us about our day. It was a pleasure to be here. However after one month only we noticed that his behaviour changing drastically. 

For the slightest inconveniences he gets pretty angry… To be honest I’ve never seen this type of behaviour before so I suspect that there might be underlying mental issues behind them. I have dozens and dozens of examples but a few could be:
- Loudly runs down the stairs, slams doors, and barges into the kitchen at 6 a.m. when I'm getting ready for my internship as I make coffee.
- Blasts music loudly when I start a Zoom calls with internship colleagues or fellow students. 
- Shouts insults if we close a door in a way that doesn’t meet his preference, accusing us of slamming it.
- Walks into the kitchen, sighs heavily, and starts washing the dishes we've been using while we're still cooking if we've been in there for more than 15 minutes.
- Slams the doors if we spend more than 5 minutes in the shower. 
- Shouts insults if the neighbors’ kids make noise (bad isolation in the house). 
- Throws our laundry on the floor when we have it for more than two days in the basement so he can put his (since we can’t use the dryer and that he doesn’t put the heater on it takes days to dry the clothes). 
And many many more. 

He also enters our rooms when we’re not here and sends very passive aggressive messages in the group chat if we do something not the way he wants it to be to the point that we became so self conscious about everything we do that we barely use the kitchen and mainly buy bread / food we can eat in our room. He also refuses to put the heating higher than 17 and we got sick several times because of this. 

We're not sure how to address the situation because we know he has a quick temper and tends to shout insults or act in a very passive-aggressive manner. It makes it hard to figure out how to respond or what behavior is best to adopt when dealing with him. 

I found out about an ex tenant from a Dutch subreddit about a year ago. She had the exact same issues with him, and when she finally confronted him, it led to a huge fight. He harassed her to the point where she had to leave, blocking her and refusing to return her deposit, which was twice the rent. Even though she hadn’t caused any damage to the room, he threatened her, saying he would bring his friends to attack her. She shared recordings and messages with me, and they were genuinely scary to read. Apparently, he only rents to women, and things often turn sour with most of them. He blocks them and keeps their deposit money. I found out he’s been reported to the police by two previous tenants

I’m so confused and lost about what to do. I’m leaving the Netherlands in three months so I’ll be out soon but I’m concerned for my roommate who will finish her master in June and may have to stay. I’m also concerned for potential future tenants as he is looking for one to take over my room. 

Any advice on what to do? What is the smartest approach in such a situation? I don’t want to create any drama just create a safe / comfortable living situation because we definitely don’t feel home and controlled for everything we do. I think that deep down he might be a good person but he probably has a miserable life and takes it on us. I’m not sure… if anybody had a similar situation and would like to share on it it would be welcome as well 🙏

I went through life until my 30s thinking I was just normal but lazy but after medication...I just have REALLY BAD ADHD.

Without meds I literally can't complete a single task without wandering off to go look on my phone or pace around. I did well in education and was actually a star student in school because it was structured and I was always able to hyperfocus at the last minute, even if I spent weeks procrastinating and getting shouted at, but that's it.

I can't keep a job (organisation, getting there on time, losing focus/motivation, making dumb mistakes and feeling shame), couldn't learn to drive (would forget everything between lessons, couldn't focus on so much at once), couldn't maintain friendships (keeping in touch, making plans and sticking with them). If I started a task, like making the bed, the bed would stay half-made for weeks. It doesn't feel like I'm 'not doing anything,' but by the end of the day I have accomplished nothing, and I look around and my house looks like a tornado hit it.

My mum also has it and it's also severe - problems holding down a job, can't drive, can't organise a house, couldn't take care of us as children (taking us to school every day, remembering to make lunches etc). As far back as I can remember she has drunk over 3 pots of coffee a day to try and 'get up and get organised'. My other sibling has autism.

On medication I'm actually able to function normally for the first time in my entire life. It doesn't feel like I'm stuck in quicksand or firing in 30 different directions while going nowhere. I can't believe the difference and that I spend so much of my life thinking I was just 'lazier' or more 'useless' (words often applied to me) than everyone else. This is a serious condition. It has a major impact. I didn't realise how major until now.",4,1731829578.0,ADHDUK,4,1.0,False

**Step two:** **~~Go insane~~** **Find The Pattern**

Within all fortune telling systems there is a common pattern inherent to humanity. If we abstract it enough from the specific cultural differences, we can find it and in my research, these are the common themes:

* Home, the place you live, your closest family members, comfort
* Money, gain, abundance, riches, sometimes split into a lot of money and just a little
* Death, endings, grief
* Baby, children, begginings, pregnancy
* Happiness, joy, pleasure
* Sorrow, sadness, dissapointment, loneliness, dispair
* Health, vigor, improvement
* Sickness, illness
* Poverty, ruin, loss
* Love
* Hope
* Work, labor
* Anger, fights, conflict, war
* Peace, harmony
* Travel, departure
* Gossip, conversation
* Meeting, date, reunion
* Fame, status, pride
* Change (usually as transformation or moving)
* Disgrace, bad luck, destruction
* Fortune, good luck. Sometimes split into big and small luck
* Victory, success
* Failure
* Loyalty, friendship, friends, help
* Enemies, betrayal, treason, evil, danger
* Obstacles, retard, delay, immobility, burden
* Gifts, flattery. This one is tricky because it can split into seduction or generosity
* Falsehood, lies, deceit
* Party, celebration, wine
* Envy, jealousy
* Letter, message, announcement
* Stability, protection, security
* Inconstancy, instability
* Choices
* Marriage, engagement
* Power, authority
* Laws, lawyers, judge
* Church, priest, faith
* Secrets, private, hidden
* Commerce, merchant
* Folly, madness, vice
* Prudence, patience, wisdom, virtue in general
* Thief, crime (realted to loss and poverty)
* Waiting, expectation (usually related with hope)
* Thoughts, ideas, plans
* Surprise, unexpected
* Time, old, long distance, long time
* Double set of significators for the sitter and the loved one (man & woman) 
* Double set for older/superior people (man & woman)
* Double set for younger/inferior people (man & woman)

**Third step: Fleshing out the system and creating the cards**

Fuck it, I don't want to just make a Lenormand + extra cards. I want to make something new, something more original, so let's do it. 

That one is the basic Patter, now, I want to add some cards that I think are missing and give more fludity to the overall structure like Community' but just minor changes. I like scenic decks BUT symbols are just the bestymbols and they're soooo flexible and multipurpose. That's why Lenormand is still the queen of oracles, you can't ask about random topics to Kipper but you CAN ask Lenormand about how to mop your floor or find lost objects or gain a bet, etc.

The thing is, that all these themes blend with each other in one way or another. For example, Waiting blends with Hope but they're usually different cards, same thing with Fortune and Victory or Loss and Death. It's all in the nuances.

And symbols are just another layer of mixed themes because the Coffin as a symbol does represent death but it's not the same as a Skull or a Stone. Each one has slightly different associations that makes the whole system a super rebel one.

Then one day out of the blue my mother called me asking for lunch over the weekend, so when I met her there was concern on her face asking me if I was happy in my marriage, as it has been nearly 9 years and V.J. and I haven't had a baby, I shrugged off her concern saying we haven't had time, we both had been busy building with our work, my mother then said with serious look that if I was having an affair, as V.J. had found empty packs of morning pill, and showed it to her and my dad, I came clean that I wasn't having any affair, and that I didn't want a baby, at least not yet, she shook her head and said that I am wasting V.J. life, that he has been unhappy for a while but put on happy masks because he loves me, she warned me and said if I can't give him a baby, eventually someone else will, those words shocked me to core.

After the talk I had with my mother, I didn't know how to approach V.J., then one day I noticed V.J. was genuinely smiling, he was happy, it wasn't and our sex life had got back on track, V.J. was happy that we were intimate both physically and emotionally.

In late of 2018, I lost the baby in the early week of pregnancy, we both were devastated, V.J. tried to console me saying that we can try again, but I was too depressed, we tried again after few months, but it didn't work,

Then in mid 2019, we ran some test and learned that I was never going to conceive, it was heart shattering, I felt like this was god punishing me in some way, V.J. suggested we could try alternative (I should have listened to him then) but I had gone into complete autopilot mode, I focused on work, and then I received a text with dozens of photos from friend which destroyed me, it was V.J. with woman probably in early 20s who looked like she was at least 3 months pregnant, they were at a coffee shop where he was holding her hand, maternity clinic, an apartment building which looked like the girls house with him holding some groceries and hugging her, and then it reminded me what my mother told me, ""If I can't give him a baby someone else will"", I jumped to the conclusion that he was cheating (stupid mistake)

My colleagues rather trying to make me think rationally suggested that if V.J. was screwing around, rather than confronting him I should get even, hurt his ego and emasculate him (never take relationship advice from single female in their late 30s), without thinking afterwork I went to a bar got drunk with them and then ended having sex with a complete stranger, (another stupid mistake), somehow word got out to V.J. and was devastated crying in pain, he didn't say anything and just packed his bag and left, the next few days were blurred, then I was served with divorce paper, my phone started blowing up with messages and call from my family, my mother came over and asked me how I could do this to V.J. after 10 years of loyalty, cheating on him, hooking up with a random stranger, and when I showed her the pictures of V.J. infidelity she just laughed hysterically, and asked me if I showed it V.J. and I said no, she had this look on her face that says she was disappointed in me, and told me that the girl was just fresh out of high school was knocked up her boyfriend, V.J. learned about her through one of the fertility doctor, he got contact with this girl because he wanted to show her that V.J. and I could be great parents to the baby, my mother then took out her phone showed me the profile of the girl Alice (fake name), V.J. wanted to surprise me as the girl was leaning towards the decision that once the baby born she was going to give is the baby, but now it was out of question as V.J. was heartbroken and devastated.

I honestly didn't think for once rationally through this ordeal, how if I could have just talked to him before making a hasty decision, that not only ended our marriage but cost us both a chance of parenthood.

Our divorce went through amicably, without contesting.

A few weeks back, I learned through my family that V.J. had continued to help the girl during her pregnancy, having promised that he wanted to be part of the child's life in some way, when the baby was born it was a boy, the girl even let V.J. be her son's godfather, And V.J. was expecting a child with his new wife Samantha, 29F

It still breaks my heart and kills me, that how I did not once think to talk it out with V.J. maybe just maybe today I would still be married celebrating 15 year wedding anniversary with a 4-year-old boy, but I am not, instead I have become a single white female in her late 30s just like my colleagues....",1,1731829240.0,u_ThrowRa180985,0,1.0,False

1gt8akf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypothyroidism/comments/1gt8akf/just_venting/,Just Venting,"I've had symptoms for the past year or so, but it's gotten really bad these past few months. The worst one is fatigue. I'll sleep 8-9 hours at night but still wake up exhausted, try to resist the urge to sleep in all my classes (and usually fail), then come home and try not to nap. My grades have started dropping horribly. At first I chalked it up to laziness and tried to force myself to just lock in, but it's like I *physically* can't. 

I brought it up with my mom and she suggested it might be hypothyroidism, since many of the women on my dad's side of the family have some sort of thyroid issue and showed symptoms at a similar age as me (I'm 17). I googled it and literally almost every symptom applied to me: Depression that won't go away despite trying every solution under the sun, including my doctor cycling me through a bunch of different psychiatric meds that didn't work, weight gain despite eating under my calorie requirement (literally went from 128 to 150 lbs in a few months), cold all the time, brain fog, physical slowness, heavy periods, patchy body hair, general misery etc. etc. It felt like I finally found what was wrong with me and what to do about it.

So we went to the doctor and he was like ""You need to start eating regular meals and drink less caffeine, that's the problem"". I did exactly that and still felt the same a month later, so I went back. Then he said ""Oh, it's because you cut out the caffeine and your body doesn't know how to handle it, give it time to adjust."" Not to act like I know more than a medical professional, because obviously I don't, but... the issues started like a year ago? Before I cut out the caffeine? And I don't even drink THAT much caffeine, but he seems to think I'm an addict or something. I have maybe two or three coffees per week. I went back again at some point (I don't remember exactly when) and my mom asked him to do bloodwork, suggesting to him that it might be either anemia or hypothyroidism. 

I got the bloodwork done a couple weeks ago, we called, they said everything is fine. No anemia, no thyroid issues. They didn't give specifics, according to my mom, just said that I'm in the clear. 

So idk where to go from here. I really thought I had figured out the root of my problems but nope. Apparently nothing is medically wrong, but I'm miserable. I'm sleeping half the day, it feels like I've lost control over my grades and my weight and my life in general. 

I don't wanna keep pushing a diagnosis that my doctor said I don't have, but is it possible to have hypothyroidism even if the lab results seem fine? I really hate to discredit him but I feel like he isn't taking me seriously. At first my mom was understanding and wanted to get to the bottom of this, but now it feels like she's losing patience and is starting to not take me seriously as well.

Am I a hypochondriac? Is it all psychosomatic? Is this all some elaborately constructed excuse for my laziness? I don't know anymore.

Sorry for the long-winded rant. Idk why I'm posting this. I guess I just wanna know if any of y'all have advice or similar experiences. Any input is much appreciated ",1,1731828216.0,Hypothyroidism,0,1.0,False

This wasn’t drink related but gave me time to dry out and I kept it going because, well, why not?

I haven’t made it out much since I have been feeling very weak after my illness. Went for a coffee with some friends last week but that was it really. I am feeling a bit stronger now and messaged a friend who invited me to a live music night which was close by my flat. She knows I’m not drinking and is honestly an angel when it comes to supporting my choice to abstain. She didn’t drink either even though others we were with did. It means a lot to me because there are certain people who I know I will probably never socialise with again as I’m no longer there to be a drinking buddy, despite it only being such a short period of time. 

I enjoyed a busy bar with a couple of hot chocolates and took myself home early as even a couple of hours took it out of me. Got home, had a camomile tea and took myself off to bed early. 

If you had told me a month ago that this would be an enjoyable Saturday evening for me I would have been baffled, but I had a really good time!

My sleep pattern is still a bit off so I woke up at 4am and kept myself busy by reading and watching travel docs on YouTube. I am a happy camper! Hangover free, happy I got out of the flat and about to have breakfast before a house viewing this morning. 

I would have thought that a night out at a bar would have been my biggest reason to crave a drink this weekend, but my bf wants me to watch I’m A Celeb tonight so I think that is where I’m going to need your positive thoughts sending over my way 😂. 

I know there’s not much point to this post, but I enjoy sharing things in this community, it makes me happy that so many of us are going through similar journeys that can also be so different at the same time.

alsooo, after getting your CPL and 1,500 flight hours how hard is it to get a job at an airline? will it be years before i can find something? i’ve read that it’s very competitive and almost as impossible to get hired at a major airline as it is to get into harvard, so is this career a lost cause? should i just start applying to be a manager at mcdonald’s for the rest of my life. my goal as of right now would be to go to flight school and work for allegiant airline which is partnered with the flight school i want to go to. and maybe in the future move up to a major airline. is it easier to get a job at an airline if its partnered with a flight school?

My MIL lives about 20 minutes from the house and essentially acts as the caretaker of the home while we’re away. When we have furniture or packages delivered, she’s there to bring them in. When we have electricians come by to fix things, she lets them in. She pays the people to maintain the lawn and we’ll pay her back every few months or so. We had a crib and bed frame delivered and she paid her handyman to come and build them and put them in the rooms. For Christmas this year she’s buying us a mattress for the frame. She’s also bought us several flights home to visit, as well as our flights to Asia for our vacation next year, and other gifts throughout the years of my marriage. 

The part that bothers me is that she’s making changes to the house without asking me first. For example, last year, we wanted to spend Christmas at the house, so she put up and decorated a Christmas tree. She rearranged the furniture in the living room so she could put the Christmas tree and pinned tinsel and stockings to our wooden mantle. I was so upset at the holes in my brand new wooden mantle that I had my husband take down the tinsel and stockings. He didn’t want to throw them away so he put them in the garage hoping to reuse them. Before he could put them back up without needles, she saw the decorations in the garage and got sad. 

She brought over this hideous recliner and put in our living room because my father in law can’t sit in our low couches. For context our house is very sparsely furnished because no one is living there full time yet. For example in our living room we only have two big couches and a tv. Not a huge deal, but I have to hide it in another room when we’re in town. Also not a huge deal, we have a Nescafé coffee maker, but she doesn’t like that one or doesn’t have the pods for it so she brought an extra Keurig from her home and put it right next to our Nescafé machine. Again, not a huge deal but ugly.

Recently, however, she did a couple things that really bothered me. She bolted a rack to the wall in my laundry room so we can hang brooms and mops and stuff. It’s in the laundry room behind the door but I don’t like it and would’ve definitely chosen to do something else there. Then the big one. She had two extra bidets that were given to her and she just decided to have them installed into two of the bathrooms. The one in the living room and one of the bedrooms. She didn’t even mention it. I don’t like bidets, they could leak or damage the toilet, and even if I did, what if I wanted them in different bathrooms?

The thing is, I’ve had a conversation with her before about doing things to the house and she should’ve known how I felt. So, I got mad and m had my husband tell her to have them taken out. Shes sensitive, and got upset when he asked her and gave us the silent treatment for a couple days. So I sent her a really long heartfelt apology and we’re good with her again.

The thing is, I get the sentiment. She’s just trying to do nice things for us, but why wouldn’t she at the very least run it by me first? I want to set a very clear boundary with her that she is not to do anything to my house without first running it by me. If this happens again, I don’t think I’ll be able to keep calm again. My husband and I are fighting about this now because, while he acknowledged she was wrong and should’ve discussed with us first, he thinks I’m over reacting in how angry I am. He says these are easy to fix, and thinks I should walk on eggshells around her sensitivities so as not to damage our relationship. After all, we’re moving there and only going to be 20 minutes from her.

In the morning after i’ve eaten, had a coffee and taken my vyvanse, as soon as it kicks in i need to poop. Which is normal! But often i’ll be in a hurry to get out the door and in my mind i simply don’t have time to go to the toilet. So if i’m unable to go when i need to, and i have to wait until hours later, i get this huge anxious feeling in my gut. Not like “i’m scared i’m gonna shit my pants” kind of anxiety but more just a normal anxiety and it can literally only be helped by shitting!

1gt7ss8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifestation/comments/1gt7ss8/yall_need_to_regulate_your_emotions/,Y'all need to regulate your emotions,"I wrote this originally as a reply in another subreddit but I think in the manifestation community we need it desperately.

To all of you who are anxious, impatient, unhappy, reactive, I got you. And I've been there too. I went from anxious to happy almost all the time. I smile constantly, I wake up with a smile, I fell asleep with a smile. Not because my manifestations come true. But because I AM.

I went from unhappy and pessimistic, Murphy's law believer, anxious, with many more bad days than good days to a peaceful person who no longer has bad days - merely ""bad"" hours that turn into a nice day in the end. 

There's no conscious manifesting until you regulate your nervous system. Emotional regulation is one of these things that you didn't think you need until you started manifesting. Next to self-love and self realisation that you are, indeed, all there is.

EMOTIONS ARE MEANT TO FLOW FREELY THROUGH US. And the happy ones do: they come up, we feel them without analysing why they are here or blaming others. We just feel them. But we don't handle the negative emotions in the same way. We look for causes, we analyse, we blame others or our circumstances. All that is wrong because it only deals with the symptoms and not the root cause which IS YOU. You are the projector, 3D is the screen. You don't change the screen if you don't like the movie. You change the projector settings instead.

HOW DO I REGULATE MY EMOTIONS?

With the letting go method. Here's what you do.

1. When emotions come, you don't suppress or repress them. Let them come in. Identify them. Name them. There might be many at once so deal with one at the time. If you start feeling like it's uncomfortable or stupid, this is the resistance, which is another emotion on top of emotions. Don't resist the resistance. Name it, embrace it. Locate your emotions in your body. Where do you feel them? Your chest? Jaw? Shoulders? Belly? Emotions manifest in our bodies.

2. Sit with the emotion for as long as you feel it. Focus on the emotion itself and feeling it. Ignore the causes, stop analysing who or what caused it, stop blaming others. Shift the focus fully to your inner world. Just feel. Cry if you must. Don't suppress anything. Accept it. Don't try to change the experience in any way or judge anything. Be there for yourself.

3. Let go if the emotion(s). Just move your attention to something else. Feel the relief. Feel the lightness. It's gone for now. You did well ❤️‍🩹 

4. Ask yourself, what can I do to make myself feel better now? And then just do it. A nap, a walk, a coffee to go, visualisation session in meditation of your wish fulfilled. Whatever it is. Do it.

Doing it once won't be very effective. You must do it every time a negative emotion comes up. It will take you 10-20 minutes at the time each time. But if you continue this way, they will eventually run out. Each time weaker in their strength until you no longer react to them. Suppressed emotions can linger in your body for years. 

WHAT WE FOCUS ON GROWS. So, when you feel emotions and you focus on the external, this is what will grow - more of the triggers and reactions you had so far. But if you focus on yourself, feeling, dealing with everything at the source (which is you), this ability to handle all that comes your way without strong reaction will grow. Where do you spend your time the most I such situation? Your time = Your energy = Your focus = Your power. Don't give it away so easily.

LOVE YOURSELF ENOUGH TO DO THIS

SEVENTY TIMES SEVEN

When you release the emotion, the thoughts and states that are undesirable are released too. Don't do it the other way around because it won't work. The quality of thoughts follow the states, not the other way around. Emotions that linger in your body block your full expression of love, abundance, fulfilment, bliss - which is your true nature and flows freely if we remove the blocks. Blocks that are the unprocessed emotions, often in our bodies for years if not decades.

Todo list for all of you who want peace:
+ Identify your limiting beliefs. Ask chat gpt for journaling promots that will aid this process.
+ Meditate twice a day for ay least 15 minutes. Preferably IAM meditation or self-enquiry.
+ Focus on yourself unapologetically for a while. Make your meditation and emotional regulation NON-NEGOTIABLE.
+ Observe yourself throughout the day. What's your dominating state of dwelling? Where do you focus your attention in? Self-observation IS KEY. Know yourself.
+ Dwell as awareness, rest as awareness whenever you can. In meditation, when you wait for something, throughout the day. BE STILL AND KNOW THAT I AM GOD. Repeat to yourself: I am. I am. I am. Feel it. Be the impartial observer of the thoughts, emotions, sensations and perceptions - all of this changes. The I am does not.

And if u want more updated thats been happing please let me know

I’ve been working since I was five in my family’s business—pizza bars and cafes. When I was younger, I lived in Melbourne for about 10 years, moving around a lot until my mum bought a pizza bar and turned it into a daytime café. That’s when everything changed for me. I was still in school, but my mum needed help opening the cafe at 6 a.m. and running it until school started at 8 a.m. My school was only a 2-minute walk away, so I’d help her out in the mornings and then go to school. The cafe also had a 3-bedroom apartment attached, so that’s where we lived. The area was Oakleigh, if anyone’s familiar with it.

Here’s where it gets tough: I thought that when my mum bought the cafe, I’d still be able to just go to school and have a normal life, but I was wrong. I had to wake up early, help out with the cafe, go to school, and then go back to the cafe to close it and help open the pizza bar until 11 p.m. every night, 7 days a week. I didn’t mind at first because it was family, but I started feeling drained, and I wasn’t really able to focus on school.

During that time, I tried to fit in with my schoolmates, so I’d bring coffee and food to school from the cafe. I thought I was being a good friend, but in hindsight, I realize they weren’t real friends. They would ask me to bring them sandwiches or hot chocolate in the morning, and I did it because I thought that’s just what friends do. But looking back, I was just taken advantage of.

Then, when COVID hit, things got even worse. My mum decided to sell the cafe, and I found a job at a bowling alley. That job ended up being a saving grace for me. I found a sense of independence and started feeling like myself again. I worked there from the age of 14 and eventually made it to bowling technician, shift manager, and opening manager. But there was one problem—my mum got a job there too, and she didn’t like that I was succeeding. It felt like I could never escape the pressure of working with her.

Eventually, we moved to the Gold Coast, and I was heartbroken. I didn’t want to leave Melbourne. I had finally made friends and felt like I belonged somewhere, and now that’s all gone. I’m struggling with this new life here, and it’s hard to adjust.

I’m really just at a loss for what to do. I’ve been working since I was so young, and I feel like I’ve missed out on a lot of the usual teenage experiences.

I take zinc daily and know it can deplete copper, so I’ve been supplementing with 2 mg of copper twice a week to help balance it out. However, I recently realized I hadn’t taken my copper in a couple of weeks and had been feeling fatigued and low-energy during that time.

This afternoon, I took 2 mg of copper, and within a couple of hours, I felt noticeably less fatigued—even skipped my evening coffee without thinking about it, which never happens. I wasn’t expecting anything dramatic since I’d been taking it more as a precaution before.

Could this energy boost actually be related to the copper, or is it likely just a coincidence? Has anyone else experienced something similar with copper supplementation?

Since 2 mg is within safe daily limits, I’m wondering if I should start taking it daily to see if my energy levels improve further.

So I had no way of knowing which alternative milk option this customer wanted and didn’t just want to mix a random milk in the the espresso and syrup incase this customer had almond, soy or oat allergies ( those are our other lactose free milk options) . I decided to give the customer the espresso mixed with ice and syrup in a large cup and put oat and soy milk in two other separate cups so they could choose which milk they wanted. I stuck plain sticky paper on the oat and soy milk using bright red pen to clearly label one was soy and the other was oat. On the cup with the espresso and syrup I did the same thing and wrote so sorry we’re out of lactose free milk I have put your espresso and syrup separate and provided two alternative milk options. The deluxe coffees come with whipped cream so I also put that separately in a small espresso cup with a spoon: in the moment I thought I was doing the right thing, even if the customer couldn’t drink oat or soy milk, I assumed most people have milk at home and they could just pour there own allergy safe milk into the syrup, ice and espresso base. However this customer didn’t think so. A few hours after I finished work I decided to check the Google reviews for the store ( I like to check the reviews Becuase most of them are stupid and quite hilarious, one time we had someone complain about the public bathrooms outside the store thinking they were ours, lmao) my heart sank when I saw a customer review for the order I had made earlier stating they had an allergic reaction and medical emergency. I’m assuming it’s Becuase of the coffee as everything else with their order was correct. They posted a photo of the drinks however did not show the notes I wrote them or the fact I actually had the milk completely separate to the espresso incase they were allergic to oat or soy. So AITA ? I’m really worried and anxious they might complain to the store and I could get fired.
I genuinely thought I was doing the right thing, I know it’s frustrating when you order something and don’t get it. So I thought providing them with tow alternative milk options and giving them to opportunity to be able to use there own milk at home was better then not getting the drink at all.

The jist
2024 Aug A trip to ER resulted with type 2 a1c 13.x

2024 Oct. A1c down to 5.7


3month regiment

Exercise- not a whole lot I tried to walk around 5000 to 6000 steps which is about 40 min walking for me. At least 2-3times a week but I didn't keep a rigorous schedule for exercising since I was still recovering from the surgery.


Food - my base for all meals are 150g to 200g of leaf salad Romain lettuce or similar. On top of it it either add some sort of meat(chicken fish beef bobs your uncle) + some cheese(just avoid the fake parmesan padded with carbs)

Snacks- zero sugar snacks here and there. My trick was limit carb intake during meals and minimize carb intake by snacks. Surprisingly slim Jim is better choice than most.

Beverages- I've read somewhere a bit of coffee in the morning can help manage your blood sugar but I hate coffee. So I started to make a colacinno(coffee flavored coke) using zero Pepsi and some cold brew + dash of cinnamon. This drink really helps me manage my cravings for sweets and junk food. I known it sounds weird but try it. 

Originally I was taking 4 shots of insulin perday 2 in the morning and one each after lunch and dinner. 

I am now down to one shot of insulin in the morning and a pill after breakfast and lunch after my Nov checkup.

Recent changes I've made to my diet-
I now eat a heartier breakfast and dinner and skip lunch. I wanted to see how increasing the amount of food I take per meal  while reducing the number of meals effects my blood sugar. So far cgm and price test tells me it's about the same but I think it also hasn't  been long enough to really have an impact. 

Another reason  I made this change was I want to use my lunch time to exercise instead of eating cuz I feel like it's when I would be most willing to actually follow through.

So will report back on the effects of the changes a few months down the road. 
 I am also getting back to working so I will be flying around the globe again soon hope to see how that will effect my blood sugar!!!

1gt7cjp,https://i.redd.it/nb342f1dme1e1.png,"Overcharged beyond MRP, refused bill, and questionable GST Application","On July 10, I visited an establishment operating under two names: Shri Dhivyam (Sweet & Snacks) on the ground floor and Ariya Bhavan on the first floor. Initially, I purchased a 1L Bisleri water bottle on the ground floor. They charged me ₹21, even though the MRP displayed was ₹20. When I questioned the price, they insisted on charging the higher amount. I paid via UPI (and have proof of this transaction), but they refused to provide a bill.

To gather further evidence and see if they would issue a bill under different circumstances, I dined in on the first floor at Ariya Bhavan. I ordered a coffee and another 1L Bisleri. 

This time, they provided a bill that included both items, priced at ₹35 for the coffee and ₹20 for the water bottle, totaling ₹55. However, GST was applied to the combined amount, adding an additional ₹2.76 in taxes, which brought the final bill to ₹58.

Is this legal? I came across some articles mentioning that in 2017, a Supreme Court bench allowed hotels and restaurants to sell packaged water and food items above MRP under the reasoning that these include value-added services like ambience and cutlery. However, in this case:

- On the ground floor, no such value-added service was provided, As I simply bought the water bottle and walked out, so the additional charge of ₹1 doesn't make sense.

- On the first floor, even though a bill was provided, adding GST to the combined total doesn’t seem correct.

Questions: 

Does the bill I received comply with the Supreme Court's 2017 ruling allowing restaurants to sell items over MRP, or does it constitute a violation?

Is it valid to apply GST on the combined total of items (including the water bottle) as was done in my case?

How should establishments properly reflect ""over-MRP"" pricing in their billing?

ps: I have the time and energy to pursue this matter further.

And it’s a good amount of pee coming out, I sit down for 12hrs a day at work but I am in very good shape but does sitting down for a while cause flares? Also what could possibly help with just calming the bladder down cause people will say “use pain relief” NO my bladder will keep filling up with pee, I was wondering is there anything that CALMS down a irritated bladder ?? Cause pain relief won’t help, I also got my bladder stretched after finding out I had ic and it helped a lot.

I have a few friends here, but they’re usually pretty busy, and honestly, I could use some more company. I’ll admit, I’m not the best at socializing, I've always been the awkward type and not great at interacting with strangers.

That said, I’d love to change that (or at least try). If you’re up for some casual chitchat, maybe over coffee or a walk, let me know. If you’re into books, even better—we could bring some and just read together or talk about what we’re reading.

No pressure, just looking to meet some new faces and maybe expand my little circle :)) and it's sunday pa basin diay.",8,1731824039.0,dumaguete,7,1.0,False
