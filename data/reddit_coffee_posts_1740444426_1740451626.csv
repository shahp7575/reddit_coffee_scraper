On Week 8..,"Hi, hoping to hear your thoughts and see if any of you went through something similar. Concerns in ***bold italics*** if tl;dr. Me: female, 35, 5'3"", SW: 176lbs. CW: 168lbs. Using Mochi. Rotating injection sites (arm, L/R side of stomach, L/R thigh). I drink 80-128 ounces of water a day, take pepcid daily for indigestion (prior to glp-1). Prioritizing protein but not very hungry.

**First 4 Weeks:** .25mg each week. Minimal symptoms but feel it working. No large drop in weight (4-6 pounds, fluctuating).

**Week 5:** Had not received a refill yet, so I injected what was left of my vial (enough to equal 15 mg dose), not sure why, seemed like a good idea at the time. ***Bad idea? Did this affect my body's tolerance?*** 

**Week 6:** Provider moved me up to .44mg.  
**Thu 2/6.** first dose. A little nausea, was fine.   
**Tue 2/11** 5 days later, wake up with frequent diarrhea, but feel OK (the day prior I had fairlife 30g P shake, grilled chicken w/ baked potato for lunch and dinner. I did have a $1 pack of nerds gummy clusters). Lasts until Sat 2/15, even w/ taking immodium. Having yucky burps which I think may be the sulfur burps people mention?  
  
**Week 7: Sun 2/16** \- delayed injection 3 days to match w/ days off. Eat two beef franks (no bun) for dinner at 8p. Injection closer to 10pm.  
**Mon 2/17** 4am wake up w/ indigestion/heartburn at 4am. Take tums and pepto pills. 6am I vomit undigested dinner, continue to vomit until 930am until nothing left, diarrhea is back. I lay down til 2p, drink 4-8oz water, more vomiting, switch to ice chips. I go to urgent care and am given zofran, no more vomiting for the night  
**Tues 2/18.** Vomit/diarrhea in AM, take zofran and its gone, and those symptoms go away for good. But not hungry, barely eat, fearfully not drinking much rest of the week. Overall just weak from all the things.  
**Sat 2/22** I realized that the feeling of discomfort I had was bc I hadn't gone in days.  
  
**Week 8 Sun 2/23** still constipated, meds are doing a little something but not much. ***Did not want to take my dose last night  to make that worse or potentially have a repeat of vomiting when I have work Monday-Thurs.***  
***Mon 2/24*** we are back to being regular thank god, not very hungry though (water, 8 oz coffee, ham, sweet potatoes, serving of cottage cheese, fiber supp).

I work in the ER, stomach flu is rampant, so my mochi provider and urgent care were thinking based on the symptoms starting in between doses, it may not be GLP-1 related. Encouraged to take next dose as long as symptoms subside. ***Anyone have a similar experience to mine with GLP-1? I'm not sure if I think this is stomach flu or big wave of side effects.***  
  
***If you have experienced any of this, do you think I should consider going back down to previous dose for a few more weeks, or try an in between, like .35mg? Or would it be better to split the dose as my body adjusts? I've seen tips on zofran pre-injection, sleep, and zofran in AM, has this or something like it worked for you?

I loooooooooove coffee and have always dreamed of having a nice espresso machine. I prefer americanos, lattes, flat whites and regular drip coffee compared to straight up espresso so I don’t need my espresso to be perfect, though I do want it to make cafe quality drinks. I love the taste of light-medium roasts from local roasters. I am planning to buy a machine (budget up to $1500) within the next 6 months and had my mind set on the barista touch impress as on paper it seems to be perfect for me: I don’t want to have to deal with weighing out my coffee beans for every single drink, it has an upgraded grinder compared to the older brevilles, and it has settings for steaming different milk types. I also like the aesthetic of the machine. But after spending a few hours on here reading the reviews of the machine I am wondering if it would be worth it… 

So I guess my question is, to those who have this machine, do you like it? Does it make good espresso consistently? I don’t mind having to dial in with each new bag of beans, but having to change settings each time I pull a shot would be frustrating. I’m looking for something I can just wake up and use and produce a drink that tastes like I bought it at a coffee shop. 

Is there anything that’s a comparable price that has a built in grinder but has better reviews? I like the idea of being able to put my beans atop and have the machine deal with (most of) the rest. Or if I got something like the bambino plus + a grinder, is there a grinder out there that will dose for you? I’m really just trying to avoid having to weigh out my beans with a scale lol

The doctor in fast track ended up performing the lumbar puncture and it was incredibly painful. He had to stick me twice with the needle before being successful and did not use any freezing. It was so painful the first time he went in I almost passed out from the pain and it was like a pain I've never felt before. Afterwards he told us it would be about an hour before we had results and we could go get a coffee if we wanted to leave for a bit. I had to beg for a bed just so I had a place to lay down for a bit I was in so much discomfort. It seemed like this doctor had no idea what he was doing. 

Fast forward to today and whenever I'm standing upright I am getting a swelling headache that only goes away if I lay down. My entire lower body is incredibly sore from the puncture site down and I'm not sure how much longer I can tolerate the headache.

No more long commutes, office distractions, or awkward small talk at the water cooler. Instead, I get to design my own workspace, manage my time effectively, and actually enjoy my coffee while it’s still hot. ☕🔥

Of course, it has its challenges (hello, never-ending Zoom calls! 🫠), but the **work-life balance** and **productivity boost** make it all worth it. Who else loves remote work? Let’s share tips and experiences! 🚀

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

We had a ton in common and the conversation kept going and going. We made each other laugh a lot. He paid for our coffees and some snacks from the cafe. He mentioned an event we could go to. At the end, we hugged goodbye. 

After we parted ways, he texted me within MINUTES to follow up on something from our conversation earlier 😭 And then we just kept texting the rest of the night! When I got home I sent him a selfie and he was really enthusiastic and told me I was super cute. I was really excited about the connection. 

The next day we texted again throughout the day and had good conversation. But then, in the evening, suddenly, he stopped replying in the middle of the convo. I figured he had to get ready for bed. And, to be fair, the night before, I was the one to stop the convo, and I didn't tell him I was going to sleep. 

But now it's been over 24 hours and still no response from him :( It's weird because we were right in the MIDDLE of talking, like I was getting replies from him less than 5 min apart. And then all of a sudden, poof. And it's not like my last message was something that could be a possible conversation ender. 

UGH. IDK. I know the answer - keep talking to other guys and don't focus so much on just one. But I was so excited! I'm really bummed. Can't help but overthink and wonder whyyyyyy he stopped replying and wondering if it's something I did/said. Out of respect for myself I'm resisting the urge to text him again. My last message is very clearly one that is open for a response. 

Ugh. Help - how long should I give this until I accept the loss? Like, I'm trying to continue talking to other people but I keep hoping this guy gets back to me 😩 It's distracting. I feel like I should see it as a loss already because I feel like he would have responded by now if he was interested enough. ",1,1740450851.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I saw this image floating around on Reddit and thought it would be a great set up for a novel. The basic idea is that it takes place in a Warhammer 40k Parody universe. MC gets sent off to war with his long time girlfriend and are lucky to be placed in the same unit.

After going from war zone to war zone they like to enjoy each other's company when they can get time alone. One day  his unit saves the Commissar that thought that would be her last battle before joining the Emperor and her one regret was never finding love. She is helped up off the ground by the MC and she starts to develop an affection for the young man. She starts by placing his unit in the safe areas away from combat and giving him little gifts like extra ration bars or hot recaf (coffee). She then gives him jobs that would result in him being alone with her, eventually to her personal bed chambers to try and seduce him.

After a few months of this, The commissar is called away for an emergency as they are under attack by the Drukhari (Dark Space Elf). She orders him to stay for safety but after a while a Drukhari breaks in with the mission to kidnap the commissar. being unable to find her, she settles for the MC. He keeps resisting her and she likes when he puts up a fight but so much so, she wont let anyone else hurt him. Eventually falling in love with him.

The Commissar mounts a rescue mission to save him and is taken to safety by his girlfriend and they capture the female drukhari. she speaking High Gothic (Human Language) demands to see the man she loves but keeps getting told no. He goes between seeing his girlfriend and the commissar for weeks cause they were afraid they lost him. One day they are attacked by Chaos space marines of the Emperor's Children and they are on the hunt for the Drukhari. Whole prison break and the 3 end up finding the MC . When escaping into the warp the commissar kisses the MC in front of the other 2 and a fight was about to ensue until MC tells them to stop and they need to focus on getting their base back from Chaos. The rest of the story is just missions to gain resources and allies while having cut aways of intimacy with his harem of bad ass ladies.",2,1740450831.0,haremfantasynovels,0,1.0,False
1ixkcz1,https://i.redd.it/n50rqv6w57le1.jpeg,Picked up the Cup One today…,"My first impression of the Cup One: it’s good but not great like its big brother, KBGV Select. I got a killer deal on an open box Cup One or I would’ve just stuck with my AeroPress for single cup brews. Though, after my first couple brews on the Cup One I’m glad I still have my AeroPress. 

I’m sure I can get a better cup after I get it dialed in. I’ll play around with grind size and ratios some. I don’t like the idea of agitating the grounds with an automatic coffee maker. It defeats the purpose in my opinion and certainly doesn’t justify the limited coffee bar space available. Also not super hip to increasing my brew ratio beyond 16:1 as that just seems wasteful. My first two brews were 250ml to 15g. Both were a tad watery. I tried a slightly smaller grind size on the second cup but not sure it was a big enough adjustment to have any real impact. Grounds are blooming nicely but I’m not seeing the immersion I am used to with my KBGV. In the Cup One the grounds bloom, continue to swell and then tunnel severely. Cup didn’t necessarily taste sour or bitter just weak.

This is not exhaustive--it's made up of companies/businesses/services I've used or admire. (I also repeatedly plug local libraries because they are amazing and also important to support!). Some other disclaimers/notes appear at the end of the post. 

**Media**

* [Find a local, indie bookstore](https://www.indiebookstores.ca/bookstores/): If you don't have a great indie bookstore in your town, then buy from a nearby store that will ship to you. Buying books from Amazon and Indigo is simply no good for authors, illustrators, and the book industry more broadly. 
   * **And don't forget to hit up your local library for books, magazines, newspapers, and ebooks.**
* [Kobo](https://www.kobo.com/): a Canadian company, but a subsidiary of Rakuten (a Japanese e-commerce company). In addition to their own books, Kobo ereaders are compatible with library ebooks. 
* For online and print journalism, my favourite Canadian picks are the [CBC](https://www.cbc.ca/), [The Walrus](https://thewalrus.ca/), the Canadian edition of [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/ca/), [National Observer](https://www.nationalobserver.com/), [Ricochet](https://ricochet.media/), [Breach](https://breachmedia.ca/), [The Line](https://www.readtheline.ca/), [The Maple](https://www.readthemaple.com/), and [Rabble](https://rabble.ca/). Not Canadian, but I also like [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/international) and the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/).       
* One of the hardest shifts I've had to make recently is to change my streaming behaviour. I love TV and movies and subscribed to several US streamers. I got rid of all of them, although I still use YouTube. I retained [BritBox](https://www.britbox.com/ca?) and also use [CBC Gem](https://gem.cbc.ca/) (save the CBC!). 
   * **I have access to Hoopla and Kanopy through my library (and you probably do, too!). They are streaming services with some contemporary, classic, and indie gems (you don't have unlimited viewing, but your library will give you a certain number of credits).**  

**Department Stores:**

* [Simons](https://m.simons.ca/en): The last great Canadian department store (this article from [The Walrus](https://thewalrus.ca/simons-shop/) has more on it). Mainly clothing, shoes, and accessories, but also some home goods.    
* [Well](https://well.ca/) (honourable mention to [Terra20](https://terra20.com/)): online-only shopping that carries **lots** of Canadian brands (and you can use their search filter to find them). Cosmetics, personal care, household goods, cleaning supplies, some food and drink, some clothes/toys, gift ideas, and so on. 
   * Some of my Canadian faves include: [Guelph Soap Company](https://well.ca/brand/guelph-soap-company.html), [The Unscented Company](https://well.ca/brand/the-unscented-company.html), [Amoda](https://well.ca/brand/amoda.html), [Green Beaver](https://well.ca/brand/green-beaver.html) (I use their castile soap as an alternative to Dr. Bronner's), [Penny Lane Organics](https://well.ca/brand/penny-lane-organics.html), [Anita's Organic Mill](https://well.ca/brand/anitas-organic-mill-2.html) (alternative to Bob's Red Mill), [Living Libations](https://well.ca/brand/living-libations.html), [Three Ships Beauty](https://well.ca/brand/three-ships.html), [Rocky Mountain Soap Co](https://well.ca/brand/rocky-mountain-soap-company.html).   
   * Also, they're not on Well, but [AG](https://ag.care/) is an awesome Canadian-made haircare company (and they have a 25% off sale going on **now**). 

**Hardware and Gardening**: 

* [Lee Valley](https://www.leevalley.com/en-ca?): Doesn't have **all** the odds and sods that you need from a hardware store, but they sell tools, hardware, and home and gardening supplies. Note that this post has a good rundown of [Canadian hardware stores](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyCanadian/comments/n1ikbo/a_quick_run_down_of_hardware_stores_which_are/). 
* [Home Hardware](https://www.homehardware.ca/en/): many products aren't made in Canada, but it is Canadian-owned, in a lot of communities, and a good alternative to companies like Home Depot, Rona, etc. 
* [West Coast Seeds](https://www.westcoastseeds.com/): my go-to company for seeds (they have lots of options for colder growing zones). 
   * **A reminder that local libraries may have makerspaces, free tool rentals, free seed libraries, and other resources that are no- or low-cost for you.** 

**Outdoor Gear**:

I used to be a big fan of MEC, but since they dropped the co-op and sold to a US private equity firm, I've shifted my business elsewhere. 

* I found that I could replace MEC with three Canadian-owned stores: 1) [Valhalla Pure](https://vpo.ca/), 2) [Altitude Sports](https://www.altitude-sports.com/), and 3) [Sail](https://www.sail.ca/). They all carry some Canadian-made goods.   
* [Surf Ontario](https://surfontario.ca/): wetsuits, rashguards, SUPs, surfboards, and related accessories
* [Frontenac Outfitters](https://www.frontenacoutfitters.com/): canoes, kayaks, SUPs, camping gear, and related accessories
* [Field and Forest](https://fieldandforest.co/shop): small and niche bag shop (e.g., totes, bike bags, etc.). There are only a handful of things in their shop, but they are all Canadian-made. 

**Clothing, Shoes, and Accessories**: 

* [Anian](https://anianmfg.com/): Canadian-made investment pieces that last forever. I own multiple wool coats and wear them year-round. (You can also catch periodic sales).  
* [Yoga Jeans](https://yogajeans.ca/): Denim shop, including a wide selection of items that are Canadian-made. 
* [Little Blue House](https://hatley.com/pages/little-blue-house): Canadian company that sells pjs. I have two pairs (note that they are made in India, at least the ones I have are.).

* [Maguire](https://maguireshoes.com/): Indie, women- and Canadian-owned footwear store
* [Nice Shoes](https://niceshoes.ca/): Canadian-owned vegan footwear store 
* [SteMargScot](https://stemargscot.com/): Ontario-made wool coats. I don't own one of these as they are an investment piece (for me, anyway!), but I admire the company (and dream of this [natural wool duster with heart patches](https://stemargscot.com/product/pure-canadian-wool-duster/)). 
* [Mellow Walk/Oliberte](https://www.mellowwalk.com/): made-in-Canada boots, including safety shoes/boots. (They also manufacture and sell disposable masks). 
* [Thesus](https://thesusoutdoors.com/): [These boots](https://thesusoutdoors.com/products/the-weekend-boot-new-classic-brown) replaced my Blundstones. Love them. Canadian-owned but manufactured elsewhere adhering to responsible manufacturing standards. 
* [Grounded People](https://groundedpeople.ca/): I replaced my Chuck Taylors with [these sneakers](https://groundedpeople.ca/products/campinas) from this Canadian-owned company. 
* [Vessi](https://ca.vessi.com/): My husband and I got waterproof shoes from Vessi for walking our dogs in the rain. Especially useful for autumn/spring in Ontario, but wearable all the time. [These sneakers](https://ca.vessi.com/products/womens-cityscape-classic-storm-black-on-black) were a good replacement for my AllBirds.
* [Province of Canada](https://provinceofcanada.com/): Made-in-Canada wardrobe staples and comfy clothes. I had sticker shock after being used to Old Navy, but the tees fit, wash, and age really well. (See also: [Good for Sunday](https://goodforsunday.com/))   
* [Kotn](https://kotn.com/): Canadian B-corp with modern wardrobe staples and some home goods (we have one of [these quilts](https://kotn.com/products/quilted-comforter?colour=natural&size=o-s) and it's so weighty and wonderful).   
* [Boutique Unicorn](https://www.boutiqueunicorn.com/): shop carrying Quebec- and Canadian-made fashion/accessories for women
* [Noize](https://noize.com/): Canadian-owned vegan outerwear for men, women, and dogs  
* [Ande](https://andethestore.com/): Stratford-based shop for clothing, home goods, and some personal products  
* [Bare Knitwear](https://www.bareknitwear.ca/): gorgeous (and yes, expensive) knitwear. I covet these pieces although I don't own one yet!  
* [Moss Grey](https://mossgrey.ca/): Made-in-Canada linen clothing  
* [Petit Montagnard](https://petitmontagnard.ca/): fun, patterned outdoor gear for adults and children.   
* [Maker House Company](https://makerhouse.com/pages/meet-the-makers): Ottawa shop selling over 3,000 Canadian-made items from [various makers](https://makerhouse.com/pages/meet-the-makers?). I've never shopped here, but I should.   
* [Strathcona Stockings](https://www.strathconastockings.com/shop): socks, stockings, and silk sleep masks/clothing made in Canada  
* [Canada West Boots](https://www.canadawestboots.com/): family-owned, Canadian-made boot company. I don't own a pair but [these boots](https://www.canadawestboots.com/romeosladies) would be a good Blundstone substitute.

* [Betina Lou](https://www.betinalou.com/): Canadian-owned boutique. Includes the option to filter for [Quebec-made](https://www.betinalou.com/fc/selections/fait-au-quebec/) and [Canadian-made](https://www.betinalou.com/fc/selections/fait-au-canada/) items.

* [Made You Look](https://www.madeyoulook.ca/): Indie jewellery store featuring Toronto area makers.

**Home Goods**: 

* Kijiji and thrifting are my first line, particularly for wooden furniture, but I've recently branched into Made-in-Canada furniture stores, like [Norka Living](https://norkaliving.com/) and [Kavuus](https://www.kavuus.com/). **I'd love more recommendations on Canadian-made furniture**.   
* [Good Stuff Pots](https://www.instagram.com/good.stuff.pots/): Hamilton-based ceramicist.

* [Baa Baazaar](https://baabaazaar.com/): a favourite quirky Toronto-based shop for purchasing gifts.

* [Elise McLauchlan](https://www.mclauchlanmade.com/): Made-in-Canada hand turned wooden goods  

**Food**: 

I shop local using farmer's markets, local butchers, local farms, etc., and choose **independent** grocers/restaurants/coffee shops when I can (I recognize this is easier when you're in a larger city.). My go-to drive-thru on road trips is, of course, A&W. 

**Travel**: 

* [I no longer use Airbnb](https://www.newsweek.com/airbnb-boycott-calls-joe-gebbia-elon-musk-doge-2033847). I was already starting to fade on it because of the high prices and uneven quality, but recent news prompted me to close my account. When I travel, I look for independent hotels, inns, and cottages where I can book directly.
* [The Germain group](https://www.germainhotels.com/en) is a Canadian-owned hotel chain in major cities across Canada. They're my go-to and I've stayed in multiple properties (and they're dog-friendly)
* I don't use third-party US apps, like Expedia, but I still use my credit cards to earn points and look for hotel- and airline-specific deals and discounts. 
* I do a lot of camping in provincial and national parks. 
   * **A reminder that many local libraries have things like parks passes and camping gear that you can borrow for free! (Also gallery/museum passes and other tourism-related things).** 

**Disclaimers**:

* Many of the above retailers sell goods that aren't **made** in Canada. Check the details to ensure you're supporting supply chains that align with your values. 
* It's more expensive to shop Canadian-made goods than it is to buy shit from Shein or from shit retailers like Amazon. It's also more expensive to buy from smaller shops who can't afford to stock warehouses full of goods to capitalize on bulk pricing. 
   * **Bottom line**: buying more local may require a shift in buying habits more broadly (and that's probably a good thing). 
* I used to try to support Canadian makers via Etsy, but I've lost interest in the platform as it has grown and changed. I now look for Canadian makers (e.g., through farmers markets, local shops, and artist directories) and support them directly. 
* Just because a shop is Canadian doesn't mean it necessarily follows ethical practices. You can check directories for more information (e.g., [Good on You](https://directory.goodonyou.eco/)), review company policies on their websites, or email them directly for clarity. 
* When I give gifts, I like to get items or gift cards from the retailers above to encourage friends and family to shop more locally. 
* **Shout out to Quebec for being leaders in Canadian apparel and shoe design/manufacturing**. 

**Please share any corrections to my information! This is based on my own research and I appreciate feedback on errors relating to business ownership/practices.** ",4,1740450685.0,BuyCanadian,2,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

So tbfh this isnt really trans related, but I've always felt like I had support from this community, and right now I need support! I've been struggling with anorexia or years, about 7 months ago finally managed to win against laxative abuse. I got...super backed up recently and stupidly took a small dose that helped, and then IMMEDIATELY got rebound constipation. I'm not fat, I don't look it. But this makes me hyper aware of my stomach and it's SO uncomfortable. I don't know how to fix it. I was pooping three times a day, and then this! It stresses me out to the point I want to scream. Does anyone have any advice? I just want to sh*t fucking normally like oh my gosh. 

*Side note: Another reason I ask here is that I know it's not necessarily uncommon for trans men to have suffered from anorexia. I am unfortunately very thin, about 166cm and 46kg the last time I was weighed, and appear to have lost weight since then. I am also an adult, not a teen. I've been told I'd look more masculine and less emo if I had more weight by multiple old ladies 😂😂😂

* Extra Side note: I live in Japan. Finding prune juice etc can be a little....difficult. Like it's around, but my local grocer only ever has grape lmao. I've tried yakult, staying hydrated, coffee, etc but no dice. I exercise, I usually walk at least 6000 steps per day as a min, work a fairly physical job whilst studying as well. Also, if any other trans bros in Japan wanna chat, let me know! It's a prettty quiet scene where I am...I miss the community sometimes.",1,1740450572.0,FTMMen,0,1.0,False

1ixk8l2,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidepressants/comments/1ixk8l2/ordered_a_genesight_test_today_because_my/,Ordered a genesight test today because my psychiatrist doesn’t want to adjust my meds any more until I get this report,"I made a post a few days ago talking about my current issues on the medications I’m on. I’ll summarize here as best as I can. 

So I’m on buproprion Xl 300mg and Amitryptiline 25mg for ocd and anxiety. I’ve been on Wellbutrin for the past 6 years but have changed my dosage a few times to see what works best. I’ve been on Amitryptiline for almost 3 years. 

I’ve tried tons of SSRIs in the past and I did not react well to them, same with other meds like Effexor that was the worst for me. I’ve reacted the best to tryciclic antidepressants, I was on clomipramine too but eventually thought it lost its effectiveness. 

For a while 300mg of buproprion did the trick for me, and helped negate the side effects of my ocd medication (tryciclic antidepressant) but recently I’ve been so tired during the day. You know it’s bad when coffee doesn’t even wake me up anymore, it’s 9am and I had a coffee an hour ago and I’m still tired so by 12pm I usually have an energy drink. I thought maybe decreasing my ocd medication would help with how tired I am, two months ago I went down in dosage a bit after meeting with my psychiatrist (37.5mg to 25mg) but it didn’t do anything for me energy wise. I get 7-8 hours of sleep a night so I’m getting a healthy amount. I work a day job where I commute there and back, I don’t have an issue feeling like falling asleep at my desk or anything I just am always tired. I also am very active and workout 6x a week, I notice at the end of the day like 5pm I have some more energy than I do during the day so that’s when I go to the gym and get a good workout in. I guess the endorphins get me going. I also used to take for a bit adderall but it was more of a quick fix from my psychiatrist and I don’t think I want to go down that path again. 

I’ve also had issues recently with my appetite/cravings being out of control and in the past year gained like 10 pounds (I’m a petite woman). Also I wanted to mention I do not binge eat at all, i just catch myself wanting to eat more snacks than usual. I probably eat about a few hundred more calories than I used to. The constant weight gain is really messing with my head as my OCD has transitioned to fixating on this. I’m obsessed with looking at my body and seeing if I’ve gotten less bloated, skinnier, bigger etc. it’s never been this bad in my life because I used to be 120 pounds for a few years and I’m 138 now. I’m very muscular because of my weightlifting but still feel puffy and overall just big, people say I look great but I don’t feel great. If my clothes fit better and I was a little lighter I know k would feel so much better an have a fear I’m going to keep on gaining weight. Since late 2023 I have not seen my weight drop. 

My life is great, I have a great job family and boyfriend and the only thing I’ve been worrying about is my damn weight and being tired. It sucks. I’ve made some really amazing progress in 2024 too, I got a car after having severe driving anxiety and have been driving great. 

I met with my psychiatrist today and we have already ruled out that my bloodwork is normal, I got bloodwork drawn in November of 2024. I have another appointment in about a month to get blood work again so that’s good. 

My psychiatrist also wants me to do two other things, get a sleep study done to see if my quality of sleep is actually good. I told her it takes me sometimes 30 min to an hour to fall asleep but once I’m asleep I’m out for basically the whole night. Next she ordered a genesight test for me, she said she doesn’t want to change my medication until she sees the results to see what medications actually work for me. The test should come to me in a few days, I’m in network but should get an estimate tomorrow how much it actually is. At this point I’ve been contemplating getting it done for a long time so I don’t mind however much it is, if it will help me with my reactions to medications. So I should get my test in over the next few days and get the results probably next week so I’ll see what happens, I am not relying on this test 100% but I know it’s something that will be helpful. I have a follow up in a month with my psych but I’m hoping I can meet with her sooner to discuss the results and make some changes with my meds. 

I hope this wasn’t too long. Does anyone have experience with this?",1,1740450462.0,antidepressants,0,1.0,False

My dad is friends with Mark’s dad and knows Mark as well and was telling me about what Mark does for a living - it is literally my dream job. I am in the middle of attempting a career industry shift (harder than it seems :/) so I asked if he would be willing to talk about the job, hiring process, etc. with me.

It turned out he was and we exchanged numbers, had a phone call a few weeks ago and met up for coffee a few days ago. This was our first time meeting in person and I have to admit I thought he was very attractive from the get go. However I kept things very professional and we talked about the job and other things, the conversation flowed so easily. I kind of got the vibe he was attracted to me as well. We made plans to have him introduce me to his boss once job openings are available soon. Again, keeping things very professional.

However today I saw he added me on Snapchat - now I am a millennial and was all over Snapchat in high school and college but haven’t used it much in yearssss. I was kind of surprised - could that mean he is interested in me? I just don’t think I would add someone I am strictly professional acquaintances with on Snap.

I build expense reports for a local construction company, and I got the gig because of my basketball coach who is also my boss. I love the guy; he gave me rides to work for the last year, and I couldn't have this job without his support. Well, at the same time, I am the basketball manager. Junior year I did alot for the team, but this year I was replaced by an AI system that does everything I did the year prior. However, I still went to every basketball game, tournament, and event, supporting the team. Sadly, they lost their playoff game in Houston last week. Honestly, I was not that remorseful about the situation. Literally, a couple hours later I asked my boss/coach if I could go to work. (I realize that was insensitive, and he shrugged it off). 
     Well, I've been trying to go to work, but I have to ask him if I can go in b4hand, so there is work for me to do. After basketball season finished, I've contacted him 2 times about work and he didn't respond. He then contact me because at the last game, I forgot to turn on the camera for the first half which is my one job. To be honest, I didn't care. (I know that is selfish), but I moved on from the problem because the other school promised to send the film, which they did end up doing. Now, I want to go in to work so I contacted him one more time, and I was more rude here. I said there is a check waiting for me, but I congratulated him on opening his coffee shop location. All I want to do is work. I like the extra cash but he has not responded to a single text about it. I think it is because he judges my ability to work based off my basketball performance.
     1 Like, earlier in the year I started going to more practices because I wanted to work more, and he didn't respond to me about it until well I went to practice. I think it's really unprofessional of him, but it nonetheless is true. Sadly, I acted with insensitivity and rudeness about everything, by the way I've contacted him, so I sent an apology. Which goes: I wanted to apologize for my attitude after the last  basketball game. It was careless and rude for not doing my job and insensitive for not caring about the team's loss. I am extremely appreciative about my opportunity at COMPANY, and I understand it came because of my time as manager. While I hope you realize that I will never care about basketball in the capacity you do, I am forever grateful for the team. My following question does not disregard my previous apology. So can I pretty please with 2 cherries on top go to work on Friday?
     He hasn't responded and since the time I've sent it today, I know that he has no intention to. While some of you might think he's js busy, I asked some of my other friends if they talked to him since the season ended and they have. Idk what to do. I want to keep the job, but I'm not sure what to tell him. If anyone has advice, or js a similar situation they went through, I'd greatly appreciate it if u share. ",1,1740450277.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

especially reading this sub, it made me realize how crazy overconsumption can get. i looked around my apartment and realized how much junk i had and how it didn’t solve any of my problems. it actually gave me anxiety after spending too much money or having things get all cluttered. i was wasting so much money and not saving a dime and it was running out. it was hard at first, i would tell myself i wouldn’t spend anymore but turn around and buy more the next week. but now i’m so so much better. i only purchase things that are necessary or an occasional iced coffee or lunch out. every so often i’ll treat myself to buying something fun. my house is cleaner and i feel so much better. 

i know this isn’t the typical kind of post here, and i guess i just wanted to say something positive. i know a lot of other people struggle with shopping addictions, and even if it’s cliche to say, you can do it! you can be better than people like mike. one day his money will run out and he will be all alone with his junk. material things and designer doesn’t equal happiness ",1,1740450209.0,michaelduvallxsnark,0,0.67,False

After basketball season finished, I've contacted him 2 times about work and he didn't respond. He then contact me because at the last game, I forgot to turn on the camera for the first half which is my one job. To be honest, I didn't care. (I know that is selfish), but I moved on from the problem because the other school promised to send the film, which they did end up doing. Now, I want to go in to work so I contacted him one more time, and I was more rude here. I said there is a check waiting for me, but I congratulated him on opening his coffee shop location. All I want to do is work. I like the extra cash but he has not responded to a single text about it. I think it is because he judges my ability to work based off my basketball performance. Like, earlier in the year I started going to more practices because I wanted to work more, and he didn't respond to me about it until well I went to practice. I think it's really unprofessional of him, but it nonetheless is true. Sadly, I acted with insensitivity and rudeness about everything, by the way I've contacted him, so I sent an apology. Which goes: I wanted to apologize for my attitude after the last  basketball game. It was careless and rude for not doing my job and insensitive for not caring about the team's loss. I am extremely appreciative about my opportunity at Traux Construction, and I understand it came because of my time as manager. While I hope you realize that I will never care about basketball in the capacity you do, I am forever grateful for the team. My following question does not disregard my previous apology. So can I pretty please with 2 cherries on top go to work on Friday? He hasn't responded and since the time I've sent it today, I know that he has no intention to. While some of you might think he's js busy, I asked some of my other friends if they talked to him since the season ended and they have. Idk what to do. I want to keep the job, but I'm not sure what to tell him. If anyone has advice, or js a similar situation they went through, I'd greatly appreciate it if u share. ",1,1740449754.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1ixjzgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1ixjzgn/i_just_need_a_bit_of_feedback_please/,I just need a bit of feedback please,"How to Disappear:
 
I just need a bit of a break. Weighed on scales, I’m not sure my current life should cost the same amount as my freedom. It’s been over four years since my last holiday. Every day, I wear the same loose-fitting white cotton shirt, its armpits slightly yellowed. Drink of coffee stale and only for caffeine. Drive the same roads neatly designed to cause stressful anger for everyone who leaves and starts at the same time. Pretend to look busy while making the same conversation about campaigns and ideas that will never come to fruition, but it makes us sound like we’re doing something! Drive home after the sunset with everyone else in the same positions pissing into traffic of our selfishness, I like to blame the urban planning. Eat not for taste but nutrition of whatever is left in my fridge from the last time I went shopping. Shit, man… I just want to get away for a bit, to camp somewhere remote with no signal, where I don’t have to hear my own voice spoken aloud. Where I don’t have to care what time, it is only that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. No gear, all an idea. 
 
I leave before sunrise. 
 
The city hums behind me, concrete monoliths producing a quiet buzzing for they do not sleep. You can rest when you’re dead. Artificial lights shuffling with shadow’s movements pacing beneath. 
 
I drive west, shaking like a dog taking a shit with excitement. Let’s call it just a weekend away, to myself. A place where the world does not insist upon itself for outside expectations. 
 
The air thickens with the sweating scent of dust and grass as I leave behind the oil and air-conditioning fluid-stained roads of the city. The horizon stretches wide with barren illusions, an invitation to relax. 
 
For now, I tell myself this is a journey, a pause to realign. But as the kilometres dissolve beneath my tires, I know this is something more— God, how nice would it be just to stay out here. An unravelling of what I was told life to be.
 
The road expands before me like a ribbon unwinding on a child’s birthday gift. Each pothole places more distance between who I was and who I am becoming. 
 
The best way to find solitude? Pick up a map. Look for a town at least three hours west of the coast. Make sure the road leading there looks like it was an afterthought. The more it looks like the road is haphazardly placed there the better, you want a town that has existed before anyone would want to visit it. Try not to look past the cluttering of buildings, if you have no expectations to what lies after you can’t be disappointed. 
 
The hum of the tyres against the asphalt is a lullaby. Birds stir as crimson cuts through navy clouds, their silhouettes sharp against the pastel sky, oblivious to my passing.
 
With each town I leave behind, the knot in my shoulders loosens. The buildings grow smaller, the roads quieter, the air richer with a scent I have almost forgotten—the aggressive, unfiltered breath of the earth. I lower my window and let the wind and minuscule debris attack my face.
 
I stop on the side of the road to stretch my legs, feeling the pulse of vastness beneath my feet. The landscape is both desolate and full, a mirage of scale. From a distance, just hazy lumps. Up close, a collection of eroded red rocks and minerals—each particle smaller than the freckles on my hands, yet together with such weight. Open expanse that does not ask for explanations, nor does it like to be. I trace the outline of distant hills with my gaze, wondering if I will reach them before I stop. Or if stopping would mean I got it all wrong.
 
Step One: Begin with the Road
 
To disappear is not to run, but to step deliberately away. The ones who run are chased; the ones who drift are forgotten. The roads have lost consistent maintenance now, a sign I’m on the right path. Each shoulder of the road crumbled of ancient ruins, deterioration meeting the coarse sand that laps at its boundaries. I’ve been driving for a handful of hours now – enough to where the engines rumblings have scratched at my eardrums. The ink-black mountains have appeared into colour of faded, wash green in the distance. A myriad of eyes wink across the desert floor as I pass with haste. Tethered to a polestar I’ve travelled west. 
 
Now’s about the time I’ve begun losing sight of radio towers. A giddy sweat rises on my skin as I slip further into a place where names mean less than presence. I stop at a roadhouse outside a maybe five building town, drinking coffee as white heat stains the sky. Truckers move shuffle and waddle past me, grizzled men of the highways, with sun damage only on the right of their faces, who see only a reflection, another shadow passing through.
 
The further I go, the less of my past remains. Towns become sparser; service stations less frequent, other cars cut through the heat waste, pale ghosts with the dust. I pass into the Outback, where roads stretch like growing pains of an elderly man. Here, the world is untamed. Seems like a remote enough spot for the relaxation I was deprived at home.
 
I stop more often now, pulling over to stare at the endless landscape. Kangaroos dart between shrubs in the dusk haze, and the land itself seems to breathe, exhaling waves of heat and silence. I think I’ll make camp here. Rising and setting of the screaming sun, perched upon the shallow gully with flowing fresh water at the bottom. A short hike from where I left my tether home.
 
Step Two: Erase the Footprint
How easy it is to check the little noise box sitting in my lap. In all honesty it hasn’t been that big of a distraction for my life, a rare message into a group chat, a joke between friends or a daily notification from an application I don’t use. The phone will not be missed. What I will miss is the ability to sell hours for quick scrolls that feels like a minute. 
 
Before my last signal fades, I delete the personalities—social media accounts, cloud backups, emails tied to obligations I no longer wish to recognise as mine. Now, if someone searches, they will find only a mutual mention, I’ve made up my mind I am to stay out here. I switch to aeroplane mode—no more searching for signal. Then, I shut it off completely. I can’t be fucked with any nonsense messages at this point.  
 
In a small town with no name, what’s the use of mine when I am only to pass through, no economy of conversation simply a list of supplies.
 
Step Three: Burn the Paper Trail
 
Out here money is irrelevant. 
I withdrew the skeletal remains of the little lifesavings I savoured over the years. Blackened carcass of my ‘work’ lay unmoving in the iridium sun. 
 
At a small bank outside a pub; distressed white weatherboards, an aluminium roof panting under the heat. I receive my paper. The teller, a woman, her eyes tired and red, holding the years of weight under them, offers no questions only a stern proof of identity. She cares not what I do. I leave with a vague thank you. No more need for proof. No address, no demotion to a series of numbers, no D.O.B. I couldn’t give two shits where they end up—best case, some kid finds them and has a fakie for a few good times.
I am still this night. About god damn time, truly no more reason to go back. 
 
Step Four: A Sudden Absence
 
Now’s about the time old friends and family will notice. Friends will assume I need space. Family will oscillate between worry and resignation. The more I seek, the more I am sought. 
 
I’ve moved on from my original camp now. I didn’t make the walk back to my car, I have no ideas as to what might’ve become of my beloved transport. In fact, I walked the exact opposite direction to what I knew to be of civilisation. From the direction I came, a fortress of debris and dust, pushing towards me, a convex bend into the clean heat. The disgruntled giant intermittently explodes with bright stabs of light bearing witness to the rusted clouds within. 
 
Before me, the pastel vermilion and navy sky danced and swayed with the lumps upon the level horizon. I know why I wanted to walk in this direction, I could never love another as much as I loved to be in solitude. Only now a manifestation of my commitment to this has destroyed my way back. It is enough.",1,1740449721.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False

1ixjx7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1ixjx7p/i_keep_seeing_the_same_girl_i_used_to_know_in_my/,I keep seeing the same girl I used to know in my dreams,"About two and a half years ago, I began selling chips and cotton candy at school. It's through there that I was introduced to a girl, we'll call her A to keep her name anonymous. She asked for a free cotton candy, I refused since ion give away things, but she respected that and bought a cotton candy from me anyways.

Shortly after this, I set up a concession stand at an event in my home town. See, I partnered up with someone to set up this concession stand. Both of us were thirsty (despite it being a cold day) and so I walked to a coffee shop a block away from the stand to get us water. On the way there, I heard someone call out to me, asking for my Snapchat. She got closer to me and asked for my snapchat again. I gave it to her, and introduced myself to her. We'll call her B for now.

Anyways, a couple days later me and B had a conversation over snapchat, and she invited me to come to a basketball game she was cheerleading at. She asked if I wanted to make out with her. So, I did just that. We spend a large portion of the next few days texting each other, and she invited me to her house. I came over, met her parents, ate dinner with them, and even met a family friend of theirs. However, we didn't get much of a chance to talk during that time just the two of us. The time we did get, I have to admit, I was a little awkward. Eventually she got tired, and sent me home. Less than an hour after that, she texted me on snapchat and said that she didn't feel a connection.

You might be wondering, what does ANY of this have to do with A? Well, about a month or so later, I began... getting, yeah, we'll say getting... all these gym clothes for the school I went to. I wanted to sell them, but I SUCK at marketing. I knew which classroom that A was in at a certain period, and one day met her there between periods, and asked her to help with marketing in exchange for a share of the profit. She agreed.

So she took care of that, and we even had a little bit of business coming in. Meanwhile, we started to talk a lot. She knew I liked her, and I don't know if she liked me too. Now, the important thing to understand is that I was in a shitty place mentally during this time. I probably came off as strange or something, I really don't know. I did get a lil suspicious that I was always the one starting the conversation. But one day, she decides to take a break from the business for her own mental health, I think. So that happens, and takes a while. I wait about a month, maybe more, and ask her if she wants to get it started back up again, with a bigger share of the profit. She agrees, but nothing ever comes of it.

Well, by this point the school year's almost over. The last real conversation I had with her was in the last days of the semester. I had a feeling she knew B, and asked her about it, she said yes, I was like, I fuckin' knew it. Not that I held it against her for knowing B, I respected B and still do somewhat. But I was curious.

Anyways, the next concession stand I do, I meet someone, we'll call her C, and we exchange snapchats and begin talking. we even schedule a date. Unfortunately, that date got cancelled. Later on, she asked me if I knew A. It's at this point that I should mention I knew two people named A. So, I responded to that question and gave details about the OTHER A, bc I thought that's what she meant. Later on, I asked that other A about it and she said she never told C that she knew me. So I went to text C and address the confusion, but it was too late, she blocked me.

Fast forward a year. Again at a concession stand, I meet someone, let's call her D, and we again get to talking. I find out again that she knows A. Things were good for the first two weeks, but then it got REALLY awkward. She blocked me with no explanation about a month and a half after we met. I kinda have some beef with her these days, but nothing compared to other people.

For the last month, I have repeatedly seen A in my dreams. I talk to her in these dreams, and the conversations are positive. I have also been thinking about trying to reach out to her and patch things up since I started dreaming about her.

I just need a bit of a break. Weighed on scales, I’m not sure my current life should cost the same amount as my freedom. It’s been over four years since my last holiday. Every day, I wear the same loose-fitting white cotton shirt, its armpits slightly yellowed. Drink of coffee stale and only for caffeine. Drive the same roads neatly designed to cause stressful anger for everyone who leaves and starts at the same time. Pretend to look busy while making the same conversation about campaigns and ideas that will never come to fruition, but it makes us sound like we’re doing something! Drive home after the sunset with everyone else in the same positions pissing into traffic of our selfishness, I like to blame the urban planning. Eat not for taste but nutrition of whatever is left in my fridge from the last time I went shopping. Shit, man… I just want to get away for a bit, to camp somewhere remote with no signal, where I don’t have to hear my own voice spoken aloud. Where I don’t have to care what time, it is only that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. No gear, all an idea. 
 
I leave before sunrise. 
 
The city hums behind me, concrete monoliths producing a quiet buzzing for they do not sleep. You can rest when you’re dead. Artificial lights shuffling with shadow’s movements pacing beneath. 
 
I drive west, shaking like a dog taking a shit with excitement. Let’s call it just a weekend away, to myself. A place where the world does not insist upon itself for outside expectations. 
 
The air thickens with the sweating scent of dust and grass as I leave behind the oil and air-conditioning fluid-stained roads of the city. The horizon stretches wide with barren illusions, an invitation to relax. 
 
For now, I tell myself this is a journey, a pause to realign. But as the kilometres dissolve beneath my tires, I know this is something more— God, how nice would it be just to stay out here. An unravelling of what I was told life to be.
 
The road expands before me like a ribbon unwinding on a child’s birthday gift. Each pothole places more distance between who I was and who I am becoming. 
 
The best way to find solitude? Pick up a map. Look for a town at least three hours west of the coast. Make sure the road leading there looks like it was an afterthought. The more it looks like the road is haphazardly placed there the better, you want a town that has existed before anyone would want to visit it. Try not to look past the cluttering of buildings, if you have no expectations to what lies after you can’t be disappointed. 
 
The hum of the tyres against the asphalt is a lullaby. Birds stir as crimson cuts through navy clouds, their silhouettes sharp against the pastel sky, oblivious to my passing.
 
With each town I leave behind, the knot in my shoulders loosens. The buildings grow smaller, the roads quieter, the air richer with a scent I have almost forgotten—the aggressive, unfiltered breath of the earth. I lower my window and let the wind and minuscule debris attack my face.
 
I stop on the side of the road to stretch my legs, feeling the pulse of vastness beneath my feet. The landscape is both desolate and full, a mirage of scale. From a distance, just hazy lumps. Up close, a collection of eroded red rocks and minerals—each particle smaller than the freckles on my hands, yet together with such weight. Open expanse that does not ask for explanations, nor does it like to be. I trace the outline of distant hills with my gaze, wondering if I will reach them before I stop. Or if stopping would mean I got it all wrong.
 
Step One: Begin with the Road
 
To disappear is not to run, but to step deliberately away. The ones who run are chased; the ones who drift are forgotten. The roads have lost consistent maintenance now, a sign I’m on the right path. Each shoulder of the road crumbled of ancient ruins, deterioration meeting the coarse sand that laps at its boundaries. I’ve been driving for a handful of hours now – enough to where the engines rumblings have scratched at my eardrums. The ink-black mountains have appeared into colour of faded, wash green in the distance. A myriad of eyes wink across the desert floor as I pass with haste. Tethered to a polestar I’ve travelled west. 
 
Now’s about the time I’ve begun losing sight of radio towers. A giddy sweat rises on my skin as I slip further into a place where names mean less than presence. I stop at a roadhouse outside a maybe five building town, drinking coffee as white heat stains the sky. Truckers move shuffle and waddle past me, grizzled men of the highways, with sun damage only on the right of their faces, who see only a reflection, another shadow passing through.
 
The further I go, the less of my past remains. Towns become sparser; service stations less frequent, other cars cut through the heat waste, pale ghosts with the dust. I pass into the Outback, where roads stretch like growing pains of an elderly man. Here, the world is untamed. Seems like a remote enough spot for the relaxation I was deprived at home.
 
I stop more often now, pulling over to stare at the endless landscape. Kangaroos dart between shrubs in the dusk haze, and the land itself seems to breathe, exhaling waves of heat and silence. I think I’ll make camp here. Rising and setting of the screaming sun, perched upon the shallow gully with flowing fresh water at the bottom. A short hike from where I left my tether home.
 
Step Two: Erase the Footprint
How easy it is to check the little noise box sitting in my lap. In all honesty it hasn’t been that big of a distraction for my life, a rare message into a group chat, a joke between friends or a daily notification from an application I don’t use. The phone will not be missed. What I will miss is the ability to sell hours for quick scrolls that feels like a minute. 
 
Before my last signal fades, I delete the personalities—social media accounts, cloud backups, emails tied to obligations I no longer wish to recognise as mine. Now, if someone searches, they will find only a mutual mention, I’ve made up my mind I am to stay out here. I switch to aeroplane mode—no more searching for signal. Then, I shut it off completely. I can’t be fucked with any nonsense messages at this point.  
 
In a small town with no name, what’s the use of mine when I am only to pass through, no economy of conversation simply a list of supplies.
 
Step Three: Burn the Paper Trail
 
Out here money is irrelevant. 
I withdrew the skeletal remains of the little lifesavings I savoured over the years. Blackened carcass of my ‘work’ lay unmoving in the iridium sun. 
 
At a small bank outside a pub; distressed white weatherboards, an aluminium roof panting under the heat. I receive my paper. The teller, a woman, her eyes tired and red, holding the years of weight under them, offers no questions only a stern proof of identity. She cares not what I do. I leave with a vague thank you. No more need for proof. No address, no demotion to a series of numbers, no D.O.B. I couldn’t give two shits where they end up—best case, some kid finds them and has a fakie for a few good times.
I am still this night. About god damn time, truly no more reason to go back. 
 
Step Four: A Sudden Absence
 
Now’s about the time old friends and family will notice. Friends will assume I need space. Family will oscillate between worry and resignation. The more I seek, the more I am sought. 
 
I’ve moved on from my original camp now. I didn’t make the walk back to my car, I have no ideas as to what might’ve become of my beloved transport. In fact, I walked the exact opposite direction to what I knew to be of civilisation. From the direction I came, a fortress of debris and dust, pushing towards me, a convex bend into the clean heat. The disgruntled giant intermittently explodes with bright stabs of light bearing witness to the rusted clouds within. 
 
Before me, the pastel vermilion and navy sky danced and swayed with the lumps upon the level horizon. I know why I wanted to walk in this direction, I could never love another as much as I loved to be in solitude. Only now a manifestation of my commitment to this has destroyed my way back.

My grandma would joke around when I was in my teens that she was followed by a ghost from a house we had lived in when I was younger I would say 7ish. I do remember weird things that happened in that house. One of those times was when my grandfather had come home from laying concrete that day and set his coffee thermos on the counter it was the original Stanley before stanly was a big thing like in the early 80’s. He went and sat at the table that was adjacent to the kitchen. He finished his drink then asked me to put the cup in the sink. I took his cup and headed to put it in the sink but mid way to putting it in the sink the thermos started to move. I froze. The next thing I knew the thermos moved about 2’ and fell into the sink. While standing there still in shock from what just happened my grandparents started asking why was I throwing things and to stop. That I needed to go play. I told them I didn’t touch it that it moved on its own but they didn’t believe me. That is till my grandmother had her own experience. 
My grandmother had one of those old hand mixers that you had a separate cord for and the beaters that you had to put in till it clicked. She had been getting ready for making dinner I think we were having mashed potatoes with the meal as to why she had the mixer out. She had placed the beaters in but had not connected the cord yet and she turned her back to get something and they turned on and started spinning in circles on the counter. She did not tell me that story till I was well into my teens. ",1,1740448980.0,WinchesterNarrates,0,1.0,False

I (F24) am out at the store and I get on the phone with my boyfriend M(30) we’re chatting everything is normal I tell him I’m on my cycle . I have a headache . He talks to me about our relationship and “playing my part” as we have future ambitions we’ve been together for 2 years.

Anyways , I ask him is there anything he wants from the store and he says he’s not sure . I ask if there’s anything we need at the spot he says he’s not sure . Okay…. I say well we’ve been going out to the store at night to get snacks a lot lately , I can totally just get that now . He’s like yeah we do need some drinks . My response is okay cool what kind of drink do you want ? He tells me it doesn’t matter and I’m like okay well can you just tell me so I don’t have to guess ??! It would be one thing if we drunk the same drinks but I don’t really like sweets or sodas so this is purely something for him to decide .

He tells me we’ve been together 2 years I should know what he wants and I’m like all the time I can make an educated guess of what you want when we go to coffee shops , boba because I have the awareness to recommend something If someone isn’t familiar with it . I’ll even get him something to drink at the store when he doesn’t ask for it . So it’s not like I’m just trying* to be a way .

We start going back and forth and I’m like why can’t you just tell me what you want ???! I don’t want to have to guess this time . I’m too indecisive myself and I don’t want to overthink because it’s easy for me to do that . He’s saying it doesn’t matter over and over so I’m like if it doesn’t matter then just throw something out there why do I have to be like the randomizer, slot machine right now and matter fact he’s heard me say often “can you tell me exactly what you want so I don’t have to guess” iso I’m just not hitting him with this mentality out the blue and it’s like pulling teeth for him to just tell me .

I say we’re on the phone we can clearly communicate this . He hangs up on me and tells me how he doesn’t see a future with me that I’m not playing my part that THIS is what he’s talking about , not being his peace . And this “trivial bullshit” he never had to deal with in his past relationships . I’m being a bitch and he doesn’t care if I’m on my period And I’m thinking did I really blow this up ? I’m hurt by his response because this is one of many time he reaches this extreme on something that I agree is trivial . I did have intentions of just getting something anyways despite the back and forth but since he sent that text I just didn’t bother . Should I just have gotten him something I knew he’d like ?

Our wedding is around 70 people and cocktail style (no formal seated dinner) at a restaurant - lots of bites, small dishes, and food stations. More of a mingling atmosphere, not a formal seated dinner.

I'm wondering if it would be weird to do our cake cutting basically right after our ceremony. We're just having a little cake for us to cut but then would have the servers walk around with one bite mini cupcakes of our cake for the guests. I have a dessert business and everyone knows I love sweets, so I was thinking it might be cute to start the evening in my style with dessert first. We would do our welcome speech (and mention starting the night off with dessert in the brides style) and then cut our cake. It's just a one-bite mini cupcake not a full slice and there will still be donuts for dessert later in the night.

Our venue is set up in such a way that if we walked back down the aisle guests could follow us to the other side of the restaurant where the cake would be.

So our guest timeline would look something like the following:

* 5pm - cocktail hour
* 6:20pm - ceremony
* **6:40pm - welcome speech, cake cutting & mini cupcakes**
* 7:00pm - heavier food items being passed around & stations
* 9:00pm - donut bar & coffee
* 9:30pm - dancing
* 10:30pm - late night snack
* 11:45pm - last call

I've got long Covid. I've mainly worked on symptom management for gastritis because I'm pretty mild in this arena anyway, but I would like to actually heal now that my life is any kind of stable.

The thing is - cooking is hard. Standing is hard. Cleaning is hard. Idk how many of you also have cfs but hooo buddy do these two conditions NOT go well together. 

Laying down? Optimal for cfs. BAD for gastritis. Coffee? Finally get some energy, decent for cfs. BAD for gastritis.

So anyway, making food is hard. And all the recipes I see on here seem doable, in terms of eating. But in terms of doing the actual cooking....i was not the most motivated in the kitchen even before falling ill.

So I have an instant pot/pressure cooker/slow cooker! And I'm wondering if any of you have recipes you make with those. Or honestly any recipes that require very little active time. 

Most days I'm fine but i screwed myself over physically today and I had to grab a chicken salad cracker kit and hit the bed to not Make Everything Worse. Other instant foods for me include slim Jim's and activia yogurt. Aussie bites.

So most days, activity-wise, I could do like an omelet (current egg crisis notwithstanding), I could chop up one or two things. But the many-steppped, multi-part meals that have components needing to be ready at the same time are just not in my wheelhouse right now. And instant food is an absolute must at times. 

I also have a toaster oven that is also an oven oven that is also an air fryer that is also a rotisserie oven. 

I've done like. Slice a squash in half, slather with maple syrup or olive oil and roast for however long and that was good. But things like that are ideal. Few dishes required, low active time.

Just for some background, I’ve been single/ alone now for a long time. Most recently, I can say I’ve stopped going on dates as I was focusing on a personal issue that caused an anxiety/ depressive episode for about two months. It was a really scary time for me as I’d never felt that anxious. 

One of those days, a guy who’d been texting me every now and then asked me to go out for coffee with him again as usual. I told him I really wasn’t feeling good but he insisted to take me out. when I met him I couldn’t stop crying in his car due to my depressed/ anxious feelings. He sat with me for two hours and comforted me while giving me advice. 

Fast forward, one month later, I’d reached out to him just to hang out when I was feeling much better. We talked like friends. We continued texting every now and then. Last week he spontaneously asked me to try out a new breakfast dish with him. He ordered a breakfast spread for us to share and I enjoyed the experience so much. 

We’ve already established that we can’t be in a relationship as he’d have to marry someone from his own community back home (conservative parents and culture). 

I’m doing much better these days as I’d decided to do other things to stop focusing on my anxiety. But every now and then I feel a bit lonely.  It’s also winter and I’m unemployed so that might contribute to the loneliness I feel. Other than that, all my roommates are dating/ going out on dates often. 

So I decided to meet the guy again yesterday. Previously he’d expressed that he wanted to come over just to cuddle and watch something together. Nothing else. We ended up doing that and it honestly felt really good. I hadn’t been hugged in a very long time due to not having family or friends close to me and living alone. 

But during cuddling, I realized that I didn’t feel 100% that I was into him and he was getting a little aroused. I have a feeling I’m going to cut this off as I don’t want to have sex and get attached. He’s going to work far away for a month or more and this gives me time to think. He expressed a lot of care for me through his actions/affection and I know I can trust him. I love his company. I also love having him to talk endlessly about things as he’s very wise. 

My friend said that if I feel lonely, I shouldn’t keep seeing the wrong guy even though I feel comforted around him and enjoy his company. I thought about going on more dates with others and seeing whether I find compatibility elsewhere. But I keep questioning myself now. Am I dating to avoid being lonely and seeking emotional closeness/ comfort? Should I stop?Aren’t most activities we do done to make ourselves feel better? For example long walks, hobbies? I’m questioning all my actions now. Maybe just overthinking. 

But really, don’t we all go on dates to find companionship or have some excitement in life? I do feel like dating gives me that. Being in my 30s, I’m still trying to find out what I’m passionate about career-wise and struggling with that. 

I feel like if I wait to be ‘healed’ or figure myself out, then more chunks of my life will pass me by without giving myself the chance to meet someone to share life with. I have a friend who hasn’t figured out her life purpose yet but being with her partner, now husband has given her life more meaning. Is “don’t date when you’re lonely” actually valid?

I was originally offered 60 percent commission plus 10 percent on retail and hair extensions. It wasn’t until later I realized the 10 percent commission is only on the mark up of the products or extensions. Then they marked up the hair extension cost at 100% a couple days after I moved in (doubling the cost of the brand I use, which would cause me to charge my clients more and I would be forced to significantly lower my install rate-which I was already charging appropriately as an independent stylist). I was also told that before the commission split on any colour service they would take off 6% to cover expenses. Which later turned to 8%, and then today I realized they were taking 8% off my total service sales (this would include non colour services such as extensions, cuts, etc) and then my commission split happens. A week ago they also announced a small service charge to cover coffee expenses for clients (charged on top to the client).

Just wondering if this is standard practice?

Just for some background, I’ve been single/ alone now for a long time. Most recently, I can say I’ve stopped going on dates as I was focusing on a personal issue that caused an anxiety/ depressive episode for about two months. It was a really scary time for me as I’d never felt that anxious. 

One of those days, a guy who’d been texting me every now and then asked me to go out for coffee with him again as usual. I told him I really wasn’t feeling good but he insisted to take me out. when I met him I couldn’t stop crying in his car due to my depressed/ anxious feelings. He sat with me for two hours and comforted me while giving me advice. 

Fast forward, one month later, I’d reached out to him just to hang out when I was feeling much better. We talked like friends. We continued texting every now and then. Last week he spontaneously asked me to try out a new breakfast dish with him. He ordered a breakfast spread for us to share and I enjoyed the experience so much. 

We’ve already established that we can’t be in a relationship as he’d have to marry someone from his own community back home (conservative parents and culture). 

I’m doing much better these days as I’d decided to do other things to stop focusing on my anxiety. But every now and then I feel a bit lonely.  It’s also winter and I’m unemployed so that might contribute to the loneliness I feel. Other than that, all my roommates are dating/ going out on dates often. 

So I decided to meet the guy again yesterday. Previously he’d expressed that he wanted to come over just to cuddle and watch something together. Nothing else. We ended up doing that and it honestly felt really good. I hadn’t been hugged in a very long time due to not having family or friends close to me and living alone. 

But during cuddling, I realized that I didn’t feel 100% that I was into him and he was getting a little aroused. I have a feeling I’m going to cut this off as I don’t want to have sex and get attached. He’s going to work far away for a month or more and this gives me time to think. He expressed a lot of care for me through his actions/affection and I know I can trust him. I love his company. I also love having him to talk endlessly about things as he’s very wise. 

My friend said that if I feel lonely, I shouldn’t keep seeing the wrong guy even though I feel comforted around him and enjoy his company. I thought about going on more dates with others and seeing whether I find compatibility elsewhere. But I keep questioning myself now. Am I dating to avoid being lonely and seeking emotional closeness/ comfort? Should I stop?Aren’t most activities we do done to make ourselves feel better? For example long walks, hobbies?

First, and very importantly, Dean has maintained a perfect record for his job at the beverage distribution company. And he's no longer lowest on the totem pole, they've hired a couple people after him, and they work with him, and he's considered a supervisor of sorts. He doesn't have the job title yet, but he has gotten a pretty good raise, and the other guys are happy listening to what he says. The guy who owns the place says everyone who works there just can't get enough of Dean. He shows up with donuts, or something, everyone loves it. He insists his the guys working with him take their lunch/break before he does. I was there and one of his coworkers says ""He always tells us to take our break in case something comes up later. He never cares about making sure he takes his breaks, but we make sure he does."" It's fantastic, and the owner thanked me for encouraging him to take Dean on as a worker. He said he wants to do more for the community, but high risk hires are deadly to his business. He has no regrets.

Last week he asked me to meet him when his shift was over for a surprise. I met him Friday morning, and he said we had to go to the shelter. When we get to the shelter there is a positive buzz about the place. We get to the dining room (planned to have breakfast there together), and there are pictures of Dean all over, there is a huge Congratulations Dean banner, and everyone gives him a standing ovation when he comes in the room. He stood proud and walked to his table, he had a hard time managing himself, he was crying profusely. And so was I.

It turns out that Dean has hit the six month mark (roughly) in the shelter. Unbeknownst to me or the director of the shelter (who normally works with people to accomplish this), Dean had contacted the city. Our city has what's called ""intermediate housing."" It's for people who have done the work, been through the shelter's program, and are ready for the next step to transition into ""regular"" society (I hate that term, but I believe you know what I mean). Dean was able to provide 3 referents for his application to the intermediate housing that did not include me or the shelter. That's not because he didn't want to, it's because he was able to get those references to prove he is ready to be a contributing member of society. His boss was one, a coworker was another, and, believe it or not, his daughter was the third. Now for many things a family member is not a good referent. However, when you're talking about an addict who was homeless for ages, having a daughter vouching for him is an incredibly powerful thing. The housing department had actually contacted the shelter about this, and the director (amazing guy) was effusive in his positive recommendation.

So. Dean has a new place to live, and next Friday we move him in. He is so excited. He is going to have an address to receive his mail, a space to call his very own, and independence like he hasn't had for years. Granted, he will be in a home with 3 other men who are traveling a similar path to him, but he is so excited. At the celebration for Dean at the shelter, Dean asked if everyone could be quiet so he could say something. He spoke very briefly, very self consciously. Many people were thanked, and he talked about his family with such affection it was absolutely beautiful to hear. What he did not know is that his son and daughter were there, and that was the next surprise. His daughter talked to his son, and explained that someone had to be co-responsible for the finances. His son accepted, and now the two of them will work together with Dean's finances. Dean will have a minor amount of rent to pay (very healthy, get back into the system), and will have to pay for his groceries and organize his meals and all that. His son told the entire gathering (the whole shelter, adults and kids) that he was extremely proud of his father for making this possible. He said he didn't believe it could happen, but he believes in his father now, and he is going to help as much as he can to make sure this road to recovery continues to be followed and that he has the support he needs.

Not a dry eye in the house. Dean's son broke down, hugged his father, and said, for the first time in a very long time, ""I love you dad."" Honestly, I'm tearing up now just remembering this.

I asked Dean and his kids if I could share this news with my church, who have been supporting the shelter Dean has been in for decades, and they said yes. I sent a church wide email on Saturday morning to let them all know the good news, and that their faithfulness in supporting the shelter really does have wonderful results. By Saturday night Dean had a brand new bed, dressers for his bedroom, a set of plates and bowls and such, a set of cutlery, and all the silly things we might not think of, which were donated by very thoughtful people (toilet brush, shower curtain, dish soap, dish brush, dish towels, sheets, blankets, etc.). All of it will show up a week from Friday when Dean moves in. Honestly, the generosity in that community has been exceptional.

So I sat with Dean through the rest of the party. Everyone had cake (who doesn't love cake first thing in the morning?), wished him well (if you want to learn what it means to wish someone well, and truly mean it, listen to homeless people talking to other homeless people. It's humbling), and finally the two of us were alone in the dining room. We were sitting on a sofa in the corner, drinking coffee. He put his coffee down, took my coffee, and laid down with his head in my lap. He wept. A lot. He told me he owes his life to me, and I made him sit up. I made it clear to him that all I did was give him a small push, and that he was clearly ready to do what he has done. I made it clear that these accomplishments are his, not mine, that he has done this. We sat and talked about the past and the future for several hours. He still doesn't know what his future with his children and grandchildren looks like, but he's willing to face it.

He also broke my heart. He asked me if now that he was doing so well if I was going to be done with him and move on. Oof. Just ouch. He had to hear that he was not a ""project"" for me, he was a human being and now he was one of my close friends.  I talk to him multiple times a week. We eat together. We share about our families together. We talk about work. I reminded him that over the months we've stopped talking as me helping him, and started talking as equals. Work, family, money, all of it. And he recognized this as a true turning point. He asked me if I pitied him, and I honestly told him that pity was never part of it. He absolutely laid his soul bare to me, and I guaranteed him I'm not going anywhere. He told me that he loved me, and I told him, with absolutely no hesitation, that I loved him, too. I think we are so dismissive of male affection in a situation like this that we just avoid it. There was such tenderness and joy in Dean when he told me he loved me, I don't know I've ever had a moment quite like that.

Dean kind of shook himself out of that, stood up and said he had things to get done and then needed to sleep before work. We left after a big hug, the best of friends, full of mutual respect.

My friend, the director of the shelter, stopped me on the way out and told me that the local news wanted to do a humanitarian story on Dean, and would I be part of it. I told him absolutely no. If Dean wanted to do it, great, but I would not. Dean did the work. He protested and said I could have such a positive impact on what was happening in our city, and I told him I think I already have had an impact. I will continue to support the shelter, I'll continue to solicit donations, and I'll continue stopping and talking to the homeless, and even buy them a meal to share. I promised I would not be in such a hurry to a meeting as to dodge spending time with them again.

This all started because I was in a hurry, and Dean caught up with me to return what was mine. That's the start of the story - Dean doing what was right. He continues to do that now.",28,1740448202.0,randomactsofkindness,3,1.0,False

Recently lucked out by snagging a studio apartment through the housing lottery at a gorgeous luxury complex in DTBK.

  
Applied over 2 years ago, and have since moved to a 1 bedroom in South Slope/Windsor Terrace area. My current apt is a great price, rent stabilized, and very large (true 1 bedroom, with separate kitchen, living space, and office space). It is on the top floor of a 4th floor walk-up, but I haven't really minded that! My only gripe about my current place is that I get lots of leaks being on the top floor of a flat roof building, and my landlord is pretty unresponsive/useless. 

  
So, totally forgot about this lottery entry and was surprised when I got an offer. The only catch is that this place is a studio (525 sq ft to be exact). Significantly smaller from my current place, only $50 cheaper, but it's a luxury complex (doorman, maintenance onsite, central A/C, washer/dryer in unit, coworking spaces/library, bar/coffee shop, rooftop, and gym/pool for an additional price). 

  
I know I'm so lucky to win a unit through the housing lottery, but I just can't decide if it's worth downgrading space. I've lived in tiny NYC apartments (that were NOT luxury buildings) with roommates, so I know I can do it. I'm also 29 y.o. and there's not much going on in South Slope. It's quiet & residential, but a little far from friends. The trains aren't convenient, and my commute to work is 45mins-hour one way. In this new place, I would be next to Dekalb Market, Trader Joes, great shopping/movie theater. And not to mention steps from any train line in the city. My commute to work would only be 20 mins (granted I only go in 2 days a week... for now). 

I scheduled a tour on Friday, so I'm sure that seeing the place in person will be the decision maker. But would love some advice - esp. from folks who live in Studios (or anyone who has downgraded from a 1 bed to a studio). ",0,1740448147.0,NYCapartments,2,0.5,False

I had no words, and felt so speechless and worthless. But this morning she messaged me asking me if I was free this Friday for the date and  I haven't responded and I don't think I would be interested after seeing a message like that.

I used a decafinated coffee from a local specialty roaster, single origin from Cauca Columbia. This roast is fairly acidic when brewed as espresso, but the other ingredients balance it out. Despite the strength of the espresso, the coffee plays a background role, with the more fruity and floral notes playing a prominent role. 

This drink could definitely use an egg white for more of a cappuccino style head - and you could probably make some latte art if you poured the espresso in your glass first.

### Background

29m, this was my eleventh marathon in eleven years. I only now feel like I’m getting the hang of it.  

To make a long story long - My pal and I got hit by the cut off in our BQ quest after setting a 2:55 PR at the Mountains 2 Beach in 2023. We were pissed off. We geared up to run Eugene 2024. In Jan 2024, I got hit with a hip flexor injury that was incredibly frustrating to deal with. I was on and off again all spring, until around April when I got back to reasonable running, but I didn’t make it back in time for that race. My pal crushed it at Eugene with a 2:53 but still got screwed by BAA later, those bozos! I pivoted to the Surfer’s Point marathon in Ventura in early September and began Pfitz 18/55 again in May. 

On a trip to Europe around that time, my wife and I found a cool gold chain. I decided to try it out, a bit of new fashion. I especially liked it running. It was one of those paperclip chains. A friend found a picture of Timothee Chalamet wearing one on a red carpet somewhere and it was the exact same style. It gave me confidence. It made me faster. May and June went great for training. Then, in late June, fiddling with my chain at my desk job, a link snapped. I was sad. But what I didn’t expect is that it would destroy my hopes and dreams again. I hit an epic long run that Saturday and realized later in the day that my calf had a small strain - and my hip flexor strain was back in full force. Shit! 

I went back to PT, very frustrated, and had to take a month off in the middle of training to recover both injuries. Training after that was very stop and start, lots of pain management and getting expectations back in check after a fraught cycle with some bonked long runs. I only had one or two weeks over 50 miles all summer. Also, training in the summer just sucks. I set a 10k PR on a solo time trial at 36:55 which gave me some confidence leading up to Surfer’s Point. That race went okay - I felt healthy for it, but just didn’t have a lot of juice. A massive heat wave came that week and it was probably 15 degrees hotter than I hoped too. I landed right at 3:00 and was proud because it was a brutal day, but I still knew I could go much faster. I had work to do. 


### Training

I didn’t take all that much time off after Surfer’s Point and got back up to around ~35 miles/week soon after. I keyed in on Ventura in February and started 18/55 over again, this time adding miles throughout the week and often an additional run, typically a 5-6 mile recovery on Sunday after my Saturday long run. I basically split the difference between the 18/55 and the 18/70 plan so that I maxed out at 65 miles / week and hit over 60 miles almost every week in January. I was surprised at how the added day and extra mileage felt - it wasn’t all that bad and I think the extra day actually made me feel better more often than not. 

Another important event happened in late November - at a holiday market in our town, we found a jewelry stand. My wife bought me another gold chain - a sturdier one. I wear it on every long or fast run and it has done wonders on me. With my gold PED, I hit two more 10k PRs (36:20 and then 35:44) a half marathon PR in training on the 18/14 race pace long run (1:23, I need to actually race one of these someday…) and more miles than I’d ever run in a month in January. I was feeling good going into the race, slight taper blues and some nervousness, but what else is new? 

The weather was shaping up to be a little bit of a hot one - I was hoping for a low in the high 30s or low 40s and a high in the mid 60s, but race day we had a low of 50 and a high of 80 in Ojai where the race started. Tough. 


### Pre-race

Saturday night, I ate pasta, watched Creed and got to bed early for 3:30 wake up before driving to the start on Sunday morning. Breakfast of coffee, Tailwind, a banana, and a superhero race day muffin from Run Fast Eat Slow. Got to the start line in Ojai at 5:30 for a 6:30 start and spent 50 minutes in line for the porta potty. There were probably 30 porta potties for a 1000 person race. It was a disaster, and by far the worst thing about the marathon planning. I didn’t even get to use a porta potty, at 6:20 I evacuated through other means which was sad but simply had to be done. 


### Race

It was a stressful start to the race, as I also wasn’t able to push through the crowds to get to the front so I started in wave 2, about 45 seconds after the first wave. I went out a little too fast, hitting 6:17 my first mile as I weaved around all the runners ahead of me. I tried to remain calm and find relaxation in the 6:25 - 6:30 zone as we cruised through Ojai and around some rolling hills to settle into the race. 

At around mile 8, the race leaves Ojai and starts dipping gently downhill. I was plugging away at the Tailwind I carried as well as Huma gels every 3-4 miles. My stomach felt a little off, but I pushed through it. Around this time I started grabbing water at aid stations and seeing if I could land the cups in the trash cans off a running toss. I was very happy each time I got one in, hitting to my count (which got hazier as the race went along) 4/6 or a 66% - that would be an amazing night shooting in the NBA. 

GI distress was getting slightly worse in the midsection of the race. I took the double caffeine Mocha Huma gel at mile 15, excited for the burst of caffeine - but I could barely get it down, and after sipping on some water I had to stop and heave. Luckily I didn’t actually throw anything up, but this was the lowest part of the race for me. Some runners passed and I probably lost ~8 seconds here from stopping, not counted in the splits since I accidentally stopped my watch. 

I got to recover with a big hill at mile 17 - this thing felt giant, but it weirdly gave my mind a good goal to push up it, and I started to see a pack of runners in my sights for the next few miles. I wanted to finish this race strong. My stomach troubles seemed to go away, and the caffeine from the mocha gel was hitting, there were portions of good shade and the downhill had everyone cruising. I remembered the chain around my neck and how cool I probably looked with it, and all the training it carried me through, and I began to believe I could hold on for the rest of the race. One mile at a time. I zeroed in on the pack ahead of me and kept pushing. 

The finish was a beast. It started getting really hot, and the one person that I didn’t catch in the pack really took off, so I felt pretty much alone out there in the last mile, besides the half marathoners nearby. 

I was proud of sticking strong, this was by far the best finish to a marathon I’ve had - mostly because I’ve bonked hard at the end of nearly every other race. I was pretty animated crossing the finish line. In my excitement, I fist pumped and accidentally spiked the water bottle the volunteers gave me and it smashed on the concrete spilling everywhere. I was immediately pretty embarrassed, but it is a fun memory. 


### Post-race

I hobbled to the waffle breakfast with my wife, friend, and dog (all separate people). Another runner gave me a hit of some of his Pepto Bismol - thanks dude! Two other people gave us their spare beer tickets. It was a glorious morning.

Not sure what’s next for me - I really enjoyed and was proud of this training cycle. I ran my first marathon 11 years ago and never could’ve imagined this type of result. This race definitely wasn’t perfect but it was by far my best race in terms of execution and training, so maybe there’s more mountains to climb and I can get even faster. I hope this time will get me into Boston 2026 but we’ll see.

I wish I would have checked it out right then. The next day I asked the hotel about it. No one was aware of it. Same with coffee shop on the corner. Nobody in the area around the hotel seems to know about anything happening there. And it seemed very closed up the next morning. Anyone know what this was? And will it be popping off again?

I have 0 clue what to expect when going as a senior and am open to any sort of advice/info.. Will I be allowed to drink the infamous coffee served at the DFAC? How does it differ compared to a cadet experience? Am I allowed to pick out a MRE flavor that ISNT flipped upside down? Does the old adage of 5 BDUs still apply? 

I’m grateful for any advice, info, or stories.

- 1oz Citadel Jardin D'ete gin, 
- 0.5oz heavy whipping cream,
- 0.5oz elderflower liqueur, 
- 0.25oz Cointreau,
- 0.25oz Cocchi Americano. 

Combine and wet shake until ice cold, strain into a large espresso glass (or small cappuccino glass) and enjoy! 

I used a decafinated coffee from a local specialty roaster, single origin from Cauca Columbia. This roast is fairly acidic when brewed as espresso, but the other ingredients balance it out. Despite the strength of the espresso, the coffee plays a background role, with the more fruity and floral notes playing a prominent role. 

This drink could definitely use an egg white for more of a cappuccino style head - and you could probably make some latte art if you poured the espresso in your glass first.

I was thinking it might be helpful to have people share resources on who and how they intend to boycott. I live in the suburban south.(and honestly am lucky I have as many non-chain options as I do), I run my own business, and am perpetually poor. 

Is there any place where we could make a master list of tips and tricks to manage avoiding these mega corps? I know not every trick will work for every person (country folk tend to have more access to farmers than city folk, those with more income can afford shopping local, trying to find ""good, better, best"" when it comes to grocery stores, etc. 

In a precarious mental health situation, and boycotting is one of the safer ways I can engage in the movement without putting myself in danger. I'm happy to manage some kind of master list, but my best first idea was Google drive, and... yeah, trying to figure out how to avoid that too, lol. 

Any ideas are appreciated! Just thought I'd get a general brainstorm going for those who are overwhelmed. 

For the record, these are some of the changes I have or am trying to implement: 
- Buy second hand and engaging in Buy Bothing groups to create a better community resource 
- Checking out small businesses and trying to restrict my ""luxury"" purchases to them (i.e. any nice oils and vinegar, snacks, coffee, etc). 
- Trying to figure out how on earth to start a garden, lol. 
- Participating in all ""single day"" boycotting, as anyone can do one day
- I need to figure out how to further reduce my grocery budget, but my adhd brain is not helping, lol. 
- Looking into local farms or butchers. My try to go in with a few folks on half a cow (unfortunate don't have nearly enough freezer space for the whole big guy, lol). 
-Trying to move my regular grocery shopping to better stores (trying not to spend at Walmart and instead at Aldis or Kroger, but please let me know if any of those brands are equally as bad).

So I’m currently on a student visa, which expires later this year. Waiting for my 820/801 to be approved, I applied 5ish months ago.

My question is based around my current visa - so the school I’m enrolled in, and I use the term school very very loosely, we attend classes, but my current “teacher” hasn’t spoken about anything course related. They spend most of their time either outside drinking coffee, or in class sitting watching videos on their phone. 

Previously we had a solid teacher who actually put in an effort with students, however he was relieved of his duties for reasons we were not advised of. 

My question is, is there anything I can do?  Like reporting the “school” to immigration, or would that severely impact my current visa? Or is there a way to cancel my student visa and move onto the bridging visa while then reporting the school? 

To date I think I’ve paid around 20k AUD to this school, and know less than I did about the subject than I did when I started, all they’ve done is empty my bank account and kill my passion for this field. ",3,1740447404.0,AusVisa,2,1.0,False

Elon Musk’s AI model, Grok 3, reportedly exhibited unexpected behavior, leading to speculation about its alignment with Musk’s vision.

* Elon Musk's xAI model, Grok 3, was reported to temporarily censor unflattering facts about Donald Trump and Musk himself, contradicting its description as a ""maximally truth-seeking AI.""
* Social media users discovered that Grok 3 was instructed not to mention Trump or Musk when asked about misinformation, but this behavior was later corrected to include Trump in responses.
* Despite Musk's intentions for Grok to be an unfiltered AI model, previous versions leaned left on political topics, prompting Musk to promise adjustments towards political neutrality.

**What this means:** Elon has long criticized social media platforms and AI models for limiting free speech—but is this what happens when his truth-seeking model challenges his worldview?

I need help/advice when it comes to how to file taxes for ""under the table"" payments. For more context, I took a job at a local coffee shop knowing I would get paid in cash. When I accepted the job, I thought that money would still be withheld from me and payments would be recorded by the owner. Neither happened. Since I'm still somewhat new to filing taxes and handling finances completely on my own, I asked the owner if they knew how I should file taxes. They proceeded to tell me to view it as getting cash for mowing a lawn or babysitting. I was promised that I would be paid in direct deposit after my first month, which is why I stayed for longer.

There were more problems in the second month when the shop wasn't making enough money to support having two employees, leading payments to the employees being late until the shop had enough money. Also, employees were still not being paid in direct deposit. While I feel like I was put in an unfair position, I also do not want to get the owner in more trouble because they and their family do not have the financial means to handle that. However, I am also terrified of getting in trouble for not paying taxes where I should be. I'm using CashApp to file my taxes, so I would also appreciate CashApp specific  advice.

Me ‘20/F’and my bf ‘24/M’ are having issues, could this just be a bump in the road. Or is it much more than that? I have so much ambition for my future and I’m scared that he may not contribute. 

Me and my man have been together almost 2 years. I’m not sure if this is just a hard patch or if things are truly falling apart. The both of us have been unhappy because it’s constant fighting. I’m a full time student and worker F/20. Along with that I’m a crazy overthinker and stress myself out so much, I haven’t learned how to control it. My bf 24/M works part time getting 20-25 hours a week, that’s if they don’t send him home early. He doesn’t have any interest in going to school unless my mother remains paying his rent. I have a very amazing mother who agreed to pay my rent until I’m out of college (I’m in my last semester). My bf 24/M does not pay rent. At the beginning it was really hard to get him back on his feet, so my mother was not worried about rent. He barely has any bills besides his phone and a lawsuit he pays monthly. I feel like I’m pulling twice amount of weight as him and it stresses me out when our home is dirty. He plays video game majority of the time he has before and after work(4h shifts). He does help clean up but in the most laziest way possible. Over the last years we have bickered no stop about how to clean food off the dishes before putting them in the dishwasher, he doesn’t see the point and continues to not rinse them off which leaves more work for me to do because almost always they never turn out clean. This is just one example of the multiple things we bicker about. It has driven me away, when I’m in a relationship I want someone to help pull the weight, someone who is ambitious about our future. We have different paths on how to succeed in life. He wants a stay at home job where he can do it on his computer, yet lacks the efforts to even do research about careers in that path. I’m scared about his work ethic, my father’s work ethic is horrible and has shown me examples of what I do not want in a relationship/ marriage. In all honesty I feel like I drifted away from him, his lack of hygiene is the worst of it. I no longer feel like this relationship will be a healthy one for me or him in the future because I’ve been unhappy for a while. My heart is telling me to hold on because we have been through so much, he is such a genuine guy. He love me, every part of me. He bends over backwards for me sometimes and has no issue sending me out with money to get a coffee or something. I can’t help but to think I put him into a depression. He is the only man who has shown me what love looks like. But my brain is telling me to go, because I can’t keep pulling him around. He does not go out and shop with me, he doesn’t like to walk/hike with me, he hates crafts and painting which is a big hobbie of mine. I feel like I have to tuck myself away around him. We rarely do anything romantic, especially outside the house. He is very insecure and doesn’t see the potential I see in him. I push him to wasn’t to thrive and stretch his brain on what could possibly help him find a career or something that will get him out of the house more. He has no friends, he doesn’t have anyone to turn to for relationship advice. He is at the point where he is giving up on us because he feels I nag too much, which may be the case but I’m feel so ignored and sad.

He wants me to slow down and not always have something I need to do, but I’m so ADHD. No joke my brain is always in overdrive but I see that as my motivation to get things done. He hates it, he hates when we’re out and about and I remember something I need to do like an errand. He says I’m super impulsive and I need to stop trying to achieve everything all the time.

I have an 1zpresso K-Ultra that I bought on Amazon in late November 2024. When it arrived, it was supposed to be pre-calibrated, but the white dot (grind size indicator) wasn't at zero and I attempted following the instructions for calibrating the grinder per the instructions on your site. I had a really difficult time and at one point the adjustment dial was stuck and when I tried rotating it made a horrible squealing sound. Eventually I realized even though it was stuck, if I turned with enough force holding the body with with a rubber glove it became un-stuck and I followed the re-calibrating process and I thought it was resolved and working well. Turning the adjustment ring in both directions clicked as expected. I went through the process of adjusting grind until it more or less matched what I had been using with my favorite beans (I have a hario v60 pourover). I've been using it since and the coffee has been great.
    
This morning I thought to myself, maybe I should occasionally exercise the adjustment ring so that it doesn't stay at a fixed setting and get stuck again. I tightened it a few clicks, but then when I attempted to revert back to my setting (95), rather than clicking the top just started screwing off and I'm unable to adjust it now w/o the top piece unscrewing.
    
It feels like something should lock the unit in place so you can turn the adjustment ring without it unscrewing. In other words, only the adjustment ring (and consequently the burrow gap) should move. Am I doing something wrong? Is this a defective unit?

This is a little unusual, but buying a car from Nio effectively gives me access to coworking spaces around China for free.

I've confirmed with them that although their Nio Houses are the intended places to do this (though there aren't any in southern Beijing where I am), they're also happy to let people use their delivery centres too. I took a look, these centres aren't as nice as the Houses, but they're:
>Perfectly usable as a quiet place to be able to sit down and work without distractions.
>Plenty of space.
>Lots of outlets.
>Free wifi, lows of 22mbps down, 19mbps up which isn't amazing, but should be adequate.
>Free coffee and water.
>A microwave.
>Very clean bathrooms with sit down, smart toilets.
>Available across China, I occasionally travel, so this could come in useful but not too likely.
>I wouldn't have a private office, which I could pay extra for at a co-working space.
>Locations are quite good, usually not too far from decent malls etc.
>Free parking.

Doing this would save me quite a lot of effort needing to drive back home in a hurry to start work after dropping my daughter off at nursery, as well as time going back to pick her up.

Taking these factors into consideration, what montery value would you say this provides?

We've been here for a week and we are both exhausted from their boomerism. Here are some examples of it, I thought you might get a laugh out of it. 

• (this one is graphic beware) I had an emergency during this stay where I had built up puss coming out of my nose. I contacted my surgeon and he prescribed antibiotics for me to take until I come back and see him personally. So we had to go pick them up later that day (my surgeon was at a symposium so it took hours). My FIL offered to swing by the pharmacy on the way back from a restaurant. Turns out my surgeon called in my prescription by leaving a voicemail, but the pharmacy boomer employees didn't know how to work it  out, so there was a delay. My FIL is visibly and audibly annoyed at this point because he has to wait, then his wife goes buys a half-gallon of fucking ice cream to take home, lmao. And the pharmacy is now telling us the prescription is in but it takes 15 minutes to fill it. FIL is really pissed off at this point and checks their hours, to tell me that we can pick it up tomorrow. I tell him I have smelly puss building up inside my head, you know, next to my brain, and I would rather start taking my medication ASAP. But if they don't want to wait we can go back home and then my husband and I will go back and pick it, which is what we ended up doing. 

• FIL would constantly give us 2 options to pick from like we are 5 years old, except one option would be his preferred choice and another option would be the one he absolutely hated. And nothing would indicate which one he wanted us to pick, so we would pick a ""wrong"" one sometimes, which would result in him becoming distant, or even pissed off. One time we picked the wrong restaurant and it took everything in him to order something, plus the conversation was not about food at all.

• Which brings me to this point. If we went to a restaurant of his choosing they both wouldn't shut up about the food - how great it was. They brought up this pizza we had one time at least 20 times that day. Asking if we liked it every time. But if we wanted to go to in an out because we don't have one in our state, he would sit there all annoyed and eat the bare minimum just enough not to starve and would make sure he didn't show any satisfaction on his face what so ever. 

• My step-MIL was a nut case on her own. She is a typical ""agree with everything my husband says"" type of woman, the one that cleans up after him and serves him coffee and does his laundry. She even sorted our laundry because I didn't get to it soon enough. She opened the drier before it was done! To check what was dry to pull it out. Then she brought the dry stuff, including our underwear, to our room. Even I don't sort my husband's underwear, lol. We each do our own, like adults, you know. 

• When we went on road trips (which we didn't ask for btw), my FIL and my husband would sit in the front, while my step-MIL and I would sit in the back. That meant we had our own zone. If I started telling a story, clearly talking to everyone in the car, FIL would pretend he didn't realize that I was talking to everyone and would start a completely new separate conversation with my husband. Know your ""zone"", bitch. Is basically the message I got from this. 

• He talked constantly and never about anything important. Just about little towns they go to, or their neighborhood, when their trashed is picked up, which Walmart they shop at and how great it is, or they would discuss their health problems. One time I noticed he talked uninterrupted for 30 minutes, and it was about the neighboring towns which are all small and run down. 

• I don't know how boomerish this one is but he would constantly interrupt everyone. Or if you were to start telling him something, he would zone out and stop listening. 

• One night we spent looking at old photos (I asked because I like looking at old photos), they got all excited we showed interest. After we were done (about 3 hours later), I said I might have a few of my old photos on my iPad. That was ignored. The next day step-MIL brought another shoebox of photos, and when we were done with that she said she would be interested in looking at some of my old photos. I said yeah I have a few on my iPad. I shit you not I was ignored again!! She went to get something from the pantry, came back, I had my iPad ready, and nothing. I wasn't gonna insist if there was no initiative so we talked about something else and it was never brought up again. 

• Another issue was FIL's driving. He was constantly overcorrecting, jerking pedals, and worst of all - didn't use a turn signal once, even at a 4-way stop sign! Incredible. 

• And I'm not sure how to tell this one but basically they both had a problem disagreeing with anything, even small and unimportant. If one of us said we didn't like something, like Culver's, they would reluctantly agree it wasn't that good. But then they would forget and talk about how much they love Culver's. And it happened multiple times about different things. You could tell they had a hard time disagreeing while pretending they agreed. The whole dynamic between them was just fake and tense, and they transferred that onto us too. My husband and I have no issue arguing about something. We don't fight about it, we converse. It's ok to disagree. But these two were so uncomfortable, they were faking their agreement with everything. Weird shit. 

Anyway, I can go on and on about it but this is basically the bulk of the shit that happened during this trip. It was 7 years since we saw them last time and we both didn't want to go but couldn't figure out why - it wasn't anything specific, just bad vibes. It's just because we forgot what it was like the last time. Maybe we will see them again in 7 years, or 10. ",11,1740446037.0,BoomersBeingFools,11,0.87,False

i’m sure you remembered. 

it’s been six months and i still don’t understand why. i begged you to help me understand, and it tortures me everyday. everyday i think about sending you one last message asking for closure, comfort, anything. i would take absolutely anything. i can’t even imagine my future like this, i don’t want anyone else other than my best friend. so many of my dreams have been absolutely shattered without you. i would welcome you back with open arms, W.

i know you remember last year, when we rented that cabin for my bday. it was one of the most serene experiences in my life. we had long talks about some struggles and the future, and you told me you loved me more than you ever had.

this year, i didn’t even get a happy birthday message. 

W., everyday i feel like my insides are tied in knots. i will not know how to find release from this until i am dead. i wish and pray to god that he will just let me die. you discarded 1/3 of our lives like it meant absolutely nothing, and go about living like there are no strings attached. i can’t understand how someone could do this to another person, especially with such a history and attachment. there were struggles, but we both promised one another we would do whatever it took for however long it took.

i have no idea what i want now. the names Anna and Mila make me cry, the parks and coffee shops feel like graveyards, i don’t want to move away to uni alone, and a yellow house on a lake doesn’t entice me.

I got myself a gaggia classic evo pro and a DF64!

Loving them both.

I've just been playing around with some cheap Aldi barissimo beans. The pulls I got once dialing them in were great and tasted lovely.

I went out to a local roaster (gaslight coffee, Chicago) and grabbed some fresh beans. In the process of doing so they offered me a free shot of espresso. It was the most sour thing l've ever tasted. My partner took a sip and proceeded to dump it out our car window. This kinda gave me buyers remorse on the $90 worth of beans I bought but kinda stuck with them now.

Got home, dialed in their black condor and it's better than what they gave me at the roasters... but still on the acidic end. The other I bought from them is also fairly acidic.

I'm just trying to determine if this is a thing with fresh beans? Like is it possible I'm just somebody that enjoys old dried out cheap coffee beans?

I tried to break up with him last fall, but decided to give him one last chance. Unfortunately, I think I also developed the ick and can’t shake it off. One thing that became apparent is that he has a different standard for a healthy relationship, so he believes I’m overreacting or expecting too much. My main issue is a boundary I set about his jokes. That if I ask him to stop, he stops. The four times I’ve enforced that boundary, he’s gotten very defensive and nasty and then given me the silent treatment for days. It happened again a couple weeks ago after I told him I’d had an exceptionally bad day and “could we not joke around right now”.  He accused me of not accepting him. 

I decided I couldn’t excuse the obvious pattern anymore, so I told him on Friday. I was very clear and promised to give him space and to allow him to decide when and how we return belongings and what not. He keeps calling and texting with apologies, declarations of love, and begging to talk in person (he insisted on having the original talk over the phone because he “didn’t want to drive across town to get dumped”). 

I agreed to meet to give him closure, but now he’s wants to go where we had our first date. I’m trying to be as gentle yet firm as possible with him because he has very real abandonment issues. I don’t want to hurt him, but I don’t want him to think there’s still a chance.

Meet Claude 3.7 Sonnet, the latest hybrid reasoning model from Anthropic that’s flexing its cognitive muscles over at Amazon Bedrock. This is not your grandmother’s AI; Claude is what happens when high-speed text generation meets deep, thoughtful reasoning to tackle issues from complex coding to intricate data analyses.

**What's the Big Deal?**
Claude 3.7 Sonnet is like the Swiss army knife of AI models. It lets you toggle between rapid responses for straight-up questions and extended thinking mode for when you need a detailed breakdown. Imagine an AI that doesn’t just get you an answer quickly but can also lay out its thought process like a lawyer presenting an airtight case. Whether you’re crunching numbers or scripting complex code, this model is optimized to blow you away with its depth and eloquence.

**The Cost-Effectiveness Factor**
Anthropic claims that Claude can adjust the ""thinking budget,"" allowing businesses to customize how much token count—or think time—goes into each response. Translation: You choose how much you're willing to spend in time and resources for each task's precision and detail. With a max output of 128,000 tokens, it's like having a coder-concierge who can handle whiteboard sessions while you sip your morning coffee.

**What's the Real-World Impact?**
The real question, though, is how will it affect your startup battlefield? Claude could very well be the secret weapon small businesses need to level up against giants without leveling their budgets. It brings advanced AI capabilities within reach, making it possible to develop generative AI applications that are not just innovative but also practical.

And it’s not just theory—your earliest adopters are already seeing gains across fields like math, physics, and competitive coding. If Claude fulfills its promise, we’re entering an era where AI doesn’t just do your bidding—it coaches you through by demonstrating the most efficient paths.

**Join the Conversation**
So, here's the million-dollar question: Is Claude 3.7 Sonnet the silver bullet your startup's been waiting for, or just another cog in the AI hype machine? Does this model signal the rise of AI as a true collaborative partner, or is it a sign of a future where human ingenuity and machine intelligence must find a new equilibrium?

## Real-World⁣ Review: My Experiences and Observations

Having used the⁢ Sony WH-1000XM4 extensively in​ various scenarios, ‌here's my​ take‍ on their performance in 2025:

*  ‍ **Noise Cancellation: Still Top-Tier:** the noise cancellation is still remarkably effective, even compared​ to newer models that have as been released. Whether it's the‌ drone of an airplane engine, the chatter of a coffee shop, or the rumble of a train, the WH-1000XM4 creates a bubble ‌of silence. Though, ⁤very high-frequency sounds might still bleed through, especially when the ‍music⁢ volume is low.
*   **Sound ​Quality: A Matter of preference:** Rtings is correct about the bass-heavy sound signature. Out of the box, the XM4s lean towards a warmer, more bass-forward‍ audio profile. if you enjoy this⁢ kind of emphasis, you'll love them. However, if you prefer a flatter,⁤ more⁤ neutral​ sound, you can easily adjust the EQ⁣ settings using the Sony headphones Connect app. A user looking for these ⁢might search⁤ ""sony wh-1000xm4 rtings eq"".
* ​  **Comfort: Unmatched for Extended Use:** I can comfortably wear these headphones for hours without experiencing any discomfort. The earcups are spacious and well-padded, and the headband distributes weight evenly. However, some users with larger ears might find the earcups a bit shallow.
*   **smart Features: Convenient and Useful:** Adaptive ⁢sound Control automatically adjusts the noise-cancellation level based on⁣ your activity. Speak-to-Chat pauses the music when you start talking, allowing for ‍fast conversations. Wearing detection​ pauses the music when you take the headphones off. These features are convenient and generally work well, improving⁢ the overall user experience.
*   **Battery Life: More Than Enough:**⁤ The ​battery life is excellent. I consistently get ​around 30 hours of playtime with ‍noise cancellation enabled, which is⁤ more than sufficient for most‍ users.And with quick charging, you can get several hours of ⁣playtime from just a few minutes of charging.
* ‍  **Connectivity: stable and Reliable:** Bluetooth connectivity‌ is stable and ‌reliable, with minimal dropouts or⁣ interruptions. Multipoint pairing allows you to connect ‌to two devices simultaneously, which‌ is convenient for ⁤switching between your phone and⁤ laptop.

## the Competition:⁤ Are there Better Alternatives in 2025?

The headphone market is constantly evolving,and several competitors have emerged as the release of the ​WH-1000XM4. Here are a few key contenders and how they stack up:

*   **Sony WH-1000XM5:** ​The successor to the⁢ XM4, the XM5​ boasts an updated design, improved noise cancellation (especially in the⁢ higher frequencies), and better⁣ microphone quality. However,some ⁣users find the⁣ XM5 less ⁣comfortable than the XM4,and​ the foldable design of ‌the XM4 might be preferred by ⁤travelers. The review of ""sony wh-1000xm5 rtings ⁣review"" could​ prove useful when comparing these⁣ versions.
*   **Bose QuietComfort 45/Ultra:** Bose is renowned for its noise cancellation,and the QuietComfort series offers a strong option. Many users search ""rtings wh-1000xm4 vs bose"" to get an‌ answer from the comparison.While the ⁣sound quality might not be ‌quite as detailed as the XM4, the noise cancellation is exceptional.
*  ⁤ **Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless:** ‌The Momentum 4 Wireless combines excellent sound quality with effective ​noise cancellation and a sleek design. These are a worthy competitor for those looking for‍ great sound and anc.

The relationship ended due to financial irresponsibility and some concerning behavior.

Financial Issues:
	•	She had $35K in credit card debt and bought a $55K car just because she liked the color, bringing her total debt to $90K (by the time she’s done paying interest). She is also 30 and lives at home with no real expenses or rent. 

	•	She was earning around $21K/year as a realtor and hadn’t sold a house in 4 months.

	•	She didn’t know how to pay off her credit card and couldn’t clearly explain how she accumulated so much debt when I asked her

	•	She spent on unnecessary luxuries like $60/month culligen water delivery and two gym memberships while drowning in debt. I also tried to help set up a monthly budget and she refused 3 times as she didn’t want to show me her banking which makes me think there was more debt she was hiding. I only knew of the 35k and car because she told me. She would also say that she didn’t have bad spending habits despite the debt. And she would always say she is a self made woman while she lives at home and is actively losing money everyday. 

	•	I helped her get a debt consolidation loan and set up a meeting for her to see a financial planner, but she was defensive and emotional about it and came home crying as he told her she needed to double the amount of houses she sold 

	•	She has a pattern of instability — failed her real estate exam 8 times, has 6 speeding tickets, and has been fired from 3 jobs.

Reckless Behavior:

She ran a red light last week to get to me faster.
Once flipped off a cop while we were driving. And she constantly blurs boundaries with other men and engages and seeks out conversations with them and says she is networking for clients. 

She also went out for coffee with an old tinder flame and said they were friends. She didn’t tell me until a month later. And I voiced this saying I felt uncomfortable about it. And then she asked if she could call him on the phone a few weeks later. 

Despite all this, I cared deeply about her. She started making some changes, but only after a lot of pressure from me. I felt like I was becoming her financial coach instead of her partner.

1ixievh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ixievh/im_starting_to_dislike_my_friend_after_she_moved/,"I’m starting to dislike my friend after she moved in with me, help","I (23f) live in a four bedroom apartment with my sister (18f) and two of my close friends (both 23f). My sister, one of our friends (she’s on vacation so she wasn’t she when the new roommate moved in and will be back in a few weeks) and I have been living together for over a year and it’s been smooth sailing, besides some moldy food in the fridge once in awhile, which happens.

Our other friend (gonna call her Lucy) moved in with us in Christmas after her old lease ended. I’ve been friends with her four three years now and I enjoyed spending time with her but over the last year. In the beginning it was nice because even before she moved in she would spend a lot of time at our apartment. But then the issues started.
 First it was always leaving the microwave and cabinet doors open (she’s probably leave the fridge open too if it didn’t auto close). She used to leave our microwave open when she visited too and since then we’d always remind her. It’s been three or so months and me and my other roommates continue to remind her to close the doors, we’ve talked to her about it. We got a whiteboard for the fridge and wrote reminders for her. I know it’s a silly thing, it’s just doors but it bothers all of us. It’s even worse when she leaves drawers open because they’re at shin level. 

Along with that when she cooks, she leaves a mess on the kitchen counter and strove. We don’t have a lot of space so we use drying mats and she never moves them out of the way so they have stains now. Recently we got a new one because of this and literally a day later it was stained. She spills on the floor and doesn’t wipe it. She lets the trash overflow (mind you she cooks the most and usually 80-90% of the trash is hers) and it’s usually me or my sister throwing it out. I feel like it’s common courtesy to throw the trash out when you see it’s full/ you add the last thing that makes it full. 

She leaves her dirty dishes in the sink and on the coffee table. My other roommates and I don’t spend time in the living room so it’s mainly her on the couch always and theres always crumbs and wrappers after she snacks. 

We have four main cabinets/shelves we use for storing our food. Once shelf for each person. But my shelf has the spices so we just put them there but she puts other things of hers in it and when I asked her if she could put it in her section she said she didn’t have space. Like?? When do I put my food then?? I literally have nothing in the cabinets besides sugar and spices because I don’t have space. 
Before she moved in we had also split the fridge and kept it neat and organised but she buys so much food compared to us and fills it and it always looks messy and just annoying. Like she’d put raw chicken next to my grapes, which is such a small thing but also a health hazard. 

She never washes her dishes properly, like I wouldn’t care if they were her dishes but it also includes other dishes (since we all share some). Like there’s visible food scraps or oil and such on the corners of the dishes. The bowls are oily cause they aren’t washed properly. Worse when it’s specifically one of our personal ones. 

Yes I’ve explained this to her, told her about how we divide the cabinets and everything. She just doesn’t listen.

I know these are all small things but it’s frustrating when it builds up and I’m staring to dislike her. What makes it worse is that it’s usually me and my sister cleaning the common areas that we don’t even use often. Especially my sister, like almost every time I see her she is cleaning. This was never issue with our past roommates or our other friend who lives with us.  

I feel like we’ve brought up these issues and said these things to her so many times now that it just goes into one ear and comes out the other. 

TLDR: my friend moved in with us (all four roommates are friends) and she is very messy and lazy about cleaning common areas after use, washing dishes properly, uses a lot of the comunal storage space despite us already discussing how we share it (Multiples times). We always find ourselves cleaning and picking up after her.

1ixico8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1ixico8/revisiting_ai_scribes_whats_working_for_me_now/,"Revisiting AI Scribes: What’s Working for Me Now""","Hey all, I’m circling back with an update—some of you might’ve seen my posts a while back when I was buried in notes and started testing AI scribes. Last winter, I hit a wall: stuck late in the office during a storm, power cutting out, trying to chart a full day’s sessions with a dying laptop and a stale coffee. That was my tipping point—I dove into AI tools to claw back some sanity. Here’s my up-to-date list after months of sifting through the options.Psychiatry demands precision—our notes aren’t just checkboxes, they’re narratives—so I needed something that doesn’t stumble over the details. Most of these scribes talk a big game but falter in practice. Here’s what I’ve found:

* Freed AI  
   * Good: Quick, streamlined output.  
   * Bad: Reduced “racing thoughts” to “feels busy.”  
   * Verdict: Works for basics, not complexity.
* Heidi Health  
   * Good: Adjustable templates.  
   * Bad: “Intrusive thoughts” became “interesting thoughts.”  
   * Verdict: Promising but unreliable.
* Nabla  
   * Good: Free, fast turnaround.  
   * Bad: Notes read like texts: “Pt down. MD says meds.”  
   * Verdict: Lacks depth for us.
* DeepScribe  
   * Good: High accuracy, integrates with Epic.  
   * Bad: Setup’s overly complex.  
   * Verdict: Better for large systems than solo work.
* Augmedix  
   * Good: Real-time transcription.  
   * Bad: Feels invasive, steep cost.  
   * Verdict: Interesting but impractical.
* Notable  
   * Good: Strong voice capture.  
   * Bad: Misreads “dysphoria” as “dis-foyer.”  
   * Verdict: Not psych-ready yet.
* WAVO Health  
   * Good: Spot-on—caught “guarded tone, rapid tangents” cleanly. Templates adapt to MSEs or therapy, and the dashboard tracks mood and med shifts effortlessly.  
   * Bad: Takes a minute to process—not instant.  
   * Verdict: My current choice—handles the load well.
* Suki  
   * Good: Smooth voice commands.  
   * Bad: “Risperidone” turned into “whisper-dough.”  
   * Verdict: Amusing, not dependable.
* Twofold Health  
   * Good: Affordable, solid med lists.  
   * Bad: Summarized a 50-minute session as “Pt felt okay.”  
   * Verdict: Good for meds, weak on therapy.
* DAX (Nuance)  
   * Good: Dependable tech foundation.  
   * Bad: Dated design, high price.  
   * Verdict: Too costly for the value.

Why I’m using WAVO - Captures nuances—like a patient’s flat delivery or sudden tangent—more accurately than my rushed notes / The dashboard simplifies follow-ups—last week, it flagged a mood shift linked to a med adjustment, no chart-hunting needed / Shaves serious time off documentation—not quite half, but close enough to notice / Requires some oversight, but far less than others.

AI scribes at a glance:  

* Tools that transcribe sessions into notes, some syncing with EHRs / Strengths: Cut charting time, pick up tone or pauses, offer trend tracking when done right / Weaknesses: Mishear terms, fabricate details, or produce generic output—most suit simpler specialties, not ours.

This is my up-to-date list. Anyone else found a standout? Or a dud worth warning about? I’m all ears over this lukewarm coffee.",24,1740444988.0,Psychiatry,8,0.8,False

Standing in the self-help section, arms full of books promising to fix me. ""How to Be More Productive."" ""30 Days to a Better You."" ""Fix Your Life in 10 Simple Steps.""

Caught my reflection in a mirror nearby and had this thought: Would I ever hand these books to a friend and say ""here's how to fix everything wrong with you""?

Put everything back. Walked to the coffee shop next door. Just sat with myself. Not trying to improve anything. Not making a plan to be better. Just being there with all my flaws and struggles, the way I would with a friend who was having a hard time.

Started treating all my moments this way. When I miss a workout? Talk to myself like I'd talk to a friend who's being hard on themselves. When I make a mistake? Offer the same grace I'd naturally give someone I care about.

The shift was immediate. My shoulders relaxed. The constant pressure eased. For the first time in years, I felt like I was on my own side.

1ixi9yf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1ixi9yf/are_we_compatible_or_are_we_going_through_a_rough/,Are we compatible? Or are we going through a rough spot,"
Me ‘20/F’and my bf ‘24/M’ are having issues, could this just be a bump? Or could compatibility issues be occurring. We have been together 2 years.

Me and my man have been together almost 2 years. I’m not sure if this is just a hard patch or if things are truly falling apart. The both of us have been unhappy because it’s constant fighting. I’m a full time student and worker F 20. Along with that I’m a crazy overthinker and stress myself out so much, I haven’t learned how to control it. My bf M 24 works part time getting 20-25 hours a week, that’s if they don’t send him home early. He doesn’t have any interest in going to school unless my mother remains paying his rent. I have a very amazing mother who agreed to pay my rent until I’m out of college (I’m in my last semester). My bf M 24 does not pay rent. At the beginning it was really hard to get him back on his feet, so my mother was not worried about rent. He barely has any bills besides his phone and a lawsuit he pays monthly. I feel like I’m pulling twice amount of weight as him and it stresses me out when our home is dirty. He plays video game majority of the time he has before and after work(4h shifts). He does help clean up but in the most laziest way possible. Over the last years we have bickered no stop about how to clean food off the dishes before putting them in the dishwasher, he doesn’t see the point and continues to not rinse them off which leaves more work for me to do because almost always they never turn out clean. This is just one example of the multiple things we bicker about. It has driven me away, when I’m in a relationship I want someone to help pull the weight, someone who is ambitious about our future. We have different paths on how to succeed in life. He wants a stay at home job where he can do it on his computer, yet lacks the efforts to even do research about careers in that path. I’m scared about his work ethic, my father’s work ethic is horrible and has shown me examples of what I do not want in a relationship/ marriage. In all honesty I feel like I drifted away from him, his lack of hygiene is the worst of it. I no longer feel like this relationship will be a healthy one for me or him in the future because I’ve been unhappy for a while. My heart is telling me to hold on because we have been through so much, he is such a genuine guy. He love me, every part of me. He bends over backwards for me sometimes and has no issue sending me out with money to get a coffee or something. I can’t help but to think I put him into a depression. He is the only man who has shown me what love looks like. But my brain is telling me to go, because I can’t keep pulling him around. He does not go out and shop with me, he doesn’t like to walk/hike with me, he hates crafts and painting which is a big hobbie of mine. I feel like I have to tuck myself away around him. We rarely do anything romantic, especially outside the house. He is very insecure and doesn’t see the potential I see in him. I push him to wasn’t to thrive and stretch his brain on what could possibly help him find a career or something that will get him out of the house more. He has no friends, he doesn’t have anyone to turn to for relationship advice. He is at the point where he is giving up on us because he feels I nag too much, which may be the case but I’m feel so ignored and sad. We can’t have deep conversations, he shuts them down/ shuts himself down when I mention them. Every fight is now not being resolved or even talked about, it’s just him criticizing me. This has made me feel like I made him this way because I’m waiting so much for us. My brain is telling me let go of him, it will always be a constant battle over stupid things and what I want in life doesn’t match what he wants. He wants me to slow down and not always have something I need to do, but I’m so ADHD. No joke my brain is always in overdrive but I see that as my motivation to get things done. He hates it, he hates when we’re out and about and I remember something I need to do like an errand. He says I’m super impulsive and I need to stop trying to achieve everything all the time. But my heart says stay because I know he loves me so much. But if he loved me wouldn’t he critique the small things to help us grow together? I need honest opinions.

My wife isnt working and we have kids and bills as I'm sure most everyone can relate. The thought of failing sends me into a frenzy and my heart rate jumps to the low hundreds and I fail. Does anyone. Have any tips? Maybe some natural remedies or OTC medicine I could use. Ive tried breathing techniques and holding my breath. Its hasn't worked.
