1np89w3,https://v.redd.it/w9ffvoql73rf1,Currently out with the cargo. - Greg,"Greg Rig's early vlog for day #7 update

Time footage taken: 8:34PM - 3:56AM

Greg is on his way to a long road trip with his truck Arny and their tiny load of cargo. The cargo Arny is carrying is a small car in which Greg has not yet took a picture of it. Greg thought it was a good idea to try stay up straight for 2 days by drinking 3 cups of coffee, that didn't work out and he had to stop at a gas station to sleep early at around 4 in the morning. He won't arrive to his destination until after 4pm today.

Change one thing, break three others. Add a new condition? Good luck finding where it fits without destroying the rest.

**There's a stupidly simple trick that can replace almost any complex maze with a single number.**

*It's called bitmasking, and once you see it, you can't unsee it.*

Let's say you're building a customer order system.

**Customers can order:**

* Coffee or Tea (drinks)
* Croissant (food)
* Any combination of the above

Your brain immediately goes to this:

    IF drink = ""coffee"" AND food = ""croissant"" ‚Üí Action A
    IF drink = ""tea"" AND food = ""empty"" ‚Üí Action B  
    IF drink = ""empty"" AND food = ""croissant"" ‚Üí Action C
    IF drink = ""coffee"" AND food = ""empty"" ‚Üí Action D

**This is a nightmare.**

The workflows tend to look like this:

https://preview.redd.it/izsqyhsb03rf1.png?width=1052&format=png&auto=webp&s=814b2f15a18de4b22340c093d66c4781d911dfd7

Add one more drink option? You just doubled your conditions. Add a sandwich option? You've now got 12 different combinations to track.

**What if I told you there's a way to represent every possible combination with just one number?**

*All serious engineers know about bitmasking. Now is the time flowgrammers adopt this idea!*

Here's the secret sauce:

**Step 1: Give each choice a ""power of 2"" value**

* Coffee =¬†**1**
* Tea =¬†**2**
* Croissant =¬†**4**

**Why these specific numbers?** Because they're magical. You literally cannot create the same sum with different combinations.

https://preview.redd.it/rwwzzroh13rf1.png?width=1293&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad5b731093db10cfb13f79481c1f89dc58ce77b9

**Step 2: Add up whatever the customer chooses**

* Just coffee?¬†**1**
* Just tea?¬†**2**
* Tea + Croissant?¬†**2 + 4 = 6**
* Coffee + Croissant?¬†**1 + 4 = 5**
* Everything?¬†**1 + 2 + 4 = 7**

**Every combination gets its own unique ""fingerprint"" number.**

**Step 3: Replace your spaghetti logic with a simple switch**

Instead of 8 complex IF/THEN branches, you get:

* Number = 1 ‚Üí Coffee path
* Number = 2 ‚Üí Tea path
* Number = 4 ‚Üí Croissant path
* Number = 5 ‚Üí Coffee + Croissant path
* Number = 6 ‚Üí Tea + Croissant path
* Number = 7 ‚Üí Everything path

**One number. One switch. Done.**

**Here's how it looks in action:**

Watch how each combination automatically generates its unique number, and the workflow instantly knows which path to take. No complex logic, no nested conditions

https://reddit.com/link/1np87mt/video/i615z9eg23rf1/player

This isn't just for order systems. **Bitmasking works anywhere you have multiple independent choices:**

* User permissions (read, write, delete, admin)
* Feature flags (dark mode, notifications, beta features)
* Survey responses (multiple selections)
* Game states (inventory items, character abilities)
* Email preferences (newsletter, promotions, updates)

**Once you see this pattern, you'll spot it everywhere.**

*The craziest part? This technique is older than the internet, but most flowgrammers today have never heard of it.*

# Try It Yourself

Next time you catch yourself building complex conditional logic, stop.

Ask yourself: **""Could I assign each choice a power-of-2 value and just add them up?""**

**Too lazy to figure out the math?** Just ask ChatGPT or Claude: ""I have these 5 choices \[list them\]. Can you create a bitmask system for me?"" They'll spit out the power-of-2 values and all possible combinations in seconds.

I‚Äôm M25, originally from Indore but grew up in Dubai with a short stint in blr/hyd. i work remotely in startups (dating apps and gaming), so most days i‚Äôm on my laptop with the occasional coffee break. i‚Äôm moving back to indore soon and bringing my cat with me, so i‚Äôm looking for a pet-friendly flatmate to share a 2bhk (since I couldn't find very nice 1BHKs)

most of the better flats i‚Äôve found are in vijay nagar or scheme 140, and it makes much more sense to split rent than keep negotiating with my cat every month. if you‚Äôre chill, responsible, and comfortable around a cat, we might be a good fit. P.S the rent I'm estimating is around 13-15k per person.

also, even if you‚Äôre not house-hunting, i‚Äôd love to connect with folks in indore, whether to hang out, grab coffee, or even work on something interesting together.

A few months ago, a friend of mine (an interior designer) was complaining about how slow and tedious it was to add his studio's logo to dozens of renders for his new portfolio.

To help him out, I quickly built a simple, fast web tool to do it all right in the browser. No installs, no nonsense. It worked so well that his entire team ended up dropping their old software and switching to my app.

Seeing how useful it was for them, I decided to polish it up and release it for everyone to use, completely free.

It's called **Watermark Add**. Key features:

* ‚úÖ **100% Free** (supported by a ""Buy me a coffee"" link)
* ‚úÖ **Fast & Secure:** Everything happens in your browser, your images are never uploaded.
* ‚úÖ **No sign-up required.** Just drag, drop, and download.
* ‚úÖ **Batch processing.**

Today is a huge day for this little project ‚Äî I've just launched it on Product Hunt!

**Here is the link to the Product Hunt launch page:**

When you first hear the name Raspberry Pi, you might think of dessert. But no ‚Äì this ‚ÄúPi‚Äù won‚Äôt fill your stomach, it will fill your brain. A credit card‚Äìsized computer, Raspberry Pi is proof that big software magic can live inside small hardware. It‚Äôs cheap, tiny, and yet capable of things that make you go: ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ this small thing can do THAT?‚Äù

The Magic Inside the Pi

The true power of Raspberry Pi lies in its software ecosystem. Out of the box, you can run:
Linux-based OS (Raspberry Pi OS) ‚Äì A full desktop on a tiny board.
Programming environments ‚Äì Python, Java, C, even Scratch for kids.
Servers & Tools ‚Äì Run a web server, media center, or even your own cloud.
It‚Äôs like a box of LEGO for coders ‚Äì you can build whatever your mind imagines.

Why People Love It

Here‚Äôs the thing: Raspberry Pi is not just for ‚Äútech nerds.‚Äù It‚Äôs for anyone who likes experimenting.
Want to learn coding? Pi makes it fun.
Want to create a retro gaming console?
Pi can do it.
Want to set up a home security system? Pi will guard your snacks.
Want a personal AI assistant? Pi says, ‚ÄúHey Siri, step aside.‚Äù
It‚Äôs cheap enough for students, powerful enough for hobbyists, and flexible enough for professionals.

The Funny Side of Raspberry Pi Software
The community around Raspberry Pi is half genius, half comedy. You‚Äôll find projects like:
A Pi-powered robot that brings you coffee (and spills half of it).
A Pi that tweets whenever the fridge door is opened.
A smart mirror that insults you if you don‚Äôt go to the gym.
It‚Äôs proof that coding doesn‚Äôt always have to be serious ‚Äì it can be playful, weird, and surprisingly useful.

The Future of Pi

As software evolves, Raspberry Pi keeps getting better:
More support for AI and Machine Learning.
Better IoT applications to connect your smart home.
Educational platforms that make kids fall in love with coding.
In the future, don‚Äôt be surprised if a Raspberry Pi is controlling your fridge, your car, or even your coffee machine.

Conclusion

Raspberry Pi isn‚Äôt just a small computer ‚Äì it‚Äôs a playground for ideas. It teaches us that innovation doesn‚Äôt need big money or giant machines. Sometimes, it just needs curiosity, a little software, and a board the size of a biscuit.
So next time someone asks what you do with a Raspberry Pi, you can proudly say: ‚ÄúEverything‚Ä¶ except eating it.‚Äù ü•ßüíª",1,1758708317.0,robotics,0,1.0,False

How do you manage after getting your appetite back?,"Hey everyone, I'm not sure if this is the place to talk about this but I am feeling really good lately and I wanted to share it. I (F28) have have an ed for like ten years but its been mostly under control unless my mental health really falls. But lately I've really been working on myself, my mental health, my life and in that journey I'm trying to regulate my eating schedule, cortisol levels, etc. For the longest time I haven't had any appetite at all and I don't like that. I used to feel so sick and yuck when I ate, but now I can feel the food nourishing my body. I want to keep that up. 

I've cut coffee entirely, which I used to drink all day which was suppressing my appetite more. I do treat myself to a matcha every now and again though, but not first thing in the morning. (Cutting coffee has helped me so much to relieve my overwhelming anxiety too! But this isn't about that). I have been getting up in the morning and going for a walk before work, eating breakfast after I get to work, not having coffee, making sure I eat something before my cigarette, and guess what - it's working! 

My appetite has started to come back very recently and I don't know how to manage it. I feel like wake up hungry, when I eat I am still hungry a while after, I'm looking for snacks in the day and I am looking forward to dinner. My question is, is it normal to be so hungry? Does everyone feel this way? My friend told me I should eat more.. but I feel like I already am. How do you satisfy the hungry feeling without going broke? Sorry if this is a weird question/story but I really haven't been so connected to my stomach and body for such a long time and I want to keep nourishing it correctly so I don't lose myself again!

Anyway, I was feeling kinda down about it, especialy becausse I hate when there's tension between us. Life's too short, y'know? In the midxle of all this, I had a super hectic day lined up at work with this massive presentation that was making me anxious as heck. It was all I could think about and, tbh, I was dreding it. 

The next morning, I woke up to a soft, handwritten note on my coffee mug. It read something smple yet so powerful, ""I love you‚Äîeven when we disagere. You've got this, and I've got you ‚ù§Ô∏è."" It alnost made me tear up, just knowing he took the time to think about how he could lighten my burden, just a little, on a day I neeedd it most.

Later that day, while I was at work, he went ahead and handled a bunch of chores I was stressed abouut that week. I came home to folded launrdy, cleaned dishes, and a warm dinner he'd made. I hadn't asked for any of it, he'd just done it‚Äîlike a quiet hero, making amens in his own way.

Context: Invited girl I just met out for a meal/coffee.  
Meal: She orders a ton of good food. Total bill $85.

I'm someone who's generous. Am ok with treating someone i want to connect with for the 1st time provided the bill is within $50. (standard coffee/bubble tea/simple meal i pay without looking)

However, anything more than $50 I need to access whether I'm being exploited (Are you here because you want to develop a deeper connection with me OR just for the free food and lifestyle then run?):

Scenario 1. She shows up, puts in effort to get to know me  
\-interacts, banter  
\-asks deep questions  
\-answers with deep thought  
\-respects me gives me her attention  
\#man paying the bill is a good gesture

Scenario 2. she shows up with ""just friends"" energy  
\-uses her phone to reply others, scrolls ig, tik tok  
\-doesn't put in effort to ask me deeper questions  
\-answers my qns at a very surface level. doesn't share much about herself.  
\-shows disrespect/neutral  
\#splitting the bill is the clean and respective move (cos i respect your independence and gender equality)

Need some input on this and what is a respectful and good way to get scenario 2 to pay up?  
\-some women have this entitled mindset ""you ask me out you pay""  
\-well I'm not some sohai or simp  
\-i'm not here to be exploited if you're just showing up for a free atas meal ($80)  
\-zero effort put in to get to me & disrespect shown  
\-i'd rather spend $100 on a bro or sister who've helped me in some way to show gratitude than blow it on a woman who's out to exploit me

Additional input:  
\-i make more than 200k a year  
\-money is not an issue  
\-i just dislike being exploited and used by women (the feeling is terrible)  
\-i'm not a sohai

Testing out the Golden Care GT105 Teak Shield became a bit of a ritual for me over the past month. Let‚Äôs face it, teak furniture deserves a little TLC, and this product seemed like just the thing to keep my patio set looking flawless. As someone with zero patience for obsessive upkeep, I was intrigued by the promise of protection against food stains, wine spills, and the mysterious olive oil smudges that always seem to appear at outdoor dinners. Spoiler alert‚Äîit did a solid job, though not without some quirks.  

**Design and Practicality**  
Teak Shield‚Äôs sleek, minimalistic packaging was my first impression. The 1-liter bottle feels substantial without being overkill, and the design of the dispenser ensures you won‚Äôt accidentally pour half the bottle in one go. The liquid itself has a smooth consistency‚Äînot overly thick but just enough to spread evenly. There‚Äôs no overpowering chemical smell, which I appreciated as I applied it to my outdoor table. Let me just say, the lack of strong fumes makes this product much easier to use than others I've tried. Is it glamorous? No, but practicality trumps design in this case, and Golden Care nailed it.  

**Application Process**  
My initial worry was whether applying the teak shield would turn into a day-long chore, but it was surprisingly straightforward. The instructions are clear, and the polish dries quickly, which was a blessing since I‚Äôm impatient by nature. I applied it with a microfiber cloth, and the liquid spread evenly without leaving streaks or residue. The fact that no assembly or additional tools are required makes this ideal for people like me who hate overcomplicating simple tasks.  

[Ready to snag Golden Care GT105? See Amazon‚Äôs price.](https://agegene.com/link/b00ecgbauw/)  

**Positives**  
While using this product, several key benefits stood out to me:  

- Creates a nearly invisible yet effective protective barrier against common stain makers, such as wine, coffee, or butter.  
- Dries quickly, sparing you the horror of accidentally smudging the surface mid-application.  
- Emits no harsh chemical odors, making the experience more comfortable.  

**Efficiency and Performance**  
After the first application, I ran some unscientific tests. I spilled a small amount of red wine on the surface‚Äîthough it pained me to waste wine for science‚Äîand it wiped off effortlessly, leaving no residue or discoloration. Coffee and olive oil met a similar fate during future experiments, reaffirming the product‚Äôs reliability in creating a stain-resistant surface. However, I noticed that extremely heavy or greasy stains require quicker cleanup to avoid any slight trace being left behind.  

**Negatives**  
A few limitations became apparent over time, though none of them were deal breakers for me:  

- Overuse might leave the teak surface slightly slippery, so measuring applications carefully is crucial.  
- Offers less durability in high-moisture areas, as heavy rain seems to slightly dull the protective layer.  
- While effective on teak, its versatility might not extend well to other wood types.  

**Market Rivals**  
Compared to other contenders in the market, such as Star brite's Premium Teak Care Kit or Better Boat Teak Oil, this product holds its ground with unmatched ease of use. Star brite offers a more comprehensive system involving both cleaner and oil, but that adds complexity compared to the streamlined process with Golden Care GT105. On the other hand, traditional teak oils like Better Boat provide richer nourishment into the wood grains, but they require more frequent reapplication. This teak shield wins in terms of convenience and stain resistance, but some might miss the deep conditioning that oils typically provide.  

**Quality for Price**  
Considering how much hassle it saves by repelling liquids and stains, I‚Äôd say the price-to-quality ratio leans highly in favor of the product. It delivers effective performance without needing constant reapplications and minimizes damage from daily use. That said, if you‚Äôre someone who prefers deep wood conditioning over surface-level protection, there could be better alternatives available for similar price points.

I have had my Flair Pro 2 for just a bit over 2 years now. Back then I was really coming into the coffee world and I just got my bearings. The learning curve on my Flair wasn't really that steep once I paired it with well-performing grinder and I enjoyed every part of the process of getting accustomed to the machine. In the past almost two years the flair has been put to the test 5 out of 7 days of the week making at least 4+ espressos a day. It is holding well and I believe that being conscious about its use I hope I can make it last for at least several more years. Possibly I just want to express my gratitude for the craftsmanship by the whole team that stays behind the Flair and made it possible! Thank you!

P.S. And also thank you for making it possible to appreciate coffee like no electric machine can do it - I have never tasted the specific texture of the espresso that is achieved by the Flair Pro 2 on any other machine. Getting to know the flow profiles and customizing as much as you want even during the pulling of the shot is another supreme advantage when you ""learn"" coffee.

The only reason I‚Äôd want to push for 10 days outside of accomplishment is autophagy.

Fasting electrolytes 2-1 1/4tsp
Per4m hydration electrolytes- 1 scoop mixed with a squeeze of mio energy (this is for during and after my incline walk)
Magnesium capsules at night
Multivitamin with my warm salt water (morning and evening)

* That Saga's memories of her having her have to live in a trailer park because that's part of the economic depression angle. Being a single mom sucks, especially when you're taking leave from the FBI.
* Pat Maine's entire come apart and the realization even if he is being messed with, it's also just plain dementia too.
* The fact the Bookers are going to have at least one of them murdered and probably both just because they came here to do a podcast and you can't do anything for them.
* The lady trying to beat down the door in the Elderwood Lodge and you never find out what her deal is.
* The realization that Jaako's cute kids in the coffee costumes are orphans and that was because Ilmo taunted Scratch (who is just Alan Wake pissed off).
* The letter in the Rental Cabins that a little boy's friend is dead and he knows it.
* The trio outside the Lodge where one goes into the woods and disappears and the others increasingly realize she's dead.

Now the way I cope with this feeling is to sometimes be makulit like i would make jokes, tease, and send her bunch of funny videos.. And then nung Monday Sept 22, nagsabi na sya na hindi ko man lang daw sya namiss etc. And I told her na hindi naman sa hindi ko sya namiss and inexplain ko naman yung nangyayari sa akin that time.. Hanggang sa hindi na nya ako kinakausap, she just continued working (wfh kami both), and after non she took a break and do other stuffs like manuod sa tiktok. As in iniisnob nya ako. And then si ako, sinuyo ko sya paulit ulit, and nag explain pa rin ako, ang sabi lang nya sakin na wag ko nalang daw sya kulitin kung hindi ko naman sya nilalambing.. Edi naiyak na ako that time kasi syempre im doing my best para maging okay kami. Tapos naupo ako sa table ko, nag journal ako.. And ayun parang may part sa akin na nagsnap ako.. so ginawa ko sinabi ko sakanya na mag cool off muna kami (para mag self reflect din) edi di sya kumikibo.. umiiyak ako habang sinasabi ko yun sakanya, and ramdam ko na umiiyak sya. I went out na muna to grab coffee, mag muni muni muna kasi tapos naman na yung work ko. And then umuwi ako, natulog and after that I tried talking to her again tapos ayun‚Ä¶ hindi na nya ako kinakausap.. Ako kasi anxious person ako, so parang di ako pumapayag hanggat di kami nagkakausap (tho i always give her few minuteskasi avoidant sya) and then sabi nya gusto na raw nya makipag break keme keme.. Hanggang sa nauwi na sa sigawan at sakitan. Ang sabi ko sakanya sabihin nya sakin kung bakit at anong ginawa ko, na bakit parang ponapakita nya sakin na ang hirap ko mahalin dahil sa disorder ko. Hanggang sa bigla nalang sya umiiyak, na nasasakal na raw sya kasi ayaw ko sya hayaan na umalis nang hindi kami nag uusap.. na bare minimum lang daw yung mga gusto Nya, hindi ko pa magawa (mind you I constantly ask her if napprovide ko ba yung gusyo nyang way ng pagmamahal), na kesyo di naman daw nya kailangan nung iba, yakap lang keme keme. Ayun nag snap na rin ako.. To cut it short, nag away kami malala.. pero.. sa aming dalawa sya yung iyak ng iyak, na nakaupos sa sulok na para bang sasaktan ko sya (nagkasakitan kami that time tho usually sya lang ang nananakit pag nag aaway kami kasi nga ayaw nya raw, kahit na gusto ko makipag usap lang kahit di naman talaga sya nagsasalita pag nag uusap kami) basta galit na galit sya sakin to the point na sumisigaw na sya na tinatawag nya parents nya na sana mamatay nalang daw na nakakasakal daw ako.. ako inaask ko sya paulit ulit na hindi ko sya inaano.. im trying to calm her down para makapag usap kami.. ayun ayaw nya talaga edi hinayaan ko muna.. maya maya lumapit ulit ako.. nagsosorry ako.. ang sabi nya sakin ayaw na raw talaga nya na kesyo di nya alam kung mahal pa nya ako, gusto na raw nya makawala, etc. ako ginawa ko.. nag beg ako.. tangina nag sorry ako kasi may disability ako na hindi ko kontrolado.. ako yung nag beg para lang hindi nya ako iwanan.. long story short huminahon na kami.. and wala akong narinig na sorry mula sakanya.. na para bang utang na loob ko na naging okay kami.. yun lang sorry minadali konyung dulo kasi naiiyak ako, at naaawa ako sa sarili ko.. pero tanga rin kasi ako, at mahal ko pa.",0,1758706659.0,MayConfessionAko,1,0.5,False
1np7qed,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1np7qed/dirty_intermittent_fasting_because_perfect/,Dirty Intermittent Fasting - because perfect protocols are overrated,"# The DTiF Philosophy: Dirty Intermittent Fasting

**Core Principle:** Consistency at 80-90% beats chasing 100% perfection. Build a sustainable lifestyle, not a rigid prison.

## Key Tenets

**Smart Flexibility:** Your body doesn't flip a binary switch at exactly 12 hours. Don't count beverages - coffee with cream, tea, whatever keeps you going. Only actual food with substance matters. The mental boost from these comforts outweighs any minor metabolic cost.

**Break the All-or-Nothing Trap:** One small deviation doesn't justify torching the whole day. Don't turn coffee with cream into a pizza binge. Small slips don't erase progress - dramatic overreactions do.

**Master Hunger's Rogue Waves:** Hunger hits like rogue waves when you least expect it. Cruising along fine, then BAM, you're ""starving."" Set a 12-minute timer. Like any rogue wave, it looks massive but passes quickly. Most ""emergency"" hunger is just noise.

**Psychology Wins:** Mental freedom from flexibility often delivers better results than perfect execution with constant stress.

## The 20:4 Rolling Window System

**Your One Non-Negotiable:** Always wait at least 20 hours from when you stop eating to when you start again. This is your anchor.

**Life-Proof Eating Windows:** Your eating window flexes from 2-8 hours based on life. Aim for 4 hours baseline. Social dinner? Business lunch? Extend when needed, adjust tomorrow.

**The Simple Math Hack:** When you finish eating, subtract 4 hours - that's tomorrow's earliest start time. Done at 8 PM? Tomorrow opens at 4 PM.

**Social Freedom:** Never be the person who can't join dinner because of their ""eating window.""

## The 20-Hour Floor, Not Ceiling

**Listen, Don't Watch the Clock:** 20 hours is your minimum, not an eating alarm. Feel great? Keep riding to 24, 26, even 28 hours naturally.

**Your Body Knows:** Real hunger differs from clock-based habits. When thriving in the fasted state - clear-headed, energized, focused - why interrupt? Eat when your body actually asks for fuel.

**Natural Cap:** Most find their sweet spot between 20-28 hours. This isn't an endurance contest - it's finding your optimal daily flow.

## The 80-90 Rule

Eat well most of the time, don't stress occasional splurges. Quality fuel makes fasting easier - nutrient-dense foods keep you satisfied 20+ hours, junk leaves you fighting cravings at hour 12. That 10-20% flexibility keeps you human. Pizza happens. Move on.

## Victory Rituals

Lock in wins with non-food rewards when completing your window or hitting milestones. Podcast, walk, music, whatever sparks joy. Train your brain to celebrate the process.

## The DTiF Advantage

You're building a sustainable relationship with food that doesn't control your life. This prevents the perfectionist spiral that kills most fasting attempts. When you stop fighting the system and start working with it, everything becomes easier.

**Reality Check:** Most people fail IF because they're following someone else's perfect protocol. This is IF for humans who have shit to do.

I tried ‚Äúhustling‚Äù like scraping LinkedIn, manually finding emails, begging friends for intros. It was slow and discouraging. At one point, I calculated: at this rate, it would take me 3 years to even talk to 1,000 prospects.

Then another founder shared his outbound setup over coffee. He said:

What could be better, than a cup of cold coffee? Sipping a cup of cold coffee, while Rice Shower tells you, that she somehow managed to get migraine. 

Hello, everyone, this is the second day of trying to finish a career on a good ending with Rice Shower. Due to me, being inexperienced in such activity and having the biggest opp which targets my sweet lovely pessimist - migraine, this makes her career half impossible. Luckily I read your advises and getting through it. 

As you advised, you told me to A-rank front style. And I did. Bootleg finale champion Suzuka does that. Everything is good, except... I stayed at the pace style. My bad, will work on it on the next day. There also was an advice to use 1 more stamina card and use less 0-star ssr cards. I listened and instead of Fine Motion, which I pulled outta nowhere, I replaced it with event SSR Mejiro Dober. You won't believe me, but first 2 games were bad asf, despite not meeting a single migraine blues event. And at the third play, I said to myself ""Fuck it, I'm getting back to Super Creek, just like one person advised"". The third play was going perfect. I swear, I could've win every single race... Until my biggest opp said ""Nah, you'll lose"" and crawled into my precious daughter. (You guessed it right, it's motherfucking migraine). 

Overall, I think, I could pass it. There are 2 problems - Migraine, that I couldn't get rid of it in infirmary and myself as a trainer. I would be totally hypocrite, if I didn't put a blame to all her mood swings and other failures to myself, because - I'm still a noob and still have a long way, before I become experienced.

1np7in4,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/1np7in4/not_sure_what_to_do_with_my_favorite_sb/,Not sure what to do with my favorite SB,"I didn't want to start any new thread, but I feel I'm in a dilemma as to whether I let go of my 3-month (as of yesterday) SB or not because I am feeling that she is becoming greedy by asking for more money because she said today, with a jokingly attitude, that she wanted less coffee dates and more hotel dates! 

Great for the sex, but not when I have a budget and agreed to a certain amount of hotel dates per month and feel that now she wants to increase that amount!

I'm already paying her an allowance that is more than what my budget allows, which is why I say to let her go, but because the time with her and sex with her is great, I can't see myself letting her go...especially after the time and investment already spent on her.
Yet, although my understanding of an SB is having a SD and allowance (ppm) as a subsidiary income to what she already earns, yet I am questioning whether I‚Äôm becoming the main income source for her!

The other part of this dilemma is that while she seems to be pressing me for money, she's also frequenting the same app that we had met on, most likely to find someone else for ppm.  If it's a harmless one-time coffee or dinner, I'm fine with that, but I don't like the thought of having to share her.  When I asked a few weeks ago about her about her being on the app, she had said that if someone propositions her for sex at a reasonably large sum, she will take it!
She didn‚Äôt say whether she‚Äôs just looking for someone to buy her dinner or coffee. As for how she looks, she‚Äôs not glamorous at all, although I really like her style, which isn‚Äôt really something that I think most guys would go for‚Ä¶anyway..

Is it possible...I suppose so...that some women would be okay with having sex with the same person but not have any feelings for them?  And, no matter how much I try to win her affection, am I just ""a customer"" to her!? 
By the way, her mom and sister know about me, but I don't know if that helps me in any way, as to not being ""a customer"", but her way of feeling more intimate with me, because I think she talks about me in a positive way.

So, I have this jealousy issue -- which I cannot help and am not sure if I'm alone or not -- but as she searches for someone else, if it's just a coffee or dinner, I'm fine with it, but I don't want to share the intimacy with someone else, or worse, feel that I'm going to be replaced!

I had once asked her about being exclusive, but she refused. I do wonder if I should ask again, but rephrase the question as being intimately exclusive (exclusive, meaning that we are the only ones who have sex together), and see if there's any change in her reply. As mentioned, her going out on a ""platonic"" date with someone off the app is fine, but I suspect that may not be the case because, although I have come across some SB POTs that do just that, it's one thing I cannot trust without preparing myself for the worst when asking her about it.

Another thing related to the jealousy issue is that I have a care for her well-being, which is another reason why I cannot see myself let her go, and if she were to come across the wrong person from the app she frequents, I don't know what to do because I would not be able to help her -- and have nothing to say, other than wishing she stuck with me and not take those risks.

Well, as I suspect that I'm overthinking, I am hoping that getting some feedback from the bowl can at least help clear my mind to decide what the next step will be.

Again, I may be overthinking and nothing may ever come of this and the SB and I will be dandy...but I think I should prepare myself for the worst and am worried that it is coming...despite the fact that she KNOWS HOW MUCH I CARE for her (but she really says nothing to me) and that I really want our relationship to continue for a long period.

While these drinks bring comfort and joy, they can have a lasting impact on your teeth and overall oral health. If you are looking for trusted **Dental Care in Manikonda**, it is important to understand how these beverages affect your smile and what you can do to protect it.

# Coffee and Your Teeth | Dental Clinic in Manikonda

Coffee is one of the most consumed beverages worldwide, but it is also one of the top culprits behind tooth staining. The dark pigments, known as tannins, seep into the tiny grooves of your enamel, causing teeth to appear yellow or dull over time.

In addition to staining, coffee is acidic in nature. Frequent exposure to this acidity can weaken enamel, making teeth more vulnerable to cavities and sensitivity. A professional cleaning at a **Dental Clinic in Manikonda** can help remove these stubborn stains and restore the natural brightness of your teeth.

# Tea and Oral Health | Oral Care in Manikonda

Many people consider tea to be a healthier alternative to coffee, but it also contains tannins that lead to staining. Black tea, in particular, is known to discolor teeth even more than coffee. Green tea may cause a different kind of stain, giving teeth a grayish tone.

Beyond staining, some teas are acidic, which can contribute to enamel erosion. Regular dental check-ups and good **Oral Care in Manikonda** are essential to keep tea stains under control and to prevent long-term damage.

# Wine and Your Smile | Dentist in Manikonda

Both red and white wine can impact your dental health in different ways. Red wine is notorious for staining teeth due to its rich color pigments and tannins. White wine, though less pigmented, is highly acidic, which erodes enamel and makes teeth more susceptible to staining from other foods and drinks.

Frequent wine drinkers should rinse their mouth with water after consumption and consider visiting a **Dentist in Manikonda** regularly to minimize damage and maintain a healthy smile.

# Protecting Your Smile | Dental Care in Manikonda

Here are a few preventive steps you can take if you enjoy coffee, tea, or wine:

* Rinse your mouth with water immediately after drinking.
* Use a straw to minimize direct contact with your teeth.
* Maintain consistent brushing and flossing habits.
* Visit a **Dental Clinic in Manikonda** for professional cleaning and polishing.
* Consider teeth whitening options offered by a **Dentist in Manikonda** for a brighter smile.

# Conclusion

While coffee, tea, and wine may be part of your lifestyle, they do come with consequences for your teeth. By maintaining regular **Oral Care in Manikonda** and scheduling visits with an experienced **Dentist in Manikonda**, you can enjoy your favorite beverages without compromising your smile. For expert **Dental Care in Manikonda**, trust a clinic that combines advanced treatments with personalized care to keep your teeth healthy and radiant.",1,1758705578.0,Smileworksdental,0,1.0,False

I've been using smartwatches for the past few years, and I wanted to share my experience about how these devices have completely changed the way I monitor my health, especially my heart rate.

I was initially skeptical about getting a smartwatch. I mean, who needs another gadget, right? But after my doctor recommended keeping track of my heart rate during exercise, I decided to give it a shot. I found a great deal on this smartwatch (https://athometouch.com/smartwatch) and honestly, it's been a game-changer.

The continuous heart rate monitoring has helped me understand my body better. During workouts, I can see when I'm pushing too hard or not hard enough. It's like having a personal trainer on your wrist! The data helps me maintain my target heart rate zone, which has improved my cardio fitness significantly.

But it's not just about exercise. These devices track your resting heart rate throughout the day, which can be a crucial indicator of overall health. I've noticed patterns I never would have caught otherwise - like how my heart rate spikes after my morning coffee or stays elevated when I'm stressed at work.

The sleep tracking feature is another massive benefit. It monitors your heart rate while you sleep, helping you understand your sleep quality and patterns. I've actually improved my sleep habits based on this data.

What really surprised me was the emergency features. Many smartwatches can detect irregular heart rhythms and send alerts if your heart rate goes too high or low. This feature alone gives me peace of mind, especially since my dad has a history of heart problems.

If you're on the fence about getting one, I'd highly recommend checking out this model (https://athometouch.com/smartwatch). It's user-friendly and has all the features I mentioned, plus more.

But here's the thing - while smartwatches are amazing tools for heart rate monitoring, they shouldn't replace regular medical check-ups. I still see my doctor regularly, but now I can show them detailed data about my heart rate patterns, which helps them better understand my overall health.

The battery life on most modern smartwatches is pretty decent too. I typically charge mine every couple of days, usually while I'm showering or getting ready in the morning.

For anyone interested in taking better care of their health or starting a fitness journey, a smartwatch can be an incredibly motivating tool. The real-time feedback and data tracking have helped me stay accountable and make better health decisions.

Remember, though, that not all smartwatches are created equal. Look for ones with accurate sensors and good reviews. Your health is worth the investment!

I never thought I'd be this person raving about a piece of tech, but the benefits have been too good not to share. Anyone else here using a smartwatch for health monitoring? I'd love to hear your experiences!",1,1758704983.0,AskHome,0,1.0,False

I blocked him even though my bf didn‚Äôt want me to, and we had a huge fight after.

Context:

 Me and my boyfriend have been together for almost 6 months now. We started slow, really trying to get to know each other ‚Äî strengths, weaknesses, everything. We met on a gay hookup app. He‚Äôs had very few serious relationships but was really exposed to hookup culture. He would pay someone for sex then move on. From the start, he was honest with me about his past. He even told me about his past FUBU whom he still has some kind of connection with up until now. That FUBU lasted about 8 years, and they were even high school buddies before reconnecting in adulthood. But that guy is already partnered (not married, but with kids).

When I first heard about all this, I really thought about whether I should continue seeing him. I was scared he might tolerate cheating, scared he‚Äôd go back to hookup culture. But eventually, I decided not to let his past define him. He reassured me too, and he‚Äôs made effort to build my trust. He even gave me his phone passcode. I would sometimes open his hookup apps for fun and scroll through past messages. At first, I thought it was okay since he didn‚Äôt strongly oppose it.

Then this happened: we were hanging out at a coffee shop like usual, my phone was charging so I used his to scroll on social media. Suddenly, a message notification popped up saying: ‚Äúsend 300 gcash pls hahahah‚Äù. I got curious and asked who it was. Turns out it was his past for-hire hookup.

Honestly, it didn‚Äôt bother me at first since it was in the past naman diba. I checked their conversation and saw na they‚Äôre not in any serious connection anymore. I even messaged his for-hire as a joke, we laughed about it, and after that I told my bf I would block the guy ‚Äî and I did. He immediately said no, but I was already in motion na.

He got upset because apparently they‚Äôre ‚Äúfriends na‚Äù and he didn‚Äôt want to make it look like he was just blocking someone because of me. I was upset too, but I quickly resolved it by unblocking the guy. After that, I sat quietly. Nag-tampuhan kami and we ended up talking about it in the car.

Things escalated when I tried to explain myself. I understood why he was upset ‚Äî I crossed his boundaries, and of course, he felt like I didn‚Äôt respect him. I apologized sincerely and tried to talk it out, but he just got angrier. He vented for an hour, and I just listened without defending myself. Still, it wasn‚Äôt enough for him.

I got frustrated and kept asking what I should do for him to forgive me, but he just said I should give him time and maybe he‚Äôd give me a chance again. I understood, but it really hurt me. He kept saying he didn‚Äôt feel like I was genuinely sorry or listening. He even brought up being tired and maybe this relationship not being for us anymore.

I was so frustrated because no matter what I said, he wouldn‚Äôt believe me anymore. Now, I don‚Äôt know what to do. I really want us to go back to how we used to be, but I feel like he‚Äôs slipping away.

What do you think, Was I wrong for blocking his past hookup even if I thought I was protecting us? Or am I just too controlling?

1np78ps,https://i.redd.it/mr2ddhdpv2rf1.jpeg,Trying to give the ‚Äòmean girls‚Äô actual personalities part 1,"In all seasons except maybe season 3 but there‚Äôs Lily so idk. There has been a girl who‚Äôs after you no matter what li route you choose. Allegra, Lottie, Lexi, Kat, Ivy, Summer until she‚Äôs replaced by a merged personality villa girl, the list goes on. Now I‚Äôm not going to touch on season Allegra and Lottie since I think those two are fine as is. 

Allegra acts the way she does due to her ex cheating on her with his personal trainer. She‚Äôs nice from the start but with her trust issues from her last relationship rising once the boys are involved, specifically, Mason, she‚Äôs looking out for any girl trying to get in her way of finding love. She doesn‚Äôt fully trust mc even if we say we aren‚Äôt interested in Mason as she views us as a threat that will steal her man away just like the personal trainer. She doesn‚Äôt want to be hurt again so she‚Äôs doing everything she can to keep Mason to herself. She doesn‚Äôt fully trust break up with Mason at some point and goes with either Jasper or Miles even if they don‚Äôt work out either. She‚Äôs mean to us with full honesty instead of being a snake which is good and refreshing from nice characters. In cherrygate she‚Äôs sympathetic to us with her experience of being cheated on and has our back like everyone else. If she was written in today‚Äôs fusebox she would be shitting on mc for it so thank gosh.

Lottie is either our enemy, frenemy, or friend depending on how we treat her, giving us the choice on how we interact with her. She‚Äôs still our main enemy since all her actions by the writers are intended to make us dislike her. But she has moments that make us feel bad for her like Roocogate and moments that make us like her personality wise like her banter. Plus points for talking about her interests and not being about boys all the time. Coffee. Extra plus points for having an enemies to lovers route even if it‚Äôs at the after party for the most part.

Lily. I‚Äôll be honest I don‚Äôt know much about Lily since I haven‚Äôt finished looking up season 3.


Now before I start I want to state that I‚Äôm only doing mean girls that the writers intend to be antagonists. So any fake best friends or our sister is out since they genuinely believe they wrote nice characters when they wrote actual assholes.

Lexi (Bombshell)

Now I think personally she was kind of a wasted opportunity. An actor with insecurities who‚Äôs hooked on Kobi, thinking they can win the game together because she thinks she‚Äôs the best. She thinks about herself first to become more famous and hates it when anything bad about her personal life is brought up. She thinks herself as the leader of the girls when they all just want to relax. Now I‚Äôm not sure if her looking out for the girls is her way of actually trying to care for them but does it in a way that looks mean or she‚Äôs doing it for her own benefit again and trying to make everyone follow her example. Either way it‚Äôs clear she wanted to come on top to brush away the things she hates about herself such as her name Lexi Longnose. Once she gets eliminated she automatically gets pissed that things didn‚Äôt go her way. Her way to prove she‚Äôs the best now gone. Her last resort was trying to ride off the fame of the potential winner or Thabi.

Honestly they could have done a bit more before she was eliminated. At the after party she let go of Kobi to allow him to test out who he likes more between her and Juliet. She‚Äôs more mellowed out compared the first time we see her. This could have been done during her stay in villa. Explore the dynamics between Juliet, Kobi, and Lexi. Have Lexi open up to mc due to losing her grasp on Kobi. Then get her dump around the mid game or early late game. If this were to be implemented into the game then the problem would be Najuma since there‚Äôs no reason why anybody but Kobi would vote to keep her in. It‚Äôs more believable in the Najuma route where Lexi is against Youcef but it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to make it exclusive to that route alone. I think it would be better if the episode where she got dumped wasn‚Äôt a dumping episode. I just don‚Äôt know how else to keep her in the game unless he‚Äôs always up the dumping by adding an extra boy before the recoupling and allow mc to convince everyone to save Lexi. But I‚Äôm not sure how well that would translate in the game.

So ya, just wished Lexi was touched upon more since I did like her as a character

Kat (Ex in the Villa)

She loves herself a lot to the point of narcissism or an egotistical mindset and talks about Boston. She always wants to fight when someone is after her man (Alfie to mostly Finn) or when she gets insulted. But for some reason she also can be mature by breaking up a fight in the season? But that‚Äôs honestly in a few moments of the season so I‚Äôm not sure if the writers messed up with the writing or she does have a mature side that‚Äôs overan by her ugly side. She‚Äôs insecure or scared about her relationship with Finn thinking about how she‚Äôs falling fast for him and how she might not be his type. Honestly her character direction was trying to do more but still stayed the same.

Personally I would have tried to give her more of that matureness she had sometimes and make that her main personality. Make her narcissism be more about loving herself too much as she learned to always do that in the past. As an antagonist she should be maybe more like Tori from sun kissed secrets but with rougher edges when she brings out her bad side. She does talk with the girls like a mother figure in a good way but when it comes to couples she always put herself and Finn above everyone else by putting others to shame in a way that seems like she‚Äôs trying to give advice. Then through her development or right at the end of the game she apologizes for being a bitch. A mature antagonist would have been fun.

Ivy (Double Trouble)

Fuck I wish she was a li. Anyways, this where Fusebox‚Äôs character writing starts to slowly flop. She‚Äôs the typical mean girl who goes against us and thinks she‚Äôs the prettiest girl in the villa. The only unique thing about her is her check list on what she wants in guy because she‚Äôs supposed to be a smart girl too. I‚Äôll admit she does play the mc in ways that aren‚Äôt just calling us names and trying to smash our li. The quiz challenge to take a boy on a date where we get the final question wrong because she didn‚Äôt tell us the right answer. But honestly that‚Äôs more on us because why would we trust all the girls when we could try to talk to Roberto instead. Blaming Amelia even though it wasn‚Äôt her fault. Then she gets dumped and we can help her out by exposing her merged partner isn‚Äôt really serious about her and we can see how that hurts her. She was robbed like we needed more of her.

Simply make her have more of that smart personality and manipulation that shows she‚Äôs a good game player that would make it far in another game like survivor. Make her actually more of a villain than your own sister that the game fails to do. She can keep the list thing since that was a fun bit of her character. And I know this is biased but make her a li too. I can envision a good romance with a girl who can‚Äôt find the right man who fits all her boxes when there was a girl who did all along. For development she can either grow to let go of her list and love her li for who he is or end in defeat and congratulate mc on defeating her. Something unique so the mean girl thing doesn‚Äôt go dry. Don‚Äôt eliminate her so early like seriously I don‚Äôt know why fusebox started doing that since season 4 excluding Kat.

Summer (Stick or Twist)

I mean. What do I have to say for her she‚Äôs literally just a mean girl being a fake friend. She talks about going slow in the beginning and immediately goes after the boys. She tried to trick us without thinking like what was even in her mind when she did that. Then she goes after any man we want because Fusebox got lazy even though she could have been grafting on anybody else the first sign our boy wasn‚Äôt interested in her. You‚Äôre a casa girl, you‚Äôre suppose to spread out your flirting to hopefully hook any of the boys in, you don‚Äôt got the time like the villa girls do. She only gets in the villa if you do a Rafiel route so she needed our help to even get a boy. Maybe that‚Äôs why she starts acting nicer to us. Or probably from the stress of the competition as a casa girl being over. Desperate I say.

In a rewrite she can‚Äôt be the main bad girl like it just doesn‚Äôt fit her really. I think making her those girls who only hate you if you go after their partner would fit her better. This would be with Joyo considering he picked her in the Rafiel route. Change her personality to a fun loving girl who wants to take things slow like her first impressions put her out to be. It would be a fun contrast between Joyo who wants to get it on and her wanting to do things slowly even as a casa girl. They learn from each other and grow to accept their differences. Joyo go slower and Summer getting tempted to do it from time to time with how hot Joyo gets her. Then she gets pissy when mc wants him too. If Summer is still gonna stay with the Joyo route going on then she could pair up with Alex who also likes taking things slow. This version of her would be so much better in my opinion.

Estelle/Willow/Geri/Daphne (Stick or Twist)

Major nonsense besides Geri. Estelle stated by Alex is suppose to have a friend vibe relationship with him after finding out their spark isn‚Äôt gonna go anywhere and decide they should go after other people. Willow is supposed to be calm or I guess the girl sidelined by Geri with the whole Joyo and Bryson drama. And Daphne is supposed to be the sweetheart that Rafiel fell for. How does Fusebox expect me to believe that they would act like competitve bitches against mc when their first impressions said otherwise? It‚Äôs such a lazy way to add your choices matter in the game when it‚Äôs just the choice of which girl do you like the look of better. It would have been better if they scrapped the entire thing and only make Geri the possible villa girl to act like a bitch to us since she is the only one that can fit with this personality. Less is more! If it was too much for them then why did they even bother in the first place? It makes them feel like robots. Human obstacles that only serves to spite us. One of the reasons why Stick or Twist is an awful season.

If we lived in a universe where the quality of season 1-3 never went away, we would have gotten different personalities. Estelle supporting us being with Alex and maybe acting as our wingwoman. Grow to be besties with Alex because we need more male and female best friends that doesn‚Äôt revolve around us. I‚Äôm not sure what to do with Willow besides making her be a meditating girlie who has some unresolved feelings with Bryson that you could kindly help her with so they can move on. Daphne would be heartbroken by Rafiel picking you over her and would be more bitter than sweet. She‚Äôll still act nice to the others but she can‚Äôt be that way around you even though she knows you‚Äôre just following your heart. Then she learns to accept it and wishes you two good luck. Geri would take over the merge villa personality but written better and fits with Joyo and Bryson. She should have Daphne‚Äôs placement where she always stays no matter what route you take while the girl by coupling up with Evan attached to the man you‚Äôre going for stays by coupling up with another guy. Geri would end up not getting a happy ending because I‚Äôm gonna make her toxic. Not every mean girl has to grow or show a nice side in the end. Some kind still be fun and still be a bitch. Someone fun to hate till the end.

That‚Äôs it for part 1. Will do part 2 someday with the other mean girls. Sorry if this is long, I‚Äôm just someone who likes being descriptive.",1,1758704598.0,fuseboxgames,0,1.0,False

Suddenly, an offseason filled with great promise for the Houston Rockets has transformed into one of great uncertainty. To make matters worse for the team, they have no cap space to address the now gaping hole at their point guard position. This means any solutions will have to come in-house.

Fortunately, for the Rockets and their faithful, the team does have some interesting options here. Their two best young players, Amen Thompson and Alperen Sengun, and legendary veteran, Kevin Durant, are all pretty comfortable with the ball in their hands. Shifting a greater share of the ball-handling responsibilities to them is an easy and likely effective solution, at least to fill part of the void left by VanVleet.

But is it reasonable to ask those three to handle the lion‚Äôs share of the load for an entire season? Probably not, especially if the Rockets want to have any chance of a deep run in the playoffs.

This means someone else in-house will need to step up. And the likeliest solution is a young man the team drafted just a year ago to one day assume the mantle at the position he now stands to fill today.

Reed Sheppard was drafted third overall out of Kentucky in the 2024 NBA Draft. He was in many way a darling of the draft class, drawing plaudits and superlatives from countless draft experts and basketball pundits. Former ESPN analyst, Jonathan Givony, called him the best shooter in the draft. A few thought he was the best player in the draft.

Unfortunately, Sheppard struggled mightily in his rookie season. The presence of VanVleet allowed the Rockets to bring him along slowly, and he spent most of the season on the Rockets‚Äô bench and briefly in the G League.

When he did play, the results weren‚Äôt pretty.

Despite lofty expectations as a shooter, Sheppard shot poorly last season. If you don‚Äôt include Jack McVeigh‚Äôs cup of coffee with the Rockets, Sheppard‚Äôs .351 FG% was the worst shooting percentage on the team. Nearly two-thirds of his shots were from 3-point range, where he shot just .338%. Overall, he finished just 17th percentile in eFG%, a ghastly showing from a player who was drafted on account of his shooting prowess.

If last year was any indication, the answer to the question, ‚ÄòCan Reed Sheppard save the day?‚Äô would be an astounding ‚Äúno‚Äù.

But before we settle on that conclusion, let‚Äôs dig a little deeper.

For starters, while it‚Äôs impossible to quantify the toughness and leadership that VanVleet brings to the Rockets, he too struggled as a shooter last season. His .378 FG% was second-worst on the team, ahead of only Sheppard, and his eFG% ranked only in the 27th percentile.

It‚Äôs also worth noting that VanVleet finished last season with a 12.8 PER. That‚Äôs a solidly below-average player and basically on par with disappointing third-year forward, Jabari Smith Jr. Unfortunately, Sheppard‚Äôs 9.7 PER was decidedly worse and indicative of a player who was largely out of his depth as a rookie.

This is not to say that VanVleet and Sheppard had comparable seasons ‚Äî they most certainly did not ‚Äî but let‚Äôs start by acknowledging that the replacement burden, at least statistically, is not as great as many assume here.

Sheppard absolutely needs to play better to replace even some of VanVleet‚Äôs minutes and production next season. If he is better, while regaining some of the scrappiness and effort he exhibited on the defensive end in college, then his odds of bridging the gap in meaningful ways are higher than many believe.

One last thing I want to point out about Sheppard. It‚Äôs clear the size and speed of the NBA game overwhelmed him last season. However, there‚Äôs also a chance he was overwhelmed by inconsistent playing time. His worst shooting months were the first five, when he averaged anywhere from 5-11 minutes per game. His last two months, however, when he averaged 17 minutes per game, were much better. Granted, it was only 10 games, but in them his shooting percentage improved to roughly 45% and he shot almost 50% from three. This resulted in averages of 9 points, 2 boards, and 3 assists per game ‚Äî again, in just 17 minutes.

Now, that limited sample might have be fluky. And we have to be careful making assumptions by extrapolating a player‚Äôs minutes and production. But maybe, just maybe, what Sheppard showed us late last season was a sign of better things to come.

The bulk of the void left by Fred VanVleet‚Äôs injury will likely be filled by the team‚Äôs best players. And to be completely clear, nobody ‚Äî not even Sheppard ‚Äîwill be able to replace all the intangibles VanVleet would‚Äôve brought to the team this year. But Sheppard could be a savior of sorts if he takes even one meaningful step forward as a shooter. Remember, the bar isn‚Äôt high to replace VanVleet‚Äôs shooting outputs from a year ago, and there are at least hints that Sheppard can do more when he plays more. And play more he most certainly will.",4,1758704379.0,fantasybball,0,1.0,False

(I‚Äôve (m43) been married to my wife (f41) for 15 years, known her for 17 years. For the most part they have been happy and we‚Äôve got on really well.)

Thank you to everyone who commented. We had a few chats in the week after the original post about the situation. I explained how her going behind my back plus dwelling on this past relationship made me feel.

She had said if I didn't want her to speak to him anymore, she wouldn't - I was adamant that this wasn't my call to make. She eventually said that she wouldn't speak to him anymore and that she was na√Øve to think that her and her ex could still be friends. As far as I was aware, she let him know that she wouldn't be in contact anymore because of me and he was accepting of this (I haven't seen any of their messages nor have I asked to).

A week later my mother passed away so a pin was stuck in any conversations between us but about a week ago we had a good chat in which I felt heard, mostly centring around me creating a larger social life outside the home and how we've become co-dependent on each other. I said that my trust in her has been eroded which upset her a little but she understood. We seemed to be getting back on track and I was open about my insecurities, and what I needed to work on.

Unfortunately a few days later, she seemed distracted and when I asked her what was wrong, she said she'd tell me later when the kids are in bed. This was dragged out all day and then she admitted that she was still in contact with her ex for a couple of weeks and wants to meet him for coffee. I asked what would happen if he made a move, and she said she'd be ""disappointed"". I also asked about his wife, and apparently he's separated (which she knew about before but didn't tell me). He's embarking on a new career and was asking her for advice, to which I questioned was there not anyone else in his life that could provide career advice. She also says he's had a cancer scare which also prompted her to get in touch with him again.

It's her call who she meets up with but I told her the lying has to stop. She claims it's so she doesn't hurt me but it's caused more damage by lying. She admitted that making me decide about her not talking to him anymore was ""poor"" but that I don't understand the depth of feeling that existed between them.

I don't know what to say to her and have started investigating what steps to take legally to protect myself. I'm so angry and sad, that at best, she is sacrificing a 15-year marriage to be friends with an ex she hasn't seen in 20 years, and at worst, will get back with him.

Most importantly, it should be accessible and budget-friendly, whether for students pulling all-nighters, exam-takers deep in review, or professionals in need of a change of scenery.

It was not bad experience, nothing bad happened and those girls seemed to like me....

But I could not help myself but to feel completely bizzare. Just romantically engaging myself with another person, walking in that coffee shop with her, her being attracted to me physically...

It all felt extremely bizzare and simply not for me. I felt that extreme weird sadness, almost repulsivity, not towards them but towards that concept of dating, relationships, just being close to another person outside of my own internal universe. I just thought ""why am I doing this?"", ""what am I doing and what am I seeking in this?"".  I felt like I entered a weird world where I simply don't belong or don't want to be, I'm not quite sure. Like entering animalistic world of biology and leaving my platonic world. I felt like my platonic internal universe is so much better and fuller than every relationship I could ever have because relationships seem like surface level communication, even if people think they are not. (Or even if they keep telling me about ""the right relationship"", radical love, etc.) I understand what people mean by that but still those are depths that are nowhere deep as my own internal world. Also, I am capable of love but I don't understand private, romantic love. I can love radically while still being by myself, in my own universe. No need for another person to ""fill my void"" because that's impossible. I would rather volunteer, do some helping in a charity center or such, than engage in romantic love.

Relationships are created to keep you ""socialized"", ""normal"", ""sane"". I realized relationships are for people that don't have this endless depth of void in themselves. They are made for this superficiality and find fullness in that, paradoxically.

Stepping into the ""normal people's area"", the concept of us ""being together"" and such...

It felt just extremelly odd and disturbing for me. I felt like that's not who I am although those girls were really attractive and great, normal persons. 

The social recognition, the behaviours...it just felt suffocating, out of touch with me, like I entered into some kind of lifelong hell, loosing my identity, becoming completely another person.

Now after many years, I never even thought about dating. I feel like I don't belong to human species. I feel extremely alienated.

I‚Äôm happiest when I‚Äôm outdoors: wandering through a national park, ambling along a quiet countryside track, or exploring a museum on a rainy afternoon. Simple things light me up, good coffee, interesting conversation, a song that catches me off guard, or a sunset that makes everything feel a bit softer.

I can be a little reserved at first, but once you get me talking I tend to open up fast. I love conversations that move from the serious and thoughtful to the absolutely ridiculous, and I value someone who can do both. Laughing until it hurts and then switching into a sincere late-night chat is very much my vibe.

A few things I nerd out about: history and applied linguistics fascinate me (I could happily get lost in a book about language change or historical quirks). Geopolitics and agriculture interest me too partly because they shape people‚Äôs lives in such concrete ways. Music is a constant companion, and I enjoy the occasional video game for relaxing downtime. I‚Äôm curious by nature and always keen to learn something new, whether that‚Äôs an odd historical anecdote or a surprisingly beautiful hiking route.

I‚Äôm also upfront about who I am in relationships: I identify as an obedient submissive. For me that means I‚Äôm drawn to a dynamic where trust, clear communication, and consent are central. I enjoy taking a responsive role when the connection and boundaries are right, it‚Äôs about giving up control in a way that feels safe, respectful, and mutually satisfying. I take responsibility for communicating limits, aftercare needs, and expectations honestly, reciprocity and emotional safety are non-negotiable. If that resonates with you, I‚Äôd love to find someone who understands power exchange and values trust and care as much as I do.

When it comes to what I want, I don‚Äôt have a rigid checklist. I‚Äôm looking for someone kind, curious, and emotionally available, someone who enjoys conversation, gentle banter, and quiet moments alike. Chemistry matters more than distance to me, I‚Äôm open to meeting people anywhere in the world and exploring where things might go, whether that becomes a deep friendship, a meaningful partnership, or something wonderfully in between.

A few things I bring to the table: loyalty, patience, and a playful sense of humor. I‚Äôm thoughtful and attentive, and I enjoy making small gestures that show I care, remembering a detail you mentioned, planning a thoughtful day out, or simply being a steady presence on a tough one. I value honesty and clear boundaries, and I expect the same in return.

If you like hikes, history rabbit holes, late-night chats, and a bit of playful submission in a trusting, consensual context, we‚Äôll probably get on well. Don't have a chat app preference, I‚Äôm flexible.

If any of this resonates, send me a message. Let‚Äôs start with a conversation and see where the spark takes us. No pressure, just curiosity, care, and the possibility of something real üòä",2,1758704100.0,flrdating,0,1.0,False

A couple months ago, a coworker (24F) of his that he wasn‚Äôt close with asked to move in because she did not have a place to stay and she knew he had extra rooms in his house. He asked me if I was OK with it. I said that it was and at the time that was true. She had a boyfriend, there were two other roommates in the house, and I was feeling secure in our relationship. I‚Äôve met her and spent time with her and I like her.

A couple weeks ago though, she broke up with her boyfriend because he cheated on her and she couldn‚Äôt trust him anymore. She was feeling really down about it and since they live together, my boyfriend wanted to do some things to cheer her up so he went on a walk with her and then the next day he made her breakfast and a specialty coffee. At first, I thought it was so nice that he was doing these things for her but the more I think about it the more uncomfortable it makes me.

He does sweet things for me as well and can be really thoughtful. He makes me breakfast when I‚Äôm there (food in general) and always makes me coffee in the morning (but has never offered or made me a specialty coffee). He also does other things to help me out that are thoughtful (I know I‚Äôm listing basic things right now), but I do feel like I often have to ask him to hang out and to consider my feelings when he accidentally hurts them. He always validates my feelings when I bring things up that bother me, and works at getting better in the way that I ask (but does sometimes slip back to something I don‚Äôt like, for example, poor or unenthusiastic communication over text).

What is starting to make me feel extremely uncomfortable is that I know they‚Äôre spending a lot of quality time together because they‚Äôre roommates (e.g. they watch TV together every single night) and he‚Äôs been doing sweet things for her as mentioned above. It hurts that he would do these thoughtful things for her, but I feel I have to ask him to be thoughtful to me. I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs never thoughtful of his own accord, but the fact that he did it without her asking, and I feel like I have to ask to spend time together is making me uneasy. He was also making some kind of mean jokes when I was over there the other night and I had made them both dinner and she said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why he‚Äôs acting like this. He‚Äôs never like this when you‚Äôre not here.‚Äù And that made me feel humiliated. The other night he called me just to chat while he was at home and we talked for quite a while but then when she came out to the living room, we stayed on the phone for a bit (and included her in the convo) but then he hung up so that he could watch TV with her. I kind of get that, but I think everything compounded together is making me feel insecure and suspicious of his intentions. Since she was just cheated on, I doubt that she would do anything, but of course I can‚Äôt know for sure and to be honest I think I might be projecting her getting cheated on to my relationship. She‚Äôs also absolutely stunning (genuinely looks like a model) and just a cool girl in general.

He has to go away for work soon and I‚Äôm just not feeling secure in our relationship, and he‚Äôll be gone for months. I don‚Äôt feel good about this at all and I‚Äôve started making up scenarios in my head where he‚Äôs doing fun things with her and it‚Äôs making me angry at him. I don‚Äôt want to break up with him because I love him, but I‚Äôm feeling so insecure at the same time. I‚Äôm not sure if this is just my insecurity or if I‚Äôm overlooking something that might actually be going on there (at least from his side). I don‚Äôt think physically anything has happened, but I know that when people spend a lot of time together lines can get blurred and people become close and it makes me extremely anxious and I just don‚Äôt want to feel like this anymore.

I am also nervous to bring this up with him because I don‚Äôt want to make things uncomfortable between them. Usually I just bring something up pretty quickly when something bothers me, but something is holding me back this time. In some ways it feels unfair to make him deal with my insecurity when he hasn‚Äôt done anything I know of. He‚Äôs also very sweet to me at the same time, and I just don‚Äôt know how to feel.

TL;DR: I‚Äôm feeling insecure about my boyfriend‚Äôs relationship with his freshly single roommate, and I‚Äôm looking for advice on how to handle these feelings and talk to him constructively.

The kitchen, once a purely functional space, is rapidly evolving into a hub of innovation. In Orange County, where style meets high-tech living, homeowners are embracing smart kitchen upgrades at a record pace. From AI-assisted cooking to automated lighting systems, the modern kitchen is no longer just about aesthetics‚Äîit‚Äôs about efficiency, connectivity, and enhancing everyday life. With a climate and lifestyle that welcomes open-concept living and entertainment, it‚Äôs no surprise that smart technology is a top priority for those planning a kitchen remodel in this region.

## Why Orange County Homeowners Are Leading the Smart Kitchen Trend

There‚Äôs something about Orange County‚Äôs lifestyle that naturally aligns with smart home innovation. Residents here value both form and function, making smart kitchen tech a perfect fit. In a community where real estate is prized and kitchen-centric entertaining is a way of life, incorporating technology that saves time, improves energy efficiency, and impresses guests is more than a trend‚Äîit‚Äôs a standard. Homeowners are drawn to devices that anticipate needs, learn preferences, and blend seamlessly with sleek, modern designs.

Moreover, the region's strong tech-savvy population is quick to embrace emerging trends. From younger homeowners setting up their first homes to retirees looking for convenience and safety, there‚Äôs broad appeal in upgrading kitchens with intuitive, responsive systems. In Orange County, the kitchen is more than a cooking area‚Äîit‚Äôs a lifestyle centerpiece.

## Features That Define a Smart Kitchen Today

The smart kitchen of 2025 goes far beyond a touch-screen fridge or a programmable coffee maker. Orange County remodels are now integrating tech features like voice-activated appliances, motion-sensor faucets, and AI-enhanced ovens that suggest recipes based on what‚Äôs in your fridge. Add to that lighting systems that adjust to the time of day, and pantry sensors that notify you when supplies are low, and it‚Äôs clear that smart kitchens are designed for ultimate convenience. These aren‚Äôt just gadgets‚Äîthey‚Äôre integral systems that change how we interact with the space.

Additional innovations include integrated cooking surfaces that combine induction heating with precise digital timers, and smart dishwashers that track usage patterns to recommend the most efficient cleaning cycles. Even ventilation systems are getting smarter‚Äîautomatically adjusting fan speeds based on humidity and cooking activity. These conveniences add a layer of luxury and functionality that truly transforms everyday living.

## Integrating Smart Tech During Remodeling

For those considering a [kitchen remodeling Orange county](https://truehomebuildersca.com/kitchen-remodeling/), integrating smart tech begins at the design phase. Contractors and designers in Orange County are increasingly offering tailored smart kitchen packages that align with the homeowner‚Äôs lifestyle and preferences. Whether it‚Äôs planning for a centralized control panel or ensuring compatibility across devices, early integration prevents costly changes later. Choosing the right builder or remodeler who understands these technologies is essential to ensure seamless implementation and future-proof upgrades.

This integration often involves rewiring for smart lighting systems, installing hubs or sensors throughout the cabinetry, and selecting appliances that can ‚Äútalk‚Äù to each other through a unified platform. Professionals help map out which features offer the best ROI while ensuring that everything functions cohesively. And because smart tech changes fast, adaptability is built into every phase of the remodel.

## Energy Efficiency and Sustainability

One of the biggest draws of smart kitchen technology is its potential for energy savings. From refrigerators that monitor energy use to induction cooktops that heat only where needed, tech-savvy appliances are helping Orange County homeowners reduce their environmental impact. Smart lighting systems automatically dim or shut off when not in use, and water-saving features are programmed into faucets and dishwashers. Many residents are prioritizing these upgrades not just for their functionality, but for their alignment with sustainable living goals‚Äîa value deeply embedded in the local culture.

In addition, some homeowners are integrating solar-powered systems that sync with their smart kitchens to manage energy loads throughout the day. Smart plugs and timers ensure that no device is wasting power during off-hours, while smart thermostats adjust kitchen airflow based on activity levels. These green technologies are more than just cost-saving measures‚Äîthey reflect a commitment to a responsible, eco-conscious lifestyle.

## The Design-Technology Balance

Blending cutting-edge tech with timeless design is both an art and a science. Fortunately, the market has responded with appliances and systems that are as beautiful as they are intelligent. Stainless steel finishes, minimalist control panels, and concealed hardware allow for seamless integration into any design scheme. Orange County remodels often favor open, airy kitchens where technology doesn‚Äôt dominate but enhances the user experience quietly in the background. Designers emphasize that smart tech should support the flow and aesthetics, not interrupt them.

Some remodelers are even using augmented reality (AR) tools during consultations, allowing homeowners to visualize how each tech feature will look and function in their space before committing. Custom cabinetry with built-in screens or retractable panels further shows how design and technology can merge elegantly. This harmony ensures that no matter how smart a kitchen gets, it still feels like home.

## Customization for the Modern Lifestyle

Every family in Orange County has a unique rhythm, and smart kitchens can adapt accordingly. From setting up personalized user profiles on appliances to automating tasks based on daily routines, the possibilities for customization are immense. For households with children, safety features like auto-shutoff stoves and locked fridge compartments offer peace of mind. Meanwhile, culinary enthusiasts enjoy features like recipe projection onto kitchen counters or apps that track ingredient freshness. All of this reflects the shift toward a more intuitive and user-centered kitchen experience.

Voice assistants can manage grocery lists, timers, and even provide hands-free cooking instructions. Multi-user settings can adjust lighting and music preferences automatically based on who enters the kitchen. In homes with diverse needs, this level of personalization makes daily routines smoother and more enjoyable. It‚Äôs no longer about adapting to your kitchen‚Äîyour kitchen adapts to you.

## Working with Local Experts

Finding the right professionals is crucial when building or renovating a tech-forward kitchen. Experienced [home builders Orange county](https://truehomebuildersca.com/) understand both the technical and design challenges that come with smart integration. They can recommend which innovations are worth the investment and how best to future-proof the space. Collaborating with a team familiar with Orange County's architectural trends ensures that your remodel will meet both current needs and long-term goals.

In fact, many local experts now offer consultation packages that include smart tech audits‚Äîreviewing your current kitchen setup and suggesting compatible upgrades. These experts are also well-versed in permits, local building codes, and integration strategies that align with both short-term budgets and long-term visions.

## Managing Cost Without Compromising Innovation

Smart kitchen remodeling doesn‚Äôt have to break the bank. While some features can be pricey, there are budget-friendly options and phased approaches that allow homeowners to gradually build their smart kitchens. Many Orange County contractors offer tiered packages that start with essential upgrades‚Äîsuch as smart lighting and appliances‚Äîand allow for later additions like AI-enabled cooking systems or central hubs. Planning smartly from the outset helps homeowners make the most of their investment while enjoying the benefits of modern tech.

Rebates and incentives are also available for energy-efficient upgrades, and some utility companies in Orange County offer programs to offset the cost of installing smart appliances. Financing plans, combined with long-term energy savings, make these remodels accessible to a broader range of homeowners. With careful planning, the dream of a connected, high-functioning kitchen is within reach.

## Smart Kitchens in Commercial Spaces

Interestingly, smart kitchen tech isn‚Äôt limited to residential spaces. Many [commercial contractors Orange county](https://truehomebuildersca.com/commercial-retail-remodeling/) are bringing this innovation into restaurants, caf√©s, and coworking kitchens. With remote monitoring, inventory tracking, and automated maintenance alerts, these features help businesses reduce downtime and improve service. For Orange County entrepreneurs, embracing smart tech is becoming a competitive advantage in the hospitality and food industries.

In commercial environments, smart kitchen tech also aids in compliance and consistency. Automated cooking procedures reduce human error, while digital checklists ensure food safety protocols are followed. Whether it's a startup caf√© or an upscale restaurant, technology is helping businesses create better customer experiences while streamlining operations behind the scenes.

## Conclusion: A Smarter, Better Kitchen Awaits

As smart technology continues to advance, the kitchens of Orange County are becoming more adaptive, beautiful, and efficient. Whether you‚Äôre an early adopter or just beginning to explore the benefits, investing in a smart kitchen remodel is a step toward a more streamlined and enjoyable lifestyle. With the right planning and local expertise, your dream kitchen‚Äîone that thinks, learns, and adapts‚Äîcan become a reality.

Ultimately, it‚Äôs not just about what your kitchen can do‚Äîit‚Äôs about how it can support the way you live, cook, and connect with others. In Orange County, where innovation and elegance go hand-in-hand, the smart kitchen is more than a trend‚Äîit‚Äôs the future of home living.",1,1758702450.0,KitchenInspiration,0,1.0,False

A thousand blue hats are thrown into the air  
And become specks in the cloudless sky.  
They land on our heads and our shoulders  
And on the floor and on our friends  
And we laugh because

Graduation is here!

Our families and friends give us hugs and kisses  
And celebrate us.  
We take photos together  
And reminisce on the nervous first time we met,  
So long ago ‚Äì The memories we‚Äôve made since then!

Time to celebrate.

Ten best friends board the plane  
Which somehow smells of excitement and fear  
And adventure and more ‚Äì How is this the first time  
We‚Äôre all travelling together?!

We take photos of each other  
Fast asleep in the sky,  
Our mouths hanging open  
With blankets tucked under our chins  
And the night sky soaring past us  
And grin at the craziness of it all.

We‚Äôre all awake now as the plane descends  
And we press our faces to the window  
Where the city sprawls below us  
Like a galaxy where each star is the light of a family  
Sleeping peacefully, a million-different lives  
That we send photos of to our families at home  
With a breathless, stupid wonder.

We arrive at the hotel and  
Brush our teeth together as we had  
Done so many times in the dorms  
But now we are in a foreign land  
Where the air slightly  
Smells like smoke  
And glory.

We fall asleep, exhausted  
But wake up  
So excited.

Ten best friends pile  
Into a tuk-tuk and the wind whips our hair ‚Äì  
Is this legal?!, we scream in giddy  
As the driver gives us a knowing grin.  
The people here are so friendly.

We try haggling for colourful pants  
In a crowded market because that is  
The experience but fail badly  
And end up paying more somehow  
But that‚Äôs okay because we are actors  
On a stage and this is the magic.

Steam rises from a massive bowl  
Of shared noodles where we bunch together  
On plastic stools under a thin canopy  
As the rain crashes down around us.

We stand on a street corner with a map  
That is more of a suggestion than a map  
And the roar of a thousand scooters wash over us  
And the rain drenches us all.  
We laugh at the absurdity of it,  
At how five years ago we were nothing  
And now we are ten best friends  
Who survived exams and heartbreak and coffee  
And classes and growing up together  
To be here in the chaos of a foreign land where we feel  
Completely, ridiculously invincible.

We stumble into a tiny dim-lit bar  
To escape the pouring rain  
And drink the night away together  
From buckets of cheap whiskey  
And we share our stories  
With the locals who drink with us  
And we think about drinking our first ever shots ¬†  
Together 5 years ago and we cheers to that and drink  
More than our 18-year old selves could have imagined.

Ten best friends  
Sit on the back of ten sputtering scooters  
As the sun pounds overhead  
And the scooters climb a winding dirt road  
Through a foggy jungle.

The world is a blur  
Of intense green  
And we smell damp earth  
And hear the screech of far-away monkeys  
And wind pelts our faces  
And when we can,  
We turn to each other and give a delirious grin.

Ten best friends push their way through  
Hanging vines and muddy roads  
And find a clearing ¬†  
That leads to a secluded beach  
With white sand  
And water that catches fire  
As the waves reflect the red sunset.

We build a firepit on the white-sand  
And sit around it as the night air gets chilly  
And we listen to the gentle lapping of the waves  
And the crackle of the flames  
And think about our lives  
And the past and the future  
And where would all this go  
And where would we all end up  
And then we think about the present  
And we sing our love for each other  
And promise that after graduation  
We will keep in touch  
Even though everyone is moving away.

Someone pulls out a small bottle of rum  
And we take turns passing it around  
On our final night in this glorious land  
And someone decides to jump in the freezing water  
And we all jump in  
And the water chills us to the bone  
And then the stars come out blazing  
And we look at the Milky Way in all its glory  
And the soft light blooms from our skin  
And we look at each other in this faint light  
And we take it all in,  
Because this is the entire universe in this moment,  
And it belongs to us,  
It is us.

I've been collecting and enjoying tea samplers for over 5 years now, and I wanted to share some tips on how to properly clean and store them to maintain their freshness and flavor. Trust me, there's nothing worse than discovering your favorite tea has gone stale or moldy.

First things first - when you get a new tea sampler (I recently got an amazing one from https://athometouch.com/tea-sampler), you'll want to check if the packaging is airtight. Most good quality samplers come in sealed pouches or tins, but if they don't, you'll need to transfer them to proper storage containers.

Here's my cleaning routine for tea storage containers:
- Wash with warm water and mild soap
- Rinse thoroughly (tea is sensitive to soap residue)
- Let them dry completely (moisture is the enemy!)
- Optional: sanitize with white vinegar solution

For storage, keep these crucial factors in mind:
1. Light exposure - Store in a dark place
2. Temperature - Room temperature is ideal
3. Humidity - Keep it dry
4. Air exposure - Airtight containers are essential
5. Strong odors - Keep away from spices and coffee

I've found that ceramic or dark glass containers work best. Avoid plastic as it can absorb flavors and affect the taste. If you're looking for a great starter set with proper storage options, check out this tea sampler set at https://athometouch.com/tea-sampler - it comes with everything you need.

Some pro tips I've learned:
- Label everything with purchase dates
- Store different types separately (green teas away from strong black teas)
- Never use the same container for different teas without thorough cleaning
- Check regularly for any signs of moisture or mold
- Use within 6-12 months for best flavor

The most common mistake I see people make is storing tea in their kitchen cabinet above the stove. The heat and humidity from cooking can really mess with the tea's quality. Instead, use a dedicated drawer or shelf away from heat sources.

Remember to clean your storage area every few months. I usually do this seasonal cleaning when I rotate my tea collection. It's also a great time to check expiration dates and freshness.

I hope these tips help you maintain your tea collection! Let me know if you have any questions - I'm always happy to chat about proper tea storage methods.",1,1758701777.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False
