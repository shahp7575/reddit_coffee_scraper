I'm convinced Blizz upped the inflation intentionally in Fresh, there's too much free gold roaming around compared to ""before SoD"" era.   
  
Right now 1000g in SoD is worth less than buying a Starbacks coffee in Berlin.  
Thus botters stop making money, as nobody needs more than one cup with no GDKP.

GDKP ban rules - are not only ""gdkp ban"", but a methodical set of extra rules to cause hyperinflation to combat bots and degens on the early stages.

I know the way your voices changes and the way your eye moves to signal your thoughts. The way you rub your index finger below your bottom lip. I know knw that that means. I know what's on your mind with the direction your leg moves while you sleep. I can remember the way you breathe just as you are drifting off. It's a sound that won't ever escape my memory. I cherish that sound. 

I know the way your foot steps sound while making coffee or while you are shuffling to get somewhere quickly. I know. You were always a bull in a China cabinet. The silence now is comforting even while missing the banging and clanking. Sometimes I miss your ""noise""

I know you didn't intend on this. 

I know the way you stand while being asked questions and the strain on your neck the moment you want to be defensive and the softening in the dip of your shoulders while feeling vulnerable. The very way your face muscles change depending on your mood. 

I know you didn't see this coming. 

I know the rhythm of your heartbeat better than God Himself. I listened to it at a steady pace while relaxed and watched it pound from your chest during the difficult discussions of revelation you opened up about. I know the way your eye lashes move as your eyes roam. 

You didn't anticipate this. 

You didn't know my ""enough"" even though I know every line in the palms of your hands. Each callus on your fingers and how the feel down my back. 

You didn't know my cries, how genuine and pleading they were. 

You didn't see or hear that I wouldn't and couldn't. You took no heed to the severity of the situation. I wish you had heard me the way I can still hear your laugh.

You counted on me to fall on my face and to never fix my eyes forward. You didn't see my strength.  You anticipated time being in your favor. Working for you. 

What you saw was hope that time would make things disappear. That with time all things could be made right. That it would cause the heart to grow fonder. That time and distance theory you saw. You just didn't see me. The tired me. The pushing forward me. The sick me. The me that needed you to finally see me. 

You didn't see the strength that I possess in my soul. I don't know how? It belonged to you. Along with my heart and purpose. Alas, you didn't see the way my eyes changed while I looked up and made a declaration for my own perseverance. 

I always told you my greatest love language is ""time"" you didn't bother to read the book. It still stands. Time. This time, it was time for me. It was time for me to realize that this time, this time is not to be wasted and will be spent on me. Unwavering. Walking the greatest love story I have ever lived. Myself. Time with myself. 

Yes, time helped mend. Time did do that. It gave me room to let go. Time. The most valuable luxury not afforded to all and can be greatly abused.

If you don’t care to read about the intricacies of my daily trips to the porcelain throne, I advise you to stop reading now.

It doesn’t matter what I’m eating, drinking, how much I’m sleeping, whether I’m staying hydrated, how the toilet is shaped, whether I’m alone or traveling with people. I could be halfway around the world in a 5 star hotel, or spending the weekend at an Air BnB an hour from home. The result is the same. 

I typically will not have a BM for the first couple days, during which time I will become increasingly bloated and uncomfortable. After that, I will begin to experience urgent BMs after each substantial meal, all of which are difficult and none of which are satisfying. 

Upon returning home, everything immediately returns to normal. As soon as I enter my apartment, I beeline to the toilet where my bowels unclench and a backlog of repressed turds are unleashed. My schedule then returns to normal. One BM in the morning after coffee, and another in the evening or late afternoon. 

Please, can anyone relate and if so, has anyone come up with an effective solution? It is extremely uncomfortable and reduces the enjoyment I get from food, sex, and various travel activities. ",1,1733273266.0,TravelHacks,1,0.67,False

I admit I was giving short answers and slightly passive aggressive. For example when he asked me for something I put it on the opposite side of the coffee table so he still had to stand up. 

His mom decided to come talk to me in the kitchen and tell me I should “let it go for the baby to not be in a hostile environment.”

At that point I lost it and told her to mind her business and to get out of my house. I told her the child is sleeping and I’m human and have a right to feel emotions and that she can have her son visit her at her house since my home is so hostile. 

After she left she had told my boyfriend how upset she was at my reaction. He’s now mad at me for snapping on his mom. He wants me to apologize but I don’t think I should have to but want an outside opinion. Aita?",1,1733273030.0,AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,False

Stepping out this morning, I was greeted by a biting chill, but the walk from the station to the office made it worth it. There’s something about the **cool breeze and a warm Starbucks coffee** that feels so calming—I can’t ever skip it!

The day started with back-to-back meetings (classic Tuesday vibes), but it was productive. **One of our projects is finally going live soon**, and I can’t help but feel proud of the effort and collaboration involved. Big shoutout to the **amazing stakeholders** who make the extra effort worth it. Sometimes, working with people like them makes you want to do even more!

**Lunchtime!**  
The office is already glowing with **Christmas vibes** (I’ll save that for the next post), but for now, let’s talk about lunch. Today’s choice? Something called *Pota Chi*\* Chicken\* (the full name skipped me, but I swear it sounded hilarious 🤭). It turned out to be a **pulled chicken curry with rice, cilantro, and naan**. And wow, it was **spicy, flavorful, and just what I needed** to power through the rest of the day.

Honestly, I didn’t even cook today, so this funny-named dish became my lunch savior. It was tasty enough for me to remember, but as usual, I had to write about it to make sure I don’t forget.

So, what’s this post about? Nothing much—just sharing bits and pieces of my day. Sometimes, the simplest moments—**a chilly morning, a good meal, or productive meetings**.

This was the peak of my hair loss and the most hair I’ve ever lost while showering. The second pic is from December 1, 2024. I couldn’t figure out why my hair was falling out so massively. Is started in May 2021 and was subtle then started to progressively get worse. I was diagnosed with anemia since I was a teenager (I’m now in my late 20’s) and didn’t really take it serious. I would take my perception iron + vitamin C supplements on and off and would go long periods of time without taking it. It caused terrible stomach aches and nausea. Not until 2021 did I start to see the effects of it but didn’t believe my iron deficiency could cause so many symptoms. I thought it was a side effect of Covid because it started around the same time I got Covid. I tried for years to do everything (rosemary water,rice water, applying no heat, oil treatments, magnesium supplements, etc.). This year it got to the point where I could see my scalp and I started to cry, I bucked down and started to do more research. I finally went to the doctor and asked her for a blood test to see if it could be my iron levels. Me stupidly thinking this major hairloss could be due to lack of iron but it was. My levels were extremely low almost near getting an infusion but my doctor just told me to start taking my iron supplements and I should be okay. She said it would take 5-6 month for me to notice hair growth if I’m consistent with the supplements. I’ve been consistent with my supplements since September 9, 2024. I trusted the process but I didn’t see any changes. The same amount of hair would fall out every time I washed my hair. I did more research and I saw a video of a girl who experienced the same thing. She said she started to notice a change when she upped her dosage. Of course I asked my doctor first before doing so. I was taking 1 iron and 1 vitamin C supplement twice a day. But when I started taking 2 iron pills with my vitamin C supplements once a day is when I saw a major difference. The effects were noticeable after 1 week. I am so beyond grateful to get my hair back to where it was and for all the posts and videos everyone makes. Without others sharing their stories I wouldn’t of figured out some key details about my situation. For example, I didn’t realize caffeine can effect iron absorption. I drink decaffeinated coffee and tea 85% of the time now and when I don’t I make sure to space it out about 2hr before or after taking my supplements. This was something my doctor didn’t tell me. 
Also those treatments I listed above do work wonders as long as your body is healthy on the inside (I swear by hair oiling). I do plan on eating more iron rich food and slowly lower my iron dosage eventually. I hope some find this helpful.

Like panic attack scared when all signs point me being perfectly healthy. So i feel i need to add abit of something for people to make them feel better.

If your anxius, theres propaply a reason for it that isnt related to the anxius thoughts your having. I was anxius for my health for many days straight and then i read low iron can cause anxiety. Ate some spinach and next day i was all normal. So i would sudgest to recount some things you might be missing interms of nutrients. Iron, d-vitamin, magnesium, omega-3. Stuff like that.

Caffeine can triger anxiety because how it makes your heart beat faster which then causes your mind think something must be wrong. So too much sportdrinks, soda, coffee or some teas can cause anxiety.

I also sudgest for you to try and get out of your head and anxities time to time. I have OCD and going to do something with my friend helps me get out of my space and do something else to take my mind off. Then when im back, i notice that everything was fine and i guess i didnt need to worry.

Last sudgestion: try working out. Im inside mouse nerd who lives behind a screen so i didnt have an outlet for stress or excess energy. Now i go 1-2 times a week of 45 min workout session with my friend and we have been doing it for a year now consistently.

I was a little anxious and felt hungry at times. I felt off and thought I was still hungry. I got a egg and cheese burrito and only ate half. I felt sick immediately. I even had a quick hot flash. I took some meds and eventually it all calmed down. I had a small amount of plain pasta in olive oil for lunch. That is all I had today except for some rice tonight. Let me add, this morning I went to the bathroom and it was fine but I am not sure it all came out. Then later this evening when I was home I went again.  I still feel off but better than I did. Can it be caused that I did not go the bathroom completely?? Ugh...this SUCKS!!",1,1733271909.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

1. Can't see where top of glass chemex is because filters are over-sized. This can lead to spillages. Are there any filters that perfectly fit the chemex or slightly smaller? Seems a surprising oversight by chemex...
2. Filters all smell of paper chemicals including the unbleached variety. Even after pouring boiling water through them. I have sensitive taste buds, which is good where health is concerned since paper can have chemicals, but you can smell chemicals on the paper after pouring boiling water onto them.
3. I have confirmed that chemex filters tranfer forever chemicals into the coffee you drink at the link below. Forever chemicals don't leave your body so they build up gradually and might cause health problems long term (you won't notice until too late so I don't want to take risk). ""**our lab detected trace amounts of organic fluorine within Chemex Natural Coffee Filters**"" . source: [https://www.mamavation.com/food/chemex-natural-coffee-filters-pfas-forever-chemical-results.html](https://www.mamavation.com/food/chemex-natural-coffee-filters-pfas-forever-chemical-results.html)

Coffee ""covers up"" the chemical paper taste but that's not good. If you don't have sensitive taste buds you can smell the chemicals by pouring boiling water over the filter & put your nose near the wet filter paper.

Any suggestions for a.) filters that fit the chemex perfectly or aren't oversized that b.) don't transfer forever chemicals into the coffee ?

1h62t2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1h62t2s/adhd_meltdown_from_hell/,ADHD Meltdown From Hell,"Let me start by saying I do not encourage what I’m about to share, nor do I think it’s okay. I just wanted to put out into the world what a really stupid meltdown can look like and what can lead up to it. We’ve all googled to see if anybody’s been in our situation and I noticed not a lot of adults have shared stories of ugly meltdowns, for good reason. Hopefully somebody sees this one day and knows they’re not alone. Bad days can be really bad. Sorry in advance for writing a whole ass book….

Overwhelm has been building up inside of me recently, from a few things. Some self inflicted, others not. I’m overworked at my job, I’ve left text messages unread, I have a trip in a few days, I’ve been unable to get to chores and eat well because of work, no time for my goals… stuff everybody is dealing with.

Last night, I cooked my boyfriend dinner after a long day and didn’t feed myself because I was too tired. First sign of burnout. 

Today, I started off alright. I work in logistics and unfortunately, my techs were also having a day and they were making silly mistakes and not reading notes and calling me about it. Then, I’m notified equipment is out of stock. Then, I have to fill those appointments in. The requests keep rolling in, I fall behind, and then it’s 3:30. 9 hours in, I’m not even halfway done with my day’s work. I have no help. 

My partner and I were supposed to “woohoo” tonight. I’m not even dressed, definitely ain’t going to make him dinner, and he called out of work. I work from home so that got on my nerves, and I know he’s gonna wonder why I’m not dressed at 3 pm. Luckily he went off to go help a buddy with a car. And look, my boyfriend would never hold it against me that I had a long day. Some of this is the panic setting in of running out of time.

The rage built up. After a few phone calls and news that a truck broke down, I completely lost it. I pounded on my desk so hard, shit fell over and that made me MORE angry. At this point, I feel full on rage. I’m losing it. 

I tell my coworker timidly “I’m taking a break”. I turned up the shower as hot as it could go, stood in the burning water, and scrubbed my skin as hard as I could. Punched myself in the leg a couple times, HARD. I get out, and make myself coffee. 

I’m slamming doors and I’m just so freaking mad. Cussing out the people at my job under my breath. I go back to the office, set my coffee on the warmer, and as I scoot my chair, my coffee spills. I screamed. Fully screamed, until my throat hurt. I grabbed my whole ass office chair and chucked it so hard at the wall, I put a hole in it and destroyed a phone charger. 

I clean it up and when I go to put my mug in the sink, I see my poor sweet dog is so scared and doesn’t understand what’s going on. It brings me back to reality and I start sobbing and holding her and the much deserved guilt hits for being so irrational and immature and selfish. The shame brings me down a few notches. 

I’m on an XR dose of Adderall, 20 mg. Normally works fantastic and things like this won’t happen on it. Sadly it’s my luteal phase and it doesn’t always seem to work as well during this time. Took one at 6 am and at 4 pm, I did a huge no-no and took another. I will say, it brought me right back down to earth. I never take a second dose like that but in the moment it seemed like the only thing that would help. I’m ashamed it took a pill to calm me down.

I’m 30. And I acted out like that, essentially over stress. I’m ashamed, and I should be. Scared the hell out of my dog. Failed to remember my coworkers have just as much bullshit to put up with as I do. Got physical and threw things, and broke things which only causes more issues. 

What am I doing to get back to reality now? I’m posting this to get it off my chest, I’m going to make a list and prioritize what needs to be done so I can clock out of work at some point today, and I’m going to make the guest bed for my dog and give her the most delicious dinner I can to make up for my scary outburst as much as humanly possible. 

Anyways, I know this one probably belongs in the drafts… 😭

For anybody like me who struggles hard with the impulse control and rage, I’m so sorry. It’s horrible to be crazy angry like that. It looks bad, it is bad, it can hurt/scare others, and it’s embarrassing but important to confront it.

Friendly reminder to have a game plan for regaining emotional control when things get stressful. Take a walk, punch a pillow, play an immersive game, whatever you gotta do. DON’T throw shit, or hit shit. Get professional help when you need to. Step away before it gets worse. Apologize to anybody you’ve affected in the process, and don’t use your ADHD to excuse what you’ve done. It explains the behavior, but doesn’t excuse acts of violence we choose to commit - don’t be like me. 

So if you found this looking for advice, I hope you feel less alone in your extreme adult ADHD rage, but I don’t want to normalize this or anything. Please take care of yourself so you don’t act out in ways you’ll regret. With love, pull yourself together. If you see a doctor or therapist, do not hide these episodes from them so they can help you. Good luck, and tomorrow is a new day. ",8,1733271828.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

A little about me:

* I’m someone who values curiosity, humor, and kindness. I love  exploring new coffee shops, going on spontaneous adventures, diving into a nice movie, etc.
* Music is a big part of my life—whether it’s discovering new artists or revisiting classics. I’d love to hear about your favorite playlist!
* I’m naturally easygoing, a good listener, and always up for deep conversations or lighthearted banter.

What I’m looking for:  
Someone who’s open-minded, enjoys good conversation, and isn’t afraid to be themselves. Whether it’s chatting about life’s big questions, sharing memes, I’d love to connect and see where it goes.

It doesn't depend on how I felt before sleep(even really happy) or what kind of dream I had. Most of the time it happens when it's REALLY quiet in the room and nighttime.

Usually it starts with silence feeling way too intrusive and uncanny, ringing in my ears. I just feel so isolated, there's a dark feeling of impending doom, like something is about to kill me in my room any moment, tension, pressure, hopelessness. Every detail and sensation feels so intrusive and overwhelming, a sense of urgency. I have this horrible mix of feeling really exhausted and wanting to go to sleep but also being too hyper to fall asleep, I have some extra pent-up energy I need to release, my limbs feel irritated as if they're trapped in a tight space when they're not which leads me to removing the blanket or shaking my legs. I feel very hypersensitive and numb at the same time, have a high temperature, my mouth feels very dry, I'm really thirsty. If the light is off, my mind starts making up scary silluettes - if the light is on, every dark spot in my room and every glowing dot and every eye on a toy, poster or painting feels oddly threatening. Everything feels like a dream and unreal, but also too real at the same time, feeling out of my body, my vision gets very sharp like I'm watching my life at 8k. My feet feel like they're burning. There's drought and light physical pain everywhere on my skin. Everything in my peripheral begs me to turn around, my heart is racing. I can't calm down or convince nyself in anything, it's just so powerful, I crumble under this irrational fear. I feel like I MUST NOT think anything hopeful or else I'm underestimating some kind of imaginary demons that are gonna come after me then, as if they will come after me exactly now as if I'm special, I often wrap myself up in a blanket, meticulously making sure every corner is closed, so that nothing dangerous can crawl into the gap, like I'm in debt to these hypothetical creatures, not a single wrong move or thought or else, just waves of fear. At some point it gets hard to breathe and feels too tight, so I crawl out of the blanket, but then I get scared and hide again, just this intese paranoia+panic torture all night, with bursts of sudden jumpscare type fear. There are many cases where I also cry and hyperventilate, just can't control my breath, stutter and stuff. It feels like it'll never end.

This whole thing lasts for hours and then I either somehow fall asleep or stay awake 'till the morning and then it all goes away and sometimes I even feel euphoric after it ends.

I tried to think of what causes it. Is it too silent or too hot or not enough air or is it the full moon or due to drinking too much black/green tea - all things that often co-occur with this, but there are so many times when they don't and it still happens. I don't drink coffee or alcohol, and this definetely has nothing to do with any pills since it started early in my childhood. Trauma maybe? Idk.

Drinking some tea or milk, listening to music, eating or watching a video or to tell myself that it's just the same room as it is at day and not any more dangerous sometimes kinda helps.

I don't want any advice, I just want to know if anyone goes through this specific thing and how to call it. Like what is this? It's not quite a panic attack, because it lasts for hours, while the official definition of a panic attack says it lasts half an hour at most.",1,1733271150.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

Turns out that genetics highly influence your reaction to caffeine and that average advice does not work for everyone.

I felt exhausted my whole adult life. I always suspected that my caffeine consumption might be a problem, but never quit for long enough to measure the effect.

I stopped drinking coffee 3 months ago and only after 7 weeks did I feel refreshed after sleeping. However, it did not stop. I slept amazingly for a month now and I am now convinced that caffeine was the issue.

If your sleep sucks, then maybe you also react strongly to caffeine.
For me it was easier to quit caffeine with an app, but maybe you can get support from family and friends. Because it is really hard in the beginning.
You loose productivity for a few weeks, but gain so much more when sleeping well.

If you sleep bad like I used to, try 1 or 2 months without caffeine, good luck. 🍀

This detail is important imo as I usually say ""work"" and people envision corpo workplace politics. It's somewhere in between and not as bad to date someone you work with in this environment but I still find myself very hesitant. 

She was put in my office shortly before moving to another one and we would chat quite a lot, especially when bumping into each other on the corridor. Occasionally we got lunch together or grabbed a coffee. I didn't know whether she was taken, and I'm not super into dating colleagues so although I found her attractive i was on the fence and also just thought she was a fun friend. I'd asked her for her number a couple of times, usually for a practical reason like communicating about something we'd arranged to do (like coffee) and in the hopes to arrange something else maybe but she referred me to fucking teams lol so I got the hint. 

In the end there was a local event I wanted to go to, I couldn't find anyone else to go with me and asked her as it seemed like something she'd enjoy too. We went, fully coordinated old school style ""meet at the bike shed at 6"", it was fun, we chatted etc and got some drinks. I didn't feel any specific sexual tension or anything. I never made any move on her or anything. I feel the need to preface this because the day after she just pretty much stopped talking to me. I could understand if she felt I was a fucking creep or I missed the mark and made a move that wasnt reciprocated that could make things awkward. It was just time spent between friends I thought. Well, I recognise I'm being a bit on the fence whether I'll define this as a date. I was trying to figure out the vibe between us and imo being rightfully cautious as we're in the same department and I guess I'm at the age I expect a mature level of communication before jumping into things.

The next day she was rushing around the department looking stressed and instead of stopping to chat as usual she just rushed past me a lot. It continued for about a week until I think she realised I was confused, then stopped to say ""I'm not ignoring you I'm just really busy and stressed right now"". That gave me some peace, I gave her space. 

Then we literally didn't talk for 6 months beyond ""hi"" but only if I initiated it. It was weird at first but I was also stressed with my own shit and soon moved past it. Yesterday I'm sat in my lab minding my own fucking business and I caught her staring in through the window at me on her way past, when I looked at her she paused, smiled and waved then went to her office that she was already waking to.

I'm a hopeless romantic who loves to cuddle, go on cute dates, send sweet memes/TikToks, I'm loyal and empathetic (almost to a fault), I cannot stand dry conversations, I tend to wear shorts and t-shirts because they're comfy. I'm not religious and very liberal. I'm also a mom!

I would love someone who will let me be clingy, respond in a timely manner (or let me know that you're away/busy), have a dark sense of humor, and is open and honest, I tend to prefer thick body types but I'm more into your personality. 

I'm currently looking for online and long-term, but I'd love some new friends, and would be interested in-person if we hit it off, dms are open! ♥️",0,1733270482.0,polyamoryR4R,1,0.5,False

There are other ways to socialise that don’t involve overeating or won’t trigger a binge or maybe a purge.

1h621pj,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1h621pj/my_32f_husband_32m_unintentionally_recorded/,"My (32F) husband (32M) ""unintentionally"" recorded friends in my home. Is this story believable?","Hi all, this is my first post of this kind. I have started to type and delete this countless times, but I really need some unbiased honest opinions on a really unfortunate situation I've found myself in. It is a long/convoluted story that I'm not quite sure what to believe, so I would appreciate a close read/unbiased advice. 

I (32F) have been with my husband (32M) for several years. We have had a pretty good relationship--no major issues or infidelity. We both have been known to be a bit flirty/outgoing/like attention from the opposite sex but neither of us act on anything outside of our marriage. He has a ton of friends and we have a close-knit friend group that we are both very active in. We have occasional arguments and disagreements but no dealbreakers to this point...until a recent event. I will try to break the information down in the easiest way possible below.

-----------------------------------------

Recently, my husband and I had a group of close friends over that we've had over many times before--couples that we spend a lot of time with. We played a drinking game and he got totally plastered (he had about 14 shots in the span of 2 hours). We all were drinking, but no one to that level. He went to the bathroom several times throughout the night to throw up (we heard him). He is not a big drinker but always goes way overboard at these types of events. It has been a point of contention with me and him before because I find him to be annoying/obnoxious when he's blackout drunk (never violent or inappropriate though). 

Later in the night, everyone left but he and his best friend stayed and continued watching movies. I went upstairs to bed then went to send him a text to remind him to lock the door downstairs. I then noticed that his phone was upstairs in the bedroom with me (he and I had both come upstairs about an hour prior briefly and that's when he left it). When I turned it over, an app called ""cam"" that I had never seen before was displaying notifications on the home screen. I see his phone all the time and we use each other's phones occasionally for taking photos, looking up stuff, etc. I immediately froze and feared the worst. 

I unlocked his phone and sure enough, the app had photos and videos of people using the bathroom throughout the night--it appeared that it was motion detected. The angle was blurry/not ideal, but they were there. From my estimation it looked like some earlier photos/videos had been deleted, but there were videos of people of both genders leftover--particularly of my attractive friend (though you couldn't see very much from the weird angle). 

I immediately went to the bathroom and went to check based on the angle of the footage. There is only one outlet in the bathroom and it is in a very prominent location. There was no camera, so I assumed he removed it. I made sure to take a screenshot of what I saw on the app, mentally noted all of the footage that I saw on there with timestamps, and confirmed the app was downloaded that day. In those few minutes, I assumed this was all intentional and started mentally planning my exit (ex. take pets to my mom's house, packing essentials, etc). I then went to confront him (the best friend was asleep). 

My husband immediately admitted to it and shared some other information. The story he told is below.

----------------------------------------

He told me that before the get-together, he was quickly trying to shave his beard and his razor had died (I remember this happening earlier in the day). He was trying to find a USB charger quickly and grabbed a random one plugged into the power strip from his office. 

Later in the night, after getting completely plastered, he was in the bathroom and noticed that the charger he had plugged in was the one he had with a camera. He said he was horrified and scared and didn't realize until that moment that it was that specific charger he plugged in. This is a charger that has a small camera in it. He unplugged it and threw it away (I confirmed it was in the trash).  

Of course, my next question was why he has a secret charger camera in the first place in my home. I know that we have a few other cameras around outside and one in another spot in the house, but none of them are secret charger cameras. 

He then takes a few minutes and starts crying, but tells me that this secret camera has been pointed at a small discrete fridge in his home office (that he told me was for juice/iced coffee while working) that is hiding his secret: he has been on Ozempic. I had no idea that he was on Ozempic, but he has lost significant weight in the past year. He had been very heavy during COVID and was very down on his apperance, so I have been suspicious that he was on weight loss medication. I have questioned him several times and he told me he was on Ally, which I also discovered in the house. He and I have discussed Ozempic many times because we have a friend who is on it--my husband has been openly very critical of that friend's decision (go figure). 

With that information shared, he said that he had borrowed the camera from a friend who I know has these types of discrete cameras (my husband knows that I do not support this in any way). He was using the camera to make sure that no one found the Ozempic. He specifically mentioned hiding it from relatives that are in our house frequently without us (petsitting when we're away, cleaning, etc.) and have questioned his weight loss, but he also didn't want me to find it. He said he was ashamed and embarrassed that he couldn't lose weight the ""right way."" He said he deleted the app about six months ago after he realized that no one was going to happen upon his Ozempic secret (and that literally no one cared). Then, when he realized the USB charger camera had been plugged in, he redownloaded the app to see what it had captured. 

From there, he said he started deleting the footage that had been captured thus far. Of course, the footage of my friend was still there when I got to it (+ a few others of his friends). This is when he admitted that he was curious of what the camera caught and that's why he was slow to delete the last few, specifically of her. He said he was going to delete it later but in his drunken state he made a terrible decision. He had not looked at it but admitted that he might have. He then basically forgot about the phone and the app while drunk--hence why it was upstairs in the room with me. I can confirm that he did not view the footage of my friend because it was unopened, but still, it wasn't deleted. 

He immediately deleted the app and the footage when I confronted him (I told him this was incredibly suspicious, but it's a shitty random app and I had scoured it for all possible information already). I have since deleted the screenshot I took as well because I don't want that on my phone either.

----------------------------------------

I genuinely am 50/50 undecided on whether I should leave him or not. What he did was absolutely unacceptable and disgusting. If I felt it was intentional that he captured the footage, I would have called the police immediately. I make enough money to support myself and do not need him, so there isn't anything keeping me with him from a financial/stability perspective. 

However, I genuinely do think that it was unintentional (except for the delay in deleting the last footage, which was intentional but he did not have time to watch it). The charger/camera with the razor plugged in was big and in a VERY obvious/prominent location--I am sure that everyone saw it but didn't dare to think that they were being recorded. This would be VERY uncharacteristic behavior for my husband. He is not someone who is known to do anything creepy to this extent (though he did hide the Ozempic secret and had a camera to protect it, so that's a lie in itself). 

If it were intentional, I am sure he would be much more discrete...hence the effort to hide the camera/Ozempic in the first place. There was no password on his phone or the app, and his story that he installed the app again to check for footage does check out as to why the notifications were so blatantly showing up on his home/lock screen (ex. no time to disable app notifications). And, we have these people over all the time--plenty of opportunities to do this in the past. 

However, he has created a situation where now I have to keep his ""secret"" from our friends. If he cheated or it was more cut and dry, I would at least be able to tell people...this is another level. I have told my mom and he told his mother/sister. All three of them think that his side of the story is plausible but say they understand if I decide to leave him. 

He and I talked for hours about this and he had a somewhat plausible answer for everything--I inquired about every minute detail but am leaving some of the specifics out here given the public nature of the post. He has been very emotional and says he swears he absolutely did not intentionally capture the footage, but understands if I make the decision that I can't trust him again. He has started to see a therapist and I told him I would consider going with him in the future, whether we stay together or not. At this point in time, I have not given him an answer on whether I am staying or not. 

I really am trying to put myself in his shoes. If his story was true and I accidentally captured footage of his friends on my phone, would I immediately delete it or peek out of curiosity before deleting it? I want to say I would immediately delete it, but in honesty, I may have peeked too? I would never install a secret camera or be this stupid, but I have made my own mistakes in the past. 

In other words, I have every reason to leave and the important people in our lives would understand--I think even he would. I am really just looking for your input on what I should do. I wish it were more black and white but I don't want to cut someone I care about loose for what could have been an honest/drunken mistake, and a really really bad ""first offense"" in an otherwise good relationship.

1h621hc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeePH/comments/1h621hc/does_starbucks_philippines_offer_other_types_of/,"Does Starbucks Philippines offer other types of espresso shots? I know they have ""ristretto"" (shorter pull w/ less water), but do they also offer long shots or ""lungo"" (longer extraction w/ more water)? Similarly, do they have the ""Blonde Espresso"" that I hear about from their US branches?","Whenever I find myself in a standard Starbucks—perhaps due to a meeting or when I need to unwind after running errands and there are no better cafes around—my go-to drinks are either an iced Americano made with their default, signature espresso shots or, when I'm craving something closer to a Flat White, a hot latte made with *ristretto* shots (plus one more).

The ristretto shot has been my preferred option for their lattes ever since I discovered it years ago. Recently, this got me thinking: does our Starbucks offer other types of espresso pulls, like the *lungo* (also known as the ""long shot"")? I know it has more caffeine, and I’m curious to see how it would change the standard Americano.

I've also heard that the US stores of Starbucks have recently begun offering *Blonde Espresso*, which uses lighter roast (maybe, blonde or medium?) beans instead of their signature, dark roast beans that make up the normal espresso shot. Is that available here as well? I’d love to play around with that (given its likely less harsh flavor profile).

Just to clarify, I’m aware that Starbucks' coffees aren’t known for their high quality, but maybe I could experiment with the traditional espresso drinks they offer and spice things up during those times I find myself there.

Are there any former or current Starbucks baristas or knowledgeable individuals here who could confirm this? Appreciate any insight on the matter and thanks in advance! :-)

(TL;DR: I've been drinking ristretto at SB for years, but lately, I'd like to switch things up and find out if they also offer other types of espresso.)",1,1733269795.0,CoffeePH,0,1.0,False

She mentioned her boyfriend had a friend who she thought I would like. I wasn’t interested because I’m in a long distance relationship with a guy who’s currently in England but I needed a “date” to semi formal so I agreed if it was strictly platonic. 

We start talking (with my BFs permission) and I started getting a little frustrated because he was acting kind of like a pick me, calling himself ugly and stuff. I didn’t even know what he looked like and when he finally sent me a picture he looked like my dad 30 years younger. When I showed my sister she was shocked and said that if we had a brother he probably would like him. I immediately told my big and she told me he looks different in person and to be open minded. 

I talked with my boyfriend and he said he wasn’t comfortable anymore so I told the guy he was nice but I’d rather stop talking. I texted my big and told her I wasn’t going to meet up with the guy and it was nice of her to try. She left me on read and when I tried to talk to her today she fully ignored me. I don’t know if I hurt the guy’s feelings and he told her boyfriend.

1h61x1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1h61x1s/trip_report_santa_fe/,Trip Report: Santa Fe,"Hi all. I posted many months ago here ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/196ttil/october_us_mountain_luxury_resort/)) looking for recommendations for a 10th anniversary trip. The responses were extremely helpful so thanks again to everyone who chimed in. After weeks (maybe months?) of deliberations, we opted for an option on the leaner end of chubby - a trip to Santa Fe and Ten Thousand Waves. The Blackberry properties and Twin Farms in Vermont were part of the final decision but with some other large expenditures in 2024 we decided on the leanest option. This is my first trip report. Let me know if there’s anything I should have/should not have included.

 We flew into Santa Fe in late October for five days and four nights. Half in downtown and half at Ten Thousand Waves in the mountains outside of town. The weather was great - lows in the 50s and highs in the upper 60s. It was the smallest airport I've ever been to, with two gates and only American and United commuter flights. It was surprising for a state capital. We looked at flying into Albuquerque but there were no directs and it was another hour of travel/logistics, and we ended up with fine flight times and layovers. There are few Ubers/Lyfts and no cab service. There are private car companies that hustle you into the car, and they charge you an arm and a leg. It was like $65 to get to downtown, a 25-minute drive. We should have waited for an Uber. Looking at the app later, we could have gotten to downtown for less than half and only waited a little bit longer.

 We stayed two nights at Rosewood Inn of the Anasazi and paid over $900/night. The reviews were good, and it seemed like the nicest hotel in downtown Santa Fe. It's not worth that rate at all. Half would be more appropriate. You are somewhat paying for location, but there are plenty of other options downtown. The hotel and room were nice, don't get me wrong, but it didn't go the extra mile to justify that high of a rate. They did not help us with bags, no gym, no pool, and the included breakfast was only croissants and coffee. We did get free margaritas upon arrival which was fun. The staff were nice enough on site, but I was disappointed with the communication ahead of time - I tried to schedule a tequila tasting with them and despite many emails to different people, follow up emails, phone calls with a promise of calling right back it never got scheduled. We ended up finding a Tequila tasting at a restaurant which was much cheaper and I'm sure way better. More on that below.

The room was small, and the bathroom was tiny. The showerhead was a $20 one from Home Depot. I would expect a lot more. It was nicely decorated in what you would expect for Santa Fe, as were the common areas and lobby. Santa Fe style is not necessarily luxurious, but they could have done more to make the experience nice. The housekeeping services (morning and turn down) were superb. We were impressed with their attention to detail every time we came back to the room. It's what you would expect for the rate we paid.

We scheduled a private dinner (and had good communication with the chef and restaurant manager, unlike the tastings people). It was a five-course meal with wine pairings in a private room with a fireplace. The chef customized the menu for us, staying clear of allergies and highlighting his style and local cuisine. The restaurant manager checked on us multiple times and the server was attentive even though we were away from the main dining room. The food was 4/5 stars. It was all good but missing that extra something. The service, atmosphere, and overall experience was 5/5. I'd recommend staying elsewhere and coming to Rosewood Inn for this dinner if interested in a private dinner. The wine pairings were all great choices, and we got some sipping tequila at the end. The price with tip and wine pairings was around $400. My wife and I both felt it was a good price for what we got.

Our other fancy meal downtown was at Sazon, and we also did a tequila tasting there a few hours before our dinner reservation. Everything about Sazon was 5/5 stars. One of the best meals I've ever had. Amazing local cuisine, great drinks, excellent service, and a fun atmosphere. The tequila tasting was a lot of fun and was a good deal at $45 per person. We learned a lot and had some great drinks and house made mole.

Other things we did and places we ate that I recommend:

Meow Wolf (must see/do)

Kanawha Chocolate House (good snack/dessert stop)

Café Pasqual’s (great food and giant cappuccinos)

The Pantry (casual local meal near Meow Wolf)

Iconik Coffee Shop (great espresso)

Santa Fe Hemp (awesome little gift shop, tons of fun things)

Fusion Tacos food truck (great birria tacos and smoothies; there are a few trucks in this spot south of the capitol building area. Went for the Santafamous Street Eats truck which was closed but Fusion Tacos worked out great!)

We walked around Santa Fe for a day and a half and that was plenty. That included time on the art road, Georgia O'Keefe museum, churches, the ""oldest"" house in the US (their claim), dipping into stores, and we even happened to catch a few songs from the musical Oklahoma inside the biggest church. There were more museums to do but we had hit a few and it was enough.

Ten Thousand Waves (10kW) told me that having our own car was a must, so we rented through Turo. First time using Turo, and it was pretty easy. It was less than 30 minutes to get from downtown out to the mountains and 10kW. On out way out we stopped for a hike at the Dale Ball Trails - Sierra del Norte Trailhead. There are plenty of options/routes and we had a nice hike.

The TLDR of Ten Thousand Waves was that it was perfect in every possible way. Check in was quick and easy. You get waterproof wristbands which give you access to your private house and all the spa areas. The room was $460/night and we stayed in a lovely suite named Bessou. It was very private, tastefully decorated, and spacious. Kimonos and overcoats were provided to walk around the grounds. We opted for the charcuterie and sake waiting for us upon arrival. The charcuterie box was excellent, and we nibbled on it for the entire stay it was so big. The stove in the room already had logs and was ready to go for a nice fire. The house was just perfect. A very relaxing place to spend time between eating and the spa.

Restaurant: 5/5 stars. We had two dinners and a lunch at the restaurant and had new things every time (except the crunchy tuna rolls which we had twice they were so good). The lunch menu is a bit different (burger was excellent). The sake list is extensive, and they were a great help in picking sakes and adjusting to what we liked and didn’t like. All the food was great. Everything was a highlight, so I don’t feel a need to list dishes out ha. Cooking wagyu on the hot stone was fun and a unique experience. We could have eaten there one or two more times without getting tired of it. We are a bit picky when it comes to cocktails and the ones we had were excellent (don't recall the name but the purple gin and pear drink was exceptional). The restaurant service was excellent. Only having one dining option turned out to be a-ok. For breakfast they deliver a box to your room. It was the same thing both mornings. The food was good, but it would have been nice to have some variety.

Spa: 5/5 stars. We had their signature shiatsu massages which were AMAZING. Highly recommend. We rented a private hot tub and that was a great experience (our tub was Ichiban). The outdoor area with the hot tub and day bed backed up to woods and was very private. No one could see us, and we felt like we were the only ones there. There was a sauna as part of the private rental too. You can go to the grand bath anytime when you are staying there and we spent plenty of time there. It never felt crowded and was a lovely place to be. There’s a cold plunge pool and a sauna too. It was so peaceful and wonderful in all aspects. We also tried the foot bath and meditation room. There are plenty of showers and lockers.

All in all, an amazing hotel/spa. We did one other hike near the hotel which was my favorite hike I’ve ever done. It was at Hyde Memorial State Park, and we did the Circle Trail. If you do this hike, go clockwise so you go up the steep part instead of down. Could definitely feel the elevation and we were huffing and puffing but did not get sick. Two days in downtown before the big hike may have helped.

We had an amazing vacation! Thanks again to everyone who responded to my previous post. Lots more places to try! And hopefully this helps anyone thinking about Santa Fe and Ten Thousand Waves. Happy to answer any questions.

1h61sio,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1h61sio/special_days_ruined/,Special days ruined,"This is just kind of a rant. But my dad uses gifts to try to control our relationship. Since I am what everyone here appears to be calling 'greyrocking' it. I was getting married this year and he suggested the parents split the cost of food four-ways (all divorced). Before the wedding, he gave me an ultimatum not to invite a certain uncle on my mom's side or he will not pay his share. I invited the uncle, and one day before the wedding my dad went to his house to intimidate his wife when she was alone with two babies and telling her not to come to the wedding. They showed up since I invited them. Then at the time of gift giving he made a snide remark about how much this decision 'cost me'. I didn't care about the money and told him so. But I couldn't help but feel as if all he did was super vile. You go to a woman's house, wait for her husband to leave and then threaten her? (I've learned of this after midnight at the wedding, my mom told me what he did, they did not want to tell me earlier not to upset me on my special day).  Him giving this remark is when I realised my father did not care one bit about me. Sadly this had to be in that exact moment on my special day. So I can say he ruined my wedding, by making me feel like crap for 45ish minutes after the realisation. But okay, I am a big girl and can handle it now with my support system so I just started ignoring him. 

Two days later, he shows up unannounced at my house, to 'show me' a new car his friend bought. I was not very upset as he did not try to go inside (I had company). But I looked at the car and was neutral. He left after about 15 minutes.

Since then I've only contacted him to congratulate his birthday.

Fast forward to my birthday (today) which is when he decided he will show up unannounced again and just barge into my front door without knocking! I was shocked, it wasn't just him. He brought his 2 friends to 'surprise' me with a gift and some flowers. I felt pressured, I was at home in my comfy clothes and not at all 'ready' to entertain guests (one of which I am meeting for the first time). My husband was in his room getting dressed quickly, as we were not expecting company. I was nice, made them coffee, served them pastry. But I did not invite them and had other plans for the day. I feel like this is just his way of trying to 'dominate' and control the situation, as by showing up unannounced he had stolen control over my time.

When they left, I texted him that if he'd called earlier I'd have made his favorite pastry. But he didn't get it - he said he wanted to 'surprise' me. I told him I hate surprises, and he didn't text anything. 

So all of that got me thinking - I cannot allow this to happen again as it has disrupted my peace for hours even after he left! 
It's really not worth it being nice, yall. Just be what you need to be to keep your peace.

So two hours later I texted him again, that if he shows up unannounced again, no matter the 'occassion' I will not let him in. He made a remark about 'wanting to cheer me up' with the surprise. (I guess a cheap attempt at making me feel guilty about setting a firmer boundary). Then he said there will not be another time for which I just sent him a thumbs up emoji. Tomorrow I am mailing him the gift back. I don't want any gifts with strings attached.

Christ, I am tired. I just want to sleep. But I can't sleep because people are shit. You do not control my time. I control my time and what happens in my day. 
If something like this happens again I am for sure going NC.

I’ll then offer a million other things while he’s crying until eventually he throws his body on the floor and starts banging his forehead on the floor.

Extreme Hypnogogic experience!!! ,"Okay so I’ve been on a juice fast for 10 days but yesterday I had a 3 hour meeting ahead of me and was absolutely exhausted I hate coffee but stopped at Starbucks before the meeting and asked for the biggest cup.

I was so annoyed when the cup was the size of my head because I thought how am I gonna finish this but I powered through because I knew I would pass out in the meeting if I didn’t. And I finished it around 2pm. 

Fast forward to night time I am so wired but my body is fast asleep as I have no energy from the juice fast and BOOM I have no idea how to put this into text but my body was asleep and my mind was awake and when I closed my eyes I was lucid dreaming when I opened them I was in my room. Closed them fully lucid and in control of a lucid dream closed them awake in my room and this lasted about half an hour!!!

Here’s the craziest part y’all. When I closed my eyes. I could jump into whatever dream I wanted if I thought of it I was there if I opened my eyes I was in my room. I was lucid dreaming AWAKE. I honestly felt like I had full fledge super powers like I cracked the code of the matrix I was like because of coffee???? That is all I took not a single supplement because I’m juice fasting it was just vegetable juice and coffee that’s all I had. 

At some point my eyes were half closed half open and the lucid dream was visible in my room like watching a movie on a projector and I could still control it if I shut my eyes completely I would just be in the dream I had absolutely no idea what was happening but I was having so much fun!!! The second craziest part you guys I thought if I move this is gonna stop so I tried my hardest to stay still but eventually had to shift my body. It didn’t stop. I literally turned onto my stomach and it continued???? The last dream? Vision? I don’t know what to call it because I wasn’t asleep was literally something out of The Never Ending Story all my dreams were in first person and I’m looking at these two huge rocky mountains at night, one had crazy wind spinning everywhere and the other BLAZING flames and omg I could feel everything the wind was blowing my hair in every direction and I could feel the heat from the flames as they were blinding my eyes once again if I opened my eyes I would just be in my bed. Then it stopped.

In the morning I went straight to Google and found out about Hypnogogia!? Has anyone experienced anything similar to this I’ve never done psychedelics but I imagine I experienced something similar to like a lucid DMT or Mushroom trip??? I am absolutely enchanted by my experience and gonna try this method again! I can’t believe caffeine isn’t as big a method as anything else if I can do this every night omg or somehow learn to do this in the day even without coffee??? I feel like Neyo! I truly had a magical experience that I can only explain as jumping realms in real time and whilst this isn’t my first supernatural experience I woke up knowing without a doubt that nothing is real and this waking life is only ONE dimension and reality because I went to so many worlds completely lucid whilst awake last night and it’s all true everything about the multiverse is true I will never be the same.

I am 27F, extensive background in engineering technology. I am almost finished with my technology degree in robotics/manufacturing automation, will receive a certificate in mechanical design in Spring, and next year will be transferring to finish my controls engineering degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering to a top uni soon too. I was unable to go to college at a ""normal"" age because of distance with my parents for not being the daughter they wanted. Could not draw FAFSA due to their wealth, had to wait until 24 to see if I qualified alone only to find I must pay out of pocket because the earnings restrictions are tight. I am seeking a degree because while I have worked in great projects my whole life being without a degree has increasingly made me the company pack mule, underpaid as well. Recently my job shut down and I found a new job, thinking I struck gold.

  
I am programming engineering software to automate generation of solid models, blueprints, G-code, estimating, etc from a few user inputs. It's going well. Small team, small company. They will even let me work 32 hours a week next semester so I can do school. This is a godsend because my semesters are all over 15 credit hours due to transfer requirements. But I am the only person with any computer knowledge on this team. My senior only has a certificate to do CAD drafting. He's not very polite either, I'm trying my best to be nice about it. He often assigns me to lackey work which I don't complain but do, then finds ways to get upset about it while inventing things about computer science that simply don't exist. Or contradict each other day to day depending on what he needs to complain about. This requires me rewriting hundreds of lines of code a day, and he pins the blame for the deadline going back on me despite me having all of my tasks done.

  
I let it slide this whole time. Let him dictate his ""knowledge"" of programming to me and would rewrite to his liking. Tried kindly to suggest the correct way of doing things in polite words while being as little about it as I could, was talked to like I'm stupid. It hurts. Every day I would go to my lunch at the nearest gas station to talk to the two older ladies there while I had coffee. I don't even like coffee I just want someone nice to talk to because my life is a circle of being disrespected at work, then coming home to slough through school. Anywhom yesterday I was pulled aside by my supervisor that I had been reported for clocking out and going to the gas station for coffee on my break, when we have coffee here. I didn't see the issue but said I'd stop. My coworkers go to the gas stations too. I didn't understand. She also kept bringing up that I don't work like I should etc etc etc. I realized my senior reported me as if I was the issue in the programming. And I was being restricted like a performance increase notice.

The loss of talking to the gas station ladies hurt so bad I cried to sleep last night. Today I came in and hit my final straw I think. I got chewed out for using a boolean variable. He wanted me to go through and rewrite thousands of lines of code referring to this true or false thing, but instead of referencing if it's true or not, I have to individually if-branch for every precursory condition because he can't understand booleans. I politely tried to explain that a boolean would be better for memory usage (he is always scathing me about processing times and memory, but he doesn't even know Visual Basic which we are working with and my native programming languages are C++ and embedded C). He slammed down that I will rewrite everything ""because \[I\] SAID so."" So I began doing that.

  
Guys do I keep doing this? This is resume gold but I've only been here 4 months. They're willing to work with me on my college schedule, they pay better than anything else I'll get. Health insurance too. Nothing else is out here in the boonies. This is resume gold. One of my tabs is open to apply to Chipotle for their high tuition assistance. Idk if I can do it financially but emotionally I can't take being treated like this over something that is I'm sorry to admit the only thing I have and an autistic special interest.

Is it?,"So hi I'm (20M) and I really struggle with keeping food down my throat I mean I'm fighting myself I often accidentally throw up most of the times when it comes up I just swallow it as soon as it reaches the end of my throat because last time also it happened when I crossed a certain weight number. I have been fast all my life have a significantly high bmi. Now I know that might not sound too severe but it got my friends (my then gf especially) really worried. I still do eat yes I hate eating. Eating food often sucks but once I start I can't stop eating. I am throwing myself in guilty because I'm eating but yet I can't stop thinking about food yet the moment it's in front of me I don't want it anymore.

There is a very high change as per my usual life in just 2 days itself. I promised a close one that I'll work on it and keep eating I just don't want to and with exams coming I just drink ample of black coffee so I don't even feel hunger anymore. Sometimes if I'm out with my friends I'll force a bite down my throat because I don't want to worry them. I really don't know what to do. Is it really an eating disorder or do you think it's all in my head?

TLDR: I think I have anorexia. I'm not sure. It last time got triggered when I crossed the ""limit"". Then I lost to much weight in justa fortnight and recently it's been faster and more severe

1h61h1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1h61h1r/using_a_customers_personal_cup/,Using a Customer’s Personal Cup,"Hi ya’ll! I work in a local coffee shop/café  and have been having issues with a particular customer that had started coming about a couple of weeks ago. We’ve never seen him before, he came in once and chatted with us and then has been back every day since. 

The problem is— he brings this filthy insulated cup. We started having to pour the rest of our pot of coffee out because it came very close to his cup (duh— we filled it up). We also scrub our hands after and disinfect everything because of how disgusting this cup is. 

This is not the only problem. He has started coming BEHIND the counter and hovering over us and got so close to my teenage coworker (this man is in his 40s) that his foot was between her own. Not only this, but he decided to drop off a huge box of sugar with his name written on it in sharpie and we don’t have any storage room for that. 

I’m the only manager, and all but one of my coworkers are teenagers and I am 25, so I took it amongst myself to tell him yesterday that we can no longer fill his personal cup. I did not mention the hygiene of it, or anything, and he very much does not like me taking his order because I set boundaries and enforce them. My coworkers don’t even want to take his order because he creeps them out so bad, so I have to stand up there to watch him the entire time. 

I told him very calmly that we can no longer fill up his personal cup, but we can use one of our cups and he can put it in there himself. I even asked him if it was okay before I did so, and he said ‘Yes’ but I could tell that he was pissed. 

Today I stood up there with my coworker because, again, they won’t deal with them by themselves. I walked away for maybe 20 seconds and he had asked her who I was. She told him I was her manager, and he scrunched his face up in disgust and said ‘SHE’S your manager?” 

I guess I’m just trying to see if anyone else has had any experience with this sort of thing and if I’m doing the right thing. I’m very protective of my coworkers, and my boss’ teenage daughters also work there. I’ve made her aware of the situation, but I have anxiety that he’s gonna complain and say I’m ‘picking on him’ when that isn’t the case. Any advice or similar experiences? Thank you !!

1h61go3,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanebox/comments/1h61go3/my_sanebox_review_anyone_else_using_sanebox_and/,My Sanebox review: anyone else using Sanebox and want to compare notes?,"Is anyone else out there using Sanebox to keep their inbox under control? 

I somehow only just learned about it, but it’s definitely making a difference.

I wrote a quick review that I’d like to share. Maybe we could compare notes and exchange tips if you’re a Sanebox user too?

If you've never heard of it (I know I hadn't until recently), Sanebox is a plugin tool that integrates into your inbox and uses AI to organize your emails into folders.

Now, yes, I know, you can do that manually, but with an inbox standing at 3,892 unreads, who has time for that?

*Yeah, I don't know how it got so bad either, but I do know that adding Sanebox stopped me getting anxiety attacks every time I checked my messages.* 

When you first connect it, you get four new folders by default:

https://preview.redd.it/8z9tnrytvp4e1.jpg?width=719&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=366f2acb2007652a969a7f59c80df072d6c293e6



**@Sanereceipts -** Not just receipts, but coupons and anything else relating to transactions. 

**@Sanennews** \- Newsletters etc..

**@Sanelater** \- Sanebox automatically moves anything it thinks is 'unimportant' into this folder. 

The idea is that your actual inbox includes nothing except emails that need your attention ASAP. 

From there, you can create new folders and move emails into different ones to create a system that works for you. 

https://preview.redd.it/2hjgthexvp4e1.jpg?width=609&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cb2e5e94f6a20d9cf311693cef74cb4e2a91c2ba



For example, I just set up this WordPress folder because I realized I was getting a ton of messages about websites I manage, and it's easier to put them together. 

Every time you move things around, you're essentially training Sanebox to automatically sort messages into these folders based on subject or sender.

https://preview.redd.it/1kl8bmw1wp4e1.jpg?width=596&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d89d026557258feda8a5916242692fd812c3b16





It takes some time, but let's just say that my unread inbox messages now stand in the single figures rather than the thousands. 



**Other SaneBox Features I love** 

**Limited access permissions -** The good thing for privacy concerns is that you have to give Sanebox permission to access Gmail data every six months.

You can opt-in to allowing the app ongoing access (meaning no 6 month review), but I'm having a hard time wondering why anybody would do that. 

**Daily Digests -** A daily summary of everything that lands in your inbox so that you never miss anything even if you don't check all your folders that day. 

**Reasonable Cost -** I pay around $7 a month for 2 inboxes. That might seem a lot just for email folders, but I’d rather pay that than deal with more inbox anxiety any day.



**What Sanebox Could Do Better** 

The one thing I really don't like about Sanebox is that it can be super slow. 

Don't get me wrong, it's still quicker than organizing 3,000+ emails one-by-one by hand. 

I just found the set-up experience took longer than I'd liked, and Sanebox never seems to be in any hurry to activate new folders. 

The other big drawback for me is that Sanebox itself sends far too many emails for a service that’s supposedly all about clutter-free inboxes. 

*It’s like bringing a hose to a dumpster fire but occasionally throwing a few pieces of garbage into the flames to keep it raging.* 



**Who Should Use Sanebox? A Quick Summary** 

Before I wrap up, I thought I should point out that even though I’ve talked a lot about using Sanebox for Gmail, it’s not a Gmail-specific tool. 

I also use it with Apple Mail on my iPhone, and it also supports: 

* Outlook
* Yahoo! Mail 
* AOL 

And several others. 

I point this out, because I’d recommend Sanebox to anyone whose inbox is overloaded with thousands of unreads, no matter what provider they use. 

If you DON’T want the chore of manually filtering messages into folders (who does?), but you DO want a clutter-free inbox that lets you sort the important stuff from the not-so-important, it’s worth paying Sanebox the price of a cup of coffee each month to do it all for you. 

That’s my take anyway, what about you? 

Am I looking at this with rose-tinted specs and missing some obvious flaw?

Maybe there’s a better alternative out there I should consider instead? ",1,1733268253.0,sanebox,0,1.0,False

I met a very nice girl in the new class a joined about 4 weeks ago that I really like. First assignment and interaction I had with her, we were supposed to interview people on the street, but she proposed that we went to a local cafe for a coffee, so she could “learn more about me”. We went for a walk in the park afterwards. She seemed to laugh at my jokes and the overall experience felt really nice to me.

Next week we talked a little in school, but nothing special really happened. At the party on the weekend however we talked quite a lot again and I even followed her alone to the bus, even though her friends offered to let her stay or join them home. All the parties have been like that since then. We talk, have fun and go for walks in the middle of the night. It really feels like their is some kind of romantic tension. 

But then when the weekend’s over, its as if nothing had happened, she sticks to her friends and I to mine. We rarely converse at those times, besides the occational comment, but it feels more like talking to a friendly coworker than anything.

This has been going on for two weeks now, no interactions during the week, then a lot of attention in the weekend. What is the deal with thos situation? Is she quiet in the weekdays because she’s expecting me to make a move? Or is she just friendly? I’d be really grateful to hear your thoughts on the matter :))",1,1733268037.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

**TLDR:** CPA with a love of personal finance just short of 40 years old, married with two children under ten, with a lottery ticket that happened to have hit. Took long-term incentive in 90% options eight years ago, now $5.4M in net worth, $4.9M excluding primary residence, over 75% of that free and clear of any taxes. $180K/yr. in salary, and what remains of the equity carrot is \~$200K/yr. for the next two years. The carrot gets much smaller after that, and any future earnings/retention bonuses by staying employed are purely speculative. It is the most stressful job I have ever had in my life, and my physical and mental health have suffered.

I want to buy my time back and replace my income with cash flow from passive income, and ideally not 100% of it tied to the stock market as it is today.  Please hit me with your wisdom and a reality check, friends -- is now the time, finally?  
  
**Long-form:** I have been hesitant to put this out to the world for years – but I have stewed about this so much, I am starting to see double. I am going to include background as well; in hopes that you enjoy the read. 

10 years ago, my then girlfriend and now wife moved in together and started budgeting every penny of every dollar, which was both valuable to us - and therapeutic for me - logging bank/credit card activity with my morning coffee each day was my moment of Zen. We were able to learn some things very quickly. Did I need to be buying rounds for all my friends every time we went out? Did she need to be going to Starbucks five times a week? The data led us to a very intentional life financially, with my $100K/yr. salary and her $45K/yr. salary in a LCOL area, we were able to save, invest in 401K/Roth’s, and do the right things with our money.

In 2017 I started with a large public-company, and took my $200K signing bonus in options, which increased the amount of the award three times, but certainly with the risks that options inherently carry. For the next four years, the share price did not move. In 2020, it ballooned with 2000% growth. Our net worth grew to \~$9M post-tax. I always had $10M in my head as my walkaway number (without ever really having thought about it with any seriousness), and in one of the more regretful decisions of my life, I did not sell a single share. Share price came down shortly thereafter – a lot – rebounded a little bit -- and we exercised, held for the 1 year, and got out at 900% gain. The “exercise and hold” & “AMT 101” year was a period of where stress was at its very highest, sad to say. (regret #2: not considering Covered Calls). While we are still light-years ahead of where I ever thought we would be at our age, it is amazing that I cannot get over this feeling of guilt.

*Fast forward to today:*

NW: $5.4M, $4.9M excluding primary residence consisting of:

$ 0.3M – Cash/Savings/Money Market

$ 3.9M – Large Cap, VOO, dividend stocks

$ 0.6M – Retirement (401K, Roth’s)

$ 0.1M – Education Plans, EE Bonds

 

Other than our mortgage, we are debt-free. (The bridge of NW to NW without primary residence is: $ 0.9M – House, $0.6M net of mortgage.)

 

My wife is not working anymore, and the job I would be walking away from includes the following:  
  
$180K/yr. Salary

$150K/yr. Equity for the next two years (RSU this time)

Fully paid health-insurance

Post-tax ESPP which Company provides at a 15% discount to market

401K match is quite low

Any future equity carrots are purely speculative, but the last one I received was for $500K over four years.

 

We have proven to ourselves that we can live quite comfortably burning $11-13K/mo. and can certainly hearken back to the days of penny pinching if necessary. If abiding by the 4% withdrawal school of thought, this puts money in right around where our expense level is expected to be. But not way above…. hence the extra precaution and second and third guessing.

My wife and I would like to walk away from corporate world and spend as much time as possible with our children in these early years. Our eldest needs extra support in school, and there have been countless times I have felt that he just needs his dad, and I am stuck at work. It wounds me in a way that is hard to put into words.

 

**Ask #1: Can we afford to walk away?**

While the answer to question #1 might be “yes”, I am not in love with the idea walking away whilst 100% reliant on the stock market. My gut tells me that owning an apartment complex or something similar is a little less sexy, but more bankable than having 100% of our NW in the stock market.

As the kids get a little older, I would like to try my hand at more actively participating in Real-estate, but my first few years would hopefully be to just buy, hold, let cash flow help cover our expenses, let the stress subside and recover my health.

**Ask #2: Is this passive real-estate idea sound, or am I missing something integral to the equation?**

**Ask #3: Would you consider doing something completely different than the above, if answer to #1 is “yes”?**

little background info: 

My bio parents passed away when I was 14, and I got adopted by my current guardians: Marcie (67 F) and Pat (65 M)- My bio parents knew them and thought they would be a good fit for me if anything happened to them. 

I moved in with them when I was 14, and I just recently turned 18 in October. Marcie and I don’t really get along, I’m not sure what changed, we used to get along well but within the last year, she’s been cold, and we get in arguments over small things. Now, onto the story. 

Monday I woke up at 2AM. I had school and I knew if I went back to sleep I’d wake up late. So i decided to have some coffee and stay up til I started getting ready (normally around 5) I Sat for a little over an hour on my phone and started to get hungry and was craving some bacon. So I went to the kitchen and microwaved some bacon. All was okay, I cooked 5 pieces, nothing was burnt. I went to my room and ate the bacon. 

About 15 minutes later, I heard Marcie come downstairs to put our dog outside. Then, she came and banged on my bedroom door and she immediately started yelling. She said that she woke up and smelled something burning, so she jumped out of bed because she “thought the house was on fire”. She said that she tripped on the dog in the dark, causing her to hit her head, and told me that that it was all my fault for cooking the bacon. 

I explained I just wanted some bacon, and I didn’t mean to scare her. She didn’t reply, and just asked if I cooked all of the bacon. I told her no and that I only made 5 pieces. She just glared at me and slammed my bedroom door and went back to her room (which is upstairs). 

I just sat on my phone because I was kind of shaken up. Then she texted me, telling me that Patrick would be driving me to school because she has a huge goose egg on her head, and is seeing double. I just texted back “Ok, sorry you fell”. 

Later on before Pat got home, I thought it would be nice of me to go upstairs and tell Marcie I was sorry she got hurt and it was never my intention to scare her. So, I went upstairs and I told her I wanted to say I was sorry for worrying her, and that she hit her head. after a minute of awkward silence she said that I shouldn’t have cooked the bacon and she wouldn’t have fell. She said it was all on me for cooking it, causing the house to smell like it was on fire. 

Pat took me to school and in the evening after dinner, when Pat left for work, I decided to go upstairs to talk to Marcie again. I told her that although she got hurt from smelling the beacon, it upset me when she yelled in my face. She then told me that I upset her, and that she wasn’t going to apologize for yelling, because it’s “normal”. 

Idk what to do anymore, many things have happened and she seems to make me try and feel as guilty as possible. My therapists say that she’s a narcissist. I know I’m in the wrong for cooking the bacon so early in the morning, I just feel like my feelings are being dismissed.

1h612x4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ILoveHistory1/comments/1h612x4/i_am_worried_for_night_raydes_on_fanfictionnet/,I am worried for Night Raydes on Fanfiction.net ,"Recently, on November 25, Night Raydes posted on their authors page and on all of their fanfics this:

**Chapter One: The Night Raydes Meltdown Show**

Once upon a dreary night, in the darkest corner of an even darker room, there lived a writer—me, Night Raydes. Well, 'lived' might be a generous term. Let's go with 'existed'—much like that leftover pizza that's one bad sniff away from being hazardous waste. I had once been a beacon of literary hope, inspired by the grand fanfiction tales of a legendary scribe known only as Ruskbyte. But now, my inspiration had all but drained away, much like the funding for my food budget. Seriously, who knew living could be so expensive?

I sat hunched over my laptop, the dim glow of the screen casting an eerie light across the room. The latest fanfiction masterpiece was up on the screen, cursor blinking in the cruel silence, mocking me with its insistence on existence. All I received these days were reviews that were more about selling art commissions than actual feedback.

""Hey, wanna buy my anime-style portraits of your characters?"" one review squawked. ""Check out my Etsy store!""

I rolled my eyes so hard I almost saw my own brain. ""No, Brenda, I don't want to buy your art. Also, if you're reading this—fuck off.""

My health situation wasn’t helping either. My headspace was darker than the bottom of a well in a blackout during a solar eclipse. My body was an assortment of complaints and aches, and the chronic state of being broke added that extra flavor of desperation. If I had to choose between buying food or my next prescription, the decision was always hilariously grim. Spoiler alert: I could never afford either.

Writing had once been my sanctuary, a place where words flowed like a river of creativity. Now it was more like a trickle from a rusty faucet—occasionally surprising but mostly just annoying. Every new alert from the fanfiction platform was another stab to the heart. Views and story alerts, sure. But comments? Those were as rare as a unicorn in a Walmart parking lot.

""The next person who sends me a spammy review gets a personal invite to go jump off a cliff,"" I muttered, fingers flying across the keyboard.

I could remember the good old days, when I was filled with a sense of purpose. But those days seemed like a distant memory now. All the hard work, late nights, and coffee-fueled writing sessions had culminated in nothing but solicitations from amateur artists and an alarming amount of self-doubt.

""No thanks,"" I typed furiously to an imaginary audience. ""It's not even about the thanks anymore. It's about the fundamental lack of appreciation for the craft. What’s the point if nobody cares?""

I sighed, the weight of it all pressing down like a ten-ton anvil. Maybe it was time to take a long walk off a short pier. At least that would be an adventure.

But for now, I did what I did best: I wrote. And maybe, just maybe, that was enough.

So here’s to me—the resilient, the weary, the wordsmith fighting against the dying light. Because sometimes, the best stories come from the darkest places. And sometimes, even in the blackest pit, you’ve gotta find a way to laugh at it all. Because if you don't laugh, well, you’ll probably start screaming. And nobody wants that.

The end of the beginning.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

1h60zlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1h60zlf/i_am_a_moron_and_author_of_my_own_pain_also_joe/,I am a moron and author of my own pain. Also Joe Abercrombie is great.,"So I've been seeing Joe Abercrombie's name a lot for a while and he always seems to be highly praised and I figured it was time to give it a go. I don't like to have plots spoiled so I avoided much discussion of his books but I got The First Law trilogy as a gift and have been working through the first book, The Blade Itself.

Well, it surely lives up to the hype, and I'm over here having a jolly good time with all these great characters and wonderful prose. Great times. Loving life.

But then, my friends, comes the moment I shatter my own dreamy existence. For there I am, earlier today, standing in a bookstore browsing the shelves with a coffee, things are looking good - too good, one might say - when I spy the section dedicated to our man Mr. Abercrombie.

Well, in my infinite wisdom I think ""boy, I sure do love the very first book so far in this *very long and expansive world*, I wonder what other things this man has written"". So I pick up a book called A Little Hatred, the first in a different series entirely thinking surely I am in no danger.

No, no, my friends. That series is set in the same world as The First Law. Not only that, but if you were to start reading the blurb on the back of A Little Hatred you might even find what could be charitably called MASSIVE FUCKING STORY SPOILERS because *duhhh, obviously*, the second series is set *after* the first one.

I was only three sentences in when I alerted the two guys next to me to the situation with the horrendous sound I unleashed as I cast the book back to the shelf in horror. They chose to continue their conversation in another part of the store, clearly understanding my need for space in this difficult time.

I came home to share this painful experience with you all as I don't know anyone else to reads this sort of thing and... oh... oh no...

...OH MY GOD.

I just went to look at the blurb of A Little Hatred again simply to write this nonsense post lamenting my own stupidity... and I read beyond the third sentence and OH MY FUCKING GOD. I JUST DID IT AGAIN.

I'm currently doing an Erasmus in Warsaw. One week ago I saw a cute girl in my street. I approached her by telling her that she look beautiful. She was very flattered by the compliment and asked for my name. I asked her if she wanted to grab a coffee the next week or something after we find out we live 2 buildings next to eachother. She liked that idea so we exchanged numbers. We started sending messages to eachother in english, but suddenly she started answering them in Polish lol and even 3 days after I approached her she stopped responding in general. A week later I was sitting with a friend of uni on the metro, suddenly my friend whispers to me: 'there is a girl gazing towards us.' I immediately recognized her but I didn't do anything except giving a friendly smile. She kept on looking at me straight in the eyes without emotion, she got off from the metro by using the door where I stood (even tho that wasn't the closest one for her). The rest of that whole day I was like: 'Should I do anything?', I showed her my interest, she saw me another time right now, If she is interested she can just reply on my last message right? I don't get this inconsistent interest.... Women",1,1733266897.0,AskMenAdvice,3,1.0,False

# Introduction: Redefining Long-Tail Keyword Research with AI

Hey there! Let's talk about something that can make a big difference in your online presence: long-tail keywords. These are the longer, more specific phrases people type into search engines when they're looking for something particular. They're super important for SEO (that's search engine optimization, by the way) because they help you connect with people who are really interested in what you're offering.

Now, finding these keywords used to be a real headache. It took ages and you could only dig up so much. But guess what? AI is changing the game. It's making it easier, better, and way more efficient to find these golden nuggets of information. Let's dive in and see how AI is revolutionizing the way we approach long-tail keyword research.

# Understanding Long-Tail Keywords in SEO

# What Are Long-Tail Keywords?

Long-tail keywords are like the hidden gems of the search world. They're those longer, more specific phrases that people type into search engines when they're looking for something really particular. For example, instead of just searching for ""shoes,"" someone might search for ""comfortable running shoes for flat feet."" That's a long-tail keyword.

These keywords are special because they're super specific, there's usually less competition for them, and they're really good at showing what the searcher actually wants. They're like a direct line to people who are interested in exactly what you're offering.

# How Do They Compare to Other Keywords?

Let's break it down:

1. Head keywords: These are short and broad, like ""shoes"" or ""coffee.""
2. Medium-tail keywords: A bit more specific, like ""running shoes"" or ""espresso machine.""
3. Long-tail keywords: The most specific, like ""best running shoes for marathon training"" or ""how to use an espresso machine for latte art.""

Long-tail keywords might not get as many searches as the broader terms, but here's the cool part: the people using these specific searches are often more likely to buy something or take action. They know what they want, and if you can provide it, you're golden.

# Why Long-Tail Keywords Matter

Using long-tail keywords in your content can really boost your website's performance. They help you:

1. Bring in people who are really interested in what you're offering.
2. Have a better chance of ranking higher in search results because there's less competition.
3. Improve your conversion rates because you're matching exactly what people are looking for.

It's like being the perfect answer to someone's very specific question. And when you're that answer, people are more likely to stick around and do business with you.

# The Role of AI in Long-Tail Keyword Research

# Speed and Efficiency: AI's Superpower

AI is like having a super-fast research assistant. It can plow through mountains of data in seconds, way faster than any human could. This means you can get a ton of keyword ideas in no time flat.

But it's not just about speed. AI is smart enough to understand what people are really looking for when they search. It can spot trends and figure out user behavior on a massive scale. This means you're not just getting fast results, you're getting smart results.

# Semantic Understanding: AI Gets Context

One of the coolest things about AI is how it understands language. Thanks to something called Natural Language Processing (NLP), AI can grasp the meaning behind search queries, not just the words themselves.

This means AI can:

* Figure out what words mean in different contexts
* Spot related terms and synonyms
* Understand the intent behind a search

So when someone searches for ""apple,"" AI can tell if they're looking for fruit or tech products based on the other words they use.

# Discovering Hidden Opportunities

AI is like a metal detector for hidden keyword treasures. It can spot niche keywords that regular tools might miss. By looking at patterns in how people search, AI can uncover new long-tail keywords you might never have thought of.

This is huge because it means you can find untapped markets and topics that your competitors might be overlooking. It's like having a secret map to buried keyword treasure.

# AI-Powered Tools for Long-Tail Keyword Discovery

Let's look at some cool AI tools that can help you find awesome long-tail keywords:

# Google Autocomplete with AI

You know how Google finishes your sentences when you start typing? That's Google Autocomplete, and now it's got AI helping it out. It's a great way to see what people are actually searching for.

# AI-Enhanced SEO Tools

Tools like Semrush, Ahrefs, and Surfer SEO now use AI to suggest keywords. They're not just spitting out random words – they're using smart algorithms to find keywords that really matter.

# ChatGPT and Other AI Models

ChatGPT is like having a brainstorming buddy. You can ask it to come up with niche long-tail keyword ideas, and it'll give you a bunch of creative suggestions.

These tools are great for:

* Grouping keywords by what people are trying to do (like buy something or learn something)
* Figuring out which keywords are worth going after based on how many people search for them and how tough the competition is
* Seeing what keywords your competitors are using and finding gaps you can fill

# Steps to Use AI for Long-Tail Keyword Research

# Step 1: Input Seed Keywords

Start with a basic idea. Let's say you sell coffee machines. You'd type ""coffee machines"" into an AI tool, and it might suggest things like:

* ""Best coffee machines under $200""
* ""How to clean a coffee machine""
* ""Espresso machines for small kitchens""

# Step 2: Analyze Search Intent

Now, use AI to figure out what people are trying to do with these searches. Are they:

* Looking for information? (""How does a French press work?"")
* Trying to buy something? (""Buy organic coffee beans online"")
* Looking for a specific website? (""Starbucks store locator"")

This helps you understand what kind of content to create.

# Step 3: Filter and Prioritize Keywords

Use AI to sort through your keywords. Look for ones that:

* Have enough people searching for them to be worth your time
* Aren't too competitive, so you have a chance of ranking
* Are super relevant to what you're offering

# Step 4: Incorporate Keywords into Content

Now comes the fun part – using these keywords in your content. AI can help here too:

* It can suggest article outlines
* Come up with subheadings
* Even help write meta descriptions

Just remember to use the keywords naturally. Don't force them in where they don't fit.

# Advantages of Using AI for Long-Tail Keywords

# Increased Precision

AI is like a sharpshooter for keywords. It can find super specific terms that are perfect for your niche audience. This means you're not just casting a wide net – you're using a laser-focused approach to attract exactly the right people.

# Scalability

With AI, you can generate keyword ideas for tons of different topics or industries in no time. It's like having a whole team of researchers working around the clock, but faster and without needing coffee breaks.

# Better Alignment with Search Intent

AI is really good at figuring out what people actually want when they search for something. This means the keywords you find are more likely to match what your potential customers are really looking for.

# Higher Organic Traffic and Conversions

When you use long-tail keywords that AI helps you find, you're more likely to show up in searches that really matter. This means more people coming to your site who are actually interested in what you're offering. And when people find exactly what they're looking for, they're more likely to stick around and maybe even buy something.

# Avoiding Common Mistakes When Using AI for Long-Tail Keywords

# Don't Rely Too Much on AI

AI is super smart, but it's not perfect. Always double-check what it suggests. Sometimes AI might come up with keywords that sound good but don't quite fit what your audience is looking for. Use your human judgment to make sure the keywords make sense for your business.

# Don't Ignore Context and Relevance

Just because a keyword has a lot of searches doesn't mean it's right for you. Make sure the AI-generated keywords actually fit with what you're offering and what your audience wants. For example, if you sell high-end coffee machines, a keyword like ""cheap coffee makers"" might not be the best fit, even if lots of people are searching for it.

# Avoid Keyword Stuffing

It's tempting to use all the cool keywords AI finds, but don't go overboard. Use them naturally in your content. If it sounds weird when you read it out loud, you're probably using too many keywords. Remember, you're writing for people, not just search engines.

# Expanding Your Reach with AI-Generated Keyword Clusters

AI can do this really neat thing where it groups related long-tail keywords together. This is super helpful for creating content that covers a topic thoroughly. Here's how you can use these clusters:

1. Create Pillar Content: This is a big, comprehensive piece of content that covers a main topic. Then, you can create smaller pieces that dive deeper into specific aspects. 
2. Develop Blog Series or Guides: Use the keyword clusters to plan out a series of blog posts or a step-by-step guide. This way, you're covering all the related topics people are searching for. 

For example, if you're writing about coffee machines, AI might group keywords like:

* ""How to choose a coffee machine""
* ""Types of coffee machines explained""
* ""Coffee machine maintenance tips""
* ""Best coffee beans for espresso machines""

You could turn this into a whole series of articles, each targeting different long-tail keywords but all related to the main topic of coffee machines.

# Conclusion: Embrace AI for Smarter Keyword Research

So, there you have it! AI is changing the game when it comes to finding those golden long-tail keywords. It's making the whole process faster, more precise, and way more creative than ever before.

By using AI tools in your keyword strategy, you're giving yourself a big advantage. You'll be able to find opportunities that others miss and create content that really speaks to what people are searching for.

But remember, AI is a tool, not a replacement for human creativity. The best results come from combining AI's power with your own knowledge and understanding of your audience.

So why not give it a try? Start experimenting with AI-powered keyword research and see how it can transform your SEO game. Your future self (and your website's traffic) will thank you!

My heart sped up. *It-...It can't be real. He's gone. He's-...he's dead.* I placed my phone back on the side table and tried to get back to sleep, hoping I was just dreaming and had heard it wrong. But then...

***BEEP-BEEP***

Another message, but my phone hadn't rung at all. Bad signal I guess. I hesitated, but then listened.

**""Ellie, Please, I need you! It's dark. It's so dark. I can't see anything. Help me, Ellie. Please-...""**

*It has to be a joke. It has to be. Someone must be playing with me somehow.*

***BEEP-BEEP***

*Not again.*

**""It feels like I can't breathe. Help me, please-...""**

I couldn't take it anymore and I threw my phone across the room.

***BEEP-BEEP***

*Oh, fuck off!!*

But, I couldn't help myself. *Was it really him?*

**""Ellie...please...I...I can't breathe...It's like I'm being suffocated...Please...I don't know what to do...Every call I make keeps cutting ou-...""**

My hands began to tremble as I deleted all the voicemails. I just couldn't handle it. It was too much. *He's dead!*

After a few cups of coffee and a lot of consideration, I finally gathered the courage to actually visit Oscar's grave. I knew it was late, but it was the only way I'd have an answer to what I had begun to suspect. And, as I stood before his makeshift gravestone, I heard it...the faint sound of his voice coming from the earth itself, desperately screaming for help. I couldn't believe it; He'd literally been calling me from the grave.

As his screams softly drifted through the mud, I stood there completely shocked.

Has anyone tried using cotton or textiles? I’d hate to put the batch at risk but my curiosity is getting the better of me.
My second thought was would i even need a nutrient boost if the coco coir is being broken down into cellulose anyway? I plan to cast in 100% coir. If so, will the mycelium grow into the casting layer and become susceptible to contamination? Or will it be too well established.. help pls  *_*",1,1733266732.0,PenisEnvyMushroom,0,1.0,False

I'm a 31(m) in a loving relationship with three kids. Here's the problem, my wife and I barely have sex anymore. My wife a few years back said it was hard to feel in the mood when she's in mom mode. Keep in mind this was before our 3rd child. She said that picking up the slack around the house helped but it was still hard for her.

I usually only get one day off a week and at night after the kids are asleep I try to do something special like a at home date night. For context our kids are 1 year, 3 years and 5 years. She still says it's to hard to get out of mom mode. I have been understanding and will drop it. We still do a date night at home of ordering food she's wanting and watching shows we both like together. But I'm starting to feel like a back seat.
