I recently bought a used Stage 4 that unfortunately was in a smoke environment and I was not made aware until I had it. It smells pretty strong and have already cleaned the outside but the smell is coming from the inside of the keybed. Is this a lost cause or should is there a way to clean inside the keybed?

Has anyone else had any experience with this, and if so, were you able to get rid of the smell?

Hi, I am Thomas! What makes me happy is when I matter to people in my life. I matter to my family and coworkers, but I want to matter to someone more than anyone else. I‚Äôve been trying to find that someone for too many years now. I know I might not ever find that someone because it‚Äôs hard to find people who would see me as being compatible with them. I got plenty of faults like being overweight, neglecting my social life, and not really being satisfied as I‚Äôd like to be with anything I do. Motivation is a struggle that all self-help books cannot solve I feel (mostly because they are usually pseudo science bs but that is beside the point). My opinion to solve this is by wanting to be someone‚Äôs special person. I crave it more than anything and have for years. I don‚Äôt know why but I just do.  I know that might sound unhealthy or unrealistic‚Ä¶I just feel like I need to matter to someone, or else, I will have lesser reasons to care. Most of what I am saying is very clich√© and desperate, but I kinda am to a degree‚Äîyah know. If someone were to be interested in me after reading all that bs, then let me tell you why I am not so bad:
	‚ó¶	I live alone and afford my rent with my own car
	‚ó¶	I have a caring family who would like to be part of your life
	‚ó¶	Enjoying the outdoors is very much a priority for me
	‚ó¶	I love collecting movies and watching them on my fancy, expensive TV (not to brag or anything)
	‚ó¶	Riding my bicycle and traveling are enjoyable to me plus I got bike rack for my car for two bicycles
	‚ó¶	Cooking is something I want to get better at and all ready have a good assortment of tools for the job in my kitchen and would like to acquire more
	‚ó¶	I enjoy tea and coffee more than most things
	‚ó¶	6 feet tall, hazel eyes, brown hair, shaved face, and I wear shorts almost all year round, unless I am at work.
If you are interested, then let me know!

The old systems groaned, a creaky old crate,

They wobbled and tumbled, sealed their own fate!


Like Jenga towers built by a tipsy old bear,

They crashed with a bang and a puff of hot air!

Oh dear, what a mess, scattered everywhere!

Now doctors scratch heads, looking terribly glum,

""Is this a real illness? Or just a tired bum?""


And schools are like puzzles, with pieces all gone,

The kids are at home, singing a silly song!

Education's a riddle, where did we go wrong?

The farmers look puzzled at fields bare and brown,

""Did I plant potatoes or turn upside down?""


Agriculture's a mystery, a comical plot

Will we eat sunshine? Or maybe... just not?

The food chain's a joke, tied up in a knot!

They tell us, ""Do not be afraid!"" with a shout,

As our comfortable routines all fizzle right out!

But my Wi-Fi is glitchy, my coffee is cold,

These small tragedies make my courage unfold... into 

panic untold!

Fear not the big stuff? Are you being bold?!


They say humanity chose this wild, crazy ride,

Perhaps we were sleeping, nowhere to hide!

Hit snooze on the alarm, pressed 'yes' by mistake,

Now the whole darned planet is starting to shake!

A cosmic 'oopsie', for goodness sake!


So let's have a giggle, a belly-aching laugh,

At this system collapse, on life's wobbly path

Stop clinging so tightly, like glue to a shoe,

A brand new beginning is waiting for you!

Let go of the old, it's the funniest thing to do!


If systems must crumble, let's watch with delight,

And maybe just fix our own little plight!

Like finally sorting that terrible drawer,

Or calling back friends we've ignored and much more!

Correcting ourselves, one small, funny chore!


So acknowledge the chaos, and maybe just start,

By cleaning your room, and opening your heart!

1ke7rp9,https://i.redd.it/4ombmwb1ynye1.jpeg,How to Properly Welcome Your Santa Muerte Statue (Including Color Meanings),"You just received or made your first Santa Muerte statue ‚Äî now what?
This guide walks you through a respectful first ceremony to welcome Santa Muerte into your home. Whether your statue is white, black, red, or rainbow, we‚Äôll also cover how different colors carry different energies and how you can reflect that in your offerings.

‚∏ª

Why a Ceremony Is Important

Santa Muerte is more than a statue ‚Äî she is a sacred spiritual presence. A simple ritual of welcome shows devotion, invites her energy properly, and begins your bond on the right foot.

‚∏ª

What You‚Äôll Need:
	‚Ä¢	Your Santa Muerte statue (any color)
	‚Ä¢	A white candle (universal and safe for first use)
	‚Ä¢	A glass of water
	‚Ä¢	Incense (copal, frankincense, or sandalwood preferred)
	‚Ä¢	Optional: Flowers, apples, candy, tobacco, coins, or tequila ‚Äî based on her color (see below)

‚∏ª

The General Ceremony Steps:

1. Cleanse the Statue
	‚Ä¢	Gently clean with water + a drop of Florida water, rose water, or salt water.
	‚Ä¢	This clears energy from shipping or handling.

2. Place Her in a Sacred Spot
	‚Ä¢	Choose a peaceful, respectful location ‚Äî not the floor or near trash.
	‚Ä¢	Many use a small table, shelf, or box as an altar.

3. Light the Candle and Incense
	‚Ä¢	Light your candle and incense.
	‚Ä¢	Say something simple like:
‚ÄúSant√≠sima Muerte, I welcome you with respect and gratitude. Please bless this home with your protection and presence.‚Äù

4. Offer Water and Symbolic Gifts
	‚Ä¢	Place a glass of water in front of her.
	‚Ä¢	Add offerings that reflect the color of your statue (see below).

5. Speak to Her
	‚Ä¢	Speak from the heart. Ask for guidance, protection, or whatever is on your mind.
	‚Ä¢	She does not demand perfection ‚Äî just sincerity and respect.

‚∏ª

Color-Specific Notes for the Ceremony:

White Santa Muerte ‚Äì Purity, protection, peace
	‚Ä¢	Great for all-purpose beginners.
	‚Ä¢	Offer: White candle, white flowers, milk, rice, sugar.

Black Santa Muerte ‚Äì Justice, protection from enemies, banishment
	‚Ä¢	For defense, shadow work, and deep respect.
	‚Ä¢	Offer: Black candle, tobacco, burned cinnamon, coffee, obsidian.

Red Santa Muerte ‚Äì Love, emotional strength, passion
	‚Ä¢	For relationships, heartbreak healing, and sexual empowerment.
	‚Ä¢	Offer: Red candle, rose petals, apples, wine, honey.

Gold/Yellow Santa Muerte ‚Äì Money, success, business blessings
	‚Ä¢	For prosperity and breaking financial cycles.
	‚Ä¢	Offer: Coins, bills, tequila, cinnamon, yellow candle.

Green Santa Muerte ‚Äì Health, legal matters, growth
	‚Ä¢	For recovery, justice, balance.
	‚Ä¢	Offer: Green candle, bay leaves, herbs, green apples.

Blue Santa Muerte ‚Äì Peace, calm, communication
	‚Ä¢	For emotional healing, public speaking, or family peace.
	‚Ä¢	Offer: Blue candle, lavender, mint, sea salt.

Purple Santa Muerte ‚Äì Transformation, intuition, spiritual growth
	‚Ä¢	For those doing deep spiritual or psychic work.
	‚Ä¢	Offer: Purple candle, amethyst, sage, violet flowers.

Brown Santa Muerte ‚Äì Stability, legal fairness, home grounding
	‚Ä¢	For justice, resolving disputes, or improving your home‚Äôs energy.
	‚Ä¢	Offer: Brown candle, bread, soil, wood carvings.

Rainbow Santa Muerte ‚Äì All-purpose blessings, balance
	‚Ä¢	Honors all aspects of her.
	‚Ä¢	Offer: Multicolored candle, sweets, rainbow roses, mixed offerings.

‚∏ª

After the Ceremony
	‚Ä¢	Let the candle burn safely or snuff it respectfully.
	‚Ä¢	Refresh her water every few days.
	‚Ä¢	You can now begin praying, leaving petitions, and building your altar.

‚∏ª

Final Words:
Don‚Äôt worry about being perfect ‚Äî Santa Muerte accepts honest devotion. Start simple. She sees your heart and walks with those who walk with faith.

* Put the ingredients in in following order: 


1. Espresso/Ice/Syrup (order doesn't matter) always this group first


2. Fill the glass up with Milk / Water


3. Topping always last



The order how you put ingredients in doesn't have to follow the recipe book. It's safest to fill up the cup with water/milk last because you don't risk not leaving enough room for the espresso (even if it looks like everything fit). However toppings like cream, flower etc should always be last because your tip gets reduced



* The happiness / patience meter does not influence your tips and if you get a refund, you messed up the order. The right order will get you a full tip even if you give it at 5% when they look angry.



* If you overbrew espresso you can still use it. While giving a burnt espresso to a customer, who just orders a shot will cause a refund, using it for orders that have multiple items or more complicated drinks like flavoured latte (milk has to be steamed perfectly), sugar rush etc. works because they will give you more room for mistakes. You get a smaller tip but no refund



* If you want to save time making lattes, you can just dip the milk to the steamer. You will only get half of the normal tip, but the time save could mean you can fit another customer

This is really long and please excuse if it doesn't make full sense, it's my first time doing this and I need some outside perspective. Get a pack of biscuits, get comfy and push your glasses up your nose for optimal reading ability. 

I'm also from the UK with a thick cockney accent, so feel free to read aloud in a loud exaggerated tone. I'm fairly loud and some (all) of this may have been typed reflecting that.  SO, CONTEXT...

My (28M) boyfriend and I (29F) have been together for two years, and we've lived together for one. In the beginning, our relationship felt perfect. I truly believed he was my person. I completely fell head over heels for him‚ÄîI supported everything he did, and it genuinely felt like I had met the one. All my family adored him, and so did my friends. A lot has happened in that time‚Äîpersonal challenges, a pregnancy, and many emotional hurdles. Through it all, I believed he was amazing and supportive.

I have been through some things in life that probably would sound made up. I wish it was. I have been forced into things against my will and I was groomed by an old boss who made me do things that left me trying to unalive myself because of how I was made to feel like I was nothing. I was mistreated by all my ex boyfriends, leading one to be physically abusive and another emotionally, so safe to say I was damaged and I carried my insecurities with me without realising.

At the beginning of our relationship, I‚Äôll admit I was toxic. I carried a lot of baggage from past relationships, which made me jealous and reactive. For example, when he once told me he was going to a comedy club with a female coworker, I lost it‚Äîespecially because we were supposed to see each other that evening. That outburst nearly ended our relationship. I recognized my behavior was unhealthy, and I started therapy to work on myself. There were other instances where my insecurities got the best of me, and we even took a short break once. I remember begging him to stay. I‚Äôm proud to say I have grown so much as a person and if it wasn‚Äôt for my boyfriend I wouldn‚Äôt have seen my flaws. He made me wake up and go to therapy to be a better person.

Later, another female coworker became close to him. They started getting coffee, and eventually talked about going on a trip together to his home country‚Äîhers as well. He never suggested a trip for just the two of us, and I felt like an afterthought. I didn‚Äôt know her, and I was worried I‚Äôd be left out, especially if they spoke in a language I didn‚Äôt understand. Another time, I woke up from a nap to find he had gone out to dinner with her without telling me. That felt like a breach of trust.

Communication has always been difficult between us. He had a rough childhood and struggles to express his emotions. While I try to be open and invite him to talk, he tends to retreat inward, especially when I‚Äôm going through something. He says he wants to protect me and doesn‚Äôt want to add to my stress, but that ends up creating distance.

Then, a few weeks ago, my friend sent me a screen recording: he was on a dating app. I was shocked. The profile had recent pictures and said he was looking for a long-term relationship. I felt humiliated and betrayed, especially because I thought we were in a great place‚Äîwe‚Äôd been talking about the future and saving for a house.

When I confronted him, I was blindsided. He admitted he redownloaded the app months ago after a big fight, thinking we might break up, and never deleted it. I searched his phone (something I‚Äôd never done before), but didn‚Äôt find anything suspicious. Still, the fact that he updated his profile and left it there hurt deeply. His explanation‚Äîthat he was feeling unsure‚Äîwasn‚Äôt enough for me. I told him clearly: if you‚Äôre in a relationship, you don‚Äôt do that.

I was devastated for a week. I didn‚Äôt tell anyone because I was trying to process it alone and didn‚Äôt want others to judge him if we ended up working through it. But the pain was overwhelming.

In a moment of insecurity, I looked up the girl he‚Äôs friends with and even asked a friend to view her profile too. It was wrong, and I admit it. I was desperate for clarity, but it backfired. He found out and said my behavior was ‚Äúunhinged‚Äù and unfair to her. While I agree it wasn‚Äôt right, I felt he was deflecting from what he had done‚Äîlike my actions were somehow worse than his betrayal.

He told me I‚Äôd gone back to my ‚Äúold ways‚Äù and said he wasn‚Äôt sure he could trust me anymore. That hurt, especially considering he‚Äôs the one who kept the dating app. Yes, my reactions haven‚Äôt always been perfect, but they were fueled by the damage his choices caused.

I know this relationship looks toxic from the outside. But we‚Äôve also had good, healing moments. I‚Äôve worked hard on myself. His actions threw us back to square one, but I believe people can grow if they‚Äôre committed. Just as he gave me another chance once, I want to offer him the same.

He agreed to go to therapy. I‚Äôm continuing with mine too, especially because I‚Äôve realized how dependent I‚Äôve become on him. We‚Äôve grown distant‚Äîwe barely do anything fun together anymore. I‚Äôm trying to change that, and I can see that he‚Äôs making an effort as well.

I also hate pulling out this card but I also have ADHD and I think he finds it hard to cope with that. My emotions are extreme and I don‚Äôt often think before I speak or act. I try to tell him that I need clarity and I can‚Äôt have him go quiet on me. It sends me over the edge and I cannot work, eat or sleep if I don‚Äôt know what is happening. I‚Äôve tried to respect that he needs space sometimes, but I also appreciate some communication of where his heads at and where I stand. I will give him space happily if I know when we will talk. It‚Äôs torture when he goes quiet and I don‚Äôt know if he will come home or if he maybe doesn‚Äôt want to be with me. The weeks break was the worst, and I often have to reach out first because the anxiety and thoughts get too much and I assume the worst. I have told him if he needs space to tell me how long for just so I am not left in the dark. I guess this is another trigger from being purposely ignored by a previous partner in order to torment me.

Still, I‚Äôm left wondering: am I being na√Øve for giving him another chance? What more can I do to rebuild trust‚Äînot just in him, but in myself? I want to grow into a more independent, confident version of myself. I want to believe that we can still grow together.

If anyone has been in a similar situation and found healing, I‚Äôd love to hear your advice. How can I support my partner in opening up emotionally, while still protecting my own heart? And how can I rebuild trust after something like this, while making sure I‚Äôm not losing myself in the process?¬†

Again I'm sorry for sounding flappy and all over the place. My friends are a godsend for listening to this in real time and my poor dad for being forced to listen to me for 30minutes on the phone and being the sassy queen I needed, putting his heels on and letting me girl-talk with him. 

Big love to you all and thanks for reading x

1ke7nz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ke7nz7/incomplete_thesis/,Incomplete thesis,"I had been sleeping poorly. For weeks, perhaps since the house became empty and human voices vanished from its hallways. But that night was different. I dreamt something I haven't been able to forget, even though I've tried with methods more rational than poetic. Something that clung to my body like a pungent smell, like a subcutaneous hum.

In the dream, I was part of a hive. I wasn't observing the bees. I was one of them. But not like a human disguised as an insect, not with fake antennae or an anthropomorphized body. I was a bee in its entirety: its sensory field, its exoskeleton, its consciousness divided between individual will and collective impulse. Everything vibrated. Everything smelled. Everything moved in patterns I understood without comprehending.

The hive wasn't a common honeycomb. It didn't hang from a branch or hide in a natural cavity. It was... organic, yes, but also in another way. The hexagons seemed to pulse, moist, as if they were breathing. They opened and closed with a cadence reminiscent of an animal's diaphragm while asleep. The walls were covered with a warm, gelatinous substance that wasn't wax or honey, but something like flesh. And the worst: the sound. A choral hum, like thousands of thoughts stitched together, but suddenly distorted, as if something or someone was trying to speak through it. They weren't words; it felt more like an intention, a presence using the hum as a mouth.

I tried to move, to fly. But the wings didn't obey. I felt a larva inside me, not literally, but as if I were incubating something, as if that hive didn't contain me but was forming me from within. Then something changed. I began to understand the pattern of the hum. As if the pheromones crossing the air were also syntax, the language of the swarm. And what they said, what they repeated over and over, was a question directed toward a specific cell of the hive that didn't seem made to contain honey or a larva. It was a different cell, covered with black wax, as if it were charred. The other bees avoided it, but I didn't. I was drawn to it, as if it were mine, as if it belonged to me, I felt it was mine. I crawled over the surface of the honeycomb, and when I touched that cell, the hum ceased, and I heard a word, a single one. Not a name. Not a verb. A word that in the dream was perfectly understandable, although now only its resonance remains, like a wet silhouette on a fogged mirror.

I woke up drenched in sweat, my mouth dry, my nails dug into the palms of my hands. An invisible hum lingered behind my ears, like the echo of something that doesn't belong to the dream or wakefulness. I didn't remember that word, but everything else was fresh in my memory; I could recount it perfectly, as I am doing now. The only thing I didn't remember and still don't is that word. I shook myself a bit before getting out of bed; that had been the strangest and craziest dream I'd ever had‚Äîwell, a dream I remembered.

At that time, I was a biology student, about to finish my degree; only the graduation requirement remained. I had decided to work on a thesis instead of doing an internship. Why? I don't even know; if I had taken the other option, maybe none of what happened afterward would have occurred, and I wouldn't have ended up medicated. My thesis focused on the sensory allometry of Apis mellifera, the honey bees. Hence the reason for that dream; it's not that in the realm of Morpheus I had become an expert on bees. I was fascinated by the precision of their bodies, the way the growth of their sensory organs relates to body size. Everything could be measured. Graphed. Understood. I suppose I was attracted to precision itself.

I lived in an old university house, in a city I prefer not to name. The walls were always damp and smelled of old books. Before the 2020 pandemic, eight students lived there. Each in their room, sharing coffee, insomnia, laughter, and existential crises. But when the quarantine began, everyone returned to their homes. Everyone had a place to go back to, except me. I stayed alone... six months locked in that house, surviving on delivery food and sporadic video calls. At first, solitude was a luxury. Not having to share the kitchen, the bathroom, the laundry. Not hearing doors closing or other people's footsteps. But over time, the silence mutated. It became thick, like a substance. I spoke with my advisor once a week. Sometimes I exchanged messages with Alejandra, a friend from my program who was also writing from her city, with her parents, with other humans, unlike me. The rest was silence, hums, and the sound old things make when they think no one is listening.

There, amid routine and isolation, the boundary between the real and... the other began to blur. It all started with a file. One morning, while reviewing a fragment of the morphometric analysis of Apis mellifera worker bees, I noticed a sentence I didn't remember writing: ""Compound eyes are an architecture of surveillance. Each segment watches, records, and remembers."" I deleted it, assuming I had copied it by mistake from some neuroethology article. But the next day, there was another new sentence: ""The queen watches even when she sleeps."" I decided to change the file's password, made a copy on a USB, and another in the cloud. I started reviewing the change history; clearly, no one else had accessed the computer... I repeat, I was alone.

I simply attributed everything to fatigue, loneliness, the pandemic, and the latent stress of dying and still having to pretend normality and continue with our lives, continue working on a thesis to graduate and have opportunities in a future I didn't know if it would come.

However, things didn't adopt a tone of sanity despite being aware of the probable alteration of reality that my mind might be suffering. One day, a jar of honey appeared on the kitchen table. It had no label, and I hadn't ordered it... at least I didn't remember buying it. I wasn't a honey enthusiast; sometimes I used it to sweeten the teas I drank, but now I lived 80% thanks to coffee, so it wasn't possible that I had made that purchase. The honey had a darker color than commercial honey and a slightly metallic smell. I decided to try it; maybe it was a jar of the honey we had extracted in the lab, the one that had been gifted to the university's administrative staff and deans. Its taste was strange, like old wood; it wasn't pleasant, and I didn't know where it came from; maybe one of the guys who lived with me had forgotten it. So I threw the jar away, but... it reappeared.

I remembered wrapping the jar in paper towels and throwing it in the trash can. However, the next morning, that jar was intact on the kitchen counter again. I wrote to Alejandra to tell her what was happening to me; I had already told her about the sentences I didn't remember writing, and she, like me, attributed it to stress, but this? Alejandra, worried about my increasingly erratic messages, offered to come visit me, and I accepted with relief. She had a special permit to move around the city since she, along with other microbiologists, was working in the university's laboratories with samples from people infected with the pandemic disease, to determine if there was contagion or not. It was an offer made by our university due to the pandemic status the disease had reached worldwide. When she arrived, she hugged me as if I had been sick.

""When was the last time you went out to the garden?"" she asked me.

""A week ago,"" I replied.

But when we opened the back door, we found a completely different garden. Darker, with trees I didn't recognize. As if they had aged decades in a few months. That garden was completely neglected; even when there were more people, there were only weeds acting as yellowish grass, seedlings that wouldn't get far, and even two trees that hadn't changed much in the time I'd been living in that house, and that had been almost five years. I didn't say anything, not because what I was seeing or feeling was a lie, but because Alejandra didn't. She knew that house; we had gone many times to hang out there, to drink, to read; she had even brought her dog Haru. If she didn't notice any difference, then... what was happening to me? Damn stress.

The last night, while Alejandra slept in my room, I went down to the improvised lab I had set up in the old library. The bees were restless, as their hum was more intense and, at the same time, more harmonious. When I approached the aquarium that was supposed to be a hive, I saw that with their bodies they had formed a precise figure: an incomplete hexagon. The same one that had appeared in the thesis, in my dreams. Then something crossed my mind, that maybe there was no difference between my study, my thoughts, and the hive. In my mind, there was a certainty, a certainty that something had opened... something was using me to write. That's why random sentences, sentences I didn't remember thinking or writing, appeared in my documents, in my thesis draft; it had to be that.

The truth is, I'm not sure if that's what really happened. Maybe it was all a symptom of confinement, of loneliness. Maybe it still is. Over time, the confinement ended. Not overnight, of course, but the authorities relaxed the measures, the university reopened gradually, and some voices returned to the hallways. Alejandra returned to the city; we saw each other one afternoon, in silence, after months of out-of-sync messages and video calls with poor connection. She asked me if I was okay, and I said yes. We both knew it was a lie, but neither wanted to correct the other.

The thesis was submitted. I remember the strange weight of having it printed in my hands. ""Sensory allometry in Apis mellifera during early larval development and its possible relation to caste differentiation."" A technical, clean, neat title. Nothing in that title alluded to the vertigo I felt while writing it, nor to the paranoia that grew like mold between the folds of confinement. The defense was virtual; they congratulated me, and I remember one of the jurors used the word ""solid."" Everything was solid, firm, scientific, rational. And yet, when I hung up the call, I felt a cold shiver down my back. As if someone had been listening from another room, like that feeling of being watched.

Days later, one morning without dates or sense, I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed. I spent nearly two weeks shut in again‚Äîthis time without a pandemic, without a thesis, without excuses. It was Alejandra who found me and took me to the hospital. I was diagnosed with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder. The psychiatrist explained everything with professional calm: prolonged isolation, academic stress, sleep deprivation, possible genetic predisposition. She prescribed anxiolytics, antidepressants, and a mild hypnotic to help me sleep. Since then, that chemical combination has been with me. Some days I forget who I was before. Other days, I prefer not to remember.

I never worked with bees again. I tried a couple of times, at the beginning. I visited an apiary with a colleague, more out of politeness than genuine interest. But the buzzing... that buzzing. Not the one from real bees, but the other one‚Äîlower, more intimate, the one that doesn‚Äôt travel through the air but inside the skull. That one is still there. I gave up the experiments. I left sensory entomology. I requested a transfer. Now I teach molecular and cell biology at the same university. The students listen attentively, and some even ask why I never talk about hymenopterans (bees, wasps, ants)... since it‚Äôs the field I graduated from. I just smile and change the subject.

Sometimes‚Äînot always, but on some nights‚Äîwhen sleep evades me even with the help of the pills, the buzzing returns. Not as an actual sound. More like a presence, a mental frequency. It's there when silence is absolute, when my breathing sounds louder than it should, when the darkness feels thicker than usual. And then I remember: the living hive, the cell sealed with black wax, the buzzing that spoke, the buzzing with a mouth.

Sometimes, I think I hear that shapeless word again, the one revealed to me in dreams and forgotten upon waking. Or maybe I didn‚Äôt forget it. Maybe I‚Äôm just incubating it.",2,1746319682.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I recently bought a used Stage 4 that unfortunately was in a smoke environment and I was not made aware until I had it. It smells pretty strong and have already cleaned the outside but the smell is coming from the inside of the keybed. Is this a lost cause or should is there a way to clean inside the keybed?

Has anyone else had any experience with this, and if so, were you able to get rid of the smell?

1ke7nb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ke7nb1/incomplete_thesis/,Incomplete thesis,"I had been sleeping poorly. For weeks, perhaps since the house became empty and human voices vanished from its hallways. But that night was different. I dreamt something I haven't been able to forget, even though I've tried with methods more rational than poetic. Something that clung to my body like a pungent smell, like a subcutaneous hum.

In the dream, I was part of a hive. I wasn't observing the bees. I was one of them. But not like a human disguised as an insect, not with fake antennae or an anthropomorphized body. I was a bee in its entirety: its sensory field, its exoskeleton, its consciousness divided between individual will and collective impulse. Everything vibrated. Everything smelled. Everything moved in patterns I understood without comprehending.

The hive wasn't a common honeycomb. It didn't hang from a branch or hide in a natural cavity. It was... organic, yes, but also in another way. The hexagons seemed to pulse, moist, as if they were breathing. They opened and closed with a cadence reminiscent of an animal's diaphragm while asleep. The walls were covered with a warm, gelatinous substance that wasn't wax or honey, but something like flesh. And the worst: the sound. A choral hum, like thousands of thoughts stitched together, but suddenly distorted, as if something or someone was trying to speak through it. They weren't words; it felt more like an intention, a presence using the hum as a mouth.

I tried to move, to fly. But the wings didn't obey. I felt a larva inside me, not literally, but as if I were incubating something, as if that hive didn't contain me but was forming me from within. Then something changed. I began to understand the pattern of the hum. As if the pheromones crossing the air were also syntax, the language of the swarm. And what they said, what they repeated over and over, was a question directed toward a specific cell of the hive that didn't seem made to contain honey or a larva. It was a different cell, covered with black wax, as if it were charred. The other bees avoided it, but I didn't. I was drawn to it, as if it were mine, as if it belonged to me, I felt it was mine. I crawled over the surface of the honeycomb, and when I touched that cell, the hum ceased, and I heard a word, a single one. Not a name. Not a verb. A word that in the dream was perfectly understandable, although now only its resonance remains, like a wet silhouette on a fogged mirror.

I woke up drenched in sweat, my mouth dry, my nails dug into the palms of my hands. An invisible hum lingered behind my ears, like the echo of something that doesn't belong to the dream or wakefulness. I didn't remember that word, but everything else was fresh in my memory; I could recount it perfectly, as I am doing now. The only thing I didn't remember and still don't is that word. I shook myself a bit before getting out of bed; that had been the strangest and craziest dream I'd ever had‚Äîwell, a dream I remembered.

At that time, I was a biology student, about to finish my degree; only the graduation requirement remained. I had decided to work on a thesis instead of doing an internship. Why? I don't even know; if I had taken the other option, maybe none of what happened afterward would have occurred, and I wouldn't have ended up medicated. My thesis focused on the sensory allometry of Apis mellifera, the honey bees. Hence the reason for that dream; it's not that in the realm of Morpheus I had become an expert on bees. I was fascinated by the precision of their bodies, the way the growth of their sensory organs relates to body size. Everything could be measured. Graphed. Understood. I suppose I was attracted to precision itself.

I lived in an old university house, in a city I prefer not to name. The walls were always damp and smelled of old books. Before the 2020 pandemic, eight students lived there. Each in their room, sharing coffee, insomnia, laughter, and existential crises. But when the quarantine began, everyone returned to their homes. Everyone had a place to go back to, except me. I stayed alone... six months locked in that house, surviving on delivery food and sporadic video calls. At first, solitude was a luxury. Not having to share the kitchen, the bathroom, the laundry. Not hearing doors closing or other people's footsteps. But over time, the silence mutated. It became thick, like a substance. I spoke with my advisor once a week. Sometimes I exchanged messages with Alejandra, a friend from my program who was also writing from her city, with her parents, with other humans, unlike me. The rest was silence, hums, and the sound old things make when they think no one is listening.

There, amid routine and isolation, the boundary between the real and... the other began to blur. It all started with a file. One morning, while reviewing a fragment of the morphometric analysis of Apis mellifera worker bees, I noticed a sentence I didn't remember writing: ""Compound eyes are an architecture of surveillance. Each segment watches, records, and remembers."" I deleted it, assuming I had copied it by mistake from some neuroethology article. But the next day, there was another new sentence: ""The queen watches even when she sleeps."" I decided to change the file's password, made a copy on a USB, and another in the cloud. I started reviewing the change history; clearly, no one else had accessed the computer... I repeat, I was alone.

I simply attributed everything to fatigue, loneliness, the pandemic, and the latent stress of dying and still having to pretend normality and continue with our lives, continue working on a thesis to graduate and have opportunities in a future I didn't know if it would come.

However, things didn't adopt a tone of sanity despite being aware of the probable alteration of reality that my mind might be suffering. One day, a jar of honey appeared on the kitchen table. It had no label, and I hadn't ordered it... at least I didn't remember buying it. I wasn't a honey enthusiast; sometimes I used it to sweeten the teas I drank, but now I lived 80% thanks to coffee, so it wasn't possible that I had made that purchase. The honey had a darker color than commercial honey and a slightly metallic smell. I decided to try it; maybe it was a jar of the honey we had extracted in the lab, the one that had been gifted to the university's administrative staff and deans. Its taste was strange, like old wood; it wasn't pleasant, and I didn't know where it came from; maybe one of the guys who lived with me had forgotten it. So I threw the jar away, but... it reappeared.

I remembered wrapping the jar in paper towels and throwing it in the trash can. However, the next morning, that jar was intact on the kitchen counter again. I wrote to Alejandra to tell her what was happening to me; I had already told her about the sentences I didn't remember writing, and she, like me, attributed it to stress, but this? Alejandra, worried about my increasingly erratic messages, offered to come visit me, and I accepted with relief. She had a special permit to move around the city since she, along with other microbiologists, was working in the university's laboratories with samples from people infected with the pandemic disease, to determine if there was contagion or not. It was an offer made by our university due to the pandemic status the disease had reached worldwide. When she arrived, she hugged me as if I had been sick.

""When was the last time you went out to the garden?"" she asked me.

""A week ago,"" I replied.

But when we opened the back door, we found a completely different garden. Darker, with trees I didn't recognize. As if they had aged decades in a few months. That garden was completely neglected; even when there were more people, there were only weeds acting as yellowish grass, seedlings that wouldn't get far, and even two trees that hadn't changed much in the time I'd been living in that house, and that had been almost five years. I didn't say anything, not because what I was seeing or feeling was a lie, but because Alejandra didn't. She knew that house; we had gone many times to hang out there, to drink, to read; she had even brought her dog Haru. If she didn't notice any difference, then... what was happening to me? Damn stress.

The last night, while Alejandra slept in my room, I went down to the improvised lab I had set up in the old library. The bees were restless, as their hum was more intense and, at the same time, more harmonious. When I approached the aquarium that was supposed to be a hive, I saw that with their bodies they had formed a precise figure: an incomplete hexagon. The same one that had appeared in the thesis, in my dreams. Then something crossed my mind, that maybe there was no difference between my study, my thoughts, and the hive. In my mind, there was a certainty, a certainty that something had opened... something was using me to write. That's why random sentences, sentences I didn't remember thinking or writing, appeared in my documents, in my thesis draft; it had to be that.

The truth is, I'm not sure if that's what really happened. Maybe it was all a symptom of confinement, of loneliness. Maybe it still is. Over time, the confinement ended. Not overnight, of course, but the authorities relaxed the measures, the university reopened gradually, and some voices returned to the hallways. Alejandra returned to the city; we saw each other one afternoon, in silence, after months of out-of-sync messages and video calls with poor connection. She asked me if I was okay, and I said yes. We both knew it was a lie, but neither wanted to correct the other.

The thesis was submitted. I remember the strange weight of having it printed in my hands. ""Sensory allometry in Apis mellifera during early larval development and its possible relation to caste differentiation."" A technical, clean, neat title. Nothing in that title alluded to the vertigo I felt while writing it, nor to the paranoia that grew like mold between the folds of confinement. The defense was virtual; they congratulated me, and I remember one of the jurors used the word ""solid."" Everything was solid, firm, scientific, rational. And yet, when I hung up the call, I felt a cold shiver down my back. As if someone had been listening from another room, like that feeling of being watched.

Days later, one morning without dates or sense, I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed. I spent nearly two weeks shut in again‚Äîthis time without a pandemic, without a thesis, without excuses.

1ke7n0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepyPastas/comments/1ke7n0s/incomplete_thesis/,Incomplete thesis,"I had been sleeping poorly. For weeks, perhaps since the house became empty and human voices vanished from its hallways. But that night was different. I dreamt something I haven't been able to forget, even though I've tried with methods more rational than poetic. Something that clung to my body like a pungent smell, like a subcutaneous hum.

In the dream, I was part of a hive. I wasn't observing the bees. I was one of them. But not like a human disguised as an insect, not with fake antennae or an anthropomorphized body. I was a bee in its entirety: its sensory field, its exoskeleton, its consciousness divided between individual will and collective impulse. Everything vibrated. Everything smelled. Everything moved in patterns I understood without comprehending.

The hive wasn't a common honeycomb. It didn't hang from a branch or hide in a natural cavity. It was... organic, yes, but also in another way. The hexagons seemed to pulse, moist, as if they were breathing. They opened and closed with a cadence reminiscent of an animal's diaphragm while asleep. The walls were covered with a warm, gelatinous substance that wasn't wax or honey, but something like flesh. And the worst: the sound. A choral hum, like thousands of thoughts stitched together, but suddenly distorted, as if something or someone was trying to speak through it. They weren't words; it felt more like an intention, a presence using the hum as a mouth.

I tried to move, to fly. But the wings didn't obey. I felt a larva inside me, not literally, but as if I were incubating something, as if that hive didn't contain me but was forming me from within. Then something changed. I began to understand the pattern of the hum. As if the pheromones crossing the air were also syntax, the language of the swarm. And what they said, what they repeated over and over, was a question directed toward a specific cell of the hive that didn't seem made to contain honey or a larva. It was a different cell, covered with black wax, as if it were charred. The other bees avoided it, but I didn't. I was drawn to it, as if it were mine, as if it belonged to me, I felt it was mine. I crawled over the surface of the honeycomb, and when I touched that cell, the hum ceased, and I heard a word, a single one. Not a name. Not a verb. A word that in the dream was perfectly understandable, although now only its resonance remains, like a wet silhouette on a fogged mirror.

I woke up drenched in sweat, my mouth dry, my nails dug into the palms of my hands. An invisible hum lingered behind my ears, like the echo of something that doesn't belong to the dream or wakefulness. I didn't remember that word, but everything else was fresh in my memory; I could recount it perfectly, as I am doing now. The only thing I didn't remember and still don't is that word. I shook myself a bit before getting out of bed; that had been the strangest and craziest dream I'd ever had‚Äîwell, a dream I remembered.

At that time, I was a biology student, about to finish my degree; only the graduation requirement remained. I had decided to work on a thesis instead of doing an internship. Why? I don't even know; if I had taken the other option, maybe none of what happened afterward would have occurred, and I wouldn't have ended up medicated. My thesis focused on the sensory allometry of Apis mellifera, the honey bees. Hence the reason for that dream; it's not that in the realm of Morpheus I had become an expert on bees. I was fascinated by the precision of their bodies, the way the growth of their sensory organs relates to body size. Everything could be measured. Graphed. Understood. I suppose I was attracted to precision itself.

I lived in an old university house, in a city I prefer not to name. The walls were always damp and smelled of old books. Before the 2020 pandemic, eight students lived there. Each in their room, sharing coffee, insomnia, laughter, and existential crises. But when the quarantine began, everyone returned to their homes. Everyone had a place to go back to, except me. I stayed alone... six months locked in that house, surviving on delivery food and sporadic video calls. At first, solitude was a luxury. Not having to share the kitchen, the bathroom, the laundry. Not hearing doors closing or other people's footsteps. But over time, the silence mutated. It became thick, like a substance. I spoke with my advisor once a week. Sometimes I exchanged messages with Alejandra, a friend from my program who was also writing from her city, with her parents, with other humans, unlike me. The rest was silence, hums, and the sound old things make when they think no one is listening.

There, amid routine and isolation, the boundary between the real and... the other began to blur. It all started with a file. One morning, while reviewing a fragment of the morphometric analysis of Apis mellifera worker bees, I noticed a sentence I didn't remember writing: ""Compound eyes are an architecture of surveillance. Each segment watches, records, and remembers."" I deleted it, assuming I had copied it by mistake from some neuroethology article. But the next day, there was another new sentence: ""The queen watches even when she sleeps."" I decided to change the file's password, made a copy on a USB, and another in the cloud. I started reviewing the change history; clearly, no one else had accessed the computer... I repeat, I was alone.

I simply attributed everything to fatigue, loneliness, the pandemic, and the latent stress of dying and still having to pretend normality and continue with our lives, continue working on a thesis to graduate and have opportunities in a future I didn't know if it would come.

However, things didn't adopt a tone of sanity despite being aware of the probable alteration of reality that my mind might be suffering. One day, a jar of honey appeared on the kitchen table. It had no label, and I hadn't ordered it... at least I didn't remember buying it. I wasn't a honey enthusiast; sometimes I used it to sweeten the teas I drank, but now I lived 80% thanks to coffee, so it wasn't possible that I had made that purchase. The honey had a darker color than commercial honey and a slightly metallic smell. I decided to try it; maybe it was a jar of the honey we had extracted in the lab, the one that had been gifted to the university's administrative staff and deans. Its taste was strange, like old wood; it wasn't pleasant, and I didn't know where it came from; maybe one of the guys who lived with me had forgotten it. So I threw the jar away, but... it reappeared.

I remembered wrapping the jar in paper towels and throwing it in the trash can. However, the next morning, that jar was intact on the kitchen counter again. I wrote to Alejandra to tell her what was happening to me; I had already told her about the sentences I didn't remember writing, and she, like me, attributed it to stress, but this? Alejandra, worried about my increasingly erratic messages, offered to come visit me, and I accepted with relief. She had a special permit to move around the city since she, along with other microbiologists, was working in the university's laboratories with samples from people infected with the pandemic disease, to determine if there was contagion or not. It was an offer made by our university due to the pandemic status the disease had reached worldwide. When she arrived, she hugged me as if I had been sick.

""When was the last time you went out to the garden?"" she asked me.

""A week ago,"" I replied.

But when we opened the back door, we found a completely different garden. Darker, with trees I didn't recognize. As if they had aged decades in a few months. That garden was completely neglected; even when there were more people, there were only weeds acting as yellowish grass, seedlings that wouldn't get far, and even two trees that hadn't changed much in the time I'd been living in that house, and that had been almost five years. I didn't say anything, not because what I was seeing or feeling was a lie, but because Alejandra didn't. She knew that house; we had gone many times to hang out there, to drink, to read; she had even brought her dog Haru. If she didn't notice any difference, then... what was happening to me? Damn stress.

The last night, while Alejandra slept in my room, I went down to the improvised lab I had set up in the old library. The bees were restless, as their hum was more intense and, at the same time, more harmonious. When I approached the aquarium that was supposed to be a hive, I saw that with their bodies they had formed a precise figure: an incomplete hexagon. The same one that had appeared in the thesis, in my dreams. Then something crossed my mind, that maybe there was no difference between my study, my thoughts, and the hive. In my mind, there was a certainty, a certainty that something had opened... something was using me to write. That's why random sentences, sentences I didn't remember thinking or writing, appeared in my documents, in my thesis draft; it had to be that.

The truth is, I'm not sure if that's what really happened. Maybe it was all a symptom of confinement, of loneliness. Maybe it still is. Over time, the confinement ended. Not overnight, of course, but the authorities relaxed the measures, the university reopened gradually, and some voices returned to the hallways. Alejandra returned to the city; we saw each other one afternoon, in silence, after months of out-of-sync messages and video calls with poor connection. She asked me if I was okay, and I said yes. We both knew it was a lie, but neither wanted to correct the other.

The thesis was submitted. I remember the strange weight of having it printed in my hands. ""Sensory allometry in Apis mellifera during early larval development and its possible relation to caste differentiation."" A technical, clean, neat title. Nothing in that title alluded to the vertigo I felt while writing it, nor to the paranoia that grew like mold between the folds of confinement. The defense was virtual; they congratulated me, and I remember one of the jurors used the word ""solid."" Everything was solid, firm, scientific, rational. And yet, when I hung up the call, I felt a cold shiver down my back. As if someone had been listening from another room, like that feeling of being watched.

Days later, one morning without dates or sense, I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed. I spent nearly two weeks shut in again‚Äîthis time without a pandemic, without a thesis, without excuses.

Where do I go, and what the hell do I order to give the locations a fighting chance of not tasting like dirty mop water?

I want to stay away from a traditional Americano cause that seems pretty basic, so any other suggestions would be great.  I'm going into this with a super open mind.

I also truly don't care about travel times around LA and the surrounding areas or cost.  If the best cup of coffee is in Yorba Linda and it's $27 then I'm in there.  Bonus points if the place is cool in some way to make the video look good.  thanks!",0,1746319404.0,FoodLosAngeles,21,0.21,False

We've been through a lot together, and I've always thought of her as someone I could truly rely on. But lately, I‚Äôve been feeling really hurt and let down by her.

My grandmother, who I live with and care for full-time, has been diagnosed with cancer. It‚Äôs been an incredibly difficult and emotional time for me. She‚Äôs been hospitalized multiple times, sometimes for long periods, and right now she‚Äôs in the hospital again. As her primary carer, I‚Äôm the one juggling everything such as her appointments, hospital visits, emotional support alongside my career while trying to hold myself together.

Each time she‚Äôs been admitted, I‚Äôve let my best friend know what‚Äôs going on. She lives very close to both me and the hospital only a few minutes away. Despite that, she‚Äôs never once offered to come over, help in any way, or even just visit my grandmother at the hospital. She hasn‚Äôt checked in with me beyond the occasional text, and even those feel a bit detached or obligatory.

What really stings is that despite everything I‚Äôve been juggling, when I found out that another friend‚Äôs mother was in the hospital, I immediately made time to bring them dinner and visit. I didn‚Äôt think twice I just wanted to make things a little easier for them during a tough time. So I guess it hurts even more that someone I consider my best friend hasn‚Äôt made a single effort.

I‚Äôm not expecting her to drop everything and be at my side 24/7. I know people have their own lives and stresses. But a small gesture even something like offering to bring me a coffee, coming by to sit and talk, or just asking how I‚Äôm really doing would go such a long way. I‚Äôve always tried to be there for her in the past when she was going through tough times, so this silence is hard to ignore.

I keep wondering if I‚Äôm expecting too much from her. Is it unreasonable to want that kind of support from a best friend when you‚Äôre going through something this heavy? Or is it fair to feel disappointed and even a bit abandoned?

I recently bought a used Stage 4 that unfortunately was in a smoke environment and I was not made aware until I had it. It smells pretty strong and have already cleaned the outside but the smell is coming from the inside of the keybed. Is this a lost cause or should is there a way to clean inside the keybed? 

Has anyone else had any experience with this, and if so, were you able to get rid of the smell?

1ke7f2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1ke7f2e/theres_a_woman_who_lives_inside_the_walls_of_my/,"There's a woman who lives inside the walls of my gallery. For fifteen years, she's been knocking against the marble, attempting to deliver a message I couldn't decipher - until last night. Now, I understand.","I‚Äôve always felt profoundly relieved to put that burning city behind me. Move past the death and destruction. Divide myself from the ash and the ruins, the rust-colored clouds and the blood-orange sky. Out of sight, out of mind.

Towering steel doors swung shut as I stepped into the gallery.

I sighed, allowing my shoulders to sag as I slowly twisted my neck. Left to right, right to left. The A/C hummed, and its crisp, mechanical breath crawled over my exposed skin. My body cooled. The muscles in my neck began to unwind.

This was my sanctuary. The last building standing. A great marble raft drifting above an ocean of rubble.

I couldn‚Äôt let myself completely relax, though.

Yes, the gallery was safer than the inferno outside its walls. Much safer. But it came with its own risks.

Because it wasn‚Äôt just¬†*my*¬†sanctuary: I shared the refuge with one other person. Unlike me, she never seemed to leave. She usually wasn‚Äôt visible when I entered, but she was always there.

If I couldn‚Äôt see her, that meant she was in the walls. If she was in the walls, she'd be knocking her forehead against the marble. She didn‚Äôt have any knuckles, so the woman made her skull an instrument.

Same pattern every time, measured and deliberate.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

The knocks were gentle, but the sound carried generously through the cavernous studio floor. It was a single box-shaped room with thirty-foot tall ceilings and not a lot in between. Each wall held a few paintings from artists of no renown. There was a spiral staircase in the center, but the sixty-eight metal steps led to nowhere, abruptly stopping two-thirds of the way up.

And most cryptically, there was the elevator. Directly across from the entrance. No buttons to call the damn thing. The outline of a down arrow above the doors I‚Äôd never seen flash. No one ever came out, and I knew no one ever would, either.

The elevator was a one-way trip, constructed for me alone. Wasn‚Äôt ever sure how I knew that, but I‚Äôd bet my life on its truth twenty times over.

So, there I‚Äôd be: by myself on the gallery floor, that snake of a woman slithering through its walls, surrounded by an empty, burning city for miles in every direction. It would always start with me approaching the massive steel doors, waves of heat galloping over my back, but when it would end was variable. It could take minutes, it could take hours. On rare occasions, it could take days or weeks.

Eventually, though, I‚Äôd wake up.

The same inscrutable dream, every night without fail, for over fifteen years. A transmission from the depths of a hollow reality that I never understood until last night.

***My Birth:***

Ever since I can remember, I‚Äôve felt out of place. An outsider among my own species. I‚Äôm sure a lot of people experience a similar pariah-hood, and I obviously can‚Äôt confirm my lived experience is distinct or extraordinary in comparison.

Let me provide an example - some objective proof of my otherness.

As soon as I drew a first breath, my mother‚Äôs heart stopped. Spontaneous cardiac arrest, no rhyme or reason. An unceremonious end, like the death of an old car battery. The medical team leapt into action. A few does of IV adrenaline later, the muscle wearily returned to duty.

But the moment her heart restarted, mine then stopped. Then they‚Äôd resuscitate me, only to have my mother die again. So on and so on.

The way my dad used to tell it, the doctors became incrementally more unnerved and bewildered each time we flipped. Life was a zero-sum game in that operating room: it was me or her, decreed God, or the reaper, or whatever unknowable divinity would be in charge of such a cosmic oddity. The uncanny tug-of-war would have probably been amusing to witness if the implications weren‚Äôt so deeply tragic.

Three or four cycles later, my mother‚Äôs heart gave out completely. Obstinately refused to beat, no matter what the medical team did. Dad would sometimes theorize that was an active decision made by the doctors that handled her care, even if they didn‚Äôt have ‚Äúthe balls‚Äù to admit it.

Like once they realized that one of us was dying, they arbitrarily awarded me with life. Started covertly injecting saline into my mother‚Äôs veins instead of adrenaline or something.

I doubt that last part actually happened. The circumstances were just viciously unfair, and that type of thing is fertile soil for growing conspiracy. Regardless, I felt his pain.

See, that‚Äôs the rub. Although I‚Äôve always felt like an outsider, that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôve lacked empathy. I have reverence for the people around me. I‚Äôve just never felt¬†*connected*¬†to any of them. I‚Äôm like a naturalist living alone in the jungle. I love the flora and the fauna. I respect the miracle that nature represents. But at the end of the day, I‚Äôm still alone.

Which brings me to Anthony.

\- - - - -

***My Childhood:***

I experienced a fair amount of bullying as a kid, probably became a target on account of my quiet nature and my social isolation. A lone gazelle straying too far from the safety of the herd. They didn‚Äôt much bother me, though. I just couldn‚Äôt see them as predators: more like flies buzzing around my head. Noisy and a smidge irritating, but ultimately harmless.

That was the problem - they¬†*wanted*¬†to feel like predators, and I wasn't providing the sensation. Inciting fear and misery made them feel in control. So, when they couldn‚Äôt get a rise out of me with their routine arsenal of schoolyard mockery, things escalated.

And every time a new prank was enacted - a carton of milk spilled over my head, a few spiders dumped into my backpack, etc. - I would notice Anthony watching from the sidelines, livid on my behalf. Tall for his age, frizzy black hair, blue eyes boiling over with anger behind a pair of thick square glasses.

One afternoon, Austin, a dumber and more violent breed of bully, became fed up with my relative disinterest. Decided to take the torment up a notch. He snuck up behind me while I was eating lunch, stuck a meaty fist into my bun, and yanked a thick chunk of hair from my scalp.

That was certainly my line in the sand. It was Anthony‚Äôs too, apparently.

I spun around. Before he could even gloat, I lunged forward, opened my jaw, and bit down hard on his nearest elbow. At the same time, Anthony had been running up behind him with a metal lunch tray arched over his shoulder. The shiny rectangle connected to Austin‚Äôs temple with a loud clatter, almost like the ringing of a gong.

It was a real ‚Äúone-two‚Äù punch.

An hour later, Anthony and I had our first conversation outside the principal‚Äôs office, both waiting to be interrogated.

I‚Äôve never been quite comfortable with the way he looked at me, even back then. His grin was too wide, his focus too intense. On the surface, it was an affectionate expression. But there was something dark looming behind it all: a possessiveness. A smoldering infatuation that bordered on obsession.

I tried to ignore it, because I genuinely did like him. As a friend. He was the only one I felt comfortable confiding in. The only person who knew of the gallery and the burning city, other than myself.

Now, there‚Äôs no one else.

This post is designed to fix that.

\- - - - -

***The Gallery:***

‚Äú*Ide conquers the Tarandos‚Äù*¬†was my favorite. (The first word is pronounced¬†*e-day*, I think.)

It wasn‚Äôt the largest painting in the gallery, nor was it the most technically impressive. There was just something bewitching about the piece, though. I found myself hopelessly magnetized to it for hours every night.

One foot long, about half a foot tall, with a frame composed of small, alternating suns and moons carved into the wood. It depicted a single-armed Valkyrie, with white wings and dull gray armor, lying on her back under the shade of a willow tree. A creature with the body of a man and the head of a stag is descending on her. Its face is contorted into a vicious snarl, arms outstretched with violent intent. The beast seems unaware of the serrated dagger in the Valkyrie‚Äôs singular hand, tenting the skin on the right side of its neck, about to draw blood.

Oil paint lended the scene a striking vibrancy. The grass appeared lush, almost palpable. The hair on the beast‚Äôs knuckles looked matted and dense, like it was overflowing with grease.

Studying that canvas made me feel alive. More than I‚Äôve ever felt in the waking world, honestly. However, that invigoration would fade into unease the moment my eyes landed on the two black holes above the Valkyrie‚Äôs head.

Because they weren't some bizarre artistic choice.

They were holes - literally.

Every painting in the gallery had a pair of them.

She liked to watch me look at the paintings every so often.

When she did, two bloodshot eyes would intensely monitor my gaze.

Sometimes, she'd watch for so long without blinking that tears would drip down the length of the piece.

Eventually, the frame would tremble with her message.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

***My Adolescence:***

*‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the holdup, then? Just do it already,‚Äù*¬†seventeen-year-old me proclaimed, unafraid and defiant.

The man in the ski-mask tilted his head. His glare dissipated. I stepped closer. The employee behind the counter stopped pulling bills from the register, eyes wide with disbelief.

*‚ÄúQuinn! What the fuck are you doing?‚Äù*¬†Anthony hissed, cowering behind a nearby rack of chips.

I sniffed the air. Ran my fingers along the countertop while licking my lips. Surveyed my surroundings by turning my head and perked my ears for unusual sounds.

Smell, touch, taste, sight, hearing: I re-sampled them all. Everything was as it should be.

I felt my confidence balloon further.

*‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it, bitch‚Ä¶I‚Äôll s-shoot. I ain‚Äôt afraid. I‚Äôll s-splatter your guts across the fucking floor‚Ä¶‚Äù*¬†the would-be criminal stuttered.

I stepped even closer. Close enough that the barrel of his pistol began digging into my chest.

*‚ÄúYeah, I heard you the first time, man.‚Äù*

I smiled, baring my teeth.

*‚ÄúSo, do it then. Look. I‚Äôm making it easy for you. Don‚Äôt even have to aim.‚Äù*

Like the flick of a switch, his demeanor changed. The gunman‚Äôs bravado collapsed in on itself, falling apart like paper mache in the rain.

Without saying another word, he sprinted from that CVS and disappeared into the night.

I flipped around so I could face Anthony, closed my eyes, and took an exaggerated bow. He wasn‚Äôt applauding. Neither was the flabbergasted kid behind the cash register, for that matter.

But I sure as shit pretended they were.

I was damn proud of my little parlor trick. Later that night, though, I‚Äôd ruin the magic. Anthony was insistent. Just wouldn‚Äôt let it go.

He wore me down.

So, I told him that didn‚Äôt experience any synesthesia. That meant we were safe. No one in that convenience store was going to die. My performance was just a logical extrapolation of that arcane knowledge.

No one was going to die relatively soon, anyway.

\- - - - -

My first dream of the burning city and the gallery came the night of my eleventh birthday. My ability to sense approaching death came soon after.

Synesthesia, for those of you unaware, is a neurological condition where the stimulation of one sense becomes involuntarily translated into the language of another sense.

But that probably sounds like a bunch of medical blather, so let me provide you with a few examples:

*The man tasted loud.*

*The apple felt bright.*

*The musical note sounded purple.*

You get the idea. It‚Äôs like nerves getting their wires crossed.

For a whole year before his death, my grandfather looked salty. His apartment smelled quiet. His voice sounded circular. And all of those queer sensations only became more intense as his expiration date approached.

I eventually picked up on the pattern.

Once I grasped the bounds of my extrasensory insight, death lost its hold over me. You see, death draws a lot of its power from anticipation. People don‚Äôt like surprises, especially shitty ones. Nobody wants to be startled by the proverbial monster under the bed. I, however, had become liberated.

I could feel death‚Äôs advance from miles away, therefore, I had nothing to fear. Nothing at all.

At least, that‚Äôs what I¬†*used*¬†to believe when I was young and dumb. Unfortunately, there are two major flaws in my supposed invulnerability that I completely swept under the rug. You may shouting them at your computer screen already.

1. Just because I could sense death didn‚Äôt mean I was shielded from the tragedies of life.
2. I didn‚Äôt know for certain that I could sense¬†*everyone‚Äôs*¬†death. There‚Äôs one person in particular who would be unverifiable by definition.

How could I be sure that I was capable of sensing my own death coming, if I had never died before?

\- - - - -

***The Gallery:***

The night of my twelfth birthday, she finally revealed herself.

She finally came out.

There was a crack aside the elevator, no larger than the size of a volleyball. It was impossible to see what laid beyond that crack. Its darkness was impenetrable.

The woman wriggled out of that darkness and slithered towards me.

She had somehow been reduced to just a head with a spinal cord lagging behind it, acting as her tail.

Her movements were distinctly reptilian, rows of vertebrae swinging side to side, creating U-shaped waves of rattling bones as she glided across the marble floor.

I couldn‚Äôt see her face until she was only a few feet away. Long, unkempt strands of gray hair obscured her features, wreathing them behind a layer of silver filaments like the blinds on a window.

There was a crater at the center of her forehead. A quarter-sized circle of her skull had been completely pulverized from the incessant knocking.

She twirled around my leg, spiraling up my torso until she was high enough to drape her spinal cord over my shoulders.

Then, we were face to face, and she spoke the only eight words I‚Äôve ever heard spill from her withered lips until last night.

*""Are*

*You Ready*

*To See What Is*

*Below?""*

I shook my head. She looked disappointed.

Then, I woke up.

Three hundred and sixty-five days later, she‚Äôd wriggle out from the crack again to ask me the same question.

Year, after year, after year.

\- - - - -

***My Early Twenties***

In order for you to understand what transpired over the last twenty-four hours, I need to explain me and Anthony‚Äôs falling out.

The summer before I went away to college, he arrived at my doorstep and professed that he was in love with me. Had been for a long time, apparently.

His speech laid out all the gory details: how he believed we were soul mates, how perfect our children were going to be, how honored he was to get to die by my side.

Note the language. It wasn‚Äôt that he believed we¬†*could*¬†be soul mates, or that our children¬†*could*¬†be perfect. No, that phrasing was much too indefinite. From his perspective, our future was already sealed: written in the stars whether I liked it or not.

I tried to ease him back to reality gently. Reiterated the same talking points I‚Äôd harped on since he hit puberty.

Romantic love wasn‚Äôt in the cards for me. I was incapable of experiencing that level of connection with anyone. It had nothing to do with the value of him as a person or as a potential mate. My rejection wasn‚Äôt a judgement.

He wouldn‚Äôt hear it. Instead, he accused me of being a ‚Äústuck-up bitch‚Äù through bouts of rage-tinted sobs. I was going to college and he was staying in our hometown to take a job at his father‚Äôs factory. That must be it, he realized out loud. I didn't feel like he was good enough for me. He lacked prestige.

I think I responded to those accusations with something along the lines of:

*‚ÄúListen, Anthony, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm better than you. It‚Äôs not like that at all. We‚Äôre just different. Fundamentally different. I‚Äôm sorry, but that‚Äôs never going to change, either. Not for you and not for anyone else.‚Äù*

In retrospect, maybe I could have selected cleaner verbiage. In the heat of the moment, I don‚Äôt think he took the words as I intended.

From there, Anthony hurled a chair through my house‚Äôs living room window, stomped out the front door, and exited my life for a little over five years.

\- - - - -

***Current Day***

Fast forward to last week.

I returned to my hometown from my apartment in the city due to the death of my father, something I‚Äôd began feeling inklings of two years ahead of time. After the funeral, I‚Äôve focused on getting his estate in order, only venturing down onto main street once in the seven days I‚Äôve been here. The coffee machine broke, and I was in dire straits.

And who do I just so happen to run in to?

Anthony.

Honestly, I barely recognized him. He was no longer sporting a lanky frame, frizzy black hair, and thick bottlecap glasses. His body was muscular, almost Herculean. He slicked his hair back, varnishing it with some hideously pungent over-the-counter male beauty product. He no longer wore glasses now that he was able to afford a LASIK procedure - cured his shortsightedness for good.

I couldn‚Äôt detect the same darkness behind his eyes anymore, but that wasn‚Äôt because something purged it from his system.

He‚Äôd just gotten more proficient at hiding it.

\- - - - -

Last night, we went out for dinner and a drink. Platonically. I made that exceptionally transparent from the get-go. He teased me in response, inquiring whether my boyfriend in the city would come ‚Äúkick the shit out of him‚Äù if he heard I was out with an ‚Äúold flame‚Äù.

For what felt like the millionth time, I explained to Anthony that I wasn‚Äôt interested in that type of connection. Thus, I was single.

That made him smile.

Inevitably, he invited me back to his apartment. He was very proud of his lucrative new position in his company and the luxuries that came with it, and he wanted to show off.

I almost reminded him that it wasn‚Äôt¬†*his*¬†company. It was his father‚Äôs company. To avoid conflict, I held my tongue.

It might sound insane that I agreed to his invitation. Like I said, he concealed his darkness well. Anthony may have grown up to be a bit of a tool, but he was still the only person I ever felt close with. I was genuinely interested in seeing how his life had turned out.

I wasn‚Äôt experiencing¬†*any*¬†synesthesia around him, either. To me, that indicated relative safety: no one was going to die. If he tried something lecherous, an act of depravity that may not necessarily inflict death, well, that‚Äôs what pepper spray is for.

Anthony lived in a two-story brick row home on the outskirts of town. I walked in the door and was greeted by a tiny entrance nook followed by an extensive set of stairs, which led up to his ostentatious foyer-slash-entertainment room.

I won‚Äôt lie - it was impressive. That was the point, I think. His home was just a big, glossy distraction: something to keep your attention away from the bedeviled man who lurked within. Barely even noticed him tapping on some home security dashboard to the right of the front door.

I do remember hearing the heavy click of a motorized lock, though.

At that point, I was already walking up the stairs.

\- - - - -

For the next hour, we sat across from each on a massive leather sectional in his foyer, chitchatting over an additional glass of wine.

Eventually, though, enough was enough.

I think he sensed I was preparing to excuse myself and go home, because he leaned over, grabbed one of five stout candles off of the coffee table, and began lighting the wick with a box of matches he pulled from his blazer pocket.

I told Anthony it was getting late, and that it was time for me to leave. He didn‚Äôt say anything. He didn‚Äôt react to the sentence at all. He just kept silently lighting the candles.

When I witnessed the reflection of the burning wick in his eyes, I realized I had made a mistake.

*Fine,*¬†I thought.¬†*I don‚Äôt need his permission to leave.*

He didn‚Äôt say anything as I darted past him, jogging down the stairs. I pulled the knob to the front door.

It didn‚Äôt budge. There wasn't any obvious way to unlock it, either.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶Anthony? Can you kindly help me unlock the front door?‚Äù*¬†I called up, experiencing terror for the first time in years: a voracious chill eating its way through my chest

Nothing. No response. Not a peep.

Instead, the lights clicked off.

I felt a lump grow in the back of my throat.

Sweat poured over my temples.

I perked my ears. No footfalls. No sound.

No synesthesias.

Just darkness oozing down that silent corridor: a lurching tidal wave of black tar moments away from swallowing me whole.

I reached into my purse for my cellphone.

Then - furious movement down the stairs.

The sound of heavy boots stomping on hardwood filled my ears. Before I could react, he was looming over me. An open hand exploded out from the shadows and hooked onto my blouse collar. With one forceful pull, he yanked me to the ground. The bridge of my nose crashed into the edge of a stair as I fell. Electric pain writhed and crackled over my sinuses. My mouth felt hot and boggy as he lugged back up to the foyer.

Anthony quickly pinned me to the floor in front of the coffee table. I thrashed and struggled, but it wasn‚Äôt much use. He had positioned one muscular knee on each of my elbows. I was trapped.

Without uttering a word, he wrapped his meaty claws around my neck and squeezed.

The veins in his head pulsed, his face swollen with fury. I started to see double.

Consciousness liquefied and slipped through my fingertips.

I closed my eyes.

With the last few grains of life I had left, I thought of my favorite painting.

‚Äú*Ide conquers the Tarandos‚Äù*

I wanted to die with its beauty graffiti'd on the inside my skull.

Unexpectedly, there was the tearing of flesh and a soggy gurgle, followed by a few sputtering coughs.

Anthony‚Äôs hands released. Oxygen rushed into my starved lungs.

I opened my eyes.

A serrated dagger had been plunged into the soft flesh of his neck, skewering it completely. I saw a bit of the blade poking through on the other side. Dewdrops of blood and plasma seeped from the fatal wound, trickling over his collarbone and dripping onto my blouse. The scent of iron quickly coated the interior of my broken nose.

A hand still tightly gripped the dagger‚Äôs handle, but Anthony‚Äôs heavy knees had never left my elbows.

It wasn‚Äôt mine, but it came from me. I traced the ethereal limb from the knife to the center of my ribcage, where it had sprouted.

And it as swiftly as it appeared, the limb and dagger vanished. Before Anthony collapsed on top of me, I used my freed hands to push him off and to the side. He fell, hitting the coffee table as he tumbled. The resulting collision sent five burning candles crashing onto a large cotton blanket nearby.

His foyer became a bonfire.

I stood up, still weak and woozy from the prolonged suffocation. The sofa had caught flame too. Harsh black smoke began to diffuse throughout the apartment.

I raced down the stairs once again, but I reached a similar impasse.

The door remained mechanically locked.

I screamed. Cried out for someone to hear me. Twisted the knob so hard that it tore the skin on my right palm. All the while, a conflagration bloomed behind me.

I shifted my attention to the digital security dashboard aside the door. I pushed my fingers against the keyboard. The device whirred to life.

Four asterisks stood in my way. A PIN number was required to get to the home screen.

I tried my birthday, two digits for the month, two digits for the year.

Incorrect. A warning on the screen read¬†*two attempts left*

I tried Anthony‚Äôs birthday.

Nothing.

*One attempt left.*

My panic intensified, reaching a fever pitch in tandem with the ravenous flames one floor above.

Then, I heard it. At least, I think I heard it. Maybe my mind just clicked into place, and the realization was so profound that it felt like the noise began physically swirling around me.

Yet, I distinctly remember hearing the knocking from within the wall behind me.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

I held my breath.

*1-3-4-2.*

The screen opened.

I clicked¬†*UNLOCK*, twisted the knob, pushed my body against the door, and spilled out onto the street.

\- - - -

***The Gallery:***

When I arrived last night, a few hours after Anthony died, something was different.

The woman slithered out from the crack and started moving towards me. I met her halfway, next to the spiral stairs.

She grinned at me from the floor.

For the first time, I asked¬†*her*¬†a question.

*‚ÄúWhy could I not sense that Anthony was going to die?‚Äù*

She glided up my leg, draping her spine over my shoulders so she could be eye-to-eye with me. When she spoke, her sentences lacked the¬†*1-3-4-2*¬†rhythmic structure I'd come to know her by.

Her voice was high-pitched and raspy, and her mouth didn't actually move when she talked - she just kept it ajar and the words flowed out.

*‚ÄúBecause he was never supposed to die last night.*¬†***You***¬†*were supposed to die last night. That‚Äôs what was written. You can‚Äôt foretell something that‚Äôs never been written.‚Äù*

Her grin became sharper at the corners of her mouth, rapturous and grim.

*‚ÄúBut I intervened. You‚Äôd never get to the gallery unless I did something about it. Took a lot of work and planning, but I did it.*¬†***We***¬†*did it.‚Äù*

Then it was her turn to ask me something.

*‚ÄúAre you ready to see what‚Äôs below?‚Äù*

I nodded.

Immediately, the down arrow above the elevator lit up bright red, and a chiming sound echo‚Äôd through the gallery.

The doors opened, and I gasped.

There was the headless body of a woman standing motionless inside the elevator, wearing a flowing silver dress. She held a balloon in her hand. The side of it read¬†*‚ÄúHappy Birthday!‚Äù*¬†in a rainbow of colors.

The woman's head and her spine slithered ahead of me. It scaled the decapitated body and inserted its tail into the dry flesh between the body's collar bones until the head was snuggly attached.

I walked over and stepped in. The inside glistened, polished and reflective like a mirror. For the first time, I saw myself as I was within the gallery.

I‚Äôd always assumed I was the same age in the waking world that I was in the dreams. But I wasn‚Äôt. I was much, much older.

And that revelation really got me thinking.

Maybe the gallery has never been a dream. Maybe it‚Äôs been more of a premonition.

A vision of the future. The sight of a colossal, marble coffin towering above the ruins of an ever-burning city. An altar to the new gods of a new age.

The woman‚Äôs newly fastened head turned to me and whispered,

*‚ÄúIf you wake up before we get there, that‚Äôs OK. You‚Äôre finally safe. We can try again every night without fear. Eventually, with enough practice, you‚Äôll make it over the apotheotic threshold. We can bring this all to fruition, my love, my one-armed Valkyrie, my deep red moon.*‚Äù

*‚ÄúMy one and only daughter.‚Äù*

**Material and Construction:** The materials used significantly impact the case's durability, feel, and overall aesthetic.

Common materials include polycarbonate (PC), thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), leather, and various combinations of these. PC provides rigid protection against impacts, while TPU offers flexibility and shock absorption. Leather adds a touch of elegance and develops a unique patina over time. A well-constructed case combines these materials strategically, offering both protection and style. The quality of stitching, molding, and overall finish are important indicators of its craftsmanship.

**Protection and Impact Resistance:** Protecting the iPhone 15 from drops, scratches, and bumps is the primary function of any case.

Look for cases that offer raised edges around the screen and camera to prevent scratches when placed on surfaces. Reinforced corners provide additional protection against impacts. Some cases meet military-grade drop test standards, signifying they can withstand significant falls. The inner lining of the case should also be soft to prevent scratches on the phone's surface.

**Wireless Charging Compatibility:** Ensuring the case doesn't interfere with wireless charging is essential for modern convenience.

Most thin cases with card holders are compatible with wireless charging, but thicker cases or those with metal components may impede the charging process. It's crucial to check the manufacturer's specifications to confirm compatibility. Some cases even feature cutouts or specially designed areas to enhance wireless charging efficiency.

**Design and Aesthetics:** While functionality is paramount, the case should also complement the iPhone 15's design and reflect your personal style.

Cases come in a wide range of colors, finishes, and styles, from minimalist and sleek to rugged and utilitarian. Consider the case's profile and how it feels in your hand. Some cases offer a slim design that adds minimal bulk, while others provide a more substantial grip. The choice depends on your personal preferences and lifestyle.

 ## Core Benefits

Choosing an iPhone 15 case with a card holder offers several practical advantages.

**Streamlined Everyday Carry:** Consolidating your phone and wallet into one eliminates the need to carry separate items, reducing pocket bulk and simplifying your daily routine. Imagine running errands with just your phone, knowing your essential cards are securely stored within easy reach. This is especially convenient for minimalist lifestyles or situations where you want to travel light.

**Increased Convenience and Efficiency:** Having your cards readily accessible on your phone speeds up transactions and eliminates the fumbling often associated with traditional wallets. Whether you're paying for coffee, tapping into public transportation, or showing your ID, everything you need is right at your fingertips. This is particularly beneficial in fast-paced environments where efficiency is crucial.

**Enhanced Security and Organization:** Storing your cards securely in a dedicated compartment within the case minimizes the risk of loss or theft compared to a traditional wallet that can be easily misplaced or pickpocketed. Many cases feature secure closure mechanisms to prevent cards from accidentally falling out. The organized card slots also help you keep your essentials neatly arranged and easily identifiable.

1ke7e7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1ke7e7r/theres_a_woman_who_lives_inside_the_walls_of_my/,"There's a woman who lives inside the walls of my gallery. For fifteen years, she's been knocking against the marble, attempting to deliver a message I couldn't decipher - until last night. Now, I understand.","I‚Äôve always felt profoundly relieved to put that burning city behind me. Move past the death and destruction. Divide myself from the ash and the ruins, the rust-colored clouds and the blood-orange sky. Out of sight, out of mind.

Towering steel doors swung shut as I stepped into the gallery.

I sighed, allowing my shoulders to sag as I slowly twisted my neck. Left to right, right to left. The A/C hummed, and its crisp, mechanical breath crawled over my exposed skin. My body cooled. The muscles in my neck began to unwind.

This was my sanctuary. The last building standing. A great marble raft drifting above an ocean of rubble.

I couldn‚Äôt let myself completely relax, though.

Yes, the gallery was safer than the inferno outside its walls. Much safer. But it came with its own risks.

Because it wasn‚Äôt just¬†*my*¬†sanctuary: I shared the refuge with one other person. Unlike me, she never seemed to leave. She usually wasn‚Äôt visible when I entered, but she was always there.

If I couldn‚Äôt see her, that meant she was in the walls. If she was in the walls, she'd be knocking her forehead against the marble. She didn‚Äôt have any knuckles, so the woman made her skull an instrument.

Same pattern every time, measured and deliberate.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

The knocks were gentle, but the sound carried generously through the cavernous studio floor. It was a single box-shaped room with thirty-foot tall ceilings and not a lot in between. Each wall held a few paintings from artists of no renown. There was a spiral staircase in the center, but the sixty-eight metal steps led to nowhere, abruptly stopping two-thirds of the way up.

And most cryptically, there was the elevator. Directly across from the entrance. No buttons to call the damn thing. The outline of a down arrow above the doors I‚Äôd never seen flash. No one ever came out, and I knew no one ever would, either.

The elevator was a one-way trip, constructed for me alone. Wasn‚Äôt ever sure how I knew that, but I‚Äôd bet my life on its truth twenty times over.

So, there I‚Äôd be: by myself on the gallery floor, that snake of a woman slithering through its walls, surrounded by an empty, burning city for miles in every direction. It would always start with me approaching the massive steel doors, waves of heat galloping over my back, but when it would end was variable. It could take minutes, it could take hours. On rare occasions, it could take days or weeks.

Eventually, though, I‚Äôd wake up.

The same inscrutable dream, every night without fail, for over fifteen years. A transmission from the depths of a hollow reality that I never understood until last night.

*Tap, pause.*

***My Birth:***

Ever since I can remember, I‚Äôve felt out of place. An outsider among my own species. I‚Äôm sure a lot of people experience a similar pariah-hood, and I obviously can‚Äôt confirm my lived experience is distinct or extraordinary in comparison.

Let me provide an example - some objective proof of my otherness.

As soon as I drew a first breath, my mother‚Äôs heart stopped. Spontaneous cardiac arrest, no rhyme or reason. An unceremonious end, like the death of an old car battery. The medical team leapt into action. A few does of IV adrenaline later, the muscle wearily returned to duty.

But the moment her heart restarted, mine then stopped. Then they‚Äôd resuscitate me, only to have my mother die again. So on and so on.

The way my dad used to tell it, the doctors became incrementally more unnerved and bewildered each time we flipped. Life was a zero-sum game in that operating room: it was me or her, decreed God, or the reaper, or whatever unknowable divinity would be in charge of such a cosmic oddity. The uncanny tug-of-war would have probably been amusing to witness if the implications weren‚Äôt so deeply tragic.

Three or four cycles later, my mother‚Äôs heart gave out completely. Obstinately refused to beat, no matter what the medical team did. Dad would sometimes theorize that was an active decision made by the doctors that handled her care, even if they didn‚Äôt have ‚Äúthe balls‚Äù to admit it.

Like once they realized that one of us was dying, they arbitrarily awarded me with life. Started covertly injecting saline into my mother‚Äôs veins instead of adrenaline or something.

I doubt that last part actually happened. The circumstances were just viciously unfair, and that type of thing is fertile soil for growing conspiracy. Regardless, I felt his pain.

See, that‚Äôs the rub. Although I‚Äôve always felt like an outsider, that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôve lacked empathy. I have reverence for the people around me. I‚Äôve just never felt¬†*connected*¬†to any of them. I‚Äôm like a naturalist living alone in the jungle. I love the flora and the fauna. I respect the miracle that nature represents. But at the end of the day, I‚Äôm still alone.

Which brings me to Anthony.

***My Childhood:***

I experienced a fair amount of bullying as a kid, probably became a target on account of my quiet nature and my social isolation. A lone gazelle straying too far from the safety of the herd. They didn‚Äôt much bother me, though. I just couldn‚Äôt see them as predators: more like flies buzzing around my head. Noisy and a smidge irritating, but ultimately harmless.

That was the problem - they¬†*wanted*¬†to feel like predators, and I wasn't providing the sensation. Inciting fear and misery made them feel in control. So, when they couldn‚Äôt get a rise out of me with their routine arsenal of schoolyard mockery, things escalated.

And every time a new prank was enacted - a carton of milk spilled over my head, a few spiders dumped into my backpack, etc. - I would notice Anthony watching from the sidelines, livid on my behalf. Tall for his age, frizzy black hair, blue eyes boiling over with anger behind a pair of thick square glasses.

One afternoon, Austin, a dumber and more violent breed of bully, became fed up with my relative disinterest. Decided to take the torment up a notch. He snuck up behind me while I was eating lunch, stuck a meaty fist into my bun, and yanked a thick chunk of hair from my scalp.

That was certainly my line in the sand. It was Anthony‚Äôs too, apparently.

I spun around. Before he could even gloat, I lunged forward, opened my jaw, and bit down hard on his nearest elbow. At the same time, Anthony had been running up behind him with a metal lunch tray arched over his shoulder. The shiny rectangle connected to Austin‚Äôs temple with a loud clatter, almost like the ringing of a gong.

It was a real ‚Äúone-two‚Äù punch.

An hour later, Anthony and I had our first conversation outside the principal‚Äôs office, both waiting to be interrogated.

I‚Äôve never been quite comfortable with the way he looked at me, even back then. His grin was too wide, his focus too intense. On the surface, it was an affectionate expression. But there was something dark looming behind it all: a possessiveness. A smoldering infatuation that bordered on obsession.

I tried to ignore it, because I genuinely did like him. As a friend. He was the only one I felt comfortable confiding in. The only person who knew of the gallery and the burning city, other than myself.

Now, there‚Äôs no one else.

This post is designed to fix that.

***The Gallery:***

‚Äú*Ide conquers the Tarandos‚Äù*¬†was my favorite. (The first word is pronounced¬†*e-day*, I think.)

It wasn‚Äôt the largest painting in the gallery, nor was it the most technically impressive. There was just something bewitching about the piece, though. I found myself hopelessly magnetized to it for hours every night.

One foot long, about half a foot tall, with a frame composed of small, alternating suns and moons carved into the wood. It depicted a single-armed Valkyrie, with white wings and dull gray armor, lying on her back under the shade of a willow tree. A creature with the body of a man and the head of a stag is descending on her. Its face is contorted into a vicious snarl, arms outstretched with violent intent. The beast seems unaware of the serrated dagger in the Valkyrie‚Äôs singular hand, tenting the skin on the right side of its neck, about to draw blood.

Oil paint lended the scene a striking vibrancy. The grass appeared lush, almost palpable. The hair on the beast‚Äôs knuckles looked matted and dense, like it was overflowing with grease.

Studying that canvas made me feel alive. More than I‚Äôve ever felt in the waking world, honestly. However, that invigoration would fade into unease the moment my eyes landed on the two black holes above the Valkyrie‚Äôs head.

Because they weren't some bizarre artistic choice.

They were holes - literally.

Every painting in the gallery had a pair of them.

She liked to watch me look at the paintings every so often.

When she did, two bloodshot eyes would intensely monitor my gaze.

Sometimes, she'd watch for so long without blinking that tears would drip down the length of the piece.

Eventually, the frame would tremble with her message.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

***My Adolescence:***

*‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the holdup, then? Just do it already,‚Äù*¬†seventeen-year-old me proclaimed, unafraid and defiant.

The man in the ski-mask tilted his head. His glare dissipated. I stepped closer. The employee behind the counter stopped pulling bills from the register, eyes wide with disbelief.

*‚ÄúQuinn! What the fuck are you doing?‚Äù*¬†Anthony hissed, cowering behind a nearby rack of chips.

I sniffed the air. Ran my fingers along the countertop while licking my lips. Surveyed my surroundings by turning my head and perked my ears for unusual sounds.

Smell, touch, taste, sight, hearing: I re-sampled them all. Everything was as it should be.

I felt my confidence balloon further.

*‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it, bitch‚Ä¶I‚Äôll s-shoot. I ain‚Äôt afraid. I‚Äôll s-splatter your guts across the fucking floor‚Ä¶‚Äù*¬†the would-be criminal stuttered.

I stepped even closer. Close enough that the barrel of his pistol began digging into my chest.

*‚ÄúYeah, I heard you the first time, man.‚Äù*

I smiled, baring my teeth.

*‚ÄúSo, do it then. Look. I‚Äôm making it easy for you. Don‚Äôt even have to aim.‚Äù*

Like the flick of a switch, his demeanor changed. The gunman‚Äôs bravado collapsed in on itself, falling apart like paper mache in the rain.

Without saying another word, he sprinted from that CVS and disappeared into the night.

I flipped around so I could face Anthony, closed my eyes, and took an exaggerated bow. He wasn‚Äôt applauding. Neither was the flabbergasted kid behind the cash register, for that matter.

But I sure as shit pretended they were.

I was damn proud of my little parlor trick. Later that night, though, I‚Äôd ruin the magic. Anthony was insistent. Just wouldn‚Äôt let it go.

He wore me down.

So, I told him that didn‚Äôt experience any synesthesia. That meant we were safe. No one in that convenience store was going to die. My performance was just a logical extrapolation of that arcane knowledge.

No one was going to die relatively soon, anyway.

\- - - - -

My first dream of the burning city and the gallery came the night of my eleventh birthday. My ability to sense approaching death came soon after.

Synesthesia, for those of you unaware, is a neurological condition where the stimulation of one sense becomes involuntarily translated into the language of another sense.

But that probably sounds like a bunch of medical blather, so let me provide you with a few examples:

*The man tasted loud.*

*The apple felt bright.*

*The musical note sounded purple.*

You get the idea. It‚Äôs like nerves getting their wires crossed.

For a whole year before his death, my grandfather looked salty. His apartment smelled quiet. His voice sounded circular. And all of those queer sensations only became more intense as his expiration date approached.

I eventually picked up on the pattern.

Once I grasped the bounds of my extrasensory insight, death lost its hold over me. You see, death draws a lot of its power from anticipation. People don‚Äôt like surprises, especially shitty ones. Nobody wants to be startled by the proverbial monster under the bed. I, however, had become liberated.

I could feel death‚Äôs advance from miles away, therefore, I had nothing to fear. Nothing at all.

At least, that‚Äôs what I¬†*used*¬†to believe when I was young and dumb. Unfortunately, there are two major flaws in my supposed invulnerability that I completely swept under the rug. You may shouting them at your computer screen already.

1. Just because I could sense death didn‚Äôt mean I was shielded from the tragedies of life.
2. I didn‚Äôt know for certain that I could sense¬†*everyone‚Äôs*¬†death. There‚Äôs one person in particular who would be unverifiable by definition.

How could I be sure that I was capable of sensing my own death coming, if I had never died before?

***The Gallery:***

The night of my twelfth birthday, she finally revealed herself.

She finally came out.

There was a crack aside the elevator, no larger than the size of a volleyball. It was impossible to see what laid beyond that crack. Its darkness was impenetrable.

The woman wriggled out of that darkness and slithered towards me.

She had somehow been reduced to just a head with a spinal cord lagging behind it, acting as her tail.

Her movements were distinctly reptilian, rows of vertebrae swinging side to side, creating U-shaped waves of rattling bones as she glided across the marble floor.

I couldn‚Äôt see her face until she was only a few feet away. Long, unkempt strands of gray hair obscured her features, wreathing them behind a layer of silver filaments like the blinds on a window.

There was a crater at the center of her forehead. A quarter-sized circle of her skull had been completely pulverized from the incessant knocking.

She twirled around my leg, spiraling up my torso until she was high enough to drape her spinal cord over my shoulders.

Then, we were face to face, and she spoke the only eight words I‚Äôve ever heard spill from her withered lips until last night.

*""Are*

*You Ready*

*To See What Is*

*Below?""*

I shook my head. She looked disappointed.

Then, I woke up.

Three hundred and sixty-five days later, she‚Äôd wriggle out from the crack again to ask me the same question.

Year, after year, after year.

\- - - - -

***My Early Twenties***

In order for you to understand what transpired over the last twenty-four hours, I need to explain me and Anthony‚Äôs falling out.

The summer before I went away to college, he arrived at my doorstep and professed that he was in love with me. Had been for a long time, apparently.

His speech laid out all the gory details: how he believed we were soul mates, how perfect our children were going to be, how honored he was to get to die by my side.

Note the language. It wasn‚Äôt that he believed we¬†*could*¬†be soul mates, or that our children¬†*could*¬†be perfect. No, that phrasing was much too indefinite. From his perspective, our future was already sealed: written in the stars whether I liked it or not.

I tried to ease him back to reality gently. Reiterated the same talking points I‚Äôd harped on since he hit puberty.

Romantic love wasn‚Äôt in the cards for me. I was incapable of experiencing that level of connection with anyone. It had nothing to do with the value of him as a person or as a potential mate. My rejection wasn‚Äôt a judgement.

He wouldn‚Äôt hear it. Instead, he accused me of being a ‚Äústuck-up bitch‚Äù through bouts of rage-tinted sobs. I was going to college and he was staying in our hometown to take a job at his father‚Äôs factory. That must be it, he realized out loud. I didn't feel like he was good enough for me. He lacked prestige.

I think I responded to those accusations with something along the lines of:

*‚ÄúListen, Anthony, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm better than you. It‚Äôs not like that at all. We‚Äôre just different. Fundamentally different. I‚Äôm sorry, but that‚Äôs never going to change, either. Not for you and not for anyone else.‚Äù*

In retrospect, maybe I could have selected cleaner verbiage. In the heat of the moment, I don‚Äôt think he took the words as I intended.

From there, Anthony hurled a chair through my house‚Äôs living room window, stomped out the front door, and exited my life for a little over five years.

\- - - - -

***Current Day***

Fast forward to last week.

I returned to my hometown from my apartment in the city due to the death of my father, something I‚Äôd began feeling inklings of two years ahead of time. After the funeral, I‚Äôve focused on getting his estate in order, only venturing down onto main street once in the seven days I‚Äôve been here. The coffee machine broke, and I was in dire straits.

And who do I just so happen to run in to?

Anthony.

Honestly, I barely recognized him. He was no longer sporting a lanky frame, frizzy black hair, and thick bottlecap glasses. His body was muscular, almost Herculean. He slicked his hair back, varnishing it with some hideously pungent over-the-counter male beauty product. He no longer wore glasses now that he was able to afford a LASIK procedure - cured his shortsightedness for good.

I couldn‚Äôt detect the same darkness behind his eyes anymore, but that wasn‚Äôt because something purged it from his system.

He‚Äôd just gotten more proficient at hiding it.

\- - - - -

Last night, we went out for dinner and a drink. Platonically. I made that exceptionally transparent from the get-go. He teased me in response, inquiring whether my boyfriend in the city would come ‚Äúkick the shit out of him‚Äù if he heard I was out with an ‚Äúold flame‚Äù.

For what felt like the millionth time, I explained to Anthony that I wasn‚Äôt interested in that type of connection. Thus, I was single.

That made him smile.

Inevitably, he invited me back to his apartment. He was very proud of his lucrative new position in his company and the luxuries that came with it, and he wanted to show off.

I almost reminded him that it wasn‚Äôt¬†*his*¬†company. It was his father‚Äôs company. To avoid conflict, I held my tongue.

It might sound insane that I agreed to his invitation. Like I said, he concealed his darkness well. Anthony may have grown up to be a bit of a tool, but he was still the only person I ever felt close with. I was genuinely interested in seeing how his life had turned out.

I wasn‚Äôt experiencing¬†*any*¬†synesthesia around him, either. To me, that indicated relative safety: no one was going to die. If he tried something lecherous, an act of depravity that may not necessarily inflict death, well, that‚Äôs what pepper spray is for.

Anthony lived in a two-story brick row home on the outskirts of town. I walked in the door and was greeted by a tiny entrance nook followed by an extensive set of stairs, which led up to his ostentatious foyer-slash-entertainment room.

I won‚Äôt lie - it was impressive. That was the point, I think. His home was just a big, glossy distraction: something to keep your attention away from the bedeviled man who lurked within. Barely even noticed him tapping on some home security dashboard to the right of the front door.

I do remember hearing the heavy click of a motorized lock, though.

At that point, I was already walking up the stairs.

\- - - - -

For the next hour, we sat across from each on a massive leather sectional in his foyer, chitchatting over an additional glass of wine.

Eventually, though, enough was enough.

I think he sensed I was preparing to excuse myself and go home, because he leaned over, grabbed one of five stout candles off of the coffee table, and began lighting the wick with a box of matches he pulled from his blazer pocket.

I told Anthony it was getting late, and that it was time for me to leave. He didn‚Äôt say anything. He didn‚Äôt react to the sentence at all. He just kept silently lighting the candles.

When I witnessed the reflection of the burning wick in his eyes, I realized I had made a mistake.

*Fine,*¬†I thought.¬†*I don‚Äôt need his permission to leave.*

He didn‚Äôt say anything as I darted past him, jogging down the stairs. I pulled the knob to the front door.

It didn‚Äôt budge. There wasn't any obvious way to unlock it, either.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶Anthony? Can you kindly help me unlock the front door?‚Äù*¬†I called up, experiencing terror for the first time in years: a voracious chill eating its way through my chest

Nothing. No response. Not a peep.

Instead, the lights clicked off.

I felt a lump grow in the back of my throat.

Sweat poured over my temples.

I perked my ears. No footfalls. No sound.

No synesthesias.

Just darkness oozing down that silent corridor: a lurching tidal wave of black tar moments away from swallowing me whole.

I reached into my purse for my cellphone.

Then - furious movement down the stairs.

The sound of heavy boots stomping on hardwood filled my ears. Before I could react, he was looming over me. An open hand exploded out from the shadows and hooked onto my blouse collar. With one forceful pull, he yanked me to the ground. The bridge of my nose crashed into the edge of a stair as I fell. Electric pain writhed and crackled over my sinuses. My mouth felt hot and boggy as he lugged back up to the foyer.

Anthony quickly pinned me to the floor in front of the coffee table. I thrashed and struggled, but it wasn‚Äôt much use. He had positioned one muscular knee on each of my elbows. I was trapped.

Without uttering a word, he wrapped his meaty claws around my neck and squeezed.

The veins in his head pulsed, his face swollen with fury. I started to see double.

Consciousness liquefied and slipped through my fingertips.

I closed my eyes.

With the last few grains of life I had left, I thought of my favorite painting.

‚Äú*Ide conquers the Tarandos‚Äù*

I wanted to die with its beauty graffiti'd on the inside my skull.

Unexpectedly, there was the tearing of flesh and a soggy gurgle, followed by a few sputtering coughs.

Anthony‚Äôs hands released. Oxygen rushed into my starved lungs.

I opened my eyes.

A serrated dagger had been plunged into the soft flesh of his neck, skewering it completely. I saw a bit of the blade poking through on the other side. Dewdrops of blood and plasma seeped from the fatal wound, trickling over his collarbone and dripping onto my blouse. The scent of iron quickly coated the interior of my broken nose.

A hand still tightly gripped the dagger‚Äôs handle, but Anthony‚Äôs heavy knees had never left my elbows.

It wasn‚Äôt mine, but it came from me. I traced the ethereal limb from the knife to the center of my ribcage, where it had sprouted.

And it as swiftly as it appeared, the limb and dagger vanished. Before Anthony collapsed on top of me, I used my freed hands to push him off and to the side. He fell, hitting the coffee table as he tumbled. The resulting collision sent five burning candles crashing onto a large cotton blanket nearby.

His foyer became a bonfire.

I stood up, still weak and woozy from the prolonged suffocation. The sofa had caught flame too. Harsh black smoke began to diffuse throughout the apartment.

I raced down the stairs once again, but I reached a similar impasse.

The door remained mechanically locked.

I screamed. Cried out for someone to hear me. Twisted the knob so hard that it tore the skin on my right palm. All the while, a conflagration bloomed behind me.

I shifted my attention to the digital security dashboard aside the door. I pushed my fingers against the keyboard. The device whirred to life.

Four asterisks stood in my way. A PIN number was required to get to the home screen.

I tried my birthday, two digits for the month, two digits for the year.

Incorrect. A warning on the screen read¬†*two attempts left*

I tried Anthony‚Äôs birthday.

Nothing.

*One attempt left.*

My panic intensified, reaching a fever pitch in tandem with the ravenous flames one floor above.

Then, I heard it. At least, I think I heard it. Maybe my mind just clicked into place, and the realization was so profound that it felt like the noise began physically swirling around me.

Yet, I distinctly remember hearing the knocking from within the wall behind me.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

I held my breath.

*1-3-4-2.*

The screen opened.

I clicked¬†*UNLOCK*, twisted the knob, pushed my body against the door, and spilled out onto the street.

***The Gallery:***

When I arrived last night, a few hours after Anthony died, something was different.

The woman slithered out from the crack and started moving towards me. I met her halfway, next to the spiral stairs.

She grinned at me from the floor.

For the first time, I asked¬†*her*¬†a question.

*‚ÄúWhy could I not sense that Anthony was going to die?‚Äù*

She glided up my leg, draping her spine over my shoulders so she could be eye-to-eye with me. When she spoke, her sentences lacked the¬†*1-3-4-2*¬†rhythmic structure I'd come to know her by.

Her voice was high-pitched and raspy, and her mouth didn't actually move when she talked - she just kept it ajar and the words flowed out.

*‚ÄúBecause he was never supposed to die last night.*¬†***You***¬†*were supposed to die last night. That‚Äôs what was written. You can‚Äôt foretell something that‚Äôs never been written.‚Äù*

Her grin became sharper at the corners of her mouth, rapturous and grim.

*‚ÄúBut I intervened. You‚Äôd never get to the gallery unless I did something about it. Took a lot of work and planning, but I did it.*¬†***We***¬†*did it.‚Äù*

Then it was her turn to ask me something.

*‚ÄúAre you ready to see what‚Äôs below?‚Äù*

I nodded.

Immediately, the down arrow above the elevator lit up bright red, and a chiming sound echo‚Äôd through the gallery.

The doors opened, and I gasped.

There was the headless body of a woman standing motionless inside the elevator, wearing a flowing silver dress. She held a balloon in her hand. The side of it read¬†*‚ÄúHappy Birthday!‚Äù*¬†in a rainbow of colors.

The woman's head and her spine slithered ahead of me. It scaled the decapitated body and inserted its tail into the dry flesh between the body's collar bones until the head was snuggly attached.

I walked over and stepped in. The inside glistened, polished and reflective like a mirror. For the first time, I saw myself as I was within the gallery.

I‚Äôd always assumed I was the same age in the waking world that I was in the dreams. But I wasn‚Äôt. I was much, much older.

And that revelation really got me thinking.

Maybe the gallery has never been a dream. Maybe it‚Äôs been more of a premonition.

A vision of the future. The sight of a colossal, marble coffin towering above the ruins of an ever-burning city. An altar to the new gods of a new age.

The woman‚Äôs newly fastened head turned to me and whispered,

*‚ÄúIf you wake up before we get there, that‚Äôs OK. You‚Äôre finally safe. We can try again every night without fear. Eventually, with enough practice, you‚Äôll make it over the apotheotic threshold. We can bring this all to fruition, my love, my one-armed Valkyrie, my deep red moon.*‚Äù

*‚ÄúMy one and only daughter.‚Äù*

Then, I¬†[woke up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/)",2,1746318782.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False
1ke7die,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ke7die/theres_a_woman_who_lives_inside_the_walls_of_my/,"There's a woman who lives inside the walls of my gallery. For fifteen years, she's been knocking against the marble, attempting to deliver a message I couldn't decipher - until last night. Now, I understand.","I‚Äôve always felt profoundly relieved to put that burning city behind me. Move past the death and destruction. Divide myself from the ash and the ruins, the rust-colored clouds and the blood-orange sky. Out of sight, out of mind.

Towering steel doors swung shut as I stepped into the gallery.

I sighed, allowing my shoulders to sag as I slowly twisted my neck. Left to right, right to left. The A/C hummed, and its crisp, mechanical breath crawled over my exposed skin. My body cooled. The muscles in my neck began to unwind.

This was my sanctuary. The last building standing. A great marble raft drifting above an ocean of rubble.

I couldn‚Äôt let myself completely relax, though.

Yes, the gallery was safer than the inferno outside its walls. Much safer. But it came with its own risks.

Because it wasn‚Äôt just¬†*my*¬†sanctuary: I shared the refuge with one other person. Unlike me, she never seemed to leave. She usually wasn‚Äôt visible when I entered, but she was always there.

If I couldn‚Äôt see her, that meant she was in the walls. If she was in the walls, she'd be knocking her forehead against the marble. She didn‚Äôt have any knuckles, so the woman made her skull an instrument.

Same pattern every time, measured and deliberate.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

The knocks were gentle, but the sound carried generously through the cavernous studio floor. It was a single box-shaped room with thirty-foot tall ceilings and not a lot in between. Each wall held a few paintings from artists of no renown. There was a spiral staircase in the center, but the sixty-eight metal steps led to nowhere, abruptly stopping two-thirds of the way up.

And most cryptically, there was the elevator. Directly across from the entrance. No buttons to call the damn thing. The outline of a down arrow above the doors I‚Äôd never seen flash. No one ever came out, and I knew no one ever would, either.

The elevator was a one-way trip, constructed for me alone. Wasn‚Äôt ever sure how I knew that, but I‚Äôd bet my life on its truth twenty times over.

So, there I‚Äôd be: by myself on the gallery floor, that snake of a woman slithering through its walls, surrounded by an empty, burning city for miles in every direction. It would always start with me approaching the massive steel doors, waves of heat galloping over my back, but when it would end was variable. It could take minutes, it could take hours. On rare occasions, it could take days or weeks.

Eventually, though, I‚Äôd wake up.

The same inscrutable dream, every night without fail, for over fifteen years. A transmission from the depths of a hollow reality that I never understood until last night.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

***My Birth:***

Ever since I can remember, I‚Äôve felt out of place. An outsider among my own species. I‚Äôm sure a lot of people experience a similar pariah-hood, and I obviously can‚Äôt confirm my lived experience is distinct or extraordinary in comparison.

Let me provide an example - some objective proof of my otherness.

As soon as I drew a first breath, my mother‚Äôs heart stopped. Spontaneous cardiac arrest, no rhyme or reason. An unceremonious end, like the death of an old car battery. The medical team leapt into action. A few does of IV adrenaline later, the muscle wearily returned to duty.

But the moment her heart restarted, mine then stopped. Then they‚Äôd resuscitate me, only to have my mother die again. So on and so on.

The way my dad used to tell it, the doctors became incrementally more unnerved and bewildered each time we flipped. Life was a zero-sum game in that operating room: it was me or her, decreed God, or the reaper, or whatever unknowable divinity would be in charge of such a cosmic oddity. The uncanny tug-of-war would have probably been amusing to witness if the implications weren‚Äôt so deeply tragic.

Three or four cycles later, my mother‚Äôs heart gave out completely. Obstinately refused to beat, no matter what the medical team did. Dad would sometimes theorize that was an active decision made by the doctors that handled her care, even if they didn‚Äôt have ‚Äúthe balls‚Äù to admit it.

Like once they realized that one of us was dying, they arbitrarily awarded me with life. Started covertly injecting saline into my mother‚Äôs veins instead of adrenaline or something.

I doubt that last part actually happened. The circumstances were just viciously unfair, and that type of thing is fertile soil for growing conspiracy. Regardless, I felt his pain.

See, that‚Äôs the rub. Although I‚Äôve always felt like an outsider, that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôve lacked empathy. I have reverence for the people around me. I‚Äôve just never felt¬†*connected*¬†to any of them. I‚Äôm like a naturalist living alone in the jungle. I love the flora and the fauna. I respect the miracle that nature represents. But at the end of the day, I‚Äôm still alone.

Which brings me to Anthony.

\- - - - -

***My Childhood:***

I experienced a fair amount of bullying as a kid, probably became a target on account of my quiet nature and my social isolation. A lone gazelle straying too far from the safety of the herd. They didn‚Äôt much bother me, though. I just couldn‚Äôt see them as predators: more like flies buzzing around my head. Noisy and a smidge irritating, but ultimately harmless.

That was the problem - they¬†*wanted*¬†to feel like predators, and I wasn't providing the sensation. Inciting fear and misery made them feel in control. So, when they couldn‚Äôt get a rise out of me with their routine arsenal of schoolyard mockery, things escalated.

And every time a new prank was enacted - a carton of milk spilled over my head, a few spiders dumped into my backpack, etc. - I would notice Anthony watching from the sidelines, livid on my behalf. Tall for his age, frizzy black hair, blue eyes boiling over with anger behind a pair of thick square glasses.

One afternoon, Austin, a dumber and more violent breed of bully, became fed up with my relative disinterest. Decided to take the torment up a notch. He snuck up behind me while I was eating lunch, stuck a meaty fist into my bun, and yanked a thick chunk of hair from my scalp.

That was certainly my line in the sand. It was Anthony‚Äôs too, apparently.

I spun around. Before he could even gloat, I lunged forward, opened my jaw, and bit down hard on his nearest elbow. At the same time, Anthony had been running up behind him with a metal lunch tray arched over his shoulder. The shiny rectangle connected to Austin‚Äôs temple with a loud clatter, almost like the ringing of a gong.

It was a real ‚Äúone-two‚Äù punch.

An hour later, Anthony and I had our first conversation outside the principal‚Äôs office, both waiting to be interrogated.

I‚Äôve never been quite comfortable with the way he looked at me, even back then. His grin was too wide, his focus too intense. On the surface, it was an affectionate expression. But there was something dark looming behind it all: a possessiveness. A smoldering infatuation that bordered on obsession.

I tried to ignore it, because I genuinely did like him. As a friend. He was the only one I felt comfortable confiding in. The only person who knew of the gallery and the burning city, other than myself.

Now, there‚Äôs no one else.

This post is designed to fix that.

\- - - - -

***The Gallery:***

‚Äú*Ide conquers the Tarandos‚Äù*¬†was my favorite. (The first word is pronounced¬†*e-day*, I think.)

It wasn‚Äôt the largest painting in the gallery, nor was it the most technically impressive. There was just something bewitching about the piece, though. I found myself hopelessly magnetized to it for hours every night.

One foot long, about half a foot tall, with a frame composed of small, alternating suns and moons carved into the wood. It depicted a single-armed Valkyrie, with white wings and dull gray armor, lying on her back under the shade of a willow tree. A creature with the body of a man and the head of a stag is descending on her. Its face is contorted into a vicious snarl, arms outstretched with violent intent. The beast seems unaware of the serrated dagger in the Valkyrie‚Äôs singular hand, tenting the skin on the right side of its neck, about to draw blood.

Oil paint lended the scene a striking vibrancy. The grass appeared lush, almost palpable. The hair on the beast‚Äôs knuckles looked matted and dense, like it was overflowing with grease.

Studying that canvas made me feel alive. More than I‚Äôve ever felt in the waking world, honestly. However, that invigoration would fade into unease the moment my eyes landed on the two black holes above the Valkyrie‚Äôs head.

Because they weren't some bizarre artistic choice.

They were holes - literally.

Every painting in the gallery had a pair of them.

She liked to watch me look at the paintings every so often.

When she did, two bloodshot eyes would intensely monitor my gaze.

Sometimes, she'd watch for so long without blinking that tears would drip down the length of the piece.

Eventually, the frame would tremble with her message.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

***My Adolescence:***

*‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the holdup, then? Just do it already,‚Äù*¬†seventeen-year-old me proclaimed, unafraid and defiant.

The man in the ski-mask tilted his head. His glare dissipated. I stepped closer. The employee behind the counter stopped pulling bills from the register, eyes wide with disbelief.

*‚ÄúQuinn! What the fuck are you doing?‚Äù*¬†Anthony hissed, cowering behind a nearby rack of chips.

I sniffed the air. Ran my fingers along the countertop while licking my lips. Surveyed my surroundings by turning my head and perked my ears for unusual sounds.

Smell, touch, taste, sight, hearing: I re-sampled them all. Everything was as it should be.

I felt my confidence balloon further.

*‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it, bitch‚Ä¶I‚Äôll s-shoot. I ain‚Äôt afraid. I‚Äôll s-splatter your guts across the fucking floor‚Ä¶‚Äù*¬†the would-be criminal stuttered.

I stepped even closer. Close enough that the barrel of his pistol began digging into my chest.

*‚ÄúYeah, I heard you the first time, man.‚Äù*

I smiled, baring my teeth.

*‚ÄúSo, do it then. Look. I‚Äôm making it easy for you. Don‚Äôt even have to aim.‚Äù*

Like the flick of a switch, his demeanor changed. The gunman‚Äôs bravado collapsed in on itself, falling apart like paper mache in the rain.

Without saying another word, he sprinted from that CVS and disappeared into the night.

I flipped around so I could face Anthony, closed my eyes, and took an exaggerated bow. He wasn‚Äôt applauding. Neither was the flabbergasted kid behind the cash register, for that matter.

But I sure as shit pretended they were.

I was damn proud of my little parlor trick. Later that night, though, I‚Äôd ruin the magic. Anthony was insistent. Just wouldn‚Äôt let it go.

He wore me down.

So, I told him that didn‚Äôt experience any synesthesia. That meant we were safe. No one in that convenience store was going to die. My performance was just a logical extrapolation of that arcane knowledge.

No one was going to die relatively soon, anyway.

\- - - - -

My first dream of the burning city and the gallery came the night of my eleventh birthday. My ability to sense approaching death came soon after.

Synesthesia, for those of you unaware, is a neurological condition where the stimulation of one sense becomes involuntarily translated into the language of another sense.

But that probably sounds like a bunch of medical blather, so let me provide you with a few examples:

*The man tasted loud.*

*The apple felt bright.*

*The musical note sounded purple.*

You get the idea. It‚Äôs like nerves getting their wires crossed.

For a whole year before his death, my grandfather looked salty. His apartment smelled quiet. His voice sounded circular. And all of those queer sensations only became more intense as his expiration date approached.

I eventually picked up on the pattern.

Once I grasped the bounds of my extrasensory insight, death lost its hold over me. You see, death draws a lot of its power from anticipation. People don‚Äôt like surprises, especially shitty ones. Nobody wants to be startled by the proverbial monster under the bed. I, however, had become liberated.

I could feel death‚Äôs advance from miles away, therefore, I had nothing to fear. Nothing at all.

At least, that‚Äôs what I¬†*used*¬†to believe when I was young and dumb. Unfortunately, there are two major flaws in my supposed invulnerability that I completely swept under the rug. You may shouting them at your computer screen already.

1. Just because I could sense death didn‚Äôt mean I was shielded from the tragedies of life.
2. I didn‚Äôt know for certain that I could sense¬†*everyone‚Äôs*¬†death. There‚Äôs one person in particular who would be unverifiable by definition.

How could I be sure that I was capable of sensing my own death coming, if I had never died before?

\- - - - -

***The Gallery:***

The night of my twelfth birthday, she finally revealed herself.

She finally came out.

There was a crack aside the elevator, no larger than the size of a volleyball. It was impossible to see what laid beyond that crack. Its darkness was impenetrable.

The woman wriggled out of that darkness and slithered towards me.

She had somehow been reduced to just a head with a spinal cord lagging behind it, acting as her tail.

Her movements were distinctly reptilian, rows of vertebrae swinging side to side, creating U-shaped waves of rattling bones as she glided across the marble floor.

I couldn‚Äôt see her face until she was only a few feet away. Long, unkempt strands of gray hair obscured her features, wreathing them behind a layer of silver filaments like the blinds on a window.

There was a crater at the center of her forehead. A quarter-sized circle of her skull had been completely pulverized from the incessant knocking.

She twirled around my leg, spiraling up my torso until she was high enough to drape her spinal cord over my shoulders.

Then, we were face to face, and she spoke the only eight words I‚Äôve ever heard spill from her withered lips until last night.

*""Are*

*You Ready*

*To See What Is*

*Below?""*

I shook my head. She looked disappointed.

Then, I woke up.

Three hundred and sixty-five days later, she‚Äôd wriggle out from the crack again to ask me the same question.

Year, after year, after year.

\- - - - -

***My Early Twenties***

In order for you to understand what transpired over the last twenty-four hours, I need to explain me and Anthony‚Äôs falling out.

The summer before I went away to college, he arrived at my doorstep and professed that he was in love with me. Had been for a long time, apparently.

His speech laid out all the gory details: how he believed we were soul mates, how perfect our children were going to be, how honored he was to get to die by my side.

Note the language. It wasn‚Äôt that he believed we¬†*could*¬†be soul mates, or that our children¬†*could*¬†be perfect. No, that phrasing was much too indefinite. From his perspective, our future was already sealed: written in the stars whether I liked it or not.

I tried to ease him back to reality gently. Reiterated the same talking points I‚Äôd harped on since he hit puberty.

Romantic love wasn‚Äôt in the cards for me. I was incapable of experiencing that level of connection with anyone. It had nothing to do with the value of him as a person or as a potential mate. My rejection wasn‚Äôt a judgement.

He wouldn‚Äôt hear it. Instead, he accused me of being a ‚Äústuck-up bitch‚Äù through bouts of rage-tinted sobs. I was going to college and he was staying in our hometown to take a job at his father‚Äôs factory. That must be it, he realized out loud. I didn't feel like he was good enough for me. He lacked prestige.

I think I responded to those accusations with something along the lines of:

*‚ÄúListen, Anthony, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm better than you. It‚Äôs not like that at all. We‚Äôre just different. Fundamentally different. I‚Äôm sorry, but that‚Äôs never going to change, either. Not for you and not for anyone else.‚Äù*

In retrospect, maybe I could have selected cleaner verbiage. In the heat of the moment, I don‚Äôt think he took the words as I intended.

From there, Anthony hurled a chair through my house‚Äôs living room window, stomped out the front door, and exited my life for a little over five years.

\- - - - -

***Current Day***

Fast forward to last week.

I returned to my hometown from my apartment in the city due to the death of my father, something I‚Äôd began feeling inklings of two years ahead of time. After the funeral, I‚Äôve focused on getting his estate in order, only venturing down onto main street once in the seven days I‚Äôve been here. The coffee machine broke, and I was in dire straits.

And who do I just so happen to run in to?

Anthony.

Honestly, I barely recognized him. He was no longer sporting a lanky frame, frizzy black hair, and thick bottlecap glasses. His body was muscular, almost Herculean. He slicked his hair back, varnishing it with some hideously pungent over-the-counter male beauty product. He no longer wore glasses now that he was able to afford a LASIK procedure - cured his shortsightedness for good.

I couldn‚Äôt detect the same darkness behind his eyes anymore, but that wasn‚Äôt because something purged it from his system.

He‚Äôd just gotten more proficient at hiding it.

\- - - - -

Last night, we went out for dinner and a drink. Platonically. I made that exceptionally transparent from the get-go. He teased me in response, inquiring whether my boyfriend in the city would come ‚Äúkick the shit out of him‚Äù if he heard I was out with an ‚Äúold flame‚Äù.

For what felt like the millionth time, I explained to Anthony that I wasn‚Äôt interested in that type of connection. Thus, I was single.

That made him smile.

Inevitably, he invited me back to his apartment. He was very proud of his lucrative new position in his company and the luxuries that came with it, and he wanted to show off.

I almost reminded him that it wasn‚Äôt¬†*his*¬†company. It was his father‚Äôs company. To avoid conflict, I held my tongue.

It might sound insane that I agreed to his invitation. Like I said, he concealed his darkness well. Anthony may have grown up to be a bit of a tool, but he was still the only person I ever felt close with. I was genuinely interested in seeing how his life had turned out.

I wasn‚Äôt experiencing¬†*any*¬†synesthesia around him, either. To me, that indicated relative safety: no one was going to die. If he tried something lecherous, an act of depravity that may not necessarily inflict death, well, that‚Äôs what pepper spray is for.

Anthony lived in a two-story brick row home on the outskirts of town. I walked in the door and was greeted by a tiny entrance nook followed by an extensive set of stairs, which led up to his ostentatious foyer-slash-entertainment room.

I won‚Äôt lie - it was impressive. That was the point, I think. His home was just a big, glossy distraction: something to keep your attention away from the bedeviled man who lurked within. Barely even noticed him tapping on some home security dashboard to the right of the front door.

I do remember hearing the heavy click of a motorized lock, though.

At that point, I was already walking up the stairs.

\- - - - -

For the next hour, we sat across from each on a massive leather sectional in his foyer, chitchatting over an additional glass of wine.

Eventually, though, enough was enough.

I think he sensed I was preparing to excuse myself and go home, because he leaned over, grabbed one of five stout candles off of the coffee table, and began lighting the wick with a box of matches he pulled from his blazer pocket.

I told Anthony it was getting late, and that it was time for me to leave. He didn‚Äôt say anything. He didn‚Äôt react to the sentence at all. He just kept silently lighting the candles.

When I witnessed the reflection of the burning wick in his eyes, I realized I had made a mistake.

*Fine,*¬†I thought.¬†*I don‚Äôt need his permission to leave.*

He didn‚Äôt say anything as I darted past him, jogging down the stairs. I pulled the knob to the front door.

It didn‚Äôt budge. There wasn't any obvious way to unlock it, either.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶Anthony? Can you kindly help me unlock the front door?‚Äù*¬†I called up, experiencing terror for the first time in years: a voracious chill eating its way through my chest

Nothing. No response. Not a peep.

Instead, the lights clicked off.

I felt a lump grow in the back of my throat.

Sweat poured over my temples.

I perked my ears. No footfalls. No sound.

No synesthesias.

Just darkness oozing down that silent corridor: a lurching tidal wave of black tar moments away from swallowing me whole.

I reached into my purse for my cellphone.

Then - furious movement down the stairs.

The sound of heavy boots stomping on hardwood filled my ears. Before I could react, he was looming over me. An open hand exploded out from the shadows and hooked onto my blouse collar. With one forceful pull, he yanked me to the ground. The bridge of my nose crashed into the edge of a stair as I fell. Electric pain writhed and crackled over my sinuses. My mouth felt hot and boggy as he lugged back up to the foyer.

Anthony quickly pinned me to the floor in front of the coffee table. I thrashed and struggled, but it wasn‚Äôt much use. He had positioned one muscular knee on each of my elbows. I was trapped.

Without uttering a word, he wrapped his meaty claws around my neck and squeezed.

The veins in his head pulsed, his face swollen with fury. I started to see double.

Consciousness liquefied and slipped through my fingertips.

I closed my eyes.

With the last few grains of life I had left, I thought of my favorite painting.

‚Äú*Ide conquers the Tarandos‚Äù*

I wanted to die with its beauty graffiti'd on the inside my skull.

Unexpectedly, there was the tearing of flesh and a soggy gurgle, followed by a few sputtering coughs.

Anthony‚Äôs hands released. Oxygen rushed into my starved lungs.

I opened my eyes.

A serrated dagger had been plunged into the soft flesh of his neck, skewering it completely. I saw a bit of the blade poking through on the other side. Dewdrops of blood and plasma seeped from the fatal wound, trickling over his collarbone and dripping onto my blouse. The scent of iron quickly coated the interior of my broken nose.

A hand still tightly gripped the dagger‚Äôs handle, but Anthony‚Äôs heavy knees had never left my elbows.

It wasn‚Äôt mine, but it came from me. I traced the ethereal limb from the knife to the center of my ribcage, where it had sprouted.

And it as swiftly as it appeared, the limb and dagger vanished. Before Anthony collapsed on top of me, I used my freed hands to push him off and to the side. He fell, hitting the coffee table as he tumbled. The resulting collision sent five burning candles crashing onto a large cotton blanket nearby.

His foyer became a bonfire.

I stood up, still weak and woozy from the prolonged suffocation. The sofa had caught flame too. Harsh black smoke began to diffuse throughout the apartment.

I raced down the stairs once again, but I reached a similar impasse.

The door remained mechanically locked.

I screamed. Cried out for someone to hear me. Twisted the knob so hard that it tore the skin on my right palm. All the while, a conflagration bloomed behind me.

I shifted my attention to the digital security dashboard aside the door. I pushed my fingers against the keyboard. The device whirred to life.

Four asterisks stood in my way. A PIN number was required to get to the home screen.

I tried my birthday, two digits for the month, two digits for the year.

Incorrect. A warning on the screen read¬†*two attempts left*

I tried Anthony‚Äôs birthday.

Nothing.

*One attempt left.*

My panic intensified, reaching a fever pitch in tandem with the ravenous flames one floor above.

Then, I heard it. At least, I think I heard it. Maybe my mind just clicked into place, and the realization was so profound that it felt like the noise began physically swirling around me.

Yet, I distinctly remember hearing the knocking from within the wall behind me.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

I held my breath.

*1-3-4-2.*

The screen opened.

I clicked¬†*UNLOCK*, twisted the knob, pushed my body against the door, and spilled out onto the street.

\- - - -

***The Gallery:***

When I arrived last night, a few hours after Anthony died, something was different.

The woman slithered out from the crack and started moving towards me. I met her halfway, next to the spiral stairs.

She grinned at me from the floor.

For the first time, I asked¬†*her*¬†a question.

*‚ÄúWhy could I not sense that Anthony was going to die?‚Äù*

She glided up my leg, draping her spine over my shoulders so she could be eye-to-eye with me. When she spoke, her sentences lacked the¬†*1-3-4-2*¬†rhythmic structure I'd come to know her by.

Her voice was high-pitched and raspy, and her mouth didn't actually move when she talked - she just kept it ajar and the words flowed out.

*‚ÄúBecause he was never supposed to die last night.*¬†***You***¬†*were supposed to die last night. That‚Äôs what was written. You can‚Äôt foretell something that‚Äôs never been written.‚Äù*

Her grin became sharper at the corners of her mouth, rapturous and grim.

*‚ÄúBut I intervened. You‚Äôd never get to the gallery unless I did something about it. Took a lot of work and planning, but I did it.*¬†***We***¬†*did it.‚Äù*

Then it was her turn to ask me something.

*‚ÄúAre you ready to see what‚Äôs below?‚Äù*

I nodded.

Immediately, the down arrow above the elevator lit up bright red, and a chiming sound echo‚Äôd through the gallery.

The doors opened, and I gasped.

There was the headless body of a woman standing motionless inside the elevator, wearing a flowing silver dress. She held a balloon in her hand. The side of it read¬†*‚ÄúHappy Birthday!‚Äù*¬†in a rainbow of colors.

The woman's head and her spine slithered ahead of me. It scaled the decapitated body and inserted its tail into the dry flesh between the body's collar bones until the head was snuggly attached.

I walked over and stepped in. The inside glistened, polished and reflective like a mirror. For the first time, I saw myself as I was within the gallery.

I‚Äôd always assumed I was the same age in the waking world that I was in the dreams. But I wasn‚Äôt. I was much, much older.

And that revelation really got me thinking.

Maybe the gallery has never been a dream. Maybe it‚Äôs been more of a premonition.

A vision of the future. The sight of a colossal, marble coffin towering above the ruins of an ever-burning city. An altar to the new gods of a new age.

The woman‚Äôs newly fastened head turned to me and whispered,

1ke79pa,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1ke79pa/struggling_to_curb_my_appetite_need_help/,Struggling to curb my appetite - need help,"Hi I need some advice on how to curb my appetite, especially for high carb and high fat foods. I'm 28 and I had a baby 2 years ago. As a child, I was a very picky eater and was very skinny. Only wanted to eat hotdogs and candy. I also had grown up around my mother who used to worry a lot about her weight in front of me. Although she never called me fat or commented that much on my weight, she did it to herself and it still affected me. She did belly dancing classes and I would use to join her as well for fear of being fat. I was very skinny but I really wanted to keep it. When I was about 12, I had started to gain a bit of weight and that's when things got worse for me. Although I wasn't really what would be considered fat at the time, I was always know  as the skinny girl so when I gained a little bit, it drove me insane. I used to skip breakfast and dinner and would only eat a few snacks at school. I lived in southeast asia at the time and it was the 2000s, so eating disorders really weren't taken that seriously. I also never starved myself enough to go to the hospital. I only had one episode where I fainted in school from hypoglycemia. 

Then I moved to Canada with my family and even though nobody thought I was fat, I still felt I was. I did the same thing here in Canada, except I would skip breakfast and lunch and eat only snacks for dinner (like 1-2 cookies). I used to drink a lot of water also caused I used to be in the choir, so I didn't feel hungry much. 

This went on for years basically and there would be times where I would binge for a day and then back to normal. But it wasn't very often. 

When I first met my partner, we were working at a factory 10hr shifts 4days a week--I used to only eat 2 italian wafer crackers (I forgot what they're called) for the entire shift and then go to bed. He used to get worried about me and would offer me some of his lunch. I wasn't starving cause I didn't have food or money to buy food, just really scared of getting fat.

Then when we started dating, things got worse. I got more comfortable and started to eat what I like. We loved to go out to eat and then we also had some stressors that caused me to start binge eating. Although I wouldn't purge, I felt super bad and would go on extreme diets to make up for it. I would stick for a month or two and then some stress comes in and I lose control again. Then I feel even worse and eat more. 

I had my son about 2 years ago. Prior to being pregnant, I had started going to the gym for 2 years and was on a pretty good diet. I've never felt so good in my life, mentally and physically (not so much emotionally). But then end of 2nd trimester came and I had to give away my cat cause my mil wouldn't let me take her with us (we were moving in with her cause rent is crazy expensive and we'd rather help her with her mortgage than some greedy landlord). I was devastated and started to eat sweets and high fat foods. I was then diagnosed with gestational diabetes. I've been way too fat ever since. I'm not very tall so I'm very close to being obese for my height. I didn't really worry too much at the time cause I just had a baby. I waited at least 1 year before I started to work on my weight. I managed to lose 15lbs of my pregnancy weight, but I feel compared to how much other people lose, it's not a lot. And I'm still nowhere near my ideal weight of 125lbs. 

Anyway, I gained all the weight back again cause we had gone through some serious financial issues and some personal issues as well. I've been having a really hard time not consuming carbs and fatty foods. It doesn't help now I work from home full time. I try to get much activity in, but sometimes I just feel very exhausted even when my husband helps. My mil can't really help except providing us material things cause she works a lot. I've been spiralling so much. I tried going back to weight lifting again 2 months ago. Stuck for 2 months but then I injured myself and couldn't go for a while. Also I didn't lose much at the time cause I was still eating a considerable amount. I've signed up to run 5k for October to hopefully get myself moving. But the real problem is the cravings. Whenever I do groceries, I don't really buy snacks. But then I get cravings especially on my time of the month and then I spiral out of control. So I started buying snacks with our groceries, but still not helping cause I just eat it all. 

I'm so sick of it. I feel tired and mentally fogged up most days. I don't drive yet so I can't even always go to the gym and I'm working lots of over time right now to help pay off some of my debt. I'm hating how I look more and more everyday and how all the food I eat makes me feel. But I can't stop the cravings. I've tried berberine but it makes me super constipated. I tried to eat Keto in the morning, I do well. Keto was the only thing worked for me when I was weight lifting. But then afternoon comes and I lose it. I was also told I was prediabetic at my 3 month postpartum bloodwork.

One of my biggest issues is, we eat a lot of carbs in my culture. Our food is mostly rice and potatoes and my husband likes to eat. I also have a really bad sweet tooth, I don't like candy as much but I love chocolate, ice cream, and cakes. I try not to eat them but I'm in this cycle now where I feel I need something sweet after I meal. I don't drink sugary drinks much but I've been finding myself drinking them more lately and have started to even add sugar to my coffee.

I hope you guys can help me with some advice. I'm not sure if there's anything I'm missing here. I don't know what else I can do, I've tried literally everything to curb the cravings.

**Chapter 1: Why ‚Äúmedicine‚Äù does not cure disease**

The human body has water-rationing systems, which are managed by histamine, and when these systems become more and more active, they activate their own alarm signals to show that the area in question is short of water. Tea, coffee, alcohol and manufactured beverages are NOT substitutes for the daily bodily needs of water. It is true that these beverages contain water but they also contain dehydrating agents: the caffeine and alcohol. In an attempt to get rid of these dehydrating agents the body gets rid of the water they came in plus an additional amount of water from the body‚Äôs reserves, which creates a net loss of water from the body. Over the long term this results in internal deep-tissue dehydration that becomes progressively worse with eventual permanent damage and then loss of function to the area of the body crying for water. Practitioners are not aware of the many chemical roles of water in the body and they prescribe pharmaceutical products to silence the body‚Äôs many alarms signaling a water shortage. The practitioners interpret the body‚Äôs many alarms of water shortage as symptoms of unknown diseases. Additionally, the established signal-producing chronic dehydration has a permanently damaging impact on subsequent descendants of the person.

At the moment, the dry mouth is the only accepted sign of systemic dehydration but the author explains that this is actually the LAST outward signal of extreme deep-tissue dehydration. The damage caused by persistent dehydration does not necessarily generate a dry mouth signal but does generate a multitude of other signals to be discussed in later chapters.

**Chapter 2: The new paradigm**

The neuro-transmitter histamine and its subordinate agents become increasingly active during the regulation of water requirements. Therefore, the action of histamine should not be continuously blocked with pharmaceutical products (Benadryl, Pepcid etc.). ¬†As water flows osmotically through the cell membrane it generates hydroelectric power, which is then stored as ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and GTP (guanosine triphosphate). ATP and GTP are used to power all cellular functions. Inside nerve cells there are small ‚Äúwaterways‚Äù that transport manufactured products to the nerve endings for use in neurotransmission. When any tissue is in a dehydrated state the whole environment becomes more viscous and as a result proteins and enzymes become less efficient.

According to the author the new scientific truth (paradigm shift) is: 'Water, the solvent of the body, regulates all functions, including the activity of the solutes it dissolves and circulates' (currently it is believed that solutes regulate all functions of the body). This should become the basis of all future approaches to medical research. When the body is dehydrated it shifts into a pre-determined priority program ‚Äì a form of drought management. The *histamine* directed and operated neurotransmitter system becomes active and initiates the subordinate systems that promote water intake. Subordinate systems employ vasopressin, renin-angiotensin, prostaglandins and kinins as the intermediary agents. Since the body does not have a reserve of water to draw on, it operates a priority distribution system for the amount of water that is already has available. From this it can be deduced that consuming anti-histamine pharmaceuticals is detrimental to the body‚Äôs water-managing abilities.

When the neurotransmitter histamine and its subordinate water regulators become excessively active, to the point of causing allergies, asthma and chronic pains in different parts of the body, these pains should be translated as **thirst signals** of a local area. Non-infectious 'recurring' or chronic pains should be viewed as indicators of body thirst. These chronic pains include dyspeptic pain, rheumatoid arthritis pain, anginal pain (heart pain on walking, or even at rest), low back pain, intermittent claudication pain (leg pain on walking), migraine and hangover headaches, colitis pain and its associated constipation. No less than two and a half quarts of water in 24 hours should be taken for a few days prior to the routine and regular use of analgesics or other pain-relieving medications such as anti-histamine or antacids.

**Chapter 3: Dyspeptic pain**

Dyspeptic pain is the most important signal that denotes dehydration. Of the dyspeptic pains (gastritis, duodenitis, and heartburn) should be treated with an increase in water intake alone. It is now said that ulcers are the result of infections. The author‚Äôs opinion based on his research is that the variety of curved bacteria, called helicobacters, blamed for causing ulcerations, are commensals (bacteria that naturally dwell in the intestines). They may take unfair advantage of the immune system suppression that is the direct outcome of dehydration. The author also discusses colitis, false appendicitis and bulimia in the context of dehydration.

**Chapter 4: Rheumatoid arthritis pain**

Cartilage cells are immersed in a matrix that contains a lot of water. As the cartilage surfaces glide over each other some cells die and peel off. New cells arise from the growing ends that are attached to the bones. In well hydrated cartilage, the rate of friction is minimal but in a dehydrated cartilage the rate of abrasive damage is increased. Initially, rheumatoid-arthritic joints and their pain are to be viewed as indicators of water deficiency in the cartilage surfaces. The author notes that the actively growing blood cells in the bone marrow take priority over the cartilage during drought management in the body and this leads to dehydrated cartilage. This initial pain should be treated with water alone otherwise the condition will progress to bone-on-bone osteoarthritis. To avoid disfigurement, one should take this as a signal of local dehydration. Water acts as a lubricating agent in all joints and it bears the force produced by the weight or the tension produced by muscle action on the joint. The author goes on to explain how dehydration also plays a role in low back pain, neck pain, anginal pain, and headaches. He also provides a detailed explanation of how joints become disfigured due to lack of water initially.

**Chapter 5: Stress and depression**

The pathology that is associated with social stresses is the result of water deficiency. The brain uses electrical energy that is generated by the water driving the energy-generating pumps. With dehydration, the level of energy generation in the brain is decreased. Many functions of the brain that depend on this type of energy become inefficient. Currently this is called depression and can lead to chronic fatigue syndrome. Dehydration itself is a stress and once it is established there is an associated mobilization of primary materials from body stores. This process will mop up some of the water reserves of the body. So dehydration causes stress and stress will cause further dehydration. During stress the fight-or-flight response is initiated causing the release of endorphins, cortisone release factor, prolactin, vasopressin and renin-angiotensin. Endorphins prepare the body to endure hardship and injury until it gets out of danger. Cortisone will initiate the mobilization of stored energies and under this influence the body will just ‚Äúfeed‚Äù off itself. Prolactin will make sure that a lactating mother will continue to produce milk even in the setting of dehydration. Vasopressin regulates the selective flow of water into cells that are most important (the most important cells have the most vasopressin receptors). It so happens that nerve cells have the most vasopressin receptors so dehydration will eventually manifest as a depression of function of the central nervous system.

Alcohol suppresses the release of vasopressin from the pituitary gland in the brain compromising the protection against brain-cell dehydration that vasopressin provides. To cope with this stress the body secretes its own addictive endorphins to provide relief from pain. So, prolonged use of alcohol may be a major contributing factor to promoting addictive tendencies to endorphin secretion by triggering an excess of endorphin secretions.

¬†The renin-angiotensin (RA) system is a subordinate system to histamine activation in the brain and it is very active in the kidneys. It is activated to retain water and sodium. Until the water and sodium content reach a preset level the RA system also tightens the capillary beds and the vascular system so that there is no empty space in the circulatory system. This tightening can become measurable and we call it hypertension. While the kidneys have the ability to concentrate urine this ability should not be used to its extreme at all times because it will eventually cause kidney damage.¬† When the kidneys are damaged and urine productions is too low the RA system becomes more active. Kidney damage may in fact be the consequence of long-term dehydration and salt depletion. The turn OFF switch for the RA system is water and a little bit of salt in that order until the measurable vascular tightening (hypertension) falls to a normal range.

The salivary glands are capable of sensing a salt shortage and they produce a substance called kinins which promote increased blood circulation to the salivary glands to increase saliva production. This lubricates the mouth for food intake (even in a dehydrated state) and its alkaline nature promotes food breakdown. Since all the body systems are integrated the presence of kinins in the saliva activates the RA system and this exposes the error of considering a dry mouth as the sole indicator of water shortage.

What about drinking tea, coffee or colas in place of water? These are central nervous system stimulants and dehydrating agents due to their strong diuretic effect on the kidneys. Central nervous system stimulants liberate energy from ATP (adenosine triphosphate) stores by converting it to its burnt state of cyclic AMP (adenosine mono-phosphate). In essence, caffeine wastes the body‚Äôs energy stores and causes further dehydration.

The author discusses experimental models that showed caffeine inhibited the enzyme PDE (phosphor-di-esterase, which is involved in learning and memory formation. The author states that anyone with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease or children with learning disabilities should never drink any caffeinated drinks.

**Chapter 6: High blood pressure**¬†

This chapter begins with the statement that high blood pressure is the result of an adaptive process to a gross body water deficiency. When a person doesn‚Äôt drink enough water, the body will take water from cells deemed as low priority at that time causing them to become dehydrated and rerouting that water to systems of high priority.

During a body drought 66% of water is taken from cells, 26% from the interstitial fluid (fluids around the cells)¬†and 8% from the blood volume.¬†In this circumstance there is no alternative for the blood vessels other than¬†to close their lumen to cope with the loss in blood volume (so that there is no empty space in the circulatory system). This process¬†begins by closing¬†some¬†capillaries in less active areas. The deficient¬†quantity of water must come¬†either¬†from outside¬†or¬†be taken from another¬†part of the body. If the appropriate amount of water is not consumed this essentially causes high blood pressure.

The author asserts the importance of physical exercise in those who have high blood pressure because when a person exercises the capillaries in the muscles begin to open and blood pressure goes down. During ¬†¬†normal physiological function the capillaries do not give resistance to the inflowing blood, but when the body is in drought mode the capillaries constrict which causes resistance to blood flow. In order to overcome this resistance, the body is forced to increase pressure to push the blood through the capillaries.

The author maintains that all blood tests can appear normal but the capillaries can be closed in the heart and brain causing damage during a prolonged dehydrated state. A dehydrated state can be maintained for a very long time until a person ultimately becomes very ill and dies. If we do not drink enough water the only other way the body has to secure water is by retaining sodium, which is a last resort. This then leads to prescribing of diuretics, which cause more water loss. Water itself is the best diuretic and must be reintroduced gradually.

**Chapter 7: High blood cholesterol**¬†

The chapter opens with this: higher blood cholesterol is a sign that the cells¬†of¬†the¬†body¬†have¬†developed a defense mechanism against losing their water. Cholesterol is a natural 'clay' substance that,¬†when¬†poured¬†in the gaps¬†of¬†the¬†cell membrane, will make the cell wall impervious to the passage¬†of¬†water. It is a necessary substance and its excess denotes dehydration.¬†Normally, it is¬†water¬†that instantly, repeatedly and transiently forms¬†into adhesive sheets¬†and¬†binds the hydrocarbon bricks together to maintain the membrane‚Äôs structural integrity. In a¬†dehydrated membrane, this¬†property¬†of¬†water¬†is lost and cholesterol steps in as a savior.

**Chapter 8: Excess body weight**¬†

The brain has mechanisms to detect low energy levels for its functions in turn causing the sensation of thirst and hunger. To release energy from stored fat hormonal mechanisms are involved. This process takes a little time and requires some physical activity for the energy to be released. As a result, this process does not meet the urgent energy demands of the brain. ¬†The front part of the brain gets its energy from hydroelectricity (as described earlier) or from sugar in blood circulation. ¬†The brain‚Äôs functional needs for hydroelectricity are more urgent, which includes the energy formation from water and the transport of this energy (ATP & GTP) within the microstream flow system that depends on even more water.

As a result of the brain‚Äôs dual need for water and energy the sensations of thirst and hunger are generated at the same time. As a society we do not recognize the sensations of thirst (described earlier) and we assume it is an indicator of the urge to eat. So we eat food even when the body should receive water. In individuals who managed to lose weight by drinking water before eating food managed to separate the two sensations. They did not overeat to satisfy an urge for the intake of water. The general rule is as follows: when the hunger urge arise drink water (with some salt which will be discussed later) and see if the urge is satisfied. If yes, then your body was thirsty. If the hunger sensation returns drink another such portion and if the hunger sensation returns after a second or perhaps third portion it is safe to assume that your body is requesting food. So, eat.

Brain cells store energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and GTP (guanine triphosphate) in different locations in the cell but most are stored within the membranes. The cell membrane is the location where stimulation is received and an action is initiated. Since all brain cells also have an energy-rationing system not all stimulation will receive energy to produce an action.

The brain¬†calculates and understands what is important and what is not important for its energy needs. When ATP reserves are low, many stimuli are deemed of low priority and do not¬†invoke a response. This low ATP reserve in some overactive brain cells will¬†become¬†reflected as a fatigue state in the functions controlled¬†by those brain cells. Exactly¬†the¬†same process is in operation for the GTP reserves. In¬†certain¬†emergency actions, some energy from¬†GTP reserves can¬†be¬†diverted to boost the ATP reserves to sustain¬†some¬†of¬†the most essential functions that¬†would¬†otherwise¬†suffer from lack¬†of¬†local energy.

The storage of energy in the brain's energy reserves rely heavily¬†on the availability of sugar in the blood. The brain is constantly drawing from the blood sugar to replenish its ATP and GTP reserves. Recently it has¬†been discovered that¬†the¬†human¬†body has the ability to generate hydroelectric¬†energy¬†when¬†water, by itself, goes through the cell¬†membrane and turns some very special energy generating pumps¬†(like the hydroelectric¬†power¬†generation¬†when¬†a¬†dam¬†is built on a large river). So basically, the brain uses¬†two¬†mechanisms for its¬†energy requirements: one, from metabolism of food and formation¬†of sugar; two, from its water supply and conversion of hydroelectric¬†energy into ATP and GTP. Water is also needed to transport these energy molecules to different parts of the body.

To satisfy the brain‚Äôs energy needs the body developed a normal range of sugar concentration in the blood. It does this by stimulating the intake of proteins and starchy foods, both of which will be converted to sugar (glucose). Some starches and proteins from the body stores will also be converted to sugar. If this is still not enough the liver will begin making sugar (gluconeogenesis) from other materials. So first the body converts starches into sugar, then proteins into sugar and finally a little bit of fat into sugar (fat conversion is a very slow process).

In children, fat stores are¬†brown¬†in color (due to abundant mitochondria) and have a lot of blood¬†circulation in them. In¬†brown¬†fat, fat is metabolized directly and heat¬†is generated. In later years of life fat stores have less blood circulation¬†and less mitochondria (the fat becomes white). As a result, the fat is less accessible to¬†the¬†enzymes that would mobilize the fatty¬†acids for conversion in the liver and the muscles into energy. Remember that in dehydration the capillaries also constrict further reducing blood flow and thus reducing access even more to all this energy in the fat.¬†Additionally, when¬†muscles are¬†inactive,¬†they¬†are more easily attacked and their protein is broken¬†down for conversion into sugar (so exercise is a must). However, if muscles are used, they¬†begin to metabolize some of their stored fat as a preferred¬†source of¬†energy to do¬†work¬†and maintain or increase their bulk.

Finally, when the brain energy demands are high (times of stress) and the body is not able to provide the brain with¬†its energy needs, a less disciplined person may overeat. This becomes more detrimental if one does not recognize thirst signals and consumes food instead of water. The capillaries constrict reducing blood flow to fat stores and the fat stores themselves increase with continued overeating and dehydration worsening.

Manufactured beverages (sodas, coffee and juices) do not replace the body‚Äôs daily needs for water. The assumption that all fluids are equivalent to water is wrong and is a major contributor to the poor health of society. Caffeine, one of the main components of most sodas, is a drug (and regulated by the FDA). It¬†has addictive properties because of its direct action¬†on¬†the brain (energy release as described above). It also acts¬†on¬†the kidneys and causes increased urine production.¬†Caffeine has diuretic properties. It is, physiologically, a dehydrating agent. This characteristic is the main reason a person is forced to¬†drink so many cans of soda every day and never be satisfied. The water does not stay in the body long enough. At the same time, many¬†people confuse their feeling of thirst for water: thinking they have consumed enough 'water' that is in the soda, they assume they are¬†hungry and begin to eat more than their body's¬†need¬†for food. Thus, dehydration caused by caffeine-containing sodas will, in¬†due¬†time,¬†cause a gradual gain in weight from overeating as a direct result of confusion of thirst and hunger sensations.

Caffeine has 'pick-me-up' properties. It stimulates the brain/body even when a person is exhausted. It seems that caffeine lowers the threshold of ATP-reserves control (so more energy is wasted). Stored ATP is used up for some functions that would not normally gain access to it when there is a set level of reserves. When sodas contain sugar, at least some of the brain's need for sugar (energy) is satisfied. If caffeine is releasing ATP energy to enhance performance, at least its sugar companion will replenish some of the lost ATP, even if the final result is a deficit expenditure of ATP by the brain.

  
The author further explains that through his own observations he determined that diet sodas even though they contain no appreciable amount of calories are possibly the cause of weight gain in individuals who drink them to not gain weight. A case is presented of a young man who gained significant weight while consuming diet soda. An explanation into this paradox is presented. There are many people who resort to consuming diet sodas and, instead of losing weight, begin to gain it. Many admitted they could not live without soft drinks. If deprived, they would develop withdrawal symptoms, much like those addicted to other drugs. But the media, in order to placate the beverage industry have come up with a less expressive word to announce this news, caffeine dependency. Gross disfigurement of the body by fat collection is the initial step in the decline of the body, and in the author‚Äôs opinion is caused by the wrong choice of fluids intake.

In the 1980s aspartame was introduced into the market and became incorporated into over five thousand recipes. In the intestinal tract, aspartame converts to two highly excitatory neurotransmitter amino acids: aspartate and phenylalanine, as well as methyl alcohol/formaldehyde wood alcohol. It is claimed the liver renders methyl alcohol non-toxic. But the author personally thinks this claim is made to brush aside voiced objections for commercialization of a manufactured 'food' that has a known toxic by-product.

If caffeine converts ATP to AMP (a burnt fuel) aspartate converts GTP energy reserves to GMP. Both AMP and GMP are spent fuels and they cause thirst/hunger to replace the lost fuel reserves in the brain cells. Thus, diet sodas cause indiscriminate overuse of the energy reserves of cells in the brain.

It is a recognized scientific fact that spent fuel AMP causes hunger. Caffeine causes addiction, and people who consume it on a regular basis should be assumed to be 'sodaholics'. Hence, caffeinated diet sodas used by sedentary persons must cause weight gain by indirectly stimulating more food intake because of the brain's forced use of its energy reserves. Bear In mind that only some of the energy value of foods eaten will be used by the brain. The rest of the consumed energy will be stored as fat if it is not used by muscle activity. This weight gain is one of many results of diet soda consumption. It has also been shown that non-nutritive sweeteners (zero calories) enhance the appetite and increase short-term food intake.

Asthma and allergies are indicators that¬†the¬†body¬†has¬†resorted¬†to an¬†increase in¬†the production¬†of the neurotransmitter histamine, the¬†master regulator of water metabolism and its distribution in the body. It is¬†recognized that asthmatics have an increase in histamine¬†content¬†in their lung tissue and that it is the histamine that regulates the¬†bronchial muscle contraction. Since one of the sites for water loss through evaporation is in the lungs, bronchial constriction¬†produced¬†by histamine means less¬†water¬†evaporation during the act of breathing, all in an effort to preserve the body‚Äôs water

¬†In addition to histamine‚Äôs role in regulating water it has responsibilities in antibacterial, antiviral and anti-foreign-agents (chemicals and proteins) defense system. When the body is dehydrated the release of histamine for water management becomes exaggerated to the point where there may not be enough of it for its other roles. It has been shown that rehydrating the body decreases histamine levels to normal (generally after one to four weeks of water replenishment).

¬†It should be noted that when a body is dehydrated the blood is more concentrated and when this concentrated blood reaches the lungs it provokes histamine release leading to bronchial constriction. This is the mechanism by which the body tries to preserve its water supply by preventing us from breathing off water vapor. The author cautions to not overdrink thinking that the damage of many months or years of dehydration can be achieved by an excessive intake of water in a few days. A person must drink a normal amount on a daily basis about 8 to 10 eight-ounce glasses until a full hydration of the body is achieved over a longer period of time.

The author points out that when there is a water shortage in the body it begins to retain salt. Some people have inefficient salt regulatory systems coupled with bad education about salt-free diets.¬†In¬†certain¬†people,¬†salt shortage in¬†the¬†body¬†can¬†occur¬†and¬†become¬†symptom-producing in exactly¬†the¬†same way as¬†water¬†shortage,¬†such¬†as¬†some¬†arthritis pains.

It is the author‚Äôs understanding that in severe asthma attacks, salt¬†shortage¬†is a major contributing factor.¬†A vital secret that the author shares here is that: salt is a natural antihistamine. People with allergies¬†should begin to increase their salt intake to prevent excess histamine¬†production.

Water is¬†needed¬†in the lungs to¬†keep¬†the air passages moist¬†and¬†prevent¬†them¬†from drying up¬†when¬†air goes in and¬†comes¬†out.¬†In¬†dehydration, mucus secretion¬†protects¬†air passages from drying. In¬†the first stages of asthma, mucus is¬†secreted¬†to¬†protect¬†the tissues. There comes a time when¬†too much¬†mucus is secreted and that mucus stays put,¬†preventing normal passage of air¬†through¬†the airways. Salt is a¬†natural mucus breaker, and it is normally secreted¬†to¬†make mucus ‚Äòdisposable'. That¬†is¬†why phlegm tastes salty when it comes in contact¬†with the tongue.

**Chapter 10: Some metabolic aspects of stress and dehydration**¬†

¬†Insulin- independent diabetes (type 2), which is most common in the elderly is probably the end result of brain-water deficiency to the point that its neurotransmitter system, especially the serotonergic system is being affected. The brain physiology is that it automatically increases blood glucose for its own needs. The present consensus is that the bulk of the energy needs of the brain is provided by glucose. The author believes that this is only true if there is a water and salt shortage, which are essential for the generation of hydroelectric energy. When there is a shortage of water the brain has no choice but to rely solely on sugar for its energy needs whereas in a fully hydrated brain the water itself would provide energy in the form of hydroelectricity.

¬†The reason and the mechanism for altering blood sugar levels are simple. When histamine becomes active in water regulation and energy management, it also activates a group of substances¬†known¬†as¬†*prostaglandins*¬†(PGs). PGs are involved in a subordinate¬†system (of histamine) for rationed distribution of water to the cells in the body.¬†The pancreas is a complex gland located¬†between¬†the stomach and¬†the duodenum. The pancreas, other than being the seat¬†of¬†insulin manufacture, is engaged in the production of large quantities of a bicarbonate-¬†containing¬†watery¬†solution. This bicarbonate solution is emptied into¬†the duodenum to neutralize acid¬†coming¬†from the stomach. The acid¬†from the stomach is neutralized while the stimulating agent, PG (E¬†type),¬†is involved in shunting circulation to the pancreas so the watery¬†bicarbonate solution can be made. In this manner it naturally inhibits the secretion of insulin from the pancreas.¬†So, when the body needs to make large amounts of the bicarbonate solution, insulin production is reduced and vice versa. This is because insulin promotes the movement of potassium and sugar into the cells of the body and the entry of amino acids into cells. Accompanying the passage of potassium, sugar and amino acids is water. By this action the amount of water available is reduced for high priority systems (according to the water-rationing system managed by histamine). Therefore, in a dehydrated state the action of insulin is counterproductive. In this manner water is made available for the act¬†of¬†food digestion and acid neutralization in the intestines. When¬†insulin secretion is inhibited, the metabolism¬†of¬†the¬†body is severely disrupted,¬†with¬†the exception of the brain. In¬†a dehydrated state, the brain benefits from insulin inhibition.

¬†**Chapter 11: New ideas on AIDS**

The author presents many years of his research that AIDS is¬†not¬†a viral disease,¬†but¬†a metabolic disorder precipitated by an exaggerated way¬†of¬†life. It can equally¬†be¬†caused by severe¬†malnutrition in¬†poorer¬†and¬†famine-stricken societies.¬†He states ‚ÄúI know this view is completely against current beliefs forced by the media presentation of a social problem, but it is the responsibility of dedicated scientists to take it into consideration and explore all aspects of this problem.‚Äù

People who suffer from AIDS are consistently and drastically short of methionine, cystine and cysteine - all very important amino acids. They also have a manifold rise in levels of arginine and glutamate. This imbalance lasts for a long time before a patient becomes ill.

A series of experiments showed that when IL-6 (interleukin-6) and another similar substance (TNF - tumor necrosis factor) are added to a cell culture medium that contains cells with the ability to produce the HIV virus, those particles are labeled HIV. If, before the addition of IL-6 or TNF, cysteine is added to the same culture medium, HIV particles are not produced. Thus, there would seem to be a direct correlation between HIV production in AIDS and amino acid content of the virus-growing cell. So, it appears that AIDS patients have an imbalance of amino acids. The basic amino acids are required even to make antibodies (proteins) so they are compromised in their ability to fight infections even when not overtly sick.

Interleukin-6 and interlekin-1 are produced to mobilize primary raw materials from body reserves to fight stress and repair possible damages from the confrontation of a stressor. Their function is designed to break down proteins of the body and convert them to basic amino acids for use in the liver for other purposes. This is a process where the body feeds off itself.

The author presents the following scenario to illustrate this point:

A bruised boxer or a person traumatized in an accident or after repeated surgery will depend on these physiological processes to clear the ineffective and nonviable tissue and repair, and remodel the site of damage. If the reconstruction is extensive and IL-6 and its companion TNF are involved, breakdown of DNA or RNA of the damaged and dying cells will produce exact fragments to clear the debris, very much like having to dismember the steel structure of a large building that cannot be 'bulldozed away' and has to be carried off the site, a piece at a time. This is a very well recognized process in the research of surgical wounds. But in the setting of HIV/AIDS virologists are presenting the 'site clearing action' (and the resulting fragments of DNA and RNA) of these two agents in the body as steps in production of HIV in cell culture media. Basically, some of the pieces of RNA and DNA that result from the clean-up efforts of severely damaged cells of the body are labeled as ‚ÄúHIV particles‚Äù but these in fact are particles of our own DNA/RNA demolition.

The immune-suppressing properties of semen is discussed in the context of vaginal versus anal sex. After semen is deposited into a vagina it causes immunosuppression of the female‚Äôs immune system to ensure the delivery of the sperm to the egg. Furthermore, if conception occurs, the mother‚Äôs immune system remains suppressed during the entire pregnancy to ensure the survival of the fetus. The semen in a vagina is not absorbed systemically (due to thick walls) and is drained instead. In the rectum semen is retained and due to its thin lining is absorbed systemically. The intestinal wall is not capable of withstanding the forces involved in rectal manipulation for sexual purposes. The reason such manipulation becomes possible is due to one single fact: the intestinal tract does not have an acute pain sensory system if damaged from inside unless the damage involves the peritoneum (a thin outside cover of the gastrointestinal tract). However, the rectum is not completely covered by this layer so the rectum can be damaged without the damage being felt. As part of the repair mechanism interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and TNF will be secreted. If bacteria also enter systemic circulation as a result of this damage more of these substances will be secreted. (It has been shown experimentally that AIDS patients have markedly increased levels of IL-6 and TNF in their blood.) Interleukin-6 will also destroy insulin-producing cells in the pancreas and this falls in line with the diabetes seen in advanced full-blown AIDS.

In laboratory research, it has been shown that cysteine prevents the production of HIV in cultured cells. Other laboratory research has shown that AIDS patients are short of cysteine and its precursor cystine. In two simple-to-understand experiments, a metabolic basis for the development AIDS has been clearly demonstrated.

**Chapter 12: The simplest of treatments in medicine**

¬†At a minimum the body needs six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day. Manufactured beverages don‚Äôt count. Drink one glass 30 minutes before each meal then another glass two and a half hours after eating. Make sure you drink the minimum at least. Water is the cheapest medical intervention for a dehydrated body.

The author states that a salt-free diet is utterly stupid and he gives his rule of thumb for daily salt and water intake: For every ten glasses of water (about 2 quarts), one should add to the diet about half of a teaspoon of salt per day (a quarter teaspoon per quart). An average teaspoon can contain 6 grams of salt. Half of a teaspoon is about 3 grams of salt. Of course, you should make sure that your kidneys are producing urine. Otherwise, the body will swell up. If you sense your skin and ankles are beginning to swell, do not panic. Reduce salt intake for a few days, but increase your water intake until the swelling in the legs has disappeared.

**My Comments:**

I invite you to alter your concept of salt. Society has taught us is that salt is just sodium chloride (white table salt). I would like you to think of salt (singular) as saltS (plural) instead and always reference whole salt (saltS) in your mind. Whole salt (saltS) comes directly from the mine or the ocean (no factory processing). It contains all the salts (minerals), such as: sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphates, iron, zinc, manganese, copper, selenium and many other trace minerals. So salt is definitely not sodium chloride, it is a collection of many saltS. So why would a society extract sodium chloride and call it salt? What is done with the rest of the saltS from whole salt? Those saltS are sent to pharmaceutical companies who prepare vials (or tablets or powders) of potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate, sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, calcium chloride, calcium gluconate and many others which are then given to patients intravenously or in TPN (total parenteral nutrition) because these patients are deficient in these minerals. So these companies take the precious minerals out of our whole salt and then sell them back to us after we become deficient. What an evil profiteering scheme!

¬†Sometimes in causal conversation I speak to people about the importance of saltS and most seem to be under the impression that the few grains of salt they sprinkle on their food is sufficient. If this is you, keep reading. I present to you that a massive amount of saltS is lost just through urination and it is my position that this saltS sacrifice is necessary to efficiently remove waste products from blood plasma. Water always travels osmotically from an area of low concentration of solutes to an area of high concentration of solutes. The kidney does have active energy-dependent pumps for removing wastes which are dissolved in the blood plasma. But by pushing out saltS into the urine the body takes advantage of water‚Äôs natural movement from low concentration to high concentration thus making waste removal that much more efficient.

Below are normal URINARY parameters just for 4 minerals:

Sodium 40-220 mEq/24 hours¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† [www.ucsfhealth.org](http://www.ucsfhealth.org)

Potassium 25-125 mEq/24 hours¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† [www.ucsfhealth.org](http://www.ucsfhealth.org)

Chloride 110-250 mEq/L¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† [https://healthmatters.io](https://healthmatters.io)

Magnesium 72-120mg/24 hours¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† [https://healthmatters.io](https://healthmatters.io)

¬†

Converting to milligrams:

Sodium 920mg ‚Äì 5,060mg/24 hours

Potassium 977.5mg ‚Äì 4,887.5 mg/24 hours

Chloride 3,894mg ‚Äì 8,850mg/24 hours

Magnesium 72-120mg/24 hours¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

So, on the low side the daily urinary loss of just these 4 minerals is 5,863mg and on the high side it is 18,917.5mg. Converting these to grams the range is 5.8g to 18.9g. I will argue that the loss on the low side of 5.8 grams is substantial and it constitutes a little more than a flat teaspoon. A few sprinkles of saltS will not replenish this loss. If you would like to test your urinary levels of these minerals you will have to ask your healthcare provider to order them separately as they are not part of the standard urinalysis.

If we do not replenish our saltS in an appropriate amount starting from the time we emerge from the womb then the consequence is that we will urinate out all of our mineral stores during our young years. As the body loses water (as described by Dr. Batmanghelidj) and loses saltS some ‚Äúunknown disease‚Äù will emerge at some point when the loss passes a certain threshold of tolerance.

I need a win!,"I have been on keto in the past and lost about 70lbs then with only tracking net carbs and not even going to the gym (I was moderately active with my dogs and sometimes walking to work).

I went off it initially because of a terrible living situation and drama which made it hard to stay on track when surrounded by awful people etc.

So I restarted last April and did well for a couple months to then have another traumatizing event caused by another person.


Fast forward to this year. I started back up in March 2025 and have not eaten outside of the diet so far and I feel better.

However, I am feeling a bit lost as I am not making progress like I did or want to. I am also probably being unrealistic. Thank mental illness I supposed.

So the good part:

- My appetite is in check (I have an eating disorder so this is awesome).

- I don't mindlessly eat or snack. 

- I cook more (I do enjoy new recipes)

- I drink a lot more water 

- I don't crave soda and if I want bubbles I enjoy the Bubly brand seltzers but majority of my drinking is water (I don't like coffee, I don't drink alcohol, and I only ever have tea if I am making bullet proof tea and this is mostly a pick me up thing)

The part I am not happy with:

 - the scale. I know this is just a way to track here and there but I feel like the amount of progress I have made this should have improved.

- I can't tell if intermittent fasting is doing anything good or bad other then puting me on a schedule to eat and not eat (which I guess is the basic things for IF) I always did 16:8. I would fast from 9pm to 1pm the next day as I am not big on eating first thing in the morning normally.

- I don't notice changes in clothing fitting or anything else.



Maybe I'm just being too hard on myself but I want this to workout.

I jave also been adding some physical activity to just get stronger: i.e. sit ups, weights, planks. And I walk with dogs.

My highest weight was 280lb back in 2019. I got down to 208lb then and then my ex ruined that and I gained back a lot (however my clothes mostly still fit). So April 2024 I was at 278lb and starring in March 2025 I weighed 250lb. And last week I was 240lb and this week I am 245lb (mind you I started my period this week so that may affect the random weight gain as I fluctuate 5lbs that time of the month).

I keep my net carbs under 20 and rarely hit 20 on a normal day. I make it a point to eat less processed stuff and majority of the things I eat are what I made from scratch. The only sweetener I use if I do use one is monk fruit as it does not make me feel bad or weird like others do.

I just wanna preface this by apologizing for how long this is but I‚Äôm promise 99% of it is all relevant, I‚Äôve been holding this all in for years. Thank you to anyone who takes the time to listen to my story.  

  Growing up as a kid I never had problems making friends. I went to birthday parties, and sleepovers, played sports, had a best friend, all the normal stuff. Oh yeah, I was born in 97 making 27 currently. I‚Äôm the youngest of three children and have an older brother who much like other little brothers, I was heavily influenced by. Growing up we watched Viva la bam and jackass, and all the other early 2000s nostalgia. I developed a love for skateboarding through this and got quite good actually, this carried on into high school and grew into an obsession. I‚Äôd spend my days in class watching full Baker videos (a skateboarding company and its promotional film) and daydreaming about skating until that turned into skipping my last two classes to go skate a mostly empty skatepark and hangout with the older ‚Äúcool‚Äù skaters. This where I first smoked for the first time out of a little one hitter. 

   I do just wanna say real quickly I do not credit weed to my struggles with addiction, not alone at least. I believe it‚Äôs the crowd that I was running with. Anyways, as you can already tell I didn‚Äôt stop there. Next came Acid and shrooms, then Molly, then Ketamine, to coke, which led to crack, Percocet, and heroine all within a matter of probably two years (from 16-18 roughly). The addiction was only the beginning of my problems. 

  Somewhere around the age of 18 I dislocated my right shoulder skating and never got it looked at, just popped it back in. Well it ended up coming out a handful more of times over the course of about 2-3 months. Enough to the point where I had to get a reconstructive surgery on it. After surgery I was prescribed Oxy, at the time I was way passed abusing pills, I knew I could sell them and get way more real drugs, so that‚Äôs what I did. Thankfully (and yes I truly mean thankfully because this is what saved my life and god knows who else‚Äôs) I sold them to an undercover cop. I was charged with manufacturing and delivery of a schedule l or ll narcotics. I was Sentenced to 3 years in prison and 5 years of parole. 

  By the time I was actually convicted and started my sentence, the Covid pandemic was just starting to getting started. This had a major impact on jails and prisons alike all around the country with virtually every single one shutting down and going in lockdown mode. This meant during my staffing phase of my sentence (for those who don‚Äôt know to my knowledge all inmates that go to prison get ‚Äústaffed‚Äù or classified as a particular security level at a separate staffing facility before going to their permanent prison) I would have to quarantine in (upon arrival) and out (upon departure) 21 days each. There‚Äôs a bunch more small details I could include but to make a long story short, I ended sitting in a 6x8 cell by myself with nothing but a bible and 7 for my entire stay at the staffing facility, a total of 96 days. 

  The unit I was in held was a 50 cell unit and held two per cell but because COVID had 1 per cell. The prison staff would let us make 15 min phone calls in rotation going 1-50. But this was only when it was convenient to them, this would equate to about getting out for 15 min once ever 4-5 days. Not only that, they made us choose between using our 15 minutes to make a call or shower as there was only one shower on the entire unit. This was also the exact time when I‚Äôm girlfriend of 3 years prior to being incarcerated just stopped picking up my calls. I didn‚Äôt know if she was dead, or just didn‚Äôt love me anymore. This was the second lowest point of my life behind losing my father in my childhood home at 17. 

  Those 96 days in that 6x8 changed something in me. The happy go lucky and outgoing kid that could make friends with anyone was molded into a cold and angry man. My first real fight was 1 on 3 and I had to put in a request slip to be seen by a nurse. The request slip was denied. After going to my permanent prison, things got slightly better but worse at the same time. I had more freedom, but with more freedom comes more problems. Within my first month I got into two more fights, the 1st simply because I was new and was being tested, and the 2nd because I got the better of the first guy and his buttbuddy didn‚Äôt like that so they both snuck me (pushed me in a room and shut the door for a 2 on 1) while heading to chow hall. I ended up getting 60 day segregation which is just another 60 days of isolation. The third day out of set, I was playing cards with 3 buddies until 2 of em got into it and buddy A split buddy Bs head clean open with a cribbage board. I never saw so much blood in my life, and never saw buddy B again. No news on him, nothing. 

  The remainder of my sentence went by smooth enough, I got in shape, kept to myself, and read A LOT. I was eventually released on October 5th 2021. (If timelines don‚Äôt totally match up please bare with me as earlier events are recounted from a incredibly foggy time in my life‚Äîbut this date I‚Äôm sure of) I had been in rehabs prior to prison but not one of them had the affect prison had on me. I genuinely believe without this experience I would‚Äôve never got my shit together and would‚Äôve wound up dead in the backseat of a car and discarded on the street somewhere like an empty coffee cup. 

  But on the other hand, it took such an incredibly large part out of me. The spark I had for life was no more. I felt like the world was cold and miserable place. Despite this, I still refrained from old habits, got a job I truly enjoy. Began to build my credit up. Found love again for hobbies I use to enjoy such as fishing, working on cars, feeding birds. I slowly began to regain meaningful fulfillment in life and felt like things were trending up. Now fast forward 3.5 years later and I feel like I‚Äôve just stalled out so to speak. I have a job I enjoy and get along really well with all my colleagues, I have a nice car that I take out as a Sunday driver, I have a beautiful 1.5 old cane corso who I love like a child. I am incredibly fortunate and grateful to be healthy, able bodied and able minded. I try not to take things like that for granted everyday. But good lord am I lonely.

   I just don‚Äôt feel like I belong anywhere. Everyone I know has a crowd, a group of close knit friends that have meaningful relationships with one another. I see guys my age out in public with a beautiful family and I just think to myself, gosh how am I ever going to have that if I can‚Äôt even make a friend. I‚Äôve tried putting myself out there and even initiating interest in getting together outside of work with coworkers whether it be to go fishing or to a local music in the park, whatever, but I always get the obvious same old excuses, I speculate this is mostly due to my ability to properly articulate myself in social interactions at times. It‚Äôs weird, when it‚Äôs work related or even just normal banter I fair just fine, but when I do try to ask someone to hangout I get super hot, flustered, and fumble over my words. I suspect this could possibly be due to my subconscious correlating these social interactions back to the ones I became so accustomed to in prison. And I know it was only three years but it does not take very long to adapt to prison lifestyle due to being given no choice. 

  I also have a hard time connecting with my family. My older brother resents me and I resent him. (My brother himself is a completely different post) My Mother saw the worst of me, finding me completely lifeless without a pulse and unresponsive in my room due to a heroine overdose before prison. She had to drag my body into the hallway and wait for EMTs to arrive and try to resuscitate me. This was the second time she saw paramedics in her home within a year, the first was for my father who passed due to cardiac arrest in his sleep. 

  I also believe this could be part of my problem with social anxiety. According to paramedics that were still waiting to see if I‚Äôd make it at the hospital, I was told once I was conscious that my heart stopped and my brain had gone without oxygen for several minutes. I was losing almost all color when they arrived. From this moment on my mother has never looked at me the same way. I love her dearly and I know she loves me the same, but our interactions are mundane and far and few between. I have no resentment towards anyone or anything that has happened to me. It‚Äôs all apart of my story and I‚Äôm very grateful to still with all of you fine redditors today. 

  I guess I‚Äôm just curious if there‚Äôs anyone else out there that has had similar experiences whether it be the same or completely different circumstances. Any and all advice is appreciated.

The ashen-white venlil sighed and leaned back into her computer chair, nursing her coffee cup slightly with a swirling motion as she eyed the movement of the dark liquid. The tether being successful at all was supposed to be exciting, and yet‚Ä¶  
  
‚ÄúZisha told me you were bolting towards the computers as soon as the notification went off, and here I find you looking like a sad puppy instead.‚Äù A human walked in far more leisurely than she had, the venlil only giving her colleague an ear-flick of silent acknowledgement. ‚ÄúTether failed again, then?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo, it succeeded this time, but‚Ä¶‚Äù the venlil glumly looked up at the blinking screens, each bar of probability wavering only slightly as each second of recorded time passed. ‚ÄúNothing too special popped up.‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúWell, weren‚Äôt you the one absolutely *boring* us with the explanation that tethers don‚Äôt latch at the time of continuity variation the day we were assigned to this?‚Äù The human offered her an encouraging smile. ‚ÄúYou should be happy it‚Äôs getting a little exciting, eh?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúMaybe, but it‚Äôs still only in beta.‚Äù She countered, rubbing the bridge of her nose with her paw. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not out of the woods just yet.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll leave you to it. Have fun staring at screens for the next few hours. Call me if you need anything, yeah?‚Äù  
  
She made a grunt of affirmation as she watched her colleague depart out of her peripheral and down the hall. Returning her focus entirely to the computer statistics, she let out a groan and pulled herself forward to the keyboard, typing the short and simple beginnings of the report that would probably stay blank for the foreseeable future.¬†

**Memory Transcription Subject: Governor Tarva of the Venlil Republic**  
  
*Date: \[Standardized Human Time\] June 12th, 2136*  


I couldn‚Äôt help but release the hold I had on my breath in relief as I watched the Odyssey leave the atmosphere. It would take some getting used to being around the predators, even if I knew that their intentions were genuine. My nerves were just about ready to collapse inward on themselves knowing the amount of damage control I would have to be working on in the coming *months,* the prospect that I may have just doomed my people not because of any human trickery, but from the retaliation of the Federation, and on top of counting casualties of the stampede that happened on the humans‚Äô arrival all culminated into the need to just sit down and take a breather for even a sliver of a claw. Though admittedly, I wish I would have been given the grace of a few paws‚Äô worth.   
  
As expected, as soon as I returned to my office and heaved another sigh in my chair, an assistant had suddenly rushed in, giving both myself and Kam, who had followed me, a respectful flick of the tail, though anxiously paced in place, eyes riddled with newfound anxiety. I couldn‚Äôt help but dip my head slightly in disappointment as I spoke, ‚ÄúThe humans are gone. There‚Äôs no need to stir yourself up again, we should focus our efforts now on making sure the people are-‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not them!‚Äù He suddenly blurted out, quickly putting a paw over his mouth apologetically and composing himself as both Kam and I stared at him in shock at the interruption. ‚ÄúA-Apologies, Governor, but th-that‚Äôs not why I came to you. I-I am glad the humans are gone, b-but there‚Äôs something else.‚Äù As he stammered out his words he looked wildly between the two of us, and my heart sank. The only other time someone would warn me so urgently would be the arxur, and I had just threatened off our only means of defense. I felt my throat tighten and vision blur slightly.  
  
*No! Calm down. I need to stay calm. If it were an arxur attack, he would be far more erratic than he is right now.* Swallowing my fears, I motioned for him to continue. ‚ÄúShortly after the predators jumped into our system, w-we had picked up another anomaly. N-No one had noticed because we were so panicked about the humans appearing!‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúAnother one?‚Äù Well, at the very least, it wasn‚Äôt an arxur ship, though I noted Kam still tensed up beside me. ‚ÄúIs it another human ship?‚Äù  
  
The assistant flicked his tail in the negative. ‚ÄúNo. Not only did it not come from the same direction as they did, as it‚Äôs in a completely different region of the local space, it‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt even have any subspace trails at all. We‚Äôre not even sure it‚Äôs a ship.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWhat do you mean, you‚Äôre not sure?‚Äù Kam hissed through gritted teeth, agitation rolling off him in waves, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre lucky this oversight didn‚Äôt cost us, and you‚Äôre not even sure what it is?‚Äù  
  
The assistant shrank back at Kam‚Äôs aggression, answering swiftly, though a tremor returned to his voice. ‚ÄúW-Well, like I said, it left no subspace trails and‚Ä¶ it seemed to have disappeared after only a few seconds. We wouldn‚Äôt even know it had existed at all or still exists if the computers hadn‚Äôt made a record of it.‚Äù  
  
I felt a pit begin to form at the bottom of my stomach. For a moment I considered that we really *had* been tricked by Noah and Sara, though I held on to hope that I wasn‚Äôt wrong in protecting the two. I had to, because if I was wrong, then my entire species‚Äô blood would be on my paws. This‚Ä¶ ship, or whatever it was, indicated that something had entered and presumably exited our system with barely a whisper. I couldn‚Äôt let this go. It was nagging at me, nipping on my heels like a tiny vicious predator in its own right.  
  
After a moment of silence as I weighed our options, I finally spoke. ‚ÄúKam, I want you to designate a team to look into this. I don‚Äôt want to risk it being a fluke when there‚Äôs a chance this‚Ä¶ *alleged* ship could be an enemy with technology we have yet to come across, be it arxur or‚Ä¶ or human. I want to keep an eye on that region in case it happens again, and if it does, we might be lucky enough to have someone actually see the brahking thing.‚Äù  
  
Flicking an ear in agreement, my general departed with the assistant in tow, allowing me a moment of solitude. I closed my eyes and allowed the temporary darkness to calm my anxieties. I prayed that maybe, just maybe, it was an *actual* error in the system, rather than the lie I had told Sovlin not too long ago. Things never were so simple, though. Whatever it was, I just hoped it wasn‚Äôt an indicator that my hope for humanity‚Äôs intentions wasn‚Äôt misplaced.

1ke72d3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ke72d3/how_can_i_stop_ruminatingstruggle_comprehending/,How can I stop ruminating/struggle comprehending how a parent can neglect their kid so badly,"I don't know if this is the right forum but I hope I can get some insight and moral support from people who can understand.

32f, divorced parents since I was around 2. They didn't end stuff amicably so I was the piggy in the middle with courts and mediations and unpleasantness. My mum is physically there if I called her in need but severely emotionally neglectful and then my dad is just a classic narcissistic with the physical unavailability to boot.

He remarried and had other children when I was about 5 or so and his new wife treated me like the inconvenient step child in the way of her life. He never noticed (willingly likely) and on the 3 hours a week I would see him he would be in his office working or insisting I hang out with his wife and her family and ""be a family"" instead of maybe taking those few hours and focusing on some 1:1 time with me.

That's skimming the surface but eventually after my senior year of HS I stopped going to visit. After years of the same shit I was miserable and felt truly disregarded and unwanted and had severely poor self esteem and mental health challenges unsurprisingly.

In my 20s I had reached out a few times and we did the very awkward/surface coffee shop rekindle catch up which I tried to explain to him how shit I felt about our relationship and my treatment from his wife and her family and I was dismissed and pretty gaslit about how I must have imagined things because I was a very sensitive child and didn't give them a fair chance, etc etc.  

Anyway it was years of these quarterly soul crushing catch ups, infrequent text messages on special occasions and when I freshly fell pregnant with my first kid I decided to send him a pretty hefty and blunt text, all the things I didn't have the safe place to say in person and essentially ended things with a ""you don't need to reply in fact I'd prefer it. You were never a proper parent to me and I deserved better. Let's just leave this relationship in the ground where it belongs.."" I'm paraphrasing but that was basically the essence. I was very hurt and had just reached the point of I guess wanting to have some control in the situation and wanted to clear my headspace for my pregnancy.

I blocked him right after the text was sent and sort of felt a type of way a few months later so unlocked him. Despite my message I guess I still had that curiosity to see if he would bother fighting for me or if I was warranted in cutting ties. Anyway it's been 3 years nearly and it's been crickets. I've since had my child. I know for a fact he would know about it too..

After becoming a parent I won't bore you with the severity of emotional difficulties I faced but in context of this post - it really fucking emphasised how SHIT a human one must be to not give a fuck about their own kid. I couldn't imagine ever making my kid feel how I did. I thought after I had my own family and my own child I wouldn't have the capacity to care about him. But it's annoyingly made me feel more triggered and in disbelief how he could let this relationship fail so miserably. If I was him, as a parent myself, I couldn't function if my kid and I had the lack of relationship like he and I. Seeing him be completely fine and seemingly gallivanting and living it up (yes I've talked on socials) is like another kick to the gut too. Like... You should be in a ball curled up not functioning thank you very much.

I thought I had made peace and created closure for myself when I cut ties but after becoming a parent it's opened up old wounds.

TLDR: I don't want to care as much as I do. Solidarity or tips and tricks to stop caring *as much* would be truly appreciated. Thank you ",2,1746317720.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

Phoebe smirked from across the table. ‚ÄúOh, he knows exactly what she means. Come on, Ross, you‚Äôve been starry-eyed since you met Emma at that bookstore.‚Äù

Joey dramatically sighed, tossing a sugar packet onto the table. ‚ÄúLook at him. Poor guy. Lost in love, doomed to never recover.‚Äù

Chandler, who had been stirring his tea absentmindedly, chimed in. ‚ÄúExcept, buddy, it is that serious. You asked me for advice on ‚Äòthe perfect first date.‚Äô Which means you actually care.‚Äù

As the night unfolded, the group‚Äôs conversations shifted between teasing, advice, and their own romantic dilemmas. Joey had been caught in an accidental love triangle, Phoebe was convinced her latest date had been flirting with their waitress, and Rachel kept pretending she wasn‚Äôt catching feelings for someone new.

Between the laughter and coffee, Ross realized something‚Äîlove wasn‚Äôt just about grand gestures or perfect first dates. It was about knowing that somewhere in the chaos, someone was looking at you the way you looked at them.

1ke6wmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ke6wmz/cmv_drinking_alcohol_is_an_intellectually_poor/,CMV: Drinking alcohol is an intellectually poor decision,"What‚Äôs the logic in drinking poison for short-term pleasure? I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs once a year, how can you tell me someone deliberately sipping harmful chemicals and literal poison like ethanol for fun isn‚Äôt making an intellectually poor choice.

I want to preface this so I don‚Äôt sound like a hypocrite. I‚Äôve had my fair share of weed and alcohol. You don‚Äôt need a bottle of alcohol to be social, have fun, or be interesting. People have been so indoctrinated into believing that drinking is the key to socializing, when in reality, you can connect, enjoy yourself, and have meaningful interactions without relying on a bottle of poison to artificially boost yourself.

One of the most common excuses I hear is ‚Äúonly in moderation.‚Äù That could be true for some, but generally speaking, is moderation probable when it comes to substances designed to be addictive? Your brain doesn‚Äôt care about your intentions, it just responds to stimulus. Moderation sounds like another form of justification.

Another excuse people make is comparing alcohol to junk food, coffee, or sunlight. But they‚Äôre nowhere near equal. Junk food rewards you with energy and fulfills a  survival mechanisms. Sunlight is literally required for survival. Coffee has been shown to offer several health benefits. But alcohol? It‚Äôs designed to poison you. And research has consistently shown that no amount of alcohol is actually good for you, not even moderation.

It‚Äôs an intellectually poor decision when you can do almost everything it offers without ever touching it. Further proving that the trade off is objectively unequal. 

Sure, I understand if someone‚Äôs addicted and it‚Äôs hard to quit. That‚Äôs different. Those few hours may be enjoyable, but it‚Äôs crazy to think they‚Äôre worth poisoning your body for. You can have fun and enjoy life without it. A lot of people are living proof of that.

Ethanol is considered both a poison and a toxin, and yet people wonder how they end up with all types of cancers and deteriorated health from alcohol. I hear some justify it with ‚ÄúWe all die‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou can die anytime.‚Äù Sure, but there‚Äôs a huge difference between an accident and deliberately sipping poison especially when you can do almost everything it offers without touching it. That car accident or random accident people fear? It may never happen. Using those excuses to justify is nothing more than Stockholm syndrome: Defending what‚Äôs damaging you financially, mentally, and physically.

1ke6rv1,https://i.redd.it/6hepppggonye1.jpeg,"Rating the worst restaurants in Reno, #4. Cafe Central in the Silver Legacy.","I've been getting busier and busier. Attended Neotropolis last week, wrapping up college and moving back home to Vegas in less than a month. 

However, I never forgot about you.


Here's number 4 in the entry of worst rated restaurants. 
From previous entries
3. The Grand Buffet. 3 stars on yelp, 3.8 on Google. I believe I gave it a 3. 
2. The Grand Cafe, 2.5 on yelp, 3.2 on Google. I also believe I gave it a 3.
1. King Buffet, 2 stars on yelp, 3.2 on Google, and I also gave them a 3. 

Finding this spot was pretty rough, honestly. I feel like the casinos are built like mazes here. Once I got settled I decided to do breakfast since it was my first meal. I was going to rate it 3 stars for being expensive, but after digging around their prices are actually comparable to Denny's. Why the hell is food so pricy in general? I feel like $30 for one person to get breakfast is a lot, but I can't really fault the silver legacy for this. 

Food wise, the quality of the omelette and hash browns was standard diner quality. Like IHOP or Denny's. My toast actually had butter dripping off of it so I thoroughly enjoyed that. (Can't ever have too much butter!) They give you a carafe of coffee and a cute little thing of cream, so that's nice. I think I'm going to give them 3.5 stars, because they didn't really wow me but I didn't really have complaints. Either I'm too harsh with my ratings or too soft. Who knows? I might change my ratings for other restaurants like the Grand Cafe to a 2-2.5 for how dry my burger was or the Buffett to a 2.5 for being excessively expensive, but eh, it's in the past now. King Buffet will stay at a 3 because $16 to shovel low quality Chinese food in your mouth is always a win. 

I definitely won't go back to the silver legacy to eat, simply because I don't feel like walking over there and making my way throughout the restaurant. If I was gambling there for some reason and was hungry, it definitely wouldn't be the worst thing to eat. 


Only got a few weeks left in Reno, so I'll make sure to do redditor's choice. For this week I added the previous week's votes and any comments adding in why a restaurant would be considered bad. I may of double counted but I gave it a reasonable effort to not too for a silly reddit series. Here's the tallies. 

Juicys off Glendale at 9.
Wing King at 6.

I can‚Äôt see the kid clearly but from the top he looks roughly the same size as mine. Only two other parents around both glued to their phones.

Him to stop spitting or you‚Äôll tell his parents‚Äù

They come back again. Still spitting. Now the kid gives off a massive scream (mine are nowhere near), high pitch, just annoying. One of the parents looks up from his phone and says ‚Äúwas that yours or mine‚Äù. I say ‚Äúboth of mine are right there and I think yours is spitting on them‚Äù.

1ke6lji,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ke6lji/advice_for_europe_2025/,Advice for Europe 2025,"Hello,
 
I‚Äôm wondering if anyone could give me any ideas for an upcoming trip to Europe in August 2025.
 
I‚Äôm a mid-40s Canadian woman.  I‚Äôve travelled to over 40 countries, a lot of that travel was solo, so I‚Äôm pretty comfortable travelling on my own.  In my 30s I lived in eastern Europe, and during that time I travelled to England, Scotland, Hungary, Austria, Switzerland, Romania, Barcelona, Copenhagen, Amsterdam and Prague.
 
Last year I travelled to London, Paris, Brussels, Ghent and Bruges. In Paris I loved walking around the city, stopping into heritage sites, churches, the Louvre, picnics in the parks, coffee on terraces, and drinking wine by the canals with Parisians.  In London I loved the British museum, the old buildings contrasted with modern architecture, and going to plays and musicals.  I adored Ghent and Bruges for their magical fairytale city centres.  I felt like I could take or leave Brussels. 
 
My favourite things when I travel are long walks, architecture, cultural sites, vegetarian restaurants, picnics in parks, museums, markets, shows / concerts / plays.  I don‚Äôt drive, which can limit my ability to get to more remote areas, but I‚Äôm generally happy to take a bus or train and explore the cities or towns that I can access by transit. 
 
This summer I will be meeting up with friends in Munich, where we will rent a car (they will be doing the driving.)  We‚Äôll be travelling though Slovenia and Croatia for a couple weeks, then they will drop me off in Stuttgart, where I will have up to two more weeks to travel on my own.  Even though I loved almost all the parts of Europe I‚Äôve visited so far,  I‚Äôd rather not go somewhere I‚Äôve already been.  I would like to see something new, but I‚Äôm having a hard time making a plan. 
 
I was thinking of staying in Germany, and checking out Frankfurt, Berlin, Nuremberg and Munich, but the more research I do, the less excited I am about this plan.  The more I look into Germany the more it seems like the most interesting / beautiful areas cannot be reached by transit (alps, medieval towns, national parks.) The cities that I can reach easily by train seem to be just‚Ä¶ well big cities.  I‚Äôve been watching travel videos of Frankfurt and Berlin, and they just seems kind of‚Ä¶ meh? 

Does anyone have any suggestions on where to travel for two weeks, easily accessible by transit from Stuttgart, for a solo woman?  Or suggestions about my German itinerary that might encourage me to stick to that plan?

1ke6jwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/comments/1ke6jwp/theres_a_woman_who_lives_inside_the_walls_of_my/,"There's a woman who lives inside the walls of my gallery. For fifteen years, she's been knocking against the marble, attempting to deliver a message I couldn't decipher - until last night. Now, I understand.","I‚Äôve always felt profoundly relieved to put that burning city behind me. Move past the death and destruction. Divide myself from the ash and the ruins, the rust-colored clouds and the blood-orange sky. Out of sight, out of mind.

Towering steel doors swung shut as I stepped into the gallery.

I sighed, allowing my shoulders to sag as I slowly twisted my neck. Left to right, right to left. The A/C hummed, and its crisp, mechanical breath crawled over my exposed skin. My body cooled. The muscles in my neck began to unwind.

This was my sanctuary. The last building standing. A great marble raft drifting above an ocean of rubble.

I couldn‚Äôt let myself completely relax, though.

Yes, the gallery was safer than the inferno outside its walls. Much safer. But it came with its own risks.

Because it wasn‚Äôt just *my* sanctuary: I shared the refuge with one other person. Unlike me, she never seemed to leave. She usually wasn‚Äôt visible when I entered, but she was always there.

If I couldn‚Äôt see her, that meant she was in the walls. If she was in the walls, she'd be knocking her forehead against the marble. She didn‚Äôt have any knuckles, so the woman made her skull an instrument.

Same pattern every time, measured and deliberate.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

The knocks were gentle, but the sound carried generously through the cavernous studio floor. It was a single box-shaped room with thirty-foot tall ceilings and not a lot in between. Each wall held a few paintings from artists of no renown. There was a spiral staircase in the center, but the sixty-eight metal steps led to nowhere, abruptly stopping two-thirds of the way up.

And most cryptically, there was the elevator. Directly across from the entrance. No buttons to call the damn thing. The outline of a down arrow above the doors I‚Äôd never seen flash. No one ever came out, and I knew no one ever would, either.

The elevator was a one-way trip, constructed for me alone. Wasn‚Äôt ever sure how I knew that, but I‚Äôd bet my life on its truth twenty times over.

So, there I‚Äôd be: by myself on the gallery floor, that snake of a woman slithering through its walls, surrounded by an empty, burning city for miles in every direction. It would always start with me approaching the massive steel doors, waves of heat galloping over my back, but when it would end was variable. It could take minutes, it could take hours. On rare occasions, it could take days or weeks.

Eventually, though, I‚Äôd wake up.

The same inscrutable dream, every night without fail, for over fifteen years. A transmission from the depths of a hollow reality that I never understood until last night.

***My Birth:***

Ever since I can remember, I‚Äôve felt out of place. An outsider among my own species. I‚Äôm sure a lot of people experience a similar pariah-hood, and I obviously can‚Äôt confirm my lived experience is distinct or extraordinary in comparison.

Let me provide an example - some objective proof of my otherness.

As soon as I drew a first breath, my mother‚Äôs heart stopped. Spontaneous cardiac arrest, no rhyme or reason. An unceremonious end, like the death of an old car battery. The medical team leapt into action. A few does of IV adrenaline later, the muscle wearily returned to duty.

But the moment her heart restarted, mine then stopped. Then they‚Äôd resuscitate me, only to have my mother die again. So on and so on.

The way my dad used to tell it, the doctors became incrementally more unnerved and bewildered each time we flipped. Life was a zero-sum game in that operating room: it was me or her, decreed God, or the reaper, or whatever unknowable divinity would be in charge of such a cosmic oddity. The uncanny tug-of-war would have probably been amusing to witness if the implications weren‚Äôt so deeply tragic.

Three or four cycles later, my mother‚Äôs heart gave out completely. Obstinately refused to beat, no matter what the medical team did. Dad would sometimes theorize that was an active decision made by the doctors that handled her care, even if they didn‚Äôt have ‚Äúthe balls‚Äù to admit it. 

Like once they realized that one of us was dying, they arbitrarily awarded me with life. Started covertly injecting saline into my mother‚Äôs veins instead of adrenaline or something. 

I doubt that last part actually happened. The circumstances were just viciously unfair, and that type of thing is fertile soil for growing conspiracy. Regardless, I felt his pain.

See, that‚Äôs the rub. Although I‚Äôve always felt like an outsider, that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôve lacked empathy. I have reverence for the people around me. I‚Äôve just never felt *connected* to any of them. I‚Äôm like a naturalist living alone in the jungle. I love the flora and the fauna. I respect the miracle that nature represents. But at the end of the day, I‚Äôm still alone.

Which brings me to Anthony.

\- - - - - 

***My Childhood:***

I experienced a fair amount of bullying as a kid, probably became a target on account of my quiet nature and my social isolation. A lone gazelle straying too far from the safety of the herd. They didn‚Äôt much bother me, though. I just couldn‚Äôt see them as predators: more like flies buzzing around my head. Noisy and a smidge irritating, but ultimately harmless.

That was the problem - they *wanted* to feel like predators, and I wasn't providing the sensation. Inciting fear and misery made them feel in control. So, when they couldn‚Äôt get a rise out of me with their routine arsenal of schoolyard mockery, things escalated.

And every time a new prank was enacted - a carton of milk spilled over my head, a few spiders dumped into my backpack, etc. - I would notice Anthony watching from the sidelines, livid on my behalf. Tall for his age, frizzy black hair, blue eyes boiling over with anger behind a pair of thick square glasses.

One afternoon, Austin, a dumber and more violent breed of bully, became fed up with my relative disinterest. Decided to take the torment up a notch. He snuck up behind me while I was eating lunch, stuck a meaty fist into my bun, and yanked a thick chunk of hair from my scalp.

That was certainly my line in the sand. It was Anthony‚Äôs too, apparently.

I spun around. Before he could even gloat, I lunged forward, opened my jaw, and bit down hard on his nearest elbow. At the same time, Anthony had been running up behind him with a metal lunch tray arched over his shoulder. The shiny rectangle connected to Austin‚Äôs temple with a loud clatter, almost like the ringing of a gong.

It was a real ‚Äúone-two‚Äù punch.

An hour later, Anthony and I had our first conversation outside the principal‚Äôs office, both waiting to be interrogated.

I‚Äôve never been quite comfortable with the way he looked at me, even back then. His grin was too wide, his focus too intense. On the surface, it was an affectionate expression. But there was something dark looming behind it all: a possessiveness. A smoldering infatuation that bordered on obsession.

I tried to ignore it, because I genuinely did like him. As a friend. He was the only one I felt comfortable confiding in. The only person who knew of the gallery and the burning city, other than myself.

Now, there‚Äôs no one else.

This post is designed to fix that.  

\- - - - - 

***The Gallery:*** 

‚Äú*Ide conquers the Tarandos‚Äù* was my favorite. (The first word is pronounced *e-day*, I think.)

It wasn‚Äôt the largest painting in the gallery, nor was it the most technically impressive. There was just something bewitching about the piece, though. I found myself hopelessly magnetized to it for hours every night.

One foot long, about half a foot tall, with a frame composed of small, alternating suns and moons carved into the wood. It depicted a single-armed Valkyrie, with white wings and dull gray armor, lying on her back under the shade of a willow tree. A creature with the body of a man and the head of a stag is descending on her. Its face is contorted into a vicious snarl, arms outstretched with violent intent. The beast seems unaware of the serrated dagger in the Valkyrie‚Äôs singular hand, tenting the skin on the right side of its neck, about to draw blood. 

Oil paint lended the scene a striking vibrancy. The grass appeared lush, almost palpable. The hair on the beast‚Äôs knuckles looked matted and dense, like it was overflowing with grease.

Studying that canvas made me feel alive. More than I‚Äôve ever felt in the waking world, honestly. However, that invigoration would fade into unease the moment my eyes landed on the two black holes above the Valkyrie‚Äôs head.

Because they weren't some bizarre artistic choice.

They were holes - literally. 

Every painting in the gallery had a pair of them.

She liked to watch me look at the paintings every so often. 

When she did, two bloodshot eyes would intensely monitor my gaze. 

Sometimes, she'd watch for so long without blinking that tears would drip down the length of the piece. 

Eventually, the frame would tremble with her message.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

***My Adolescence:***

*‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the holdup, then? Just do it already,‚Äù* seventeen-year-old me proclaimed, unafraid and defiant.

The man in the ski-mask tilted his head. His glare dissipated. I stepped closer. The employee behind the counter stopped pulling bills from the register, eyes wide with disbelief.

*‚ÄúQuinn! What the fuck are you doing?‚Äù* Anthony hissed, cowering behind a nearby rack of chips.

I sniffed the air. Ran my fingers along the countertop while licking my lips. Surveyed my surroundings by turning my head and perked my ears for unusual sounds.

Smell, touch, taste, sight, hearing: I re-sampled them all. Everything was as it should be.

I felt my confidence balloon further.

*‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it, bitch‚Ä¶I‚Äôll s-shoot. I ain‚Äôt afraid. I‚Äôll s-splatter your guts across the fucking floor‚Ä¶‚Äù* the would-be criminal stuttered.

I stepped even closer. Close enough that the barrel of his pistol began digging into my chest.

*‚ÄúYeah, I heard you the first time, man.‚Äù*

I smiled, baring my teeth.

*‚ÄúSo, do it then. Look. I‚Äôm making it easy for you. Don‚Äôt even have to aim.‚Äù*

Like the flick of a switch, his demeanor changed. The gunman‚Äôs bravado collapsed in on itself, falling apart like paper mache in the rain.

Without saying another word, he sprinted from that CVS and disappeared into the night.

I flipped around so I could face Anthony, closed my eyes, and took an exaggerated bow. He wasn‚Äôt applauding. Neither was the flabbergasted kid behind the cash register, for that matter.

But I sure as shit pretended they were.

I was damn proud of my little parlor trick. Later that night, though, I‚Äôd ruin the magic. Anthony was insistent. Just wouldn‚Äôt let it go. 

He wore me down.

So, I told him that didn‚Äôt experience any synesthesia. That meant we were safe. No one in that convenience store was going to die. My performance was just a logical extrapolation of that arcane knowledge.

No one was going to die relatively soon, anyway.

\- - - - - 

My first dream of the burning city and the gallery came the night of my eleventh birthday. My ability to sense approaching death came soon after.

Synesthesia, for those of you unaware, is a neurological condition where the stimulation of one sense becomes involuntarily translated into the language of another sense.

But that probably sounds like a bunch of medical blather, so let me provide you with a few examples:

*The man tasted loud.*

*The apple felt bright.*

*The musical note sounded purple.*

You get the idea. It‚Äôs like nerves getting their wires crossed.

For a whole year before his death, my grandfather looked salty. His apartment smelled quiet. His voice sounded circular. And all of those queer sensations only became more intense as his expiration date approached.

I eventually picked up on the pattern.

Once I grasped the bounds of my extrasensory insight, death lost its hold over me.  You see, death draws a lot of its power from anticipation. People don‚Äôt like surprises, especially shitty ones. Nobody wants to be startled by the proverbial monster under the bed. I, however, had become liberated.

I could feel death‚Äôs advance from miles away, therefore, I had nothing to fear. Nothing at all. 

At least, that‚Äôs what I *used* to believe when I was young and dumb. Unfortunately, there are two major flaws in my supposed invulnerability that I completely swept under the rug. You may shouting them at your computer screen already.

1) Just because I could sense death didn‚Äôt mean I was shielded from the tragedies of life.

2) I didn‚Äôt know for certain that I could sense *everyone‚Äôs* death. There‚Äôs one person in particular who would be unverifiable by definition.

How could I be sure that I was capable of sensing my own death coming, if I had never died before?

***The Gallery:***

The night of my twelfth birthday, she finally revealed herself.

She finally came out.

There was a crack aside the elevator, no larger than the size of a volleyball. It was impossible to see what laid beyond that crack. Its darkness was impenetrable.

The woman wriggled out of that darkness and slithered towards me.

She had somehow been reduced to just a head with a spinal cord lagging behind it, acting as her tail.

Her movements were distinctly reptilian, rows of vertebrae swinging side to side, creating U-shaped waves of rattling bones as she glided across the marble floor.

I couldn‚Äôt see her face until she was only a few feet away. Long, unkempt strands of gray hair obscured her features, wreathing them behind a layer of silver filaments like the blinds on a window.

There was a crater at the center of her forehead. A quarter-sized circle of her skull had been completely pulverized from the incessant knocking.

She twirled around my leg, spiraling up my torso until she was high enough to drape her spinal cord over my shoulders.

Then, we were face to face, and she spoke the only eight words I‚Äôve ever heard spill from her withered lips until last night.

*""Are*

*You Ready*

*To See What Is*

*Below?""*

I shook my head. She looked disappointed.

Then, I woke up. 

Three hundred and sixty-five days later, she‚Äôd wriggle out from the crack again to ask me the same question.

Year, after year, after year.

***My Early Twenties*** 

In order for you to understand what transpired over the last twenty-four hours, I need to explain me and Anthony‚Äôs falling out.

The summer before I went away to college, he arrived at my doorstep and professed that he was in love with me. Had been for a long time, apparently.

His speech laid out all the gory details: how he believed we were soul mates, how perfect our children were going to be, how honored he was to get to die by my side.

Note the language. It wasn‚Äôt that he believed we *could* be soul mates, or that our children *could* be perfect. No, that phrasing was much too indefinite. From his perspective, our future was already sealed: written in the stars whether I liked it or not.

I tried to ease him back to reality gently. Reiterated the same talking points I‚Äôd harped on since he hit puberty.

Romantic love wasn‚Äôt in the cards for me. I was incapable of experiencing that level of connection with anyone. It had nothing to do with the value of him as a person or as a potential mate. My rejection wasn‚Äôt a judgement.

He wouldn‚Äôt hear it. Instead, he accused me of being a ‚Äústuck-up bitch‚Äù through bouts of rage-tinted sobs. I was going to college and he was staying in our hometown to take a job at his father‚Äôs factory. That must be it, he realized out loud. I didn't feel like he was good enough for me. He lacked prestige. 

I think I responded to those accusations with something along the lines of:

*‚ÄúListen, Anthony, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm better than you. It‚Äôs not like that at all. We‚Äôre just different. Fundamentally different. I‚Äôm sorry, but that‚Äôs never going to change, either. Not for you and not for anyone else.‚Äù*

In retrospect, maybe I could have selected cleaner verbiage. In the heat of the moment, I don‚Äôt think he took the words as I intended.

From there, Anthony hurled a chair through my house‚Äôs living room window, stomped out the front door, and exited my life for a little over five years.

\- - - - - 

***Current Day***

Fast forward to last week.

I returned to my hometown from my apartment in the city due to the death of my father, something I‚Äôd began feeling inklings of two years ahead of time. After the funeral, I‚Äôve focused on getting his estate in order, only venturing down onto main street once in the seven days I‚Äôve been here. The coffee machine broke, and I was in dire straits.

And who do I just so happen to run in to?

Anthony.

Honestly, I barely recognized him. He was no longer sporting a lanky frame, frizzy black hair, and thick bottlecap glasses. His body was muscular, almost Herculean. He slicked his hair back, varnishing it with some hideously pungent over-the-counter male beauty product. He no longer wore glasses now that he was able to afford a LASIK procedure - cured his shortsightedness for good.

I couldn‚Äôt detect the same darkness behind his eyes anymore, but that wasn‚Äôt because something purged it from his system.

He‚Äôd just gotten more proficient at hiding it.

\- - - - - 

Last night, we went out for dinner and a drink. Platonically. I made that exceptionally transparent from the get-go. He teased me in response, inquiring whether my boyfriend in the city would come ‚Äúkick the shit out of him‚Äù if he heard I was out with an ‚Äúold flame‚Äù.

For what felt like the millionth time, I explained to Anthony that I wasn‚Äôt interested in that type of connection. Thus, I was single.

That made him smile.

Inevitably, he invited me back to his apartment. He was very proud of his lucrative new position in his company and the luxuries that came with it, and he wanted to show off.

I almost reminded him that it wasn‚Äôt *his* company. It was his father‚Äôs company. To avoid conflict, I held my tongue.

It might sound insane that I agreed to his invitation. Like I said, he concealed his darkness well. Anthony may have grown up to be a bit of a tool, but he was still the only person I ever felt close with. I was genuinely interested in seeing how his life had turned out.

I wasn‚Äôt experiencing *any* synesthesia around him, either. To me, that indicated relative safety: no one was going to die. If he tried something lecherous, an act of depravity that may not necessarily inflict death, well, that‚Äôs what pepper spray is for.

Anthony lived in a two-story brick row home on the outskirts of town. I walked in the door and was greeted by a tiny entrance nook followed by an extensive set of stairs, which led up to his ostentatious foyer-slash-entertainment room.

I won‚Äôt lie - it was impressive. That was the point, I think. His home was just a big, glossy distraction: something to keep your attention away from the bedeviled man who lurked within. Barely even noticed him tapping on some home security dashboard to the right of the front door.

I do remember hearing the heavy click of a motorized lock, though. 

At that point, I was already walking up the stairs. 

\- - - - - 

For the next hour, we sat across from each on a massive leather sectional in his foyer, chitchatting over an additional glass of wine.

Eventually, though, enough was enough. 

I think he sensed I was preparing to excuse myself and go home, because he leaned over, grabbed one of five stout candles off of the coffee table, and began lighting the wick with a box of matches he pulled from his blazer pocket.

I told Anthony it was getting late, and that it was time for me to leave. He didn‚Äôt say anything. He didn‚Äôt react to the sentence at all. He just kept silently lighting the candles.

When I witnessed the reflection of the burning wick in his eyes, I realized I had made a mistake.

*Fine,* I thought. *I don‚Äôt need his permission to leave.*

He didn‚Äôt say anything as I darted past him, jogging down the stairs. I pulled the knob to the front door. 

It didn‚Äôt budge. There wasn't any obvious way to unlock it, either. 

*‚Äú‚Ä¶Anthony? Can you kindly help me unlock the front door?‚Äù* I called up, experiencing terror for the first time in years: a voracious chill eating its way through my chest

Nothing. No response. Not a peep.

Instead, the lights clicked off.

I felt a lump grow in the back of my throat.

Sweat poured over my temples.

I perked my ears. No footfalls. No sound. 

No synesthesias.

Just darkness oozing down that silent corridor: a lurching tidal wave of black tar moments away from swallowing me whole.

I reached into my purse for my cellphone.

Then - furious movement down the stairs.

The sound of heavy boots stomping on hardwood filled my ears. Before I could react, he was looming over me. An open hand exploded out from the shadows and hooked onto my blouse collar. With one forceful pull, he yanked me to the ground. The bridge of my nose crashed into the edge of a stair as I fell. Electric pain writhed and crackled over my sinuses. My mouth felt hot and boggy as he lugged back up to the foyer.

Anthony quickly pinned me to the floor in front of the coffee table. I thrashed and struggled, but it wasn‚Äôt much use. He had positioned one muscular knee on each of my elbows. I was trapped. 

Without uttering a word, he wrapped his meaty claws around my neck and squeezed.

The veins in his head pulsed, his face swollen with fury. I started to see double.

Consciousness liquefied and slipped through my fingertips.

I closed my eyes.

With the last few grains of life I had left, I thought of my favorite painting.

‚Äú*Ide conquers the Tarandos‚Äù*

I wanted to die with its beauty graffiti'd on the inside my skull.

Unexpectedly, there was the tearing of flesh and a soggy gurgle, followed by a few sputtering coughs.

Anthony‚Äôs hands released. Oxygen rushed into my starved lungs.

I opened my eyes.

A serrated dagger had been plunged into the soft flesh of his neck, skewering it completely. I saw a bit of the blade poking through on the other side. Dewdrops of blood and plasma seeped from the fatal wound, trickling over his collarbone and dripping onto my blouse. The scent of iron quickly coated the interior of my broken nose.

A hand still tightly gripped the dagger‚Äôs handle, but Anthony‚Äôs heavy knees had never left my elbows.

It wasn‚Äôt mine, but it came from me. I traced the ethereal limb from the knife to the center of my ribcage, where it had sprouted.

And it as swiftly as it appeared, the limb and dagger vanished. Before Anthony collapsed on top of me, I used my freed hands to push him off and to the side. He fell, hitting the coffee table as he tumbled. The resulting collision sent five burning candles crashing onto a large cotton blanket nearby. 

His foyer became a bonfire. 

I stood up, still weak and woozy from the prolonged suffocation. The sofa had caught flame too. Harsh black smoke began to diffuse throughout the apartment.

I raced down the stairs once again, but I reached a similar impasse.

The door remained mechanically locked. 

I screamed. Cried out for someone to hear me. Twisted the knob so hard that it tore the skin on my right palm. All the while, a conflagration bloomed behind me.

I shifted my attention to the digital security dashboard aside the door. I pushed my fingers against the keyboard. The device whirred to life. 

Four asterisks stood in my way. A PIN number was required to get to the home screen.

I tried my birthday, two digits for the month, two digits for the year.

Incorrect. A warning on the screen read *two attempts left*

I tried Anthony‚Äôs birthday.

Nothing.

*One attempt left.*

My panic intensified, reaching a fever pitch in tandem with the ravenous flames one floor above.

Then, I heard it. At least, I think I heard it. Maybe my mind just clicked into place, and the realization was so profound that it felt like the noise began physically swirling around me.

Yet, I distinctly remember hearing the knocking from within the wall behind me.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

I held my breath.

*1-3-4-2.*

The screen opened. 

I clicked *UNLOCK*, twisted the knob, pushed my body against the door, and spilled out onto the street.

***The Gallery:*** 

When I arrived last night, a few hours after Anthony died, something was different.

The woman slithered out from the crack and started moving towards me. I met her halfway, next to the spiral stairs.

She grinned at me from the floor.

For the first time, I asked *her* a question.

*‚ÄúWhy could I not sense that Anthony was going to die?‚Äù*

She glided up my leg, draping her spine over my shoulders so she could be eye-to-eye with me. When she spoke, her sentences lacked the *1-3-4-2* rhythmic structure I'd come to know her by. 

Her voice was high-pitched and raspy, and her mouth didn't actually move when she talked - she just kept it ajar and the words flowed out. 

*‚ÄúBecause he was never supposed to die last night.* ***You*** *were supposed to die last night. That‚Äôs what was written. You can‚Äôt foretell something that‚Äôs never been written.‚Äù*

Her grin became sharper at the corners of her mouth, rapturous and grim.

*‚ÄúBut I intervened. You‚Äôd never get to the gallery unless I did something about it. Took a lot of work and planning, but I did it.* ***We*** *did it.‚Äù*

Then it was her turn to ask me something.

*‚ÄúAre you ready to see what‚Äôs below?‚Äù*

I nodded.

Immediately, the down arrow above the elevator lit up bright red, and a chiming sound echo‚Äôd through the gallery.

The doors opened, and I gasped.

There was the headless body of a woman standing motionless inside the elevator, wearing a flowing silver dress. She held a balloon in her hand. The side of it read *‚ÄúHappy Birthday!‚Äù* in a rainbow of colors.

The woman's head and her spine slithered ahead of me. It scaled the decapitated body and inserted its tail into the dry flesh between the body's collar bones until the head was snuggly attached. 

I walked over and stepped in. The inside glistened, polished and reflective like a mirror. For the first time, I saw myself as I was within the gallery. 

I‚Äôd always assumed I was the same age in the waking world that I was in the dreams. But I wasn‚Äôt. I was much, much older.

And that revelation really got me thinking. 

Maybe the gallery has never been a dream. Maybe it‚Äôs been more of a premonition.

A vision of the future. The sight of a colossal, marble coffin towering above the ruins of an ever-burning city. An altar to the new gods of a new age. 

The woman‚Äôs newly fastened head turned to me and whispered,

*‚ÄúIf you wake up before we get there, that‚Äôs OK. You‚Äôre finally safe. We can try again every night without fear. Eventually, with enough practice, you‚Äôll make it over the apotheotic threshold. We can bring this all to fruition, my love, my one-armed Valkyrie, my deep red moon.*‚Äù

The smell was horrendous! It smelled very spicy. I did a couple of the most common suggestions for cleaning and getting rid of the smell. I soaked all the parts in vinegar/water mix for about an hour. I ran the moka pot through a brew of water/vinegar. I got replacement gaskets as the original gasket had the strongest spicy smell. 

I was able to get rid of the smell from most of the parts except for the bottom chamber. I am sure I am far from the few that have done this. What has worked for you guys? Maybe I am not soaking the bottom chamber long enough? Is citric acid better?

Between 2016 and now I‚Äôve made a few dozen trips back to NYC, and now that I‚Äôm more permanently back on UES, I‚Äôm finding that things aren‚Äôt what I once remembered.

For example, I got back from work at 1:30am last night.  I tried to order a slice of pizza and found pretty limited options on Seamless/GrubHub.  One place I ordered flat out cancelled, then other accepted the order and it never showed up; I had to contact support for a refund.  Is Seamless/GrubHub not the go to for delivery anymore?  Is late night pizza not as much a thing?

I used to live around 4-5 bodegas between 1st and 2nd Ave.  Now there‚Äôs two, one of which doesn‚Äôt seem to have anyone making food later at night and the other didn‚Äôt seem that clear when I wanted a chopped cheese.  That felt like it never used to be that tough to get.

I used to have a few choices of coffee carts near the subway when I‚Äôd head to work back in the day.  Either easy to get a coffee and roll with butter or an egg and cheese on a roll.  Now it feels harder to track down a food cart in the morning when they used to seem more abundant near the subway/offices.

Am I just in the wrong area?  Or is this just not the culture as much anymore?  I might be holding on to a relic from a decade ago now, but I‚Äôm curious if late night food, bodegas, food carts, are still as commonplace in NYC?",18,1746315364.0,AskNYC,50,0.64,False

But last night we ordered food from her favorite restaurant and ate together on the couch. This morning I made coffee and homemade waffles. She sat outside on her deck in the sun while I fixed up her bike. I found her gift for Mother's Day (that I bought months ago and thought I lost). She's walking around again and smiling again.

Javier here. Been burning the midnight oil coding and finalizing designs, and I'm stoked to share what's new:

Two brand new parametric, hardware-free CNC plans are now **LIVE** on turnifure.com:

* **Bed1:** Remember Project Bed? It's here! A super adjustable bed frame / puff base (go from 750x750mm up to a full US Twin!). Nestled onto a **single 4x8 sheet** and fully parametric in ModMaker for mattress width/length. Zero screws, max sturdiness.
* **Table3 - Curvy Grid Leg:** A modern base for your next coffee table project. Easily adapts to material thickness from 5.5mm plywood up to 19mm (3/4""). (More parameters like width/length adjustments are already in the works!)

**Also, some important platform news:**

I'm planning an evolution for the **Mods system**. The goal is fairer value. Soon, instead of just buying a generic Mod pack, you'll **Unlock** a specific model first (this will include some mods for that design). After that, you can buy much cheaper Mod packs to generate *more variations*, but only for models you've already unlocked.

**Crucially, for Maker's PASS subscribers: Absolutely NO CHANGES!** You still get unlimited access and unlimited generations for everything. üëç

Tomorrow I start my adventure. I‚Äôm a traveler and decided not to get a place and pay for rent back home. Short term dweller (<6 months) 

I‚Äôve taken out front seat and slept in my car a couple days in trial runs. Urinal testing. 

I have my blinds/reflective. I work night shift. So I‚Äôll be sleeping mostly during the day. 

Biggest issue:

CLOTHING. I still feel like I‚Äôm packing too much, but I wanted at least 2 weeks worth of clothes without having to wash. I have my scrubs (x3 sets‚Äîwork 5/week), chill/daily, pjs, and workout clothes. I‚Äôm a woman so I have panties, bras, sports bras etc. 

Q1: what‚Äôs your car closet essentials?

HUMIDITY. I have 2 fans. BUT MY GOD‚Ä¶THE MOISTURE sleeping is INSANE. Still working on it. But killed my generator in 2 days. 

Kills my hair, super FRIZZY. So I‚Äôm hoping to do some select hairstyles to keep me. 

Q2: How do you deal with your hair (curly)?

Planning/FOCUS:

Focus on mindset & working out, skin care, healthy eating (grocery store eating x2/day, 1 gallon of water/day) 

I plan to reside in libraries, coffee shops, Panera, parks (writing/studying/charging devices).

I have 2 memberships planet fitness & 24/7 WO (as the place my assignment‚Äîonly 24hr gym) 
I figure that should cover me. Shower x2 daily.

ROUTINE. I understand this is more of an in the moment. I struggle sometimes in life. But I‚Äôm hoping this will help me focus on what‚Äôs important. I‚Äôve recently started writing novels and short stories. To keep myself busy (long term career) and studying/ finishing last 2 pre-reqs for ABSN program I was accepted to. 

Q3: can you put your blinds up during your grocery store sittings while chilling in your car?

Any other tips?

It wasn‚Äôt about beauty or talent‚Äîthough Marla had both. It was about charm. Marla could smile her way out of anything, laugh her way into anyone‚Äôs good graces, and bend the world to her will with a pout and a raised brow. Their parents never saw it as manipulation. To them, Marla was ‚Äúconfident,‚Äù ‚Äúspirited,‚Äù ‚Äúdeserving.‚Äù

Lena, on the other hand, was the quiet one. The dependable one. The one who got overlooked.

When Lena brought Jonah home for the first time, her parents barely registered his presence‚Äîuntil Marla walked in wearing red and gave him that smile. The one Lena had seen destroy boyfriends, bank accounts, and best friends.

From that moment on, Lena knew she‚Äôd have to fight to keep what was hers.

But she didn‚Äôt think she‚Äôd have to fight her family.

It started small.

Marla would laugh too hard at Jonah‚Äôs jokes. Sit too close on the couch. ‚ÄúJust being friendly,‚Äù she‚Äôd say with a wink. Lena noticed Jonah shift awkwardly away, but never say anything. He was kind. Too kind.

Then Marla began showing up uninvited. At their apartment. At Lena‚Äôs work. Once, she ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù ended up at Jonah‚Äôs office with coffee and an old story about needing career advice.

Lena confronted her.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre crossing a line.‚Äù

Marla blinked, then smiled sweetly. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help it if people like me, Lenny. Maybe if you weren‚Äôt so insecure‚Ä¶‚Äù

It was the same tone she‚Äôd used since childhood. And it still worked. Lena left the room seething‚Äîand uncertain.

When she brought it up to her parents, they scoffed.

‚ÄúOh, Lena, don‚Äôt be jealous,‚Äù her mother said. ‚ÄúMarla just has a big heart.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs always been more outgoing than you,‚Äù her father added. ‚ÄúMaybe Jonah just enjoys her company.‚Äù

It hurt more than Lena expected.

Then came the weekend trip.

A family getaway at the lakeside cabin their father loved. Lena and Jonah had planned to stay in the main bedroom, but when they arrived, Marla had already claimed it‚Äîwith a suitcase twice the size of anyone else‚Äôs.

‚ÄúI thought I‚Äôd take the master since you two already live together,‚Äù she said, sipping wine like it was nothing. ‚ÄúSpread the wealth, right?‚Äù

Lena gave in, tired of arguing.

But that night, when she woke up to find Jonah missing from bed, she panicked.

She found him on the back porch, sitting stiffly in a chair while Marla leaned over him, whispering something in his ear. His eyes flicked to Lena. He stood up fast.

‚ÄúI was just‚Äîgetting air,‚Äù he said, too quickly.

Marla smiled.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be mad, Lena. He just needed some attention.‚Äù

Lena didn‚Äôt sleep the rest of the night.

The final straw came two weeks later.

A message.

From Marla.

To Jonah.

‚ÄúYou know we‚Äôd be better together. I can give you more than she ever will. Don‚Äôt you feel it? I do.‚Äù

Jonah didn‚Äôt respond.

Instead, he showed the message to Lena.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to believe it either. But she crossed the line.‚Äù

Lena‚Äôs hands shook as she read it.

And for the first time in her life, she didn‚Äôt go to her parents to explain. She printed the message. Brought it to dinner. Laid it on the table in silence.

Their mother read it. Her mouth opened, then closed.

Her father cleared his throat, awkward. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure she didn‚Äôt mean‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúShe did,‚Äù Jonah said quietly. ‚ÄúAnd you need to stop pretending she‚Äôs not capable of it.‚Äù

Marla arrived late, as usual, dressed like she‚Äôd walked out of a movie. She saw the paper. Smirked.

‚ÄúGuess the truth‚Äôs out,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNot my fault if your marriage is that shaky.‚Äù

Lena stood.

She looked her parents in the eye.

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt fight for your attention anymore. You can keep her. I‚Äôm done being the shadow in her spotlight.‚Äù

Then she and Jonah left.

Months passed.

Marla sent a few dramatic messages‚Äîhalf-apologies layered with excuses. Their parents called, asking her to ‚Äúbe the bigger person.‚Äù

Lena didn‚Äôt respond.

Instead, she lived.

She and Jonah moved to a new place, far from the family house. They built something quiet and real, where love wasn‚Äôt a competition and kindness didn‚Äôt come with a price.

Sometimes, Lena missed the idea of family.

But then she remembered:

Family doesn‚Äôt try to steal your life.

And then there‚Äôs the ***Solborne I***, which seems to have been *born* already crowned.

Sensor shadows out of the fringe caught a heat bloom so pure, so regular, someone flagged it as ‚Äúdivine.‚Äù Turns out it wasn‚Äôt a god‚Äîjust a Constellation explorer powered by something that might as well be one.

The *Solborne I* isn‚Äôt just a flagship‚Äîit‚Äôs a shrine in motion. Commissioned by the UC, blessed by Constellation, and rumored to be powered by a reactor that hums like it remembers the Big Bang. When they say ""deep space luxury,"" they don‚Äôt mean polished chrome and a coffee machine. They mean pre-Exodus myth carved into AI code. They mean a ship that purrs in Old Norse and burns like a theology thesis.

Solborne doesn‚Äôt just *chart* systems‚Äîit introduces itself to them like a noble entering a ballroom. Quiet hum. Perfect etiquette. And engines that could outrun their own reputation.

Its grav drive cuts 40-light-year wounds in spacetime without rattling your wine glass. The science bay is modular; the AI is solar. The rescue of the *Freya crew*? Real. But so is the suspicion that this ship wasn‚Äôt built for rescue‚Äîit was built for pilgrimage. And that *The Voice of Sol* doesn‚Äôt just speak to the crew.

But don‚Äôt take our word for it. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs echoing across the more‚Ä¶ opinionated comms:

‚ÄúIf the sun had a yacht and a god complex, this would be it.‚Äù

‚Äî **Cydonia Surveyor Union ‚Äì Internal Comms**

‚Äî **Archimedean Starworks**  
‚ÄúWho the hell gives an AI a god complex *on purpose*? Constellation, apparently. This is what happens when libraries run the fleet.‚Äù

‚Äî **The Well ‚Äì Basement Router Feed**  
*‚ÄúUC gives away that ship and suddenly I‚Äôm supposed to believe they‚Äôre not hiding something? Nah. Either it‚Äôs cursed or watching us back.‚Äù*

***‚Äî Constellation Transmission Feed, The Eye***  
*‚ÄúI swear it sounded like she sang to me. The ship. Not the pilot. Like a sunbeam wrapped in mourning.‚Äù*

***‚Äî Data Cubes, UC Central Repair Dock***  
*‚ÄúWho approved that core? I‚Äôve never seen a UC reactor vibrate at 1Hz flat. That‚Äôs not engineering. That‚Äôs ritual.‚Äù*

***‚Äî Encrypted Whisper, Offworld Monitor***  
*‚ÄúThe AI uses mythos as a language layer. Sure. But whose mythos now? Sol? Or something older? Ya, I‚Äôm looking at you Baltic-Madori.‚Äù*

Here's my wish list: 

1. Locally owned, so not someplace like a Starbucks
 
2. Comfy seating like couches or bean bag chairs. It seems like most coffee shops just have hard-backed chairs, so this seems to rule a lot of places out.

3. Somewhere that's open late. There are several cool coffee shops in the Montclair area near where I live, but most of them aren't open in the evenings.

4. Chill, laid back atmosphere. This probably sounds heretical in a post asking about coffee shops, but I'm actually not a huge coffee drinker, so I don't care about the quality of the coffee. I'm much more interested in the vibe of the place. So not somewhere that tends to be super crowded or noisy, plays loud music, or has really bright, clinical lighting. I'd much prefer a loungey sort of spot with dim lighting, decent internet, and maybe some good food or drinks (doesn't necessarily have to be coffee) while I work. Heck, it doesn't even have to be a coffee shop! I'd also be open to somewhere like a brewery or a wine bar, but I just I feel like it might seem weird to bring a laptop to a place like that. Whatever it is, I think I'm trying to stay away from places with table service, cause then I'll feel guilty working there for several hours.

Oh, life's a ride, a bumpy track,
Sometimes you fall, you land on your back.

We think we're great, the best in the land,
Ignoring the principles, close at hand.


First, Compassion, a fancy word,
Means don't just watch, when troubles are stirred.

Like when your friend trips, flat on their face,
Don't point and giggle, show some grace!


(Though a tiny snort is hard to fight,
Try to help them up, with all your might!)

Then Gratitude, a thankful sigh,
For coffee, sunshine, and pie in the sky.


Not just for mansions and pots of gold,
But for not tripping (a story untold... yet!).

Appreciate small things, like finding a sock,
That went missing for weeks, what a shock!


Ah, Humility, a tough one to chew,
When you think you're perfect, through and through.

That ego inflating, a hot air balloon,
Ready to pop, maybe by the moon?


Let it deflate, just a little bit,
Admit you're not perfect, and learn to just sit.

Forgiveness next, a bitter pill,
Holding a grudge? It just makes you ill!


That person who stole your favourite pen?
Let it go now, again and again.

Unless they stole your last slice of cake,
Then forgiveness is harder, for goodness sake!


Be Present, they say, right here, right now,
Not stressing 'bout dinner, or milking a cow.

Just feel the moment, the air, the light,
Don't scroll through your phone, day and night!


Unless you're reading this poem, of course,
Then scrolling is vital, a powerful force!

Non-Attachment, a breezy affair,
Things come and go, like your vanishing hair.


That brand new gadget, you thought you adored?
Soon it's forgotten, feeling ignored.

Let things flow freely, like a gentle stream,
Except maybe chocolate, that's a core dream!


Now Service, helping others, hooray!
Without expecting a thank-you display.

Hold open a door, or lend a kind ear,
Even if their story's your biggest fear.


Just don't offer help if you'll make things worse,
Like trying to fix plumbing, a watery curse!

Honesty, speaking the truth, so bold,
Even when fibs are more easily sold.


Tell your friend their new hat is a fright,
(But maybe add, ""You still look alright!"").

Living truthfully, day by day,
Though sometimes a white lie saves the day... right?


And finally, Faith, a trusting heart,
In something much bigger, right from the start.

Whether it's planets, or fate, or a star,
Believe in something, no matter how far.


It gives you hope, when things go wrong,
Helps you keep singing, your life's little song.

So there you have it, the principles bright,
To guide you towards living right.


It won't be easy, there'll be a stumble or two,
But try just a little, for me and for you!

Let's all acknowledge, with a comical grin,
It's time to start changing, right from within!

1ke5ozi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Appliances/comments/1ke5ozi/my_whirlpool_warranty_story/,My Whirlpool Warranty Story,"Around 2021 I purchased a brand new Whirlpool refrigerator. 10 months later I came home from being gone a couple days & my fridge was out. 90% of my food was already ruined & it was beginning to smell, due to the leaking liquids from all my thawed meat. 

I called Whirlpool & they told me they would get a ‚ÄúWhirlpool authorized‚Äù repair technician to my house to determine the cause, get this - in 10 days! I called the small local store I bought it from & they sent a local tech out at their expense to diagnose the problem. He determined the compressor had gone out. 

The store reached out to Whirlpool on my behalf, told them it had been diagnosed & tried to expedite the process. But Whirlpool refused to accept the diagnosis from a tech who was not ‚ÄúWhirlpool authorized‚Äù. So I had to wait the 10 days for their guy to come to my house. And sure enough, after 2 minutes he determined it was the compressor (shocking! üôÑ).

Now at this point even though I removed all of the food, the refrigerator smells like straight death & was clearly never going to be useable again. So I thought SURELY they would just replace it. Nope! They insisted on just replacing the compressor, which took another ~5 days to come in. 

So after 15 days without a fridge, & 17 days of things rotting inside the fridge, they replaced the compressor & told me their job was done. I asked what they recommended I do about the smell, since they took so long to fix it & they said to put some coffee grounds inside it & it would be fine. 

Meanwhile when I brought up the loss of ~$1,000 worth of food in my 10 month old fridge they told me it wasn‚Äôt their problem. 

Believe me when I tell you that I will NEVER buy another Whirlpool product, & I will ALWAYS take the opportunity to tell everyone my story. ",11,1746313595.0,Appliances,15,0.87,False

having the couch face the archway/dining room to improve the openness and possibly flow from the entryway despite the L part will be blocking that doorway I'm standing in (but it will be places with circulation space around it of course).
