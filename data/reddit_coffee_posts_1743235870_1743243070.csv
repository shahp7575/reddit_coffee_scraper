I was thinking of doing 4 no buy days a week. This doesn‚Äôt sound much but two are essential (weekly shop and weekly takeaway) that just leaves one day I can spend, does this sound realistic?

I've been struggling with my mother's behavior for the past couple of years, and it's only gotten worse. Lately, my mom has been very emotionally aggressive. She has her own version of reality, which is completely distorted, and she never takes responsibility for her words‚Äîit's never her fault. 

For some background: We have a small family business run by my father and now my brother. My mother helped build the company, but she never really worked full-time there. Instead, she would often go out shopping or meet friends during work hours. My dad never had an issue with this, especially now that my brother has taken over. She also never learned how to use a computer, so she has no clue what to do when a client makes a purchase. The only thing she‚Äôs really good at is consulting clients, and that‚Äôs about it. 

Now, onto the negatives. She hasn‚Äôt really had a goal in life lately. When we were kids, she was busy with us and our education. But after we moved out, she has had nothing meaningful to do during the day. She fixates on small problems and blows them out of proportion, turning them into a huge ordeal. She‚Äôs extremely direct‚Äîso much so that she can‚Äôt maintain friendships because she lacks diplomacy. She confuses being blunt with being honest. She has always been negative, but now it‚Äôs out of control. She‚Äôs constantly annoyed with my father and makes sure everyone knows it. In her eyes, all of her life problems are his fault. Despite having a very privileged life‚Äîconstant trips, sometimes expensive and far away‚Äîshe remains ungrateful. Honestly, I think my dad takes her on these trips just to keep her from bothering him. Her daily routine is exhausting to witness. She wakes up at 4 AM, spends hours on social media, then goes to the office just to drink coffee. By mid-morning, she naps for a few hours, claiming exhaustion from ""working so hard"" or citing nonexistent health issues. She wakes up moody, complains, bosses people around, and lashes out at my father and brother over trivial things. By evening, she‚Äôs back home, does no housework, spends more time on social media, and goes to bed early‚Äîonly to repeat the cycle the next day. 

My dad is frustrated by my mother‚Äôs lack of discipline. She doesn‚Äôt do much housework, and their home is a mess. Whenever he suggests hiring external help, like a cleaning service, she refuses, claiming she doesn‚Äôt trust them. Most of my parents' arguments stem from housework. Eventually, my dad loses patience and starts yelling because he can‚Äôt take it anymore. But then she turns it around, telling everyone he‚Äôs extremely aggressive and controlling. As a child, she would speak badly about my father, which made me feel a mix of fear and reluctant respect for him. Later, I realized he wasn‚Äôt as bad as she made him out to be‚Äîhe‚Äôs just a workaholic, while she simply doesn‚Äôt want to work. Now, she claims that we‚Äôve all teamed up with my dad against her, just because he has the money. 

She also insists that other men take care of their wives financially and that my dad is the only one who doesn‚Äôt. In reality, she receives around ‚Ç¨1,000 a month, which she spends on shopping‚Äîyet somehow, it‚Äôs still not enough for her. I‚Äôm honestly shocked at how someone can be so ungrateful for the life she has. Whenever we try to confront her about her behavior, we remain calm and attempt to give her advice. But the moment we do, she starts yelling and screaming, saying that we‚Äôre all against her, that we don‚Äôt love her, and that we hate her. She bursts into tears, and at that point, it‚Äôs impossible to continue the conversation. 

We‚Äôve been trying to convince her to see a therapist because her behavior is making everyday life extremely difficult. She creates drama over the smallest things and treats everyone with cynicism. I don‚Äôt want to be around her, but at the same time, I can‚Äôt just cut her off‚Äîshe‚Äôs my mother. The problem is, we can‚Äôt even have a normal conversation with her. If we try, she just insists that she‚Äôs ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù‚Äîbut in her mind, that means she‚Äôs quirky. I have never heard her take responsibility for her words, even when she was extremely rude to me, my brother, or even clients. She always has some kind of excuse or justification.

As a side note, my father isn‚Äôt perfect‚Äîhe has his flaws‚Äîbut compared to her, they‚Äôre minor. Honestly, I‚Äôm worried that she‚Äôs going to wear him down completely. With the constant stress she puts him under, I fear he might end up having a stroke.",1,1743242361.0,family,1,1.0,False

For those new to this trend, understanding the basics‚Äîsuch as flavors, strengths, and top product recommendations‚Äîcan make the experience more enjoyable. [Two Wombats](https://twowombats.com/), a trusted retailer specializing in nicotine pouches, offers a curated selection to suit every preference. This guide breaks down everything beginners need to know.

**Understanding Nicotine Pouches**

Unlike traditional snus, nicotine pouches are tobacco-free, containing nicotine extracted from plants along with flavorings and plant-based fibers. They are placed under the upper lip, releasing nicotine without the need for smoking or spitting. This makes them a convenient and socially acceptable option for users seeking an alternative to cigarettes or vaping.

Nicotine pouches come in varying strengths, measured in milligrams per gram (mg/g). Beginners should start low and gradually adjust based on their tolerance:

* **Low (2-6 mg/g)** ‚Äì Ideal for casual users or those transitioning from low-nicotine products.
* **Medium (8-12 mg/g)** ‚Äì A balanced option for moderate nicotine users.
* **High (14+ mg/g**) ‚Äì Best for experienced users with higher nicotine tolerance.

We both work from home and spend most of our time together. We don‚Äôt have kids. My husband doesn‚Äôt have many friends and rarely goes out aside from the gym, occasional visits to his parents, or meeting a friend for coffee. He‚Äôs supposed to go to the office once a week but barely does. I, on the other hand, work out twice a week, see friends and family at least once or twice a week, and go to the office every Tuesday.

Early in our relationship, my husband wanted us to share our locations ‚Äúfor safety reasons,‚Äù and I agreed. I also always tell him where I‚Äôm going and how long I‚Äôll be gone. That said, I‚Äôm not much of a texter‚ÄîI prefer in-person conversations. I‚Äôll usually send a text when I‚Äôm heading out to see someone, but I‚Äôm not glued to my phone.

The issue started when he began getting upset that I wasn‚Äôt texting him when I arrived at brunch with my girlfriends‚Äîeven though I‚Äôd already told him where I was going and he had access to my location. He never clearly explained why he needed that extra confirmation, but after arguing about it twice, I reluctantly agreed to text him when I arrive and when I leave. Now, if I forget, he gets mad.

The same thing happens on my office days. If I don‚Äôt text or call him throughout the day, he says he feels like he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù when I‚Äôm not with him. At first, he pressured me about it a lot, but I refused to entertain it. I spend nearly all my time with him‚Äîwhy is one day at the office without constant texts such a big deal?

Last Tuesday, we fought again. I spent the day at the office, then went to dinner with colleagues, and afterward went to a friend/colleague‚Äôs (36M) place to game and spend time with his wife and kids. He knew my entire plan in advance‚Äîwhere I‚Äôd be and when I‚Äôd be home. I even texted him at 10 AM, then again at 1:30 PM to ask if he wanted to call (we spoke briefly), and at 4:30 PM when he let me know he gave our cat his meds. From 4:30 to 8:00, I was at dinner and driving, then at 8:30 he texted me a picture of us, which I replied to right away. At 10:15, I texted ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù but got no response. At 11:29, I let him know I was heading home.

The next morning, he was mad that I didn‚Äôt call him when I arrived at my friend‚Äôs place. At this point, I don‚Äôt know what to do. I may not be a big texter, but he always has my location and knows my plans.

Scared I agreed to meet for coffee. I couldn't believe my eyes, you spoke to my soul, we would talk about nothing so long we'd lost track of the time.

The light in your eyes each time you would see me, made the butterflies in me try to explode continuously... the way you would hold me pulling me closer as you kissed me with such passion literally took my breath away and made everything else fade away. You were my best friend and you made me feel love in a way I'd never dreamed... and the loneliest now too. it's almost impossible to get you to pull your stare away from ur screen for even a second now, you body language and your response say, I'm the crazy monster keeping you from whatever ""excitement"" you think you are missing in life. 

i can't deny the fact in each tiny peck i occasionally get tells me. I am in love with someone who doesn't feel the same anymore 

As much as I love you I just wanted to make you happy and us to win! 

recent actions and bitter or dismissive comments say that I need to stop planning for M.17/25

I hope I'm just being silly and this is all nonsense and anxiety filling my head... I wish it didn't feel so lonley like I lost you long ago but you keep putting us on this path that before we can blink, we won't even call ourselves friends. 

I am notnor have I given up on you, or fall out of love... but I can't speak for you, and refuse to force you to stay where you aren't hapoy. You have to follow your heart and do what makes you smile Even if it means I don't get to be by your side as your wife like we had originally planned. As much as it would hurt I've only ever wanted to help and see you win. 

I know I'll never understand what changed, leading to our end. I can only hope one day you free yourself from the darkness consuming your brain. You deserve love and happiness no matter what the drake things in your head say. ",1,1743241805.0,letters,1,1.0,False

She has always been negative, but now it‚Äôs out of control. She‚Äôs constantly annoyed with my father and makes sure everyone knows it. In her eyes, all of her life problems are his fault. Despite having a very privileged life‚Äîconstant trips, sometimes expensive and far away‚Äîshe remains ungrateful. Honestly, I think my dad takes her on these trips just to keep her from bothering him. Her daily routine is exhausting to witness. She wakes up at 4 AM, spends hours on social media, then goes to the office just to drink coffee. By mid-morning, she naps for a few hours, claiming exhaustion from ""working so hard"" or citing nonexistent health issues. She wakes up moody, complains, bosses people around, and lashes out at my father and brother over trivial things. By evening, she‚Äôs back home, does no housework, spends more time on social media, and goes to bed early‚Äîonly to repeat the cycle the next day.

My dad is frustrated by my mother‚Äôs lack of discipline. She doesn‚Äôt do much housework, and their home is a mess. Whenever he suggests hiring external help, like a cleaning service, she refuses, claiming she doesn‚Äôt trust them. Most of my parents' arguments stem from housework. Eventually, my dad loses patience and starts yelling because he can‚Äôt take it anymore. But then she turns it around, telling everyone he‚Äôs extremely aggressive and controlling. As a child, she would speak badly about my father, which made me feel a mix of fear and reluctant respect for him. Later, I realized he wasn‚Äôt as bad as she made him out to be‚Äîhe‚Äôs just a workaholic, while she simply doesn‚Äôt want to work. Now, she claims that we‚Äôve all teamed up with my dad against her, just because he has the money.

She also insists that other men take care of their wives financially and that my dad is the only one who doesn‚Äôt. In reality, she receives around ‚Ç¨1,000 a month, which she spends on shopping‚Äîyet somehow, it‚Äôs still not enough for her. I‚Äôm honestly shocked at how someone can be so ungrateful for the life she has. Whenever we try to confront her about her behavior, we remain calm and attempt to give her advice. But the moment we do, she starts yelling and screaming, saying that we‚Äôre all against her, that we don‚Äôt love her, and that we hate her. She bursts into tears, and at that point, it‚Äôs impossible to continue the conversation.

We‚Äôve been trying to convince her to see a therapist because her behavior is making everyday life extremely difficult. She creates drama over the smallest things and treats everyone with cynicism. I don‚Äôt want to be around her, but at the same time, I can‚Äôt just cut her off‚Äîshe‚Äôs my mother. The problem is, we can‚Äôt even have a normal conversation with her. If we try, she just insists that she‚Äôs ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù‚Äîbut in her mind, that means she‚Äôs quirky. I have never heard her take responsibility for her words, even when she was extremely rude to me, my brother, or even clients. She always has some kind of excuse or justification.

As a side note, my father isn‚Äôt perfect‚Äîhe has his flaws‚Äîbut compared to her, they‚Äôre minor. Honestly, I‚Äôm worried that she‚Äôs going to wear him down completely. With the constant stress she puts him under, I fear he might end up having a stroke.",2,1743241794.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False
1jmits7,https://www.reddit.com/r/macbook/comments/1jmits7/apple_pricing_help/,Apple Pricing [HELP!],"Main question: How noticeable is the 1 inch real estate loss going from 15 in to 14 in (I'm currently on a 2019 13in mbp, so I don't have a reference point - and I won't be able to go to an Apple store for at least another 3 weeks).

With the M4 Airs finally releasing in the region where I'll be relocating soon, and the M4 Macbook Pros being about half a year old (and thus being on 5-8% discount), Apple pricing logic:

15 inch M4 Air, 16gb RAM, 512SSD vs 14 inch MBP 16ram, 512ssd

I can get the MBP for $80 more. I tend to keep my devices for 5-6 years (with finally switching to silicon, maybe even longer), so the $80 is negligible.

I don't do any crazy heavy tasks (my heaviest usecase is figma, running 30 chrome tabs open, and editing short-format vids + 5-8min youtube ones in capcut). I was also thinking about getting a 120-144hz external monitor, although from what I hear the M4 chip wouldn't even notice the extra load from it.

Do I cop the pro - i.e. fans, 120hz screen, better sound system (although I'm always working from coffee shops and have dedicated earbuds, so this is out of the equation), but same weight as the 15in Air and 1 inch smaller.

Or the air - fanless design (I doubt I'll ever get any cpu throttling for my usecases), 60hz screen, comparatively worse sound system (although, not an issue), but 1 inch bigger?

Every weekend, I traveled 250 km (about 155 miles) to see her. I was fully committed, but she was extremely jealous, often created drama, and constantly set conditions in our relationship.

The breakup happened because, while I was out shopping, she took my phone and read my messages with my best friend. She found nothing offensive‚Äîjust my reactions to her jealous outbursts. Still, she claimed that I was ‚Äútalking bad about her behind her back,‚Äù which wasn‚Äôt true.

We agreed to talk about reconciliation, but she gave me an absurd condition‚ÄîI had to send a message from my phone to my best friend and my best female friend, admitting that I was wrong. Fearing losing her, I did it. However, knowing my female friend might react harshly, I sent her a warning message beforehand, asking her not to insult my girlfriend because I wanted to fix things. When my ex found out, she immediately ended things for good, saying she could never trust me again.

After that, she came over, went to a wedding, texted me from there, and asked if she could stay at my place afterward. She arrived, had some drinks, and I was already emotionally exhausted. At one point, she told me that our relationship was ‚Äú90% about sex,‚Äù which hit me hard because I had put so much effort and love into it. When I told her that sounded like something a shallow girl would say, she got offended and asked if two girls she was jealous of were more attractive than her. Frustrated, I said yes (physically speaking), but that I wasn‚Äôt interested in them‚ÄîI only wanted her. That made her even more upset, so she retaliated by telling me she was ‚Äúinto‚Äù my colleague, clearly trying to hurt me.

The next morning, after everything that had happened, she demanded that I make her coffee and breakfast. I did it, but she still found something to criticize. She then left, kissed me in the car, and said, ‚ÄúSee you.‚Äù

The following day, I confided in my three closest friends because I was struggling emotionally. Apparently, one of them mentioned it to her best friend (who happens to be my colleague). That same evening, my ex texted me, saying the breakup had hit her harder than she expected. I told her what hurt me the most was what she said, and she coldly replied, ‚ÄúWell, let that be your reason for the breakup,‚Äù even though she was the one who ended things.

The next day, her friend messaged me, accusing me of ‚Äúspreading lies and false rumors.‚Äù She claimed my ex was suffering because of me while I was ‚Äúmaking up stories‚Äù about how she said our relationship was 90% about sex and that she was into my colleague. I told her that it didn‚Äôt matter what others said‚Äîwhat mattered was what my ex told me directly. She insisted that I was causing my ex pain, even though I was just trying to move on.

Later, my ex messaged me again, this time threatening that ‚Äúthings would get ugly‚Äù if I continued. I ignored it.

Now, I‚Äôm focusing on myself‚Äîworking out, improving my physical and mental health‚Äîbut I still miss her sometimes. What bothers me the most is the feeling of injustice: she hurt me, but somehow, I‚Äôm being made out to be the bad guy.

My partner is very kind mapag mahal galante, wala ako masasabi many times lagi niya ako trinitreat whenever may cravings ako. Same din naman ako pag sahod haha. But sometimes naprepressure ako sa lifestyle niya, last last year before kami magkakilala i have a huge debt like 800k because of (pagkakamali sa ex) and im still paying for it until this year matatapos na siya this year konti na lang plus monthly expenses pa.  Kaya medyo tipid ako because i have to pay for my debt. But sometimes nafefeel ko ba ang hirap sabayan ng lifestyle niya like every friday saturday sunday kailangan lalabas kami mag gym mag eat out or mag cocoffee sa labas. But for me kasi minsan ung kain sa labas syempre gagastos ka 500 pesos up. And sometimes nauubos din ako talaga and nafrifrustrate ako pag di ko din nasasabayan ung gusto niya unlike siya meron siya big income and ako nag babayad pa ako ng utang ko. Ineexplain ko sa kanya na baka pwede sa bahay nalang niya watch movies ganun pero laging sasabihin niya nahihilo sya need niya ng coffee lalabas tatamaby.. ako naman naiisip ko wait lang di ko na kaya sabayan kasi i have bills to pay plus utang plus other expenses pa. Ending ittreat na naman niya ako. Minsan nahihiya na ako. Hindi ko siya bliniblame sa lifestyle nya. Alam kong ako ung problema.. siya ung tao na hindi pedeng hindi lalabas pag weekend kasi nga meron naman siya.. pano ko kaya eexplain sa kanya ung situation ko.alam ko ang babaw nito pero ang hirap din kasi.",2,1743240565.0,MayConfessionAko,5,1.0,False

My partner and I are apart of a community online. 

 There is a girl in said community that is kinda known for being very flirty with the guys etc. 

Anyhoo today whilst getting coffee a friend mentioned that her partner had to block this said girl as she was sending inappropriate messages. I replied with oh that‚Äôs so weird her and my partner have spoke in the past but nothing weird, to which she replied oh but didn‚Äôt they get coffee and meet up.. 

Now here‚Äôs what I found out later, my partner met up with this girl who was in our area for the week and chose not to tell me. 
To make matters worse I was away for a retreat (which is the first time I‚Äôve ever gone away) and took our child with him. 
This happened 5 months ago mind you

I then snooped on his instagram cause I can‚Äôt help myself and noticed that the entire chat thread from about a month ago was deleted. 

I confronted him obviously and he tried to play it off like it was a by chance meeting, I asked the girl and she said no it was planned. 


I then asked why all the messages where deleted and he said cause the way she talks would make me upset LOL and he didnt tell me cause he didnt want me to get mad that he was meeting up with a girl while i was away. 

I don‚Äôt think anything sus happened but why is he lying to me about it, why keep this a secret and why delete all of the messages. He clearly knew i wouldnt be fond of the idea so why do it in the first place. However if he told me when it was planned I wouldn‚Äôt have had much of an issue with it. 

The fact that his deleted all of the messages really has my mind racing. If she‚Äôs been saying things that would upset me then wtf was he saying  to solicate a conversation like that.

I just want to start off this by saying I love my daughter and I will spend my life trying to make it up to her,

My daughter Anna (17) has always been a problem child she‚Äôd rather make tiktoks than study and is extremely vain since she hit puberty, she is very judgmental about others especially boys her age to the point she‚Äôs gotten in trouble for bullying

Imagine mine and my husbands shock when she brought home Tom (18) whom had a great reputation for not only his academic achievements but his charity work (small town) now Tom wasn‚Äôt my daughters usually choice of boyfriend, her past boyfriend‚Äôs were pretty boy jocks who were living in their glory days before the ultimate peak in high school which concerned my husband and I because my daughter was going into that direction too.

Tom fooled everyone into thinking he was this amazing kind boy that wanted to make a change in our town, he was of the few people in our town who was openly liberal and pushed to educate on world issues which my husband and I admired. Looking back now there was signs of toms isolation of Anna like when he came to our house to privately speak to my husband about two of Anna‚Äôs friends, he told us they were being openly transphobic against another girl in their school and he tried to warn Anna about them but she brushed him off by calling it ‚Äújokes‚Äù

We were shocked thanked him than punished Anna and banned her from said friends when she asked us were we got the information from we lied and told her a teacher which looking back was an idiot move, he happened twice more with Anna‚Äôs other friend‚Äôs

At the time we thought he was trying to help Anna and put her on a better path in life as we witnessed Tom educate Anna on issues and Anna herself seems more interested in things going on around her rather than the blush launch or TikTok trend, Ann seems like a whole new person we honestly believed Tom was a good influence on her as he fooled not just us but everyone around him

In late September Anna broke up with Tom out of the blue and told us we needed to cut contact when we pressed why she wouldn‚Äôt give us any details so we reached out to Tom who asked to meet for coffee Tom lied to us and said Anna had been cheating on him with one of her best friends (Sarah) brother and Sarah had been covering it up, my husband first wife cheated on him so Tom knew he could manipulate us with this. I‚Äôm ashamed to say we were very hard on Anna my husband even called her a slut who would end up up in the local trailer park with multiple kids on food stamps and I made her cut contact with Sarah.

Anna stopped speaking to us outside of one word responses and barely left her room even refused to speak to our family therapist on Halloween Tom called me to tell me Anna was at a party drunk and hanging off any guy that would look her way, Anna was meant to be grounded and as she didn‚Äôt have a phone we had no way of connecting her so we asked Tom bring her home, 40 minutes later cops showed up at our door Anna had assaulted Tom apparently Tom had dragged her to the car and while he was driving she kept pulling the wheel so he pulled in to claim her down than she began assaulting him (we know now that not the real story)

Tom didnt press charges and for the next few weeks he kept coming over to check up on Anna pretending to be concerned, unfortunately we didn‚Äôt notice what was really going on

In November we got a call from the school that Anna was rushed to the hospital, what happened was Tom cornered Anna at an abandoned part of the school were kids go to vape/smoke and tried to force Anna to kiss him  Ann rejected him so Tom to strangle Anna

Thankfully some kids vaping saw this and saved Anna, doctors told us there was signs of long term abuse. I was shocked Tim really had everyone fooled into thinking Anna was the bad guy in the relationship when he was the one abusing her

Anna wouldn‚Äôt speak to me or my husband we only found out the details when my sister repeated them to us. Anna has been staying at my sisters two states over because she doesn‚Äôt feel safe with us

We have tried reaching out but all we are met with is abuse from my family I don‚Äôt know how I can fix this my daughter won‚Äôt even let me near enough to apologise to her, she doesn‚Äôt even want us at the first hearing in late April nor her 18th birthday on Monday

I know I was failed her and I‚Äôm a fool but Tom had everyone fooled

We begged Sarah to talk to her but she told us we were just as bad as Tom so leave Anna alone

TLDR: my daughter dated what we thought was the perfect boy and we unintentionally help him isolate my daughter now our daughter won‚Äôt even look at us",3,1743239770.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

*   ‚Å§**Brewing Control:** The‚Äã chemex offers unparalleled control over the brewing process.

This level of control is highly valued‚Å§ by home baristas and coffee enthusiasts who prioritize achieving optimal ‚Äçflavour extraction.

*   **Exceptional Coffee Quality:** When brewed ‚Äãcorrectly, the ‚Å£Chemex produces a remarkably clean and‚Å§ flavorful cup of coffee. The ‚Å¢thick Chemex‚Äç bonded filters play a crucial role, ‚Äãremoving ‚Å§sediment‚Å£ and unwanted oils,‚Äç resulting in a smooth, ‚Äåluminous, and nuanced brew.

*   **Simplicity and Ritual:** The act of brewing coffee wiht a‚Å£ Chemex ‚Å¢is ‚Å§a mindful and rewarding ritual. The slow, deliberate ‚Å§pour-over process encourages you to slow down‚Äã and ‚Å§savor the moment, transforming the simple act of making‚Å¢ coffee‚Äç into a ‚Äçrelaxing and enjoyable experience.

## Who is the ‚ÄåChemex‚Äç For? Understanding the target Audience

The chemex isn't for‚Äå everyone. Its‚Äå manual brewing process requires patience and attention to detail. To determine if it's ‚Å£the right choice for you, it's helpful to‚Å§ consider the key audience segments‚Å§ that the Chemex brand ‚Äåappeals to:

## Chemex vs.‚Äã The Competition: Exploring Pour-Over Alternatives

* ‚Å¢  ‚Å¢**Kalita Wave:** The Kalita Wave features a flat-bottomed brewer and patented wave ‚Å¢filters,‚Å£ promoting even extraction ‚Å¢and consistent ‚Äãresults. It's a great ‚Äçoption for beginners seeking ‚Äåa more forgiving and less finicky brewing experience.

**Choosing the ‚ÄçRight Option:**

The best pour-over coffee maker for you depends on your individual needs and preferences. ‚ÄãConsider the following‚Äå factors:

*   **Brewing Experience:** Do‚Å¢ you enjoy the‚Äç hands-on ritual of ‚Äãmanual brewing, or ‚Å§do you prefer the convenience of‚Å£ an automatic machine?

Makes me stay in bed depressing and dont want to start my day. Laying down left side helps tho. 

My throat is always sore, my mouth sour, when i talk for too long it feels like i get tiny drops coming to my throat and irritate the area and start to get hoarse. 

I start to eat normal size meals again but it makes my upper stomach hurt a little bit, and i get full fast but i can manage now because i came back to work and im always up and walking so it dont make pressure or pain on my sternum or chest like before. When i get to walk faster or move more intensevly i experience that gerd coming.

The thing now is, i stopped pantoprazol 2/3 days ago and even start to eat normal again (including coffee, chocolate, orangea, fires, processed meats, cheese, lemonade, icecreams) i dont have experience that sensation of the stomach ""beeing Open"" and the most ive been feeling is hearthburn and still didnt have a normal episode of gerd. I havent been doing so much effords this week but i will ride my bike or make some workout to see if i have an episode of gerd.

Although i have this feeling of squeezing inside of the sternum area / upper stomach.

Maybe its to early to come out of ppis and feel reflux again , but im worried that i will do the Phmetry at a wrong time and catches nothing.

Also if i have this feeling of squeezing on the upper stomach and Hill grade III can the manometry suggest there is an HH?

I‚Äôll try to keep this relatively short.

I think I‚Äôm starting to resent my younger brother, and it‚Äôs making me really upset. In high school, I was an average/below average student and it was due to a late diagnosis of ADHD. I never had much motivation, ever. I only played Volleyball for a couple years in high school. I have a history of mental health issues, which have recently ‚Äòresolved‚Äô so to speak as I only got diagnosed last November. However I am in Uni for Fashion Design. I have always been good at the arts.

My younger brother plays three different sports throughout the year, is very smart math/science wise, and gets good grades. He also is in jazz band at his school. He is accomplished, and also polite in manners (most of the time). He also has ADHD but got diagnosed when he was around 7-8 years old. He has the hyperactive type, whereas I‚Äôm the inattentive type.

I think this resentment is coming from how I see the way our parents interact with us. My father, especially. I notice anytime I go to talk to my dad about anything while he‚Äôs busy (which is 99% of the time), i always notice his body language is immediately annoyed. Sometimes he even rolls his eyes, and when I talk to him he has short and blunt responses. The only time this doesn‚Äôt happen is when we talk about politics, in which we have the most discussion. Growing up, my parents didn‚Äôt pay much attention to me in regards to emotion, or school. They never actually checked to see if I had done my homework. They usually left me to my own devices. But they always bought me stuff I wanted. However with my brother, they always check if he‚Äôs on top of his school work. My dad is always asking my brother about his school life, what events are on, when training is happening, how his friends are etc‚Ä¶ I am often cut off in conversation or talked over. And when I‚Äôve brought it up in the past, it‚Äôs been brushed off. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just conversation. You‚Äôre too sensitive.‚Äù Right. 

Even at family events with extended family, the conversation topic often revolves around him and what he‚Äôs up to. Last time the topic of him getting a f‚Äôn haircut came up 5 consecutive times. A haircut. And I‚Äôm not saying they never ask about me, but when it is about me, nobody ever asks follow up questions, just kinda goes ‚Äúoh okay. Cool‚Äù and that‚Äôs as far as it‚Äôll go. Whereas with him they are just fascinated by him. And if he gets cut off in conversation, they loop back to where they were. Whereas with me, if I get cut off mid conversation, no one ever loops back. It‚Äôs just forgotten about. Anytime I‚Äôve gone to my parents about feeling sad or insecure, the response is to ‚Äútoughen up‚Äù and to ‚Äústop thinking that way‚Äù. Whereas when my brother even slightly talks bad about himself, my dad is just worried about him and brings him up in conversation. ‚ÄúYeah, (brother‚Äôs name) has been feeling quite low about himself recently. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs causing that.‚Äù Or when I‚Äôm trying to talk about something and my brother does some silly behavior (millenial emily you‚Äôre such a crackhead vibes type thing) my parents always make a point to notice it and laugh at it. And it‚Äôs beyond frustrating for me because when I get cut off I always need to think about what I‚Äôm talking about, where I was in the story etc‚Ä¶ but when I try to show my parents a funny video or something I rarely get a chuckle. Just a, ‚Äúoh thats nice‚Äù. My brother reminds me of that meme, ‚Äúour little comedian‚Äù. He‚Äôs not actually that funny. He just spazzes out and makes some stupid noise. But to everyone else he is so funny. At the end of my shifts, i always buy my family each one of their favourite snacks. For valentines day, i get everyone a little v-day themed chocolate or something. It is never appreciated, and my brother just takes my snacks without asking and eats it. All he does is take and take and take and take. He never. Gives. Not to mention is collection of warhammer and whatever other shit he owns like his school bag etc is always constantly sprawled across the living room floor and the rest of the house as well. I‚Äôm not kidding. It‚Äôs a hazard. He has FOUR piles of warhammer shit just all across the lounge floor now. And it takes up all the space of the coffee table, and even the piano. It‚Äôs been there for months. When i asked him to clean up, he got pissy with me and said ‚ÄúI have to study‚Äù (he just spent a straight hour on tiktok.) My dad just uses the excuse of, ‚ÄúHis bedroom is half the size of yours‚Äù (its fucking not btw) or ‚ÄúYeah we‚Äôre waiting until xyz event is done and then we can store those away‚Äù. He even leaves his dirty disgusting clothes and shoes everywhere. He never cleans up after himself. In the morning he always leaves his bowl of cereal (waste of food too) in the lounge. As if he couldn‚Äôt spare 30 seconds of his precious TV time to put the fucking bowl away before the milk rots and attracts bugs. But here‚Äôs the kicker. As a fashion major, I need a flat surface to cut out fabric pieces. So sometimes I use a bit of the tile in the living area (each bedroom has carpet floors) and sometimes when in a rush I leave a mess. And I get told to clean up after myself. Not even a day goes by and I get told to clean up the mess I left. To pack away everything. But HE gets to sprawl all his useless shit he hasnt touched in months all over the living room floor? Or any flat fucking surface for that matter? I‚Äôm so fed up.

I don‚Äôt know. I know this is all first world problems and it doesn‚Äôt really matter that much. But I always feel left out. And i know I‚Äôm an adult now but I still feel like a kid. I know I need to get over it and move on. It could be worse. But all of this (and more that I can‚Äôt think of at the moment) is just making me hate him. 

Can someone please give me some advice? Or tell me if I‚Äôm being unreasonable?

The first moment I looked into her eyes I thought she was the most beautiful women I had ever seen in my life and I could sense that she was intellectually brilliant. I also felt a deep sense of recognition, and was blown away. She gave me a lot of eye contact to the point that I could feel her studying my face when I was looking away. 

She didn't work permanently in my building until 6 months later. I met her and I told her that ""I remember you"". I was standing and she was sitting. She put her fist underneath her chin and looked up at me with doe eyes. 

I only ran into her perhaps 5 times over the next year (to the present day) but each time I felt a really strong connection and things felt serendipitous. 

At the start of this year I decided to ask her for coffee. Unfortunately she did not reply, and she took approximately 6 weeks off work for an unknown reason. 

Over the past 3 months I fell deeply in love with her. I cannot explain it other than to say that I had never felt anything like this before and I was convinced that I had met the 1 that I would marry. Again, I have never felt like this before and I assumed it meant ""true love"". I believed that my feelings were reciprocated. 

I felt madly in love and wished for her to either accept or reject me. She ignored me twice though I felt sure that there were signs that she was interested but too shy/not ready. 

Well I was convinced ""by the signs"" that she was interested so I messaged a third time (yesterday) and she finally replied to me and rejected me, telling me that she only wants to be colleagues and not to message her about non-work related things again. 

Deeply shocked and humiliated that she was not interested in me, I replied apologising to her, and confirming that I would not message her again. 

Well this has been incredible torment and bewildering. I have never experienced anything like this before and feel so humiliated to have pursued a colleague and been so openly ""hopelessly devoted & in love"" and been rejected. 

I've been through A LOT of incredibly difficult like experiences which are ""worse"" but this is absolutely horrible.

Here‚Äôs How I Fixed It.,"A year ago, I launched a habit-tracking app I¬†*knew*¬†would crush it. I spent months coding, designing, and even bought a lifetime supply of coffee beans. When I finally launched?¬†**17 downloads**. My DMs were crickets. Turns out, my ‚Äúsure thing‚Äù was a flop.

I was ready to quit. Then I stumbled on a stupid-simple hack:¬†**fake it first**.

Instead of building another app blindly, I used¬†[Validify](https://validify.business/)¬†to slap up a landing page for my¬†*next*¬†idea (a dumb AI pet-name generator, don‚Äôt ask). Ran $5/day Meta ads. The results?

* 92% of people bounced in 3 seconds.
* But 8% actually typed in their email for ‚Äúearly access.‚Äù

That 8% became my roadmap. I doubled down on what they wanted, ditched the rest. Launched a stripped-down MVP in 2 weeks. Hit $1K MRR by month two.

**Moral of the story**:¬†*Your gut is wrong.*¬†Mine was. Your uncle‚Äôs is. Everyone‚Äôs is. Stop coding. Start validating.

If you‚Äôre stuck in build mode (like I was), Validify‚Äôs the only reason I‚Äôm not still crying over that $8K. Not a sponsor‚Äîjust a founder who finally learned to test¬†*before*¬†tears.",0,1743238011.0,indiehackers,3,0.42,False

Quick context: Dad died when we were young. Old school rough drunk father.  Stepdad came a long and married mom. We lucked out, he's a great guy! 

2 insane sisters

Sister 1
Both older, 47, 44 and me 42. Both have 1 son. 1 married sister, son (looks/and is mentally 6-7 but is actually 12) has FASD, puts his parents though a lot but is doing better year after year. I was very thankfully recuperating at her place after an old lady didn't look left and hit me off my motorcycle, shattering my right leg. , she admitted fault,I was only going 30mph. My apartment is in a basement so too hard to access. My folks in their in-law suite took me to physio except when my sister did once. Physio girl randomly quit for a different place, no crossover notes, my appointment went over time to make my sister who drove me, late for shopping with her rich husband on his lunch for glasses for their next 2 cruises around the world. She randomly started beating me when I apologized. I hopped out, she wouldn't get the crutches and continued hitting me on the side of the highway with cars passing. When I got them I hobbled away until my folks came to pick me up. Her husband basically begged me to not call the police so she wouldn't have a charge and could travel. He told me she wouldn't apologize, I said be accountable and she could've left the appointment and picked me up later or just left me, even though it's a 30 min ride home. She apologized to me but told him she didn't. I moved home thankfully, ASAP, they gave me hockey tickets once in a vip suite his work has. I chuckled and went. Parents didn't want me to contact police or tell anyone, worried about their image in their ritzy neighborhood. I agree I should've text and say it's running late but I didn't check the time or know about said appointment. I just get in the suv to a red faced woman that started beating me as she drove and I'm trying to cover my busted leg.  

Sister 2
Basically think of the lazy hick family in a the Million Dollar Baby movie where the large mom expects everything. 400+ lb 6ft2 woman. Extremely negative, spiteful, vengeful, nasty and vile all her life and outspoken about it. Her husband left her as no surprise. He tried being near the son but she made it extremely difficult but still wanted paid. Son has now grown up to be afraid of anything, 350 lbs, 6ft 4, causes fights at school usually being racist to black kids and gets beat up in return. He becomes close to me while I was recovering there and she'd visit for free meals, ask for money, get angry, they'd physically fight (mother and son) until they'd leave. I was gaming with him. He wouldn't stop telling me about the stuff his mom said. I said we can't have a relationship or gaming buddies if you keep telling me the nasty stuff she says. (Extremely vile and hateful stuff. This woman is very hated by a lot of people in the town and school system and gets called a bully by grown adults). She's basically our biological dad with a vagina who she seems to forget always beat us when he was drunk, and a COP at that!!! The stuff we seen him do and arrest people for was mind boggling. Then have our mentally unstable mother gas light everyone to go at each other then try to solve it and bring everyone back. It's like mental munchousen syndrome. My stepdad doesn't deserve that. 

Said nephew (16) doesn't reply. Just said okay bye. No sorry I won't just a bye but asks me for my gamepass password I paid up on for 2 years. I said what? You won't talk to me about this except for gaming? Sorry man, that's my work email too. (Dumb of me yes). He said whatever bye. I said man this really sucks all you gotta do is not tell me what she says about me. I don't want negative people in my life. He's like ""K yuh bye."" 

I don't hear anything for a day but get this random angry message saying ""You broke a little kids heart hope I had fun!"" And blocked me. We all know who that was from. His mom, my sister.

He joins my game and won't stop going in front of me and crashing (Forza 5) and isn't on voice chat. He sends a message for me to check my text. I do. It's him saying call him. I do. He tells me he cried all night and told his mom who then broke some electroncis yet again (but will ask for money handouts to get more) then takes his phone and goes on a rampage in texts on multiple social media accounts after not realizing she's blocked on my phone, makes fake accounts, saying I took away this kids only best friend (he never told me that, he was always just immature as hell). 

I tried giving him advice but he'd throw tantrums and try to break my laptop but resorted to breaking his controller I fixed many times. Then she says that broke her heart (she's got one?) and made her cry, calling me an f-nig ahole. That I'm just the same 14 year old she used to beat up but I apparently deserved it. Said this is just more ammo to tell the family when they get back from their cruise (other sisters family & our parents) who the tyrant is dog sitting at the ritzy house with her son and spent the $800 for food on new electronics and tore through the other families food but calls the other sisters husband and less than a dog but he's paid her rent how many times? 

Just because buddies rich doesn't mean she's earned it. She blames everyone and everything and an iron deficiency on it. Calls out anyone in a restaurant to embarrass them and fights with her kid. She never works and goes on stress leave as soon as she has enough hours in. 

I've made a mends with the other sister who hit me. I've been gas lit for years and hated on for taking a job opportunity across the country but they were all happy to spend my money when I was home. They got me to apologize to them; so I caved in so I could spend Christmas with them. Their dog charged at me, bites anyone and anything, a vicious Labradoodle (a meme in itself), I grit my teeth, broke a tooth they didn't care or stop the dog so I left and took a year off seeing them and avoiding the drama. 

I seen them for half a year, things were going great although I'd hear about things behind my back. I get in an accident, I get graciously helped by the husband, sister who hit me, and my folks, especially my folks, awesome parents helping me with appointments and meals. I intend of giving more back than I already have. Sister and her husband asked for nothing and don't want anything, just to visit and be close with their fasd (12) son. 

Other sister in the other hand wants to throw it all away and say it's the same old me when they get home and say she knew ""peace"" wouldn't last. It's not an act of war or a state of peace. Why call it anything, it makes you expect something bad later. Then to call what me and my (16) nephew had a ""precious thing"", when she was against it beforehand, a lot during and now after. All while telling the family they shouldn't help me recover because it takes away from her funds. I paid my rent, food and toiletries, thanks but received a lot of meals. I paid for fuel that insurance reimbursed me for. Telling them I'm not thankful. They knew I was. I made my FB posts about it public going against my hermit lawyers advice who I've only seen or heard from the day I signed the papers Oct 1st, accident was Sept 14, 2024, just don't sister could see my posts, as he doesn't want PI's using anything they read. 

Then this wildebeest is whaling on every social platform still to the point I want on a massive blocking spree. Just waiting for them to get back from the cruise and trip in Florida, so she can be seen as some sort of vigilant victim to be favoured for more cash. 

My other sisters husband is polite but snarky, rich but frugal but will pay for anything my sister wants or anyone she knows needs. Stand in the way of her husband and she'd destroy the person. She also gets him to feed and pay the rent for the other sister because she can't feed her lazy self or her son. They spend it on electronics and very cheap dollar store food.

Her son (16) wants to live with the father but the father has his own family now and young children and doesn't want him there. Honestly don't blame the guy one bit due to how he couldn't help raise him before, he'd have to deal with the mother again, he'd have to help raise a very insure and mentally unstable quick to emotionally react and cry, 16 year old son who has 2 left feet and a lot of built up anger. That same sister expects and he expects, both to get my cheap literally falling apart old Subaru when I get my settlement plus to give them a portion. 

When you're such a menace and demon, your only value to society is to not exsist. I don't hate her, I tell her that. She tells me any nasty thing. I feel sorry for her and I don't care about her option of me anymore. Thankfully the rest of the family and my other sister (who still had her own gold digging snobby issues), her husband, her son who gets along with me great, my folks, all realize I'm not as the other sister says. But they do take vacations all summer with her and have group chats together. Not jealous of that just rather not be talked about. 

If you made it this far. Thank you üôè I'd even send a $5 your way for a coffee if you DM me lol üòÇ ngl

1jmhxlp,https://www.reddit.com/r/DetroitBecomeHuman/comments/1jmhxlp/simon_and_daniel/,Simon and Daniel,"Durning my morning coffee I randomly thought about Simon and Daniel being the same model/appearance and as the caffeine kicked in I started to think. And I'll try to keep it concise.

Daniel is the very first deviant we meet in the first level. He's the ""shocking"" representation of deviancy. He's scared, angry and confused. His dialogues are full of emotions saying things like ""I thought I was part of the family, I thought I mattered! But I was just their toy, something to throw away when you're done with"" or ""I loved them, you know? But I was nothing to them! Just a slave to be ordered around"" (and the word ""loved"" made me think that he may had feelings **before** he turned completely deviant).

He's angry and confused as why his family wanted to replace him with a newer model and no matter what we do: he's destined to die in one way or another.

Simon is also a PL600 model, a household android, but we never really get to know what happened to him that turned him a deviant. In some way he's an ""experienced"" deviant. He managed to snap out of that initial shock and his personality is pretty calm and neutral.

At first he's the leader of Jericho as it's still just a little gathering of broken deviants and although Markus was meant to be the true leader of Jericho, Simon stays loyal by his side. North (who I really came to appreciate as a character after the first wave of hate towards her) is the first one who decides to follow Markus to go gather spare parts, but Simon and Josh will go as well.

Simon is a secondary character, but he's also crucial for the story as well as North and Josh, the three of them being Markus' allies even though they represent neutrality, resentment/violence and pacific approach.

I believe that the choice of making Simon and Daniel the same PL600 model wasn't casual. As Daniel is the representation of despair and pain that deviancy brings at first, Simon seems to have overcame that initial shock and he became apparently neutral (apart during the most important scenes in the game where we must decide whether to pursue a pacific or violent path).

But some of the first quotes by Simon are ""you're lost, just like the rest of us. We didn't chose for this [...]"". As Daniel represents the confused and angry burst of deviancy, Simon uses words as ""lost"", making me think that although he ""made peace"" with the first strong emotions of deviancy, he also lost hope for a better future for deviant androids.

I really don't know why the developers decided to make Daniel and Simon the same model, but I believe there's some deeper meaning in it. 

Maybe it's just a post awakening/first coffee of the day thought, but I'd like to know your opinions on the matter and possible theories.

1jmhwnt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jmhwnt,Coffee Table Refinishing,"Hi! I would like some tips on refinishing this coffee table. We've damaged it over time with what I can only guess is hot water (the grey stains are permanent - I am unsuccessful at enforcing coaster usage üòí) and regular wear and tear. I'm sure I will end up with more questions as I gather more info on how to do this, but for now my main questions are generally: 

  
How to prep the surface, chemical strip? Hand sand? The surface is textured since I assume it may have been a door originally and hand sanding would be necessary to get into all the crevices. 

Do I need to apply additional stain in the darker areas? Or will that happen naturally with the way the stain settles? Same question for the striping on the individual panels.

And what kind of stain/sealer? is best for a coffee table? Needs to be durable and not sticky. I like the color and finish on it currently or maybe a shade darker, but I have no idea what it is. 

  
I'm keen on taking this project on myself because I love this table and it will be a piece we keep for a lifetime so I'm sure I will be looking to refinish it again and again over time. Thanks for your advice!",1,1743237327.0,furniturerefinishing,2,1.0,False
1jmhuti,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jmhuti/5_months_out_reminders_are_driving_me_insane/,"5 months out, reminders are driving me insane.","I had a rough breakup. My ex lost his mind and deflected a lot of crap onto me. It got emotionally abusive towards the end and I had to inform the police as he kept breaking into my apartments communal grounds, eventually breaking in to dump my stuff outside as apparently it was triggering him enough to the point of not sleeping 4 months after we split (he witheld it before then). I recently moved (moved twice since breakup) but it's difficult to settle and remove this man from my mind as we live locally to each other. I'm mass blocked on everything. NC for nearly a month, broke up 5 months ago nearly. I can't move out for the area yet although I am looking into this for the future because of my health ATM. 

He uses the gym a 5 minute walk from my place, it's a one way road system, so he drives past my place each time. I've put a window lock on my room and privacy screens on the windows, as a few times I kept seeing his car drive past my window. I barely use the shopping center where I live because it's near his gym which sucks or the big supermarket as I know he parks there for the gym and shops there after workouts. He goes to the gym 4/5 times per week, as he's introverted and apart from gaming and seeing family, this is all he does. 

I went for coffee with a friend last weekend at the shopping center and spent the entire time on edge wondering if we'd bump into him, (he was jealous of this friend as it was a past ex I remained in contact with) and knew it would upset him to see us together. We joked about bumping into him and then ironically he drove past me twice two days in a row, one time with me in the car and changing direction to avoid sitting next to him at the traffic lights, and the other whilst I was waiting at a bus stop to meet a FWB. I know the reg of his car off by heart, I saw it nearly everyday for 1.5 years lol (I loved that car). I wish I could ask him to stop using the gym here (as there are many in the area) but of course, I'm blocked. 

The high street near his is one of my favourite places, and woodlands by his flat. I loved living there, (it's about 30 mins on foot and 10 min drive). I haven't been able to go there since because I'm worried about bumping into him. I also go to the same doctors as him. My favorite surf beach (where I taught him to surf) he still visits, although we made a casual joke that we'd pick a beach in the area as part of the ""divorce"". I've been surfing many years and this is one of my favourite spots to go too, and I'm part of a community there. I removed him off the WhatsApp group for our surf community so he can't see the forecasts (I'm blocked so he wouldn't see me commenting about going down) but I know he still goes there with his brother in law who is part of the surf community. But he didn't join until we started dating and I taught him. So now even surfing reminds me of him, and also puts me on edge of seeing him, as he really got involved with my favourite hobby/sport and a lot of our trips revolved around it and he bought a lot of gear. Apparently he's always wanted to learn to surf and been into the ""fashion"" around it etc. Most of my surfing clothes were gifts from him. So another reminder. I've put most of his gifts in a bag dumped in the back of my cupboard, I had plans to dump them outside of his, like he did to me, but decided against it. 

This guy wants nothing to do with me, treated me like crap, dragged out the breakup (despite intiiating it) because he had control issues (he admitted this and acknowledged it broke us up) and refused to let go of me, things got toxic the more I pushed away and stood up for myself, our last contact was him dumping me things and even trying to steal some of my expensive things. I broke down near his place last weekend, and despite sending a text days prior (id been randomly unblocked for some reason) wishing him well (in the hope any random bumping into each other would be less horrible) he ignored it, and then declined my calls and blocked me when I text to say I was in an emergency and my car had broke down (car is now fortunately repaired). 

I guess this is just a rant but also looking for support and advice. Yesterday I finally went out to the shops near me and felt on edge the entire walk incase I saw his car. I want to go to the shops today but again, I'm on edge. I don't know why he still uses this gym near me. I really regret dating someone local, and I hate that all my favourite places have been tainted by him or he may just appear there.

I am a filipina, 30‚Äôs, lots of energy working in a nursing home for years. 

Today, my workmate told me one day I will get in trouble for doing stuffs for the resident. 

Before I do anything, the management knows what I am up to because I am always on the safe side too even I always use my heart. 

I fully support the residents decision and I always make them feel heard and valued. 
I always extend my hand when no one else will do it. 

I never ever receive monetary gifts from them.

What I do for them. 

When one resident wanted to watch a parade she has been watching for years, the manager sent a message who can drive her to town. No one responded. I volunteered, drove her, assisted her with her walker , bought her coffee and the happiness she felt was rewarding. Yes I got paid.

Resident has been placing bets on horses for years and time came he is not allowed to go out anymore for some circumstances. When he sees me, he asked me to place a bet and bring the ticket the next day. I do it when I finish my shift on the way back home. 

One day a resident was complaining he is sick of eating the food in nursing home and would love to eat some Thai food but there is no local delivery. I went and ask my manager If I can just pick up the food he ordered online and drop it in the nurse station and she agreed. 

One resident was on palliative and was crying because he said he knows he is dying and wants to wear a white formal top so that when he sees the Lord he looks decent. We looked everywhere in the laundry and we can‚Äôt find one that he will like. No one can pacify him. I went to the opshop and spent 7$, when he saw it he was wearing it for days and was very thankful. He passed weeks after. 

Today is a big day for me too. We have this resident who really hates showers. No one can do it. Except me today. 

So why my workmate told me today one day I will get in trouble. 

The resident asked me to drive him to the tab so he can placed the bet, nurse said no because I am needed on the floor. He asked if I can do it myself. Nurse said up to me. I already planned to have a rush shopping on my lunchbreak which I always do and I know I can squeeze the betting in because its just across the road and will take me 5 minutes. When I was back he was so thankful and told me Im a treasure. 


Dear Australians, am I overstepping my scope of practice? I apologise if I am. I started to ask my australian husband if there is something wrong with me. 
He said definitely no. He said thats the same reason he married me.

1jmhrgg,https://i.redd.it/9j7yb93j9lre1.jpeg,My Coffee Journey: From Filter Coffee to Espresso Machines,"Born into a South Indian family, coffee was always a part of life,but only as filter coffee. That‚Äôs all I knew and drank for years. Eventually, I switched to Davidoff instant coffee, which wasn‚Äôt bad, but I wanted to level up. So, I got a Black+Decker drip machine from Amazon. The funny part? I used Davidoff instant coffee in it for a whole year before realizing it needed fresh ground coffee!

I had no clue about cappuccinos or milk-based drinks. In fact, the first time I ordered an espresso at a caf√©, the barista handed me a tiny 30ml shot, and I asked, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the milk?‚Äù ü§£ü§£

Then came COVID, and like many, I went down the YouTube rabbit hole of espresso machines. I had my eyes on the De‚ÄôLonghi EC685 and finally grabbed it during the Amazon Great Indian Sale. Paired it with a JX-Pro grinder, and it took me six months to pull a consistently good shot. Been rocking that setup ever since, practicing latte art (still a work in progress).

After five years, I finally upgraded to the Profitec Go! Considered the MaraX and some dual boilers, but since I‚Äôm the only coffee drinker at home, it didn‚Äôt make sense. Excited for this next phase of my coffee journey :) 

Also, the funniest part, my friends and family know how much I love my coffee and the whole process. So whenever they travel, they bring me Bacha Coffee‚Ä¶ which I absolutely don‚Äôt like. I just save it and make them drink it when they visit

The bell above the door, a rusted contraption, gave a dull, tinny¬†*clang*¬†as Elias stepped into the Starlight Diner. It was a sound that seemed to hang in the air, a discordant note in the otherwise oppressive silence. The diner was a relic, a faded snapshot of a bygone era, with its cracked vinyl booths, chrome-legged stools, and the pervasive smell of stale grease and cheap coffee.

But it wasn't just old; it was¬†*wrong*.

The clock above the counter, a gaudy thing with neon tubing that flickered intermittently, was frozen at 12:00. High noon. Always. The sun, a hazy disk through the grimy windows, cast long, distorted shadows that didn't quite match the time.

Inside, the handful of patrons were locked in a strange, repetitive dance. A woman with beehive hair, her face a mask of faded lipstick and perpetual boredom, stirred her coffee with the same slow, deliberate motion, her spoon clinking against the chipped mug in an endless loop. A man in a stained work shirt, his eyes glazed over, recited the same string of nonsense phrases, his voice a low, monotonous drone. A teenager with a greasy pompadour idly spun a chrome napkin dispenser, the metallic whir a constant, irritating buzz.

Elias slid into a booth, the vinyl cold and sticky beneath him. He felt like an intruder, a ghost in a play where everyone else was trapped in their roles. Flo, the waitress, approached, her movements robotic, her smile a thin, brittle line. Her nametag, tarnished and faded, read ""Flo.""

""Coffee?"" she asked, her voice flat and devoid of inflection.

""Yeah, please,"" Elias replied, his voice a little too loud in the stillness.

Flo poured him a cup from a dented metal pot, the coffee a dark, viscous liquid that smelled more like burnt rubber than roasted beans. As she set the mug down, Elias noticed the stains on the Formica tabletop. They weren't random spills; they formed patterns, intricate and disturbing.

One stain looked like a twisted face, the eyes wide with terror, the mouth contorted in a silent scream. Another resembled a skeletal hand, its fingers reaching out from a dark abyss. A third was a chaotic swirl of brown, punctuated by tiny, almost imperceptible figures ‚Äì distorted, elongated, like insects trapped in amber.

He stared at the stains, a cold dread creeping up his spine. They weren't just stains; they were fragmented images, glimpses of something awful, something that had happened, or was about to happen.

The woman with the beehive hair suddenly spoke, her voice a sharp, brittle crack in the silence. ""He's coming back,"" she said, her eyes fixed on the empty space beyond the window. ""He always comes back.""

The man in the work shirt chimed in, his voice a low, guttural rumble. ""The clock... it's broken... time... broken...""

The teenager with the pompadour stopped spinning the napkin dispenser, his eyes widening with a sudden, unsettling awareness. ""It's noon,"" he whispered, his voice trembling. ""It's always noon.""

Elias looked around the diner, his heart pounding in his chest. He was trapped in a place where time had lost its grip, where the past, present, and future were bleeding into each other, where the very fabric of reality was fraying at the edges. And those coffee stains‚Ä¶ they were a warning, a glimpse into the fractured future of 88.",1,1743236158.0,AIBookSharing,0,1.0,False
1jmhnqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFD/comments/1jmhnqz/is_openfoam_appropriate_for_my_use_case/,Is OpenFOAM appropriate for my use case?,"Hello all,
I am currently designing a robot that will include a powered mixed-flow fan, designed to pull air from underneath the robot and create a low-pressure zone.  The goal of the project is to investigate the extent to which this method can contribute extra downforce on the robot's wheels.

Because there are so many variables involved in the design of the fan itself, I was hoping to set up a simulation workflow to help me zero in on appropriate numbers to use as a starting point before I begin making parts for the physical experiments.  For example, I hope to find some optimal ratio between axial and radial flow in the fan that manages to offset the leakiness of the robot skirt while creating the largest static pressure difference possible.  I also hope to get a feel for the effects of fan size and RPM on performance, as I will also need to optimize for weight in this robot.

Since I am a heavy user of open source software, and I am already using FreeCAD, I figure that OpenFOAM is potentially a good tool for this.  However, since I have not done any CFD-related work before (though I do consider myself techy enough to throw myself at it and ""figure it out"" after investing enough coffee), I figured I should ask whether there are any potential pitfalls to be aware of, or if I'm maybe barking up the wrong tree with this.  A sanity check, in other words.

Happy to answer any questions about the project, if anyone's curious.

The air in 88 hung heavy, thick with the scent of decay and forgotten things. Time, in this forgotten corner of the world, was not a linear progression, but a tangled knot, a twisted tapestry woven with threads of the past, present, and future. Elias Thorne, a man haunted by echoes of moments yet to come, found himself drawn into this temporal anomaly, a town where the calendar bled, shadows consumed the daylight, and the dead whispered secrets from beyond the veil.

This is 88, where the boundaries of reality blur, and the horrors of time's distortion manifest in the everyday. Prepare to journey with Elias through the decaying streets, encounter the children with eyes like clocks, and confront the entity that holds this town captive in its twisted grip. But be warned, traveler, for in 88, the past, present, and future are intertwined, and escape may not be possible.

2. **Chapter 7: The Photographs That Change Faces:** Elias discovers photographs that shift, faces morphing into grotesque masks, revealing hidden histories and alternate realities.
3. **Chapter 8: The Radio Station That Plays Dead Air, and Then...:** He tunes into a radio station that broadcasts only static, until a chilling voice breaks through, speaking in reverse.
4. **Chapter 9: The Deja Vu That Never Ends:** Elias's sense of deja vu intensifies, becoming a suffocating loop of familiarity, a feeling that he's lived this moment countless times.

**Part Three: The Rotting Core**

1. **Chapter 11: The Rust-Colored Fog:** A corrosive fog rolls into 88, eroding time itself, aging everything it touches. Elias sees buildings crumble and people wither.
2. **Chapter 12: The Skin That Peels Away, Revealing Old Age:** The fog accelerates the aging process, turning people into withered husks, their skin peeling away to reveal skeletal forms.
3. **Chapter 13: The Voices That Speak in Reverse:** Elias deciphers the reversed voices, learning of 88's twisted history and the entity that controls it.
4. **Chapter 14: The Man Who Sells Hours:** Elias encounters a man who peddles stolen hours, his wares cursed and tainted. Elias is offered a chance to buy back lost time.
5. **Chapter 15: The Preacher Who Speaks in Prophecies of the Past:** A mad preacher warns of the ""Time Weavers"" and the impending collapse of 88, his prophecies echoing past events.

**Part Four: Breaking the Loop**

1. **Chapter 16: The Abandoned Amusement Park, Where Rides Loop Forever:** Elias ventures into the amusement park, where rides are trapped in endless cycles, a reflection of 88 itself.
2. **Chapter 17: The Hospital Where Patients Relive Their Deaths:** He finds a hospital where patients are forced to relive their final moments, their screams echoing through time.
3. **Chapter 18: The Mirror That Shows Your Future Corpse:** Elias confronts his own mortality in a mirror that shows his decaying future self.
4. **Chapter 19: The Key That Unlocks Doors to Other Timelines:** He discovers a key that unlocks portals to alternate realities, glimpses of what could have been.
5. **Chapter 20: The Chronal Parasites:** Elias learns about the creatures feeding on 88's fragmented time, and how they contribute to the town's decay.

3. **Chapter 23: The Endless Staircase:** Elias finds himself on an endless staircase, a symbol of the infinite loops of time, and he has to make a choice.
4. **Chapter 24: The Last Door That Opens to Another Beginning:** Elias makes his choice, stepping through a door to a new reality, leaving 88 behind, but carrying its scars.
5. **Chapter 25: The Silent Bells:** The bells of 88, which had been silent, ring out, but backwards, signaling either a reset or a final, irreversible change. The ending is left ambiguous, a lingering sense of unease.
