I had a little extra coffee this morning (like 1.5 cups instead of 1) so when my husband took us to Dutch Bros later I got a vampire slayer lemonade instead of coffee. I hate feeling overcaffeinated.

I have spent most of the past 12 hours feeling weird discomfort in my chest. My brain will not let me do anything restful, it insists on being ""productive"". I have sent every email I need to send. I tried to do laundry but I dissociated and had a 3 hour text conversation with my ex girlfriend about deconstructing my entire sense of self and identity. I do not understand how quickly the past hour passed, but my husband says I showered and then paced around the living room. When I close my eyes I see square fractals that turn into spirals.

I have weird mental health stuff, but this is weirder than usual and doesn't happen to me. I don't know if an extra half cup of coffee could even possibly do this to me or if there is something deeper going on. I have never had an energy drink besides coffee in my entire life and don't know what they would taste or feel like. 

I dont know how Dutch Bros works, so maybe making a Rebel instead of lemonade is nearly impossible, but I genuinely feel drugged and psychically attacked. I'm just trying to get some peace of mind that this isn't what happened to me to help me sleep. I think I will feel better tomorrow",1,1736049924.0,dutchbros,0,1.0,False
1htx4s8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompulsiveLying/comments/1htx4s8/my_story_so_far/,My Story so far,"As with a lot of posts on here, this one is a long one. But I appreciate everyone on here that takes the time to read and/or respond. I am a liar. I have only recently admitted this to myself, but I am at a point that there may or may not be any hope in saving my marriage and I am desperate to change. So I am sharing my story on here as a form of accountability and to ask for help/advice/resources. This story may be a bit disjointed, but I think it is in an order that is most relevant. 

I have been married to my wife for 12 years. I have been lying to her the entire time, but for the first few years it wasn't in any major way. Fast-forward to 2017, and my wife and I are going through a major remodel of our back yard. She is an extremely anxious person and was worried that the trees were going to fall on our child's room. We removed all the trees and this caused a whole host of issues including a lawsuit by a neighbor, a potential lien on our house, and putting ourselves in an almost devastating financial situation. During this time I met someone at an educational seminar for work. She asked me to find her on snapchat, which I did. I didn't know why at the time, but looking back I was desperate for any form of validation. We engaged in an emotional affair for a few months. Met once for coffee. And the whole time I didn't tell my wife. One day I was cleaning out the garage and she saw my phone open with the app (which I kept buried) open. She snatched it away from me and we proceeded to chase each other around the house. Not my finest moment. I lied about the affair for the rest of that day and into the next. I kept lying to try and control the narrative. Eventually the truth came out. We started marriage counseling and learned some better communication skills. I also learned that I had a deep need for validation and the dangers of seeking that outside of myself. 

Fast forward to a few months ago. I don't know why, but I picked up the ""lovely"" habit of shoplifting. Nothing big or of any real consequence. I, in my white male privilege, thought that I was getting away with it or that if I got caught I could plead ignorance. Little did I know that the store was keeping evidence of every time I did it. I was caught, arrested, and had to call my wife to bail me out of jail. After she did, she very calmly told me that we could work through anything if I was honest. I wasn't. I lied about it for about 2 hours. After I got home and was about get into the shower I decided to fess up to the truth. It was at that point that I realized I have a problem. The urge to lie was so strong that it felt like it overrode the rational part of my brain. I have since gone to court and I am on probation for the shoplifting. 

The very next month, she further discovered that I had been hiding a pretty significant amount of credit card debt from her. I didn't lie about it when confronted, but I had told her a couple months ago that I had let my credit card build up and she told me to handle it. I didn't tell her how high it was or that it was almost entirely my hobby at the time (comics) and interest charges. We dipped into savings to pay it off, and two weeks later I was let go by my employer. Not a great end of the year for me. 

Fast forward again to last night. Over the past few months I have been meeting with a therapist to peel back the onion layers on why I lie, feel the need to lie, etc. I have been journaling almost daily to try and get a better understanding of my own emotional state. And there had been times I was tempted to lie and didn't and times that I wasn't even tempted to. But last night I had taken some food from my MIL's house that she wasn't living in. When confronted about it, I lied. 

And when I lie, I don't just buckle when confronted. I double down on the story until I am way past all rationality. I finally came back and said that I was being dishonest about 15 minutes later. My wife said that it was the last straw and she wanted a divorce. As of today she is unsure whether or not that needs to be the plan, but it's not off the table. 

I don't know why I lie the way I do. The best guess that the therapist and I can come up with (and I think this is pretty accurate) is that it is a form of learned behavior/arrested development from my childhood. Specifically from 11-14. My parents divorced when I was 11 and my mother quickly married the man she had been having an affair with. The court put me in her care and we moved out of my home town. He was perhaps one of the worst examples of a human being I have ever met. A racist, sexist, alcoholic that was constantly and consistently emotionally, verbally and sometimes physically abusive to me and my mother. And my mother allowed it. Not only did she allow it, but there were times that she encouraged me to lie to avoid us both being in ""trouble"". While living with them I learned the pattern of ""avoid, lie, defend"". While I was in there care I had a massive asthma attack and was intubated for approximately 4 weeks. When I woke up I was completely paralyzed. I eventually regained most motor function, but I went back to seventh grade in a walker and worked up to a cane. Not exactly ideal ""don't pick on me"" material for middle school. Couple that with the fact that I went to six different middle schools and was unbelievably lonely. 

At 14, my mother and stepfather kicked me out of the house. It was the best thing that ever happened to me. But unfortunately so much of the damage was done. However I wouldn't realize how damaged I was until almost 30 years later. I am a liar and I have a problem. 

My hope is that I am not alone on this forum. What resources have ya'll found to help? ",1,1736049882.0,CompulsiveLying,1,1.0,False

1htx26p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1htx26p,AIO for being annoyed by his explanation? Need to vent. ,"I (23F) have been talking this guy (24M) I matched with on the apps for a few weeks. After many crappy experiences on dating apps, I finally matched with a guy that seemed mature and had his stuff together. My type with an athletic build and nerdy hobbies and interests. Our schedules finally aligned for us to meet for a date over coffee and a walk through an outdoor museum. 


The whole date we had great conversation, lots of laughs and even some light flirting. We even had the same outlook on relationships and expectations for the future. He offered to walk me back to my car since I parked in a garage a couple streets down. On the way back he asked me about my last relationship. I answered that I hadn’t been in a committed relationship since I was 15 and I have had short term fun with some unfortunately toxic guys and have just been enjoying myself since I have a high drive, but after enough shallow situationships I’m ready for something more long term now with someone with maturity for once. 


I can’t help but feel like there was a slight change in his demeanor when I shared this. I asked what about him and he said he had only been in one long-term relationship for 4 years that ended 8 months ago, which I found surprising. After we parted ways this was our text exchange. I’m just really frustrated because everything was going so well for us and we had so much in common. Now it just gets blown up out of nowhere. My thing is, why inquire about my past and relationship history if you’re going to judge so harshly?? He always knew what part of town I stayed in but now the distance is all of a sudden an issue? Right. Pretending like he’s doing it out of some kindness for what kind of relationship I “deserve” when I told him it’s not a waste of my time if he wants to go slow. 


I feel like he just didn’t want to outright say that it’s because of my history and is just insecure. Otherwise why be so quick to end things if I’m “so attractive and fun to talk to” without even trying to get to know me better. Honestly I have no idea why men are like this. Makes me so mad. So tired of how harshly guys like to judge women for what they did before they were even in the picture. Like, at least be man enough to come out and say what it really is. I don’t know.

- I have no idea if it's a solo artist or group song :(
- But I definitely hear a huge resemblance to Megalovania in the song's intro and chorus music. The vocal melody (?) is different though
- I think the song is almost to entirely in Korean because I couldn't pick out English phrases that would help me search for the song's title

So I purged all my posts so you might have the context unless you’ve followed me for some time. But like there’s this guy (classroom guy) and well it’s been a few days since I last got left on read and I just gotta say I really wish I could text him. But a) I deleted his number everywhere (finally was easy to delete it) and b) all my friends and also my situationship discourage me from texting him. But like. I’m sad. We never got the face time we talked about once or twice. I never got to hear him on the phone one more time. And I just wish he’d text me. And I think a lot of me is hoping he texts me but logically I know he won’t. I just really wish he would. I wish I hadn’t screwed up everything between us being an avoidant and needy and obsessive and over bearing person. I also just wish he saw it in me to date me. Like heck. Even one date and staying friends would make me happy. But at the same time it would crush me. 

I don’t know. Everything was a catch 22 with him. If we stayed friends I’d be sad I can’t date him. But here we are with no contact and while it’s finally gotten better, I still think about him everyday. I wonder if he will text me this new year. I wonder if he’ll take me up on that coffee run. Or just text to ask how I am. I wonder if he’ll notice I’m not gonna be at the club he introduced me to. I just wonder if he still cares I guess. Cause I still care. And it hurts right now. Cause all I want is him. I don’t wanna be with my situationship but my situationship offers the best dopamine and care that I don’t get from the guy I like. And it’s not like I don’t like my situationship, I just really wish it were *him*. Cuz I miss him. And I can’t stop thinking about him. Or wanting him. Daydreaming about him. All the sorts. 

I don’t know. My situationship (HA btw) is right when he says no guy would want me if I think about another dude. But like. Why can’t the guy just be the guy I like? Like if srsly. I know we’d go long distance starting in the summer but all bro gotta do to keep me is text me and call me and I’d be more than satisfied cuz I have no standards. Ugh. I wish he knew how happy he made me but I don’t think I could ever express that to him. I’ve learned the hard way that telling someone or expressing to someone that they make you happy only ends with us going NC. Soooooo yeah. I don’t think he’ll ever know how happy he makes me. We might not be talking anymore but the thought of him still warms my heart. And I keep his letter in my planner. God. I just miss him. He did make me really happy. And he’d make the happiest person alive if we dated. But like. lol. I’m a handful. I need a caution sign on me. “Don’t interact unless you can handle neediness 24/7”. 

I can’t decide if I wanna fall for HA again. But I don’t think I can if he doesn’t love bomb me. And I don’t want the kind of relationship he’d give but like: I would love to get over the guy I like. So maybe falling for HA wouldn’t be so bad. I don’t know. Rn I just wish classroom guy would come back and save me from this situation by dating me but I know that ain’t happening. Bros long gone. Like the wind. Just gone. 

I wish this was easier. But. It’s getting easier. It doesn’t hurt as much as it used to. And I have more will power to leave him alone now. So that’s good. I hope he’s happy with his family rn.

u/Lysychka- and I recently learned of this dish[,](https://imgur.com/a/E74B5Uo) courtesy of Chef Klopotenko, and we're excited to share it with you (see comments for link to his original article)!  It is a traditional delicacy of the Chernihiv region of northern Ukraine, and while we're still perfecting the execution (it's deceptively simple!) we can tell you that it's super wholesome and hearty, as are most dishes in which millet is the star of the show.

In fact, it is quite similar to some other millet-related dishes we've covered in past that are each spectacular in their own way - in particular, the super high-effort magic of [Kachana Kasha](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1b57mwp/637_eet_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_739th/).

**Hartanachka** is a quite ancient traditional dish that in the past would have been cooked over an open flame, giving it a distinctly smoky flavor.  Today's recipe includes smoked pears to try and impart a little of that campfire magic even if you're cooking it at home... but if you have access to smoked pork/bacon you could try that if pears are difficult for you to find in your market.

Klopotenko explains that Hartanachka had a rough time during the soviet era, but is making a comeback.  You can be a part of that!

# How to Cook Hartanachka, by Chef Klopotenko



Klopotenko explains:

>Millet is soaked in boiling water **overnight or for at least for half an hour** to remove possible bitterness in the groats. Then the water is poured into a separate bowl and is later used to help adjust the consistency of the already prepared dish once it is ladled onto the plate. You can use any type of potatoes for this dish, but it is best to use low-starch potatoes so that they boil well and quickly. You’ll also need pork, but streaky bacon can be used instead.

>According to most authentic recipes, hartanachka is usually cooked over an open fire, which gives the dish its characteristic smoky flavour. But the dish can be adapted to modern realities and cooked at home on the stove. We did just that – we added a dried pear to get the signature aroma.

**Ingredients**

* 5 potatoes (400-500 g)
* 250 g millet
* 300 g streaky bacon
* 5 eggs
* 10 green scallions
* 150 g sour cream (optional)
* 3 smoked pears
* 1 lemon
* 10 sprigs parsley
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Recipe**

**Step 1:** Put 250 g of millet in a bowl and pour 500 ml of boiling water to remove any bitterness. Leave it to soak for 25 minutes.

**Step 2:** Boil the potatoes along with the dried pears. Take 5 potatoes of the same size, peel them and place into a large pan without cutting them into pieces. Add 3 dried pears to potatoes. Add about 1.5 liters of water, bring to a boil and cook uncovered over medium heat for about 25 minutes.

**Step 3:** Dice the streaky bacon. Peel an onion and cut it into medium-sized cubes.

**Step 4:** Place the diced bacon in a hot dry frying pan and tender it for about 10 minutes or until you get cracklings. Add the chopped onion and sauté it, stirring occasionally, in the rendered bacon fat for about 3 minutes, until the onion is soft and translucent.

[Step 4.](https://preview.redd.it/1sotgvq7h3be1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6b21961d097bd45c3b47c592cc68ecb9b3dfd61)

**Step 5:** After about 25 minutes, drain the millet water into a separate jar. Add the soaked millet into the saucepan with potatoes without draining the water. Cook everything together for about 20 more minutes, until the millet is cooked through. Potatoes should be tender by then.

[Step 5.](https://preview.redd.it/bk4sdfeah3be1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=672de9a2a0e1dd935548a784f587e1ef24f44470)

**Step 6:** One the millet has cooked though, reduce the heat to a minimum and remove the pears. If the potatoes are still a little undercooked, mash them with a potato masher.

**Step 7:** Crack 5 eggs into the pan with the millet and potatoes, one at a time. Whisk thoroughly after adding each egg. Rinse the green scallion stalks and chop them finely. Also wash 10 sprigs of parsley, tear off the leaves and chop them finely.

**Step 8:** Step Add the chopped onions and parsley to the millet, potato and egg mixture. Stir and serve immediately. If you want a thinner consistency, stir in the remaining millet water after you have ladled the hartanachka into individual places. Also, if desired, add sour cream and a little bit of lemon juice.

One of the main reasons I consider myself neutral is because of how toxic both the black and green communities have become.

I’ve tried many different coffee brewers over the years, I liked some of them (French press was easy enough) but others (pour over) had a steep learning curve. My first couple of tries with the moka pot yielded some bitter, over-extracted coffee but once I figured out the right grind size, it changed everything. I also only use cold water in the bottom chamber and put it on top of a cast iron griddle to heat it at medium heat and it comes out perfect every time.

This particular brew I was using Bones Coffee Company’s “Salty Siren” medium roast beans which are flavored (salted caramel mocha) and the smell alone was incredible. My wife bought me a sampler pack of their flavored beans along with the moka pot, so I’ve been testing them all out, highly recommend. Since this brew I have switched to heating it on a smaller, frying pan which seems to heat up much quicker than the cast iron so that has helped with cutting down brew times.

All of this to say, I am so glad to have found my favorite coffee brewer, and I will be a moka pot user for life. Stay caffeinated, my friends.☕️

About me: 

• 5’1, slim, brown eyes, brown hair, pale/fair skin, a few freckles, and one dimple for some reason haha 

• born in San Francisco and raised in the Bay Area where it's super foggy, so I love cold weather 

• filipino/white

• introverted, silly, gentle 

• loves dogs (ᐡ ᴖ ᴥ ᴖᐡ)ฅ'' and other animals 

• grew up in a nintendo household, but I mostly play pc and emulate lately. Examples of games I like are: rdr2, silent hill, resident evil, zelda, persona, and previously ow2 (go easy on me and don't cringe too hard pls)

• loves being cozy indoors and being out in nature too

• I love photography and editing, so I can take photos of you if you ever want 🥰

• likes to listen to: nujabes, capsule, masayoshi takanaka, breakcore, classical music, various random instrumentals

• has dreams of seeing the world with someone ( ∩ˇωˇ∩). I'm quite fearful of flying and haven't gotten to adventure much at all yet, so that'll 100% be on the to-do list if we enjoy each other's company!


Perks of being with me!!!: 

• will make your tea/coffee and breakfast for you in the morning

• if there's an interest you have that idk anything about, you can teach me about it (you might have to eli5 at times though haha)

• will always show politeness, respect and care when around loved ones/family

• I almost never drink and will only do so for special occasions. I have a strong dislike for cigarettes.

• I have mostly been agnostic my whole life but in recent years I try to lean towards faith in God (waittt don't run away lmao). We don’t have to have matching beliefs though. *Being a kind-hearted person is what's most attractive and important to me*, rather than a specific kind of spiritual affiliation/devotion, just to be clear

• I was diagnosed with ptsd in high school due to a tragedy in childhood. I manage it very well these days, but I figured I should mention I may fall temporarily silent or space out sometimes

• I don’t mind distance as long as we plan to meet up eventually. + I'm also open to relocation someday (although not in the near future)

• tell me anything about yourself too! I don't mind long messages either! 

Sorry this was so long! I'm really hoping for something genuine so I wanted to make it detailed

1htwla5,https://www.reddit.com/r/pancreatitis/comments/1htwla5/nicotine_and_pancreatitis/,Nicotine and pancreatitis,"I was diagnosed with alcohol induced pancreatitis 4 months ago. I have had that feeling so many times before but never went to the hospital because it would always subside. Eventually it got so bad I had to go to the ER. All the doctors knew it was alcohol induced and I felt really stupid. I am glad it was still acute even though it was super inflamed. I have not had a sip of alcohol since I left the hospital 4 months ago. 

 So with that said I started to feel better and no pain but I was still smoking cigarettes everyday. I then started drinking huge amounts of coffee and coffee makes me smoke more cigarettes not to mention I was taking creatine because I started working out and thought it was ok. I also started getting away from my low-fat diet as well. Next thing I knew my pancreas felt worse then ever and I had to call the ambulance I could barely walk. I ended up in the ER again feeling so stupid. The CT scan and doctors said my pancreas was looking way better than it did 4 months ago and I was healing. I just had a mild recurrent case of pancreatitis but I had a few small pseudocysts that usually go away on their own. They also gave me an ultrasound and a HIDA scan only to find my gallbladder is working at 13 percent and I have sludge inside of it. Now I am worried I may have to get my gallbladder removed. This is a crazy ride and I am just lost. 

I am now going to quit cigarettes and vaping because if I inhale a vape or cigarette I feel a sharp pain in my pancreas and my gallbladder. Looks like God is telling me to give up all my bad habits and I am going to listen but not having nicotine has been way harder than giving up alcohol. No more coffee or creatine either, I am just going to go All Natural. Has anyone else had a similar experience with any of this? ",1,1736048126.0,pancreatitis,0,0.99,False

1htwi2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1htwi2e/aita_for_asking_boyfriend_to_move_out/,AITA for asking Boyfriend to move out?,"We've been living together for 6 years at my place. For 3 years, he was unemployed and couldn't find a job as a Structural Engineer. During that time, I supported him financially and emotionally, even paying for his 2 daughters' cellphone bills. I worked as a Data Analyst but the income wasn't enough, so I took a second job for six months as an AI Paralegal Analyst for renewable energy, but I was laid off in September 2023. He found a job with the City in September 2023.

I received 26 weeks of unemployment benefits and asked him to cover our household expenses once my benefits and savings ran out. He agreed. My unemployment ended in April 2024 and he started contributing $800 towards our $1600 rent and $320 for car insurance, plus basic groceries to cook 3 meals a week. 

I've applied to over 3000 jobs but haven't received an offer yet. In May 2024, I started driving Uber, making about $120 a day before gas. I showed him my calloused hands and reminded him of our agreement that he would cover household expenses until I found a job. He said the rent should be divided by three to include my 14-year-old daughter, which shocked me because minors can't pay rent. He suggested her dad should pay it instead.

This led to a big argument. I told him I couldn't cover all the expenses with Uber earnings and that I was exhausted from driving 10-12 hours daily for less than $200. I moved to the couch and asked him to move out, but he said he needed time. It's been 8 months, and now he only contributes $320 for my car insurance and occasionally $500 for rent and groceries like coffee, orange juice, milk, and water. I'm 2 1/2 months behind on rent and utilities etc… and praying for a miracle job offer to avoid eviction…

1htwhrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnneagramTypeMe/comments/1htwhrb/hi_what_do_i_sound_like_type_wise/,Hi! What do I sound like type wise?  ,"1. Tell me about your internal experience of yourself. What makes you, you?

I like to think about my intentions and actions, as well as who I truly work towards being- it just takes some effort. I know the truth behind my actions and I’m not afraid to explain them if necessary, but I'm also not afraid of being misunderstood. Real ones know lol.

1. You just had a really good day. Describe it. It can be a real recent example or an aspirational one.

For me, it would be trying something new that's been on my mind for a long time, maybe a dessert I saw or a cool activity to learn about and possibly get into. I usually feel enriched when I’m just doing things, usually when it’s with my friends too, as it can feel lonely to just do it myself- though I don’t mind it at times because then I can really take my time.

I would also finally get stuff done that's been sitting on the back of my mind- I have a lot of “Work in progress” stuff happening so it feels like a relief when I finally just get it DONE!

1. If someone is upset with you, what is the typical reason for it? Give a recent example.

Misunderstanding them. I can be in my head a lot of times and if there's issues I can tend to.. assume things. Create a counter argument in my head in preparation without hearing them out because it feels more comfortable to have some sort of response in mind. 

1. What are you like when you're stressed? What are your coping mechanisms? Give an example of a recent stressful situation and how you handled it.

I can get a little reckless and I look scattered, I usually say things without thinking or mess up what I was meaning to say. When I'm just stressed, I get restless and look for something to keep my mind off of it. With long term stress I look outward, try to make plans with people, try to go shopping and just spend as little time at home so I'm not alone with my thoughts. I almost seem erratic at times. I'll be more talkative, drink more, spend money, and usually drink more coffee to keep myself going. It feels like time is passing faster and it makes me more anxious in the end.   

At work I can get really scattered, lose track of little things, but still handle it and get stuff done- however I’m jazzed!

1. What pushes your buttons? What makes you angry? How does your anger manifest? Can you be openly angry with others?

People who are just oblivious, or rude for zero reason. Flat out negative behavior or nit-pickiness can really annoy me like crazy. It truly takes a lot for me to get outwardly angry, but as it builds up I can get a little snippy, short, sassy and assertive. I’ll try to distract or not talk about it or acknowledge it as much as possible. I'm a person who can get angry then be fine and ready to move on in the next moment, as if nothing happened and not deal or feel it until way later- same with sadness.

I’m also just angry with how the world is and how little of an impact I could have to change it, that's frustrating.

1. What’s your deepest fear? Why is that your fear?

Not doing anything I had hoped to do in this lifetime, or wasting my life doing things that obviously make me unhappy. I hate the idea of having regrets, so I’m quick to leave when I have issues to look for what will be more fulfilling. It’s why I’ve never held a job past two years (bored or just sick of it- its a curse) or why I’m willing to cut off from things easily- because I put it into perspective. Of course I have empathy and try not to hurt anyone in the process, but I've unintentionally done so.

1. What types of memories cause you the most shame? What feelings cause you the most shame? What is it about them that causes you shame?

I don’t like to dwell on the past and thus when it comes up I seem kinda negative about it (According to my parents) and don’t want to talk about it. I know I didn’t know any better when I was younger, but I just don’t like the person I was in general.. I think it's because I grew up with low self esteem for a long time.  I’m a real forward thinker and focus on what could be instead.

1. What is your relationship with pleasure? What gives you pleasure? Can you have pleasure when you want it, or do you have to earn it?

Oh god I have the same relationship with pleasure like a yo-yo crash diet. I can think about the benefits of saving up for something big and good.. But then end up unconsciously spending it away getting myself a little coffee waaay too often. It’s either all in or I snap out of it and overly restrict myself and end up unhappy. I’ve found that what's been mending my relationship with pleasure is by finding new little things to try that don't break the bank- I have a hard time investing in anything.

I can have it when I want it, however if i'm not careful I can go overboard and get myself in trouble.

1. What’s your relationship with authority? Think both abstractly and with specific authorities in your life, possibly your parents, boss, religious leader, doctor, or government figures? Are you an authority?

Parents? Love and respect them but they don’t and never would affect what I want to do in life, they're pretty supportive. Boss? I respect them too, but I'm honestly a little bad about consistently following rules I find pointless unless I understand them. I’ve had many bosses and get along with them well and perform well, but I don’t stay long. Religious leaders? I don’t like them when they are forceful or push shame and fear onto people, they should be a gentle guide that is willing to help if people so choose too. I’m pretty disconnected from politics but unless it's something really effective against my autonomy. I usually don’t pay much attention- I usually feel like there's more things that take precedence.

I'm an authority to myself, that's for sure. I could probably use a little self policing.

1. When your mind wanders, what are you thinking about?

Things I wanna do or to get done, ideas for crafts or fun projects I wanna try, if there's a conflict in my life I'm usually trying not to worry myself over it and engage with my environment harder.

1. You have a big decision to make. Describe how you decide what to do.

Weigh the pros and cons, what I would enjoy more, think about whether it's a one time thing or if it’s an opportunity I'll have again and then decide.

1. What’s your biggest flaw?

I have so many ideas, plans, lists or potential and awesome things I could be doing and I don’t follow them through.  (also money is a factor soooo) I've been working on a painting project for a year and If I sat down to do a little of it each day I could've been done by now- but It just stresses me out!

1. What makes you special? (Or, if you don't feel special, what at least makes you different from other people?)

I’m genuine and connect with people deeply when I’m in a good place. I feel like I can have a good underlying care and concern with people even if we disagree about something. Unconditional.

1. How much of your mental energy is spent on thinking about each of the past, the present, and the future?

The future, I've been told I'm forward thinking and I’m really excited to see what awaits, which can cause me to be dissatisfied with the present. People tend to tell me to slow down and to find gratitude in the now, I do admit that's another flaw! Though I do notice I tend to bring up the past when It’s something I found funny, profound or when I’m trying to relate to someone. 

1. You unexpectedly find yourself with a whole weekend with no obligations, and everyone else is busy. How do you feel about it? What do you do?

I do what I want, whatever that is whenever. Maybe take the opportunity to kick myself into getting stuff done that needs to get done (Unrealistic but Ideal haha) I’d feel bad about wasting the weekend not learning something new or getting something off my back.

1. What’s your personal vibe/style/aesthetic? How cultivated vs natural is it, and how much time do you spend on it? Do you turn it on and off?

People have said I give “elf” or “woodland nymph hanging with animals in the forest” vibe and I LOVE it. It’s my passive goal to embody that and inspire others to do the same for themselves. I actually love it when people ask for my help and I can greet them with optimism and tell them THEIR vibes!

Very natural, no off on switch. forcing myself to be anything but would be lame and time consuming. I don’t spend much time on it or obsess, there’s other things I’m focused on usually. 

1. Which of the following is the most like you? Explain. A) I know what I want, I go out and make it happen, and people won't stop me. B) I am content to be on my own and not draw too much attention to myself. C) I have to be responsible and dedicated, and I put others’ needs first.

A- You can either join me or go your own way to do what you wish to do, but you won’t stop me from doing what I want. That being said, I have a hard time getting things done. I would say B second and C last but I do still love helping people when they ask for it. Work-trades are ideal.

1. Which of the following is most like you? Explain. A) I dislike stress and negative vibes, and I may try to distract myself from my problems. B) I have strong feelings, get worked up easily, and am not afraid to show it. C) I don’t like to let my feelings show; they get in the way of being efficient and logical.

A, but if it's REALLY ruining things I can face it.. Eventually. I’m not about toxic positivity but I can tend to be a little quick to forget and want to pretend it never even happened. B but I am afraid to show it and tend to unintentionally do so (I’ve been told what I’m feeling can be obvious and I don't like that!) and C in the way that I know it's the way to go when trying to make the best course of action possible. I relate to them all.

1. Which of the following is most like you? Explain. A) I look to others for feedback and guidance and am willing to be flexible when needed. B) I am always aware of how things could be better, and I’m disappointed that they are not. C) Deep down, I am afraid people won’t give me what I need unless I make it worth their while.

Most B, then A, then C.

B because I do find myself dissatisfied with reality half the time and the fact that it’s so limiting, as well as the fact that there’s so much unnecessary pain and suffering and not enough resources or focus on taking care of it. A, because I kind of lack self awareness and have a hard time seeing myself objectively, but at the same time know what and who I am. I always know I could be better and don’t mind pointers sometimes. C is last.. Because these things should come naturally. Like a natural benefit to both parties, I'm not gonna break my back to appease someone and keep score about it- at that point you should probably look for people who will give you what you need without holding it over your head.

I figured a thread on meet ideas might be fun or useful for people. I'm also looking for ideas from others, as I run a small comm out of a rural city and there's not much to do. I'm looking to create fun activities that people want to attend and that aren't too repetitive.:


Some meets that I've done successfully. Most of these are from my last comm in a bigger city.:


Sugar cookie decorating: we did this around Xmas, could also work for other holidays. Was fun and easy.


Chocolate molding and decorating: did this at a chocolate shop when I was in a bigger city comm. It's great around Valentine's. People really loved this one! A bit messier though.


Cat cafes: I've done this a few times with different comms, seems to go fine usually. Not too exciting, but a bit more fun than a standard cafe meet


Cafe (coffee, boba, etc.): speaks for itself. These are usually fine for smaller groups or groups that aren't too established yet. It's nice to just sit and get to know people or tack this on to the end of another meet to catch up.


Tea Party: a classic. They're expensive, but well worth the money for the experience. They're always well attended.


Art museum: this is a good meet for getting conversations going and taking unique photos! Most are free or cheap to enter too.


Craft meet: difficulty depends on the craft. I don't recommend this to a first time organizer. It takes a lot of planning to make sure you have EVERYTHING someone might need to do the craft and book an event space. (Assuming you're not doing this at someone's home).


Mall meet/ Build a Bear: These have been pretty fun. Build a bear is usually the main activity and then we'll branch out to the rest of the mall/shopping center. Bonus points if you go during a Hello Kitty truck event!


Movie theater: these are alright. Not very interactive but it can be fun to theme coords around the film. We went to the Barbie movie so it was pink EVERYTHING. I'd recommend planning to go to a cafe or grab a meal afterwards and discuss the film.


Selfie museum: if you have one of these near you it is so worth it! The amount of props and backdrops they have is top notch! This was probably one of my favorite meets.


Picnic/ park/ botanical garden: these are nice because they're low maintenance and pretty much free, but you have to be really careful of the weather. Having a small activity planned like a game or drawing is usually nice as well.


Some things I want to try now that I'm in a smaller town:


Arcade

Axe throwing- we'd def have to wear casual for this one

Going to the local zoo

PowerPoint meet- I've seen people do these on tiktok. Basically you make a PowerPoint on a topic you're passionate about and present to the group. You can be serious or silly with it. I'd prob do a library meeting room for this one.


What are some of your favorite meet activities? Any you really dislike? Any you want to try?

1htwdke,https://www.reddit.com/r/BariatricSurgery/comments/1htwdke/emotional_changes/,Emotional changes,"Hi Support Folk-

I’m almost three weeks post RNY (12/17). I’m having one of those days where it’s really hitting me how much of a life change I’ve made. I’m definitely feeling that “oh wow, my coping mechanism and connection to food as a comfort is now gone”. I absolutely knew this was going to be part of the process, but man, some moments it just smacks you in the face. I have a great relationship with both a psychiatrist and psychologist and physically I’m healing very well after surgery. 

How does/has everyone dealt with some of the grief and loss? I’d like some “tangible” ways or methods any of you have used. Therapy is helpful in understanding the overall goal and navigating the massive changes, but I don’t always have something practical in the moment. For example, my big vice before surgery was coffee drinks. Big, foo foo, sugary, Starbucks or Dutch bros drinks as my emotional comfort. When I wish I could go back to that, the sadness is really overwhelming. Basically, I know there’s no magic fix and it’s a lifelong process for sure. But I’d appreciate any insight, tips, commiseration, or anything you all have been through like this and can assure me it gets better! I will add that I just moved to soft food, so of course that still has me feeling limited in my eating every day for now. 

Thank you all in advance! Sometimes knowing it’ll be hard just isn’t enough once you’re actually experiencing it. ",4,1736047448.0,BariatricSurgery,7,1.0,False

My original shortlist was the:

\- Turin Legato

\- Gaggia Classic Pro

\- Solis Barista Perfetta Plus

\- Breville Bambino

\- Lelit Anna

After some advice on my OG post. I am heavily considering the **MiiCoffee Apex** which seems to be the same machine as the **Turin Legato** on my OG shortlist. So really either of these machines.

I really like the features regarding the dual PID for temperature control, the built in pressure gauge and OBV for pressure regulation, the dual broiler, the built in shot timer, and configurable pre infusion. It seems to have all the features I was looking for in a new upgrade machine. Also with it being on the budget friendly side at $499 it seems to be a slam dunk. Only downsides I see are that it doesn't have a dual pump but that is not an issue for me, and that its china made.

I was curious to see what reddit thought about the machine, and if they think its a worthwhile purchase or they had other recommendations I hadn't even considered. Any Advice is super appreciated!",1,1736047423.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I’m starting a superfood bar in India and I desperately need help naming it! The bar will focus on acai bowls, smoothies, coffee, matcha, and other healthy stuff. I want the name to be unique and not too obvious, something that feels like a vibe, much like how music artists and bands often have names unrelated to music but still become their identity.

Here’s what I’m considering so far:

	1.	Animal-Inspired Names: Something quirky and fun like “Lazy Panda” or “Kicking Goat.”
	2.	Names with Numbers: I’m open to cool combinations involving numbers. I like how Kendall Jenner has 818 which is the area code. 
	3.	Portuguese Words: Since my acai is being imported from Brazil, I thought it could tie into the brand. I really like the word “Sol” (meaning sun in Portuguese) and thought of something like Sol Cultures with a sunny yellow theme.
	4.	Personal Connection: I’m born in July and love the vibe of the word “July.” Maybe something summery like Summer Fridays?

I want the name to feel meaningful, either reflecting the food, the vibe of the brand, or something personal to me. It could even be something totally random that just sounds cool and becomes an identity of its own.

Not for a while but I have to start planning now so that we can save up for whatever I want to do. But I can't think of anything. I don't want to do anything, but I want to do something. I only have my family but I don't really enjoy being with them much either.

For my 16th, I had some family friends over for dinner and we did some painting. They invited over their 4 and 5 year old kids (they couldn't find a babysitter) and their 2 dogs (one's part chihuahua). No one wanted to paint, they spent the night complaining that they had nothing to do, the kids were screaming and squealing nonstop, and the dogs wouldn't stop barking. To make things worse, we had just gotten the news of my brother's diagnosis the night before. We were told he wouldn't make it another year. He was supposed to be there with us but he was in hospital in another city. I gave up eventually with painting and pulled out boardgames, but still people only half acted like they were enjoying themselves, my half-brother (who I'm closest to after my brother) sat in the corner on his phone the whole time.

Last year, I took the day off school. I went to get coffee with my half-brother, and we went to visit my brother at his house for a few minutes. This was the last time he recognized me. Then I went to rehearsals for a show I was working backstage for for 5 hours and ended up crying in the bathroom over my brother for half of that. The last thing I did that day was have dinner with my mum and sister, my dad showed up too even though I told him myself that he wasn't invited.

I don't know what to do now. 18th is supposed to be special but I don't know how to make it special. I don't have any friends. My family has gotten so messy, it's just my mum and younger sister now. I lost my brother late last year and I don't know how I'll handle my first birthday without him. I feel so alone.",2,1736047250.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

> ""Make the most of yourself....for that is all there is of you."" - Ralph Waldo Emerson

In the journey of self-improvement, we often seek strategies that can multiply our efforts efficiently. One such strategy is **habit stacking**, a concept popularized by S.J. Scott in his book ""Habit Stacking: 127 Small Actions to Improve Your Health, Wealth, and Happiness"". Habit stacking involves adding a new habit onto an existing one, leveraging the power of routine to foster growth in various aspects of life.

Here's how we can apply habit stacking in our personal development:

- **Motivation and Productivity:**  
  Start your day with a habit you already do, like brushing your teeth, and immediately follow it with a motivational activity, such as reading a page from a self-improvement book or listening to a short podcast episode. This can boost your motivation and set a productive tone for the day.

---


- **Overcoming Procrastination:**  
  If you struggle with procrastination, pair checking your email (a common daily habit) with setting a single, achievable task for the next hour. This small commitment can reduce the overwhelming feeling of starting and helps build momentum.

---

- **Improving Social Skills:**  
  After your daily coffee or tea, make it a habit to send a text or call a friend or family member. This not only enhances your social skills but also strengthens your relationships, which are crucial for emotional well-being.


---

- **Fitness:**  
  Link your morning shower with a quick stretch or a set of push-ups. This habit stacking can gradually increase your physical activity without needing a significant time commitment.

---


- **Mental Health:**  
  After dinner, before you relax with your favorite show or book, spend 5 minutes journaling or meditating. This can help manage stress and improve self-awareness, contributing to mental health.

---


- **Learning and Skills Development:**  
  Whenever you sit down to eat lunch, open an educational app or listen to an audiobook related to a skill you wish to develop. This habit can turn idle time into productive learning time.


---

- **Financial Health:**  
  When you pay your bills, take a minute to review your budget or savings goals. This small habit can keep you financially mindful and encourage better money management habits.

---


- **Time Management:**  
  After turning off your alarm in the morning, immediately plan your day's top three priorities. This habit ensures you start with a clear focus, reducing time wasted on less important tasks.

---


- **Nutrition:**  
  Pair making your morning coffee with preparing a healthy breakfast. This can lead to better eating habits over time, enhancing your overall health.


---


- **Sleep Hygiene:**  
  Before bed, after brushing your teeth, engage in a wind-down routine like reading or light stretching. This can signal to your body that it's time to sleep, improving sleep quality.


Habit stacking is about making small, manageable changes that compound over time. By integrating new habits with existing ones, we reduce the resistance to change and make self-improvement a seamless part of our daily lives.

Hiking, fishing, etc. Some ideas I have are zip lining, visiting a bio luminescent bay, snorkeling, spending a day or two at a beach. But I am very interested in specific recommendations for places to go. 
Also are there any places he could fish/how does fishing licensing work there? Is there anything I could plan ahead of time to make it easy? Our budged is pretty tight so if it’s too expensive we might have to skip it.

She said she never saw anyone to have absolutely no trace online, even through his family which she also searched. She knows he had a baby with another woman after they finished and that was a point of contention before they split. 
Fast forward to tonight, we were out for dinner and went to a pub for a few drinks afterwards. The night was going great and we were having lots of fun, the music was fantastic and that's something we both love. At some point I had to go to the bathroom and when I returned, she mentioned that she was texting another ex. 

He had seen a pic online of the two of us out and had messaged her saying she looked great and he hoped all was well with her. She then asked if I'd mind if she went for a cup of coffee with him (she wanted to ask him out for coffee) and I said to be fair I don't think I'd be overly comfortable with that and she said that's fine I won't ask. After awhile I wasn't feeling as lively as I was and I realized that I was feeling a bit defeated by her wanting to go for coffee with her ex. I want to make this perfectly clear, I wasn't loud, I wasn't angry, I didn't curse or say anything bad to her, I told her I felt a bit weird about her wanting to meet up with an ex and just wanted to clear the air about it and that it made me feel weird and uncomfortable. She got super defensive and started telling me I was overreacting, that she never actually felt anything for this guy and that she felt bad for him. I said that's fine but it still didn't dismiss the fact that I felt uncomfortable about the whole situation. She started to get angrier at me and started cursing, saying I was a dick and ruined the night and that I was totally irrational. I told her I wasn't trying to start a fight that I was just trying to be open and communicate with her about how I felt. Literally anything I said just made her angrier. Eventually, after trying to talk to her multiple times and getting shouted at I dropped it and told her to forget I said anything. She just sat there with her arms folded. Eventually, I just said ok, I want to head home and she started giving out again saying I ruined the night and nothing I could say would reach her or calm her down so I just got my coat said I was going home and left. About 5 minutes later I felt bad for leaving her there on her birthday night out and returned. I tried talking again only to be met with more aggression so I said right, I'm heading home, if you want to get a taxi with me you better come now and I left the pub. When I got outside she wasn't behind me so I text and said I'd wait for 10 minutes and if she wasn't out by the I would head home alone. She just about came out on time and we went home. 


She's upstairs now, I'm sitting in the kitchen feeling like crap and like I'm invalidated by feeling how I did.  I know for a fact if I were to be messaging an ex asking to meet up for a coffee, she would have an absolute fit about it. I mentioned as much to her earlier and that was met with aggression too. I'm feeling a bit lost right now and I guess I just needed to vent. 


Tl,Dr, partner was messaging an ex while we were out together for dinner and drinks and completely lost it when I told her it made me uncomfortable. I'm feeling lost right now, I guess I just needed a vent. Am I wrong for feeling the way I did? ",1,1736046704.0,amiwrong,3,1.0,False

I'm fluent in Spanish, c1 in English and a1 in Portuguese.

A little about me:

I'm a Cancer, so naturally, I adore the sea and tend to be emotional. (P.S. I don’t believe in horoscopes, though!)

I’ve traveled a lot—visited over 15 countries across America, Europe, and Asia. My favorites so far are Japan, Thailand, and Argentina.

I enjoy deep conversations as much as light-hearted ones. I’m curious and always excited to learn about what drives other people’s passions.

Coffee, dogs, scuba diving, karaoke, hiking, and trying new foods are my thing!

I’m an introvert who genuinely loves socializing.

I have a boyfriend whom I’m deeply in love with, so if you’re here for anything other than friendship, I’m not the person for you.


Looking forward to connecting and sharing some good chats!

1htw463,https://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/1htw463/calling_out_the_mtb_industryculture_on_its_bs_aka/,Calling out the MTB industry/culture on its BS - AKA Karma Carpet Bombing,"Opinionated post regarding MTB industry and the culture as a whole.  Bring on the karma bombs or contribute your own.

1. **Tight/techy usually doesn't mean fun**.  Balancing a knife on my chin with my wiener out is also a challenge.  Also not fun. Tech flow is the most modern trail type and best of both worlds and synergizes the best with modern bikes/geo.  It's ok if you're old and like slow, tight, techy trails on old bikes. Those trails will still be around, however, they won't grow the sport.  Kids get bored with this and get made fun of for wearing lycra. Kids don't want to be made fun of. Revelation, right?
2. **Skinnies are dumb and not fun**. Getting injured walking down a stairway sounds less dumb than saying you fell off your bike riding on a plank.
3. **Mountain bike geometry sucked until about 10 years ago.** Early MTBs were slack-modified beach cruisers. Then Specialized came along, turned them into road bikes with knobbies, and the industry stayed that way until around 2010. Once the industry broke away from roadie weight weenies and started taking inspiration from moto, things finally improved. Feel free to Google/Youtube it, there are some excellent free documentaries out there.
4. **Flow trails ≠ beginner trails**.  I love the IMBA trail building book, but this part is dated and now wrong.  Relates to #1 as well.  To make a green or blue flow trail black, add features, or make it in gnarlier areas.  Don't make it slow with junky, tight turns that my arse can't even fit through.
5. **Mullet bikes with a wider rear tire are objectively best.** Look at moto for proof. A bigger front tire only makes sense if most of your weight is over the front, which is rarely the case—especially with the recent trend of shorter chainstays. Longer chainstays might reverse this, but for now, wider in the rear is where it’s at. And yes, I understand using a wider front if your rear rim isn’t wide enough to prevent burps or pinches.  At the very least, making the rear tire significantly smaller ""just cause"" is silly.  Also, modern geo makes it almost as easy to save a front slide as it does on the rear.  Listen to your hands (and your inner ears), they communicate what your front is doing.
6. **Your fall-line trail on flat terrain with tight turns and traversy bumps as ""tech"" sucks.** Objectively. From every standpoint: sustainability, fun, and wear and tear on the bike. Just admit you like doing HIIT workouts on a (probably 26-inch, 75° HTA) ""mountain"" bike. If your fall-line trail is on the side of a steep mountain, however, rock on!
7. **New bikes aren't ""too big"".  You just don't know how to ride them**.  I've been riding since 2004.  Bikes prior to 1x, tubeless with modern rim widths, >65 deg HTA, slack seat tubes and short reaches all just objectively suck and are inferior in almost every way.  Moto figured out slack HTA and mullets in the 70s.  We've finally figured this out.  Left the sport for better 2 wheeled options because the equipment sucked.  Came running back when I learned of droppers and modern standars mid 2010s.  Feel free to google how Honda entered UCI downhill and dusted the field with a bike that took its design inspiration from moto (Greg Minaar also helped a wee bit).
8. **It's obvious many MTB companies don't know how to run a business**.  Almost needless to say.  A positive demand shock essentially sent many out of business.  It's pathetic. Feel free to educate me on my incorrect opinion.
9. **If you’re an MTB company and not embracing eMTB, modern geo/standards, or innovating in other ways, you deserve to go out of business.** There’s no excuse for being just another tube-welding, small car–price-charging, made-in-\[insert developing nation\] brand. Innovate or fade away.  Or price your bike like a bike and not a Tesla.
10. **WD40 is hydrocarbons.  Your special $50 snake oil ""chain lube"" is also hydrocarbons**. So is automotive oil and plenty of other petrol derivatives. Don't poo poo me in your lycra telling informing me my bike will spontaneously combust or disintegrate because I'm using it.  Didn't fall off the turnip truck yesterday. Sustainable lube notwithstanding.
11. **Don't expect your shiny new, hand cut XC MTB park to be popular without sustained descents, features, and flow in an MTB park saturated market**.  Hope you enjoyed the workout though.  It's frustrating to see some orgs put a lot of effort into the same stuff that only benefits the same people (let's be real here, usually old white people with money/time).  We need to grow the sport. Let's change it up!  It's interesting to note the vastly more diverse clientele (namely younger and less white) at a downhill/skills oriented park than one more suited for the lycra/morning coffee crowd.  We really need to not become the Harley Davidson of recreation.
12. **Your elitism sucks and makes normal people hate you and not want to do the sport.** We get it, you're a young professional gunning for KOMs on your Yeti (sorry folks, couldn't resist). Take that attitude back to road biking. Lay off the kid learning the sport on his Wal Mart bike, will ya? Also, people do this sport often to relax and meditate.  Leave your Type A in the office, k?

Also, please please please study the basics of trail-building before whacking out your 12 in wide, traversy, duffy trail in the woods that the first significant storm will render non-existent.  The IMBA book is a great option.  ESPECIALLY if you're using folks' hard earned donations or gov resources to do so.

On the other hand, if you live in the middle of nowhere with a dearth of trails, of course, just buy some land, shake hands, or make arrangements, and build something.  There are plenty of eager folks willing to help and volunteer, we just need the initiating push! Ffs, we Americans need to start getting outside again.  We're losing some of that post Covid energy!

Otherwise, to balance out the negativity, I can confidently say MTB is still the most fun, accessible, speedy sport that connects folks with nature and promotes conservation.  All good things!  We just need to grow so fewer companies go out of business and we keep the youth involved!",0,1736046620.0,MTB,30,0.29,False

1htw18g,https://www.reddit.com/r/cna/comments/1htw18g/ma_vs_pct_job_offer/,MA vs PCT - Job Offer,"Hey Reddit,  
I'm in a bit of a dilemma and would love some advice. I currently work as a Medical Assistant (MA) at a clinic, but I’ve been offered a Patient Care Technician (PCT) job at a hospital. Here’s a breakdown of both options:

**My Current MA Job**  
- **Pay:** $16.00/hour  
- **Schedule:** 5 shifts a week, typically 8-9 hours  
- **Location:** 2 minutes away from home  
- **Benefits:** I have to wait 3-6 months to qualify for benefits  
- **Flexibility:** The clinic is willing to offer half shifts for the days I need to go to class (I’m starting Anatomy and Physiology soon)  
- **Work Environment:** It’s a little slow and repetitive for me, but it’s easygoing and close to home  
- **Perks:** Food from reps 1-2 times a week, which is a nice little benefit

**PCT Job (Hospital)**  
- **Pay:** $16.80/hour  
- **Schedule:** 3 shifts a week, each 12 hours (I actually like longer shifts - less days to work)  
- **Location:** 45-minute commute each way (so 5+ hours of commuting between work, school, and home)  
- **Benefits:** Eligible for benefits just after 30 days  
- **Time Off:** With 4 days off per week, I’d have more time for school, which is a big plus  
- **Work Environment:** I’ve worked in hospitals before (unit clerk, telemetry tech, and PCT), and I loved the fast-paced environment. I’m excited about this opportunity.  
- **Perks:** A coffee shop and a full cafeteria with great food options, which is a nice bonus

**The Dilemma:**  
I really like the idea of working in the hospital again because I’ve enjoyed the environment in the past, and it’d be a nice change from my current clinic role, which is starting to feel slow and repetitive. Plus, the PCT job offers better pay, benefits sooner, and more time for school with the 4 days off. The only catch is the long commute (45 minutes each way), which will add up, especially since my school is also 35 minutes away.

I’m also considering the MA job's flexibility—half shifts when I have class—and the fact that it's so close to home, meaning less time spent commuting.

**Questions:**  
- Does the hospital PCT job sound worth the commute and longer shifts, considering the pay bump and benefits?  
- Will the 5+ hours of commuting per week (between work and school) be too much to handle alongside school?  
- Is the flexibility and proximity of my current MA job worth staying in a somewhat slower and repetitive environment?  

I’d love to hear if anyone has experience with this kind of decision, especially balancing work, school, and commuting. Thanks in advance for any advice or personal experiences you can share!",1,1736046353.0,cna,0,1.0,False

This friend and I have been friends on and off for several years but we usually reconnect or catch up via text or meet for coffee. Over the last two years we've tried to make plans but they always fall through (my friend would cancel day of due to work or something) which is fine bc life happens and i get it, but they always seem eager to want to meet up or reschedule. I ran into them at a store and I stopped them to say hello and it was a quick exchange but ended with ""I'll get back to you about a date to hangout"" and I've been left on read for over a year. Looking back on our friendship, I noticed that I was always starting convos, reaching out, wishing them hbd, sending little fun gifts for milestones, always being their cheerleader, Etc. And I've received none of that in return, which is fine bevasue I never expected that, but now it's feeling like the friendship was one sided. My friend would engage in convos in a way that made it seem like they were interested but would often leave me on read in the middle of conversations which left me feeling foolish or that I bothered them. I used to consider this person a best friend of mine but I'm thinking that wasn't the case.

On top of that, my friend has always been able to capture an audience and gain a ton of following across all social media platforms and my friend has always been super successful with their career. The issue is, I am constantly viewing their socials, almost daily. And if they post, I will immediately feel horrible about myself. My career is not spectacular and I think that's a huge insecurity of mine which is probably why I compare myself to their career even when I don't even want to do what they do for work. I just always imagine their future being so successful and what business they'll open next and it makes me feel like shit and I'm honestly depressed and dont even know what i want to do with my own life.

My friends and family say ""block them and move on"" but I am having such a hard time accepting that this friendship is over and they have moved on to much bigger and better things than me. I also feel so selfish that i feel this way because i should be happy that their life is going well and that they seem genuinely happy. I've had a lot of friendships phase out over time, that's life. But for some reason I'm comparing myself to this friend so much that I can't let go and I feel so embarassed. Recently I saw them at a shop with other friends and I passed by like strangers and all i thoguht about was if my outift looked good enough and what they mightve thought of me and how sad I was that neither of us said hi. Ive considered reaching out to them but I dont feel comfortable doing that. This is an issue I need to deal with within myself but its been hard. Has this happened to anyone else?

If you want the boldness of black to take center stage, use it on larger surfaces like walls, furniture, or flooring. On the other hand, if you prefer a more subtle touch, keep the base color neutral—like white or gray—and use black as an accent color, introducing gold as embellishments.

### Incorporate Textures

Textures play a crucial role in home decor. Mixing different materials enhances the overall aesthetic. Consider using matte black paint on your walls combined with shiny gold accents. This contrast adds depth and interest to your design. You can also include textured fabrics, such as velvet or silk in black, paired with gold embellishments or trim. This approach elevates the visual appeal while maintaining a cohesive theme.

### Focus on Furniture Selection

When selecting furniture, look for pieces that embrace both black and gold. For example:

- **Coffee Tables:** A black coffee table with gold legs or accents can serve as a statement piece.
- **Chairs:** Consider upholstered chairs in black, with gold nailhead trim for an inviting touch.
- **Shelves:** Black shelves paired with gold brackets will not only be functional but also stylish.

Choosing the right furniture creates a harmonious blend of these two colors in your space.

### Accentuate with Accessories

Accessories are the cherry on top of your decor. To effectively combine black decor with gold accents, focus on selecting decorative items that marry both colors. Here are some ideas:

- **Throw Pillows:** Opt for black pillows with gold patterns or embellishments to add comfort and style to your seating.
- **Artwork:** Choose black frames for your artwork while incorporating gold elements in the pieces themselves.
- **Candlesticks:** Gold candlesticks on a black mantelpiece can create a striking focal point.

These accessories not only reflect your style but also tie everything together beautifully.

### Lighting is Key

Lighting can make or break your decor. Go for light fixtures that showcase both colors. For instance, a black chandelier with gold accents can add elegance to dining rooms or entryways. Table lamps combining black bases and gold shades can enhance the cozy feel of your space. Remember to layer your lighting with ambient, task, and accent lights to create a warm atmosphere.

### Balance is Important

When mixing these two colors, maintaining balance is essential. Too much of either color can overpower the other. Aim for a ratio of about 70% black to 30% gold. This way, you ensure that gold accents shine without overwhelming the black decor. You can balance the color scheme further by spreading out your gold pieces throughout the space instead of clustering them in one area.

### Nature's Touch

Plants can soften the boldness of black and gold decor. Consider adding greenery to your environment with black pots or planters that have gold detailing. Plants break the monotony and enhance the vibrancy of your decor. They introduce a refreshing element that compliments your color scheme beautifully.

### Experiment with Patterns

Patterns can add another layer of interest to your decor. Try incorporating geometric patterns that feature both black and gold. This could be in wallpaper, curtains, or rugs. Strategic use of patterns can guide the eye and create focal points in your design.

By following these techniques for harmoniously combining black decor with gold accents, you can transform your space into a chic and inviting environment. Remember, the key is to maintain balance, experiment with different textures, and select the right accessories. With a little creativity, your interior will come to life in a stunning way that reflects your unique style.

The combination of black and gold is not just a trendy choice; it holds psychological significance that can influence the ambiance of a space. Understanding how these two colors interact can help you create environments that resonate with sophistication, power, and warmth.

### Creating Harmony with Black and Gold

Combining black and gold is about finding the right balance. Here are effective strategies to achieve this harmonious mix:

- **Accent Pieces:** Start by using black as the dominant color in your room. Then, add gold through accessories like cushions, picture frames, or decor items. This creates a striking contrast without overwhelming the space.
- **Features and Focal Points:** Consider painting an accent wall in black and incorporating gold light fixtures or artwork to create a stunning focal point. The interplay of these colors can draw attention and create visual interest.
- **Textures:** Mix materials to enhance the effect. Use matte black finishes paired with shiny gold elements. Textured fabrics in black and metallic accents can create a sophisticated look.
- **Layering:** Layer different shades of black with varied tones of gold. This adds depth and dimension, making the space feel dynamic and rich.
- **Lighting:** Good lighting is essential. Use warm lighting to highlight gold elements, ensuring that they shine brightly against black backgrounds.

- **Lounges:** Create an inviting yet sophisticated atmosphere in a living area or lounge.
- **Offices:** Embed a sense of professionalism with a touch of luxury in your workspace.
- **Dining Rooms:** Set the stage for elegant dinners and gatherings with a mix of these powerful colors.

### Conclusion

Combining black decor with gold accents can transform your space into a sophisticated oasis. Employing techniques like accessorizing with gold fixtures or incorporating patterned textiles allows for a seamless blend that enhances visual appeal.

I glanced at the TV, where the news anchor’s face was a mask of grim concern.  
*“Authorities are investigating the growing number of disappearances. Victims include late-night joggers, unsupervised children, and elderly individuals walking alone…”*

*""It’s terrifying,""* Sarah said, her eyes darting to the locked door. *""Everyone’s scared.""*

I’ve started a blog called **3AMDeploy**, where I document real-world IT issues I encounter and the solutions I come up with (usually fueled by late-night coffee and stubborn determination). It’s not a discussion-heavy blog—just straight-up practical fixes, lessons learned, and occasional head-smacking moments from the trenches of IT.

I do not have much free time , but I'd like to post some experiences & fixes every week.

Honestly, don't know if the main goal is to vent out, or just to share some of my findings..

Here’s the idea:

* **Short, actionable posts** about solving common (and uncommon) sysadmin problems.
* **Step-by-step guides** for troubleshooting and fixes.
* Focused on **sharing practical solutions** rather than debating best practices.

I’d love your input on a few things:

1. **What’s the #1 type of issue you’d like to see tackled?**
2. **Do you find a blog like this helpful for day-to-day sysadmin life?**
3. **Any tips for making the content more useful or engaging?**

The goal is to make it a go-to resource for sysadmins looking for quick, practical answers to IT headaches—delivered in a relaxed, relatable tone (because who doesn’t need a laugh during work hours?).

Thanks in advance for any feedback, ideas, or even just a quick opinion on whether this sounds useful!

1htvutp,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/comments/1htvutp/prty_grl_beauty_perfume_oils/,prty grl beauty perfume oils,"heyy so i was going to comment this under someone's post but i think it was too long and failed to post. So here's my review of 16 of this brand's perfume oils

I own all the scents except 2 so let me give my honest opinion about them bc I think it should be out there. (I'm not suuuper well versed in scent terms though so keep that in mind)

first of all, I super love these. I'm really into scents and have too many and I need to stop buying them but this is my exception I want to own every oil this brand puts out. I wear them for myself to smell, so idk how other people perceive it, but for me it lasts about 45 minutes until I need a top up (I wear the oil on my neck). Really great value for money too, I use these all the time and I've never noticed a dent in any except soft vanilla (my most used) and even that was small. they're not single note, most of them are really complex and have a good blend of harmonic notes. they're also not overwhelming or headache inducing like some smells can be.

I also have a few of the other products and I think the only smells i didn't like were fruity loops (gave me a headache) and the pomegranate body scrub (smelled like old lady), but all of the perfume oils were a hit for me

the two I don't own (yet) are lemon creme and pink sugar (i have like 4 coming in the mail as of writing also, maybe i'll edit this post when I get it). My favorite scents are clean and fruity, but I also like cake type scents and especially vanilla. spicy and cinnamon type scents aren't that exciting to me but also I don't dislike them at all.

from favorite to least favorite:

fruity snacks: I'm wearing this as of writing. It really does smell like fruit snacks, I'd say welches if I had to pick a brand. But like tropical flavor welches. no overwhelming artifical fruit flavor. its pretty much everything i want from a fruity smell.

soft vanilla: this one is vanilla forefront with like a backdrop of like a fuzzy blanket in front of a fireplace type of feeling. not quite cakey or sugary, but as opposed to vanilla powder its more sweet. probably I wore this one more than fruity snacks, but that's only because I've had it longer.

flower fields: This is a really awesome floral scent. It smells like a bunch of like fancy bathroom products in a fancy clean home or something. Or a giant bouquet. smells like digging your nose so far in a flower you get pollen on your nose. It doesn't really have earthy scents, just floral

cozy sugar: melon sorbet and cozy sugar tied for this place. It does smell like sugar, like the fancy kind that's brown and comes in big chunks and gets sprinkled on top of cookies for texture. it is cozy as the name suggests and has a little bit of an earthy smell. sort of similar to soft vanilla, I suspect they have a shared ingredient

melon sorbet: this one kind of gives watermelon jolly rancher, but only like 50%. it's like if jolly rancher made a honeydew flavor. it's fresh and nice. not super sugary, but it does smell sweet in the way a fruit popsicle might.

juicy mango: this one is really great. It's not a typical mango or ""tropical"" scent, it smells like the peel of a mango. Like that sort of scratchy part that isn't as good as the middle but mangos are so good so you don't want to waste any. it's definitely a ripe mango scent, like idk if they found out what chemical makes mangos smell like that and then bottled it, but that's what it feels like. it's awesome

white mocha: this one surprised me and I liked it more than I thought I would given I don't like or drink mocha. It smells like a fancy person's house who has a drink mixer and is making stuff. Or one of those fancy gyms that sells drinks in the lobby. it's definitely sweet, but not overpowering at all.  it has this sort of clean room scent that doesn't sound like it would go with the sweet scent, but somehow they harmonize like crazy.

the rest I don't have as strong of an opinion on so I'll just list them. None of these smell bad, the ones on top are just my favorites

strawberry cake: It does smell a lot like bath and body works strawberry pound cake, but only like 80%. to be honest I prefer bath and body works one more. They both have a really similar cake smell there, but the bath and body works one smells like freshly sliced strawberries and this one smells like a strawberry syrup, more artificial. But I think this is still good though, and I wear it in combination with the body mist

milky coconut: This is a great coconut scent. It is artificial, but it doesn't give me a headache like some artificial coconut scents do. the coconut comprises like 60% of the scent, and the rest is like almost a soap sort of smell. like what i imagine cilantro tastes like to people with the cilantro soap gene (i dont have that). solid, not overpowering

vanilla powder: it does smell like vanilla but it's not cozy, it's like a fresh vanilla scent. also idk if it's just mine but i smell a hint of a vinegar scent. it's not as rich and complex as some of the other scents so i don't reach for it much

cake pop: This isn't a typical cake scent, it smells like a fancy cake from a bakery, but also somehow isn't super sugary. I can smell the frosting but it's not forefront. It's definitely got some spice scents in there, but they aren't super strong. pretty good, this one is complex and interesting.

vanilla bean: does smell much like vanilla bean noel from bath and body works, but on the contrary to strawberry cake i actually prefer this version. vbn is stronger on the nutty scent and this is stronger on the vanilla scent. they also smell like different nut kinds? this perfume has a more rounded out vanilla scent than vbn and i like that.

princess peach: this is giving like 30% peach smell. that is actual and not artificial peach, but the rest is a clean smell. almost floral. there's no other dominant smell other than peach, so I believe it's a mix of different notes making that happen. maybe a hint of raspberry? something pleasantly sour.

warm cream: it's definitely a cream smell, like smelling the whipped cream on top of a hot chocolate or coffee. it's got a cozy scent similar but not identical to cozy sugar and soft vanilla. mildly sugary, but only like 10%. some sort of spice blend scent in there as well

whipped spice: i'm not very good with describing spice like scents, i'll try though. a lot of spice scents are like 💥CINNAMON💥 then call it a day and this is not that. maybe cinnamon is there but it's not forefront. I smell pumpkin, maybe cloves if i'm remembering correctly what cloves smell like. nutmeg? idk don't take this one too seriously. it also has a cream scent similar to warm cream but less prominent. very complex and nice

ginger latte: this one smells more like cookies to me than cake pop does... it's got this really nice bakery scent. a little bit of a cream scent to it and of course a spice blend. it's not in your face ginger but i do smell it in there holding hands peacefully with the other smells and not kicking their asses. smells like something nice coming out of the oven

1htvlfc,https://i.redd.it/qtnj8x0y83be1.jpeg,Painted edges tutorial no one asked for,"So I've been really into painted edges lately (last few months or a
year :D) and I've been trying to perfect it, because agsjjdhdhh I love
it.

I have tried few methods, and since I suk at taking videos and pics
Imma try to explain in case it helps someone.

For all the methods below sanding the edges is the most important. you
gotta sand and when you think its enough - sand more, untill its even
and smooth - it has to be even and smooth!

First and cheapest and easiest is painting with it in one color with
acrylic paint. If I want one even color I do it with acrylic paint and
a sponge after I paint it and its dry I lightly send it down with very
gentle sand paper, this makes pages not stick and makes the edge very
smooth and looks like fabric made

Spray gun, with thinned acrylic paint this is very good method it
paints the paint in a very thin layer and pages wont stick, but good
guns are expensive.

Both of these methods can be combined with cutting out stencil and
using them to paint images

3. And the newest method I tried that you can see in the picture is
doing it with an inkjet printer.

You would need:

*an inkjet printer

*a paper that doesnt absorb color, it could be the backside of any
sticker paper or a plastic see through foil, like those that are used
for plastification

*book with smooth sanded edge

You would make the image and print it on the paper that doesn't absorb
color. Also when you are printing it, you want the setting to be for
glossy paper, this will make the printer print very slowly and the
colors wont smudge.

When the printer is done painting, you want to pull the paper
carefully or you will smudge the image with your fingers.

You would need to have a very steady hand, I personally as a smoker
and heavy coffee drinker struggle with this, but good luck to you.

Place a light light light layer of glue on the book edge very light
and water-down, this makes the image have more vibrant colors on the
book edge. Make it light so that you can crack the edge after. Without
this step I have noticed that the image turns out very light in color.
But it is good if you want just the draft of your image on the edge so
u can hand paint over it.

If you have patience leave the image to dry for like few hours, this
makes the chances of it smudging on the book lower. The glue on the
edge should dry so that it doesn't disolve the paint and make it
bleed, but not completely dry so that you dont feel it under your
fingers.

Pros and cons of the paper you print on:

printing on the back of the sticker paper has lower chance of the
bleed on the book happening, but it is more difficult to get the image
precisely in the place you want it- since you cant see through it, it
is good if its a large pattern on the image because then you don't
have to worry to get it as precise on the book.

printing on the plastic foil is good because you can see through the
foil and and get it just right on the edge, but the foil doesnt absorb
paint even a little and if you dont wait for ink to somewhat dry it
will smudge on the edge.

So try both let me know what worked for you, maybe we can perfect the
method together.

Very important thing when you press the image to the edge, steady
hands steady hands, and not moving it up or down or smudging it, put
it on and once you press it theres no going back. It is difficult but
possible, if you have someone you trust they can help press the image
while you hold it or maybe you have 3 hands that could also work. I
dont have someone to press it with me so i just pray :D.

Sometimes some parts wont transfer , but if its a small part you can
fill it in with some other method brushes, pencil whatever.

P.S I also tried printing on the sticky side of the paper (dont do
this, or you would have to print on a white paper few times to clean
your printer inside-it dirties it.

I'm a Cancer, so naturally, I adore the sea and tend to be emotional. (P.S. I don’t believe in horoscopes, though!)

I’ve traveled a lot—visited over 15 countries across America, Europe, and Asia. My favorites so far are Japan, Thailand, and Argentina.

I enjoy deep conversations as much as light-hearted ones. I’m curious and always excited to learn about what drives other people’s passions.

Coffee, dogs, scuba diving, karaoke, hiking, and trying new foods are my thing!

I’m an introvert who genuinely loves socializing.

Some sad news lol. My coworker crush (28F) is leaving, with next week being her last. Over the past year, we’ve had several 1:1s, and she’s been a huge help to me at work. She’s brilliant, strong, confident, and incredibly smart—pretty much everything you could ask for. So, when she told me she put in her two weeks' notice, I was naturally devastated.

I decided to do a pre-goodbye, and we talked about whether we’d keep in touch after she leaves. It was funny because she called me dramatic for saying goodbye, even though she mentioned we could still talk. But one thing that threw me off during our conversation was when we were walking, and I glanced at the ground while saying something like, ""I’ll miss you."" I happened to catch the corner of my eye, and I noticed her head snap toward me, like she was surprised or maybe even a little confused/weirded out maybe? I couldn't tell tbh. I didn’t look at her directly, but her reaction definitely caught me off guard.

I was a little surprised by her response. It seems like everyone else at the company has said something similar to her, but her reaction was different—almost like she didn’t expect it. What do you think? Should I take this as a good sign or a bad one?

To continue the conversation, we talked about her plans to move closer to her family(Ill be in New York she will be in Boston), and she mentioned that we could still keep in touch since I have her number. I don’t actually have her number yet, but I plan to get it next week. I was thinking of asking her if she’d like to grab coffee sometime and chat a bit more.

1htvcpi,https://i.redd.it/rsrnef6p63be1.jpeg,Review of our week in Sedona at Christmas time 2024,"I figured I’d share my review of wife and I spending a week in Sedona during the week of Christmas. 

We’d never been to AZ prior to this. We stayed at a VRBO one block from Uptown and it was lovely. Rustic and cozy but modern. Fantastic view from our room of the red rocks. 

The average temp in Sedona during that week is 57 degrees Fahrenheit. So we were a bit concerned that it could end up being quite cold, and that we could even have snow. We chose the location in part because it’s a warmer than average location in the US for this time of year. 

Fortunately the weather was just spectacular. For the first four days it was in the mid 60s. Lots of folks walking around in shirt sleeves and shorts. And the last three days it dropped to mid to high 50s—which surprisingly we actually liked a little better since the combination of cool air and warm sun was invigorating. I was perfectly comfortable doing some fairly easy trails on those days wearing sweat pants and just tee short and a light sweater. We had beautiful sunny weather with some clouds the entire time. We were treated to an especially gorgeous sunset on Christmas Eve. 

We didn’t plan a single thing beforehand. But since we planned to visit the Grand Canyon, once we arrived we decided to book a “Grand Canyon train tour” via a well known travel site. The description online made it seem to us naive first-time travelers that the 11 hour excursion would be mostly aboard the train—when in fact the train ride was just a two hour-ish leg of the journey to get to the south rim that in hindsight we could have done without. Regardless, the guide was very likable and we did have a great time overall. She took us to some spectacular views of the south rim and explained the geological theories of the canyon, etc. 

The Grand Canyon is of course visually mind-blowing. It is indeed “must-see.” But somewhat surprisingly we were more impressed with the natural beauty of the red rock formations in Sedona and the surrounding area. Throughout the entire stay we continually commented just how beautiful and stunning the red rocks are. Their details change depending on how light and shadow strike them, sometimes subtly and sometimes dramatically. So throughout the day there’s a slightly new way to appreciate their beauty. To be reminded that Nature can make scenery this sensational is exactly what our psyche needed. We literally never stopped marveling at the views. 

We didn’t book any tours for the canyon trails, we just drove to the trail heads, paid the $5 for the day, and walked the trails for a good while to get some incredible photos. We just did a few trails that are easy to moderate like Bell and Boynton, etc. If we ever return we’ll definitely check out the others we didn’t get to. There’s about seven of them that are very close to where we stayed if I recall correctly. But anyway, we were perfectly content just driving to the trail heads and taking in the physical beauty around us.

So I would say that the main thing that this stay offered was stunning scenery. That exceeded our expectations. It never got old for us. In fact the appreciation increased over the week to savoring the views versus the immediate psychological almost otherworldly impact of seeing it for the very first time when driving in. (Haha, like “whoa, is this even real?”)

The second main thing of value for us was the dining. It’s a tourist town so we were prepared to spend a fair bit for the fancier places to eat. Sedona has some damn good restaurants. Highlights were:

- Mariposa - “Latin inspired” modern American; we went on Christmas Day at sunset in their outdoor area to a beautiful sunset with plenty of heaters and were perfectly comfortable, the filet mignon was off the chain; had a the bonus of a great chat with the couple next to us; this was a peak dining experience

- Elote Cafe - superb southwestern cuisine; great ambience, they actually managed to seat us without a reservation during a busy time

- Hudson - modern American; wonderful ambiance, great dishes, incredible view, great service

- Shorebird - modern American; maybe a just a smidge too gourmet for our taste in that we found the flavors complex and subtle whereas we’d rather be wowed with punchier flavor profiles, but we were still happy with what we chose

- The Coffee Pot - classical American breakfast; we thought about some more gourmet places for breakfast but mainly opted for the traditional 

And even the less high end places we tried were quite good including Don Diego (Mexican) and the Sezchuan Restaurant. 

And the shopping is fairly good for a tourist town such as this, although we found the main items to serve as souvenir reminders of the trip we found off the main strip. Some delightful Oaxacan fantastical and colorfully painted “spirit animal” figures at the Coffee Pot gift shop, a lovely small flower vase at the El Tovar (Grand Canyon) gift shop, and a mid-sized flower vase at Son-Silver-West Galleries. Just memento stuff but things we’ll definitely value.

Anyway, it was a wonderful time. It exceeded our expectations. We’re thankful for our time Sedona, we hope to make it back one day!",5,1736044194.0,Sedona,0,0.86,False

Things that have helped:
WATER!! At least 1/2 oz per lb of body weight (I'm 140 and drink at least 90 oz)
EXERCISING - keep it light(er) and simple
ANTIHISTAMINES!!!
B-COMPLEX VITAMINS!!!
VITAMIN D, K, E, AND FISH OIL!!!
HYALURONIC ACID SUPPLEMENTS!!!
SLEEP!!! 7-9 HOURS (unless you're a teenager, then shoot for 8-10)
STEAM!!! Opens pores to help them purge
- Dry eyes: Optase eye drops
- Chapped lips: Jojoba or olive oil after steaming, followed by your favorite lip balm (I like shea butter and/or coco butter more than petroleum)
- Dry hair & skin: right out of the shower, apply an oil like jojoba, olive, almond, castor, sunflower, etc. I'm allergic to coconut but it's another great one for most people. 
Insomnia/anxiety: If it's legal for you, THC gummies helped me a lot with my sleep issues.

Things that made it worse:
- Al-coholic beverages. Just don't. 
- Sweets & junk/fast foods - get your fats and sugars from fruits, nuts, & vegetables as much as possible. If you eat like garbage, you'll feel like garbage. 
- Not exercising - move your body to keep your lymphatic system circulating! Sweat! Pump some oxygen to those sore joints! Don't over-do it, but don't get too sedentary! Go for a brisk walk. Pick up some light weights. Do some yoga. Get a massage if you hurt too much to move much on your own. BUT DO NOT SIT STILL ALL DAY! I've managed my fibromyalgia pain with diet and exercise for THIRTY YEARS!! Trust me!! 

Here's my general routine, as well as what helped most and made it worse:

Morning:
Steam face with a hot, wet washcloth for 2 minutes, gently rubbing away any dead skin when tolerable. Then apply Baby Eucerin Eczema Cream (and sunscreen if I plan to go out at all) 

Drink Coffee w/ 1/2 of a protein shake 
Take: Morning Dose (20mg), Claritin, Fish oil, Vitamin E, Vitamin D&K (all oil soluble) 

Breakfast: either (1 srvg. full fat plain yogurt w/ Omega trail mix) or (1/2 an avocado on an English muffin with everything bagel seasoning) or (everything bagel with cream cheese) 
Chug a 30 oz Stanley cup of water 
Drink an energy drink

11:00 AM
Take: Vitamin C, liquid B-complex, hyaluronic acid (can add any other water soluble supplements and/or ibuprofen as needed) 
Lunch: high protein, high fiber, low fat (1/2 cup of lowfat cottage cheese and 1/2 cup each of raspberries and blackberries) or (salad with grilled chicken) 
Chug a 30 oz Stanley cups of water
Drink a Joyburst (great for magnesium & potassium if you can find them in your area!) or other uncaffeinated drink.

6:00 PM
Weightlifting or hiking/walking briskly for an hour 
Chug a 30 oz Stanley cups of water
Dinner: meat & veggies
Take evening dose w/ Vitamin E 

Wash face in the shower with a mild cleanser (I like peach & lily's oil & gel dual cleanse). Steam after with hot, wet washcloth for 2 minutes and apply more Baby Eucerin Eczema Cream.

E.g. fill, steep, release, refill, steep again etc. 

Hey guys, so I bought two bags each of this coffee before I headed home to Europe over Christmas. When I travel alone, I usually just bring my small clever and c40 with me. Because I traveled with my wife I brought the aeropress so I can do the bypass recipe from J.Hoffmann where you grind quite fine (14clicks on c40), then add 240g for 3.5min, drain and then top up with another 160g. The coffees were fine. Nothing special however and I definitely couldn’t taste any of the tasting notes. I tried different grind settings and also different recipes. The J.H. One was definitely the best tasting I could get out of the AP for a two cup morning brew. Yesterday arrived back home in KL where I made a 2 cup v60 (also from J.H. Described in his book) and was blown away by the fruitiness from the Kenyan coffee. It was just day and night- like it was a different coffee. 
I don’t want to buy the big clever just for the travels with my wife and was wondering how I could get a 2cup brew out of the 1cup dripper when traveling and no gooseneck kettle is available. ",3,1736043597.0,pourover,0,0.8,False

I’ve got some sad news. My coworker crush (28F) is leaving, with next week being her last. Over the past year, we’ve had several 1:1s, and she’s been a huge help to me at work. She’s brilliant, strong, confident, and incredibly smart—pretty much everything you could ask for. So, when she told me she put in her two weeks' notice, I was naturally devastated.

I decided to do a pre-goodbye, and we talked about whether we’d keep in touch after she leaves. It was funny because she called me dramatic for saying goodbye, even though she mentioned we could still talk. But one thing that threw me off during our conversation was when we were walking, and I glanced at the ground while saying something like, ""I’ll miss you."" I happened to catch the corner of my eye, and I noticed her head snap toward me, like she was surprised or maybe even a little confused/weirded out maybe? I couldn't tell tbh. I didn’t look at her directly, but her reaction definitely caught me off guard.

I was a little surprised by her response. It seems like everyone else at the company has said something similar to her, but her reaction was different—almost like she didn’t expect it. What do you think? Should I take this as a good sign or a bad one?

To continue the conversation, we talked about her plans to move closer to her family(Ill be in New York she will be in Boston), and she mentioned that we could still keep in touch since I have her number. I don’t actually have her number yet, but I plan to get it next week. I was thinking of asking her if she’d like to grab coffee sometime and chat a bit more. Do you think I should go for it, or try something else?",1,1736043333.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False
1htv1u3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/1htv1u3/fellow_spoonies_unite/,Fellow spoonies unite!,"Hey Salt Lake, I (29F) am reaching out as a chronically-ill person in hopes of making some friends who share the same chronically challenging sort of life. Don’t get me wrong- my regular friends are so amazing, and I wouldn’t trade them for the world- but often times it can still feel isolating when you’re surrounded by comparatively healthy folks. And as we all know, loneliness can lead to a nasty depression. 

The chronically-ill crowd catches a lot of flak and is regularly misunderstood by both peers and professionals. The stigma surrounding our conditions is something we have to face every day and it is actively harmful and invalidating. So please, if you have any remarks that may be snideful, prideful, or bigoted, consider sitting yourself in a corner instead of posting here. 

Knowing that fatigue is an enormous obstacle for many of us, I want to be realistic and flexible in arranging meet-ups or even just in exchanging messages. Things can take longer for us, including developing friendships and socializing. 

To those of you still reading:

My name is Brooke, I use she/they pronouns, and since getting sick in 2022 I am still working on learning new hobbies and figuring out how to enjoy this new life. My life used to be centered around the outdoors and an active lifestyle, but now it looks more like an old lady’s life than anything. Imagine books, puzzles, pets, and cross-stitching. I’m also a big fan of video games (though my time at the computer is limited now) and horror movies. I was studying math and physics until I got sick and had to stop school, but the interest and excitement is still very much there! I’m an avid coffee/tea drinker but can no longer tolerate alcohol or other activities. Iykyk. 

Hopefully that’s enough to spark a conversation. I look forward to hearing from you, whoever you may be :) ",13,1736043277.0,SaltLakeCity,38,0.76,False
1htv1dz,https://i.redd.it/xmzw6rzu33be1.jpeg,Week 1- Lemon Shortbread Cookies,These were fun! I agree with others who noted they needed more lemon. In the future I’d add much more zest and perhaps juice to the recipe. I tried both the thumbprint drop cookie method for the strawberry jam filled ones and the rolled out method with cookie cutter for the others. I topped some with a lemon glaze and the others have a sugar blend called “coffee cake sugar” atop them. Can’t pick a favorite. ,9,1736043241.0,BakingSchoolBakeAlong,2,1.0,False
