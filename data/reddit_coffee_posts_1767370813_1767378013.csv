1q263h1,https://www.reddit.com/r/kautious/comments/1q263h1/nyc_political_transition_inauguration_of_zohran/,NYC political transition / inauguration of Zohran Mamdani as mayor (multiple tweets describe swearing-in/inauguration and immediate actions): inauguration references and executive order activity.: Neutral Sentiment,"**TL;DR:** NYC’s political handoff to Mayor Zohran Mamdani is creating near-term headline risk, even if broader markets stay in consolidation. The big market angle isn’t ideology debates—it’s policy uncertainty and how quickly priorities shift (including revoking prior executive orders signed after **September 26, 2024**).

## Key Points
- **Policy/regulatory uncertainty:** An early move revokes executive orders from the prior administration after **2024-09-26**, which can reshuffle expectations for NYC-facing businesses.
- **Narrative volatility:** Media/optics controversy around the inauguration is fueling polarization—more noise, faster sentiment swings.
- **“Cost/elitism” framing:** Viral focus on consumer-price examples like **$9 coffee**, **$630 boots**, and a **$1,450 dress** shows how quickly economic messaging can become a tradeable narrative.
- **Market regime:** Overall backdrop reads like **consolidation**, but NYC-linked names can still see idiosyncratic moves.

## Analysis
This looks less like an immediate macro shock and more like a **local governance catalyst** with spillover via headlines. Rapid reversals of prior directives increase uncertainty around enforcement, permitting, public-private projects, and city-contract exposure—especially for firms whose revenues are meaningfully NYC-dependent.

The other thread is **information risk**: when inauguration optics dominate the discourse, markets can misprice the *probability* of policy outcomes (vs the policies themselves). That typically shows up as short-lived volatility and wider “wait and see” behavior rather than a clean trend—consistent with consolidation.

## What to Watch
- Follow-on clarifications after the **post-2024-09-26** executive order rollback (scope, exceptions, implementation timing)
- Any early signals on contracting, enforcement priorities, or business rules that affect NYC cash flows
- Whether narrative-driven “cost of living” stories (e.g., **$9 coffee**) translate into actual policy proposals

1q262op,https://www.reddit.com/r/reactivedogs/comments/1q262op/considering_dog_prozac/,Considering dog Prozac,"My fiance and I are at our wits end with his 4 yo male bluetick coonhound. We have been living together for a year and a half. Prior to moving in, I knew his dog was a bit on the ""crazy"" side. High energy, nonstop howling. I know it's the breed. However, over time, he began to show more concerning behaviors. Prior to me moving in, the dog showed severe resource guarding issues with humans and other dogs. He also would growl if you tried to move him in bed (he no longer sleeps in the bed). After I moved in, he started growling at me when I put him in the crate. Now, its at the point that I can't put him in the crate or take him out at all. He has never landed a bite on anyone. Another issue is that he gets grumpy at night and also growls if I tell him ""no."" He does the same to my fiance. At night, he will sometimes growl if I simply walk by him. It makes me afraid to be in the living room at night. The other day, I told him ""no"" because he was trying to get my drink on the coffee table. He growled and aggressively started coming towards me before my fiance intervened. This scenario has happened a few times and makes me afraid to stop him from unwanted behaviors (like tearing things up or getting into something he shouldn't). He sleeps in the crate at night and goes in the crate during the day when I work from home. He gets 1.5 hours of walks every day plus mental stimulation. We have spent thousands on training at this point. He knows all of his commands very well, he just seems to overreact to things that upset him. We manage it to the best of our ability but sometimes it can't be prevented. We don't know what to do next. We are considering Prozac for him. Our main concern is about having children. We plan on trying at the end of this year. I'm afraid this dog will be dangerous for a child or postpartum mom. Unfortunately, my fiance is VERY attached to this dog. Any advice would be great.

1q2625a,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1q2625a/update_5_days_postop_laparoscopic_cholecystectomy/,Update: 5 Days Post-Op Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy for Biliary Dyskinesia 22% EF,"Hey everyone :) First off, thank you for all the support on my original diagnosis story post (linked here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1pniust/biliary\_dyskinesia\_story\_22\_ejection\_fraction\_no/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1pniust/biliary_dyskinesia_story_22_ejection_fraction_no/) )  
  
After a long journey starting back in July 2025 and ending with a 22% HIDA scan ejection fraction result in October, normal ultrasound/labs, and chronic symptoms, I finally had my gallbladder removed via laparoscopic cholecystectomy this Monday, December 29th. 

TL;DR: Surgery went well, surgeon noted visual signs of mild chronic cholecystitis (pathology report still pending). I did end up with 6 incision sites. Recovery has been up and down, but overall manageable. Biggest issues were severe nausea on day 1 (likely anesthesia related) and pain/inflammation peaking on days 2-3. By day 5, I'm moving more, appetite is returning, and the RUQ is tender but quiet – no more spasms! Feeling hopeful for majority symptom resolution. Here's what I have experienced so far each day to hopefully help others on their biliary dyskinesia journey.   
  
Day 0 - Surgery Day!:

* Arrived super early (5:30 AM for 7:30 AM surgery). Procedure took \~30 minutes but ended up with 6 small incisions (usual is 4). Had an attempted intraoperative cholangiogram but surgeon couldn't fully image the common bile duct (apparently common, especially with narrower ducts).
* Hardest part: Severe pre-op nausea during the long wait to see my surgeon before surgery (lesson learned – next time, advocate harder for early anti-nausea meds!).
* Post-anesthesia nausea hit hard in PACU despite preventive meds, but improved with more Zofran/pain meds at home.
* ""Weird"" symptoms: Numb tip of tongue, hoarse voice (like Joan Rivers), and sore throat – all common from intubation/anesthesia, especially with my small jaw.
* Pain: Classic referred right shoulder blade gas pain (worst part), upper back discomfort, tender abdomen/RUQ, stiffness. Bending was tough. Maneuvering out of chairs/bed really hard.
* Eating: Stuck to light stuff (jello, dry toast, broth soup) and held it down.
* Activity: Short walks around the house every couple hours – got easier as the day went on.
* Discharged same day within an hour after my surgery. 

Day 1-2:

* Pain ramped up – more soreness, swelling, fatigue. Blurry vision on/off (another anesthesia side effect for some). The blurry vision freaked me out the most as I couldn't read my phone periodically. 
* Appetite started returning by day 2; still eating my pre-prepped chicken vegetable soup.

Day 3:

* Surgeon's op report confirmed mild chronic inflammation visually – validating it was time to remove! No more aggressive ""alien"" spasms in the RUQ.
* Still lots of pain/swelling, super tired, couldn't bend or lift much. Still up for 1-2 hours with walking then crashing for 1-2 hours of napping. 

Day 4:

* Soreness was better but fatigue was somehow worse in the afternoon. 
* Still eating soup but this time a hamburger vegetable soup to mix it up with dinner rolls and butter. This all went well! 

Day 5 (Today):

* Determined to increase activity: Short car ride out of the house, walked around a store for an hour.
* Tried a small iced coffee with oatmilk (surgeon encouraged experimenting with fats after a few days and I've been dying without coffee last few weeks).
* Result: Instant (soft/formed) BM and mild stomach discomfort. Some minor RUQ tenderness - not really the same pain as before. So far I've had zero explosive diarrhea, though. And no major pain. Tomorrow I plan on trying a Chic Fil A nugget lunch with fries as my second test (but no coffee tomorrow so as not to push my luck lol). 

Overall, day 1 was nausea-heavy, days 2-3 pain peaked (as warned), and now trending better with less stiffness and more energy. Still waiting on full pathology, but relieved it's out. I plan on logging my food experiences next 2-3 weeks and I'll update here in a month or two for the full picture of how this all went.   
  
If you're pre-op for biliary dyskinesia or similar – hang in there! Happy to answer questions. Here's to a healthier 2026 without gallbladder grief. ",1,1767377749.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

1q260pl,https://i.redd.it/r1ft6wx67zag1.png,"Launching Tymeslot: It's like cal.com, but beautiful and easy-to-use","**What it is**

I built a self-hosted scheduling platform called Tymeslot. It's focused on creating beautiful, easy-to-use booking pages that your clients actually enjoy using - while handling the backend stuff like calendar syncing across multiple providers and video conferencing integration.

**Why I built this**

I've been looking for a self-hosted scheduling tool for a while. [Cal.com](http://Cal.com) was way too complex for what I needed - overfeatured and a pain to self-host. EasyAppointments felt outdated and the workflow just didn't work for me.

After trying to make either one fit, I realized I'd spend less time just building my own. So I did.

**Self-hosting:**

You can deploy it with Docker (docker-compose file included). If you want to try it first, there's a live demo at [https://tymeslot.app](https://tymeslot.app) where you can also just use it in the cloud. Fair warning: if you're testing emails, check your spam folder - they sometimes end up there depending on your provider.

**Try it out:**

I've been using this daily for a few weeks now and it's been solid, but it's still in beta - so you might run into the occasional bug. If you do, let me know and I'll get it fixed quickly. I'd love to hear what works, what doesn't, and what features you'd actually want to see. Feedback and feature requests are more than welcome.

Jerry rents a motorcycle to impress a woman into bad boys & tries to avoid giving her a ride. He angers a Vespa gang  led by Bob & Cedric. Elaine dates a law professor. Kramer wears a toolbelt","Prompt continued:

Elaine dates a professor at Columbia Law. She can't win a single argument with him whenever they disagree on something as he references prior disagreements and uses them as ""precedent"". He asks her to back up her claims with physical proof.

She ends up finding out about his prior trials before he went to teaching and appeals to one of his old rivals to figure out how to beat him. 

__

Kramer helps the super out when he's replacing a light bulb and the ladder almost falls. He enlist Kramers help with some handyman projects around the building - changing light bulbs, fixing cabinets, etc. Kramer decides to help in exchange for the tool belt. Kramer says he liked the way it looks and he can carry more things with him. 

They finish projects with some Kramer mishaps 

Then he starts walking around with the belt and then wearing flannels and jeans. 

People ask him for help with random projects and he ""helps"" in spite of his belt being full of random things
__

George has a client with a secretary and a receptionist; he's never sure who is who when communicating about the clients schedule and setting up meetings. He only went to the business in person once where he flirted with the female front desk receptionist and then made small talk with the secretary as they escorted him to the clients office.

The next day at the tail end of an email he gets a comment from one of them mentioning how lovely it was to meet him and how rare it is to have a funny handsome guy also so successful at business.

He flirts back and they set a day and time to meet with him assuming it's the receptionist when its really the secretary 

__

Jerry meets a woman at the coffee shop, she sees him on the pay phone where a conversation with George (asking Jerry to spot him some cash so he can take this receptionist to a nice place) has Jerry sound vaguely like a bookie.  He thinks the woman is joking when she approaches him and comments how tough he seems and talks about his leather jacket and motorcycle.  He then realizes she's serious and actually thinks he's a bad boy. She asks him out and wants a ride on his motorcycle ""among other things"".

He rents a motorcycle and has the motorcycle towed to his apartment because he is scared to ride it and has no license.

He has it rented for 2 weeks (the minimum) and just leaves it in a motorcycle spot on the street. That spot is typically claimed by Bob & Cedric and their entire Vespa gang.  They're upset at this outsider taking their spot.

Espresso is unlikely to be my daily driver (very time poor) and more a relaxing routine for when I can spare the time for it.

I mainly use Facebook for looking for local events and news in my area, and watching videos, mainly recipes, dancing, fitness, standup comedy, and of course, cat videos. I don't watch political content, religious content, makeup or clothing videos, or much else besides what I listed here.

I was laying in bed scrolling (bad habit, I know) around 10:30pm last Sunday Dec 21. Suddenly my feed became inundated with:

* extreme political content
* sexual content
* AI slop, heavily featuring ragebait like ""obese Karens behaving badly and yelling about food stamps""
* pro-church vids
* anti-church vids
* anti-vax ""influencers""
* trad-wife and red-pill content
* pimple popping (why are the vids displayed inside a coffee cup???)
* cheaters (“I printed out his Tinder profile lol”)
* pages that read out AITA posts
* brain rot of all sorts

  
There was a *distinct* difference in my feed directly after 10:30pm on that day.

I started blocking the pages and marking the vids as Not Interested, but I'm still seeing the same type of content. My settings and ad preferences are locked down, and I don't have personal details about myself in my About section. I don't even use my full name or post photos of myself.

What's funny is that it's never the first few videos in the list, so this feels intentional. My reels thumbnails are dancing and fitness related, but if I click one and then scroll a few minutes, boom, here comes the unwanted stuff.

What's *really* weird is that many of the pages I'm blocking are new pages created in the last few weeks, and many only have 20-100 likes. There's NO way this stuff should be making it into my feed. I’m also getting vids in languages I do not speak.

Most of the pages I follow don't even show up anymore. The videos I *do* want to see are usually shorter, only a few seconds instead of longer videos. I used to watch 20-30 minute comedy specials on FB, and now it's primarily videos that are less than a minute.

I plan to uninstall FB for a while to see if it resets itself, but is anyone else seeing this stuff?",3,1767376890.0,facebook,2,1.0,False

1q25nh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q25nh0/aitah_for_blocking_my_ex_after_months_of/,"AITAH for blocking my ex after months of instability, repeated breakups, and continued involvement?","This is long, but shortening it changes context.

I (F) have known B since 2016. We stayed loosely in touch through Snapchat over the years and were always platonic. He is my best friend’s first cousin.

In early 2025, we met for coffee while in the same place. That same day he asked me out. On our first date, he said he wanted to marry me. Before the second date, he said he loved me. I told him this felt very fast and that I was reserved since we hadn’t discussed exclusivity. On Valentine’s Day, he asked me to be his girlfriend and I said yes.

He frequently pushed me to drive long distances to see him. While doing so, I had two driving incidents: a near-miss and a serious crash. Both happened while driving to see him after he insisted I make the trip. After the near miss, he said, “What can I do about it?” After the crash, he said, “Let me know if I can help,” but was emotionally unavailable. Because of the crash, I had to extend my travel tickets. Two days later, he left for New Zealand, and communication before he left was minimal.

When I returned to the US in April, I was struggling emotionally. Within two days, he told me he was upset by how sad I was and how much I complained. At the same time, he would vent to me for hours. To make long distance work, I gave up my gym, classes, cooking, and most personal time. We talked 5–6 hours daily, mostly him talking.

He began making what he called “objective” comments about my upbringing, my family, how I dressed at the gym, and what I posted online. When I raised concerns about his behavior, he said he cannot take criticism and that he would “break anyone” just with his words.

He pushed for marriage and asked me to move to New Zealand for two months to see how we got along and then marry in December. I visited him for 10 days. I paid for flights, Airbnb, groceries, and expenses. He did not plan activities and we mostly stayed home watching TV. When I left, he dropped me at the airport but didn’t come inside.

I was also in the middle of a major interstate move in the US. Since I wouldn’t move internationally right away, he decided to come to the US for two months. I told him it would be hard since I didn’t know the area, didn’t have a car yet, and planned to stay with family. He reassured me repeatedly.

I arranged the Airbnb and logistics. A friend took a day off to help pick him up. I cooked for him, planned outings, and worked full-time. He didn’t cook and spent most of the day on his phone. We argued about him not liking my friends and about me not appreciating him doing the dishes once. He also took late-night calls with the door open, disrupting my sleep.

One Friday night, I said I felt overwhelmed and didn’t know how we’d manage. He reassured me. The next morning, I woke up and he was gone. He didn’t tell me. He texted my friend saying he was breaking up with me. I tried calling him repeatedly with no response.

His sister later told me to go to the Airbnb because no one could reach him. While I was on my way, his mother called, accused me of several things, and told me not to go, saying he wanted nothing to do with me. I had paid for the Airbnb and groceries and went anyway. He stayed on his phone while I cried and then left again.

After this, he told others he needed space and that I couldn’t accept it. A few days later, he contacted me saying he wanted space but didn’t want to give closure because he still wanted me. He asked for another chance. I didn’t move back in, but we continued seeing each other.

During this time, we took a previously planned trip to LA. The trip involved frequent arguments. After returning, I stayed with friends.

He extended his US stay and booked a new Airbnb in an unsafe area. He had no way to move, so I helped him. We attended a dance festival together. Afterward, I asked him to stay at my friend’s place since I was picking up my new car. He refused and left abruptly, citing ankle pain.

Shortly after I moved into my new place, we went to badminton and afterward he suddenly said we should go our separate ways. I blocked him temporarily. About a week later, I reached out and said I accepted the breakup but would help him with remaining logistics.

Over the next days, I drove over an hour each way to help with groceries, laundry, errands, and transport. He wanted to go to NYC, so I planned the trip within two days, paid for everything, took time off work, drove him there, and later drove him back. While driving him to the airport, he said he realized he owed his ex an apology and that I never held space for him, despite talking about commitment the day before.

At the airport, after checking his bags, he asked me to drive him to buy cigarettes and I paid. I also gave him cash for food. His parting words were that I hadn’t lost him yet and that he secretly wished I would wait.

From October onward, he checked in occasionally. On New Year’s, I called him drunk, asked if his promises were real, and why he treated me this way. He told me to stop focusing on his actions, focus on his intentions, and look inward instead. I cursed at him and blocked him everywhere.

My ex (23m) and I (27f) broke up in September and have been trying to cordially live together until he can figure out where to go. At first, I was open to being patient as long as he payed his part of the bills and helped around the house. 

Shocker except to no one at all, we’re going into January and he consistently pays for the internet bill but never gives me extra money for utilities and mortgage. He’s terrible at managing money so I should have guessed this wouldn’t work out in my favor. 

We still argue every single day, despite being broken up, and it stems from him just being horrible to live with. He doesn’t help with bills, doesn’t take care of the cats, he eats my food that I specifically tell him not to eat, comes in my room and wakes me up on my days off to BUY HIM COFFEE. He calls me multiple times while I’m working to ask what he should eat for dinner. He even scratched the side of car with the snowblower and when I asked him about it I didn’t even get a sorry? Just more manipulative wah me bullshit. 

I was trying to be civil with him even after he broke up with me but it seems like he still expects me to cater to him. And I tell him all the time I’m done mothering him, he’s not a child and we’re not together anymore. 

I know he talks to other girls at this point, which I don’t really care anymore but it just pisses me off that he can live rent free in his ex’s house and no girl he talks to is going to find it weird? I’m not even going to try and see anyone until he’s out of my house, it just seems like a messy situation that I wouldn’t want anyone else involved in.

We broke up but it feels like I’m still stuck in this toxic cycle where he tests and pushes my boundaries every day, but I still feel like I’ll miss him when he’s gone. I shouldn’t still be shedding tears over this guy three and half months out of this shit ass relationship, he didn’t do anything but make me question my worth, question his love, and ruin my finances.

Advice for talking to him about it?,"Basically the title! The family member in question is my mom’s long term boyfriend, with whom my son used to be verrry close, like he was always his preference when it came to carrying him or holding hands. Always excited to see him, loved to play with him, they were best buddies. 

Now they are not, it’s like a switch flipped and my son either doesn’t care at all to see him at all or will ask him to leave. For example he asked if my mom could come over today, and specifically said “Just her. Not (boyfriend).”.

My son went to my mom’s semi-frequently (maybe once every other week) and we saw the two of them at least once a week for coffee or meals, so it’s not as if we suddenly stopped seeing this family member. 

Recently my son was at my mom’s house, and when her boyfriend came in the room, my son apparently told him to “Get out of my face” and told him to leave the house (he doesn’t live there). 

The only thing I can think is that, every time my son goes to my mom’s house, she’s usually busy with other things and her boyfriend ends up hanging out and playing with my son the whole time. So maybe he’s trying to express that he wants my mom’s attention too and thinks her boyfriend is a barrier to it?

You can never trust anybody 100% so of course I can’t say “I know nothing happened”, because that’s just not possible to know when there’s been plenty of moments I haven’t been there for. There haven’t been any major glaring red flags behaviorally other than getting a little mean and having a VERY short temper out of nowhere, and acting very defeated when things go wrong (“The whole day is ruined now” etc). He hasn’t said anything that’s concerned me.

1q25jbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/heatedrivalry/comments/1q25jbc/if_heated_rivalry_left_you_feeling_weirdly/,"If Heated Rivalry Left You Feeling Weirdly Devastated, There’s a Reason","Like many of you, HR has occupied most of my waking thoughts over the past few weeks. Since watching episode 5, I’ve browsed this subreddit daily and been excited to see new takes and interpretations for the relationship progression, theories about who fell first and when, and all the appreciation posts for the eye candy. After watching episode 6, my enthusiasm went into overdrive. I’ve sought out endless reaction videos and watch streams to vicariously experience the show through someone else’s eyes. I read HR for the first time (but I’m holding off on TLG until after I watch season 2 of the show; fingers crossed I don’t die between now and then). I wake up before my alarm and immediately start thinking about *this* scene, *that* dialogue, etc., and I find myself incapable of getting back to sleep even though I’ve gotten way less shut-eye than I usually do. Nothing else in my life feels as interesting or engaging as this fucking show.

A few days ago, I was at the doctor’s office for a check-up. As I waited for the doctor to enter the exam room, I suddenly felt this wave of panic. This was a rare moment in which I was not actively engaging with any HR-related. My phone was in my bag, and I was sitting in my own thoughts, which had somehow managed to veer into non-HR territory. And those thoughts and circumstances felt grey and flat. Uninteresting. Depressing. Devastating, even.

Then, /u/IlyenatheMilkSop posted [this thread about struggling with infatuation with this show rather than enjoying it](https://old.reddit.com/r/heatedrivalry/comments/1q0gf16/i_feel_like_im_actually_struggling_with_the/). Going through the comments in that thread showed me I was far from alone in my current melancholy, and made me think there has to be a scientific explanation for what many of us are going through right now. 

I was pleased to find there is research on this, and none too soon. [A November 2025 study published in Acta Psychologica (Vol. 247)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691825011114) examined what the authors call “parasocial grief:” the sadness and dysregulation people experience when a deeply engaging fictional relationship or narrative ends (e.g. finishing a book, show, or game). The authors found that strong narrative immersion and emotional attachment can produce something very similar to grief, including intrusive thoughts, low mood, sleep disruption, and a kind of real-life flattening afterward. The emotional systems involved don’t sharply distinguish between real and fictional attachment when engagement is high, so when the story ends, the nervous system experiences a genuine loss. People who are highly empathetic, imaginative, or prone to deep focus are more likely to report stronger effects.

Importantly, the distress isn’t about wanting the characters for ourselves. It’s about losing access to the relationship, emotional intensity, and meaning the story provided. The crash afterward reflects the nervous system recalibrating after a prolonged period of heightened emotional engagement, meaning-making, and attentional focus, not a sign that something is wrong with us. What a lot of us are feeling isn’t a personal failing or “being too online;” it’s a sort of grief that follows powerful storytelling.

Once I felt comfortable with the idea that this was grief, I thought about just disengaging with the fandom and moving on with my life. However, I’m opting for sharing what I have learned and am going to try in case it helps at least one of the rest of my beloved feral folks move through these feelings more smoothly than they otherwise might (I won’t lie, I used ChatGPT to help pull this list of strategies together from research because it’s my day off and I didn’t feel like researching everything on my own, but they have so far been helpful to me in moving through this; I can cite studies for these suggestions if you request it):

1. Normalize and name the experience  
Research on parasocial grief shows that labeling the reaction as grief rather than “being ridiculous” reduces distress and rumination. This draws from grief models showing that validation reduces secondary suffering (the shame about the feeling), which otherwise prolongs it.

2. Avoid abrupt “cold turkey” disengagement  
There is good evidence from attachment research and emotion science that abruptly losing access to a highly engaging emotional stimulus can intensify distress, including low mood, intrusive thoughts, and a sense of emotional flatness.
What helps more than avoidance is tapering the exposure (e.g. allow yourself to engage with the media for a predefined amount of time, and then go do something different).

3. Externalize the bond rather than suppress it  
Grief research suggests that “continuing bonds” are often healthier than forced detachment, even for symbolic or non-reciprocal attachments. The goal isn’t to pretend the attachment never existed, but to change how it lives in your mind.
For example: you might write down what the relationship represented to you (feeling wanted, feeling safe being intense, watching two people choose each other fully, seeing desire treated as something good instead of embarrassing, softness alongside obsession), then deliberately stop seeking new content that reactivates the same emotional loop. The bond is acknowledged and contained, rather than constantly re-stimulated. Studies show that meaning-making, not erasure, predicts faster emotional stabilization.

4. Restore reward and novelty in small, real-world ways  
One reason post-narrative grief feels so flat is reward contrast. Our brains adapted to an unusually high level of emotional engagement and narrative meaning, and everyday life temporarily feels underpowered by comparison. Fortunately, research suggests we don’t need equivalent intensity to recover. Low-level rewards spread across multiple avenues can help.  
If you’re like me, you may not be motivated to do any of these things, but doing them regardless can help restore balance. Consider engaging with new (but low-stakes) activities (e.g. try a new hobby or start a new book or tv show). Do something physical (e.g. go for a walk). Make social connections that are not emotionally demanding (e.g. go out for coffee with a friend).

5. Do not use “getting over it” as the goal  
Grief studies consistently show that pressure to resolve grief quickly prolongs distress. The goal should be integration rather than disappearance. Trying to “fix” the feelings tends to keep them active longer. This lines up with the Dual Process model for grief.

6. Limit algorithmic reinforcement (this one is the kicker, as I am sure you all agree)  
This is one of the most practical, evidence-supported steps. Reduce algorithm-driven feeds with infinite scrolling and attention hijacking. Instead, engage with finite, intentional content (some of this piggy-backs on strategy 2 above regarding tapering the exposure). Algorithms repeatedly reactivate the same emotional circuitry. This is consistent with research on rumination, reward loops, and media exposure.",3,1767376633.0,heatedrivalry,1,1.0,False
1q25iy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1q25iy0/elision_85/,Elision 8.5,"I had the sense of time running at different speeds. For a while it ran slowly, life seemed in stasis, I ran down the clock of my memories until I approached what I perceived as a turning point: I had been dumped back three years and I needed to do something with the exams that were approaching. I had done alright originally,  but not as well as I needed to, or should have, so I figured  my movement and change,  my demonstration to the entity that would be my part in the battle, would be that.

My destiny - no, my anti-destiny, my seizing the chance to change my future, to move in time with the benefit of hindsight - would be to do the exams everyone wanted me to do anyway.

I could not see how this put me into battle, or how it allowed me to grow as a person, or how it showed I could take control of time and somehow engage this entity with material reality.

It was just the same obligations as ever. I grew depressed and weary. I wrote terrible poetry, with a vague memory that I had done this before, but when I searched for the diary in which I knew I had written it, I couldn't find it.

I lived as this shade, occupying my body, second guessing my reactions, watching younger family I knew as much older and maybe even late people. When I looked at my dad I had a vision of a crowd and people dabbing their eyes, but no memory of whatever that was.

Jenna had disappeared. I must have gone three months leading up to the exams with no contact from her at all.

To all intents and purposes,  my mission seemed over,  and I was beginning to wonder if the future three years had been a dream and this was all there ever had been.

Then it was the last day before study leave. The whole of Year 11 left school for the last time, to return only to sit the exams themselves. I trudged from my English classroom towards my bus, same as ever, rucksack on one shoulder (never, ever over both), my friends running and jumping on each other in that testosterone filled way we all did, the way we showed affection. 

Then it stopped. There was a group ahead of me. They looked like a sculpture of teenage boys. A hand touched my shoulder and I knew who it was immediately,  remembered for the first time who it was, turned around and she gave me a piece of paper and smiled.

This time it was different. This time, I didn't take it. I looked at her and shook my head sadly. She opened her mouth to speak.

'There's no point,' I muttered. 'She's leaving, I'll never see her again anyway. It's better if we don't do this. She should meet someone she's got a chance of building something real with.'

Though I had always known she was the one for me, but she had never spoken to me, only ever sometimes glanced at me in what I had thought were looks of pity but now I recalled what they were,  and what they were again.

I felt myself branch, and my other self walked happily to catch his friends up, who unfreeze, while I stayed where I was, without a note in my hand that I would carry in my wallet for thirty years or more, alone and utterly miserable.

'That can't have been it,' I said to myself. 'I can't have been required to deprive myself of my first ever relationship and the absolute love of my life.'

Jenna appeared, putting what looked like a thick blue lighter in her mouth and exhaling steam afterwards. She nodded.

'It was. But you know why?'

I shook my head.

'Didn't you hear yourself? You did it for her. You gave her a chance to start afresh when she changes school.'

'Great. Well done me.'

'Listen. In your timeline the stress of your rapid relationship and bitter break up (yes, you are the love of her life too) contributes to a serious mental health condition she will develop. She will try to -'

'Is that why -'

'Yes, why you never hear anything about her after you finish school. But now she is free. And so are you.'

'But we don't get the love of our lives.'

'You haven't heard of social media, have you? No, of course you haven't.  Well you'll be able to reconnect in a few years. Maybe something will still be there between you when you meet for coffee...'

She smiled.

'And how does this defeat the entity?'

'It doesn't. It proves to it that we occupy utterly different realms. That it can't prosper here, in a realm where time moves inexorably and decisions carve out completely new timelines. It's not its home.'

'Will it realise that?'

'Eventually. Come on, you've missed the bus. I've just had the XR3i upgraded to a Sierra XR4. You'll love it.'

She patted me kindly and in a vaguely embarrassed way on the shoulder,  as only an English sort of a ghost could, and we left school.",1,1767376610.0,story,0,1.0,False
1q25ime,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenWithDiscipline/comments/1q25ime/how_to_lose_weight_and_keep_it_off_sciencebacked/,How to Lose Weight and KEEP It Off: Science-Backed Tactics That Actually Work,"Let me hit you with something real. Most people who lose weight gain it all back within a year. Not because they're weak or lazy but because almost everything we've been told about weight loss is either incomplete or straight up wrong. I went deep into the research, podcasts with actual experts like Dr. Michael Greger, nutrition science and clinical studies to figure out what really works for sustained weight loss. Not the BS you see on Instagram. The real deal.

Here's what I found: Your body is literally fighting against you when you try to lose weight. Your metabolism slows down, hunger hormones spike, and your brain goes into survival mode. But there are proven tactics to work with your biology instead of against it. Let's break it down.

 Step 1: Stop Counting Calories Like It's 1995

Calories matter, sure. But obsessing over them is missing the bigger picture. Not all calories are created equal. 100 calories from almonds affects your body completely differently than 100 calories from soda. One keeps you full and stabilises blood sugar. The other spikes insulin and leaves you hungrier an hour later.
Dr. Michael Greger's research in ""How Not to Diet"" destroys the calorie myth. He reviews thousands of studies and shows that what you eat matters way more than how much you eat. People who focus on whole plant based foods naturally consume fewer calories without even trying because these foods are less calorie dense and way more filling.

The book is packed with actionable science, not diet industry BS. Greger breaks down how specific foods meal timing and eating habits affect weight loss at a cellular level. This is the best nutrition book I've read, period. It made me question everything I thought I knew about dieting.
The tactic: Prioritise nutrient dense, low calorie dense foods. Think vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains. These fill you up without packing in crazy calories. You can eat MORE food and still lose weight.

 Step 2: Master Your Hunger Hormones

Your body has two main hunger hormones: ghrelin (makes you hungry) and leptin (tells you you're full). When you lose weight, ghrelin goes up and leptin goes down. Your body literally cranks up hunger signals to get you to regain the weight. This is biology not willpower failure.

But here's the hack: Protein and fiber are your weapons. Both suppress ghrelin and help you feel full longer. Studies show people who eat high protein breakfasts consume fewer calories throughout the day without even thinking about it.

The tactic: Get 25 to 30 grams of protein at breakfast. Eggs, Greek yogurt, protein smoothies, whatever works. Then load up on fiber throughout the day. Aim for 30 to 40 grams. Beans, lentils, oats, vegetables. Fiber slows digestion and keeps you satisfied.

Also check out the app Ash. It's like having a nutrition coach in your pocket. It helps you track not just calories but also protein and fiber intake which are way more important for sustained weight loss.

 Step 3: Timing Matters More Than You Think

Intermittent fasting isn't just a trendy buzzword. There's legit science behind it. When you give your body a break from constant eating, insulin levels drop, and your body switches to burning fat for fuel instead of glucose.

Dr. Greger talks about this in his Rich Roll podcast episode. He explains how meal timing affects fat oxidation and metabolic health. You don't have to do extreme fasting. Even a 12 to 14 hour overnight fast (like finishing dinner at 7pm and not eating until 9am) can make a difference.

The tactic: Stop eating 3 hours before bed. Your body burns fewer calories at night so late night eating is more likely to be stored as fat. Then aim for that 12 to 14 hour overnight fast. It's not about starving yourself. It's about strategic timing.

 Step 4: Ditch Liquid Calories Completely

Soda, juice, fancy coffee drinks, alcohol. These are silent killers for weight loss. Your brain doesn't register liquid calories the same way it does solid food. You can drink 400 calories and still feel hungry 30 minutes later.Studies show people who cut out sugary drinks lose weight without making any other changes. It's that powerful.
The tactic: Drink water, black coffee or unsweetened tea. If plain water is boring add lemon, cucumber or mint. Save calories for actual food that will fill you up.

 Step 5: Sleep Like Your Weight Depends On It (Because It Does)

Here's something most people ignore: Poor sleep wrecks your weight loss efforts. When you don't sleep enough your body produces more ghrelin and less leptin. You're hungrier and less satisfied after eating. Plus lack of sleep tanks your willpower and decision making.

Research shows people who sleep less than 6 hours a night are way more likely to be overweight. Sleep deprivation also increases cortisol, which promotes fat storage especially around your belly.
The tactic: Prioritize 7 to 9 hours of quality sleep. Set a consistent bedtime. Make your room dark and cool. Avoid screens an hour before bed. 

If you struggle with sleep try Insight Timer. It's a free meditation app with tons of sleep meditations and bedtime stories that actually help you wind down. Another solid option is BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app built by experts from Columbia and Google. It pulls from research papers expert talks and books to create personalized audio content on topics like sleep science,stress management, and building sustainable habits. You can set the depth from a quick 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples and strategies. It also builds you an adaptive learning plan based on your goals. The voice options are surprisingly addictive there's even a calm soothing narrator that's perfect for winding down before bed. It's been helpful for understanding the science behind why sleep matters so much for weight loss.

 Step 6: Move More, But Not How You Think

Exercise is important but not because it burns a ton of calories. Most people overestimate how many calories they burn working out. A 30 minute run might burn 300 calories, which you can easily eat back in 5 minutes.

The real benefit of exercise for weight loss is that it preserves muscle mass while you're losing fat. Muscle is metabolically active, meaning it burns calories even at rest. Losing muscle slows your metabolism, making it easier to regain weight.
The tactic: Do resistance training at least 3 times a week. Lift weights, do bodyweight exercises whatever. Build and maintain muscle. Then add in daily movement. Walk more take the stairs, stand instead of sit. These small changes add up way more than you think.

 Step 7: Eat Real Food, Not Food Products

This is the simplest yet most powerful rule. If it comes in a package with a long ingredient list it's probably not helping you lose weight. Ultra processed foods are engineered to be hyper palatable. They hijack your brain's reward system and make you want to eat more.

Whole foods, on the other hand, are self limiting. It's pretty hard to overeat steamed broccoli or baked chicken. But you can crush an entire bag of chips without thinking about it.
The tactic: Shop the perimeter of the grocery store. That's where the real food lives. Vegetables, fruits, lean proteins whole grains. Avoid the middle aisles filled with processed crap. If you can't pronounce an ingredient, maybe don't eat it.

 Step 8: Track Progress Beyond The Scale

The scale is a lying asshole. It doesn't tell the full story. You can lose fat and gain muscle and see no change in weight. Or you can have a high sodium meal and ""gain"" 3 pounds of water weight overnight.
The tactic: Take progress photos every 2 weeks. Measure your waist, hips, and thighs. Notice how your clothes fit. Track your energy levels and how you feel. These are better indicators of real progress than the number on the scale.

 Step 9: Build An Environment That Supports You

Willpower is overrated. You can't rely on it long term. Instead, set up your environment so the healthy choice is the easy choice
The tactic: Don't keep junk food in your house. If it's not there, you can't eat it. Prep healthy meals and snacks in advance so you're not making decisions when you're tired and hungry. Surround yourself with people who support your goals not people who pressure you to eat shit you don't want.

Try the Finch app for building healthy habits. It gamifies habit tracking and makes the process actually fun. You take care of a little bird as you take care of yourself. Sounds dumb, but it works.

 Step 10: Accept That This Is Forever

Here's the hard truth: There's no finish line. Weight loss isn't a temporary project. It's a lifestyle change. The tactics that help you lose weight are the same ones that will help you keep it off.
The good news? Once these habits become automatic, they stop feeling like work. You're not on a diet. You're just living differently. And that's how sustained weight loss actually happens.
Most people fail because they think of weight loss as a sprint. It's a marathon. Be patient with yourself. Focus on progress, not perfection.",1,1767376590.0,MenWithDiscipline,0,1.0,False
1q25iim,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q25iim,Stop going to the crowded islands. Here is the ultimate 4-Day Sailing Route for San Blas (Guna Yala) that most tourists miss. 🏝️🗺️,"Hey r/SanBlasIslands,

I see a lot of people asking if San Blas is ""worth it"" or if they should just stay in a stationary cabin on one island.

As someone who organizes charters here, I have to be honest: The magic of San Blas is in the movement. If you stay in a cabin near the port, you are seeing the ""busy"" side of the archipelago. To see the National Geographic style paradise, you need to sail further out.

Here is the itinerary I recommend to my clients to ensure they get the best charter experience in Panama away from the crowds.

**Day 1: Leaving Civilization Behind (Chichime or Dog Island)**

Most charters start around 10:00 AM.

• **The Vibe**: We leave the port and sail about 1-2 hours.

• **The Spot:** We usually aim for Isla Chichime or Nuinudup. These are beautiful, but still relatively close to the mainland. It’s the perfect place to get your ""sea legs,"" have your first swim, and meet the Guna families.

• **Food**: This is usually when we buy fresh catch from the local Guna fishermen who pull up alongside the sailboat in their wooden dugouts (Ulu).

**Day 2: The ""Swimming Pool"" (Cayos Holandeses)**

This is the secret weapon of a private charter.

• You cannot easily reach Cayos Holandeses on a day tour. It requires a sailboat or catamaran.

• **The Experience:** This is the furthest group of islands. The water here is a different color—electric blue. It’s protected by a massive reef, making it calm and perfect for snorkeling.

• **Activity**: We drop anchor in the ""Swimming Pool"" (a shallow sandbar area) and get the paddleboards out. You are miles away from the noise.

**Day 3: The Most Beautiful Anchorage (Coco Bandero)**

• If you look up ""San Blas Islands"" on Google Images, you are probably looking at Coco Bandero.

• It is a cluster of tiny islands with palm trees, protected by coral reefs.

• **Pro Tip:** This is the best spot for a beach BBQ. A good charter crew will set up a fire on a deserted beach, grill fresh lobster and plantains, and let you enjoy the stars with zero light pollution.

**Day 4: Culture and Coffee (El Porvenir)**

• On the way back, we stop at El Porvenir or Wichubwala.

• This is a chance to buy molas (traditional Guna textiles) directly from the artisans before heading back to the 4x4 transport.

💡 **Why this matters for your booking**

When you are looking for a San Blas boat rental, ask the captain or agency: ""Do you go to Cayos Holandeses?""

• If they say ""No, it's too far/too much fuel,"" it’s probably a budget operator.

• If they say ""Absolutely, that’s our favorite spot,"" you know you found a quality charter.

📝 **Summary**

San Blas is not just one island; it's 365. Don't limit yourself to the first one you see. Get on a boat that is willing to raise the sails and take you to the outer cays.

I’ve been tracking whale movements for years. What’s happening right now is not normal market activity.

We’re now three days into what looks like one of the most coordinated institutional repositioning events in recent memory. And it’s accelerating.

Let me show you what just happened in the last 24 hours, then connect it to the bigger pattern.

-----

## The 280M USDC Anomaly

This is where things get interesting.

**The exact same amount of USDC, 280,518,707 tokens, just moved four times in rapid succession between unknown wallets:**

- Transfer 1: 280.5M USDC
- Transfer 2: 280.5M USDC
- Transfer 3: 280.5M USDC
- Transfer 4: 280.5M USDC

Same amount. Different wallets. Sequential transactions.

This isn’t someone buying coffee. This is either:

**Hot potato custody routing** where an asset moves through multiple security layers before final destination

**Multi-sig settlement** requiring multiple wallet hops for compliance or authorization

**Payment chain execution** for a large structured deal

When you see the exact same dollar amount ping through multiple wallets like a digital relay race, you’re watching institutional plumbing at work. This is how big trades settle when they’re too large for a single wallet or exchange to handle cleanly.

Add the earlier 272M USDC transfer, and that’s over **half a billion dollars in USDC** being actively routed today alone.

-----

## USDC: The Burn and Mint Dance

Now here’s where the stablecoin picture gets complicated:

**Burned:**

- 100M USDC
- 100M USDC
- 100M USDC
- 50.5M USDC
- 50M USDC

**Total burned: 400.5M USDC**

**Minted:**

- 50.5M USDC
- 100M USDC moved from Treasury to unknown wallet on Solana

**Net result: ~250M USDC removed from circulation**

But notice the pattern. They’re burning in round $100M and $50M blocks while minting smaller specific amounts. This suggests:

Large redemptions (institutions cashing out to fiat or rotating to other instruments)

Selective minting for specific deployment needs

Net supply contraction but with targeted liquidity injection

Over three days, we’ve now seen **over $650M in USDC burns**. That’s not normal volatility. That’s systematic capital rotation.

-----

## Bitcoin: The Coinbase Institutional Conveyor Belt Continues

**Into Coinbase Institutional:**

- 1,123 BTC ($99M)
- 754 BTC ($67M)
- 664 BTC ($60M) into regular Coinbase

**Out of Coinbase Institutional:**

- 586 BTC ($51M)
- 583 BTC ($52M)
- 582 BTC ($51M)

Three nearly identical withdrawals. Same size. Same destination type (unknown wallets). Same pattern we’ve seen for three days straight.

At this point, the signal is unmistakable. This is programmatic distribution from a central custody hub to multiple cold storage endpoints or client wallets.

When you see the same ~585 BTC amount leave repeatedly, that’s not market selling. That’s fulfilling withdrawal requests or moving to institutional custody solutions in standardized blocks.

**Running total over 72 hours: 35,000+ BTC repositioned**

The direction remains consistent. More flowing into custody and off-exchange than onto trading platforms.

-----

## Solana: The Gate Deposit

- **407,001 SOL ($53M) moved to Gate.io**

This is the first major SOL movement we’ve seen in this three-day sequence.

SOL moving to an exchange, especially in size, typically means one of three things:

**Liquidity provision** (market maker depositing inventory)

**Collateral for derivatives trading**

**Preparation for spot selling**

Given the broader pattern of assets moving away from exchanges, this stands out as potentially bearish for SOL specifically, or it could be a market maker rebalancing liquidity across venues.

Context matters. If we see follow-up withdrawals in coming days, it’s just liquidity management. If it stays and more follows, that’s distribution setup.

-----

## USDT: The Bitfinex-Treasury Cycle

- $130M USDT: Tether Treasury → Bitfinex
- $140M USDT: Bitfinex → Tether Treasury

This circular flow between Tether’s treasury and Bitfinex is standard operational activity. Bitfinex and Tether have close operational ties, and these movements usually reflect:

Settlement reconciliation between the two entities

Liquidity management for exchange operations

Treasury rebalancing after minting or redemption cycles

Not a major directional signal on its own, but it shows the active state of USDT circulation infrastructure.

-----

## The 72-Hour Mega Pattern

Let me connect the dots across three days of data:

**Bitcoin:**

- 35,000+ BTC moved in coordinated custody patterns
- Consistent flow: into institutional custody, out to unknown wallets
- Very little moving onto public exchanges for selling
- **Signal: Accumulation and supply removal**

**Ethereum:**

- $450M+ staked in 24 hours (from Day 2 data)
- Moderate continued movements between wallets
- **Signal: Long-term lockup, supply removal**

**Stablecoins:**

- $650M+ USDC burned (supply contraction)
- $800M USDT deployed into Aave (active leverage)
- $500M+ USDC in institutional routing (large settlement activity)
- **Signal: Capital rotation from passive to active instruments**

**XRP:**

- $1.8B unlocked from escrow (scheduled, but timing notable)
- **Signal: Liquidity event coinciding with broader institutional activity**

**Solana:**

- $53M moved to exchange
- **Signal: Potential distribution or liquidity provision**

-----

## What We’re Actually Watching

This isn’t a random collection of whale alerts. This is a synchronized institutional operation across multiple assets over 72+ hours.

When billions move in coordinated patterns like this, here’s what it typically precedes:

**Major liquidity events** (new product launches, derivatives settlements, rebalancing deadlines)

**Directional positioning ahead of known catalysts** (macro data, regulatory decisions, protocol upgrades)

**Post-holiday institutional re-entry** (we’re in early January, fiscal year begins, new capital allocations)

The pattern is too clean to be random. The amounts are too large to be retail. The consistency is too high to be coincidental.

-----

## What Confirms the Next Move

Here’s what I’m watching over the next 48-72 hours:

**Bullish confirmation:**

- BTC continues flowing off exchanges
- ETH staking maintains or increases
- USDT deployment continues into DeFi or margin
- SOL movement reverses (withdrawals back to wallets)

**Bearish/distribution signals:**

- BTC starts flowing back to exchanges in size
- ETH unstaking or large exchange deposits
- USDT sitting idle instead of being borrowed
- More large-cap alts following SOL to exchanges

**Neutral/rebalancing:**

- Flows stabilize
- Stablecoin burns slow down
- BTC movements decrease in frequency

-----

## The Real Question

When over $5 billion in assets move in structured patterns over 72 hours, and the same amounts keep appearing in transaction sequences, you’re not watching the market react to news.

You’re watching institutional preparation before the news.

The question isn’t whether something is coming. The question is whether you’re positioned for it when price finally catches up to what flow data is already showing.

Most people will see the price move first and scramble to react. By then, institutions have already been positioning for days.

**So what’s your read? Are we setting up for a Q1 leg up, or is this just post-holiday rebalancing? What are you watching?**

The data doesn’t lie. The blockchain records everything. You just have to know where to look.

1q259sh,https://i.redd.it/k2csno5f4zag1.png,Reviewing some of the middle eastern decants i purchased last week,"New to this hobby. Tried middle eastern fragrances for the first time. I used cheapies like Bellavita, wild stone, Park Avenue, Denver, villain perfumes etc. before which were good but weren't long lasting. Hence I was introduced to the world of middle Eastern and designer perfumes by my friend.

Fragrance is subjective be cause it is a complex intersection of your unique genetics, personal history, and even physical chemistry. This is my personal take on each of the decants:-

1. Armaf CDN Iconic (Blue Iconic)

• Longevity rating: 7/10 (6-8 hours)

2. Rasasi Hawas Ice

• Scent rating: 9/10
• Longevity rating: 9/10 (8–12h)

3. Afnan 9PM

• Scent rating: 8/10
• Longevity rating: 8.5/10 (~8–12h)

5. Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa

• Scent rating: 7.5/10
• Longevity rating: 9.5/10 ( ~10–12h)

6. Lattafa Asad Bourbon
• Short review: Warm, sweet-spicy gourmand (cacao/vanilla-ish warmth); very “date-night” and cozy. Got me many compliments during Christmas eve. One of the best winter fragrance.
• Scent profile: spicy warm woods with sweet gourmand facets.
• Scent rating: 8.5/10
• Longevity rating: 9/10 (~9–10h).

7. French Avenue Liquid Brun
• Short review: Smooth sweet-ambery vanilla/“luxury gourmand” feel; some call it Althaïr-like. Performance can be polarizing. Best for casual dates in winter.

• Scent rating: 8/10
• Longevity rating: 7/10 (6 hours max).

8. Rue Broca Théorème
• Short review: Sparkling citrus + airy musks in the Bvlgari Tygar direction; super wearable summer signature.Good fragrance in budget. Some people like, some didn't. I liked this but my friend didn't.

• Scent rating: 9/10
• Longevity rating: 8.5/10 (often 8h+).

12. Armaf CDNIM (Club de Nuit Intense Man) limited edition 
• Short review: The budget king for Aventus-style: harsh lemon opening, then smoky-fruity drydown. But smells like rotten Pineapples and bathroom cleaner at first which is a big turn off. Not at all worth for money. Really overhyped.

13. Al Wataniah Kayaan Classic

• Longevity rating: 6/10 (often 5-6 h).

14. Lattafa Asad (original)

• Scent profile: warm spices + woods/amber + vanilla sweetness. 
• Scent rating: 6/10
• Longevity rating: 7/10 (often 6-7 hours).

Among Aventus clones:-

Anyway, I wanted to share the few things I’m changing/trying starting now because…. well I don’t know why. Maybe to vent, maybe to get feedback.

I‘ve tried several things over the 2 years without success

* HSG-all clear
* Me and husband both taking CoQ10 (he had a good sperm analysis) 
* and LH strips-those I will continue 
* NC temping with thermometer 

And now here are the things that I can handle changing right now without getting overwhelmed/depressed

* NC temping with Oura ring
* reducing caffeine to 6 oz per day (previously drank 150-250 mg per day and tried to cut back only in fertile window/tww)
* Quit melatonin (took Beam tea to sleep 3-5 days per week and just recently learned from visiting an RE for the first time that it interacts with estrogen ugh)
* took Clomid and might keep trying it or Letrozole.. I took it for the first time this cycle (currently DPO2) and we’ll see if it helped. My obgyn for the past two years has just told me to keep trying since everything looks perfect and to assume I’m ovulating because of the LH strips and temp rise (I know that can’t confirm but we assumed I was) but maybe I need medication 🙃

Anyway that’s it for now.. I’m bummed I can’t have melatonin AND am drinking less coffee so my energy is low but I’m hoping to adjust. And I don’t want any long term issues taking Clomid but I didn’t have any symptoms this time. The next step after maybe another year is to do a laparoscopy to see if I have silent endo because who knows why I can’t get pregnant. #unexplainedibfertility",6,1767375985.0,TryingForABaby,9,1.0,False

1q2585k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/comments/1q2585k/utr_travel_router_realworld_speed_tests_thoughts/,"UTR (Travel Router) – Real-World Speed Tests, thoughts and Firmware issues!","Firstly, this is my real world notes (but written up by Ai, I have fact checked. sorry for the laziness)   
  
**TL;DR:**

UTR performance varies a lot by uplink. Wired and Wi-Fi uplinks are solid for a travel router, USB tethering has a major upload bottleneck, firmware is rough but improving, and overall it’s a capable small device that feels held back mainly by software right now.

  
  
I've been testing the UniFi UTR across several WAN scenarios and wanted to share real-world results, as behaviour changes noticeably depending on how it’s connected.

# iPhone USB Tethering

This was the most surprising result.

* **Download:** \~110 Mbps
* **Upload:** \~1.5 Mbps sustained (brief spikes higher)

For comparison, using the same phone directly (no tethering), I usually see \~200 Mbps down and \~50 Mbps up. Download is usable, but upload appears heavily constrained when tethering via the UTR.

The UTR can be powered directly from an iPhone’s USB-C port, which is very convenient. However, it’s a shame you can’t use a **single USB-C cable for both power and data tethering** at the same time. It would be interesting to see if a USB-C splitter exists that separates power and data into two male USB-C ends, but I’m not sure such a thing exists or would even negotiate correctly.

# Wired WAN

Tested with a 1 Gbit/s Ethernet link on a 2 Gbit/s connection:

* **Peak:** \~360 Mbps down / \~320 Mbps up
* **Typical:** 100–200 Mbps both ways

Not line-rate, but reasonable for such a small device.



# Wireless Uplink

Connecting the UTR to my own Wi-Fi network:

* **Average:** \~150 Mbps down / \~150 Mbps up
* **Peak:** \~200 Mbps

Very usable for hotels, offices, and shared networks.



# Boot Time

Boot time is slow but tolerable:

* Just over **2 minutes** from power-on to usable internet



# Firmware State

The weakest point right now.

* Ships with buggy, unfinished firmware
* Initial setup was rough (I had to join the Test Fllight Beta, install the old iOS app, upgrade device via SSH)
* Stability improves noticeably after updates

Feels like hardware that shipped before the software was fully ready (more on that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/s/WktN0z7NC0)). 



# Overall Thoughts

Despite the firmware issues, I’m mostly positive:

* Good performance for the size
* Wired and wireless uplinks work well
* USB tethering upload limits are disappointing and may be firmware-related

I also use a GL.iNet travel router and see the UTR as a **complementary product rather than a replacement**. It’ll likely become my daily carry (coffee shops, daily working, train plane etc), with the GL.iNet staying as a more configurable longer term travel router (think hotel room with the family).",5,1767375960.0,Ubiquiti,12,0.62,False

Medical history is overall normal - no major surgeries. Im 5’2” and around 85-90 lbs. Outside of pregnancy, I’ve been around this weight most of my adult life.

Over the two months, I’ve started feeling extremely exhausted, lightheaded, slightly nauseous upon waking up. 
I started checking my blood sugar with a glucometer I got in 2018 when i was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. 
Overall my blood sugar readings are normal, my fasting blood sugar upon waking up is usually around 60-65.
I also started checking my blood pressure with an at home cuff.
I’ve noticed that the mornings that I feel unwell, dizzy and lightheaded, excessively tired etc. my blood pressure is low… systolic is 80-85 and diastolic is usually 45-55. Pulse is in the 70s. 
I typically just try to “power through it” and I usually start feeling better after I drink some water and coffee. I work from home, so if I’m feeling crappy throughout the day I might lay down for 10-15 minutes and that helps too. I aim for 60 oz of water each day, but thought maybe I was dehydrated so I started adding electrolytes and aiming for 80 oz of water. I’m still having these issues despite that.

I’ve been checking my blood pressure once every other hour throughout the day for the past week. It seems like it’s low in the mornings, normal (95/60- 110/70) throughout the day, and then drops slightly in the evenings right before bed (90/55)

I don’t smoke, I haven’t had alcohol in 5 years, I’m not on birth control. Both of my parents have high blood pressure and started taking medication for it in their 40s. My bloodwork has always been normal as far as I know - my pcp never had any concerns.

My question is - how urgent is this? Whenever I google it, everything tells me I need to get to the ER immediately. I’m not passing out or having any other major issues … I just feel like garbage most days. I know that a blood pressure of 85/45 isn’t normal, but it goes up during the day. I’m also not sure how accurate at home digital cuffs are and I’m wondering if it’s likely that my cuff is just reading low.

Because of a change in insurance, I had to find a new PCP, and I have an annual check up with them scheduled in February - I couldn’t get in any sooner. I did mention these issues when I made the appointment and they told me I could go to urgent care if I needed to be seen before February.

One day, I told her that her office was 700 meters from mine, and she suggested we catch up for a coffee the next day. So, I met her. I think she was just viewing it as a friendship, but I was looking for a relationship. This happened in October (before Diwali). We started meeting more often, and every time we met, we went somewhere to eat.

I took her to a lot of nice places. She is from the South and I'm from the North. I was very respectful and never flirted with her for all these months. I was the one paying the bills every single time we went out. In December, I asked her out for a movie on a Sunday, but she told me to plan something else. One thing I noticed about her was that every time she texted me to meet, she always wanted to go to a place where she could eat. I started realizing she might be using me.

Five days before Christmas, we went out more often. I took her to a very nice place and spent a lot of money. On her last visit, I took her to a nice pizza place in Bangalore. I told her that she could order anything, and to my surprise, she kept on ordering. At this point, I was tired because she wasn't even interested in my life; she never asked about me. I figured out that she was just with me to use my money. She even asked me on one of our dates (if I can call it that, since I was the one paying) how much I make. I told her, and she was very happy for some reason.

Coming back to the pizza date, the bill was close to 2000. I paid instantly with my card, but I was very angry at her. For all the time we spent together, she never even talked to me about anything real. If you want to treat me as a friend, just tell me to split the bill—but she never offered. I'm the kind of guy who wouldn't directly ask a girl to pay for food when she is with me, but it felt like she was just using me for a fun time. Every time we went out, I booked an Uber, picked her up, and always dropped her home.

While coming home from that pizza place, she asked me to come with her for breakfast the next day. I said yes in the cab just to be polite, but I ignored her text the next morning. She texted again after a few days asking why I wasn't replying. I still haven't replied to her. Now it’s been about 10 days.

At this point, I'm not even sure whether I should consider her for a relationship. I want a friend because I don't have any in Bangalore, but the way she acted so greedily really made me mad. If I'm paying the bills, then it's a common understanding that I like you.

Should I text her back with some excuse? Maybe she can be a friend of mine, but I'm really mad because I spent a lot of money and she kept on using me. She has left Bangalore now because her internship is over.",2,1767375863.0,RelationshipIndia,10,1.0,False

1q25551,https://i.redd.it/l3wrbkez1zag1.png,2025 Cashflow: Spent more than ever by a wide margin in my life,"I'm grateful this past year was quite exceptional even though challenging. Above is our cashflow spend for 2025. We're a family of 3. The wife doesn't work and our child is under 2. 2025 we had a 61% savings rate. This falls pretty in line with previous years of \~65-68%

The flow isn't a hundred percent accurate for the following reasons:

1. We use cash a lot due to the country we're in relying on it heavily. So it's more burdensome to track and keep receipts of, especially for stuff my spouse buys. So there is a large chunk for ATM but a good portion of it would have gone to stuff like groceries, items for the home, car rentals, etc.
2. I use USD based banks, credit cards, wise, so there are minor fees, atm refunds, wise transfer fees that can get bucketed all in one. For example, I try to send only one wise transfer a month which includes everything we will need for payments in local currency (rent, internet, utilities), I can't be bothered to drill down on the exact exchange rate, minus fees, etc. all the time.

The goal for 2026 is likely to generalize some of these categories more as I don't really care for how much we paid for water utilities when the overall fixed costs (rent, utilities, internet) is sufficient for me.",0,1767375776.0,MonarchMoney,8,0.44,False

My ex of 2.5 years broke up with me because he said he didn’t love me anymore. It was out of the blue and I was so heartbroken we didn’t speak for 2 months after it, I did get over it pretty quick as we were in a long distance relationship so didn’t really see him much anyway.

A couple of weeks ago he messaged me and we got talking and we were on call most days I knew this was going to be a bad idea but I just wanted to hear from him. Anyways we both agreed to meet up for coffee and talk about the relationship and the break up and be mature adults about it. 

So some context before we met up he kept calling me days before and even the night before when he’s had a couple of drinks in him and we did talk about the break up. He kept saying how much he wishes things were different and he wishes he could go back, he said at the time I thought I didn’t love you and I had a whole future planned with you he even said I wish you cheated so that it would be easier. 

But yesterday when we met for coffee we were talking and I asked do you regret it and he said no not at all, that really broke me as I feel like I’ve been getting mixed signals he said he wouldn’t get back together and that he wasn’t in love with me. I know getting back together wouldn’t work out but hearing it from him was so upsetting. We ended up sleeping together that night and I don’t regret it because I know what I got myself into. 

But now he won’t stop texting me but doesn’t want anything from me I’m just so confused, he’s giving me different answers about everything. What do I do.

I am 34 years old.  My mother lives with me as she has lots of health problems.

3 times a week on hair wash days, I take a nice long hot bath. Water is not running. I fill my tub, shut it off, and enjoy my bath.

I pay the bills as she does not work and is trying to get approved for disability. Also it’s my house. So no I’m not living with her. 

EVERYTIME I turn around she is constantly nagging me about my baths. 

I’m a single mom, I don’t do anything for myself - I don’t remember the last time I got a hair cut, nails done, heck even a coffee for myself - anything like that. I go to work, take care of my kids, take care of her, eat and sleep. That’s all I do.  

Our relationship has always been rocky, I’ve tried cutting her off years ago, and it just. Did. Not. Work.   Another story for another time.

Anyways…

1q24xzh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q24xzh,"Seborrheic dermatitis/malessezia? Help, the skin SAGA continues...","I need help, still 🤦🏻‍♀️ over the last 3 months my skin has gone haywire! I made a post a couple months ago regarding my neck (which cleared) but my lips/forehead/scalp/ears are now flaring. I apologize in advance for how long this might be.

My naturopath wants me to do a gut cleanse, but I am not about to drop $200+ on something that might not help and potentially cause more issues. I've already spent so much money on supplements that haven't done anything for me over the years. She's not pro-carnicore, but loves Paleo. I'm also not about to go to the dermatologist for them to give me a prescription cream that doesn't help the root cause and is only toxic. So, here we go...

I have been using Grok to try and get some answers, but maybe someone on here has some insight or has experienced something like this first hand. Grok is saying that my dry, flakey skin could be seborrheic dermatitis or possibly malessezia. It's on my scalp, forehead, lips, eyebrows, behind my ears, and in my ears. Honestly, I can't say that it's ever been this widespread. I live in the PNW (always get dry hands this time of year), 31, 16 months postpartum, and breastfeed about 3x a day.

My routine for the last 2 years has been Sun and Moo oil cleansing and The Healer tallow balm (tallow, baobab, tamanu). Lately I've been cleansing with Stone and Spear exfoliating facial cleanser bar to try and help with the flaking- but nothing seems to be working- more tallow, less tallow, new cleanser, sticking with the oil cleansing. I use Calia Natural shampoo and conditioner for my scalp, but I'm beginning to wonder if I have a reaction to coconut, which is the main ingredient in the shampoo and conditioner. I used to use a coconut oil chapstick, but since stopping and using the actual Chapstick brand, my lips have improved. I have also tried tallow/castor oil/beeswax lip balm and there was zero improvement.

Is tallow or oil somehow feeding the skin bacteria on my face and scalp!? I've seen DermaZen click-bait adds for my scalp, but I can't tell if it's legit or not by the comments. I would really like to try Buffalo Gal tallow shampoo bar (not the MSM one) and ACV rinse, but I don't know if it would help or make things worse!? There are so many mixed reviews and I would really love to stick with natural products! 

Could this also be an egg, dairy, or coffee issue? I'm willing to drop all 3 if this fixes my skin. I've started having decaf coffee again the last 2ish months, which I have with Alexandre A2 heavy cream. I eat farm eggs from a friend that are fed food scraps and corn/soy free fed. I feel so dry and uncomfortable! Any diet input welcome as well!

1q24vvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyperthyroidism/comments/1q24vvd/normal_blood_test_palpiations_weight_gain/,"Normal blood test, palpiations, weight gain","Hi everyone! I’m a 25F and was diagnosed with Graves’ disease in July 2025. My first symptoms were weight loss, fatigue, and palpitations. I was put on 20 mg methimazole (carbimazole) and beta blockers, and within a month my thyroid levels normalised, so I slowly came off the beta blockers and stayed on the antithyroid meds. About 2.5–3 months after diagnosis, I started having hypothyroid symptoms and my white blood cell count dropped (in addition to increase in tsh and decrease in t4), which my doctor said was a side effect of the meds, so my dose was reduced from 20 mg to 5 mg. My blood tests have been in range since November (just over 2 months now), but I’ve gained around 6–7 kg and I’m now heavier than I was before hyperthyroidism.

I was advised to slow down and stop intense cardio, so I switched to only strength training. Since my levels were stable and I wasn’t losing weight, I added light cardio again: about 20 minutes of walking and 20 minutes on the stairmaster before lifting. Lately though, I’ve started feeling palpitations again. Sometimes even light movement in the morning (before coffee) puts my heart rate at 120, and sometimes when I’m just sitting it goes over 100. It’s not every day, but it does happen. During cardio it goes up to around 175 max, which I know is normal for my age.

I’m planning to see a cardiologist, but people around me keep telling me I’m checking my heart rate too much and that it’s probably anxiety or me overthinking it. Still, it feels like something is off. Am I exaggerating? Could the palpitations be coming back because I restarted cardio like the stairmaster (before my diagnoses I was doing boxing, running and hiit every week), or does this sound familiar to anyone else?",1,1767375210.0,Hyperthyroidism,0,1.0,False

Not that adventurous usually but the idea and discussion of sharing/cuckolding got both of us going in a pretty big way. We were really scared to actually do it though, so while we had started talking to a guy this summer, she got cold feet and tabled it for a bit. We became friends with the guy though and after talking for a while decided to go for it. 

We did it earlier this week and it ended up being really great in a lot of ways! It was definitely nerve wracking and very weird but amazing too. We have been horny messes since that night and want to do it again. 

Here's the conundrum-

When we did it, she had wanted the first actual time of sex to be one on one with him. So we all went for coffee together, then a few days later all went out for drinks, and he came home with us. They went to the bedroom by themselves at first, and then came out and I watched the second round. 

In now talking about doing it again, she's said that the solo part was much more comfortable and what she'd like to do going forward. She said the watching part might be something she's open to very occasionally and it would have to be ""a very special occasion"". 

I think I still want to move forward with things and just see where it goes, as who knows as we've only done it the once so far. But wondering if this is common, how others feel about, what has worked for others and whether it's better to sort of invest in this ""solo exploration"" thing vs trying to make it so fetishy.

Idk just trying to work this out in my head so thoughts help.

1q24s2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1q24s2l/prompting_like_a_professional/,Prompting Like a Professional,"I used to think a lot about prompting. I actually still do. It used to be about input-output; that is, thinking about how to maximize or optimize the output of a narrow, single prompt for a narrow, specific need. Lately, however, working with Cursor, I've come to realize my focus has shifted. It's less about prompt-crafting, it's more about controlling the agent orchestration.

If you tell Cursor, say 1, it will literally just say 1. If you tell it to write feature x, it will write feature x. If you tell it to write it using this mcp, for example, or that specific library (tailwind, shadcn, etc), it will do it. So yes, being specific where it matters still counts for A LOT.

However there is something deeper and more fundamental than specificity. There's context fundamentals. Because what I've seen happen a lot is that it shits out a ton of code but there are bugs, either it's completely broken or in certain use cases it bugs out. You can go and copy paste the output of the bugs, the console logs, the screenshots, etc, but that's just plain onerous.

Then I realized this: ""Write me this feature, defined like so, using this and that, AND THEN WRITE TESTS WITH COMPLETE COVERAGE (api or playwright, and/or unit, depending on the feature or how anal you are), and then RUN the tests, and if they don't all pass, analyze the root cause, fix the code or the tests, whichever was broken, RERUN the tests, and do this ITERATIVELY until it all passes.

This has literally changed my life. Both professionally and personally (for my personal coding projects - my ability to deliver features in my [ai therapist app](https://therapywithai.com/) shot up by 100% easily). I literally put in this prompt, tailored to my situation, and go and get my cup of coffee. Watch it work, finish my coffee, and then go get another, lol. Complete game changer.

It came to me from someone I met a few years back who happens to be a police officer in NC along the coast. I'll call him Jim. This takes place in 1987, back when police cruisers didn't have the ""cage"" on the back of the seats. The conversation between Jim and others is embellished for storytelling purposes. All the conversations were real but told to me in a different manner. He has ok'd my version.

Jim is a police officer in a small coastal town along the outer banks in NC. He's been on the force about 3 years and enjoys his job. Not much happens other than some drunk and disorderly calls, an occasional break-in on an unlocked vehicle, and routine domestic arguments that disturb the peace. There were a couple of bad car accidents a few years back and one local girl disappeared but she was a known runaway so the townsfolk didn't think too much of it.

It's late summer, the end of September, and a strong thunderstorm is approaching. It's around 2:30 pm in the afternoon and the clouds are darkening and beginning to gather. It's still daylight so nothing made it seem anything other than a normal summer storm brewing.

Jim was cruising down the main road in town, making sure to keep the speed below 25 in case any of the locals or vacationing tourists needed anything. He kept his eyes peeled, scanning the properties and between homes and buildings for the local kids and drunks looking to get into mischief or digging thru garbage cans. This kind of weather always brought them out because everyone else was inside.

Jim had a local radio station playing, trying to keep up with the weather, but it was becoming more static than anything so he turned it off and decided to call dispatch for an update just as the rain started to fall.

""One-twelve to dispatch. Come in dispatch.""

""Dispatch here. Everything all right out there, Jim?""

""Rain just started. Any update on this storm?""

""Weather station said to expect heavy rain and strong wind gusts up to 65 mph. A water spout was spotted about a mile off coast. Said it was a big one. Not out ruling a possible tornado inland. Localized flooding. You know the routine.""

""Yeah. Let's pray this one blows out as quick as it blows in.""

""10-4. Keep me posted.""

""10-4. Stopping to refuel.""

Jim pulled into the gas station and proceeded to fill up his cruiser. Jim pulled on his yellow rain slicker and plastic covering for his cap and watched the rain come down harder, creating wide puddles just outside the canopy. He hung up the nozzle and walked inside to pay, exchanging a few words with the cashier, Julia.

On his way back to his patrol car, Jim noticed a young woman standing on the roadside just across the highway. He got in his car and watched her for a couple of minutes. She stood there with her arms folded across her chest, white t-shirt soaked so much that you could see the light colored bikini top underneath, denim shorts, and white sneakers. She looked like she might be waiting for someone but he didn't understand why she didn't wait inside the store instead of getting soaked with a storm approaching.

He started his car and slowly pulled out, stopping in front of her. He rolled down the window. 16, maybe 17, years old, long blonde hair now soaked and stuck to her face and arms, blue eyes, and shivering. Her t-shirt had the photo of a band and said Romantics on it. She was a very pretty girl. Beautiful, in fact. Not the kind of girl you'd expect to be waiting on anyone, especially in this weather.

""Ma'am are you OK? Do you need a ride somewhere?""

She didn't speak at first. Jim could tell that she was scared and not sure what to do.

""Ma'am, if you need a ride I'll take you but if not, you should at least go inside the store. A storm is approaching and you don't want to be out here when it gets bad.""

The rain is coming down harder now and Jim can see her flinch as the fat droplets bombard her face and body. After a few seconds she speaks.

""I was waiting for a ride home but they haven't showed up. My brother was supposed to come but he's been known to forget if he gets sidetracked by his friends.""

""Well, that's not very responsible of him. Where do you live? I'll take you home.""

""Watercrest Way. It's in the Plantation subdivision.""

""I know where that is. Hop in.""

Jim watched her open the door and slide into the passenger seat. He noticed she was shivering so badly her teeth were chattering so he reached behind the seat and grabbed his lightweight patrol jacket.

""Here, put this on. I don't have a towel but this will keep you warm until we get you home""

She put on the jacket and the size of it made her look like a little girl playing dress-up. He noticed a grey paisley Swatch watch on her left wrist with a red and black band and some multi-colored rubber bracelets on her right. She had small gold ball earrings in and a small scar across the outer edge of her left eyebrow.

""I'm Jim, by the way. What's your name?

""Izzy. It's short for Isabella. I was named after my grandmother.""

""Nice to meet you, Izzy. How 'bout we get you home?""

The drive was short, about 2 miles, and Izzy explained that she had spent the night with a girlfriend and they stayed up late watching rented videos. She woke too late to get a ride home from her gf's Dad and her Mom said she had to be home before the storm came in. Her brother was going to be in trouble for leaving her there.

Now here comes the weird part.

Jim pulled up to the address he was given. Izzy thanked him and reached for the door handle at the exact moment another cruiser pulled alongside. Jim turned his head to the left and rolled down his window. It was the Chief.

""Jim, what are you doing sitting in the middle of the road? You need to get back to the station. This storm is coming in hard.""

""I was just dropping off a young girl at home, Chief. She was stranded.""

""What young girl? I watched your headlights as you pulled up and stopped but there was no young girl that got out.""

Jim whipped his head to the right and sure enough, the seat was wet but empty and the car door just slightly ajar.

""She was right here, Chief! My door is still open. Just how in the hell did she get inside that fast?""

""Are you sure you're alright? You look like you're about to be sick.""

""Wait a damned minute! I know she was here because I talked to her and my seat is wet where she sat! Where's my jacket? Chief I gave her my jacket to wear because she was so cold. Now my jacket is gone!""

Jim opened his door and walked around to the passenger side. There, on the wet pavement, was his jacket, now soaked from the rain. Jim picked up his jacket and showed it to the Chief.

""Chief, I don't know what's going on but here's my jacket. I swear to you, that girl was wearing my jacket and now...now...I just don't know what to think. Where the hell did she go?""

""Jim, I'll follow you back to the station. I think you're having some sort of hallucination and it's affecting your ability to judge reality from fantasy. Well get you something to eat and some coffee and talk about after.""

Jim closed the passenger door and walked back around, tossing his wet jacket into the backseat. He got behind the wheel and pulled off, watching the Chief turn around and follow him back to the station.

After eating and explaining everything to the Chief, the Chief got up and came back with a file folder and dropped it on the table.

""Jim, before you open that I need to ask you a few questions. That file is of a missing persons case that, well to be honest, we all didn't put much into it because the girl was a known runaway. I'm now thinking it could be something else. Have you heard of this case before today?""

""Yeah, I heard of it but never looked into it because everyone kept saying she ran off with her boyfriend and that she did it all the time. She was close to the legal age so I let it go. Why?""

""I'll get to that. Had you ever seen this girl before today? Maybe at the store, or on the beach...maybe bumped into her when shopping for groceries? Does she look familiar at all?""

""No, Chief. Never. I would have remembered seeing her. The girl that got into my car was a beautiful young lady. She'd be hard to forget.""

""Ok. Look at the file and tell me what you find.""

Jim opened the folder and was hit with the photo of the same girl he just had in his car. The same long blonde hair, same bright blue eyes, same scar on her left eyebrow. Her name was Isabella Roseland (not her real name), 17, filed as a missing person on September 17th, 1983. History of running away from home. Last seen by Kendra Aslign (not her real name either), a classmate, the afternoon of September 16th, 1983. Last seen wearing the same clothing, same shoes, even the same jewelry as what Jim had seen her wearing.

Jim read the statements from her parents, brother, classmate and classmates parents. Izzy had walked to her girlfriends house to spend the night. They swam and watched movies, ordered pizza, and stayed up most of the night. Izzy left the gf house around 1:00 to walk home. It was a 3 mile walk that she did all the time and during the day was safe. With the storm, Izzy's mother told her to wait at the store if it started raining and her brother would pick her up. Her brother forgot and went looking for her after the storm come in, around 4pm, but he couldn't find her. The clerk at the store said she never came in, must have gotten a ride with someone. Izzy was regularly seen there and would often catch rides with friends to the beach or someone's house. Parents were stable, both worked high paying jobs. Brother 21, college graduate, has his own apartment and manages a restaurant in town. Izzy was known to runaway from home if she didn't get what she wanted. Had previously dated a guy named Macon Whitting (yep, not his name either) who was 3 years older. Parents disapproved because he had no ambition and was from a lower class family. Macon was still in Indiana for the summer with his grandparents. He hadn't spoken to her since July, on the day before he left.

Jim was shocked and more than a little spooked. He didn't know what to think. Had he seen a ghost? Did he just actually have a conversation with someone who is dead? Did he really have a ghost in his car? Does he have a brain aneurysm that is causing hallucinations? All these questions were running thru Jim's brain now. He just couldn't believe this was happening to him.

After a few minutes, the Chief told him that when the storm was over, he wanted Jim to take him to the exact spot where he picked this girl up and that he was going to reopen the investigation. This time they would approach it as a homicide.

Two days later Jim, the Chief and a Sgt., who was their lead investigator, went to the spot where Jim saw Izzy. They geared up and while walking through the wet, marshy overgrowth, came upon the skeletal remains of Isabella Roseland. She was still wearing the same clothes, shoes and watch she was last seen in.

Jim said the coroner's report stated she died from a broken neck, probably caused by asphyxiation, but because there was very little tissue remaining, it was inconclusive.

Whatever happened to her, she didn't deserve to die like that. Just because you can't have someone, don't like someone, or are jealous of someone, doesn't give anyone the right to take their life away.

Jim is now the Chief of Police in this small coastal town. He said he has never picked up another person since then and that the ghost of Izzy still haunts him to this day.",4,1767374912.0,Paranormal,12,0.67,False

The West Nipissing gathering is scheduled for **Tuesday, January 6, from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.** at Twiggs Coffee Roasters on King Street in Sturgeon Falls.

The New Year’s Levée is a long-standing Canadian tradition where elected officials host open public receptions near the start of the year. Bélanger’s local visit offers residents a chance to meet their federal representative in an informal setting, share greetings, and raise questions directly.

The levée events follow a federal election campaign where Bélanger did not take part in public debates, limiting opportunities for in-person discussion during the campaign period. The Sturgeon Falls stop gives West Nipissing residents a rare face-to-face opportunity to speak with the MP outside of Parliament.

In addition to the West Nipissing event, Bélanger will also host levées on **Thursday, January 8, from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.** in Chelmsford, and **Monday, January 12, from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.** in Espanola.

**Introduction**  
This is a long shot but hey... silver lining, am I right? If you fancy someone whom you can enjoy the silence with and also talk to for hours nonstop, you might find this interesting.

**About me**  
I will tell you my actual name once we hit it off, but right now it's **Jeff** for you. I'm 25 and turning 26 next year (Almost a grandpa). I like Dogs, books, good films, a smoke at the right time and place, and a good dirty chai.


**Why I'm Here**  
I've had a few relationships in the past, and none of them worked out long-term for various reasons. Looking back, there was a sense of performance that I had to partake in to keep the ""idea"" of me alive in their heads. I believe that exhaustion contributed to things ending. After a long while of being just by myself and a lot of intellectualization, I realized that the more unfiltered I am, the more I attract things that actually *stay* with me. This proved true in almost every aspect of my life. So, the answer to the question is: When I lay things about me out in the open like this, it means I don't have to look over my shoulder waiting for some mask to come off. It allows me to just BE.

**The Details**  

* ***Books:*** My two favorite books I've read so far is *The Stranger* and *The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows.* Currently reading *The Moral Animal* and *Why Buddhism is True*. 
* ***Music:*** My current daily listen is *Heaven* by Blaze. I also make some amazing Spotify playlists but there's nobody to share them with (hence why I'm here). 
* ***Films:*** I have 5 films I will never forget: *Before Sunrise, Filth, The Jacket, Trainspotting 2,* and *Requiem for a Dream*. 
* ***Career:*** I work as a **Video Game Artist** (started off as a designer). I believe I will always find purpose and joy despite whatever I am doing or the circumstances.  

I make an amazing tea for myself almost every morning while watching my dog play in the sun, it's one of my favorite parts of the day. I find happiness in the smallest things: the warmth of the sun on my skin, birds chit-chatting, the cold wind at night, and branches of medium-sized bushes grazing my skin (I promise I'm not crazy).

One of my biggest fears is that I would go on living my life not being witnessed by anyone. I would want them to notice each and every part of me. The good, the bad, and the ugly. the paradoxical traits that makes me, ME. I don't want to wither away like a piece of art hidden in a museum's vault nor be collected by someone who does not admire.

**Extras** (Randoms)

* I'm a huge lord of the rings nerd.
* I like to make things just for the sake of creating something out of nothing.
* I have a pretty cool PC setup.
* As of now I have sold 10 really cool big artworks to my friends and they love it (at least they tell me they do)
* I like getting into the lore and the details of anything, especially in films.
* I really like riding motorcycles.

**Socially**

* I have about 3 extremely close friends whom I would gladly call family; I would kill for them.
* I love to cook for other people and it's something I take a bit of pride in ( I make a killer spaghetti)
* I may not be the most altruistic person, but I try to help anyone that I care about.
* I like doing stupid risky things with my friends that don't always guarantee safety...but you only live once, right? RIGHT????

**Few philosophies** (or one)  
I view life through a mix of absurdism and a primal appreciation for the small things. I don't believe in a grand pre-destined plan, which I find very liberating for me because it means ""meaning"" is found in the immediate moment, whether that's a cup of tea/coffee, the warmth of the sun, or a conversation that lasts until 4 AM and you don't sleep the next day. I believe we spend too much of our lives performing for an invisible audience, letting people fall in love with versions of us that don’t exist. I judge character by authenticity and how you treat people who can do nothing for you. I’d rather be disliked for the raw reality of who I am than loved for a person I am not.

**What I Look Like**  
I would say I'm not on the unattractive side of things.

* **Build:** Lean, Brown Skinned, 70kg (hah, metrics!) and about 5'9"".
* **Features:** Deep-set eyes and high cheekbones... do these even matter?

**The Logistics**

* **You:** Ideally aged **18-26**, healthy, single, and female.
* **Dealbreakers:** Kids.
* **Communication:** I would like for things to come slow. Given the nature of my work, I'm pretty much always online on Discord, WhatsApp, and whatever else.

If any of this resonated with you, whether it’s the love for a life filled absurdity, the hatred of performing, or just the need for a good dirty chai OR SPAGHETTI...shoot me a message ;)

I’m 32. I spent a lot of my 20s in bed and depressed. Having come out of it, I want to make up for lost time but it just feels like too little too late.

In most of my friendships, they have shifted from the going out and going to events/shows to dinners and walks with coffee. Most of my friends are in long term partnership or are not the going out types. While I enjoy the company and dinners with friends, I don’t have a partnership and I spend a lot of time by myself.

I had tried dating and it made me so aggressively anxious that I pull back hard on it and am taking a slow approach.

I’m dating someone I like who treats me well, but I feel very apathetic about the future, and feel that mostly do it because I want someone to do things with.

While I’m planning on going back to school, I have a real lack of excitement over it.

It feels like my youth is completely over, that life will be less and less exciting and interesting until I die.

I spend my days working at a job that is no longer challenging to me, low key dinners with friends, binging movies, and trying to build healthy habits (like pursuing running) which feel pointless because why am I trying to extend my boring life.

Traveling is kind of out of the question as have little time off. Maybe I could try a new hobby but I have mountains of things I did for a couple of years and got bored with. I live in a big city with a lot of outdoor culture but no one to do it with.

Then when I go to clean up, it takes me 5 minutes to get the dang thing loose. Then when I get it loose, the basket is stuck, there's still water in the bottom, and the grounds are still wet, so I can't knock the puck loose easily.

To screw on the top easier and deal with heat expansion, I've tried preheating it to match the bottom. I've tried cooling the bottom when trying to take it a part. But the lack of grip seems to be the biggest issue. 

Knocking out the grounds is a bit cumbersome, but that seems to be a part of the deal.

It happens to be the top one on the city and I love coffee and I had barista experience. 
In my past job I was recognized as ""very good at coffee"" and I carry all the weigth of the coffee shop. I basically built the foundation but then a ""Gastronomic consultant"" came in and things started to change, items got taken off the menu, pricing got up while bean and Bean quality stayed the same. It was a fuckfest. 

So, the moment I walked in the new shop I inmediatamently felt not welcomed, bias for the past baristas was high and I didn't felt recognized even thougth my speed was higher. I was clear when I got into the shop, I lacked feedback and I knew my own perception of pourover and drinks was probably bias I explicity told the owner and roaster ""I like my own pour overs, but I don't know how other's think of them"" and It was implicit i'll recieve feedback. 

co-workers didn't seem to get along w/ me, just the people that recommended me but they drank a lot of pour over, more than I could handle and I felt like It was kind-of forced on me to drink coffee at their times so I stepped back on it. 
Kitchen personel stepped on the coffee station quite a bit and I was always cornered but I didn't complain because getting on that shop was my goal since I started as a barista so I endure even if my capacity decreased. 
Floor personnel always took a lot to deliver my drinks and moved tickets out of position while I was reading them or made mistakes on them, asked drinks during closing and basically made my life impossible. I was given zero chances to shine and I always felt body blocked.

I was under the impression that baristas didn't deal w/ grinder calibration just keeping shots consistent in timing but It seem that something other was expected for me.
I was brewing pour-over as I usually do, till the owner corrected me on the water ammount and strength. 
After all of this I was under a lot of pressure and felt like I couldn't handle things and that maybe I was the a bad barista even thougth I know I am capable I feel like maybe I am on the Dunning-Kruger effect or under impostor syndrome... that's all I guess.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around some tables and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Each week we typically get a mix of regulars, people who drop by occasionally and a few newbies.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs

\~bloating 

\~uncomfortable UTI feeling, such as my urethra feeling uncomfortable, burning and uncomfortable feeling in my pelvis

\~a horrible constant painful arousal feeling 

These symptoms have periodically disappeared but come back, and it’s exhausting 

I have been to my GP had my urine tested, no UTI infection- when this started I did take antibiotics. I have tried probiotics, d-mannose and cranberry tablets. 

When I have approx 21 years old I had a year of chronic cystitis, I remember seeing a urologist but can’t remember the outcome- I just know it eventually disappeared.

Since that experience I always take precautions to not cause a UTI. 

I do not have a STD and have been with the same partner for 12 years. 

I really don’t want to go through what I went through all those years ago, I can’t take the constant irritation and awareness of my vagina. It’s painful and is effecting my mood.

I want help but don’t know where to go, I don’t see the point of speaking to my make GP as recently speaking to me he just kept asking me if I use soap products on vagina, which I clearly explained I don’t, and he told me to drink lots of tea/coffee- which is a bladder irritated. 

The other issue is the more I’m aware of it the more I think about it? Which has me questioning if it’s all it my head?

People with experience- which specialist would I need to see? I would debate paying for a private consultation as I can’t cope with this.

Him and I both discovered our passion for aviation at the age of 18, in which was my first solo flight to SFO.

When I turned 18, I had the privilege to connect with 2 fellow delta captain and his co-pilot. They were kind enough to invite me to their cockpit, give me a tour, encouraged me to chase after my dream of becoming a pilot because there is a lack of female representation, the captain even was kind enough to take off his hat so that I could wear it and he allowed me to sit on his seat and took a photo for me in it to save the moment. After that, I just completely fell in love with aviation and I absolutely cannot explain why I love it so much when people ask me. I guess the best explaination would be, like how a car guy loves car, I on the other hand is like that but with airplanes and the engineering behind it.

The banker that I was able to connect with told me that the reason why he chose IB was because he was able to make a lot more money hence why he chose it, but still yearns to become a pilot. After the chat I thanked him for his time and that i am really considering the aviation path but he responded with ""Everyone at flight school hates their lives for 4 years until they make it to the airlines 3-4 years So it’s basically IB except you are so poor you can’t go out. Maybe not an issue in GA bc you have housing and it’s medium cost of living. It of course took me way longer to get to commercial pilot (4 years vs 1 year if I quit my job) but I made a lot more money"". So he basically told me to stick it out in IB since I will make a lot more money, but is IB worth the money of givng up something that I have such passion in? Is it really THAT much money?

I am now in a pickle whether I should continue pursuing IB or pursue my dream in aviation. What do you guys think?",1,1767374096.0,careerguidance,2,1.0,False

1q24at7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductNew/comments/1q24at7/which_smart_plugs_are_best_for_small_apartments/,Which smart plugs are best for small apartments?,"Living in a small apartment means every inch of space matters, and smart plugs can help you maximize both convenience and efficiency without taking up extra room.

Smart plugs are tiny devices that transform any regular outlet into a smart one. You simply plug them into your wall outlet, then plug your appliances into them. Within minutes, you can control lamps, coffee makers, fans, and other devices from your phone or voice assistant.

**Space-Saving Benefits for Apartments**

The best smart plugs for small spaces are compact and don't block your second outlet. Look for models with slim designs that sit flush against the wall. Some even come with USB ports, giving you extra charging options without needing separate adapters.

**Key Features to Consider**

When choosing smart plugs for your apartment, focus on these important features:

- **WiFi connectivity** - Works with your existing internet without needing extra hubs
- **Voice control** - Compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri
- **Scheduling** - Set timers for lights and appliances automatically
- **Energy monitoring** - Track how much electricity your devices use
- **Away mode** - Makes it look like you're home when traveling

**Top Smart Plug Options**

Mini smart plugs work great for apartments because they're small and affordable. You can control multiple devices through one app on your phone. Many people use them for table lamps, coffee makers, air purifiers, and phone chargers.

Smart outlets with USB ports are perfect for bedrooms and living areas where you need both regular plugs and charging spots. These eliminate the need for bulky charging blocks.

WiFi smart switches are another option if you want to control overhead lights or bathroom fans. These replace your regular light switches and don't take up any outlet space.

**Easy Setup Process**

Most wireless smart plugs connect to your home WiFi in under five minutes. You download the manufacturer's app, plug in the device, and follow the simple setup steps. No special tools or electrical knowledge needed.

Once connected, you can create schedules, set timers, and group multiple smart plugs together. For example, you could create a ""bedtime"" scene that turns off all your living room devices at once.

**Money-Saving Benefits**

Smart plugs help reduce your electric bill by eliminating phantom power draw. Many electronics use electricity even when turned off, but smart plugs can completely cut power to these devices. The energy monitoring feature shows exactly how much each appliance costs to run.

You can also schedule devices to run during off-peak hours when electricity rates are lower. This works great for things like phone chargers or small appliances that don't need to run all day.

**Getting Started**

If you want to check out some highly-rated smart plug options, you can [browse popular models here](https://athomewave.com/smart-plugs). Start with one or two plugs to test them out, then add more as you discover new ways to use them.

Smart home automation doesn't have to be complicated or expensive. With the right smart plugs, you can make your small apartment more convenient and energy-efficient without any major changes to your space.

Remember to check that any smart plug you choose works with your preferred voice assistant and has good customer reviews. The best smart plugs for apartments combine reliability, compact size, and useful features that actually improve your daily routine.

1q248mx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q248mx,Sustainability trends shaping 2026: What actually matters for businesses?,"I’ve been digging into how [sustainability](https://www.iebrain.com/industry/decarbonization-sustainability/) is evolving beyond branding and pledges, and a few patterns keep showing up across regions and industries. Curious how others here see it playing out. 

**1. AI is finally making ESG usable, not just reportable**   
A lot of companies struggled with ESG because the data was slow, manual, and backward-looking. That’s changing fast. 

Platforms like **Greenly** and **Watershed** use AI to track Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions in near-real time. That matters because it lets teams act, not just publish annual reports. This seems especially strong in Europe and the US, where regulation and investor pressure are pushing for better data. 

**Question: Do you see AI-driven ESG as a fundamental operational tool yet, or is it still mostly compliance-driven?** 

**2. Big clean energy bets signal long-term strategy**   
Some companies are going far beyond offsets. 

* Microsoft has committed around $10B toward wind and solar, targeting 10.5 GW of clean energy, enough to power roughly 1.8 million homes by 2030. 
* Apple already runs global operations on 100% renewable energy and has issued $4.7B in green bonds to fund clean energy projects. 

This feels less like “green PR” and more like hedging against energy volatility and regulation. 

**Do you think mid-sized companies will follow, or is this only realistic for tech giants?** 

**3. Renewables are moving into daily operations, not just procurement**   
Some tech firms are integrating renewables directly into how they operate. 

* Nvidia reached 100% renewable electricity for offices and controlled data centers in 2025. 
* Google has matched its energy use with renewable purchases since 2017 and is pushing toward 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030, which is a more complex problem than annual matching. 

This raises the bar from “we buy green energy” to “our operations run on it.” 

**Is 24/7 carbon-free energy the next real benchmark, or still too niche?** 

**4. Nature-based solutions are back, but with supply chain logic**   
Tree planting is getting more targeted and less symbolic. 

* Nestlé and Barry Callebaut plan to plant 11 million trees across Brazil’s cocoa and coffee regions to support farmers, stabilize supply chains, and generate carbon credits. 
* Unilever continues to invest in agroforestry and sustainable sourcing rather than standalone offset projects. 

This ties sustainability directly to raw material security, especially in Latin America. 

**Do you trust corporate-led reforestation efforts, or do you think they need stronger third-party oversight?** 

**Big question for 2026:**   
**Which of these trends actually changes how businesses operate, and which ones fade once the pressure eases?**

But wait, his real power move? The guy looks 45, crushes 18-hour days without a caffeine crash, and drops quantum physics quips at dinner parties like it's small talk. That's not Botox or black-market HGH; it's \*longevity\*—the ultimate status symbol for the 1%. In a world where billionaires like Bryan Johnson are biohacking their way to vampire vibes, slapping a diamond bezel on your wrist feels as dated as a flip phone. Longevity isn't just living longer; it's looking sharper, performing fiercer, feeling unbreakable, and keeping a mind like a steel trap well into your 80s. It's the new currency of the elite, trading time for timelessness. And the kicker? You don't need a yacht to cash in—if you know the playbook.

The Great Glow-Up: Why Watches Are Out, Wrinkles Are the Enemy

Remember when a Rolex said ""I've made it""? Flash forward to now: Luxury's gone inward. Bain & Company pegs the personal luxury goods market chugging along at 3-5% growth in 2026, but the real boom? Wellness and longevity, exploding as affluent travelers treat ""healthspan"" like high-stakes investing. Forbes reports ultra-wealthy jet-setters are ditching Maldives vacays for ""longevity retreats""—think cryotherapy pods in the Alps or NAD+ drips in Dubai—viewing them as ROI on their most precious asset: time. Why? Because in the C-suite or crypto boardroom, it's not your net worth that closes deals anymore—it's your edge. A 2025 Marriott survey nails it: Affluent guests crave ""longevity experiences"" blending self-care with transformation, outpacing even experiential travel.



For the 1%, this means outsourcing aging to science. We're talking senolytics to zap zombie cells, peptides for muscle that defies gravity, and AI-driven genomics to tweak your DNA like a Spotify playlist. The payoff? \*Looking younger\*: Skin that bounces back like it's 25, hairlines holding the line, eyes that sparkle without filters. \*Performing better\*: VO2 max that rivals Olympians, recovery from spin classes in hours, not days. \*Feeling unbreakable\*: Hormonal harmony that nukes mood swings, sleep like a log in a warzone. And the crown jewel? A \*sharp mind at any age\*—no fog, just laser focus, creativity that compounds like interest, and memory recall that makes Jeopardy kids weep. It's not vanity; it's velocity. Jeff Bezos didn't build Blue Origin on naps; he built it on protocols that keep his neurons firing like fireworks. In 2026, per Hone Health's trend roundup, this ""high life worth"" is defined by nervous system resets, metabolic flexibility via GLP-1 tweaks, and oral microbiome hacks—turning your body into a Ferrari that runs forever.



But here's the plot twist: This isn't some gated Elysium for Elon-level wallets. Longevity's democratizing faster than you can say ""intermittent fasting."" The science that once cost a kidney (looking at you, $25K stem cell infusions) is trickling down via apps, off-label meds, and clinics that don't require a private jet. Everyday folks are hacking it with smart swaps: Cold plunges over coffee runs, red-light therapy lamps from Amazon, and blood panels cheaper than a gym membership. TravelPulse calls it the ""longevity travel"" wave, with 2026 retreats blending luxury and accessibility—sauna socials in Sedona or breathwork in Bali for under $2K. Condé Nast Traveler echoes: Wellness is shedding its woo-woo skin for evidence-based upgrades, like star bathing (aka grounding under the night sky) that syncs your circadian rhythm without a trust fund.

Hacking the Eternal: Blueprints for the Rest of Us

So, how does the 99% join the immortality club? Start simple, scale smart. \*Look younger\*: Ditch the $10K facelift for retinoids, hyaluronic serums, and microneedling kits—proven to boost collagen 30% in months, per dermatology meta-studies. Pair with sun-smart habits; UV is the silent ager. \*Perform better\*: Zone 2 cardio (that brisk walk-jog sweet spot) builds mitochondria like Lego bricks, while resistance training twice weekly keeps sarcopenia at bay. Supplements? NMN for cellular repair, creatine for gains—both under $50/month. \*Feel younger\*: Prioritize sleep hygiene (blackout curtains, magnesium glycinate) and stress-busters like vagus nerve toning via humming or cold showers. \*Sharp mind\*: Lifelong learners crush it with omega-3s, Lion's Mane mushrooms, and apps like Duolingo for neural novelty. CNBC's 2026 travel trends spotlight ""decision-free"" wellness—pre-packaged plans that make biohacking as easy as Uber Eats.

The key? Data over dogma. Affordable wearables like Oura rings track HRV and sleep scores, flagging tweaks before you crash. It's not about perfection; it's persistence. Studies show consistent 80/20 adherence—80% dialed-in habits—yields 10-15 years of healthspan extension, rivaling the elites' regimens.

Cold plunges? Check. Infrared saunas for detox? Yup. Their Instagram reels demo ""Vegas Vitality"" sessions: NAD+ IVs for energy surges, peptide stacks for recovery, all starting at accessible tiers (think $300 entry scans, not $30K overhauls).

What sets them apart? Inclusivity in a city of excess. Many people hail it as Vegas's top anti-aging spot for ditching symptoms for optimization—integrative therapies like ozone and hyperbarics that locals and tourists snag without reservations lists. In 2026, as longevity travel surges, LV Lab's leading the charge: Pop-up retreats blending biohacks with burlesque vibes, proving eternal youth pairs perfectly with blackjack. It's not charity; it's smart business—health is the ultimate high-roller chip.

What's your take? Swapped the Submariner for saunas yet? Drop your hacks below—let's outlive the algorithms together. Who knows, maybe we'll all hit 120 looking like we just left the fountain of youth.",1,1767373730.0,u_Legitimate_Sweet2188,0,1.0,False

I live in an HMO and have an AST for room only. \[Edit: He doesn't live with us, so not a lodger\]

The landlord asked the cleaner to move some kitchen utensils to a table, take a picture of the table and stuff, and told us that everything on the table will be binned in 5 days. Also said that only the kettle is allowed on the kitchen counter (no other electronics like coffee machine, rice cooker, etc.). Also took a picture of the clothing rack saying that clothes on it will be binned as well.

Five days later, the cleaner came, binned everything on the table, and moved my rice cooker and coffee machine (which were on the counter, not the table) to the floor beside the staircase. In the process, she also binned a part of the coffee machine accidentally....

The landlord has also moved clothes from the sofa and drying racks to the floor. I dunno if he's binned any.

I understand he can enter the common area when he likes, but (1) it's the cleaner, not him, and (2) Is he allowed to have the cleaner just touch/bin people's belonging?? (3) How can I get him to compensate for the coffee machine?? It's now unusable due to the missing part and it's not sold independently; (4) landlord doesn't allow us to dry clothes in the common area and there's no dryer... can he just bin people's clothes?

1q245ml,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q245ml,I got the MADRINAS coffee collectors box :) here’s my review!,"This is kind of a big deal for me as I am English and live in the UK - as a 90s kid, growing up I could NEVER get Neopets merch but now I am a grownup with disposable income and international shipping at my fingertips lol! This is my very first irl Neopets item so here is my (non-advert, non-endorsed) review :)

Firstly, the box is NICE. It’s bright and the artwork is very cute, bravo to whoever designed this. I will 100% be keeping the packaging when the coffee is long drank.

The plastic shaker cup is also very bright and cute. It’s intended for cold brew coffee but I run a lot (when not 7 months postpartum with my first baby lol) and this will absolutely be used as my regular BCAA shaker bottle once I get back into it.

The coffee itself is… so-so if I’m totally honest. It says it is ice cream flavour and it’s FULL of sugar, I wouldn’t say it’s a coffee drink so much as an incredible sugary/sweet powdered milkshake. Also the caffeine content is insane.

I made it with hot water (as northern England is currently a balmy 1c or just under 34f for any Americans), and even with just half a scoop instead of a full scoop as suggested, the sweetness blew my head off lol. It’s a drink I will probably be having as a treat maybe once or twice a week rather than my regular coffee.

BUT it also didn’t promise itself to be anything different - it is marketed as a very sweet ice cream cold brew and that’s what you get. It’s not bad, it’s just my personal taste would prefer more coffee flavour and less sugar. It says it has 8 servings but with my half a scoop, it will easily last 16+.

So I’d give the actual coffee for me personally a 6/10 - but the packaging for me is 10/10, it’s reaaaaaally cute, and I see myself using the shaker a lot for workouts.

The virtual prize code items are also very cute. I’m not very into customisation but you get a little wearable jubjub with a coffee mug and a wearable meepit in a mug, which I like! You also get a Madrinas Goodie Bag item which contains either the same again or one of a few different items.

I’d say for $34.99, which converts to just under £26, it’s a fair price. I feel like I am happy enough with the purchase to get £26 value out of it. Also shipping to the UK was about $12, so about £9, but I didn’t have to pay any extra tax or custom fees on it - I also added a couple bags of flavoured beans onto my order to make it feel more worth the shipping. Shipping took just under 3 weeks as it arrived yesterday, which imo is reasonable given it was ordered over the busiest time of the year for post with bank holidays etc.

So for £35 total including international shipping, I am happy with it and think it is a decent product.

Why ""Boring"" Reports are actually superior","We all go through this phase. You start getting some traction, and suddenly you feel like sending a PDF isn't ""premium"" enough. You convince yourself that you need a fully white-labeled client portal on your own domain or an expensive third-party subscription to look like a ""real"" agency or consultant.

The honest truth is that you are likely over-engineering a problem that doesn't exist.

I used to obsess over finding the perfect dashboard tool, but I’ve come full circle. As one community member perfectly put it, the best strategy is often to **""keep it boring on purpose""**.

# The ""Friction"" Killer

Here is the nightmare scenario: You send a client a link to your beautiful portal. They click it. They forgot their password. They email you. You reset it. They log in, get confused by the UI, and email you anyway asking for the one metric they actually care about.

Most clients do not have the time or ""brain space"" to navigate another system just to see how their money is being spent. They want clarity and consistency, not a fancy dashboard they have to learn how to use.

# The ""Starbucks Test""

The real litmus test for a report is simple: **Is it easy to open on a phone?**.

If your client is standing in line for coffee and sees your email, they should be able to skim the results in 10 seconds.

* **Google Docs/PDFs:** Click -> Read -> Done.
* **Portals:** Click -> Login -> Wait for load -> Zoom in on non-responsive chart -> Frustration.

Don't let your ego get in the way of utility. Simple PDFs or Google Docs are often the least stressful option for both you and the client.

For those who still use high-end dashboards (like Looker or Databox), do you find your clients actually log in, or do you end up just screenshotting the graphs and emailing them anyway?",1,1767373204.0,ShopifyGrowthZone,0,1.0,False

But during those ten minutes, I noticed something that most others don't - in the way you talk, the way you hold yourself, and the general demeanor that you put forth. It's no surprise that many others don't pick up on it - you're \*very\* good at hiding what's inside. But to a trained eye and ear like my own, you couldn't be more clear about what you crave.

See, you're the type of woman most wouldn't suspect - you're fierce, stubborn, determined, liberal - and you quickly rose to a prominent leadership position at your own company. You're often the one giving orders at work or making the decisions when you're with friends and family, and you're the go-to party planner in your circle - it seems you have a desire for control and organization that simply cannot be matched.

But in those ten minutes, I knew that couldn't be more wrong.

Maybe it's my personality or my charm, possibly my confidence or abrasiveness, but while chatting with you, I didn't see that confident, stubborn, feminist that everybody says you are - I saw a woman who had trouble making eye contact with me, who couldn't help but giggle somewhat nervously, who clearly yearned and craved for something more, something different - far different from her every day life.

When we parted that night, I made a decision about your future - that you're going to be my submissive, obedient, free-use slut.

Later that week, I managed to snag your phone number from my coworker. And when I texted you, it didn't surprise me that you didn't seem to question how I got your number - instead, it seemed like you were expecting it, craving it. You couldn't be obvious about it, though - you had this feminist facade you had to keep, after all. But I knew where we were heading - I made that decision \*long\* ago.

So when I called and asked you to meet up for coffee at a shop near my place to discuss a business opportunity, I knew you would gladly accept. And when I told you to wear something flattering, I got the snarky response I expected - with a tone of playfulness to it, of course.

It's now around six in the evening and I'm sitting in the coffee shop wearing my favorite suit - a navy blue one with a white, button-up, long-sleeve shirt, and a blood-red tie and brown leather shoes to complete the look. The suit is tailored to fit my muscular, 6'1"" frame and broad muscles, just tight enough to show a hint of the muscles underneath. My large hand slides through my short, soft, brown hair as my blue eyes scan the scenery in front of me. I slide my hand to my rugged jaw, feeling the beginnings of a five o'clock shadow starting to form.

I open up the newspaper in front of me and take a look at the business section while I take a sip of my favorite coffee - a Caribbean blend. Served black, of course.

The following trades use Dalton as a means to bring in multiple rotation-level players from flailing teams willing to take a chance on Dalton figuring it out. For these trades, it’s critical the Lakers keep their first rounders as they shouldn’t part with them unless big game hunting. They also shouldn’t commit to taking back long term deals. Finally, I’ve successfully completed each of these deals on Fanspo to ensure they are possible.

1. Lakers give Dalton Knecht, Bucks give Amir Coffee and Cole Anthony

- both Coffee and Anthony are proven rotation pieces who are struggling to find minutes and a role on the disappointing Bucks. Coffee would provide much needed wing length/depth while Anthony provides the offense that Gabe can’t. 

2. Lakers give Knecht and Thiero, Nets give Haywood Highsmith and two 2nd round picks.

- While it hurts to give up so quickly on Thiero, the Lakers would benefit tremendously from Highsmiths high level shooting and defending. Also, Rob has proven one of the best GMs at finding value with second round picks.

3. Lakers give Knecht, Pelicans give Alvarado 

- The pelicans are one of the worst shooting teams in the league and will need to surround their young core with competent spacing. The Lakers could really benefit from some more point of attack defending and it’s hard to find a grittier, full court point of attack defender than Jose. 

4. Lakers give Vanderbilt, Knecht, and a top-10 protected 2026 first round pick, Kings give Keon Ellis, Drew Eubanks, Dario Saric, and Doug McDermott (lakers then waive Doug & Dario)

- The only way they should move a protected first rounder for Keon Ellis is if the Kings take back long term money (Vando). I think we’d all like to see Ellis in LA and he could end up staying awhile with the freed up cap space in this trade.

5. Lakers give Knecht and Kleber, Blazers give Thybulle, Reath, and a 2026 2nd round pick via Memphis (projected to be between 35-43)

- This sort of deal would signal the Lakers are giving up completely on Dalton while also giving themselves a strong wing defender (when healthy) and a better big option than Maxi (who tries hard but is struggling on both ends).

1q23o6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1q23o6b/dealing_with_changes/,Dealing with changes,"FTM. 20 weeks now . Very much wanted pregnancy and we are very grateful ! ☺️ But this new year has made me realise how much life has changed since becoming pregnant. Me and my husband are two very similar people. And ive always been very spontaneous so far in life. Always up for drives, Last minute trips, late night outs, daily grocery runs and movie nights with husband etc etc. we both are like best friends hanging out every opportunity we get. 

This new year was the first time i got so tired at the party and made him drive me back home by 9pm and slept off . We also live in a place with stairs so i am no longer accompanying him for grocery runs and coffee hangouts daily like we used to. He goes alone now. He keeps innocently asking me about our plans for late night movies and drives everyday, forgetting im pregnant & every time i have to remind him i cant it hurts me a little bit. He is very understanding and prioritises my comfort . So no complaints there. But i cant help but feel like my old spontaneous self i dying and it might never come back. Atleast it wont be the same, like ever. And im worried my husband will see me in a different light now as a “Mom” and not his best friend anymore. I wanna prove to myself that im still fun and easy going but my body is slowing down and its hurtful a little. ",1,1767372580.0,pregnant,2,1.0,False

**County Road 7, North Sector**

It was near on eleven when this began.

County Road 7 ran ahead in a bleached strip, two lanes scabbed where the chip-seal had let go and nobody ever hurried to fix it. Pine stands held the line on both sides, fence-post straight, the understory choked out by shade and old needles. Every so often a trailer slumped back in the timber, skirting torn, tarps nailed over windows, a truck up on blocks that had been up there long enough to grow a little legend of its own.

I kept the windows shut and the A/C cranked, even though it never did win outright. The radio chewed on static and half-sentences. The world ahead of me stayed empty except for heat shimmer and the pale ribbon of road. 

Dispatch had put me on the north loop again, the same pilgrim’s route past the old rock bridge, the feed store with its sign twisted on one hook, and that little church you could miss if you blinked, white siding tucked back from the shoulder.

Every so often I’d lift two fingers off the wheel at somebody mowing or walking down to their mailbox. Most folks kept their attention on their work. A marked unit carries a meaning out here. Trouble for them. Trouble for me.

The radio popped and hauled me back.

“Two-four, County.”

I brought the mic up. “Go ahead, County.”

“Two-four, be advised we had a 911 hang-up. Juvenile male. Stated possible domestic at James Saddler’s residence. Refused caller. Caller disconnected before further. You in position to check?”

“County, that’s affirmative. You got an address for me?”

“Stand by.”

Static hushed over the rest. I glanced at the in-car terminal. The screen glowed faint under a film of dust and fingerprint smears. I tapped the power button once to wake it.

“Two-four, address is nine-oh-seven Lawson Spur off County Seven. Copy?”

“Two-four copies; nine-oh-seven Lawson Spur. Show me en route.”

I keyed the address in. The map jumped, cleared its throat, and then settled on a bird’s-eye of our corner of Arkansas. A little house icon pulsed at the end of a thin gray vein.

No close neighbors. No side roads. No gas station, no store, nothing with eyes and faces.

“County, you got any history on this address?” I asked.

“Two-four, stand by. Pulling prior calls.”

The pines streamed past the glass. Above the treetops, a buzzard rode the heat, black on a hard sky, drawing circles over timber and tin. That bird didn’t care what kind of call it was. It just knew where things went to end.

Another voice cut in. Older, rougher around the edges. Deputy William Cole.

“County, Three-one. I’m clear of that civil on Jefferson. You can show me headed toward Lawson if Two-four needs a second.”

“Copy that. Two-four, you got a back en route from the west.”

I keyed up again. “Two-four copies. County, you get anything further on the hang-up?”

“Negative. Recording sounds like a juvenile male. Stated father was physically battering his daughter. Then line went dead. No answer on callback. Phone pings in that area but no exact.”

“Roger that,” I said. “You can start me on a welfare check. I’ll be out with Three-one at Lawson Spur. Advise if you get that caller back.”

“Will do.”

I set the mic back in its cradle, though my fingers didn’t want to let go. A small, mean part of me wished the kid had an aunt down the road, a neighbor who’d hear something and walk over with an excuse. But wishing didn’t help the girl in that house.

Domestic calls in this part of the county have a certain smell to them. Men drink early. Kids learn to read a room before they learn to read a page. Some houses stay ‘fine’ until the day they aren’t. 

The old hands talk about kitchens the way sailors talk about storms. A man can end up dead on linoleum quicker than riding the interstate. A place can feel safe just because it has rules, but not every place does.

My field training sergeant had a line he liked to repeat. “Keep your chin up and your focus wide. Folks turn wild at home.” That voice sat at my shoulder as I drove. I could hear him clear though he’d gone on to a bigger department over the state line two years back. 

The land began to draw in upon itself. Fences went from straight to crooked, cedar posts gray and split. Here and there a strand of barbed wire glimmered, half buried in weeds. Pines crowded the ditch and stole the light so the road went from glare to shade without warning. I eased the cruiser down, scanning for the Lawson Spur sign.

“Two-four, Three-one,” the older deputy’s voice came over. “You on Seven yet?”

I keyed up. “Two minutes out from Lawson. Coming from town. You see the turn on your end?”

“Yeah. Sign’s half turned. You’ll miss it if you don’t know what to look for. I’m staged just past it. Roll by, you’ll spot my unit. Pull in behind me. We’ll take the spur together.”

“Ten-four,” I said.

When I reached the battered sign for Lawson Spur, it hung slanted from its last bolt, lettering faded to a guess. Past it, a patrol unit waited on the shoulder, crouched behind brush.

I went by the spur, then swung in. We ended up nose to tail on a strip of gravel with branches pressed over the roofs. The sky held three buzzards now, each turning their circles. Heat rose off the hoods and met the heat from the ditch. Once the engines settled, the road gave us only grit-grind and cicadas.

Cole stepped out and left his door hanging open. He was older, hair gone to iron at the edges, tan run deep into every line. He moved with the slow economy of a man whose duty belt and night shifts had written their lessons into him.

He took stock of me, then the treeline, then me again. He spit tobacco into the weeds and tipped his chin toward the Lawson sign.

“You ever been up there?” he asked.

“No, sir. First time I heard the name was County putting it on the air.”

He measured me for a count, weighing more than my answer.

“You been on six months now?” he asked.

“Little more. Eight,” I said.

A sound came out of him that served for a laugh. “Eight months in this county,” he said. “You must think you seen some things, huh?”

“I know I ain’t seen near enough,” I told him.

That earned me a fraction of respect. He set one forearm on the open door and kept his attention on whatever waited up that vein of road.

“Place up there belongs to James Saddler,” he said. “Folks call him Jimmy when they feel friendly. I do not feel friendly.”

“County said this was a domestic,” I said.

“They did,” he answered. “Truth is, that house up there is a domestic that never ends. Jimmy came up rough, stayed rough. Makes a living off scrap and odd jobs, keeps money under his mattress, does not trust banks, does not trust us. You tell him the sky is blue, he will call you a liar just on principle.”

Wind ran through the pine tops and worried the thicket along the ditch. He let the woods talk a beat, then went on.

“That mean you been out here before?” I asked.

“More times than I wanted,” he said. “Noise complaints, kids in the road, dogs out, couple fights. Never could make half of it stick. He knows how to put on a show when we pull up. Talks loud, puffs his chest, then smiles when the papers come out. Try to set a hook in him and it slides off.”

His neck gave a crack and he motioned toward the timber.

“From what I remember, he has five girls in there,” he said. “All stair-stepped. Oldest near grown, youngest still a baby last time I saw her. One boy. Only son. Wife too. She used to be sharp. Now she just looks at you tired. Saddler dotes on the boy though.”

“Any priors on him getting physical with them?” I asked.

“Nothing we could lock down on paper,” he said. “You can see the bruises. Girls say they fell, they ran into the table, you know how that song and dance goes. Meanwhile he just stands right there and tells you they’re clumsy. Tells you they ought to thank him for giving them a roof over their heads.”

He shifted his duty belt a notch and gave me a smile that had no joy in it.

“Good news for you, rookie,” he said. “You get to meet the local legend before lunch. Big day for you.”

“Legend, huh?”

“Relax,” he said. “When you see him, you’ll just think he’s some old farm hand with a temper. Man’s in his fifties. Stays lean from work, though. He hates this uniform. Hates the county more. Probably hates the rooster for crowing without his say so.”

“What you want to do?” I asked. “You leading this one?”

“Hell no,” he laughed. “This is your call. But tell you what, we stage down in the dip. Park where he can’t see us and we walk up together. Let’s avoid stepping inside that house unless he forces our hand, you track?”

“I track.”

“Good. Eyes up, hands loose. We check on the girl, we document her safety, we clear out.”

“You think the caller is one of the kids?” I asked.

“County said juvenile male,” he said. “Only boy on this side of the county is his son. If that kid picked up a phone and called, something pressed him hard. Jimmy finds out who made that call and the house turns into a furnace. Keep that in mind once we step into his world.”

He aimed a finger at me.

“And listen,” he said. “Do not play cowboy out here. Do not let him pull you into a porch argument over nothing. He will try to get you hot. He enjoys it. When he talks to you, he talks to every deputy that ever walked up those steps. We do not owe him a show. We owe him a lawful visit, that’s all.”

“Yes, sir,” I said.

“Quit with the sir,” he said. “Makes me feel old. I got grandkids for that.”

He climbed back into his unit. I did the same. Our engines rolled to life in near unison. He pulled out first, slow, turning onto Lawson Spur, pebbled popping behind his rear tires. I eased in behind, leaving a car length between us.

The road opened on the house and didn’t waste time. One bend, one stand of pines, then the timber broke and the clearing showed itself.

The Saddler farmhouse sat in the center of it, boards buckled and warped, porch drawn down at the corners so the whole place sagged toward the earth. The roofline bowed under its own years. Outbuildings crouched at the tree line, sheds and pens and some old trailer half swallowed by weeds. Tin panels shone through vines here and there. Plastic hung from broken windows.

The older deputy eased his unit off the lane into packed dirt at the clearing’s edge. I put my front bumper behind his. Grit hung over the hoods, then settled and dulled the county seal.

On the porch sat the king of this ruin.

Jimmy Saddler showed bare arms roped with work muscle. Faded overalls, no shirt, trucker cap set low on the brim. One boot heel hooked over the other. A crate sat near his elbow with a stack of dirty magazines spread open, covers slick with old spills. A stained mug steamed in the heat, kept in his palm. He held his face toward the clearing, lids pinched down under the visor.

Cole killed his engine. I cut mine.

“Here we go,” he said into the radio. “Two units on scene, Saddler residence.”

County came back through his speaker. “Ten-four. Time is eleven twelve.”

We climbed out near the same beat. Doors shut with two flat thuds. Sun hit my vest and pulled sweat under the panels giving my skin that trapped, salty feeling. I set my campaign cap on my crown, checked the porch, and made myself take in a long drag of air.

Saddler did not offer us a greeting. He did not rise. He sat there and let the quiet do his talking for him.

Cole spoke calm across the hood, like we were swapping a weather report. “Remember what I said. Don’t wrestle a hog in the mud. You both get filthy and the hog enjoys it.”

We started forward. It was the same walk I had done a hundred times in a hundred yards, but this time my legs felt packed with sand. Our hands stayed near our holsters.

We scanned. Windows first. Curtain edges. The doorway shadows. Then the yard in quick cuts: a shovel leaned by the steps, a length of pipe near the side of the porch, a cinder block stack. A dog chain ran back under the house. No dog in sight, but that did not mean much.

When we got close enough to talk without throwing our voices, Cole tipped his chin. 

My turn.

“Morning, Mr. Saddler,” I said. “Sheriff’s office.”

Jimmy gave a grunt. He turned a page with two fingers, took his time, then laid it back on the stack.

“You the sheriff now?” he said. “Can’t be. You look fresh out the damn prom.”

His drawl carried smoke and old fights. It had never been taught manners and never planned to.

I stopped at the foot of the steps. Cole stood off my right, set wide, giving space without giving ground.

“My name is Deputy Quinn,” I said. “This is Deputy Cole. We got a call in reference to your residence. Wanted to check on everybody. Make sure all are alright.”

He did not move much, but his attention shifted, and that was the first real change. “Call from who.”

“Caller didn’t leave a name,” I said. “Mentioned a girl. Said there was some kind of trouble. We’re just checking things out around the area.”

His eyes showed then, sharp at the corners, and he let them travel my vest, my belt, the handcuffs, the radio, back up to my face.

“You hear that?” he called over his shoulder, to nobody I could see. “Baby deputy out here all spun up over a prank call. World gone soft.”

Cole spoke, calm as fence wire. “Morning, Jimmy. You know how this goes. We get a call, we come out. We lay eyes on everybody, then we leave. Quick and easy.”

Saddler’s grin shifted when he looked at him. It tightened into something meaner.

“You again,” he said. “County really run out of bodies that bad. They send an old son of a bitch cocksucker and some schoolboy to my porch. I’m getting real sick of seeing you.”

“And you,” he jabbed a finger at me. “What that man next to you say about me, boy? Man’s a bitch-bred liar.”

“Just told me you owned the place,” I said. “That’s why your name is on the mailbox, isn’t it?”

The line left my mouth before I caught it. Cole’s head turned a hair in my direction. Jimmy stared, and for half a breath I felt the ground shift under me.

Then he barked a laugh, one rough burst. “Goddamn. You got a mouth on you. Shame no years behind it. How old are you, deputy. Twenty. Twenty-one?”

“Old enough to do the job,” I said.

He raised his mug, took a swallow, and winced.

“You doing a job alright,” he said. “Driving up in my yard, tracking shit everywhere, scaring my dogs. You boys ever think maybe folk out here just want to be left alone?”

“We leave people alone plenty,” Cole said. “But today is not one of those days. I’ll be real with you, Jimmy. We need to see your daughter. Then we can get out of your hair.”

From inside came dogs, more than one. Claws skittered on plank, throats rolling behind the walls. The house went from farmhouse to den in a heartbeat.

“You hear yourself,” Jimmy said. “Daughter this, daughter that. Some brat gets bored, grabs a phone, says some bullshit about my family, and now I got two of you in my yard telling me how life runs under my own roof.”

“No one said anything about your family,” I told him. “All I said is we have to check the area. We’re not here to search your house. We’re not here to dig up dirt. We just need to make sure no one is hurt. That’s it.”

He sat back and the porch boards complained under the chair legs. He let his gaze go from me to Cole and back again, slow, like he was picking which nail to pull. 

“You talk to me about hurt,” he said. “You do not know this family, son. You do not know how long we been on this land. You do not know who cut these beams, who ran wire to that barn, who patched that roof when the rain came sideways. My folks did not call you when times went bad. We handled our own. We still do.”

“That’s your choice,” I said. “But somebody called today. That makes it our business until we see your girl is safe.”

My pulse climbed into my ears. I felt it, hated it. He caught the tell. Men catch fear on other men the way hounds catch blood on wind.

“You trembling down there, boy?” he asked. “First real call, is it?”

“Jimmy,” I let air out, long and controlled. “I’m standing in your yard talking to you. That’s all I am doing.”

He held my face another beat, then grunted.

“You boys always the same,” he said. “You come up here, dress it up nice, but under it you think I’m trash, don’t you? You think my wife is weak and my kids are dumb. You go back to your clean houses and tell stories about me and mine. I know you do.”

“We don’t sit around telling stories on folks,” Cole said. “Hell, I don’t want to be here just as much as you don’t want us here. ‘Sides, all we do is write reports. That’s all this has to be if you let it.”

Jimmy set his mug down on the crate. Wood clacked. Then he stood.

The shift from still to moving came quick. He stepped to the porch edge and stopped there, keeping the height on us. Sweat ran out from under the cap brim. Coffee and old cigarettes rode off him.

“Here is how this goes,” he said. “I don’t want you in my house. I don’t want your eyes on my walls or your boots on my floor. You want to see my girl? Then I’ll bring her to the door. You get a look, you take one good long look, take your proof and then you leave. You can take your report right down to hell with you.”

“Works for me,” Cole said. “Long as we see her ourselves.”

Jimmy held my eyes one more moment. Something moved behind it. A hinge deciding which way to swing.

“You stay right there,” he said. “Both of you.”

He pivoted toward the door. The screen sagged on bent hinges. He hauled it open and went inside. The door shut behind him with a whine that ended in the yard.

Cole drifted a step off my right, loose to any passerby, but built for trouble. He kept his attention on that doorway and did not spend a second on the windows. That choice put a heavy, sour weight in my gut. Older deputies spend their attention the way poor men spend cash. They do not waste it.

I found myself thinking of the Saddler girls, stair-stepped the way Cole said, and I hated how simple it was for grown men to turn children into background noise. Inside, boards shifted. A latch dragged. The screen gave a rattle.

The inner door swung back and Jimmy Saddler stepped out alone. Same overalls, same cap, the same stain at the corner of his mouth. No child beside him. No wife behind his shoulder. Sun from the yard laid him out plain. That porch turned into a stage and Jimmy stood center in it, taking his time.

“Jimmy,” Cole said. “Where is your daughter?”

The sentence hit the air and the world broke right after.

Jimmy dipped toward the jamb and vanished half his body behind the screen. Less than a beat passed and he popped back with a pistol. Sun flashed on the steell. He aimed into the lawn and the porch answered with thunder.

The first shot tore past my ear and burned the air.

My vision pinched down to snow and bright fireworks. My body dropped on its own. Knees hit gravel, hands out, then I rolled, clawing for my weapon, ears full of a rushing roar that might have been blood.

Jimmy barked something about us seeing his daughter. Something about her being born from steel just like her daddy. But all those words got swallowed by gunfire. 

Cole's weapon cleared leather and sent rounds into the doorway. Boards burst. Splinters snapped off posts and spun onto the porch.

Mine came out next and I joined him, punching shots into rail and jamb, trying to own the space where Saddler had been.

Jimmy returned fire from cover. Each flash came through the screen in a white blink, and his rounds raked the drive, snapping dirt, ringing metal off our units, turning the clearing into a gallery and us into targets.

It was around that time when Cole went down.

He had been upright one instant, boots firm. The next he lurched and dropped, leg folding under him. His hat spun away and died in the weeds.

I saw the hit before the sound caught up, a blunt punch high in his thigh. A beat of nothing, then the wound opened and started throwing blood in ugly, confident bursts. It slapped rock and torn grass, soaked his pant leg, and turned the dirt under him into slick mud.

“Shit,” he choked. “God. Hell. Son of a bitch.”

Then Saddler’s door slammed. His shots cut off. His voice moved behind the walls, roaring at us, spitting names. The dogs lit up again, claws hammering the floor inside.

Cole grabbed for his leg, fingers slipping on his own blood. He jammed a finger into the hole and pressed down, face pinched with effort, holding his vein between two fingers.

“Move,” he hissed. “We can’t be out here. Drag me. I can’t walk.”

His skin had gone pale under the tan. My mind started to do the math I did not want it to. 

I shoved my weapon back into its holster and hooked my hands over his vest straps. I hauled. He was heavier than he looked. His back scraped grit, vest dragging, gear biting into him. My boots slid in the wet mess his blood had made.

I threw one look up at the house and caught a curtain twitch in one of the front windows. Something flashed in the frame. A round punched through rotten siding and sang over us. Another hit near my knee and spit ash across my face.

Saddler whooped from inside. “Run, you bastards. Drag your boy back to the cage you crawled out of.”

I tucked my chin and pulled harder. The cruisers sat within a short run. Air tore at my throat. Cole’s blood laid down a dark smear behind us, already starting to cake.

We reached the first unit and dropped behind the engine block. His wounded leg struck the bumper and he made an awful sound.

“Easy,” I said. “I got you. I got you.”

“Radio,” he spat. “Call it in. Don’t let me bleed out in this shit hole.”

His hands kept clawing at his belt, working blind for the tourniquet pouch. I snatched the mic and keyed it.

“County, Two-four. Shots fired, officer down at the Saddler residence, Lawson Spur. Repeat, shots fired, officer down. Need medical and all available units. Now.”

“Two-four, County. Confirm your position. Confirm your status.”

“On the ground behind our units,” I said. “Subject fired from inside the house. One deputy hit in the leg. Heavy bleed. Send everything.”

“Ten-four,” she replied. “Units en route. Medical en route. All other agencies keep this channel clear for emergency traffic.”

I dropped the mic and went for his gear. 

“Pocket,” he rasped. “Left. Get it. Quit shaking.”

“I’m fine,” I lied. The pouch fought me, I pulled yanking at nylon.

“No you ain’t,” he said. “Steady, Quinn. Work the job.”

My hands found the webbing bundle. I dragged it free and almost lost it in the dirt. Everything felt too big for my fingers. Blood kept punching out of his thigh past his own hand, dark, fast, a hole torn into muscle. For a blink when the sun hit just right, I caught white.

“Don’t study it,” he snapped. “Just fix it.”

I shoved the tourniquet high, above the wound, under his holster straps where it would bite and hold. Fed the strap through. Pulled it flat. Then I took the windlass and started cranking.

A sound tore out of him that did not belong in a man.

“Keep going,” he forced out, teeth bared. “Don’t stop till it splits me. I don’t care if you rip the damn leg off.”

I kept turning. The cord of his thigh rose under my palms and went tight as rope. The spray that had been leaping out of him backed down to a heavy seep, then a stingy drip. The ground still drank what was already there, but the fountain at least had quit.

“Hold that,” I said.

He set both hands over it and locked down like he meant to crush the whole strap. His face angled up past the hood line, eyes fixed on nothing I could see.

“Quinn,” he said, and the porch-bite was gone from his words. “This turned into a real mess.”

“Just stay with me.”

“You hear them?” he asked.

I stopped and listened.

For a breath there was only the ring in my own ears and Saddler’s ravings from inside the house, that steady roar of a man who wanted the world to know he was still in charge. Under it, faint at first, came the rise of sirens from County Seven, more than one, threading through the hot air, growing.

“Yeah,” I said. “I hear them.”

Cole shut his lids for a beat, still braced across the bar, still doing his part, but his hold on the windlass softened.

“Don’t you dare,” I said. “Stay on it.”

He dragged his hands back into place, face wet, lips pulled from his teeth. I slapped the velcro strap over the bar and pressed it down hard.

“You did alright,” he said. “Don’t let that go to your head.”

His pupils started to open wide. His skin shifted from gray to a pale clay. Sweat stood on his forehead in beads. I had no measure for what I’d won. Maybe the strap bought time. Maybe it only kept him here long enough to hear the sirens.

So I knelt behind that cruiser, hands soaked in his blood, sirens swelling, the house still shouting murder across the yard, and I waited in that narrow strip of cover with a private, sick thought I would not say aloud: do not let him die on my first real bad day. 

Within minutes, what had been a dead stretch of spur road turned into a column of steel. Cruisers slid in from both ends of Lawson Spur. Units lined the ditches, doors flying open.

Men spilled out, some in uniform shirts, some in plain clothes, boots unlaced, belt thrown on over yesterday’s jeans, all dragging vests from trunks and shrugging into them. Rifle racks clicked. Shotguns came out. Extra magazines got jammed into pockets.

I stayed tucked behind my unit with Cole until the first ambulance nosed in. The medics bailed out and ran straight to us, bags slapping their hips. One of them dropped into the blood that had soaked into the grime. “What you got,” he snapped, not even looking at me.

“Gunshot to the leg,” I said. “Bad bleed. Tourniquet’s been on about five minutes.”

He checked the strap with a gloved hand and gave a short nod.

“You did this?” he asked.

“Yeah.”

“It’s a good hold,” he said. “We’ll take it from here.” His eyes had that look I’d seen on wrecks where the body is still warm but the room has already started saying its goodbyes.

I let my back rest against the fender for half a second. Cole’s eyes found mine once through the tangle of hands and tubing. He dug up enough strength to aim a line at me.

“Tell Sheryl I wasn’t being stupid this time,” he muttered. “Tell her he cheated us.”

“You can tell her yourself.”

“Don’t tell my kids I bawled,” he went on.

“You didn’t bawl,” I said.

“Bullshit,” he whispered. “You could hear me in Little Rock.”

He tried for a smile. Then the doors of the rig closed around him and the world lost its deputy.

—----------

“Quit grouping up,” a sergeant barked somewhere down the line. “Spread that line. He’s still shooting at us.”

That yanked me back into my skin. I wiped my palms on my pants and walked toward the knot of command near the woodline.

A white SUV sat behind the line of cruisers. Captain Reynolds stood at the hood with a clipboard and a property map pinned under his forearm. Paper snapped in the light wind. Pen marks cut the place into boxes no different than dividing a field at a fairgrounds.

“I want a perimeter here. No, here,” he said, stabbing the map. “Inner ring in the trees. Outer ring at the road. No freelancing from anyone. You all stay in your square. Block County Road at the intersections.”

Sergeant Webb asked, “Who takes front?”

“Rudd and Horton on the porch-side tree line,” Reynolds said. “Nolan and Glass at the barn corner. We cover each face of that house. No one sets a boot on that porch for right now. He owns it.”

Reynolds looked up and caught me hanging back at the edge.

“You're the one that got here first,” he said.

“Yes, sir.”

“You see anybody besides the suspect,” he asked. “Any kids? Wife?”

“No,” I said. “He promised to bring his daughter to the door. Came back by himself and opened up on us.”

The captain grunted. “Of course he did,” he said. “You still good to work?”

“Yes.”

“Good,” he said. “Inner perimeter for you. You know the front of this place better than the outside agencies.”

He handed me a set of binoculars. The glass was smudged with someone else’s prints, old grime and grease left over from some other call. I wiped it with my sleeve and only made it worse.

“You see movement out front, you call it in,” the captain said. “You don’t open fire unless he gives you no other choice. We got kids in there. I don’t need one of our rounds hitting them.”

I nodded. My hands still shook. He saw it.

“You sure you’re good,” he asked.

“I want to be here,” I said. It was the only truth I had.

“That’s good enough for me. Get to work.”

We spread and tightened the ring. Men moved through trees in short runs, rifles up, vests creaking. Others dropped behind stumps and fence posts, radios chattering with sector numbers and names, everybody trying to sound calm for the next guy over.

I took a position where yard met woods, a bare patch worn down by years of boots and paws. From there I had a clean slice of porch, a cut of front glass, and the east wall.

I brought the binoculars up and worked the fence line and junk piles in pieces. First pass: only weeds and scrap. Old appliances lay on their backs, decay eating through their guts. Fence posts leaned or lay down. A roll of wire sat half uncoiled where it had died.

My brain tried to slide past the clutter. Then something in me snagged on a shape that did not belong.

Near the northeast corner of the yard, half hidden in growth, a rebar stake stood driven into the ground at an angle. A length of cable ran from its base into brush, almost the same color as the vines. I followed the line and found where it tied to a bent sapling held down with a metal clamp.

Further in, something toothed and dark hung low from a branch, right at shin height, waiting.

A cold little anger rose in me, sharp and personal. I cursed and hit my radio.

“Two-four to Command,” I said.

“Go ahead,” Reynolds answered.

“I got eyes on wires and something sharp at the northeast corner of the yard,” I said. “Looks rigged. Might be a snare or some kind of trap.”

Somebody down the line cut in. “Inner five,” a voice said. “I see something too. Wire on a branch. Can’t make it out.”

For a brief spell the yard went still. Just radios and insects. Then a shout rose from the left flank in the trees.

“Watch your feet,” someone cried. “Wire here, watch it.”

I heard boots crunch deadfall. 

Another voice answered. “I got it, I got it, it is wrapped on-fuck.”

Branches snapped. A crow lifted from the pines and screamed.

There came a sharp snap, metal and tension letting go together, followed by a scream that cut straight through the pine noise. One cry in surprise, another in raw pain.

“Man down,” somebody yelled. “Trap, trap in the covert. He’s caught up in something, his leg, damnit, his legs tangled up.”

The channel flooded with voices, stacked on top of each other.

“Who’s hit?”

“What kind of trap is it?”

“Don’t move him, you might trigger another.”

From where I crouched behind the cruiser I could not see through the thicket. All I caught was brush shuddering and the blur of bodies bunched up in a bad knot. The deputy in the snare let out a groan. It came up from deep in his chest and rolled across the clearing before he swallowed it back.

Jimmy laughed from inside the house. “You wanted to come and play, didn’t you?” he shouted. “Land will eat you. Every inch of it. I told you boys to stay off my property.”

“Hold your positions,” the captain yelled. “No one else goes into that timber. I repeat, hold.”

“Then how do you want us to get our man out that damn thing,” a deputy hollered into the radio. “He’s bleeding out in a bush.”

“We get someone in there with bolt cutters and armor,” Reynolds said. “You wait for a team. That’s an order.”

The trapped deputy cursed through his teeth and called the captain something I will not write here. A medic at the edge of the woodline kept talking to him, promising hands were coming and he needed to keep breathing.

Jimmy’s mouth carried again. He started singing a few bars of some war hymn, only the words had rotted. He swapped in curses for grace, damnation for mercy, cracking on every line like his lungs were full of cinder.

“You think that badge will save you,” he roared. “There’s going to be a wall of bodies between you and my front door if you don’t get.”

He fired a round toward the far line, not aimed at any one man, just reminding us he could touch any corner of that ring whenever he felt like it. The shot snapped off a limb somewhere and leaves came down.

It took time, but they dragged that deputy out of the brush, pant leg torn open, boot soaked and heavy. The medics set up under the trees and the edge of the yard turned into a little field hospital. Gauze wrappers and tape backs skittered on the asphalt.

**Spectre Wraith** : Smells really dark, heavy woods, coffee and rum base with hints of vanilla. Gets a bit sweeter in the dry down but not sugary sweet and after couple of hours smells a bit vanilla and strona Almond

Lasts 6+ hours easilv in winters, not at all a blind buv and could be very polarising. But if you can pull it off it's a perfect signature fragrance for winters


**Spectre Ghost** : This one opens fresh and spicy (ginger, bergamot cardamom) then settles into creamy vanilla with powdery woods. The combo of spices, Vanilla and Bergamot is really really great

The performance may vary but I have the old batch and macerated for months so I get easily 8+ hours performance in winters


**Spectre** : Incense, smoky and leathery with hints of saffror sweetness. The leather is not overbearing and is quite balanced with other notes. A safe blind buv for leather based fragrance lovers

The performance in winters is really great. Lasts easily 6+ hours bu you need to be able to pull this off. One of those scents that require a character and physique to suit ya.


The box packaging and the bottles themselves are really beautiful one of the boxes I haven't thrown vet. Initially when I bought them and tried they did have alcohol blast but over months of maceration the notes have improved and no more alcohol in initial spray. 0f al three, iust the 0G is linear while the rest aren't. And please, batches are different, skin chemistry is different and I've macerated them for atleast an year! Do let me know your experience with these!

1q23jol,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q23jol/the_thing_in_the_pit/,The Thing In The Pit,"CW: self harm, suicide

The road that led Harold Reiner home wound through the mountains like an old scar, a pale, jagged thing carved into the flesh of the land. Mist clung to the pines, heavy and slow, as if the forest itself were holding its breath. Each turn of the wheel dragged him closer not just to the town, but to the origin of the darkness that had plagued his mind since he left this horrid place.  
 The years had not been kind to the small town. Rusted fences leaned like drunks along the roadside, roofs sagged under neglect, and the faded signs of long-dead businesses stood like gravestones for commerce. Even the light here seemed tired, thin gray sun filtering through fog, painting the town a murky, cold gray. It smelled of cold iron and damp earth. The metallic tang of childhood injuries and punishments flooded his mind with regret.

 He passed a playground that had lost its laughter. Swings hung limp in the still air, and the slide lay choked with leaves, half-digested by the soil. Children didn’t play here anymore. They watched screens and shadows instead. The few people he saw were bundled shapes on porches or watching from behind half-drawn curtains, ghosts rehearsing life. A police cruiser idled outside the old diner. The cop inside slept with his mouth open, radar gun pointed blankly down the empty road. The hand on the wheel looked waxen. Harold drove past without slowing and wondered, for a moment, if the man was even breathing. At the turn for the house, his knuckles whitened on the steering wheel as he leaned forward to look at the thing. The movement woke the pain in his leg, a souvenir from the wreck that mangled his bones and stole his mother, leaving him alone with his father. The ache crawled back now, familiar as a stray dog that never forgot the way home.

  
 The house waited at the top of the hill, the same crooked silhouette against the clouds. Its roof sagged like a tired brow, its porch leaned forward as if to whisper secrets into the road. Time hadn’t killed it, only hollowed it out. It sat alone above the rest of the buildings. He stepped from the car, gravel crunching in the stillness. The air smelled of mildew and pine sap riding an undertone of rot, as if the woods were quietly composting everything human. He had almost reached the porch when a voice cracked the fog.

“Harold? Harold Reiner, is that you?”

For a moment he didn’t recognize her. Mrs. Whitlow, Sam’s mother, his old English teacher, stood in the driveway leaning on her hood, wrapped in a faded cardigan, her hair a wiry crown of silver. Time had shrunk her, but her voice carried the same lilting tone from the classroom. She smiled the brittle smile small towns wear at funerals.

“I’ll be damned,” she said. “I heard you were off at some big college. A professor now, aren’t ya?”

He muttered something polite. The words felt foreign in his mouth. She asked about his father, his work, the weather down south, all the harmless questions people ask when they’re avoiding the truth. Harold answered automatically, eyes drifting past her to the house. The longer he looked, the more it seemed to lean toward him, as though it recognized.

Mrs. Whitlow followed his gaze and sighed. “He’s not been well, poor man. Sam’s been taking care of him. She’s inside,I was just dropping off lunch.”

At the sound of her name, something fluttered in his chest, nervous, guilty warmth. He hadn’t seen Sam in nearly twenty years. Back then she’d been the only person who spoke to him without cruelty or pity. She had a stutter the kids mocked, and together they shared the quiet company of isolation.

The screen door creaked. Sam stepped onto the porch. She looked older but not diminished. The lines on her face were soft, not yet worn. Plain scrubs, hair tied back, eyes catching the gray light like wet stone. For a moment neither spoke. The years between them felt physical, thick and unspoken.

“Hey, H-Harold,” she said at last, the old stutter clinging to the edges. “Been a long time.”

“Yeah,” he said. “Too long.”

Wind sighed through dead leaves, as if the woods themselves exhaled. Sam looked at him with something like pity and motioned to the door.

“C-come on in. H-he’s been waiting.”

The windows were dark, curtains drawn tight. Behind the door he thought he heard something moving, slow, rhythmic, almost like breathing. Dust and old wood rolled out to meet him. As he followed Sam inside, his cane echoed faintly on the warped boards, tap, drag, tap, drag, the sound of a man welcomed home by something that had never let him go.

The air inside was thicker than fog. It clung to his skin, dense with dust, stale breath, and the faint sweetness of mildew. The house had aged without grace, not collapsing, but sinking into itself like a dying thing that refused to fall.

  
 Yellowed wallpaper curled like peeling skin, revealing older paper beneath, decades stacked like sediment. On the table sat an open note book filled with neatly written columns of numbers  Harold paused. He recognized the handwriting, rigid, mathematical, obsessive. His father’s script. Something, anger, pity, both, rose in his throat like bile.

Sam’s voice, soft behind him. “He’s been like this a while. W-writes all night, mutters those numbers. S-started after he stopped going outside.”

He nodded, eyes tracing patterns. Random, meaningless, yet his mind hunted for patterns. None. They unnerved him because they almost made sense, like a fever dream equation refusing to solve.  
 They moved deeper. Floors groaned in long, complaining breaths. The kitchen smelled of rusted metal and old coffee. Dishes lay on the drying rack, everything filmed black. Every mirror they passed was covered, towels, blankets, newspapers taped into place. Even the oven’s dark glass was shattered.

“He said his reflection watched him,” Sam murmured. “Th-threw out almost everything. I asked my boss and she said it sounded like he couldn't understand what he's seeing is just himself, said it’s just something that comes with age.”

The hallway to the bedroom felt narrower than before. The walls bowed inward, straining to listen. The door was open just enough for a strip of dim light.  
 His father lay half-sunk into the mattress, more bone than man, a scarecrow draped in thinning skin. His mouth moved faintly, whispering an endless arithmetic, numbers dissolving into one another.

“Hey,” Harold said. “It’s me.” The words tasted strange in his mouth.

The whispering stopped. The head turned toward him, slow and fragile. Clouded eyes flickered, not recognition or warmth, but hope, like a signal struggling to transmit.

“Har…old,” he croaked. “You… came… back.”  
 He tried to sit up, and his limbs trembled. “S-s’been… watching.” His gaze unfocused. The murmur of numbers returned and faded into nonsense.

Harold stood, unsure what he felt. Not grief. He’d lost that years ago. Not forgiveness. Only a hollow pity for the fragile ruin in the bed.  
 “He hasn’t slept in days,” whispered.Sam  “Sometimes I think he’s… waiting.”

Harold stepped back out of the room and turned to Sam. “I’ve been driving for a long while. I’m going to lie down.”

Sam nodded. “Y-yeah. I figured.”

Harold’s childhood room was smaller than he remembered or maybe it had always been this small, and he’d just grown to fill it.  
 The walls were still that same pale blue, though the color had faded to something closer to ash. There were no posters, no toys, no trophies, nothing to suggest a child had ever lived here at all. Just a narrow bed with a sun-bleached quilt, a single wooden desk. Dust coated every surface in a fine gray film, muting what little life remained.

 He ran a hand over the desk, the same one where he’d been made to copy equations until his fingers cramped. His father’s voice echoed faintly in his memory         

 “Neat lines, Harold. Order is truth.”  
 Even as an adult, the room felt like a cell built from expectation.

He sat on the edge of the bed, cane propped beside him. The mattress dipped, sighing beneath his weight. He stared at the blank wall where a window used to frame the woods. Now the curtains hung drawn, stitched with dust. There was no comfort here only a silence that felt aware of him.

He told himself to rest, but sleep came in fragments, the restless kind that tricks you into thinking you’re awake.

Sometime past midnight, he awoke to the sound of the house beginning to breathe. The old timbers groaned as they shifted, settling deeper into their foundations. But a faint, rhythmic thump stood out.

He held his breath and listened. The sound thumped on quietly rhythmically harmonized by the slow tick of the kitchen clock below.

Thump Tick Thump Tick the rhythmic beat slowly coerced him into another shallow stretch of sleep.

Morning came pale and reluctant. The sun crawled over the mountains like something wounded, spilling thin light into the kitchen. Harold and Sam spent the early hours sorting papers and boxes old tax records, rotting books, yellowed letters from strangers. They worked for hours in companionable quiet, the kind that hummed between two people who’d run out of things to say but didn’t mind the silence.

At some point, Harold nodded off in the armchair. He hadn’t slept well after driving all day. The sounds of Sam moving through the house boxes sliding, glass clinking, her soft humming threaded through shallow sleep.

When he woke, the light had shifted gold across the floor. Sam looked up from the boxes with a faint smile.

“You talk in your sleep,” she said. “Real professor stuff. Mumbled something about tests and homework.”

“Do I?” He rubbed his eyes, trying to shake the fog. “Guess even unconscious I’m boring.”

“Mmm.” Her tone turned playful. 

 The way she said it fond, curious made him pause. Something about it sounded off, but he smiled anyway.

Dust drifted in tired spirals through the beams of light. Sam broke the quiet again, this time with a teasing laugh.  
 “You know, I always knew you’d end up being some brilliant, richy-rich type. But Professor Reiner wasn’t my guess.”

“Hardly brilliant,” he said. “I teach first-year algebra to half-asleep freshmen.” Harold said quietly. “Truth is, I’m underpaid, live in a shoebox, and grade till midnight. Therapy’s the only thing that’s kept me from—”

 He stopped. The words hovered.

“It’s good, Harold,” she said softly, her stutter creeping back. “G-good that you’re talking to someone.”

Embarrassed, he busied himself digging through another box. “Only works because of the pills,” he muttered.

The silence after was uncomfortable, delicate, like glass resting on a ledge. He still hated his father, even now.

“So what about you?” he asked finally. “Nurse life?”

She shrugged. “Not like TV. No scrubs and flirting doctors. Just old folks, meds, and bedpans.” She hesitated. “Your dad was my first patient after I graduated.”

“Lucky you.”

“Yeah.” Her voice dropped lower. “Real l-lucky.”

By mid-afternoon they had cleared the den and dining room. Beneath the clutter, the house felt less like a home and more like a mausoleum. When Harold boxed the last stack, something slid loose from a broken drawer: a small leather notebook, its corners worn soft.

His father’s hand filled the pages. The first half was harmless bills, repairs, weather notes. Then the words stopped. The rest was nothing but numbers: tight, angry columns scrawled page after page.

Unease prickled Harold’s skin.

He told himself it was just his father’s madness but carried it upstairs anyway. He sat at his old desk, the wood still faintly etched with childhood equations, and opened his laptop to grade. For a while, he tried to focus on formulas and late homework, but his eyes kept drifting back to the notebook.

Eventually, he gave in.  
 He scanned the first page of numbers, trying the simplest ciphers he knew, shifting letters, numeric substitution, even Fibonacci patterns. None of them made sense. Still, he couldn’t shake the feeling there was a pattern, just beneath his reach.

Hours latter he was pulled from his work the smell reached him, the faint, acrid sting of something burning. He frowned, closing the laptop. The scent grew stronger as he limped down the hall, cane tapping a hollow rhythm on the stairs.

In the kitchen, a thin veil of smoke hung over the stove. A pan sat forgotten on the burner, its contents charred into a black crust. He turned the dial off and moved the pan to the sink, wincing as he fanned the air.

“Sam?” he called.

No answer.

He followed the soft creak of a door and found her in his father’s room, standing motionless beside the bed. The old man was still, his chest unmoving, eyes half-lidded and glassy. Sam’s hands trembled slightly where they hung at her sides.

When he stepped into the bedroom, the air was still, unmoving. His father lay half-sunk into the mattress, eyes half-open but seeing nothing. Sam stood beside the bed, hands trembling where they hung at her sides.

“He’s…” she started, voice thin and fragile. “H-he’s gone.”

Harold didn’t answer right away. He only nodded once, slowly, as if confirming something he already knew. There was no shock, just a dull, heavy silence pressing on his chest.

Sam’s lips moved like she wanted to say more, but instead she brushed past him into the hallway. He heard her pull out her phone, her voice small and measured as she spoke to someone on the other end.

When she returned to the kitchen, Harold sat at the table, elbows on the wood, staring at the faded pattern of the tablecloth as though it might change if he looked long enough.

“They’ll be here within the hour,” Sam said quietly. “I’ll help t-them get him ready. I can let the f-funeral home know to start the p-paperwork, and we can plan the service when—”

“Don’t,” Harold cut in, too fast, too sharp.

She blinked, taken aback. “Don’t what?”

“Don’t bother with a service,” he said. “Just… have him cremated.”

Sam frowned. “No f-funeral?”

He shook his head. “Who would even show? The man pushed everyone away years ago.”

Her voice softened. “He was still your father, Harold.”

“Yeah,” he said, staring down at his hands. “And that’s the only reason I’m here.”

The refrigerator hummed. Pipes groaned faintly in the walls. Neither spoke for a while. The silence felt heavier than grief thick enough to breathe in.

Finally, Sam sat across from him. “You don’t have to deal with all this alone. I can stay a while, help clean up, make calls.”

“You’ve already done enough,” he said flatly. “Go home, Sam. Get some sleep.”

“I’ll stay,” she said again, firmer this time. “You shouldn’t be here by yourself.”

He met her eyes and felt his face flush with heat. “I said go home.”

“H-Harold—”

“I said go home!” he snapped, slamming his fist against the table. The sound cracked through the kitchen like a gunshot. The light above them flickered.

Sam froze. For a long moment, neither moved. The tension hung between them, sharp as glass.

Then, quietly. “I’ll see you in the morning.”

He didn’t look up as she left.

The screen door creaked open, then shut with a hollow clap.

He turned off the kitchen light and limped upstairs. The house felt even emptier now, hollow.

Upstairs, Harold opened his laptop to grade, but the notebook tugged his attention like a whisper. He paged to the numbers. At first they were meaningless. But his mind refused to let go. He wrote sequences out, scanned for patterns, translated one number per letter. After an hour, faint outlines appeared. Words. Fragments. It. Me. Watch. Mirror.  
 He rubbed his eyes. Old man’s dementia, he told himself. Just paranoia like Sam said.

Harold stood slowly and moved to his bed.  
  
Sometime after midnight, he woke again to the sound.

Thump. Thump.

He pushed himself upright, breath catching, listening. The sound was close just beyond his door. He reached for his glasses, slid them on, and gripped his cane  as he rose.

The door creaked open as he pulled it toward him.

Sam stood there, head still swaying as if she was thumping against the now open door.

Her hair was loose, tangled. Her night gown half-unbuttoned, bare feet pale against the wood. She stood in the doorway , eyes half-open, her forehead red from the thumping who knows how long she was there before Harold woke up.

“Sam?” he whispered.

No response.

The boards moaned under his weight as he shifted in palace . “Sam,” he said again, louder this time.

Her lips moved faintly, the words slurring under her breath, half dream, half echo.

“H-he’s not talking again,” she mumbled, voice thin. “Need more”

“Hey—Sam.”

He touched her shoulder. She jolted awake, gasping, hands clutching at his sleeve. “Oh God—Harold—I’m sorry,” she stammered, eyes wide with confusion. “I must’ve been… sleepwalking again.”

“It’s okay,” he said, voice low, steadying her by the arms.”

She looked mortified. “I don’t even remember coming up the hill.”

He hesitated, then reached over to the covered mirror at the end of the hall, pulling the old sheet loose. “Here,” he said, draping it around her shoulders. “You’ll catch a cold walking home like that.”

Her eyes softened. “Thanks.”

He nodded, escorting her down the stairs, one careful step at a time. At the front door, he lingered as she stepped out into the fog.

“You sure you’re okay?” he asked.

“I’m fine,” she said. “Just… tired.”

He watched her figure fade into the mist, the sheet trailing lightly behind her like a ghost’s veil. Something in him twisted  a quiet voice, the kind that sounded a lot like guilt, told him not to let her go alone.

Harold grabbed his coat and hurried after her, the cane thudding in quick, uneven rhythm on the porch.

“What kind of man would I be if I let you walk home alone?” he called, trying to make his voice light.

She glanced back through the fog, a small smile tugging at her lips. “A sensible one,” she teased. “It’s only fifty yards.”

“Yeah, well, sensibility’s never been my strong suit.”

They walked side by side down the narrow path, the fog curling around them in slow, sleepy waves. The air smelled of pine and rain. For a brief moment, it felt like the world outside the house was clean again, quiet, almost peaceful.

“You been sleep walking again?” Harold pressed gently 

Sam hesitated and then nodded “It started again about a week ago”

Harold nodded

When they reached her porch, she turned to him. “You didn’t have to do that.”

“I know,” he said. “Guess I just didn’t want the silence.”

She smiled, soft and tired. “Goodnight, Harold.”

“Goodnight, Sam.”

He watched her step inside, the door closing with a soft click. The porch light dimmed behind her. The fog thickened, swallowing the small house whole until it vanished into the gray.



The next morning’s light was thin and cold. Sam sorted kitchen cabinets while lemon cleaner cut through the dust. “I’ve got work to catch up on,” he said, pouring coffee. “Papers to grade.”

She smiled, tired but understanding. “I’ll keep working down here. You do your thing, professor.”

Upstairs, door closed, he set the journal beside the laptop. The cipher sprawled across yellowed paper, neat at first, then collapsing into scrawled chaos. Every page seemed to start a new system  shifting letters, broken keys, symbols that made no sense beside the last.

He told himself it was just a puzzle, a distraction from the house. But as the hours dragged, the voice behind the numbers started to feel familiar, like something trying to crawl through the cracks in the paper.

He’d been working for hours before the first sentence began to emerge. Even then, half the words were wrong  letters inverted, vowels missing, numbers doubled that shouldn’t have been. It was like trying to read a dying mind one word at a time.

“Harold, I am assuming it’s you, my boy, reading this. Because I know you. You won’t ignore the numbers. You’ll see a pattern and have to solve it. That’s what I taught you. No half-work. It’s all or nothing. And thus, you will read this.”

Harold blinked at the page. Some words were smeared, others misspelled, assumig, patern, solv it , but the meaning came through all the same.

The second page took longer. A different code. The handwriting jittered, some digits crossed out, others overwritten as if his father had forgotten his own logic midstream.

“You’ll think I’ve gone mad. An old bag of bones rattling at shadows. But I know I’m not crazy because I thought I was. Something is in the woods, Harold. Something dark. I found a pit, a wound in the earth. Ace found it first—barking, snarling, snapping at his reflection in the creek. He bit me hard enough to draw blood before I could drag him away. I put him down that same day. He was old anyway. I see now what he was trying to do. The thing had touched him. It passed something to him, and through him, to me.”

The name Ace burned a hole through him. He’d assumed the dog passed while he was away. The idea that his father shot him made his stomach turn.

He turned another page. It  was nearly unreadable  numbers repeated at random, letters written backward, entire words scratched out. Still, he pieced it together..

“It began with the voice. My voice. Calling from the dark, from the mirror. At first I thought it was delirium. Then it moved. It smiled when I didn’t. It spoke when I was silent. Not reflection, not repetition. Mimicry. It watches. It learns through mirrors. I covered them, smashed what I could, threw out every polished surface. I’m writing this in code to keep it from reading me. I don’t think it understands ciphers. Or if it does, it doesn’t care. Maybe I’m dead already.”

The handwriting broke down completely after that. Words leaned into one another like drunks. Sentences trailed off into numbers again, as if language had failed him entirely.

“It dwells in that pit. If you have any sense, burn it. Bury it. Drown it. Destroy it. If not for me, then for yourself. The curse passes victim to victim. Forgive me, Harold. I passed it along. The pit is out back, not far from the creek bed. You’ll smell it before you see it.”

Harold sat back, staring at the mess of ink and numbers. His eyes ached. His fingers were black with graphite and dust.

He laughed sharp, brittle. “Christ, you really lost it, didn’t you.”

But the sound rang hollow.  
 The word pit had lodged somewhere behind his ribs like a splinter.



Downstairs, Sam moved through the house  the clink of glass, the scrape of boxes, the faint hum of her voice. Her presence should have grounded him. Instead, it made the silences more deliberate, as if the quiet were holding its breath around her.

Harold stood abruptly, the legs of his chair scraping the floor. 

He grabbed his coat and stepped into the yard.

The cold hit him like a slap. The night smelled of iron and pine. Grass brushed his knees as he pushed down the overgrown path behind the house, cane sinking into soft, sucking earth. 

The further he went, the quieter it became. Even the crickets had fallen silent. The air grew thick and heavy, the trees crowding closer until they seemed to lean in, listening. Then the smell hit him, rot, copper, and something sweet, like spoiled fruit left too long in the sun.

Before him yawned a hollow in the earth, twenty feet across, perfectly round. Darkness pooled inside, thick enough to seem solid. The soil along the rim was soft and black, glistening faintly as though sweating.

Harold stood at its lip, cane pressed into the mud, heart hammering. The stillness was absolute. “Nothing but a hole,” he whispered, forcing a shaky laugh.

Then, from somewhere inside that black:

“Nothing but a hole.”

The voice, faint, echoing  came a heartbeat too late.

He barked out another laugh, brittle and wrong. “The old bastard was scared of an echo?”

He cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted, “Echo!”

A beat. Then faint and flat: “Echo…”

“Jesus,” he muttered, the word trembling. “All this for a hole.”

Still grinning to convince himself, he pulled the journal from his coat pocket and flipped through it. The laughter died when he saw the last few pages.

He had missed them before  three extra sheets stuck together near the back. The handwriting here was nothing like the careful script of the earlier ciphers. The lines slanted uphill, ink bleeding where the pen had pressed too hard. Numbers overlapped letters. Words were crossed out, rewritten, then crossed out again.

He sat down on the cold ground, back against a pine. The bark dug into his shoulders, sticky with sap.

He squinted at the text, mouthing the letters as he went. Even the words that made sense were warped, doubled back on themselves.

“Harld I am your father answr when I cal damn it I’ve called hundrds times. Pick up the phne. Im going to dye out here. That thing is ggoing to kill me.”

Harold froze. The letters leaned and broke mid-word. Some ran together, others were scratched over so violently the paper had torn.

“Harold you ungratefool scum do you know what I lost havin to care for you now you abandn me leave me to this beest no I wont let it get me you made me do this I never wanted to hurt her she was more of a child to me than you ever were.”

A crow shrieked overhead, His eyes dropped to the final page. The handwriting was barely legible now  jagged, almost carved into the paper.

“Sam Im sory Im sory my son was such a peece of shit that this old man has to curs you to your doom dont blam me I saw you as a daughtr a child I didnt have to beet into submishun your father did enugh to teach you your place go to the pit and kill the thing.”

He closed the book and stood. His legs felt weak. The world tilted.

Nonsense, he told himself. These were just the ravings of guilt and dementia.

But still  Sam’s bandaged hand. Her tired, distant eyes.

The wound had been small. Barely anything. But

He didn’t let the thought finish. His body moved before his mind could argue. He turned and limped toward the house, his cane striking a frantic, uneven rhythm through the dead leaves. The journal thumped against his chest like a second heart.

When the house finally broke through the treeline, Sam was stood in the front window, watching.

Perfectly calm. Familiar. Tired. Human. Kind.

Relief loosened inside him. His hands stopped shaking. He told himself he’d been ridiculous  that he’d let grief and exhaustion twist his head..

The house smelled faintly of pine cleaner and something old beneath it. Sam was at the dining table, sorting a stack of papers, her bandaged hand moving with careful precision.

She looked up and smiled. “You okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

“Something like that,” he said, hanging his coat.

They sat in the kitchen. The old refrigerator hummed in its corner, a steady, mechanical heartbeat. The light above the table flickered now and then, buzzing faintly. Sam poured two cups of coffee, her movements measured, careful.

Before he knew it, the words were tumbling out of him the journal, the numbers, his father’s paranoia. He even laughed at himself while saying it.

“He must’ve gone off the deep end,” Harold said, rubbing his temple. “Ranting about reflections and voices. I went out there, to that pit.” He gave a short laugh, hollow as glass. “Just a sinkhole. Guess the old man was terrified of his echo.”

“I’m glad you’re not taking it too seriously,” she said, her tone light, amused.

The laughter that followed was thin but warm, When silence settled again, it didn’t feel comfortable. It felt staged.

“We’ll probably finish tomorrow,” he said at last.

He turned toward the hall. That’s when something in the corner of his eye caught light—a shimmer where there shouldn’t have been one.

The mirror.

It had been covered since the first day he arrived. Now the sheet lay neatly folded on the floor at its base.

He stared into the glass, catching his own tired reflection. Time had been a bastard to him. His face was longer, grayer; his hair, flecked with white; his eyes, hollowed. Then his gaze shifted Sam, in the reflection, was scratching at the bandage on her arm.

“What happened there?” he asked.

She didn’t look up. “Your father bit me during one of his nightmares,” she said softly. “It’s nothing. He was…..”

He glanced back to the mirror. She was still sitting at the table behind him, visible in the reflection. She was just staring at him.

Head tilted slightly. Eyes fixed on him. Face seeming annoyed.

He turned halfway, watching her both directly and through the mirror. Her reflection didn’t quite match her movements.

Harold’s stomach twisted. Something in his head began screaming for his attention.

She was bitten. By his father.  
 And his father had said Ace bit him.  
 And that was where it started.

The pattern fell into place like tumblers in a lock.

Then, faintly from somewhere deep behind his thoughts came another voice.  
 She hadn’t stuttered.  
 Not once.  
 Not for a while now.

“Sam?” he asked softly.

She blinked, and her mouth opened. “Harold,” she said. Sternly 

“I—I’ve got work to do,” Harold whispered.

She flinched, head jerking too far to one side, tendons standing out in her neck. The sound that followed was wet, broken like a record skipping through gravel.

“No,” she said, her voice distorted. “No, you don’t. You haven’t done any work since you got here. I’ve been watching.”

She straightened not smoothly, but in a series of lurches, joints popping as if the body had forgotten how to move. Her eyes rolled briefly white, then focused again, too sharply. When she smiled, the corners of her mouth trembled, as if the skin didn’t want to follow.

His heartbeat filled his skull.

Her smile faltered, widened, split.

“It’s more than just mirrors,” she hissed, raising a pale finger toward his cane.

Harold stumbled backward, his cane clattering against the table. The silver handle caught the light, his own reflection staring back.

“What are you?” he rasped.

Her lips peeled back, the grin stretching too far, teeth bared and blood-slick.

“You’ll see.”

And the reflection moved first.

Like a puppeteer’s hand jerking before the strings caught, the thing twitched  head snapping toward him in a blur, limbs following a beat later. Harold reacted purely on instinct, swinging his cane in a wide, desperate arc. The wood connected with a solid crack, and for a fraction of a second he saw her jaw twist sideways, skin stretching like clay before snapping back into place.

She shrieked not in pain, but in static. The noise tore through the air, an unholy mixture of voices, overlapping and distorted, like a chorus learning how to scream.

He ran.

He didn’t think only moved. Up the stairs, cane striking in ragged rhythm, every muscle in his ruined leg burning. Behind him came the sound of pursuit  bare feet slapping the floor, followed by the drag of hands across the walls, fingers scratching deep gouges into the plaster.

He reached his childhood room and slammed the door. The wood rattled, dust falling from the frame. He threw the latch and yanked open the window, cold air slapping his face.

Below, the yard swayed in fog.

The doorknob twisted behind him. A sound followed a joint popping, something wet sliding under the doorframe.

He didn’t wait.

Clutching the sill, he pulled himself out the window, his bad leg screaming. His cane clattered to the floor behind him as he crawled onto the roof, fingers digging into damp shingles. He could hear it moving below him slow, deliberate, the weight of something wrong in every step.

He didn’t look. He crawled across the roof, tiles shifting under his palms, until he reached the overhang above the porch.

He dropped.

The impact sent pain tearing up his leg, but he stayed upright, catching himself on the porch railing. 

He stumbled into the yard, half-running, half-falling toward the car. His breath came out ragged, clouds of panic in the cold.

The car waited, its surface gleaming with reflections  a thousand watching eyes.

He tore at his shirt, ripping strips of fabric and throwing them over the mirrors, the windshield, anything that shone. His hands shook as he fumbled the keys.

“Come on… come on…”

He twisted the ignition. Nothing. The starter coughed, sputtered.

He slammed the key again. The car coughed once more, caught, and roared to life. He floored the gas. Gravel spat out from under the tires as he shot down the road, 

Trees and fog swallowed the road as Harold tore downhill, engine screaming. His pulse pounded louder than the tires. He didn’t dare look behind him

The lights hit him before the sound blue and red blooming in the mist like veins bursting.

“Jesus Christ,” he gasped, easing off the gas. The car fishtailed before skidding to a stop. He threw it into park, chest heaving.

A patrol car idled behind him. A single figure stepped out, flashlight cutting a sharp white beam through the dark.

“Evenin’, sir,” the officer called. “You all right? You were flyin’ down that hill like the devil was behind you.”

Harold stumbled from the car, waving both hands. “He is! You have to listen—she’s—she’s not—”

“Sir, calm down.” The cop’s tone firmed, trained. “Hands on the hood.”

“No, please, just—just go look! Go to the house! It’s in there—it’s in her!”

The flashlight beam shook slightly. “All right, that’s enough.” Cold metal bit Harold’s wrists as the cuffs clicked shut. “You’re in shock. Sit tight, we’ll—”

The rest was cut off by a sound like a crash of metal and bone.

Something slammed into the officer from behind—hard enough to make the patrol car rock. Both men hit the pavement. Harold twisted, half-falling, half-dragged by the cuffs. The flashlight rolled into the grass, its beam swinging wildly across the trees.

Sam stood in its glow, or what was left of her.

Her clothes were torn, soaked in mud and blood. One arm hung wrong, elbow split open to white. Her skin glistened like it had been peeled and pressed back on crooked.

The officer groaned, reaching for his sidearm, but she was already on him. The sound that followed was wet and a final  sharp crack. When she lifted her hands away, his face was gone.

Harold screamed.

He scrambled for his keys and dove into the back of the patrol car slamming the door 

She turned toward him, panting through a mouth full of someone else’s blood. Her eyes caught the patrol lights and flared red for a heartbeat. Then she smiled slow and crooked and limped toward the car.

He kicked, scrambling backward on his knees. She reached the door handle and yanked; it held. She growled, slammed her palm against the window. It spider-webbed but didn’t break. Again. The third hit punched straight through.

Shards rained inside. One jagged edge caught her wrist, slicing deep. Blood sprayed in a bright arc, spattering Harold’s face and shirt.

He tried to crawl away, the cuffs cutting into his skin.

She caught his ankle.

The strength in that ruined arm was monstrous. She dragged him toward her and sank her teeth into his calf. He screamed the sound of an animal, high, raw. Her teeth tore a mouth-sized chunk from his leg, blood gushing across the pavement.

Then she stopped.

Her mouth dripped red; her voice came in two tones.

“You taste like him,” she whispered. “Bitter. Afraid.”

She leaned closer, trembling, almost reverent.  
Her hands began to shake. “I’m tired of this skin.”

Her fingers dug into her scalp. Before he could even process what he was seeing, she wrenched sideways and snapped her own neck with a sound like wet branches breaking.

The body collapsed.

The night went still.

Harold’s sobs rattled through his teeth, 

Something stirred behind Harold’s eyes.  
 The body shuddered once, then went still. The man was gone or buried deep enough it no longer mattered. What rose from the ground was not Harold Reiner, but something wearing him. This false Harold wasn’t Harold didn't act like him or speak like him it just  mimicked him, the Mimic flexed the body’s hands, testing the fingers, the lungs, the jaw. A slow breath. A crack of the spine.

The body fought at first, twitching like a puppet unsure of its strings. But it was too late. The thing had already learned how to move him. Each step grew smoother, each breath steadier, until it walked with purpose. The Mimic liked this one solid, strong enough to last awhile. The others had burned out too quickly. Maybe it was the pills dulling his will, or maybe Harold had simply been waiting to be taken. Either way, this vessel fit just right.

The car rolled to a stop on the gravel drive. When the door opened, the leg popped and cracked with each step. The Mimic felt it, the bones grinding together, the ruined tendons but the pain belonged to Harold now. The servant only needed motion, and motion was enough.

Out back, the air hung damp and metallic. The pit waited. The Mimic set Sam’s body along the rim and tilted its head, studying her face as though recalling something human. Then, with a soft, almost tender push, it sent her tumbling into the dark. She fell through the mist until a distant thud answered.

“I’ve brought more,” it murmured. “they’ll feed you well.”

  
The officer followed next, rolled into the pit with a hollow thump.  
 Moments later came the sounds, soft at first, then frenzied, the crack of splitting bone, the tearing of flesh, the wet rhythm of something feasting. The air quivered with the weight of it.

From deep within the earth, the Master fed. The sound filled the Mimic with something close to joy. The servant existed for this for the offering, the feeding, the praise that trembled through the dirt when He was pleased.

Somewhere in that silence, a fragment of curiosity rose within the Mimic. It wondered what its Master might look like through Harold’s eyes, for a being with no shape and no form can only be filled by what the mind imagines.

 the Mimic turned toward the house. Inside, the air was stale with lemon cleaner and rot. It sat at the kitchen table and folded its hands neatly, motionless, listening. Somewhere beneath the floorboards, the earth whispered approval.

Harold screamed from somewhere far inside himself, a sound that never reached his throat. His mind tore against invisible walls, but the body did not move.

At last, the Mimic smiled a soft, human expression Harold himself might have worn. It rose, straightened the coat, and stepped out into the pale morning light.

The road stretched before it, gray and endless.  
 He would feed again.

But we had cocacola and cake as dessert.

I am a healthy guy, I run 4 days a week, I'm in good shape and generally I eat super super clean, absolutely clean, no sugar in the coffee neither in my house or in street, I almost never eat dessert, no cookies, nothing... But sometimes I fall, because they tell me to eat some cookie or ""hey take a chip"", but what I want is to be 100% clean, like CR7 that is obsessed.

And I do my very best effort and 75% of the time I do not eat that, but it have been always hard for me. But today the told me to drink cocacola and eat cake and I was in my mind like ""bro I'm doing SR, I'm not that person that eats cake common"". It was a fight with my self that I had, because usually I eat because I little bit of social pressure and because that tastes good but at the end of the day I don't feel great with my self when I do it.

But now it doesn't affect me. They can eat whatever, I stay clean. I am beating a higher temptation than food.

By the way (my personal story):  
I am 2 days retainer (you can laugh on me). I finally discovered SR without intention on 31th of December. YouTube recommend me a video of a guy doing 1 year no-fap and then I said I can do it too. My girlfriend broke up with me on September and I'm focused on my studies and work so its the perfect moment.

I used masturbation to scape hard moments of study and work. These months since September I used to masturbate almost every day, and 50% of days 2 times. Some times I used porn and sometimes not.

But after that video and all the self-development that I have been accumulating throw the years, and discovering that a person I admire on YouTube did SR for 45 days, I came to the conclusion that this is a key moment in my life.

I find a meaning on doing this. It is self control. You own your mind, your body. You reach a new level.

1q23giq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BloomingtonNormal/comments/1q23giq/trying_to_gauge_interest_in_a_local_meetup_group/,Trying to gauge interest in a local meetup group to combat loneliness. Would people be interested in that?,"Hey all,

A few days ago I was listening to NPR discuss loneliness and the growing loss of “third spaces” (places outside of home and work where people naturally connect). The conversation really stuck with me, especially how this decline makes it harder to build meaningful community.

It led me to reflect on my own life and how unhappy I’ve felt since college ended, largely due to the lack of deep, meaningful relationships. I’ve explored options like Meetup and Bumble BFF, but I haven’t found anything that truly feels like it fosters a strong, lasting sense of community.

That’s what sparked this idea: creating a Bloomington-Normal based community focused on reducing loneliness by bringing like-minded people together on a weekly or biweekly basis. The goal would be simple: low-cost activities that encourage genuine connection...anything from grabbing coffee to have a boardgame session to visiting a dog park to volunteering together.

I’d want this to be open to anyone 18+, grounded in inclusiveness, and centered on building real, meaningful relationships. Everyone deserves to feel seen, valued, and connected, and I believe something like this could support positive mental health while strengthening our local community.

Would anyone be interested in participating in something like this? Are there existing groups or organizations already doing this that I might not be aware of?

Any feedback, insight, or ideas are very welcome.",30,1767372105.0,BloomingtonNormal,14,0.88,False
1q23gf3,https://i.redd.it/esdp798nsyag1.jpeg,My Father - Le Bijou 1922 Review,"Behold! The My Father Le Bijou 1922 Box-Press Torpedo (6.1” x 52)

First third: From the initial light, notes of dark chocolate and berry catch my attention. The smoke is thick and full. Although the wrapper is Habano Oscuro, Nicaraguan tobacco flavor is prominent. Boy, is this thing smooth (almost so smooth it’s unbelievable) and the lack of pepper probably contributes to the relaxing sensation. I feel no burn in the retrohale. Smoke is cool into the second third and leaves a beautiful aftertaste of sweet dark chocolate and nut oil with very little spice. 

Second third: Flavors meld and intensify with a slightly earthy taste lingering on the tongue between puffs. At this point, the berry flavor takes a back seat to what I would describe as baking spices (reminds me of a Christmas cookie for some reason) with almost no pepper sensation at all. Chocolate flavor is still present yet flavor is darker. Torpedo vitola channels the flavors more at this point into a focused blast with warmer flavor. As I chew the smoke, I can sense the complexity in this cigar. There is a LOT going on. My tongue feels textured as if I have had strong black tea - a comforting feeling. 

Final Third: There’s the pepper 🌶️ Just enough to notice but still so dang smooth it almost has no effect. Earthy flavors take center stage and become more vibrant as time progresses. I taste hints of black coffee and wood. Nicotine feeling intensifies. 

Overall I would rate this cigar a 95/100 for its complexity, smoothness, and flavor. I preferred the first half or so more than the second half (just an observation). This cigar starts off with a bang, and, in my opinion, the beginning third was the highlight of the experience. If this had more spice I would probably rate it even higher as my preference is a lot of pepper.

Verdict: Phenomenal cigar with a spectrum of flavors that all work very well together. I would recommend this to any cigar smoker as a fantastic cigar but would warn that there is very little pepper. 






I feel as if I could identify this as a My Father in a blind tasting - it resembles other My Father blends I’ve tried, yet, this one is darker and fuller. Somehow, it seems, it tastes uniquely like a My Father and nothing like any other brand I’ve tried. With that being said, it is completely distinguishable from My Father’s other lends I’ve tried.

I showed the desk officer the live video.

He didn’t interrupt me. He just watched the screen, jaw clenched, hands folded on the counter like he was bracing himself.

When it ended, he asked if this was live or a recording.

I handed him my phone and told him it was live and explained the situation as quickly as I could. They dispatched units immediately to my house.

They took me into a small interview room after that. No windows. Just a table, two chairs, and a faint humming sound I couldn’t place. A detective came in not long after, older, calm, the kind of guy who speaks slowly like he’s careful not to spook you.

I told him everything.

Not just what happened that night, but everything that led up to it. Every card. Every birthday. How long it had been going on. How I never told anyone because it always felt… harmless. Strange, sure. But harmless.

He asked why I hadn’t reported it sooner.

I told him my mother did once but nothing came of it. Other than that I didn’t have a good answer.

At some point it stopped feeling like something that happened to me and started feeling like something that had always just been there. Like background noise.

I remember sitting alone in that room, trying not to imagine someone walking through my front door.

When the detective came back, he closed the door behind him before he spoke.

“They didn’t find anything.” He said. “If it weren’t for that video it would be impossible to tell if anyone was there.”

No signs of forced entry. No disturbed ground outside. No footprints around the house, even near the door where the man had been standing. The officers checked the yard, the side of the house, the area near the fence line.

Nothing.

Inside, it was the same.

No fingerprints that didn’t belong there. No signs anyone had been inside recently. No evidence of tampering with the locks. 

One of the officers mentioned how clean it all was.

That word stuck with me.

Clean.

The detective told me that without anything physical to go on, there wasn’t much they could do right now. He said they’d file a report, keep it on record, and to call immediately if anything else happened.

I asked him if he thought I was in danger.

He paused longer than I liked before answering.

He said it was good I wasn’t going back to the house.

When I left the station, it was already getting light out.

I sat in my car for a minute before starting it, just breathing, letting the adrenaline burn itself out. That was when it really hit me that if I hadn’t checked my phone when I did… if I hadn’t seen the notification…

I called my girlfriend as soon as I pulled onto the road.

I told her everything. The video. The police. I didn’t try to downplay it this time. I told her exactly how scared I was.

She started crying before I finished.

I told her to stay where she was. She’d already gone to her parents’ place after I called her the night it happened. I told her not to come back to our place, not yet. I promised I’d explain everything again later, in person, somewhere safe.

Then I told her I was going to my mom’s house.

She asked me if I wanted her to come with me.

I told her no.

I didn’t want anyone else walking into whatever this was.

After I hung up, I tried calling my mom.

No answer.

I told myself she was asleep. It was early. Too early. I called again.

Still nothing.

I sent a text asking if she was home.

No response.

I don’t know how long I drove like that, one hand on the wheel, the other gripping my phone like it might start ringing if I held it hard enough. Every red light felt too long. Every car behind me felt too close.

Somewhere between the station and my mom’s house, it occurred to me that I hadn’t told the detectives everything.

Not because I was hiding anything.

But because there were things I’d never thought to question until people started asking.

I pulled into my mom’s driveway just as the sun was coming up.

Her car was there. Lights off. Curtains drawn.

I don’t remember knocking. I just remember standing on the porch, listening, suddenly aware of how quiet everything was. No TV. No footsteps. No movement inside.

I knocked again, harder this time.

After a few seconds, the door opened just enough for her to look out at me, eyes squinting like she was trying to place me somewhere she hadn’t expected.

She said my name before I could say hers.

The relief hit me all at once.

She asked what I was doing there so early. I told her I needed to come in. I told her something happened.

She stepped aside without asking questions.

She noticed my hands shaking before I did.

We sat at the kitchen table. She poured coffee I didn’t think I would touch. I told her about the man at the door. About the deliveries. About the key.

I expected surprise.

What I got was something else.

She didn’t interrupt me. She didn’t question me. She didn’t ask for details. She just listened, eyes fixed on the table, hands folded tightly in front of her.

When I finished, she let out a long breath, like she’d been holding it in for years.

She tried to remember when the first card arrived but couldn’t so she asked me.

I told her.

She nodded slowly.

She asked me if I’d ever thought about who it could be.

I told her what people were saying. About family. About my dad.

Her head snapped up at that.

She said his name quietly, like she didn’t want it to linger.

Then she said, “You know your father died before that, right?”

I told her I knew.

But the truth was, I’d never really thought about the timing.

He died when I was young. An accident. That’s all I ever remembered it being called. Something sudden. Something tragic. Something that happened and then stopped being talked about.

She confirmed it again, gently, like she was afraid I might argue.

He wasn’t around for my birthdays after that. He wasn’t sending cards. He wasn’t watching me grow up.

Whatever this was, it wasn’t him.

She reached across the table and took my hand. Her grip was tighter than usual.

She told me she didn’t think I should go back to the house yet.

I told her the detective had said the same thing.

That made her pause.

She asked what the police had said.

I told her everything they’d found.

Or rather, everything they hadn’t.

She went quiet again after that. Not panicked. Not emotional. Just… guarded.

I asked her if there was anything she wasn’t telling me.

She looked at me for a long time before answering.

She said no.

But she also said she didn’t think this was random.

I stayed at her place for a while. Long enough for the caffeine to kick in. Long enough for the adrenaline to wear off.

Eventually, reality crept back in.

I needed clothes. My work laptop. My charger. Things I hadn’t thought to grab when I left the house in the middle of the night.

My mom offered to come with me.

I told her I’d be fine.

I don’t know why I said that.

On the drive back, I kept thinking about the way the officers described the house.

Clean.

I parked down the block instead of in the driveway.

The house looked exactly the same as I’d left it. No lights on. No movement. No sign anyone had been there at all.

For a moment, I wondered if I’d imagined the whole thing.

I walked up the path, eyes scanning the yard, the porch, the door.

The welcome mat was slightly crooked.

I know that doesn’t sound like much.

But I always kept it straight.

I knelt down to fix it.

That’s when I saw what was underneath.

I stood there for a second, hand still on the edge of the welcome mat.

The house was quiet. No cars passing. No neighbors outside.

I crouched down and straightened the mat.

It resisted slightly.

That’s when I lifted it.

There was a folded piece of paper underneath, pressed flat against the concrete. It wasn’t damp. It wasn’t curled at the edges. It hadn’t been there long enough to collect dirt or moisture.

It had been placed.

My first thought was that the police had missed it, but that didn’t make sense. They’d stood on this porch. One of them had leaned against the door while the other checked the frame. If it had been there earlier, someone would’ve seen it.

Which meant it had been put there after.

I unfolded it just enough to see my name.

My phone rang.

The sound startled me so badly I nearly dropped both the note and the phone. I didn’t check the screen. I assumed it was my mom, or my girlfriend calling to ask if I’d made it inside okay.

I answered immediately.

“Hello?”

There was nothing on the other end.

No static. No background noise. Just an open line.

For a second, I thought the call had dropped.

I pulled the phone away from my ear and looked at the screen. The call was still connected but it was an unknown number.

I raised it back to my ear.

Still nothing.

Then he spoke.

“I see you found it.”

The voice was calm. Older. Male. Not rushed. Not excited. Like he’d waited until he knew I was listening.

I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t. My mouth felt dry, like it had been stuffed with cotton.

There was a pause after that, long enough to feel deliberate.

“You shouldn’t have involved anyone else” he said.

Not angry. Not threatening. Just… corrective. The way someone talks when you’ve made a mistake they expected you to know better than to make.

“That complicates things.”

My heart was pounding hard enough that I could feel it in my throat. I asked him who he was, but the words came out weak, like I wasn’t sure I was allowed to ask.

He didn’t answer.

Instead, he said, “You won’t do that again.”

It wasn’t framed as a warning. He didn’t raise his voice. He didn’t tell me what would happen if I did.

He said it the way someone states a fact they consider settled.

There was another pause.

I waited for him to say more. For an explanation. For anything that would make this make sense.

He didn’t.

The call ended.

No click. No dial tone. Just gone.

I stood there on the porch with my phone still pressed to my ear, staring at the note in my other hand, suddenly aware of how exposed I was. How long I’d been standing there. How easy it would’ve been for someone to watch me without being seen.

I didn’t read the rest of the note.

I didn’t go inside.

I got back in my car and drove.


That was days ago.

Since then, I haven’t gone back to the house. I’ve been bouncing between hotels, sleeping with the lights on, keeping my phone on silent unless I’m expecting a call. I’ve turned off anything that tracks my location. I haven’t told anyone where I am unless I absolutely had to.

I keep replaying the call in my head.

Not what he said.

But how certain he sounded.

I went to the police because I thought that’s what you’re supposed to do when someone crosses a line.

Now I’m not sure there ever was one.

That’s why I’m writing this now.

Because whatever this is didn’t end that night.

And I don’t think it’s ever been as far in the past as I convinced myself it was.

May knowledge naman po ako sa pagbake ng cakes—hobby ko din kasi mag-bake, at gusto ko din i-explore yung business side nito. May funds din naman ako para maka-hire ng someone na marunong mag-bake, kasi gusto ko talagang ma-maintain yung quality ng products.

Background din, graduate po ako ng accounting at currently meron na akong business. Yung current coffee shop ko, nag-o-offer din kami ng cakes sa shop, pero yung plan ko sana is i-separate yung bakery shop para mas focused sa baked goods. Gusto ko yung bakery maging professional looking, with different variety of cakes, pastries, at baka bread din, kasi medyo maraming tao rin dito sa province na naghahanap ng fresh and quality bakery items.

Alam ko medyo competitive ang food industry nowadays, lalo na sa urban areas, pero sa province, I feel like meron pa ring opportunity for a bakery na may good quality products at consistent service. Gusto ko rin po na i-market ito properly, social media presence, maybe local deliveries, at events like birthdays, weddings, etc.

So curious lang po, sa experience nyo or sa tingin nyo, okay paba talaga yung timing na mag-start ng bakery business ngayon? Any tips or advice rin po kung paano mapapa-standout yung shop, lalo na sa province setting. Super appreciate ko po ang inyong honest opinions and suggestions.

Most people hear about new AI models and think, “Cool demo, but will it actually work for me?”

That’s exactly what I wanted to find out with **GLM 4.7** — the newest free, open-source AI that claims to beat Claude in some coding tests and build websites in one click.

So I tested it live.  
And the results were wild.

# What Is GLM 4.7?

GLM 4.7 stands for *General Language Model*, a new open-source system designed for real-world tasks — not just chat.

It’s built for work.  
Not demos.  
Not hype.

It can build dashboards, generate games, automate lead magnets, and even write full-stack web apps.

It’s completely free to use, with a 200K token context window, and you can even run it locally on your computer using **Alarma**.

No subscriptions.  
No rate limits.  
Just raw performance.

# Why GLM 4.7 Is Different

GLM 4.7 doesn’t just “guess” answers.  
It thinks before it acts.

It uses something called **interleaved thinking** — it reasons step by step before writing any code.

That means cleaner code, fewer bugs, and faster results.

You can also toggle “thinking” on or off per message.  
For fast answers, turn it off.  
For deep reasoning or multi-step builds, turn it on.

And it works inside your favorite tools — VS Code, Jupyter, or directly in its own chat interface at **chat.z.ai**.

# Building Your First App with GLM 4.7

Here’s where things get fun.

Inside GLM 4.7, I typed:

“Create a simple expense tracker with running total, pie chart, and date filter.”

Thirty seconds later, I had a **fully coded web app**.  
HTML, CSS, JavaScript — all clean, all working.

No errors.  
No debugging.  
No paid API.

I opened it in a new tab.  
It worked first time.

Then I asked GLM 4.7 to build a **cyberpunk-style animated dashboard** with glowing pink neon UI.

It built that too.

So I tried something harder — an **AI automation quiz** that collects emails and upsells the AI Profit Boardroom automatically.

Again, it worked perfectly.

That’s when it clicked:  
GLM 4.7 isn’t just a chat model — it’s a full automation engine.

# The GLM Leverage Stack (Free Framework)

To help people master this faster, I built a framework called **The GLM Leverage Stack**.

It’s a 30-day plan that shows you exactly how to go from beginner to expert — using GLM 4.7 to build tools, automations, and products that actually make money.

You’ll find all the notes, daily prompts, and templates inside my free community.

If you want the templates and AI workflows, check out **Julian Goldie’s FREE AI Success Lab Community here:**  
[https://aisuccesslabjuliangoldie.com/](https://aisuccesslabjuliangoldie.com/)

Inside, you’ll see exactly how creators are using GLM 4.7 to automate education, content creation, and client training.

# Real Projects Built with GLM 4.7

When I browsed the **chat/space** section inside GLM, I saw people building:

* Portfolio websites in 10 minutes
* Business dashboards with live data
* AI slide decks for client pitches
* Full automation tools with APIs

And the wild part?  
Most of these were made by beginners.

They just wrote prompts like “create a productivity tracker with login system and analytics” — and GLM 4.7 did the rest.

# Open Source Doesn’t Mean Low Quality

A lot of people still believe open-source AIs are “worse” than private ones.

That might’ve been true in 2020.  
Not anymore.

GLM 4.7 scored **84.9% on Live CodeBench**, outperforming many closed models.

It writes structured code, handles UI design beautifully, and even generates working APIs.

Plus, because it’s open source, you can run it locally — meaning no data leaks, no API costs, and total control.

# Where To Access GLM 4.7

You can use GLM 4.7 in a few ways:

* [**chat.z.ai**](http://chat.z.ai) (for instant testing)
* **Hugging Face** (to try the inference model)
* **Alarma** (to run locally for free)
* **OpenRouter** (for API access at low cost)

I recommend starting with [**chat.z.ai**](http://chat.z.ai) — it’s the fastest way to get results.

Just open it, type your prompt, and watch it build live.

# Automate Everything

Once you understand how GLM 4.7 thinks, it’s not just about building one app — it’s about building systems.

For example:  
You can chain together prompts that build lead magnets, generate slides, and write outreach emails.

One prompt builds the funnel.  
Another automates the follow-ups.  
Another connects to your data.

That’s how I built full workflows inside GLM 4.7 in minutes.

And the best part?  
It’s all reusable.

# Inside the AI Profit Boardroom

If you want to go deeper, that’s where my **AI Profit Boardroom** community comes in.

It’s where 1,000+ creators, founders, and freelancers share their workflows, test prompts, and collaborate.

You’ll find coaching, Q&A calls, and daily accountability — so you actually implement what you learn.

# Why GLM 4.7 Is a Game-Changer for Builders

GLM 4.7 doesn’t just save time — it removes friction.

It lets creators turn ideas into live products in minutes.

It’s for people who want to *ship*, not just *chat*.

When you realize you can create an app, dashboard, or automation workflow in the same time it takes to drink coffee — everything changes.

That’s why I believe GLM 4.7 is the biggest open-source leap we’ve seen in years.

And it’s only the beginning.

I’m 5'10"", wear glasses, into swimming, volleyball, watches F1 and sometimes I sketch (happy to share if you're curious!). I’d like to think I’m decent looking and well definitely not camera shy. 😄

Honestly, I’m open to where this goes. A good chat, some banter, late-night convos, weekend chill sessions, maybe cuddles or more if we vibe well. No pressure. No expectations. Just someone to share energy and space with, even if it’s just virtually at first.

If we click, we can move the chat to a more private platform voice calls, deeper convos, maybe meet for a coffee or a movie binge.

Just be open minded, real, and not into ghosting. Life’s weird enough already.

And please text if you’re genuinely interested in this and in favour of putting some time and energy into getting to know each other else this is just gonna be a waste of time for both of us.

With sadness there is something to rub against,  
a wound to tend with lotion and cloth.  
When the world falls in around you, you have pieces to pick up,  
something to hold in your hands, like ticket stubs or change.

But happiness floats.  
It doesn’t need you to hold it down.  
It doesn’t need anything.  
Happiness lands on the roof of the next house, singing,  
and disappears when it wants to.  
You are happy either way.  
Even the fact that you once lived in a peaceful tree house  
and now live over a quarry of noise and dust  
cannot make you unhappy.  
Everything has a life of its own,  
it too could wake up filled with possibilities  
of coffee cake and ripe peaches,  
and love even the floor which needs to be swept,  
the soiled linens and scratched records . . .

Since there is no place large enough  
to contain so much happiness,  
you shrug, you raise your hands, and it flows out of you  
into everything you touch. You are not responsible.

for the moon, but continues to hold it, and share it,

Where Daniel Kramer’s original photograph shows a sharp, electric Dylan fresh off the Newport folk-to-rock switch-up, Rumpelton’s version gives us a Bob who looks like he’s personally stopped at every greasy diner from Duluth to New Orleans.The hair is bigger, wilder, as if pumped full of truck-stop coffee and late-night existential dread. The silk shirt has taken on the sheen of one too many fluorescent-lit booths, its pattern softened into comforting blobs of color. The face carries the satisfied bloat of a man who’s demolished plates of hash browns, chili omelets, and bottomless pie slices along the mythic blacktop. Even Albert Grossman behind him seems less “protective manager” and more “guy waiting impatiently for Dylan to finish his third cup of decaf so they can hit the road.”The Triumph Motorcycle T-shirt still declares its allegiance to cool, but now it feels like the last remnant of rebellion clinging to a body that’s fully surrendered to the comforts of Highway 61’s all-night eateries. Rumpelton’s deliberate crudeness turns photographic precision into roadside folklore: this isn’t the Dylan who plugged in and shocked the world—this is the Dylan who pulled off at every flickering neon sign promising “Home Cooking” and never quite left.Another masterful side-by-side that proves MS Paint can capture not just form, but the soul of a thousand greasy breakfasts.",5,1767371458.0,MSPaintAnyAlbumCovers,0,1.0,False

2. At the party in Episode 6, even if you don’t reveal your identity after the bar fight, Visi says this line right in front of Malevola. Now the timing isn’t a huge deal because Chase goes on his tirade either way, but again, if you chose not to tell the team, Mavevola goes “Robert’s Mecha Man?” when she was literally right there while Visi and Robert are talking about the Astro Pulse. Also, how does no one at the party question why it’s an all-hands meeting to discuss the Pulse and its energy signature? 

None of this is a huge deal, imo, it’s just something I noticed after enough replays/rewatches. ",4,1767371450.0,DispatchAdHoc,4,0.83,False

1q22xbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivatePackets/comments/1q22xbz/the_practical_guide_to_scraping_google_maps_for/,The practical guide to scraping Google Maps for lead,"If you have ever tried to get data out of Google Maps for market research or lead generation, you probably hit a wall pretty quickly. The official Google Places API is expensive and limits you to 60 results per search. Manual copying is obviously a waste of time. This is where the **Google Maps Scraper by Compass** on the Apify platform fills the gap.

It is a tool designed to extract massive amounts of data from Google Maps locations—bypassing the usual restrictions and providing details that even the official API often leaves out, like popular times histograms and direct email addresses found on linked websites.

### What this tool actually does

At its core, this actor (Apify's term for a serverless cloud program) automates the process of searching Google Maps. You give it a search term like ""coffee shop"" and a location like ""London"", and it behaves like a human user. It opens the maps, scrolls through the results, and copies the data.

The difference is speed and scale. It can process thousands of locations in a short time, handling the scrolling and pagination automatically. It doesn't just grab the name and address; it extracts a deep dataset for every pin on the map.

### The data you get

The output is structured and comprehensive. While a standard copy-paste job might get you a phone number, this scraper pulls in over 20 different data points.

Here is what it typically extracts:
*   **Basic info:** Title, subtitle, category, place ID, and direct URL.
*   **Location details:** Full address, plus code, and exact GPS coordinates.
*   **Contact info:** Phone numbers and websites.
*   **Enriched data:** If configured, it visits the business website to find **emails, social media profiles (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok), and LinkedIn details** for key personnel.
*   **Metrics:** Review counts, average ratings (totalScore), and price brackets.
*   **Operational info:** Opening hours, temporarily/permanently closed status, and popular times histograms (live occupancy).
*   **Content:** Review text, owner responses, and image links.

### Why the ""enrichment"" matters

Most map scrapers stop at the data visible on the Google Maps card. The problem is that Google Maps rarely lists an email address directly. If you are building a lead list for outreach, a phone number often isn't enough.

This scraper has a specific **leads enrichment** feature. When it finds a website button on the Maps listing, it follows that link to the business's actual homepage and scans it for contact details. This means your final dataset includes the email addresses and social links that aren't actually on Google Maps itself. It bridges the gap between location data and contact data in one run.

### Overcoming the hard limits

The biggest technical reason to use this specific scraper over the official Google API is the volume of results.

When you search on Google Maps manually or via their standard API, they cap the results. You might search for ""restaurants in New York,"" but you will only see a fraction of them. This scraper uses a method tailored to get around that by using specific search methodologies and scrolling techniques. It allows you to scrape **thousands of places** rather than being stuck with the first 60 or 120 results.

For very large areas, it supports **multi-polygon searches**. You can draw a custom shape (like a specific neighborhood or city boundary) in GeoJSON format, and the scraper will confine its search strictly to that area.

### Practical use cases

People generally use this for two things: **lead generation** and **market analysis**.

For lead gen, the value is obvious. You get a list of every plumber, lawyer, or cafe in a specific radius, complete with their website and potential email address. It removes the manual legwork of building prospect lists.

For market analysis, the review data is key. Because it scrapes review counts and ratings, you can map out competitor saturation. You can identify which areas have businesses with low ratings (opportunity) or where a specific service is missing entirely. The **popular times** data is also unique—it allows analysts to see foot traffic patterns without needing expensive third-party footfall data.

### Cost and efficiency

The tool runs on the Apify platform, which uses a consumption-based pricing model. You pay for the compute units (RAM and CPU) used during the scrape. Because this scraper is highly optimized, it is generally cost-effective compared to buying data lists or paying the high per-request fees of the Google Places API.

You can also export the data in almost any format you need—**JSON, CSV, Excel, or HTML**. If you are a developer, you can hook it up directly to your own database via API, but for most users, downloading a CSV and opening it in Excel is the standard workflow.

### A note on ethics

While scraping public data is generally legal, it is important to be mindful of personal data regulations (like GDPR) and Google's terms of service. This tool extracts data that is publicly visible to any user on the web. However, if you are scraping reviewing data that contains personal names or enriching data to find specific employees, you need to ensure you have a legitimate reason for processing that data, especially in Europe.

This scraper is a utility. It turns the messy, visual information of Google Maps into a structured spreadsheet, saving you hours of mindless clicking and copying.",1,1767370932.0,PrivatePackets,0,1.0,False
