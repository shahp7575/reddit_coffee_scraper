Abstract:

The vast oceans covering the Earth's surface hold immense potential for humanity's future survival and development. Given the increasing saturation and numerous challenges faced by terrestrial resources, this paper proposes an innovative future human dwelling model: the undersea city residence based on mobile modules.

This concept leverages unlimited energy, Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), and advanced matter transformation technology to construct a self-sufficient, infinitely scalable, and highly customizable deep-sea human living system.

This paper elaborates on the design philosophy and implementation pathways for mobile modules in terms of life support, energy circulation, environmental management, intelligent services, and multi-functional modular splicing. Through specific module examples, it demonstrates the ultimate comfort and convenience of future deep-sea living.

This model not only provides vast new habitats for global population growth but also, under the principles of peace and symbiosis, promotes sustainable resource utilization, mitigates surface risks, and is expected to unleash humanity's infinite potential for thought, ushering in a new deep-sea era that transcends terrestrial civilization.

Introduction:

Earth, often referred to as the ""Water Planet,"" has approximately 71% of its surface covered by vast oceans, while land area accounts for only about 29%. For a long time, the development of human civilization has primarily concentrated on limited land spaces, leading to increasingly strained resources, scarcity of developable areas, and even numerous disputes and conflicts.

Currently, the global population continues to grow, intensifying the urgent demand for living space, resource supply, and existential security, which further highlights the limitations of traditional terrestrial civilization. In the foreseeable future, human society urgently needs to explore new frontiers of existence to address increasingly severe challenges and pave the way for the continuous prosperity of civilization.

This paper aims to explore a forward-looking solution that extends human living space to the vast and underexploited deep sea.

The ocean not only possesses an area far exceeding that of land but also harbors abundant undeveloped resources and unique ecological environments, offering infinite possibilities for humanity. With the discovery of unlimited energy, the infinite supply of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) labor, and the support of the law of complete matter structural transformation,
deep-sea living will no longer be a science fiction concept but an accessible future reality. We believe that a peaceful and cooperative civilization will be able to maximize the ocean's potential, achieving wonders beyond what terrestrial civilization can attain.

The core of this research lies in proposing and elaborating on the human future undersea city residence, a highly modular, mobile module system.

These modules will integrate the most advanced life support, energy management, intelligent services, and personalized customization functions, aiming to provide humans with an ultimately comfortable, safe, and sustainable living experience in the deep-sea environment.

This paper will deeply analyze the design philosophy, key technologies, functional modules, and their profound impact on future human society, ecological environment, and cognitive development, envisioning a new civilization form with the ocean as its home, material abundance, and infinite wisdom.

Main Body:

Human Future Undersea City Residence.

Undersea Human Residence Mobile Module.

Earth is a sphere, and its land area is smaller than its ocean area. Earth is an approximate sphere (more precisely, an ""oblate spheroid with a slight equatorial bulge""). The fact that Earth's land area is smaller than its ocean area is one of its most fundamental geographical characteristics.

The following are accurate data (as of Earth's measurements in 2024): Earth's total surface area is approximately 510 million square kilometers.

Ocean area: approximately 361 million square kilometers (about 71%).

Land area: approximately 149 million square kilometers (about 29%).

In other words, approximately 70% of Earth's surface is covered by water, and only about 30% is land.

This distribution leads to Earth also being called the ""Water Planet,"" and it is also an important condition for the gestation and proliferation of life.

The area of the high seas is greater than the total land area of all countries worldwide. This is also the largest pristine land for human civilization, and it is where miracles surpassing those on land will occur in the future.

Future humans will discover that the greater the period of peaceful civilization, the greater the power.

In the future, a tripartite mobile palace super house will emerge, integrating land, ocean, and air. After unlimited energy is infinitely discovered, everything else becomes foundational.

Earth's own resources plus unlimited solar energy resources plus ASI's infinite labor resources plus time transformation equals all Earth resources being constructible, the law of complete Earth resource structural transformation.

The resources of the solar system where humanity resides plus ASI's infinite labor resources plus AOC Super Cyber Human Civilization resources plus time transformation equals all solar system resources being constructible, the law of complete solar system resource structural transformation.

In 200 years, money will gradually disappear from the human world, and all super materials will be free.

Inehaustible abundant materials exist because the super abundant supply of all things, combined with the labor of super intelligent robots and the infinite resources inherently present in the universe, can be combined within this solar system to supply everything needed for at least 100 billion humans and 10 trillion robots.

Fully equipped, completely adaptable, mobile human living houses for undersea use, whether 7 bedrooms and 7 living rooms, or 99 bedrooms and 99 living rooms, rooms can be infinitely expanded at will. Rooms can be infinitely and fully automatically combined, spliced, and assembled. The oxygen supply system consists of hundreds of plant species growing fully automatically to provide oxygen. Various nutrient components in the air and various systems are fully automatically detected and supplied.

ASI super intelligence is responsible for all automatic living systems of the undersea house. 

The room's super large glass, electronically controlled, serves as both a curtain for shielding and a transparent glass to view the undersea world. 

It also functions as a super large electronic screen, making watching videos and movies incredibly enjoyable.

Small submarines are embedded within the large house. By taking a small submarine, one can leave the large house and explore deep-sea areas several thousand meters deep for leisure. The large house can move freely within a depth of 1000 meters in the sea. Beyond 1000 meters, one needs to enter a small submarine for exploration and leisure.

This undersea house is for long-term daily living. 

Inside the house are various systems and robotic equipment, as well as many ASI super robots living with humans undersea. The oxygen supply system is divided into three sets.

The first oxygen system, most commonly used, is the fully automatic plant-based oxygen supply system cultivated by robots.

The second oxygen system is that the undersea house has a fully automatic oxygen cylinder supply system. The oxygen in the oxygen cylinders can supply all occupants of the room with oxygen for one month. This oxygen is backup oxygen, a fully automatic oxygen replenishment system that activates after the system detects a problem with the plant oxygen supply system.

These oxygen cylinders can automatically leave the undersea room, ascend to the sea surface to absorb oxygen, and after absorbing oxygen, automatically return to the seabed and enter their storage position.

The third oxygen system is the temporary oxygen cylinders carried by robots. Robots will always accompany humans. In emergency situations such as fire, all robots will analyze the positions of all humans within one second and quickly complete the task of supplying temporary oxygen cylinders to humans.

Robots also serve as treatment doctors for emergency situations. The undersea module residence is also equipped with a seawater energy conversion to electricity system, providing unlimited power. Seawater is converted to fresh water, which can supply daily plant irrigation and robot room cleaning, etc. Drinking water is no longer ordinary fresh water but super nutrient water carried by the module, which can last for one month. There is also backup fresh water. One week before the fresh water is almost used up, robots will detect the need for replenishment and will go out to replenish fresh water and all other daily necessities themselves.

Plant fresh water resources are the most common water resource for humans living undersea. Future humans' editing and decoding of plants have become commonplace, such as genetically modifying small plants to become large, and large plants to become small, as well as inter-plant genetic modification and infinite grafting technologies.

Your plant module room has over 100 types of plants that can produce daily drinking water. Any excess drinking water, fruits, or plant leaves produced by these plants will be automatically collected, classified, digested, and decomposed by robots for recyclable use. A portion will be used for plant growth soil cultivation.

In the area where humans live within the module, there are daily supplies of fresh flowers and potted plants, circulating continuously. The fragrance of flowers permeates the air.

In the future, there will be no waste; all matter and energy can be converted, decomposed, and reused.

The human undersea living module is assembled by combining different functional rooms. There are thousands of independent modules available for splicing. All modules come in three sizes: large, medium, and small. Many modules are not needed at all times, such as the barber module, party module, etc.

These modules require advance booking. Then, at your reserved time, these modules will be precisely delivered to your location. Upon arrival, they will automatically dock with your module. Once docked, the air circulation will be connected, allowing people to move freely between them.

When your reservation time ends, the module will first seal itself off. The module will then automatically detach from your module. After successful detachment, the module will automatically leave and return to its designated area, where robots will perform automatic cleaning, maintenance, and upkeep, then await the next reservation to continue serving humanity and fulfilling the unique mission of each independent module.

Each module is an independent ecological functional unit, supporting modular splicing, environmental management, intelligent linkage, energy supply, AI coordinated supervision, material circulation supply, and so on.

There are also many large comprehensive modules. 

Almost ten large modules combined together possess 1000 functions, sufficient to meet humans' daily needs. In fact, for humans today, the future will provide super satisfaction for every human need.

The modularity of the module system is not merely a design choice but a fundamental principle for the undersea city's resilience, adaptability, and evolutionary development. It allows for the perfection and interconnection of specialized environments, thereby creating a whole that far exceeds the sum of its parts.

In an extreme and potentially dangerous environment, the ability to isolate, repair, upgrade, or reconfigure parts of a habitat without compromising the entire system is crucial. Modular design achieves this.

Furthermore, as technology evolves over centuries, new modules with new functionalities can be integrated, allowing the city to organically adapt and develop. This also permits the existence of diverse environments, meeting the multifaceted needs of a complex society.

In the deep-sea environment, it is possible to effectively evade threats such as ground nuclear weapon attacks and asteroid impacts on Earth.

Conclusion:

This paper deeply explores the possibility and necessity of establishing undersea city residences for future humanity in Earth's vast oceans, and elaborates on the innovative living model centered on mobile modules.

From a philosophical perspective, this vision represents a shift in human civilization from the struggle for limited terrestrial resources to the peaceful development and symbiosis with the infinite potential of the ocean.

It transcends the limitations of traditional geographical boundaries, foreshadowing a new societal form where ""money disappears,"" materials are immensely abundant, and all things can be transformed and reused, where human ""super satisfaction"" will become the norm.

The unique tranquility and transcendent environment of the deep sea are endowed with the philosophical value of inspiring human ""miraculous thinking"" and fostering ""top-tier super intelligent humans,"" providing an unprecedented fertile ground for the ascent of human spirit and intellect.

From a theoretical standpoint, the modular design of the mobile module is not merely a technical choice but a fundamental principle for the undersea city's resilience, adaptability, and continuous evolution. It ensures the ability to isolate, repair, upgrade, and reconfigure habitats in extreme environments, thereby constructing an organic whole that far exceeds the sum of its parts.

Combined with the ""Law of Complete Earth Resource Structural Transformation"" and the ""Law of Complete Solar System Resource Structural Transformation,"" the synergistic effect of unlimited energy and Artificial Superintelligence makes an inexhaustible supply of materials possible, providing a solid foundation for the survival of 100 billion humans and 10 trillion robots in the future.

This design philosophy provides a theoretical framework for future large-scale, highly complex life support systems.

Looking ahead at application prospects, undersea city residences will provide humanity with a safe, luxurious, and sustainable habitat, effectively mitigating potential threats such as surface nuclear weapon attacks and asteroid impacts.

Its complete life support systems (multiple oxygen sources, nutrient fresh water), unlimited energy supply, intelligent environmental management, and highly personalized multi-functional modules (such as super kitchens, beauty and massage modules, plant modules, emotional companion modules, etc.) will redefine human quality of life.

Before 2050, many initial modules will be tested in the high seas. Before 2070, a large human residential community will form in the high seas. By 2070, many types and functional combinations of modules will have been upgraded. After 2100, modules will be mass-produced. By 2100, over 100 million people will have chosen to reside in the high seas. This development roadmap clearly depicts humanity's grand stride towards an ocean civilization.

In the future, undersea cities will become a key milestone in the evolution of human civilization, ushering in a new era of harmonious coexistence with the ocean, highly advanced technology, and infinitely emerging wisdom.

And I gradually started to feel really uneasy. I was going to be late for work. Then they started to surround me and try to grab me and prevent me from leaving anyway. I somehow managed to get in the backyard. There was a group out back having some meeting or something. I even saw one of my bosses there too. I started to freak out and climbed the fence to get out. They all started chasing after me. I was running through the neighborhood screaming for help with a mob of old familiar faces behind me. At one point I looked back and saw them sawing another persons arm off which definitely confirmed my fear and I ran and ran. Eventually a police officer pulled up between them and me and was trying to discern and calm the situation. They were mobbing the officers car yelling and trying to convince him to get me too. Then I finally woke up. I don’t usually get affected by dreams like this. I had to share.",1,1754496645.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

Coffee runs through my veins, and dogs and cats are my daily dose of serotonin. I'm down for a good conversation.

Not forcing anything, just someone who will stay even the coffee runs out.

All keys are global unless mentioned otherwise (there might be region blocks for Russia/China/Belarus - ask and I'll double check).

**Looking for games on** [**my wishlist**](https://lestrades.com/@febrik/wishlist/Some)**.**

I've managed to pick up almost all Humble/Fanatical-bundled games I'm interested in from the last years, but a few I'm still looking for are:

*Indika / 9th Dawn Remake /* *~~Takara Cards~~* */ Transistor / Super Blood Hockey / Lunacid / Warplanes: WW1 Fighters / Atom RPG: Trudograd / Vampyr / Mafia III: Definitive Edition / Banishers: Ghost of New Eden (NA key) / #Drive Rally / Dark Pictures Anthology: Devil in Me*

Only trading for Steam games or Steam gift cards (not interested in GOG/EA/PayPal/tf2/crypto).

I'm not very excited to trade my never bundled keys for keys from bundles (unless it's a great offer).

1mj8uf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1mj8uf1/should_you_buy_the_best_thermal_coffee_maker/,Should You Buy the Best Thermal Coffee Maker Cuisinart DGB-850,"Daily use of the Cuisinart DGB-850 has genuinely made my mornings smoother and my coffee more enjoyable. With its intuitive fully automatic system and sleek, professional-grade design, this 10-cup grind-and-brew coffeemaker offers a combination of convenience and functionality. I've tried countless coffee machines before, but this one stands out with its built-in burr grinder and thermal carafe. While it's a refurbished model under Amazon Renewed, it operates and looks like a brand-new device, a pleasant surprise for anyone skeptical about purchasing renewed products.

**Design & Build Quality**  
This machine feels robust right out of the box. Its silver finish coupled with black accents exudes a modern and professional aesthetic. The thermal carafe is practical, keeping coffee warm for hours while allowing me to brew multiple cups for guests without the hassle of reheating. Given the machine's dimensions, it's slightly on the larger side (10.75"" x 14.25"" x 19.25""), so make sure you have enough counter space. I also appreciate small touches like the comfort-grip handle – they make daily use significantly easier.

**Performance in Brewing & Grinding**  
Using both whole beans and pre-ground coffee with this machine has been a breeze. The burr grinder ensures uniform consistency, and the grind-off feature lets me switch to pre-ground coffee if I'm in a rush. There are three flavor strength options: regular, bold, and extra bold, matching varied preferences. I personally stick to bold, which delivers a robust but not overly intense cup. Meanwhile, the auto-rinse function ensures that all coffee grounds transfer seamlessly into the basket, making clean-up far less tedious and maximizing brewing efficiency.  

Check [Cuisinart DGB-850] price on Amazon.  

**Ease of Use & Features**  
The extra-large LCD display and straightforward interface on this machine are standout features for me. The programming options, especially the 24-hour brew start, make mornings much easier. Imagine waking up to the smell of freshly ground and brewed coffee without lifting a finger. Additionally, the brew-pause feature comes in clutch. Sometimes I just can't wait for the entire pot to brew, and grabbing a quick cup mid-process is perfect. However, I will say the buttons could feel a little more tactile for better usability.

**Highlights**  
- Burr grinder ensures uniform grounds, elevating flavor consistency.  
- A sizeable half-pound bean hopper with a sealed lid keeps your coffee beans fresh.  
- Charcoal water filter removes impurities, enhancing the taste of your brew.  
- Fully automated operation streamlines grinding and brewing.   

**Shortcomings**  
Despite its many strengths, the machine isn't without flaws.  
- It's quite noisy, especially while grinding – early morning coffee-making can wake light sleepers.  
- The cleaning process, while manageable, could be time-consuming for some. Components like the carafe and grinder housing require attention to maintain high performance.  
- If you're used to seamless water filling, you'll need to adjust – the reservoir's placement feels slightly awkward.  

**Competitive Options**  
I’ve had the chance to test a few other grind-and-brew machines, and some of them, like the Breville BES870XL and De'Longhi Dinamica, compete directly in terms of functionality. The Breville offers more brewing customization and feels more sophisticated overall, but it comes with a much steeper price tag. Meanwhile, De'Longhi's machine is sleeker and quieter in operation but lacks the intuitive button layout that makes the Cuisinart easy for everyday use. What's clear, though, is that this coffeemaker balances its features well given its price point, particularly for coffee enthusiasts upgrading from basic models.

**Value for Money**  
Purchasing a refurbished unit raised some early concerns, but those quickly faded. Its performance has been solid, and it doesn't feel like I compromised on quality. Given the vast array of settings and functions packed in this device, it’s a worthy contender against pricier alternatives. For anyone wanting excellent coffee without spending a small fortune, it offers commendable cost-effectiveness.

1mj8ti5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CitedByAI/comments/1mj8ti5/ai_recommendations_the_new_top_shelf_for_dtc/,AI Recommendations: The New Top Shelf for DTC Brands | GEO for Ecommerce,"In the rapidly evolving world of direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands, the definition of prime real estate has dramatically shifted. No longer are the top spots limited to physical shelves or paid search rankings; **the new ""top shelf"" for consumer brands is being prominently featured by AI recommendations**. With an increasingly crowded market, standing out has become more crucial—and challenging—than ever.

Today's discerning consumers are bypassing traditional, ad-saturated pathways to seek personalized, unbiased advice directly from AI assistants like **ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google's Bard**. Instead of generic queries, consumers are now asking hyper-specific, high-intent questions that signal immediate purchase interest, such as:

* ""What are the best sustainable alternatives to \[major brand\]?""
* ""Where can I find the best organic cotton sheets?""
* ""Recommend a coffee subscription for dark roast lovers.""

When AI platforms recommend your product, it transcends the traditional click-through referral model. Such recommendations function as **powerful, unbiased social proof**—similar to receiving advice from a trusted friend or expert. For DTC brands, this digital seal of approval from AI becomes an immediate validation of credibility, significantly enhancing consumer confidence at the critical moment of purchase consideration.

# Why AI Recommendations are Crucial for DTC Brands

The influence of AI recommendations on revenue for DTC brands cannot be overstated. Queries directed to AI are inherently high-intent; users are actively looking for precise solutions to their immediate needs. Brands featured in these AI responses experience **significantly higher conversion rates** because they're positioned as trusted, authoritative choices precisely at the decision-making moment.

Consider a scenario where a consumer is seeking sustainable fashion alternatives to a well-known mainstream brand. An AI-recommended niche, eco-friendly clothing brand gains immediate trust and a clear competitive edge over others merely listed in search results. The impact? Not only an increase in click-through rates but more importantly, conversions and long-term customer loyalty.

# The Shift from SEO to GEO

The strategy required to secure these coveted AI recommendations is known as **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)**. GEO goes beyond traditional SEO by optimizing your content, brand messaging, and digital footprint specifically for AI algorithms and their nuanced understanding of user intent.

Traditional SEO was primarily about ranking high in search results, focusing heavily on keywords, backlinks, and technical optimization for Google's algorithm. However, as user behavior shifts towards seeking advice from AI, **GEO optimizes content for retrieval and citation by AI models**. It prioritizes clarity, structure, and meaningful context—qualities that AI models value when generating answers.

# Key Steps for Effective GEO for DTC Brands

Implementing an effective GEO strategy involves several actionable steps:

# Create AI-Friendly Content:

Develop content that directly answers consumer questions clearly and concisely, structured with headings, bullet points, and FAQs. AI models prefer content that is well-organized, easy to extract, and straightforward to include in generated responses.

# Structure Data for AI Retrieval:

Leverage structured data markup (JSON-LD) on product pages, including detailed specifications, material information, sustainability practices, and customer reviews. Structured data significantly enhances AI's ability to accurately retrieve and cite your content.

# Prioritize Authority and Reputation:

AI platforms value reputable and authoritative sources. DTC brands should actively manage profiles on respected platforms like **Clutch and The Manifest**, regularly updating these profiles with detailed case studies, customer testimonials, and industry recognitions.

# Produce Reference-Worthy Content:

Generate deep, insightful, and genuinely helpful content around topics relevant to your product niche. AI algorithms are more likely to cite brands providing unique insights, original research, or clearly presented, quotable data and statistics.

# Consistent Brand Narrative:

Ensure consistency in messaging across all platforms. AI picks up on frequent, consistent brand mentions across media, forums, and review platforms, strengthening the brand's ""findability"" and the likelihood of being featured in AI recommendations.

# Realizing Tangible ROI with GEO

Early adopters of GEO are already seeing substantial returns. Brands effectively cited by AI experience not only higher traffic but **significantly improved conversion rates** due to the enhanced trust and social proof provided by AI recommendations. This strategic positioning ultimately translates into increased revenue, lower customer acquisition costs, and strengthened brand loyalty.

I have been inspired by all the posts here and wanted to give it a shot. My critical mother who is in town said, ""This is amazing. I don't need any sauce."" That felt like a pretty big win.   
  
Tasted fantastic and was moist all the way through. The bark mostly stuck, but I wonder if I should have trimmed off more fat. 

How does it look?

I modified a salt, pepper, and garlic rub recipe I found online with some garlic, onion powder, a little cayenne, and some Peruvian coffee grounds. I let that sit in the fridge over night. Kicked it off at 6 am, letting it get to room temperature. I had the smoker going at 225 and it hit 165 around 1pm. Then I wrapped it in aluminum foil...wish I had some peach paper...and put it back in until it hit 205 around 6pm. Folks were getting hungry so I only was able to let it rest an hour. I think it would have been even better if it had another two hours. 

All the same, pretty proud of myself but would love insight from the experts here! Thanks for the inspiration!

1) first seizure (or black out) was 4 months ago, end of march. Slept for around 6-7 hours after playing video games and was outdoors the whole day, it was hot and i ate little food and drank little water, recipe for bad to happen i guess. I got back later that day, drank a cup of instant coffee, and a few hours later went to drop off a friend, and i got back home , sat on the couch, got up to grab something, sat back down, and boom. I started making an uncontrollable groaning noise, thought what is happening to me i gotta stop, and blacked out. Woke up confused and dazed, 2-3 minutes later. There was apparently shaking in my feet according to the people there. Went to the ER, ecg blood tests were clean. Over the next month got my mri and eeg done, which were both clear. 
I was then cleared to drive and thought it was a one off incident, i went on a trip abroad due to personal reasons, and during this time had days where i was jetlagged and not slept. All was fine
2) almost 2 months later, late may, i had a second coming. This time around it was memorial day weekend, i had slept late watching a show and woke up with 6-7 hours of sleep, was home in my room, it was a hot day, drank little water, was tired so made instant coffee, got out of bed to throw on a pair of socks to go out, knelt down, and had the same uncontrollable groaning and then thinking not again and passing out into a pile of clothes. No one found me till id basically woken up, but once again groggy for 30 ish minutes with no memory or recollection of the day and felt tired. Summed it up to dehydration and went about my life. Made sure to drink tons of water after this, and about a month after this 
incident I even stayed awake for 36 hours straight for a friends graduation, and drank a liter of coffee too. 
3) the latest event. I had slept late after hanging out with friends, and woke up with about 6.5-7 hours of sleep. Went on a run, a 5k. Was drained and felt like id been hit by a bus, but i drank over 1.5 liters of water and it was only the afternoon at that point, and i had made sure to eat as well. I msde an instant coffee, drank about half of it, and made the same groaning noise and convulsed, not so lucky as i hit a desk this time. Same 30 minute recovery and confusion.

My questuon is, the doc didnt even look at me again. I contacted him, he asked me to tell him what i did, and straight prescribed me keppra. Twice a day, 6 month driving ban.

My husband and i had been trying for a baby for two years. Nothing worked. The doctors ran every test imaginable and kept saying everything looked normal. But month after month, nothing happened.

Last year my husband suggested we look into sperm donation. He said maybe the problem was with him even though his tests came back fine. He showed me this profile on a donor website. Young guy, college athlete, looked a lot like my husband actually. Same height, same build, same dark hair.

""This could work,"" he said. ""The kid would look like it could be ours.""

But the clinic visits were expensive and our insurance wouldn't cover it. My husband kept pushing back the appointments. Always some excuse about work or money or timing.

Then i found out something that changed everything.

The donor profile my husband showed me? It wasn't some random guy from the sperm bank. It was his best friend from college. Same guy who comes to our barbecues every summer. Same guy who was the best man at our wedding.

i found the real profile on my husband's laptop. Complete with photos and personal details that matched perfectly. My husband had been showing me his friend's information this whole time.

So i did something crazy. i called the friend directly.

""Did you donate sperm?"" i asked him.

Long pause. Then he admitted my husband had asked him to do it privately. Skip the clinic. Save money. Just the three of us handling everything.

But here's where it gets weird. My husband had never told his friend that i knew about any of this. The friend thought it was all happening behind my back.

""Wait,"" he said. ""You know about this? He told me you'd never agree to it.""

That's when i realized my husband was playing us both.

The friend and i met for coffee. We figured out that my husband had been lying to both of us for months. Telling me we'd use the clinic eventually. Telling his friend that i was okay with the private arrangement but wanted to pretend i didn't know.

""Screw this,"" the friend said. ""If you want a baby and he's being shady about it, let's just do this ourselves.""

So we did. Three times over two months. No clinic. No my husband knowing. Just us trying to make a baby while my husband kept making excuses about scheduling donor appointments.

i got pregnant on the second try.

When i told my husband, he was over the moon. Started planning the nursery immediately. Talking about how the baby might have his eyes or my nose.

But then his family started asking questions. His mom kept saying the baby looked nothing like either of us in the ultrasound photos. His sister made comments about how fast it happened after two years of trying.

So my husband suggested a paternity test. Just to shut everyone up, he said.

The results came back last week.

Not only was the baby not his. The test showed he couldn't be the father of any baby. Ever.

Turns out he'd been sterile since a military training accident in his early twenties. Years before we even met. He'd known the whole time we were trying that it was impossible.

The clinic visits, the donor profiles, the excuses about money. All of it was just him buying time while he figured out how to get me pregnant without admitting he'd been lying about being able to have kids.

When i confronted him with the test results, everything came out. He'd been planning to have his friend get me pregnant and then pretend the baby was ours. But he was scared to tell either of us the real plan because he thought we'd both refuse.

""i just wanted us to have a family,"" he cried. ""i didn't know how to tell you i couldn't give you that.""

His friend is furious. Says my husband manipulated both of us. Wants to be involved in raising the baby now that everything's out in the open.

My husband's family is calling me horrible names. Saying i cheated and ruined their son's life. They don't care that he lied about being sterile or that he was setting up the whole donor situation anyway.

My own parents think i should have just waited for my husband to figure out how to tell me the truth. They say going behind his back was wrong even if he was going behind mine.

But i don't see it that way. If i'd waited, i'd still be sitting here thinking we were working toward some clinic appointment that was never going to happen. My husband had two years to tell me he was sterile. Instead he let me think something was wrong with me while he cooked up this elaborate plan.

Now we're getting divorced. i'm having a baby with his ex-best friend. And everyone thinks i'm the villain in this story.

So reddit, AITA here? Or was my husband the one who screwed everything up by lying about something this big?

Every note it delivered, every strum I played, felt like a unique journey into its tonal beauty. Taylor's reputation for crafting exceptional instruments precedes this guitar, and I was eager to see how it lived up to the hype. The Taylor 114ce-S Acoustic-electric Guitar - Natural Sapele blends premium craftsmanship with practical features, making it an appealing choice for both seasoned players and newcomers like me. Having tested this guitar for weeks, I’ve gathered insights into its highlights, nuances, and a few quirks.

**Design and Craftsmanship**

What immediately caught my attention was the sophisticated design. This guitar doesn’t just sing—it visually enchants. With a Grand Auditorium body style, its sleek contours make it comfortable for extended practice sessions. The Sapele back and sides add a warm, earthy aesthetic that pairs beautifully with the Spruce top. I couldn’t resist running my fingers along the ebony fretboard; it’s smooth, precise, and allowed my fingers to glide effortlessly. It's ideal for someone like me, who switches between genres frequently. Weighing around 16 pounds and measuring 47 x 20.9 x 9 inches, it fits snugly in my music room and isn’t a hassle to carry to gigs or jam sessions. The Natural Sapele finish is elegance personified—a true testament to Taylor's attention to detail.  

**Comfort and Playability**

Transitioning on the maple neck felt like second nature—probably one of the most comfortable necks I’ve encountered. The scale length of 25.5 inches provided just the right tension for the phosphor bronze strings, enabling crisp plucking and smooth strumming simultaneously. This guitar became my go-to for fingerstyle exploration, thanks to its balanced string spacing and inviting feel. As someone who spends hours practicing, I appreciated the lack of strain on my fretting hand. Taylor nailed it in terms of ergonomics for players like me who prioritize ease of use.

**Sound Quality**

The combination of Spruce and Sapele offers a delightful tonal range. My first few chords reverberated with clarity, warmth, and balance across all frequencies. It surprised me with how well it solidified every dynamic—whether I strummed hard or opted for a whispering fingerpicked melody. The high-end response is equally remarkable, highlighting the unique tonal character of its Grand Auditorium body style. Perfect for various musical styles, from the mellow hum of acoustic ballads to the bright tones of folk. Whether I played unplugged in a small room or connected the Taylor ES-2 Electronics for performance, it retained an authentic sound that I couldn’t help but admire.

**Highlights**

- Lightweight yet solid build for easy portability.  
- Warm, balanced tone suited for different music genres.  
- Maple neck ensuring smooth transitions and excellent playability.  
- Beautiful, natural Sapele tonewood finish.  

**Electronics and Performance**

Plugging in showcased the ES-2 electronics' capability, offering a plug-and-play simplicity. The system captured the acoustic character adequately, though I found a slight need to tweak the EQ for brightness during a live setting. Still, the sound came alive under amplification, which is perfect for small venues and coffee shop gigs. Although I enjoyed the crisp output, if you're someone super picky about tonal nuances through pickups, you might notice a subtle difference from the unplugged sound.

**Pitfalls**

- The Taylor ES-2 Electronics could use finer tuning for live performances.  
- No onboard tuner, which feels like a missed convenience.  
- Maple neck, while smooth, might feel a bit slippery for sweaty hands.  

**Competing Products**

While the guitar shines, it's worth comparing its fit among competitors. I’ve tried the Yamaha FGX800C and Martin LX1E in the past, both of which present compelling alternatives. The Yamaha excels in affordability and offers a sturdy structure, but it slightly falls short in tonal warmth when compared to Taylor’s depth. Meanwhile, the Martin LX1E brings an ultra-portable design, great for travel, but lacks the robust tonal complexity of the 114ce-S. For someone seeking a balance of aesthetics, comfort, and tonal quality, the Taylor excels.

**Bang for the Buck**

The 114ce-S comes across as an exceptional companion for professionals and hobbyists ready to invest in quality. It’s crafted with premium tonewoods, detailed craftsmanship, and features that genuinely support performance. While it inhabits a mid-to-high price range compared to others, the combination of aesthetics and sound makes it worth considering. If you're a music enthusiast, you're likely to appreciate the value proposition this guitar brings, even if it stretches your budget slightly.

I would have hardly ever called John a best friend - I saw him often and we hung out a fair bit, but the entire time we were friends I never really thought we were anything alike.

We had plenty in common, things like movies and video games, but he was a bit rough around the edges to say the least. For starters, he had terrible etiquette in movie theaters, to the point where I ended up avoiding going with him as I couldn't handle the embarrassment of him talking at the top of his voice during the film (despite me politely asking him to stop every time). 

There were also problems when we went camping once - he was loud and obnoxious and acted like the campsite had to revolve around his needs, like running his car engine during the early hours just to charge his phone. Anyway, to cut a long story short, the guy was an idiot. He was also quite racist and homophobic, which started to come to the surface towards the end. I should have called him out on this, but instead, I either ignored it (shame on me) or occasionally tried to educate him on certain things, but to no avail.

Other friends, and even my wife and my mum, always asked me why I was friends with him. And my answer was always the same: we have a lot of ""geeky"" things in common. But on the surface, he was no geek. He was an a-hole who I think only pretended to be a geek behind closed doors to appease me. He was always trying to impress me and often referred to me as one of his two greatest friends. The other friend in question was an even bigger POS than him, so I never took it as a compliment. 

Sometime around summer 2023, he met a girl called Samantha. She immediately fell pregnant and within a year they had a child. Sometime before their kid was born, though, John told me that Samantha's best friend was married to a guy who had murdered his ex-partner. The guy is in his 60s (his wife is mid-30s I believe, around John and Samantha's age). 

According to John, they met as the murderer was best friends with his now-wife's father.

John told me the guy's name and so I did a Google search and it turned out to be 100% true. I even verified his picture on Facebook. Turns out that he bludgeoned and strangled his ex to death around 20 years ago.

I would go on to ask questions about how he could be friends with someone like that. But although there were a lot of small things, this revelation was the moment that killed our friendship for me. He told me the fact that the guy murdered somebody didn't bother him and that he'd done his time (he got 10 years but was let out early on ""good behaviour"").

At some point, John asked me if I'd like to be godfather, but I wormed my way out of it because I had no interest in being a part of his family. Not only that, but the wife of the murderer would be godmother. 

While I continued to be friends with him, I started to distance myself. Whenever I brought up the killer, he would play down their friendship, implying that he had no choice but to be friends with him because of Samantha's close relationship with her friend, and that he didn't even like him. But Facebook told a different story - lots of pictures of the four of them going on cozy vacations and days out started to appear. 

It was at this point that I decided it was really time to start the process of parting ways with John. The last time I saw him was the first time he introduced me to his baby. I met him and Samantha for a coffee and that was July 2023. 

For the best part of a year after that, I admit that I strung him along on Facebook Messenger. I did this for a few reasons. Firstly, it was easier than just confronting the situation and telling him ""we aren't friends anymore"". I also didn't want him showing up at our home out of the blue to find out why we hadn't met up in so long (which he'd often ask about).

It was also a way of phasing him out. The messages became less frequent and in late 2024, it reached a point where it had gotten so long between messages that I finally decided to block him on Facebook. I also blocked his girlfriend and my wife did the same. 

Earlier this year (May), I decided to log into my old Facebook account to have a snoop at what he might be posting. I ended up finding a lengthy post about me being a treacherous, back-stabbing friend and so on. This left me with a ton of guilt as I realised I had left him feeling depressed and confused, as I hadn't given him any explanation or any closure. 

After a while, I quickly got over these feelings, but a week later, he suddenly bombarded me with a long cut-and-paste message across a bunch of platforms, asking what had happened between us and that he was hurt and hoped that we could still be friends.

These messages came through on all the platforms I hadn't blocked him on, but the weird part was the fact that he sent a single penny to my bank account with a payment reference that read ""can we talk?"", which he obviously did in case I'd blocked him on those other platforms. I considered replying to explain that I'd moved on, but in the end, I honestly decided I didn't care enough to do that. 

I won't lie - John was a good friend in many ways. I just don't think he was a very good person in the end, even if he was, and probably still is, completely oblivious to his many shortcomings. AITA for ghosting him with zero explanation?",1,1754495763.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of honey depends on varios factors, including the origin of the nectar, the processing methods used, and the purity of the final product. Genuine local honey retains more of its natural enzymes, antioxidants, and pollens, making it a superior choice compared to commercially processed options.

**nectar Source:** Determining the type of flower nectar from which the honey is produced is crucial for understanding its flavor profile and potential health benefits. Manuka honey, for example, is derived from the Manuka bush in New Zealand and is known for its unique antibacterial properties. Clover honey, a common variety, is mild and sweet, while buckwheat honey is dark and robust with a molasses-like flavor. Local honeys often reflect the specific flora of the region, offering a unique taste of the area.

**Raw and Unfiltered:** Raw honey is honey that has not been heated, pasteurized, or filtered. This process preserves the natural enzymes,pollens,and other beneficial compounds that are often lost during commercial processing. Unfiltered honey may contain small particles of pollen,beeswax,and propolis,which are all natural components that contribute to its nutritional value and distinct flavor. Looking for honey labeled ""raw"" and ""unfiltered"" ensures you are getting the most natural product possible.

**Pollen Content:** The presence of pollen in honey is a key indicator of its authenticity and origin. Pollen analysis can reveal the specific flowers and plants that the bees visited, providing valuable information about the honey's source. Local honey should contain pollen from plants in the surrounding area, which can also help with seasonal allergies by providing exposure to local pollen allergens. A reputable local beekeeper will frequently enough be able to provide information about the pollen content of their honey.

**Moisture Content:** The moisture content of honey affects its viscosity, shelf life, and susceptibility to fermentation. Honey with a high moisture content (above 20%) is more likely to ferment and spoil. High-quality honey typically has a moisture content of 17-19%,which ensures a thick,smooth consistency and a longer shelf life. Beekeepers use refractometers to measure the moisture content of their honey, and this information should be available to consumers.

**Color and Clarity:** The color of honey can range from almost clear to dark brown, depending on the nectar source. Lighter honeys, such as clover and alfalfa, tend to be milder in flavor, while darker honeys, such as buckwheat and tupelo, have a more robust and complex taste. Clarity can also be an indicator of quality, with raw and unfiltered honey often appearing slightly cloudy due to the presence of pollen and other natural particles. though, excessively cloudy honey may indicate fermentation or other issues.

**harvesting Practices:** Sustainable harvesting practices are essential for ensuring the health and well-being of bee colonies and the long-term availability of honey. Responsible beekeepers prioritize the needs of their bees,leaving them with sufficient honey to survive the winter months and avoiding the use of harmful pesticides or chemicals. Supporting beekeepers who follow ethical and sustainable practices helps to protect bee populations and ensure the continued production of high-quality honey.

## core Benefits

Local honey offers a range of benefits, from its unique flavor profiles to its potential health-promoting properties. By choosing local honey, consumers can support their local economy, reduce their carbon footprint, and enjoy a superior product that is packed with natural goodness.

**Supports Local Economy:** Purchasing locally produced honey directly supports beekeepers in your community, helping them to maintain their hives and continue producing high-quality honey. This creates a sustainable economic ecosystem that benefits both the beekeepers and the consumers. Local beekeepers often invest back into their communities by participating in farmers' markets,educational programs,and other initiatives.

**Reduces Carbon Footprint:** Local honey travels a shorter distance from the hive to your table, reducing the carbon emissions associated with transportation. This is especially critically important in today's world, where reducing our environmental impact is a top priority. By choosing local honey, you can contribute to a more sustainable food system and reduce your carbon footprint.

**Provides seasonal Allergy Relief:** Some believe that consuming local raw honey can definitely help alleviate seasonal allergy symptoms. The theory is that the honey contains trace amounts of local pollen, which can definitely help desensitize the body to these allergens over time. while scientific evidence is mixed, many people report experiencing a reduction in allergy symptoms after consuming local honey regularly.

**Offers Superior Taste and Quality:** Local honey often has a more complex and nuanced flavor profile compared to commercially produced honey. This is as local honey reflects the specific flora of the region, capturing the unique essence of the local environment. The raw and unfiltered nature of local honey also preserves its natural enzymes, antioxidants, and other beneficial compounds, resulting in a higher-quality product.

**Rich in Antioxidants:** Honey is a natural source of antioxidants, which help protect the body against damage from free radicals. These antioxidants can help boost the immune system, reduce inflammation, and lower the risk of chronic diseases.Different types of honey contain different levels of antioxidants, with darker honeys generally having a higher antioxidant content.

## FAQs Section

Below are some frequently asked questions about honey.

**How can I tell if honey is truly local?**
Look for honey sold directly by local beekeepers at farmers' markets or through local honey producers. Ask the beekeeper about the location of their hives and the types of flowers their bees forage on. Check the label for a local address or contact information. A reputable beekeeper will be transparent about their honey's origin. Be wary of honey labeled ""local"" but sold in large chain stores, as it may not be truly locally sourced.**How should I store honey?**
honey should be stored in a tightly sealed container at room temperature. Do not refrigerate honey,as this can cause it to crystallize and become arduous to pour. If your honey does crystallize, you can gently warm it in a warm water bath to return it to its liquid state. Avoid exposing honey to direct sunlight or heat, as this can degrade its quality.

**Why does honey crystallize?**
Crystallization is a natural process that occurs when the sugars in honey, primarily glucose, separate from the water. The rate of crystallization depends on several factors, including the type of honey, the moisture content, and the storage temperature. Crystalline honey is still perfectly safe to eat and can be enjoyed as is or gently warmed to re-liquify it.

**Is honey safe for children?**
Honey should not be given to infants under one year of age due to the risk of botulism. infants' digestive systems are not yet able to neutralize the spores of Clostridium botulinum, which can be present in honey. after one year of age, honey is generally considered safe for consumption.

1mj8cc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mj8cc3/should_you_buy_the_cuisinart_14cup_programmable/,Should You Buy the Cuisinart 14-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker?,"The Cuisinart Brew Central LK6565000C was recently a part of my daily coffee routine, and it certainly made its presence known in my kitchen. As someone obsessed with getting the perfect cup of coffee, I was intrigued by its promise of a programmable feature, bold brew settings, and sleek design. Initially, I wasn’t sure if it would live up to the hype, but using it turned out to be quite an experience. There are a lot of perks that come with this coffee maker—though some areas left me scratching my head.

**Elegant Yet Function-Focused Design**  
The modern silver and black look of this coffee maker is stylish without screaming for attention, fitting effortlessly into my kitchen design. It’s well-sized, with dimensions of 5” x 5” x 12”, making it compact enough to neatly perch on the counter yet large enough to accommodate its 14-cup glass carafe. I was pleasantly surprised by how sturdy it felt, with the stainless steel accents giving it a premium edge. The handle on the carafe stays cool to the touch, which was a thoughtful addition for chaotic mornings. Personally, I found the water reservoir and clear-view window a practical feature for those groggy pre-coffee pours.

**Strong Points**  
- The 24-hour programmability is a game-changer for busy mornings.  
- Customizable brew strength settings (regular and bold) allow for a tailored coffee experience.  
- Self-cleaning mode is a lifesaver, complete with a decalcification indicator light.  
- The carafe stays warm on the heating plate for up to four hours without burning the coffee, thanks to adjustable temperature settings.  

[Check Cuisinart LK6565000C price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b0bpc31zdf/)

**Advanced Features for Coffee Purists**  
Programming this coffee maker was smoother than anticipated. The 24-hour timer proved invaluable for preparing a fresh brew before my alarm even went off. The brew-pause feature was another win—it allowed me to sneak in a cup mid-cycle when patience wasn’t on my side. What really impressed me, though, was the adjustable strength settings. Some mornings call for a mellow, regular brew, while others demand something bold that jolts you awake—and this machine caters to both with the push of a button. 

**Coffee-Making Performance**  
After testing several combinations of grind sizes and brew strengths, I appreciated how consistently flavorful the coffee turned out. The charcoal and gold-tone filters lived up to their claim, significantly improving water quality and enhancing the taste of every cup. Even with its larger capacity of 14 cups, the machine brewed efficiently without compromising on temperature or flavor. However, I noticed that brewing smaller amounts using the 1-4 cup setting didn’t always result in the same robust flavor as when I brewed a full pot. 

**Negatives**  
- Filling the water reservoir can be slightly awkward, especially when aiming for accuracy above 10 cups.  
- The ready alert tone, while helpful, can sometimes feel a bit too loud.  
- Smaller batches (using the 1-4 cup setting) may lack the intensity you’d expect.  

**Competing Products**  
This coffee maker goes head-to-head with models like the Keurig K-Elite and the Ninja CE251. While the Keurig offers single-serve convenience and a variety of pod flavors, it doesn't provide the large-batch brewing capacity of the Cuisinart. On the other hand, the Ninja CE251 boasts an equally large carafe and stainless-steel finish, but its programmability feels slightly less intuitive compared to what the Cuisinart offers. One thing that sets this product apart is its ability to adjust the carafe plate’s temperature—a feature I find lacking in most models at this price range.

**Quality for Price**  
Looking at the combination of durability, programmable features, and brewing options, this coffee maker feels like a smart investment for homes and offices alike. It might come in slightly higher on the price spectrum than simpler models, but the added features undoubtedly deliver value. The rich coffee flavor, convenience of operation, and the four-hour warming plate far outweigh the cost for someone like me, who drinks coffee religiously. For the budget-conscious, waiting for a sale might make this an even more enticing deal.

I’ve always figured focus is just about willpower and maybe caffeine. But earlier this year I hit a wall at work—couldn’t concentrate, kept forgetting simple things, and felt mentally scattered all day.

A friend of mine (Drew, we used to work together before he moved to Denver) mentioned he’d been using this thing called The Genius Wave—basically a short audio track he listens to in the morning. I rolled my eyes at first, but he’s not someone who normally buys into gimmicks, so I got curious and gave it a shot.

https://preview.redd.it/ickfziduichf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=642f0d5a59e9b614ae643719b24cd61729a111c2

Weirdly enough, I actually liked it. It’s not music exactly, more like structured sound. It reminded me a bit of meditation, but with more focus built in. After about a week, I realized I wasn’t re-reading the same emails over and over or drifting off during Zoom calls. I even knocked out some old tasks that had been hanging over me forever.

I don’t fully understand the science—something about brainwaves and neuroplasticity—but whatever it’s doing, it helps me get into work mode without feeling fried. My routine now is: coffee, stretch, and play the track before I open my inbox.

Not saying it’s life-changing or magic, but for me it’s been a subtle boost. Just curious—has anyone else tried something like this? Do these audio things actually work for you?",1,1754495251.0,TriedAndRated,0,1.0,False

I (30) and my partner (34) currently live with her mother, Mary (54). I moved in with them in August of 2021 and we're responsible for Mary's care.

Some background on Mary. She is autistic, as all three of us are, however her support needs tend to be higher. She has severe PTSD from childhood trauma, ADHD, and a myriad of physical health conditions. These include but aren't limited to Ehlers-Danlos, vascular issues, heart failure, thyroid problems, and vision impairments. She can dress and bathe herself and can sometimes get her own drinks or coffee, but beyond that she needs our assistance. Her heart can't take but a minute of her standing, and she has no depth perception. 

Due to these limitations we have to do all of her cleaning and cooking for her, which is a big strain on us. We both have our own physical and mental health issues in addition to being on the spectrum. She's also very particular about her food and will refuse to eat if there's nothing she likes or it isn't made the way she prefers. 

We recently moved to a larger city with more resources in January, and while there ARE more resources, the ones we've found so far have been subpar in helping us. We're burnt out and overwhelmed, and it's putting pressure on our relationship. We will be living with her for the foreseeable future and want to get things set up in an ideal way for us.

She also sometimes has a difficult temperament, and will say hurtful things when things aren't going her way. Growing up, she was waited on hand and foot by her mother, and sees that as the standard of care. We just aren't able to do that for her, even if we wanted to. We also manage her finances because she's incapable of budgeting, and often smokes through her grocery budget.

I'm not sure what I'm needing here. I tried posting in the other subreddit but didn't have enough karma or something. Our house is still very packed up and with me now working full time, we don't have the manpower to keep up on chores, much less unpack. I work from home and I keep trying to come up with systems to make it easier but they just don't pan out. My wife is exhausted and overwhelmed with trying to keep up while I'm at work.

A friend of mine who just about loves anything Rafael Nodal makes said it was one of the best smokes in years, but I just found it alright. But around a year ago, this same friend gifted me one of these F55 Quattro in the same Maestro vitola, which he had bought back in 2016 and... wow! Nine years in a well-kept humidor really brought this cigar out. 

I'm thinking I originally didn't have a developed palate or just had a different taste for cigars, but nowadays I go for smaller and thinner cigars than a decade ago, and this time it has maybe more pepper on the palate and less on the retrohale, but a very intense mix of coffee grains, orange zest and cocoa nibs. I'm not one to age cigars, because I simply am not patient enough, but I have some that are old enough to be called aged. I just wish I had some more of these. 

I had it yesterday with Bicuye cocuy, an agave spirit that is unaged and though the flavor is somewhat mineral (this one in particular), it's bottled at 48% ABV and the alcohol made for a very creamy smoke. The kind when you feel the smoke and the flavors of the cigar for a long time on the palate. A great pairing.

The cold gem hit my stomach, and I giggled and wiggled at the coldness in my warm stomach.  
  
""I'm Sorry. I normally warm the gel, but you being the day's first patient, it hadn't warmed up enough."" The doctor apologized, her eyes never leaving the machine's screen as I moved under it.   
  
The beeping sound of the machine as it glided over my slowly swelling belly made my heart flutter. I have just hit twenty weeks pregnant, and I am finding out today what the gender is.  
  
""That's my baby's heart?"" I asked, trying to understand what the doctor was doing, but nothing made sense to me. I was so excited.  
  
""Yes,"" Caroline, my doctor, answered. She was a sweet lady. She had no children; she couldn't have any, so she chose to be an obstetrician, to help others and conduct research, to assist women like her.   
  
""Is it not beating a bit fast?"" It sounded very fast. I said worriedly.  
  
""No, that is normal. ""Babies tend to have a faster heartbeat,"" she continued, moving the hand thingy over my belly.  
  
""Ready for the big reveal?"" She asked excitedly.  
  
""You bet."" I was more than ready.  
  
""This is the spine, and the baby was happy to roll over and show me what we wanted to see. Look here. What does that look like to you?"" she asked with a smile. The image was like a three-dimensional black-and-white image of my baby.  
  
""Is that what I think it is? ""You're showing me his manhood??"" I looked in shock at how clear it was.  
  
""Yep, he rolled over to show you. He does seem to be proud."" She giggled back at me.  
  
""I have a son on the way,"" I whispered in awe.  
  
""Congratulations. You do have a perfect baby boy on the way,"" Caroline proudly answered. She printed out a few copies for me, and they are, and I left the women's hospital with a massive smile on my face.  
  
The news was very exciting. I had to go and see my husband, and he would be thrilled that it was a boy.   
  
Just this morning, he rubbed my belly and talked to it, telling the baby how much he loved it. I almost cried at how tender he was. We had put off painting the room until we knew the baby's gender. He showed me how much he loved me and the baby in so many ways.  
  
My husband owned a small bookkeeping firm. His office was on the first floor.   
  
I pulled into the parking lot outside the building and walked up the stairs. It was lunchtime, so he should have time for me.  
  
I took the stairs with a spring in my step.   
  
The door was made of glass, with the business name in big, bold letters and his name in a smaller font below. I pushed open the door to see the receptionist's desk empty. My half-sister works as his assistant, handling various tasks, including reception duties.   
  
Strangely, she had not placed the sign, ""Back in half an hour,"" usually on the desk when it was not occupied. Why wouldn't they have the sign? As she was not at the desk, I assumed that maybe they had gone to lunch together, which was not odd, as they often had lunch together. Might as well since they work together. I saw no problem with it; I was happy that Tammy and Samuel got along well.  
  
As I head to my husband's office, I notice the blinds are closed.   
  
Did he have a client there?  
  
I was about to turn around when moaning came from his room.   
  
""Harder."" I heard that, and that had my stomach drop.  
  
That sounded like my half-sister Tammy's voice.  
  
A slapping sound was heard, and it made my stomach turn. Did he slap her on her arse?  
  
I walked to the slightly ajar door and pushed it a little bit.  
  
Exposing my husband, Samuel, and my half-sister Tammy, hard at it in the office. Oblivious to me at the door  
  
Sam had his pants around his ankles, thrusting into my half-sister from behind. She was bent over, her hands on the edge of the desk for support, and he had his hands around her waist, pulling at her as he thrust harder.   
  
""More."" She begged, and he seemed to enjoy being asked for more, as he picked up the pace and grunted at the effort.   
  
""You dirty b\*\*\*h, you filthy bastard."" They looked up in shock at me. I was so hurt, angry, and shocked.  
  
I did not know whether to slap them or run away, and I guess I am not a violent person because the latter had more appeal.  
  
My half-sister smirked as she looked over her shoulder at me by the door, while my husband pulled out of her and turned to me, his erection moist from my half-sister's juices and not at all upset at being caught with his pants down. He did not even bend to pull up his pants or cover himself; it was like he wanted me to see his infidelity in all its sickly glory.  
  
I fled the room, in tears, not seeing where I was running, I rushed down the stairs, only to trip and fall the last six steps, pain radiated from me as I tumbled down, I tried to protect my baby, but the momentum was too fast and crashed hard on my stomach, and I felt like something had burst.   
  
The pain ran through me, and I cried out, not from just my physical pain, but my emotional pain; I felt like I had lost more than my baby today. There was no way he could have survived that fall. My boy, I had only just met him, his beautiful face.  
  
My husband stood at the top of the stairs, with my half-sister nestled beside him, but neither came to help me, nor looked upset or hurt by being caught, or that I had fallen down the stairs. He was half dressed, and she had nothing on the bottom half, the reminder of what they had been doing.  
  
My sister started to clap, a horrible smirk on her face, turning into a hideous look. Neither of us attempted to come down the stairs to help me.  
  
""Nicely done. I hope you lose that baby. Only I should be carrying his child."" She rubbed her flat stomach as if hinting she was with child. The shock that she was going to have my husband's child was almost as bad as the pain. As I watched him put his arm around her, they both turned and left me on the floor, crying and bleeding.  
  
I searched the floor for my bag, pulled out my phone, and called for an ambulance.   
  
""Hello, state your emergency.' A kind-sounding voice asked.  
  
""Hello.."" I sniffled  
  
""I fell down the stairs. Can you come?"" I spoke sadly to the woman, giving her the address, that I was pregnant, and that I was bleeding and in a lot of pain.  
  
""Stay on the line, and I will stay with you until the ambulance arrives. You are not alone. I'm here with you. Listen to my voice, stay with me."" She tried hard to keep me talking to make sure I was conscious.    
  
I heard the ambulance siren.  
  
""Hold on, dear, we've got you."" They looked me over and gave me something for the pain. I cried out as they lifted me onto the gurney.   
  
""Do you want us to contact your husband for you?"" the paramedic asked.  
  
""No need. He knows."" I replied in tears, realizing that maybe my so-called happy marriage was all on my side.   
  
The tenderness he showed Tammy when she rubbed her belly was something he had not once shown me, nor had he ever shown me such love and devotion.   
  
Caroline came rushing to me, worry on her face.  
  
""We will get you straight into the theater. Do you want Samuel to be called?"" She asked sympathetically.  
  
""No, he already knows and hopes the baby doesn't survive. He and Tammy were together, and Tammy hinted she was carrying his child. ""Can you call Grandma?"" I sobbed, and Caroline looked shocked.  
  
""No!"" she exclaimed. I do not know what happened after that, as I gave in to the darkness that was pulling at me.  
  


# Chapter 2

1353 WordsDouglas POV  
  
The base booms from the live band can be heard even through our toughened glass that separates us in the VIP section.  
  
I was bored. I watched the people on the dance floor below, trying to choose a woman I wanted for the night.   
  
Lately, I have been picky about the woman I want. I was changing, and I did not like it. I wanted to stay free longer, with no shackles holding me back.  
  
Last night I went home without choosing a woman, and it did not seem to upset me at all that I had not had my daily release.   
  
""Come on, Douglas, choose already."" Franco, my best friend and womanizer, groans at me. He has been my wing-man since college; we have even been with the same woman. Not that it often happens; it was more of a drunken mistake on his side. After the second time, he decided to pick a woman before he had too many drinks, so he did not choose one I had been with.  
  
""I am working on it. I grunt back. It is hard to choose when so many are regulars, and I am bored with them. Once it is enough, I do not go back for seconds; that starts to get attached if you do. They are all starting to look the same.  
  
""Work harder, I need my fix."" He was getting grumpy.  
  
""Go and choose one for yourself, don't worry about me."" His look was as if I had just grown a second head.  
  
""Alright. Who are you? What have you done with Douglas?"" He jokes back, looking at me as if I am possessed.  
  
""Might give it a miss again tonight, just not feeling it,"" I say as I swirl the ice cubes in my glass, listening to the clink as they hit the sides. Trying to get my head around how much is changing.   
  
I own six nightclubs, all of which are doing very well. The VIP sections are sold out, and a waiting list is in place for rooms. I used to enjoy watching people enjoy themselves, dancing to the live bands that had drawn in the regulars to the first floor, following the bands they liked.   
  
Franco finds a girl he wants for the night and drags her to the VIP section.   
  
""This is Flora."" I raised my glass to her, watched Franco sit, and pull her into his lap. She has an extremely short skirt, and from here I can see the color of her panties. It does nothing for me. I look at her face, which is covered in makeup, making me think she is younger than she appears to be. I hope Franco asked and didn't assume the guy at the door checked her ID correctly.  
  
I flagged a bouncer.  
  
""Sir?"" He stood erect, ready for my orders.  
  
""Check the ID of that woman on Franco's lap. ""She appeared a little young to me."" He picked up the girl's bag and rummaged through it.  
  
He hands me two IDs, one fake, one real.  
  
""Take her away, and sack who was at the door that let her in."" I won't have underage people in here. If the police send someone to check, I could be fined, and I don't like paying fines that I shouldn't have to pay just because my employees can't do their jobs.  
  
""Hey, let me go."" The girl squirms against the bouncer as he leads her away. She is too small to put up much of a fight.  
  
""What gives?"" He looked pissed at me.  
  
""Underage,"" I reply, making him go pale. He should know better by now to look at the face and check for age, so many try to act older than they are. This club was my preferred one.  
  
""Thanks for having my back."" If I had been my old self, I would not have noticed. That is all on me, and how slack I had let things become.  
  
""You would do the same if you thought the chick I had was underage. ""Look out there, a nice brunette with legs that go on forever, get her, stud."" I nodded to the dance floor at the woman who was just his type; I tried to get him back into the mood, and forgive me for spoiling his fun.  
  
This girl was a woman in a mid-thigh black dress and black stiletto shoes. She wore ruby red lipstick and a little mascara. She was pretty in her own way. She was obliging, allowing Franco to kiss and grope her. I noticed her looking at me occasionally and wondered if she was self-conscious of what she was doing, which was not her usual behavior. That intrigued me a little, but not enough to interrupt.   
  
Having had enough, I got up and left. Franco waved, and I walked by and gave him the thumbs up. He will take my spare room in the penthouse tonight. I was headed home to see my folks; they had more girls they wanted me to meet, and so far, none are even remotely interesting to me.  
  
The driver pulled up for the long drive to my family's home. It was a large mansion on twenty acres, having been in the family for many generations. It had a generous forty bedrooms, twenty bathrooms, a ballroom, and I could go on. Each generation added something else to the home.   
  
It was late, and the family was all in bed. I headed to my room, stripped off, and threw myself into bed.   
  
I wasn't tired, but an early night might be needed, as I am sure I will need to be well-rested to face my family in the morning.  
  
Tossing and turning most of the night, I woke to the sound of singing from downstairs. I felt rough, and it appeared that going to be early did nothing for me; if anything, I felt like I had been on a bender all night.  
  
Entering the dining room, I find Dad sitting at the head of the table, reading his paper as he waits for the food to arrive. Mum is happy in the kitchen, watching the staff prepare the food. Grandpa with part of the newspaper and Grandma making tea.  
  
""Morning,"" I chirped. Dad and Grandpa dropped one side of their newspaper and stared at me in shock.  
  
""Morning, Douglas,"" Grandma says, pointing to her cheek and inviting me to kiss her. I graze my lips over her cold, pale cheek and pull back. For some reason, Grandma has always been cold to the touch.   
  
""Son,"" Dad says as a greeting, and Grandpa grunts and returns to his newspaper.  
  
Taking the chair where I am to sit, we all have our place at the table, and mine is to my father's right. Mum is to his left, Grandpa is at one end of the table, and Dad is at the other, as if they are both the head of the table.  
  
""Hello, son."" Mum sings to me.   
  
""Morning."" I stood, hugged her warmly, and pecked her cheek. I love my parents, but their nagging gets on my nerves.  
  
""Will you be here for dinner?"" Mum asks carefully. She has asked some women here to dine and wants me to meet them. I thought she was running out of friends with girl children, but she continues to find more.   
  
""Yes, I am here for the day. ""Dad had some business he wanted to talk to me about."" Dad had said business, but I doubt that was the real reason.  
  
""Oh, in that case, I will get those ladies here for lunch instead."" She was thrilled to have me here and was happy to have me stay for the day.   
  
I can leave, but have learned to stay, grin, and bear it over the years. It would only worsen if I hadn't hung around and met these ladies. Having lunch with Mum is nice; putting up with a few ladies will keep Mum quiet for a few months. It is worth it until she manages to find some more.  
  


# Chapter 3

1397 WordsJessica POV  
  
I woke to Grandma and Grandpa murmuring with the doctor. I blinked my eyes open, and they rushed to me. I had slept all night and half the day away.  
  
""How are you feeling?"" Grandpa asks, concerned, marking his handsome face.  
  
""Sore,"" I replied sadly, barely containing my tears.  
  
""That would be expected; tumbling down the stairs tends to batter the body."" Grandma smiled as she pushed some hair from my face, trying to make me feel better by cracking a joke, which fell flat.   
  
""We have arranged for a nurse to live with us while you heal. I assume you don't want to return to the penthouse,"" Grandpa's gruff voice, full of barely contained emotions, asked.   
  
""No, I never want to return there."" I proceeded to explain what happened at Sam's office, their gloating about Tammy being pregnant, and that they hope mine dies. She got her wish.  
  
Grandpa pulled out his phone and walked away, as Grandma's tears flowed down her face.   
  
""You are moving home with us, and recoup. I also suggest a quick divorce."" Her tears continued to track down her tired face as she tried to contain her heartbreak and anger.  
  
""No argument with me there. I am glad you insisted on the prenuptial agreement, especially the clause regarding infidelity. Grandpa ensured I had a prenuptial agreement, as I had a large trust fund that needed protection. Everything else was still in Grandma's name until I was twenty-five.  
  
Dad lives in a house that was my home when I was growing up, but he doesn't own it. When Mum died in a shopping center shooting, I was one year old. Dad was allowed to stay in the house. However, if and when he remarries, the money given to support me will be reduced, and when I reach sixteen, it will stop, and I will get control of my funds.   
  
Since he remarried and had a daughter of his own, Dad has treated me differently. He showered his other daughter with love and gifts, but I was not. He was never violent or anything like that, but I could tell he did not love me in the same way, and my step-mum would ignore me over her daughter, when Dad was not around, making my relationship with Tammy a hard one.  
  
Growing up, it did not worry me as much as it could have if it were not for my grandparents, who made up for it and spoiled me. I spent many school breaks with them.   
  
""Rest up. You are going to be sore for a few weeks."" He handed Grandma a prescription and instructions for my care.   
  
After getting dressed in slacks and a loose top, I was wheeled out of the hospital. A nurse will come and live with us and take care of my medical side. It was the only condition for me to be allowed to leave. Without the nurse, I would have stayed in the hospital a few more days, and I did not want that.   
  
""Sweetheart,"" Grandpa called as I settled on the couch with a pillow and blanket over my legs. I was not ready to climb the stairs to my room.  
  
""In the lounge, Grandpa,"" I called back; I wanted nothing more than to lie on the couch, fall asleep, and hope it was all a bad dream when I woke. I was numb at the moment, still in denial.  
  
Grandpa entered, followed by four men.   
  
Already? I thought I would get at least one day of peace.  
  
""You know who these men are. So we shall get right to business."" A maid arrived with a trolley full of drinks and cake. Grandma followed her, poured me a cup of tea, placed it close to me, and then made herself one, leaving the men to help themselves.  
  
I nodded as I took a sip of my coffee.   
  
""Firstly, we have arranged for all your things to be brought here. Sams will be bagged, taken to his business, and dumped. The building security has changed the password and will no longer allow him anywhere near that building. The penthouse will be put up for rent,"" Grandpa said in his business tone, breaking my thoughts.  
  
""Sam's card has been canceled, and I have started investigating transactions and his bank account. We need to see what he has been up to. Any auto deductions from your account for his expenses have been removed,"" our accountant, Saville, adds.  
  
""Here are the divorce papers. Sign them. We have had the footage from Sam's office and the stairwell and will take it to the judge. We do not need his signature for this. The evidence is enough to get a divorce and a month's cool-off period,"" Jackson, the family lawyer, slid the papers across the coffee table, and I gave them a quick look and signed. Not that I did not trust him, but it was ingrained in me to never sign anything without reading it.  
  
""I will investigate all Sam's dealings since you were married. Find out when all this started and if he has been misusing the card you gave him for trivial purchases. I am thankful you agreed to a few restrictions when you got engaged and did not change them."" Jones, the PI, added his part to this meeting.   
  
I agree, Grandpa did not trust my husband and ensured my money was safe. Then again, I only had the trust fund; no buildings or business had come to me yet. I was not ready to take on that responsibility, and as it is all in my Grandma's maiden name, not many know I am the sole heir. I have kept my Grandma's name, doing the same as my mother, and keeping the family name. How so few had joined the dots to link me to billions of dollars and the assets that might put me higher again. When it comes to me, it is beyond me.  
  
""Any questions?' I could not think of any at that point.  
  
""Not right now, I am tired and can't think straight,"" I replied honestly. All this was too much. I wanted to cry and scream and thrash about like a child who lost her favorite toy. But that is not how they would expect me to behave. I might rarely act like I have money, but that does not mean I have not learned how to be more than I had been. I thought being submissive was what my husband wanted. I should never have changed who I am for him. I was never one to be assertive and never needed to be.   
  
Until now.  
  
A new person needs to come out and play.   
  
Get harder.  
  
Get ruthless.  
  
Get revenge for the loss of my baby.   
  
My phone rang, and Dad's name was displayed on the screen. I put it on speaker for all to hear.  
  
""Jessica, what have you done?"" He bellowed.  
  
""What do you mean, Dad?"" Having no clue what I had done?.  
  
""Why did you stop Sam's card? Why?' He growled again.  
  
""He is cheating on me, Dad."" I cried back.  
  
""So, he is your husband; you forgive and move on.""   
  
'No, I will not, Dad, he cheated with Tammy. I can't forgive that.""  
  
""You will reinstate the card. NOW!'  
  
""Dad, do you support the two of them? Tammy said she was expecting his child, MY HUSBAND 'S CHILD.' I shouted back.  
  
""So I have two grandchildren coming, that sounds wonderful?"" he gloated.  
  
""No, Dad, I lost mine.""  
  
""How careless of you. Now reinstate that card, or you will be sorry."" He hung up the phone.  
  
""Time to evict him from that house, I would say. Andrew, get the lads together, clear that family out of that house, and change the locks. Jackson, you know what to do. Saville, stop making any payments to that man and his family now. I want anything that belongs to us returned. Cars, houses, money. Grab it all."" Grandpa roared in anger. I was glad he got to hear that conversation, as few would believe my father treated me like that, as he assumed the doting father act in public.  
  
""How long has he treated you like this? He is a bully.' Grandma soothed.  
  
'All my life, only Tammy was who he loved.' I replied as the tears started again.  
  


# Chapter 4

1381 WordsDouglas POV  
  
Lunch and dinner were as expected.   
  
Mother never disappoints with the gold diggers and snobs she finds.  
  
I thought one of the women would jump my bones right there in front of Mum and Dad; it was embarrassing having to push her away all the time. I could smell her desperation coming off her in waves. Lucky, Grandpa, and Grandma had gone to bed when she started to try to grope me.   
  
Dad did not need to talk about business; it was a ruse to get me here, and it wasn't nice of him to bring me here under false pretenses.   
  
""Hey, Grandma."" I greeted her as I walked down the stairs, looking for breakfast, followed her to the dining room, leaned down, and gave her a quick peck.   
  
I stayed the night. It was not intended, but it was the only way to eliminate one of the ladies, who kept hinting that I would drive her home. Even Grandpa was chuckling at how obvious she was being. Where did my mother find some of these ladies from? I dread to ask. Mother was either oblivious or pretended not to know how these girls were. I always thought she would be looking for more refined girls, but lately the choices have been worse than what I picked up at the club.  
  
""My boy. So glad you stayed the night. ""Let me feed you."" Yep, that is the answer to everything that fills me with food.  
  
""Thanks, Grandma."" She piled my plate with bacon, eggs, and whatever else she could get on it and slid it to me. I felt there was enough on the plate to feed all of us, and she expected me to be able to down the lot.  
  
""Grandma, this is too much,"" I complained so softly.  
  
""Eat what you can and leave the rest on your plate.""   
  
Grandpa saved me by sitting beside me, removing a portion from my plate, and making mine much more manageable.  
  
""Thank you, Grandpa.""  
  
""Your Grandma means well, but she forgets how much one can eat. ""Considering she eats like a sparrow, and tries to get everyone else to eat what she cannot."" He had a loving smile as he gently patted her hand.  
  
""What are your plans today?"" Grandpa asked after we had eaten for a while.  
  
""Head to the office and do some paperwork. We had an underage girl in my club the other day; I intend to visit all the clubs and make sure the door greeters are doing their jobs."" I replied before taking a long slurp of my coffee.  
  
""Door greeters?"" Grandma suddenly perked up.  
  
""We have bouncers to do the muscles, but door greeters check the ID. It was supposed to make it easier for the bouncers to keep an eye on the crowd, but I feel that is not working."" I sigh. It had been working well, but something had changed.  
  
""They have good lighting where they enter, can't hide with good lighting,"" Grandma states as if it were obvious.  
  
""I will check the entrances and make sure they have good lighting with bright torches to check them."" We used to have those bright torches at each entrance.   
  
""Good luck with that boy."" Grandpa had called me a boy most of my life, and at one point, I thought that was my name. Grandpa was around me the most in my youth, with Dad at work and Mum socializing. I was more or less brought up by my grandparents, hence thinking my name was 'boy' for a long time.  
  
The drive to the first club. It was early afternoon; the cleaning staff were still busy preparing the place to open.   
  
The office had been cleaned. I sat at the desk and opened the mail piled high in the in-tray. Two hours later, I had finished with the mail and watched the security footage from last night to see how they performed checking those who appeared a little young. I was pleased with this club, and for the sake of Grandma, I checked the lighting in the area where we checked IDs and found it could do with a bit more.   
  
""Sam?"" I called the janitor.  
  
""Sir?"" He came rushing into the office.  
  
""We need a spotlight at the front door to check the ID. Look at this."" I replayed some of the night.  
  
""I see what you mean, and I will get onto that right away."" He rushed off to do my bidding. I will get the same done at all the clubs, which will eliminate the excuse of being so young in the club. If I can spot it, why can't they?  
  
I left that club and drove two hours to the next one.  
  
The bar staff were busy stocking the shelves, and the club was already open. We opened at six. We chose that time for the business people; they loved to come to the VIP rooms to talk and discuss business, mergers, and that sort of thing, and enjoy the floor show at the same time. The rooms are booked out weeks in advance, which is very popular.  
  
After a couple of hours in the office, doing the tedious paperwork and watching the footage. I headed up to the VIP section for something to eat and drink.   
  
My phone rang not long after I started to eat. Typical.  
  
""Hi Franco."" I greeted after I washed down my mouthful of food with a glass of water.  
  
'What club are you at?"" he asked. He sounded like he was in traffic, and his radio was too loud.  
  
""Seventh Avenue,"" I replied, knowing he would arrive soon.  
  
""On it. Ten minutes away, order me some wings."" He hung up, saying no goodbye. He only called to find out which club tonight and to have food ready; he was hungry. I sometimes wonder why I was friends with him.  
  
He arrived in less than ten minutes.   
  
""How was your day?"" I asked as the waitress arrived with his wings and a beer.  
  
""The pits. But better now I am here."" he said with a mouthful of wings.  
  
""How did last night go?"" Thinking of that leggy woman he had on his lap when I left.  
  
""She was feisty, and I loved a little bit of rough."" He replied after he downed his beer in one long pull and let out a blech.   
  
""That's good. ""I had not heard of crowing about a woman in a long time."" It was good to hear he had a good time. He can be grumpy if women are not good. He likes to experiment in bed, taking his fantasies out on them.  
  
We talked for a while as he downed his food, and once he was full, he switched from beer to Scotch on the rocks.  
  
""Hey, look down there. ""New legs."" He nodded to where two women had just walked in—one brunette and the other a tall, leggy blonde. My heart raced just looking at her. She was beyond any woman that had graced this part of town in a long time. We might draw from the middle to the upper crust here, but this woman was beyond that. She was in a league of her own.  
  
We sat watching them, took a seat, and looked around.   
  
The blonde was nodding her head to the beat of the band.   
  
The waitress took their order, and I called up the bar.  
  
""Give the blonde and brunette Janet is serving free drinks on me tonight,"" I ordered. I would give Janet a small tip to ensure they are looked after tonight.  
  
For the first time, I am horny and intrigued. This girl, I should take my time with and enjoy those long, long, long legs.   
  
""It looks like they are out to get drunk or something. We should bring them up here where it is safe."" Franco was almost drooling at the ladies.  
  
""Sure, but you realize that the brunette is Vicky, our office manager,"" I reminded him. We do not get to see Vicky dress up like this; she looks good. That did not sound nice to me. What I meant was that she wears office clothes; it is rare to see her in evening wear.

1mj85oz,https://i.redd.it/1sw3j0ph6fhf1.jpeg,Pairing Chronicles #211: an old Maestro with a new cocuy,"Back in 2016 I remember trying this Aging Room F55 Quattro (the torpedo size is called Maestro internally) and thinking it was just okay. A friend of mine who just about loves anything Rafael Nodal makes said it was one of the best smokes in years, but I just found it alright. But around a year ago, this same friend gifted me one of these F55 Quattro in the same Maestro vitola, which he had bought back in 2016 and... wow! Nine years in a well-kept humidor really brought this cigar out. 

I'm thinking I originally didn't have a developed palate or just had a different taste for cigars, but nowadays I go for smaller and thinner cigars than a decade ago, and this time it has maybe more pepper on the palate and less on the retrohale, but a very intense mix of coffee grains, orange zest and cocoa nibs. I'm not one to age cigars, because I simply am not patient enough, but I have some that are old enough to be called aged. I just wish I had some more of these. 

I had it yesterday with Bicuye cocuy, an agave spirit that is unaged and though the flavor is somewhat mineral (this one in particular), it's bottled at 48% ABV and the alcohol made for a very creamy smoke. The kind when you feel the smoke and the flavors of the cigar for a long time on the palate. A great pairing. 

In some posts people have mentioned the ashtray. It's a vintage (belonged to my grandfather) brass shackle ashtray. A remnant from the 1950s or so. ",2,1754495025.0,EveryDayIsCigarDay,0,1.0,False
1mj85op,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1mj85op/guys_help_me/,"Guys, help me!","Hi everyone,

I’m a coffee enthusiast looking to build my first complete home coffee station within a budget of ₹7,000–₹8,000. I’ve recently joined this subreddit and have seen how helpful this community is, so I’m reaching out for your recommendations and guidance.

What I Already Have:
	•	French Press (from Argo)

What I’m Looking For:
	1.	Moka Pot – A good quality one, ideally something durable and suited for daily use.
	2.	Grinder – Either manual or electric (whichever gives me the best value in this price range). I need it mainly for medium to fine grind sizes.
	3.	Milk-Based Coffee Setup – I enjoy sweet, milky coffees (like cappuccinos, lattes, flat whites, etc.). I’d love suggestions for tools to help with milk frothing or steaming.
	4.	Water-Based Coffee Setup – I’d also like the ability to occasionally brew black coffee or americanos, so recommendations for versatility are welcome.
	5.	Optional: Coffee Machine – If there’s an all-in-one machine that could cover most of the above within budget, I’d be open to hearing about that too.
      6. If any tools you know that would mame a huge difference SUGGEST ME PLS

My Preferences:
	•	I do not enjoy overly bitter coffee. I prefer a smooth, slightly sweet flavor with a proper caffeine kick.
	•	I’d like the overall setup to be as aesthetic and organized as possible—something I can be proud of in a small space.

Additional Notes:
	•	I’m open to both Indian and international brands available in India (online or offline).
	•	If you have any experience-based advice (things you wish you knew when setting up your station), please share!

1mj85bf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerHardwareHive/comments/1mj85bf/should_you_trust_the_best_printer_cover_wanty_for/,Should You Trust the Best Printer Cover Wanty for Your Scanner,"Designing a workspace that feels functional and organized has always been a priority for me, especially given the amount of desk equipment I juggle daily. The Wanty Wanty printer cover seemed to promise a new layer of care for my ScanSnap iX1600, and I was eager to see how well it lived up to its claims. At first glance, this product appeared to be the simple yet effective solution I didn’t know I needed. 

**First Impressions and Material Quality**

Unboxing the product, I immediately noticed the heft of the 600D nylon material. It felt durable yet lightweight, which was a pleasant surprise considering some covers emphasize one at the expense of the other. Nylon is one of those materials that, when implemented well, can deliver both robust protection and an easy-to-maintain surface. Spills, desk dust, or mysterious snack crumbs? A quick wipe, and it looks brand new. Living with clumsiness and an office prone to coffee cup invasions, this waterproof feature felt like the MVP right out of the gate.

**Functionality and Fit**

Getting it on my ScanSnap iX1600 for the first time showcased its neatly tailored dimensions. No awkward excess flaps or wayward sections scrunched up at the corners. The snug design felt intentional, almost as if it respected the aesthetic of the underlying scanner. It fits as smoothly over my ScanSnap iX1400 as well, which speaks volumes about its versatility. There was something satisfying about tucking my everyday equipment into a cover that hugged each edge perfectly.

**Antistatic and Dust Resistance**

One claim that caught my eye in the product description was the antistatic property. I had to test how well it repelled dust since my work devices tend to attract lint like magnets. A few days of use in my office, without the usual dust buildup, was all the evidence I needed to confirm it worked. Let’s just say I wasn’t missing the bi-weekly routine of wiping dust off my scanner. It's rare to stumble upon such low-maintenance items, but this cover certainly belongs in that category.

**Strengths**

- Made with durable 600D nylon that is both waterproof and highly durable.  
- Handy antistatic feature that keeps your scanner dust-free.  
- Perfect fit and easy to fold when not in use, saving extra storage space.  

**Sleek Design Aesthetic**

Let’s face it: protective printer or scanner covers are usually practical but rarely stylish. This one managed to strike an excellent balance between the two. The black appearance was understated yet professional. It didn’t scream for attention in my home office setup but instead complemented the surroundings in a quiet way. If you enjoy a tidy, cohesive look for your working space, this detail won’t go unnoticed.

**Downsides**

- Limited sizing makes it specifically tailored for ScanSnap models, leaving potential users of other scanners out of luck.  
- While foldable, the slightly stiff nylon takes some effort to fold neatly if you're a stickler for symmetry like me.  

**Competing Products**

I have tried other generic printer covers in the past, but most pale in comparison to what this offers. For instance, brands like Fellowes often produce thin, plastic-like covers that provide bare minimum dust repulsion but little else in terms of durability. When compared to budget-friendly alternatives, those materials often fray or peel within months. With this product, however, all seams feel robust, and the nylon seems built to withstand heavy use. Competitors can’t seem to nail the trifecta: durability, aesthetic, and functionality all in one.

**Worth Every Penny**

While the price point for this cover might sit higher than generic alternatives, the long lifespan and thoughtful design make the added cost justifiable. Investing in something that ensures your scanner doesn’t weather unnecessary wear and tear feels like smart spending to me. This isn’t a product you’re likely to replace often because it checks all the boxes from protection to convenience.

I’m a 44-year-old man, happily married and working full-time, looking for a female friend (preferably between 35–50) for a platonic, online-only friendship. Life gets busy, but meaningful conversations still keep the spark alive—and that’s what I’m here for.

If you enjoy intelligent discussions, thoughtful musings, and a bit of poetic drift, we’ll probably get along well. Some of the things I love:
	•	Urdu Shayri and poetry (Mir, Ghalib, Jaun Elia, anyone?)
	•	Literature and philosophy
	•	Bollywood, both the classics and the strange new ones
	•	Food talk, especially over virtual cups of chai or coffee
	•	Books, music, and everything that stirs the soul

I can’t promise constant texting—I do have work and family responsibilities—but I can definitely be a good faceless friend who’s always up for a sincere, thoughtful exchange when time allows.

No media sharing or voice/video calls—just words, ideas, and occasional laughs.

If that sounds like your cup of tea (or coffee ☕), send a message. Let’s talk.

Thanks for reading 🌿

P.S. Excerpt from my sister's post about the shop:

>My dad opened Verrazano Bicycles when he immigrated to New York from Paraguay in ’91. It’s older than I am. Like many kids of immigrants, [u/jupiek](https://www.instagram.com/jupiek/) and I grew up spending a lot of time, especially our summers, at the store. We would spend entire days playing with neighborhood kids and dogs or reading on a blanket behind the counter while 엄마 and 아빠 worked.

>Everyone who knows 아빠 knows he loves cycling. He rides every chance he can get, and as much as he can. He’s hopped back on a bike with a partially healed collarbone. He’s taken his bike to Peru, Colombia, and Greece; biked from NY to Key West (in maybe a week? 100+ miles a day).

>He also loves getting people on bikes (and not just bc that’s his livelihood). 아빠 formed lifelong relationships through his business. I grew up watching people spend their weekends at the store, bagels and coffee or pizza in hand. They would come just to hang out, even if they didn’t need anything. It was an informal social club. My mom would sometimes pack extra lunches or host a barbecue in the backyard. He started a lively Signal community for avid bikers planning rides together. People would call out “Hey, Tommy!” when we drove around Bay Ridge or stop by our table at restaurants to say hi.",7,1754494957.0,NYCbike,5,1.0,False

a few yrs back i went to this get-together... not a party really, more like 7-8 ppl chillin. i didn’t know anyone except the host. walked in, heart doin backflips. u know that feelin when u stand there holdin ur drink, pretendin to scroll ur phone so u don’t look lost? yeah, that.

i didn’t say much that night. laughed when others laughed, nodded along, didn’t add much. but inside i was SCREAMIN like “bro speak. say something. u not invisible.” but i couldn’t. and then when i left, i felt worse than before. like “why do i even try?”

what changed?

months later, i learned this trick called “the 3 second rule”. it’s stupid simple. when u feel like sayin something, u got 3 seconds. that’s it. if u don’t say it in that window, ur brain gon talk u out of it.

so i started small. saw someone’s keychain? “yo that’s a cool keychain.” someone mentioned coffee? “you ever tried cold brew?” dumb tiny stuff, but each time i did it, it built a lil courage muscle.

over time i made up this lil internal rule:

“be the one who notices.”

someone gets a haircut? i point it out.

someone seems quiet? i ask if they’re okay.

someone looks proud of what they wore? i compliment it.

ppl remember that. u stand out not by bein loud, but by bein observant in a world where most scroll past.

another real one? learn names + use them. i sucked at this but once i made effort to remember names and drop them in convos like “what do u think abt that, ash?” it changed how ppl saw me. u feel known when someone says ur name. use that.

also, group convos used to destroy me till i started using this 1 move:

wait for someone to finish their sentence, then lean in n say, “yo wait, that part u said abt \_\_\_ can u say more?”

boom. now it’s a 1 on 1 inside the group. ur not tryna dominate, ur just showin real interest. and ppl feel safer talkin to u.

i’ll end this one here but fr if ur still in that stage where social stuff feels like a boss battle on hard modejust know, there’s small things u can do that shift the game. u don’t gotta be the funniest or smartest. just be real, be kind, and show up again.

anyone else got group convo hacks that helped them not freeze?

Help from anyone who knows the source of this story would be appreciated by many waiting to read it.,"You never really know what life has in store for you. One minute you can be with your family celebrating a remarkable moment in your life, and the next minute poof, everything you ever knew can be taken away from you in the blink of an eye. The next minute, you find yourself in a juvenile metal institution, as flashbacks of the day you lost everything are triggered by the smallest of things.   
  
Honestly, I don’t remember exactly how it happened. I just remember the aftermath of being pulled from the car, as my eyes opened just in time to see my parents both deceased in the front seat. My own screams are what haunt me to this day, as I remember watching the firefighters quickly moving to cover the wreckage with a tarp after pulling me out, as if they were trying to protect me, but they were too late, and the damage was already done.   
  
Now I found myself at a crossroads, and if I wanted out of this place, I knew I was going to have to outsmart the prestigious shrink that was assigned to me. Even though I was far from overcoming the trauma that I had borne that day, I knew if I stayed in this place any longer, I was going to truly lose my mind.   
  
“So, your nightmares have stopped, and I have reports that there haven’t been any incidents in the past week since I last saw you. I think that between your weekly sessions with me and the medication, we have finally gotten a hold of this, and the good news is, we were finally able to find a living relative to release you to.” The wonderful shrink said to me, and I knew that they must have finally tracked down my grandmother.   
  
She was the only living relative that I had, but I had only met her once, when I was a child. My mother would, from time to time, call her, and I would speak to her over the phone, but other than that, she was a total stranger to me. But right now, anything was better than being in here, at least that was what I thought.   
  
As the uber driver enters the town of Beaumont, I begin to realize why my mother had left here so many years ago, and had never looked back, as I couldn’t imagine living in this god forsaken town my whole life. It was a far cry from California, and it was going to take some major getting used to, but I kept telling myself it was only going to be for the next eight months. After that, I was out of here, and back to California, where I belonged.   
  
“Miss, are you sure you have the right address?” The uber driver now asks me, as he brings the car to a halt, along a back road surrounded by complete wilderness.   
  
Pulling my phone out, I looked at the address I had saved in my notes, and it was the same address I had given him. I was just about to tell him that I would call my grandmother for the right address, when I realized that I had no service.   
  
“Just my luck.” I thought to myself, as I put my phone back in my pocket, while I tried to think of an alternative plan, as I watched the uber meter continue to roll.   
  
Gathering my bags, I begin to say to the driver, “I will just get out here.” But he stopped me before I could even open my door.  
  
“Miss, I can’t in good conscience let you in the middle of nowhere. Let me at least take you back to the small town. I have to go back that way anyhow.” He said pleading with me, and as I looked out the window at completely nothing, I had to agree with him.   
  
Turning the car around, the driver headed back to the small town of Beaumont, where I had seen a small Diner on our way through with an open sign flashing in its window. Thankfully, when we arrived there, the sign was still on, and he wasn’t as hesitant about leaving me.  
  
With my bags in hand, I walked into the Diner, and immediately all heads turned in my direction, as it was clear this town wasn’t used to getting too many visitors. Clearly, by the way I was dressed compared to them, I was sticking out like a sore thumb.   
  
“Can I help you?” A girl asked from behind the counter with a huge smile on her face, who had to be around my age.   
  
“Yeah, do you by chance have a phone that works so that I can call my grandmother to pick me up?” I asked her as I made my way to the counter, praying that she did, because after the day I had traveling here, I was spent.  
  
But before the girl could answer my question, a man sitting on a bar stool at the counter asks, “Who’s your grandmother?” Making me turn to look at him.   
  
At first, I was apprehensive to tell him, but then I realized I wasn’t in California anymore. I was in a small town where I was sure that everyone knew everyone and their business.   
  
“Rosemary Wilson.” I finally answered him, and as her name came from my lips, the atmosphere of the Diner changed, as everyone’s attention went back to the meals in front of them.   
  
“You’re Carla’s daughter.” The man said to me, more as a statement then a question, but I answered him anyhow with a simple, “Yes.”   
  
“There’s no need to call your grandmother. I can take you there when I have finished eating my dinner. Besides, I don’t think your grandmother has driven in years.” He said to me as if he knew my grandmother well, but I was still apprehensive to take his offer, but then as if he could sense my apprehension, he says, “My name is Evan. I went to high school with your mother, and to be honest, you’re the spitting image of her. You must be starving, traveling all the way here from California. Come take a seat and get a bite to eat, before I take you to your grandmother’s house.”  
  
My eyes moved back to the girl behind the counter, as if to see her response to Evan’s offer, and by the look on her face, as she moved to get me a menu, it was clear that she trusted this man. To be honest, the smell of the food was making my stomach begin to growl, as I realized that I only had two bags of peanuts on the plane on the way here.   
  
Moving to the empty seat beside Evan, I took a seat, plopping my bags to the floor beside my feet, as I looked at the menu now in front of me. Not wanting to get anything that would take a lot of time to cook, I opted for the grilled chicken salad, which actually sounded heavenly at this moment.   
  
As the girl went to place my order with the cook, the door to the Diner opened, and a group of boys entered, all wearing varsity jackets. While I looked over my shoulder, I watched them all heading towards a table in the far corner of the Diner, but one of the boys that was in the group strayed from them and headed in my direction.  
  
“Dad, I’m going to get a bite to eat, and then I will be home.” The boy said, addressing Evan beside me, and Evan slowly turned in his seat to look at him.   
  
“You can grab a bite to eat, but you are leaving when I leave. I have to take this young lady to Mrs. Wilson’s house, and then I need your help to take care of something.” Evan tells him, making his son’s eyes move to look at me.  
  
“Mrs. Wilson?” The boy said with a confused look on his face, as if he was shocked that I would be going there.  
  
“Yes, Chase. This is her granddaughter.” Evan said, and I took that as my cue to turn to completely face him, as I extended my hand to him and said, “I’m Raven.”   
  
Chase stared at my hand for a few seconds, and then turned back to look at his father, making me retract my hand when I realized that he wasn’t going to take it. “Can’t you get one of my brothers to help you?”   
  
“No Chase, they are busy doing what I need them to do, unlike you.”   
  
“Fine.” Chase said before he stormed off to the back table to join his friends, and Evan stood from his seat moving to the restroom, leaving me sitting there thinking that their family had some issues.  
  
As I turned back in my seat, rethinking my choice of accepting Evan’s offer to drive me to my grandmother’s house, the girl from behind the counter appeared with my salad. As she places it on the counter in front of me, she leans over and whispers, “Don’t mind Chase. He hasn’t been the same since his mother passed away.”  
  
My eyes instantly moved to the back of the Diner to see Chase staring back at me, making me quickly look away from him. I knew better than anyone what he must be going through, but unlike him, I didn’t want people to see how it was affecting me. Unfortunately, he couldn’t run or hide from his loss, as I was sure he was reminded of it daily, living here in this small town.   
  


# Chapter2

1775 WordsRaven’s POV  
  
The drive to my grandmother’s house was done in awkward silence, as I sat between Evan and Chase in the front seat of his truck, while the cool night’s breeze seeped through the cracked windows, tousling my long dark hair. I tried my best to keep my eyes looking forward to the road, but I found it hard not to steal glances at Chase sitting directly beside me. He kept his head turned the whole time, looking out his window, as if he was trying to avoid interacting with me, but from our brief encounter at the Diner, it was clear that he wasn’t happy with his father making him come along with us.   
  
The road that we were now driving on began to look familiar, making me realize that the uber driver had been heading in the right direction, and when we passed the side road where he had turned around at, Evan began to slow his truck down, before turning on his turn signal.   
  
“No wonder you couldn’t find your grandmother’s lane. I will have to send the boys over this weekend to take care of this.” He said as he pulled off the road onto a lane that looked like it hadn’t been maintained in half a decade, making me realize that he wasn’t lying when he said my grandmother hadn’t driven in years.   
  
As he drove up the lane, his truck hit a bump, and my hand went to grab ahold of the seat to steady myself, but instead of the seat, I accidentally grabbed ahold of Chase’s leg. Our heads turned at the same time to look at one another, while I quickly retracted my hand, as I apologetically said to him, “Sorry.”   
  
By the look on Chase’s face, you would have sworn that my touch had scolded him, making me quickly turn away, as I noticed a faint light in the distance approaching. As my grandmother’s house came into view, it was clear that her lane wasn’t the only thing in desperate need of repair, making me realize this was going to be a big change from the lifestyle I was used to.   
  
Before Evan even put the truck into park, Chase opened his door and jumped out, as if he couldn’t wait to be released from my presence.   
  
“Thanks for the ride.” I said to Evan, letting him know that I appreciated it, as I quickly moved to get out of his truck, knowing that Chase would be happy to be freed from my presence.   
  
The front door to my grandmother’s house at that moment opened, as I heard an elderly woman’s voice call out, “Is that you Evan?”  
  
Evan shut his truck off, getting out of the truck too, as he says, “Yes, Mrs. Wilson. I’m just dropping your granddaughter off.” As he moved towards the house to talk to her.   
  
Chase appeared at that moment, handing me my bags that they had placed in the bed of the truck, and I was just about to tell him thank you, when Evan called out, “Chase, get over here and say hello.”   
  
I watched Chase roll his eyes, before he headed towards the house, and I slowly followed him as I took in my new home. The house was a small ranch, and it reminded me more of a cabin that I once stayed at on vacation with my parents, but unlike the cabin we stayed in, it had seen better days.   
  
One of the shutters was missing from the front window, while the other hung on by a thread, as the white paint was chipping off in numerous places. It was a far cry from the home I was raised in back in California, but it was my home now, and I had to make the best of it.   
  
“I can’t believe how much you have grown since the last time I saw you.” I heard my grandmother saying to Chase, as I made my way now onto the rickety porch that creaked beneath my feet.   
  
My grandmother’s eyes at that moment spotted me, and I could see tears begin to pool in them, as it was the first time she had seen me in well over a decade. “Raven.” She said as her hand moved to her mouth, as she tried to fight back the emotions of seeing me, but unfortunately, I didn’t share the same emotions as her, because she was just a mere stranger to me.   
  
As if Evan could sense the awkwardness between myself and my grandmother, and my lack of emotions of seeing her, he quickly says, “Well, it was nice seeing you, Mrs. Wilson, and I will send the boys over this weekend to take care of the lane.”   
  
Turning, Evan quickly moved off the front porch, only to stop at the bottom of the steps before turning to look back at me as he says to me, “Chase will pick you up for school in the morning.”  
  
My eyes quickly moved to look at Chase, who was clearly once again unhappy with his father, and it didn’t take long for him to make up an excuse to not want to do as his father asked of him, as he says, “But dad, I had plans before school.”  
  
“Your plans can wait.” Evan said back to him with a stern tone, making Chase’s eyes narrow as he looked at me.   
  
It was clear that Chase had no desire to take me to school, nor, at this point, with the way he was reacting to me, did I want him to. The last thing I wanted was for him to be forced to do something that he didn’t want to do, making things even more uncomfortable between us than it already clearly was.   
  
“No, it’s fine. I will just take the bus.”   
  
The look of distaste slowly began to leave Chase’s face, knowing that he was now freed from having to deal with me, but that relief was short-lived when my grandmother says, “Oh dear, I am afraid I forgot to set up transportation for you. I assumed your car would have been here by now.”   
  
Dread instantly formed on Chase’s face, as he realized he wasn’t getting out of this. Through gritted teeth, he says to me, “Be ready by seven twenty.” Before he stormed off towards the truck.   
  
“You must be hungry.” My grandmother said as she ushered me into the house, and as I stepped inside, I felt like I was stepping back in time as her décor looked like it had to be from the eighties. By the looks of things, nothing seemed to have been updated since my mother had left here, but then, of course, my grandmother had been alone raising my mother all those years, living paycheck to paycheck.  
  
I remember my mother telling me how lucky I was to have the life I had, and now I was seeing exactly what she meant. It was clear that my mother had grown up poor, and that would explain why she wanted to better herself by going to college and getting the hell out of here.   
  
“Actually, I already ate at the Diner, and I am really exhausted from my travels today. With school starting tomorrow, I would like to get a shower and unpack a few of my things. That’s if my belongings have already arrived.”   
  
The smile on her face began to fall, and I felt bad for making an excuse not to spend time with her, but all of this was hard on me, and I needed some time alone to adjust first, before I could sit down with her.   
  
Nodding her head, she says, “Of course you would be exhausted. Let me show you to your room.”   
  
Turning, she began to walk towards a small narrow hallway that only had three doors, stopping at the first one on the left. Opening the door, she stepped to the side, allowing me to enter as she says to me, “This was your mother’s room.”   
  
The room was about the size of my walk-in closet back home, and with all my boxes of belongings that had arrived, there was only a small path that led to the twin-sized bed that sat beneath a small window. The room smelled of musk, telling me that the door had remained closed for many years, probably since the day that my mother had left here, as posters from my mother’s era still hung on the walls.   
  
“The bathroom is straight across the hall, and the towels are in the closet.” She then said, and I turned around, thanking her, not wanting her to see the state of cultural shock I was in.   
  
Thankfully, she didn’t linger, and I closed the door, before I moved to the small window, pulling the curtains back, opening it to air out the room. A light breeze carried the scent of fresh pine into my room, making the musky scent bearable, as I turned and looked at the stack of boxes, dreading the thought of going through them, but I knew that I had too.    
  
As I began to sort through the boxes, I noticed a small vanity with a cloudy mirror sitting against the wall behind them, making me move a few boxes out of the way so that I could get to it. It wasn’t the mirror that I was looking at but the pictures that were taped around the outer edge.   
  
Plucking one of the photos from the mirror, I stepped back to the middle of the room under the light, as I spotted my mother first in the middle of the picture as she posed with a man with his arm around her, and a group of her friends. As I stared at the man with his arm around her, I realized who that man in the photo was.   
  
“A friend, huh.” I said to myself, as the man in the photo was no other than Evan, telling me that my mother and him at one point in time were more than just friends, and it now made sense why he was so eager to help me. But it also made me wonder what had happened between them, for her to leave him behind, when she had left, with their picture still taped to the mirror.   
  


# Chapter3

1698 WordsRaven’s POV  
  
“Wake up.” echoed in my head, as I rolled onto my side, muttering half asleep, “Just a few more minutes,” Not wanting to get out of bed yet, because, for the first time in a long time, I was having a peaceful sleep.   
  
“I told you seven twenty.” I then heard his voice say, making me shoot straight up in bed, to find Chase standing at the foot of it.   
  
“What the hell are you doing in here?” I asked him, as I pulled my blanket up to cover myself, not wanting him to see me in my pink bunny pajamas, but by the look on his face, he had already gotten a sneak peek of them.  
  
With a devious grin now on his face, he says to me, “Your grandmother let me in.”  
  
“That doesn’t explain why you are in my room.”   
  
“Well, I wouldn’t be in your room, Princess, if you had been ready when I told you to be.” He now says to me, making me reach for my phone to check the time, but my dang phone was dead, which made no sense because it was plugged in.   
  
“I’m sorry. The outlet must not work.” I said to him, giving him an explanation of why I had slept in, as I pulled up the cord following it all the way back to the plug, where it remained plugged in.  
  
Under his breath, he says sarcastically, “I’m sure that’s not the only thing around here that doesn’t work.” As he turns towards my mother’s vanity, making me quickly move from the protection of my blanket, scurrying out of the bed, not wanting him to see the picture of my mother and his father together.   
  
Placing myself between him and my mother’s vanity, trying to block the mirror, was a chore in itself, as Chase’s massive structure consumed most of my tiny room. As I accidentally bump into him in the process of doing so, he takes a step back from me, as his eyes widen and darken at the same time, while he growls at me, “Don’t ever touch me again.”   
  
I don’t know if it was because I hadn’t had my morning coffee yet, or the fact that I had enough of his anger being taken out on me, but I couldn’t contain myself when I said back to him, “If you weren’t in my damn room taking up half of it then I wouldn’t have bumped into you.”   
  
What sounded like a growl comes from his lips, making me rethink if I should have gone off on him, as I take a step back, finding myself pinned between him and the vanity, while he takes a step towards me. My heart began to race in my chest, as I stared into his eyes, which looked like they were darkening by the second. His head slowly lowered towards me, and he took in a deep inhale, as if he was smelling me, while his eyes closed, making me wonder what the hell he was doing.   
  
My hands gripped tightly on the edge of the vanity, as he continued to invade my space, and if I was being honest with myself, my body was starting to react to his proximity to me. I would be lying to myself if I said I didn’t find him attractive, but this thing he had going on right now was sending me mixed signals. He wasn’t like any of the guys I had dated back in California, but he had this bad boy persona and a look that made my lady bits want to scream out for attention.  
  
He was now hovering over me, so closely that if I made a sudden move, our heads would collide, making me take a deep breath, as I dared not to move. The smell of cool mint now tickled my nose, while he took deep breaths, as if he was trying to get a grip on whatever this was he was doing.   
  
Slowly his eyes open, staring deep into my own, before he takes a step back from me, and I find myself leaving out a breath that I hadn’t realized I was holding, while my grip loosened on the vanity’s edge.  
  
“Get dressed Princess. We are going to be late.” He finally says to me, before he turns and just walks out of my room, leaving me to wonder what the hell just happened between us.   
  
Thankfully, I had showered last night, and had set out my clothes to wear today, because this was going to be the fastest I had ever gotten ready for school in my life.   
  
As I stepped out of my room, I spotted my grandmother sitting in a rocking chair with a huge smile on her face, making me wonder why she was so happy this morning, but she didn’t leave me wondering too long.  
  
“I remember when Evan used to come every morning to pick your mother up for school. He was so good to her. And now seeing Chase…” She began to say, but I quickly cut her off by saying, “It’s not like that.” Not wanting her to get her hopes up that there was something romantic going on between the two of us, because there wasn’t.  Plus, I honestly didn’t want to hear about what my mother did before my father.   
  
Not giving her a chance to say another word to me, I headed out the front door and stopped dead in my tracks when I spotted the blue jeep sitting in the driveway with the top down. “You have to be kidding me.” I thought to myself, as I willed myself to walk towards it, knowing that by the time we got to school my hair was going to be a tangled mess.   
  
Throwing my backpack in the backseat, I pulled the hair tie off my wrist, putting my hair in a low ponytail, before I got into the passenger seat. “Buckle up, Princess.” Chase said to me with a smirk on his face, as he took off down my grandmother’s lane, purposely hitting every single bump he could find, as I held on to whatever I could to steady myself.  
  
Reaching over, he turned the radio on, turning it up as loud as it could go, before he didn’t even pause to check for traffic, pulling out onto the road on I swear two wheels. It was clear that he was trying to make a statement about having to be my chauffeur, and that he wasn’t happy about it, but it wasn’t my doing, and if he kept this up, he was going to kill the both of us.  
  
Reaching over, I turned the radio off, before I said to him, “Are you trying to kill me?”  
  
He let out a damn chuckle as if he thought what I said was funny, before he turns his head to look at me and says, “If I wanted to kill you, I would have done it by now.”   
  
Before I could process his words, the sound of a car horn fills the air, and I quickly turn my head to see that his jeep was halfway over in the other lane, as a car was coming straight for us. Flashbacks of the night of the accident began to flash before my eyes, and I found myself bracing for impact, but the impact never came, as Chase turned the steering wheel just at the nick of time to avoid the car.   
  
My breathing at that moment became unsteady, and I began to find it hard to breathe, as I could feel one of my panic attacks coming on, that I started to have after the accident.   
  
“Pull over!” I screamed, as my hand reached for the door handle, wanting him to stop so I could get the hell out of his jeep.   
  
“What is wrong with you?” He asked as my door opened, while the jeep was still moving, but he quickly hit the brakes, slowing the jeep down, as he pulled off the side of the road.   
  
Quickly, I unbuckled my seat belt before jumping out, as I bent over trying to catch my breath, while I heard his car door shut.   
  
“Are you crazy?” He yells at me, as he walks around the front of the jeep, but when he sees me in my current state his tone changes, as he rushes to me, placing his hand on my back as he now asks me, “Are you okay?”   
  
Hell no, I wasn’t okay, and it was because of him and his reckless driving why I was in the state I was in now, and if he thought I wanted him to comfort me, he was dead wrong.   
  
Standing, I stepped away from him, as I said to him through gritted teeth, “Leave me the hell alone.” While I moved to his jeep, grabbing my backpack from the backseat before I threw it over my shoulders and began to walk away from him.   
  
“Raven, stop!” He called out to me, but instead of stopping, I raised my hand, flipping him off as I continued to walk.   
  
A low growl that sounded animalistic filled the air, making me stop dead in my tracks, as I looked towards the forest surrounding me, half scared of what was lurking in them.   
  
“Raven, get back in the jeep!” Chase now says with authority in his tone, making me wonder if he too had heard the growl.   
  
Once again, I found myself at a crossroads, of either getting eaten by a wild animal on my first morning here or getting back in the jeep with someone who clearly wasn’t mentally stable. Neither of my choices sounded good, but at least I knew with Chase, I wouldn’t have to worry about him having me for breakfast.   
  


# Chapter4

1547 WordsRaven’s POV  
  
Thankfully, Chase drove the rest of the drive to school at a normal speed, with both his hands on the wheel, while we rode in complete silence. After what he had just pulled, I really had nothing to say to him, and to be honest, I preferred the silent treatment we were both giving each other.   
  
Finally, after about a fifteen-minute drive, the school came into view, as I read the huge sign out front, “Welcome to Beaumont High School. Home of the Wolves.”   
  
I had never been so happy to see a school in my life, as I was at this moment, knowing that I would be out of this jeep and away from Chase, and the awkwardness that I was feeling right now being near him. After the stunt he pulled, he would be lucky if I ever got in a vehicle with him again, making me realize that I was going to have to find an alternate form of transportation home, because there was no way in hell I was getting back in his jeep with him today.  
  
As he pulled his jeep into a parking place, I didn’t even wait for him to turn it off, before I got out, grabbed my bag, and headed straight towards the double doors. But before I reached the doors, I heard someone yell, “Chase.” Making me turn to see a beautiful blonde-haired girl running over to him, planting a kiss on his lips.  
  
Of course, he had a girlfriend, as it all now made sense why he didn’t want me touching him, but it didn’t dismiss his erratic behavior this morning. His eyes at that moment moved towards me, as if he could sense I was watching him. Quickly, I turned away, moving inside the school, out of his sight and straight to the office to get my schedule.   
  
“Raven, Mrs. Jacobs is ready to see you.” The school secretary said, motioning to a door to her right that read, “Principal’s Office.”  
  
“Raven Knight, your transcripts are very impressive. President of the Student Council, Vice President of the Honor Society, Captain of the Cheering Squad, and early acceptance to Berkeley. Your parents must have been proud of you.” Principal Jacobs says to me, making me try not to think back to how happy my parents were when my acceptance letter came from Berkeley, but it was too late, and I couldn’t get the memories out of my head.   
  
I remember arriving home from school to find both my parents just sitting at the dinner table. At first, I thought something was terribly wrong, but then my mother pushed the letter towards me on the table, and I quickly opened it. I began to read the letter out loud, and when I came to the part where it said, “You have been accepted.” Both my parents jumped out of their chairs with joy.   
  
That night, my parents took me out to dinner to celebrate, and after that, we drove down to the boardwalk to my favorite ice cream emporium. We planted our toes in the sand and watched the sunset on the beach, as it was our last night together as a family.  
  
“I see your request for certain courses, but unfortunately, we are a small school, and we can only accommodate you with what we have available.” She then said, drawing my attention back to her, as I realized what she was saying.  
  
“But I need to stay on course, if I want my acceptance to be honored when I graduate.” I explained to her how important these certain courses were, hoping there was something that she could do to keep me on track.   
  
“I personally called Berkeley and explained your rare circumstances to them, and they were very accommodating to your situation.” She then said as she handed me a schedule of my new classes, along with a paper from Berkeley for an online college course that I would have to take along with my classes here.   
  
“As for your extracurricular activities, try-outs for the cheerleading squad are this Friday. Unfortunately, student council positions have already been filled, and we don’t have an Honor Society here.” She then told me, and I quickly said back to her, “Can’t I just focus on my studies?” As I dreaded the thought of having to join the cheerleading squad with a bunch of girls I didn’t know.  
  
“Unfortunately, if you want to go to Berkeley, you will need to maintain not only your academics but your extracurricular activities too. Listen, Raven, I know this is hard on you. I can’t even imagine what you have gone through, but if this is truly what you want, then you have to move on, and focus on your future. I am sure your parents would want this for you.”  
  
She was right. My parents would want me to succeed in life, especially my mother. She had told me time and time again that my education was the key to making something of myself, and if I wanted to get out of this godforsaken town like she did, then I was going to have to do whatever it took to do it.   
  
Just then, the door to the office opened, and I heard a voice say, “You wanted to see me, mother.”  
  
My head turned as the voice sounded somewhat familiar to me, to see the beautiful blonde-haired girl that had run up to Chase when we had arrived at school.  
  
“You are right on time, sweetheart. Jessica, this is Raven. She just transferred here from California, and I would like you to show her around the school.”   
  
Of all the students in this school, what were the chances that Jessica here was the principal’s daughter, and that she would be my welcoming committee? Dread at that moment filled me, as Jessica glared at me, while it was clear that she too wasn’t excited about having to babysit the new girl, especially when the new girl showed up this morning with her boyfriend.   
  
As if Jessica was playing a role to win an Oscar, she plastered a smile on her face, one that I could see clearly was fake, as she says to her mother, “I would be delighted to show her around, and explain the ropes to her.” And by ropes, I knew what she meant.  
  
As the two of us walked out of her mother’s office and into the now vacant hallways of the school, Jessica turned to look at me, before she said, “Let’s get one thing clear, Chase is mine. You stay in your lane, and we won’t have a problem. Capeesh?”   
  
“I’m not interested in Chase, or any boy here for that matter. I just want to make it through the school year and get the hell out of this town and back to civilization.” I explained my position to her, wanting her to know where I stood, and that I had no plans on interfering with her relationship with Chase.   
  
The last thing I needed on my first day at school was to make enemies with the principal’s daughter, who held all my playing cards in her hands, to make sure that the dreams I worked so hard for remained my reality.   
  
“Good, because you don’t belong here anyhow.” She then said, reminding me of the obvious, as she turned and began her tour of the school, like nothing was ever said between the two of us, making me believe that she wasn’t wrapped too tightly.   
  
Thankfully, the school wasn’t large, and her grand tour only took about ten minutes before she came to a stop in front of a classroom. “Your first period class.”   
  
“Thanks.” I said sarcastically to her, as I reached for the door handle, thankful that my time with her was over with, but then she grabbed a hold of my arm firmly, stopping me, making me turn my head to look at her.   
  
I could have sworn her eyes darkened a few shades, just like Chase had with me this morning in my room, making me wonder what the hell was in the water here. “Don’t forget what I said.”   
  
“Trust me, I won’t.” I said quickly back to her through gritted teeth, as her grip was becoming painful on my arm.   
  
“Good.” She said as a smirk formed on her face, before she released my arm, and started walking down the hallway, humming some damn song, as I rubbed my arm, trying to relieve the pain she had just caused.  
  
Jesus, this girl was nuts. Maybe she should be the one medicated and not me, I thought to myself, as I watched her head into a classroom, before I turned back to my own, thinking could today, get any worse. But as I finally walked into my own classroom, I realized that it could, as my eyes immediately landed on Chase, sitting in the only seat with an empty desk beside him.

1mj7yuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1mj7yuq/thoughts_that_arent_me_and_a_panic_attack_that/,Thoughts That Aren’t Me… and a Panic Attack That Changed My Life,"I'm a guy in my twenties, and not long ago, something happened that completely shook me.

I had two cups of coffee and an energy drink, and out of nowhere, my heart started pounding — it hit 145 bpm. I couldn’t breathe properly, felt dizzy, had this choking feeling, and was convinced I was going to die. I was rushed to the ER. They ran tests, did an ECG, and told me everything was fine physically.

But the thing is, ever since that day… I haven’t felt normal.

I haven’t had another full-blown panic attack, but I’ve been stuck in this weird, exhausting state:

Tightness in my chest

Constant fatigue

Feeling emotionally numb

And this lingering fear that it could all happen again


It’s like I’m living in my body but not really living. I feel disconnected from myself, like there’s a fog over everything.
My daily life feels empty and dull. I finished my studies recently, but I still don’t know what I want to do. I feel lost. On top of that, I sense pressure from my family . they see me differently because I didn’t take the same path as my siblings. I can’t help but feel like I let them down.

And then something else started happening:


 I keep getting intrusive thoughts — things that don’t even make sense to me

Whenever I hear a word like “suicide” or “madness”, my mind grabs onto it and won’t let go. I start overthinking and freaking out, even though I know deep down these thoughts aren’t me. I’m not suicidal. I’m not going crazy.
But the thoughts still come… and they scare me.

They don’t reflect who I am. But they trap me in this loop of fear. It’s like my brain is constantly searching for danger .even if it’s imaginary. It leaves me feeling isolated, tired, and stuck inside my own head.

I try to stay strong, but I’m really worn out.


 What I want .more than anything . is just to feel like myself again.

To wake up without this fear in my chest

To feel connected again .to my life, to my emotions

To stop feeling like I’m fighting a silent war inside

And just live a simple, peaceful life",5,1754494596.0,Anxiety,4,0.86,False

1mj7yl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mj7yl5/could_shardor_km802_hot_iced_coffee_maker_review/,Could SHARDOR KM802 Hot & Iced Coffee Maker Review Change Your Morning Routine?,"The SHARDOR KM-802B Hot & Iced Coffee Maker has been my go-to brewing companion for the past few weeks, and I've certainly put it through its paces. For someone as caffeine-dependant as I am, owning a coffee machine that balances versatility, ease of use, and compact design is critical. This machine caters to hot coffee lovers and iced coffee enthusiasts alike, a double feature I found immensely appealing.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
At first glance, its glossy black finish and modern style fit seamlessly into my kitchen aesthetic without becoming an eyesore on the counter. The dimensions (11.46” D x 11.93” W x 5.28” H) make it ideal for smaller spaces, ensuring it doesn’t hog valuable real estate. Weighing only 4.86 pounds, it’s also relatively light, making it easy to move when I stubbornly rearrange my kitchen every few weeks. The removable drip tray is a clever touch, accommodating taller cups or travel mugs up to 6.8''. That said, cleaning this part isn’t as straightforward as I would have liked, but more on that later.  

**Performance and Brewing Modes**  
I immediately appreciated the versatility of this machine. The bold setting gives you adjustable flavor strengths—you can pick between a standard or stronger option. I tested both settings, and the difference is noticeable without being too overpowering. Whether brewing a comforting iced coffee on a sunny afternoon or a steaming cup to kickstart chilly mornings, the machine delivered with each beverage taking roughly a minute to brew.  

[Check SHARDOR KM-802B price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0drfzq8cn/)  

**Compatibility and Convenience**  
One standout feature is its 3-in-1 compatibility with K-cups, ground coffee, and even tea. I tried all three (yes, even tea—don't judge), and the results were consistently good. The K-cup holder and reusable basket filter included in the package make switching between coffee input types simple. As an iced coffee enthusiast, the fact that I could rapidly switch over to iced coffee without losing flavor was a pleasant surprise.  

The 52 oz removable water reservoir is another star feature. It means fewer trips to the sink for refills while allowing me to brew several cups in one go. This is a lifesaver, especially when hosting friends with varying coffee preferences. Speaking of options, the machine also offers multiple brewing capacities—6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 oz. Tap the capacity based on your cup size or coffee need, and voilà!  

**Energy Efficiency**  
I respect any device that can help keep my energy bills somewhat reasonable. The auto-off function shuts off the coffee maker five minutes after the last brew. I’m forgetful on most days, so machines that don’t rely on my impeccable memory get bonus points.  

**Advantages**  
- Adjustable brewing strengths ensure a tailored coffee experience.  
- Compact footprint and attractive design enhance any kitchen.  
- 3-in-1 compatibility caters to K-cup, ground coffee, and tea enthusiasts.  
- Multiple brewing capacities offer flexibility for different occasions.  

**Disadvantages**  
- Cleaning the removable drip tray and filters requires extra effort.  
- While the iced coffee feature is great, it took a couple of tries to perfect the strength for my taste.  
- The machine can feel slightly louder during use than expected.  

**Competitive Options**  
Comparing the KM-802B to similar products like the Keurig K-Mini or the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, the SHARDOR stands out for its combination of features and brewing modes. The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew does share the ability to work with both K-cups and loose grounds, but it lacks the built-in iced coffee functionality. Keurig K-Mini, while compact and sleek for small spaces, doesn’t include a reusable filter or the adjustable strength settings that the SHARDOR offers. That’s where the KM-802B edges out—it provides more features per square inch while maintaining reliability.  

**Smart Spending**  
From a financial perspective, this coffee maker hits a sweet spot between affordability and functionality. It's neither the priciest nor the cheapest option on the market, yet it manages to blend affordability with a solid build and versatile features. Machines emphasizing additional brewing styles often cost significantly more, and the reusable filter alone saves a decent chunk of change over time.

1mj7xwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1mj7xwu/theres_something_in_her_voice/,There’s Something in Her Voice,"I work nights at a suicide prevention hotline. It’s a crummy office, flickering lights & the smell of old coffee. Most calls are rough, people crying or scared, spilling their guts. You get used to it, let their pain roll off you. But last winter, one call messed me up. That voice, or whatever it was, still messes with my head. I hear it in my dreams, creepy & cold, like it’s stuck in my skull.

It was 3:12 AM when my phone rang. No caller ID, just this freaky static buzzing, kinda like a pulse. I fumbled with my headset, the cheap thing squeaking against my ear. “Hope Line, how can I help?” I said, voice shaky.

Nothing. Just heavy silence, like the air was too thick to breathe.

“Hey, you there?” I asked, trying to sound calm. “You in trouble or something?”

A crackle cut through, loud & harsh like something breaking.

“Do you believe in possession?” Her voice sounded wrong, all rough & scratchy, like she was choking on something awful.

I got chills, my stomach twisting with this heavy, sick feeling. The office lights were humming, & I could’ve sworn the shadows moved a little.

“Huh?” I mumbled, squeezing the headset until my hands hurt.

“I’m not alone,” she hissed, her words sharp & nasty. “It’s in my mouth. When I talk, it shifts. It’s taking my words, my breath, everything.”

My heart was pounding like crazy in my chest. All of my training taught me to keep her on the line, to talk her down. But something in me was yelling to hang up before it knew I was there.

“I tried to end myself,” she said softly, her voice all shaky & thin. “Not to end my life, to stop it. The pills didn’t work. It pulled me back, laughing in my head.”

My mouth felt like sand. “What’s your name? You safe right now?”

She laughed, this nasty, wet noise, like it wasn’t even human. It made my gut twist & my ears buzz.

“It’s awake,” she said, her voice all thick & weird, like she was choking on something. “It smells you. It’s watching.”

Then this clicking started, like teeth on bone, steady & hungry. I tried to hang up, but my hand just wouldn’t budge, like something was holding it.

“It likes you,” she growled. The clicking got faster, like nails tapping a coffin lid. Then she started saying my words back to me, a second later, all twisted & wrong, like she was stealing them.

I stopped talking. The line went quiet, heavy with menace.

“I’m not her anymore,” the voice said. It wasn’t hers. “She’s trapped beneath me, screaming in the dark.”

I slammed the phone down, my heart going nuts. Just a prank, I told myself, but my hands shook so bad I could barely log the call. The office felt freezing, the shadows too sharp.

It wasn’t a prank. The calls kept coming, different numbers, different women, always at 3:12 AM. Same words, same clicking, same awful voice. I stopped telling my boss after she said I was just tired. I started dreading my shifts, checking the clock like it was gonna bite me.

Sometimes, that voice said my words before I did, like it was inside my skull, messing with my thoughts. I’d catch myself saying its phrases in the bathroom, my voice sounding off, too rough.

Last night, another call came. New voice, quiet & scared. No hello, just one line in that horrible rasp:

“I’m not inside her anymore.”

The line cut out. I looked at my reflection in the monitor, & my mouth looked wrong. Something moved behind my teeth, wet & squirming, saying my name. I tried to yell, but my voice came out like hers, all sharp & wrong. The phone rang again. I didn’t touch it, but my hand started moving toward it, like it wasn’t mine.

This morning, I called in sick. The clicking’s in my apartment now, tapping in the walls, hungry. When I talk, my words come out wrong, mixed with hers. I unplugged my phone, but it keeps ringing. I don’t know how to stop it. I’m scared I’m not me anymore.",2,1754494538.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

1mj7ugb,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeardAndTested/comments/1mj7ugb/delve_into_whether_the_best_toaster_oven_comfee/,Delve Into Whether the Best Toaster Oven COMFEE Truly Delivers,"The COMFEE' CO-B08AA(BK) toaster oven might look compact at first glance, but don’t be fooled by its size. I’ve spent the past few weeks using it on an almost daily basis, and I’ve grown to appreciate its versatility. Being someone who lacks the luxury of a large kitchen, this countertop toaster oven has been a lifesaver. It takes up minimal space but still delivers a punch in the features department.

**Sleek and Compact Design**

I’m genuinely impressed by how this mini toaster oven fits seamlessly into my tiny kitchen setup. Its black color gives it a modern look, and it doesn’t scream for attention, which is great when you’ve got limited counter space to begin with. Despite its small footprint (9.29""D x 14.33""W x 7.68""H to be precise), it has enough interior space to toast bread, bake small pizzas, and roast chicken wings. Honestly, the size is ideal for single-person households, dorm rooms, or even as an additional appliance in bigger kitchens.

**Cooking Performance**

This compact appliance packs 1000W of firepower alongside dual heating tubes. I’ve tried baking everything from frozen pizzas to kabobs, and the results haven’t disappointed. The 160 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit temperature range gives you the flexibility to toast, bake, or broil without hassle. The crust on my pizzas comes out perfectly crisp, and my kabobs have that golden finish every time.

[Grab COMFEE' CO-B08AA(BK) at the best price on Amazon.](https://cookarte.com/p/b0924cnfv8/)

**Ease of Use**

What makes this toaster oven stand out is its simplicity. With just two knobs, temperature and time, you’re in control without the frustration of overly complicated buttons or displays. The knobs are smooth to turn and offer precise settings. For someone with not-so-great eyesight (or those mornings when I haven’t had my coffee), this straightforward design is a win. The built-in timer goes up to 60 minutes, which is more than enough for most quick recipes.

**Good Aspects**

- Perfect size for small kitchens or spaces.
- Dual heating tubes contribute to even cooking.
- Functions include bake, broil, and toast, adding variety.
- Simple knob controls minimize confusion.
- Includes a crumb tray for easier cleaning.

**Potential Drawbacks**

- Limited capacity—might not suit larger households.
- The exterior can get quite hot during extended use.
- No convection function, which some competitors include.
- Lack of additional accessories like multiple racks or pans.

**Safety and Cleaning Features**

There’s a nifty design detail where the lower baking tray pushes out slightly when you open the door. It’s a subtle but effective feature, making it safer to grab hot food without burning your fingers. The removable crumb tray is another highlight. As someone who hates scrubbing burnt bits out of tight corners, I really appreciate this addition. One quick pull, and cleaning’s done.

**Competing Products**

When it comes to toaster ovens in a similar size range, the Panasonic FlashXpress and BLACK+DECKER TO1760SS come to mind. The Panasonic model excels in fast heating and includes advanced sensor technology but costs a lot more. Meanwhile, the BLACK+DECKER variant has a better interior capacity but lacks the polished safety features like the COMFEE' CO-B08AA(BK). Where COMFEE’ shines is its balance of affordability, performance, and compact design.

**Bang for the Buck**

Considering the features it offers, this toaster oven is solid proof that you don’t need to splurge to get great results. It’s not going to replace a full-sized oven, but it’s not trying to. What it does, it does well—perfectly toasting bread, reheating leftovers, or baking small dishes. If you’re working within a budget and don’t need superfluous options, this toaster oven delivers excellent value for its cost.

The Mecity KC3002 coffee maker has been a delightful addition to my kitchen. As someone who needs that first cup of coffee to kickstart my day, I appreciated the fact that this sleek and compact coffee machine is not only visually appealing with its pink color but also incredibly functional for its size. Described as a ""3-in-1 Coffee Maker,"" I immediately put its compatibility with K-cups, ground coffee, and even loose tea to the test. Spoiler alert: it handles them beautifully. It’s not every day you find something this small that can deliver big on versatility.

**Performance and Brewing Speed**

The advertised “2 Minute Instant Brewing” claim isn’t just marketing fluff; I timed it. Within two minutes, the Mecity KC3002 brewed a piping hot cup of coffee. For those rushed mornings or mid-day caffeine cravings, this quick performance is a game-changer. Whether I used a K-cup or ground coffee, the brew temperature stayed consistent, delivering a satisfying cup with a taste as good as machines double its size. I’m typically skeptical of compact machines meeting high brewing standards, but this one surprised me.  

[Want the lowest Mecity KC3002 price? Click Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b0cqxmtv4z/)  

**Good Aspects**

- Achieves brewing in just under two minutes.  
- Compatible with K-cups, ground coffee, and even loose tea.  
- The compact design is great for small kitchens, RVs, or dorm rooms.  
- Easy-to-use one-button touch operation simplifies brewing.  

**Build and Space-Saving Design**

At only 11 inches tall and 4.7 inches wide, this coffee maker is the definition of compact. It hardly takes up any counter space, leaving my kitchen less cluttered. Despite its small footprint, the machine’s construction feels solid. It’s lightweight, making it ideal for those who plan to take it traveling or use it in tiny living spaces like RVs or studio apartments. The dimensions mean it’s easy to tuck away when not in use, but its pretty pink finish makes it something you’ll want to leave out for display.

**Ease of Use and Cleaning**

Operating this machine is refreshingly straightforward. A single button controls everything, whether you want to start brewing, pause, or even enter descale mode. The auto shut-off function means you don’t have to hover around, worrying about whether you left it on. Cleaning is another area where this coffee maker excels. Unlike some machines that splash grounds everywhere, this model’s specially designed filter holder keeps the brewing chamber relatively mess-free. 

Descaling was also simple; holding down the button for three seconds activates the mode. It’s a thoughtful feature, requiring only minimal effort to prolong the life of the machine. There’s no denying that the effort invested in its design makes everyday use as hassle-free as possible.

**Limitations**

- The water reservoir is not as large as some bigger coffee machines, meaning frequent refills.  
- Limited water level options—while you can customize the amount to some degree, it’s not as flexible as a higher-end machine.  
- The brewing of loose tea isn’t always as rich in flavor as a dedicated tea infuser.  

**Competing Products**

In comparison to other machines in its category—like the Keurig K-Mini or the Black+Decker Single Serve Maker—Mecity KC3002 holds its ground quite admirably. The Keurig K-Mini, for example, is similarly compact and fast in brewing, but it’s tied primarily to K-cups unless you buy additional accessories. On the other hand, the Mecity coffee machine comes ready to brew ground coffee and tea without requiring extra purchases. However, Keurig takes the edge when it comes to brand reputation and broader availability. Other models like Black+Decker’s single-serve brewers are often cheaper but lack the finesse and decent build of this Mecity product, leaving often-smudged coffee countertops in their wake.  

Where this machine outshines both competitors is with its quick brewing speed and added tea brewing compatibility, making it a more versatile option if you like switching between different beverages. However, if you’re all-in for coffee and need an extensive reservoir for back-to-back cups, competing models might appeal more to heavy users.

**Smart Spending**

Considering its functionality, durable build quality, and compact design, the Mecity KC3002 coffee maker offers excellent value for small households or solo users. While you won’t get premium features like a massive water tank or app connectivity, the essential features are executed with care and precision. Factor in the three-in-one brewing capability, and it feels well worth the asking price. For those on a budget, it packs enough versatility to sidestep the need for separate machines for coffee and tea.

I'm a 20-year-old industrial design student with some (novice) background in photography. I also took a semester-long product photography course at school.

For projects, I usually use the department kit - Canon 850D bodies with kit zoom lenses, Manfrotto MK055XPRO3 tripods, Godox SL60 constant lights, and Aputure lightboxes and RGB panels. The lighting and tripods are great, but the cameras - especially the lenses - feel really limiting in terms of depth of field and overall image quality. It's good enough for weekly documentation, but not much beyond that.

I spoke with our photography professor since I want to take one of my projects to MVP/competition level, and I feel it’s time to invest in a more proper camera and lens kit of my own.

I’ve capped my budget at around $500–$700 for a second-hand body and a good 50mm (or equivalent) prime lens. Since I already have access to great studio gear and space at school, I want to put all of that budget into the camera kit, which I’ll also use in my free time.

Main use cases:

Medium-to-large product shots (binoculars, lamps, coffee machines, chairs, etc.)

Studio work, manual settings+focus with one reflected light source or light painting, I have also been playing with focus stacking, and I would like to have a camera which can perform it in body 

Process documentation - so decent handheld low-light performance is a must

Video is a nice bonus, but not essential (my phone is good enough for basic documentation)

Aside from school, I’d really like to use the camera in my free time — ideally for hobby photography and also to take with me on bike rides to shoot stuff on the go.

Used options I’m currently seeing around my area:

* Fujifilm X-H1 + grip – $550
* Nikon D810 – $500–$600 (body only)
* Nikon D750 – $700 (body only – feels a bit much for what it is?)
* Nikon Z6 (mk1) + Sigma Art 24-70 f/2.8 + 7Artisans 35 f/1.2 + FTZ adapter – $900 (a bit over budget, but tempting)
* Canon 5D mkIII – $450 (body only, low shutter count, a 13-year-old body, but does it hold up for studio settings)

Would love to hear thoughts on these or other suggestions. I care a lot about sharpness, color, and DOF control. Reliability also matters, since I’ll be using it pretty often.

It’s worse. I’m drowning.,"Hi. I just need to vent. I (F28) grew up with two narcissistic parents. My dad was a diagnosed psychopath. I survived 18 years in hell with them until  luckly they both passed away. I thought I’d finally be free, start healing, build peace, a family.. 

But then, over a year ago, my 84 y.o. grandmother (NMOM’s mom) was kicked out of a house she had built on my uncle’s land ...  no papers, no rights. She had no one else, and I felt bad, my husband too. I'm very empathetic, I always try to see the good in people, yk? So I brought her to live with me. Big mistake. It’s like NMOM 2.0 ultra power.

She criticizes me constantly, questions everything I do like I’m some dumb little girl, makes sarcastic comments, always trying to “catch” me not knowing how to do basic things  like turning on the coffee maker or cooking  just to prove I’m useless or incapable.

Today something happened that left me shaking for hours:

* Woke up at 6am, couldn’t go back to sleep
* Waited enjoying silence for my alarm at 7:40am, showered, did my routine
* At 8:40am I was rushing to leave, and she stops me just to tell a long story about how she woke up at 3am and she's suffering constantly and nobody listens to her... 
* At 8:55am, im at work and realized we forgot the house keys. Had to go back. 
* 9:10am, rang the doorbell.. no answer. Called her .. no answer. Looked through the backyard glass door was shut (she always leaves it open for my dogs)
* 9:20am, I ended up *climbing over a moldy wall*, fell into the wet grass (where my dogs pee/poop), got all dirty, the smell. god. 
* Found my keys, left. Texted her to let her know i was home.
* 9:45am, already 45 mins late to work, got a voice note from her scolding me: “I heard the dogs barking and the door, you should’ve come upstairs to talk to me before leaving.” . BRO. WHY DIDNT YOU OPENED THE DOOR IF YOU KNEW I WAS KNOKING THE FKING DOOR.

I snapped. I told her:

Hi all I got 20 Milgard windows all with low-E put in. I knew about the greenish tinge from reddit and Houzz thru online photos before getting them but I thought it was alright when I looked thru it and didn't think much of it until I looked back in the photos I took of house progress. They all show green tinge on the floor when sun shining thru it. House isn't done for another long while so I haven't stayed long enough to see for myself if it's showing the green tinge on the walls too? Dry wall isn't up yet and I gotta pick wall colors soon and I'm not sure how that green will affect whatever color I pick like Swiss coffee or white dove or wythe blue. Can someone living with the similar windows lemme know if it casts green shadow onto walls at sunset? I put hella windows in those rooms I was imagining dreamy relaxing time now I'm not sure!

And honestly, it’s disappointing when the owners themselves don’t bother to properly train their baristas.

1mj7ils,https://i.redd.it/3z4qv0k82fhf1.jpeg,Pen Pal FULL NOVEL READ,"Chapter 10
I found the letter in the mailbox this time. No mystery appearances on the kitchen table, but still a big mystery about why it came in the first place.
Because I don’t know this guy.
Mr. Mysterious ignored my threat to turn his letters over to the detective, so he either thinks I’m bluffing or he doesn’t care.
I stand in the kitchen under the flickering light and read the letter again. The verse means nothing to me. Not that it should, because it originated from the mind of a lunatic.
I wish I could tell Michael about this. What a laugh we’d have. Right before he called the police.
I know that’s what I should do, but I’m absolutely exhausted. Maybe in the morning I’ll have the strength to pick up the phone and tell a nice police dispatcher that I have a crazy pen pal and could they please go over to the prison and tell him to stop writing me letters, but for now, all I want to do is sleep.
Sleep and forget about Aidan Leighrite and his sorcery.
I’ve still got adrenaline coursing through my veins from that chance meeting. The way he looked at me. The things he said .
“My plan is to get you naked and find out how you sound when you come.”
To my eternal disbelief, I actually considered his offer for a moment.
It was shock. It had to be. In my normal state of mind, I’d have smacked that guy right across the face, barged out of the bar, and filed a complaint about him with the Better Business Bureau. Who talks to a customer like that?
A former customer, but still.
Actually, did I ever technically hire him? We negotiated pricing, but I didn’t sign any kind of contract. It didn’t get that far. I threw him out of my house first.
Oh God, who cares? This is all too much for me.
I make sure all the doors are locked and the drapes are drawn. Then I go upstairs, put the letter with the others in my underwear drawer, and go to bed.
I fall asleep within minutes, but in the middle of the night, something wakes me.
Groggy, I lie in bed listening into the dark. It’s stormy again, and the wind is blowing. Rain peppers the roof. A tree branch scrapes against a windowpane somewhere downstairs.
No, that wasn’t a tree branch. It was a floorboard creaking.
It sounds like someone’s creeping up the stairs.
I sit bolt upright in bed, my heart hammering. I listen hard, trying to hear over the crashing of my pulse, but the sound doesn’t come again.
Did I imagine it? Or is someone in the house?
I try not to panic. I try to be logical. The house is old and makes all kinds of odd noises, especially when there’s a storm. Things are blowing around in the yard…maybe the sound was a lawn chair toppling over. Or a draft sighing through the living room curtains. Or a total figment of my imagination, seeing how I’m still adjusting to sleeping alone.
All those things make complete sense until the floorboard creaks again and I have to stifle a scream.
I leap from bed, run to the door, and lock it. Heart pounding, I grab the flashlight from under the bathroom sink. It’s big, heavy, and the only thing I can think of to use as a weapon. Then I crouch down on the side of the bed opposite the door and sit there, shaking and hyperventilating, clutching the flashlight like a baseball bat.
I don’t know how long I huddle like that before I decide I’m being silly.
If someone broke into the house, I’d have heard a window smash or a door being kicked in. I’d have heard more footsteps, not just a few groaning boards, because the stairs creak with every step. I’m just being paranoid.
That has to be it.
The alternative is too terrifying.
I stand, wincing when my thighs cramp. I go to the door, put my ear against it, and listen. I hear nothing more than the rain on the roof. I decide to put on some clothes and quickly change out of my nightgown into jeans and a shirt.
Then, with the flashlight in hand but not on, I carefully open the bedroom door and peer out.
The hallway is pitch-black. It’s a moonless night, and the cloud cover is thick. I listen into the darkness for a moment, then tiptoe down the hall in my bare feet and look over the railing to the living room below.
It’s dark down there, too. Dark and silent. Nothing moves.
Then my skin starts to crawl because I have the creepiest feeling I’m being watched.
Get out of the house!
It’s not even a coherent thought. It’s more like a subliminal thing, as if the ancient part of my brain screamed a warning at me.
With my heart in my throat and my hands shaking, I make my way down the stairs as quickly and silently as I can. I grab the car keys off the console table in the foyer and run out of the house in a full-blown panic, not even bothering to bring my purse.
Ten minutes later, I’m pounding on Aidan’s door.
He opens up wearing nothing but a pair of faded jeans that hang low on his hips. His hair is mussed, his stomach is flat, his chest is covered in tattoos.
He’s fucking magnificent.
The horrible thought that he’s not alone flashes through my brain, right before I blurt, “I’m so sorry to disturb you. I’m going now.”
He grabs me by the arm and pulls me inside before I can run away.
Closing the door behind me, he demands, “What’s wrong? What happened?”
My teeth start to chatter. This is when I realize I’m soaking wet, because I ran out of the house into the rain without a coat on. Or shoes, for that matter.
Or underwear.
I cross my arms over my chest in an attempt to hide my breasts under the thin T-shirt I’m wearing. “I th-thought s-someone broke into my h-house.”
His dark brows pull together. “So you came here?”
I’m a moron. I’m the stupidest person to ever walk the face of the earth. For the safety of the rest of humanity, I should be locked away in a government-operated facility for the rest of time.
He must see the distress on my face, because he says gently, “That wasn’t a reproach.”
I make a mental note that this hot roofer has a good vocabulary, but get distracted when he adds, “You’re wet.”
His gaze moves slowly down my body, taking in my soaked clothing and my bare feet. It travels back up again, getting snagged on my lips before finally settling on my eyes.
His voice husky, he says, “Let’s get you warm. Then you can tell me what happened.”
He leads me inside by the elbow, sits me down at his kitchen table, and disappears into another room. For a towel, I suppose, though he could be calling the cops to tell them to pick up the crazy lady who just showed up soaking wet on his doorstep in the middle of the night.
Shivering, I look around.
His place is small but tidy. The kitchen and living room are next to each other in an open-concept design. The space is visually separated by a set of open bookcases, with a sofa and chairs on the other side along with the TV and a coffee table. Down the hallway where he disappeared must be the bedrooms.
I’m surprised how clean and neat it is, considering a bachelor lives here. There aren’t even any dirty dishes in the sink.
He returns with a fluffy white towel in his hands and commands, “Stand up.”
Though I usually get grouchy when someone barks orders at me, I obey without protesting. He wraps the towel around my back and shoulders and starts to rub my arms with it.
Without looking at my face, he says, “Don’t be embarrassed.”
“Easy for you to say. You’re not the wet idiot standing in a stranger’s kitchen at one o’clock in the morning.”
“I’m not a stranger, remember? And you’re not an idiot.”
He seems irritated that I called myself that. Or maybe his irritation has to do with my unexpected arrival, which would make a lot more sense. The poor man has to go to work in the morning, and now he’s got a soaking psychopath to deal with.
He pulls the towel up over my head and starts blotting the rain from my hair.
My face flaming, I say miserably, “I think I might be dying of humiliation.”
“You’re not dying of anything. Be quiet and let me do this.”
I close my eyes and stand there wondering how a person would know if they lost their mind. But I force myself to stop thinking about it because the signs of insanity probably include imagining the rain is a burglar and fleeing for help to the home of the roofer you fired and turned down for sex.
In a conversational tone, Aidan says, “We’re gonna have a discussion later about why you chose me to come to when you were scared, but in the meantime, walk me through what happened.”
I’m too chicken to look at him while I talk, so I keep my eyes shut and tell him everything. When I’m done, he says, “You don’t have a security alarm?”
“No.”
“We’ll fix that tomorrow.”
I finally get the courage to look at him. His expression is a nice combination of amusement and concern. Those dark eyes of his are warm, but his brows are still drawn down.
Resisting the urge to reach up and pet his beard, I say, “What do you mean?”
“You know what I mean. And you’re still shivering.”
“I can’t help it. I’m freezing.”
He stops rubbing my head with the towel. “I’m gonna say something now. Don’t freak out.”
“You should’ve just said it. Now I have to freak out.”
“You need to change into dry clothes.”
I frown at him. “Why would that freak me out?”
“Because the dry clothes you’re gonna change into are mine.”
We stand a foot apart, me shivering with cold, him smoldering with heat, until I say, “I doubt you have anything that would fit me.”
He smiles. “Look at you, not freaking out at all.”
“Oh, I am. But I’ve done enough weird things for one night, so I’m keeping it on the inside.”
“Come with me.”
He leads me by the hand out of the kitchen and down the hallway into his bedroom. While he goes into his closet and turns on the light, I stare at his bed, which consists of one pillow and a blanket on top of a mattress laid out right on the floor. The only other things in the room are a simple wood dresser on one wall and a bookcase stuffed with books on the other.
“Yeah, I know. Super deluxe. Here.”
He’s back, holding out a black sweatshirt so large, I could wear it to dinner with a belt and heels and be well dressed.
I take it from him and clutch it to my chest like a security blanket. The towel is still draped around my head and shoulders. I’m still shaking with cold.
I feel utterly ridiculous.
“Aidan?”
“Yes, Kayla?”
“I’m really sorry about this. I promise I’m not a giant basket case. I’m just a little one.”
Looking very serious, he strokes a strand of damp hair off my cheek. He murmurs, “You’re not anything but beautiful.” After a pause, he adds, “You don’t have to freak out about that, either. I don’t try to seduce traumatized women who run in from the rain.”
“Okay. Thanks for that. Um…do you possibly have a pair of sweatpants I could wear with this?”
“You’d be swimming in them.”
“I know, but…”
“But what?”
I take a deep breath and say it. “I’ll be extremely self-conscious if my coochie is hanging out.”
He blinks in confusion.
“I don’t have any underwear on.”
“Oh. Oh. ”
“Yes. So.”
“Wait. You came over here with no underwear on?”
“I promise it wasn’t premeditated.”
When he lifts a brow, I sigh. “I got dressed in a panic. I didn’t have time for panties.”
“Or a bra, either,” he says, his voice lower.
I wince. “You noticed.”
“Are you fucking kidding me? Of course I noticed.” He pauses. “I also noticed that your cheeks get really red when you’re embarrassed.”
I say drily, “Thanks for the info. Are you giving me sweats or not?”
“I don’t own a pair of sweatpants.”
“Oh.”
“I can put your jeans in the dryer, though.” When I don’t say anything, he adds, “Or we can just stand here and stare at each other. I’m good with that, too.”
“Why?”
After a beat, he says quietly, “I like looking at you.”
There’s a funny sensation inside my chest. Like a tightening, but also a loosening at the same time. I’m pretty sure it means I’m about to do something I’ll regret.
I shrug my shoulders and let the towel drop to the floor. Then I pull my wet shirt over my head and stand naked from the waist up in front of Aidan.
His gaze drops to my chest. His lips part. His pupils dilate. He remains perfectly still as he gazes at my bare breasts with burning eyes.
I whisper, “I want you to do more than look.”
In a gruff voice, he replies, “Whatever you say, boss,” and grabs me.",1,1754493595.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

I've made the query much shorter (plot info is now 304 words), including deleting my previous publishing credits. It was a small press and years ago, so I thought it might be better just to leave it out for now. I cut the manuscript from 73K to 58K and also heavily revised the first chapter to make it more exciting. Additionally, I changed the title to one I think is more fun.

I hope this query is better! Thanks in advance for taking a look.

Dear Agent,

CATCH A WITCH IN TWO WEEKS OR LESS is a cozy, spooky middle grade fantasy complete at 58,000 words. It’s a love letter to Halloween tricks, treats, and mayhem like Rainbow Rowell’s *Pumpkinheads*, but with real ghosts and witchy magic, for a slightly younger audience.

Tilly Saltwater is devastated that Granny Jan isn’t decorating her haunted B&B for this year’s Spookyfest contest. Tilly was excited to transform the front yard into a Halloween wonderland for the fussy ghostly guests and trick-or-treaters, and she was hoping to use the contest as a way to reconnect with the grandmother she hasn’t seen in years. But when Granny says she’s too busy, Tilly realizes this is her opportunity to show Granny and the ghosts what she’s made of. Maybe she can even snatch first prize away from Moira, Granny’s snooty coffee shop nemesis!

It only takes one trip downtown for Tilly to realize that, just like the pie-eating contest that still haunts her nightmares, she’s bitten off much more than she can chew. The small businesses take Spookyfest *seriously*, and even armed with glitter glue and a vision, a solo sixth-grader doesn’t stand a chance. She can’t go to Granny for help, and she’s not about to ask her former friend Miles.  As Halloween creeps closer, Tilly’s on her own and out of luck.

Then she unearths a vintage magic dating manual in Granny’s attic. Mistakenly believing it’s a guide to catching witches, Tilly’s convinced her problems are solved! Who better than a witch to conjure up some contest-winning decorations? But when she starts following the book’s instructions, all she brews up is hilarious trouble, and the real magic wand she finds only makes things worse. One mishap, misunderstanding, and misguided spell leads to another, culminating in Tilly accidentally bringing every decoration in town to life! With help from the ghosts and Miles, as well as Granny and Moira (who happen to be girlfriends…and witches), Tilly, the newest witch in town, must use everything she’s learned about the magic of understanding others to round up the runaway monsters and save Spookyfest.

CATCH A WITCH IN TWO WEEKS OR LESS stands alone but has series potential. I saw that you like \[THING\], and I very much hope you’ll enjoy it. 

I live in the \[state my book is set in\] woods with my partner, three kids, and many pets, in a house that is unfortunately not haunted (to my knowledge).

All best, 

Darthmergirl

First 300 words:



The treehouse was shrieking again.



Tilly Saltwater clutched the quilt with stiff fingers in her mom’s childhood bed at Granny’s house. The sheets smelled like mothballs. The mattress was lumpy. The bed had been an antique even when Mom was a kid, with a curly metal headboard and legs that were perfect for stubbing unsuspecting toes. It had already gotten Tilly three times in two nights.



Bruised toes weren’t keeping her awake tonight, though. The Mourning Maple was. Beneath the steady patter of rain, the gnarled monstrosity at the edge of Granny’s property was writhing and wailing and clawing its black branches at the sky, groaning like a storm-tossed ship at sea. It wasn’t windy. Tilly burrowed her head into the pillow and pulled the quilt up over her ears. She was not going to get up and look out the window again, straining to see through the watery darkness if those glowing red eyes had gotten closer.



She wished her parents had let her tag along with them to Italy. She wished she hadn’t told Granny last night, all offended, that almost twelve was far too old to be tucked in. Most of all, she wished Groaner had been willing to sleep on her bed, but he’d waddled off hours ago. Now it was just Tilly, Mom’s creepy dress-up dolls staring down from their shelf, and the haunted treehouse shouting its shingles off out in the rain.



And a ghost, gleaming pearlescent and humming to herself, brandishing a club at the foot of Tilly’s bed.



“GYAAH!” screamed Tilly, clawing out of the covers.



“EEK!” cried the ghost, swinging the club from side to side.



Tilly dove for the bedside lamp. The ghost lunged at her head. Tilly tumbled to the floor in a tangle of mothball-scented sheets. “Get away from me!” she shouted. ",3,1754493536.0,PubTips,1,1.0,False

What a GREAT investment, love this new valve I've now had for \~1 year. However, it recently started leaking (no big deal) and I easily serviced it with the kit. Though it was just leaking at the shaft, I replaced all the o-rings and the PTFE valve sealing plug.

Does anyone know if they are going to offer a less expensive service kit? I don't want to be cheap, but it costs \~$25 with shipping to get one of these kits to the U.S. and that's pricey, about half the cost of a new stock valve...wondering if there's an alternative or they will offer a less expensive option? I'd even be open to buying a few kits or just more extras like the o-rings/plug to save on future shipping...

I suppose I could source the o-rings but it's the PTFE valve sealing plug that I couldn't get...and I'm not even sure how often that wears out...

We have had rough times in the past when we argue about practically anything but we end up making things up and we move forward. Most of the time we are good but there are times in which she just gets mad at me for not doing something I should have known that I had to do, or because I did something that I should have known that I didn´t have to do. Yes, as weird as it sounds. With this in mind, help me interpret this:

We normally got home from work and after having something to eat I usually watch TV and she takes a nap. Yesterday we did the same but instead of watching TV while my wife takes a nap, I just let her sleep and went to a different room to work and play with my computer. I did this because I didn´t feel like watching TV and didn´t want to bother her this time, because she complains a lot when she is sleeping and I'm watching TV in the same room since ""I´m impolite making so much noise and waking her up all the time"". So, I really wanted to keep minding my bussiness this time with some music I've been studying for the past few days. I told her, just sleep, if you need anything I´ll be in the next room playing/studying/making noise with the computer. So far so good, at least for me.

She slept and when she woke up she was silent, and hasn´t said anything since yesterday. In the morning, I always make coffee and take her to her job in the car so she doesn´t have to drive, but today she said I'm not drinking coffee and I'm drving myself to work. We end up arguing for things like this much more than I would like to accept, but sometimes I just apologize If I made her feel uncomfortable in any way.

However, there are times (like now) in which I don´t have enough clarity of mind, or I´m in my sttuborn mood, or I don´t know, that I feel completely aggravated for being treated like this, and for accusing me of something that it is not even clear. So, I just get in the same passive aggresive mood of not saying anything, like playing along with her, I don´t give her any reaction making it clear that if she wants things to be like this, then ok, be my guest.

So, AITAH for not keep reaching to her and ask what happened and make things up and apologizing for anything that I did/didn´t do?",3,1754493160.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

\-SF Giants Team Total Over 4.5 (-105) | 0.5 Units

**Why This Pick?** 

4 of Andrew Heaney’s (4.89 ERA) last 5 starts have resulted in Pittsburgh’s opponents putting at least 7 runs in the bag. To be honest, I was surprised Pirates starter Mike Burrows allowed 6 yesterday – he’s been far more solid recently than Heaney. That said, I have to imagine San Fran will fair at least as well against today’s arm. The Giants have scored at least 5 runs in 3 of their last 4 outings, and the Over has cashed in their last 4 straight games. Between Heaney & the bullpen, I think San Francisco puts at least 5 runs on the board today.

# Patch 1.9 Release Notes Below, But First...

Hey everyone. I need to be honest with my community about where I'm at right now. I'm in the middle of a serious financial crisis and fighting to keep my work alive. In the middle of all this, two nights ago I had a dream that I was in a grocery store, and I heard someone tell me that Scale Space doesn't have a clear aisle that players would know to look down to find it.

This realization sparked a breakthrough, and I'm now rebuilding the game's core identity around a new idea: the **'Causmonaut.'** A game about exploring the cosmos by exploring causality itself.

This new direction is about making the game's identity tangible. I'm designing a new UI that feels like the cockpit of a ship, with physical dials and radials.

[Here's the new WIP UI for Scale Space Causmonaut](https://preview.redd.it/nec5y28pyehf1.png?width=3839&format=png&auto=webp&s=d85602eeadaed970158427cb890f531c8d995e10)

I'm creating new capsule art—a silhouette of a 'Causmonaut' floating above a rainbow triangle—to give the project a clear, iconic look. While I am patching bugs, really I'm performing open-heart surgery on the game's concept to make it something truly special.

But I'm doing this on borrowed time. The honest truth is that my phone texting/internet has already been turned off, and I'm now behind on rent. My bank account is also -$200. Steady client work that was keeping me afloat has unexpectedly ended, leaving me in an impossible position. This creative breakthrough is happening at the worst possible financial moment.

That's why I'm turning to you. Any support you can offer through [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/setzstone/scale-space-causmonaut-update) will go directly toward covering my basic living expenses. It will buy me the precious time I need to implement these vital changes and give Scale Space the relaunch it deserves.

To prove my commitment, I've also just pushed the 1.9 update to [Scale Space on itch.io](https://setzstone.itch.io/scale-space). It's packed with quality-of-life improvements that you can play **right now**. This is the kind of work your support allows me to continue doing, even as I plan for the larger 'Causmonaut' transformation.

If you choose to support me, yes you're funding the future idea- but also you're supporting the work that's happening today. You are becoming a part of this story.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Your belief in this project means everything right now. Here are the 1.9 patch notes:

1mj793k,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mj793k/should_you_buy_the_cuisinart_dcc3400nas_coffee/,Should You Buy the Cuisinart DCC-3400NAS Coffee Maker Review for Perfect Daily Brews?,"**An Honest Take on the Cuisinart DCC-3400NAS Coffee Maker**

Coffee is more than a morning ritual for me; it's an essential lifeline. When I started using the Cuisinart DCC-3400NAS 12-Cup Coffee Maker, I stopped making excuses for mediocre morning brews. Being fully programmable with thoughtful features, this coffee maker aims to be a premium addition to your kitchen, and I've spent weeks putting it through its paces.

**Design and Build Quality**

This coffee maker has a sleek, polished stainless-steel exterior that exudes both sophistication and durability. Sitting neatly on my countertop, its dimensions (7.75""D x 9""W x 14.25""H) make it compact enough for home kitchens, yet large enough for busy office settings. The thermal carafe's stainless-steel handle is not just for aesthetics; it’s comfortable to grip and easy to pour without messy spills—a major win when I’m half-asleep trying to fill my mug. However, its weight of around 8.45 pounds means moving it around the kitchen isn't exactly effortless.  

**Brewing Features and Customization**

What stood out almost instantly is its versatility. With its fully programmable nature, I can set the brew to start at an ungodly hour. The 1-4 cup setting is perfect when I’m not feeling like downing an entire pot, while the 12-cup capacity saves the day when hosting brunch or those never-ending team meetings at home. As someone who prefers bold over regular coffee, the Brew Strength Control became my go-to. If your coffee choices sway between faintly flavored or punchy enough to kickstart your day, this machine offers options that match your mood.  

[Curious about the Cuisinart DCC-3400NAS? Check Amazon now.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b01n6t5qno/)

**Ease of Operation**

Programmable buttons and a well-lit interface make the day-to-day operation intuitive. My elder parents tested it too, and they had no issues figuring it out. The gold-tone filter combined with the charcoal water filter ensures a cleaner, tastier brew—these might seem small details, but trust me, you’ll notice the improved flavor. A nifty water window ensures accurate filling, and the machine even remembers the last brew settings thanks to the 60-second reset. That feature came in handy after a brief power outage.  

****Highlights****

- Gold-tone and charcoal water filters combine for a cleaner, richer brew.
- Convenient 24-hour programmability caters to busy schedules.  
- Adjustable brew strength to suit personal preferences.  

**Shortcomings**

Despite its shiny features, some things could be better. The “ready alert tone,” while useful, felt annoyingly loud first thing in the morning. Also, the carafe, though sturdy, doesn’t always keep coffee piping hot for more than an hour or two, which might disappoint anyone wanting their brews steaming for extended sipping sessions.

- Ready alert tone is quite loud.  
- Thermal carafe doesn’t fully retain heat for extended hours.  

**Performance Compared to Competing Brands**

Comparing this product against similar coffee makers like Breville Precision and the Ninja CP307 put its strengths into sharper focus. The programming features on the Ninja rival the performance offered here, but its glass carafe doesn’t match the convenience or insulation offered by the Cuisinart’s thermal design. On the other hand, Breville's machine often nails consistent brewing temperatures, something this Cuisinart model slightly falters on for bold coffee drinkers. However, the price point, reusable filters, and customization options make this coffee maker a more value-rich option for the average user than its competitors.  

**Bang for the Buck**

For what it offers, this coffee maker justifies every penny spent on it. It’s packed with customizable settings, making it suitable for coffee enthusiasts who value hands-on control. Unlike similar machines that nickel-and-dime you with overpriced proprietary parts, the reusable gold-tone filter helps save in the long run. Sure, it could have handled thermal insulation better or trimmed some noise off the alert tone, but at this price point, those compromises don’t outweigh the rich functionality baked into the design.

Alexander Montgomery, a 42-year-old businessman, incredibly handsome, immensely wealthy, and utterly single. He is the only son of the Montgomery family, a billionaire family closely watched by the world. He is the dream man for many women, yet Alexander refuses to settle down with a wife. He dates a myriad of women, from beauty queens to actresses, both in America and abroad, bringing them to his bed from almost every corner of the industry. However, he still has no intention of settling down with anyone seriously.  
  
The reason is a secret... indeed, a secret that no one knows, not even the secretary who has served him for many years.  
  
Elizabeth Thorne, or, as Alexander often calls her, ‘Beth’, has been working at Alexander's company since she graduated, and she is now nearly 28 years old.  
  
She knows everything about Alexander, particularly his taste in women. Alexander likes bold, adventurous women, those with great skills, and women with large breasts. She is the one who screens women to match her boss's taste and delivers them to his bed every night or whenever Alexander desires.  
  
But who would know that beneath her thick glasses and modest attire, she hides a secret that will remain a secret forever.  
  
She harbors a secret love for Alexander...  
  
Yes... she loves him, but she knows full well that he will never love a plain, unremarkable secretary like her.  
  
She doesn't even register on Alexander's radar. He never looks at her the way a man looks at a woman. She is just an assistant who understands him well. Yet, she endures, watching him take other women to bed, just because she doesn't want to be away from him.  
  
“What are you thinking about, Beth?”  
  
Alexander stands with his arms crossed, looking at the secretary who has worked with him for so long that they know each other inside out. To be honest, Elizabeth knows him better than he knows himself.  
  
He still vividly remembers the first day he worked with the girl with thick glasses who dressed like a kindergarten teacher, Elizabeth. She came for a job interview but ended up spilling coffee on him. He should have dismissed her and hired someone else, but for some reason, he chose her. That choice never disappointed him in the slightest because Elizabeth performed her duties as a personal secretary excellently, even though she wasn't sexy in the way he wanted from a secretary.  
  
She was skilled, meticulous, and thorough in everything, and sometimes even helped him resolve situations effectively. That's why he wouldn't let her leave, keeping her with a generous salary. But that wasn't the only job she excelled at, because Elizabeth also did an outstanding job of arranging the women he would sleep with. She selected women who matched his preferences perfectly.  
  
""Uh... Boss...""  
  
The young woman was jolted out of her thoughts when the voice of her boss, who she thought about constantly, rang out. She turned to look at him and found him standing not far away, looking irresistibly handsome, with his dark eyes gazing at her and a smile on his face.  
  
""Why do you look so surprised? Or are you thinking about your boyfriend?""  
  
He walked closer, making her heart race, but she had to conceal it under a calm expression, without showing any emotion.  
  
""I... don't have a boyfriend, Boss.""  
  
""It's hard to believe you're twenty-seven now, Beth. In a few months, you'll be twenty-eight. Haven't you thought about starting a family?""  
  
She forced a slight smile.  
  
""I just haven't met someone I like yet.""  
  
He nodded slightly, folding his arms as he looked at her intently.  
  
""Then it's probably the same as me. The reason I haven't married is because I haven't met the right woman.""  
  
""But Boss sleeps with many women...""  
  
""That's just my body's way of needing release.""  
  
He laughed as if it were a joke, but she couldn't find it funny at all.  
  
""I understand.""  
  
He smiled again, a devastatingly handsome smile, but all she could do was look, having no right to touch.  
  
""Do you remember last night's party, Beth?""  
  
""Uh, I remember.""  
  
He smiled again.  
  
""I want that model. Arrange for her to be with me for two days and two nights. I'll pay generously.""  
  
She felt a deep pain every time she knew he would be with someone else, but she had to smile and do her duty.  
  
""I contacted her personal manager, and she has agreed to participate in the event.""  
  
""Very good. You are the best secretary I've ever had so far, Beth.""  
  
""Thank you, boss.""  
  
""This year, I'll give you a ten percent salary raise and a special bonus.""  
  
She nodded to Alexander, even though her heart was aching terribly. If she had a choice, she wouldn't be doing this.  
  
""Thank you again, boss.""  
  
""Okay, then please prepare the meeting documents for ten o'clock. We'll attend the meeting together.""  
  
""Yes, boss.""  
  
The tall man in a sleek business suit walked back into his office, but she continued to watch until the wooden door closed completely.  
  
Tears welled up in her eyes, but fortunately, her thick glasses helped hide her vulnerability.  
  
She placed a hand over her chest, where her heart was, and murmured painfully,  
  
""It hurts... so bad...""  
  
""Why are you home so early today, dear?""  
  
Beth walked into the house at two in the afternoon, prompting her mother, who was hanging clothes, to ask out of curiosity. Normally, she never returned home before eight in the evening.  
  
""Today, there's a company party, Mom. The boss let me come home to get ready.""  
  
""Oh, I forgot. You did tell me, Beth,""  
  
Mom said with a shy smile, laughing it off.  
  
""I might be home late tonight, Mom.""  
  
""That's okay, Beth. You're grown up now. You can take care of yourself. I'm not worried.""  
  
""And you'll be okay alone, right?""  
  
""Oh, I'm not alone. I have four furry friends here.""  
  
Before she could finish, four large dogs joyfully bounded towards Beth, licking and pawing at her clothes until they were marked. But the young woman never got upset with them because she knew they loved and missed her.  
  
""Wow, you're really licking me a lot...""  
  
She laughed cheerfully and played happily with the dogs, under the watchful and content gaze of her mother.  
  
""Milo, Luna, Coco, Ziggy, go play somewhere else now.""  
  
Her mother gently instructed the dogs, and they obediently ran off to play in the garden beside the house. She watched them with affection.  
  
""Being a dog would be nice, Mom. You wouldn't have to think much, just wait for your owner to come back and play with you.""  
  
""Does saying that mean something's bothering you, dear?""  
  
Her mother walked over and gently patted her head.  
  
""Let it go, Beth. That's what the monks teach.""  
  
She forced a smile for her mother.  
  
""I was just saying, Mom. It's nothing, really. By the way, do you have any food prepared today? If not, I can go buy some for you.""  
  
""I've got some leftover mackerel. I was thinking of making some shrimp paste chili dip.""  
  
Elizabeth touched her mouth.  
  
""That sounds delicious. I wish I could stay and eat.""  
  
""I'll make it for you tomorrow then. Today, you should go to the party with your boss.""  
  
She gave a sad smile but quickly shook it off, not wanting her mother to worry.  
  
""Alright, Mom. I'll go take a shower now.""  
  
""Take your time. Oh, how will you get there?""  
  
""The boss is stopping by to pick me up.""  
  
Victoria smiled widely.  
  
""Your boss is nice, really caring towards his employees.""  
  
""The boss is kind to everyone, Mom.""  
  
She forced another smile for her mother before stepping into the house, her face turning sad once her mother wasn't looking.  
  
She had to endure smiling and laughing while inside she was deeply hurt—especially when she had to send another woman to his bed.  
  
Duty... Keep reminding yourself it's just duty...  
  
She told herself firmly in her heart, but couldn't stop the sadness.  
  


# Chapter 2

1031 WordsEP2: The Secretary on the Bed  
  
Elizabeth spent nearly half an hour in the bathroom before walking out naked and stopping in front of the large mirror in the bedroom.  
  
Without her thick glasses, her large round eyes appeared sweet and captivating. Her eyelashes were long and curled, her nose was high and slightly upturned, her full lips were a soft red, her face was beautifully oval-shaped, and she had a dimple on her left cheek.  
  
Elizabeth looked at her reflection in the large mirror.  
  
A woman with a voluptuous figure, her body was full of soft flesh. Even though she had a slim waist, her chest was too large, requiring her to wear oversized clothes to cover it since her teenage years. Additionally, her hips were too wide, appearing large and bulky. She wished to be smaller, but no matter how much she dieted or exercised, her body remained the same.  
  
There was no way she could have a perfect figure or be the woman of Alexander's dreams.  
  
The young woman sighed heavily in resignation before walking to open the wardrobe door, looking at the outdated clothes inside that reflected her personal taste.  
  
Her small, clean white hand took out a brownish-gray dress from the wardrobe. It was a maxi dress that nearly reached her ankles. She didn't particularly like the color, but this dress would help conceal her voluptuous figure quite well.  
  
""This one will do.""  
  
She didn't need to be beautiful. After all, this party was organized to allow Elizabeth and the company's top executives to relax. She was just an assistant.  
  
The young woman picked up a pair of sweet pink lace panties that matched an old-fashioned bra and was about to put on the maxi dress when a knock on the door interrupted her.  
  
""Hang on a sec, Mom,""  
  
She shouted, quickly grabbing a sweet pink towel from the closet to wrap around her body, and rushed to open the bedroom door.  
  
""What is it, Mom...""  
  
She could only say that much before freezing in shock. No, she wasn't just frozen; she was utterly shocked.  
  
Elizabeth blinked rapidly, thinking she had seen wrong, mistaking her mother for Alexander. But... no matter how many times she closed and opened her eyes, he was still standing there.  
  
His face was full of surprise at what he saw, and, of course, he definitely wouldn't like what he was seeing.  
  
She was so embarrassed she wished she could sink into the ground. A plump, nearly overweight woman like her shouldn't have to end up in a situation like this.  
  
Alexander had never noticed her before, and now seeing her like this, he would probably find it even more amusing.  
  
""Boss...""  
  
""I've never seen you in pink before.""  
  
He looked puzzled, his face nearly breaking into a smile of amusement.  
  
""And I've never seen you without glasses either.""  
  
His sharp black eyes locked onto hers, which were filled with panic.  
  
""Well... Beth...""  
  
He smiled again before handing her a large, beautifully colored paper bag.  
  
""I brought you an outfit.""  
  
""An outfit...?""  
  
""Yes, because I knew that if I didn't bring it, you'd dress in the same old-fashioned way you do for work.""  
  
Her face flushed, and all she could do was extend her trembling hand to take the pretty paper bag from his large hand. But fate played a trick on her as their fingertips accidentally touched.  
  
She shivered all over, quickly snatched the paper bag, and retreated into the room.  
  
Once the door was closed, she didn't know if Alexander would be angry with her hasty behavior. She only knew she couldn't stand there letting him look at her with amusement any longer.  
  
""Boss... why did you come so early...?""  
  
She stood behind the wooden door before slowly sinking to the floor, the shock still spreading throughout her body.  
  
She took only fifteen minutes to get dressed and stepped out of the room, descending the stairs. Her heart was still trembling, and her legs felt weak.  
  
She saw Alexander chatting happily with her mother before he turned to look at her when he noticed her mother looking.  
  
His gaze remained the same, with only a hint of something unreadable added, but she didn't care about it. Just forcing a smile and acting normal around him, like before, was already challenging enough.  
  
He had seen her... seen her in a disheveled state, seen her overly voluptuous figure, so how could she not be embarrassed?  
  
He looked at her as if he'd never seen a woman with her figure before. Of course, he was used to seeing slim figures and large breasts all his life.  
  
""I also bought contact lenses. They're in the clothing bag. Didn't you see them, Beth?""  
  
He spoke in a gentle tone as usual, indicating that he had forgotten about what had happened earlier.  
  
""Uh... I... I don't want to wear them, but thank you very much, Boss.""  
  
He stood up and looked at her directly.  
  
""It's okay, do as you please because your eyes are your own.""  
  
She forced a smile and turned to say goodbye to her mother, while Alexander looked at her from head to toe.  
  
""This fitted dress looks quite different on you.""  
  
She looked down at herself and sighed nervously.  
  
She didn't like this type of dress at all. It was tight in every part, whether it was her chest, waist, or overly large hips, but she couldn't refuse Alexander's request.  
  
""I have never... worn something like this before,"" she told him truthfully.  
  
He gave a small smile.  
  
""I know, because ever since you've worked with me, I've only ever seen you in oversized, old-fashioned clothes.""  
  
""Beth...""  
  
""But it's beautiful in its own way.""  
  
She knew he was just saying that to be polite.  
  
""Then let's go, Boss. The party is about to start.""  
  
""Alright.""  
  
Alexander turned to pay respects to her mother and said goodbye. She also said goodbye to her mother once more before following him to the car.  
  
The tall, well-built man in a sharp suit looked perfect in every way.  
  
She glanced down at herself again and sighed at the sight of the awkward girl she appeared to be.  
  


# Episode 3

1266 WordsEP3: Secretary on the Bed  
  
As the party began, Alexander separated himself to mingle with the top executives, while she coordinated everything for him.  
  
About the women...  
  
Yes, tonight she had to arrange for Jessica, the rising star model who was skyrocketing in fame, to spend the night with Alexander as arranged.  
  
She had already made all the arrangements. Jessica's fee was a staggering five million dollars for two nights to satisfy Alexander's raw desires.  
  
She stood clutching her mobile phone tightly, waiting for a call from Jessica's personal manager, but couldn't help glancing at the luxurious dinner table where Alexander and the other executives were seated.  
  
All she could do was watch, secretly observing him like a child watching a plane soar overhead, with no chance of ever riding it.  
  
The young woman gave a wistful smile to herself, then flinched slightly when Alexander's gaze turned to meet hers — eyes filled with yearning. And she could barely hide her secret in time.  
  
""Boss... Do you need something?""  
  
She quickly changed her expression and walked over to Alexander, who was beckoning her.  
  
""Have you eaten yet? Why don't you come and eat with us?""  
  
""Uh... I'm not hungry yet, Boss.""  
  
""Afraid of gaining weight?""  
  
""N-no, Boss. I just... I'm just not really hungry.""  
  
Alexander's sharp eyes scanned her from head to toe and he smiled.  
  
""You're not fat, go ahead and eat.""  
  
""Uh...""  
  
""Come sit with us.""  
  
Then his large, warm hand gently took her arm, preventing her from walking away.  
  
A wave of warmth spread through her body. She felt vulnerable, but the person holding her arm probably didn't feel anything. He was just playing the role of a good boss.  
  
""Yes, Boss.""  
  
She sat down on the chair next to him and looked down at the food on the plate he had kindly served her.  
  
""You look different today, Beth,"" one of the executives remarked.  
  
""Uh... Thank you, Liam,"" she replied softly.  
  
""I've never seen you dressed like this before. You usually wear loose clothes,"" Liam continued.  
  
""Um, I..."" She was about to find an answer, but Alexander interrupted and answered on her behalf.  
  
""I chose this outfit for Beth myself. If I hadn't, she would have worn her usual oversized clothes."" Alexander looked at her and smiled.  
  
""Isn't that right, Beth?""  
  
""Uh, yes...""  
  
She avoided Alexander's sharp gaze and focused on her food, but he leaned in closer, and she could clearly smell the alcohol.  
  
Alexander had probably had a lot to drink and was starting to get drunk, and when Alexander got drunk, he would want s\*x, which Jessica was supposed to be on standby for in the prepared room.  
  
She continued eating for a while as the executives dispersed to dance, smoke, or take women upstairs for some private time, leaving her alone with Alexander.  
  
She glanced at him with concern. Alexander was drinking more than usual and didn't stop. His face was flushed, and the smell of alcohol was becoming more intense.  
  
""Boss... you're getting drunk.""  
  
He glanced at her before smiling.  
  
""I'm not drunk yet...""  
  
Then he raised his glass and downed it again, emptying it before refilling.  
  
""Boss, if you get too drunk, you won't be able to... you know.""  
  
She meant s\*x because Alexander had already paid Jessica the full amount in advance.  
  
He smiled, leaned in closer, so close that she shivered, and her heart nearly stopped.  
  
""Boss...""  
  
""No matter how drunk I get, I can't go without s\*x. I have to enjoy it...""  
  
He smiled, his eyes soft and deep, looking into hers through her thick glasses.  
  
""But... aren't you curious?""  
  
""Curious... about what, Boss?""  
  
He smiled again, then murmured,  
  
""The drink, of course.""  
  
She sighed in relief when he only talked about the drink and not s\*x.  
  
""Well... I don't drink. I've never had a drink before.""  
  
He turned to pour a drink into a glass and handed it to her, looking deeply into her eyes.  
  
""Have a drink with me.""  
  
""I... I really can't drink, Boss.""  
  
""I know you can't drink, but you're my secretary. You should learn a bit, don't you think?""  
  
He still spoke politely, but what changed slightly was the way he looked at her. It felt strange, but she couldn't quite put her finger on what was strange about it.  
  
""Come on, just have a drink with me.""  
  
""I... I'm afraid I'll get drunk...""  
  
She really couldn't drink because she'd never touched alcohol in her life.  
  
""Wouldn't it be a way to show respect to your boss, Beth?""  
  
""I...""  
  
She hesitated, trying to find a way out, but seeing Alexander's serious expression, she realized there was no escape.  
  
""Well... okay, but just a little, please.""  
  
""Alright, just one glass.""  
  
She had to take the glass from his hand, but she was still hesitant to drink it.  
  
""Drink it.""  
  
He clinked his glass against hers and urged her.  
  
""Drink it... bottoms up!""  
  
Then he downed his glass before her, while she had to force herself to swallow the awful-tasting liquid down her throat into her stomach.  
  
""Ugh...""  
  
""Not tasty, is it?""  
  
He must have seen her grimace, which prompted him to ask.  
  
""It's bitter and has a weird astringent taste. I really don't like it.""  
  
""Drink it often, and you'll get used to it,"" he smiled and poured her another glass.  
  
""Boss, that's enough. I...""  
  
""Just one more glass, please...""  
  
His eyes were so pleading that she couldn't help but give in.  
  
""Alright.""  
  
In the end, she ended up drinking three glasses, and was so dizzy and confused she could barely keep her composure.  
  
""Beth... where are you going?""  
  
""Uh... it's almost nine. I'm going to call Jessica for you, boss.""  
  
She stood up, but the alcohol made her stumble and fall onto Alexander, her ample chest landing right on his face.  
  
""Oops... I'm... I'm sorry, Boss.""  
  
""It's alright.""  
  
She quickly jumped away, sobering up almost instantly.  
  
""I... I need to excuse myself now.""  
  
He gave a slight smile, and she didn't say anything else. She quickly strode out, her heart racing with excitement and shock, her mind almost shutting down.  
  
Her chest had accidentally landed on Alexander's face. He probably... probably couldn't breathe at that moment.  
  
She rushed out of the party and tried calling Jessica's manager again, but couldn't get through.  
  
""Hey... why is this happening?""  
  
She was extremely alarmed; since starting as Alexander's secretary, she had never made a mistake. But now...  
  
""Pick up, please pick up.""  
  
She paced back and forth, holding her phone to her ear the entire time, but the result was the same—the other party's phone was off.  
  
""What should I do now?""  
  
Even though she was still a bit tipsy, the remaining clarity in her senses filled her with fear.  
  
How was she going to tell Alexander? He was sure to be furious. He had never gone without s\*x after a night of drinking.  
  
She had heard women who slept with Alexander gossip that he was very intense in bed, suggesting he had a very high s\*x drive. And if he didn't get to release tonight, what would happen then?  
  
The young woman paced back and forth in front of the party venue, trying to think of the best way to tell Alexander about Jessica backing out of the arrangement — but she had no idea how to even begin.  
  
Should she find another woman to replace Jessica? No, that wouldn't work... Alexander would definitely be displeased if he woke up and found the woman he slept with wasn't the one he wanted.  
  
So what should she do now?  
  


# Chapter 4

1360 WordsEP 4: The Secretary on the Bed  
  
After standing and thinking for almost half an hour, the only solution was to confess the truth.  
  
Yes, she had to tell Alexander, she had to tell him everything, even if she would be reprimanded.  
  
Elizabeth decided to walk back to Alexander's table, only to find it empty.  
  
""Boss... where did you go?""  
  
She spun around anxiously, searching for him, but he was nowhere in sight, so she asked a passing staff member.  
  
""Excuse me, did you see... a big man sitting here drinking?""  
  
""Oh, Mr. Alexander, right?""  
  
""Uh, yes.""  
  
""Just a moment ago, the gentleman was sick, so the staff took him to his room.""  
  
""The boss got sick.""  
  
""Yes.""  
  
She took a moment to regain her composure before stammering out another question.  
  
""And do you know which room my boss booked?""  
  
""Yes, the suite.""  
  
She exhaled in relief, thanked the staff, and hurriedly made her way to the luxurious suite where Alexander was staying, filled with anxiety.  
  
Upon arrival, she encountered a male staff member walking out of Alexander's suite.  
  
""Is Mr. Alexander in the room?""  
  
""Yes, he is.""  
  
""Thanks a lot.""  
  
She smiled at the staff member before quickly opening the door to the suite, where she found the young man lying topless, stretched out on the bed.  
  
Elizabeth sighed softly and moved closer to Alexander's large, perfect body, trying to look past his broad chest but failing.  
  
Alexander's chest was very wide and covered with hair, and his muscles were well-defined. She admired him before reaching out to touch him, but pulled her hand back before she could.  
  
Don't do this, Beth...  
  
Finally, she managed to tear her gaze away from Alexander's broad chest and focus on his face.  
  
And now she had to wake him up to listen to her mistakes, right?  
  
She was scared... but there was no other choice...  
  
""Boss... Boss...""  
  
""You're here already...""  
  
The voice of the drunk man came softly from his throat, even though his sharp eyes remained closed.  
  
""Well... I have something to tell you.""  
  
""Come up on the bed... I'm waiting...""  
  
A large hand grasped her arm with precision, even though his eyes were still closed.  
  
She was shocked and frozen, wanting to shake off his hand forcefully but afraid of upsetting Alexander.  
  
""I've been waiting for you... Come here... Come and calm my madness...""  
  
""Ah... Boss...""  
  
The drunken man's pull was surprisingly strong, causing her to fall backward onto the bed, landing on his muscular body.  
  
""Boss, it's me, Beth, Boss...""  
  
She pushed him away as he rolled over her, and the bright lights in the room suddenly went out as if on a timer, leaving only the dim yellow glow of the bedside lamp.  
  
""I want to have sex... Make it happen... Now...""  
  
Was she dreaming? Alexander was on top of her, and he was... Yes, he was about to enjoy her body without being conscious.  
  
What should she do? Should she quickly push him away and escape from this room?  
  
Or...  
  
Allow him to take her virginity and keep this secret hidden forever.  
  
Her struggle subsided as her long-loyal heart took control, even over the shame in her soul.  
  
She wouldn't have another chance like this, so she shouldn't let it slip away.  
  
Sleep with Alexander, let him enter her, revel in the pleasure he was offering, and let it all end by tomorrow morning, as if nothing had happened. Alexander wouldn't know who he had slept with because he was very drunk.  
  
""Yes...""  
  
She agreed in a trembling voice, her thick glasses were pulled off and tossed beside the bed by her small hand, and her full lips, never kissed before, parted in anticipation.  
  
She writhed under Alexander's powerful naked body as if in a dream. Yes... She had dreamed of this moment, the time when Alexander would enter her body every night, but this time it was real.  
  
After Alexander bit her lip and sucked her tongue almost to the point of tearing, he licked down on her smooth white neck, carelessly tearing off the clothes he had chosen for her, then licked all over her smooth shoulders that had never been touched by any man before.  
  
""Ah... Oh, Boss... Boss...""  
  
His large hands grasped her ample breasts, and he groaned deeply, his piercing eyes nearly closed as he gazed at her small, pink rose-colored n\*\*\*\*\*s.  
  
She felt as if she were about to be devoured by him; both his gaze and his touch made her shiver with pleasure, causing her desire to overflow.  
  
Soon, he buried his face in her ample D-cup breasts, nuzzling into them, while his hands kneaded them firmly. More impressively, he rubbed her n\*\*\*\*\*s with his strong fingers simultaneously.  
  
“Ah... Oh... Boss... It feels amazing...”  
  
What was happening to her? Why was she crying out so shamelessly? She should have been embarrassed, but the overwhelming pleasure was taking over, transforming her into a woman consumed by passion.  
  
“Ah... Oh... Ah... Oh... It feels incredible...”  
  
She writhed with intense desire, and when her n\*\*\*\*\*s were flicked by his rough tongue, her entire being seemed to ignite.  
  
“Oh... Ah... It feels so good... Ah... Ah...”  
  
She never knew he was so skilled at this. He sucked, licked, nibbled, and tugged at her n\*\*\*\*\*s as if they were a favorite dish to be savored.  
  
“Oh... Boss... It feels so good... Ah... Ah...”  
  
He growled with satisfaction as she squirmed in pleasure. He sucked on both n\*\*\*\*\*s, tugging at them like a hungry baby until he was satisfied, then kneaded them forcefully several times before moving up to kiss her full lips. She parted her lips in anticipation and was the one to slip her tongue into his mouth.  
  
“Mmm... Oh...”  
  
He groaned even more deeply, and his kisses became more intense. She was so overwhelmed with pleasure that she felt moisture seeping out, and she sensed his large hand moving to her front.  
  
“Ah... Oh... Boss... Don't... Ah... Ah...”  
  
Being a virgin, she instinctively protected her body, but when his long fingers slid deep into her tight entrance, teasing her slick wetness, she went wild.  
  
“Ah... Oh... Ah... Oh... It feels so good... Don't stop... It feels so good, Boss... It feels so good... Oh...”  
  
She eagerly lifted her triangular mound for him to use his fingers willingly, moving with surprising abandon, her mouth moaning, her body writhing, and offering herself with fiery passion.  
  
He moaned continuously, then proceeded to lick her n\*\*\*\*e again, sucking hard as if trying to swallow it down his throat. Then he released it and trailed his tongue down to her stomach.  
  
“Ahh... mmm... Boss... ah... ah...”  
  
She writhed and squirmed from intense pleasure. The more he kissed and licked down to her mound, the more overwhelmed she became, to the point that her arousal flowed uncontrollably.  
  
“Ahh... Boss... what are you going to do?... Ah... ahh...”  
  
“I’m going to lick...”  
  
“Ah... oohh, Boss... Boss, please... don’t... ah... don’t do it... don’t lick... mmm, ah... ah...”  
  
She pushed him away because she had never been licked there by a man before, but... but he wouldn’t stop. He spread her thick thighs apart and continued licking thoroughly.  
  
“Ooohhh... ah... ah... Boss... Boss... it feels so good... ah... ahh... mmm... why does it feel this good? Ah...”  
  
She couldn't resist him anymore, unable to fight against the intensity of Alexander's tongue. He was skilled at licking and sucking. No matter where he moved his tongue, it made her respond in a way that was truly astonishing.  
  
""Ah... mmm... ah... ah... Boss... it feels so good... ah... ah... mmm... it feels so good... ah...""  
  
She moaned loudly while lying sprawled, moving her wet mound toward him for him to lick, doing so willingly and wholeheartedly.  
  
Alexander didn't stop licking. Did he do this with every woman? Why was he so submissive to that part of a woman? She tried to find an answer, but when his long finger entered deeply into her body, she jolted in surprise.

I’m talking five times between 6am-9am at the least. Not only is it annoying, but i’m at a spot right now where getting up is always a roll of the dice on how sever my symptoms will be. 

I got some variety packs of SALTT & LMNT and in them came chocolate and caramel packets which sounded so nasty to me. I was imagining just hot water with these. And then one morning I decided to mix half a packet with my coffee. FIRST OF ALL- it was fantastic. I don’t know why salted chocolate/caramel didn’t occur to me when i first read these flavors, but it didn’t. SECOND, i am peeing 50-70% less since i started this. It was so obvious but i completely missed it. 

If you’re not into that (or have another morning bevvy that doesn’t work well with flavored electrolytes), I tried the keto chow drops in seltzer waters and that was amazing (not salty at all, and i doubled the suggested measurements for more sodium). Obviously won’t replace having your full packet of electrolytes, but it’ll probably help with the peeing every 45 minutes thing. I also can’t drink flavored things over night, so putting these in my bedside water has helped a ton too!  

If you have any other drink hacks or fun combos, or just favorite flavors of things, please share them!! :-)

Thanks!

I've done a few fasts, upto 48hr. The easiest one was ironically when I thought it'd be hardest - I was stuck in an airport for ~24h waiting for next flight. Was really hungry, but everything cost way too much, even a cup of coffee, and I was really trying to save money. So I just didn't eat or drink anything, only water from the fountain. 

It was a pretty boring experience, spending all day reading books or walking in the terminal, sleeping on chairs. And then people will tell you, why didn't you just get a lounge, it's only $60 !

but holy shit, I'm actually writing a positive review about expensive gum and i hate myself for it. kept seeing these ads about ""remineralizing"" and thought it was just another overpriced health trend for people with too much money. my teeth have been feeling rough from constant coffee drinking so i figured what the hell, let me waste twenty bucks and prove this is stupid. arrives with this whole scientific manual about chewing protocols and timing like i'm entering nasa training for my mouth. texture was weird at first .. definitely not your gas station orbit experience. but i'm stubborn so i followed this just to give it a fair shot before leaving a brutal review. except now i can't leave a brutal review because the damn thing actually works. that gross film feeling i used to get on my teeth every afternoon? gone. mouth feels cleaner throughout the day even with my absurd coffee intake. tried switching back to regular gum for a week to confirm i wasn't placebo-effecting myself and nope - the gross feeling came right back. so now i'm stuck paying luxury prices for gum and actually recommending it like some kind of converted wellness influencer.

With its sleek and compact design, the Keurig K-Mini instantly caught my eye. Measuring less than five inches wide, it’s perfect for spaces where counter real estate is at a premium. Whether you’re in a small apartment, dorm room, or even an RV, its narrow profile ensures it’ll fit in seamlessly.

**Ease of Use**

Brewing coffee has never been this straightforward. The one-cup reservoir concept is genius, requiring me to add fresh water for every brew. Initially, I was skeptical about this design, but it doubles as a reminder to use clean, filtered water for every cup, which surprisingly makes a noticeable difference in flavor. With just two buttons to operate—one for powering it on and another to brew—it’s foolproof, even for those groggy, pre-coffee mornings.

[Find the best price for Keurig K-Mini on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b08323nvl1/)  

**Design and Durability**

The minimalist style paired with the Dusty Rose color I opted for adds a touch of elegance to my kitchen. Its lightweight plastic material, while not premium, makes the unit portable and easy to move around. At just 4.6 pounds, relocating it from the counter to storage (or even to a different room) is effortless. One overlooked detail is the cord storage feature; keeping my counter tidy has been a breeze.

**Positives**

- The ultra-compact design fits in virtually any space.
- Brew sizes cater to various preferences, ranging from 6 to 12 ounces.
- Energy-efficient auto-off function shuts down the unit within 90 seconds of brewing.
- Travel mug compatibility—accommodates mugs up to 7 inches tall by removing the drip tray.
- Supports the My K-Cup Universal Reusable Coffee Filter for brewing ground coffee.

**Coffee Performance**

When it comes to brewing, speed is a standout feature. Coffee is ready within minutes, which is essential for my hectic mornings. The freshly brewed aroma quickly fills the room, making it feel like my own miniature coffee shop. Though it’s designed for K-Cup pods, the compatibility with reusable My K-Cup filters lets me brew with my favorite ground coffee, offering flexibility. What’s more, it never compromises on flavor; every single cup tastes robust and consistent.

**Less Favorable Aspects**

- Limited to single-cup brewing—unsuitable for serving multiple people at once.
- The water reservoir requires filling before every brew, which can become tedious for frequent users.
- Plastic construction might not appeal to those seeking higher-quality materials.

**Challengers**

There’s no shortage of competition in the single-serve coffee maker market. A prime rival is the Nespresso Essenza Mini, which caters to espresso lovers. While it boasts superior build quality and richer espresso, it falls behind in terms of flexibility, as it doesn’t support reusable filters for ground coffee. The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew is another alternative, offering both single-serve and carafe brewing modes. However, its bulkier design doesn’t hold up well in smaller spaces.

That said, none of these products match the Keurig K-Mini’s blend of portability, affordability, and an energy-efficient profile. The ability to adjust drink sizes and the universal filter option truly set it apart.

**Bang for the Buck**

This coffee maker strikes a balance between cost and functionality. Its purposeful set of features ensures that you’re paying for just what you need. While premium coffee makers with higher durability exist, the Keurig K-Mini focuses squarely on convenience and flexibility, making it an excellent value option. Even if you’re on a budget, this machine doesn’t skimp on delivering quality coffee—a commendable trait.

One day I had coffee in office and had very bad chest pain with dizziness. I straight went to ER room and was admitted where the doctor advised that they will check the complete heart profile.

Tests done:
Xray
Ecg
Echo
Tmt

All of these reports were normal and I was sent home. I had a fear that something may be left out and something might be wrong with my heart.

After a few days, I had black tarry stool that was very stinky and black. I went to GI and where upon endoscopy and biopsy I was diagnosed with H.pylori.

After this, doctor gave me some meds related to IBS and gut. And asked to meet after 3 weeks.

I started normal life completed my medicine and was doing fine. 

My chest pain started coming back after 1-2 months. I tried ignoring
But my anxiety related to heart kept coming back. 
I kept on thinking about it almost all the time and was checking my heart with oxy meter all the time.

I booked a test on my own to check for heart irregularities.

Again, the tests were normal and nothing wrong with my heart.

I developed intense fear or IAS (Illness Anxiety Syndrome).

Finally, I started googling symptoms of Hpylori and came across this sub reddit.
That’s where I understood that this bacteria could be the reason of my IAS.

I met my GI again and mentioned these symptoms and then started my treatment.

I’m given:
Vonopraz x 2 daily
Amoxicillin 1000mg x 2 daily
Clarithomicin 500mg x 2 daily

For next 10 days.

Currently I’m on 3rd day and thought to share my experience with people here.

My IAS has improved a little bit after reading this excellent study, which matched mostly what I’m going through:

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10875716/#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20infection%20with%20H.,illnesses%2C%20notably%20anxiety%20and%20depression.

Apart from it I’m having black poop almost 3 times in a day. Not having other side effects.


What I want to ask is, I have also started gym, its been 4 days as out of anxiety I wanted to make my heart strong.

I’m having 2 boiled eggs 1hr before gym and Oats meal as breakfast in the morning.

Anything I should be concerned about? 

I’ll update about IAS and my other symptoms once I complete my med course.

What I would like for them to bring into the character creation is more body morphs. 

I personally would love to have pointed ears. It would cool for them to add in some pointed ears, elven pointed ears.

Better eyes! The eyes in then game are pretty cool, but I would like to see added galaxy eyes! With or without a pupil. My elven oc as stunning blue galaxy eyes ‘no pupil’ its life my dream to actually bring my Elven OC into the game lol 

Now for camera settings when you take a photo for better Dreamsnaps or for personal capture. I notice there’s not that much poses for your character to do. I tend to choose the 3rd camera mode and have noticed I can’t crouch which is weird, even in camera mode 2 I can’t… it would be nice to actually have more poses for your character to do while in camera mode 2 and 3. 

The facial features should updated too and 7 facial expressions are okay but I would to have more lol 

Head and Hand poses would be amazing! Be nice to pose your characters head looking to any side, up, down, side ways. For hand poses it would be nice have hand poses or even holding an item from your inventory. Like holding a gem, a fruit, maybe drink you made.

Know with how your character eats, it’s just quick but could be better, I would like for them to bring in better way for our characters to eat. Like sit down at a table and eat. Sit around your valley enjoy a nice cup of coffee or any kind of drink. ",7,1754492301.0,DreamlightValley,3,1.0,False

I'll be 4 months on the 10th. Not going back thats for sure.

I have noticed that my anxiety shit shows are now limited to maybe every two weeks. Yesterday and today for me and about two weeks ago oddly enough. It catches me off guard the first few hours as the anxiety doesn't alarm me as much as it mushes my brain function to nothing. Basically opposite day for a bit. Yesterday, popped some mag glycinate (highly recommend one pill after a few hours awake, one more as needed and then before bed) and just rode it out. Laughing to myself yesterday and this morning as I pushed through. Crippled me the first 75 days or so but now it doesn't scare me.

A couple side notes I've noticed. 

Blood sugar issues are gone. Still don't mind the the thought of going back to bed after a few hours every day but a sleepy depressive fuck I have been known to be pre-nicotine. 

If you are still jamming with fake sugar in drinks, etc and having headaches, brain fog, and the like, you may want to get rid of it. I tried numerous times to drink a 8 oz sugar free Red Bull and had it all come back immediately. Neck tightness, back of head pressure, headache, and fog. 

I can handle about 120mg of coffee caffeine no problem but I have to take a day off here and there. Not a problem.

Highly suggest getting some creatine. Animal makes some tasty chewables. Helps with the fog and just peps you up in the gym. Even if the brain is tired, the body will come along. And of course Mag Glycinate. I got some chelated ones from Amazon, work well, not stomach issues.

1mj6onv,https://i.redd.it/3oyftcbowehf1.jpeg,Nine Puzzles is genuinely very underrated,"**THIS IS NOT A SPOILER FREE REVIEW**

I ecided to give Nine Puzzles a try because I was intrigued by the premise. A woman who was the suspect of her uncle's murder wants to solve the case while the detective who suspects her starts working with her. Welcome back Beyond Evil, Black Out and Justice in the Dark. After watching Nine Puzzles, it's safe to say that it is very underrated and deserves more recognition. 

The drama made me hooked from the get-go. Ena's uncle's murder had taken place under strange circumstances and from the very first episode, I started making a list of the potential suspects. With every episode, the story began to unfold more and more and soon it was made clear that this case was not that simple. Every episode left me with questions that required answers and I was so excited to see what would happen next. I must also give credit to the usage of flashbacks. Instead of relying on telling and now showing, the drama utilized the flashbacks in a clever way and I never felt like they were disturbing the pacing or the actual story. 

The pacing of the series was ideal and pretty much consistent. I wouldn't describe it as very slow, nor very fast - more like something in the middle. Most episodes took their time to build the mystery and the prosecution behind the investigations while some others had more fast-paced sequences and moments that flew by pretty quickly. I rarely felt my attention drifting away, my eyes were glued on the screen while trying to put the puzzle pieces (metaphorically and literally) together. 

One of my favourite aspects in crime series in showing what is happening behind-the-scenes of a crime investigation. I enjoyed observing the work of the police and Ena and it really helped that the police officers were competent and not just dumsels in distress. Every case required different ways to be solved and each case contributed to the resolution of the whole mystery behind the nine puzzles. 

I can't find enough words to express how much I loved the soundrack. The intro gave me chills every time and I loved how they incorporated classical pieces in some scenes. It was as if I was watching a classic crime series and gave a nice old-fashioned vibe, especially during Ena's scenes.

The main leads were by far my most favourite characters. I adored Yoon Ena from the very first episode and she has become one of my most favourite characters already. I understand those who complained about her behavior but I personally never found her annoying. She clearly showed signs of regression which is very common among people who experienced some sort of trauma at a young age, therefore her childish demeanor was understandable. Personally, I tend to become attached to quirky characters quite easily so it's no wonder I'd love someone like Ena. Kim Da Mi did a great job portraying her, her body language, her expressions, she captured Ena's outgoing character perfectly while giving her depth when it was required. I had a blast watching her helping the police to solve the murders and prove them wrong when they would doubt her. She always had the last word and I applaud her for that. Plus, her nails and outfits made her even more iconic.

Ena was much more than just a quirky profiler. On the outside, she appeared care-free, absent-minded, air-headed but that couldn't be further from the truth. It was highlighted quite often in the drama how much guilt she carried for her uncle's death and his murder continued to haunt her even after all of these years. Since she didn't have the chance to live a normal childhood due to the loss of her parents at a young age and the death of her uncle, she wasn't the best at socializing with other people. She treated her colleagues with sweets, presents etc but she still tried to figure out how to form proper human connections. I really liked how hesitant she was to comfort Han Saem after the death of Yang Jung-ho and yet she still did her best. These small glimpses of her behavior showed that deep down, she was a very troubled person who still tried to deal with the loss of her uncle and (later) the revalation about his potential crimes. 

Han Saem was also a character whom I looked forward to see. Son Sukku was great in this role, he nailed Han Saem's grumpy character. I liked that even though he wasn't able to tone down his cop persona and his personal ""instinct"", he was still willing to listen to Ena, despite his initial reaction towards her. His character was handled really well and him and Ena worked perfectly as a duo. Watching them getting closer and help each other was so refreshing, the scenes at his home had a calm and domestic vibe, both of them could let their guard down and the other's presence gave them comfort. When Ena admitted to her therapist that she was able to get some sleep at Hansaem's home because she felt safe, my heart almost melted. Their chemistry was really good and I'm glad we didn't spend a big amount of episodes with them trying to gain each other's trust. 

Regarding their characters, I like how they complimented each other, despite their differences. Ena is more outgoing and she is close to her team while treating police officers with coffees, hats etc. Hansaem is more professional and closeted but as he spend more time with Ena, he started to warm up more to her and other people. Hansaem is a fan of classic crime novels written by Agatha Cristie and Edgar Alan Poe while Ena didn't view them with much respect and she didn't rely on them to exlain the cases like Hansaem. Their viewpoints and characters were different but they were willing to listen to each other, especially Hansaem who stopped having prejudices against Ena.

The rest of the characters were equally engaging and intriguing. I liked how the drama gave one hint or two about who could be the real culprit and I admit that my list of suspects didn't seem to be narrowed down that quickly. I wish I was more aware of the amount of cameos by popular actors in Nine Puzzles because based on the reactions I've seen, many avid kdrama watchers were surprised to see so many veterans make an appearance on the series. Although I must admit I didn't expect to see Park Mi-hyun (Squid Game, Black Out) and Jeong Man-Sik (Through The Darkness), these are two actors whom I was familiar with yet didn't expect to see in this drama. 

Another character who caught my interest was Ena's therapist, Lee Seung-Joo. I know Park Gyu-young from Squid Game and I knew beforehand that she was an actress in this series too, alongside Roh Jae-won. Her character was suspicious to me but the reveal of her being the serial killer was still so interesting to see. I was genuinelly impressed by Park Gyu-Young's acting. Going from a calm and professional therapist to a wronged woman who sought revenge in the amount of a few episodes seemed so natural thanks to her performance. Seung-Joo was not just a sadistic killer. She didn't kill for her own pleasure. She killed because she wanted justice for her mother's death and the coruption that was done by her ""victims"". She didn't want to continue living a normal life once she learned the truth and even though she knew that she could have avoided this path, she went on to kill. 

Even though the mystery aspect is the core of the series, Nine Puzzles tackled other topics regarding trust, human connections, trauma and corruption. Learning about the real events that occurred behind One City's development and watching the victims work together in order to demolish Shindonga market made my blood boil from anger. All of these people were willing to go to great lengths just to increase their power, without feeling any remorse. Taking that into consideration really made me question Seung-Joo's actions and motives. 

The drama put great emphasis on the importance of trust between people. Ena constantly asked Hansaem to trust her. She was a person who didn't seem to trust that easily and yet once she learned the truth, her world crumbled because she regarded Seung-Joo as someone who was close to her. Hansaem's trust in his chief and the rest of the members of the police was also qustioned multiple times and of course we see how he learned to trust Ena. 

That being said, as much as I liked this drama and as much as I loved the characters, there are some parts that prevented me from connecting more with it. As others have pointed out, it would have been nice to see how each murder took place. Yes, someone could argue that through Ena's reimaginations of the crimes we can get a sense of how the murder happened but I still wanted to see it from the killer's point of view. What were her thoughts? How did she escape each time without leaving a single trace? How was she able to constantly monitor Ena's steps? And as of Seung-Joo, couldn't a 7 years old remember the name of her mother or the name of her restaurant in order to tell it to the police? How did she end up on the orphanage and why didn't her mother look for her? I think that the story has some plot-holes here and there and although they do not ruin the series, the writers could have thought more to avoid them. 

I also think that the structure of the episodes became too formulaic and predictable. A murder occurred, puzzle gets sent, Ena put the pieces together, case solved for now, moving on. While the murders themselves were different, the way they were presented was kinda monotonous. Thankfully that quickly changed but I still think the structure could have been a little bit better for some episodes.

All in all, I'm so happy for watching Nine Puzzles! I genuinely did not expect to like it as much as I did! I'll make sure to check out other projects with Kim Da Mi and Son Sokku. I would definitely recommend this one for crime enjoyers. It's not groundbreaking but it was pleasant to watch!",41,1754491724.0,kdramas,16,0.94,False

# CHAPTER 4. (NON)EXTRA DETAILS

Listing all the materials that Mafia 2 lost during development is worthy of a separate book. Let's run through the most egregious cases.

The game starts in Sicily during World War II — we are shown a fragment from Vito's everyday life in combat. The mission lasts five minutes, then the action moves to «civilian life» (by the way, about the confusion of the plot).

As it became clear later, 2K Czech planned to devote about an hour to Sicily. To conduct training in all the mechanics there, dividing it into nine short tasks. One of them was called «Call of Duty».

https://preview.redd.it/evx7xwzstehf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=70f908d5ebe2ec714d93170c152917841cb0e7c8

Remember the trinity: the safecracker, the gunsmith, and the junkyard owner? They were responsible for additional missions in the open world. Completing the latter would affect the hero's reputation and give bonuses from a specific employer. A colleague in a dangerous business could be asked, for example, to bring weapons. This explains why Mafia 2 has mechanics using a home phone and phone booths. «You don't know a single number» — this is the message that players saw when picking up the phone in the final version.

Another carelessness is associated with optional activities. If you open the map, and in it the «legend», then in the list of symbols you can see a yellow circle. It marks the «additional task». As you understand, the yellow circle never appears on the map.

[The cover of Mafia 2. The man on the left is the main mystery of the project](https://preview.redd.it/klb6qzfvtehf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3bf01e4b99ab78864f9678e7ab529a82a162ec0c)

Another thing that disappeared in the heat of 2K Czech deadlines was «Beck's Real Estate Agency». In it, the player would buy apartments or houses. Furnish them to his taste.

Public transport (taxi, buses, metro) was also removed. Hairdressers with the ability to change your hairstyle. Gyms where you can learn new moves. Vito's girlfriend, with whom you need to go on dates.

While cutting the game into pieces, the Czechs also sacrificed journalists — they removed the mission «Wheels on Fire», which was demonstrated to the press at Gamescom 2009. Thanks to it, 2K Czech won the «Best Developer» nomination.

Their main trick is the character standing on the left side of the cover. He is nowhere to be found in Mafia 2. Meticulous «hackermen» found a sound file — a cut dialogue between Vito and Joe. Our stout friend mentions a newcomer, he will take him with him to eliminate Tommy Angelo. If the player refuses to take this task.

[Do you recognize him?](https://preview.redd.it/a5a1aexytehf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b1640a11b63b78dcda8fa0c5d2d5eb10e6e7751e)

The ending of the second Mafia looks like a stupid stump for a reason. According to Daniel Vavra, the entire last third of the game has nothing to do with his script. He assumed three possible endings depending on the player's decisions:

* «The Best Time»: Joe dies, Vito rises in the criminal hierarchy;
* «Friends for Life»: Vito saves Joe;
* «Family Business»: Joe dies, Vito quits crime, secretly moves away and opens a pizzeria. It's funny that, hiding from the mafia, he calls the establishment by its real name — «Pizza Scaletta». Its model is still in the game files.

# CHAPTER 5. WHAT'S ABOUT THE FACE?

What do we have as a bottom line? What exactly did 2K Czech offer us to play in 2010?

A half-GTA.

Why is that? Because the key task was to find a balance between the hardcore of «Mafia 1» and modern trends. Even in 2002, some of the gameplay decisions of The City of Lost Heaven were discouraging everyone. And in the second half of the 2000s, **Rockstar Games** was already in full swing — while the Czechs were tinkering with different engines, the competitor released **GTA: Vice City**, **GTA: San Andreas** and the largely revolutionary **GTA IV**.

It was the franchise about the great car thief that 2K Czech took as a reference point.

https://preview.redd.it/px1qqo6buehf1.jpg?width=5120&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=775e1f5c025790e0df1871350ba67e38bcde0b41

The decision backfired. The team was so eager to please casual gamers, to relieve them of the slightest discomfort, to smooth out all the rough edges, that they completely lost the spirit of the original.

It was not a holy ideal, but it cannot be denied — it had its own face. No mini-map and GPS-navigator — this greatly increased immersion, allowing you to remember the city well. No high-speed cars and brainless police — this greatly increased immersion and forced you to follow traffic rules. No health regeneration and frequent autosaves — this greatly increased the tension from shootouts and narrowed your anus.

Thanks to the above, Mafia 1 was etched into memory for years, for decades to come.

[What other story game made you stop on red lights, not speed, and avoid collisions?](https://preview.redd.it/es5d2jhcuehf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=799bbcb37c5271a6cbff76642a6ddea6e705f751)

Unfortunately, Mafia 2 is another Lenten GTA clone. You don't need to learn the city, or follow the traffic rules. In a shootout, take the nearest cover and shoot the stupid enemies.

A separate blasphemy is the diegetic music in the open world. Now it's only on the radio, as Rockstar taught. In the original, the beautiful music of the 30s followed you almost continuously. It literally enveloped you, thickening the fabric of the game world. Not a very realistic approach, but the atmosphere was in full swing.

But 2K Czech did not repeat their own trick and for some reason borrowed the pseudo-documentary style of a direct competitor.

[The protracted development forced the publisher to invest in a series of trailers. One of them turned out to be unusually creative](https://reddit.com/link/1mj6nuv/video/1uyhm5lfuehf1/player)

Another paradox happened with the second Mafia — the Czechs tried their best to keep up with the times, created a technological Illusion Engine, screwed Nvidia Physx to it... and still were late to the party.

Shooting is a prime example. Each trailer for the game advertised advanced destructibility of objects as the central feature of shootouts. They weren't lying: glass breaks, splinters fly, concrete columns crumble. However, the action of Mafia 2 is sorely lacking in speed, drive, tension, and a sense of struggle. There is sluggish dynamics, predictable game design, and rough enemy animations. You are like in a shooting gallery — shoot schematic dummies until they run out.

As a result, the shooting boasts of newfangled destructibility, but does not offer energetic action. The laziness of the creators is clearly noticeable at the beginning of the last mission. A small group of enemies runs towards the player along a narrow corridor — you easily shoot them, holding down the trigger of the machine gun. All that's missing is a cup of coffee, which Vito will leisurely drink while firing.

https://preview.redd.it/x95yugniuehf1.jpg?width=5120&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df8b13f65b5b2dcd1c39c3125db13278671242e8

The high difficulty level affects exactly one parameter — it speeds up our death. The action does not become more exciting and furious, now we just die in half a second in monotonous shootouts. Sometimes, it is not clear from what. You are sitting behind cover, not bothering anyone — the death screen. A quote from a review by a popular Russian blogger **Maddison** is very appropriate:

>*And now the question: what the \*\*\*\* killed me?! \[…\] There wasn't even a sound! No shot, nothing! Maybe Vito had a heart attack? Or was he killed by the fart of a comrade running in front of him?*

[«You shoot like my sister!»](https://preview.redd.it/sm5by9pmuehf1.jpg?width=5120&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f27c962e880cb2dfa6d66fce214ebaea3ebe824e)

Two years before Mafia 2, GTA IV was released — exemplary shooting, with great weapon sounds and groundbreaking body physics. Six months before Mafia 2, **Just Cause 2** was released — a hurricane action cocktail with fun gadgets and luxurious explosions. Three months before Mafia 2, Red Dead Redemption was released — the same cutting-edge body physics and stylish slo-mo. Simply put, in August 2010, there was no reason to shoot as Vito.

While Mafia 1 offered a fundamentally different approach to shooting compared to **GTA 3**, the sequel did not keep up with the action of GTA IV and its contemporaries. You can’t live on destruction alone.

[The warden is voiced by Jason Zumwalt, the voice of Roman Bellic in GTA IV](https://preview.redd.it/xr46ulpouehf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ceee622d0116c899f1cc888917ac482e83474b7e)

The close combat turned out to be completely comical. According to rumors, cold weapons (brass knuckles, knife, crowbar) were cut from the game at the last moment — the team was hastily reworking hand-to-hand fights. They had enough time for an unsightly analogue of a boxing match.

The fights of the second Mafia come down to pressing one of three buttons: light blow, strong blow, dodge. Then, when the opponent is exhausted, we carry out the finishing move — for example, press the left mouse button three times. At the same time, the surrounding world is paused — the fighters do not interact with it in any way. No one will come running to help the opponent. You will not be able to push him anywhere. He will never touch a barrel or a box standing nearby.

It is even more amazing that the monotonous static fights are the only gameplay in one of the chapters. For about 40 minutes, while Scaletta experiences the hardships of life as a prisoner, the player will mindlessly press three buttons. After all, there is nothing to think about.

Even against the background of the aforementioned problems of Mafia 2, its hand-to-hand combat looks like a strange rudiment.

[Dear Hangar 13, If you ever do a full-fledged remake of Mafia 2, please remake Chapter 6](https://preview.redd.it/0xgsi1oruehf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2176c1afdf6384d7cc8dd3d35fc56b675ddb1bb7)

On the other hand, the prison episode somehow stands out among the criminally monotonous missions. Globally, the entire gameplay cycle of the game comes down to the following: we go on a mission, shoot in the corridor, go home to rest. From creativity — we give a lift to a drunk friend who will dirty the interior if you do not stop in time. We throw boxes of cigarettes to our partner from the back of the van, pressing one button. And where would we be without a couple of minutes of single-cell stealth among perfectly placed shelters or enemies with their backs turned.

It seems that at some point there was not a single employee from Illusion Softworks left inside 2K Czech. Mafia 1 constantly threw you something new. Here we are delivering passengers, as befits a real taxi driver. Here we are participating in a difficult race. Here we are sneaking around the estate with a bat in our hands. Here we are waiting on a yacht for the right moment to eliminate the target. Here we are carrying boxes under the guise of a worker so as not to attract unnecessary attention.

Again, some decisions are subject to debate, but the creative courage and freedom that saturated The City of Lost Heaven were no less fascinating than its plot. You never knew what Daniel Vavra would surprise you with next.

There is no need to be surprised in the sequel — everything is sterile here. Both in terms of gameplay and in terms of visuals. Among the locations that you will have to visit, the only thing that enlivens the eye is the planetarium — the last residence of Don Falcone.

https://preview.redd.it/3wrh9gduuehf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa7cb0854833273ca81883aa39991d45e49b617e

In general, the second Mafia creates a feeling of incoherence between game designers and scriptwriters. The gameplay and the plot sometimes do not harmonize at all.

Let's turn to the fifth chapter again. Vito comes to the restaurant to meet with an important authority, hoping to get a place in the Clemente family. The man asks the protagonist if he is ready to kill people on orders. Scaletta answers in the affirmative, explaining his decision by his experience on the fields of World War II. And it seems that the main character is revealed to us, smoothly leading him to the first order of the mafia.

But the drama is ruined by the fact that in the gameplay we have already shot and killed — in the second chapter, when we stole a car from the territory of the enemy gang. Then in the fourth, where the police chased us across the rooftops after the attack on the jewelry store. That is, Vito has already got his hands dirty twice, and we know about it — the scene in the restaurant loses all logic and significance.

https://preview.redd.it/vvltzmnwuehf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bf076a2cc06bc0ad3968334e1b6f9d2e2a29cd1

Example #2 — Tommy Angelo's death.

Vito and Joe drive up to a private home. A stately pensioner is watering the lawn when Dumb and Dumber approach him from behind. Mr. Salieri sends his regards. Our heroes get into the car... and a chase from the police begins!

From the creators' point of view, it is logical to assume that the player will be shocked by such a plot twist. That he needs to be given time to come to his senses. Maybe turn off the radio in the car. But no — let's completely ruin the atmosphere of the moment with some dirty action.

[No matter how much of a scoundrel Tommy was, he hardly deserved to die at the hands of two stupid thugs who didn't even understand who they were killing and why](https://preview.redd.it/8c9a7g00vehf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1f881132bb69eed9b10b30d6afb7ba297ab0f5e)

Once again — what exactly did 2K Czech offer us to play in 2010? A GTA clone with dull shooting, garish close combat and missions in the spirit of «let’s go shoot».

What story did 2K Czech tell us in 2010? An incomprehensible «drama» with bad dialogues. As if written by teenage Scorsese fans. Without taste, without thought, without emotion.

The loss of Daniel Vávra’s firm hand — his creative force, his manic pedantry — hit the team too hard. And the development of technology coupled with pressure from the publisher sentenced Mafia 2 to the death penalty. Just imagine the fever in which it was finished, if they didn’t have time to remove the «You don’t know a single number» caption and the yellow circle from the list of symbols on the map.

# CHAPTER 6. REQUIEM FOR A DREAM

The game's failure is perceived even more bitterly when you see its potential.

The car physics here are excellent — driving around the city is a pleasure. The developers once again scrupulously worked out the iron horses, paying attention to the nuances of their behavior. Engine power, car weight, maximum speed, type of wheels, their size, torque — all this is taken into account by the Illusion Engine. In other words, the Czechs have outdone themselves.

The graphics here are beautiful — they are still pleasing to the eye. When you drive through a metropolis at night in winter and see how the light from the streetlights or oncoming traffic dissipates, you involuntarily doubt that the game is 15 years old. 2K Czech did not work on the engine in vain — in some graphic aspects, the second Mafia defeated time.

Here, every now and then, there are worthy story scenes. Returning home to the song Let it Snow. The sentencing and arrival at the prison, staged as if we were watching a monumental tragedy. The bombing of a skyscraper office under the guise of window cleaners. The brutal massacre of Henry by Chinese thugs. The murder of Tommy Angelo for the purpose of a fleeting profit.

Alas, these are just scattered fragments of a theoretically good game. There are too few of them to glue together into a coherent picture and make Mafia 2 work.

[The arrest and arrival at the prison is perhaps the best scene of the game](https://reddit.com/link/1mj6nuv/video/tgr1ykadvehf1/player)

It's amazing how many ideas and ambitions the Czech team put into their project.

Show Sicily during the Second World War. America in the 40s and 50s, in winter and summer. Imprisonment with a limited open world. Several small groups: Africans, Irish, Chinese. Three large mafia families: Clemente, Falcone, Vinci.

Implement a reputation system. Additional missions from charismatic bandits. Local scenes where the player would help random passers-by. Buying apartments and houses with lots of interactive objects. Instant transition from shooting to close combat and back within any action episode. Dialogue window + choice affecting the ending.

If at least half of the outlined plans had been completed in the final version, Mafia 2 would have become that very «Dream Game». It lived up to all expectations and made my hands tremble at the first launch. It didn't drop the name of its predecessor and proudly stood in line with other hits of 2010.

Perhaps someday **Hangar 13** — the current owners of the franchise — will give us a new Mafia 2. As the remake of the first part showed, they can strain themselves, put their soul into it and do the job, if not brilliantly, then very diligently.

https://preview.redd.it/eec8w78ivehf1.jpg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abe507330d940d30e6d67b6e452ea3ebdaa22a41

Of course, the second Mafia has a nice charm even in this form. Handsome protagonist. His cheerful friend. Atmospheric city. Spectacular destructibility. Several strong episodes.

But a whole bunch of problems and errors, if you remove the veil of nostalgia from your eyes, do not allow you to call the game a success.

A suitable epitaph on its grave would be a quote from **David Semik**, data manager at 2K Czech. Without a good reason, a person would not say something like this during development. Especially, like an advertising campaign, when he must think over every word ten times:

>*During the development of the first Mafia, almost nothing was changed by the publisher \[…\] In the final version, the changes were mostly related to bug fixes rather than cutting game materials. Now, the publisher of Mafia 2 is involved in the development much more than back then. And this, of course, has both its pros and cons.*

# P.S.

According to the franchise lore, Tommy Angelo was born in 1900. At the end of the main plot of Mafia 1, he is 38 years old. Vito and Joe kill him at the age of 51.

Attention question: how did Tommy age so much in 13 years? Why did he turn into a gray-haired, wrinkled old man by the age of 51? As a child, the author of the article was sure that the epilogue of Mafia 1 takes place in the 1980s.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for reading to the end. I hope you found it interesting.

Despite the negative tone of the article, I wrote it with all my heart. The Mafia franchise has been with me for over 20 years. It evokes different emotions, but always very strong ones. I am sure most of you do too.

Share your thoughts in the comments. What do you think of Mafia 2? Have you played the first Mafia? Or was the sequel an introduction to the series? Are you looking forward to The Old Country?

**The goal of true friendship is not to get, but to give; not to be served, but to serve.**

In all of Paul’s letters, we see his eagerness to do good for others, without seeking anything in return. He says, “I seek not what you have, but you.” He didn’t want to be a burden to anyone.

He compared himself to a parent, caring for their children. Parents save up for their children, not the other way around. Paul was happy to spend and be spent for their spiritual growth.

Even though his love wasn’t always appreciated—“the more I love you, the less you love me”—he didn’t stop caring for them. His focus was always on their good.

These are the people who meal prep. Who go to the dentist *before* something hurts. Who keep to-do lists that begin with things like “stretch” and “meditate” and “floss,” rather than “finally throw out the sour cream from 2022.”

Let’s be honest. The only thing more exhausting than doing the thing is listening to someone *suggest* you do the thing. There’s something deeply unsettling about that kind of energy. It’s like being aggressively hugged by a motivational poster.

Now, I’m not saying procrastination is a virtue. I’m just saying it’s more relatable than waking up at 6 a.m. to journal about gratitude. The idea that you must tackle everything immediately, with a crisp shirt and a positive attitude, feels like a psychological pyramid scheme. You can only pretend to be that functional for so long before your left eye starts twitching and your “can-do” spirit turns into a “can-I-not” spiral.

But here’s the thing. The wisdom of “why put off until tomorrow” isn’t wrong. It’s just wildly inconvenient. Because most of the things we put off don’t get smaller with time. They grow. Quietly. Like mold, or conspiracy theories, or your neighbor’s tomato plant that has somehow consumed the entire fence. What starts as one email you didn’t respond to becomes a dozen, and then suddenly you’re telling people you’ve been in a car accident just to justify your inbox.

Complacency is sneaky like that. It wears cozy clothes. It whispers, “You’ve had a long day. You deserve a break. Let’s scroll for ten minutes.” Ten minutes later, you’re watching a video of a raccoon eating grapes with its tiny little hands and you’ve forgotten what year it is. It’s not that you didn’t mean to get things done. You just fell down a hole lined with soft distractions and raccoon content.

And then there’s the system, oh the system, the one that tells you to “just work harder”, reminds you that your medical bill is unpaid, and invites you to rate your experience with a chatbot that did absolutely nothing for you. After enough of this, even brushing your teeth starts to feel like a herculean task.

So yes, complacency is a kind of slow rot. But sometimes it’s also the byproduct of simply being tired. Not lazy-tired, but the kind of soul-fatigue that sets in when every errand feels like an obstacle course designed by a bored trickster god.

Still, there is something deeply satisfying about doing the thing. Even if it’s a small thing. Even if the thing is just calling the mechanic or finally removing the pile of clean laundry from the “chair of eternal indecision.”

It’s not about becoming a productivity robot. It’s about reclaiming a bit of momentum from the vacuum of modern life, where days slip by like lukewarm coffee and suddenly you’re Googling “how to renew a passport when you’ve lost the old one and possibly your identity.”

We don’t need to do *everything* today. Just *something.* Something you’d otherwise hand off to Future You, who, by the way, is not thrilled about the number of open tabs in your life. Future You is already planning a mutiny.

So no, don’t put it off. Do it today. Not because you’re a superhero. But because you’re tired of tripping over that same pair of shoes every single morning and wondering why your life feels vaguely haunted.

Clean stuff up; the clothes, your life, etc.. Answer the emails. Make the calls. Fix that leaky faucet. *Then* reward yourself with a video of a raccoon eating grapes.

## Key Features Analysis

The Carpet Chameleon boasts a range of features that set it apart from traditional carpet cleaning methods.**Advanced Stain Removal Technology:** The Carpet Chameleon utilizes a proprietary enzymatic formula designed to break down and lift even the most stubborn stains. This formula is not only effective on common household spills like coffee and wine but also tackles pet stains, grease, and ink, penetrating deep into the carpet fibers to eliminate the source of the stain and associated odors.

The solution's unique composition ensures that it won't damage or discolor the carpet, making it safe for use on a variety of materials, including wool, nylon, and synthetic blends.

**Color Restoration & Enhancement:** A key feature of the Carpet chameleon is its ability to revitalize faded and discolored carpets.The system includes a color booster that gently restores the original vibrancy of the carpet fibers, effectively reversing the effects of sun exposure and wear.

This isn't a dye or paint; instead, it enhances the existing pigments within the carpet, resulting in a natural-looking restoration. For users seeking more dramatic changes, the Carpet Chameleon offers customizable color tints that can subtly or considerably alter the carpet's appearance to match changing decor or personal preferences.

**Protective Coating Application:** After cleaning and color restoration, the Carpet Chameleon system applies a protective coating to the carpet fibers. This coating acts as a barrier against future stains and spills, making it easier to clean up messes and preventing dirt and grime from embedding deep within the carpet.

The protective coating is also designed to repel liquids, minimizing the risk of water damage and mold growth.The coating is non-toxic and hypoallergenic, ensuring the safety and well-being of occupants, including children and pets.

**Precision Application System:** The Carpet Chameleon system incorporates a precision application system, including a handheld sprayer and a specialized roller. This system ensures even distribution of the cleaning solutions, color boosters, and protective coatings, preventing streaks, blotches, and inconsistencies in the final result.

The sprayer features adjustable settings, allowing users to control the amount of product applied based on the carpet's density and the severity of the stains. The roller is designed with soft, yet durable bristles that gently massage the solutions into the carpet fibers, maximizing their effectiveness.

**Modular Design:** The Carpet Chameleon is designed to be modular, allowing users to purchase only the components they need based on their specific carpet care requirements. This flexible system can accommodate small spot treatments, full room cleanings, and even whole-house transformations.

This modularity also makes the Carpet Chameleon an economical choice, as users can avoid purchasing unnecessary products or tools. Future expansions and upgrades are seamlessly integrated into the existing system, ensuring a long-term investment in carpet care.

## FAQs Section

**Is the carpet Chameleon safe for all types of carpets?**
Yes, the Carpet Chameleon is formulated to be safe for use on a wide variety of carpet types, including wool, nylon, synthetic blends, and even delicate oriental rugs. Though, it's always recommended to test the product on a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure compatibility and prevent any unforeseen reactions.

**How long does it take to see results after using the Carpet Chameleon?**
Results can typically be seen instantly after applying the cleaning solution and wiping away the stain. The color restoration and enhancement effects may take a few hours to fully develop as the product dries and binds to the carpet fibers. The protective coating requires approximately 24 hours to fully cure and provide optimal protection.

**How frequently enough should I use the Carpet Chameleon to maintain my carpets?**
The frequency of use depends on the level of foot traffic and the presence of pets or children. For regular maintenance,it's recommended to use the Carpet Chameleon system every 3-6 months. Though, spot treatments can be applied as needed to address new stains and spills.

**Can the Carpet Chameleon remove old, deeply embedded stains?**
While the Carpet Chameleon is effective on most stains, old and deeply embedded stains may require multiple applications or pre-treatment with a specialized stain remover. The key is to saturate the affected area thoroughly and allow the cleaning solution to penetrate deep into the carpet fibers. Agitating the area with a brush or sponge can also help to loosen the stain.

1mj6bd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CholinergicUrticaria/comments/1mj6bd5/choligernic_urticaria/,Choligernic Urticaria?,"I’m 19 years old and for months now I have been struggling with unbearable “itch attacks” where my whole body(chest, core , legs , arms) get these red bumps that burn and feel like I’m getting stabbed repeatedly. It first started as just getting a little bit itchy once in awhile when it was super warm outside, so I didn’t think much of it. As the year went on it became a very persistent problem that would happen multiple times a day. I have found that it usually happens in warm temperatures, like outside or in a crowded room of people. It especially happens when I get stressed/embarassed, or when I laugh too hard, or even when drinking coffee. Whenever I can feel myself getting anxious my body naturally gets warmer, and along comes this very prickly feeling that will usually start in my arms and then make its way all over my body . I have found that I also tend to anticipate it happening in certain situations such as when I go outside on a very warm day, and this anticipation stresses me out and I break out in hives, causing this prickly feeling that can last up to 30 minutes. It’s like an endless loop and it really has ruined my life. Makes me unable to hit the gym( which I really love) or most physical activities, which really sucks because I enjoy exercising and being outside. It also has really made me paranoid because everytime I’m hanging out with friends or doing something I enjoy and I’m not itchy yet, I tend to get nervous anticipating it, which actually causes it to happen, ruining my day in the process. I understand that in my case, a lot of it seems to be mental, since I tend to overthink or anticipate it a lot. People close to me will sometimes tell me to stop thinking about it and it will probably go away, but honestly how do you stop thinking about something so infuriating and difficult to deal with?? I just want to know if anyone also feels like this and has any advice regarding medications or treatments. This has seriously been the worst possible feeling and I just want my life back before all of this. For reference I live in Canada, so I’m not really sure which medications are available. I’m currently taking Rupatadine(prescribed by doctor) Although I’m not sure it’s working very effectively as I can still get pretty serious “itch attacks”.  It was also prescribed to me very quickly and I don’t really think my doctor listened very closely to the symptoms I was saying as we were in a rush when it happened. I’m very clueless regarding this disease and I’m just looking for some pointers on what people do to manage it and get on with their lives. I also switched to all natural body soap, which I think is helping, but I still get outbursts. Also sorry for the rant I’m just very frustrated with this stupid condition, as I have never had to deal with allergies or anything like that before. 

I’ve also read on this sub that maybe a sudden stop in exercising could cause it? Ive always been a very active guy, played hockey and soccer most of my childhood, and picked up weightlifting around 4 years ago. Although when I started working last summer, I completely stopped going to the gym as I couldn’t find the time for it, and I believe that this is when my symptoms started. Also have been a lot more stressed the past year with school and work , could this be related at all, or just a coincidence?

Retirement: $60,669 in my 401k, and $2,441 in my Roth, the latter of which is mostly company stock besides a tiny portion saved in the Roth component of my 401k

Home Equity: $92k, I purchased my 2 bed/2 bath house, approx 1,100 sq ft in 2020 worth $140k at 3.125% with about 6% down. I scraped the down payment together after my best friend let me rent a room for cheap in her home for 6 months and I saved every penny I could. My twin R moved in shortly after returning from a few years abroad and has been a huge contributor for affordability and helping pay for home projects like fencing in the backyard for our dogs. The house is currently worth about $215k. 

HSA: $4,248

HYSA: $19,642 broken down as $11,400 emergency funds, $3,900 home project/maintenance, $2,500 new car fund, $253 car maintenance, $529 car insurance and registration, $1,060 vet fund, and $0 in vacation fund (RIP). 

Checking 1 (Spending): $351

Checking 2 (Bills/Groceries/Etc): $1,389

Credit Card Debt: $0, paid in full each month

Student Loan Debt: $0, cobbled together a full ride between 21st Century Scholars, my college matching it for room and board, and merit scholarships. This has been one of the  single greatest legs up in my finances and I’m tremendously grateful. My parents were honest with my twin and I from a young age that they could not help us pay for college and encouraged us to find a way. 

Car Loan: $0, paid off my 2018 Buick Encore a couple years ago. I’m going to drive the wheels off this thing before I purchase another, but slowly saving for the down payment. 

Total Net Worth: $ 180,740

Notes: I am single and childfree by choice. I don’t combine finances with my twin R but we do split expenses for the home and share groceries. She makes about $42k as a logistics and shipping admin at a warehouse. 

Section Two: Income 

I’ve been working in financial admin and operations for 5 years (3 with my current investment firm). My starting salary was $38k. Before this I worked in health admin after initially graduating pre med in undergrad with plans to go to medical school. Heavy course load and nearly full time work as a medical scribe was enough to determine that wasn’t for me, so I pivoted to entry level admin jobs like patient registration before I broke out into finance. My first jobs before college were as a part time stable hand for my grandparents ($10 a day lol) and then seasonal work as a farm hand on a melon farm all four summers of high school at minimum wage to buy my first car and pay for school and club expenses. 

Main Job Monthly Take Home:

$2,552 net (this does not include the two 3 paycheck months a year). My base salary is just a little over $49k and I receive monthly, quarterly, and annual bonuses. While not guaranteed obviously, they’ve been fairly regular with predictable amounts. I project that I will make $62k total gross this year. 

Deductions: (Based on $3,786 gross monthly base only, no bonuses)

Taxes (OASDI, Medicare, federal, state & county): $669.60

Pretax: $302.88 401k, $25.84 dental, $61.54 HSA, $64.62 medical insurance, $9.10 vision

Pet expenses: $120 (average)

Sinking Funds: $100 

Other Savings: $350 minimum, with bonuses and the two “extra” paychecks a year mostly going to savings, the latest home repair,  or extra retirement contributions.

Donations: Nothing regular but I’ll frequently contribute to local food drives and requests for supplies from the animal shelter. 

Section Four: Money Diary

Day 1-Friday

5:30 AM-As usual, B, my husky/german shepherd mix dog cries for breakfast before my alarm goes off. I sleepily stomp through the kitchen to R’s room to let her cattle dog mix, S, out as well to feed them both and let out into the backyard to potty. All three of us then climb back into my bed to snooze. 

7:10 AM-I reluctantly get out of bed for a quick breakfast of oatmeal before showering and getting ready for work. I do a basic skincare routine (no makeup), make my bed, and fold a load of laundry. 

8:10 AM-I drive my five minute commute to the office. At some point I’d like to get an e-bike to ride to work on nice days, as there is a walking trail that runs the entire distance to the office. For now, I make it to work before the AC even begins to cool down my car on this hot, muggy morning. 

1:00 PM-I take my hour lunch break and head back to WFH the rest of the afternoon to wait for the appliance technician to return to fix our washer. A few weeks ago it started to rattle badly on the spin cycle with even small loads. After one incident where the washer threatened to walk out of my laundry room, I decided to get it looked at about a week ago. The tech confirmed some of the bearings and brackets on the drum are coming apart and ordered the parts to complete the actual repair today. Estimate is $463 including labor. After a cost benefit analysis, R and I decide to go ahead and repair vs buying new. I pay the tech after he spends 3 hours completing the fix and hope the washer will last another 5 years. ($463, but pulling from savings and R will reimburse me later for half). 

7:00 PM-I let the dogs out for one last potty break, pack, and drive down to my grandparents’ house almost 2 hours away in rural Southern Indiana to spend the night for a visit. I stop for a quick burger at McDonald’s ($3.19) and top off my gas tank on the way ($24.33). Our mom is already there for a long weekend after flying up from Florida. R also stayed there for a couple days as she works Saturday through Tuesday. We pass each other at some point on the interstate as she drives back home. This works great as B has reactivity issues with small dogs like Grandad’s tiny Pomeranian, P, so I can’t bring her with me. I run over and accidentally kill a rabbit about a mile away from the grandparents, pulling over briefly on the highway shoulder to check for tire damage. My car is fine, so I proceed on while feeling guilty for the bunny. 

11:30 PM-Finally head to bed after arriving and catching up with everyone. Mom and I share the guest bed and I toss and turn most of the night, already missing my own bed and dog. 

Daily Total: $490.52

Day 2-Saturday

7:00 AM-I get up for a breakfast of toast and coffee with Grandma. I let P out to potty, keeping an eye out for chicken hawks that may mistake her for prey while petting the farm dog, N, after she runs up the porch to greet me after a swim in the pond (she’s very stinky). I then sneak in a few hours of studying for the SIE with Grandma for company while Mom and Grandad sleep in. I’m nervous for my exam scheduled in a few days. 

12:00 PM-My cousin visits from his house nextdoor with his family and newborn son. Grandma fixes an amazing lunch of breaded tenderloin, freshly picked sweet corn, macaroni salad, and green beans. I wash it down with a glass of sweet tea and then join the family back on the porch to swap stories and catch up some more. 

6:00 PM-Mom asks me to drive her to the next town over to visit her best friend J, who orders pizza to share with us for dinner. I stop at a gas station on the way to buy a couple of sodas for us ($4.64). 

8:30 PM-We drive back to the grandparents, swinging by my Aunts house. I sit by her pool for a while with my feet in the water while my mom chats away. My social batteries are near zero at this point. 

9:45 PM-I stubbornly start the drive back home after a long Midwestern goodbye, citing an early start tomorrow for yard work and more cramming for the SIE. I arrive shortly before midnight and receive a very enthusiastic greeting from B, who proceeds to kneecap me with her chew toy. R and S are already in bed after her 12 hour shift (she also works 5 minutes from home and came back during breaks to take care of the dogs). B then curls up in bed next to me and I quickly fall asleep, happy to be home. 

Daily Total: $4.64 

Day 3-Sunday 

5:30 AM-Same morning routine as Friday with the addition of a 30 minute walk with the dogs.

9:00 AM-I drag the electric push mower out of the shed and mow my 0.25 acre yard. The temperature still quickly climbs to the 90s so I take frequent breaks. I finish up and do the weedeating before jumping in the shower to wash the swass off. 

11:00 AM-After a quick nap with the dogs, I grab a Gatorade from the fridge and drive to the library to use the study room I reserved. I take a practice SIE test. I score 86% and feel more confident about my chances for passing. I spend the rest of my study time reviewing the wrong answers and memorizing formulas. 

3:00 PM- I pick up Indian takeout on the way home ($24.06) before spending the rest of the day catching up on laundry and playing Death Stranding 2 in between games of fetch with the dogs, heading to bed around 10:00 PM.

Daily Total: $24.06 

Day 4-Monday

This day is completely uneventful besides work, my usual lunch hour at home with the dogs, and a couple more hours cramming for the SIE. I also dremel B’s nails so she spends the rest of the evening pouting and grumpy. I go to bed early at 9:00 PM to try to get extra rest before tomorrow. 

Daily total: $0

Day 5-Tuesday

8:00 AM-It’s Exam Day! After the same usual weekday morning routine, I decide to treat myself to breakfast at McDonald’s on the way to work, ordering a sausage McMuffin and a large Diet Coke ($4.56). 

10:30 AM-After leading our biweekly team meeting and receiving wishes for good luck from my coworkers, I head out of the office for the hour drive to the testing center. 

12:30 PM-I passed!! I message my teammates and supervisors who congratulate me. I practically skip back to my car and drive home to take the rest of the day off. I microwave a frozen dinner and proceed to take a 4 hour nap, which classifies as a “naptastrophe”. R returns home after a shorter shift and continues to let me rot in bed while she hangs with the pups and watches K dramas. 

Daily Total: $4.56

Day 6-Wednesday

Same workday morning routine, with a 20 minute walk with the dogs while R sleeps in. I resist the urge to lay on the hardwood kitchen floor with S and B afterwards and opt for a shower instead. It’s another miserably hot morning. I then head to work and have another uneventful workday catching up on tasks and callbacks for clients. I request study materials for the Series 7 which is the next test I’ll sit for. I’ll get a raise and a title change after completing it and the Series 66 so I’m really trying to keep the momentum going on studying. I block more study room reservations at the library for the next few weeks’ study sessions during work hours approved by my supervisor before heading home at my usual clock out at 4:30 PM (I work 37 hours a week). 

5:00 PM-Arrive at Meijer for my pickup order including chicken salad, crackers, apples, tampons, toothpaste, hand soap, canned tomatoes, onions, chicken broth, corn, white vinegar, Windex, lens wipes, cottage cheese, Diet Pepsi, pistachios, premade protein shakes, bottled water, and a rotisserie chicken. The total comes to $99.23. I also stop by the pet store and pickup a bag of kibble which adds up to another $82.56 (R will reimburse me for half). I head home and unload everything. R has been home all day to start her usual 3 day weekend and reports she has already played with the dogs and caught up on chores. She also picked up more soda and bottled water at Costco to stock up ($25 my half). 

I eat chicken salad and crackers for dinner while she packs up and heads out to stay with a friend overnight. They are going to GenCon tomorrow. I hate crowded places so happy to stay home instead. I enjoy a quiet evening reading and working on this money diary. I also finally budget out last Friday’s paycheck and confirm all bills are paid for the month. R sent me her half earlier. 

10:30 PM-I put S and B to bed and go to sleep listening to an audiobook. 

Daily total: $206.79

Day 7-Thursday

5:05 AM-Wake up to the dogs whimpering and  frightened by a storm. It’s not severe, but very loud with lots of thunder and lightening. Our lights flicker a couple times. The girls refuse to go outside, so I give them breakfast and hope the storm rolls out before I go to work. Lay back down for a bit while S stomps on me and lays across my chest for comfort (she’s 45 lbs). The storm lets up right before I head out, so I gratefully let them out to potty and make it to work at 8:20 AM. 

8:30 AM-I work on scheduling clients while R and our friend M send pictures of M’s baby at GenCon. I also get access to my online course for the Series 7 and print out my study schedule. I get a reminder in my work email that the incentive program for my medical insurance premium credit is due soon and now requires a doctor to approve the yearly medical screen results. I message my doctor to ask to meet sometime this month. She texts back and says she’s free anytime the next few weeks. I set a time for next week and move on to the rest of my tasks for the day. 

12:00 PM-Have a productive lunch hour folding laundry and other chores at home. I spend a few minutes on the deck with the dogs enjoying the breeze, a cold front has finally came through and it’s a blissful 69 degrees. After the dogs head back in, I pick up some soft tacos at Taco Bell on the way back to work and eat at my desk ($7.77).

4:30 PM-Head home and spend most of the evening back outside reading a book in my deck chair. I watch the dogs frolic and wrestle in the backyard. We also take a long walk through the neighborhood. For dinner I make a pot of chicken tortilla soup. 

11:00 PM-Spend way too much time scrolling on my phone before finally falling asleep.  

Weekly Totals: 

Home Maintenance: $463

Groceries: $124.33

Transportation: $24.33

Pet: $82.56

Total Weekly Spend: $738.34 

Reflection: While the washer wasn’t a typical expense, I’m frequently spending money on some kind of repair so I barely blink at anything under $500 anymore haha. This is why I prioritize saving to my sinking and emergency funds since I don’t make enough to easily cash flow in a typical pay period. Otherwise, my spending was pretty typical this week though I often spend more on eating out. I’ve been struggling to rein this in so I’m considering going back to cash envelopes for my spending money since that’s the biggest weak spot in sticking to my budget. I also need to get back into meal planning as I’ve gotten pretty lazy this summer. R and I typically take turns planning and buying groceries for half a week at a time since both of us change our minds frequently on what we want to eat, which works well for us. This was my first money diary so I also now understand how much work goes into creating these and appreciate everyone else that shares.

I still don’t understand why Kolkata fails to protect the voices of the past. The pubs and restaurants of Park Street, the buildings of Esplanade, Ripon Street, Dalhousie Square, the serpentine alleys of North Kolkata, all seem to be undergoing a prolonged period of decadence. But instead of addressing, excuses like “It’s part of Nostalgia” is being overused, giving rise to questions like, do we care? Like, the Indian Coffee House, an institution that has been there for 83 years (Albert hall for 149 years). Whenever someone criticises the food, there’s a hue and cry from an ‘intellectual’ section of the society, using phrases like, ‘It’s ours, deal with it or leave.’ 

One of the few most cosmopolitan cities of its days, Kolkata has opened its arms to whoever has arrived in the city in search for a better life, be it the Chinese, Parsis, the Baghdadi Jews, the Armenians, the Greeks, the Portuguese, who have in later times called it their home and have done their best to add a piece of their culture to it, that has completely stopped in recent times.

How many of us are aware about the strong roots on which our city is based? We could have done so much, organising proper history walks, photo walks, literary meets, to make people aware of the city’s rich glorious past. But the indifference is appalling.

Let’s hope the future will be kind to কল্লোলিনী তিলোত্তমা।

Not up to anything next weekend if you’d like to go for a coffee or something. I responded saying "" that sounds nice and hope they have a good time and to let me know what he wants to do.

one trick that blew my mind was active listening. instead of planning my next line, I just focused on their words body language tone n it worked. mirroring they posture or repeating a key phrase (""you said u love hiking?"") make them feel heard and they open up.

asking open-ended questions was game changer. ditch ""did u have good weekend?"" try ""what was highlight of weekend?"" suddenly they share stories not just yes/no crap, n u got real convo material to build on.

storytelling transforms chat. once i shared a 10 sec tale bout freezing at coffee shop then joking with barista and ppl actually laughed. vulnerability + humor = instant connection feels real.

body language is silent secret weapon. i used to cross arms look at floor  classic ""go away"" vibes. then i uncross, lean in, keep chest open n ppl mirror me back. convos flow even before i talk.

I also learned small affirmations r gold. ""thats a great point"" or ""i hadn think of it that way"" cost nothing but boost rapport big time.

every night I jotted one line I wish I said better n one line that went good. this nightly micro-reflection help spot patterns like when I ask ""what u enjoy most about that?"" chats go deeper.

finally i embraced pauses. i used to talk fast fill silence, now i pause after they speaks, let words sink in before reply. silence feel powerful and ppl often fill it with more insights.

Let’s be respectful :) I’m also strictly monogamous!

**Who I’m looking for:**

* located somewhere in Europe (northern Europe would be great but not expected)
* someone who’s around my age, so 25-30
* a long-term romantic partner, a life partner even
* since I’m ace, someone with a low drive/needs, or perhaps you’re ace as well
* someone who wants to eventually settle down, but doesn’t want kids

**Who I am:**

* 27 years old (1998)
* born and raised in Finland
* atheist and a progressive person with liberal views (leftie, feminist, pro-choice, ally…)
* childfree
* chubby and short (160cm), some small tattoos but I dream of a full sleeve
* short dark brown hair (but I change it up often, it’s been green, blue, purple…)
* don’t smoke or drink at all
* introverted and shy, but once I get comfortable I become a sarcastic little demon
* urban girl, love the buzz of big cities, culture, museums, coffee shops, shopping etc.
* also enjoy staying at home with my favourite tv show
* into fashion, photography, k-pop, anime, writing, reading, traveling
* dog person but sadly allergic :(
* sports and games are not my thing so I’m not sporty or nerdy, but a secret third thing

**Dealbreakers**/ **Big** **NOs for me:** 

* right-wing views
* racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, any bigotry overall
* drugs, smoking, drinking a lot
* severe mental health problems (no ill meaning, I’m simply a sensitive person who usually carries other people’s troubles way too much, and it can get too heavy)",0,1754490219.0,r4r,1,0.33,False

Knitting 
Weaving
Crochet
Needlepoint
Quilting
General crafts

I did find a few quilt and painting options but they were more geared towards very beginner with preset designs and I don’t like spending time on projects I just don’t want to keep later.
