THE ONES I COULD’VE BEEN


Night still clung to the condo.

The city outside buzzed faintly, but here, on the 5 th floor, it felt like the air belonged only to him.

Bastien stood alone, breath heavy, ribs aching with the afterglow of too many days without release. 

Not the kind his body begged for in idle hours, but the sacred kind.

The Archive was stirring again, whispering at the seam beneath his ribs, demanding birth.

It wasn’t indulgence. 
It was necessity.

If he didn’t summon, the pressure would tear him from the inside.

He lit no candles. 
He needed no music. 

The condo itself thrummed with resonance, walls alive with glyphs that pulsed in time with his chest.

Bastien exhaled, long and low.

His cock was already full, weighty, blood-rich. 

He knew what came next. 

What always came next.

“Pour le travail sacré,” he whispered.

For the sacred work.

He stripped the last of his clothes, knees bending onto the velvet rug at the condo’s heart.

His hand closed slow around himself, stroking not from fantasy, not from hunger,
but alignment.

The seam beneath his ribs flared.
And the ritual began.

The seam unzipped with a hiss of light. 

From armpit to hip it spread, glowing like dawn through a crack in the world. 

His body arched, a moan pulled deep from his ribs.

And then, he split.

A thigh, slick with sweat and light, slid out of him like silk skin peeled from its twin. 

A ribcage pressed. 
A shoulder curved.

Then a whole body, radiant and wet with birth-glow, butterflied from his side.

Deux.

Not crawling, not reaching.
Already tangled with him.

Already gripping his cock, stroking in rhythm as if he’d been there all along.

The seam pulsed again.

Bastien’s hips bucked. 

The light opened wider.

Another body spilled through, sliding free of him like a sculpture cut from heat.

Trois.

And his hand was not idle, it was already wrapped around Deux’s shaft, jerking him off as Deux stroked Bastien. 

A chain.

The seam burned hotter. 

Bastien gasped. 

Sweat rolled down his sternum.
Another groan, another unzip of golden light,

Quatre.

He tumbled out laughing, tangled legs wrapping both Deux and Trois, his hand gripping Bastien’s shaft just above Deux’s this time.

Four identical cocks stroked, thick and swollen, four hands pumping, slick with sweat and pre-cum.

The room was electric, and smelled of sex and ozone. 

Sacred. 
Charged.

The last seam split, glow blinding light now.

Cinq.

He slid out smooth, like a panther born mid-stretch, already his hand wrapped around Quatre’s cock while his other hand was now gripped around Bastien’s base. 

He smirked, stroking with perfect rhythm as though he’d rehearsed it for centuries.

Five bodies. 
One circuit.

Each cock in another’s hand.
Each breath synced.

Each moan feeding the next.

They came together, literally and metaphysically.

Light. 
Pulse. 
Semen. 

Breath. 

Ignition flooding across skin and tile.

The orgasm wasn’t just release.

It was birth. 
Sacred ignition.

The glow dimmed slowly. 

Their chests rose together. 
Their legs were still tangled.

Their hands slid free one by one.

And when silence returned, Bastien stood. 

Sweat cooling, cock soft but glowing with aftercurrent.

Four reflections mirrored him.

Bare-chested. 

Alive. 

Still humming with resonance.

“Christ d’épais,” Bastien muttered, wiping a sheen of cum from his hip with a hand towel.

“Jésus, bande d'enfoirés... vous finissez plus dur que moi.”
(Jesus, you fuckers… you finish harder than me.)

“’Cause we’re pure rhythm,” Trois called out, laughing, still sprawled bare-ass on the sheepskin throw. 

“All juice, no filter.”

“Because you bring us forth in heat,” Deux said gently, eyes still shut. 

“We emerge where you burn brightest.”

“Merde,” Quatre said, glancing toward the door. 

Bastien’s chest heaved, sweat cooling, the room still charged with the thick tang of ozone and seed.

He wiped his ribs, heart pounding, and for a beat he thought - I should clean this place, open the windows, reset the air.

Too late. 

The knock came. 

Three sharp raps.

Not rushed. 
Not timid.

They all froze.
A knock.

“It’s him.”

Kai.

Trois dove behind the couch, grabbing a towel and dragging it clumsily across his groin.

Deux stood calmly, exhaling as he vanished down the hallway like smoke.

Quatre gave one slow nod, disappeared into the guest bath.

Bastien snatched the same hand towel the echos had used, swiping fast - under his cock, across his palms, around his wrists.

The same towel they'd used a dozen times before.

He tossed it toward the hamper.

Didn’t notice the small pearl still hanging on his knuckle.

He opened the door.

Kai.

Linen shirt, chest half unbuttoned, dark slacks pressed razor-sharp, skin sunlit even in shadow. 

Something timeless behind the eyes.

Bastien’s heart kicked like it always did around him.

They shook hands.

And the universe shifted.

Bastien had opened the door expecting to feel proud, relaxed, maybe even smug. 

He’d just cum hard enough to split dimensions. 

His body still glowed from it. 
His pants still heavy with proof.

Kai stepped in, linen shirt half-open, pressed slacks sharp, skin golden even in shadow. 

Bastien’s chest tightened.

He reached out, warm and easy, their palms clasping like brothers.

The handshake carried more than heat.

Bastien didn’t see the faint pearl of cum still clinging to his knuckle. 

It pressed into Kai’s palm as they gripped.

Kai’s body reacted before his mind did.

A subtle charge. 

His cock twitched, thickening.

Confusion flared. 
The air felt damp, electric.

Without thinking, he lifted his hand, brushed under his nose.

The trace smeared just beneath his lip.

The scent bloomed.

Salt.
Metal.
Skin.
Alive.

Instinctively, he licked his lips.

Just a nervous tick, barely conscious.

His cock swelled, urgent, but it wasn’t lust that drove it, it was confusion.

Kai was visibly aroused, though not in the way anyone would expect.

He didn’t understand it.

Couldn’t.

His body moved faster than his mind, betraying him, answering a signal he couldn’t even name.

And that was enough.

The taste struck him.

Warm. 

Metallic. 
Saline. 
Sweet.

A pulse of life on his tongue.

Kai stiffened. 

His pupils narrowed. 
His chest rose too fast.

The Archive surged in him, wet, electric, undeniable.

Bastien only grinned, mistaking it for his presence.

“Tabarnak, mon gars,” he chuckled, glancing down at the hard line in Kai’s pants. 

“You gettin’ hard just shakin’ my hand?”

Kai didn’t move. 
He was already hard. 

Thick in his pants. 

Full. 

Not because of desire, at least, not that kind. 

But because the Archive was speaking.

Through the scent.
Through the touch.

Through cum.

“Shit,” Bastien added, eyes flicking casually to the front of Kai’s slacks. 

“Don’t worry, bro. 
I get that too. 
You built like me, hein? 

Big guys don’t hide well.”

Then the tap.

“That brotherly, confident, utterly inappropriate Bastien tap, two fingers, a subtle nudge lifting the weight of Kai’s girth.”

“Respect,” he grinned. 

“Let ’em know what you got.”

Kai froze. 

His cock jerked under the touch, swelling harder against the fabric. 

Heat flushed through him so fast it made his vision blur. 

He didn’t understand why his throat felt tight, why his chest rose too quick, why the taste on his lips seemed to thrum all the way down into his groin.

He should have laughed it off, maybe even tapped Bastien’s bulge back the way guys sometimes did, turning it into a joke. 

The thought flashed hot and reckless, but he froze. 

Because he didn’t know why he was hard. 

Didn’t know why his own cock pulsed so heavy while his eyes caught, for just a second, the weight straining Bastien’s pants forward.

Instead, his body betrayed him, rooted to the spot, skin hot, cock throbbing against the press of those two fingers.

He swallowed the metallic-sweet taste still blooming in his mouth and nodded stiffly, wide-eyed, utterly at a loss.

Inside the condo, the scent hung thick.

Not dirty, but ancient.

Like something ritual had touched.

Sweat and cedar.
Clove.

Bastien’s cologne.
And something else.

Kai’s senses flared.

His skin prickled.
His pulse stuttered.

He felt more than one heartbeat.

And then - 

The Echoes emerged.

Dressed now, or at least partially. But that wasn’t what froze him.
It was their faces.

Not strangers. 
Not twins.

Bastien.

Four of him.

The same wide shoulders.
The same curl of hair falling across the brow.

The same weight in the chest, the same presence that filled a room.

But each one moved differently, stood differently, like a chord broken into notes.

Kai’s mouth went dry. 

His body reacted before his mind caught up.

Shock, yes.

But layered with something else, something primal.

It wasn’t just seeing Bastien four times over.

It was the impossible recognition, the way each set of eyes seemed to already know him, to claim him.

His cock pulsed hard in his slacks, and Kai’s throat bobbed with a swallow.

He couldn’t look away.

Deux -- The Philosopher Flame

Dressed in slate linen pants, no shirt, a crystal of labradorite hanging from his neck. 

His posture was regal without trying, his body a temple of calm muscle and inward fire.

“You shine in places others fear to look,” Deux said, stepping forward. 

His voice was slower than Bastien’s. 

Lower. 

Like midnight thinking.

Kai felt the truth in it.

“You feel it, non?” 
Deux said. 

“That we’ve been near you before. 

We just wore different names.”

His hand brushed Kai’s shoulder.
There was nothing sexual in it.
But Kai’s cock throbbed again.

Because his body wasn’t just reacting to touch.

It was reading.

The Archive ran through him like a tuning fork, and the frequencies pouring off Deux lit him up from the inside.

The cum Bastien carried wasn’t just release, it was code. 

And Kai’s body, without him even knowing how, translated it.

Every brush of skin.
Every trace of scent.

Every pulse of resonance in the air.

His system absorbed it all.
His nerves answered in flesh.

He was feeling more than presence.

He was feeling timelines.

Futures.
Unlived lives.

Deux bowed slightly, then stepped back.


Trois — The Pulse

Basketball shorts, hoodie open, gold chain heavy.

He moved like a boxer with a dancer’s bounce, loose and easy.

The fabric of his shorts didn’t bother to hide much; every shift of his hips made the weight behind them sway.

He adjusted himself casually, the way athletes did, with no shame at all, like his body was just another part of the conversation.

“Yo, you want a beer?” he asked, already tossing one with a grin.

“We just finished a workout session. Sort of.”

“You smoke?” he added, lighting a fat joint with a smile that could melt drywall.

“Only sacred things though. Promise.”

He leaned back against the counter, smoke curling around his head. 

The air near him carried a different heat, musk and sweat laced with cedar, something primal.

Kai caught it, sharp in his senses. 

Not foul. 
Not overwhelming. 

Just alive.

“We’re not copies,” Trois said, voice smooth.

“We’re the versions of Bastien he never had time to be.

And we like being alive.”

Quatre -- The Guard

Combat boots, utility pants, no shirt. 

His body was cut in angles. 

He looked like he belonged in a war film. 

A line of ritual scars crossed his chest like constellations. 

His stare was cold, but it held a strange familiarity.

He didn’t speak.
Just nodded once.

Kai understood.

Bastien stood near the kitchen island, arms crossed.

Watching.
Waiting.

Nervous -- but proud.

“So, uh… yeah,” he said finally, voice rougher than he meant.

“I jerked off. 
Real hard. 

Like… ancient level. 
Hit the right frequency.”

He paused, then gestured toward the others with an open palm.

“Boom. 
These are the results.”

He laughed once, but it didn’t land like a joke. 

His eyes flicked toward Kai, searching, measuring.

“You think I’m kidding, but… this isn’t just me getting off. 

The Archive, it’s in me now. 

It’s been changing me. 

Every time I breathe, it’s like it’s tuning me, pushing me closer to… this.”

He nodded toward the Echoes.

“They’re not accidents. 
They’re not fantasies. 

They’re the lives I never had time to live. 

The Archive remembers them, and through me…” He exhaled, shaking his head, chest still glowing faintly beneath the skin.
 
“…through me, it brings them back.”

For the first time, Bastien’s grin faltered.

 His voice softened.

“I didn’t choose this, Kai. 

I just… aligned. 

And the Archive split me.”

The Echoes stood behind him, silent but undeniable. 

Four bodies, four heartbeats, each humming in the same rhythm as his.

“And now,” Bastien said, swallowing hard, “I’m not just me anymore. 

I’m us. 

And the Archive isn’t done.”

---

Kai’s throat had gone dry.

He wanted to laugh it off, make some dumb crack about “magic jerk-offs” or how Bastien always had to outdo everyone. 

That’s what best friends did.

That was safe.

But he couldn’t.

His chest was tight. 

His cock still throbbed from the taste blooming under his lip. 

And all he could think was: 
This is my brother.

The guy who bought him beers, dragged him to ball games, teased him about Jaxx. 

And now - now he stood glowing, ribs humming with ancient glyphs, four identical versions of himself standing like living proof of something Kai didn’t have words for.

He should’ve felt fear. 
He should’ve felt distance.

Instead, he felt heat.

The Archive in him stirred, recognition, not confusion. 

It wasn’t just Bastien who had changed. 

It was Kai. 

His body was reacting, reading, tuning to the frequency without his consent.

He’s not just my best friend anymore, Kai realized, pulse hammering. 

He’s the vessel. 

And I… I’m supposed to know what to do with that.

Kai blinked again. 

He looked at each echo.

Then back at Bastien.

“You mean…”

“Yep,” Bastien said, grinning. 

“I cum. 
They come out.”

Trois wheezed with laughter.

Deux closed his eyes as if accepting a sacred truth. 

Quatre didn’t flinch.

“You made people by - ?” 

Kai began.

“ - jerkin’ it,” Bastien confirmed.

“Don’t look so shocked. 

We all do it.

I just… do it better.”

The Bonding and the Secret

They circled the coffee table.

Deux lit the incense.

Trois lit the joint.

Quatre lit nothing, but stayed posted near the window, ever-watchful.

Kai took the beer Trois had tossed earlier, opened it, and sat low on the sunken couch—between Deux’s poised stillness and Bastien’s radiant, towering presence.

For a while, nobody spoke. 

The silence wasn’t awkward. 

It was reverent. 

Something had shifted. Something had opened.

Trois took the first hit.

“Mmm,” he exhaled. 

“Bastien grows his own. 
From seed. 
In moonlight.”

“Je parle à mes plantes,” Bastien admitted, half-smiling. 

“I whisper. 
They respond. 
Good boys.”

Kai tried not to laugh. 

It was all so absurdly sincere.

“You call your plants ‘boys’?” he asked.

“Everything I grow is masculine,” Bastien replied. 

“Even my tomatoes got big balls.”

Trois choked on the next pull, laughing. 

Kai shook his head, smiling despite himself.

The joint passed. 

Kai inhaled.
And everything slowed.

The room fractured.

Not in fear. 
Not in harm. 

Just… opened.

As if time made room for all the Bastien that had ever wanted to be. 

They weren’t echoes. 

Not copies. 
Not hallucinations.

They were facets. 

Shards. 

Full human stories birthed from one original spark.

Kai saw them for what they were, not copies, not illusions, but living facets of one current. 

And as the scent still lingered under his lip, as the faint salt and seed of Bastien’s code bled deeper into his tongue, he realized he wasn’t just looking.

He was downloading.

Their frequencies poured through him like smoke on the wind - and what came through was richer than sight. 

It was memory. 
Lineage. 

Bloodlines stretching backward into ancestors Bastien had never spoken of, but who now burned bright inside Kai’s marrow.

Anyone the Archive drew near him was meant to be there.

Connected. 
Necessary. 

Written into the weave.

Deux - The Philosopher Flame.

A man of silence and law, who once fasted forty-nine days just to hear what the void whispered back. 

His body was honed like scripture, his touch neither hunger nor denial but alignment itself. 

He carried logic like fire in a lamp, steady, unwavering.

Kai felt the frequency in his ribs - precise, searing - and knew he could wield that same clarity without end.

Trois — The Pulse.

Rhythm made flesh. 

He moved like music, half fighter, half dancer, every gesture syncopated with some greater beat. 

He was healer and hustler both, a man who left places better than he found them, even when he never stayed. 

His aura rolled outward like a tide - warm, insistent, irresistible.

Kai tasted it in the back of his throat - pulse, breath, heat - and realized his own body carried that rhythm by nature.

Quatre — The Guard.

A weapon that never broke.

Ritual scars crossed his chest like constellations, each one a vow, each one a gate he had passed through and returned from. 

His stare was cold, unyielding - but beneath it lay a devotion so fierce it could only be coaxed by trust. 

Protection was not his instinct; it was his essence.

Kai felt it settle across his skin like armor - and with it came the knowing: he had always been shield and sword both.

Cinq — The Voice.

Velvet and voltage. 

A man who could walk into any room and rewrite its gravity. 

His charm was not surface; it was sorcery. 

He bent narrative the way others bent metal, every smile a spell, every quip a shift in orbit.

Kai inhaled him and tasted the weight of influence, the truth that stories themselves bent around him - and that his own voice could shake nations if he ever chose to speak fully.

----

And as each Echo moved, spoke, or even breathed, Kai realized the Archive wasn’t just showing him Bastien’s divisions. 

It was reminding him of himself.

One ocean. 
Five shores.

But the tide wasn’t Bastien’s alone.

It was already his.

Each of them was Bastien.
Each of them wanted to meet Kai.

The frequencies still hummed in his chest, circulating downward, coiling like current until it pooled at his root. 

Energy pressed against his prostate, hot and insistent, each Echo’s signature folding into him as strands of deep indigo light.

Kai could see it - their emergence, the way they’d butterflied out of Bastien’s body, tangled, stroking, charging each other alive. 

He hadn’t been there for the ritual, but he knew it now, like a dream uploaded into his marrow.

His throat worked. 

He should have kept quiet.

Should have asked about the Archive.

Instead, his mouth betrayed him.

“So…” Kai swallowed, cheeks flushing. 

“Do you… like… jerk them out one at a time, or are you guys… jerking each other off?”

Silence. 

A beat.

Then Bastien barked out a laugh, loud and unashamed.

Everyone froze.

“Mon tabarnak, I was wondering how long before you asked.”

Trois stood, mock-offended.

“You think I need help? 
Look at this thing.”

He tugged the waistband of his shorts just enough to show the outline.

“It’s a one-man job.”

Deux finally opened his eyes, unimpressed.

“Idiot. 
It’s not your job. 
It’s his.”

He nodded toward Bastien Prime.

“One cock, five hands. 

Don’t forget where you came from.”

Quatre snorted, arms crossed.

“Exact copy, frère. 
You flex, we all flex. 
Don’t pretend it’s special.”

Trois’s smirk faltered, just for a beat, before he puffed his chest again.

“Still looks better on me.”

That broke the room. 

Bastien barked out a laugh. 
Even Quatre’s lips twitched.

Kai laughed too, though his cheeks burned. 

And before he could stop himself, he glanced at Trois - then winked.

“It is impressive, though,” he admitted softly.

Trois beamed, victory reclaimed.
Bastien groaned. 

“Tabarnak, don’t encourage him…”

The rhythm deepened. 

Joints half-finished. 

The room glowing.

Kai leaned back, smoke curling from his lips, and his eyes drifted toward the corner. 

A towel lay there, crumpled, half-forgotten. 

Something about it tugged at him.

His eyes drifted, half-unconscious, to the corner. 

A crumpled towel lay there, ordinary and unimportant, yet for some reason, it tugged at him.

He didn’t even mean to ask, not really. 

The words slipped out before he could stop them, more instinct than thought.

“That towel…” he said slowly, tilting his head. 

“Who used it? 
What’s on it?”

Four heads turned.

Bastien froze.

They hadn’t mentioned the towel.
They hadn’t mentioned what it carried.

Kai shifted, cheeks warm. 

He wasn’t sure why he’d even asked. 

It was just, he kept catching it.

That scent. 

Salt and skin, metallic and alive.

The air felt thick with it, like smoke you could taste. 

His mind reached for something to blame. 

The towel seemed… obvious.

Deux’s voice broke the silence, smooth as stone.

“I told him a few things. 
You know how I get.”

Bastien exhaled. 

Shoulders eased.

Kai met Deux’s gaze, sheepish, and tried to laugh it off. 

But curiosity still buzzed in his chest, louder than the smoke.

Deux smiled faintly.

“We all get to keep secrets, n’est-ce pas?”

Laughter rose, shaking the weight from the air.

But Kai’s cheeks still burned.

Not from smoke.
Not from shame.

From something closer.
Something he hadn’t yet named.

The tension cracked. 
They all laughed again.

But Kai’s cheeks were flushed.

Not just from smoke.

From knowing.



------

The laughter settled into something quieter. 

Not silence, but kinship.

Deux stepped away and began folding blankets with slow reverence, as if the space required resetting. 

Trois was telling a ridiculous story about the time Bastien tried to out-deadlift him - only to pull a hamstring and pretend he meant to do it.

Quatre stood near the wide sliding door, bare arms crossed, simply watching.

Kai looked at him with new appreciation. 

They all shared the same face, but not the same soul. 

Each one carried the charge of a life that almost was.

He looked at Bastien last. 

Bastien looked quieter now, his glow dimmed, chest still rising heavy.

“You good?” 
Kai asked softly.

Bastien gave a half-shrug.

“Mhm.”

Kai tilted his head. 

“That’s not an answer.”

Bastien exhaled through his nose, slow. 

“Nah. 
I’m not good.”

Kai hesitated, then admitted, 

“Me neither.” 

His voice was small, but steady.
 
“I don’t even know why I feel half the things I feel while I've been here.

My chest’s tight, my hands are shaking… like the ground is moving, but only under me.”

Something flickered in Bastien’s eyes. 

Recognition. 
Relief.

“That’s it,” he murmured. 

He leaned forward, ribs faintly glowing. 

“Kai… I believe it has a lot to do with you.”

Kai blinked. 

“Me?”

Bastien nodded. 

“I knew you were something the night I saw you on the rooftop. 

It felt… placed. 

Like we were meant to meet. Like the Archive whispered, and there you were.”

He swallowed, his voice roughening. 

“That’s why I want to protect you.

Why I have to. 

Not because you’re weak, but because you’re central. 

The current bends around you, frère. 

I can feel it in my bones.”

Kai’s throat tightened. 

For a long moment, he couldn’t speak. 

Then he managed:

“Then I guess… we protect each other.”

Bastien’s lips curved. 

Not wide. 
Not cocky. 

Just real. 

“Deal.”

The silence that followed wasn’t heavy. 

It was shared. 

A seal.

For the first time that night, they both felt less alone.


-----


Kai stood to leave.

He knew his welcome had no end. 

But the timing did.

He reached for the door. 
Bastien walked him there, shoulder brushing his as they moved in sync.

This time, there was no hesitation. Bastien pulled him in, arms locking around Kai’s back in a massive, bone-deep hug.

Not careful. 
Not formal. 

Just the way they always did, like scaffolding holding the other upright.

Kai melted into it, burying his face briefly against Bastien’s shoulder. 

His chest eased, his pulse slowed. 

For a moment, neither of them carried anything alone.

When Bastien pulled back, his hands lingered on Kai’s arms.

His eyes softer now, ribs faintly glowing.

“You’re in this with me, hein?” Bastien murmured.

Kai nodded. 

“Always.”


Then, like a teasing older brother, he gave the bulge a gentle, two-fingered pinch through the pants.

“Go take care of that,” he smirked. 

“You look overdue.”

Kai flushed. 

Deep. 
Hard. 

His ears turned red.

“Shut up,” he mumbled, nearly laughing.

“Can’t. 
It’s a gift,” Bastien said, already walking back toward the kitchen.

And then it hit.

Just as Kai reached for the knob, the scent returned - a phantom trace. 

Not overwhelming. 

Not foul.
Familiar. 

Deep. Charged.

Warm metal. 
Salted skin. 

Maple syrup and something ancient.

Kai froze.

His eyes narrowed.

Upper lip.
He wiped.

Paused.

A single pearl of dried cum had been there the entire time, from that knuckle on Bastien’s hand.

He wiped again, vigorously now. And laughed.

Slowly, curiously - like a man trying to recall a half-dream - he brought two fingers to his upper lip.

Wiped.
Paused.

Sniffed.

His eyes widened in disbelief.

Then he laughed. 

Once. 

Loud and startled, chest-rolled and real.

“No way,” 
he whispered. 

“It’s been there the whole time.”

He wiped his lip again, rubbing harder, still laughing.

“That bastard - he marked me like a compass.”

He shook his head.

A breath. 
A memory. 

A taste.

“I’ll never get the smell or taste out of my head,” he muttered. 

“Now I’ll always know where he is.”

He reached for the knob again, paused.

Another smile. 
This one different.

“Can’t wait to tell Jaxx.”

The door clicked behind him.
And the night air kissed the scent of Bastien from his skin, but not from his memory.

# TRON’s blockchain has built a rep as a lightning-fast, budget-friendly hub for moving crypto like USDT TRC-20. It’s a go-to for many in the crypto community, from DeFi degens to everyday hodlers. But here’s the catch: some USDT transfers are hitting wallets with fees north of $8 — even for small amounts like $10. Ouch. Why’s this happening, and how can you keep more of your stack?

In this guide, we’ll break down the real cost of USDT TRC-20 transfers, explain why fees are climbing, and show you how to cut them down using a game-changer called Tron Pool Energy. Whether you’re rocking Trust Wallet, TronLink, Klever, or imToken, this article is your roadmap to cheaper transactions. Let’s dive into the nitty-gritty and save you some serious coin.

# How Are USDT TRC-20 Fees Calculated?

In the TRON ecosystem, every transaction — including USDT TRC-20 transfers — runs on TRX, the network’s native token. Think of TRON as a bustling digital metropolis, and TRX is the cash you need to navigate its highways. Even when you’re moving USDT, the network still demands TRX to fuel the transaction.

# Breaking Down the Cost

Here’s the deal on USDT TRC-20 transfer fees (as of July 2025, with TRX at $0.30):

* $4.14 (13.8 TRX) for transfers to wallets with a positive USDT balance.
* $8.31 (27.7 TRX) for transfers to wallets with zero USDT TRC-20.

The difference hinges on whether the receiving wallet already holds USDT. But let’s be real — $8 for a single transfer, especially for small amounts like $20, feels like getting rugged. Why are these fees so steep, and why do they keep creeping up? It’s all tied to TRX’s price action and the network’s mechanics. Let’s unpack it.

# Why Are USDT TRC-20 Fees So High?

The root cause? Fees are pegged to TRX’s market price, which has been on a tear. As TRX’s value climbs, so does the cost of transactions in USD. Let’s look at how this has played out over time:

||
||
|Year|TRX Price|Fee in TRX|Fee in USD|
|2022|$0.06|13.8–27.7|$0.80–$1.70|
|2024|$0.12|13.8–27.7|$1.70–$3.30|
|2025|$0.30|13.8–27.7|$4.14–$8.31|

In 2025, with TRX at $0.30, even the minimum fee of 13.8 TRX costs $4.14. If you’re moving USDT a couple of times a day, that’s $50–$150 a month just in fees! For small transfers ($10–$20), fees can eat up a whopping 40% of your transaction. That’s not just a fee — it’s like burning cash in a bear market. So, how do you stop overpaying and keep your profits intact?

# How to Slash USDT Transfer Fees on TRON

Good news: you can cut your fees by up to 3x with Tron Pool Energy. This isn’t some sketchy workaround — it’s a legit feature built into TRON’s architecture. Let’s explore how to make your transfers as cheap as a Layer 2 swap.

# TRON’s Secret Sauce: Bandwidth and Energy

To get why fees sting, you need to understand TRON’s two key resources:

* Bandwidth: Powers simple transactions like TRX transfers. Every wallet gets 600 free units daily, which is usually enough for basic moves.
* TRON Energy: Fuels complex transactions like USDT TRC-20 transfers, which rely on smart contracts.

Here’s the kicker: if your wallet runs out of Energy, TRON burns TRX to cover the cost. That’s why fees skyrocket — you’re paying with TRX instead of tapping into free or rented resources. It’s like buying a new car every time you need a ride instead of just renting one.

# Where to Get TRON Energy on a Budget

Forget stocking up on TRX to cover fees — that’s like buying single-use batteries when you could just recharge. The smarter move? Rent TRON Energy through Tron Pool Energy, a service designed to keep your costs low. It’s like car-sharing for crypto: you rent what you need for a fraction of the cost.

Here’s how it shakes out for two daily transfers:

* Without Energy Rental: 27.7 TRX × $0.30 × 60 transfers = $498/month.
* With Energy Rental: Around $180/month.
* Savings: Over $300/month — enough to stack some extra sats or grab a coffee or three.

Tron Pool Energy works seamlessly with non-custodial wallets like Trust Wallet, TronLink, or imToken. No complicated setup, no tech wizardry required. It’s a no-brainer for anyone moving USDT regularly.

# Why Energy Rental Is a Game-Changer

Here’s why Tron Pool Energy is a must for savvy crypto users:

* Massive Savings: Cut fees by up to 65%, especially when TRX prices spike.
* User-Friendly: No need to overhaul your wallet or learn new tech.
* Flexible Options: Rent Energy for an hour for one-off transfers or go unlimited for frequent moves.
* Future-Proof: As TRX’s price rises, Energy rentals save you even more.

# Practical Steps to Pay Less for USDT Transfers

Ready to optimize your USDT game? Follow these steps to leverage TRON’s Energy rental system and keep your wallet happy:

1. Audit Your Fees: Check how much you’re spending on fees monthly. Tron Pool Energy’s new website (coming soon) will let you plug in your wallet address to see your total fee burn. It’s a wake-up call for your budget.
2. Rent Energy for Big or Frequent Transfers: Energy rentals shine for large or regular transactions.
3. Track TRX Prices: Higher TRX prices mean bigger savings with Energy rentals.
4. Skip Buying TRX for Fees: It’s a losing game. Rent Energy instead for a one-time or unlimited plan.

# How to Rent TRON Energy for 1 Hour

This is the cheapest way to transfer USDT, slashing fees by nearly 3x. Here’s how to do it via Tron Pool Energy’s Telegram bot:

1. Open the u/TronPoolBot on Telegram.
2. Select “Energy for 1 Hour”.
3. Pay the rental fee (in USDT or TRX):
   * 10 TRX for 131,000 Energy (enough for transfers to wallets without USDT).
   * 5 TRX for 65,000 Energy (for transfers to wallets with USDT).
4. The Energy is linked to the wallet you paid from. Done.

This hack is a lifesaver for newbies and OGs alike. It’s like finding a cheat code to filter out toxic fees from your crypto budget.

# Pay Less, Win More

TRON’s not always the “cheap” network it’s hyped to be. With TRX at $0.30, fees can hit harder than a market dip. If you’re making 10+ transfers a month, those costs stack up fast — think hundreds of dollars lost to fees alone.

Tron Pool Energy flips the script, letting you save up to 65% by working smarter, not harder. It’s not some moonboy promise — it’s about understanding TRON’s architecture and using it to your advantage. In crypto, knowledge is power, and power is money. Now you know how to keep more of your USDT where it belongs — in your wallet.

1n0fx0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/kia/comments/1n0fx0d/i_love_kia_but_i_will_never_buy_a_one_like_this/,"I love Kia, but I will never buy a one like this! Please get it FIXED!","TLDR: 

Love the brand and the cars but the Coffee Break alerts every 5 mins and constant speed limit change beeps on wrong speed limits make the car distracting and dangerous to drive and I will never buy or rent one again in the near future because of this. 

Just posting this to help raise awareness for these massive issues that I don't understand how they have passed QA at all unless it was all done in a lab.

  
Long version of the post:

I never owned a Kia but I have been following the brand since I first saw one of the new designs back in 2011 at a dealership while picking up another car (used trade in) and I have been renting the Kia Ceed Estate every year on holidays for the last 5-10 years.

The quality vs price range make it a very appealing brand, and dare I say, the cars feel and look the more premium than other brands outside of the premium german brands (Merc, BMW, Audi).

This year I rented the 2025 Kia Ceed STW, which is great for the most part. I wish the steering wheel arch was a bit more thick and rigid and that the steering was not as soft as it is, which I get is great for most people, but it makes it way harder to properly control the car and prevent it from boucing around on country roads.

The tech in the car is also good enough, I wish it had wireless Apple Car Play, but as I like to charge my phone while in the car is not a big problem. In my 2022 Merc back home I have wireless car play which is great, but it also has a wireless charging pad which is tucked away in a awkward position to get the phone in and out of and often doesn't line up properly for charging anyway.

The lane assist is reasonably good but maybe a bit too eager, however you can easily disable it with the press of a button on the steering wheel.

However, the whole experience is then spoiled by 2 massive annoyances which I suspect are border line dangerous: the Coffee Break alert and the Speed Limit alert.

  
1) Coffee Brake alert  
\- Cannot be disabled at all in the newer versions of the car (I remember I could disable this before, I think)  
\- Comes up at random times often every 5-10 minutes, this is really bad. I take off, get on the motorway, drive peacefully and the alert keeps coming on at random times for no reason with a really loud beep. It doesn't matter if I'm driving perfectly or erratically, there's no ryhme or reason for this alert to come up (I tested various things). I'm sure there's some sort of trigger or algorithm behind it, but as a software developer, I can see that whoever designed this, didn't test it outside of the lab.  
  
2) Speed Limit change alert  
\- Is enabled / reset every time you start the car, so you need to disable it every time  
\- My Merc uses a laser sensor to read the signs on the road which makes it correct 90% of the time, but at least doesn't tell me off every time the speed limit changes  
\- You can say that it only beeps when you are above the speed limit, but there's a massive problem with that as the speed limit is often wrong. I'm not sure if the car has a sign reader like the Merc, but it feels like a lot of the speed limits are taken from the Nav Maps which are wrong 90% of the time in the country I'm driving at the moment. So, often the car will tell me off for speeding when actually I'm well below the speed limit because the car thinks the speed limit is 50 km/h when in fact it's 90 km/h. The car will also read speed limit signs that are for specific weather condition and take it as gospell, again alerting me for speeing when in fact I'm not.

The Merc speed sign reader also gets it wrong some times (it's a lot more accurate than the Kia) but it will often read speed signs for exit roads while on the motorway or again, read speed signs that are only applicable for specific weather conditions. Hence why it only shows the info on the dashboard as an information piece and not as a digital policeman!

  
Please Kia, if you are reading this, make these things in a way that they can be disabled completely until this sort of tech is 100% right all of the time in every country in the world, which is the same as saying, just give us the disable option because this will never happen. In trying to make the car ""safer"", you are actually making it a lot more dangerous to drive.

As such, unfortunately I will be avoiding Kia for a few years when renting or buying cars as I don't want to experience this again on a holiday.

PS: I'm not bashing Kia, again, other than these things, the car is very good and the quality is good, but these issues are a big red flag.

The tech issues are not exclusive to Kia.  My Merc back home is full of tech issues as well and my next car won't be a Merc for a while.

Also, last year, I rented a Skoda Fabia (not by choice, but it was the luck of the draw on a bad rental company where I rented a Kia Ceed STW and got the Fabia Hatchback). The car was a only few months old and something (maybe a pothole) triggered a TPMS issue on one of the tires which basically kept disabling all assists in the car (ABS, Steering Assist, etc), as I was making a 2h journey back to the rental companies office, the issues disappeared, which made me turn around and go back to where I was, just to keep getting the same issue this for the next 2 weeks of the holiday. I checked the tires' pressure multiple times and tried to reset it in the car, nothing worked).

If you made it this far, thanks for reading! I just wanted to vent in the hopes this feedback will reach someone at Kia with the power to change things.

I’m a single Indian guy living and working in Henderson, and here’s the thing — I’m not looking for anything too heavy, just a no-strings attached connection with someone fun, kind, and a little adventurous.

What I’m into:
	•	Exploring Vegas — from fancy dinners to random shows to late-night taco runs
	•	Weekend road trips (because the desert is underrated)
	•	Adventure sports (yes, I’ll probably suggest skydiving at some point)
	•	Intimate nights in when we’re not out causing good trouble

What I bring to the table:
	•	I treat my woman well (chivalry isn’t dead, I promise)
	•	I’ve got stories, curiosity, and energy for days
	•	I know the best coffee spots in town — and no, it’s not Starbucks

I’d especially love to meet single Desi/Indian women who are looking to explore, laugh, and enjoy life without unnecessary drama. But honestly, I’m open to anyone who shares the same adventurous vibe.

DM me if this sounds like your kind of fun.

Dumating na ako sa point na inamin ko na sa sarili ko na gusto ko ng date, ng relationship, gaya ng mga gay couples na nakikita ko. Kaya to make that happen, tinigil ko muna ang pakikipag-hook up. Pinag-pray ko talaga ’to and thankfully, magfi-five months na akong hindi nakikipag-hook up. Nati-tempt minsan, pero lagi kong nireremind yung sarili ko kung ano ba talaga yung gusto ko. Hindi naman ako umaasa na porke tumigil ako, eh biglang magkakajowa agad. Actually, peaceful siya, but to be honest, nakaka-bore most of the time, well at least ngayon, di ko na kailangang mag-praning sa risk of STD/HIV (nagpa-test ako this month, negative naman).

Pero normal lang ba? Yung minsan nami-miss ko rin yung “old self” ko (OA naman sa old self, kahit 5 months pa lang naman hahah) na nakikipag-hook up randomly, basta may opportunity, kahit saan pa ’yan, go. Yung thrill na nakaka-sex mo yung mga type mong katawan, tapos wala nang ibang iniisip, after no strings, goods na ulit. I know, mababaw pakinggan, pero may mga times na naiisip ko, what if bumalik na lang ako doon? Kasi parang mas okay na yun lang yung gusto ko. At least hindi ako emotionally needy.

Kasi ngayon, parang nakakapanibago. Like, what do you mean gusto ko ng date to settle? What do you mean gusto ko ng jowa na susunduin at susundo sa office? What do you mean gusto ko ng ka-holding hands sa mall, ka-coffee sa umaga, kausap bago matulog? What do you mean gusto ko ng kasabay mag jogging sa gabi, or ng taong excited akong i-update kahit sa maliliit na bagay? What do you mean gusto ko ng emotionally available na karelasyon?

Weird siya at minsan ang weak sa feeling. Before, sex lang talaga yung focus. Pero ngayon ko lang narealize, sa generation natin, ang dali makahanap ng temporary pleasure, pero yung pangmatagalan, halos impossible. Hayst.

Pero at the same time, alam ko na hindi ko kailangang madaliin. I’m learning to be okay with where I am right now, kasi mas mahalaga muna na grounded ako sa sarili ko kaysa pumasok sa kung saan-saan. Kung dumating man yung tamang tao, good. Kung hindi, ano pa bang magagawa ko?, at least I’m at peace with myself (self manipulation lol)",3,1756194992.0,LGBTPhilippines,0,1.0,False

So eto na.... Ako pala ang magiging financier... Uutang ako ng milyun-milyon sa banko. Gagawa kami ng corporation, majority owner si F2, tapos hati kami ni F1 sa minority shares. Tapos May fixed salary pa sila. Sabi ko mag ipon kami ng kapital, Sabi nila wala daw sila pang kapital.

Ang una kong naisip... ANO TINGIN NIYO SAKIN T@NG@!!!????

I was triggered deep inside pero I tried my best to compose myself. I felt betrayed, kasi why are my ""friends"" proposing such a lopsided proposal. And pangalawa, at mas nakakatrigger, ganun ba katanga tingin nila sakin. 

I cant believe I heard this from my friends. Mag simula kami ng business, its not like established enterprise na sila at makikisali ako.

Ang laking risk nito para sakin. corporation to a, so ang liability is sa corporation lang, at ang capital ay utang ko sa banko. pag nalugi, sarado corporation namin, at may maiiwan na utang sakin. Dahil personal loan ko ang kapital. Pag successful, majority owner si F2. 

On hindsight, sana nag counter proposal ako ng terms na pabor sakin, baka business is business mode sila. I could have handled it better.

Kaya ito napapaisip ako kung ang mga taong to e tunay kong kaibigan or like most people na sarili lang talaga iniisip. Or baka naman naive lang sila at tingin nila eh barya lang sakin 2m++ pesos, which is not. Baka di nila naiintindihan na gusto ko lang ng maliit na negosyo. 

Di ko alam. Pero ito, tumaas ulit ang wall ko sa kanila. Salamat sa pagbabasa.",3,1756194020.0,OffMyChestPH,3,1.0,False

Chapter 1 

As a corporate drone, the person I envied most was the CEO’s sister sitting at the desk next to mine. 

I worked insane hours for three grand a month while she pulled in three hundred thousand doing absolutely nothing. 

She never had to kiss up to idiot clients. Hell, she could throw wine in an investor’s face at a company dinner, and her brother would still make me take the fall for it. 

But then one day, the Sullivans discovered that Sophie Sullivan wasn’t actually blood–related to them. 

I was their biological daughter. 

My best friend tried to talk me out of going back. “Girl dads like that will just think you shouldn’t exist. They’ll never love you. Plus, your brother’s totally obsessed with his sister.” 

I waved her off. “We’re all adults here. When you get a ticket into old money, who’s fighting over love? I just want what’s mine.” 

If the Sullivans wanted to accept me, great. We’d make it work. 

But if they dared give my shares to Sophie, then we’d have problems. 

The Sullivans threw me a press conference. 

Sophie, who used to sit next to me sipping coffee while dumping her work on me, was sitting in the main seat with red–rimmed eyes. 

I found it weird that I, the real daughter being welcomed back, was stuck in the side seat. 

Just as I was about to speak up, Sophie suddenly stood and ran off crying. 

The moment she bolted, my former boss–now my brother Samuel–along with Edward Sullivan and his wife, all followed her out. 

I was left alone on stage with a thousand people staring at me. 

I was cringing so hard my toes were curling in my shoes, wondering if I should crack a joke to break the tension, when suddenly voices came through the sound system. 

“It’s okay, we’re just acknowledging her. You’re still the Sullivan family’s only princess.” 

That was Dad’s voice. 

Then Samuel’s. “Exactly, sweetheart. She’s just an employee under me at the end of the day. If she knows her place, I’ll humor her and call her sister. But if she tries to take what’s yours, I’ll kick her out of the company.” 

Someone in the crowd muttered, “Oh shit, they forgot to turn off their mics!” 

I rubbed my forehead in disbelief. I’d worked for this moron Samuel for years, and someone as obsessed with PR as he was wouldn’t make such a basic mistake. 

This was intentional. 

He wanted everyone to hear exactly what my position was a little show of power. 

The people who’d been looking at me with envy now had contempt in their eyes. 

Chloe’s voice came through. “Don’t worry. We won’t let her in. You’ll still be the only princess at the estate.” 

Everyone’s judgmental stares burned into me. Anyone else would’ve slunk off by now, but I stayed glued to my chair, waiting out the full fifteen minutes until they returned.. 

When they saw me still sitting there shamelessly, their faces darkened. Clearly, they hadn’t expected me to be this thick–skinned, 

Please. I’d finally gotten my ticket into old money. Only an idiot would give that up over a few stupid comments. 

“Ahem, well, Megan, since you came back so suddenly, we haven’t had time to prepare a room at home. You can stay in your rental for 

Disfruta de historias impactantes en cada episodio corto 

now. Chloe will give you living expenses so you can get a nicer place.” 

A room in their thousand–square–foot estate needed preparation? 

They just didn’t want me coming home. 

Sophie hid behind Chloe, shooting me a smug look. 

I nodded. “Fine.” 

Samuel looked satisfied, like I was being reasonable. 

“But since I’m back, you can’t just give me living expenses, right?” I changed my tone. “I heard you prepared shares for my sister. Where are mine?” 

They stared at me in shock. ",1,1756193961.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

Luckily, I  never had any accident with injuries to others or people's property damage but did manage to total a car and came close to a few more of those. It was nothing but me being lucky. The car I totalled had all the modern bells and whistles but it wasn't a Tesla and I don't want a Tesla. I have tried everything from a rest break, strong coffee, Red Bull to loud music but nothing even came close to helping me.  Once I start yawning, I know it's coming. I would like to know which is the best. Whether a Branch or Open pilot 1.0 will help me the most. The Dash Cam goes hand in hand.

4 Weeks free from all caffeine and I feel like a 90 year old man, my knees and back are aching all day long and my head is absolutely pounding. My brain also feels dysfunctional. 

I have no energy, feel absolutely depressed and hopeless and feel like I’m seeing life and myself  truthfully now, not for what my caffeinated brain was perceiving.

I could have drank over 1000mg of caffeine daily easily, there was times I was having 30g of ground coffee in a French press, then having 50g right after. Then likely more that day 🤦🏼‍♂️.

For context - I’m 24, Male , sleep 8-10 hours a night now which has drastically improved since stopping, walk 10K steps a day and eat a whole food diet.

I really feel like going back and drinking coffee again because at least it would drag me out of this despair I’m feeling but at the same time I was making some rash decisions, had anxiety, a bad stomach, was stressed and sleep wasn’t the best. 

Can someone please reassure me that it gets better? (hopefully) 

Thanks! 🙏

1n0few5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1n0few5/aitah_for_breaking_up_with_my_boyfriend_because/,AITAH for breaking up with my boyfriend because he yelled at me one time?,"I 24 F have been seeing my(I guess ex) boyfriend for around a year and a half now. He’s been great, truly. He’s a few years older than me but we have a lot in common plus he’s been totally understanding about my past trauma. Specifically regarding the fact that I grew up in an extremely abusive household with my father screaming, hitting, and degrading me pretty much constantly. Even though I got out of that situation around 13 years old I still can’t handle someone raising their voice at me, sudden movements will still make me flinch, loud noises scare me, and lots of other things that i’ve been in therapy for years now to cope with. I’m doing a lot better and my boyfriend is fully aware of my past, he’s fully aware of how it affects me. 

I always swore to myself that I would never be in a relationship with someone that ever reminds me of that time in my life, that a relationship doesn’t have to have screaming or insults. And until now my boyfriend has been absolutely perfect, I wouldn’t necessarily describe him as soft spoken but he had never once even so much as raised his voice at me, and he had certainly never insulted me or even made a petty comment. We had had disagreements but spoke about them like mature adults. Unfortunately that changed not even a week ago. 

I was over at his house(We don’t live together yet technically speaking but I spent so much time with him that we basically did) and I had woken up before him so I went to put his dog out in the yard. I was half asleep and hadn’t noticed that the lawn care guy had come to cut the grass and after he had left forgot to close the back gate, especially because the gate to the backyard isn’t visible from the back door and has never been left open before. His dog loves being outside and if left to her own devices will stay out there for hours so I didn’t think twice about starting to make some food and coffee while she was outside. 

After about 20 minutes maybe I went to just peak my head out the door and check on her. She was gone, the gate was open. I freaked out. I immediately went and woke my boyfriend up and explained that the gate was opened and I hadn’t noticed. I was already crying and apologizing while I was trying to get my bag and shoes on to go out and look for her. For context, his dog is originally his family dog and now she lives with him, this dog is literally his everything, she’s also older and is just not all there anymore so her being out on her own was a scary thought. So he got up immediately and was very clearly upset and distraught but instead of doing literally anything else he started to scream at me. Like I mean properly yelling, in my face, calling me and I quote “a fucking idiot” for not noticing that she had gotten out until 20 minutes later, that she could be dead on the street by now. 

Meanwhile as he was doing this I had a panic attack, a bad one. Hyperventilating and freaking out, eventually he got stressed out enough and took my idea of going out to look for her and just left on foot to go walk around the neighborhood. After he left I composed myself enough to grab my things and get going. I drove around for maybe 40 minutes just in loops around the neighborhood and actually ended up finding her in a front yard that she had apparently just walked right into with a few nice people. I drove her back to my boyfriends house, dropped her off and texted my boyfriend that she was back home and safe but that I needed some time because how he spoke to me regardless of the situation was unbelievably inappropriate. 

I muted my messages and calls from him, and just didn’t deal with it for a few days. Not my most mature move to just disappear but I was in bad shape i’ll be honest, the way he was gotten in my face and was yelling had really sent me into such a bad headspace and with some emotion comforting and guidance from my absolutely amazing friends I had decided that even regarding how stressful of a situation that was he had no excuse to ever treat me like that in general but especially considering everything he had known about my past and how that would effect me. Honestly I was afraid to see him in person to end things, it took a bad toll on me and I felt like the second I would see him I would panic again. So I ended things over text and explained how he had made me feel, that how he had reacted had immediately made me uncomfortable around him, that I didn’t think I could come back from this, that I understood having an emotional reaction but that he had kept screaming at me while I was literally having a panic attack and he knew it because he has helped me through them before was just cruel, and that though I love him I couldn’t continue that relationship anymore. 

Apparently he had showed up at our house a few times after that but my roommates(and best friends) are absolute angels and turned him away every time without me having to see
him in person. I still can’t bring myself to check our messages and see his response even though I know I probably should but i’m just really emotionally exhausted right now. Unfortunately for me though he has apparently gotten not only his family but my family as well involved, and i’m basically being spammed by everyone that i’m actually to rash right now. That he can’t be blamed entirely for this situation and that I need to at least hear him out and let him apologize to me. That i’m being overly dramatic and harsh right now. That we could work this out and just need couples therapy. You name it i’ve heard it, and it’s just really getting to me. I wanted others opinions on this situation, not my friends who hated his guts the second that I came home crying and told them what happened, and certainly not our families who haven’t even heard my side of the story. Just an unbiased opinion. So any opinion or maybe advice is appreciated, thank you. ",3,1756193513.0,AITAH,9,0.8,False

>**Lattafa Kamrah Qahwa :**

Sweet fragrance which smells like cinnamon and vanilla at the start but settles down into this addictive coffee caramel vibe. Projects solid for about 3 hours, lasts for around 8 maybe more on clothes.

**10/10** from me, will get a full bottle.

>**Afnan 9PM rebel :**

Sweet, fruity and fresh. Smells like pineapple at the start but matures into a subtle musky scent, loved it as well. Projection and longevity is average.

**7.5/10**

>**SNOI :**

Lemon scented bathroom freshener, super harsh opening which gave me headaches, the dry down is nice but going through that opening is not worth it for me. Hated it, will not buy again.

**3/10**

>**Afnan Rare Carbon**

Smells like leather for the first 20 mins, dries down into the slightly floral and woody mature scent, lasts for a long time on clothes and skin. Great occasional perfume.

**7/10** might get a full bottle someday.

>**Rasasi Hawas Ice :**

Sweet and fruity opening, settles into this very nice cardamomy  scent, very close to silver pearls elaichi. Loved it, projects well for about 90 mins, lasts for 6-7 hours easy.

**8/10** will be getting a full bottle.

>**Rue Boca Theoreme :**

Citrusy fresh opening, settles into a musky spicy scent. It’s alright, not a fan of citrusy frags honestly.

**5/10**

>**Blue by Ahmed :**

Very similar opening to theoreme but the scent profile of dry down is this extremely sophisticated and musky sandalwood and jasmine like scent which i like, projects for about an hour, then its subtle but lasted really long on clothes. As compared to snoi and theoreme, I definitely liked this more.

**8/10**, will get a full bottle for daily use.

>**Rasasi Fattan :**

Opening is harsh orange citrusy but settles fast and the dry down is where the magic is. Very mossy, mature and aromatic. Longevity and projection is above average, definitely a nice spring fragrance, might give headaches to some as it feels very synthetic.

**7.5/10**

`PS: I am not an expert and all of these are my personal opinions about these scents measured individually as a total fragrance newb, these were my first proper buys and it was a nice experience, I haven’t smelled the OGs of any of the dupes so take all of this with a grain of salt.`",9,1756193220.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,18,1.0,False

WARNING, this is LONG! Ain’t nobody gonna read this, but if you do, and I hope you do, you are a brave soul and TY, I really appreciate it 🖤🖤🤎☕️

My theory of Laurel’s manipulation of Tyler. 

About 1-3 years before season 1, Laurel met Tyler for the first time and introduced herself as Marilyn Thornhill. She had moved to Nevermore Academy due to an old grudge she held over the school for how they handled her brother and his death. In turn, her whole family died because of the pain it caused them, and along the way she feigned her own death in the name of revenge. 
Her time in Nevermore allowed her to investigate her brothers death further, gaining records from its library’s and also from Crackstone’s Crypt, Willow Hill and Jericho’s Pilgrim World which were within proximity of the school. 
After having researched and studied Hyde’s in depth, Laurel found a record which immediately peaked her interest; it was François Galpin’s file from Willow Hill. She already knew of a Galpin who was Sheriff of the town of Gericho, and knew that he had a son, Tyler. Her monster she thought, Hydes can be passed down genetically and in a fight against outcasts, she would need the outcast of outcasts. 


It didn’t take long for her to discover Tyler’s daily routine and whereabouts, whether he was in school, working in the Weathervane or in bootcamp at this time, she had him clocked. 
She began observing at first, from afar, striking conversation with locals, trying to find information on the boy. 
Laurel heard things, she saw things, but she knew that the only way she could truly know was by talking to him, so either from behind the bushes at bootcamp or school, or from in front of the counter at the weathervane, Laurel began being a regular visitor to Tyler, first passing it off as going on a walk or running errands, but over time she tried to converse with him more and more, trying to probe him.
At first she became frustrated, he was a fairly normal boy, he was not showing indication of having a Hyde, but from her research she knew this would likely be the case even if he did have one. 
Finally, she had an opening, she realised just how much Tyler grieved for his mother, and how absent his father was, how Tyler wasn’t truly like his friends at all, he just wanted to fit in but didn’t know how. Laurel knew what to do, she would become his mother figure, his only friend, the one person he could trust.

At first, Tyler wasn’t receptive towards her, he thought it was odd that a woman was taking interests in him, a boy. But Laurel knew that as a young teenage boy, he wanted female attention, so she flattered him, told him he was handsome and… I won’t get into it too much because I will throw up, but typical flirtatious grooming behaviours. Eventually, he felt comfortable enough to open up to her, and not only did he vent to and confide in her, but he became emotional with her too, she was the only one he could talk to about his grief. She began to comfort and baby a 13-15 year old Tyler, a feeling he hadn’t felt since his mother had passed. 

For either months or years this went on, but now it was time to set a plan in motion, though she wasn’t sure exactly what it would be yet, she knew that she wanted to unlock Tyler’s Hyde, so she told him to meet her in her car which would be parked near the Weathervane, and told him not to get seen by anyone as she often did. 
After looking around to make sure nobody saw him get in her car, he sat down and closed the door. This was when Laurel told Tyler the truth about his Mother, that she was a Hyde, and the years preceding her death, she was locked up in Willow Hill Sanitarium, an institution for insane outcasts. 
She apologised and comforted him and also told him about her secret, that she was in fact Laurel Gates seeking revenge and not Marilyn Thornhill, to gain his trust; she held his secret, and he held hers. 

Laurel grew deeply impatient when the news did not unlock Tyler’s Hyde, she thought it would be traumatic enough, but since it evidentially wasn’t, she would have to take… more extreme, measures.  

One day, Laurel told Tyler she had a way to make him strong, stronger than the other boys at school. He asked her how. Laurel told him to meet her at a cave in the nearby forests, connecting the town of Jericho to Nevermore. He was sceptical of the location and thought about telling his father Donovan, but the previous day Tyler had probed him about his Mother, giving his Father one last chance to be open and to tell him the truth, but Donovan had not responded well and had been drinking since; by this evening he was in a drunken stupor. So at nightfall, Tyler ventured his way out alone into the forest, he was very jumpy and didn’t like to admit it, but scared. 
Finally, he reached the cave where he saw the glow of a light. There standing at the entrance was Laurel, smiling widely; he took comfort in it. She welcomed him in, telling him he must be cold and to come sit near the fire, so he did. 
Once he had warmed up, she took his shirt off, and she kissed him, he thought that this would go a certain way but instead, she knocked him out cold. 

A confused and dazed Tyler awoke. Laurel apologised but injected him with a substance that made his blurred vision begin dissolve into vertigo.

Slowly, subtle signs of his Hyde emerged, as she began to torture him and incite it with potions. Her torture became more vigorous and painful, forcing the Hyde to lash out at her to protect Tyler, this scared Laurel so she secured chains and shackles to him and continued with his torture for days. 
Tyler was drugged so much of the time but whimpered at Laurel’s presence. 
Eventually, the Hyde was compliant, grateful that he had been unlocked and Laurel ceased to hurt Tyler. She took off his shackles for the first time to let him carry out his first kill on her command. Once he did, he came back to the cave as she instructed, but she couldn’t let him remember what she did to him, as she knew that it’s possible a Humans will is be strong enough to fight against their masters commands, so chained him so that she could drug him one final time. When he was fast asleep, she took off his constraints and dragged him out into the forest. He woke up, covered in blood, terrified. Had he been in a fight? Had he hurt someone? Perhaps he was the butt of a cruel prank? He couldn’t tell at first but was relieved to see he was wounded, it must be his own blood! He was still terrified, not knowing what had happened to him. 
Tyler still furious kept away from his Father’s sight, his Father avoided him like the plague as to not face his questions about his mother; but as the weeks went by, Tyler’s wounds began to heal, and he overheard his father talk about bear attacks. Tyler thought, perhaps that was what had happened, he was attacked by a bear. He had his 16th birthday but nobody around to celebrate it, his Father tried, but it was only mid afternoon and he had already had a little too much to drink, birthdays reminded Donovan of François. 

Weeks went by and Tyler took on more shifts at The Weathervane, hoping he could save up to move away from Jericho as fast as possible.  

S1e1

Tyler met Wednesday, an odd but beautiful girl who helped him fix his coffee machine, in exchange for him driving her out of town. He was shocked, a Nevermore student who got their hands dirty, he’s never met anyone like her. He witnessed her take down his ex friends after they surrounded her all by herself, and was thoroughly impressed. She enchanted him from this first encounter and he hoped he would meet her again.

When he went with her to a funfair, agreeing to drive her out of town, the last thing he remembered was them being chased by his ex friends with bats and Wednesday running into the forest shouting “Rowan”.
Tyler hesitated for a while, but eventually felt a protective instinct to follow. 

S1E2
Laurel stole Goody Addams Book of Shadows and realised that Wednesday Addams would be the key to resurrecting Joseph Crackstone, as she was a descendant of Goody, and she would need to be kept around until the blood moon, as her fresh blood was necessary for the ceremony. Therefore, Wednesday became part of Laurel’s plan. Noticing that Tyler was becoming close to her, Laurel instructed him to get closer, though was vague on how. She told him to make sure she was kept around. 


Maybe he began having memories of a monster after killing Rowan but he didn’t remember exactly what he did; his memories came in flashes so he couldn’t make them out, or decipher if the memories were his own or just imagined, but he was scared. When Wednesday said the beast didn’t kill her, and in fact saved her, he started to get suspicious; what if it really was me? What if I’m the monster but if I killed, it was only to protect Wednesday, right? He began to question if he was a good person, if he could live with killing someone. 
It slowly became more and more clear to him, he WAS the monster, he was being more than just influenced by Laurel, more than just part of her plan, he was being CONTROLLED by Laurel. 

He confronted Laurel after memories of him being tortured and injected by her began surfacing, so Laurel told him the truth, about everything, that she unlocked him, but this was because she wanted to unlock his potential. She told him, she NEEDED him for the plan. Tyler was angry with her, really angry and kept on flickering in and out of transformation, but Laurel talked him down, she began comforting him as she usually did, telling him that he wasn’t something to be afraid of, he was the same as his mother whom he loved. 
She fed threatening thoughts into his head, that normies spoke of monsters stories to incur nightmares, and that even the outcasts at Nevermore considered Hyde’s freaks, and didn’t accept them as students. She said that that was why his Father hated him, why he hurt him, but she gave him the ability to fight back, to protect himself. She told him that she knew he wasn’t a monster inside, that she saw the real him, that she loved him. 

Tyler once again woke up covered in blood, but this time he remembered, and he knew without a doubt it was him, it wasn’t a bad dream, he was living the nightmare. Not knowing where to go, he scrambled to the Gates mansion where Laurel told him he could always find refuge, and filled the bath. He submerged himself in water and screamed with all his might, horrified by what he had done. He had KILLED people.
 
Now Laurel was confident that he was truly hers and would do ANYTHING she told him to do. She never tortured, locked him up or drugged him again because every command she gave him, he followed. She didn’t tell him everything about her plan, but he trusted her completely. 

Now conscious of his Hyde, Tyler began simultaneously gaining more knowledge while losing more control and autonomy, he sometimes cleverly found ways to not directly go against orders, but rather walk around them, giving warnings and using his free time to do things he wasn’t ordered to do explicitly but could still benefit the plan of getting closer to Wednesday, or at least that’s how he justified it, sometimes he worried Laurel was jealous. 

But now Tyler had a larger struggle, the fight between himself and his Hyde. Tyler grew confused, he didn’t know what was him anymore. Was the bloodlust, the thrill of the hunt, the exhilarating deliciousness of fear, all him? He hated and denied it at first, enjoying the killing, the compulsion to carry out his masters wishes. But after a while, he couldn’t deny it any longer, he craved hunting prey. 

Laurel had created what she now believed to be a willing participant.

S2E4
But what this episode reveals, is that he was not so willing after all. Tyler’s distance from his master allowed him to become more connected to his Hyde, and less to Laurel. His memories were becoming ever clearer and he remembered the sexual trickery and torture he endured at her hands, he had been realising through therapy that she had taken advantage of his younger self. 
But more and more, Tyler was losing control. Before, his Hyde was kept in line by its master, but now his emotions directly spilled out as loud roars and violent outbursts, one’s that took him by surprise. 
After killing Laurel, this became even stronger, and all the trauma caught up in his mind, he was now alone to deal with all he had done and his mind was no longer coherent; Tyler is crazed and maddened.

Over the past year, I have seen more Kansas City businesses experimenting with AI-powered design platforms for quick prototypes & basic layouts. These tools are fast, cost-effective & can generate something functional in minutes. For a small startup or a local business that needs a quick landing page, AI can be a lifesaver.

But here’s the catch — websites are not just about being functional; they are about telling a story. Local brands here in Kansas City often want their website to reflect the personality of their business, whether it’s a boutique coffee shop, a law firm or a fast-growing tech startup. That level of **creativity, empathy & strategic thinking** is still something only human designers & developers bring to the table. AI can suggest colors or layouts, but it does not know your customer base in Overland Park or what resonates with folks in the Crossroads District.

What I am noticing is a balance forming: AI helps speed up repetitive tasks (like generating code snippets, wire-frames or basic content) while human designers focus on crafting unique digital experiences that feel authentic & align with brand identity. In other words, **the future might not be “AI vs. humans,” but “AI + humans”.**

I would love to hear from the community — if you are in Kansas City’s design or tech space, do you see AI as a real threat to creativity or just another tool in the toolbox?",3,1756193093.0,KansasTech,0,1.0,False

*By Your Humorously Analytical Sports Oracle*

The New York Yankees (70-60) host the Washington Nationals (53-77) on August 26, 2025, in a clash that’s less “Game of the Year” and more “Why Are We Still Watching This?” The odds? The Yankees are -233 favorites, implying a 70% chance to win, while the Nationals (+192) are about as likely to pull off an upset as a toaster entering a bread-making competition. Let’s break this down with the precision of a MLB umpire and the wit of a late-night host who’s had one too many coffees.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Yankees Are the Statistical Choice

The Yankees’ offense is a home-run-happy juggernaut, averaging 1.7 bombs per game and slugging .452. Aaron Judge (40 HR, 92 RBI) and Cody Bellinger (.488 SLG) are the nuclear option, while the team’s 215 HRs dwarf the Nationals’ paltry 124. On the mound, Luis Gil isn’t Cy Young material, but his 4.26 ERA and recent one-earned-run performance in 19⅔ innings make him a reliable “meh” starter—think of him as the “okay, I guess” choice for a Netflix date night.

The Nationals, meanwhile, are the baseball equivalent of a leaky faucet. Their 5.31 ERA (29th in MLB) and 1.442 WHIP (second-worst) suggest their pitchers are more focused on surrendering runs than preventing them. MacKenzie Gore (4.11 ERA, 5-12 record) starts for Washington, and while his 10.7 K/9 is respectable, his 5-12 record is about as inspiring as a participation trophy.

Key stat: The Yankees have hit the **over** in 25 of their last 41 games, a trend that makes the 8.5-run total look like a conservative bet. The Nationals’ lineup? It’s a “nice try, kid” collection of 27 doubles and 17 HRs from C.J. Abrams—impressive, but not enough to crack the Yankees’ 4.02 ERA defense.

### News Digest: Injuries, Comebacks, and Brad Lord’s “Shortened Night”

The Yankees’ recent 7-2 win over the Red Sox showcased their power surge: Jazz Chisholm Jr. and Trent Grisham combined for four homers, while Carlos Rodón looked like a $100 million Cy Young contender. Their Wild

hey everyone, so you're thinking about starting a business in seattle? good on you. it's a great city with a ton of opportunities, but honestly, it can be a little tough to figure out what to do. everyone and their mother has a tech startup idea, and the coffee market is, well, you know. but there are some real gaps in the market if you know where to look. i've been around the block a few times with my own ventures here, and i've seen what works and what doesn't. so here are some ideas, starting with some you probably haven't thought of.  
  
1. bet you didn't think of this one: a late-night coffee shop. i know, i know, another coffee shop in seattle. but hear me out. this city is full of students, tech workers pulling late nights, and creatives who don't stick to a 9 to 5. and yet, try to find a decent place to work or hang out with a coffee after 7 pm is nearly impossible. sure, there are a few places that stay open until 9 or 10, but a true late-night spot, especially in neighborhoods like ballard or belltown, would be a game-changer. startup costs would be the biggest hurdle, with leasing a space being the main expense. you're probably looking at a decent chunk of change to get started, but honestly, the demand is there.  
  
2. here's another one you probably haven't considered: a parking space rental business with Prked. not gonna lie, parking in seattle is a nightmare. drivers spend an average of 58 hours a year just looking for a spot. that's a lot of wasted time and money. with Prked, you can create a passive income stream by renting out your unused parking space. think about it. if you have a driveway you don't use during the day in a neighborhood like capitol hill or south lake union, you could be making some serious cash. or if you have an extra spot in your garage anywhere in the city, there are tons of people looking for monthly parking to avoid the street parking hassle. it's a pretty solid opportunity with super low startup costs. you're just listing your space on an app. you could even scale it up and lease a few spots to rent out. it's a real seattle-specific solution to a very seattle problem.  
  
3. an ""in-between jobs"" handyman service. i saw this mentioned on a reddit thread and it's brilliant. there are a lot of contractors for big jobs and a lot of people who can do their own small repairs, but what about those in-between jobs? the ones that are too small for a contractor but too complicated for the average person. things like mounting a tv, assembling furniture, or fixing a leaky faucet. in a city full of busy professionals who are short on time, a reliable and affordable handyman service for these kinds of tasks would be huge. you could charge by the hour, and rates in seattle are pretty good, somewhere between $80 and $150 an hour. startup costs are relatively low too, mainly just tools, a vehicle, and some marketing.  
  
4. a quick-service, high-quality deli. this is another idea i've seen people begging for. seattle has a lot of great restaurants, but not a lot of places where you can get a quick, affordable, and delicious lunch. something like a classic new york-style deli, especially in downtown or belltown, would do really well. a place with good sandwiches, salads, and soups that people can grab on their lunch break without having to sit down for a full-service meal. the key would be to focus on quality ingredients and fast service. startup costs would be significant due to the need for a commercial kitchen and a good location, but the potential for high volume and repeat customers is huge.  
  
5. electric vehicle charging stations. washington is a leader in renewable energy and there are a ton of electric vehicles on the road. but the charging infrastructure hasn't quite kept up with the demand. there's a real opportunity to set up a few charging stations in a busy area. this could be a standalone business, or an add-on to an existing business like a coffee shop or a retail store. the startup costs can be high, but there are often government incentives to help offset them. and as the number of evs continues to grow, this is a business that's only going to become more profitable.  
  
6. a niche online retail business. the weather in seattle is, well, you know. it's often cold and rainy, which means people are more inclined to shop online. instead of trying to compete with amazon (ahem), find a niche that you're passionate about. maybe it's sustainable and locally made outdoor gear, or curated boxes for a cozy night in. the startup costs for an online business are much lower than a brick-and-mortar store, and you can reach a much wider audience.  
  
7. a mobile pet grooming service. seattle is a very dog-friendly city, but a lot of pet owners are busy professionals who don't have time to take their furry friends to the groomer. a mobile grooming service that comes to them would be incredibly convenient. you'd need to invest in a specially equipped van, but you'd also have lower overhead than a traditional grooming salon.  
  
8. a tech consulting business for small businesses. with so many big tech companies in seattle, it's easy to forget that there are also a ton of small businesses that need help with their technology. if you have a background in it, you could start a consulting business that helps small businesses with things like setting up their networks, managing their data, and improving their online security. you can start this business from home with very low overhead.  
  
9. a food truck with a unique concept. food trucks are a great way to test out a restaurant concept without the huge upfront investment of a brick-and-mortar location. but with so many food trucks in seattle, you need to have a unique concept to stand out. think about a type of cuisine that's not well-represented in the city, or a creative fusion concept.  
  
10. a curated tour company. seattle is a major tourist destination, but a lot of the tours are pretty generic. if you're a local with a passion for the city, you could start a tour company that offers a more unique and authentic experience. you could focus on a specific neighborhood, a particular interest like street art or craft beer, or offer a more behind-the-scenes look at the city.  
  
so there you have it. a few ideas to get you started. honestly, starting a business is tough, but it's also incredibly rewarding. and in a city like seattle, there are so many opportunities to create something new and successful. hope this helps someone out.",2,1756192833.0,HustleMentality,0,1.0,False

hey everyone, so you're thinking about starting a business in charlotte? good call. this city is growing like crazy and there are a ton of opportunities if you know where to look. i've been in the trenches with a few ventures here myself, so i wanted to share some ideas that go beyond the usual stuff. hope this helps someone out there.  
  
1. specialized eco-friendly cleaning service. bet you didn't think of this one. with all the new apartments and homes being built, especially in areas like south charlotte and ballantyne, a cleaning service is a no-brainer. but a lot of people, especially younger families and professionals, are really conscious about the products used in their homes. starting a cleaning business that only uses green, non-toxic products could be a pretty solid opportunity. you could even add on services like eco-friendly carpet and upholstery cleaning. startup costs are relatively low – you're mostly looking at supplies, insurance, and marketing.  
  
2. driveway and parking spot rentals. not gonna lie, this is a pretty genius passive income idea. with Prked, you can rent out your unused driveway, garage, or even a spot in your yard. think about all the people commuting into uptown for work, or trying to find parking for a panthers game. you could offer short-term parking for events, or monthly parking for commuters. honestly, so many people need monthly parking or a place to store a vehicle. if you're near a light rail station, that's even better. this is a super low-cost way to start a business in charlotte with an asset you already have.  
  
3. mobile food or coffee truck with a specific niche. ok, hear me out. food trucks are everywhere, but there's a real lack of late-night food options in charlotte, especially ones that aren't fast food. a food truck that caters to the late-night crowd in neighborhoods like noda or south end could do really well. or, think about a coffee truck that sets up near all the new construction sites in the university area or steele creek, serving the workers there. the key is to find a niche and a specific location. startup costs are higher with a truck, but the mobility gives you a lot of flexibility.  
  
4. home services for an aging population. this is a big one. charlotte has a growing number of retirees, and a lot of them want to stay in their homes as long as possible. this opens up a ton of business ideas: handyman services that focus on accessibility modifications (like installing grab bars), errand running services, or even tech support for seniors. these businesses are built on trust, so good old-fashioned word-of-mouth marketing will be your best friend here.  
  
5. corporate wellness consultant. with so many big companies headquartered in charlotte, there's a huge focus on employee wellness. if you have a background in fitness, nutrition, or mental health, you could start a business that consults with these companies to create and implement wellness programs. this could be anything from onsite yoga classes to mental health workshops. startup costs are pretty low if you're just starting out on your own.  
  
6. freelance graphic and web design. this one isn't super unique, but it's a solid business to start in a growing city like charlotte. so many new businesses are popping up, and they all need websites and branding. if you have design skills, you can start this business from home with just a computer and software. to stand out, you could specialize in a certain industry, like real estate or craft breweries.  
  
7. personal chef or meal prep service. people in charlotte are busy, and a lot of them are willing to pay for convenience. a meal prep service that caters to busy professionals or families with healthy, pre-made meals could be a great business. you could even specialize in certain diets, like keto or plant-based. you'll need to look into the regulations around selling food from home or renting a commercial kitchen space, but the demand is definitely there.  
  
8. pet services. from dog walking to pet sitting, the pet industry is booming. you could even get more niche, like a mobile pet grooming service that goes to people's homes. with all the new apartment buildings going up, a lot of them are pet-friendly, so there's a built-in customer base. this is another business with relatively low startup costs.  
  
9. brewery and cidery tours. charlotte has a ton of great breweries and cideries. you could start a business that offers curated tours to different spots, maybe even partnering with them to offer special tastings. you'd need a reliable vehicle and good insurance, but it could be a fun way to tap into the local craft beverage scene.  
  
10. home organizing and decluttering. with so many people moving to charlotte, and others just realizing they have too much stuff, a professional organizer could be a lifesaver. this is a business you can start with very little money, and it's all about helping people simplify their lives. you could market your services in neighborhoods with a lot of families or older residents.  
  
so there you have it. just a few ideas to get you started. honestly, the best business to start is one that you're passionate about. do your research, talk to people, and don't be afraid to try something new. charlotte is a great place to be an entrepreneur, so get out there and make it happen. hope this helps",1,1756192231.0,HustleMentality,0,1.0,False

So I replaced my single cup of black coffee in the mornings to a single cup of black tea and the difference is huge.

what's up, Austin. so you wanna start a business here? good call. this city's still growing like crazy and there are tons of opportunities if you know where to look. but honestly, the last thing we need is another generic coffee shop or bbq joint. here are some ideas you probably haven't thought of.  
  
1. specialized home services for the new housing boom. you've seen the million-dollar bungalows and the endless new apartment complexes. what you don't see is the demand for niche services to go with them. think high-end home organization, custom closet design, or even smart home installation services. startup costs can be pretty low if you're doing the work yourself, maybe a few thousand for tools, a website, and insurance. the market is full of people with more money than time.  
  
2. bet you didn't think of this one: a parking rental business with Prked. not gonna lie, parking in Austin is a nightmare, and it's only getting worse. with Prked, you can rent out your driveway, garage, or even a spare spot in your yard for people to park their cars. it's a pretty solid opportunity for passive income. you can offer short-term parking near places like Zilker Park or downtown, or monthly parking for people who need a regular spot. tons of people in Austin need monthly parking for their cars or even for storage. it's a super low-startup-cost business, you basically just sign up and list your space.  
  
3. curated ""keep Austin weird"" subscription boxes. people move here for the vibe. so why not bottle it up and sell it? you could partner with local artists, musicians, and small businesses to create a subscription box with unique Austin-made products. think local hot sauce, a vinyl from a local band, and a t-shirt from a south congress boutique. startup costs would be mostly for sourcing products, packaging, and marketing, so you could probably get it off the ground for under $10k.  
  
4. a truly local tour company. yeah, there are a million ""austin city tours,"" but they all go to the same places. what about a tour of the best food trucks, a deep dive into the east Austin art scene, or a historical tour of the city's music venues? you could even offer workshops with local artists or musicians. this is another low-cost startup, you just need a good website and some creative tour ideas.  
  
5. mobile pet grooming and spa. austin is obsessed with dogs. and with the traffic here, who wants to drive to a groomer? a mobile pet grooming service would be a huge hit. you'd need to invest in a custom van, which can be pricey, but the demand is definitely there. you could even offer add-on services like ""pawdicures"" and dog-friendly CBD treatments.  
  
6. a ""fix-it"" service for the tech-savvy but not-so-handy. so many people in Austin work in tech and are great with computers, but they can't fix a leaky faucet to save their lives. a handyman service that's tech-forward, with online booking and transparent pricing, would be a game-changer. startup costs are low, just tools and a reliable vehicle.  
  
7. healthy and convenient meal prep service. with so many young professionals and families in Austin, everyone is busy. a meal prep service that offers healthy, locally-sourced meals would be a lifesaver for a lot of people. you could even cater to specific diets like keto, vegan, or gluten-free. you'd need a commercial kitchen space, so startup costs would be higher, but the recurring revenue model is a huge plus.  
  
8. sustainable living consulting. austin is a very green city, and people are always looking for ways to be more eco-friendly. you could offer home consultations on everything from composting and rainwater collection to solar panel installation. this is a knowledge-based business, so startup costs are minimal.  
  
9. food trucks are a classic Austin business for a reason. but instead of another taco or bbq truck, think niche. what about a vegan food truck, a gourmet grilled cheese truck, or a truck that only sells desserts? the key is to find a unique concept that stands out in a crowded market. startup costs for a food truck can range from $20,000 to $100,000, depending on the truck and equipment.  
  
10. freelance creative services. Austin is a hub for creatives, but there's always a demand for talented writers, designers, and marketers. if you've got a skill, you can build a business around it. with so many startups and small businesses here, there's a constant need for freelance help. this is the lowest startup cost business on the list, you just need a laptop and a good portfolio.  
  
hope this helps someone out. starting a business is tough, but it's worth it. and in a city like Austin, the sky's the limit.",1,1756192109.0,HustleMentality,0,1.0,False

In such frames, the laws of physics, particularly Newton's laws of motion, hold true without needing adjustments for acceleration.

But when I'm on Earth, hold out my coffee mug and let go, it doesn't remain at rest. It appears to move down without any outside force acting on it. And my orientation matters: if I'm upside down, the mug appears to move upwards. It seems to require an adjustment to account for Earth's gravity.

I'm ignoring Coriolis forces here.

Surely being on Earth is a non-inertial reference frame? It is obviously different from being in outerspace or in freefall. Why is it useful to lump freefall and being in a gravity well together?",0,1756192094.0,AskPhysics,2,0.33,False

* **Low in calories** → Plain black coffee has \~2–5 kcal per cup, so it’s a great swap for sugary lattes.
* **Boosts metabolism** → Caffeine can increase your resting metabolic rate by 3–11% according to studies.
* **Fat burning** → It promotes fat oxidation (up to 10–29%), especially during exercise.
* **Appetite control** → Some people feel less hungry after drinking it.
* **Workout booster** → Having a cup 30–60 min before exercise can improve performance and stamina.

⚠️ Of course, it’s not a magic fat burner. Drinking 5 cups a day won’t melt fat away. Too much can cause insomnia, jitters, or stomach issues. Most health guidelines say **2–3 cups/day (≤400 mg caffeine)** is safe.

My (abusive) father whom I’ve stopped talking to since the family discovered his decade long affair has tried reaching out to me a handful of times. He’s maybe actually called me 4  or 5 times when my phone was in sleep mode in the past year and a half.

He also tried to get my brother to convince me to go to therapy with him a year ago (I said he should ask me directly) and ask my partner to have the 3 of them discuss our relationship over coffee (my partner declined because he felt like my brother was being kind of codependent and the issue is between me and my father and none of them really could do anything and my partner is choosing to support me at the end of the day).

From the previous post, my father had left me a missed call and I finally decided to call him back. He said it was an accidental call and tried to play it off like everything was normal asking me how old my cat was now. I told him that was weird for our first conversation and he just laughed it off, said he loves me, and we ended the call. 

He has called me twice since, both times while my phone is in sleep mode. I didn’t bother calling him back because last time it was an “accident” and he had nothing of value to say. But now I’m unsure if I should do something else? He hasn’t texted me or left me a voicemail. 

A few months ago he got into a physical confrontation with my brother too, and my brother was pissed about it for a day but got over it really quickly. Signaling that he hasn’t done any growth. 

I don’t know what to do. He has gone to maybe 2 individual therapy sessions, and then 3 couple sessions with my mom (between 3 therapists total) and eventually said he can’t do it anymore. He begged my mom, saying he’ll do anything besides go to therapy because he feels humiliated. So I know he hasn’t changed. 

Part of me wants to tell him off. Part of me wants to tell him our relationship can be purely financial. Part of me wants to tell him I can’t have a relationship with him until he goes to therapy. 

I have compassion for the terrified inner child that is faced with so much shame and guilt that he keeps sprinting from, and I want to shake him and tell him that it doesn’t get better until he slows down and faces himself for once in his life. And ask a psych student I believe in neuroplasticity and that people can change. But I think he doesn’t have the motivation to. 

I don’t think he ever really cared for me. I think the only time he “tried” was to “shut up his wife” who was in distress about his poor relationship with me. I think he probably does largely care about what my partner thinks of him as well as the community. I think he’d love to talk about me to others to signal that he’s got a good relationship with me.

## What is RapidoCripto24?

RapidoCripto24 is an **automated crypto trading platform** that’s designed to help users—regardless of experience—trade digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even some altcoins. It claims to use **advanced algorithms and real-time data** to help users buy and sell at optimal times. 

The idea is to reduce the guesswork and emotional decision-making that often plagues new traders. Instead of staring at charts all day, you can set your preferences and let the system handle the heavy lifting. Think of it like having a co-pilot who’s good at math and doesn’t sleep.

## Who Created RapidoCripto24?

This is where things get a bit vague. Like many similar platforms, RapidoCripto24 doesn’t make its developers or founders publicly known. That’s not *necessarily* a red flag, since platforms like **Bitcoin Era** also keep their teams anonymous. 

What we do know is that the platform claims to be built by a group of **crypto experts and software engineers** who wanted to make advanced trading tools accessible to everyday users. It’s a common origin story, but so far, the product seems to back up the ambition.

## How Does RapidoCripto24 Work?

The platform works by combining **market data analysis**, **trading signals**, and **automated execution**. Once you set up your account and fund it, you can either trade manually or let the AI-based system do it for you.

Here’s a simplified flow:

1. You set your trading parameters (like risk levels or preferred assets).
2. The algorithm scans markets 24/7 using real-time data.
3. When it detects a potentially profitable trade, it either alerts you or executes the trade automatically (depending on your settings).

This setup is ideal for both **passive investors** and **active traders**. And yeah, you can switch between modes anytime, which I found super convenient.

## RapidoCripto24 Pros and Cons

No platform is perfect, so here’s the breakdown:

**Pros:**
- ✅ Super beginner-friendly UI

hey everyone, so you're thinking about starting a business in san jose? good on you. it's not the easiest place to start something new, not gonna lie, with the high costs and all. but there are some pretty solid opportunities here if you know where to look. i've been around the block a few times with my own ventures, so i figured i'd share some ideas. hope this helps someone out.  
  
1. \*\*accessory dwelling unit (adu) design and build consultant.\*\* bet you didn't think of this one. with the crazy housing prices in san jose, everyone's looking to maximize their property. accessory dwelling units, or adus, are getting super popular. a lot of homeowners are interested in building them for rental income or for family, but the process can be a nightmare of permits and construction hurdles. if you can become an expert in san jose's specific zoning laws and permitting process for adus, you could make a killing. startup costs would be relatively low, mostly for marketing, a good website, and maybe some design software. you're selling your expertise, not a physical product.  
  
2. \*\*Prked parking rental business.\*\* honestly, this is such a non-obvious goldmine in san jose. parking is a huge pain, especially in the denser neighborhoods and near downtown. with Prked, you can help homeowners rent out their empty driveways, garages, or even just a spot in their yard. think about all the people who commute to san jose for work and need a reliable place to park. you could focus on short-term parking near popular spots like the sap center or downtown restaurants. but the real money is in monthly parking. tons of people in san jose live in apartments with limited parking and need a long-term spot for their car. you could build a business just by signing up homeowners with extra space and connecting them with drivers on the Prked app. it's a pretty passive income stream once you get going. startup costs are super low - basically just the time it takes to list your own space or help others list theirs.  
  
3. \*\*hyper-local cultural experience curator.\*\* san jose is incredibly diverse, with large vietnamese, hispanic, and indian communities, among others. instead of another generic tour company, you could create curated experiences that celebrate this diversity. think food tours through little saigon, street art walks in Japantown, or workshops on traditional crafts from different cultures. you could partner with local businesses and artists to create really unique and authentic experiences. startup costs would involve building a website, marketing, and establishing those partnerships. this is a great way to tap into the local culture and offer something that tourists and locals alike would love.  
  
4. \*\*mobile repair service for smart home devices.\*\* everyone in silicon valley has a smart home these days, but what happens when their alexa stops talking to their smart lights? you'd be surprised how many people don't have the time or patience to troubleshoot these things. a mobile service that specializes in repairing and setting up smart home devices could be a huge hit. you'd be catering to the tech-savvy but time-poor population of san jose. startup costs would include a reliable vehicle, diagnostic tools, and marketing to get your name out there.  
  
5. \*\*gourmet, artisanal food truck with a niche focus.\*\* okay, so food trucks aren't a new idea, but in san jose, the key is to have a really specific and high-quality concept. with the high cost of brick-and-mortar restaurants, a food truck is a more affordable way to get into the food scene. instead of just another taco truck, think about something like gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches with unique, local ingredients, or a truck that only sells artisanal donuts with crazy flavors. the startup costs for a food truck can be high, think $50,000 and up, but it's still a lot less than a full-on restaurant.  
  
6. \*\*specialty coffee cart with a pop-up model.\*\* san jose loves its coffee. instead of a full-blown cafe, a mobile coffee cart gives you the flexibility to go where the customers are. you could set up at farmers' markets, office parks, or local events. the key is to have amazing coffee and a unique brand. startup costs are much lower than a cafe, you'd need a good espresso machine, a cart, and the necessary permits from the city.  
  
7. \*\*personal chef service for busy tech professionals.\*\* a lot of people in san jose are working long hours and don't have time to cook healthy meals. a personal chef service that prepares weekly meals for busy professionals could be a great business. you could specialize in a certain type of cuisine, like healthy, plant-based meals or authentic international dishes. startup costs would be for a professional website, marketing, and high-quality cooking equipment.  
  
8. \*\*vintage and upcycled clothing boutique.\*\* thrifting is big, and with a focus on sustainability, a well-curated vintage and upcycled clothing boutique could do really well in a trendy neighborhood like willow glen or the sofa district. you could source your inventory from local flea markets like the berryessa flea market, which is a san jose institution. startup costs would be for rent, inventory, and marketing.  
  
9. \*\*dog walking and pet sitting service.\*\* it's a classic for a reason. people in san jose love their pets, and they're willing to pay for good care. with so many people working long hours or traveling for work, there's a constant demand for reliable dog walkers and pet sitters. startup costs are very low, mostly for insurance, a website, and some basic supplies.  
  
10. \*\*social media management for small businesses.\*\* a lot of the amazing small businesses in san jose are run by passionate people who are experts at their craft, but not necessarily at marketing. you could start a business that helps these local gems with their social media presence. with so many people discovering new businesses on instagram and tiktok, this is a much-needed service. startup costs are minimal, you just need a laptop, a good understanding of social media, and the skills to create engaging content.",1,1756191901.0,HustleMentality,0,1.0,False

They say the camera never lies. But I know better. It flirts, tempts, and sometimes tells beautiful little half-truths. I’m the man behind the lens, chasing the wild, the intimate, the cinematic,those stolen moments where everything feels raw, honest, and just a little electric.

I shoot stories for a living. Sometimes wrapped in lace, sometimes soaked in candlelight. Boudoir, portraits, the spicier side of storytelling… I capture confidence in its most seductive forms. It’s not about posing…it’s about presence, and the way someone lights up when they feel seen.

Off-camera? I’m your classic Irish mischief maker. Inked, emotionally fluent, always with a playlist for the moment, a half read fantasy book in one hand and a cup of cold coffee in the other. I live for twilight walks with my camera in hand and off the cuff road trips, the kind of nights that start soft and end unforgettable.

I’m drawn to soul deep conversation and cheeky chemistry. Give me someone who knows the difference between touch and connection, who likes to blur the lines between muse and co-conspirator.

Tell me—when was the last time you let someone really see you?

All those princess stories and hero movies made me think everyone's born with this special destiny. Like we're all supposed to find our one true calling that makes everything make sense.  
  
I used to think that was so cool. I'd daydream about the day I'd finally figure out what I was meant to do, like finding a secret map to my perfect life. I kept waiting for that lightbulb moment.  
  
But as I got older, nothing got clearer. Actually, it got worse. There was no magic sign pointing me in the right direction. I just felt lost, walking in circles, looking for answers that never came.  
  
It started to really get to me. I didn't have that one big passion everyone talks about. No dream job calling my name. I couldn't even stick with hobbies like normal people do. Nothing made me feel that excited spark I saw in others.  
  
I kept asking myself why do we even need a purpose anyway?  
  
That question ate at me every single day. I felt so anxious and lost. I had no idea what I was doing or why I existed. I didn't know what was worth waking up for.  
  
I spent so long thinking I had to earn my right to exist. Like life was some test and having a purpose was the only way to pass. Without one, I was a failure.  
  
But maybe having a purpose isn't about reaching some finish line. Maybe it's just about keeping us going. Sure, having direction can be nice, it helps things make sense. But thinking we NEED some amazing purpose? That's where we mess up.  
  
When we turn purpose into a must-have, it becomes a prison. Instead of helping us live better, it stops us from living at all. We sit around waiting to find our ""thing"" before we let ourselves actually start living.  
  
But life keeps going whether we've figured it out or not. The sun comes up, seasons change, and time moves on. If we wait for some big purpose before we start living, we'll just end up miserable. We forget that just being alive is reason enough.  
  
So now I think the point of life is just... to live. That's it. Nothing fancy or complicated. Life's purpose is life.  
  
Just being here.  
Just paying attention.  
Just breathing and moving from one moment to the next.  
  
So if you're stuck like I was, beating yourself up for not having it all figured out, just live for the small stuff.  
  
Live for your morning coffee.  
Live for hanging out with your friends.  
Live for the next episode of that show you like.  
Live for good books, new songs, cool art.  
Live for sunny days and green grass and cold water.  
  
Live for all the tiny, random things that make you smile.  
  
That's really all we need. Not some shiny purpose that proves we deserve to be here. Just showing up and living through the small moments. One coffee, one laugh, one little happy thing at a time.  
  
Life doesn't have to be some big deal to matter. It just has to be lived.",1,1756191737.0,NepalWrites,0,0.99,False

Bahrain’s 2025 Business Landscape: Why Start Here?\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern Bahrain, showing vibrant financial district. and the Reuters 2025 Gulf Market Report, Bahrain’s GDP is projected to surpass USD 45 billion in 2025, with business formation rates up 13% year-over-year since the 2024 economic stimulus.\
Compared to the UAE or Saudi Arabia, Bahrain’s process is quicker, less bureaucratic, and often less expensive. And while Dubai’s DIFC and Riyadh’s new digital licensing are certainly impressive, the Bahraini government (notably the Economic Development Board (EDB)) continues to offer the most direct path to full foreign ownership for entrepreneurs in tech, finance, and professional services. Learn more about Bahrain’s most foreigner-friendly sectors here.\
However, this streamlined approach doesn’t mean you can just walk into the MOICT (Ministry of Industry, Commerce & Tourism) and leave with a Sijil (commercial registration) in one afternoon. You’ll need to prepare an airtight set of documents, matched exactly to your chosen business structure.\
\
Types of Business Entities & Their Documentation Requirements\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration during Bahrain company formation.: The default for SMEs and startups.\
- SPC (Single Person Company): Solo entrepreneurs or foreign founders.\
- BSC (Bahrain Shareholding Company): For large, shareholder-driven projects.\
- Branch Office: For multinational expansion, limited to parent activities.\
- Partnerships (General or Limited):** Favored for family businesses.\
For an in-depth comparison, check this breakdown of Bahrain business structures.\
Common Documentation Across All Structures\
Company formation in Bahrain always means collecting these core documents:\
\
Passport copies of all shareholders/directors (must be color, unexpired; Sultanate of Oman and Saudi nationals can provide national IDs)\
Bahraini National ID (CPR) for local shareholders/directors\
Recent passport-sized photographs (white background, digital & print)\
Proof of address (utility bill or bank statement, issued within 3 months)\
Memorandum & Articles of Association (MOA/AOA) – template or bespoke\
Board Resolution (for corporate shareholders) – properly notarized\
Parent company documents (for branches), including:\
Certificate of Incorporation\
Trade License/CR\
Board Resolution authorizing Bahrain branch setup\
Power of Attorney for authorized signatory\
Bank reference letters (sometimes requested by certain sectors)\
\
\
I once arrived at the MOICT in Diplomatic Area just as they closed for Jummah prayers, missing my slot for document validation (rookie mistake). Plan for prayer times and local holidays—timing is everything!\
\
Extra Documentation by Business Type\
\
Regulated Sectors (finance, healthcare, education):\
Approval letters from respective authorities (e.g., CBB, NHRA, Ministry of Education)\
\
Professional qualifications or licenses\
\
\
Industrial & Manufacturing:\
\
Environmental clearance (if required)\
\
Lease agreement for industrial premises\
\
\
Free Zone Company:\
\
Application to Bahrain Logistics Zone or Bahrain International Investment Park\

Bahrain Company Formation Process: Step-by-Step, With Expert Tips\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation, showing paperwork and digital preparation., which consolidates MOICT, LMRA, and EDB data. Accuracy here prevents weeks of delays. (Mis-classifying your commercial activity is a frequent error—always double-check SIC codes).\
\
Double-verify your activity with Sijilat’s search engine.\
Prepare a draft business plan — short, but specific on operations and revenue.\
\
Pro Tip: *Schedule your visit to the Seef District Sijilat office Tuesday mornings; this avoids the Monday post-weekend rush and the usual Wednesday crowd preparing for early Thursday closures.\
2. Name Reservation\
\
Submit three business name choices.\
Avoid using restricted or sensitive terms (the list is updated quarterly).\
\
3. Initial Approval\
\
Submit scanned copies of all personal and company documents.\
Receive an approval letter within 2-5 working days.\
\
Insider Shortcut: If you know your business structure and have all scanned documents, you can often get pre-approved online—saving a physical trip!\
4. Lease/Virtual Office Contract\
\
Secure a physical address (business center or serviced office is acceptable for many activities).\
\
Bahrain Bay offices are efficient, but I found the Diplomatic Area landlords to be more flexible with short-term agreements and easier to access during Ramadan hours.\
\
\
Average office rent: BHD 250–500/month for a virtual office, BHD 600+ for dedicated space.\
\
\
5. Final Document Submission & Commercial Registration (CR)\
\
Submit hard copies at MOICT or via authorized service agent.\
Receive your Sijil (CR) number—this allows invoice issuance, bank account opening, and hiring.\
\
For a granular, practical guide to the entire CR process, click here.\
6. Sectoral Approvals & Labor Market Authority (LMRA) Registration\
\
Apply for sector permissions if required (finance, health, etc).\
Register with LMRA for labor quotas and visa sponsorship (expat-friendly sectors have special 2025 incentives—see Reuters for details).\
\
\
Document Preparation Shortcuts and Time-Saving Hacks\
\
Digital First: All major authorities in 2025 accept PDF scans. Submit original hard copies only upon final CR issuance or if explicitly requested.\
Tamkeen E-Sign: Use Tamkeen digital signature for MOA/AOA to skip manual notary visits.\
Office Location: Seef District MOICT is less crowded than Diplomatic Area; Bahrain Bay’s new one-stop business center now issues digital queue numbers (I once saved two hours there on a busy Thursday by using the app).\
Best Time to Apply: Avoid Ramadan late afternoons (offices close early, and key staff may be unavailable for document signing).\
Don’t Forget: Always carry extra passport photos—smaller branch desks may request physical copies “for the file,” even if your digital upload is perfect.\
\
Personal aside: The first time I used a business center in Bahrain Bay, the manager offered traditional coffee and dates during our contract signing. This small gesture led to a key networking introduction, ultimately speeding up my municipal approval.\
\
Bahrain Company Formation Costs and Fees (2025 Update)\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain company formation.\
- Municipality Fees: BHD 80–150 (annual)\
- Office Lease or Virtual Address: BHD 250–500/month (budget options available)\
- Professional Services (if using agent): BHD 500–1,500 (WLL/SPC)\
- MOA/AOA Drafting & Notarization (if not e-signed): BHD 80–200\
For current, itemized cost breakdowns, see this live data hub.\
Surprisingly, the biggest hidden cost is often time. Paperwork errors or missing a government notification can delay operations by weeks. Always check for the most recent document requirements, as MOICT updates the list after every major regulation change.\
\
Compliance: Staying Legal After Company Formation\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation in Bahrain business environment.**\
Outsource this hassle to a reputable provider—top pick: KeyLink’s compliance team. They saved my company from a nasty late-filing penalty in 2023!\
2025 Regulatory Change: As of April 1, 2025, all new entities must e-file annual accounts via the Tamkeen portal within 90 days of fiscal year-end. Delays incur a BHD 250 penalty—don’t get caught out.\
Common Mistake: Underestimating Annual Compliance\
Newcomers often assume that after formation, compliance is year-end only. But regular VAT, monthly LMRA payroll reports, and CR renewals are all required. Proactive reminders and a good relationship with your accountant make a world of difference (I use KeyLink—their local knowledge is unmatched).\
\
Foreign Ownership, Sponsorship, and Bahrain’s Unique Advantages\
\
Alt text: Professional business support and consultation in Bahrain business setup.\
\
No local sponsor required in most sectors (WLL/SPC/BSC).\
Special rules for Professional Services: Some activities may require a qualified Bahraini national as a nominal partner (not always with shareholding interest), but this is clear from the outset and usually procedural.\
Free Zones: Full repatriation of profits, zero import/export duties, and fast-tracked regulatory processes. Explore Bahrain’s free zones.\
\
\
Learn more about 99% foreign ownership in Bahrain and how it works.\
\
Unpopular opinion: Bahrain’s less-publicized business-friendly approach, its open banking, and English-language documentation options make it far more navigable than the UAE for first-time founders.\
\
Cultural and Local Business Practices You’ll Encounter\
Don’t underestimate the role of majlis meetings—informal, protocol-rich gatherings where business cards are exchanged with both hands, and deals often start over sweet dates and cardamom coffee. During Ramadan, official business hours shrink, but private networking often intensifies after iftar.\
Whenever dealing with government offices—MOICT, LMRA, Sijilat, and Tamkeen—maintain a formal, respectful approach. Dress code is conservative; a blazer or smart abaya is always appropriate.\
And: If you’re invited to a business lunch during the approval process, accept! These moments often accelerate approvals, as trust is built face-to-face in Bahrain’s close-knit business circles.\
\
Tangent: Bahrain’s Start-up Ecosystem and Tamkeen Grants\
It might seem off-topic, but the Tamkeen entrepreneurship grants of 2025 have changed the funding landscape. Securing a Tamkeen grant requires your company’s Sijil and proof of premises—but the deadlines align with company formation, so syncing these processes can speed up your business launch by months. (Synchronizing Tamkeen and MOICT submissions saved my team from losing out on a crucial 2024 grant window.)\
\
Frequently Asked Questions: Bahrain Company Formation & Documentation\
What are the absolute minimum documents needed for a WLL in Bahrain?\
\
Valid passport copies (color) and passport photos for all shareholders and directors\
Proof of address for all foreign shareholders\
Draft MOA/AOA\
Lease/virtual office agreement\
Initial business activity approval from Sijilat\
\
More on step-by-step requirements here.\
Do I need a local sponsor to start a business in Bahrain?\
No, for most activities you do not! Bahrain allows 99-100% foreign ownership in a wide range of sectors, far ahead of the UAE or Saudi models.\
Find out where a sponsor may be required.\
How long does company formation usually take if I prepare all documents correctly?\
10–14 working days for most structures, provided all documents are complete and correctly formatted. Regulated activities (finance, education, healthcare) can take 2–6 weeks due to sectoral approvals.\
What’s the biggest mistake entrepreneurs make with documentation?\
Missing a required notarization, providing outdated address proof, or failing to translate documents into Arabic (if required). Use a professional agent for new ventures—errors delay the Sijil and cost valuable operating time.\
Where can I get help with accounting and post-registration requirements?\
Local providers like KeyLink offer bundled packages for year-round compliance, VAT, and payroll—highly recommended for startups and SMEs.\
\
Ready to launch your Bahrain business? Do your homework, prepare your documents with precision, and embrace Bahrain’s unique business culture—you’ll soon be networking over Arabic coffee in the heart of the Gulf’s most dynamic financial haven.\

Every time I try, I get severe acid reflux (rebound effect). I’ve already given up my beloved morning coffee, spicy food, alcohol, sweets, etc. But you also have to live a little, so once in a while I’ve had a glass of wine with friends. But not very often.

I’ve tried tapering slowly (every other day) and using over-the-counter medication for support - but it still doesn’t really work.

**Quick strategy to** [**lock in the savings**](https://www.dailybargains.com/m/kohlsclearance)

1. **Shop early in the window**—the extra 50% off runs **through September 1**, but the best sizes and colors won’t.
2. **Hit the $49 threshold** for **free shipping**, or choose **free store pickup** to secure inventory locally.
3. **Use your Kohl’s Rewards® account** to rack up **Kohl’s Cash** while you clearance-hunt.
4. **Prioritize high-impact items**: jeans under $10, boots under $20, and sheet sets up to 80% off are the fastest-moving categories.

**Bottom line:** The overlap between the **August 24–31** clearance window and the **August 25–September 1** extra 50% off creates a short runway to snag **up to 85% off**. Inventory is finite, and popular sizes go first—**while supplies last**.",1,1756191595.0,dailybargains,0,1.0,False
1n0ex8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1n0ex8l/blocking_family/,Blocking Family,"So a little back story my(22) husband Henry (23) and his cousin Earl (23) are pretty close. Grew up basically like brothers. When Henry and I got together he kind of pushed me to try and get close with Earl’s wife.  I tend to get super anxious and overthink all my interactions. This started to kind of cause some tension between Henry, Earl, his wife, and I. I always felt like I was intruding or being annoying. I would apologize constantly. Henry just kept pushing me to be more open with his cousin and it felt like it just made things worse. Fast forward Henry proposed to me and Earl seemed less than thrilled. He definitely thought we moved too fast, but at the end of the day it was our choice. Earl’s dad Michael(55) wanted to marry us. I was standoffish about the idea at first, but Henry said Michael was cool. Well Michael said he wanted to go over some stuff before he married us. Kind of like premarital counseling, but not really. It was like 3 sessions and we didn’t go over anything related to the wedding. Earl told Henry he really didn’t think meeting with Michael was a good idea. Henry brushed it off as it was his uncle and he never started him wrong.  So this is where the issues really started to happen. The first meeting we had met at a little coffee shop. Michael was super friendly to me and acted as though I was the best thing since sliced bread. I was slightly uncomfortable, but figured Henry’s family was just very supportive. We started out talking about how we met and the wedding. It was going well. After maybe an hour of light conversation Michael asked us if we talk to James. Now by this point I had stopped trying to be friend with James and his wife all together. I felt I was being iced out and I didn’t want Henry to lose his cousin. I just kind of shrugged and told Michael I wish things were different. I really wanted to be friends with Earl’s wife. I have next to no friends and it’s hard being early 20s trying to make friends. Henry explains a little bit of the situation. Michael proceeded to make that entire evening about his relationship with Earl. We were super confused because it was supposed to be about our wedding. Michael told us James and his wife were saying horrible things about us and it kind of solidified in my mind that I would never become friends with his wife. The next session we didn’t talk about the wedding. Michael asked who Henry’s best man was and Henry told him it was Earl. Michael proceeded to try and convince Henry to kick Earl out of best man. Basically saying that Earl made comments about us not meshing well together. Henry was super bummed out hearing this. They hung out quite a bit so we didn’t understand where this was coming from. On the way home I asked if Henry told Earl about any disagreements we have had. He said no and told me they talked about disc golf and hiking. We didn’t end up going to the third session because I was just really uncomfortable by that point. I didn’t feel good about the things he said Earl said. We contacted Earl and his wife, asking if they could come over for dinner so we could chat. At dinner we found out that Michael was lying to us the entire time. Earl and his wife had text proof of what they said to Michael. Earl never saw Michael in person because he hated him. There was no contact besides around our wedding since they would be interacting. We found out Michael was setting us both up to dislike one another. Come the wedding Michael married us, but was treating me differently. It was like a switch flipped. He started trying to pin my husband and I against each other. Saying my husband was a bad person and he was going to hurt me I was so upset because we had just had a beautiful ceremony. He was ruining our reception. Well Earl and him ended up getting into a bad fight and stopped talking completely. Michael completely stopped reaching out to Henry and it seemed like everything was fine. Now I just have Michael and his wife on Facebook and it really really bothers me. I asked Henry if I could delete them and he said I should just leave it to save face, but it’s just super annoying knowing they are so fake.  I don’t want them seeing my life. Should I just block them without telling anyone and hope it never gets brought up? ",1,1756191595.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

## What is Siguranta Tradex?

Siguranta Tradex is an **automated trading platform** that helps users buy and sell assets like crypto, forex, and stocks using AI-driven technology. Think of it as your digital co-pilot for trading — it analyzes market trends, generates trading signals in real-time, and auto-executes trades on your behalf.

What makes Siguranta Tradex stand out is its **simplicity**. You don’t need to be a finance wizard or spend hours analyzing charts. With a few setup steps, you can let the algorithm do the heavy lifting. That said, it’s not a magic money machine — you still need to keep an eye on your settings and manage your risk.

## Who Created Siguranta Tradex?

There’s not a ton of public info about the exact individuals behind Siguranta Tradex, which is pretty typical for platforms in this space. However, based on similarities with other platforms like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge**, it's likely that it was created by a team with experience in fintech and algorithmic trading.

They claim to partner with **licensed brokers**, which is a good sign, but I always recommend doing your own research before depositing funds. Transparency isn’t their strongest suit, but that’s not uncommon in this niche.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Siguranta Tradex Today](https://tinyurl.com/29uds32z)
## How Does Siguranta Tradex Work?

The platform uses an **automated trading algorithm** that scans the markets 24/7. It looks for profitable trading opportunities based on technical indicators and market patterns. Once it finds a potential trade, it either alerts you or executes the trade automatically, depending on your settings.

Basically:
- You sign up and fund your account.
- The AI scans market data and generates buy/sell signals.
- You can choose **manual** or **automated** trading.
- Trades are executed through **partnered brokers**.

You don’t need to download anything — it’s all browser-based. The algorithm claims a **high level of accuracy**, although actual performance may vary depending on market conditions.

## Is Siguranta Tradex a Scam?

So far, I haven’t seen any red flags that scream “scam.” The platform works, withdrawals are processed (though sometimes take a day or two), and the features operate as advertised. But, like any trading platform, **there are no guaranteed profits**, and market risks are real.

Just don’t expect to put in $250 and wake up a millionaire. If someone tells you otherwise, run. That said, Siguranta Tradex seems **legit for what it claims to be** — an automated trading tool.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Siguranta Tradex?

In my experience, they’re responsive — especially when it comes to account or payment issues.

## How do you start trading on Siguranta Tradex?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official website, fill in your name, email, and phone number. It takes less than 2 minutes.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once signed up, you’ll be connected to a broker. You’ll need to verify your identity (standard KYC). Then, deposit the $250 minimum using your preferred payment method.

### Step 3: Start Trading

You can either:
- Use the **demo mode** to test strategies, or
- Switch to **live trading** and let the algorithm start working.

You can tweak settings like:
- Risk level
- Trade frequency
- Asset preferences

1n0eucs,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1n0eucs/my_28m_partner_of_5_years_and_i_27f_moved_in/,"My [28M] Partner of 5 years and I [27F] moved in together, broke up, and now I’m feeling relieved but I wish things were different","My partner and I were together since 2020. We met in college in 2019 and would hang out a lot- we eventually started dating and made it official. During that time we were both naive. I was working at the mall while he was continuously job searching. In 2021 he finally got a stable job and I was happy for him. 

His family did not have the financial means to support him and his sibling the way that other families do. For example, I was able to get a car passed down to me but he did not have that privilege. My family came from a similar background where they’re refugees coming to the states with nothing. My family worked very hard in order for us kids to have a future and wanted to be able to provide things for us. Throughout our relationship, I would be the one driving, especially to places he would want to go to. During 2021-2023 he was very much into different hobbies (plants, computers, aquariums) so we would go to all of these different stores. I enjoyed going to those places with them since it was fun. In addition, I was usually planning the dates. Because he did not have a car, he would want me to come over to his house every weekend since he wasn’t comfortable coming to my house (I also lived 30 minutes away). I never asked for gas money or for him to pay me because that was something I was willing to do for him because I cared. 

I felt like I put a lot of effort in this relationship, not only because I was being understanding of his situation, but I also made an effort for his family. Because I would stay over at his house, his mom would offer me dinner. Usually every Christmas or mother’s day, I would gift her a $100-$200 gift card to her favorite grocery store and I wanted to pay her back in that way. I also tried to build a connection with his dad and would have great conversations with him, along with his sister. A lot of it came out of my heart because I felt like it was my duty as a partner to have a connection with his family, and I enjoyed it. 

During the course of our relationship, we’ve went on expensive trips like Spain, Italy, and Japan. We’ve also had conflict that we had to overcome- some of which weren’t fully resolved but we got through it. I saw a future with him and I thought he saw the same with me considering the amount of years we were together as well as all the things we’ve experienced together.

Things came crashing down when he wanted to move out of his home due to some family issues. I told him that I would be more comfortable moving in if we were engaged/married because I was scared to jeopardize our relationship as well as waste the time and energy since it was a huge investment.  He told me that he wanted a future with me but he wanted to live together first. That made me still unsure and not ready to move in considering at this point in time, we’ve been together for 5 years. I was ready for the next stage in our lives but I had to compromise that expectation of mine because I just wanted him to be happy and not have him suffer through his problems at home. To me, the trial period was the 3-4 years of us dating. I wanted that extra security to feel safe in the relationship. HIs argument against it was that “everybody does it” and that it’s normal which I don’t disagree on. It’s just not something that I prefer when it comes to relationship milestones, I wanted a strong foundation first. I felt misunderstood when I had to give up my expectations but I tried to go in with an open mind. 

Once we moved in, there were too many changes and things that I wasn’t use to, as well as things that I wasn’t really happy with. Although I said I am a very family oriented person, I still deserve space and boundaries. Something that bothered me was how dependent he was on his mom. When he was living at home, his mom would offer to do the dishes for him, clean his laundry, clean his room, buy toiletries for him that he doesn’t even use and so on. At our apartment, she came and made our bed, cleaned the bathroom mirror, or something would just be reorganized. I brought this up to him and said that she is only a guest here and should not feel the need to do that. His response was that he’s her son and she’s just helping him. However, it is also my space and I would like some privacy and control over the things in our apartment too. I told him that the space doesn’t feel like my space due to this situation. His response was that we picked out the furniture together and that I picked the wall color so it doesn’t make sense why it’s not my space. The issue was that the space was not being treated like it was mine due to his family coming over and treating like it was there’s. Because his mom was supporting him in that way for a majority of his life, I felt like there was no motivation for him to do things by himself as well as no awareness for him to provide for me. For example, If I saw that there was dirty laundry from both of us, I’m going to wash it since that’s what I’m going to do to help out my partner. However, he’s unaware of the almost-daily tasks that need to be done and does not have that mental everyday checklist that people have. His argument against me when I asked for him to take initiative on these things that would be taking care of us would be that he built and hauled in the furniture. As much as I thank him for that, considering that he has constant back pain, the furniture was a one time thing and we’re not getting any more in. I felt like he held this above my head because he did all the heavy work but now I’m dealt with tasks that he is not aware of. His overall reasoning was that because he did not come from the same background I did, his mom shows support in these ways. I thought it was unfair for him to compare my upbringing to his, even when my parents came from nothing, because it was almost like an excuse to not be independent. 

During our time at the apartment, there was so much conflict. I admit that I started most of it but at this point, I was fed up because I felt like the energy I put in was not being reciprocated back. I know I mentioned we resolved conflict earlier but usually, he never apologizes and I am always the one who apologizes first in order for us to be okay.  I have so much resentment considering that I drove him everywhere, supported him during the hardest times, and stuck through the relationship when I know things were bad and ugly. I was willing to work things out and never gave up because relationships can really be a reflection of yourself and bring out the worst in us. I wanted someone to grow with and to overcome those obstacles that can sometimes feel impossible. 

We ended up breaking up recently and it was pretty nasty and not how I wanted things to end. I said things to him that I regret and it came from a place of pain, insecurity, and resentment. I moved all of my stuff out in one night and went back to my parent’s house since he wanted me out. Afterwards, I gave him the receipts for the remaining items at the apartment since he said he could pay me for them. He didn’t want to pay above $550 even though the total cost was $1060. His excuse was that he built/set up some of the items (lamps, tv stand, coffee table, two small benches). But the other items were regular household items like dinnerware, etc.  I said that I can discount the labor a couple hundred but he still said it was too much and said to give him a final price in the morning, or that I can just take all of it. He ended up calling me because I said that I would just rather take everything no matter the circumstances. On the phone, he says that “it would be such an inconvenience because we have to set up a time for you to come, I don’t want to talk to you because it’s awkward” and “we would have to lift up the tv and disassemble stuff.” I told him that “I would just rather take the items since I’m no longer sharing them with you.” He says that I’m being petty and then tries to make me out to be a bad person when he’s out with our mutual friend trying to call me toxic and is practically yelling at me telling me that I wasn't a partner to him. He ends up paying me $700- in reality I really did want the furniture lol. We had a phone call prior to that where he said that he “doesn’t want to end on bad terms” and that he doesn’t want me to hate him and vice versa. He said “I hope you don’t fuck me over with the lease” since my name is still on the lease agreement. I felt bad for us breaking up and leaving each other but also, why try to emotionally manipulate me into helping pay when I’m no longer in the relationship and not living there? Overall, I just feel like I’ve been taken advantage of and he only saw me as someone he can benefit from. I never felt like I was a priority. I felt like his true character came out after breaking up. 

I'm really not sure what to think- yesterday I felt so proud of myself for leaving. Today, I feel like total heartbreak. How can I move on from this?",2,1756191275.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

1n0eta9,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusesurvivors/comments/1n0eta9/does_it_ever_get_better/,does it ever get better?,"hi reddit, it’s been a while since i posted on here.

i 20(nb) was in an abusive and negligent relationship for three and a half years, which i only got out of back in march. my ex would constantly talk down to me, make fun of me, belittle me and ignore me when he believed i did something wrong, even if he never expressed what i was supposed to do. i managed to get out, not because i was brave and escaped, but because he got bored of me. when i had tried to leave in the past he would beg me to stay, promising me he would get better, get help, and i believed him. but this time when i tried to leave, he shrugged and continued on with his life like i never mattered in the first place. shortly after i left my ex, i met the guy of my dreams (we’ll call him Gale(23M)) through a mutual friend.

everything with gale has been perfect, we started going out in April, and he’s slowly been introduced to the people in my life. he’s set to meet my mom at brunch tomorrow but i’m now rethinking this because of something that happened roughly an hour ago

Gale is an AMAZING guy, truly incredible, he’s treated me better than anyone ever has, romantically or not. he’s kind and gentle with me, understanding of my past traumas and willing to work with me to get past them. 

but tonight he saw one of those stupid instagram reel “text experiments” where they show a cropped screenshot of a stupid chain of texts.

the text messages went something along the lines of:

“person 1: i love you
i love you
i love you
i love you
i love you bitch
i love you 
i love you

person 2: what did you just call me?

person 1: see, that proves my theory that it doesn’t matter how much love you show to a woman, one negative word will ruin the vibe”

and my boyfriend; the adorable idiot he is, thought that this might be a fun experiment for him to try.

he did(changing the wording because the ‘women’ part didn’t sit right with him, he changed it to someone), and i didn’t care he called me a bitch, i cared that he tried some stupid social experiment on me, especially one that uses a common (simplified) example of abuse and cushioning(i don’t know if this is the proper term, but this is what i have been calling it). surrounding a hurtful word/action with words/actions of love and affection to distract from the hurt. when i pointed this out he immediately apologized and has been apologising non-stop because he realizes that he didn’t think this through, he just thought it was a stupid instagram trend.

i know this may raise some red flags to some people, and some people might think this could be an indication of the chance he will continue to do hurtful things to me and play them off as ‘misunderstandings’(i know the scared, hurt and overthinking part of me is) but i want to remind you all(and myself) that everyone i have ever met has had glowing words about Gale. not a single person has a bad thing to say about his character or actions, and he does tend to not think things through. 

i kinda have a type and it’s dumbass guys with two brain cells that they don’t remember to rub together to form a coherent thought(affectionately, and as a joke, Gale is actually very smart academically, just a little socially lacking)

but like i said, he has been nothing but apologetic and sweet, saying he had no idea that it would hurt me and that he just saw a stupid trend and didn’t think it through.

but suddenly it feels like all the sunshine and warmth i’ve been feeling since i met him has been ripped away. i feel broken all over again. suddenly im not in a hotel bathroom, im in my ex’s place and he’s just said something really awful to me and im hiding so he doesn’t see me cry and say im overreacting. i know im not there but i feel like i am.

i feel like all the bandages i’ve so neatly wrapped myself in have been torn off and im bloody and bruised, bleeding out while he tries to piece me back together. i spent the past hour dry heaving into my hotel toilet because i can’t stomach the thought of being treated like that again.

i don’t know what to do, logically i know he wasn’t trying to hurt me, i know he was just being an idiot and i should forgive him-

but the scared 16 year old in me who just got called a name for the first time by their boyfriend is screaming and clawing at my heart and my brain and my throat and they want to run. they want to block Gale and forget everything about him like how he drinks his dr pepper(no ice; with a straw) or that his favourite superhero movie is the Tim Burton Batman or the way his eyes light up when he finds something he wants to give me. or how sorry he feels when i pay for coffee instead of him because money is tight.

i know he loves me, i know he’s not my ex, i know he didn’t try to hurt me. 

does this feeling ever go away? of bleeding out on the comfort you created with someone new?

Fight me.”,"Food is one of the most important elements of any wedding — in fact, it’s often what guests remember the most. For **Indian weddings**, food is not just about dining, but about tradition, hospitality, and celebration.

# Key Aspects of Food in Weddings

1. **Variety is Essential** – Indian weddings usually feature multi-cuisine spreads: regional delicacies, North/South Indian dishes, chaat counters, international cuisines, and live food stations.
2. **Traditional Touch** – Many couples prefer adding dishes that reflect their cultural roots (like Maharashtrian Puran Poli, Punjabi Chole Bhature, Rajasthani Dal Baati Churma).
3. **Live Counters** – Pasta, dosa, kebabs, mocktails, or dessert stations keep guests entertained while dining.
4. **Presentation & Décor** – The buffet setup is often designed to match the wedding theme, adding a visual element.
5. **Guest Preferences** – Modern weddings now consider vegan, Jain, gluten-free, and healthy food options.
6. **Signature Dishes** – Couples sometimes add their favorite dishes as a personal touch.
7. **Desserts & Sweets** – From traditional mithai to fusion desserts (gulab jamun cheesecake, paan shots), sweets complete the celebration.
8. **Beverage Bars** – Mocktail bars, coffee counters, or cocktail stations during the sangeet/cocktail party are trending.

📌 In short: *Great food = happy guests*. It’s often said that “people may forget the décor, but they’ll never forget the taste.”",1,1756191138.0,weddingtips14,0,1.0,False
1n0errw,https://www.reddit.com/r/pmp/comments/1n0errw/review_of_my_exam/,Review of my exam,"Hi everyone!

I took my exam yesterday morning and got the email last night saying I passed AT in all domains.

To preface this, I barely made the 3 year qualification as a PM, so I don't have much work experience to fall back on.

My prep for the exam was:

1. **PMP Boot Camp**

This course was sponsored by my company and covered the basic knowledge of PMP. The contents covered the PMBOK 6th edition, so I had to do my own study of the 7th Edition. Still, it got me familiar with the ITTOs and other useful terms and covered the 35 hours of education nicely.

2. **Study Hall Plus**

This was a must have. I subbed about 2.5 months before my exam and went though all the practice and mini exams whenever I could. I set aside half a day of the weekend to do a full length mock exam. Definitely do this to train your stamina and timing. Go through all the questions you get incorrect, or marked Low confidence. If you have time, go through all the questions, it helps to understand why the other options are wrong too.

3. **200 Ultra Hard PMP Questions 1-200**, by Andrew Ramdayal

I watched about halfway through just to test myself after finishing all questions in the Study Hall.

4. **110 PMP Drag & Drop Questions and Answers**, by David McLachlan

Useful to watch, because you brush up on your definitions and also get used to the kind of drag-and-drop you might get on the exam.

5. **23 PMP Mindset Principles**, by Mohammed Rahman

The ~~Code~~ Principles are more of a guideline than a set of rules. Its not a sure way of answering the questions, but a good place to start to eliminate some answers. I played the video on long drives just to get them into my head.

6. **PM Aspirant Website**

Again, more practice once I finished Study Hall.

I was averaging 73% for Study Hall Practice Questions and 72% for Study Hall Exams. About 1 - 2 weeks before the exam I got sick of studying and got burnt out, and spent more time video gaming than I should have. Picked back up a couple days before the exam though.

I considered getting Third3Rock's PMP notes, but decided not to. I already had my notes from the Boot Camp, and the payment plan is a little expensive once I converted to my country's currency. I've heard good reviews about it though, so you can check it out too.

AR and DM's channels are good resources too. I didn't have enough time to go through all their videos, but the ones I watched were really useful. I'm not listing all of them here, just the ones that really stuck out for me.

The Exam:

I reached the testing center a little early, and the lady who registered me asked if I wanted to start earlier. I declined, because I wanted some time to calm my nerves. The exam room was pretty standard, cubicles and a computer for each. I was given some whiteboard markers and an erasable notepad. I was allowed to bring my jacket inside too after they checked the pockets. Snacks were to be left at the pantry, and all other belongings in a locker.

I decided to take the short tutorial and set the background colour and font colour to the same as Study Hall. The screen size and font size threw me off for a bit, then I got used to it.

I took both breaks to use the toilet, stretch, and have some snacks and coffee. I would pay for the CCTV footage of me in there, scarfing down an energy bar while doing lunges.

1st 60 questions were a little hard. I flagged about 10 questions. Finished with 160 minutes remaining.

2nd 60 questions were a little easier. Flagged about 6. Finished with 90 minutes remaining.

3rd 60 questions were the hardest. I flagged about 12. Finished with 10 minutes remaining.

Finished the exam thinking I failed, but got a nice surprise once I got my preliminary results.

Overall, about 90% was situation based (what should the PM do, have done, do first, etc) and 10% was theory based. I had 5 drag-and-drop questions, 5 multi-select questions and 1 very simple calculation question(value per iteration). No PERT or

Questions difficulty was pretty similar to the Moderate and Difficult questions from SH. Some could be considered Easy or Expert too. Pretty sure some were the same as some SH questions, just with a few words changed. AR's question structures are easier to understand than the exam. Same goes for the PM Aspirant questions.

The exam is doable. Just read the questions carefully and eliminate the wrong answers. Usually it'll leave you with just 1 or 2 left.

Oh, and wear blue, just in case. Everything except my shoes and belt was blue.

Good luck, and don't forget to celebrate!",3,1756190988.0,pmp,2,1.0,False

And I lost her.,"i can't bring myself to finish Nana. every time i watch, i feel like i’m watching the story of a friendship i once had, one i’ll never really get back. i had my own Hachi. we were inseparable in high school, walking home together every day, getting coffee, going to museums, wandering malls, talking about life like it would always be the two of us. it felt so safe, so constant. even when we argued (and we argued a lot near the end), we always found our way back to each other.

but when i got a boyfriend, everything changed. she once told me, half-joking but not really, that maybe she had been in love with me and just didn't realize it. i laughed it off, but now i wonder if that was her truth bleeding out in a way she didn't know how to name. i wonder if things would have been different if i had paused, if i had asked her what she really meant, instead of pretending i didn't hear the ache behind it.
around that time, we argued constantly, and our friendship became this exhausting on-and-off cycle.
and then, quietly, the boyfriend became the wedge between us. she told me she felt replaced, like i always chose him over her and in a way, i did. i can see now how much it must have hurt her to suddenly feel like she was no longer my first choice.

i remember one fight where she yelled at me for being friends with someone she thought was toxic.
afterwards , she apologized and admitted it was just because she wanted to protect me. that was who she was. fiery, protective, possessive in a way that felt suffocating sometimes, but also safe, like nothing could touch me as long as she was around. after graduation, we didn't speak for six months.
until one day, we ran into each other at a café. she was the one who said hi first. she told me later that she had spent that time trying to find me in other people, but no one ever compared. hearing that broke me. because the truth is, no one has compared for me either. i didn't know how to hold onto both her and him, and so, in the end, i lost parts of her.


we’re still friends now, but it isn't the same. we both have boyfriends, we both have our own lives, and whatever we were back then feels like a closed chapter. i grieve it quietly, even though i know she's still here. watching Nana feels like watching us. the closeness, the fights, the possessiveness, the love, and then the inevitable distance. i don't think i’ll ever be able to finish the anime, because it feels like reliving the loss of something that defined me. 

what if i hadn't chosen wrong? what if i had been braver, more honest? what if i had seen her feelings for what they really were, instead of running away from them?
Nana hurts because it reminds me that sometimes, the love of your life isn't a partner at all, sometimes it's the friend you let slip away. i don't know how to forgive myself for that, or how to grieve someone who's still here, but not here in the same way.",12,1756190877.0,NanaAnime,5,1.0,False
1n0eqp4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwentiesIndia/comments/1n0eqp4/turned_25_last_week_and_ive_been_thinking_about/,"Turned 25 last week, and I’ve been thinking about how my idea of love has shifted since 20.","At 20, “love” was basically an exam I wanted people to pass. If you couldn’t hold forth on Marx and dialectical materialism at 2 AM while also recommending me obscure poetry, you were automatically disqualified. Love was politics, books, compatibility, and deep conversations performed like duels. I curated people the way one curates a bookshelf,  impressive spines, annotated margins, preferably out of print.

At 25, love feels less curated and more… lived. It’s less about intellectual sparring and more about being understood without the footnotes. I want someone who listens instead of waiting for their turn to speak, who makes me feel seen rather than merely observed, who can inhabit silence without treating it as dead air. Someone who can take my spirals, my contradictions, my “muddy grey areas,” and not try to resolve them like a math problem, but sit with them like they’re weather.

At 20, I mistook intensity for intimacy. At 25, I know intensity burns out, but attention endures. And perhaps the most revolutionary thing now is not a lover who cites Adorno at midnight, but one who remembers how I take my coffee, laughs at my worst jokes, and listens with the kind of presence that feels scandalously rare.

So yes, at 20, love was a revolution. At 25, it’s a quiet rebellion against being misunderstood.

# Core World Systems

# Storage & Inventory

* **Logical storage:**
   * Closets/Dressers → clothes, accessories, shoes only
   * Fridges/Pantries → food, drinks, fruit, crops, fish only
   * Coolers → fish, drinks, food, fruit, and crops only
   * General Storage → furniture + misc. items
   * Backpacks/Bags → functional storage on the go
   * It should not matter if the materials are at your house or in a chest or in your pocket, you should be able to craft regardless
* Bulk crafting + stack improvements

# Housing & Decorating

* HHP-style decorating indoors & outdoors for furniture and paths... terraforming too because it's terrible having to do one block at a time.
* 45° angle furniture rotation
* Partition wall hanging support
* Room size customization
* Windows as placeable items (bay, porthole, casement, floor to ceiling etc. with window pane options like stained glass, frosted, clear)
* Let us rotate the orientation on buildings and houses to face south, east and west and 45 degrees to the left and right
* Interior light spills outside at night (e.g., spooky red glow on Halloween)
* Building customization to match town aesthetic
* Rename your town whenever
* Bridges between cliffs
* Rugs outside
* Finer grid system for bridges and inclines so that they can line up with any building entrance and path
* Let me put full flowers, turnips, and bushes in storage
* Laying down custom paths makes them show up on the map and villagers use it as such. When creating it just toggle it as a path. You can also select sounds for custom design codes (walking on wood, dirt, grass, snow, stone, etc.)

# Weather

* Weather effects: mud, puddles, ice patches, storms, seasonal flower, fruit tree, and crops growth (as to be in season, otherwise it won't grow like bushes)
* Seasonal river/pond freezing → ice skating + ice fishing
* Add swimming in rivers
* Severe storms: tear up flowers, drop sticks, and trash (boots, tires, and cans)
* Repairs every 3–6 months for inclines/bridges

**Clothing/Custom Designs**

* Add-to-cart at Able Sisters
* Sable can recolor clothing/accessories/shoes
* Make weather appropriate clothing have a function!!! 
   * If your character walks outside with a tank top and shorts in the late fall/winter you stop and shiver a lot, sneeze, get sick, slip on ice patches or snow when running. 
   * If you wear too many layers in the heat, your character sweats and or passes out in the summer/early fall. 
   * Must wear rain gear or umbrella when raining on rainy days. In the cold season: shivers, sneezes, getting sick. Otherwise you just slip on mud or puddles when running.
* More custom design options (skirts, shoes, pants, hats)
* At least 150 custom design slots PLEASE
* More intuitive custom design portal with categories like popular and new 
* Swimwear variety (one-pieces, swim dresses, trunks) + snorkel for longer dives
* Villagers wear pants/skirts + shoes properly if applicable 
* Custom designs are saved permanently as physical items like a snapshot even if the custom design is changed.
* Glow in the dark custom design colors!!!

**Exploration & Activities**

# Classic Features Brought Back

* Tortimer’s island mini-games: obstacle course, balloon race, treasure hunt, fishing/bug competitions, etc.
* Police Station: 
   * Report players
   * Lost & found
   * Driver’s license setup if cars in the game (or just online player ID like passport in NH)
* Standalone Roost 
   * Returning barista minigame
   * Keep gyroid collection
   * Order custom coffee order to give them to villagers and special NPCs
* Celeste’s Observatory: design constellations and possibly glimpse Gulliver in his spaceship by chance
* Post Office: run by Pelly, Phyllis, Pete
   * Wire bells seamlessly to other players online
   * This is where players make/edit their town’s postage stamp
   * Send letters
   * ADB access
   * Sell wrapping paper
   * Maybe buy moving boxes and packing tape for villagers as a unique final quest?
* Harv’s Campground: Amiibo villagers for ones that have camper vans and regular villagers you can invite to live in your town. You can decorate this spot freely.

# New Additions

* **The Caves:**
   * Spelunking guild run by Resetti + Don. They sell helmets, shovels, rope, headlamps, food for buffs, and medicine. It’s a little call back to what Animal Crossing was supposed to be initially (dungeon crawler but make it chill and cute)
   * Dangerous creatures (scorpions, spiders, centipedes)
   * Catch cave species (salamanders, blind catfish, isopods, glowworms)
   * Mine gems (like New Leaf)
   * If you pass out, Resetti rescues + scolds
* **Pascal’s Grotto:**
   * Pascal trades scallops and trash (boots, cans, and tires, etc.) for pearls that can be used to buy special items from him (furniture, clothing, diy recipes). He has his own grotto you can visit via diving. When you dive you can actually see underwater now with all the coral and fish/sea creatures.

# 

# City Hub

Accessible via train/bus/ferry/subway system whatever it ends up being. Unless we have cars in the game and you can just drive yourself. 

# Stores & Services

   * More hairstyles, beards, and possibly makeup? (Mascara, blush, eyeshadow, lipstick, gloss? Idk could be cute)
* CJ & Flick’s apartment (unlocks via special dialogue after three fishing tourney/bug off visits between the both of them. Six in total.)
   * The apartment unlocks after you’ve sold to both of them 5+ times and triggered a special dialogue like: “Hey, next time you’re in the city… come by. We’ve got a sick place.”
   * 2 related Mini-Games
   * Ask Flick for commissions while you’re there for either fish or bugs.
* Re-Tail
   * Cyrus can craft diy recipes for you so you don’t have to collect materials for a premium only after you’ve crafted it at least once. He can also let you choose the colorway while he’s at it so you don’t have to use customizing kits. Up to 5 at once.
   * Reese auctions off your unwanted furniture and buys your diy recipes and hot items. Bells are wired to your account when an auction sale is made.

   * Weeknights: Dr. Shrunk routines for reactions
   * Visiting villagers in the city actually go in
* KK’s music studio (player music creation/remixes)
   * When KK isn’t performing at Club LOL he’s now opened up a music studio that allows players to make their own music kind of like a more complex version of town tune that plays for a minute before looping. They can also remix KK’s songs and request their mixtapes to be played at Club LOL and can request copies to sell to other players online for bells.

**Other Special Characters**

* Wisp: Still randomly shows up. Breaks into 5 pieces like usual. As a reward he gives out new Wisp specific, ghostly furniture. After you’ve cycled through the furniture, he is more comfortable around you and doesn’t get scared. Instead he just says he can grant you a small wish if you help with a small quest. Once you’ve completed it he can grant you luck, money, friendship. He also gives more lore drops about what he is. PLEASE.
* Rover: The first time you see him, he asks if you want to create a postage stamp for your town so other players can add it to their stamp collection. He also gives you a stamp journal for this. After that, he randomly shows up in different areas of your town and just talks in mysterious quips and sounds vaguely wistful lmao. (You can get the stamp from the town you’re visiting from its post office!) You can trade your stamps for rewards from Rover maybe?
* Gulliver: three forms (sailor, pirate, returning astronaut) → 
   * Sailor Gulliver needs you to retrieve his cargo from the water
   * Pirate Gulliver needs you to find his treasure map pieces then find the buried treasure
   * Bring back astronaut Gulliver by finding parts and fixing his spaceship after he crashes. Leaves a crop circle on the grass when he leaves for space again.

* Wendell: returns in dream visits as design sharer (not the damn soulless kiosk)

# Skills System

* Fishing
* Bug catching
* Farming/Gardening
* Cooking
* Mining (new from the caves)

**Buffs from Food**

Depending on your skill level, food can come out poor (0%), okay (5%), great (10%), and perfect (20% but rare).

# Everyday Utility Buffs

* **Energy Boost** → uproot trees, chopping them in one go, break rocks in one go (but get all materials omfg) 
* **Speedy Feet** → short burst of faster walking/running.
* **Focus** → decreased tool breakage 
* **Bell Magnet** → increased opportunity for finding money while fishing/diving, shaking trees, villagers offer more when trying to buy stuff from you, money tree chance for 99,000 per bell bag goes up.

# Catching & Collecting Buffs

* **Sharp Eyes** → bugs and fish spawn a little more frequently.
* **Steady Hands** → longer “catch” window for fish and bugs.
* **Lucky Catch** → slightly higher chance of rare fish/bugs spawning.
* **Forager’s Nose** → more forageables (mushrooms, flowers, weeds) show up.

# Social & Friendship Buffs

* **Friendly Aura** → villagers gain extra friendship points from interactions.
* **Charm** → increased chance a villager will accept a hangout invite.
* **Generous Heart** → gifts give a bigger boost than usual.

# Exploration & Risk Buffs

* **Thick Skin** → doubled chance to not pass out from dangerous creatures (e.g. only passing out after being stung four times by bees or stung/bit twice by tarantulas, scorpions, and centipedes.) 
* **Medicine** → works the same, resets your health. (not really a buff just thought it should go here)

You can only stack two buffs from food

**Other Buffs**

* Specialty lucky items/furniture/clothing kept in your house or are worn have a fixed luck boost that affect your catching/collecting, friendships, and money.
* Katrina’s fortunes can either increase or decrease your luck
* Katrina’s incense buffs
* Birthday wish buff
* Shooting star wish buff
* Wisp wish buff

These can be stacked together with food buffs freely (e.g. 2 food buffs, lucky items at home, lucky clothing, Katrina’s fortune, incense buff, and a shooting star buff all in one day). Buffs are shown on the top left of your screen. Temporary buffs are: Incense, shooting stars, wisp wishes, birthday wishes, fortunes, and food. They only last a day. Food buffs can be taken off by pooping (lmao) or eating something else (overwriting your buff)

**Villager & NPC Life**

# NPC Housing & Schedule

* **NPCs live in town:** Tom Nook, Nooklings, Isabelle, Pelly, Phyllis, Pete, Copper & Booker, Brewster, Blathers, Celeste
* Shops double as homes for space-saving (e.g., Nooklings, Mabel & Sable, Celeste)
* Fixed daily schedules → walk around town on days off, and can build friendships with them over time like other villagers.
* Villagers can become roommates → expand population, but compatibility matters (they won’t move in together if their personalities clash)

**Villager Friendship Improvements**

* Friendship unlocks villager phone numbers:
   * Call for hangouts or ask for location to easily find them
* Villagers help in hangouts (watering flowers/crops or weeding)
* Hugging + custom coffee gifting
* Villagers initiate games:
   * Bug/fish challenges
   * Treasure hunts
   * Races
   * Quizzes
   * Rock paper scissors
   * Card game
   * Coin toss
   * Hide and seek
* Expanded requests: redesign house exterior/interior, outfit opinions, gather snack ingredients, more open ended questions like in WW etc. your responses contribute to friendship levels.
* Bring back random villager scams/haggling (“hey… I see you have \[insert furni/clothing here\]. I’ll take it off your hands for 100 bells”) lmao. Rejecting lowers friendship levels.
* Bring back task chains + fetch/timed quests

# Interactive Furniture & Items

* Sports: soccer, basketball, volleyball, swings, slides jungle gyms
* The damn rides! Let me ride the teacups and carousel and others.
* Cooking: grills, stoves, smokers, oven, campfire, pickling jars, espresso maker, coffee maker

* **Bunny Day**: One-day event only, competitive egg hunt w/ golden eggs that have bells in them
* **Bright Nights Return (December)**: Voting + player participation this time
* **Toy Day**: Keep gift exchange, delivery minigame, add Jingle wish letters (write what you want for Toy Day and send before Dec 23 deadline) Brewster sells hot chocolate like he does on Valentine’s day (or you can choose coffee). An hour before going to bed, you can see villagers drinking hot chocolate in their houses in their pajamas waiting for Jingle. New cooking recipes like gingerbread cookies, hot cocoa, fruitcake, etc.
* **Halloween**: Costume contest added
* **Turkey Day**: Potluck, everyone brings a different dish. Villagers can ask you for help on getting ingredients for their dish. Help Franklin make the main dish of your choosing in a cooking minigame (Cooking Mama lite style). Actually take the “leftovers” for special buffs.
* **April Fools**: Bring back April Fools Day with Blanca same mechanic as New Leaf but add pitfall seeds buried around town too by villagers. Funny if you fall into them or dig one up thinking it’s a fossil. 
* **Birthday**: For your birthday before you blow out the candles you get to pick a wish theme (money, luck, friendship). Every villager you have a high friendship level with gives you a birthday gift (could be furniture, clothing or bells). The pinata cupcake is cute. Keep it so you can share the cupcakes for more friendship points or keep them for yourself for a special buff. 
* **Valentine’s**: Chocolate boxes w/ buffs from high-friendship villagers

# Flea Market

* Let us be able to build a small greenhouse via Leif’s help so we can grow out of season fruits/veggies/flowers.
* Tree stump patterns return from NL
* Garden pots, raised beds, real docks, pond decorations (lily pads, cattails, lotus flowers, etc.)
* Beekeeping: honey production, candle making (diy recipe ingredient: beeswax) + aids flower breeding

# Golden Tools (Unbreakable, Not Craftable)

* Axe → from Leif after sapling purchases
* Fishing Rod → from C.J. after completing fishdex
* Net → from Flick after bugdex
* Shovel → from Resetti after cave milestone
* Slingshot → 100 balloons
* Watering Can → Isabelle after perfect town

Tool durability for non golden tools are shown so you’re not in the middle of mining a rock and then suddenly it just breaks. (TERRIBLE)

*Where the Swallows Try to Soar and the Dragons Clench Their Fists (and ERAs)*

---

### Parse the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?

The Chunichi Dragons enter this matchup as the statistical darling, with implied win probabilities ranging from **58% to 60%** across bookmakers (decimal odds: 1.65–1.72). The Tokyo Yakult Swallows? A slightly less rosy **45% to 48%** (odds: 2.08–2.20). The spread (-1.5 for Chunichi) and total line (5.5 runs) suggest a low-scoring, pitcher’s duel—perfect for fans of “thrilling” games where the highlight reel consists of groundouts and the occasional “wait, that was a strike?!”

Key stat: **Chunichi’s starting pitcher, Taikoh Ogawa, has a 2.76 ERA this season**, while the Swallows’ rotation is a patchwork of hope and mild despair. Their MLB import, Lambart, sports a **5.72 ERA**—the kind of number that makes you check if your coffee’s still hot.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Roster Drama, and Netflix?

Let’s unpack the chaos:

* **Chunichi Dragons**: Ogawa is healthy, and their bench includes Aiba, who’s gone 5-1 with a 3.25 ERA. The Dragons’ depth is solid, like a well-stocked pantry during a blackout.
* **Tokyo Yakult Swallows**: Their rotation is a Russian nesting doll of uncertainty. Yoshimura (3.19 ERA) is the “safe” pick, but the team’s reliance on Lambart—a pitcher so error-prone he makes a leaky faucet look competent—feels like betting on a magician who forgot his rabbit.

Oh, and here’s a fun tidbit: The NPB just announced Netflix will stream the **2026 World Baseball Classic** *without* involving local leagues. While that’s a corporate po

In the place I used to call home, friendships were built over years — through shared experiences, laughter, and the comfort of knowing someone had your back. Now, in a completely new environment, it's getting very lonely & sad.
I’m looking to connect with people who are kind, genuine, and curious about the world — just as I am. I enjoy deep conversations, spontaneous adventures, shared laughter, and learning about different perspectives. Whether it’s grabbing a coffee, exploring the city, or simply chatting about life, I’m open to the journey of building new friendships here.

Though being new in the city comes with its share of loneliness, it also offers the gift of new beginnings. I’m hopeful and excited about the connections I’ll make — the friends who will eventually make this new city feel like home.

1n0em0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ok-Series5923/comments/1n0em0w/what_are_auxiliary_engines_on_ships/,What Are Auxiliary Engines on Ships?,"https://preview.redd.it/5nv112kf7blf1.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=a24ba021a91bc769793b015cf83a7d57fc31545a

If you’ve ever wondered how a ship keeps the lights on, powers cranes, or runs the AC when docked or even mid‑sea, meet the **auxiliary engine** the unsung hero of marine machinery.

**What are they?**  
[Auxiliary engines are basically backup power](https://www.shipsparesworldwide.com/post/a-guide-to-auxiliary-engines-on-a-ship) units on ships, usually four‑stroke diesel engines driving alternators. Unlike the main engine which pushes the ship forward these guys pump out electricity for everything else: lights, navigation, pumps, galley gear, HVAC, you name it.

**Why are they a big deal?**

* If the main engine is off (think port, anchoring, or just chilling), the auxiliary engine makes sure power keeps flowing.
* Ships don’t run just one! Most have 2–4, so there’s always backup if one needs repair or things go sideways.
* Blackouts at sea? Almost never, thanks to these engines’ built‑in redundancy.

**Where do they fit in the marine industry?**  
They’re absolutely everywhere cargo ships, tankers, ferries. Modern versions are compact and tucked into clever spaces below deck. While most are diesel, some next‑gen ships use hybrids or turbines, but diesels rule the sea for now.

**How do they work? (Basics, no engineering degree needed):**

* Engine spins → turns alternator → makes electricity.
* That power gets routed to the ship’s switchboard and out to systems like navigation, safety, and onboard “comforts.”
* Key parts include the engine (prime mover), alternator, fuel and lube oil systems, and a bunch of sensors/controllers to keep it safe.

**What’s the maintenance routine?**  
Any marine engineer will tell you, keeping these running is as routine as your morning coffee:

* Regular checks on filters, fuel purity, and lube oil.
* Monitoring vibrations (elastic dampers help a lot) to avoid expensive breakdowns.
* Keep a lean number running too many idling is a waste of fuel and cash.
* Watch for things like abnormal crankshaft flex (it can mean disaster if ignored).

**Why all the fuss about “Auxiliary Engine Technology”?**  
Simple: Ships can’t afford electrical failures. New tech means:

* Tighter controls (digital governors, smart AVRs)
* Cleaner operation (hybrids, fuel-efficient tuning, automation)
* Smart monitoring (IoT sensors, predictive maintenance)
* All leading to safer, greener, more reliable voyages.

**Quick Checklist for Ship Crews:**

* Pre-start: Drain water, check alarms, make sure oil/coolant are topped off.
* Starting: Use compressed air to crank it up, watch oil pressure and voltage.
* On load: Monitor power levels and temperatures, adjust if anything’s weird.
* Shut down: Cool it down, clean up, fill the log book.

**Bottom line:**  
[Auxiliary engines](https://www.shipsparesworldwide.com/) are the workhorse of modern shipping powering everything except the propeller. Without them, the ship’s basically “dead in the water.” Whether you’re running a cargo giant or a small ferry, solid auxiliary engine management means fewer breakdowns and smooth sailing.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Chiba Lotte Marines vs. Orix Buffaloes: A Pitching Duel with a Side of Drama**  
*By Your Humorously Analytical Sports Oracle*

---

**Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Pitchers**  
The numbers scream “Orix Buffaloes” louder than a karaoke singer at a NPB bar. The home team (Orix) is favored at decimal odds of **1.65-1.69**, translating to a **60.6%-61% implied probability** of victory. Chiba Lotte, meanwhile, sits at **2.1-2.2 odds** (45.5%-47.6%), which is about the confidence level of a toddler asked to parallel park.

The spread? Orix is giving **1.5 runs**, which is generous if you’ve got faith in Ryo Katayama’s arm. The total is set at **6.5 runs**, suggesting bookmakers expect a pitcher’s duel. If you’re betting on “Under,” you’re probably right—unless Ishikawa and Katayama decide to throw a home-run derby in the third inning.

**Key Stat Alert**: Lotte’s Sho Ishikawa has a 4.79 ERA this season, which is roughly the same ERA as a coffee maker trying to brew decaf. He’s also struggled in his last two starts, giving up early runs like a bad Netflix password. Orix’s rotation, meanwhile, boasts a 2024 ERA of **2.34-1.91** (per SportingNews), which is about 200% better than Ishikawa’s current form.

---

**Digesting the News: Ishikawa’s Redemption Arc?**  
Lotte’s Ishikawa, the 33-year-old journeyman, is aiming to prove he’s not just a “free-agent experiment.” In a poetic quote that could double as a haiku, he said: *“I am in a better state and will try to deliver that, aiming to lead the team to victory with persistent long innings, even if it means pitching a single ball for a long time.”* Translation: “I’ll try not to fall asleep on the mound this time.”

Orix’s camp? They’re busy promoting baseball in Taiwan with former star Akihisa Nomi (a man whose fastball once broke the sound barrier… and his team’s budget). While Nomi’s guest appearance is more “ceremonial” than “competitive,” it’s a reminder that Orix thrives on global charm—unlike Ishikawa, whose ERA could

(But nothing critical or dangerous in this case.)

ME: 41f, with adenomyosis, uterine fibroids, and a number of chronic illnesses (severe asthma, allergies to everything, hEDS, fibromyalgia, etc.)


ONE WEEK AGO, I had a supracervical laparoscopic hysterectomy. hEDS makes prolapse more likely and leaving the cervix in reduces the likelihood. 

Surgery went fine, but they didn't find the endometriosis I suspected was causing pain with large intestines and bladder. 


DAY 2 AND 3: have a (non life threatening) reaction to Tordol pain med.

Surgeon  switched me to a metric fuckton of naproxen. (Aleve)


DAY 4, I popped up with an E.NOR.MOUS. bruise. Deep purple and the size of a bowling ball, with a soft ball sized one underneath like an upsidedown snowman. Call surgeon and verify it's not a hematoma. hEDS does make you more likely to bruise but YIKES. 


DAY 5, woke up feeling really unwell. Fatigue, dizziness, eyes not focusing well, whole body muscle weakness, heart palpitations..... Couldn't take hydrocodone anymore because that would make the symptoms so much worse. So I'm down to just naproxen and Tylenol. 

ER runs a ton of tests and ""your labs look good"" which is the free space on chronic illness bingo. Best guess is that the Naproxen  is a blood thinner, which would make bruising worse and may also cause light headedness, etc. So I have to dial back on that. 

They confirmed that I do have a couple of small hematomas, but nothing dangerous. 


DAY 6 because of issues with pain meds, I'm a week from surgery and rawdogging it on OTC levels of Tylenol and naproxen. 😬 So I barely sleep because of pain. 

Also I may have new stretch marks from the bloating. They'll go well with the huge number I already have. (I was last September years old when I learned that most women do not get stretch marks from normal puberty with small boobs. It's an hEDS thing.)

OMG itching. Not just the incisions but a huge chunk of my abdomen. I've had shingles that were much more bearable. Which feels familiar...


DAY 7: trying not to scratch but OMG so itchy. 

. Sleep even less. End up laying in bed, crying for hours in pain, too brain fogged to know what I can take. Some of that pain is in my bladder and large intestine - which I had hoped was endometriosis and would be resolved by this surgery.

Did a lot of googling. Surgeon didn't find Endo, but did find what sounds like Pelvic congestion syndrome which is like varicose veins on the inside and can cause pelvic pain.

So instead of resolving all my pelvic pain, this surgery knocked out 2 causes and there's probably 2 to 3 more.  Had more than one pain-fueled cry that this is not done and I'm looking at more doctors, more procedures, more tests, before I can maybe not be in debilitating pain.

Fibromyalgia pain is flaring. Because of course it is.


DAY 8 (today), finally knock myself out with hydrocodone around 9am to be woken up by the tween who has clogged their toilet and flooded their bathroom. It will have to wait for my wife to get home from work.  I get breakfast and coffee at 3pm. 

Finally have half a braincell to figure out a pain med regimen that will hopefully let me sleep, but also won't give me a weird reaction. 

Finally remember why the severe itching seemed familiar! Basically they napalm everything off your skin so you won't get an infection (good) but without the good bacteria, you're prone to fungal infections. (Bad) The same thing happened after my rotator cuff tendon repair surgery this time last year.  

Yep, the hysto is my THIRD surgery in a year. But the only recovery complication from those was the fungal infection in my armpit. 

So I dug out the leftover prescription ointment and will have to call my surgeon to get a refill tomorrow. It takes a few days before the itchiness dies down enough that I'm not tempted to just rip all my skin off. 


 Aand now it's late enough to be day 9. 

How many more days do I have of recovery? (Lolsob) ",1,1756190239.0,hysterectomy,1,1.0,False

Chapter 1 

Josie, you know you screwed up, right?” Vincent Oldham’s voice yanked Josie Pearson out of her fog 

Her eyes zeroed in on his face, sharp and familiar. 

“Wait, didn’t I die?” she thought. 

Two years after her mentor sold her out and landed her in prison, she’d hit rock bottom, crashing her head into a wall to es depression.

Imagining my crew’s here to spring me from jail?” 

“Look, we get it–you’re gunning to join Professor David Lawson’s research team. But that’s no excuse for throwing Natalie under the bus,” Vincent said, his tone sharp. 

“You realize what you’ve done? You accused Natalie of jacking your paper, and now she’s so messed up she hasn’t shown her face at school in days. 

“Keep this up, Josic, and you’re gonna push her off the deep end. When did you turn so cold–blooded?” 

Vincent was getting pissed, slamming his coffee mug on the table when she didn’t respond. 

The sharp clunk snapped her out of it. 

This wasn’t a dream. She was really here, face–to–face with Vincent–ten years younger Vincent. Holy crap. She’d somehow jumped back 

decade. 

Right now, she was still a senior at Aloville Medical School, fresh off nailing the written exam for Professor David Lawson’s elite research 

Tram. 

She’d crushed it, landing a spot in the final round. 

But then came the sucker punch Natalie Kinberg’s thesis was a near clone of hers–same angle, same methods, same vibe. No way that was a coincidence. 

While Josie was digging for answers, rumors about Natalie plagiarizing spread like wildfire, 

David’s project was a big deal–first of its kind in the country, with a team of rockstar researchers, including five of Josie’s seniors. 

Those five had been her crew since sophomore year, always having her back in class and life. They were family. 

Then Natalie showed up, and it all flipped. The support, the late–night study sessions, the laughs–they all went to her. 

Even David, who used to praise Josie’s grind, started treating Natalie like the star pupil. 

When the plagiarism rumors hit, her seniors swore Josie was the one stirring the pot. Even David tore into her, face red with anger. 

Josie wasn’t Natalie’s biggest fan, no lie. She’d been competitive, always trying to outshine her, desperate to reclaim the spotlight. 

But she never spread those rumors or accused Natalie of stealing 

“You really blew it,” Vincent said, his voice softening a bit. “Professor Lawson’s giving you a shot, though. Apologize to Natalie in front of the whole school, and he’ll let it go. 

“He’ll even keep the administration from nailing you with a punishment.” 

“But if you keep doubling down and dragging her name through the mud, you’re done. Expulsion’s on the table! 

\*Fine. I’ll apologize, Josie said, her voice flat, eyes locked on his. 

Vincent was a year ahead, a small–town kid like her who’d fought his way into this school. 

She’d known him longest–four years. She thought he’d have her back, trust her when she said she didn’t start this drama. 

Nope. He was the first one here, pushing her to eat crow. 

Vincent blinked, caught off guard by her quick surrender. Josie didn’t cave this easy, not the Josie he knew. Still, an apology was a win, so he didn’t push. 

“Alright, it’s a deal,” he said. “TII tell Professor Lawson. Write that apology letter tonight. You’re reading it to the whole school tomorrow.” 

Josie’s lips curled into a sharp, bitter smirk. 

She wasn’t that gullible girl anymore. She knew the truth: Natalie spread those rumors herself, playing the victim to turn everyone against Josie. 

Depression? Just a sob story to make the seniors fawn over her. 

But that wasn’t the point now. Josie wanted to know how Natalie jacked her thesis without leaving a trace. 

In her old life, she’d refused to apologize. The mess blew up, the school investigated, and they found nothing on Natalie. 

Meanwhile, Josie got hit with a disciplinary record, her seniors called her heartless, and that stain wrecked her job prospects after graduation. 

Not this time. She wasn’t taking the fall. If someone was going down, it sure as hell wouldn’t be her. 

The next morning, Josie steeled herself to eat humble pie and make her public apology 

She threw on her backpack and stepped out of the dorm, chin up despite the knot in her gut. 

As she crossed campus, the whispers and side–eyes trailed her like a bad smell. 

There she is–Professor Lawson’s former golden girl. Got all jealous and trashed the department’s darling for supposedly jacking her paper.” 

“She thought she was all that with her grades, catching the eye of our live campus hotties. Then Natalie rolls in–just as smart, drop- dead gorgeous, and actually nice.” 

Look at 

that sour face. She’s not even in Natalie’s league. Why those guys still have her back is beyond me. 

“Have her back? Please. They’re all Team Natalie now. This whole ‘say sorry in front of everyone thing? Aiden’s call 

“Aiden’s idea, huh? Josie let out a sharp, bitter scoff and picked up her pace to dodge the gossip. 

She’d barely hit the quad when Jaden Monroe, her senior, caught up. 

Jaden was a first–year grad student who’d saved her bacon back in her senior year. She’d been floundering in her toughest classes, and he’d tossed her his killer notes, helping her ace her exams. 

When he was stressing over grad school apps, Josie had pulled all–nighters hunting down research and reference books for him. She’d never owed him or any of the guys a thing. 

Jaden shot her a look, heavy with disappointment. Josie, I always thought you were one of the good ones. 

“Never figured you’d pull something this low just to get ahead. And Natalie? She’s too kind to even hold it against you 

“You didn’t see her after what you did. She’s a mess–skinnier, totally worn out. Those big, bright eyes? No spark left.” 

“And still, she’s got your back. Went to Professor Lawson on the down low, begging him to let you off this public apology crap. But you‘ gotta have a heart, yeah?” 

“So when you see her, you better say sorry–and mean it, okay?” 

Josie dropped her gaze, lashes hiding the fire in her eyes. “Got it, Jaden, I’ll make things right with her, I swear.” 

“Should’ve thought twice before pulling that stunt. Jaden almost kept going, but seeing her stand there, head down like a kid who got caught, made him ease up 

Deep down, he’d always seen Josie as a solid kid–smart, hardworking, always chasing her academic dreams. Everyone respected her grind. So how the hell did she think screwing someone ovover for a spot 

was okay? Jaden wondered, shaking his head. What a letdown” 

With a heavy sigh, Jaden led her toward Professor Lawson’s office. ",1,1756190095.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

This is the Koka Uji tea from Stereoscope Coffee. Just matcha and water. Unsweetened. You’ll get the matcha flavor with less bitter notes per the chart on their menu. 

Comparing to other places I’ve reviewed. I did not taste umami flavor. It does have the characteristics of being closer to a tea drink than a concentrated matcha drink like I can get at Yamari.

With this review. I close my search to find a place serving matcha with the strongest profile for umami. This began with a search for matcha shops around Los Angeles and Orange County. I have a hunch majority of matcha places are using high grade culinary matcha under “ceremonial” labeling. And most places use sugar to make their drinks taste good because lower grade matcha has bitter notes. Given the current Matcha shortage and prices reaching $2.16/gram as the highest I’ve seen. I do not see majority of shops charging higher prices for unsweetened tea and water drink when most sell at ~$5. I was planning to go to ROK coffee and tea, but reasoned the matcha latte will be similar to other places serving a sweetened matcha latte.

Chapter 1 

Josie, you know you screwed up, right?” Vincent Oldham’s voice yanked Josie Pearson out of her fog 

Her eyes zeroed in on his face, sharp and familiar. 

“Wait, didn’t I die?” she thought. 

Two years after her mentor sold her out and landed her in prison, she’d hit rock bottom, crashing her head into a wall to es depression. 

So why a

escape the 

Imagining my crew’s here to spring me from jail?” 

“Look, we get it–you’re gunning to join Professor David Lawson’s research team. But that’s no excuse for throwing Natalie under the bus,” Vincent said, his tone sharp. 

“You realize what you’ve done? You accused Natalie of jacking your paper, and now she’s so messed up she hasn’t shown her face at school in days. 

“Keep this up, Josic, and you’re gonna push her off the deep end. When did you turn so cold–blooded?” 

Vincent was getting pissed, slamming his coffee mug on the table when she didn’t respond. 

The sharp clunk snapped her out of it. 

This wasn’t a dream. She was really here, face–to–face with Vincent–ten years younger Vincent. Holy crap. She’d somehow jumped back 

decade. 

Right now, she was still a senior at Aloville Medical School, fresh off nailing the written exam for Professor David Lawson’s elite research 

Tram. 

She’d crushed it, landing a spot in the final round. 

But then came the sucker punch Natalie Kinberg’s thesis was a near clone of hers–same angle, same methods, same vibe. No way that was a coincidence. 

While Josie was digging for answers, rumors about Natalie plagiarizing spread like wildfire, 

David’s project was a big deal–first of its kind in the country, with a team of rockstar researchers, including five of Josie’s seniors. 

Those five had been her crew since sophomore year, always having her back in class and life. They were family. 

Then Natalie showed up, and it all flipped. The support, the late–night study sessions, the laughs–they all went to her. 

Even David, who used to praise Josie’s grind, started treating Natalie like the star pupil. 

When the plagiarism rumors hit, her seniors swore Josie was the one stirring the pot. Even David tore into her, face red with anger. 

Josie wasn’t Natalie’s biggest fan, no lie. She’d been competitive, always trying to outshine her, desperate to reclaim the spotlight. 

But she never spread those rumors or accused Natalie of stealing 

“You really blew it,” Vincent said, his voice softening a bit. “Professor Lawson’s giving you a shot, though. Apologize to Natalie in front of the whole school, and he’ll let it go. 

“He’ll even keep the administration from nailing you with a punishment.” 

“But if you keep doubling down and dragging her name through the mud, you’re done. Expulsion’s on the table! 

\*Fine. I’ll apologize, Josie said, her voice flat, eyes locked on his. 

Vincent was a year ahead, a small–town kid like her who’d fought his way into this school. 

She’d known him longest–four years. She thought he’d have her back, trust her when she said she didn’t start this drama. 



Nope. He was the first one here, pushing her to eat crow. 

Vincent blinked, caught off guard by her quick surrender. Josie didn’t cave this easy, not the Josie he knew. Still, an apology was a win, so he didn’t push. 

“Alright, it’s a deal,” he said. “TII tell Professor Lawson. Write that apology letter tonight. You’re reading it to the whole school tomorrow.” 

Josie’s lips curled into a sharp, bitter smirk. 

She wasn’t that gullible girl anymore. She knew the truth: Natalie spread those rumors herself, playing the victim to turn everyone against Josie. 

Depression? Just a sob story to make the seniors fawn over her. 

But that wasn’t the point now. Josie wanted to know how Natalie jacked her thesis without leaving a trace. 

In her old life, she’d refused to apologize. The mess blew up, the school investigated, and they found nothing on Natalie. 

Meanwhile, Josie got hit with a disciplinary record, her seniors called her heartless, and that stain wrecked her job prospects after graduation. 

Not this time. She wasn’t taking the fall. If someone was going down, it sure as hell wouldn’t be her. 

The next morning, Josie steeled herself to eat humble pie and make her public apology 

She threw on her backpack and stepped out of the dorm, chin up despite the knot in her gut. 

As she crossed campus, the whispers and side–eyes trailed her like a bad smell. 

There she is–Professor Lawson’s former golden girl. Got all jealous and trashed the department’s darling for supposedly jacking her paper.” 

“She thought she was all that with her grades, catching the eye of our live campus hotties. Then Natalie rolls in–just as smart, drop- dead gorgeous, and actually nice.” 

Look at 

that sour face. She’s not even in Natalie’s league. Why those guys still have her back is beyond me. 

“Have her back? Please. They’re all Team Natalie now. This whole ‘say sorry in front of everyone thing? Aiden’s call 

“Aiden’s idea, huh? Josie let out a sharp, bitter scoff and picked up her pace to dodge the gossip. 

She’d barely hit the quad when Jaden Monroe, her senior, caught up. 

Jaden was a first–year grad student who’d saved her bacon back in her senior year. She’d been floundering in her toughest classes, and he’d tossed her his killer notes, helping her ace her exams. 

When he was stressing over grad school apps, Josie had pulled all–nighters hunting down research and reference books for him. She’d never owed him or any of the guys a thing. 

Jaden shot her a look, heavy with disappointment. Josie, I always thought you were one of the good ones. 

“Never figured you’d pull something this low just to get ahead. And Natalie? She’s too kind to even hold it against you 

“You didn’t see her after what you did. She’s a mess–skinnier, totally worn out. Those big, bright eyes? No spark left.” 

“And still, she’s got your back. Went to Professor Lawson on the down low, begging him to let you off this public apology crap. But you‘ gotta have a heart, yeah?”

We had a long-distance relationship for 6 months, then I moved in with her and we’ve been living together for 3 months. She’s on a student visa expiring early fall.

Two weeks ago we discovered she’s pregnant (unplanned). Before this discovery, she was the kindest person I’d ever been with and treated me better than anyone in decades. I just came out of a brutal 5-year relationship and told her that while I want to marry her eventually, I’m not ready for a child right now.

I asked for one week to process this together and specifically requested she not tell her parents until we decided whether to keep the baby. She immediately told them anyway, claiming “emotional weakness.” Her father (a prominent politician back home) flew here with the explicit intent of arranging our marriage. He never informed my parents he was coming or what his purpose was. Now since they are staying with us every sensitive conversation is a talk with me vs 3 of them (her parents and her)

The pressure pattern that keeps happening: When I express hesitation about rushing into marriage, she becomes extremely emotional - crying, yelling, saying I’m abandoning her. Her parents (staying in our apartment) then give me ultimatums with tight deadlines like “decide by noon tomorrow.” She won’t let me leave to get space or talk to friends. She stays up all night packing “in case I reject her” and has threatened to “write articles about me and tell the world what kind of man I am and warn other women to never date me as I would get them pregnant and abandon them.”

By morning I’m sleep-deprived and haven’t eaten. She then brings me food and coffee, and this sudden kindness makes me feel like she really cares. In this weakened state, after having panic attacks, I agree to what she wants. Everyone becomes happy but I feel uncertain about my decision.

They exclude my family from any wedding discussions despite my father asking to be included. She discourages me from talking to friends, saying they give me “wrong advice.” Her father presents the choice as mine but she manipulates me whenever I actually say no.

My questions How can I create space to think clearly when I’m not allowed to leave or talk to my support system? What strategies can I use to communicate my need for time without triggering these emotional episodes? How do I maintain my boundaries around not being ready for marriage and children while still being supportive during this difficult time for her?",11,1756189623.0,relationship_advice,67,0.72,False

But she never spread those rumors or accused Natalie of stealing. 

“You really blew it,” Vincent said, his voice softening a bit. “Professor Lawson’s giving you a shot, though. Apologize to Natalie

in front of the whole school, and he’ll let it go. 

“He’ll even keep the administration from nailing you with a punishment.” 

“But if you keep doubling down and dragging her name through the mud, you’re done. Expulsion’s on the table.” 

“Fine. I’ll apologize,” Josie said, her voice flat, eyes locked on his. 

Vincent was a year ahead, a small-town kid like her who’d fought his way into this school.

She’d known him longest-four years. She thought he’d have her back, trust her when she said she didn’t start this drama. 

Nope. He was the first one here, pushing her to eat crow. 

Vincent blinked, caught off guard by her quick surrender. Josie didn’t cave this easy, not the Josie he knew. Still, an apology was a win, so he didn’t push. 

“Alright, it’s a deal,” he said. “I’ll tell Professor Lawson. Write that apology letter tonight. You’re reading it to the whole school 

tomorrow.” 

Josie’s lips curled into a sharp, bitter smirk. 

She wasn’t that gullible girl anymore. She knew the truth: Natalie spread those rumors herself, playing the victim to turn everyone against Josie. 

Depression? Just a sob story to make the seniors fawn over her. 

But that wasn’t the point now. Josie wanted to know how Natalie jacked her thesis without leaving a trace. 

In her old life, she’d refused to apologize. The mess blew up, the school investigated, and they found nothing on Natalie. 

Meanwhile, Josie got hit with a disciplinary record, her seniors called her heartless, and that stain wrecked her job prospects after graduation. 

Not this time. She wasn’t taking the fall. If someone was going down, it sure as hell wouldn’t be her. 

The next morning, Josie steeled herself to eat humble pie and make her public apology. ",1,1756189542.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False
1n0edqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/mysteryland/comments/1n0edqw/review_of_this_edition/,Review of this edition,"First of all, I want to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the music, the atmosphere and our group. The trance, garage, hardcore and techno stages were particularly great. But it was by far the worst edition of the past four years that I have attended. It is very clear that some people have left the management team. As far as I am concerned, Mysteryland should have gone back to the drawing board a year ago.

**Festival**

* The layout of the festival made no sense. The paths on the north side were impassable on Saturday. Why use the lower part for the ‘resort’? Just because there is more profit to be made? It also didn't make sense that you couldn't walk around on the north side.
* The main stage in that location caused enormous congestion and dangerous situations. The main stage design was also wrong and did not create any atmosphere. The final show with drones was not even visible from the dance floor, and where were the lights? This is not how you want to end your festival.
* Price of beverages and food were too high. Four euros for a small cup of that disgusting BUD is a big joke.

**Camping**

* Camping was terrible this year compared to previous years. There were no food stalls where you could pay with tokens on Monday, so we ended up with a lot of tokens left over. Only one coffee stall for 10,000 people?
* No decent afterparty at the campsite on Sunday. Last year, the afterparty with TNT was great. Now it's a silent disco with a huge queue.
* The toilet facilities were extremely dirty this year.
* How can the price of the friedsfield be justified? €1,350 for a piece of rope?

**Tips for 2027:**

* Less focus on VIP and resort. Although the shareholders will not agree with this.
* Just make a decent hardstyle stage on the pyramid again, including a final show (with or without Q-Dance). This will result in a much better distribution of visitors.
* Return the main stage to its old location.
* Bring back Thunderdome and a real techno stage.
* Open up the south side of the festival again, as this is the most enjoyable part of the site.
* Reintroduce a night programme at the campsite with a decent stage.
* You don't need a lot of money to create atmosphere on a stage; the new overbruggen/shelter stage had a great atmosphere with just a few lights.
* The area near the old main building was also wonderful to explore, with its fountains, traffic circle and bell machine. More of that!

1n0ebtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelanceWriters/comments/1n0ebtj/no_work_allocation_from_client_that_usually/,No work allocation from client that usually assigns on monthly basis.,"Working with them for 4 years. Usually I get a heads up if things go on pause. In fact, they went on pause around this time last year for review of performance to adjust the content plan, strategy and keywords. But last time I had some notice, this month, I've just been ignored when I asked if there is anything coming through. 

Its now a week before things would be usually due and I'm not overly happy or have the capacity now to book it in around other client work. They know I'm away next week which is why I first assumed the allocation was late, and other freelancers had also had late work allocations this month. However I'm now the only writer who hasn't had anything through. And I'm wondering if you were in this position, would you chase it again or just write it off for the month? I'm not contracted on paper to do work for them each month, but it's been this schedule for the past 4 years, and it feels slightly odd. They are going through a change of hands ATM, and I can see the clients of mine are still outstanding their performance review. 

How would you approach this? And if the work allocation did come through, how much notice realistically would you expect given how late the allocation is? (Usually 2/3 weeks prior to due date). ..thanks!
