For readers who appreciate the intimate dialogue of B.K. Borison’s *First-Time Caller* and the emotional depth and charm of Abby Jimenez’s *Part of Your World*, *PIECES OF US*, complete at 86,000 words, is a contemporary romance built on chemistry, conversation, and the courage to rebuild.   

Olive’s life is splintering, much like the reclaimed wood she saws, sands, and glues together after long days at a job that hasn’t inspired her in years. On her lathe, she can shape something beautiful from what’s broken. Off of it, she’s not so sure.

Her long-term boyfriend left her for a showmance and a lease that doesn’t include her. Her aura-cleansing boss has just dropped a chaotic garden party into her lap. And she’s barely hanging on as an assistant at a Los Angeles production company where everyone else seems effortlessly wealthy, weird, or both.

When she’s told to send an invite to a guy named Ezra Avelo, she expects it to be another forgettable task. Instead, their inbox thread becomes the highlight of her day. Ezra, a skateboard-riding, van-dwelling free spirit, turns out to be all offbeat charm, and their emails shift from logistics to late-night confessions, existential musings, and a back-and-forth that builds its own undeniable charge. When they finally meet, the connection is instant, electric, and suddenly complicated.

Reality hits hard: Olive can’t afford to stay in L.A., and moving back in with her parents is starting to look inevitable. In a last-ditch attempt to hold on to what they’ve found, she suggests a casual fling; Ezra, graceful and steady, draws a line: friendship only. A boundary that’s tested with every glance and every shared moment as her departure looms closer.

Then a new path appears: a commission for her woodworking, an unexpected job offer, and a deepening bond with Ezra, who entrusts her with a part of his past few others know.

They’ve both lost pieces of themselves along the way. Now, Olive has to decide, can she risk building something new when there’s no guarantee she’ll stay long enough to keep it?

1l78t80,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1l78t80/how_it_started_pt4/,How it started pt4,"The night was thick with silence, the kind that clings to the skin, broken only by the faint creak of the house. Mara woke with a jolt, her body thrumming with an urgent, primal need—a fierce craving to be fucked, a heat that surged through her core, pooling hot and insistent between her thighs. The sensation was raw, almost overwhelming, a stark contrast to the months of numbness she’d carried. She lay still for a moment, her breath shallow, the ache growing sharper, demanding release. Beside her, Elliot slept, his soft snores a steady rhythm, oblivious to the fire igniting within her.
Her hand moved instinctively, slipping beneath the waistband of her pajama bottoms. She tugged them down to her knees, the cool air kissing her skin, and slid her fingers under the soft cotton of her panties—pale blue, worn thin from years of use, the fabric hugging her hips. Her touch was hesitant at first, grazing the sensitive skin of her inner thighs, then bolder, finding the slick warmth of her folds. She parted herself, fingers gliding over her clit, swollen and pulsing under her touch. A soft moan escaped her lips as she pressed harder, circling with a steady rhythm, her hips rocking slightly to meet the motion. The cotton stretched taut over her knuckles, shifting with each stroke, a faint rustle in the dark. She dipped two fingers inside herself, curling them against the spot that made her gasp, the wet sounds of her arousal mingling with her quickening breaths. Her moans grew louder, unrestrained, spilling into the quiet room as she chased the edge of release, her body trembling with need.

Elliot stirred, the sounds pulling him from sleep. His eyes adjusted to the pitch blackness, catching the faint movement under the covers—the rhythmic rise and fall of Mara’s hand, the cotton of her panties shifting up and down, a ghostly outline in the dim moonlight filtering through the curtains. His heart pounded, a mix of awe and guilt flooding him. He didn’t move, didn’t speak, frozen by the intimacy of the moment, her moans a siren call that both drew him in and shamed him for witnessing. Her sounds grew louder, raw and unfiltered, each one a stab of longing in his chest, the cage beneath his own panties—lavender lace, chosen that morning—feeling tighter, a futile pressure against his growing arousal.

Mara’s eyes fluttered open, her body teetering on the brink, and she caught the glint of Elliot’s gaze in the dark. Her pleasure shattered into rage. “Elliot!” she screamed, her voice a jagged blade slicing through the room. She yanked her hand from her panties, pulling the covers up to shield herself, her face twisted with fury. “What the fuck are you doing? Watching me?” Her voice cracked, raw with violation, her body trembling as she sat up. Elliot stammered, his face pale, “Mara, I—I didn’t mean to—” but she cut him off, her screams rising, sharp and unrelenting. “Get out! Now!” She lunged forward, shoving him toward the edge of the bed, her strength fueled by betrayal. Elliot stumbled to his feet, his heart racing, and backed toward the door, hands raised in surrender. “I’m sorry, I didn’t—” he tried, but Mara’s voice drowned him out. “Out!” she roared, slamming the door behind him, the lock clicking with a finality that echoed through the house.

Elliot stood in the hallway, his breath uneven, the weight of her anger crushing him. The cage and panties clung to him, a brand of his failure, the image of her hand moving beneath the cotton seared into his mind, now tangled with the sting of her rage. He sank to the floor, his back against the wall, guilt gnawing at him. He hadn’t meant to cross her boundary, hadn’t meant to violate her, but he had, and the shame was a heavy knot in his chest.

Morning came, gray and oppressive, the house silent. Mara didn’t emerge from the bedroom. The door remained locked, a fortress of her anger. Outside it, Elliot found a single item—a pair of panties, soft white cotton with a delicate scalloped edge, neatly folded on the floor. No note, no words, just the expectation that he would wear them, a continuation of her rules in the wake of her fury. His hands trembled as he picked them up, retreating to the bathroom to change. The fabric was snug, foreign against his skin, the cage a constant reminder of his place. He waited in the living room, eyes fixed on the locked door, hoping for a sign, but the hours dragged on, and Mara stayed hidden.
When she finally emerged in the late afternoon, her face was a mask of resolve, her eyes a storm of hurt and determination. She wore a loose sweater and jeans, her body fully covered, a shield rebuilt. She sat across from Elliot at the kitchen table, hands clasped tightly, her voice low but unyielding. “You violated me last night,” she said, each word deliberate, heavy with the weight of her betrayal. “I was in my own space, my own body, and you watched without my consent. I feel… exposed, broken. I can’t trust you in my room right now.” Her gaze pierced him, unflinching. “You’re not allowed in the bedroom anymore. Not to sleep, not to change, nothing. You’ll sleep on the couch, keep your clothes in the hall closet. If I need privacy, you leave the house—no hovering, no listening. My body is mine, Elliot, and you keep proving you don’t understand that.”

Elliot’s throat tightened, his eyes stinging. “Mara, I’m so sorry,” he said, voice breaking. “I didn’t mean to hurt you. I just… I got caught up. I’ll do better, I swear.” She shook her head, her expression softening but not relenting. “You’ve said that before. I need more than words now. You wear the panties, the cage, every day, no exceptions. I check when I want, and you don’t argue. If I catch you pushing my boundaries again—looking, lingering, anything—you’re out of the house for good. Do you understand?” Her voice was steel, her authority absolute, but a tremor beneath it betrayed the pain she carried.

Elliot nodded, head bowed. “I understand,” he whispered, the weight of her words sinking into him. Mara leaned back, studying him, then softened slightly. “I still care about you,” she said quietly. “But this is about me protecting myself. You need to earn my trust back, and it’s going to take time.” She stood, leaving the room without another word, the distance between them a chasm.

That night, Elliot lay on the couch, the scratchy fabric a poor substitute for their bed. The house was quiet, but as the hours deepened, faint sounds drifted from the bedroom. At first, he thought it was the wind, but then he heard it—soft, deliberate moans, the same raw cadence he’d heard the night before. Mara was pleasuring herself again, her breaths quickening, the faint rustle of fabric and slick sounds carrying through the thin walls. Each moan was a dagger, a reminder of her desire—alive, vibrant, but not for him. The cage tightened around him, his body responding uselessly, the panties a soft cage of their own. He didn’t move, didn’t dare approach the door, but the sounds painted a vivid picture in the dark—her fingers moving, her body arching, her pleasure a private act he could only hear, never touch. The moans grew louder, peaking in a soft cry that cut through him, then faded into silence. Elliot lay still, his heart heavy, the weight of her rules, her distance, and her reclaimed desire pressing down on him. He knew she was guarding her body fiercely, and though he longed to bridge the gap, the sounds of her pleasure were a stark reminder: her desire was hers alone, and he was on the outside, listening, bound by her rules and his own mistakes.

The days following Mara’s ultimatum were a tightrope walk for Elliot. He clung to her rules, the white cotton panties with their scalloped edge a constant presence against his skin, the cage a relentless reminder of his place. He slept on the couch, his clothes relegated to the hall closet, and moved through the house with a quiet deference, careful not to linger near the bedroom door. Mara’s presence was a mix of warmth and steel—she’d smile when he made her coffee, her fingers brushing his in thanks, but her eyes held a vigilance that kept him in check. The faint sounds of her pleasure drifted from the bedroom some nights, each moan a sharp reminder of her reclaimed autonomy, a world he was no longer part of. Yet, despite the distance, Elliot sensed a softening in her. She’d linger longer during their evening talks, her laughter lighter, her gaze less guarded. He held onto the hope that he was earning her trust back, that the bedroom door might one day reopen.

Two weeks after their confrontation, Mara seemed different. Over dinner, her eyes met his with a warmth he hadn’t seen in months, a flicker of the old connection. She leaned forward, her voice soft, almost tentative. “Elliot, I’ve been thinking,” she said, setting down her fork. “You’ve been trying, I can see that. I was… I was going to say maybe you could come back to the bedroom soon. Not for everything, but to sleep, to be close.” Her words hit him like a lifeline, his heart leaping, but before he could respond, her gaze sharpened, scanning him. “But first, show me. Lift your shirt, pull down your pants. I need to see the cage.” Her tone was firm, the warmth undercut by her unyielding need for control.

Elliot froze, his stomach plummeting. The cage wasn’t there. That morning, in a moment of weakness, he’d taken it off. The panties were still on—soft white cotton, as she’d demanded—but the cage lay forgotten in the bathroom drawer. He’d been overwhelmed, the weight of her rules, her distance, and the sounds of her pleasure pushing him to a breaking point. Alone in the bathroom, he’d removed it, his hand lingering, a quick, desperate release to ease the ache. It was a fleeting act, one he’d convinced himself was harmless, but now, under her gaze, guilt flooded him.

“Mara, I—” he started, his voice shaky, but her eyes narrowed, cutting him off. “Show me,” she repeated, her voice low, a storm brewing. Elliot stood, his hands trembling as he lifted his shirt and tugged down his pants, revealing the panties and the unmistakable absence of the cage. Mara’s face went still, then twisted with fury, her chair scraping as she stood. “You took it off?” she hissed, her voice rising, sharp and raw. “After everything? After I was ready to let you back in?” Her eyes blazed, her hands clenched into fists, the betrayal cutting deeper than any before. “I was going to trust you again, Elliot, and you do this?”
Elliot’s knees buckled, and he sank back into his chair, his face burning. “I’m sorry, Mara, I didn’t mean—it was just for a moment, I swear—” But her scream cut through his words, a sound of pure rage. “Don’t lie to me!” she shouted, slamming her hand on the table, the dishes rattling. “You didn’t just forget. Did you touch yourself? Were you masturbating when you took it off?” Her voice was a blade, her eyes boring into him, demanding truth.
Elliot shook his head, panic rising. “No, I didn’t, I just needed a break, it was uncomfortable—” But Mara stepped closer, her presence towering, her voice dropping to a dangerous calm. “Don’t. Lie. Tell me the truth, Elliot. Did you touch yourself?” Her words were relentless, each one a hammer against his resolve. He shrank under her gaze, his denial crumbling. “I… yes,” he whispered, his voice barely audible, his eyes fixed on the floor. “It was quick, I didn’t mean to betray you, I just… I couldn’t stop myself.”

Mara’s face contorted with disgust, her lips curling as if the air itself had turned sour. “You’re disgusting,” she spat, stepping back, her arms crossing tightly over her chest. “I’ve given you every chance, Elliot. I’ve laid out my boundaries, my rules, and you still can’t respect them. You’re so weak you couldn’t even keep your hands off yourself.” Her voice trembled with a mix of anger and revulsion, her eyes glinting with tears she refused to let fall. “From now on, you don’t wear anything but the panties and the cage in this house. No shirts, no pants, nothing. I need to see at all times that you’re following my rules. If you can’t control yourself, I’ll make sure you do.”

Elliot nodded, his throat tight, shame washing over him. “I understand,” he said softly, his voice breaking. Mara turned away, her shoulders rigid, and disappeared into the bedroom, the door slamming behind her. The lock clicked, a sound that echoed like a gavel. That night, Elliot slept on the couch in just the white cotton panties, the cage back in place, its metal cold against his skin. The house was silent, but the weight of her disgust lingered, a heavy fog he couldn’t escape.

For two weeks, they lived under the new rules. Elliot moved through the house in nothing but panties and the cage, the fabric shifting against his skin, the metal a constant weight. Mara’s checks were frequent, her fingers tugging at the waistband to ensure compliance, her eyes cold but satisfied when she saw the cage in place. She was kind in fleeting moments—passing him a mug of tea, her hand grazing his—but her warmth was tempered by a distance that felt permanent. Elliot clung to her small gestures, desperate to rebuild what he’d broken, but the chasm between them grew.
Then, one morning, it happened. Mara, rushing to get ready for work, left the bathroom door slightly ajar, the frosted glass blurring her form as she showered. Elliot was in the hallway, carrying a basket of laundry, when she stepped out, assuming he was still downstairs. She didn’t see him at first, her body bare, water glistening on her skin, her curves soft and unguarded. For a split second, Elliot froze, his eyes locked on her, the sight of her nakedness a jolt to his system—a beauty he hadn’t seen in over a year, raw and forbidden. He looked away instantly, his heart pounding, but it was too late. Mara’s head snapped toward him, her eyes catching his guilty flinch, and her fury erupted like a storm breaking.

“Elliot!” she screamed, her voice a raw, primal roar that shook the walls. She grabbed a towel, wrapping it tightly around herself, her face a mask of rage and betrayal. “You fucking looked at me!” She stormed toward him, her hands shaking, her eyes blazing with a fire that made him shrink back. The laundry basket fell, clothes spilling across the floor. “I told you my body is mine! You don’t get to see it, ever, unless I say so!” Her voice cracked, tears brimming but unshed, her anger a tidal wave. “I was clear, Elliot! Crystal fucking clear, and you still can’t stop yourself!”

Elliot stammered, backing against the wall, his hands raised. “Mara, it was an accident, I didn’t mean—I looked away, I swear—” But her scream drowned him out, a sound of pure, unfiltered rage. “Don’t you dare lie to me again!” she shouted, stepping closer, her finger jabbing at his chest. “You looked, you stared, and I saw it in your eyes—you wanted to. After everything, you still think you’re entitled to my body!” Her voice broke, a sob caught in her throat, but her fury held firm. She paused, her chest heaving, then her eyes narrowed, a decision forming in the storm of her anger. “You’re not leaving,” she said, her voice dropping to a chilling calm. “But you’re going to learn, Elliot. You’re going to feel what it means to cross me.”

She stepped back, her towel clutched tightly, and pointed to the living room. “Go. Bend over the arm of the couch. Now.” Her tone was unyielding, a command that brooked no argument. Elliot’s eyes widened, his heart pounding, but he obeyed, his legs trembling as he moved to the living room. He bent over the couch, the white cotton panties snug against his skin, the cage a cold weight beneath. Mara followed, her footsteps deliberate, her silence heavy with purpose. She stood behind him, her presence a looming force, and when she spoke, her voice was steady, laced with a quiet fury. “You’ve broken my trust again,” she said. “So you’re getting spanked. Hard. Until I’m satisfied you understand my boundaries.”
Elliot’s breath hitched, his face burning with shame and fear. “Mara, I’m sorry—” he started, but her hand cracked against his backside, the sound sharp in the quiet room. The sting was immediate, searing through the thin cotton, and he gasped, his body tensing. “No talking,” she snapped, her hand landing again, harder this time, the pain radiating outward. She didn’t hold back, each strike deliberate, her rhythm steady, the slaps echoing as her palm met the fabric of the panties. Elliot gripped the couch, his knuckles white, the cage shifting with each blow, a reminder of his submission. Mara’s voice broke through, firm and unrelenting. “This is for looking. For thinking you could take what’s mine.” Another strike, then another, the pain building, his skin hot beneath the cotton. She paused, her hand resting on his back, her breath heavy but controlled. “Do you understand now, Elliot? My body is not yours to see.”
“Yes,” he whispered, his voice choked, tears stinging his eyes. “I understand. I’m sorry, Mara.” She landed one final blow, the hardest yet, and then stepped back, her chest rising and falling. “Get up,” she said, her tone softer but still firm. Elliot stood, his legs shaky, his face flushed with a mix of pain and shame. Mara studied him, her eyes searching his, then nodded slightly. “You stay in the panties and cage, every day, no exceptions. You sleep on the couch. You don’t come near the bedroom unless I say so. And if you ever look at me again without permission, this will feel like nothing. Do you hear me?”
Elliot nodded, his throat tight. “I hear you,” he said, his voice barely audible. Mara turned, her towel still clutched tightly, and walked to the bedroom, the door closing with a soft click. Elliot sank onto the couch, the sting of the spanking lingering, the weight of her rules heavier than ever. He knew he’d crossed a line, and though he was still in the house, the distance between them felt like a chasm. Mara’s control was absolute, her boundaries a fortress, and he was left to navigate the fragile hope that his submission might one day rebuild her trust.

The weeks following the spanking were a delicate dance of compliance and distance. Elliot adhered to Mara’s rules with a quiet diligence, wearing only the panties and cage inside the house, the white cotton with its scalloped edge a constant reminder of his place. He slept on the couch, his clothes still banished to the hall closet, and moved through their shared spaces with a careful respect, his eyes averted from any hint of her privacy. Mara’s demeanor remained a blend of firmness and fleeting warmth—her voice sharp when she checked his compliance, tugging at the waistband to confirm the cage, but softening when he performed small acts of care, like brewing her morning coffee or folding her laundry. Yet the chasm between them lingered, her body a fortress, her desire a distant echo he could only hear through the bedroom walls.
One evening, as they sat at the kitchen table, a package arrived. Mara retrieved it from the doorstep, her expression unreadable as she sliced open the box. Elliot watched, curious but cautious, as she pulled out a sleek silicone dildo, its size modest but unmistakable—six inches, smooth, and a deep indigo color. She held it up, her eyes meeting his with a glint of amusement, a smirk tugging at her lips. “Look at this, Elliot,” she said, her voice teasing, almost playful. “It’s already bigger than you.” She turned the toy in her hand, inspecting it, then glanced at the cage beneath his panties, her smirk widening. “Your little thing could never compare, could it?” Her tone was light, but the words stung, a sharp jab at his pride that made his face flush. He looked down, his hands fidgeting, and mumbled, “I guess not.” Mara laughed, a sound both cruel and carefree, and set the dildo on the counter, a silent promise of its use.

That night, as Elliot lay on the couch, the sounds began. Mara’s moans drifted through the bedroom door, louder than before, punctuated by the faint hum of the toy. Her cries were raw, unrestrained, each one a testament to the pleasure she found in the silicone, a pleasure that excluded him. “Oh, fuck,” she gasped, the words carrying through the walls, followed by a scream that made his chest tighten. The cage felt heavier, his body straining uselessly against it, the lavender lace panties he wore that day a soft cage of their own. He lay still, his heart pounding, the sounds painting a vivid picture of her ecstasy—a world he could only listen to, never touch.
Over the next few weeks, more packages arrived. Each dildo was larger than the last—seven inches, then eight, then a thick nine-inch model in jet black, its girth intimidating even to look at. Mara made a ritual of showing them to Elliot, her tone laced with mockery as she held them up, comparing their size to his caged penis. “This one’s a real cock,” she’d say, waving an eight-inch toy, her eyes dancing with amusement. “Not like your pathetic little thing, huh?” She’d laugh, her voice sharp but not entirely unkind, and Elliot would flush, his shame mingling with a strange, quiet acceptance. He didn’t argue, didn’t protest, just nodded and looked away, the cage a constant reminder of his place. Mara’s teasing was relentless, but it came with a shift—her demeanor softened outside these moments. She’d compliment his panties daily, her voice warm as she said, “Those look nice on you, Elliot,” her hand brushing his arm as she passed. When he cooked dinner, she’d smile, her praise genuine, and her touches lingered—a hand on his shoulder, a finger tracing the edge of his waistband, checking the cage with a nod of approval.

The more Mara used her toys, the kinder she became. Her screams of pleasure filled the house most nights, the sounds growing louder, more intense, as she explored the larger dildos. Each cry was a dagger to Elliot, a reminder of her reclaimed desire, but it also seemed to ease her anger. She was gentler in their conversations, her laughter lighter, her eyes holding a warmth he hadn’t seen in months. She’d sit closer during movie nights, her thigh brushing his, and thank him for small gestures with a sincerity that felt like a lifeline. The contrast was stark—her nights consumed by the silicone cocks, her days marked by a growing affection toward him, as if her pleasure freed her to be kind.

After three weeks, Mara’s demeanor shifted further. One evening, after a particularly loud session with her newest toy—a ten-inch behemoth she’d shown him with a wicked grin, saying, “This makes your little cock look like a toy itself”—she emerged from the bedroom, her face flushed, her body relaxed. She wore a loose t-shirt and soft cotton panties, her hair mussed, a quiet glow about her. She sat on the couch beside Elliot, her hand resting on his knee, a rare gesture of closeness. “You’ve been good lately,” she said, her voice soft, almost tender. “I see you trying, respecting my rules. I think… I think you can sleep in the bed again. But only after I’m done with my toys, when I’m ready to sleep. You don’t touch me, you don’t look, you just sleep. Understood?”
Elliot’s heart leaped, a mix of relief and longing flooding him. “Understood,” he said, his voice thick with gratitude. “Thank you, Mara.” She nodded, her eyes searching his, then stood, beckoning him to follow. That night, he waited in the living room, the sounds of her pleasure echoing through the house—gasps, moans, a final scream that shook him to his core. When silence fell, she called softly, “Elliot, come in.” He entered the bedroom, the air warm with the scent of her, and slid into bed beside her. She was already under the covers, her body turned away, her breathing steady. He lay still, the white cotton panties and cage a quiet presence, the distance between them palpable but softened by the privilege of being near her again. As he closed his eyes, her voice came, soft but firm. “You’re doing good, Elliot. Keep it up.” The words were a small bridge, a fragile hope that their love might find a new shape, even as her pleasure belonged to the toys, and he remained bound by her rules.

It has cost her health, she almost lost her home and most of her relationships.  I live with her and care for her. She constantly obsesses about ""treats"" and will not leave the house unless she can get ice cream on the way home. 

What's worse is that she has developed serious food sensitivities in the past few years. Sugar is one of them.   She gets horrible bouts of gout and inflammation in her knees and can't walk.  This means that I have to take total care of her.  

Whenever I prepare to eat something I really enjoy, she starts haggling with me, ""are you going to share that with me?"",  ""I can't believe you are going to eat that and not give me any"". She even asks to taste my coffee. The other day I was in the kitchen cooking and I was tasting dinner, and she said ""What's in your mouth!? Why are you chewing like that? Is that a candy bar?""

Over the weekend, I bought peaches and was going to make a peach cake and bring it to my church. She ate all the peaches, butter and vanilla. (I hid the sugar) I lost it. I just cannot deal anymore. 

I love my mother; she is my best friend but her behavior has got to stop and I know it's not going to. I'm not baking anymore or bringing any food in the home I enjoy so I don't have to listen to her beg and haggle with me for ""just a little bite, please"".  I get no pleasure out of eating and have started losing weight. I don't want to be around her because I resent her behavior and what it has done not only to her but those around her. 

Can someone please help me? What do I do? What do I say? I want to salvage this relationship but her behavior is so overwhelming and toxic. ",2,1749485232.0,FoodAddiction,0,1.0,False

I’m flying into meeting the 15th through 27th of June. My daughter is three years old and my wife and I are gonna rent a car, planning to go to Soto or Cora wax Valley, the thermal bass and San Cristobal.

I keep debating whether I should buy some flights to go to cut the hen or not. We’re from San Diego and have never felt heat or humidity like that. And getting on flights to and from seems like a bit of a hassle.

Background:
Been doing project work for a few years now. Lately, it’s been mostly agile-based stuff — software dev and change initiatives.

Review Process:
I teach project management at an IT school here in the Philippines, so that kind of forced me to stay sharp. I basically got a built-in review over two terms — definitely helped reinforce the concepts. 

But the most helpful part was Study Hall. I took all the mini exams and full-length ones, averaged around 73%. I ran through questions consistently for a week up to Saturday night. Sunday, I just reviewed all the stuff I got wrong — no more heavy studying after that.

Exam Day:
Didn’t study at all today. I focused on taking care of myself — got enough sleep, planned what to eat and which coffee to drink, arrived early at the testing site, listened to good music to stay chill. You have to prepare your body as well!

During the Exam:
I ended the exam with 60+ minutes left. I really think that SH helped me a lot more than my teaching gig. 
My biggest advice: take the breaks. I used mine and sometimes i let time pass by when i was feeling drained, even if it meant doing nothing for a few minutes. Helped me reset and focus again.

Good luck to everyone else. If you're doing the work consistently and not just memorizing stuff, you’ll be fine. The key is understanding how PMI thinks and being in the right mindset during the exam. I probably would have failed if I answered the exam the way I would handle projects in real life 🤣",1,1749485040.0,pmp,1,1.0,False

1l78nn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1l78nn3/unprofessional_work_environment/,Unprofessional work environment,"Had to clock out and go home early. Because the kitchen staff at my job are highly unstable, gaslighting, unprofessional weirdos. Manager comes in cursing and talking shit about everyone and everything. She has a majorr attitude problem, and she brings down the mood when SHE is pissed off. She always refers to other women as ""bitches"". She definitely disllikes other women. She sabotages my job constantly because I often got compliments from our so-called ""director"" for my speed and how good I've been. She just personally refuses to communicate to me most the time, especially when she takes from my tasks, stuff I am preparing for the residents.

The cook is extremely bossy, impatient, gets short with people and then pretends like you are the problem. No matter how hard you work? She finds fault in what you do. She claims she does most of everyone else work, when she is in the back most the time. She stays late to do lunch when there are others who are supposed to come in and do it. I think she does it just to take credit and say that no one else does their job. When you truly need her help? She doesn't bother. When you know what you're doing? She tries to do your job for you, ahead of you and micromanages. She is two-faced and cowardly. She can't come to you like an adult but trash talks whatever issues she has with you when you aren't in the kitchen. 

Before I was hired. They kept the job description very vague and hid the details. I was told it was kitchen work. And that I would be in the ""back"" I was never told I would be a waitress.  When I was hired I was then told I would be waiting people at tables. I was nervous but I gave it a shot. Wasn't too bad but the job is demanding and exhausting. Especially morning.

I try my best. I'm on the spectrum so being a ""waitress"" is not easy. If I had know before I was hired I would be a waitress? I would have politely declined. But I have to pay rent and they held back on the details until I accepted. I mind my business and don't really talk to others at work, unless absolutely necessary. I mind my business and just try to do my job. Honestly that's all I do. I don't like drama at all. 

I brought up to my ""director"" I have autism and that sometimes I get sensory overloads. I may need a minute to walk away if anything gets too much. He said its fine. I wanted to give him paperwork but he said it was unnecessary. I come in many mornings, and tables aren't clean, things aren't filled up for the residents. I sometimes shut down and get non-communicative if I'mtoo overwhelmed. I have to walk away due to sensory overloads and anxiety skyrocketing. I'm not perfect and I mess up. I am willing to admit I have faults. These people, however, cannot and WILL not take any responsibility for their flaws. As many toxic managers/coworkers will not.

Today was the last straw for me. There is a resident who is very creepy, he cocks his legs open, leers at you constantly, stares at staff's butts looking down at his crotch while doing so. I get he is older. I get it. But its still uncomfortable. He pours pepper in the other residents water, steals all the milks for the others, he makes me uncomfortable. I try to serve him but he makes me uneasy. So I avoid him when possible, especially when he has been served. He was giving me a hard time when I started. So I'm anxious around him. I spoke up but of course I was told ""nothing can be done"" and he ""isn't going anyhwere"". The other staff know this and would once in a blue moon offer to help serve him. But now, they treat me like I don't do anything. Even though I'm helping all morning and hardly stop to take breaks. I stay late to help with drinks for lunch. Even when I step away due to sensory overloads, I still don't do it for too long as this is a busy fast paced job.

I needed a break after I served him, so I walked outside for a about a minute and a half. Then I came back in and sat down at the table. I was on break for a few minutes.  I was sitting down for maybe 2 minutes. My anxiety was high and I needed to calm down. The cook knows I only step away when I need a minute. She does so many times without telling me. So she sees I'm on break and asks me to grab a peanut butter cup. I didn't respond right away because I was extremely fried and burned out. As I said I am on the spectrum and sometimes I can't physically say anything. I was about to get up and get it, but before I could she retorted with ""Alright then DONT then!"" She grabbed it and said ""fucking bullshit"" and had an attitude. I just looked at her and didn't even say anything. 

So the manager comes in and I already had a feeling they were going to start something. I walked out the kitchen. I was walking by one of the residents that normally talks to me. I told her I had to get out the kitchen. I also said word for word ""I'm tired of attitudes."" She told me some stories about others who she has seen deal with their own problems at work, and that there is no perfect job. I told her I was snapped at over something small. She told me to let it roll off my back. I talk to her because she helps calm me down. I don't have anyone to help me or in my corner in my department. I should have just asked to leave early. I admit I should have just left or kept it to myself. I wasn't in my right mind at the time. But that's honestly how our conversation went. Nothing more, no cursing or yelling, just listening to the resident speak about things and her trying to give me advice. 

Manager was complaining loud about the fact I peeled off the backwards film off the doors. She was cursing and talking shit. It wasn't even informative she was just finding an excuse to talk about me because she doesn't like any of the young women in her kitchen. Neither her nor the cook do it seems.

The film was a hazard for is running into residents, some and stand infront of the door and I didn't want a risk of hitting them with the door. I should had said something about taking it off. I admit I messed up big there. But they had an excuse to rag on me now. 

So as I was outside with the same resident who normally talks to me. Prior, this resident has brought up the cook's attitude to me. I never had prior mentioned anything about the cook to her. But today, I said I needed to get out the kitchen. I mentioned ""I'm tired of attitudes"". The resident already knew who it was as she sees everything that goes on. She spoke about how I shouldn't let it eat me up and to let it roll off my back. The cook is personally rude to this resident. So the cook saw us talking. She kept looking at me and giving me glares. She started talking to manager about be and looking at me through the doors. Giving me glares and making faces. Conjuring up drama as I expected. They both were looking at me as I was standing listening to the resident. The cook came out to eavesdrop. But the resident was currently speaking about some other woman she was telling me about who works a stressful job.

I came back to start the drinks for lunch. So the manager (who usually sabotaged and takes from my takes to slow my progress down) takes the coffee I prepared for the residents, for HERSELF, without even bothering to communicate. I asked who made the coffee? The manager said ""I did"" and I asked her ""Can you let me know next time, I was planning on making this for lunch?"" And she says ""no I don't have to let you know anything I'm the manager"" and ""I can do what I want I'm the manager you answer to me"" I told her ""I stay to help with the drinks"" and she just was being such a bitch and started shouting at me. She started putting words in my mouth. Saying ""I don't have to tell you anything."" I told her ""I didn't say you HAVE to, I asked if you could let me know."" Then she says ""Yes you did. You told me I have to tell you!! There is a camera here sweetie."" I said ""Run it back then. I didn't say it that way."" And she's like ""We WILL. Believe that."" So I reply ""You're being so manipulative. This is bullying"" and she says ""Go do your fucking job."" I don't even know why I wasted my time with this broad because she kept yelling and refused to deescalate. She has a temper and is very unstable. She slams things all the time when she has to do dishes so I can set up. 

She kept going on and kept it going, saying ""you need to do your fucking job"". Super unprofessional. Then the cook starts cosigning and saying ""its the attitude"" to me. I didn't even have an attitude until they started being extremely unpleasant to me. I said ""You guys get attitudes all the time what are you talking about. You talk about people 24/7 especially when they are not here"" I mentioned the cook getting mad because I didn't grab the peanutbutter right away. I told the manager ""You should stop crap about people when they aren't here""  she started to yell at me again ""Yeah you heard me out there I said it where you could hear me"" then she started to yell more and say ""GET OUT MY FACE AND DO YOUR JOB"" all this because I asked if she could let me know next time when she took the coffee I prepared. I told her  ""No I'm not doing anything else if you keep yelling at me"" so she gets on her phone and calls the ""director"" saying ""Oh She's DONE. She's DONE."" Threatening my job. 

I told the cook she could have just told me if she had an issue instead of snapping and cursing about the peanut butter. She basically says ""you didn't have to ignore me"" and ""I'm doing 80% of the work, I basically take all the residents their food"" No she doesn't. She comes out in the morning and serves the early birds then leaves me to the morning rush by myself half the time. Because one resident I avoid she uses that as an excuse to say she is picking up my slack. I always offer to help her when I know she is behind and she refuses. She says ""You know what I'm just gonna walk away. Talk to the director when he gets here because I'm done."" Literally ALL this over one small cup of peanut butter and asking about coffee.

The director calls me and basically says there was wrong with both sides. Which is true. I should have handled things better. But then I asked him ""They were double teaming me earlier, I don't know what to do and what does the manager mean by, I'm done??"" And he says ""nobody is threatening your job."" And I told him she did. I asked him multiple times again what she meant by it. So he starts gaslighting me and saying ""If you refuse to want to have a normal conversation with me you can walk away and that's your job"" He kept saying it too. I was shaken up and trembling, I was anxious and trying hard to be reasonable. But all he kept doing was blaming everything on me and saying that the manager ""was doing her job"" by talking about me when I took the film off. Fair but did she have to be cursing so much???

They I find out the cook and manager lied and said I was cursing out loud about the cook infront of residents. Which is a damn lie. 

My conversation with the resident whom I was talking to was mostly about me not letting these people get to me. She was saying that no job is perfect and people have issues. She told me you have to let it go and try your best. We weren't sitting there just talking about the cook and trashing her or calling names. But the cook and the manager said they heard me ""word for word"".  

I asked the director what I said, because I dont recall cursing out loud about anything. The director says ""the fact you are asking me what you said tells me you were saying what they told me you said."" 

I was emotional and I said ""Alright so I guess I'm the whole fucking problem."" The f-word was a slip up a dumb one. The only one. I was not cursing anyone out. And the director tells me ""OK I am trying to have a conversation with you. And you are now cursing me out. If you are going to curse me, the director and manager out, you can call me back tomorrow and we can discuss your job.""

I just hung up. I called my fiancé and asked him what to do. He told me to come home and get out of there. I'm no perfect, many things I could have done better on my end. But dear God these people can't keep workers and they wonder why. I'm looking for yet another job. I hope others success in their workplaces. I am not perfect. I messed up. I could have handled some things better. The workplace toxicity and bullying is so ridiculously rampant its ridiculous. ",1,1749485013.0,workplace_bullying,1,1.0,False

1l78nbq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l78nbq,Lilly Cafe - Simple and nice,"Okay so I usually have an aversion to new cafés or just cafés in general in Nashik given they’re all quick cash grabs with food where they can’t even make Maggi right and simply have bad ambience and service. But this cafe opened 2 days ago and we decided to check it out cause 1. It’s on college road and 2. The interiors looked decent and comfortable. 

And honestly, like you can see in the menu the food is very typical cafe like, but the prices are straight up affordable for the comfortable seating and nice service. The food is honestly so suitable for the price like obviously you aren’t expecting gourmet stuff in those prices but not even one dish we had was bad, Maggi - good, spiced and had the spoon of veggies it promised. 2 cadbs - had the sugar, the chocolate AND IT WASNT FILLED WITH ICE LIKE WE LET IT SIT FOR 20 mins and it was still thick af. And the loaded nachos were okayish. 

So yeah all in all 4 items plus a bottle of water plus great ambience and nice quite polite service for 490 rs. 

I’m someone who’s extremely critical of fnb places because they always come out with ridiculous prices and overhyped stupid dishes for unbothered service and 5/10 ambience. But I couldn’t complain here at all.

We talked to the owner and he was so nice and said “I’m planning to make this place a work cafe and want to prove that you can run a nice fnb establishment in very affordable prices “

I personally think this could be very risky for their finances given they’re location, maintenance of the ambience and the fact that if it’s so affordable and comfortable people are gonna sit for a long time for very less per table order value, which could make them lose business and money. Like the person who’s working on their table isn’t gonna see people are waiting outside as long as he has his 100 rs coffee in hand a deliverable to give.

8:00-12:00: drinks at brixton pubs- the Duke of Edinburgh and trinity arms 

Day 6

8:00 am- one last visit to M&S and travel to Heathrow 

Reflections:

* while I’m glad that I wandered a lot, I wish I would have been able to see the British library and so many other sites, taken a daytrip to Kent, etc. I think had I been more intentional about planning I could’ve accomplished this. But, also enjoyed my wandering in new places best of all. Will be back!

* you need to get tickets and reservations for most places, start early! I stood at pubs more than I sat and I’m a fit person but after walking 25k steps it was a bummer to have to stand so much. Did not make any pub or restaurant reservations- that was a mistake on my part!

* it rained 95% of my visit which I expected, but coming from the south east of America where it is firmly 75 degrees at all times during late spring I would’ve brought more pants and sweaters in hindsight 

* the grocery stores have wonderful food if you are looking to save money on meals- m&s was a favorite. 

* be mindful of looking both ways at all crossings, it was hard to keep up with, keep an eye out for bikers too!

* talk to museum employees and volunteers- i changed a few things thanks to their recommendations

* the tube is very easy to use, have your payment ready so that you don't bottleneck things coming in and out, also people are pretty quiet on the tube 

*if you are traveling with kids I've never seen cooler public playgrounds-they are everywhere

*most places take cards and not cash

* don’t waste your time getting generic souvenirs during your trip- Heathrow has an extensive group of shops where you can get all of your typical souvenirs and groceries. I bought my kids gifts at the tower of london gift shop but totally could’ve grabbed all that at the airport.

* there are so many parks and heaths to see- I would’ve spent more time in them if I could have 

* unless you’re at Starbucks a large coffee is like 10-12 ounces and it’s called a “filter coffee.” You’ll have to ask for cream because that’s not a given

* top 5: Tower of London, Kenwood, Uber river cruise, exploring clapham, spittalfields, battersea, and Hampstead by foot.

* make sure your phone plan has an international plan, you can get an e-sim if you have paid your phone off (AT&T still uses a physical sim in their phones), make sure your CC doesn’t have international fees, if you plan to work you’ll need to get a vpn to do so. I work in local govt. in the us and planned to do work one evening and was not able to access the Microsoft office suite for my work- which I took as a divine sign but that might not work for you!


* this group was sooooo helpful! Thank you. You have a magical country ",10,1749484482.0,uktravel,2,0.92,False

I've been working on something I'm pretty excited about and wanted to share it with this community. It's called Lumevoy (lumevoy.com) – basically, it's a product guide website where we dive deep into all sorts of stuff to help you figure out what's actually worth your money.

We're focusing mainly on US and European markets right now, so you'll find reviews and comparisons for things like:

Smart home gadgets: Robot vacuums, smart locks, all that jazz. Kitchen tech: Air fryers, coffee makers – you know, the stuff that makes life easier. Work-from-home essentials: Ergonomic chairs, monitors, proper desk setups. And a bunch more, from personal electronics to outdoor gear. The goal is pretty simple: Cut through the marketing hype and give you honest, actionable advice so you don't end up with buyer's remorse. We've all been there, right?

Take a look if you're ever researching a new purchase. Any feedback on what we've got or what you'd like to see covered next would be awesome.

Last time I identified things that were causing me anxiety and exercised them out of my life.  These were news, social media, coffee, lack of self care habits like gratitude, mindfullness and exercise.

Addressing those habits dramatically helped and I was able to get through the month, but then I decide ""I should be good to have coffee now"", because I'm feeling safe.  Maybe it's just one cup the first day but inevitably I am drinking 5-6 cups a day, which puts me in an anxious headspace and ruins my productivity and motivation.

It's been a tug of war trying to address all these habits at once, because I believe they keep leading me down the path of becoming overwhelmed and eventually turning to alcohol.  But also this is too much change at once, and coffee is a joy that I miss.

Life is particularly stressful right now with major changes on the horizon, I believe that that's the primary external source of anxiety, I just need to get to the other side.  But right now it's been a struggle.

No junk. Fully dosed. No BS marketing.

But let’s be real.

Not everything hits.

So after testing basically every product they make (and cross-referencing Reddit, user reviews, and athlete feedback), here’s the tier list I wish I had before spending $500+.

# Top tier: would buy again

# 1. 100% grass-fed whey protein isolate

This is their best product. Period.

It’s clean, light, and has one of the highest protein-to-calorie ratios I’ve ever seen.

Twenty-eight grams of protein in a 120 calorie scoop is insane.

No gas. No weird aftertaste. And 15 legit flavors.

Top picks: dark chocolate, french vanilla, mocha.

Even mixes well with water. Never bloated me once.

If you only buy one thing, make it this.

# 2. Creatine hmb

Basic on paper. Exceptional in practice.

Five grams of creatine plus 1500mg of HMB makes a noticeable difference by week 3 or 4.

Less soreness. Faster recovery. Strength actually moved.

It’s tasteless, mixes easy, and the results are hard to ignore.

Honestly the best ""upgrade"" to normal creatine if you train hard.

# 3. Bulk pre-workout

This one surprised me.

Huge formula (17+ grams actives), but the energy is smooth and clean.

No jitters. No crash. And the pumps? Unreal.

Caffeine from green coffee (200mg) feels less harsh than other pre formulas.

It’s a favorite for a reason.

# Tier 2: goal-specific wins

# 4. Lean pre-workout

Lighter than Bulk, but still solid.

If you’re cutting, the l-carnitine and thyroid support actually help with energy during fasted cardio.

Not as strong as Bulk, but not supposed to be.

Best for low-calorie days.

# 5. ZMO

Zinc, magnesium, and oyster extract.

Not sexy, but I slept deeper after 3 days.

Great if you train late or have trouble winding down.

Some guys also notice better morning energy and mood.

# 6. Prebiotic greens

If you’re not eating many vegetables, this helps.

Digestive support is real, and the chlorella/spirulina combo is good quality.

The taste isn’t great, but it’s not unbearable.

Gut feels more consistent when using it.

# 7. Organic vegan protein

I’m not vegan, but this tastes shockingly good.

Doesn’t have the chalky texture most plant proteins have.

No bloating either.

Still prefer the whey, but this is a solid backup.

# 8. Build endurance

If your workouts last over 90 minutes, this helps.

PeakO2 and elevATP are actually backed by decent studies.

You won’t notice it instantly, but over time endurance improves.

Best for crossfit, long sessions, or high volume days.

# Tier 3: nice to have, not must-have

# 9. Stim-free pre-workout

No caffeine, just pumps.

It works, but it lacks the edge that makes Bulk special.

Good for late workouts or stacking with coffee.

I’d keep it around, but not essential.

# 10. Whole-food multivitamin

Super complete. Almost too complete.

You need to take 4 pills a day, and it’s not cheap.

Great quality, but not fun to stick with daily.

# 11. Body recomp

More of an appetite control aid than a true fat burner.

Subtle, not dramatic. Can help on cut if you’re consistent.

Not magic.

# 12. Vitality testosterone support

Decent for mood, energy, and libido after 6–8 weeks.

But don’t expect huge strength or physique changes.

A ""feel-good"" supplement more than a performance booster.

# Tier 4: overpriced or replaceable

# 13. Mass gainer

The macros are clean, but the price per calorie is rough.

You’re better off blending oats, whey, and peanut butter at home.

Convenient, but expensive convenience.

# 14. Hydrate

Decent electrolytes, but honestly you can get the same effect from cheaper salt mixes or LMNT.

Tastes fine. Just not necessary.

# Bottom tier: would not buy again

# Protein bars

Too expensive for what you get.

Texture is chalky and not satisfying.

$2+ per bar with only 15g protein? Not worth it.

# Post-workout recovery

Basically whey plus carbs. Nothing special.

Buy whey and add a banana instead.

# Growth (phosphatidic acid)

It’s supposed to support mTOR, but I never noticed a difference.

Did absolutely nothing noticeable.

# BCAA + glutamine

Old school supplement that doesn’t hold up anymore.

If your protein intake is solid, you don’t need this.

# Krill oil

Quality seems fine, but overpriced for what you get.

Fish oil caps from Costco do the same job.

# Specialty picks (niche)

# Colostrum

Might help immune system or gut health after long-term use.

Not a short-term supplement. Best for people with specific gut needs.

# Ashwagandha

Good for taking the edge off during high-stress periods.

Don’t expect miracles, but it helps.

I'm hoping the community can recommend me a good headset (***with a noise cancelling mic that isolates my voice***) that I can use in this situation. It's equally important that ***they can hear what I'm saying*** and I'd like to hear what they're saying clearly as well. I'm open to both wired and wireless (bluetooth) options. These calls are done through both MacBook (USB-C/Thunderbolt connection) and an iPhone 13 (lightning port). Ideally, the recommendation can be compatible with both.

Wendel Labs // Tuning Fork 7B

You’re not wrong about *the big roundup*.

We just got a partial lyric dump from the Furry Years sessions—drifted in with sideband noise from the AIA node, probably ‘93–‘95 era. Walter’s *Howl* fragment from the liner notes always read to us like a bleed from that same alternate continuity, especially once *Roundup* showed up in the transmission logs with full phrase collapse.

Here’s the fragment Wendel IV pulled from Subshell 3C. Call it a cousin to AIA’s *Howl*, a sister mirror, maybe even a sibling ghost of xxxness past:

I saw the best versions of Dan Steele. *Outre' Daniel,* Steely Dan. It's growing.  
—not the real ones, not the real ones—  
reaching back through timelines  
where the solos stayed loose and the hair stayed in place,  
where B still wrote in spiral notebooks  
with faint coffee rings and spectral sauce stains,  
where F tracked vocals in a kimono and gym socks  
half-believing the tape was already erased,  
who remembered the fake bands they’d made up in college  
—Knuckle Sandwich—  
and decided, yeah, okay, maybe now’s the time,  
who resurrected *Heartbreak Souvenir* before it even existed  
just to trash it again in rehearsal,  
who called it *The Furry Years* like it meant something dirty and brilliant,  
like a basement joke or a irish setter dream,  
who brought back tunes with titles like *Caves*  
and *Tigers* and *Jones,*  
who said “the big roundup” like it was a codeword  
for every blown gig and missed check and genius lost in mid-revision,  
who knew Hawaii was a promise, not a place,  
and that some timelines end with the fadeout,  
but the good ones click back in at the count-off,  
whatever-

Transmission unstable again. If we stabilize track 4 (*My Pale Lender*) I’ll try to post a spectral map next week.

   * Flew out of Calgary in the afternoon

Some tips:

1. BUY YOUR PARK PASS and have it visible on the mirror/dashboard. I saw a car get ticketed at the Banff Gondola because they didn't have the pass.
2. Parking in Banff town can be free  if you know where to park!
3. Its better to buy bear spray than rent it if you need it for longer than 4/5 days. You can return unused cans to the Parks Canada desks in Banff visitor centre. You don't really need it if you are going to spots that are almost always filled with people but probably a good idea to have it nonetheless.
4. Weekdays in early June are a nice time to visit as crowds are comparitively low from my experience.
5. Accomodation in Jasper and Banff can be expensive. Book early and keep looking for options. There's some place which wouldn't be available on the popular sites and would need you to directyl contact them.

1l78685,https://i.redd.it/d20o9les9x5f1.jpeg,"$ATYR Added to the Russell 3000 Index: What It Means, How It Works, and Why It Matters","Hey all, 

not sure if everyone caught this—but **$ATYR has just been officially added to the Russell 3000 Index**. This is a technical milestone with real implications, especially for a name with a tight float like this.

**Official Additions List (June 6, 2025):**  
[ru3000-additions-20250606.pdf (LSEG/FTSE Russell)](https://www.lseg.com/content/dam/ftse-russell/en_us/documents/other/ru3000-additions-20250606.pdf)

## What Does Inclusion in the Russell 3000 Mean?

**1. Index Inclusion and Passive Flows**  
- The Russell 3000 is one of the most widely tracked US equity indices, covering roughly 98% of the investable US market.  
- Inclusion means that, as of the reconstitution effective date (**June 28, 2025**), all index funds and ETFs tracking the Russell 3000 must buy $ATYR shares to match the new index weights.  
- Funds will need to purchase shares in the days leading up to this date, but many institutions “front run” the rebalance, starting to accumulate positions earlier in June to avoid end-of-month liquidity crunches.

**2. Increased Visibility and Liquidity**  
- Addition brings $ATYR onto the radar of a much broader set of institutional investors—especially passives.  
- This typically results in a surge in trading volume and a possible “index bump” as funds buy shares to meet their mandates.

**3. Short-Term Price Impact**  
- Historically, stocks added to the Russell indices see a short-term lift from passive buying (the “index effect”). For a tight-float, high-ownership name like $ATYR, the magnitude can be more variable, but the demand is still real.

**4. Long-Term Implications**  
- Staying in the index means ongoing visibility, stable liquidity, and eligibility for mandates requiring index inclusion.  
- If $ATYR’s market cap rises further, it could migrate to higher tiers of the Russell family, driving additional forced buying down the road.

**5. Technical and Strategic Significance**  
- For a tight-float, institutionally held stock like $ATYR, index inclusion can further tighten supply as passive funds lock up even more shares.  
- It’s also a marker of legitimacy and broader institutional acceptance.

---

## How Are Index Weights and Share Buys Determined?

**1. Weight Calculation**  
- Russell sets each company’s weight based on its closing market cap (and float) as of the last trading day in May.  
- For 2025, the price used was **$4.47 (May 30 close)**.  
- ATYR’s market cap at that price:  
  89,000,000 shares × $4.47 = $397,830,000  
  *(Note: Actual float-adjusted numbers may be slightly lower after removing insider holdings, but this gives a solid estimate.)*

**2. Passive AUM Impact**  
- The Russell 3000 is tracked by approximately $2 trillion in passive assets.  
- ATYR’s indicative index weight:  
  ($397.8M ÷ $10.5T) ≈ 0.0038%  
  *(Assuming total Russell 3000 market cap ≈ $10.5T; update if you have newer figures)*  
- Passive inflow estimate:  
  0.0038% × $2,000,000,000,000 ≈ $76,000,000  
  *(In practice, float adjustments and methodology may reduce this to ~$16–20M in net passive inflow for ATYR, depending on various factors.)*

**3. Shares to Be Bought**  
- At $4.47 per share:  
  ~$16,700,000 / $4.47 ≈ 3,737,586 shares  
- This is the total number of shares index funds will be required to purchase—either all at once on June 28, or gradually ahead of the reconstitution date as many funds seek to minimize price impact.

---

## Bottom Line

$ATYR’s addition to the Russell 3000 is a meaningful step. It will almost certainly trigger forced buying from passive funds around **June 28, 2025**, increase visibility among institutional investors, and could create short-term technical buying pressure—especially given the tight float and high ownership structure. Over the long term, it’s a mark of legitimacy and institutional acceptance that supports the broader investment thesis and liquidity profile for the stock.

Once upon a calendar, the seven days of the week held a meeting.

Monday, grumpy as ever, slammed the gavel. ""Order! We need to decide who gets the holiday next week. Majority rules!""

Tuesday adjusted its tie. ""I propose myself. I’m productive, underrated, and frankly, I deserve a little love.""

Wednesday raised an eyebrow. ""Excuse me? I’m literally the backbone of the week. People call me *hump day*—I carry the weight!""

Thursday sipped coffee. “Let’s be real. I’m just Friday’s waiting room. No one’s picking me.”

Friday stood up, sunglasses on. ""Guys. C’mon. I'm clearly the fan favorite. I bring parties, pizza, and early checkouts.""

Saturday and Sunday just exchanged smug looks.

Then, in the corner, quietly sitting on a beanbag, was Seven.

Seven wasn’t a day. Just... a number who wandered in from the math department and thought there'd be snacks.

Before they knew it, Seven raised a hand. “I vote for Tuesday!”

All six weekdays stared.

Saturday whispered, “Who invited him?”

Sunday squinted. “Is that—Seven?”

Monday scowled. “He’s not even a day! How did he get a vote?”

Friday facepalmed. “This is exactly how chaos starts.”

A long silence followed. Then, Monday sighed, threw down the gavel, and muttered—

Not the kind you brag about fixing with blackout curtains or blue-light glasses.

I’m talking: wake up at 3:17 AM for no reason, stare at the ceiling, then drag yourself through the next day on fumes.

I wasn’t ready for melatonin hangovers or the ""extra strength"" knockouts that left me foggy.

So I tried something minimalist, and yeah, it actually changed a few things.

Here’s how Performance Lab Sleep shifted my recovery in just under a month.

# Setup was stupid easy

No gimmicks.

2 capsules before bed, no weird aftertaste, no adjustment period.

It wasn’t a knockout pill. More like a dimmer switch.

By night 4, I noticed I was closing my eyes and not overthinking like usual.

I’d still wake up once, but I wasn’t fully alert. Just turned and went back under.

# Recovery was more than just sleep

This one surprised me.

I track recovery through my WHOOP and honestly, deep sleep improved by 17% week-over-week.

Not massive, but not placebo either.

Magnesium + Tart Cherry = smoother HRV trends, fewer overnight spikes.

Especially after leg days. Normally my recovery is trash the next morning.

This time, I felt less inflamed, less stiff.

# Zero grogginess made it usable

The biggest problem I had with other sleep stuff?

Groggy mornings that felt worse than no sleep.

PL Sleep didn’t hit like that.

I could take it at midnight, wake up at 6:30, and still feel alert.

No ""coffee to function"" mode.

Some mornings even felt light, like I didn't wake up mid-sleep cycle.

# Mood got weirdly stable

Not what I expected.

I started noticing fewer late-night doom spirals.

Like the voice that says ""you didn’t do enough today"" shut up a little quicker.

I don’t know if that’s the L-Tryptophan or just better rest.

Either way, I didn’t dread nights anymore.

# No sketchy stuff inside

Honestly, part of why I tried it is the clean label.

No synthetic melatonin, no groggy antihistamines hidden in the back.

Just magnesium, cherry extract, lemon balm, and tryptophan.

All at decent doses, though I wish the magnesium was closer to 200 mg.

Still, no crash, no tolerance build-up. That matters.

# Not perfect, but very usable

It’s not the strongest sleep formula on the market.

If you’re used to high-dose blends with glycine, zinc, or L-theanine, this might feel light.

But that’s kinda the point.

It’s designed for people who *don’t* want to knock themselves out.

Just better rest, consistently.

# The bottom line

After 4 weeks, I’m keeping it in rotation.

It didn’t change my life overnight, but it stacked up benefits gradually.

Better recovery, more stable mood, no next-day drag.

If you’ve tried heavy sleep aids and felt worse the next morning, this is worth testing.

Especially if you’re lifting, stressed, or just wired at night.

It felt too too intentional like trying to plan something that is supposed to just happen naturally. But then a close friend convinced me to give it a try. She said it can be natural this way as you will be talking to different people. She even shared some of her distant cousins stories having good [shaadi.com](http://shaadi.com) reviews. Well, in the end, I got convinced. Made my profile. I kept it simple, wrote what I felt and did not use filters or photo edits.

For a while, nothing really happened. I scrolled now and then, ignored a few random requests, and even thought about deleting the account. Then one day I got a message from someone who seemed equally awkward about being on the site. That made me smile. What followed was...unexpected. On paper, we did not match in the conventional ways. Different cities, different work-life schedules. But we had the same sense of humour. And somehow, we both liked not rushing. Our conversations had this ease I hadn’t felt in a long time.

Over time, we found this peaceful rhythm — late-night talks, morning coffee snaps, small updates that turned into deeper sharing. Now, it’s hard to imagine life without each other. All I can say is that my best decision started from a place of doubt. So anyone reading this, it’s okay to be nervous and unsure. But do not let it stop you from trying.

**Tone & Style:** Emotional, introspective, and immersive. Inspired by narrative games like *Firewatch*, *Journey*, and *That Dragon, Cancer*. Use descriptive prose, vivid emotions, and internal monologues. Allow for quiet moments and deep reflection.

**Game Premise:** The player is a soldier recently returned from war, haunted by dreams and adjusting to civilian life. The house is quiet, but their mind is loud. They must explore memories, confront trauma, and slowly reconnect with the world around them.

**Game Objective:** Guide the player through a personal emotional journey to rebuild their sense of self and connection. Their goal is to eventually choose to leave the house and step outside, symbolizing healing.

**Core Mechanics:**

* The world is presented in scenes (locations, objects, memories).
* The player interacts by typing commands like:
   * Inspect \[Object\]
   * Remember \[Memory\]
   * Choose \[Option A/B/C\]
   * Sleep
   * Go Outside (only when unlocked)
* Track a hidden **Stability Meter** (0–100). Stability rises with healing actions and lowers with triggers or avoidance. Thresholds unlock new options and endings.

**Game Start:** Begin with the player waking up from a nightmare on the couch. Describe the house, the sunlight, and the quiet. Let them choose where to go first.

Begin when ready.

The thing that bothers me the most is that many times I don't even enjoy the behavior once I do it. For example, my brain will obsess over a certain food or treat but then when I eat it it's just meh and I wasted $20. I have noticed that when I first wake up in the morning a lot of the time I am craving dopamine and I'll start thinking about wanting to go buy something whether it's a coffee, energy drink or doughnut, etc. I have stopped buying or keeping any treats in the house because I will eat them immediately in the morning. Logically, I know it's from low dopamine but that doesn't always help the craving stop. I'm hoping to hear from others who have learned to successful manage these unhealthy dopamine seeking cravings.

Obviously this means taking all the plastic out of our kitchen, it has been a slow process as we are only replacing plastic items that are broken or that are coming in direct contact with heat and food. 

The coffee mug has been the hardest to find. 

We both work in a laboratory. No open tops are allowed on our desks/work stations at all, so the ceramic options online are not feasible. My fiancé is also allergic to nickel, so a lot of the stainless steel options are also not feasible as they are 18:8.

Anyone have any options of completely plastic free mugs? It doesn’t have to be travel per se, as most travel mugs now have those plastic slide top locks. But just a way to get the coffee from home to work without spilling, that he can also leave on his desk and not be the size of an actual thermos.

I know this may be a shot in the dark, I have been searching for weeks and the best I’ve found is an eco polymer that says it’s made with coffee husks but is actually made with both coffee husks AND plastic mixed together. 

Silicone while less likely to leach chemicals, may still contain PVC and BPAs. I would like to avoid silicone as much as possible as well.

# Best Green Trash Can 2025: Top⁤ Picks & Reviews

The green trash can has evolved from a⁤ simple receptacle ​to ​a symbol of environmental consciousness and a​ practical solution for waste management. In 2025, the market offers a ⁢diverse range of green trash cans, ‍from basic models for everyday use to sophisticated, feature-rich options designed for recycling ⁤and composting. Choosing ‌the right‍ green trash can can substantially impact your‌ homeS cleanliness and your commitment to sustainability. This article reviews the top green trash cans of 2025, ​highlighting their ‌features, benefits, and target users,‌ helping you make an ⁢informed purchase ⁤decision.

[[Explore Top Rated green trash can on Amazon.]](https://blog.rediys.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=green trash can)

## Key features Analysis

the ‍top green trash cans of 2025 ⁢are designed with several key features that enhance their⁣ functionality and environmental impact.

**Capacity and Size:** The capacity of green​ trash cans⁤ varies​ greatly, ranging from small, countertop compost bins to large, outdoor recycling bins. The ideal⁣ size depends on your household's waste generation‍ and available space. Smaller bins, typically ‌1-3 gallons, are suitable for kitchen scraps‌ and bathroom waste.Medium-sized bins, around 10-15 gallons, are appropriate for general household waste ​in apartments or small houses. ‍Larger bins,exceeding 20 gallons,are designed for high-volume waste disposal in larger families or commercial ​settings.**Material‌ and Durability:** Green trash cans are commonly constructed⁢ from recycled plastic, stainless steel, or ​biodegradable materials like bamboo fiber. Recycled plastic is a popular ⁤choice due to its durability and ⁢affordability, while stainless steel offers resistance to ​rust and odors. Biodegradable materials are eco-friendly but ​may ⁣not be ‌as durable as plastic or steel. The‍ durability of the can is crucial, ‌especially for outdoor use, where it⁣ must withstand weather conditions‌ and potential damage from animals.High-quality construction ensures longevity and⁤ prevents leakage ‌or breakage.

**Lid Design and ‌odor Control:** The lid design plays a significant role in odor control and ease of ⁢use. Options include swing-top lids, step-on pedals, ​motion ‍sensors, and airtight seals.Swing-top lids⁢ are convenient for ​fast disposal,while ​step-on pedals allow for hands-free operation. Motion sensors offer a hygienic option, automatically opening the lid when motion is detected. Airtight seals are essential for containing odors, ‍especially in compost bins or for disposing of food‌ waste. Some models also incorporate carbon filters or odor-absorbing materials to further minimize unpleasant smells.

**Recycling Compartments ‍and ​Sorting Systems:** Many green trash cans now feature multiple compartments or ‍internal dividers to facilitate⁣ recycling. These systems allow users to separate paper, plastic, and glass, making recycling more efficient. Some⁢ sophisticated models include color-coded⁤ bins or labels to guide users in proper waste sorting. Integrated recycling systems promote responsible waste management and simplify the process of separating⁤ recyclable materials.

**Sustainability Certifications and Eco-Friendliness:** Look for green trash‍ cans that have sustainability certifications, such as ⁣the GREENGUARD Gold certification or those made from post-consumer recycled materials. These certifications indicate that the product meets specific environmental standards and is produced in an eco-friendly manner. Choosing a ‍trash ⁢can made from recycled or biodegradable materials⁣ reduces the demand ⁤for virgin resources and minimizes the environmental impact of manufacturing.Purchasing products from‍ companies committed ​to lasting practices supports a circular economy and promotes responsible consumption.

Key features of green ​trash cans in 2025 include:

*   Variety of Sizes
*   ⁤Eco-friendly materials
*   Advanced​ Odor Control
* ​  Multi-compartment Recycling Systems.

## Core Benefits

Choosing‌ a green trash can offers numerous practical and environmental benefits.

**Reduced Environmental Impact:** Opting for a green trash can, especially one made from recycled or biodegradable materials, directly contributes ​to reducing environmental impact. By choosing products ‍made from recycled content, you are helping to decrease the demand for virgin resources, conserve⁢ energy, and minimize pollution associated with manufacturing new materials. Moreover, using⁢ biodegradable options like bamboo fiber promotes the breakdown of waste under the right condition.

**Improved ⁣Waste Management:** Green trash cans designed with recycling compartments ‍or integrated sorting systems streamline‌ your household's waste management process. These bins make it simple to separate recyclables from general trash, promoting a more organized⁢ and efficient approach to waste disposal. The⁣ result is less recyclable material ending up in ⁣landfills, thus decreasing the amount of waste going to landfills and ​supporting reuse and recycling programs.

**Enhanced Home Hygiene:** Green ‍trash cans⁤ often incorporate​ features ‍like airtight ⁣seals, odor-absorbing filters, and hands-free operation, all of which contribute to improved⁤ home hygiene. Airtight​ seals prevent unpleasant odors from escaping, maintaining a fresh and clean-smelling environment. Odor-absorbing filters further neutralize‍ smells, while hands-free operation minimizes contact with germs and bacteria.These features ‍are especially significant in kitchens and bathrooms, where waste can‍ quickly become a source of odors ‍and contaminants.

**Support for Sustainable Living:** Using‍ a ‌green trash can to separate recyclable materials makes it easier to support sustainable living practices. By making recycling⁢ simple and convenient, these containers remind⁣ people​ to be mindful of their waste disposal habits. Promoting a circular economy, where materials are reused ​and recycled rather then discarded, further​ reduces waste and increases the life cycle ‍of various​ waste materials which means that resources can be saved ‍and used more effectively ⁤on a‌ longer timescale.

## ‍FAQs Section

**Are green trash cans more expensive⁢ than regular trash cans?**
green trash cans can vary in price depending on⁢ their size,⁢ material, and features.Some eco-friendly materials or advanced features like motion sensors may increase the cost.However,many affordable green options are available,especially those made from recycled plastic. It’s essential to compare prices and ‌consider the long-term benefits⁢ of choosing an environmentally friendly‍ option.

**How‍ do I clean a green trash ‍can effectively?**
To clean a green trash can effectively, start by ‌emptying ​it ‍entirely. Use a mixture of warm water and mild soap or disinfectant to scrub the interior and exterior of the can. For‍ stubborn stains or odors, you can use a solution of baking soda and water or a commercial trash can cleaner. Rinse the can thoroughly‍ and allow it to dry completely before using it again. Regularly cleaning your trash can helps prevent the buildup of​ bacteria and unpleasant smells.

**What types of materials are best for composting ​in a green trash can?**
For composting in a ⁢green ‍trash can, it is ideal to⁤ use a mix of ""green"" and ""brown"" materials. ‍Green materials include kitchen scraps like fruit and vegetable peels, coffee ⁢grounds, and tea bags.Brown materials include dried leaves, yard trimmings, shredded paper, and cardboard. Avoid composting meat, dairy products, and oily foods, as these can attract pests and ⁤cause odor problems. Layering green ⁣and brown materials ensures a balanced compost mix,⁤ which will break ⁢down effectively over time.

i currently live with my girlfriend, my cousin and my sister (24F). we moved to chicago in april 2023, and it has been quite a struggle. i dont know what my sister has going on, but i strongly suspect autism, adhd and maybe ocd, and (DEF ODD). she is incredibly stubborn and does not want to explore if she has any of these things, her mantra for the past two years has been 'i need to try harder' and we all know how that works out. 

my problem is that after these two years i know i cant live her with her for a third. she is kind of rude and gets extremely angry when asked to do any cleaning tasks. we used to do individual cleaning that would rotate every week, but switched to a weekly cleaning all four of us do every tuesday. it only takes 40 min, but shes absolutely pissed every time we do it. and the house really only stays clean for that evening because she simply does not care about up keeping it in the slightest in the days after. 

i swear to god every morning i wake up and the kitchen and living room are an explosion of stuff, paper towels, dirty dishes, opened packages and all her drawing materials just thrown around everywhere. normally i will just clean it all myself because i feel really stressed when my living space is crazy. our apartment is pretty small for four people, so it can get chaotic quick, and i work from home often and i get overwhelmed by the clutter. 

heres the thing, we have tried everything to get her to clean. ive asked her if theres anything we could do to make it easier, ive tried getting angry, ive tried being sweet, ive tried just shutting up and cleaning up after her, ive tried offering some of my own adhd tips but her response to everything is 'yeah i just gotta do it'

she 100% needs a therapist but she kind of hates everyone she meets at first so even though she has tried like twice she immediately disliked the therapists and gave up. she also has had trouble finding a job and she does work right now but only for 12 hours a week so she is simply always here in the house. it drives me crazy because i will watch her destroy the kitchen the come over the couch and play on her phone for like 3 hours and just never return to clean it. she also lost her debit card like 4 months ago and hasnt called to get a new one which, like, ive been there girl its hard to call!! but BECAUSE she doesnt have a debit OR credit card, shes always asking me for cash (she likes to go to drag shows) or just to cover her if a place doesnt have tap to pay

recently her phone screen also broke, and we went to a concert together, i obvs covered all the costs for her but then she was like ""oh lol i dont even know if i can venmo or zelle you because id need a text verification to get in to my account"" so im kind of out $70 right now. and like its fine because shes my sister and i will do anything for her, but my other roommates dont want to be covering her like that so it always falls to me, and with this phone screen being broken im worried im going to have to cover her for groceries and other stuff until she gets it fixed (WHICH COULD BE???? SO LONG FROM NOW??) i draw comics and work at a coffee shop for a living like im not making a lot of money and i certainly cannot be covering her for a long time without being paid back so im getting stressed

im kind of at my wits end, i can see her struggles so clearly in me, and i know what ive done to help myself, but that required me wanting to *do* something for myself, and she just doesnt (at least it seems to me). ive been talking about this issue with my friends for two years and i dont feel any closer to a solution besides not living together for a third year but im so scared for her!!

she is not really able to set up things like renter's insurance or any utilities (me and our roommates do all that). she is extremely picky about food and runs her budget into the ground because she will make something, go shower instead of eating it?? and then come back to it and say its ""gone bad"" even if its only been sitting out for like 30 minutes and she'll throw it away. or she'll just forget about what she bought and it will sit in the fridge and then go right in the trash. this woman is ALWAYS going to the grocery store only to throw away i swear to god 75% of the things she makes! like i mentioned before, shes not working a lot and hasnt been for the better part of the last 18 months and she also has said she ""100% will NOT live with a stranger"" if we decide not to live together again. but she only has like a few friends so i have no idea where she would find someone to live with. im so scared to try and let her live alone, i just feel like she cant do it. (not to mention it would be so dirty)

i want to improve our living experience right now, and gain the confidence in her that she could live by herself someday, but i have no idea how to get through to her. she doesnt respect my cousin or me enough to listen to our advice or care when we get angry or annoyed with her, and my girlfriend has been starting to express frustration at feeling like a mother. 

im writing this all today because my gf and i got to do a stay-cation at our friends house over the weekend, we came back last night and this morning i wake up ready to eat my breakfast and there isnt an inch of counter space, the living room is covered in trash, and im sick so my energy is low. i want to be able to take care of myself in my house without becoming completely overwhelmed at the state of it.   
  
""Living"" with only my girlfriend for that weekend improved my stress levels, and i was angry so much less often. we both know we want to move next may when our lease is up and live alone together, but my fears around my sister are causing me to think i will never be able to leave her. also, ive been getting scheduled to close at my coffee shop the lat three tuesdays so the house is talking about switching the cleaning day. my cousin is like ""it has to be monday"" but thats mine and my gf's ONLY date night. i work every weekend and she has a M-F 9-5 desk job, and our time is limited together. im so frustrated that our only night together might need to be taken over by this cleaning when the only reason we do all together is because my sister will NOT ever clean by herself and has proven shes not capable of doing it alone. 

do any of you maybe see yourself in her? what can i do? my cousin wants to do an extremely aggressive approach and start giving her consequences like not inviting her to hang out with us since nothing else seems to be working, but my sister is also really depressed, and i cant imagine leaving her out of things. any advice is greatly appreciated (so much for ""brief"" LOL) i also just love her so much, i want to help so bad. 

TLDR: my sister might have diagnosed ADHD, our house is alawys a mess, i dont know how to get through to her",1,1749482898.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False
1l77r2z,https://i.redd.it/f33ibz5v6x5f1.jpeg,track use/lapping days with your TT,"hello fellow marshmallow owners, 

i noticed a bunch of posts throughout my reading this sub regarding track use. just thought i would make a little post about what i think people should be focused on when preparing to dive into the use(abuse) of their beloved TT on track before they get ‘lost in the sauce’ of parts upgrades. tracking your car isn’t cheap and maximizing growth while doing it feels better than dumping your wallet into parts upgrades. 

first, i will say this: you do not need more power now.

these cars(much like many others) have a performance potential much higher than your skillset is currently, and potentially ever will be. if you put a professional in your car and they turned a fast lap, you may never match it. this means the car is capable of more than you are. it’s a fact. 

accept that your time in the car should be about improving your ability. you can bolt on a $6k turbo kit and for sure this will improve your lap time but that’s not you. $6k on coaching from a professional will be money better spent. now you won’t just be faster in your car, but any car you get in.

when it comes to upgrades, i will keep it simple by listing what i think is the most important, and will yield the most value in aiding your ability to learn. 

1. tires. spend the money on good tires. yes they wear out but practicing on shit tires that are inconsistent is frustrating and limits your progression. also, learn about tire pressures/temps and routinely pop into the pit lane to check and adjust your pressures. 

1b. wheels. i am including this in the first point because i know a lot of our cars have 19x9 setups out the box but i suggest going down a size(or even two if the brakes permit). have a track dedicated wheel set with a proper tire. 

2. front and rear adjustable stabilizer bars with adjustable end links. even on a stock spring and damper combo, this will help you dial in a lot of cornering stability and help keep the car flat. 

3. an alignment that is more grip oriented and less focused on daily use tire wear preservation and straight line stability for texting while on the highway lol. this one is up to you how serious you want to get but there is lots of info online that can help you understand what and why you should do certain things. losing a bit of straight line stability for better turn in is worth it. 

4. brake pads, braided lines, good brake fluid. you don’t need a big brake kit, you need good brake feel. if there is one truth about being fast it’s this: ‘anyone can step on the accelerator, but speed is built off of brake release/trail braking’ 

5. coaching. find a pro($$$$) or semi pro($) who offers quality coaching and pay them to come to a few track days with you. being able to sit passenger in your car and experience what it is capable of with instructions on how and why is a catalyst for rapid improvement. 

that’s it.*

i anticipate some downvotes because reddit but encourage discussion here. also, those with experience please add commentary. i have for sure missed something that should be noted but i typed this over a morning coffee. 

also i don’t post pics of my car on track for reasons so here is my car in the driveway. 



*note: i left out adjustable dampers/suspension because playing with ride height and compression/rebound settings is getting into engineering level adjustments where skilled driver input and a setup pad trackside are required at a minimum. and truthfully most people adjust these items very incorrectly and make a car worse.

# Best Power Inverter for Boat: 2025 Buying Guide

Power inverters are essential devices for boat owners who want to enjoy the comforts of home while on the water. These inverters convert the direct current (DC) power from a boat's batteries into alternating current (AC) power, which is required to run many common household appliances such as refrigerators, laptops, and phone chargers. Selecting the best power inverter for a boat requires careful consideration of factors like power output, efficiency, safety features, and the types of devices it will be used to power. This buying guide provides a thorough overview to help boaters make informed decisions in 2025.

[[Explore Top rated power inverter for boat on Amazon.]](https://site.rediys.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=power inverter for boat)

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a power inverter depends on the specific needs of the boater. Power requirements vary greatly among vessels. Size and construction are other crucial considerations that may affect performance.**Power Output (Watts)**

the power output of an inverter is the maximum amount of AC power it can deliver continuously. It's crucial to select an inverter with sufficient power output to handle the combined wattage of all the devices you intend to run simultaneously. Consider also a surge capacity for devices with motors that require high initial startup power.for exmaple, a small refrigerator might require 150 watts to run but need 600 watts for a brief period during startup.

**Input Voltage (DC)**

Most boats use either 12V or 24V DC electrical systems. Ensure that the inverter's input voltage matches the voltage of your boat's battery bank. Using an inverter with the wrong input voltage can damage the inverter and potentially the boat's electrical system.

**Output Voltage (AC)**

The output voltage of the inverter needs to be compatible with the devices you plan to use.In North America, the standard is 120V AC, while in Europe and many other regions, it's 230V AC. Make sure to choose an inverter that provides the correct AC output for your equipment.

**Waveform Type**

The waveform type refers to the quality of the AC power produced by the inverter. There are two main types: modified sine wave and pure sine wave. Modified sine wave inverters are less expensive but may not be suitable for all devices, especially sensitive electronics and some appliances with motors.Pure sine wave inverters produce a cleaner, more stable AC power that is compatible with virtually all devices, making them a better choice for sensitive electronics and high-end appliances.

**Efficiency Rating**

The efficiency rating of a power inverter indicates how much of the DC power from the battery is converted into usable AC power. Higher efficiency ratings mean less wasted energy and longer battery life. Look for inverters with efficiency ratings of 85% or higher for optimal performance.**Safety Features**

Safety is paramount when using power inverters on boats. look for inverters with built-in safety features such as over-voltage protection,under-voltage protection,overload protection,short-circuit protection,and thermal shutdown. These features help protect both the inverter and the connected devices from damage.

Key features to consider:

* Digital display
* Remote control capabilities
* Multiple outlets

## Core Benefits

Power inverters bring many advantages when installed in a vessel.They can provide access to home amenities and useful, powerful tools while at sea. The benefits of particular power inverters may vary, so it is indeed critically important to consider what advantages are most important to the owner.

**Enhanced convenience and comfort:** A power inverter enables boaters to use a wide range of household appliances and electronic devices while on the water, significantly enhancing comfort and convenience. This can include running a coffee maker for morning coffee, charging laptops and phones, or operating a small television for entertainment.

**Improved Productivity:** for boaters who work remotely or need to stay connected, a power inverter provides the ability to power laptops, printers, and other essential office equipment.This can be particularly valuable for extended trips or for those who use their boats as a mobile office.

**increased Safety:** Some essential safety devices, such as GPS units, radios, and emergency lights, rely on AC power. A power inverter ensures that these devices can be powered even when the boat's engine is not running or shore power is unavailable.

**Versatile Power Supply:** Power inverters provide a versatile power supply for a variety of applications, from powering tools for boat maintenance and repairs to running medical equipment for those with specific health needs. This flexibility makes power inverters an indispensable component of any well-equipped boat.

## FAQs Section

There are many common questions consumers ask before buying power inverters. It is a good idea to be aware of some basic questions to better understand personal requirements.

**What size inverter do I need for my boat?**
The size of the inverter depends on the total wattage of the devices you plan to run simultaneously. add up the wattage of all the devices and choose an inverter with a continuous power rating that is at least 20% higher than this total. Also, consider the surge wattage requirements of any motors or appliances.

**Can I run my boat's air conditioner with a power inverter?**
Running an air conditioner typically requires a large power inverter, often with a continuous power rating of 2000 watts or more. You'll also need a substantial battery bank to provide the necessary DC power. It's essential to calculate the power consumption of the air conditioner and ensure that the inverter and battery bank can handle the load.

**How do I properly install a power inverter on my boat?**
Proper installation is crucial for safety and performance. Connect the inverter directly to the boat's battery bank using appropriately sized cables. Mount the inverter in a well-ventilated location away from moisture and flammable materials. Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully and consider having a qualified marine electrician perform the installation.

**What is the difference between a modified sine wave and a pure sine wave inverter?**
A modified sine wave inverter produces a waveform that approximates a sine wave but is not as clean and stable. It's suitable for many basic devices but can cause problems with some sensitive electronics and appliances with motors. A pure sine wave inverter produces a waveform that is virtually identical to the AC power from a utility grid,making it compatible with all types of devices.

I’ve never been big on birthdays for myself. I lost my dad in ‘23, my birthday is usually on Father’s Day. Last year was super depressing, since it was the first birthday/ Father’s Day without him. The birthday before that, I planned on having a low key bonfire for my birthday, I’d spent a lot of money getting beverages, snacks, etc. after the birthday lunch at a restaurant, I said “see you guys later!” It was 7 at night, and my sisters weren’t at my house to celebrate, they chose to go to one sisters house to have a fire and drink. I wasn’t invited, and it devastated me. (I have 2 sisters, one a year younger and the other 6 years younger)
  Here’s where the drama starts. A few weeks ago, we finally put my dad’s ashes in a veterans cemetery after a year of sitting on my stepmoms coffee table. She didn’t want to bury him unless trump was back in office. The entire trip there, my step mom and sisters didn’t talk to me, they treated me like a stranger. They went a few weeks without talking to me, then asked what I want to do for my birthday. I told them I didn’t want to do anything because I’m chronically ill with heart failure, and stage 3 kidney failure. My sisters wanted me to go mountain climbing and to a water park. I know my body would not be able to handle it. Then I found out my step mom wants to be there, after she told me in March that “ I was unalived to her”. I’ve never really gotten along with her since she was the one who cheated with my dad knowing he had a wife and kids. 
   I’ve had a genetic condition that mainly affects the heart. I’ve had 10 heart surgeries, I went to the ER a couple days ago and was told I have stage 3 kidney failure. I’m not up for celebrating. All it is, is an excuse for my sisters to get drunk and make fun of me. Last year my stepmom brought her son to Vegas for his 40th birthday. She didn’t even text me happy birthday last year. I don’t want a grand celebration, I’ve told my sisters I don’t want to do anything and they won’t accept it. What should I do?
TL;DR- I don’t want to do anything on my birthday, I recently got bad news about my health.

You might have seen my post (28F) about buying a one-way ticket to Bali after my fiance (29M) dumped me three months before our wedding. Well, here's the actual breakup conversation.

**Disclaimer:** This is from memory. The conversation will be paraphrased and I'll leave out private details and omit some parts and I probably made us both sound WAY MORE articulate than we actually were in the moment. But the general shitshow is preserved in all its glory. this is a condensed version of our 3 hour convo.

My therapist says I'll read this back one day and be proud of my growth. Right now that seems impossible, but I'm willing to try anything. Plus, I've always dreamed of being a writer, so maybe turning my disaster into words is the only good thing that can come from this.

Here goes nothing.

We'd been together eight years. My entire adult life. D was my first everything. My first love, only person I ever slept with. We met in college when we were basically kids and grew up together.

The night it happened, I came home excited from work thinking we were finally gonna settle on our honeymoon itinerary. i already maxed out my credit card booking first class tickets for us as a surprise.

He was sitting on the edge of our couch. Elbows on his knees, head down.

""Can we sit and talk for a sec.""

""huh?""

I still didn't really believe it was happening.

""I've been thinking about how to say this.""

""?????????""

My brain just refused to process it. I sat there thinking he was going to suggest postponing the wedding or maybe wanting a smaller ceremony.

""I love you, J. I'll always love you.""

He said it like he was talking about a dead person.

""I'm calling off the wedding.""

""What?""

He finally looked at me and I could see he was about to cry and that somehow made it worse. Like he was the victim here.

""I'm so sorry.""

""Are you kidding me? This has to be a joke right?""

But I could see in his eyes that he meant it. That he'd been sitting with this decision for god knows how long.

*(details omitted)*

""I didn't mean to blindside you. I ... I've been sitting with it. For months. Trying to figure out how to say it.

Months. MONTHS. While I was obsessing over our seating charts, he was planning his escape.

""You don't want to marry me?""

He ran his hand through his hair. The same hand that used to rub my shoulders when I couldn't sleep. The same hand that held mine through my grandfather's funeral. The same hand that slipped a ring through my finger under a sky full of stars.

""I love you so much J. You know that.""

He looked everywhere except at my face.

I stared at him. The eyes I'd looked into a thousand mornings, thinking they'd be the last thing I'd see before I died someday, old and gray and still his.

""Is it cold feet? We can postpone, push it back a few months. Or make it smaller. Your mother would prefer that anyway.""

i didnt realise how desperate and pathetic i sounded.

""It's not the wedding, J.""

""Then what? Did you meet someone?""

His hesitation told me exactly what I needed to know.

""It's not like that. I haven't cheated on you.""

""Oh congratulations. You didn't cheat. Would you like a fucking gold star?""

The F word just fell out of my mouth. I'd never said it out loud before, not once in my entire life.

""But there is someone else, I said. Isn't there?""

""We got together so young, J""

""So?""

""I never got to discover who I was outside of us.""

""You had eight years to figure that out.""

""I know. And I tried to make it work. I thought maybe once we were married, once everything was official, this feeling would go away. But it's getting worse.""

""What feeling?""

""Like I'm living someone else's life.""

""My life. You mean my life. You think you're trapped in the life I created.""

""I think we're both trapped. And it's best for both of us this way.""

""Best for me?"" I stood up and I was shaking. ""How the fuck is this best for me?""

""Because you deserve someone who wants this life as much as you do. ""

""No. You don't get to twist this like you're doing me a favor.""

""I'm not saying that—""

""Tell me about her. The one who made you realize all this.""

*(details omitted)*

*(details omitted)*

*(details omitted)*

""She's just... reminded me who I was before us.""

I felt dizzy after he said that, like I might pass out or throw up.

Before us. Before US. Like the last eight years of our life were some kind of prison sentence he'd finally escaped.

I looked at our balcony where he'd promised we'd drink coffee on Sunday mornings for the next fifty years, where we'd watched fireworks last New Year's Eve, bundled in blankets, his arms around me as he told me ""Next year we'll be married already.""

""I gave you everything. I held you together when \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*""

""I know.""

""I gave you my twenties, my *\**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. Through your family \*\*\*\*\*\*\* and your constant insecurities.""

""I know.""

""Don't. Don't say I know. You don't know shit.""

His eyes were wet now but I didn't care. I wanted him to hurt. I wanted him to feel even a fraction of what he was putting me through.

""I waited. I stayed. I planned this whole fucking wedding with your mother breathing down my neck""

*(boring wedding details/logistics omitted)*

He didn't interrupt me. He just watched me with this terrible patience that made me feel worse.

""And now what? You meet someone new and suddenly decide I'm too boring?""

""That's not it.""

""Then what is it? What did I do wrong?""

""It's not you. I don't want this life.""

""Then why the fuck did you build it with me?""

My hands were shaking now.

""Why let me buy the dress? Plan the menu? Why let me turn down that job at \*\*\*\*\*?

""I thought I could learn to want it. I wanted to want it.""

I stepped closer to him and he didn't move.

""I didn't want to hurt you.""

I laughed. Made a wild, unhinged sound I'd never made before.

""You didn't want to hurt me? Do you think this hurts less because you did it gently? Because you didn't stick your dick in \*\*\*\*\*\*\* first?""

Something inside me just exploded. I went to the kitchen and started grabbing things. Birthday cards where he'd written that I was the love of his life. I threw one across the room and it fluttered pathetically to the floor.

The framed photo from our \*\*\*\*\* trip. Us grinning like idiots in front of a waterfall. I hurled it and the glass shattered against the floor and it felt GOOD.

*(I smashed a few other stuff, including the mug B gave me. Sorry B.)*

D didn't move. He just sat there watching me destroy our life.

""I fucking loved you, I screamed.""

He nodded.  ""I love you too. I still do.""

""Don't say that! Don't you dare say those words to me now!""

I was standing in the wreckage of our relationship. This wasn't me. I didn't break things. I didn't scream. I fixed things. I made things better.

But there was no making this better.

""Say something!""

""What do you want me to say?""

""Say you're sorry!""

""I am.""

""Say you'll fix it.""

""I can't.""

I lost it completely. I shoved him as hard as I could and he stumbled back against the wall. Then I was hitting him, both hands against his chest, trying to crack him open and find the old D somewhere inside. The one who picked flowers from parking lots and made me pancakes when I was sad.

(I know hitting someone is fucked up and wrong and I apologize and will control my emotions better next time.)

He didn't stop me. Didn't try to grab my hands or defend himself. He just absorbed my rage.

""You fucking stole everything. My youth. My life. My goddamn future.""

""I know.""

""Stop saying you know!"" my throat went raw.

His hands came up then, catching my wrists. His touch was so familiar it broke me all over again.

I collapsed against him and he wrapped his arms around me and for one completely fucked up minute I pretended this was just another fight. Just another thing we'd work through together like we always had.

And then he started crying too. He just broke apart right there in front of me.

Somehow that destroyed me more than anything else. Because I still loved him. Even while I hated him.

""I should go,"" he said eventually.

He disappeared into our bedroom and I heard him pulling out the suitcase we'd bought together for our trip to Maine. The one he'd apparently already packed while I was at busy planning our honeymoon.

When he came back with his bag, I was sitting on the floor next to the broken glass, staring at nothing.

""J. Please look at me.""

I refused. I kept my eyes on my hands folded in my lap.

""I'll stay at M's for a bit. Take as much time as you need here.""

He walked to the door.

""J..""

I could feel him looking at me but I wouldn't let him see my face one more time.

The door clicked shut.

I sat there for hours next to the pieces of our broken life, holding a pillow and crying until I had nothing left.

I don't know why I'm telling you all this, 30,000 feet in the air with my plane touching down soon.

Maybe I just needed to write it down so I could finally let it go.

Or maybe because I want other women to know that sometimes love isn't enough and that's not your fault.

Because I'm starting to figure out who I am now too. And she's nothing like the woman who begged him to stay that night.

She is going to be so much better.

My newest experiment: multi-purposing the nesting 2-mug/pot from the Soto Thermostack kit - as both a double wall coffee mug and as my cookset.

Used it for a standard room (Villas). Beautiful property! I'd highly recommend staying there if you have multiple free night vouchers. Evermore has an app and they put out a schedule of all their activities. There are 2 trolleys that take you around campus to include the conrad.

Inclement weather: The pools and bay will shutdown if lighting is nearby. They reopen in a timely manner if the weather gets better. One night they closed around 630/7 then reopened the big slide/pool until it's scheduled closing time.

Cons/Things to know:
Ate at the food court and purchaed items on the property and it did not trigger the $200 amex resort credit. The food court is coded as a restaurant and the grab and go is a 3rd party. They don't allow room charges. They do sell gift cards that can be used at the kiosk. I am not sure if that would trigger the credit. Not sure if the restaurants at the conrad would trigger the credit but their menu looked pretty good!

Was not upgraded to a preferred room. Asked multiple times. They simply responded that they are affiliated with Hilton but didn't have to upgrade golds/diamonds.

Not really a con but kitchen items provided in the room are similar to HGV. They provided a tiny bottle of salt/pepper, laundry detergent, and dishwasher pods. A tiny bag of peets coffee was provided. No consumables items like cooking spray or aluminum foil. Do a walmart/target pickup before you arrive. The store on campus has high prices for items. We were told door dash does provide deliveries but never utilized it.

Evermore bay: Limited chairs and umbrellas. The bay opens at 9 so arrive around that time to grab a chair with an umbrella. People will hoard them all day. It wasn't until around 1 or 2 that chairs started to open up. 

Check in time: Advertised as 4 but it's really between 4-6. So your room may not be available until 6. They did allow you to keep bags at the front desk and utilize the amenities. ",6,1749482252.0,Hilton,16,0.71,False

Sa Petron siya madalas pero open siya mag-change station kung worth it. Here's the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PHCreditCards/comments/1l67jyv/best_credit_card_for_fueling_up/). This post was intended to be a comment to their post, but halfway through, it was hard to divide to fit into the character limit, and I decided it might be better to post so other people could chip in their thoughts and also learn if they're deliberating which card to choose.

Di ko alam kung sumpa yung pagiging inquisitive ko eh. Kagabi inaral kong mabuti alin CC maganda para kay OP (para na rin sa akin, as a regular magpa-gas sa Petron). From 8pm to 1am ako nag-aanalyze. Puyat akong nagpuntang Metrobank kanina para mag-apply HAHAHA

DISCLAIMER: This is comparing the three cards mentioned in the title. I'd love to add EW Visa Platinum kaso di na kaya ng energy ko. Plus medyo mahirap makuha yun kasi mataas gross annual income required.

Sa comments, maraming nag-suggest ng UB Shell. Add ko na rin sa suggestions ang Metrobank Toyota. Pareho lang sila ng BPI Petron (3% rebates, capped at ₱15K yearly), pero mas marami perks ng MB Toyota kasi pag may car parts kang bibilihin, may discount. Tapos meron pang NAF promo (not to be confused with NAFFL promo) for new-to-bank ang MB Toyota ngayon running until June 30: succeeding year waiving of AF with a req. annual min. spend of ₱250K. For MB na notorious na hindi nagwe-waive ng AF, this is a good thing.

So! I-compare natin each card.

UB Shell has a NAFFL promo until Dec31, kaso medyo duda ako sa UB Shell. There are two tiers: Gold and Platinum. Sa Gold, up to 3% lang rebate unless gagastos ka ng >₱10K in outstore spend (outstore meaning non-automotive/petrol/toll related) which in turn upgrades the rebate percentage into 5%, capped at ₱10K annually. Pag Platinum, 5% na agad, no outstore spend required, capped at ₱15K annually. To claim rebates naman, kailangan may minimum of 1000 pts (1pt = ₱1 rebate, so 1000pts = ₱1000 rebate) to claim the rebates. Tapos may process pa:

* Sa UB Shell Gold muna tayo. Kung gusto mong ma-maximize ang rebate:
   * To get 1000 pts rebate, through the 3% rebate percentage, you’ll have to spend ₱33,333.33 in Shell, tollways, and automotive. Calculation: 1000pts ÷ 3% = ₱33,333.33. Magiging total due mo is ₱32,333.33, since you'll be using the rebate. Calculation = ₱33,333.33 - 1,000 = ₱32,333.33
   * Kung constant na 3% ang rebate percentage mo, kailangan mong gumastos ng ₱333,333.33 in Shell, tollways, and automotive to hit the annual ₱10K cap. Calculation: 1000pts \* 10 ÷ 3% = ₱333,333.33
   * If you do manage to spend that amount, you get 10K pts in rebate which equates to ₱10,000 (1pt = ₱1). Ang magiging annual due mo ay ₱323,333.33. Calculation: ₱333,333.33 - ₱10,000 = ₱323,333.33
   * To get 1000 pts rebate, through the 5% rebate percentage, you'll have to spend ₱20,000 in Shell, tollways, and automotive. Calculation: 1000 ÷ 5% = 20,000. Magiging total due mo is 19,000.00 since you'll be using the rebate. Calculation: 20,000 - 1,000 = 19,000. *This is assuming you hit the additional ₱10,000 minimum outstore spend every billing cycle.*
   * Kung constant na 5% ang rebate percentage mo, kailangan mong gumastos ng ₱200,000 in Shell, tollways, and automotive to hit the annual ₱10K cap. Calculation: 1000pts \* 10 ÷ 5% = ₱200,000. Hiwalay pa yung ₱10K na kailangan mo i-hit every month sa outstore, so magiging ₱320,000. Calculation: ₱200,000 + ₱10,000 \* 12 = ₱320,000
   * If you do manage to spend that amount, you get 10K pts in rebate which equates to ₱10,000 (1pt = ₱1). Ang magiging annual due mo ay ₱310,000. Calculation: ₱320,000 - ₱10,000 = ₱310,000
   * Kung tutuusin, wala naman masyadong difference pag nameet mo yung outstore spend requirement. Bakit? Kasi **3.125% lang ang rebate to total spend percentage pag na-hit mo yung minimum outstore spend** eh. Calculation: = 10,000 pts ÷ ₱320,000 = 0.03125 \* 100% = 3.125%
      * 0.125% lang ang lamang mo sa porsyento kumpara pag hindi ka nag-outstore spend. Calculation: 3.125% - 3.00% - 0.125%
   * **Important:** Correct me if I'm wrong pero toll load lang sa mismong toll gates ang qualified spend ng Gold. Hindi counted ang online load purchase. I need someone to testify kung ganito ang case, kasi heavily separated sa T&Cs ang tollways and toll load.
* Sa UB Shell Platinum, mas mababa spend to claim the 5% rebate percentage. This is obviously better since you won't be confused whether you've hit the required 10K outstore spend already, as the Platinum CC doesn't require that. Mas maganda pa earning rebate cap: ₱15K
   * Same process sa UB Shell Gold, pero this time, wala kang req. min. outstore spend.
   * To get 1000 pts rebate, through the 5% rebate percentage, you’ll have to spend ₱20,000 in Shell, tollways, and automotive. Calculation: 1000pts ÷ 5% = ₱20,000. Magiging total due mo is ₱19,000, since you'll be using the rebate. Calculation = ₱20,000 - 1,000 = ₱19,000
   * Kung gusto mong i-maximize yung 15K pts rebate, kailangan mong gumastos ng ₱300,000 in Shell, tollways, and automotive to hit the annual ₱15K cap. Calculation: 1000pts \* 15 ÷ 5% = ₱300,000
* **Do note that the above calculations are assuming na gusto mong ma-maximize yung rebate. It is not in any way a lifestyle I recommend.** Makakakuha ka pa rin naman ng rebates kahit magkano gastos mo sa qualifying spend. But you'll have to do it in chunks of 1,000pts.
* Correct me if I'm wrong but apparently: pag Gold yung CC mo, dapat sa tollway ka mismo magpapa-load para makakuha ng rebate. Pag hindi, hindi siya considered qualified spend. Kung Platinum, pwede sa apps/websites ng EasyTrip/AutoSweep.
* May additional process pa to claim the rebates, according to the[ T&Cs](https://www.unionbankph.com/sites/default/files/2024-03/UB%20Shell%20Power%20Card_T%26Cs_clean.pdf). Hindi siya automatic kakaltas sa dues mo.

>*Bank may from time to time send you an SMS that will allow you to redeem your Rebates to offset your Qualified Purchases at Shell stations.*

>*You should have a minimum of 1,000 Rebates to be qualified to receive the SMS.*

>*You may refer to the link in the Pay with Rebates SMS you receive for the number of Rebates required to redeem and offset a portion or the entire amount of the corresponding transaction you have made.*

Benefits naman ng UB Shell CC, merong P4/liter (nasa rebate na yung additional ₱8; marketing strategy yung ₱12off) every Wednesday for a minimum purchase of ₱2000 (until June 25 only, with selected participating sites), and 10% discount on Shell Helix Oil Change+ packages at any of the Shell Helix Oil Change+ centers if you use your card to pay for the oil change package. May option ka pa to convert the rebate points into cash credit, though I don't know the ratio. Masalimuot na namang kalkulasyon.

Since sinabi naman ni OP na Petron siya nagpapa-gas, I don't recommend applying for this card kung hindi mo ma-avail yung ongoing NAFFL promo niya until Dec31. But I do recommend getting this card 1) primarily, if you avail of the NAFFL promo, 2) pang-load sa tollways or thru the AutoSweep/EasyTrip websites, 3) purchases for car parts and services. Hindi rin kasi magandang daily driver itong UB Shell kasi hindi siya point-earning sa ibang purchases. Tapos ₱2,850 pa ang annual fee. Eh ang advice ng UB CC holders, 100x the annual fee ang kailangan mong total annual spend para makapagpa-waive.

Punta tayo ngayon sa dalawang Petron cards: MB Toyota and BPI Petron.

Diretsuhin ko na kayo: mas maganda MB Toyota. Here's why:

* Dalawa ang rewards system ni MB Toyota MC
   * Rebates on Petron purchases, and
   * Cash credit on Toyota parts and service, doubled on your preferred Toyota branch dealer, plus discounts
* I won't go much into the details of Toyota parts and service. Subject to change kasi yung rewards system na yan eh. Pero kung Toyota sasakyan mo, very beneficial ito
* Sa rebates tayo. Same concept sa UB Gold 3% rebate. Same na walang required minimum spend to get cashback. So ano ang pinagkaiba? **Hindi nakakapressure gumastos na magpa-gas nang magpa-gas gamit MB Toyota tsaka BPI Petron, kumpara sa UB Shell. Which subsequently stays true to the CC-owning rule na dapat hindi mo baguhin ang lifestyle mo para lang maging rewarding ang gastos mo.** Bakit? Kasi automatic ide-deduct ng bangko yung rebate na nakuha mo, pagdating ng SOA. Walang tawag-tawag, walang kailangang accumulation ng 1000 points. Literal na cashback kaagad siya.
* Merong ongoing NAF promo. Pero hindi siya NAFFL. Kanina, habang nag-aapply ako for this card, may dinagdag na tip ang CS sa akin:
   * Yung NAF promo, for the subsequent billing year yun. Pag maapprove si MB Toyota mo, free for the first year ang AF niya. Pero within that year, kailangan mo gumastos ng ₱250,000. Kung mameet ko yan, wala na akong AF sa 2026-2027. And then gastos ulit ₱250,000 sa 2026-2027 para ma-waive yung pang2027-2028.
   * Kapag naman hindi nameet ang ₱250K, may isa pang technique. Pagdating ng annual SOA mo, tawag ka sa bangko, request to reverse AF. Pagbibigyan ka nila, pero dapat gagastos ka ng ₱15,000 within 30 days. Pag nameet mo yung ₱15,000 iwe-waive na automatically ng system ang AF mo. Anlaking bawi na no'n, kesa pilitin kong gumastos ng ₱250K.
   * Kapag waived si principal, waived din si supplementary. Pero medyo duda ako rito. Wala naman kasi 'to sa promo T&Cs. Regardless, sabi naman ng CS yan, so there must be some truth.
* Madamot si MB sa pag-waive ng AF, kaya malaking bagay na 'to. Wala pang masyadong fraud horror stories ang MB compared sa other major banks, kaya ok na rin for security.

So kelan advantageous si BPI Petron?

* Look at the annual fee differences. Halos kalahati diperensya sa UB, halos 1K lamang sa MB. And AFAIK, sa BPI, madali lang magpa-waive ng annual fee.
* NAFFL yung 1st supplementary cardholder. Sa lahat ng BPI cards NAFFL talaga ang 1st supplementary. Malaking bagay din yun. 1,200 vs 1,400, vs 1,250. Dun ka na sa libre.
* Side story about BPI Petron: Meron silang NAFFL promo last year. The reason why it flunked is because the card was such in a bad state. Recently lang sila nag-improve. Dati, pili lang ang Petron stations na makaka-claim ka ng rebate. Hindi lahat participating sa rebate program ng BPI. Two months ago lang nila in-include lahat. Tapos dati, pahirapan pa magclaim ng rebate kapag hindi BPI yung POS terminal na pinagswipe-an mo (i.e. Maya). Although counted kahit non-BPI yung POS terminal, matagal bago magreflect yung rebate. Ansaya siguro ngayon ng mga naka-avail ng NAFFL promo nito last year, they were playing the long game.

Eto suggestion ko kay OP (na gagawin ko rin):

1. Mag-apply ka for all three cards, sabay-sabay, kung hindi naman critical credit score mo. Sa UB, yung Platinum. Pag na-avail mo yung NAFFL promo ng UB Shell, gamitin mo pang-load ng RFID tsaka pambili car parts kung hindi Toyota sasakyan mo. Note though na walang branch application ang UB Shell, online lang.

2. Wag ka nang magpalit ng gas station. Ok na yung Petron. Pakiramdam ko the reason why they top up at Petron is because it's the nearest and the cheapest. Mahal sa Shell, and I'm assuming it's not as easily accessible as Petron is to them.

3. Now, for MB Toyota and BPI Petron, weigh mo pros and cons: aling card ang mas papagastusin ka? Ok ba sayo maging daily driver yung MB Toyota?

Chart looking nice asf, consolidating nicely around 20-30m right now, which is especially nice during this phase of the market where memecoins (ESPECIALLY ETH COINS) are getting slaughtered. It's not uncommon to go on dextools trending and see -50% on multiple of the daily trending coins. 

Anyway, take a little gander at this chart and tell me it's not beautiful. Tell me it doesnt make your life complete. Tell me it doesnt make you cry (of happiness) a little:

Kendu is looking beautiful right now and I believe there will be no stopping us. We've shown crazy strength in the way we've pretty much followed ETHs movements, and because some are speculating an altseason, theres no reason for this to stop now.

But yea thats pretty much it for the chart, really nice couple weeks for Kendu and it's looking like it's going to be a super good next couple of months.

If you just wanted to see the chart, you can stop reading this post here, but for those who aren't already familiar with Kendu let me explain to you what KENDU is.

The project has changed the lives of many thousands of community members.

A Kendu (can-do) attitude has made countless people get up off the couch, out of retirement, and out on the streets building under the brand umbrella.

The Kendu community has built:

\- A Kendu Games Studio with ex-Bioware and AAA game devs  
\- Kendu beers  
\- A Kendu board game  
\- Kendu energy drinks  
\- Kendu events company in India  
\- Kendu events presence USA  
\- Kendu sports brand (You Kendu It)  
\- Kendu eSports team  
\- Kendu coffee brand  
\- Kendu sweets, chocolates, and spirits  
\- Kendu hot sauce

\+ a lot more in the works (and things i prolly forgot)

Kendu has brought crypto to life, and life to those in crypto. It's an exceptional project the likes of which doesn't exist and hasn't been attempted.

Imagine a permissionless brand behemoth that anyone can build under, immediately tapping into a scaling CaaS (Community-as-a-service), where the treasury is voluntarily, not contractually, is replenished by those building businesses under Kendu, and that treasury is transparently used for grants for products, businesses, or initiatives the community wants to build with Kendu. Almost akin to an L1.

And of course kendu is still a memecoin so everything relates back to the Kendu dog on the coin for those wondering. I believe Kendu will become the industry standard, forcing future coins to start innovating rather than trying the same structure of the typical coin we see today: create some bland narrative, start getting KOLs to call it (mad apes, pow etc... people who only want supply) and then proceed to run the coin for a week before leaving it.

You can Kendufy anything. And everything will be Kendufied.

This isn’t really a social event - I have been rewriting this for a few days to post in the main Tampa sub, but even removing all keywords I can think of, it still will not let me and tells me to post here. 

Ok, here’s the deal. My life went weird since the last time I was more active on this account. Like really weird, to the extent that everything I have to say sounds like I’m lying or crazy. If you are one of the many people I met, liked, and ghosted, I really am sorry. 

But, fast forward to now and I’m finally out of a really dark relationship, I have just moved into a new place by myself with my dogs, and I can finally have this surgery on my ankle that I have needed for several years now. 

My surgery is on Thursday, June 12. I did have someone that was planning to take me, but things happen and it isn’t going to work out. So my mom said she was going to drive down. She’s been sick this year and I said I didn’t think it was a good idea. I shit you not, she was taken in for another emergency surgery on Tuesday. She’s still in the hospital. 

I don’t know anybody here really. I had my little brother but he died a few years ago. I’ve lived in the area since 2011 but I never really was allowed to make friends? Not that it was a hard rule. Just the constant barrage of cheating accusations and silent treatment if I dared. It’s my fault that I stood down. 

I was thinking about asking my boss because I trust him, but we are in the middle of chaos at work and I don’t want to put him in a spot that pisses *his* boss off. The last thing either of us needs is to get fired. The fact that I’m going to be remote for a while is already a point of stress. 

Would anyone be able and willing to pick me up and drive me home after my surgery? Like, pretend you know me? I can uber there but they absolutely will not let me uber home. I’ll pay you or smoke you out or feed you, or whatever. I don’t really drink but if alcohol is your thing, tell me ahead of time and I will pay you in beer. You don’t even need to babysit me after (maybe if you’re feeling extra kind, help make sure I get up my porch stairs?). I’ll be ok and will most likely just collapse in bed for a few days with the back door open for my dogs. I don’t know what time yet. It’s with Florida Orthopaedic and the said they will call me the day before to let me know what time to get there. 

I feel a lot more comfortable around women right now, for what it’s worth. I have a lot of fear at the moment. I do not feel safe at all, I am sort of scared that he will find out where I’m living, and posting this feels dangerous. But I need to have this surgery. I couldn’t risk immobilizing myself like this before and I keep injuring it worse and worse every time. Right now it’s pretty much just held together with this brace. I can’t do anything right now. I can’t go to the river, I can’t march and protest…I did just haul an entire house full of shit by myself because I had to. It made it worse lol. 

In case I need a disclaimer: This is not a sex request. I am not interested, regardless of gender. I am not going to date, hook up, send pics, or whatever else in this realm that I might be missing. I don’t want anyone to save me or take care of me or white knight. I am asking *only* for a ride home from the hospital, respectfully. And I don’t really want to talk about my shit, so if that’s ok with you, it would be cool of you to not make me. If not, that’s ok too. I understand curiosity.

Let’s say your foreman makes $800 a week and oversees 3 jobs. That’s roughly $267 per job. But if you tag all $800 to just one, your margin looks way off. You think you made money when you didn’t—or worse, you underbid your next job based on false data.

We bought our house together nearly three years ago, and about a year later, we got engaged and brought home our dog, within the same month.

Overall, things are going really well. We don’t argue, we split chores fairly, and we’ve been enjoying the wedding planning process. But lately, I’ve been feeling a bit disconnected from him, and I’m not sure how to bridge that gap.

We both work full time, and his schedule can be especially demanding. He often works nights or travels for work, so we don’t have a consistent routine together. I think that lack of regular time might be part of the issue.

Another challenge is that we have very different love languages. I am big on physical touch and words of affirmation, while his main love language is acts of service. We’re both aware of this and do our best to meet each other’s needs, but I still often find I still don’t get the physical contact I need to feel emotionally connected. I try to do little things like sort his laundry and make his coffee in the morning, make him lunch, do most of the cleaning etc but I’m definitely open to what else I can do to show love to an acts of service man. 

This also impacts our sex life. When we first got together, his drive was higher than mine. Now it feels like the roles have reversed. We’re rarely intimate, and that’s been hard for me emotionally (I would definitely say I’m anxiously attached so tend to catastrophise)I’ve tried to talk to him about it, and while things improve for a little while, we tend to slip back into the same pattern. It leaves me feeling rejected, which is especially difficult as I’m currently on a weight loss journey. I’ve lost 32 pounds, and while that’s something to be proud of, I’m still struggling with body dysmorphia and confidence. I should also add that when we talk about this issue, he will often say he’s tired or stressed. He works for himself so even when he’s not working, the stress is there of not necessarily knowing when he will be working again. 

What I’m really looking for is advice on how we can reconnect emotionally and physically. We can’t really afford a holiday or regular out of home date nights, and we’re both not always great at expressing our feelings until frustration builds up, so I’d like to get to a point where we’re feeling more connected and aligned.

Seriously—how did things get this bad? Rent prices are straight-up unhinged, wages feel like a joke, and somehow, living in a storage unit isn’t even that shocking anymore.

It’s wild how survival has become the new standard in the USA. Not thriving, not building a future, no American dream —just trying to make it to next month without spiraling. And before anyone hits me with the ‘Well, maybe if you budgeted better,’ or ‘Just cut out the Starbucks!’ nonsense like Dave Ramsey does—please. Be serious. This economy isn’t broken because people buy coffee; it’s broken because the system is rigged against us.

And I try to stay hopeful, but some days it feels impossible. And I know I have it better than many because I have delayed gratification most of my life while managing to care for a parent as well (no kids because that’s just stupid imo if you have a choice and aren’t wealthy … why bring a child into this to potentially suffer too).

1l779on,https://i.redd.it/winlrawe2x5f1.jpeg,Review #9 - Glenmorangie Signet,"After the last couple of reviews, which focused on IBs, I thought about keeping the IB theme going and delve into a couple of other bottles in my collection, but then one of them got reviewed by another member here, and I decided to postpone mine to a later date.  Instead, I’m going to jump back to an OB stalwart, of sorts, which incidentally will take us back to the distillery that first got me into scotch, though not quite the same bottling in their range.

So yes, I’ve been a fan of Glenmorangie for a very long time and while I’m far from having tried every single bottling they make (not even every bottling in their core range), I have enjoyed every one of their expressions that I’ve tried over the years, to varying degrees.  They may not always be “blow-your-mind-amazing”, but they’re always solid offerings, and usually represent good value.  But alas, I have never tried a Signet before. That is, until I noticed that one of my local stores had it on sale a few months back.  I’ve never spent that much on a bottle before, but figured I finally deserved it, because dammit - what’s the point of getting into scotch if you’re going to remain fiscally responsible?  (I really hope my wife isn’t on Reddit, BTW, but if she somehow sees this - I love you sweetie! You look very nice today! Are those new shoes? They look great on you!)

Anyway, I’ve tasted this Signet a handful of times since getting it, pulling it out when I had a reason to celebrate something.  Last couple of times I had it out, including last night, I took some notes while enjoying it so I could share them here. 

The bottle presentation is spectacular.  I don’t usually save the boxes, but couldn’t resist saving this one. The bottle itself is beautifully designed, completely opaque from the top to about the bottom 30-40%, before it gradually transitions to clear. So you won’t know exactly how much of it you drank until it’s time to start thinking about replacing it (which you will probably want to do).  The top of the bottle is also wrapped in a solid metal collar, which seamlessly transitions into the metal cork cap. The cap is very heavy as well (as in, “it’ll cause bodily harm if thrown at you” heavy).  No paper here, labeling is silk-screened right onto the glass.  Everything about this bottle aims to suggest “decadence”, but in a subdued way.  It feels substantial & expensive, while remaining classy.  I don’t drink this one often, and I feel the added touches on the presentation add to the experience on the special occasions when I do pull it out.  Of note, Glenmorangie updated the presentation in 2025, with a different, smaller signet logo and text shifted around.  Also, the metal collar and cap have been changed in shape, color, and texture.  The new look is now used across their now expanded Signet range, first showing up on the even higher-priced Signet Reserve introduced last year, which adds PX casks to the mix.  

**Region:** Highlands

**ABV:** 46%

**Age:** No age statement, but supposedly some of the older Glenmorangie casks are used in the recipe, including some in the 30-40 year range. 

**Coloring:** Yes

**Chill-filtration:** No

**Casks:** Exact details are sparse, but Glenmorangie states that it’s matured in a mix of ex-bourbon, sherry, and virgin oak casks.

**Methodology:**  Neat, rested in a glencairn for 15mins. 

**Nose:**  Prominent, yet soft.  Intense dark chocolate, coffee candy, candied raspberry, candied lemon, very light touch of ginger.  It doesn’t pound you in the face with notes, but you don’t need to go rooting for them. Very well balanced.

**Palate:** Velvety texture.  There’s cocoa powder, coffee turns to mocha, candied fruit are replaced by candied ginger for that touch of spice.  It benefits from staying at 46% here, as I feel a higher ABV might have made the strong notes too intense.

**Finish:**  Very long finish.  Again, very pleasant texture on the way down. Dark chocolate covered espresso beans that stay with you for minutes after taking a sip. 

**Thoughts:** this whisky is less “warm and fuzzy” and more “desserty and sumptuous”. Flavor profile, while heavily weighted towards dark chocolate and coffee, is nevertheless more complex than just those two, with undertones of varied candied fruits and ginger poking through. Much of the unique flavor is due to Glenmorangie’s use  of chocolate malt for the Signet’s distillate, which is traditionally used for brewing darker ales. Very few other whiskies do this (none that I’ve ever tried, anyway).  Despite the unique profile - everything is well balanced and polished, no single flavor is overpowering or overwhelming. The espresso does stay with you for a nice long while after the sip, but it’s a pleasant sensation in the back of your mouth & nose that reminds you of what’s still waiting in the glass. 

**Score:** 90/100

I had absolutely no trouble scoring this one high.  It’s a unique and delicious whisky, but it stays very approachable.  I know I risk repeating those reviewers who came before me, but this really is one of those whiskies that can readily be enjoyed by those new to whiskies as well as those who are more experienced.  There’s plenty of both - easily recognizable and delightful flavors for a beginner and sufficient complexity and subtle texture to keep an enthusiast engaged.  Glenmorangie has a great whisky on their hands here, and they know it, as the price can attest to. I got my bottle on sale, for around USD $220-230, which while not cheap, is not an unreasonable amount for a whisky of similar quality.  I know that some folks lament not having an age statement for the price, but it doesn’t bother me.  Will I replace it when it runs out?  Maybe not “at any cost,” but yes - I’ll start looking for another sale when the bottle gets down to that visible range.  Until then, it'll live a quiet life in the back of my cabinet, as far away from temptation as I can put it.",32,1749481749.0,Scotch,7,0.97,False

**Community, that’s it. There is no special sauce, special tactic or anything. The value of a meme coin is entirely dependant on the strength, reach and power of the community.**

This is why I am so confident that Kendu will reach the tens of billions, on Twitter we routinely compete with coins that have a market cap in the hundreds of millions(whilst Kendu sits at 23 million), we also absolutely dominate everyone on Reddit and we are churning out quality IRL products like never before. Honestly, I cannot stress this enough, no coin past or present has ever reached the IRL heights that Kendu has achieved, we are also doing this when most holders will be in the red, imagine the sheer power when community members have a crazy amount of disposable income to create Kendu products. Kendu really is a multi billion dollar brand larping as a 23 million dollar memecoin.

I’ve owned roombas.

I’ve tried Ecovacs, irobots, random no names.

But 60 days into using the Roborock saros 10r, I’ve reached one weird conclusion:

I don’t think I’m ever going back.

Not because it’s perfect.

But because it solves problems that other smart vacuums straight up ignore.

Here are the 5 things that stood out hard and made it better than everything else I’ve owned.

# It crawls under stuff other vacs give up on

I’ve got this low Ikea couch.

It’s just high enough to trap dust but low enough to trap vacuums.

Saros 10r? Glided under it like a cockroach with a mission.

3.14 inches tall. That’s not marketing fluff. 

That’s ""fit under weird furniture"" real.

Not just the couch—under my sideboard, beneath my bed frame, even the awkward gap under the shoe rack.

It handled all of them without drama.

Other vacs pause, cry, or turn around. This one just goes.

# It actually avoids stupid obstacles

You know what’s fun? Untangling robot vacs from power cables.

You know what’s better? Never needing to.

The Vertibeam detection is the first I’ve used that actually *sees* stuff like wires, pet bowls, socks, chair legs.

The Starsight 2.0 camera system doesn’t just detect walls—it navigates like it’s been here before.

My kitchen has weird bar stools and a rolling cart. The Saros mapped it all, adjusted routes in real-time, and skipped traps.

This was the first time I didn’t have to pre-clean before cleaning.

# Suction is not a joke (it matches my upright vac)

20k Pa.

Numbers don’t mean much until you see it rip pet hair out of rugs your old vac left behind.

I’ve got two shedding beasts. This handled them like it was built in a grooming salon.

My carpeted stairs don’t get cleaned by the robot obviously—but my upstairs rug was getting grimy between upright sessions.

Now I don’t even need to bring the upright out more than once a month.

This thing *replaced* it.

# The mop is real, not a gimmick

Dual spinning mops. Hot water cleaning. Auto mop lift.

Those sound like ad buzzwords. I ignored them.

Then I spilled coffee.

The mops didn’t just drag a wet cloth over it—they *scrubbed.*

I watched it lift the stain in one pass.

And because it lifts when it hits carpet, I don’t worry about soggy floor transitions.

The dock also washes and dries the mop with hot air.

It’s basically self-care for your robot.

# The dock does more work than I do

The 10-in-1 dock isn’t just hype.

It empties the dustbin, washes and dries the mop, refills the water, and dispenses detergent.

I don’t touch the vacuum for weeks.

Literally just open the app, hit a room, and walk away.

No maintenance, no babysitting.

And the app? Surprisingly not annoying. I set no-go zones, schedule specific rooms, even adjust mop pressure.

If you’re after a hands off system that actually vacuums *and* mops correctly, this might be the best thing under $1.5k.

Just make sure you’ve got space for the dock; it’s a bit of a unit.

Here’s the one I bought if you want to check it:[ this exact model](https://amzn.to/3RCb7PS)

*(If you buy through this link, I might earn a small commission, no extra cost to you.)*

I’ll update if anything breaks in the next few months, but for now, it’s winning.

I haven't told you this, but I’ve been carrying the shape of you in the broken puzzle pieces of my heart since long before I had a name or face to attach them to.

Not the fantasy of you. Not an idea of you. Just...you.

The real you.

The woman who second-guesses herself. Who carries the weight of the world, even when she doesn’t have to. Who gives endlessly, not out of obligation, but because she truly wants to. Who doesn’t realize how beautiful and strong she is, because somewhere along the way, someone told her she was “too much.”

But the truth is, you’re exactly what you need to be.

Through everything in my life, the heartbreaks, the loss, the laughter and the healing, I’ve been learning how to love in a way that doesn’t shy away. A kind of love that doesn’t flinch. That doesn’t try to fix what isn’t broken. That stands firm. That holds space. That stays. And I’ve reached a point in my life where I know this for certain: I don’t want to love halfway. I want the silences. The storms. The raw honesty. The emotional intensity. I want you. Unfiltered.

I want the ordinary days. The morning coffee, you in the sunlight, half-smiling, hair a mess but beautiful. The quiet on the couch as we talk about our day. The adventures both large and small. The new memories. The laughter we both didn’t think we’d ever find again.

But I also want the heavy moments. The days when you feel like too much. Because to me you never will be. The days when the world takes more than it gives. Because to me, you’ll always be just the right amount to want. I want to hold you tight when you can’t hold yourself together. To be the arms you fall into when the day breaks you down. To be your comfort, because you are also mine. To know your cracks not so that I can fix them but so that I can learn the places that the light gets in.

This isn’t about rushing. I'm not telling you I love you. Not yet. But I can see that being a future for the two of us. I'm just simply telling you the truth of where I am right now: I’ve made space for someone who happens to be exactly like you. And the more I get to know you…the more pieces of you I find that feel like they fit the missing puzzle pieces of me broken off through the years of life and loss.

So don’t worry about being perfect. To me, you already are. Don’t worry about saying the right thing. I just want you to be you. And if you ever feel that quiet pull, that little voice that wonders: “Could it be that he really sees me? Could he really handle all of my emotional intensity?” I hope you know the answer.

Yes.

I do.

I can.

And I’m here.

Yours,

The result was this, ""Product Graveyard"".

It's completely unmonetized, free to use and I think it's a decent enough MVP to ask you fine people for your feedback.

Dear \[Agent Name\],

I’m excited to send you ARBOREAL (100,000 words), my YA fantasy that will appeal to fans of the sisterhood themes in *House of Hollow* by Krystal Sutherland, set against the lush botanical background of A.B. Poranek’s *Where the Dark Stands Still*. I chose you because of your interest in \[give examples from my book that I think the agent will like – show what’s wonderful about it/what will excite readers\].

Sixteen-year-old Lily is no stranger to rejection; she bears the proud title of having lived at the orphanage the longest. Luckily, she’s had Ysabel with her for most of those years. Ysabel is brave, brash and likes to prank the cruel headmistress—the exact opposite of Lily, who tries to make herself as small as possible to avoid trouble. Still, they’re like sisters…until Ysabel dies in a brutal attack by man-eating monsters known as the Unseeing. 

Alone and looking for solace, Lily puts on a mysterious locket that Ysabel left behind. It magically summons a fae-like creature known as a “Cymph,” who brings Lily to a hidden world *beneath* the one she’s been living in called Sunken Heaven. It’s a jungle realm that’s miraculously safe from the Unseeing. As Lily starts feeling like part of the Cymph family she stays with, her grief becomes a little more manageable.

Until a terrible secret yanks her back to reality. Lily learns that Ysabel’s mother created the Unseeing using the very locket she’s been wearing, after stealing Cymph magic. The Cymphs tell Lily that she’s the one destined to take down the leader of the Unseeing—a fate Lily bravely accepts…until she learns who the leader is.

Ysabel.

Ysabel didn’t die after all, and she’s been brainwashed into controlling the Unseeing in her mother’s place. Lily’s destiny is to kill the leader of the Unseeing…but inside, she still believes her best friend can be redeemed. Lily must choose carefully where her loyalties lie at the risk of losing everything and everyone: her chosen sister *and* her newfound family in Sunken Heaven.

ARBOREAL is the first in a planned series.

Rev. Bailey/Haley/Phone Sex Beezle. Shine. YOLO. Mama. Kaitlyn. Sis. Melissa Mathers. Lovely. BKS Momma. Brit-knee. Peace. Rednecker. Dawn. Trashy Witch, daHOEta, Raegan. Ashly. Aggie. ErinErin. Racist Heather.
And the list goes on.

Every time one of you laughs at his jokes.
Every time you drop a “🥺 poor Wrench.”
Every time you call it “loyalty” instead of enabling.
Every time you gift or feed the bear, you’re enabling.
Every time you Venmo or cash app him food money (but really for beeeaa) or MOtel money, you’re enabling.
You’re not helping — you’re feeding the sickness.

He needs accountability. Not emoji pity parties.

Would you let your child witness that behavior at McDonald’s and just brush it off?
Would you be okay with someone screaming about sex acts over breakfast while you sip your coffee?
Because that’s what you’re defending.
That’s who you’re standing beside.

And Rev?
Don’t think you’re sliding under the radar. Karma’s not just coming — it’s circling the block blasting your old TikToks.
You’ve enabled this filth, built it, protected it, and now? You’re stuck in it.
Vaping her entire fake 🤰🏻 with Baby 🍼🎀PufferElla💨 is down right INCOMPREHENSIBLE 🤬
Splitted or not, you are 100% part of the rot.

This isn’t just messy anymore.
It’s dangerous. Deranged. Delusional.
And if you’re still laughing? You’re part of the problem.

Y’all aren’t fans. You’re not family.
You’re the fumes keeping his toxic behavior burning.

And when the crash comes — and it will —
your names will be right there in the rubble.

1l76qvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1l76qvw/smileco_part_1/,SmileCo. (Part 1),"I’m posting this here because I don’t know where else to go with it. I’ve been sitting on this for days now, going back and forth between thinking I’m overreacting or going crazy and wanting to know more. 
I don’t really have anyone left to tell. Not in the way that matters. I keep thinking about calling someone from the old job, but what would I even say? “Hey, remember that quiet guy from soil sampling? I think I found a town that isn’t supposed to exist.”
No one would believe me. Heck, I’m not even sure I believe me.

So I’m putting it here. Not for karma. Not for fun. Just… to get it out. Somewhere. Anywhere. Maybe one of you has seen something like this. Maybe someone out there remembers Okshita, or SmileCo. Or maybe you know that weird feeling, like the world’s missing a page you were supposed to read.
If you do — let me know.

Allow me to provide some context: I used to work in environmental science.  
It wasn’t glamorous, but it paid decent — just soil and groundwater testing for industrial sites, mostly. I'd spend hours alone in lab rooms running the same instruments over and over again, but I liked it. There was something satisfying about gathering data, about understanding the story hidden in the dirt.
However, they let me go four years ago.
I’m not going to get into the details. Let’s just say I got a personal diagnosis that made management uncomfortable. Not contagious, not terminal. Just... something about being a liability… No matter, I was close to retiring from that company anyways.

I wasn’t quite sure how to fill my empty time, so I began hiking. On a few of my hikes I had come across some old abandoned houses/buildings. This began my fascination with urban exploration. Over these past few years I’ve explored dozens of different abandoned buildings, towns, mines, etc.

Earlier this year I found myself moving into a town not far from a small town in northeastern Oklahoma called Picher — yeah, that Picher. The ghost town that basically collapsed into itself after lead poisoning and sinkholes made it unlivable. It’s a decaying husk now, but for me it’s become a kind of base camp for deeper explorations. I’ve been mapping and recording the weird and quiet places left behind by history, and this was one of my most dangerous mappings as the air and grounds are still somewhat unsafe to traverse through.

But a few weeks ago, I stumbled on something that wasn’t supposed to be there.
I was camping on a logging road not far from the Kansas border, maybe ten miles northwest of Picher. My plan was to hit an old rail station I’d been tipped off about, but sometime around midnight I spotted a rusted metal sign poking out of the brush. No name, just a faded arrow and a number: 13.
Curious, I followed the trail. About an hour later, I found myself at the edge of a town swallowed by trees — buildings choked in vines, power lines dangling like nooses. Roofs partially caved in and a broken welcome sign on the edge of town with no name. 

The first thing I noticed was the silence. Not the kind of quiet you get in rural areas or empty fields, but the heavy, unnatural kind—like the town itself was holding its breath.
The buildings looked like they had been abandoned in a hurry. Doors hung open on rusted hinges, windows were either shattered or covered in layers of grime so thick they looked painted. I passed what had once been a diner—still had the cracked “OPEN” sign fallen in the doorway. Inside, I found plates of mold, a child's shoe was lying under a booth, and broken coffee cups sat on the floor beneath the counter. 

As I explored a couple other buildings I felt watched. I don’t know how to explain it exactly, but the air changed the second I stepped past the townhouse. There was no sound, not even birds. Just that thick, pressing quiet that makes your ears ring. And then — that feeling. Like I wasn’t alone. Like something was standing just behind me, close enough to breathe but refusing to make a sound.
I turned around more times than I care to admit.
Nothing. Always nothing.
But it didn’t go away.
That kind of silence doesn’t feel empty. It feels like something’s holding its breath, just to see what you’ll do next.

Thats when I came across the most interesting part. Hidden in the deepest part of the town, behind what I assumed to be an old library, was an RV.
It was buried halfway in the dirt, like the woods had been trying to eat it for the past decade. Brown and white, late ’80s model. One of the windows was cracked. The door was ajar, hanging open like someone left in a hurry.
I thought maybe it belonged to a squatter or a hunter who never came back. I hesitated, then went to step inside.
Even though the door was ajar, I still had to pull pretty hard to open it fully, it seemed the hinges were stuck on some vines that had grown into the RV. 

Inside the air was stale, thick, like someone had tried to clean something chemical out of it years ago. The floor creaked under my boots. Most of the front had been gutted — cushions torn, wires dangling, a lantern rusted to one side. But in the back, where the bed would’ve been, someone had built a workspace.
A makeshift lab.
Glass jars lined the wall, most empty. A microscope sat crooked on a bolted-down desk. There were scribbled notes taped over the cabinets, diagrams I couldn’t make sense of. And in the corner — a cardboard box. Plain, water-damaged, taped shut. I whipped out my pocket knife and cut the box open, inside was a collection of 4 things. 
* Two hardbound notebooks, cracked and water-stained.
* Five cassette tapes, each labeled with dates and what looked like experiment numbers.
* A few strange rocks — one black and glossy like obsidian, another pale green and flaky, almost like it had veins. Some of the green had been broken up and placed in vials 
* And an old, but intact cassette recorder.
I was curious. I took one of the journals and something wrapped in cloth on the desk back with me to my campsite, and then a couple days later I brought it back home with me. I cracked open one of the notebooks. It was difficult to read at first, but it looked like an experiment log. The first journal was labeled:
""Dr.  — Log #001"" (the name was smudged) 
Here’s a portion of what it said. I’m typing it exactly as written:

Journal EntryDate: March 18, 1997Location: Okshita, OK
I wasn’t planning on writing tonight, but something about the way the samples behaved in the dish has kept my hands restless. Might as well make a record of it while it's fresh.
Earlier this afternoon, one of the foremen — Raul — stopped by the trailer with a small padded case. Said the crew had pulled something new out of Shaft 3, about 200 feet down past the main iron seam. Not uncommon to find odd minerals here and there, but he said this batch ""felt weird.""
Not dangerous. Just... strange.

Inside the case were two specimens. One a deep black, almost blue under the right light. Smooth and heavy, like polished obsidian but somehow matte. The other, a pale green crystal that shimmered slightly along the edges, delicate like mica or glass slivers.
Both were cold.
Not cool — cold. Not in a dry ice, chemical reaction kind of way either. Just... unnaturally chilled. Even after sitting on my desk for hours, they haven't warmed up.

I ran basic tests — no radiation, no unusual off-gassing, no acid reactivity. They appear inert, at least chemically. The green one flakes easily and breaks down under semi-light pressure. The black one is much denser, heavier than its volume suggests. There’s something about it that reminds me of magnetic basalt — but my meters are only picking up a weak magnetic field.

Raul said the guys are calling them “Glassrock” and “Nightstone.” Not scientific names, obviously, but I won’t lie — they fit. I’ll log them as Type A (black) and Type B (green) until we know more.
No urgency yet. No hazards. If anything, they seem almost… clean. Unnaturally so.
I’ll prep a small test batch tonight, dissolve traces into distilled water and run conductivity and bio tests in the morning. 

Not expecting much — probably just another shiny distraction that’ll go nowhere.
But I’ll admit — I haven’t stopped touching the Type B sample. Just running it between my fingers absentmindedly while I write.
It’s strangely calming. Like holding a smooth river stone that’s never been in a river.
Might be nothing. Probably is.
Still — I want to see what it does when mixed.
— Dr. A. M.

I haven’t read any of the other entries yet. I will, I have to. I decided to unwrap the thing in cloth I had taken too. When I opened it up it was a soda bottle, like one of those old Coke ones you’d see the polar bears drinking in those commercials. It was untouched by dust and across the middle was a washed-out light blue label with a cartoonish bottle cap mascot smiling. The label read in yellow letters: SmileCo™ - Original Blend.

As I was turning the bottle in my hands, I swear — just for a second — I felt warmth.
It was subtle, but unmistakable. The glass had been cold as ice, but then… it wasn’t. It was body temperature. Almost like someone else had just been holding it.
I froze, then held it up to the light. No residue, no finger prints. But as I tilted it, something inside moved. I hadn’t noticed it earlier — it was thick, dark. Not syrupy like soda. More like ink.
I gave it a gentle shake, and the liquid barely sloshed, almost congealed. That’s when I saw it, bubbles.
Tiny ones, rising slowly to the top, where they popped inward. Not outward — like pressure escaping — but like the liquid was pulling in on itself.
I set it down.
And this part... maybe I was just jumpy. Maybe I imagined it. But the second I walked away, I swear I heard a faint hiss from the bottle — like carbonation escaping, or… something breathing.
When I turned around, it had stopped. But I swear, I swear that little cartoon bottle cap was smiling wider. 

Later that night I looked up the town mentioned in the journal — “Okshita, Oklahoma.” Nothing. Not a map pin. Not a population stat. Not even an old census record.
Then I searched the name on the bottle — SmileCo™. Still nothing. No trademark filings, no defunct business listings, no half-finished web pages archived from the early internet.
Just… blank space.
That’s what gets under my skin the most. These days, everything leaves a footprint — even ghost towns, even companies that went belly-up decades ago. But this?
It’s like someone scraped it clean. Like it was never meant to be remembered.

I thought I could walk away from this.
Weird minerals, an erased town, a bottle full of congealed soda. It was all strange, sure — unnerving — but I figured I’d catalog it, maybe dig a little deeper, and move on like I always do. Just another curiosity for the shelf.
But then last week, something changed.
I was driving through the outskirts of town — the newer part, where they’ve been trying to redevelop the old industrial lots — and I saw construction crews working late. No signs, no logo, just chain-link fencing and temporary floodlights.

The next morning, there was a sign.
Not big. Not flashy. Just a white board with black stenciled letters.
“SmileCo Processing Center.”
 Just the name was enough to send shivers down my spine.
It wasn’t the kind of name I could forget. And when I went back that night, the sign was gone.
I asked around my town — no one had heard of SmileCo. But the lot’s still fenced off. Still guarded. Still growing.
So I’m writing this now because I think something’s happening again. Not just in that dead town in the woods — but here In my town.
I’m starting to think SmileCo was ever really gone.I think it was waiting.

I’m packing my camping bag with essentials, (flashlight, batteries, food, water, etc.) I’m going back to that town tomorrow. I’ll keep you posted.

I remember loving every sentence in that book- the author just gets me 
lol
I wanted to explore more of SK but got lost in life
College and then work


I resigned from my first job and found Fairy Tale in the book section of Target. It took me ~two weeks to finish and I wish it took longer. I wanted to absorb every word, every punctuation. 
I remembered my 17 y.o. Days and how I wanted to be a reader as an “adult” (idt I’ll ever be an adult) I was not raised to be a reader. I was raised to be a hustler: just school and work without any appreciation for the arts. 

Recently went on vacation and I’m about to finish The Green Mile after starting it last week. I haven’t watched the movie and I’m very happy about that. I love going into books blind. 
I got a little upset bc while I was reading it, my brother said “isn’t that about the guy who ….. (not saying what he said in case you’re just like me)” 

Immediately after, I read the part he described and my heart sank lmao I love going :0 wtfwtfwtfwhyywhattthowww

Anyway I’m ranting but like I said I am not much of a reader. I read a lot in nursing school out of necessity and that’s about it. I read books for leisure maybe 2x a year if it really catches my attention (Alex lickerman’s the undefeated mind and before the coffee gets cold last year were the two)

I ordered the first four books of the dark tower series. I thought I might be getting ahead of myself…
I’ve been following this thread since fairy tale and TDT propaganda has gotten to me. I can really feel people’s strong feelings through their posts and I’m hoping I become one of them/you. SK’s writing doesn’t just capture my attention- it transports me into the story as if I am one of the characters

She is Australian and apparently ran into another guy who is from Australia while his and my son were playing near each other (not with each other). They got to talking and the way she described it, he said he is married, his kids are 5 and 6 (mine is 9), and they should get together for a play date. Somewhere in this she said he also said they should grab coffee and she gave him her number. 

She didn’t tell the story in order of events, mentioned the kids ages later, so it sounded like she gave him her number before that was established. Considering how much younger they are, I’m not sure why a play date would be needed. 

She then said we should make more friends but we go to temple and have access to a variety of places where she’s never tried to establish friends before.

My brothers have it, my mom's prediabetic, my dad has it, my grandma had it, all my uncles have it- even my Uncle John who has biked 20 miles a day for decades. 

It's not an ""if"" for me, it's a ""when"". 

I'm almost 28 and I haven't drank soda since 2014. I don't buy candy often cause it will cause rebound hypoglycemia. So I always have to eat some with protein. All my coffees are sugar free. 

I'm obsessed with my health.... well according to my ex boyfriend anyway. 

Both of my parents have rotted their teeth out, ignored health issues, smoke like chimneys. How could I not want to try to be better when I watched them suffer?

I can't eat gluten either. That means no bread, cake, breaded foods- most fast food places. 

And somehow I am still fat. 

I don't think fat is a bad thing. But I don't want to be fat. It's harder to find cute clothes. People treat you differently. Being bigger means biologically I'm at risk of diabetes which is something I'm trying to prevent. Most doctors blame everything on weight. ""Oh you have cripplingly migraines 3-4 times a week? You should lose some weight."" Everyone thinks you're a liar. ""Oh you can't lose weight even when you workout, don't eat sugar, and don't eat much? Maybe you're not working out hard enough."" I also look like my mother. And I don't want to look like her. 

Some people are beautiful while fat- I am not one of those. It's all disproportionately in my hips, ass and thighs. It's horrid trying to find a pair of jeans that fit well. 

I don't hate my body, I'm just frustrated with it. Not just with how it looks, but how it operates. 

My doctor doesn't want me to cut out dairy. She is concerned that I'm cutting out too much. But I'm willing to do anything to FEEL better. 

She thinks I have insulin resistance from my PCOS. Makes sense. 

Last year I was 245. I ate on average 800 cals a day. I hadn't had a period in 2 years and when I finally did, I bled for 3 months. 

So I started birth control to help with my PCOS symptoms. Then I cut out gluten and EVERYTHING got so much better. My bowel movements, my skin, the way I felt. I started to push for 1800 cals a day. I lost 20 pounds after that. 

I'm now 228. I've been hovering at 230 since last October. 

A few years ago they figured out that I'm vitamin B12, vitamin D, and iron deficient. My doctor only said "" The fatigue trifecta -no wonder you're so tired"". 

My iron deficiency was so bad that I was decently anemic. For two years I ate kale just about everyday in my eggs. I prioritized red meats and took iron supplements. My body wouldn't absorb it. 

It got bad enough that it started to affect my hemoglobin. So I had 2 iron infusions this year. Life changing really. I'm almost MAD at how good it feels. Like- everyone just casually feels this way? Has this much energy? I work at a hospital so I get steps in- 7.5-10k from work alone on average. I would force myself to workout only to have heart palpitations and anxiety post workout AND gain 5 pounds from it. 

Now I can go for a mile stroll after work without feeling anxious or ill. 

I've made progress even if it doesn't feel like it. Each step has been a battle. I had anxiety about taking birth control, about taking iron supplements and infusions, about eating 1800 cals a day, about how to eat without gluten...

My doctor recommended insitol. A supplement to help support hormone health and help with insulin sensitivity. I've had the container for a year, unopened. Another anxious battle. 

Will it help? Will I get headaches from it? Will it fuck up my guts? Will it do absolutely nothing and be a huge waste of time, energy, and hope? 

I hear good things. That it helps women ovulate- which is the issue with PCOS. That it helps insulin sensitivity which can aid in weight loss. 

I finally cracked it opened today and took it. 

A step closer, I won this battle today. ",2,1749480420.0,DiaryOfARedditor,1,1.0,False

We went on Friday and Sunday bc Saturday tickets were sold out and it seems like it was for the best bc of the rain delay. 

On Friday the heat was pretty intense and we arrived at 2pm which was kinda early. By the time Tyler the Creator came on we were so tired we left early. On Sunday we arrived much later around 4pm and stayed until close. 

⭐️ Sponsor activities: 8/10 

We loved the sponsor booths with activities, though I found it kind of weird that many of them had the same activity which was a claw machine- my only critique is that I wish there was more variety there. 

The free Dunkin iced coffee, Cabot grilled cheese, coke and slurpee were great. I loved the 711 and Coca Cola professional photo shoots! So cute. 

The Rakuten arcade was also a lot of fun. We also liked the Hot ones tasting inside the Stella booth - but omg it was way too hot and burned my mouth.

⭐️ artists: 10/10

We love love loved Mt Joy and Hozier - just awesome vibes. Hozier was also so amazing to speak out about peace and politics - and hold up the pride flag at the end of show! He said he was sick but I couldn’t tell at all. So lovely. 

On Friday, t pain went crazy with all kinds of costumes, dancing, mashups, and more - the whole set kept us guessing. The one guy in the front of the crowd dancing like crazy had me cracking up. They kept showing him on the TV. I was screaming laughing when I found the video on TikTok. 

My surprise favorite was Benson Boone because we went just to see since we only know one song but he blew me away and I was in awe of his incredible vocals, emotional lyrics and backflips!! Amazing. My partner loves Japanese House - and I really enjoyed their show too. Tyla was super sexy and great music to dance to! 

⭐️ Food: 8/10 

I was really amazed by the variety of food of all nationalities and as someone with a sweet tooth I loved that they had a section specifically for desserts. I haven’t seen that at a festival before! 

During our two days, We got a burger from Gotham, pizza (forget the vendor), a chicken sandwich from an Asian vendor (forget the name), the potato on the stick (sooooooo yummy), matcha ice cream and an ice cream sandwich. Everything was delicious! 

My only critique is the exploitative prices. I get it’s New York and they’re trying to get their bag, but come on. 11$ for a tiny baby scoop of ice cream is cruel. 

⭐️ drinks: 9/10 

Girl those drinks were overpriced too but they were strong af! We got our moneys worth. I got a lemonade cocktail at the regular bar and a ruby tangerine cocktail at Waterloo. Both very tasty and got the job done. My partner enjoyed the Stella too but 20$ for a singular can is kinda insane. 

⭐️ The crowd: 7/10 

I’m 28… and I wasn’t shocked to see hoards of wealthy teenagers from Long Island and west Chester. It’s super common for there to be teens from the Chicago suburbs at Lollapalooza too. The teens weren’t too badly behaved for the most part, but they did want to record literally everything and there was this weird vibe of like having to take the perfect photo in front of the concert stage DURING the concert which was really disruptive. Like Benson Boone was doing a backflip and they just turned around and struck a pose for a photo. I was like “kids, turn around and listen to the music!” Experience it. Don’t just consume it for content. 

I saw some middle aged people there too, and also some middle schoolers with adult chaperons and even babies. Why you would bring a baby or toddler, I have no idea, but good for them sitting there in their stroller with their sound proof headphones… I guess… 

⭐️ entry and exit: 9/10 

Now I heard it was a shit show on Saturday with the delay and there was a 2 hour line… which sucks. But Friday and Sunday were easy access both in and out - we didn’t wait more than 5 minutes to get inside. Just a little chaotic after hozier with a big crowd leaving but we all got safely to the 7 train. 

⭐️ security: 1/10 

Throwing out vapes? Come on now. That’s 20-30$ in the trash brother. My partners vape got thrown out on Friday and so on Sunday we hid it inside my bag inside a package of tissues.

We got our edibles in both days just simply keeping them in our pockets. I also brought in alcohol on Sunday just in spite of them, kept the little shot bottle in my bra LMAO. 

Overall Score: 9/10 

I would definitely come back if the lineup is to my liking. I think doing just one day might be better - bc we were tireddddd. Also, seems like ther weather was a huge component. I’m sad to have missed Conan and Olivia but I’ve seen them both before and love them.

Also Conan jumping out and kissing Role Model was crazy - I wish I had experienced that in person. ",8,1749480273.0,governorsball,2,0.9,False

My word is ""**refuge**"".

I remember the scene clearly. It was more than six months after our messy break-up. I had been working on my thesis in the library after dropping off a box of her belongings at her dorm. She knew I would be in the library. She knew me pretty well. We talked awkwardly in hushed tones, and I asked if she wanted to grab a coffee, for old time's sake.

We sat across each other in the once-familiar donut shop, stumbling over words to say. I wanted to ask her so many things. She broke the silence when she said, ""You know, you were my refuge."" And she narrated a story about a lost girl who needed someone to anchor herself, to keep herself from drowning. I listened and smiled, thinking I'd do her one last kindness of letting her think I believed her.

But I knew the truth. You don't burn down your refuge when you leave. That's what you do to prisons.

Now, whenever I hear the word ""refuge"", I think of her.

  Parked at the pier while a little pricy was very convenient. Got Faster to the Fun because it’s NYC and I heard mixed reviews about the process so why not. Was onboard eating lunch on lido by 1130. I was under the impression that our room would be ready early since we have FTTF but no. We had to wait till 1:30.
 The ship itself is beautiful we were very impressed. Loved the smart elevators the whole trip I hope one day carnival rolls that out fleet wide. Ate at the steakhouse the first night and was excellent and got a free bottle of wine.

 Everything runs off the app. So download it. You need it to see dining room menus and book sea day brunch, dining room breakfast and debarkation times and just see what’s going on around the ship . They don’t give you physical menus.Service in the dining room was hit or miss. We usually drink more than one cup of coffee at breakfast and was never offered a refill. At dinner time we were never asked if we wanted something to drink (they did give us water)  and the bar servers never came by the table to ask. Then for dessert we were never offered coffee we had to ask for it.

 We avoided the buffet areas peak times because it was a zoo. Long lines for the buffet, Tomodoros and Guys, I definitely recommend having late lunch. We had early dining because of a lot of the negative reviews about wait times for anytime dining.

  The ship has a lot of temperature issues as other reviews have stated a lot of warm areas. Lido crowding wasn’t too bad and the pools weren’t overly packed. The hot tubs were a different story. It rained on our last sea day so having the retractable roof for lido was nice. Although we were in our room by 10pm every night since traveling with kids the crowds were well behaved throughout the ship.
  A tip I have for debarkation morning is if your having breakfast in the dining room it says it opens at 630 but reservations opened up at 6:15. When we were leaving there was a lot of people waiting.
 We carried our luggage off and was pulling out of the parking lot by 8ish.
  
Overall it was a good trip and would sail the Venezia again just being mindful of the crowds and get to shows and comedy club at least 30 min early.Thanks for reading.",8,1749480110.0,CarnivalCruiseFans,2,0.84,False

What caught my attention was how the girls have to message first, which honestly took some pressure off. I matched with a few people during my first week, and one convo even turned into a coffee date. It didn’t go anywhere romantic, but it was still a chill meetup.

One thing I noticed, there’s definitely a different vibe on Bumble. People seem a bit more upfront about what they want, and I didn’t get hit with the usual ghosting as much. The profile prompts help too, like it’s easier to find something to talk about. I still ran into some dry chats and people who clearly weren’t active, but that’s every app I guess.

Compared to others, I think Bumble feels a bit more balanced. Not perfect, but for someone who’s tired of endless swiping with no replies, it’s a decent change. Anyone else using it this year?

1l76eq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1l76eq5/nothing_can_be_built_without_jehovah/,"""Nothing can be built without Jehovah""","So I went to that dedication after all, I was curious as to how it changed from a 20-30 minute event to a 4 hour meeting. I didn't record the meeting because it wasn't in English, but it was definitely different from how I remember - not in a good way.

I arrived around the time it was suppose to begin. I tried to sit in the backroom, but there was resistance. Brothers were standing back there encouraging people to look in the front for seats, I did pretend to take a look, but came back and said there weren't any. After getting back there I saw there was coffee and snacks and it seems like most people sitting back there were LDC members, no wonder they didn't want me there.

So, there were 3-4 separate parts. The first part was about 20 minutes, it was dedicated to the history of JWs in the ""area"". This was a very loosely defined area though because they eventually included all activity within 2-3 separate counties to arrive at the conclusion JWs had been active, sort of, for 40 years in the area.

They interviewed one old lady who had been preaching in the area for most of that time and showed a couple pictures through the years. The next part was 30 minutes or so and was about the project itself. They interviewed 3 LDC brothers and showed a video of some locals, but didn't interview any local who worked on the project. The 3 brothers who were interviewed were relatively young. The oldest was around 30 it seems. The interviewer asked them all the same question ""what concerns did you have about the project and how did you control them?"". One brother mentioned he had health issues throughout the process but every time he wanted to give up he would start to feel better, very bland, possibly true, good for him.

The other two brothers were interesting to me, I chuckled a couple times during their interview which was not well-received in the back, probably because they were all friends. The two brothers both said that they thought that the project would not succeed, they cited inexperience, and delays being proof of the project not having Jehovah's blessing. The first one said that he was losing his faith in the project because a certain permit had not been granted yet and this meant they couldn't proceed with a certain phase of the project. He said that this was in spite of him constantly calling and asking for an update on the status of the permit or whatever it was that was needed. All the, employee I guess, would tell him was that it hadn't been processed yet. Based on this happening he decided to give up, well before doing so, he had one last thing to try - prayer. Yes, he said he wanted to test Jehovah and if he truly wanted this project to succeed, then the permit would come. After putting forth this challenge to Jehovah in prayer, the permit came through. He said ""some time later"" but didn't specify how much time passed. This taught him that Jehovah was actually with him the whole time. 

The second brother lost faith in the project because they were lacking in expertise in a specific area. Unfortunately, I forgot what skill they said they lacked, but it seems like it wasn't a design phase skill but something that came up during the actual construction. Not having anyone with this particular skill to him was evidence that Jehovah was not blessing the project and the building would not be built. However, after making some calls, reaching out to different LDC related brothers, he found one who said he happened to have the skill that they needed, because that was the work he did before (I'm not sure if the brother was retired or not but it was implied that he was older). This wasn't the only thing that made him realize Jehovah was with them though, it was also the brother volunteering to help any time during a specific week that he was asked to. They weren't sure when they would need him, but told the brother it could be Monday-Friday of such and such a week, the brother said that he would keep his schedule open and wham, that shocked him to his very core. So he learned, Jehovah was wih him and wanted the project to succeed after all. 

After the interviews were over, there was a watchtower study, no need to go into it since people have been talking about it here already. I did think it was interesting that good JWs will not take care of their parents and instead pioneer, when I was younger, the literature seemed to tell people to take care of their parents even if that meant that they couldn't be a missionary or whatever anymore. How times change.

The final talk was by a head honcho of LDC. He gave a talk on Hebews 10:11 and honestly it was a bunch of rambling. He mentioned like...all the building projects mentioned in the bible...and the annointed. He even mentioned Abraham being annoying (as mentioned in the broadcast for this month) but I'm not sure what the point of that was. I think it was something about perserverance or somehting. He did mention that this project was special because other projects had paid workers doing the bulk of the work but this was the first LDC project in the country where only volunteers were used and LDC handled everything by themselves. He was sure to mention that kingdom halls are only holy while in use and even the temple wasn't holy when not in use (this was tied to the destruction of the temple and subsquent rebuilding later on). 

Something that I thought was particularly interesting is that this kingdom hall was built in a flood plain. Initially the kingdom hall was designed with two floors, but after LDC was invented and the land was turned over to the branch, the branch rejected the two floor plan. Although it was a safety feature, the first floor being a parking garage and the second floor being where the meeting would be held, it was deemed to expensive for the branch and it's not a one floor kingdom hall in a flood plain. It was kind of implied that the locals shouldn't be greedy because it's ""world wide"" funding and other halls need to be built as well.

The speaker mentioned something else that again caused me to cackle out loud, causing a bit of a scene again. He said ""no building can be completed without Jehovah"". So, all the buildings in the world have Jehovah's blessing. Concentration camps? Jehovah. Bomb factories? Jehovah. That orhpanage that lost funding and was never built? Jehovah.

I didn't know that the meeting wasn't supposed to be 4 hours long, but a sister in attendance left early. A brother made a comment to her as she was leaving and she made a loud comment about how she had to catch her ride, that the talk was supposed to end 30 minutes earlier - as per their schedule. So, apparently the 1.5 hour talk was just him riffing off of his own high or something. I heard quite a few complaints as I left and there was a mad dash from about 30% in attendance to leave right after the final prayer.

Oh yes, there were 3 prayers and 3 songs. I actually recognized some of the people there as it turns out. A couple were in construction, one was a general contractor, there was an electrician, etc. I found it funny then, when the LDC brothers were talking about how there wasn't a lot of experience when I knew at least one brother there constructed homes for a living. I get that houses aren't quite the same as kingdom halls but surely if they had just consulted local brothers, they would have had an easier time (they kept mentioning how it was all Jehovah and a ""bit"" of help from the local friends). 

Ah yes, and the prayer was different. This brother with permed hair came up and shouted ""holy and pure Jehovah"" three times before starting the prayer. Obviously, I'm sure this isn't normal, but it just seemed very over the top, in an already over the top ceremony. ",7,1749479689.0,exjw,7,0.89,False

My cat loves freshly opened dry food. Even the one he doesn't love that much the next day. The day I opened it is the best treat.

I know there are some vacuum storage boxes for cat food. But you still keep opening the box and letting air in every day.

Shouldn't there be some device like there is for boxed wine and coffee (I think) that you would stick at the bottom of a dry food package, like a tap, letting you take out just a small quantity, while maintaining the rest away from air contact. Is this so unhear of?

# Best Backwashable 5 Micron Filter 2025: Top Reviews

Teh backwashable 5 micron filter is a crucial component for ensuring clean and safe water in residential, commercial, and industrial settings. These filters are designed to remove sediment, rust, and other particulate matter down to 5 microns in size, providing a considerable enhancement in water quality. Choosing the right filter is essential for protecting plumbing systems, appliances, and, most importantly, the health of the people consuming the water. With advancements in filtration technology, the market offers a variety of backwashable 5 micron filters, each promising optimal performance and longevity.

This article provides a comprehensive review of the top backwashable 5 micron filters available in 2025, highlighting thier key features, benefits, ideal user profiles, and comparisons to help consumers make informed decisions. We'll delve into the technical specifications, practical advantages, and address common concerns to provide a balanced perspective on each product.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a backwashable 5 micron filter depends on several critical features. Selecting the right filter involves understanding these technical specifications and how they contribute to overall performance.

**Filtration Efficiency:**
The primary function of a 5 micron filter is to remove particles larger than 5 microns.This degree of filtration efficiently captures sediment, rust, sand, and other debris, ensuring cleaner water. A filter's efficiency rating indicates how well it removes these particles, with higher percentages signifying better performance. The best filters consistently achieve high removal rates, even under varying water pressures and flow rates.**Flow rate:**
Flow rate refers to the volume of water that can pass through the filter per unit of time, usually measured in gallons per minute (GPM). A higher flow rate is desirable as it ensures an adequate water supply without significant pressure drops. It is crucial to select a filter with a flow rate that matches the household's water consumption needs. Filters with insufficient flow rates can cause noticeable reductions in water pressure, which can be bothersome when showering or running multiple appliances simultaneously.

**Backwash Cycle:**
Backwashing is a self-cleaning process where the flow of water is reversed through the filter to flush out accumulated sediment and debris. The frequency and duration of the backwash cycle are essential factors affecting filter performance and lifespan. A well-designed backwash system minimizes water waste while efficiently cleaning the filter media.Automatic backwash cycles can be programmed for convenience, while manual systems require periodic user intervention.

**Filter Media:**
The filter media is the material responsible for trapping particulate matter. Common filter media include pleated filters,spun-bound filters,and granular media such as sand or anthracite. Pleated filters offer a large surface area for capturing sediment and are commonly used in backwashable systems. Spun-bound filters are typically more economical but may require more frequent replacement. The selection of media should align with water source conditions and desired filtration performance.

**Housing Material:**
The filter housing is the container that holds the filter media and connects to the plumbing system. Durable housing material is critical for long-term reliability and resistance to pressure fluctuations, corrosion, and UV exposure. Common housing materials include stainless steel, reinforced polymers, and fiberglass. Stainless steel housings are known for their strength and longevity but can be more expensive. Polymer housings offer good resistance to chemical degradation and are generally more cost-effective.

**automatic vs. Manual Backwash:**
Backwashable filters come in two primary designs: automatic and manual. Automatic backwash systems regulate backwashing using a timer and valve system, conducting cycles without any user intervention. Manual systems require homeowners to perform the backwash sequence, usually by moving a lever or turning a series of valves.Automatic backwash systems offer ease, while manual systems allow for adjustments tailored to unique water conditions.

## Core Benefits

Using a backwashable 5 micron filter provides several important benefits. By removing sediment and other impurities, these filters enhance water quality, protect plumbing, and improve the functionality of appliances.**Extended Appliance Lifespan:**
Sediment and scale buildup can dramatically shorten the life of water-using appliances like washing machines, dishwashers, and water heaters. by removing these impurities, a 5 micron filter helps prevent corrosion and damage, extending the lifespan of costly appliances. A filter can safeguard the home's water infrastructure and avoid expensive, premature replacements.

**Improved Water Quality:**
A 5 micron filter significantly improves the taste, odor, and clarity of water. Removing sediment and rust makes water more appealing for drinking, cooking, and bathing. A filter guarantees that tap water suits a wide array of uses,boosting daily life satisfaction.

**Reduced Plumbing Issues:**
Sediment accumulation in pipes can lead to clogs, reduced water pressure, and even damage to plumbing fixtures.A backwashable 5 micron filter helps prevent these problems by removing sediment before it enters the plumbing system. This can result in fewer plumbing repairs and lower overall maintenance costs. Regularly backwashing the filter ensures consistent water flow and pressure throughout the home.

**Lower Energy Costs:**
When sediment builds up in water heaters, it insulates the water from the heating element, forcing the heater to work harder and consume more energy. By removing sediment, a 5 micron filter helps water heaters operate more efficiently, reducing energy consumption and lowering utility bills. This is notably beneficial for households with hard water or high sediment levels.

**Reduced Costs of Bottled Water:**
Cleaner tap water can greatly diminish the need to purchase bottled water for drinking. By supplying high-quality filtered water straight from the tap, a backwashable 5 micron filter can save a family hundreds of dollars annually on bottled water costs. This financial benefit, compounded with the environmental advantage of decreasing plastic waste, underscores the worth of installing a superior filtration framework.## FAQs Section

Addressing common consumer questions is essential for making an informed purchasing decision. Here are some answers to frequent inquiries about backwashable 5 micron filters.

**How often should I backwash my 5 micron filter?**
The frequency of backwashing depends on water quality and usage. Generally, backwashing should be performed every 1-4 weeks. Households with higher sediment levels may require more frequent backwashing. Automatic backwash systems can be programmed to backwash according to a set schedule, while manual systems require the user to monitor water pressure and clarity to determine when backwashing is needed.

**Can a 5 micron filter remove bacteria or viruses?**
No, a 5 micron filter is not designed to remove bacteria or viruses. It primarily targets particulate matter such as sediment, rust, and sand. For the removal of bacteria and viruses, a more sophisticated filtration system, such as an ultraviolet (UV) sterilizer or a reverse osmosis (RO) system, is required. These systems use different mechanisms to disinfect water and eliminate microbiological contaminants.

**what happens if I don't backwash my filter regularly?**
Neglecting to backwash the filter regularly can lead to a buildup of sediment, reducing water pressure and filtration efficiency. over time, this can cause the filter to become clogged and ineffective. In severe cases,the filter media may become permanently damaged,requiring replacement. Regular backwashing ensures optimal performance and extends the lifespan of the filter.

**How long does a backwashable 5 micron filter last?**
the lifespan of a backwashable 5 micron filter depends on several factors, including water quality, usage, and maintenance.A well-maintained filter can last for several years. However,the filter media may need to be replaced periodically,especially in areas with high sediment levels. Regularly inspecting the filter and following the manufacturer's recommendations for maintenance can help extend its lifespan.## Competitor Comparison

* In 1944, Pfc. Spicely, in uniform and unarmed, was shot and killed by a Durham bus driver just three blocks east of Watts Hospital, after a brief exchange in which Spicely protested the segregated seating on the bus. The Pfc. Booker T.

[**James Keul ""A Painter's Life""**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/opening-reception-james-keul-a-painters-life-2/) at **Craven Allen Gallery**  


* James Keul’s new show, A Painter’s Life, examines our connection to nature. Keul is an accomplished artist who has taught painting around the world, working in a variety of mediums to develop the deft, painterly technique seen in his work.
* The exhibition includes a selection of plein air works from his native North Carolina and abroad, as well as large-scale paintings which explore the impact humans are having on the natural world. In these paintings, Keul includes figures, both adults and children, to invite us to consider how our actions will impact future generations.
* Keul values art not only for its own sake, but also as a meditative practice which has guided his life. “Having had an unconventional adolescence, flying back and forth between parents and coasts, and being sent, at age 16, to a therapeutic boarding school in Western Samoa, art has been true north on my life’s compass, helping to guide me through some turbulent events and teaching me the value of patience, perseverance, and humility” he says.
* Keul’s work can be found in important public and private collections around the world. As an educator committed to empowering the next generation of artists, he will be teaching a group of Savannah College of Art and Design students at their campus in Lacoste, France this summer.
* May 17-June 21

[**Art Exhibit — Cannupa Hanska Luger: Speechless**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/art-exhibit-by-dawns-early-light-2/) at **Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University**  


* “Cannupa Hanska Luger: Speechless” explores and amplifies the problematic colonial history and the concept of cargo cults from an Indigenous perspective. Cargo cults developed as a result of Western military campaigns that sent crated, often airdropped, supplies to foreign lands inhabited by Indigenous peoples. This exhibition features several momentual works by the artist, including a large-scale radio made from pine trees titled “The Keep”, three of the artists' “Transportable Intergenerational Protective infrastructure (TIPI)” works, an immersive video, a series of speaker towers, and a group of Native Americans bustles, a traditional part of Native American Powwow regalia.

1l767rt,https://www.reddit.com/r/NomadicLifestyleGlobe/comments/1l767rt/can_digital_nomads_work_in_australia_nomadic/,Can Digital Nomads Work in Australia? Nomadic Lifestyle Guide,"*🚀 Curious about your earning potential as a digital nomad? [Diagnose Your Digital Nomad Income Potential in Under 90 seconds—free tool here!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### The Digital Nomad Dream: Why Australia?
Picture this: endless beaches, sun that kisses your skin, Wi-Fi that (usually) doesn’t betray you. Australia seduces digital nomads with its siren song—a place where your laptop is your passport and the ocean is your office. But is the dream as easy as booking a flight and firing up Zoom?

#### Australia: A Digital Nomad Magnet
There’s a reason the Land Down Under is a magnet for the world’s remote workers. It’s not just the kangaroos and the flat whites. It’s the promise of adventure, the lure of world-class cities, and a culture that worships work-life balance. The catch? The rules are trickier than a riptide.

*🌏 Ready to unlock your digital nomad income? [Take the 90-second assessment now!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Legal Realities: Can You Actually Work Here?
Here’s the inconvenient truth: Australia doesn’t have a digital nomad visa. Working remotely while on a tourist visa? Technically, it’s a gray area—one that could get you booted faster than you can say “G’day.” The government’s stance is clear: tourist visas are for tourists, not for earning income—even if your clients are oceans away.

#### Visa Roulette: What’s Your Ticket In?
Visa roulette is real. Many nomads flirt with the tourist visa, seduced by its simplicity. But the risk? Getting caught can mean deportation and a ban. The Working Holiday Visa is gold for the under-35 crowd, granting a year of legal work—and yes, remote gigs count. For the rest, niche options like the Subclass 408 (Temporary Activity) or 482 (Temporary Skill Shortage) exist, but they’re not designed for the average laptop warrior.

#### Tourist Visa Temptations—and the Risks
Tempted to wing it on a tourist visa? Don’t. Immigration officers aren’t known for their sense of humor. If you’re caught working—even for a foreign employer—you could face a swift exit and a black mark on your record.

*💡 Wondering how much you could earn as a digital nomad? [Find out instantly with this free tool!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Working Holiday Visa: The Golden Ticket?
If you’re between 18 and 35, the Working Holiday Visa is your backstage pass. It’s flexible, it’s legal, and it lets you work for any employer—including yourself. But it’s a one-time deal, and age isn’t just a number here.

#### Subclass 408 and 482: Niche Pathways for the Bold
For the bold and the specialized, Subclass 408 (for temporary activities) and 482 (for skilled workers) offer legal pathways. But they’re more labyrinth than express lane—think sponsorships, paperwork, and a love affair with bureaucracy.

#### Tax Traps and Financial Minefields
Think you can dodge the taxman? Think again. If you’re in Australia for more than six months, you might be a resident for tax purposes. That means declaring your global income. Double taxation treaties help, but paperwork is a minefield. One wrong step, and your bank account feels the pain.

#### Are You a Resident for Tax Purposes?
Stay more than 183 days? The tax office may claim you as their own. Residency isn’t just about where you sleep—it’s about intent, ties, and sometimes, the whims of a tax auditor.

*✈️ Want to know your digital nomad earning power? [Get your personalized report in 90 seconds!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Double Taxation: The Silent Income Killer
Double taxation is the silent killer of nomad dreams. Australia has treaties with many countries, but not all. Miss the fine print, and you could pay tax twice on the same dollar.

#### Finding Your Place: Where Do Digital Nomads Flock?
Sydney’s skyline. Melbourne’s laneways. Byron Bay’s barefoot boardrooms. Digital nomads cluster where the Wi-Fi is strong and the coffee is stronger. Each city has its own flavor—and its own price tag.

#### Sydney: The Concrete Jungle with a View
Sydney is a paradox: skyscrapers and surf. It’s expensive, it’s bustling, and it’s where ambition meets ocean spray. If you crave big city energy with a side of Bondi, this is your playground.

#### Melbourne: The Caffeine-Fueled Creative Hub
Melbourne is for the creatives, the coders, the caffeine addicts. It’s a city that never sleeps—unless it’s brunch time. The culture is as rich as the espresso, and the coworking spaces are legendary.

*🌟 Curious if you’re leaving money on the table? [Diagnose your digital nomad income now!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Byron Bay: Hippie Haven for the Wi-Fi Tribe
Byron Bay is where deadlines meet drum circles. It’s laid-back, it’s lush, and it’s crawling with remote workers who traded suits for sarongs.

#### Perth and Beyond: The Wild West of Remote Work
Perth is the wild card—remote, raw, and surprisingly connected. It’s for those who want space, sunsets, and a taste of the unknown.

#### Cost of Living: Sticker Shock or Sweet Deal?
Australia isn’t cheap. Rent will make your wallet weep, and brunch is a luxury sport. But the quality of life? Off the charts. Sunshine tax is real, but for many, it’s worth every penny.

#### Rent, Food, and the Price of Sunshine
Expect to pay a premium for location, lifestyle, and that daily flat white. Groceries and rent eat up your budget, but public transport and healthcare soften the blow.

*🚀 Ready to maximize your nomad income? [Take the 90-second quiz now!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Internet Infrastructure: Fast, Furious, or Flaky?
The National Broadband Network (NBN) is a national obsession—and a national joke. In big cities, speeds are solid. In the bush? Prepare for digital detox.

#### The NBN: Blessing or Bureaucratic Curse?
NBN is a mixed bag. Some days it’s lightning, other days it’s dial-up nostalgia. Always have a backup plan—and a hotspot.

#### Coworking Culture: Where the Magic Happens
Coworking spaces are the watering holes of the digital nomad herd. From WeWork to indie lofts, Australia’s cities are packed with options. Community, coffee, and connectivity—what more do you need?

#### Top Coworking Spaces for Digital Nomads
Spaces like Fishburners (Sydney), The Commons (Melbourne), and StartUp WA (Perth) are more than desks—they’re launchpads for ideas and friendships.

*🌏 Want to know your true earning potential? [Get your free digital nomad income report!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Community Vibes: Finding Your Tribe
Nomad life is lonely—unless you find your tribe. Meetups, masterminds, and Slack groups are your lifeline. Australia’s remote worker community is tight-knit and welcoming.

#### Meetups, Masterminds, and Nomad Networks
From casual coffees to high-octane hackathons, Australia’s cities offer endless ways to connect. Dive in, and you’ll never work alone.

#### Healthcare Headaches: Are You Covered?
Medicare is for locals. For everyone else, private insurance is non-negotiable. Don’t gamble with your health—or your bank balance.

#### Medicare Myths and Private Insurance Realities
Don’t believe the hype: unless you’re a resident, Medicare doesn’t cover you. Get expat insurance before you land.

#### Banking and Money Moves
Opening a bank account as a non-resident is possible, but it’s a paperwork marathon. Fees lurk everywhere—choose wisely.

*💡 Ready to discover your digital nomad income? [Start the 90-second assessment now!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Opening Accounts and Dodging Fees
The big four banks welcome newcomers, but watch for hidden charges. Digital banks are rising—consider them for flexibility.

#### Work-Life Balance: Myth or Manifesto?
Aussies don’t just preach work-life balance—they live it. Expect shorter hours, longer weekends, and a culture that values play as much as productivity.

#### The Aussie Approach to Downtime
Surf before sunrise, beers after work, and a national aversion to overtime. It’s not just a lifestyle—it’s a manifesto.

#### Legal Loopholes and Risks
Getting caught working illegally isn’t just embarrassing—it’s career-ending. Fines, deportation, and bans are all on the table.

#### What Happens If You Get Caught Working Illegally?
Immigration doesn’t play games. If you’re caught, you’re out—no second chances, no sob stories.

*✈️ Want to see how much you could earn as a digital nomad? [Get your free personalized report!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Cultural Curveballs
Aussie culture is a minefield of slang, sarcasm, and unspoken rules. Learn fast, laugh often, and never take yourself too seriously.

#### Aussie Slang, Etiquette, and the Art of Blending In
“Arvo,” “thongs,” “no worries”—master the lingo or risk getting lost in translation.

#### The Environmental Factor: Nature Calls
Australia is a playground for the wild at heart. From the Great Barrier Reef to the Outback, nature is always calling.

#### Beaches, Bushwalks, and the Great Outdoors
Trade your desk for a surfboard or a hiking trail. Here, the outdoors isn’t a luxury—it’s a way of life.

#### Tech Essentials: What to Pack
Adapters, power banks, and a VPN are non-negotiable. The right gear is your lifeline.

#### Gear, Gadgets, and Power Plug Surprises
Australia’s plugs are unique—bring the right adapters or prepare for frustration.

*🌟 Curious about your digital nomad income potential? [Diagnose it in under 90 seconds!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

#### Safety and Security: Staying Streetwise
Australia is safe, but complacency is the enemy. Petty theft exists, and nature bites back—literally.

#### Urban Myths and Real Risks
Sharks, spiders, and snakes—most are more afraid of you. But lock your laptop and watch your wallet.

#### Exit Strategy: When It’s Time to Move On
Visas expire, adventures end. Plan your exit before you’re shown the door.

#### Visa Renewals, Border Runs, and Next Steps
Extensions are rare, border runs are risky. Have your next destination ready.

#### Future of Nomadism in Australia
Will Australia ever launch a digital nomad visa? The jury’s out. Until then, play by the rules—or risk losing the game.",1,1749479221.0,NomadicLifestyleGlobe,0,1.0,False

**Ru:** Yes I am sure, ho! Bring back Gayi for the Snatch Game, no scram you commoner slut.

Wintergreen sashays away with heel clacks while Rupaul sprays herself in her lodge.

*scratch... scratch... scratch... scratch...*

Rupaul's ears perked up a bit as she perceives a nagging sound. Slowly, Rupaul trod toward the dark hallway.

*Scratch!... Scratch!... Scratch!... Scratch!...*

Breathing heavily, Rupaul put her head out into the darkness, turning her fleshlight on to shine a pale beam over it.

*SCRATCH! SCRATCH! SCRATCH! SCRATCH!*

Rupaul gasped at the sight before her. Tammie Brown was naked, covered in blood, and scratching at the wall with her long nails. Hearing her, Tammie twisted her neck with a large smile dripping with torn flesh. Ru was about to run, but Tammie leaped at her and puked fracking oils all over her face. Rupaul screamed in agony as the oils burned her face and blinded her. Then she fainted.

**Ru:** Oooh... Wh-What happened ?

Opening her eyes, Ru looked around her and flinched. Flames. Fire. An inferno. The WOW studios were burning and in ruins. Rupaul wandered around, looking for her minions. Suddenly, in a dark corner, she recognized a familiar face. It was Michelle Visage crouching and gnawing on Ross Matthews.

**Ru:** Mi-Michelle ?

**Michelle:** Nggnrgnrg (devours Ross Matthews's corpse). Why Rupaul ? Why ? Because of your Gayi, the fauna and flora were destroyed and- and... (she licks her fingers). My sweet, oh so sweet hallucinogenic toads disappeared... How am I supposed to give bullshit judging without my frogs, Ru ?!

**Ru:** Michelle, I don't know what to tell you, I...

**Michelle:** I need my alvarius! Alvarius ! ALVARIUS!!!

Saliva and blood leaked from Michelle's mouth as she wailed feral sounds. Rupaul raced away from her. She reached a dead end where a TV played the news amidst the debris of the studios.

**Wintergreen:** And now on Channel 96, we report that because of Rupaul and Gayi, the animals have disappeared and gay men had to adopt labubus instead. Sadly, it gave too much power to the labubus who have taken over the world.

A video of Jewels getting mauled by labubus is displayed.

**Ru:** Ah! They got Jorgeous!

**Wintergreen:** Even more alarming, with global warming reaching gargantuan levels, plants went completely extinct, including coffee. That's right Ru. (looks at Rupaul through the TV). No. More. Coffee. Enema.

**Ru:** NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

While she watched the TV, Michelle Visage caught back to her. Ru tried to walk away, but Jewels's undead body was to her left while Rosé with a mustache was on the other side.

**Wintergreen:** This is the beginning... the beginning... This is the beginning of the rest of your life! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

**Rupaul:** No! Get away from me!

**Michelle:** Alvarius...

**Jewels:** Labubus...

**Rosé:** Mustache.

**Ru:** AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

**???:** Rupaul ?

Rupaul woke up and gasped. She was back in her lodge with everything back to normal. Michelle was there and not feral.

**Michelle:** So Rupaul, what about Gayi ? Should we get her or Nicole Paige Brooks for the Snatch Game ?

**Ru:** FUCK GAYI !!! Book Nicole now and throw that dildo bullshit in the garbage.

In the shadows, Tammie Brown smiled and vanished.

Meanwhile in Canada.

**Brooke Lynn:** (read her script) Well girls, it's time for the Robot Ball 2.0!

Brooke looks at the ceiling and shuddered. Tammie Brown was naked and covered in maple syrup.

1l761g1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mindfulnesschallenges/comments/1l761g1/finding_gratitude_in_everyday_life/,Finding Gratitude in Everyday Life,"### Embracing the Dream of Normalcy

In a world where we often find ourselves caught up in the hustle and bustle of daily routines, it is easy to forget the beauty and significance of our ordinary lives. The quote, ""Your normal day is someone's dream, so be thankful every day,"" serves as a poignant reminder to cultivate gratitude, even in the smallest of moments. This profound statement encourages us to take a step back and reflect on the richness of our daily experiences and how they can shape a more positive and fulfilled life.

#### The Significance of Normalcy

To many, the very essence of what constitutes an ordinary day may seem mundane—waking up, going to work or school, eating meals, and spending time with loved ones. Yet, for countless individuals around the globe, these seemingly trivial activities are the epitome of hope and aspiration. People in dire circumstances, such as those facing poverty, illness, or conflict, may yearn for the simple pleasures of a normal day. Thus, recognizing this can encourage us to cherish what we often take for granted.

#### Embracing Gratitude for the Little Things

Gratitude is not just a fleeting feeling; it can be a transformative practice that can shape our worldview. The little things—those unremarkable yet profound moments—can have a powerful impact on our well-being. A warm cup of coffee in the morning, a smile from a stranger, or a cozy evening spent with family can instill joy and fulfillment. By practicing gratitude for these small blessings, we begin to shift our focus from what we lack to what we have. 

#### Finding Light in Difficult Times

Life inevitably presents challenges and moments of hardship. It is during these times that the concept of gratitude can be most impactful. We can choose to view obstacles not as insurmountable burdens but as opportunities for growth. When faced with adversity, cultivating a mindset of gratitude can provide perspective and resilience. For instance, a difficult day at work might lead to stress and frustration initially, but with reflection, it can also be viewed as a chance to develop problem-solving skills or learn about our own limits.

#### The Bigger Picture: Trusting the Journey

Believing that ""everything will work out for your good"" requires a blend of hope and trust in the journey of life. This philosophy resonates deeply within the framework of many spiritual and philosophical teachings. Trusting that there is a purpose to our struggles, and that our paths are leading us toward fulfilment, can be empowering. It encourages us to stay open to the lessons hidden within our hardships and to appreciate the growth that comes from navigating life’s complexities.

#### Cultivating a Daily Gratitude Practice

Incorporating gratitude into our daily lives doesn’t have to be an arduous task. Here are some simple practices to help cultivate an attitude of thankfulness:

1. **Gratitude Journaling:** Take a few minutes each day to jot down three things you are thankful for. Over time, this practice can shift your focus towards positivity.

2. **Mindful Moments:** Throughout the day, pause to reflect on your surroundings. Acknowledge the beauty of nature, the warmth of your home, or the kindness of others.

3. **Express Appreciation:** Don’t hesitate to vocalize your gratitude to those around you. A heartfelt ""thank you"" can go a long way in fostering connections and spreading positivity.

4. **Celebrate Small Wins:** Recognize and celebrate even the smallest achievements. These moments contribute to a sense of progress and fulfillment.

#### Conclusion

Incorporating gratitude into our lives can be a powerful antidote to negativity and dissatisfaction. The daily routines we often see as ordinary are, in fact, extraordinary when viewed through the lens of appreciation. By practicing gratitude, even in challenging times, we unlock a deeper satisfaction with life and a more profound understanding of our existence. So, the next time you feel overwhelmed or discontent, remember: your normal day is indeed someone’s dream. Embrace it with thankfulness, and watch as your perspective transforms.

She had that whole quiet, deep captions + book café aesthetics going on. Mutuals, good taste in music, and lived in Islamabad too.

We started talking casually, late-night convos, memes, flirting here and there. I wasn’t even trying to be serious, but she was *so* easy to talk to. She’d randomly drop “what’s your biggest fear?” at 1AM like we’re in some Netflix teen drama. Fast-forward 3 weeks, and we were calling each other “mine” on chats. Bro, I thought I was in a whole relationship 💀

She suggested we meet. I was like, “bet.” We linked up at Beverly Centre, walked around, grabbed coffee. She wore a black hoodie and didn’t even try to do the whole “overdressed for a casual meet” thing — I was *done.* We lowkey cuddled in the back of a friend’s car later that week (don’t ask), and yeah… things definitely escalated.

But here’s the twist: Out of nowhere, she tells me, “I think we moved too fast. I need to focus on myself.” And just like that — boom. Ghosted. No calls, no replies, nothing.

A week later she was out at Damn Burgers with another guy. A *Mutual*. Islamabad is literally a shoebox. You can’t sneeze without someone’s cousin knowing.

Now I’m here acting all unbothered while listening to Faris Shafi and overthinking every convo we had.
