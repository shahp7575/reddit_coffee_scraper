The Freaks joined in the victory lap as Gray took credit for getting everything correct, and accused the speakers at the press conference of simply repeating everything Gray has been saying for years!!! 

Gray managed to squeeze out $169 in superchats, from the usually contributors, plus a handful of coffees and 7 memberships. 

The highlight was watching him eat an apple, while banding the keyboard to remind everyone to support the channel in the chat!!  I still think he only has bottom teeth. ",1,1734725383.0,GrayHughesDiscussions,0,1.0,False

1hishdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1hishdj/my_ex_came_back_in_my_life_and_now_i_am_confused/,My EX came back in my life and now i am confused what to do.,"I (20m) just met my ex today (21F), she flew to my city to specifically meet me and talk to me etc,   
context - we both were 16 - 17 when we were in a relationship, i used to trust her and she was love of my life (i know sounds cringe) and i was really emotionally attached to her at that time, long story short she ghosted me, we went from talking everyday to her suddenly vanishing out of my life, i wasn't able to meet her as she went to another city for college, she reached out to me in 2022 but then ghosted me again, same thing in 2023 and now in 2024, everything was on calls and text so i wasn't thinking about this much, 

but today she MET me, we had a coffee together and discussed what has happened in last years since she ghosted me, 

I am really mad at her for ghosting me, i feel betrayed and angry but i wasn't feeling any of this when she met me, i sat down with her and had a conversation VERY normally, i don't consider myself to be totally moved on from her cuz things were too sudden for me back then, but i don't have any feeling for her right now. 

my life has changed a lot since last 3 years and she wasn't present in my life while things happened. now she just suddenly showed up and wants to get back as she still have feeling for me, i don't believe that she has feeling for me, i told her it is too hard for me to trust her as what she did to me ended up developing abandonment issues in me, we both told each other about what happened in our life in past years since the ghosting - she went to college and found a guy whom she dated for a year before that guy mutually breaking up with her, then she have another guy who she has rejected but that guy keeps insisting on him being in her life, i don't really care about what goes on in her life but WHY return to me when you already have things going on in your life? i feel like i am being treated as a safe bet that ""this guy will be there whenever i want him to be""  
and to he honest  I DON'T EVEN KNOW ANYTHING ANYMORE AT THIS POINT, I don't trust her at all with ANYTHING but i don't know what's wrong with me, i am very confused to  keep her i my life as a friend, or date her again or anything, after coffee she came back to my place and she met my mom, everything went calm and then i dropped her back at her place, 

my gut says not to be involved with her with ANYTHING.  am i being taken for granted?   
i haven't dated anyone since she ghosted me and her coming back and telling me that she loved me kinda made me scared and confused, i am feeling mixed emotions towards her, please help me ",1,1734725259.0,LifeAdvice,1,1.0,False

1hisdzl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hisdzl,GF Christmas tree cupcakes!,"I made these chocolate cupcakes with a peppermint buttercream. These came out so cute, and they were delicious! The cupcakes are soft and fluffy, and the buttercream isn‚Äôt too sweet. The mint flavor is really light and goes so well with the chocolate. Here is the full recipe:

Chocolate cupcakes:

1 ¬Ω cups granulated sugar
2 cups King Arthur measure for measure GF flour
¬æ cup Hershey‚Äôs special dark cocoa
1 ¬Ω teaspoons baking powder
1 ¬Ω teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs
1 cup whole milk
¬Ω cup vegetable oil
1 ¬Ω teaspoons pure vanilla extract
6 ounces hot coffee

Preheat oven to 350¬∞F. Line two 12-serving cupcake pans with cupcake liners and set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until there are no clumps.

Add the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla. Beat with a mixer on medium speed for about two minutes.

Mix in very hot coffee. I just use my Keurig while the batter is mixing for two minutes. 

Spoon batter evenly into cupcake liners. I usually go about halfway. These cupcakes rise a lot, so filling the liners will cause the cupcakes to spill out while baking. 

Bake for 20 to 22 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

Remove from the oven and let the cupcakes cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then remove from pan and let them cool on a wire rack. 

For the buttercream: (This will ice 12 cupcakes. I froze the other 12 for a different time)

2 sticks cold, unsalted butter
2 teaspoons clear vanilla extract 
1 teaspoon mint extract
4-5 cups sifted powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1-3 tablespoons cold heavy cream
Green food coloring, as much as you need to get the desired color you want.

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, whip the butter 1 to 2 minutes on medium speed, or until smooth and creamy. 

Add in the vanilla and mix until combined.

Slowly add in 2 cups powdered sugar. Mix until combined. 

Add 1 cup powdered sugar at a time and continue mixing until it‚Äôs pretty thick, yet smooth. Add the salt with the last sugar scoop.

Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of the heavy cream to thin the frosting. You want the frosting to be thick and creamy, but be able to hold a point to hold the Christmas tree shape.

* God‚Äôs Gift of Laughter
   * Abstract: ‚ÄúIt is against reason for a man to be burdensome to others, by never showing himself agreeable to others or being a kill-joy or wet blanket on their enjoyment. And so Seneca says, ‚ÄòBear yourself with wit, lest you be regarded as sour or despised as dull.‚Äô Now those who lack playfulness are sinful, those who never say anything to make you smile, or are grumpy with those who do.‚Äù *St. Thomas Aquinas* ‚ÄúWhere joylessness reigns, where humor dies, the spirit of Jesus Christ is assuredly absent.‚Äù *Pope Benedict XVI* Humor is not only a gift from God, but necessary for human happiness. Proverbs tells us that laughter is good for the soul, and indeed, there are spiritual, emotional and physical benefits of joy and laughter.¬† Laughter reduces stress and is an antidote against depression. Catholic culture has produced some of the world‚Äôs best-known comedians. Saints and sinners alike have used the

* Hidden Laughter in the Catholic Imagination: Flannery O‚ÄôConnor, Umberto Eco, and St. Augustine
   * Abstract: Near the end of her life, Flannery O‚ÄôConnor wrote to a friend about a medieval statue she had once seen at the Cloisters in New York of ‚Äúthe Virgin holding the Christ child and both were laughing; not smiling, laughing.‚Äù Her letter is wistful‚Äîand begs some interesting questions. What kind of humor did this statue represent? Why had this vision of holy levity been so memorable? What would the laughter of the spotless Lamb and his spotless Bride be like? This paper proposes that the Catholic, sacramental imagination contains a distinct sense of humor, often hiding in plain sight, unnamed and under-described‚Äîa humor that can elude even great comic visionaries like O‚ÄôConnor. Umberto Eco‚Äôs ingenious but anti-sacramental novel, ‚ÄúThe Name of the Rose,‚Äù proposes the comic as Christendom‚Äôs dark, disruptive secret. But Eco imagines only a lonely laughter reduced to irony and subversion, the laughter of a shattered cosmology that can no longer imagine the laughter of graced, creaturely dependence. Leaning on Alasdair Macintyre‚Äôs critique of postmodern irony (like Eco‚Äôs) and William Desmond‚Äôs vision of ‚Äúredeeming laughter,‚Äù I will offer literary counterexamples of ‚Äúsacramental humor,‚Äù in particular the humor hidden in Augustine‚Äôs conversion account in *Confessions*. As Augustine recalls Christ as that beauty ‚Äúever ancient, ever new,‚Äù his narrative percolates with a laughter, neither ironic nor subversive, but restorative, humble, grateful, and shared. His language of gentle laughter is hidden but contagious‚Äîa keynote in Christian narrative and life from Nazareth to now.

* Muriel Spark: Transformative Satire
   * Abstract: Those expecting an anodyne procession of saintly protagonists from the Catholic writer Muriel Spark will be startled by the parade of petty egotists and hapless connivers who march through her collected works. Her innovative techniques and the deeply moral framework that holds up her literary constructions set her apart from not only her secular peers but also many mainstream Catholic authors. Vice has a trajectory in the world of Muriel Spark, and it will eventually lead to suffering, whether intentional or not. Spark firmly avoided sentimentality in her fiction, believing that providing readers with a cathartic experience of having participated in suffering and its resolution would offer them a feeling of having fulfilled their moral duties. She agreed that God could be considered ‚Äúa character by omission‚Äù in her works; the resulting absence allows for her to document how foolish our pretensions to self-determination and how deep our attraction to vice. This presentation will include discussion of hidden treasures from the Muriel Spark archives and how they reflect the midcentury culture that she examined under her microscope and that did not know exactly how to view her in response.

* Sigrid Undset: Novelist of Mercy
   * Abstract: In my recent essay, ‚ÄúSigrid Undset: Novelist of Mercy,‚Äù I make a claim for the formal and imaginative mastery of Sigrid Undset‚Äôs Kristin Lavransdatter: ‚ÄúIt is amazing enough to see such intricacy and beauty in a Flannery O‚ÄôConnor short story or a Hopkins poem, where we can more readily appreciate how no word or detail is lost. But to discern such elaborate structural and aesthetic architecture in a novel of over a thousand pages is positively a marvel, and it makes reading Kristin Lavransdatter an unparalleled experience.‚Äù (Women of the Catholic Imagination, Word on Fire, 2024). In this talk, I will invite readers to consider one recurring image in the novel‚Äîthat of the cloak‚Äîand will trace its potent literary and spiritual implications as they are subtly and indirectly rendered by Undset. ‚ÄúShe had let Bentein come under her cloak. . . . .Under her cloak she pulled out the reliquary cross that her father had given her. . . . Brynhild Fluga came with word that the cloak was ready, and Kristin met Erlend in the loft room as before‚Ä¶.‚Äù Is the cloak an emblem of shame, of illicit, hidden deeds? Is it a source of protection? What does Undset communicate to her reader through her rich and shifting rendering of this most potent of spiritual symbols, and why? Such an exploration further establishes the novel as one of the greatest works of the Catholic imagination ever written.

* To Have ‚Äòfelt fire as well as seen it‚Äô: The Limits of Willa Cather‚Äôs Catholic Imagination
   * Abstract: *Death Comes for the Archbishop* is commonly included in lists of great ‚ÄúCatholic‚Äù fiction, but readers are sometimes surprised to learn that author Willa Cather (1873-1947) was not, indeed, a Catholic. (She was raised in a Baptist household, but was baptized in the Episcopal Church in 1922.) Based on *Death Comes for the Archbishop* and her 1931 *Shadows on the Rock*, centered on life in 17th century Catholic Quebec, as well as the frequent, sympathetic treatment of Catholicism in her fiction, the assertion that Cather in some sense worked out of a type of ‚ÄúCatholic imagination‚Äù seems warranted. But is it? Working from these two novels, as well as *My Antonia*, *The Professor‚Äôs House* and *My Mortal Enemy*, this presentation will explore the function of Catholicism in Cather‚Äôs work: what Catholic faith and practice represents in her fiction as well as what she does not, or perhaps cannot apprehend. An examination of the power as well as the limitations of Cather‚Äôs use of Catholic history, practice, themes and imagery offers an intriguing path into consideration of the ‚ÄúCatholic imagination‚Äù and what difference it makes, as Francis X. Connolly wrote in a 1951 assessment of Cather in America magazine, to have ‚Äúfelt fire as well as seen it.‚Äù

* Artistic Apprenticeship as an Aesthetics of Ascent
   * Abstract: Contemporary liberal education has to some extent recovered the traditional conception of learning as a way of life and education as a formation of the whole person. Apprenticeship in the arts may seem resistant to that conception, because of its focus on the work to be made rather than the character of the artist as its good. The MFA program at UST has attempted a curriculum that really does serve as a kind of artistic, spiritual, and intellectual formation that leads its apprentice writers through the particularities of their genre's craft, through the history of its practice, and beyond through a philosophy and theology of art and beauty that follows the pathway of ascent first presented in the work of Dionysius the Aeropagite.

* A School of the Catholic Imagination: Change in Order to Remain the Same
   * Abstract: Taking very seriously John Henry Newman‚Äôs insistence that when contemplating any change we exercise ‚Äúconservative action‚Äù upon the past, I will discuss the way in which those who hold firmly to the permanent things can sometimes refuge in a ""false conservatism"" that becomes reactionary and nostalgic, as if all that‚Äôs great and good has happened in the past, and anything new, anything happening *now*, is part of societal decadence or decline. But can we live solely off the culture of the past, even if it is rich? When we are talking about changes in sacred art, music, or architecture, the answer should be different‚Äîwith much more of an emphasis on Newman‚Äôs ‚Äúconservative action upon the past‚Äù in order to ward off fleeting and vacuous novelty. However, Newman also insists that, paradoxically, the shapes of enduring truths must sometimes ‚Äúchange . . . in order to remain the same. In a higher world it is otherwise, but here below to live is to change, and to be perfect is to have changed often.‚Äù Philip Rieff‚Äôs suggestion in *My Life Among the Deathworks* is well-worth mulling: every generation needs new spies of the sacred order, ‚Äúdedicated to the proposition that the truths have been revealed and require constant rereading and application in light of‚Äù the particulars of our moment. Taken in a misguided manner, this could lead to a cavalier presentism that would remake solid things in order to sell them as relevant. Undertaken prudently, it is the essence of persuasion‚Äîrooted in what‚Äôs lasting but appealing via the available means, the language that will reach a real audience. I will discuss the way in which the curriculum reflects this tension: for example, fiction students read St. Thomas Aquinas' *Treatise on Human Acts* to better grasp human nature, they read Augustine and Dante and Flannery and Tolkien and the classic Catholic writers, but they also study carefully contemporary fiction by well known writers like Donna Tartt and David Foster Wallace.

* St. Thomas and the Whole Horse
   * Abstract: ‚ÄúA thought to Donne,‚Äù as T.S. Eliot, in ‚ÄúThe Metaphysical Poets,‚Äù famously writes, ‚Äúwas an experience; it modified his sensibility.‚Äù¬† Of course, Mr. Eliot is here championing *integritas*, or ‚Äúwholeness,‚Äù as a poetic virtue. Indeed, Aquinas characterizes Beauty as possessing *harmonia*, *claritas*, and *integritas*. But what is meant by ‚Äúwholeness,‚Äù or *integritas*? In the M.F.A. program at The University of St. Thomas-Houston, we focus on the three transcendent attributes of Beauty mentioned above, and this focus distinguishes our program. In my talk, I‚Äôll discuss how we incorporate the idea of *integritas*, or ‚Äúwholeness,‚Äù into our curriculum via literary history, aesthetics, and spirituality.

* Positionality, Prophecy, and the Artist of Faith
   * Abstract: For a working writer, the problems of market awareness, audience capture, and authorial identity have never appeared more vexing than they do in a digital age. A prevalent temptation, to which many have succumbed, is to learn to ‚Äúperform‚Äù what already ‚Äúworks‚Äù (in the sense of fitting mimetic categories and garnering easy attention) rather than to explore what once worked, what might work, and what ought to be done whether it attracts present plaudits or not. How can a writer of faith navigate these questions while, as often happens, also laboring under intense internal and external pressures which a more secularized writer might be thought not to endure? How might writers of faith actually be working at an unrecognized advantage: i.e., how can working from a center of identity ‚Äúhidden with Christ in God‚Äù liberate us (in ways we may not immediately spot) from subservience to presentist currents of fashion, opinion, and externalized self-definition?¬† Put another way, how might an accurate theological anthropology liberate the creative mind from states of anxious, despairing, circumscribed self-consciousness and open a path into integrated, prophetic self-transcendence?

* ‚ÄúTheir Eyes Were Opened‚Äù: Sacramental Light and Vision in the Gospel of Luke
   * Abstract: Light and darkness, vision and blindness feature prominently in the Gospel of Luke. Zechariah and Simeon both acclaim Jesus as a bringer of ‚Äúlight‚Äù (Lk 1:79; 2:32), and Jesus himself identifies the proclamation of ‚Äúrecovering of sight to the blind‚Äù as a constitutive element of his mission (4:18). Nonetheless, on Jesus‚Äôs arrival at Jerusalem days before his passion, he laments that ‚Äúthe things that make for peace‚Ä¶are hid from your eyes‚Äù (19:42). The ‚Äúdarkness‚Äù that descends on Golgotha (23:44) seems to linger through Sunday at Emmaus: ‚Äúit is toward evening, and the day is now far spent‚Äù (24:29). Yet new light and vision are granted when Jesus breaks the bread: ‚Äútheir eyes were opened and they recognized him; and he vanished out of their sight‚Äù (24:31). This vision, which generates authentically Catholic imagination, is centered on the paschal mystery, which is unintelligible to worldly eyes (9:44-45). Because it is mediated by Word and Sacrament, whose innermost content is the same paschal mystery (22:19-20; 24:26‚Äì27, 44-47), it is also participatory. That means, on the one hand, that it both demands and enables total renunciation, even to the point of death (9:23; 14:33); and, on the other, that it is a sharing in the vision of Jesus himself, who is our Pasch. As such, it is the vision of ‚Äúthe first day of the week‚Äù (24:1)‚Äîthe new creation whose sovereign and paradigm is the crucified and risen new Adam, who sees and rejoices at the poor and the penitent.

* Deer and Snakes in Pagan and Catholic Imaginations
   * Abstract: One of the components of the Catholic imagination is the ability to assimilate elements from ambient culture into the complex of Christian culture. The early centuries of the Church are characterized by their confrontation, assimilation, and transformation of elements of pagan, Greco-Roman culture. In this paper, we will analyze how early Christian authors took up a common, Roman zoological trope about deer and snakes and how they associated this with the deer longing for running streams in Psalm 42. This interplay of natural knowledge and the data of Revelation points to the creativity of the Catholic imagination in ways that show up not just in Scriptural exegesis, but also in Christian art, such that the deer and the snake appear in apse mosaics from the fourth century through the High Middle Ages. In this, we see the power of the Catholic imagination to make use of things old and new in order to manifest the ways in which grace elevates and perfects nature.

* Journeying with St. Bonaventure into the Mind of God: Bonaventure‚Äôs Use of Literary Imagery to Inspire the Heart and Illuminate the Intellect
   * Abstract: ‚ÄúThere is probably no better illustration in medieval thought of how the genius of the symbolic imagination also involves deep speculative insight.‚Äù So wrote the University of Chicago‚Äôs Bernard McGinn of Bonaventure‚Äôs *Itinerarium mentis in Deum* (The Journey of the Mind into God). And again: ‚ÄúFor clarity of expression, mastery of organization, and density of thought, the Itinerarium ranks as one of the purest gems of medieval theology.‚Äù I will show how Bonaventure used literary imagery in creative ways in his preaching and teaching. Bonaventure‚Äôs distinctive style had been honed over years of practice preaching in the style that had become popular in the thirteenth century, a style in which the preacher would use a biblical phrase as a mnemonic device with which to structure his sermon. In the Itinerarium, for example, Bonaventure structured his text around the vision St. Francis had on Mt. Alverna of the six-winged Seraph angel with Christ crucified at its center from which Francis received the stigmata. In the Itinerarium, each pair of wings represented a different stage of the ascent of the mind into God. I will discuss a whole range of imagery Bonaventure used in several of his major theological works, including The Tree of Life, the Reduction of the Arts to Theology, and his fascinating use of the words and images in this verse from Job 28:11: ‚ÄúThe depths of rivers he hath searched, and hidden things he hath brought forth to light‚Äù to explain the four books of Peter Lombard‚Äôs Sentences.

* Liturgical Mysticism in the Autos Sacramentales of Jos√© de Valdivielso
   * Abstract: This presentation will analyze the relationship between grace and nature in three *Autos Sacramentales,* or Eucharistic Dramas, written by the baroque Spanish playwright Jos√© de Valdivielso: *The Phoenix of Love, The Tree of Grace,* and *The Proofs and Nobility of the Human Race.* More specifically, this study will demonstrate that Valdivielso‚Äôs dramas reveal a profound synthesis of two central theological dictums: that the Eucharist is the source and summit of the Christian Life, and that mysticism is the normal end and perfection towards which every member of the faithful is called. By examining how Valdivielso utilizes the medium of dramatic performance to characterize the relationship between divinity and humanity, this essay seeks to highlight the role of the ‚ÄòCatholic imagination‚Äô in the formation and manifestation of the ‚Äòliturgical mystic.‚Äô

* The Generous Bridegroom: The Role of the Eucharist in the Moral Life in The Phoenix of Love  by Jos√© de Valdivielso
   * Abstract: Despite the fact that many medieval theologians urged frequent reception of Holy Communion, the frequency of reception of the laity decreased.¬† By the late 1500s, many received communion only once a year as required by the Church. As a consequence, the only relationship between the Eucharist and the moral life was that one could not receive in a state of mortal sin -further causing moral theology to become even more focused on obligations (and less on a loving friendship with God). Jose de Valdivielso‚Äôs Eucharistic Dramas attempt to reverse this trend, by once again emphasizing the important role of the Eucharist in the moral life of the laity. By telling how the love story between Christ and the soul reaches its highpoint in a Eucharistic marriage, Valdivielso is able to show how the Eucharist draws humans with deep love to act morally, helps them overcome temptation, and gives them wisdom, chastity, and the other theological virtues. The Eucharist is a foretaste of the happiness in heaven and is hence an important goal of the moral life. This presentation will draw out this rich Eucharistic theology and show how Valdivielso takes the moral theology found in the tradition of Aquinas, John of the Cross, and Teresa of Avila and skillfully presents this theology to the common people.

* Words made Flesh: Theatre and Theology, a Match Made in Athens
   * Abstract: Classical theatre grew out of the worship of Dionysus in Athens. Compulsory for citizens to attend, theatre for Athens was a place where abstract ideas found voice, arrayed in word and gesture. Theatre re-emerged in Christendom, also within the context of religious festivals. In Spain, where the Mediterranean sun likewise fosters outdoor celebration, drama had a special role in illustrating principles, giving the common people concrete manifestations of moral *exempla*.¬† Thus, these translations of Valdivielso‚Äôs dramas not only grant access to an important tradition of Christian theatre but hearken back to the very origins of the artform.

* Transcendence in Susannah Clarke‚Äôs Piranesi
   * Abstract: The British novelist and short story writer Susannah Clarke is best known for *Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell*, ‚Äúan alternative history set in 19th-century England during the Napoleonic Wars‚Äù (Wikipedia), later made into a limited television series by the BBC. The popularity of that novel derived in large part from its fantasy elements and in particular its exploration of magic. Sixteen years later, Clarke published a much shorter and more enigmatic novel, *Piranesi*. Here the story takes place in a seemingly infinite number of halls and vestibules filled with marble statues in what the protagonist calls the ‚ÄúHouse.‚Äù As the narrative unfolds, the mystery deepens: is the House a prison or a wonder, a psychological fugue state or a form of mind control. *Piranesi* continues Clarke‚Äôs fascination with the tension between enchantment and disenchantment, between the utilitarian mindset of secularism and a form of consciousness open to mystery and meaning. Sprinkled through with allusions to C.S. Lewis‚Äôs *Chronicles of Narnia*, *Piranesi* seems to be an allegorical exploration of the ideas of Lewis‚Äôs close friend, Owen Barfield, whose ideas about the history and evolution of consciousness have been influential on writers as diverse as Saul Bellow and Lewis himself.

* Transcendence in the Poetry of William Everson/Brother Antoninus
   * Abstract: William Everson was a mid-century California Beat Poet, who became a Catholic, entered St. Albert‚Äôs, the Dominican House in Oakland, took the name Brother Antoninus, and then produced a rich body of religious poetry.¬† The greatest influence on his work is the nature poet, Robinson Jeffers, sometimes called the poet laureate of the environmental movement and also one of the leading American poets of the sublime.¬† Offering a sustained critique of idealism in both philosophy and art, Jeffers‚Äô poetry is designed to foster the conditions for a transcendence of the self, indeed of the entire human order.¬† Antoninus is similarly preoccupied with the question of transcendence but his poetry countenances both an affirmation of interiority, not just its effacement (as in Jeffers), as a path to transcendence and a dialectic between transcendence and immanence. ¬†

* Providence, Prudence, and Alyosha Karamazov
   * Abstract: As Josef Pieper observed, the modern sense of prudence is ‚Äúfar more akin to mere utility‚Ä¶ than to the ideal of nobility‚Ä¶ \[and carries\] the connotation of timorous, small-minded self-preservation, of a rather selfish concern with oneself‚Äù (*Four Cardinal Virtues* 4).¬† This is great loss.¬†But in his depiction of Alyosha Fyodorovich Karamazov, Dostoevsky retrieves and artistically represents an older, deeper sense of prudence -- ‚Äúever ancient, ever new‚Äù -- akin to that articulated by Thomas Aquinas. Thomas developed the etymological link between *prudentia* and *providentia*. Prudence fosters a person‚Äôs capacity to decide through attention to the complexities of circumstance. But when ‚Äúcharity molds prudence itself,‚Äù it ‚Äúparticipat\[es\] by grace in the life of the Trinitarian God‚Äù (37).¬† In charity ‚Äì the slow work of self-forgetful, ‚Äútranscendent,‚Äù ‚Äúactive love‚Äù -- human prudence grows receptively attuned to divine providence. Active love, prudently practiced, is the seed that falls to the ground and bears much fruit (John 12.24, epigraph to the novel). Alyosha‚Äôs mentor Zosima claims that active love can enable a person to ‚Äúbehold clearly the miraculous power of the Lord who has been all the time loving and mysteriously guiding you‚Äù (*BK* 56). In attending ‚Äúrough ground‚Äù of relationships traversed by Alyosha, the reader beholds the cooperative, incarnational relation between providence and prudence.

* ‚ÄúPoetry and the Power to Know‚Äù: The Impact of Poetic Knowledge on the World of Higher Education
   * Abstract: American higher education is Big Business, increasingly disconnected from the pursuit of truth, goodness, and beauty that has always been its most important heritage. Colleges and universities have become little more than diploma factories for the all-important job market‚Äîsadly, the singular focus of far too many of their graduates. We have lost sight of what education can *and should* be. Some institutions have responded to this crisis by turning away from the world of utilitarian education and embracing one of two traditional modes of learning: the philosophical or the poetic. Yet their educational renaissance remains in one mode or the other, rather than attempting to marry the two into a single, immersive experience. This separation mirrors history. In the Middle Ages, the poetic world of the monastery clashed with the schools and their philosophical approach. But this conflict between the two schools is a false dichotomy, preventing us from seeing the true antidote to the crisis of our time: a symbiosis of the philosophical and poetic modes of education. President Washut will explore what these two modes mean, where they came from, and why a harmonious coexistence of each is not only possible but necessary for sound education.

* Imagination as the Doorway of Christian Education
   * Abstract: Works of imagination abound in Christian history, even appearing at the core of revelation itself in the Scriptures, particularly the stories of the Gospels. Thus, understanding revelation and Christian experience hinges upon understanding the role of imagination therein. Blessed Basile Moreau, founder of the Congregation of Holy Cross, expertly practiced Christian education himself while also training the early priests and brothers of Holy Cross in effective methods of Christian education. Grounded in a robust Christian anthropology and theology of salvation history, Moreau places imagination and memory at the first stage of Christian education; for Father Moreau imagination acts as the doorway through which revelation enters the human person and moves them towards conversion to and transformation in Christ. This paper will examine Moreau‚Äôs theology of the human person and revelation alongside his method of Christian education, illustrating how he understands and appeals to the human imagination as the doorway to Christian education. Understanding Moreau‚Äôs theology and practice of Christian education will thus allow for a more robust articulation of the role of imagination within Christian experience and its importance to the Church‚Äôs mission.

* The ‚ÄúGreat Questions‚Äù Curriculum, Character, and the Catholic Imagination
   * Abstract: This paper offers a ‚Äúreport from the field‚Äù on the Catholic imagination‚Äôs central role in the ‚ÄúGreat Questions‚Äù curriculum of Villanova University‚Äôs Humanities major, a 2003 interdisciplinary initiative to renew the Catholic intellectual tradition for twenty-first century undergraduates. With St. Augustine as model, Villanova developed a unique ‚Äúancient and new‚Äù approach that addresses contemporary existential questions with traditional resources in character-shaping seminars about the Human Person, Society, the Natural World, and God. After briefly grounding our ‚ÄúGreat Question‚Äù educational theory in the thought of Aquinas, Eric Voegelin, and John Paul II, the paper illustrates its dependence on literature and the Catholic imagination. First, it marks the organic emergence of a ‚Äúcanon‚Äù of Catholic literary artists from Dante to Tolkien whose imaginative works have addressed our intellectual community‚Äôs philosophic and theological questions. Second, the paper draws on contemplatives ancient and new‚ÄîAthanasius, Thomas Merton, Erik Varden‚Äîto describe our method of reading literary texts outside this Catholic artistic tradition. By focusing the imagination of students formed in a secular age, such works provide not only critical case studies of living as buffered selves in an atomized world (e.g. Leo Tolstoy‚Äôs *Death of Ivan Ilyich*) but also potentially formative imaginative experiences of transcendence to otherwise oblivious readers (e.g. hope in Wendell Berry‚Äôs *Hannah Coulter* or joy in Zadie Smith‚Äôs *Feel Free*). The overall goal of this pedagogically focused paper is thus to share an intellectual framework and set of educational practices involving the Catholic imagination that has proven both faithful and renovating.

* Catholic Legal Education and the Failure of Catholic Imagination
   * Abstract: Among the 197 law schools approved by the American Bar Association, 29 operate under Catholic auspices, yet few can credibly claim to reflect a genuinely Catholic identity in the legal education they provide to students. With one notable exception, these schools experienced a dramatic loss of identity in the 1960s-1970s when law school enrollments doubled in size and new faculty were hired largely without regard for Catholic mission. Instead of thinking that they had something unique and valuable to contribute to American legal practice, faculty at these schools simply parroted their secular peers in the courses they taught and the scholarship they pursued. This represents a failure of imagination. In its well-articulated anthropology (*Gaudium et Spes* 12-22), the Second Vatican Council offered an outline for how institutions of higher learning could be vibrantly Catholic while fulfilling their mission to share, preserve, and develop knowledge. Catholic institutions failed to take up the Council‚Äôs teaching as a means of forming the intellectual life of the university, opting instead for a facile rhetoric of social justice. This failure to engage the Catholic imagination can be remedied. Different legal systems and theories of jurisprudence are grounded in different anthropologies. Catholic law schools should introduce students to the normative and descriptive account of law provided by a Catholic anthropology. Beyond material consequences, the Catholic imagination (analogical, sacramental) proposes that concrete acts, including acts subject to legal regulation, take place against the backdrop of the eternal and transcendent from which all meaning ultimately derives.

* Tradition, Rupture, and the Dangers of Imagination
   * Abstract: This paper considers the meaning of tradition in a post-Christian world. Faced with the task of building Christian culture in the present cultural moment, Catholic imagination provides both a means by which to explore hopeful possibilities and a means by which one can fall into the trap of utopian or idealistic thinking. The paper proposes that the Catholic humanism of Walker Percy properly directs the potential of Catholic imagination towards its best aspirations.

* Metaphor and Imagination in the Facilitation of Therapeutic Change
   * Abstract: The goal of this presentation is to explore the role of metaphor and imagination in the facilitation of change in the practice of counseling and psychotherapy. Uses of metaphor and imagination in clinical practice are briefly described. Drawing upon the insights from psychology, clinical practice, and neuroscience, it is suggested that both metaphor and imagination can be viewed as fundamental cognitive processes. It is further suggested that these fundamental cognitive functions are rooted in a Catholic and theologically-informed view of finite persons, created in the Divine Image and designed to know and love God, who is Personal, yet Transcendent. Thus, it is suggested that metaphor and imagination, so central in wrestling with this Mystery of Faith, is also foundational in supporting the movement of persons toward increased levels of flourishing.",1,1734724821.0,philosophypodcasts,0,1.0,False

----------------------------------------------------------------------

When you decide to whiten your teeth, you may hope for an instant transformation. While many people enjoy brighter smiles, some might notice white spots on their teeth after the procedure. Understanding how long these white spots last and the factors that contribute to their presence is vital for anyone considering teeth whitening.

White spots on teeth, scientifically known as hypocalcifications, can appear after whitening treatments. Generally, these spots can last from a few days to several weeks, depending on a few key factors.

### Factors Influencing the Duration of White Spots

Several variables can impact how long the white spots stay on your teeth after whitening. By considering these factors, you can have a better idea of what to expect.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Whitening Method:** Different methods, such as in-office whitening or at-home kits, may produce varying results. Professional treatments might cause less post-whitening sensitivity and thus fewer white spots.
- **Duration of Treatment:** Longer exposure to whitening agents can cause more pronounced spots. If you exceed the recommended time for whitening gels, you may increase your chances of developing white spots.
- **Whitening Agent Concentration:** Stronger whitening agents can lead to more significant mineral loss in enamel, resulting in more prominent white spots.
- **Oral Hygiene Habits:** Proper dental care post-whitening can help speed up the fading of white spots. Good habits like brushing and flossing can minimize their presence.
- **Individual Tooth Enamel Health:** Your enamel‚Äôs condition before whitening plays a vital role. If your enamel is already damaged, you may be more susceptible to developing white spots.

### How to Minimize and Manage White Spots

If you notice white spots after whitening your teeth, don‚Äôt panic. There are strategies to manage and potentially minimize their appearance:

- **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water to help reduce the concentration of whitening agents on your teeth.
- **Fluoride Treatments:** Consider using fluoride toothpaste or treatments, which can help remineralize your enamel and reduce the appearance of white spots.
- **Dental Visits:** Schedule an appointment with your dentist to discuss your concerns. They can offer professional advice and treatments to help address white spots.
- **Limit Stain-Causing Foods:** For a few days post-whitening, try to avoid foods and drinks that can stain, like coffee, tea, and red wine, as they may cling to uneven surface areas.

### Expected Duration of White Spots

The duration of white spots after teeth whitening typically ranges from a few days to a month. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what you might experience:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **1-3 Days:** Initially, if spots appear, they may be temporary and fade quickly as your enamel adjusts to the whitening process.
- **1-2 Weeks:** Most people will notice their white spots beginning to diminish during this period, especially with proper oral care.
- **3-4 Weeks:** By this time, many individuals will see significant improvement in their appearance. However, some might still have lingering spots due to various factors.

It's essential to understand that white spots often improve over time. However, if the spots remain stubborn or worsen, consulting with your dentist is crucial. They can assess whether other underlying issues are impacting your dental health, like mineral imbalances or enamel defects.

While white spots on teeth after whitening can be concerning, they are usually temporary. Understanding the factors that influence their duration and taking proactive measures can greatly improve your results. Always keep open communication with your dental care provider and maintain good oral hygiene practices.

Understanding the Causes of White Spots on Teeth and Their Impact on Oral Health
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many people notice white spots on their teeth, particularly after undergoing whitening treatments. Understanding why these spots appear and their implications for oral health is essential for maintaining a healthy smile. Let‚Äôs explore the causes behind white spots on teeth and how they might affect your overall dental health.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Common Causes of White Spots on Teeth

White spots can have various origins, and it‚Äôs helpful to identify them to address the right dental care measures. Here are some of the most common causes:

- **Fluorosis:** This is a condition that occurs from consuming too much fluoride during childhood while teeth are still developing. It can cause discoloration that appears as white spots.
- **Decalcification:** When minerals are lost from the enamel due to poor oral hygiene or acids, it leads to decalcification, resulting in white spots.
- **Enamel Hypoplasia:** This condition happens when the enamel doesn‚Äôt form properly. It can be linked to various factors such as malnutrition during pregnancy or illness during childhood.
- **Dietary Choices:** High-acid or high-sugar diets can strip enamel, causing white spots to form. This may happen over time with the regular consumption of soda or citrus juices.
- **Tetracycline Use:** The use of certain antibiotics like tetracycline during childhood can also result in discoloration of teeth, including white spots.

### Testing and Diagnosing White Spots

Identifying white spots on teeth can be straightforward during a dental check-up. Your dentist may use specific tools and tests to diagnose the issue effectively. They might perform the following:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Visual Inspection:** A fresh examination can reveal the extent and condition of white spots.
- **X-rays:** Sometimes, X-rays may be needed to check for underlying issues that are not visible to the naked eye.
- **Dental Histories:** Discussing your dental history, including any past treatments and lifestyle habits, can aid in determining the cause.

### The Impact of White Spots on Oral Health

While white spots may not seem overly alarming, they can have various implications for your oral health. Here‚Äôs what to keep in mind:

- **Increased Risk of Cavities:** White spots often indicate areas where enamel has been compromised. These areas can be more prone to cavities if not managed properly.
- **Aesthetic Concerns:** Many individuals feel self-conscious about their white spots, affecting their confidence and willingness to smile.
- **Potential for Tooth Sensitivity:** Some people with white spots experience increased tooth sensitivity, especially to hot or cold foods and beverages.
- **Greater Importance of Oral Hygiene:** Maintaining excellent oral hygiene becomes critical. Regular brushing and flossing can help minimize the chances of further decay and spot progression.

### Addressing White Spots on Teeth

Once you've identified white spots on your teeth, managing them becomes a priority. Here are some effective strategies:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Professional Treatments:** Your dentist may recommend treatments like microabrasion, bonding, or even veneers to improve the appearance of your teeth.
- **Fluoride Treatments:** Applying fluoride can help strengthen areas of decalcification and can sometimes reverse early signs of enamel loss.
- **Maintain a Balanced Diet:** Reducing acidic and sugary foods can protect your enamel and minimize further demineralization.
- **Regular Dental Visits:** Routine check-ups help monitor the health of your teeth and allow for early intervention when necessary.

Understanding the causes of white spots on teeth and their impact on oral health is crucial for maintaining a beautiful smile. By taking proactive steps, you can effectively manage and treat these white spots to ensure a healthy mouth.

### Conclusion

White spots on teeth after whitening can be a common concern, but understanding their duration and underlying causes can empower you to take the right steps for your oral health. Typically, these white spots can last anywhere from a few days to several weeks, depending on individual factors like the extent of the whitening process and the individual's enamel condition.

The presence of white spots often indicates areas of demineralization, which can be influenced by factors such as your dental hygiene routine, eating habits, and even genetic predisposition. Maintaining a consistent and effective oral care regimen is vital, as it can aid in re-mineralizing your enamel and reducing the visibility of these spots over time.

It's essential to remember that your diet plays a significant role in the health of your teeth. Foods and drinks that are high in acidity or sugar can exacerbate the issue. Therefore, incorporating enamel-friendly foods such as dairy, leafy greens, and crunchy fruits and vegetables can support healthier teeth.

If you're concerned about lingering white spots, seeking guidance from a dental professional is always wise. They can provide personalized advice, recommend treatments, or suggest products that can help restore your smile's natural luster. Being proactive in your oral health journey keeps your teeth not only looking their best but also functioning properly for years to come. Remember, achieving a bright smile is not just about whitening; it's also about maintaining the health of your teeth for a lifetime.

Chapter 1: The Hollow Shimmer

The crystal chandeliers of Mar-a-Lago cast a hollow shimmer across the ballroom, their light catching on the rim of Ramona Singer's untouched glass of Pinot Grigio. She stood, a pillar of Gucci and Cartier, amidst a sea of her supposed confidantes ‚Äì fifty-plus women who shared her zip code, her hairdresser, and her penchant for overpriced lunches. Yet as the evening wore on, Ramona felt the weight of an unspoken truth settle upon her shoulders: she was drowning in a pool of superficiality.

""Darling, you simply must try the canap√©s,"" chirped Vivian, her lacquered nails clicking against her own wine glass. ""They're divine, aren't they, Ramona?""

Ramona's smile didn't quite reach her eyes. ""Oh, yes. Divine.""

The word tasted bitter on her tongue, much like the Pinot she'd been nursing all evening. Divine? What was divine about overpriced hors d'oeuvres served on silver platters by underpaid staff? What was divine about the vacuous chatter that surrounded her, a ceaseless stream of gossip and one-upmanship?

She excused herself, weaving through the crowd towards the powder room. The click of her Louboutins against the marble floor echoed in her ears, a staccato rhythm that seemed to mock her with each step. *Emp-ty. Emp-ty. Emp-ty.*

In the sanctuary of the powder room, Ramona braced herself against the sink, staring at her reflection in the gilded mirror. The face that looked back at her was flawless ‚Äì a masterpiece of Botox, fillers, and expert makeup application. But behind the carefully crafted fa√ßade, she saw something that made her heart clench: a void, a hollowness that no amount of expensive treatments could fill.

""What am I doing?"" she whispered to her reflection.

The door swung open, admitting a pair of her ""friends"" ‚Äì Beatrice and Cordelia, their laughter cutting off abruptly as they noticed Ramona.

""Oh, Ramona darling, there you are!"" Beatrice's voice was honey-sweet, but her eyes were sharp. ""We were just talking about you.""

""All good things, I hope,"" Ramona replied, her social mask slipping back into place with practiced ease.

Cordelia tittered, a sound like breaking glass. ""Of course, darling. Though we were wondering... that little business of yours, the, ah, wine venture? How is that going?""

The condescension in her tone was palpable. Ramona felt something shift inside her, a tectonic plate of her psyche grinding against years of accumulated pretense.

""It's going splendidly,"" she said, her voice cool. ""In fact, I was just thinking of expanding. Perhaps a line of organic, fair-trade coffee. Something with... substance.""

The word hung in the air between them, charged with meaning. Beatrice and Cordelia exchanged glances, their smiles faltering for a moment before reasserting themselves.

""How... innovative,"" Beatrice managed.

Ramona nodded, suddenly feeling claustrophobic in the opulent bathroom. ""If you'll excuse me, ladies. I think I need some air.""

She swept past them, out of the powder room, through the ballroom, and into the warm Florida night. The sea breeze hit her face, carrying with it the scent of salt and possibility. For the first time in years, Ramona Singer took a deep breath and allowed herself to acknowledge the truth:

She was suffocating in a world of her own making, and something had to change.

Chapter 2: Streets of Disillusion

The transition from the balmy nights of Palm Beach to the concrete canyons of Manhattan did little to quell the restlessness that had taken root in Ramona's soul. She found herself wandering the streets of her longtime home, seeing it with new eyes ‚Äì eyes that were slowly being stripped of the gilded blinders she'd worn for so long.

Fifth Avenue, once a glittering thoroughfare of aspiration, now seemed a garish display of excess. The windows of Bergdorf Goodman, usually a siren call of cashmere and couture, left her cold. She passed by Tiffany & Co., barely glancing at the iconic blue boxes that had once set her heart racing.

""What's happened to me?"" she murmured, earning a strange look from a passing tourist.

Her feet carried her further downtown, away from the manicured paths of Central Park and into the more eclectic streets of the Village. Here, the air was different ‚Äì charged with an energy that was at once foreign and oddly compelling. Street artists displayed their wares on blankets, the scent of incense wafted from tiny shops, and the sound of laughter spilled from crowded cafes.

It was outside one such cafe that fate, in its infinite wisdom, decided to intervene.

The man appeared out of nowhere, a saxophone case slung over his shoulder, his eyes hidden behind dark sunglasses despite the fading light. Ramona, lost in her thoughts, collided with him, her designer purse slipping from her shoulder.

""Oh! I'm so sorry, I wasn't looking where‚Äî""

""No harm done, pretty lady,"" the man said, his voice a smooth baritone that sent an unexpected shiver down Ramona's spine. He bent to retrieve her purse, handing it back with a smile that seemed to illuminate the twilight. ""You look like you could use this.""

Before Ramona could protest, he pressed something into her hand ‚Äì a small, intricately wrapped package that gleamed gold in the streetlight.

""I... thank you,"" Ramona stammered, uncharacteristically flustered. ""I'm Ramona.""

""Miles,"" he replied, tipping an imaginary hat. ""Pleasure to meet you, Ramona. Enjoy that little taste of magic. And if you're feeling adventurous later, follow the sound of the saxophone.""

With a wink that she felt rather than saw, Miles melted into the crowd, leaving Ramona standing on the sidewalk, clutching the mysterious gift and feeling, for the first time in years, a flutter of genuine excitement in her chest.

She looked down at the package ‚Äì a truffle, perhaps? Without allowing herself to overthink, she unwrapped it and popped it into her mouth. The rich, slightly earthy flavor bloomed on her tongue, nothing like the delicate morsels she was used to.

As she continued her walk, Ramona felt a warmth spreading through her body, a lightness in her step that she couldn't quite explain. The city around her began to shift, colors becoming more vibrant, sounds more melodic. She found herself giggling at the dance of shadows cast by street lamps, twirling on the sidewalk like a child.

In her haze, a sound caught her attention ‚Äì the faint, soulful notes of a saxophone, weaving through the city noise like a golden thread. Without conscious thought, Ramona began to follow it, her designer heels clicking a syncopated rhythm against the pavement.

The music led her to a nondescript door, unmarked save for a small blue note painted near the handle. Ramona hesitated for only a moment before pushing it open, stepping from the streets of her disillusionment into a world that would change everything.

Chapter 3: The Blue Note

The Blue Note was a portal to another dimension, one where the air was thick with music and possibility. As Ramona's eyes adjusted to the dimly lit interior, she felt as though she'd stepped into a living, breathing organism. The walls seemed to pulse with the rhythm of the quintet on stage, their music a heartbeat that synchronized with her own.

She made her way to the bar, her usual grace abandoned in favor of a wide-eyed wonder that made her look years younger. The bartender, a woman with skin the color of burnished mahogany and a smile that could melt ice, raised an eyebrow at her.

""First time here, sugar?"" she asked, her voice carrying over the music.

Ramona nodded, still taking in the scene. ""Is it that obvious?""

The bartender laughed, a rich sound that blended perfectly with the bass line. ""Like a diamond in a coal mine. I'm Ruby. What's your poison?""

Ramona opened her mouth to order her usual Pinot Grigio, but something stopped her. This wasn't a place for her usual. This was a place for new experiences, for stepping out of comfort zones.

""Surprise me,"" she said, surprising herself.

Ruby's eyes twinkled. ""Honey, I think you and I are going to get along just fine. How about we start you off with a Shirley Temple? Trust me, it'll go perfectly with the music.""

As Ruby set about preparing the drink, Ramona turned her attention back to the stage. The saxophone player ‚Äì Miles, she realized with a start ‚Äì was in the midst of a solo that seemed to defy the laws of physics. His fingers danced over the keys, coaxing out notes that soared and dipped, telling a story without words.

Ruby set a tall glass in front of her, the deep red of the drink garnished with a cherry that gleamed like a ruby. Ramona took a sip, the sweetness exploding on her tongue, mingling with the lingering earthiness of the truffle she'd eaten earlier.

""It's perfect,"" she said, and meant it.

As the night wore on, Ramona found herself drawn into conversations with the regulars ‚Äì artists, musicians, writers, and free spirits who seemed to look right past her designer label to the person underneath. For the first time in longer than she could remember, she felt *seen*.

When the set ended, Miles made his way to the bar, his face glistening with the exertion of his performance. He slid onto the stool next to Ramona, ordering a Roy Rogers with a wink at Ruby.

""So,"" he said, turning to Ramona. ""You found your way here after all.""

Ramona nodded, feeling a blush creep up her neck. ""I followed the music, just like you said. I've never heard anything so... so...""

""Soul-stirring?"" Miles supplied.

""Yes,"" Ramona breathed. ""It's like I'm hearing for the first time.""

Miles smiled, a slow, warm expression that made Ramona's heart skip a beat. ""That's the magic of jazz, baby. It speaks to the heart.""

As they talked, Ramona found herself opening up in a way she never had before. She told Miles about her life, her doubts, her fears. She confessed the emptiness she'd been feeling, the sense that there had to be more to life than country clubs and charity galas.

Miles listened without judgment, offering gentle wisdom and the occasional touch that sent sparks through Ramona's body. As dawn began to break, casting a rosy glow through the club's small windows, Ramona realized she'd spent the entire night talking, laughing, and truly connecting with another person.

She stepped out onto the street, blinking in the early morning light. The city looked different ‚Äì not because of whatever had been in that truffle (though she had her suspicions), but because she was seeing it through new eyes.

As she hailed a cab to take her back to her Upper East Side penthouse, Ramona knew that nothing would ever be the same again. She had taken the first step on a journey of self-discovery, guided by the smooth notes of a saxophone and the warmth of a Shirley Temple.

The blue note on the club's door caught her eye as the cab pulled away. It seemed to wink at her, a promise of adventures yet to come. Ramona Singer, socialite and reality TV star, was about to compose a new melody for her life ‚Äì it was going to be music to everyone's ears.

Chapter 4: Metamorphosis in B Flat

The weeks following Ramona's fateful night at The Blue Note unfolded like a jazz improvisation ‚Äì unpredictable, exhilarating, and utterly transformative. Her penthouse, once a shrine to modern minimalism and designer labels, began to take on a new character. Vintage jazz posters replaced abstract art, their vibrant colors and dynamic typography bringing life to the stark white walls. A record player, lovingly restored, took pride of place in the living room, its warm crackle a constant backdrop to Ramona's days.

But the most significant change wasn't in her surroundings ‚Äì it was in Ramona herself. Gone were the structured designer dresses, replaced by flowing vintage finds that allowed her to move, to breathe, to live. Her Pinot Grigio collected dust in the wine fridge, supplanted by a new addiction: the sweet, effervescent comfort of Shirley Temples, which she mixed herself with increasing expertise.

And then there was the cannabis.

It had started with that first, unknowing bite of the edible Miles had given her. The experience had been revelatory, opening doors in her mind she hadn't known existed. Now, under the gentle guidance of Ruby (who, it turned out, was something of an expert), Ramona was exploring this new world with the enthusiasm of a convert.

""Now, remember,"" Ruby cautioned one afternoon, as they sat in Ramona's newly boho-chic living room, ""it's all about respect. This isn't about getting wasted ‚Äì it's about opening your mind, expanding your consciousness.""

Ramona nodded seriously, watching as Ruby demonstrated how to roll a perfect joint. The ritual of it ‚Äì the careful breaking up of the fragrant buds, the delicate art of rolling ‚Äì fascinated her. It was so far removed from the sterile world of pills and prescribed medications she was used to, yet it felt infinitely more authentic.

As they sat back, sipping Shirley Temples and sharing the joint, Ramona felt a sense of peace settle over her. The music ‚Äì a Johnny Hodges ballad that Miles had recommended ‚Äì seemed to wrap around her like a warm blanket.

""I never knew,"" she said softly, ""that life could feel like this.""

Ruby smiled, her eyes crinkling at the corners. ""Baby, you ain't seen nothing yet.""

The Blue Note became Ramona's second home. She was there almost every night, soaking in the music, the atmosphere, the sheer *life* of the place. She made friends ‚Äì real friends, not the surface-level acquaintances of her old life. There was Zeke, the bartender with a PhD in philosophy who could mix a mean Roy Rogers while discussing Voltaire. Ella, the sultry singer whose voice could make angels weep. And always there was Miles.

Their relationship deepened with each passing day. He taught her about jazz ‚Äì its history, its legends, its soul. They had playful debates about bebop versus cool jazz, Miles defending the frenetic energy of Charlie Parker while Ramona argued for the smooth sophistication of Miles Davis (no relation, he'd assured her with a laugh).

But it wasn't all smooth sailing. Ramona's old friends, confused and somewhat scandalized by her transformation, began to distance themselves. She received fewer invitations to galas and luncheons, and when she did attend, she felt like a stranger in a world she once knew intimately.

One afternoon, as she was leaving her favorite vintage shop (where she'd just scored an amazing 1950s cocktail dress), she ran into Beatrice and Cordelia ‚Äì the same women she'd encountered in the powder room at Mar-a-Lago, a lifetime ago.

""Ramona?"" Beatrice's voice was a mix of shock and disdain. ""Is that... is that you?""

Ramona smiled, adjusting the strap of her cloth tote bag (another new addition to her wardrobe). ""In the flesh.""

Cordelia's eyes raked over her, taking in the flowing dress, the natural makeup, the relaxed posture. ""Darling, are you going through some sort of... midlife crisis?""

The old Ramona would have been mortified by such an encounter. She would have made excuses, would have rushed to assure them that this was just a phase, that she'd be back to normal soon.

But this Ramona? This Ramona threw back her head and laughed, a rich, genuine sound that turned heads on the busy street.

""Oh honey,"" she said, reaching out to pat Cordelia's arm, ""I'm not going through a crisis. I'm going through an awakening.""

She left them standing there, mouths agape, as she practically floated down the street. In her bag was a new book of piano sheet music ‚Äì she'd started taking lessons, fulfilling a childhood dream long forgotten. The thought of the clumsy but joyful sounds that would soon fill her apartment made her smile.

That night, as she sat at The Blue Note, nursing a Shirley Temple and letting the music wash over her, Miles slid into the seat next to her. His fingers, still warm from caressing the saxophone keys, brushed against hers as he signaled Ruby for his usual Roy Rogers.

""You're looking more at home every day,"" he said, his voice a low rumble that sent shivers down her spine.

Ramona smiled, feeling a blush creep up her neck. ""I feel more at home every day. It's like... I've been sleeping my whole life, and I'm finally waking up.""

Miles nodded, his eyes twinkling. ""Jazz has a way of doing that to a person. It gets under your skin, into your blood. Pretty soon, you're breathing in 4/4 time.""

They laughed together, the sound blending seamlessly with the music around them. As the night wore on, Ramona found herself opening up more and more. She told Miles about her past ‚Äì the whirlwind of her reality TV days, the emptiness of her socialite life, the growing sense that there had to be more.

""I used to think I had it all,"" she confessed, twirling the cherry in her drink. ""But now I realize I had nothing that really mattered.""

Miles listened intently, his dark eyes full of understanding. ""Sometimes,"" he said slowly, ""we have to lose our way to find our true path. Sounds like you're on that path now, Ramona Blue.""

The nickname sent a thrill through her. ""Ramona Blue,"" she repeated, tasting the words. ""I like that.""

Chapter 5: The Blue Period

As summer faded into autumn, Ramona's transformation continued. Her penthouse became a cozy den of vintage finds and musical paraphernalia. She practiced piano daily, her clumsy fingers slowly gaining confidence on the keys. The sounds of Thelonious Monk and Bill Evans filled her home, replacing the silence that had once reigned.

But as Ramona blossomed in her new world, she found herself increasingly at odds with her old one. Invitations to galas and luncheons became scarce, and when she did attend, she felt like an outsider looking in.

One crisp October afternoon, she ran into Beatrice and Cordelia outside Bergdorf's. Their eyes widened at the sight of her, taking in her bohemian dress and wavy hair.

""Ramona?"" Beatrice's voice was a mix of shock and disdain. ""Darling, what on earth has happened to you?""

Ramona smiled, adjusting the strap of her vintage leather bag. ""Life happened, Bea. Beautiful, messy, wonderful life.""

Cordelia's perfectly plucked eyebrows furrowed. ""But your hair... your clothes... You look like you've been shopping at a thrift store!""

""I have,"" Ramona replied, her voice light but firm. ""And I've never felt more myself.""

As she walked away, leaving her former friends gaping on the sidewalk, Ramona felt a mixture of sadness and liberation. She was changing, evolving, and not everyone from her past would be able to come along for the ride.

That night at The Blue Note, Ramona overheard two regulars gossiping at the bar:

""That's the socialite, right? Slumming it with us common folk?""

""Bet she'll get bored and go back to her penthouse soon enough.""

The words stung more than Ramona wanted to admit. She rushed out of the club, tears pricking at her eyes. The cool night air hit her face as she burst onto the street, her heart pounding.

""Ramona!"" Miles' voice cut through the noise of the city. He had followed her out, concern etched on his face. ""Hey, what's wrong?""

She turned to him, her carefully applied mascara leaving dark trails down her cheeks. ""I don't belong anywhere anymore,"" she choked out. ""I'm too 'jazz' for my old life, too 'Upper East Side' for this one. I'm... I'm lost, Miles.""

Miles looked at her for a long moment, his eyes soft with understanding. Then, without a word, he pulled out his saxophone.

""Listen,"" he said, and began to play.

The first notes were high and clear, reminiscent of the glittering soirees of Ramona's past. Then, seamlessly, Miles transitioned into a low, soulful riff that spoke of late nights in smoky clubs and early mornings full of possibility.

""That high part? That's the old you ‚Äì the parties, the glamour, the life you knew,"" Miles explained between phrases. ""And the low part? That's the new you ‚Äì deep, soulful, real. Apart, they're just notes. But together...""

He played again, this time weaving the two melodies into a single, beautiful harmony that made Ramona's heart soar.

""Together, they make music,"" Miles finished softly. ""You don't have to choose, Ramona Blue. You just have to find your harmony.""

In that moment, with the stars twinkling above and the distant sounds of the city creating their own urban symphony, Ramona felt something shift inside her. She wasn't losing herself; she was becoming more herself than she'd ever been.

Chapter 6: Composing Ramona

Inspired by Miles' words, Ramona threw herself into bridging her two worlds. She began organizing a charity gala to be held at The Blue Note, determined to bring her old friends into her new reality.

Planning the event was a delicate balance. She wanted to maintain the soul of The Blue Note while making it accessible to her more conservative acquaintances. Ruby proved an invaluable ally, her practical nature tempering Ramona's wilder ideas.

""Honey, I love your enthusiasm,"" Ruby said one afternoon as they pored over decoration ideas, ""but I don't think we need a full New Orleans-style parade. Let's start smaller, okay?""

Ramona laughed, struck once again by how much she valued Ruby's friendship. It was so different from the superficial relationships of her past ‚Äì honest, supportive, and real.

As the date of the gala approached, Ramona's excitement was tinged with nervousness. She had invited her old circle, unsure of how many would actually show up. And then there was the matter of her performance.

In a moment of what she now recognized as either bravery or madness, Ramona had decided to play the piano at the gala. Miles had been working with her on a simple but heartfelt piece, a musical representation of her journey.

The night of the gala arrived, clear and cool. The Blue Note had been transformed ‚Äì string lights and fresh flowers softened the edges, but the soul of the place remained intact. Ramona stood at the entrance, a vision in a vintage Chanel dress paired with a hand-beaded necklace she'd bought from a street vendor.

Her heart leapt as she saw familiar faces from her old life begin to arrive. Beatrice and Cordelia were among the first, their eyes wide as they took in the scene.

""Ramona, darling,"" Beatrice air-kissed her cheeks, ""this is... quite something.""

Ramona smiled, genuine warmth in her eyes. ""Thank you for coming, Bea. I can't wait for you to experience this place.""

As the club filled up, an interesting alchemy began to take place. Ramona watched as her socialite friends, initially stiff and uncomfortable, began to relax. The regulars, for their part, were going out of their way to make the newcomers feel welcome.

She saw Ruby deep in conversation with a Wall Street type, both of them laughing. Zeke, the philosophical bartender, was explaining the finer points of mixing a Roy Rogers to a cluster of fascinated Upper East Side ladies.

And then it was time. Ramona made her way to the stage, her heart pounding. She sat at the piano, took a deep breath, and began to play.

The first notes were hesitant, a bit unsure. But as she continued, she felt herself relaxing into the music. This was her story, her journey, and she was sharing it with everyone she cared about.

Halfway through the piece, Miles joined her on stage, his saxophone weaving around her melody, elevating it into something truly beautiful. As they played together, Ramona felt a sense of completion, of coming home to herself.

The final notes faded away, and for a moment, there was silence. Then the club erupted in applause. Ramona looked out at the crowd, saw the genuine smiles on faces both familiar and new, and felt her heart swell.

Epilogue: Ramona's Rhythm

Months later, Ramona stood in her penthouse, surveying the changes. The space was now a perfect blend of her two worlds ‚Äì a Monet hung next to a framed Blue Note poster, a crystal vase filled with fresh flowers sat atop her beloved record player.

She was dressed for a night out, a silk scarf from her Herm√®s collection artfully draped over a vintage jazz t-shirt. As she applied a final touch of lipstick, her phone buzzed with a text from Miles: ""Ready when you are, Ramona Blue.""

Ramona smiled at her reflection. The woman looking back at her was familiar and yet wonderfully new ‚Äì her eyes bright with purpose, her posture relaxed and confident.

As she stepped out into the New York night, the city's rhythm seemed to match her own heartbeat. She was no longer just existing in this concrete jungle; she was part of its song.

At The Blue Note, she took her place on stage with Miles and the rest of the band. Her fingers found the piano keys, and as the first notes rang out, Ramona closed her eyes and let the music flow through her.",2,1734724108.0,real_writers_of_bravo,0,1.0,False

The first one is my habit of eating a pastry with a cup of black coffee for breakfast. My breakfasts are generally pretty sweet, but I prefer it that way over eating a bigger meal, and it gives me just enough energy for the next meal.

  
The second habit is eating one meal noticeably higher in calories than the others. My calorie distribution is kind of a mixed bag. I often eat something bigger for my second or third meal compared to other things I eat throughout the day. This meal can sometimes be something kind of unhealthy like a small homemade italian pizza.

  
The third recent habit of mine is drinking a 1L-1,5L teapot of green tea between my second and third meal. I don't add any sugar to the tea. I like doing this a lot since drinking something warm really makes waiting for the next meal a lot easier ",1,1734724077.0,diet,1,1.0,False

1hiryxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1hiryxd/aio_over_my_bf_going_out/,AIO over my bf going out? ,"Very sorry for the very long post‚Ä¶ 

Well, taking only the title into consideration, then yes, I would be OR. 

I‚Äôm baffled at my decision to post here, but I feel like a burden to my friends already and I don‚Äôt want to burden them anymore.

Long story short, me (33F) and my bf (40M) have been together for 3 years. We‚Äôve both been in pretty serious relationships before, which ended in tragedy for both of us and left us with some trauma. 

Long story‚Ä¶ Long. 

Tale as old as time, as far as relationships go. He is avoidant, I am anxious. 

At the beggining, when we first met and started to know each other, I kind of sensed the avoidant part of him. But I was eager to work more on myself (been working for a while at the moment), to be less anxious, more receptive and relaxed. 

I have decided to talk at the beggining about my expectations, my boundaries, my triggers and my trauma (like three weeks in, after seeing each other almost daily and believing that we were in ‚Äúawe‚Äù with each other). 

Stuff started to come up. Two months in the relationship, my best friend found him on a dating app, ‚Äúrecently active‚Äù. I invited him for a coffee, told him about the situation and asked him about how he sees us, our relationship, what he expects from me and us and if he still wanted to explore. I would be okay with any answer, but I needed to know the truth. 

He told me he didn‚Äôt want anything from anyone but me, that he wanted to be in a relationship with me and that he used the app to show someone how it works and that he wouldn‚Äôt use it anymore. 

I reluctantly bought it. 

One month later, the exact same thing happened again. I wasn‚Äôt as mature as the first time and made a fuss about it. He told me it was for work (he works with apps and websites and they probably need to know how other apps and websites work, I guess, or so I was told), so I, again, reluctantly bought it. 

So, trying not to make this a novel, shit still happened along the way. 

I had a huge work achievement, wanted to celebrate with him, he was invited to a party at a friends house and said I couldn‚Äôt go. One week later he told me his ex was also there, and the party was between him, his friend, his ex and his ex‚Äôs best friend. Two weeks later he tells me they also went over to his ex‚Äôs best friend in the night. 

A year later, he‚Äôs confident enough to give me his phone password. One day, I check his phone and see a notification from another ex. I didn‚Äôt enter the convo and decided to ask him about it the next day. 

He told me it didn‚Äôt happen. When I told him what I saw, he told me it was nothing. When I asked him to show me what they talked about, the convo was already deleted. I told him how much it hurts. He hugs me and tells me he knows he fucked up and will never do it again. That what he did was a defensive reaction, because he knew I would be upset and jealous. 

At this moment, I was second guessing my mind. I was definitely OR, it was just my jealous and anxious type, which I had to work on more. So I bought it. 

The very next day, my anxiety was still there (obviously?). I checked his phone again, saw another notification from her. I told myself ‚Äúhe knows, he will tell me, I will wait‚Äù. I waited for a total of ~12 hours. I know, not much. He didn‚Äôt say anything so I asked him again. He told me they didn‚Äôt speak anymore. I ask him again to show me. The convo was deleted once again. 

I know, that should‚Äôve been the moment to end things. But maybe some might get me. I knew I had problems with my jealousy and anxiety and I wanted to work them out. I kept second guessing myself because honestly, I didn‚Äôt like my anxious way. I wanted to be different. To feel different. I wanted to be relaxed and secure, and so I always thought that I had to work that through. 

I concluded my anxiety was the problem and decided I was the one who needs to work on their behaviour. 

Some other few months in, we were at one of my cousins bday party. We were at a club, all of us having a really good time, I was feeling good about myself and the relationship I was in. 

Enter sexy chick. She went to talk to my bf. I decided to not get involved, to give him my trust and let him stop it. So I went outside. A few moments later, another family member comes out to me and tells me they‚Äôre still there, that my bf bought drinks to sexy chick and her wing girl and that they saw them on their phones. 

I went mad. 

I went inside, waited for him to finish his conversation with this girl and then asked him about WTF was he on about? I asked to show me his phone. He acted defensive, started being angry and left. I left an hour after and, well, checked his phone. Turns out they followed each other on IG. 

What I felt at that moment was a mix: anger, sadness, pity, anger over the pitiness. Directed at him, but mostly at myself. 

The next day, he felt guilty. He told me a thousand times how embarassed and ashamed he felt. That when he drinks too much, he can‚Äôt control himself and that his boundaries just fall. 

I bought that. I bought it because I myself cannot control myself when I drink too much. Though, not like this. I can‚Äôt control my sadness, rage, or happiness. I either start crying or laughing uncontrollably. But I never have and (hopefully) never will flirt with another while I‚Äôm in a relationship. 

Fast forward, while other miniscule stuff happened. Well, compared to what had happened already. 

Today he went to his work Christmas party. I was already anxious about it, about how we much he will drink and how he will not control himself. 

But today is more. I have, just yesterday, buried a close relative of mine. I have cared for him for the last 2 months, and although his death did not come as a surprise, it was still rough. He came with me at everything, even took a day off, which I highly appreciated, but grieve doesn‚Äôt just go like that. I didn‚Äôt want to be alone tonight. 

If the situation was reversed, I would have cancelled the whole ordeal and stayed at home. But that‚Äôs me, and I don‚Äôt really expect anyone to do as me. 

I was anxious about being alone at home tonight, this very night. I asked him what time he might be at home. He got defensive and told me ‚ÄúMaybe 5 am? What to do you want me to tell you? Tell me so we could fix things.‚Äù. I asked him to mind his alcohol and to not get pass those boundaries, at least. I asked to come home somewhat sober. To come home maybe at a proper time? I get it‚Äôs the Christmas party, but I also wanted my relative to be here for Christmas. 

If relationships are not for support in these moments, then what are they for? Only sex and good times? 

Yes, I was expecting him to take that decision without me uttering my expectations. I was expecting him to tell me ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, darling, I won‚Äôt be long, I won‚Äôt be drunk.‚Äù. Instead, when he left we were pretty much fighting. And I, again, feel bad about having a freaking reaction and having him leave with a sore taste. 

Thank you for reading and for maybe, leaving a comment. I don‚Äôt expect to be illuminated tonight, but I appreciate anyone and everyone reading through my ramblings. I pretty much know the answer, I am just too afraid maybe? to do it. 

I am still not fully aware of the reasons I keep on going. But if someone resonates with what I‚Äôve written, trust yourself. Trust your gut. Trust it at the very beggining. It just gets blurry over time and it‚Äôs harder to make a conscious decisions. ",1,1734723899.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False
1hiryg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hiryg3/am_i_going_insane/,Am I going insane?,"Hey Reddit,
I never imagined I‚Äôd be here, spilling my thoughts to strangers online, but I've hit a breaking point‚Äîemotionally and mentally. What I‚Äôm about to share might seem crazy, but I assure you it‚Äôs real. It all began about three weeks ago when I was heading back to my dorm. 

Let me introduce myself. I‚Äôm Cassie, a 21-year-old college student at NYU, juggling classes, a part-time job, and occasionally trying to have a social life. My life was pretty ordinary‚Äîuntil that one day, I spotted him: a tall guy in a dark hoodie always lurking just out of sight, whether I was waiting for the subway, studying at the library, or grabbing coffee late at night. It started as a slight feeling in my gut like someone was watching me. But soon, I began to see him everywhere.  I tried to dismiss it, telling myself it was just my imagination. I mean, it‚Äôs a big city, and hoodies are everywhere.
But one day, as the subway car door closed, I saw him at the far end, staring in, and my heart sank. His face was expressionless, but his eyes‚ÄîI‚Äôll never forget those eyes‚Äîwere dark and intense. It felt as if he could see right through me.  From that moment on, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling. Every time I glanced over my shoulder, there he was, sometimes barely concealed behind a streetlight or a group of people. At first, I told myself it wasn‚Äôt real; that I was just an overwhelmed college student starting to lose it. But with each passing day, my anxiety grew into full-blown dread. I stopped walking home at night and switched to rideshare, but each time I looked in the rearview mirror, I half-expected to see him looming behind me, his shadow stretching ominously over the backseat.  I confided in my roommate, Melanie, hoping she could offer some clarity. She laughed, rolled her eyes, and called it a ""New York syndrome."" She didn‚Äôt take it seriously, brushing me off like I was being overdramatic. But I was not making this up anymore.

I decided to seek some comfort online like many do in tough times. The Reddit community seemed to excel at unravelling mysteries, so I found myself in a thread about urban legends, aptly titled ‚ÄúDoes This Happen to Anyone Else?‚Äù I began to share my thoughts, detailing the figure that lurked and the dread that was slowly gnawing at my sanity.  Responses flooded in, some sympathetic and others outright dismissive, but one stood out. A user named ‚Äú[redacted]‚Äù replied, ‚ÄúIf you see him it‚Äôs too late, he chose you.‚Äù The comment sent a chill down my spine, and I felt my heart race. I clicked on the user‚Äôs profile, which contained only a series of cryptic posts about feeling hunted, discussing shadows that seemed to linger. It took mere moments for a disturbing realization to hit me: I wasn‚Äôt alone in this. 
As days passed, the shadow creature morphed into a haunting presence in my life. I struggled to concentrate on my assignments or enjoy evenings with friends. I was caught in a cycle of paranoia, careful to stay within well-lit areas. I began to skip classes. Melanie noticed my decline, urging me to speak with campus counselling, but the thought of sounding insane terrified me‚Äîwhat if they locked me away?  Then came the night I reached my breaking point. It was a Wednesday, and I got home from work late, adrenaline coursing through me. In a moment of defiance‚Äîand desperation‚ÄîI decided to confront him. Maybe if I showed him I wasn‚Äôt afraid anymore, he‚Äôd leave me alone. I put on my most vibrant jacket, a deep red that was meant to exude courage. Determined to banish my fear, I walked down my usual path, eyes wide open.  There he was, slumped against a street wall, head down, the hoodie casting a shadow over his face. My heart raced. I crossed the street and then paused, my heart pounding as I felt him lift his head slightly. He was finally in view, and a gasp escaped my lips.

His face was gaunt and sunken, his eyes hollow‚Äîdisconcertingly empty, as if they held all the secrets of the world and none at all.

‚ÄúWhy are you always following me?‚Äù I shouted into the cold night, my voice shaking.

A pause hung in the air. He didn‚Äôt move, just stared. A smirk slowly spread across his lips, sending chills through me. ‚ÄúYou feel it, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù he finally said, his voice a sinister whisper that seemed to seep from every shadow around us.

As the shadows deepened and swirled around him, I turned and ran, as fast and as I could and safely made it back to my dorm. That was 2 days ago.

If you're reading this, please tell me‚Äîhow do I escape this madness? Should I leave the city? Wait it out? Or is there no escape at all? Because right now, I regret stepping into the shadows.

Sincerely,  
Cassie

P.S. I hope this reaches someone before it‚Äôs too late.",3,1734723860.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I started off a looooong time ago with one called mustache coffee. The coffee was excellent but a bit pricey. They upped their charge and I backed off to try other subs. I tried a bunch. Most recently I tried Atlas and I thought they were... kinda bad actually. The beans were much cheaper but tasted a little burnt and just underwhelming (not to mention they're another of those services that don't let you cancel your sub online, you have to email them).

I wanted to find another good one, I missed good beans. So I was about to cave in and go back to mustache after years but instead took a quick look at coffee subs ranked and saw atlas on a LOT of lists. What's the general consensus here?

# PART 1 - CONSPIRACIONIST

So, wait- Conspiracionist? Wasn't this about FNaF AR? Well, I got this really important explanation for that.

In Security Breach there's a room hidden behind a Foxy poster that leads into the daycare attendant's room, there we find lots of things, in the room where Balloon World is found, there are some clothes hanging in a wall, those are adult clothes when compaired to Gregory's height.

It's pretty shocking at first, this room seems to be Gregory's, untill we realize something, in a table close to a decapitated staff bot, we find a thumbscrew, just like one that Vanessa ordered in the Scrapped Emails, which were threated as *leaked stuff from FNaF AR* untill Illumix left the game to rot (untill the game was officially closed), maybe this is connecting these two.

Luis works at IT based ON Luis himself:

>I had no idea you were into IT stuff. *I always think my job sounds so boring*, but you were so interested it made me start thinking, hey, maybe IT is cool after all. Or maybe you're just a good listener. Anyway, it was nice to have some in-person time. Maybe we can do it again soon. I still owe you that coffee I keep saying we should get.

Vanessa saying that he works in Marketing on the CD 1 could be one of the multiple miscomunications that Scott had with Steel Wool Studios or rather Vanessa not knowing well enough Luis, placing this tape prior to that talk with Luis that I quoted previously, which I'd like to think to be the right answer, but I'd say it's just a mistake.

So, with that in mind, Luis is the one hiding in that room, and he could be the arcade conspiracionist, after all, the duffel bag is in the Daycare Attendant room.

With that in mind, this would explain something  very easely.

After FNaF AR, Luis went to the Pizzaplex and started working there as a technician, one day he inspected the arcades and noticed something weird going on with the Princess Quest Arcades, Balloon World Arcade, the Chica's Feeding Frenzy Arcade and the Monty Gold AR-Cade connecting them and making a conspiracy, hiding in the Daycare Attendant Room, looking for more clues and to save the princess, but he failed and was fired.

# PART 2 - DATE

With that out of the way, when is this game set on?

Well, thanks to the fact that the Pizzaplex is mentioned as opened we know for a fact that it happens after FNaF Help Wanted, where the Pizzaplex is just under construction, but wait, it's in early phases of construction and if it opens in May (according to Tales from the Pizzaplex) then The Pizzaplex started its construction in Winter 2028, it was in getting finished in 2029 and it opened in May 2030, placing FNaF AR at earliest in 2030.

So, thanks to the Scrapped E-mails that I already explained to be still be part of the games timeline, and so, we know that this game is set in September 1 to 16:

***FNaF AR: Special Delivery - Scrapped E-Mails - SG-MainStory-068: ""no subject""***

With this in mind it could be anywhere from 2030 to SB, but it's prior to Vanessa's change to being part of the Security Guards of the Pizzaplex. Now, thanks to GGY, story set in January on the 3rd or 2nd year of the Pizzaplex, we know that FNaF AR happens prior to the third year and is set in the second or first year.

Now, here's a quick summary of GGY:

>Tony was looking at the rain as the class passed through, his teacher had left an assignment of making a story, Toby and his friends Ellis, his best friend, and Gregory, a recent friend, they took nicknames to talk to eachother while they writed the story, and by they, I mean Tony. After school, Tony and friends went to the Pizzaplex, where Tony found out about GGY, someone with the highest scores on all the arcades and games, after a short talk with an employee of the pizzaplex he found out that GGY hadn't cheated on the games, he'd beated them fair, no hacking, but after hours. He asked in a forum for GGY , getting answered by someone under the nickname of ""Morrigan99"", he stole a security pass to check the passess of the pizzaplex to see any info. about GGY, finding out he has an hacked Play Pass with which he had let 3 people, whom Tony could just recognize the name Mary, that day he met with Morrigan99, who turned out to be a girl named Crystal who warned him of how dangerous GGY was. Tony ignored Crystal and wrote the story about him, after finishing and giving it to his friends he found out that Mary was a school counselor who went missing recently, but she wasn't the only one, Raelynn and Treena, both names that had the first 3 letters appearing in the Play Pass that GGY had, he caused their disappearence. The following day, before he could tell Ellis about his findings, he stopped him telling him that him and Gregory had changed slightly the story, and with slightly I mean entirely, he couldn't change it because it was too late and he needed to present it that way that same day. Later that day he was given detention because, to learn more about Mary, Treena and Raelynn, he had sneeked to Mrs. Hawkins's office. There, Gregory invited Tony to the pizzaplex with the promise of forgetting the problems and having a good time.

Gregory is obviously GGY, that's clear, Tony most likely died lmao- Now, there's really not a specific timeframe for GGY to happen, but we got a season, Fall, probably October.

It's during the school year because of, well- the story going around that specific detail, thanks to the fact that there are lots of rain and stuff, we know that sets the story prior or after Winter, thanks to this quote we know it's a couple of months after school year began:

>‚ÄúRab‚Äù was a relatively new friend. Spotting the unfamiliar kid who‚Äôd looked a little lost at the start of the school year a couple months before, Tony had introduced himself just to be friendly.  
***Tales from the Pizzaplex 5 - The Bobbiedots Conclusion - Page 8***

A ""couple of months"" is 2 to 4 months prior to the story, it's prior to winter that's clear, School Year begain in August, 2 months later it's October, 3 is November, 4 is December. Now, what's the most likely date? Based on the rain, October, but wait, 4 months prior to the story is when Mary went missing, she needed to have meet Greg for him to look for her and have her in the look, so, it's in December.

We know it's around 2 or 3 years after the pizzaplex opened because of this detail in the story:

>The counselor list was long, but each name had a date to indicate the counselor‚Äôs tenure at the school. Only four of the names had dates within the last couple years. Tony figured those were the only ones that were relevant; the Pizzaplex wasn‚Äôt even around before then.  
***Tales from the Pizzaplex 5 - The Bobbiedots Conclusion - Page 60***

So, the pizzaplex was opened a couple of years prior to GGY, which is 2 (or 3, depending on who you ask) years prior to the story, yet we know it's 3 because of the fact that ""the pizzaplex wasn't even around before then"", Mary had started working 3 years prior, which quite indicates that it's 3 years prior.

That's it... Until we realize that there's a date marked in the teaser trailer, September the second, *Monday*, which years have that?

https://preview.redd.it/m4gm9r0n228e1.png?width=457&format=png&auto=webp&s=019c9581ef02fcd1bfac3e2f7611b7857de6d4e1

Well...

* 2019
* 2024
* 2030
* 2041

And more onwards.

So, FNaF AR happens most likely in 2030, this automatically debunks FNaF AR happening in 2020 too, and so, yeah, that's it.

# PART 3 - E-MAILS

The E-mails give a straight forward story.

Our story begins with Fazbear entertainment having glitches in their systems:

>Due to technical complications, our mail server may be directing email to incorrect recipients.

>If you receive an email that is not addressed to you, please forward it to the intended recipient and notify the IT department immediately.

>As a friendly reminder, reading email that was not intended for your eyes is a violation of Fazbear Entertainment's company policy, and you may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including immediate termination. That policy remains in effect.

>Please do not read email that is not your own. Thank you for your cooperation as we resolve this technical complication.¬†  
***FNaF AR: Special Delivery - E-Mails - Staff Advisory: Mail Server***

Then we're shown to a talk between Jimmy and Lisa, some animatronic pieces that hadn't arrived at time, 3 days and those parts didn't arrive, untill in what seems to be the fourth day in the morning, Lisa thought these pieces were replacement pieces, but Jimmy confirmed they weren't, these pieces had been tempered with, why? Well, because the next message after this complainment the animatronics had started acting strange, like- they work like they are supposed yes, but they look at the employees from time-to-time, following them with the eyes when they aren't supposed to do that and Bonnie ate a cat.

But when Lisa informed of the Bonnie incident, Jimmy wasn't an employee of DLZ Shipping Solutions anymore, something had happened to him.

Now, the main story outside the Scrapped E-Mails begins with Luis talking to Vanessa, telling her to not do weird investigations during work hours, then we cut to a chat between Raha and Mark, both talking about how the animatronics creep them out, the following day Daniel Rocha asks for Power Tools, being denied because only Raha is certified to use them, then he proceeds to ask her for help to remove the circuit boards of the animatronics to send them to Steve, and so, they do.

When Steve finishes scanning them he gets kicked out of the system and gets an ""unknown error"", Fazbear Entertainment gets notified and stops all work because of those circuit boards, it seems like something has gone wrong.

What happened? Well, remember that the animatronics had been tempered with? Well, It's quite obvious that Vanessa intercepted the package and put the Glitchtrap Virus within' their Circuit Boards, and when Steve scanns them it enters the system, causing Fazbear to alert.

This sets the E-Mail ""system glitch"" in September First based on the list previously shown.

So, the prologue must be around August 26 to 30 and the story goes from August 30 to September something, yeah. So, back to what I was saying.

September 2nd - Fazbear notices Anna that she should stop all actions

September 3rd- Luis talks to Vanessa about her searching ""help"", the same day Anna and Steven were talking about the message of Fazbear

September 4th- Mark sends a message talking about how it'll all be ok, but is replied by Raha that it's a big job, the same day she asks Steve what did he scan and answered the obvious, just what Daniel brought.

September 5th- Luis keeps sending messages to Vanessa

September 6th- Daniel finds out that it wasn't just a glitch, it was a virus, Glitchtrap had entered the system

September 7th- Another message of Luis

September 8th-10th Steven starts comunicating with Jim to see if he can help

Now, here's when the story ends in the released E-Mails, but with the scrapped we got a continuation of this with further explanation of stuff.

V\_A, who is most likely Vanessa A. Takes the role of Jim, who had been fired days ago, she'd ask for access to the system, Steven tells the crew about this, Mark confirms is from Fazbear, V\_A says she managed to isolate the virus and Mark is told that the virus was fully deleted.

But someone hacks into the system, Luis says it's ""\_pizzaplex"" who seems to be connected to Vanessa, Daniel, Mark, Anna and Raha are locked out of the system and they want to talk to Jimmy, all of this happened in September 15th and Sep. 16th.

Who is ""\_pizzaplex""? Well, *not* Vanessa, because, as pointed by FuhNaff, Patient 46 is the one who takes that role, so, \_pizzaplex is Patient 46, who is Patient 46? Thanks to the story from Tales from the Pizzaplex, GGY, we know that Gregory is GGY and Patient 46, this would set Curse of Dredbear prior to this, in the first year of the Pizzaplex or straight up in that same year just- prior, because there she mentions how she has found someone who would work as what Mimic wanted.

This basically explains it all. Untill-

>Hey Tristan,

>We've been getting some weird reports here in Customer Service that I don't really know how to respond to.

>A handful of our more hardcore users of the service have been reporting service calls from an animatronic that isn't appearing anywhere in our database. Some kind of vintage Bonnie model. A couple of people have mentioned a really bad smell from it as well.

>Is it possible some old second hand model somehow made it into our deployment rotation?  
***FNaF AR: Special Delivery - E-Mails - Couple of weird customer reports***

That was Springtrap, so, he wasn't made by Fazbear, who made it? Well, I'd say that's fault of rather Vanessa or Gregory, why? Glitchtrap is mimicking him, having his suit and corpse would basically make the process of imitating him fully more easier, and wait! Where do we see a character that looks like springtrap, is confirmed to use the Withered Spring Bonnie suit and has a corpse inside? Security Breach's Burntrap.

Yup, the mask and almost all the suit is made out of that, why almost and not all? Well, because the fans have found pieces from the Nightmares, Glamrock Freddy (And Glam. Endos).

That could've been retconed with RUIN, but I'm not so sure about how to feel about that other Mimic endo, maybe the endo was always the same of The Mimic but the suit and the corpse were out of the AR stuff, I'm not really sure, but I got two options:

Burntrap is:

* The Mimic from RUIN but he just has the fake William corpse and the Spring Bonnie Suit from Special Delivery
* A mix of Glamrock Freddy, The Nightmare Endo, Withered Spring Bonnie from AR and The Mimic from the Epilogues, after it was destroyed it rearmed itself with old pieces

I'd stay with the first one.

But, what about Golden Freddy?

Fazbear knew him, maybe not as a paranormal entity beacause of Help Wanted lacking of him (the animatronic), but rather because of it being the one causing ""The Big Bite"" and appearing in Freddy's as a secondary attraction and was most likely used by William in FNaF 2 to kill the DCI, explaining why he looks so.. Glitchy, because of the incidents surrounding it.

# PART 4 - DLC

So, FNaF AR: Special Delivery has an DLC, a DLC that contains something very, very, *very* interesting.

""The Fazbear Circus"", this is the new name and rebrand of the Carnival, basically Fall Fest 2, the one we see in Help Wanted 2 most of the time, we know it's from the current Fazbear because we see Ballora and an alt-GF skin, and uhh, the fact that we get the animatronics as a reward for playing and beating the DLC.

Thanks to the fact that the Carnival is intact outside as seen in a window:

So, this is most deffinitively prior to the fire seen in Help Wanted 2.

With this said, yeah, the carnival was back and now is named ""The Fazbear Circus"", or at least the attraction is, it's pretty interesting to have it named and stuff, and we also know that it was burned after FNaF SD, at earliest in Fall 2031, it was most deffinitively prior to the Pizzaplex closing, I mention this because in the minigame where we see the fire begin there are still the characters of the pizzaplex.

Before finishing, I need to mention something, the Twitter account of TechnicalFNaF said that an Illumix employee said that the Faz-Facts were all made up by Illumix, no Scott intervention or anything. It would make sense after all since we know that Scott has always had problems of communications with other studios.

And so...

    I know you are sick, and so am I~ And I will be there for you~

I'm drinking so much water. My pee is almost clear most of the time. Doesn't ever seem to make a difference. Literally the other day I noticed I *didn't* have a headache, got really happy about it, and then immediately got one within an hour. Walks make it subside a bit but it comes back as soon as I come back inside. I stopped drinking coffee but taking a little bit of caffeine also doesn‚Äôt seem to do anything.

And the thing that makes this annoying is anytime I ask my OB they just say to take tylenol. But I am really, really trying not to take any meds unless it's an emergency. I used to get headaches all the time before pregnancy too (not this often, though) and would pop excedrin constantly. I'm really proud that I haven't taken a pill since we got the positive test (at about 15 weeks now) but fuuuuuuuck this sucks. 

Please, I am begging you, please tell me there is a miracle cure I haven't tried yet. Magnesium? B vitamins? A superfood of some sort?

Now that its winter break I've gone to my local pool and gotten some really great workouts in but the scale STILL hasnt budged.

Parking:¬†

While this unit doesn't include car parking, the Hub offers both garage and lot parking for $300/month.

How did I do?

Method is mostly from sourdough Brandon's chocolate coffee sourdough, [https://sourdoughbrandon.com/chocolate-coffee-sourdough-bread/#recipe](https://sourdoughbrandon.com/chocolate-coffee-sourdough-bread/#recipe)

with the following changes to the recipe and the method:

90 g Starter (fed 45 g whole wheat flour and 45 g water)

191 g brewed coffee, hot

123 g stout beer, cold

200 g bread flour¬†

100 g all purpose flour¬†

100 g whole wheat flour¬†

7 g sea salt¬†

1.5 tea spoons vanilla paste

55 g chocolate chunks

45 g dried sour cherries¬†



To summarize the changes: I removed sugar and cocoa powder from the dough, replaced water with stout beer (that has some sugar), added vanilla paste, replaced some of the chocolate chunks with cherries and skimped some of the bread flour because I am running low and postponing the reorder.

Changes to the method:

Autolyse the flour and coffee + stout for 2+ hours.

Mix in the starter, leave for 30 minutes.

Mix in salt and vanilla paste, leave for 30 minutes.

3 stretch and folds 30 minutes apart, added all the chocolate and cherry at the first stretch.



Bulk fermentation was interrupted due to my time management, I was about 4 hours in, it got late so I put the dough into the fridge overnight and continued in the morning. In the morning another 2+ hours, got about +50 % rise, should have waited longer (recipe suggested almost double, because the coffee and other stuff probably slows down the fermentation).

Shape, cold proof for 8 hours, bake as per recipe.



The bread tastes great but the crumb is a bit closed and my first impression it's under proofed. I imagine my abusive bulk fermentation 'technique' was also to blame.",1,1734723477.0,Sourdough,1,1.0,False

She‚Äôs always sort of preferred my dad, whom she and I live with, because he‚Äôs around the most (I lived half the time with my mom).

1hirr6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/1hirr6q/why_do_businesses_especially_large_ones_seemingly/,"Why do businesses, especially large ones, seemingly often refuse to make otherwise correct decisions due to the constraints of previously fixed budgets?","Anyone has worked in a large business or organization has no doubt heard a reasoning for not spending money along the lines ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have the budget for it, right now, we have to wait until next quarter/fiscal year.‚Äù This is often the case, even if the business decision clearly makes sense and there isn't really a liquidity issue.

I don‚Äôt really understand why it seems like in so many organizations budgets are a monolith that can only be changed at very specific times, or that the world falls down if they are exceeded. Individuals and smaller businesses don't think this way, so I don't really see why larger businesses, which typically have far less liquidity concerns, don't do the same.

For example, if I as and indivual have a certain spending budget each month and my car breaks down requiring expensive repairs that would put my over my monthly budget, I‚Äôm still going to get it fixed right away assuming I have the liquidity to do so. I don't really care if I blow my budget that month because I don't want to walk 2 hours to work or rack up hundres in Uber fees until the next month rolls around. In this situation, it would make no sense to wait to get your car fixed to stay on budget. Any normal person with adequate liquidity will just get it done rather than saying ‚Äúguess I have to wait until next month so I can meet my personal budget.‚Äù

However it seems like many businesses faced with similar decisions often say the equivalent of ‚ÄúWelp, there‚Äôs no budget to fix it right now, guess I‚Äôm walking everywhere until the next arbitrary accounting period begins. Too bad this will make me too tired to work efficiently and waste a lot of my time, but a budget is a budget.‚Äù

Similarly, I‚Äôve seen the business equivalent of: ‚ÄúHey, I spend $100 a month on Starbucks. I‚Äôm going to buy an espresso machine for $900 and then I'll only spend $20 a month on coffee beans instead. This will save me $60 in year one and then $960 every year going forward. Oops! It looks like there‚Äôs no budget to buy the machine until next year because the coffee savings is operating budget and the machine has to be bought out of the capital budget.‚Äù

I get that for public companies there are earnings reports and shareholders to keep happy, but ultimately maxmizing shareholder value involves making the correct business decisions instead of trying to put up specific numbers in specific accounting periods. And its also like those companies couldn't do something else like slash another budget in order to make a better decision now and still have the same financials to print. While definitely not always the case, it seems very much like meeting budget is often way more important than maximizing NPV of cashflows or strategically positioning a business with correct decisions. I also get that people are often incentivized to stick to or be under their budgets, but not allowing for flexibility to make otherwise correct decisions seems shortsighted. Ultimately, a company wants people who are making the best decisions, not just meeting arbitrary budget targets that were set months ago.

Furthermore, this way of thinking seems even more entrenched in organizations like non-profits that don't have shareholders to answer to. Ask anyone who has ever worked for a large university, non profit hospital, or the public sector will tell you about this situation happening again and again.

I've seen situations come up multiple times in all kinds of different companies - privately held, private non-profit, publicly traded, and it seems that it is related much more to the size of the company than the structure. Of course, I've also seen budgets be overridden when the business situation requires it, but this seems more like the exception than the default.

Why is it that these organizations consistently make obviously wrong business decisions as if the budget gods will rain fire and brimstone down on them if they exceed a budget for an arbitrary period? Why are smaller companies and individuals seemingly so much more able to make the right long term decision?",0,1734723314.0,AskEconomics,1,0.5,False

I had my first VM episode 3 years ago. It stopped after 8 months and is back again. I suffer from a 10 day long episode every month after my periods (its like clockwork).

Symptoms -

* Dizzy, spinning feeling
* Nausea
* Dry mouth
* Debliitating Headache for 3 days

Known triggers -

* Skipping meals
* Coffee

Easing the symptoms -

* Lying down helps a lot

Medication -

* Inderal 20mg for migraine
* Vertin 16mg for vertigo

Lack of sleep does not seem as trigger so far.

**I am looking for help to manage VM** such that I can focus on my daily life. Cooking, grocery shopping have taken a back seat due to dizziness. I am trying not to hamper my work but its getting harder & harder to work with this dizzy feeling.",1,1734723184.0,VestibularMigraines,1,1.0,False

Strong citrus and muddled prune smell.

What I liked about this coffee was how well it paired with the cigar.

I definitely get chocolate milk when it‚Äôs hot. But as I sip as it cools I get more of that light tea flavor.

I can definitely taste a strong sweetness towards the end, but I can‚Äôt really pinpoint it because initially when it was hot, I could really taste some type of grape but the longer that it sits the tea flavor becomes more pronounced. 

The sweetness towards the end, it gets a little chemically where it‚Äôs overly sweet . Not sweet like a strawberry, but imo almost chemically artificial sweetness.",7,1734723136.0,pourover,9,0.73,False

1hirlsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hirlsj/the_infamous_no_chemistryspark_problem/,"The infamous ""no chemistry/spark"" problem","So, in the last 5 years I've probably gone on around 40 dates, before that I had a long relationship. There has been success but so far nothing lifelong. Listing some stuff to get those as the possible reasons eliminated: Good job, decent wealth, do sports, not overweight even slightly, good hygiene, confidence as far as I know, healthy lifestyle, active, not a douchebag, have social skills, intelligent, won't be talking about cars or some other fail on the first date, would imagine the looks are 7-8/10 or something, not trying to be too nice/eager or whatever.

I believe I have most things cracked, but one thing really evades me. I live in a nordic country where I believe things are a bit toned down when it comes to being socially flashy. Generally people don't play a guitar and start singing a Mexican love song right off the bat, instead just talking and being nice, as strangers often are.  
  
So, two strangers in a country like this meet for a cup of coffee, or walking the womans dog or something else that is ""mundane."" All goes well, they laugh at jokes and smile, we get to know eachother, I detect nothing going awry. I do the honors and tell them I had a good time, and feel it would be fun to meet again. Then you get the:

*""I'm sorry, I just didn't feel chemistry/a spark""*

Good example from today, I was on a date and we walked in the dark cold winter streets with her dog where I can barely even see her face. Her date choice, I gave options.

**The question:**

How on earth is one supposed to inject ""chemistry"" or a ""spark"" into a situation like this? Would be easy if we were at a spa centre in Mallorca sipping some fruity beverage.

In my mind, it always takes way more than one preliminary surface level meet to get to know someone at all. I somehow seem not to grasp how to inject a ""spark"" or ""chemistry"" or whatever into a mundane situation like drinking coffee in the middle of the day at a coffee shop.

I genuinely get this feeling a Hollywood romance movie experience is expected, but the setting is a -20C cold dark street where the possibilities are to walk and talk. What's going on here? Or is just the classic ""yeah, was a pretty nice guy, but 90 in line in the dating app, next.""",1,1734722905.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False
1hirlbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/homegym/comments/1hirlbf/i_regained_my_life_and_you_can_too_i_lost_50lbs/,"I regained my life, and you can too. I lost 50lbs this year!","Hi all, Wanted to share my health journey with this community a hope it helps those that are struggling with health issues, diabetes, or auto immune. I'm nearly 40 M, 5.9, weighed 223 lbs earlier this year! I have struggled with autoimmune disorder for years with Hypothyroidism and Hashimotos, that coupled with a very stressful job really sent me towards a health crisis. I was pre diabetic, had unhealthy lifestyle with no good fitness or diet plan. I wasn't doing well, with two young children that needed me. I made a decision to change, I went on a personal journey this year. Today I'm healthy again, I developed good habits/routine and it resulted in about 50lbs in total loss. I hope my journey helps others.

**Internalize your purpose**¬†\- For me, this is my family. I must be a healthy father, husband and son for decades to come! Being alive, healthy and present in all stages of their life, that is my purpose. And to my two kids that I love very much, I‚Äôm their protector and they need me throughout their lives! You must find your purpose, internalize it often (weekly at least), and get moving!

**Training is everything, it must be done with regularity**¬†\- Since starting my professional career, I have struggled with having good workout habits, and after having kids, it became even worse. I had to build something that was convenient and easily accessible, so I built a home gym. Thanks to this community for the inspiration and ideas! It‚Äôs a simple gym in the garage with two machines, fitness mats, and a couple of dumbbells. The one routine that changed my life is indoor biking on¬†[Concept 2 Bike Erg](https://www.concept2.com/ergs/bikeerg). This machine truly saved my life! Indoor biking is convenient, low-medium intensity workout that I enjoy while listening to music or watching youtube, that I can do often! I would also block schedule in my calendar during the day or evening since I mostly WFH. Here is my broader routine for training my body:

* **Yoga & Stretching**¬†(Almost Daily, 20-30 mins) - I do Yoga / Meditation via videos from¬†[doyogawithme.com](http://doyogawithme.com/). I prefer Yoga and breathing activities at home with basic stretches before and after workouts.
* **Cardio**¬†(5x a week, 35-45 mins) - Indoor Biking - I workout in¬†[Zone 2](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/exercise-heart-rate-zones-explained)¬†Cardio for 30 mins minimum. I recommend a fitness watch that helps track Zone for your heart rate. Being in Zone 2 is critical for weight loss and also recovery. In Zone 2, I recover well, while in Zone 3 or 4, I would have fatigue requiring recovery over multiple days.
* **Core & Basic Strength Training**¬†(3-4x a week, 10-20 mins) - Nothing too fancy here. Pushups, Pullups, Core Exercises (Plank, Leg Raises, Bridge, etc), Basic Weight lifting. I intend to do more strength training since I‚Äôm reaching my target weight.

https://preview.redd.it/o1t5tiig128e1.jpg?width=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ae666185fc745322c5a42569619ee5bb5c0fa80

**Take adequate amounts of medicine**¬†\- Living with hypothyroidism and Hashimotos means your body is no longer producing adequate amounts of Thyroid hormone! Accept it, don‚Äôt fight it, there is no natural remedy as suggested by countless Youtube videos! You have to supplement with a thyroid hormone such as Levothyroxine. Work with your doctor to determine what is a good TSH range for you.¬† It took me months to figure out what is the correct dosage and TSH level for me! I cannot emphasize how important it is to be persistent with your health care provider to identify the right dosage and TSH level. Don‚Äôt take their generic response of ‚Äúyou are in the normal range‚Äù acceptable, especially those with Hashimotos. Everyone is unique and you need to find what dosage amount works for you. For me, it was in the lower range of the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù range. Also be persistent in regular checkups, at least once every 4-6 months to ensure the dosage is adequate for your body. Your body may require more, especially in the first year you start the medicine.¬†

* **Note**: I will share my details knowing it may help others. I currently take generic Levothyroxine of 75mcg every morning (I wait a minimum of an hour before eating or having coffee) and my TSH was 1.7 last I checked. This lowered range is critical for me, finally I was able to lose weight! While I was in a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù TSH range of 3.5-4.2, my metabolism sucked, I had low energy and simply could not lose weight.¬†Again, find your target range that works for you.

**Nourish your body with good food & recovery**¬†\- There is much to nourishing your body, and since everyone has their own choice of food, I wanted to highlight just the key things that worked for me.¬†

* **Identify your total daily Calorie Budget**¬†\- The most important aspect of weight loss is calorie restriction. You need to determine the amount of calories your body needs to kick start weight loss. I use¬†[Carb Manager](https://www.carbmanager.com/)¬†app to log and track every single food that I consume. Identity the right amount of calories your body needs and stick to it! I don‚Äôt have cheat days and I enjoy foods that fit into my Calorie budget daily! It‚Äôs hard in the beginning, but once you start tracking your intake, you will enjoy it by mixing certain foods everyday, and yet still meet your calorie budget! Also, don't beat yourself down for days where you exceed calories or carbs, just get back into routine!¬†
* **Aim for a low carb diet**¬†\- I don‚Äôt do strict keto. I don‚Äôt enjoy it. My net carbs are about 20-25g a day. Tracking it in the Carb Manager app helps, so you can still fit the foods you enjoy. For me, it‚Äôs foods such as Brown Rice, Apples, Dates, etc. I intend to increase my net carbs to 30-35g per day after I reach my target weight, a few more pounds to go!
* **Increase your protein intake**¬†\- I have about 100g-120g of protein daily. Varying between tuna, eggs, beef patties, chicken, turkey, protein shake, and veggies I also enjoy fast food without the bread bun and ketchup! McDonalds and Wendys have many options with lettuce wraps! Having protein is critical to feeling full and ensuring your body retains its muscle. I also take Protein shake by Sunwarrior Warrior Blend (it's on Amazon) daily. It‚Äôs the best protein I found with quality ingredients all around. I love it!¬†¬†
* **Remove foods that cause inflammation**¬†\- I removed refined sugar and all vegetable oils from my diet. In the past 6 months, I have had refined sugar maybe two times! Aim for natural foods such as fruits, veggies, rice, and meat. To fill my sugar cravings, there are many options now, whether it's Lilys, ChocZero, or Evolved chocolate options! You are not missing much with many good options. Just make sure you don't exceed your total calorie budget. Fwiw, I also follow a strict gluten free diet since my early 30's.
* **Sleep is critical:**¬†Get your sleep in. It‚Äôs been hard since having our second child. But I‚Äôm aiming to be in bed by 10-10.30pm. Sleep is critical for healing your thyroid, immune system, and neurological health (avoiding dementia).

**Accept hard things and GTFO**¬†\- I was in a job where my manager didn‚Äôt appreciate me and the company went through rounds of layoffs that caused a lot of stress! I should have left the environment much earlier! No job is worth your mental health. Be proactive in moving out. Take care of yourself, because honestly no one at work truly cares about you. It‚Äôs just a job. Also, remember training your body will help tremendously. Train hard, do your best, accept shitty environments (because a decent percentage of people are shitty), make your plans for exit and then exit with a middle finger held high, yes!

Share as many details as you want. I‚Äôll go first‚Ä¶","So, earlier this year, I decided to try being more adventurous and went on a solo trip to a small town. While I was exploring, I found this tiny, quirky caf√© run by an old couple. I ordered a coffee and started reading my book when a guy sitting across the room suddenly waved at me. I awkwardly waved back, thinking maybe he mistook me for someone else.

Then he stood up, walked over, and sat down at my table without asking. He introduced himself as ‚ÄúCaptain Stardust,‚Äù told me he was a ‚Äútime traveler,‚Äù and said I was ‚Äúcritical to saving the timeline.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know what to do, so I just nodded along and tried to play it cool while mentally planning my exit. He was *dead serious* and started pulling out random objects from his pocket, claiming they were futuristic gadgets: a penlight that he said was a ‚ÄúDNA scanner‚Äù and a random key he insisted was ‚Äúthe master key to all doors in the universe.‚Äù

The kicker? When he left, he paid for my coffee and left a note that just said, ‚ÄúSee you in 2045.‚Äù I still have it. Part of me wonders if I should frame it.

I don't think he bought a grinder, so I told him I'll give him my old grinder. Which is this Breville Smart Grinder Pro that I bought years ago. I figured before I give it away, I'll come and quickly review the grinder, and why I still kinda like the thing, and could recommend it with some reservations. 



So first of all, let's talk about the taste of the coffee this thing grinds. It's not the best - but hey, it is a cheap grinder that you can find on sale all the time. For espresso the taste profile is really classic conical burr - and not a really good conical burr like you'd find on a Niche Zero. On the bright side, the espresso it turns out is rich and full bodied, but you don't really get that much clarity to it. It does a very good job with the classic medium to medium dark espresso roast, but don't put in a really dark, oily roast, since at finer grind settings, it could choke with an oily bean. A smack usually solves the problem, but that interferes with the ""smart"" part of the grinder. Back in the day, I'd probably be generous and give it a B- score on taste, but with today's increasingly tough competition, it's probably C+ level - the espresso it turns out isn't bad by any means of the imagination, but it isn't great. 



Ahh, but this grinder does everything! And Breville uses the burr set in everything! And I really think is one of the biggest strengths of the grinder. The outside adjustment has 60 positions, but inside the hopper, on the upper burr there's an additional 10 positions to adjust. If you're willing to play with both adjusters, you can adjust the grinder to do everything from French press all the way down to coffee dust for Turkish coffee. I've been using this grinder over the years for French Press, Drip, AeroPress, Espresso, and even Turkish style dust to rim drinks and garnish desserts. And it really is the stereotypical jack of all trades, master of none, putting out C+ to B- level work for whatever style you want. Primarily, the problem is that there's always a bit too much fines to be considered great when your grinding coarser. 



I guess there's the first major advantage to this grinder. It does a passable job grinding for everything. I'm sure nowadays you can find a grinder that does better espresso than it in its price range, and I'm sure you can find a grinder that does better French press than it in its price range, but a lot of those grinders can only do one or the other, not both. 



Now some other positives I like about the grinder are: the timer actually turns out consistent grind amounts as long as the hopper is decently full - Decent enough that if you're lazy, you can skip weighing the grounds every time. It's decently fast, and doesn't sound horrifying. There are some touches to the design that I enjoy (IE: the big loop on the hopper lid, the removable tray under the hopper). 



And then there's the stuff I don't like: Retention is a constant problem (if you notice carefully, there's a constant ""swapping"" of grinds), and the static and clumping is just horrific. Now to be fair, most grinders in this price range have horrible clumping and static issues, but since you're supposed to pre-load the hopper, you can't spray the beans to help with it. If you get this grinder, you cannot avoid the WDT tool to break up clumps and avoid channeling. As an aside, this is also why I think the Barista Express Impress is such a terrible, terrible idea. Going straight from grinding to tamping with this grinder is guaranteed channeling. 



I don't really want to comment on reliability here, since I have a sample of 1, but it seems like back when this grinder was first released, it had impeller problems, but Breville fixed it sometime down the line, and I've gotten a solid half decade out of the grinder. 



In conclusion, if this grinder turns out mediocre grind quality, and has a few annoying downsides, why wouldn't you go with something like a Fellow Opus or DF54? I actually think I can make a case for the Smart Grinder Pro for a certain type of user. 



You see - Back when I bought this grinder 5-6 years ago, the hyped up model that everyone recommended was the Sette 270 - on paper the Sette 270 is a $400 grinder while the Smart Grinder Pro is a $300 grinder, but since the SGP is sold everywhere, you can always find it on sale somewhere, so I think the SGP is a $200 grinder while the Sette 270 is a $400 grinder. For $200 more than that, at $600 there's the Sette 270wi, that ground by weight. The assumption for both the Sette 270/wi, the Smart Grinder Pro, and all the grinders popular in that era was that you filled up the hopper with beans, and you get a consistent amount of grinds every time. 





In more recent years, single dosing became really popular (can we credit the Niche for that?). All the new popular affordable grinders seem to be effectively single dose. Whether you're talking about the Fellow Opus, the DF54, or even the Baratza Encore ESP (The Encore ESP has a large hopper, but you have to annoyingly manually time your grinding. You might as well single dose). 



Look, I get all the arguments for single dosing, how the beans stay fresher in an airtight container, how clearing out the retained grinds every time with bellows makes sure you don't get any stale beans, how spraying the beans helps with static. But like, there's millions and millions of people out there who's primary use case is just ""give me a latte better than Starbucks with minimal work"", and who are willing to sacrifice some quality and clarity of flavor for the convenience of just putting the portafilter into the progs and pressing start. 



For that segment of customers, none of the new popular grinders like the Opus, DF54, or Encore ESP fits with their workflow. These new grinders are forcing you to single dose. I get that by forcing you to single dose, you can save some costs by cutting the ""smart features"", and thus, can spend a bit more money on a better burr or something. But I'm sure there are tons of guys out there willing to sacrifice some quality there, for the convenience of avoiding single dosing. 



And if that is you, the most popular grinders on the market are still pretty unchanged from a few years ago? You're still choosing between this and the Sette family. So if you're willing to sacrifice some quality, for convenience with the full hopper instead of the single dose, then the SGP is still your best choice for around $200. 



Of course, this grinder has been out for years and years and years now, and I'm hoping that Breville could update it and make a Smart Grinder Pro 2 or something. It would be a damned shame if it was discontinued and replaced with the Baratza Encore ESP. If Breville is going to update this for a second generation, I would like to see a few key changes:

* Make the adjustment easier, instead of the current two step system with inner and outer grind size adjustments
* Do something about the retention
* Add an anti-static device to help with the static and clumping",1,1734722350.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Life aboard a submarine‚Äîthat hermetically sealed, steel tube of shared chaos and controlled insanity‚Äîis never dull, thanks to the Navy Nuclear Power Program. Among the glowing personalities (pun intended) that populate the nuke division, three archetypes emerge: the Wizards, the Mansons, and the God Particle Physicists. Each has their quirks, and together, they make the reactor room feel like a cross between a physics symposium, a secret cult, and an episode of Stranger Things. Here‚Äôs a deep dive into the minds of the subterranean intellectual elite.

**1. The Wizards: Masters of Fantasy and Dungeon Masters of the Watchbill** 

https://preview.redd.it/yu9yyvi2z18e1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c08455c849043b84c154f3f4bed3213c3ef84b

These are the nukes who spent their off-watch hours in the wardroom or the berthing area, rolling dice and plotting elaborate campaigns for Dungeons & Dragons. Wizards are the dungeon masters of life, weaving complex worlds and heroic journeys with the same fervor they use to troubleshoot reactor startups. Their ability to recite the entire D&D Player‚Äôs Handbook from memory is rivaled only by their encyclopedic knowledge of Naval Reactors manuals.

On the mid-watch, you‚Äôll catch them conjuring imaginative metaphors for heat transfer or drawing flowcharts that suspiciously resemble a dungeon crawl map. They‚Äôre the crew members who will turn a dull reactor drill into an epic tale of heroism, complete with a soundtrack of them humming the Lord of the Rings theme.



**2. The Mansons: Subtly Sinister Masters of Calculation**

https://preview.redd.it/94mkw20nz18e1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=811d7444187b71e3030aebad3b3b7a202af2f9f1

These are the guys who seem almost normal on the surface. They‚Äôll laugh at your jokes, offer you a coffee, and help troubleshoot a motor generator issue with alarming efficiency. But behind that friendly fa√ßade lies a mind continuously running through scenarios of dominance.

Mansons can‚Äôt help but mentally calculate every interaction. Did you accidentally bump into them in the passageway? They‚Äôve already mapped out a four-step plan to neutralize you as a theoretical threat. Some say their skill at reactor chemistry calculations is matched only by their ability to plan (purely hypothetically, of course) how to dispose of a body.

Their signature move is dropping cryptic comments that make you wonder if they‚Äôre joking. ‚ÄúYeah, you know, if we had a catastrophic loss of coolant accident, it‚Äôd only take 32 seconds to reach critical heat flux. Hypothetically.‚Äù You‚Äôll nervously chuckle while mentally reviewing your will.

  
**3. The God Particle Physicists: Solvers of String Theory and Seekers of Enlightenment**

https://preview.redd.it/hwa8frmqz18e1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=8048fc40c543e67e7a9c2113fc0c60355cdca69e

Every patrol has that one nuke who isn‚Äôt content with just understanding the reactor. No, they‚Äôre busy applying quantum mechanics to figure out why toast always lands butter-side down. God Particle Physicists view every patrol as an opportunity to solve humanity‚Äôs deepest questions. Einstein? Child's play. Hawking? Overrated. The God Particle nuke always has an Excel spreadsheet open, refining their version of the Unified Theory.

You'll find them in the corner of the secret reactor space or the ELT room, sketching diagrams that resemble alien star charts. When asked, they‚Äôll explain, ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs just my model for reconciling string theory with quantum gravity.‚Äù They're also the ones most likely to use the phrase ‚ÄúSchr√∂dinger‚Äôs Core‚Äù during a reactor casualty drill.

The best part? They‚Äôre probably right. If anyone is going to discover faster-than-light travel, it‚Äôs this guy, on his laptop, during a three-month Pacific patrol.



**A (Conspiracy) Theory for the Ages**

Now, here‚Äôs the kicker: What if ChatGPT and modern AI weren‚Äôt created in Silicon Valley but rather in the classified bowels of Naval Reactors headquarters? Picture this: 20 years ago, the Navy ran a black project. They gathered 1,000 nukes from submarines across decades and eras, implanted secret brain chips, and harvested their neural algorithms. These were fed into quantum supercomputers running on superposition computations, forming the foundation of today‚Äôs AI systems.

Think about it‚Äîthe uncanny ability of AI to answer obscure technical questions, generate complex flowcharts, or mimic human-like humor. That‚Äôs not just code. That‚Äôs the collective psyche of a thousand nukes, forever preserved in silicon. Somewhere in an undisclosed location, there‚Äôs probably an AI humming reactor coolant pump noise while solving Sudoku puzzles.

**Final Thoughts**

Submarine life is nothing without its characters, and the Wizards, Mansons, and God Particle Physicists add the spice that makes the nuke division unforgettable. Whether they‚Äôre weaving tales of dragons, calculating ways to neutralize your theoretical threat, or solving the mysteries of the universe, these nukes keep the reactor room‚Äîand the submarine‚Äîrunning like a well-oiled machine.

So, the next time you‚Äôre on watch, take a moment to appreciate your fellow nukes. And if the AI ever becomes self-aware, just remember: it‚Äôs probably been running a mental game of Dungeons & Dragons all along.

1hirdoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Testaimediaplatform/comments/1hirdoq/the_starbucks_strike_a_story_of_coffee_and/,The Starbucks Strike: A Story of Coffee and Compromise,"The news about the Starbucks strike in Seattle, Los Angeles, and Chicago caught my eye. It reminded me of my own journey as a software engineer. I‚Äôve worked for some of the biggest names in tech‚ÄîGoogle, Microsoft, Amazon, even Zulily‚Äîand I've seen firsthand how important it is for workers to have a voice.  

When I was working for Google, I remember feeling like just another cog in the machine.  We had to meet crazy deadlines and work long hours.  It was tough.  But there was a good side to working for Google‚Äîgreat benefits, a sense of community, and the chance to learn and grow.  Working with so many talented people was an inspiration.  But at the end of the day, Google was still a business, and they needed to make money.  

The Starbucks strike is a reminder that even in the coffee business, the balance of power between employers and employees can be tricky.  The Workers United union represents 10,000 baristas who are demanding higher wages, more staffing, and better scheduling.  They say Starbucks is a wealthy company that can afford to pay them more.  But Starbucks says the union‚Äôs demands are unrealistic and could hurt the company‚Äôs ability to operate.  

I understand both sides of the story.  As a Filipino author living in Seattle, I see firsthand how important a good cup of coffee can be.  I‚Äôm glad that Starbucks baristas are fighting for what they believe in.  But I also know that striking can be a risky move.  It can hurt the workers in the short term, and it‚Äôs not always the best way to achieve long-term change.  

Ultimately, the Starbucks strike is about finding a compromise that works for both the company and its employees.  It‚Äôs about finding that balance between profits and people.  And as someone who loves coffee and believes in fair treatment for everyone, I‚Äôm hoping they can find a solution that works for everyone. ‚òïÔ∏è",1,1734722284.0,Testaimediaplatform,0,1.0,False

1hircch,https://i.redd.it/im1z4i5oz18e1.jpeg,First official year into my fragrance journey,"My 1-Year Journey into Fragrances

It all started in 2022 when my brother brought back some knockoff fragrances from XLNC. That was my first experience with scents that smelled genuinely good. Before that, my collection was limited to Fogg and Axe. Intrigued, I ended up buying a bunch of XLNC knockoffs, and at the time, they felt amazing because I had no frame of reference.

Now, my preferences have definitely evolved. I‚Äôve moved on to exploring niche and designer scents through decants or sampling from friends. Here‚Äôs what my current collection looks like, along with my thoughts on each fragrance:

1. Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa
‚Ä¢	Scent: Starts with a sweet, coffee-toffee vibe. Initially, it‚Äôs very sugary, but the dry-down reveals chocolatey and vanilla notes with a hint of musk. While I appreciated it at first, I‚Äôve grown to dislike it because it feels overwhelming and gives me headaches.
‚Ä¢	Longevity: 8/10 (projects for 1.5 hours, lasts 8+ hours on skin and over a day on clothes).
‚Ä¢	Overall: 5.5/10 (decent performance, but I rarely use it now).

2. Pendora Scents Tobacco Vanille
‚Ä¢	Scent: Opens with a soft tobacco note that dries down quickly to a chocolatey base. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt get much vanilla here, and it‚Äôs far from the richness I expected in a TF clone.
‚Ä¢	Longevity: 4/10 (weak sillage, becomes a skin scent within 30 minutes).
‚Ä¢	Overall: 5/10 (disappointing performance and scent profile).

3. UCB Dream Big
‚Ä¢	Scent: A solid Valentino Uomo EDT clone, though not an exact match. After the initial alcohol blast, it opens with a mix of citrus and a soft hint of iris, which fades into a sweet, chocolatey, yet fresh gourmand scent.
‚Ä¢	Longevity: 6/10 (projects for about an hour, lasts 4‚Äì5 hours).
‚Ä¢	Overall: 6.5/10 (a great entry-level scent and perfect for blind buying).

4. Ajmal Evoke Gold
‚Ä¢	Scent: A powdery iris-forward scent inspired by Prada L‚ÄôHomme. It opens with a brief hint of neroli, followed by a heavy iris note. The dry-down is linear, with powdery iris and some amber, but it lacks the soapy freshness of its inspiration.
‚Ä¢	Longevity: 2/10 (disappears completely within an hour).
‚Ä¢	Overall: 6/10 (lovely scent, terrible performance).

5. Al Haramain Detour Noir
‚Ä¢	Scent: A beautifully sweet fragrance with a strong apple note upfront, transitioning to a warm vanilla base. As it dries down, it reveals a subtle woody and cardamom undertone. Despite being linear, it‚Äôs an addictive scent.
‚Ä¢	Longevity: 7/10 (projects for 1.5 hours, lasts 6‚Äì8 hours on clothes).
‚Ä¢	Overall: 8/10 (great for blind buying and very versatile).

6. Liquid Brun
‚Ä¢	Scent: A gourmand lover‚Äôs dream. It opens with a sweet, spicy blend of cardamom and cinnamon. The heart is dominated by rich bourbon vanilla, which is so sweet it‚Äôs almost edible. I don‚Äôt pick up much orange blossom, but the overall effect is cozy and inoffensive.
‚Ä¢	Longevity: 7/10 (lingers for 5 hours on skin and over a day on clothes).
‚Ä¢	Overall: 8/10 (sweet, comforting, and an easy favorite).

7. MA Opulence Leather
‚Ä¢	Scent: Pure leather with a touch of amber. It doesn‚Äôt develop much; what you smell at the start is what you get until the end. The leather note feels a bit synthetic, but it works decently as a layering scent for a leather jacket.
‚Ä¢	Longevity: 5/10 (skin scent, lasts around 5 hours on clothes).
‚Ä¢	Overall: 6/10 (basic but functional).

8. MA Fabulo Intense
‚Ä¢	Scent: A spicy, leathery fragrance with a touch of incense. It‚Äôs very oriental, with a strong herbal edge that remains consistent throughout.
‚Ä¢	Longevity: 9/10 (beast mode‚Äîprojects for 1.5 hours and lingers for days on clothes).
‚Ä¢	Overall: 8.5/10 (strong and bold, with excellent staying power).

9. Valentino Uomo EDT
‚Ä¢	Scent: A perfect balance of citrus, iris, and chocolate. It opens fresh with hints of citrus before transitioning into a powdery iris heart. The base is sweet and chocolatey, though I sometimes pick up a cumin-like note in the middle.
‚Ä¢	Longevity: 7/10 (a bit better than UCB Dream Big).
‚Ä¢	Overall: 8/10 (a classic that I‚Äôm biased toward since it‚Äôs my first designer fragrance).

Honorable Mentions (Decants):

1. Mancera Cedrat Boise Intense
‚Ä¢	Scent: Bright and fruity with a sharp pineapple note, balanced by warm spices. It dries down to a woody vanilla and an musky base, but the opening can feel overpowering.
‚Ä¢	Longevity: 6/10 (good projection for an hour but fades quickly).
‚Ä¢	Overall: 7/10 (not my favorite, but it gets compliments).

2. Lattafa Atlas
‚Ä¢	Scent: Unique and polarizing. It‚Äôs a fresh, watery scent with a mossy undertone, unlike most aquatic fragrances.
‚Ä¢	Longevity: 10/10 (absolute beast mode‚Äîlasts 10+ hours and stays on clothes for days).
‚Ä¢	Overall: 8/10 (not my personal favorite, but undeniably impressive).

1hirazd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1hirazd/healing_journey_tips/,healing journey tips,"I have been struggling with disease for almost 3 years now as well as a heital hernia but with a lifestyle and diet change I have been feeling better and actually eating and incorporating small things into my diet everyday.
First things first everyone is very different about what they react to. I personally have a pretty open diet other than avoiding the basics (spicy, sugar sweets, caffeine, dairy, chocolate, gluten)
I start my mornings with a banana and hard boiled egg or whole grain toast with manuka honey or avacado. Now I know bland food sucks but adding salt and seasoning really recks your stomach so keep it light if any. A lot of my lunch consists of ground turkey, low fat beans, corn tortillas. Or Pho/bone broth soup with rice. It is recommended to eat a small meal every 2 hours but my job and lifestyle it is difficult to do that but sticking to 3 meals a day and just taking 5-10 minute breaks while eating helps a lot. Many people say drinking water while eating made them worse but for me I take small sips and it helps settle my stomach. For the first few months of getting better it is normal to still have bloating/discomfort/nausea even when eating the correct diet. For dinner I stick to green beans, zucchini, broccoli, rice, whole grain bread, mash potatoes, beans, with a protein of ground turkey, chicken, or fish (low fat is best) but also salmon was a staple for me even though being high in fat. I am a major snack person throughout the day so this diagnosis really suppresses that but I came up with many different yummy snacks to help curb that sweet and savory tooth. I love to get low fat greek yogurt and add berries and even manuka honey sometimes. I love to get herbal non caffiene teas and add almond milk and manuka honey. Apple/pomegranate juice has been a big staple. Turkey bacon which is actually pretty good. Oatmeal with berries or nuts. Nuts are a great thing to eat and help heal the stomach. pretzel/carrots and regular hummus (no garlic or added flavors). Almond butter with apples/bananas or on whole grain toast. apple sauce, cottage cheese, rice cakes (plain). during the 2nd month i was able to make gluten/dairy low sugar free pumpkin oatmeal cookies which were a lifesaver. A big thing is water and drinking lots of it, it contributes to the healing process the most and stay away from soda and even decaf coffee since it is very acidic. Stress is also a major contender when i was first diagnosed i was working as a waitress and well I had to quit to take time off to help myself relax. Another key thing is actually getting out of bed and going for a walk/getting outside just for 20-30 minutes a day. I like to go on short walks after meals because it helps digest my food easier. Overall things do get better even though it feels never ending. I have also been taking supplements which i can share if interested. That being said taking PPI and pepto is a temporary relief but it‚Äôs not good to keep taking and very hard to quit. I never took a PPI the whole process and just stuck to my diet and took my supplements and i‚Äôm on the end of the path to recovery right now. Pls comment any questions or concerns i‚Äôd love to help because i know how horrible this disease can be.

Consistently! These aren‚Äôt the same cars either, literally different vehicles every time in different places. I personally like the area and some of the shops and places to eat round there but when it comes to using the road it‚Äôs like the Wild West. To give just two examples where I often see people park I‚Äôve attached a couple photos. Why am I bothered about it? Because during periods where there are high volumes of traffic it creates chaos when more the one vehicle is parked in some sort of funky way on the road. You get people parking in weird places everywhere, but it‚Äôs absolutely abundant on Stapleton Road, it‚Äôs crazy.",7,1734722058.0,bristol,4,1.0,False

He was one of those guys that pops up permanently in your inbox on Instagram, socials, etc. and had been hitting on me for like over a year. I finally agreed to go out with him last night, and we had a GREAT TIME. We went to a brewery and then a billiards bar for a couple hours. 

We ended up back at his place and hooked up (other stuff that wasn‚Äôt sex because I don‚Äôt have sex with people I‚Äôm not in a relationship/really serious with) and I stayed over. We did stuff again in the morning. He was incredibly sweet the entire night/morning, paid for everything, drove us back to his place that was 30 minutes away, made us pizza after we hooked up. He even walked a block to his car at 2 am to get me eyedrops to take my contacts out. In the morning he made me a coffee and got me a donut before he drove me 30 minutes back home. We talked the whole night and in the morning.

My problem is, I hate that I did that because everyone says you should ‚Äúleave them wanting more‚Äù but I feel like with the right person it just doesn‚Äôt matter like that and we didn‚Äôt have sex anyway. We got along super well, and it was honestly so relaxed the whole time and fun. When he dropped me back off, he said he had fun and we hugged/kissed bye, but it‚Äôs not like he made another plan or said anything like ‚Äúwe should do this again sometime‚Äù? Idk, he‚Äôs a fairly busy person and has a super active social life but he made time for me specifically this week and I‚Äôm just sorta freaking out about it.

1hir85w,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1hir85w/why_do_people_ignore_me/,Why Do People Ignore Me?,"For years, I‚Äôve been struggling with connecting with people, especially when it is not in person.  Since graduating several years ago and reaching out to reconnect, I‚Äôve been ignored a lot.  I would send a quick message and say I hope things are well or congrats on the marriage, job, kids, etc. and never hear back, even though it says they have seen it.

I just don‚Äôt get it.  You would think, even if I didn‚Äôt study with them or even know them as well, they would at least acknowledge it or say thanks.  I would think people of similar backgrounds or interests might want to spend a few minutes with it.  Likewise, I can‚Äôt think of me doing anything that would justify them going no contact.  I can only think of one time where I got upset at someone and told them to F off, before coming back a few minutes later and apologizing.  I know I shouldn‚Äôt have done that, but they must have pretty thin skin if that is the worst they have heard.

I know people are busy and have their own problems, but that excuse doesn‚Äôt impress me.  My life has been very easy compared to so many, but it still had its difficulties.  I‚Äôve worked full time since I was 22, and was in school or working part time since I was 18.  I‚Äôve struggled with OCD, migraines, job loss, work stress, school stress, rejection.  I grew up with loving parents, but money was often tight and this caused a lot of disagreement.  I think much of the issue was my dad had undiagnosed ADHD and dyslexia.  He lost his job after getting quite sick with Hep. C (back when chemo was the only treatment).  Thankfully, he got better.   My mom had breast cancer more recently, but thankfully it was caught early and treated.  Sorry if that was a bit of a rant, but it felt good getting it out.  And I should mention that I have never told anyone of those things, so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm trying to dump that on them.

But despite that, I still make time for people.  I would still get back to someone who reached out to me, even if it is just a sentence.  Sometimes I did it out of feeling interested.  Other times, it was out of politeness.

I feel like there are only two reasons that it could be:

1.  I come off as overly friendly.  Sometimes I might get a bit overly enthusiastic about talking with people.  I think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve often been shy in life, so feeling I can reach out to someone, and having the courage to do so can be somewhat exhilarating.  That and I like to inject a bit of passion into life.

2.  Sexuality.  Recently, I‚Äôve come to the acceptance that I am at least bi-curious if not bi.  This was a tough road filled with confusion, anger, shame.  I still haven‚Äôt told anyone yet.  I never asked any one of these people out on a date, nor did I ever make any sexual advance or even joke.  The only thing I can think of is if I subconsciously displayed some more feminine traits at times, and they falsely thought I was asking them out if I said let‚Äôs hang out, grab a coffee, go to a party, etc.  I had no romantic interest in them.  And even if I was gay, I think it‚Äôs pretty bad to assume that every conversation I have is intended only for sex and that I am incapable of friendships.  

So, what do you think it is?  Should I take a more neutral approach to people, or is it just that some people don‚Äôt how else to say no?  Or am I just dealing with assholes?",0,1734721866.0,LifeAdvice,3,0.5,False

1hir7zu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Emotions/comments/1hir7zu/too_sensative_or_am_i_abusive/,Too sensative or am i abusive.?,"My gf of 3 years has diagnosed bpd and or cpd.  Shes a ....little emotionally eruptive and lets say volitile at times.   Shes gotten way better but she still has those core issues that arise semi often.

My issue was today we were waking up. Chillin in bed.  Im a goofy dude... and jokes be zingin around.  I asked her ehen she needed to get up for work. She said when i get that dick inside me!!  I said how are you gonna get up like that...  lol just jokes.   So i pretended to hit them backshots like a jamaican and said i was gonna take my right shoe off and throw it sky high into the air. Catch it. Put it back on keep hittin it like it never happend.

This was all just while layin on our sides in bed. Hella jokes... just like i always do right. 90% of the time shes super into it and plays around with me.


I get up to make coffee for us like i do everyday. And i come back in and shes visably saddend...  im like whats up boo.  She said she just wanted to be gently carressed this morning.  I said ooh ok. Layed with her and put my arm around her.  Shes still just ...sad.  a tear starts falling down her cheek.  I wiped it and said why you cryin baby...

She said because i shook her all up and all she wanted was to be gently loved.  I said i was gently loving you for like 5 mins before you made the joke about gettin that diiyuck.

She said just nevermind.  I said cmon boo your bein silly. She said if im just gonna invalidate her then just leave her alone.
I said aww cmon we were playing around and plz dont be sad.  Its not benifitting either of us to be sad about this.

I left and finished making coffee. Came back and she was still bummed.  I said i really just wanna have a good morning can we just let this go.  She then said all im doing is just disregaurding and invalidating her emotions and this is why we have issues.

I said i honestly disagree. (This is alwqys our problem) i feel this is an overreaction and i dont see why it has to be like this.  i feel that you have larger emotional reactions to rhings vs the averqge person. Its a part of your diagnosed behavioral disorder. And if i try to point that out in any way now im seen as abusive.

If i try to point out that shes overreacting and how that effects both of us negatively vs her taking a few moments to look at the situation and ask herself are my emotions worth this rn? Am i just being too sensative and blaming my partner?    

Shes always saying im a narcissistic abuser.... but itll be over the tiniest shit like this.
I feel hostage to her emotions at times.  Like how tf is this your reaction to something so rediculous.

Imo shes just triggered alot and doesnt know how to see those triggers as her problem not mine.

For some reason she took my goofy backshots thing as being abused.... like was she still tired and brain fogged.  So there was less logic behind her emotions.  Or was it just some reaction from not being cared for well and sexually abused as a child?

Did that touch on some deep wound... then it just snowballs from there?     But its just abnormal... it aint normal....  its like everythings rad and fun and out of nowhere theres some negative reaction and a need for me to fix it. I hate how she says i cause this stuff.


What do you guys think about this type of situation.  Am in asshole with no heart.  Or is she just trippin over some little shit and not willing to let it go?  Am i really causing this or is she living within her own trauma blaming me for unnecessary unmanaged emotions.

Is me stating i feel shes overly sensative at times wrong?

Plz validate me lol.   I already know me stating  shes being a bit overly sensative isnt wrong.  Shes emotionally stunted from her childhood. She admits it.  She uses it as a crutch when it benifits her.  But she i point it out in defense of my position im abusive.


To me its an odd reaction and a need for me to sooth her trigger.  And if i think shes being overly sensative or reactive im being mean.  But i feel that im just unbiased and trying to help her mindset see things without so much emotion controlling the situation.

With the guidance of my psychiatrist, we‚Äôve adjusted my dosage a few times. I initially started with 30mg, prescribed to take it 2-4 times a week as needed . Unfortunately, as my body isn't accustomed to stimulants (I don't drink coffee or take pre-workout) it caused me to have sleep issues. After discussing this with my psychiatrist, my dosage was lowered to 20mg, which helped with my sleep, but it wasn‚Äôt as effective in managing my ADHD symptoms.

Three months later, I asked if I could increase it back to 30mg to better address my symptoms. To counter the sleep issue, I began taking it earlier in the morning around 7am instead of 10am, and that helped significantly. Since then, I‚Äôve been taking the 30mg dosage five times a week. The frequency was increased since I started my Master‚Äôs program in August.

However, with the increased frequency, I‚Äôve noticed some new side effects, such as frequent urination and elevated blood pressure. My blood pressure readings have sometimes reached 140/81, whereas my usual is around 120/60.

To summarize, my psychiatrist has adjusted my dosage from 30mg to 20mg, then back to 30mg. I‚Äôm hesitant to ask him to lower the dosage again because I don‚Äôt want to seem like I‚Äôm being difficult, but I‚Äôm just trying to find the right balance with my medication.

""The Great Pox"" ‚Äî aka the 1495 syphilis epidemic that swept across Europe prior to the existence of the antibiotics to treat it. Like today, the first stage of the sexually transmitted infection began with painless ulcers, typically on one's genitals, that often went away on their own. The next phase manifested in the form of rashes, swollen lymph nodes, and ‚Äî at its worst ‚Äî pustules ""which oozed a foul-smelling discharge."" Again, these would go away, fooling people into thinking they were cured. In the third and final phase, permanent and more intense symptoms arose. Though they were still alive, infected people's skin and bones would literally start rotting and disintegrating on their faces. This often resulted in the collapse of their nasal cartilage, which made them appear as though they had no nose at all. Other symptoms included the formation of gummas ‚Äî or ""grotesque tumor-like growths"" and severe damage to internal organs.
2. [In August of 1986, in Cameroon, West Africa, 1,700+ people were silently killed in the middle of the night by carbon dioxide. That night Lake Nyos, a volcanic crater lake, released nearly a quarter of a cubic mile of the gas, which travelled down the volcano at speeds of nearly 45 miles per hour, killing nearly everyone in Nyos and many in surrounding villages. Of nearly 850 people who survived and were hospitalized, the clinical findings were comparable to those of people who'd been exposed to an asphyxiant gas.""](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/lake-nyos-1986)
3. [Flight data during the Challenger space shuttle disaster in 1986 revealed that it was likely some of the astronauts on board were still alive after the explosion. According to NASA, at least three of the emergency breathing packs were turned on following the Challenger's explosion, leading them to believe that some of the crew remained conscious for at least 10 seconds following the disaster and were alive when it hit the water. They were believed to have been coherent enough to understand the severity of what was occurring. Reportedly, the final word they heard from the crew ‚Äî which was uttered by the shuttle's pilot, Michael J. Smith, 73 seconds after they took off ‚Äî was a simple, ""Uh oh.""](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-07-29-mn-19581-story.html)

Certain results of decomposition, like bloating and gas, can force the fetus out of the womb, making it appear as though the deceased person has given birth.

There have been a few documented cases in history in which a smaller set of bones were found between the legs of a deceased mother who'd been buried.](https://www.buzzfeed.com/crystalro/coffin-birth)
5. [In 1992, Stella Liebeck ‚Äî a 79-year-old McDonald's customer ‚Äî sued the fast food giant after suffering burns from their coffee. While many saw the case as a quick way to make a buck from a massive corporation, Stella was seriously injured. She was sitting in the passenger seat of her grandson's car at the time of the incident and had ordered a hot coffee at a McDonald's drive-thru. While parked, she put the cup between her legs and opened the lid, which spilled burning hot coffee all over her. Her sweat pants soaked up the hot liquid, keeping it in contact with her skin. She suffered third-degree burns on 6% of her body, ""including her vagina, perineum, buttocks, thighs, and groin area.""](https://www.caoc.org/?pg=facts)
6. [In January of 1919, The Great Molasses Flood took Boston's North End by storm. While you might think the famously thick, slow-moving syrup surely couldn't be all that deadly, the flood actually killed 21, injured 150, and caused massive damage. The 2.3 million gallons of molasses traveled at speeds up to 35 miles per hour. It ""knocked an elevated train off of its tracks, crushed buildings, moved a firehouse and other buildings off their foundations, and suffocated both humans and animals.""](https://www.boston.gov/news/100-years-ago-today-molasses-crashes-through-bostons-north-end)

Additionally, he requested his doctor to bleed him and lost 40% of his blood in the process. By the time his friend ‚Äî surgeon Willian Thornton ‚Äî arrived, Washington was dead and frozen due to the cold. Thornton proposed they thaw the former president in warm water, that he perform a tracheostomy, and that they inject Washington with lamb's blood in an attempt to revive him.](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-mysterious-death-of-george-washington)

13. [On March 18, 1937, tragedy struck a school in New London, TX, just fifteen minutes before classes were to end for the day. A massive explosion killed nearly 300, including students from fifth through eleventh grade. It was so big that it was felt by residents up to 40 miles away and reportedly shot a two-ton slab of concrete 200 feet away from the school. The explosion was caused by a cost-saving measure the school had taken earlier in the year in an effort to save $300 a month on gas. Plumbers had tapped a ""residue gas line""; however, there was a faulty connection, and gas had been pooling under the school. On the day of the explosion, some students reported watery eyes and feeling lightheaded, but odors hadn't yet been added to natural gas in the 1930s, so it went undetected. That very year, gas odorization was mandated in the state of Texas.](https://www.gasodorizer.com/gas-odorization-history/)

The violent attack went on despite Sandy coming after him with a snow shovel and, later, a knife. He even stopped to look her in the eyes.

Despite the flooding of six of its compartments, it remained afloat, so the captain ordered the ship to go at full speed to land. This only made it sink faster, so he ordered it to slow back down. Unfortunately, before it did, two lifeboats full of passengers fled the ship without getting permission first. Thinking they were escaping to safety, they were sucked into the ship's propellers.](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Britannic#:~:text=Having%20never%20operated%20as%20a,for%20the%20White%20Star%20Line.)

Overall, about half of those who survived being stranded ultimately succumbed to cannibalism. In most instances, they consumed the flesh of the members of their party who died naturally, though prior to that, they considered the men of the party dueling or drawing straws to determine who would be sacrificed for food. On one occasion, though, they killed two Native American men who'd joined them prior to being stranded.

Many of such cases are a result of violence from the pregnant person's partner, and ""68% of pregnancy-related homicides involved firearms.""

21. For hundreds of years, people dumped human, industrial, and animal waste into London's River Thames. By 1858, it caused such a horrendous odor to plague the city that it became dubbed ""The Great Stink."" The river's longtime pollution caused many Londoners to become violently ‚Äî and sometimes deathly ‚Äî ill with cholera, typhoid, and dysentery, as water wells lied near leaking cesspools and even water pumped from outside the city was still at risk of sewer contamination. In several cholera epidemics between 1831 and 1854, roughly 30,000 Londoners died. In 1855, Royal Institution scientist Michael Faraday claimed the river's water was ‚Äúan opaque pale brown fluid‚Äù and that near its bridges, people could see dense clouds of fecal matter at the surface.

Redditor u/senorgrub shared their perspective as a Gettysburg local, ""The part you don't think about is the aftermath. We think they fight and leave, but [it wasn't] that simple."" Infection and blood loss made battle wounds all the more deadly, which not only resulted in many dead bodies, but also contributed to the piles of amputated limbs. According to one Confederate soldier, ""There were piles of legs, feet, hands and arms, all thrown together, and at a distance, resembled piles of corn at a corn-shucking. Many of the feet still retained a boot or shoe.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1g4o1qb/comment/ls5he44/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
25. [Similarly, the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in and around New Orleans in 2005 was even more devastating than commonly believed. Approximately 1,170 people died in Louisiana, with 47% of the deaths being a result of acute or chronic disease and 33% being a result of drowning. 80% of New Orleans and the parishes surrounding it were flooded by 20 feet of water. Redditor u/thetruckboy shared their first-hand experience of it: ""I was down there twice immediately after the storm, and the stench from dead bodies was almost overwhelming.

Packaged as a ""humanitarian and philanthropic mission,"" Leopold II's reign was brutal.

Since Gene worked with a local charity for disabled children, Andy became a role model, and even caught the eyes of the media, with Nike offering a lifetime supply of shoes and the pair being featured on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.

37. A decent amount of what doctors know about hypothermia and how to deal with it came from ""Nazi science"" in WWII. The Dachau Hypothermia Experiments were ""medical experiments"" ‚Äî or, rather, brutal torture ‚Äî conducted at the Dachau concentration camp with the goal of discovering the most effective treatments for immersion hypothermia. The use of their findings was highly debated, with some arguing that using it would be wholly unethical, and others considering it valid medical data that could save lives and using it in their studies.
38. [There is a species of caterpillar in Great Britain ‚Äî the blue butterfly caterpillar (or large blue) ‚Äî that tricks ants into letting it inside their colony so it can feast on their larvae. The large blue releases pheromones and changes its body shape to mimic red ant larvae, thereby fooling the ants into thinking they got out of the colony. In turn, the ants bring them back in. It can also fool red ants into thinking it's the queen by imitating the sounds an adult queen ant makes, so the other ants feed it. In particular, it can imitate the queen in distress, which results in them feeding the caterpillar their young.

For example, in the summer of 2016, there was an anthrax outbreak that was linked to Bacillus anthracis spores from an old burial ground that had been previously frozen under the permafrost.

And then the other day I was in a coffee shop and the barista there had fine hair like me. And my first thought wasn't that it was inadequate, or ugly, or needed to be longer or fuller. My first thought was how nice it looked. It was minimally styled and just looked truly beautiful. Then, my sister sent me a photo of herself with extensions, which were giving her the long luxurious locks we have been dreaming of since middle school. And my first thought was that, while the hair looked beautiful, it changed her beauty toward something more... basic. It was the first week in maybe my whole life where I have actually *felt* like long thick hair with Victoria's Secret waves is not the only way to have beautiful hair. And that maybe I can embrace my fine/thin hair without it feeling like settling? 

I just thought I would share. Some people might even be looking at your hair right and thinking how nice it looks. ",3,1734721445.0,finehair,1,1.0,False
1hir21k,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hir21k/everything_is_disappearing/,Everything is disappearing ,"It began subtly... so subtly that most people didn‚Äôt notice. A missed meeting here, an unanswered text there. At first, no one connected the dots. People vanish all the time, runaways, accidents, those who simply want to disappear. But this wasn‚Äôt like that.  

Entire families stopped answering their phones. Offices sat empty despite calendars packed with back-to-back meetings. A friend would go to check on their neighbor and find an unlocked door, steaming coffee on the counter, and a house utterly empty. It wasn‚Äôt just absence‚Äîit was as if these people had been erased entirely. No signs of struggle. No trace of where they had gone.  

The media didn‚Äôt catch on at first. There were a few murmurs, a handful of ‚Äústrange disappearance‚Äù segments buried under the usual headlines. It wasn‚Äôt until the disappearances reached critical mass that they could no longer be ignored. By then, the world was already unraveling.  

The news exploded with theories, each more wild than the last:

 ‚ÄúMass Vanishings Across Continents‚Äù 

‚ÄúGlobal Panic as Millions Disappear Overnight.‚Äù 

 Speculation ran rampant. Some claimed it was divine judgment, others a cosmic event‚Äîa rupture in reality itself. Theories poured in faster than anyone could debunk them. Aliens, government experiments, some new and undetectable weapon‚Äîthe possibilities were endless, and none of them brought answers.  

At first, I clung to the hope that it wouldn‚Äôt touch me. The disappearances were somewhere else, happening to strangers. But denial is a fragile thing, and mine shattered when I went to visit my sister.  

Her front door was unlocked. Inside, the TV still played a muted rerun of some sitcom. A mug of coffee sat on the counter, its contents cold and congealing. Her shoes were by the door. Her keys hung on the hook. Everything was perfectly in place‚Äîeverything but her.  

I called her name until my throat was raw. I scoured the house, throwing open closets, yanking back curtains. I even checked the attic, as if she might have hidden herself away. But the house was silent, save for the distant laugh track of the forgotten TV.  

I stayed in her house until nightfall, waiting for her to come back, refusing to accept what I already knew. When the sun set and the world outside grew dark, the silence became unbearable. I turned the TV off and sat in the dim kitchen, listening to the hum of the fridge and the soft ticking of the wall clock. I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I couldn‚Äôt leave.  

By the time I finally returned to my own apartment, the world felt different. The city streets were quieter than they should have been, a stillness that set my nerves on edge. I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something vast and incomprehensible had shifted, and there was no going back.  


The disappearances didn‚Äôt slow‚Äîthey accelerated. Every day, more people vanished. The streets grew quieter, their usual clamor replaced by an eerie stillness. Public spaces emptied. Schools closed, their hallways echoing with memories of life that no longer existed. Grocery stores became desolate. Shelves sat bare, abandoned by workers who never came back.  

It wasn‚Äôt just people. The infrastructure began to fail within weeks. Power outages became commonplace. Water systems faltered. Radios crackled with static, punctuated by panicked broadcasts from stations running on backup generators. The hum of daily life‚Äîthe rhythm we all took for granted‚Äîhad been shattered.  

I wandered the city aimlessly, searching for something I couldn‚Äôt name. The roads were cluttered with abandoned cars. Homes stood with their doors wide open, curtains fluttering in the wind. I passed a playground one afternoon, the swings swaying gently as if children had just leapt off moments ago. But there were no children. No laughter. Only the wind.  

The air itself felt different‚Äîthicker, heavier, as though it carried the weight of unseen eyes. The skies grew dimmer. Clouds seemed to hover unnaturally low, their shapes distorted and alien. Even the light from the sun took on an uncanny quality, muted and lifeless.  

Buildings began to show signs of decay. Cracks spiderwebbed across concrete walls. Glass shattered without warning, scattering glittering shards onto deserted sidewalks. The city was crumbling, but it wasn‚Äôt natural. It was too fast, too chaotic. Entire structures collapsed as if the ground beneath them had simply given up.  

One evening, as I walked through what used to be a bustling market square, I noticed something strange. The edges of the world seemed to blur. Streets I had walked my entire life now seemed unfamiliar, their lines fading into a gray haze. It felt as though the city itself was being erased, piece by piece.  

I tried to cling to the memory of what the world had been, but even my own thoughts felt slippery, insubstantial. At night, I lay awake in my apartment, staring at the cracks creeping along the ceiling. I listened to the distant hum, low and steady, like a heartbeat resonating through the earth.  


It wasn‚Äôt just the disappearances anymore. It wasn‚Äôt just the decay. Something larger was happening‚Äîsomething we couldn‚Äôt see, couldn‚Äôt name.  

The stars were the first to go. At first, they flickered faintly, like candles struggling to stay lit. Then, one by one, they winked out entirely. The sky at night became a void, black and endless, as if the universe itself were closing its eyes.  

The earth followed. Sinkholes yawned open without warning, swallowing entire neighborhoods in an instant. Rivers changed course unpredictably, flooding cities one day and drying up the next. The ocean seemed to pulse unnaturally, tides surging far beyond their normal reach, leaving vast stretches of coastline barren before reclaiming them in a violent rush.  

The hum grew louder. It wasn‚Äôt just a sound‚Äîit was a presence. A vibration that resonated through everything, from the bones in my body to the air I breathed. It was constant now, a low and mournful drone that seemed to rise from the ground itself.  

I began seeing things, or thought I did. Fleeting shapes at the edges of my vision, dark and indistinct. Sometimes, I caught glimpses of them in reflections, hovering just behind me. Other times, I felt their presence in the room, heavy and oppressive, though I saw nothing when I turned to look.  

The few people I passed on the streets had the same haunted look in their eyes. They saw the shapes too.  

By then, the disappearances had become a blessing. It was better to vanish than to stay and watch the world collapse.  


The world was empty now. Or nearly so. I could feel it in the air, in the ground beneath my feet. The end was coming, but I didn‚Äôt know what that meant.  

The city had all but dissolved. Streets that had once been crowded with life now ended abruptly, fraying into voids of shifting static. Buildings twisted and folded into impossible shapes before fading entirely. The air shimmered with a heatless mirage, the horizon a smudge of gray nothingness.  

The hum was everywhere, louder than ever. It seemed to emanate from the cracks in the earth, from the empty skies, from inside my very bones. It wasn‚Äôt just a sound‚Äîit was a force, an inevitability.  

I found myself at the edge of the city one day, where the highway stretched into what used to be the countryside. Except there was no countryside. The road ended in a sheer drop into nothingness. I stood there for hours, staring into the void, trying to understand.  

Behind me, the city continued to unravel. Whole blocks disappeared in silence, leaving behind only barren expanses of gray dirt. The sky fractured, splintering into shards of light that bled together and faded.  

And then there was silence.  

I don‚Äôt know if I vanished, or if the world did. Perhaps it doesn‚Äôt matter. All that remains is the hum, resonating endlessly in the dark.",14,1734721412.0,nosleep,3,1.0,False

 Intended on sticking to roads and crushing the miles at a faster pace, but a gravel trail turned to single track, turned to taking a wrong turn and riding down an unofficial trail. Slick wet densely packed leaves, steep descent, hidden roots, sheer drop off‚Ä¶.. took a tumble and barked the life out of my shins on the top tube. Happy for my little first aid kit for some rapid pain relief. Got one heck of a welt on my left shin though. 

By the time I was back near home I was at 18.7 miles, partly due to forgetting to resuming my route on Kamoot, lost a mile and a bit. As punishment for my stupidity, I extended the route and grabbed a bit to eat at a local coffee shop/bakery.

1hiqwsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/1hiqwsu/im_out/,I‚Äôm out,"After almost 7 years together, marriage, and an ours baby, I‚Äôm done! I told DH I wanted a divorce. I asked if he would let our daughter and I move back to my home state so we could have a support system. He didn‚Äôt even fight me. 

I‚Äôm sad for my daughter that she‚Äôs going to grow up without a dad, but I can offer her a much better life without my soon to be ex weighing us down. 

This man repeatedly chose ss(10) over everyone else. He left me in the hospital the day after giving birth so he could hang out with ss(10) and watch movies all night. He tried to put ss(10) on a travel soccer team 3 weeks after our daughter‚Äôs birth. A team that travels up to 4 hours away every weekend! There was no discussion, no consideration for how he would afford the travel expenses, no concern for how that would affect me- a brand new first time mom or ss(15) who I guess was just going to stay home with me on DH‚Äôs time. I just got to be the bad guy, again, saying hell no! 

After everything I put into him and the relationship and all of the attacks from his ex, I finally realized I was getting nothing from this relationship. Literally nothing. As the breadwinner, cook, housekeeper, handyman, chauffeur, financial planner, homework tutor, and personal shopper of the house, my load was actually significantly heavier being with him than it will be being a single parent.

When we first got together, DH was so charming, kind, and caring. He used to leave me little love notes and make my coffee for me, just the way I liked it. He would meet me outside of work so I didn‚Äôt have to ride the train alone on nights that I worked late. He was the kind of guy that would give you the shirt off his back. I don‚Äôt know if that stuff stopped because the honeymoon stage wore off or if he just isn‚Äôt capable of balancing multiple relationships with different dynamics at once. 

It took 4 days to drive from where we lived to my home state. I cried multiple times for the relationship and the guilt I felt for leaving and taking his daughter, but I know this is the right thing to do. Sucks it took me having a child to open my eyes, but here we are, and I wouldn‚Äôt trade her for the world. ",42,1734721023.0,stepparents,13,0.93,False

I‚Äôve always loved the outdoors, and getting paid to patrol hiking trails and check on campsites felt like a dream. It was only a seasonal job, but I was still content with the allocated time I was given. 

I‚Äôd been assigned to a remote national park, miles from anything resembling civilization. My station was a tiny cabin in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by dense forest. There wasn‚Äôt even cell service most of the time. 

My first day on the job was pretty standard. I met Ed, my supervisor. He‚Äôs this older guy, maybe in his fifties, with the kind of weathered face that says he‚Äôs been out here way too long. Nice enough, but kind of distant. He handed me a basic book full of protocols: how to check for trail damage, what to do if you encounter a bear, how to handle lost hikers, stuff you‚Äôd expect.

But then, tucked in between the normal sections, there was this page titled ""Special Procedures."" The font looked older, like it hadn‚Äôt been updated in years, and it stood out immediately. The rules on the page...well, they were different.

\-Ignore the screaming after midnight.

\-Never acknowledge the lake when it reflects the moon.

\-If you hear footsteps behind you, do not turn around.

I actually laughed when I first read them. I thought it was some kind of joke the older rangers played on the newbies. But when I asked Ed about it, he didn‚Äôt laugh. He didn‚Äôt even smirk. He just said, ‚ÄúFollow them, and you‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù

That‚Äôs it. No explanation, no elaboration. I even tried pushing him a little, asking why these rules were in there and if this was some kind of hazing thing, but he just shrugged and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see.‚Äù

So, I put the book down and figured maybe it was just some weird tradition or superstition the park staff kept alive for fun. Maybe a way to freak out new hires. Whatever, right?

But my first few nights at the cabin started to change my mind.

You ever stay somewhere so quiet that it almost feels loud? That‚Äôs how it was out there. At night, it was like the forest itself was holding its breath. Sometimes, the only sound was the wind pushing through the trees. Other times, there wasn‚Äôt even that. The stillness made me jump at every creak of the cabin, every rustle in the bushes outside. And then there was this... feeling. Like I wasn‚Äôt really alone, even when I knew I was.

It was my third day in when I first heard the scream.

I was sitting at the tiny table in the cabin, halfway through a lukewarm cup of instant coffee. My eyes were glued to the book of rules again, trying to make sense of it all. It was late, past midnight, but I wasn‚Äôt tired. Something about the cabin made it hard to relax. Maybe it was how the floor creaked randomly, even when I wasn‚Äôt moving, or the way the wind outside never quite sounded like just wind.

I was flipping through the rules when it started.

At first, it was faint. I thought it was the wind again. But then it got louder- a sharp, piercing scream that cut through the stillness like a knife. It sounded human. A woman, maybe, or a kid. My stomach dropped.

I froze, my hand gripping the edge of the table so hard my knuckles turned white. My eyes darted back to the rules, to that stupid, yellowed page: Ignore the screaming after midnight.

Ignore it. Easy to write. Harder to do when it sounds like someone‚Äôs out there, begging for help.

I sat there for what felt like forever, just listening. The scream would rise, hold for a few seconds, and then fade. Then it would start again. My heart was racing, and before I knew it, I was standing by the cabin door, my hand on the knob.

I told myself it had to be something explainable. A hiker in trouble, maybe, or an animal that just sounded like a person. I mean, I‚Äôm a park ranger. It‚Äôs literally my job to check these things out, right?

I stepped outside.

The cold hit me first. It wasn‚Äôt a normal cold, it was biting, the kind that sinks into your bones. The forest was pitch black except for the faint cone of light from my flashlight. The scream came again, louder now, and I swung the beam in its direction, trying to see through the trees. My throat was dry, and every step I took felt heavier than the last.

Then... it stopped.

Not just the scream. Everything. The wind, the rustling leaves, the distant sounds of nocturnal animals- it all just cut out, like someone hit the mute button on the world. The silence was so thick I could hear my own breathing, quick and shallow.

I don‚Äôt know how long I stood there, frozen in place, but eventually, I turned back toward the cabin. Whatever I thought I was going to find out there, it wasn‚Äôt worth it. My skin crawled the entire way back, like something was watching me, just beyond the edge of the flashlight‚Äôs reach.

When I got inside, I locked the door. Twice.

The next morning, I asked Lisa about it. She‚Äôs another ranger, works the main station closer to the visitor center. Lisa‚Äôs the kind of person who always seems upbeat, like nothing rattles her, but when I brought up the scream, her face changed immediately. She went pale, and her eyes darted around the room like she was checking to see if anyone else was listening.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt follow it, did you?‚Äù she asked, her voice low.

I hesitated, not sure how much to admit. ‚ÄúI stepped outside,‚Äù I said finally. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt go far.‚Äù

Lisa‚Äôs expression darkened. She looked at me like I‚Äôd just signed my own death warrant. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how it starts,‚Äù she muttered. Then she stood up and walked out of the room like I wasn‚Äôt even there.

Later that day, I went out to patrol one of the popular trails near the cabin. It was my first time on that route, and for the most part, it seemed normal. Just trees, dirt, and the occasional squirrel. But about halfway through, I noticed something odd: the ground had these scuff marks, like someone had been running off the trail. The branches on the bushes nearby were broken, and the dirt was churned up, like there‚Äôd been a struggle.

I followed the marks for maybe twenty feet before I found it: a single boot. Muddy, torn, just sitting there in the middle of the forest. There was no sign of its owner.

My stomach twisted as I stared at it. It wasn‚Äôt just the boot itself, it was the way it was sitting there, like it had been dropped deliberately. It didn‚Äôt feel like something someone had just forgotten. It felt wrong.

When I got back to the station, I told Ed about it. He barely looked up from his paperwork.

‚ÄúThe forest takes what it wants,‚Äù he said, shrugging. Then he went back to his coffee like that was the end of it.

\-

The first time I broke a rule, I told myself it didn‚Äôt really count.

It was maybe a week in, and I‚Äôd almost started to feel like I had a routine down. Sure, the rules were weird, and yeah, the nights were unnervingly quiet, but I‚Äôd convinced myself that things weren‚Äôt as bad as I‚Äôd made them out to be. Then the footsteps started.

It was late, probably around 1AM, and I was lying in bed, trying to fall asleep. At first, I thought it was just the sound of branches tapping against the cabin, but then I realized it was rhythmic. Slow, deliberate. Someone was walking around the cabin.

I froze. My heart was pounding, but I kept telling myself to stay calm. I remembered the rule: If you hear footsteps behind you, do not turn around. Okay, fine, the footsteps weren't exactly behind me, but the logic seemed the same. Don‚Äôt engage, right?

The pacing continued. It circled the cabin, slow and steady, and I swear whoever, or whatever, it was would stop right by my window. I could feel it lingering there, just out of sight. The sound went on for hours. I tried covering my ears, but it didn‚Äôt help. I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was waiting for me to look.

I held out as long as I could. But by 3AM, my nerves were shot. I figured if someone was actually outside, I needed to know. What if it was a hiker who got lost? What if I was in danger? I pulled back the curtain just a crack.

Nothing. There was nothing out there. Just the trees, the dirt path, and the faint glow of the moon.

But the second I looked, the footsteps stopped. Like they‚Äôd been waiting for me to break. The silence that followed was even worse. It was thick, pressing down on me like gravity was being turned up on a dial. I didn‚Äôt sleep that night.

The next morning, I noticed something was off. My boots weren‚Äôt by the door where I‚Äôd left them, they were in the middle of the room. My radio, which I‚Äôd left off, was on, hissing with faint static. And when I glanced at the window, I swear my reflection didn‚Äôt move in time with me. It lagged, just a split second, but enough to make my stomach drop.

I told myself it was nothing, just my mind playing tricks. But then I patrolled the lake.

A few days later, I was out patrolling the trails near the lake at dusk. The sky was this brilliant orange, and the moon was just starting to rise. When I got to the water‚Äôs edge, I noticed the moon‚Äôs reflection. It was... too much. Too bright, too vivid, almost like it wasn‚Äôt just reflecting the moon but amplifying it.

I stood there for a second, hypnotized, before the rule clicked in my head: Never acknowledge the lake when it reflects the moon.

I snapped out of it and took a step back. But as I turned to leave, I saw a ripple in the water. There wasn‚Äôt any wind, no fish jumping. Just that ripple, spreading out from the center. And for a split second, I swear I saw a hand, pale and thin, reach up toward the surface.

I didn‚Äôt stick around to see what came next. I stumbled back to the trail and didn‚Äôt stop until I was halfway to the cabin.

That night, I had a dream. I was back at the lake, standing at the edge, but the moon‚Äôs reflection was shattered, like broken glass. I could hear something crawling out of the water, slow and deliberate, dragging itself toward me. I couldn‚Äôt move, couldn‚Äôt even scream. I woke up drenched in sweat, my heart racing.

But it wasn‚Äôt just a dream.

When I swung my legs out of bed, I felt cold, wet fabric. My boots were soaked, caked with mud. And there were footprints- muddy, unmistakable, leading from the door to my bed.

\-

Looking back, I think the first real warning sign wasn‚Äôt the footsteps or the lake. It was Lisa.

She‚Äôd been one of the first people I‚Äôd met on the job, and while she wasn‚Äôt exactly friendly, she was... present. She‚Äôd crack a joke now and then, talk about the hikes she liked to take. But after the footsteps and the lake? She changed. She was still around, technically, but she wasn‚Äôt Lisa anymore.

Her skin looked pale, like she‚Äôd been sick for weeks, and her eyes... I don‚Äôt even know how to describe it. They just didn‚Äôt seem to focus, like she was looking through me, not at me. She barely spoke unless it was necessary, and even then, her voice was flat, almost mechanical.

One morning, I asked her if she was okay. She just shrugged and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. Just tired.‚Äù But she wasn‚Äôt fine. And the worst part? Ed didn‚Äôt seem surprised. If anything, he avoided her.

When I brought it up to Ed later, he snapped at me. Ed, the guy who‚Äôd spent most of my first week cracking dad jokes and calling me ‚Äúnewbie.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe rules are there for a reason, Nick,‚Äù he said, glaring at me like I‚Äôd just insulted his entire family. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt follow them, and you deal with the fallout. That‚Äôs it. No exceptions.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of fallout are we talking about?‚Äù I pressed. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs actually happening here?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to know,‚Äù he muttered, turning back to his coffee like we hadn‚Äôt just had the most unsettling conversation of my life.

Later that day, I went out to patrol, trying to shake the weird tension between us. It was supposed to be a normal route, one I‚Äôd already done twice before, but something was different.

The trail I was on didn‚Äôt feel right. The trees seemed taller, like they were leaning in toward me, and the air was colder than it should‚Äôve been for midday. Still, I pushed forward. I don‚Äôt know why. Maybe I was hoping to find... something. Proof that I was still in control.

Then I saw them. Carvings in the trees- faces. They were warped and stretched, their mouths open in silent screams, their eyes too big, too round. They weren‚Äôt there the last time I‚Äôd walked this trail. I swear on my life they weren‚Äôt.

As I stood there staring, I heard something. It started as a faint whisper, like wind through the branches, but it grew louder. Words I couldn‚Äôt make out. Voices. Dozens of them, maybe more, all overlapping. My chest tightened, and I turned back the way I came, practically running until I was back at the cabin.

That night, the scream came back. Louder. Closer.

It didn‚Äôt just echo through the forest this time. It felt like it was inside my head, rattling around my skull, clawing at my thoughts. And then... I swear to you, I heard my name.

It was woven into the scream, whispered at first, then louder. My name, over and over. Like it was begging me, calling me.

I grabbed my flashlight and stood by the door, my hand on the handle. I almost opened it. I don‚Äôt know what stopped me. Maybe it was instinct. Maybe it was the rule. Either way, I let go of the handle and stepped back, my whole body shaking.

I didn‚Äôt sleep that night.

\-

I wish I could tell you this is where it stopped. That after ignoring the scream and the whispers and whatever the hell happened with the lake, I just rode out my time and left the park like a normal person. But that‚Äôs not how it works here.

It was the manual that tipped me off. One morning, I woke up to find it sitting on my kitchen table. I swear I‚Äôd left it in the drawer, but there it was, right next to my untouched breakfast. I thought someone had just left it out, but then I saw the writing.

The rules had changed.

The old ones were still there- ignore the screaming, don‚Äôt look at the lake. But new ones had appeared, scribbled in handwriting I didn‚Äôt recognize. One read: ‚ÄúThe cabin lights must stay on after dark.‚Äù Another: ‚ÄúIf you hear knocking from inside the walls, don‚Äôt investigate.‚Äù

But the one that made my stomach drop was at the bottom of the page: ‚ÄúYou are part of the cycle. You must stay.‚Äù

I stared at it for a long time, hoping I was misreading it or losing my mind. Part of me wanted to crumple the page, toss it in the trash, and pretend I hadn‚Äôt seen it. But I couldn‚Äôt. Something about it felt... final. It wasn‚Äôt instructions I could just ignore.

That afternoon, I went to find Ed. He was sitting on the porch of his cabin, sipping coffee like everything was fine, like none of this was happening.

‚ÄúEd,‚Äù I said, holding up the manual. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is this?‚Äù

He barely glanced at it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the rules.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give me that. The rules are changing. Look!‚Äù I flipped to the new entries, shoving it toward him. ‚ÄúWhat does this mean? What the hell is ‚Äòthe cycle‚Äô? Why does it say I have to stay?‚Äù

Ed didn‚Äôt say anything at first. He just stared at the horizon, his face unreadable. Finally, he sighed and put down his mug.

‚ÄúI told you to follow the rules, Nick. That‚Äôs all you had to do.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù My voice cracked, but I didn‚Äôt care. ‚ÄúYou knew this was going to happen, didn‚Äôt you? You knew, and you didn‚Äôt say anything!‚Äù

His eyes met mine, and for the first time, I saw the cracks in his calm demeanor. He looked... tired. Defeated.

‚ÄúThe rules aren‚Äôt just there to keep you safe,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre part of the agreement.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat agreement?‚Äù

‚ÄúWith the forest,‚Äù he said, his voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúIt takes what it wants. The rules are how we keep it at bay. But once you start breaking them...‚Äù He trailed off, shaking his head. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt undo it, Nick. It‚Äôs already claimed you.‚Äù

That night, I didn‚Äôt bother trying to sleep. I sat at the table, the manual open in front of me, the words ‚ÄúYou must stay‚Äù burned into my brain.

The footsteps started around midnight. At first, they were faint, just a soft shuffle outside the cabin. Then they grew louder, circling the walls, pausing by the windows. I kept my eyes on the manual, my foot shaking nervously trying to focus.

Then came the knocking. It was slow at first, deliberate, like someone tapping their knuckles against the wood. But it didn‚Äôt come from the door. It was inside the walls.

I tried to block it out, repeating the rules in my head like a prayer. But then I made the mistake of looking up. My reflection was in the window, staring back at me.

Except it wasn‚Äôt me.

It looked like me, same face, same clothes, but its expression was wrong. Its mouth curved into a grin I wasn‚Äôt making, its eyes darker than they should‚Äôve been. It raised a hand, pointing behind me.

I turned around. Nothing was there.

But the footsteps inside the cabin didn‚Äôt stop.

Ed came to my cabin the next morning. He didn‚Äôt knock or ask permission to come in, just opened the door, stepped inside, and stood there like he belonged.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre taking the north patrol today,‚Äù he said. His voice was flat, like we hadn‚Äôt had that whole conversation about the cycle, like I hadn‚Äôt spent the night hearing footsteps inside my cabin.

I didn‚Äôt argue. What would‚Äôve been the point? If I refused, he‚Äôd just give me some cryptic warning, maybe even shove the manual at me. I nodded and grabbed my gear. The manual stayed on the table. I didn‚Äôt want it near me.

The patrol route was one of the longer ones, winding past the lake and cutting through a part of the forest I‚Äôd avoided since starting the job. It wasn‚Äôt a hard trail, but something about it felt... heavy. Like the air itself was thicker, harder to breathe.

I passed the lake first. The surface was glassy, perfectly still, reflecting the sky like a giant mirror. I kept my head down, refusing to look too closely. But out of the corner of my eye, I swear I saw something, someone, just beneath the surface. Lisa. Her pale face, her eyes wide, staring up at me. I don‚Äôt know if it was real or if my mind was playing tricks, but I hurried past, not daring to stop.

Further down the trail, I found a flashlight that belonged to Harris, another ranger, lying in the dirt. It was caked with mud, the lens cracked. I picked it up without thinking, then immediately dropped it. The metal was ice cold, like it had been sitting in a freezer, not out in the open sun.

That‚Äôs when I started to notice the forest wasn‚Äôt quiet anymore. There were faint whispers coming from the trees, layered and overlapping, like a hundred voices murmuring just out of earshot. I couldn‚Äôt make out the words, but I didn‚Äôt need to. I knew they were for me.

By the time I reached the park boundary, my legs felt like lead. The air had a strange pull to it, like the forest itself was holding me back. I stopped at the edge of the treeline, staring out at the empty road beyond.

And an intrusive thought hit me- I could leave. Right then, right there. I could drop my gear, walk out of the forest, and never look back. I‚Äôd lose the job, sure, but I‚Äôd keep my life. My real life. The one I‚Äôd had before all of this.

But then I thought about the manual, the rules, Ed‚Äôs warnings. ‚ÄúThe forest takes what it wants,‚Äù he‚Äôd said. What if leaving wasn‚Äôt an escape? What if I took something with me, whatever this was, and it followed me home? Or worse, what if leaving threw everything off balance, broke the agreement, and dragged someone else into this nightmare?

I stood there for what felt like hours, staring at the road. My mind was screaming at me to run, but my legs wouldn‚Äôt move. The whispers grew louder, circling around me, wrapping me in their invisible grip.

And then, just like that, they stopped. The forest went silent. Completely, utterly silent.

I turned back, my heart pounding. The trees seemed taller, darker, and the trail I‚Äôd come down looked like it had never been there at all.

I don‚Äôt know why I did it, but I started walking back.

\-

I don‚Äôt remember much about walking back to the cabin. It felt like the forest had swallowed me whole, and when I stepped through the door, I couldn‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôd escaped or walked deeper into something far worse. The air inside was stale and cold. My body ached like I‚Äôd run a marathon, but the exhaustion wasn‚Äôt just physical. It was in my bones. My mind.

I locked the door, bolted it twice, and sat down at the table. The manual was still there, waiting. I opened it slowly, flipping through the pages. The rules were the same, or at least, I thought they were. I read each one carefully, over and over, like I was memorizing scripture.

I understood now. The rules weren‚Äôt suggestions. They weren‚Äôt folklore. They were survival. As long as I followed them, I could stay. I wouldn‚Äôt disappear like Lisa. I wouldn‚Äôt dissolve into whispers like Harris. The forest might have claimed me, but it wouldn‚Äôt take me all at once.

I fell into a routine after that. Patrol during the day, lock the door at night. I didn‚Äôt ask questions anymore. I didn‚Äôt peek through the curtains when the footsteps started. I didn‚Äôt let myself think about leaving, because I knew there wasn‚Äôt anywhere to go.

Sometimes, I still heard the scream. It‚Äôs always distant now, muffled, like it‚Äôs coming from miles away. Maybe that‚Äôs what happens, you fade into the forest slowly, until you‚Äôre just another sound in the dark.

I don‚Äôt know how long it‚Äôs been. Time gets slippery out here. The days blur together, and the nights feel endless. I‚Äôve stopped counting the seasons, stopped looking at the calendar. The forest doesn‚Äôt care about dates, so why should I?

But something new has changed things.

Last week, I saw headlights through the trees- a new ranger pulling into the station. I watched from a distance as Ed handed him the manual. The kid looked so young, so confident. I wanted to warn him. I wanted to scream at him to leave now while he still could.

But I didn‚Äôt.

Because the forest was watching. And the rules are clear.

He has unknowingly became a player in this game. And I just pray he doesn't lose.

I was addicted to these little caffeine oat bars, so it took me a while to cut those out and then I did some traveling and chose to loosen up my diet while overseas. 

Well, now I'm back and decided to fully commit - with the exception of coffee, hot tea (no sweetener), aspartame-free chewing gum (with 1g of carbs), and electrolytes with stevia (those are my only ""crutches"" now). I think I'm on day 5 of this stricter version of carnivore to where I'm finally having low enough carbs that I should be getting into ketosis.

So far, I must admit it's not going too well. I feel bloated and constipated (and I am eating spoonfuls of butter and beef tallow every day, so I think I should be getting enough fat). I've gained a few pounds (although I do not have excess weight to lose - I'm healthy). I used to be able to spring out of bed early, now I'm sleeping in and it takes me about 30 mins of laying there before I have the will to get up. My mood has been extremely low and melancholic - feeling depressed, unmotivated, angsty, constantly distracted, irritable, etc. (which has almost exactly correlated with when I cut out all the carbs 5 days ago). And I am utterly exhausted. Tons of brain fog. Everything I used to do feels like it takes 5x the energy and effort and I'm even feeling dizzy and lightheaded when I get up.

Despite these symptoms, I'm having grace for myself bc I know it can take a little while for your body to switch into fat-burning mode. But I guess I just expected it would happen in a couple of days, especially since I was having less that 50 grams of carbs for at least one month every day before that (so it's not like this was an immediate big transition). I'm really hoping a switch is going to flip soon and I'm going to feel better because the way I feel now is absolutely dreadful.

So I'm curious, how long did it take yall to adjust to the carnivore diet? It seems like many people experience instantaneous benefits, but I see for others, it takes time. I'm not really looking for medical advice here, just some motivation to keep it up lol. So I'd love to hear your stories about your first few days/weeks on carnivore. Can it really take weeks to become fat-adapted? Did your energy come back suddenly or gradually?

1hiqolj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1hiqolj/everything_is_disappearing/,Everything is disappearing ,"It began subtly... so subtly that most people didn‚Äôt notice. A missed meeting here, an unanswered text there. At first, no one connected the dots. People vanish all the time, runaways, accidents, those who simply want to disappear. But this wasn‚Äôt like that.  

Entire families stopped answering their phones. Offices sat empty despite calendars packed with back-to-back meetings. A friend would go to check on their neighbor and find an unlocked door, steaming coffee on the counter, and a house utterly empty. It wasn‚Äôt just absence‚Äîit was as if these people had been erased entirely. No signs of struggle. No trace of where they had gone.  

The media didn‚Äôt catch on at first. There were a few murmurs, a handful of ‚Äústrange disappearance‚Äù segments buried under the usual headlines. It wasn‚Äôt until the disappearances reached critical mass that they could no longer be ignored. By then, the world was already unraveling.  

The news exploded with theories, each more wild than the last:

 ‚ÄúMass Vanishings Across Continents‚Äù 

‚ÄúGlobal Panic as Millions Disappear Overnight.‚Äù 

 Speculation ran rampant. Some claimed it was divine judgment, others a cosmic event‚Äîa rupture in reality itself. Theories poured in faster than anyone could debunk them. Aliens, government experiments, some new and undetectable weapon‚Äîthe possibilities were endless, and none of them brought answers.  

At first, I clung to the hope that it wouldn‚Äôt touch me. The disappearances were somewhere else, happening to strangers. But denial is a fragile thing, and mine shattered when I went to visit my sister.  

Her front door was unlocked. Inside, the TV still played a muted rerun of some sitcom. A mug of coffee sat on the counter, its contents cold and congealing. Her shoes were by the door. Her keys hung on the hook. Everything was perfectly in place‚Äîeverything but her.  

I called her name until my throat was raw. I scoured the house, throwing open closets, yanking back curtains. I even checked the attic, as if she might have hidden herself away. But the house was silent, save for the distant laugh track of the forgotten TV.  

I stayed in her house until nightfall, waiting for her to come back, refusing to accept what I already knew. When the sun set and the world outside grew dark, the silence became unbearable. I turned the TV off and sat in the dim kitchen, listening to the hum of the fridge and the soft ticking of the wall clock. I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I couldn‚Äôt leave.  

By the time I finally returned to my own apartment, the world felt different. The city streets were quieter than they should have been, a stillness that set my nerves on edge. I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something vast and incomprehensible had shifted, and there was no going back.  


The disappearances didn‚Äôt slow‚Äîthey accelerated. Every day, more people vanished. The streets grew quieter, their usual clamor replaced by an eerie stillness. Public spaces emptied. Schools closed, their hallways echoing with memories of life that no longer existed. Grocery stores became desolate. Shelves sat bare, abandoned by workers who never came back.  

It wasn‚Äôt just people. The infrastructure began to fail within weeks. Power outages became commonplace. Water systems faltered. Radios crackled with static, punctuated by panicked broadcasts from stations running on backup generators. The hum of daily life‚Äîthe rhythm we all took for granted‚Äîhad been shattered.  

I wandered the city aimlessly, searching for something I couldn‚Äôt name. The roads were cluttered with abandoned cars. Homes stood with their doors wide open, curtains fluttering in the wind. I passed a playground one afternoon, the swings swaying gently as if children had just leapt off moments ago. But there were no children. No laughter. Only the wind.  

The air itself felt different‚Äîthicker, heavier, as though it carried the weight of unseen eyes. The skies grew dimmer. Clouds seemed to hover unnaturally low, their shapes distorted and alien. Even the light from the sun took on an uncanny quality, muted and lifeless.  

Buildings began to show signs of decay. Cracks spiderwebbed across concrete walls. Glass shattered without warning, scattering glittering shards onto deserted sidewalks. The city was crumbling, but it wasn‚Äôt natural. It was too fast, too chaotic. Entire structures collapsed as if the ground beneath them had simply given up.  

One evening, as I walked through what used to be a bustling market square, I noticed something strange. The edges of the world seemed to blur. Streets I had walked my entire life now seemed unfamiliar, their lines fading into a gray haze. It felt as though the city itself was being erased, piece by piece.  

I tried to cling to the memory of what the world had been, but even my own thoughts felt slippery, insubstantial. At night, I lay awake in my apartment, staring at the cracks creeping along the ceiling. I listened to the distant hum, low and steady, like a heartbeat resonating through the earth.  


It wasn‚Äôt just the disappearances anymore. It wasn‚Äôt just the decay. Something larger was happening‚Äîsomething we couldn‚Äôt see, couldn‚Äôt name.  

The stars were the first to go. At first, they flickered faintly, like candles struggling to stay lit. Then, one by one, they winked out entirely. The sky at night became a void, black and endless, as if the universe itself were closing its eyes.  

The earth followed. Sinkholes yawned open without warning, swallowing entire neighborhoods in an instant. Rivers changed course unpredictably, flooding cities one day and drying up the next. The ocean seemed to pulse unnaturally, tides surging far beyond their normal reach, leaving vast stretches of coastline barren before reclaiming them in a violent rush.  

The hum grew louder. It wasn‚Äôt just a sound‚Äîit was a presence. A vibration that resonated through everything, from the bones in my body to the air I breathed. It was constant now, a low and mournful drone that seemed to rise from the ground itself.  

I began seeing things, or thought I did. Fleeting shapes at the edges of my vision, dark and indistinct. Sometimes, I caught glimpses of them in reflections, hovering just behind me. Other times, I felt their presence in the room, heavy and oppressive, though I saw nothing when I turned to look.  

The few people I passed on the streets had the same haunted look in their eyes. They saw the shapes too.  

By then, the disappearances had become a blessing. It was better to vanish than to stay and watch the world collapse.  


The world was empty now. Or nearly so. I could feel it in the air, in the ground beneath my feet. The end was coming, but I didn‚Äôt know what that meant.  

The city had all but dissolved. Streets that had once been crowded with life now ended abruptly, fraying into voids of shifting static. Buildings twisted and folded into impossible shapes before fading entirely. The air shimmered with a heatless mirage, the horizon a smudge of gray nothingness.  

The hum was everywhere, louder than ever. It seemed to emanate from the cracks in the earth, from the empty skies, from inside my very bones. It wasn‚Äôt just a sound‚Äîit was a force, an inevitability.  

I found myself at the edge of the city one day, where the highway stretched into what used to be the countryside. Except there was no countryside. The road ended in a sheer drop into nothingness. I stood there for hours, staring into the void, trying to understand.  

Behind me, the city continued to unravel. Whole blocks disappeared in silence, leaving behind only barren expanses of gray dirt. The sky fractured, splintering into shards of light that bled together and faded.  

And then there was silence.  

I don‚Äôt know if I vanished, or if the world did. Perhaps it doesn‚Äôt matter. All that remains is the hum, resonating endlessly in the dark.

1hiqohi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leadership/comments/1hiqohi/wfh_employee_constantly_leaving_their_desk_for/,WFH Employee constantly leaving their desk for their dog... how do I approach this sensitively?,"I have a work from home employee who has an elderly dog. This dog is their life... They do not have the option of an office, and in general, we are pretty cool about little life needs and benefits that come with working from home. 

  
As of late, however, matters relating to the dog have increased quite drastically. This dog is all they talk about. She's pawing at the door, she's whining, she won't go out on the balcony, she needs to be fed, walked, peed, she's made a mess inside... it is endless and tiring. They live in an apartment so when they have to take the dog out, it consists of getting everyone geared up, going down the elevator, finding grass, \*hoping\* she does her business (apparently she usually doesn't), and then coming back up - 10 minutes minimum. They get a lunch break of course and typically I have no problems when someone says back in a bit for a coffee, snack, walk about the house, laundry, etc., however the number of times this employee is being removed from their desk a day is truly getting excessive. 

  
I have asked before if they've considered getting perhaps a dog walker or someone to come and check on the dog as it takes up a lot of their time and day and they've insisted that she will not go with anyone but themselves. 

  
How do I approach this subject? What do I say or suggest? I want to be sensitive as it if effectively his child, but also it is starting to cause too many work disruptions. I don't want to be too much of a hard-ass as I am sensitive to it. But we are a shift-critical company where being available and online at your desk is a hugely important aspect of your role, so it's proving problematic, and to be honest, my team and I are sick of hearing about it. 

  
NOTE: I also have a dog. I also work from home. I have had to leave my shift to walk my dog maybe twice in the past 6 months, other than that it is before, after, and during lunch. ",0,1734720395.0,Leadership,12,0.5,False

i recently moved to florida & am in a walkable area with lots of small businesses. my idea was to go store-to-store and offer my services (a minimum of 30 photos of the store + products) for $100 a shoot. i‚Äôd take the photos, edit them on my own time, send thumbnails over to the business owners, have them send the cash & then send the full quality photos over

i understand this is completely too little (30 photos for $100) but i want an attractive price to buyers who may or may not already be seeking photos for their business. a price where i can walk in and say ‚Äúhey, can you let me take some photos and if you like them you can send me $100 and i can give them to you for whatever purpose,‚Äù and owners would agree easily because it‚Äôs just that good of a price. im also a 19yo college student so i dont care too much for making a legit photographer‚Äôs salary‚Äîbut i do want some input on my prices

i‚Äôm not interested in renting any gear or providing any license, just simply saying ‚Äúyou can use my photos however you want once you‚Äôve sent the money over.‚Äù is this a good idea or should i go about this differently or plan a little harder? i‚Äôm pretty open to whatever. thanks in advance!",2,1734720249.0,photography,3,1.0,False

I got this gardenia from a nursery 2 weeks ago. That poor thing was root bound so much that I had to literally but the plastic nursery pot to get her out. I had her inside at that time on a semi shade since it was too cold (I'm in Houston).

I transplanted her 1 week ago and put her outside. I didn't really break up the root bound that much; I just shook and tapped several times to loosen it up a bit. I don't want to damage the roots.

 I potted her in a self watering planter, but I covered the ""self watering""part with some geotextile and then put 1 inch of lava rock layer on top of it because I didn't want her to have soggy legs. The soil mixture is for acidic and very rich ( I added some used coffee grounds to make it more acidic as well).

I added some mulch in the soil mixture and on top of the soil. The soil seems to have good drainage; it's moist but definitely not soggy. She doesn't receive direct sunlight due to ~Winter~ but is is mostly sunny.

My nephew has a basketball game at 5:30pm today. It‚Äôs a 2 hour drive. I‚Äôve known about this for weeks. I‚Äôve been working with my therapist to better navigate the time blindness. I made a schedule for myself today with specific times. I started using the Todoist app to help with planning (also novelty bc new fun app to use). I woke up an hour or so later than I wanted to but I‚Äôm on my period so fine, I need extra rest. Still woke up at a reasonable enough time that I had about 5 hours to prepare before I wanted to leave my house (aiming to leave by 2:30p bc traffic, need to check into hotel etc plus I know I have time blindness so however long it‚Äôs supposed to take to do something, I must double it). I really wanted to make Christmas cookies for my family. I‚Äôm not sure what happened to my first 2.5 hours of being awake but all of a sudden it was noon and the batter has to be chilled for minimum 3 hours. I made the batter but now I don‚Äôt have time to finish the cookies. Cool. Will accept the loss. Now moving on to packing, trash etc before I leave for the weekend. The tags on my car are also expired bc forgot that was a thing. I also need to wash some clothes for the weekend and also plan what to wear. Why didn‚Äôt I do this earlier???? I thought I would have time. So then my brain starts short circuiting bc I have to do all the things and can‚Äôt figure out how to prioritize. Then I realized I was so hungry I was nearly about to pass out because all I had consumed today was coffee and leftover pumpernickel bread from Cheesecake Factory. So now in order to have the energy to do any of the tasks I need to do, I need to feed myself. Didn‚Äôt plan for food. Now it‚Äôs 1:30pm, an hour before I planned to leave, and I‚Äôm sitting in my car in a parking lot scarfing down Subway because I have such poor planning and time management skills. 

This is how every single weekend goes for me. I‚Äôm so tired of myself lol. I thought I had the upper hand against myself because last night I planned out my schedule AND wrapped all of the Christmas gifts I need to bring. I was wrong. Was still unable to execute and I also somehow thought I would have time to go to the gym today????? 

If you‚Äôre still reading, thanks for listening. Just needed to let it out. Going to just do the best I can with my remaining time and give myself grace. At least I tried ",5,1734719930.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

I couldn't disagree more. It's more of a contemplative exploration of fame and what it means to be an artist. Definitely more melancholy than The Kick Inside, but every single song is great. Tunes like ""In the Warm Room"" and ""Coffee Homeground"" are among the most underrated in her oeuvre, not to mention classics like ""Wow,"" ""Hammer Horror,"" and ""Kashka From Baghdad.""

I lost my dad 29th of September this year. He was only 56 and died of heart failure and other complications. My dad and I were close when I was younger, but drifted apart in my teenage years. We just didn‚Äôt agree on certain things, and without making too long of a story of it, he broke up our family by cheating on my mom and I spent a long time feeling angry and frustrated at how distant our relationship was because I felt disappointed. I would spend a lot of time hoping our relationship would get better, that he‚Äôd be my dad that I looked up to,like I used to when I was younger. We would talk on the phone, and meet for coffee occasionally,but our relationship was not close as much as I would like it to be. 

Fast forward to July of this year and I found out that he is in hospital. I went to go visit him every day until he passed. I watched him get weaker and weaker, it was heartbreaking. In that moment, when I saw him so weak and frail, all of the disappointments and anger I felt towards him felt so unimportant. I just wanted to be there for him. I was, until he died. I organized his funeral and gave him a dignified farewell. I just find myself thinking about how close we were in those moments when I saw him in the hospital, and I regret and wish we could have had that when he was alive. I feel like I let my disappointment in him get in the way of our relationship, that perhaps we could have had a better relationship if only I didn‚Äôt wait for an emergency to shake me out of my own head. 

Sorry for the long rambling post, but I am just tired of writing about this in my journal. I am hoping that somewhere in the world there‚Äôs someone who has felt this way before and could just let me know that I am not alone in this feeling.",2,1734719674.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

1hiqcnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1hiqcnx/its_so_unfair/,It‚Äôs so unfair,"Hi everyone,

Basically there will be just some rant from me about how the whole IBS is unfair to me. 

So I don‚Äôt smoke or drink alcohol (I might have one glass of champagne on Christmas). I don‚Äôt drink coffee and only drink herbal teas. I‚Äôve always eaten at home, I might go out to eat maybe like once a month or so. No junk food, only everything freshly cooked with minimal oil, no red meats or processed food. I‚Äôve always eaten just like one chocolate or week or so. So almost no sugar. But now with IBS no sugar at all. I‚Äôve always had perfect eating habits I would say. Even when I was a poor student, I didn‚Äôt ever choose deliveries or junk food, I was cooking for myself: soups, porridges, all the healthy stuff. 

I exercise and I have always been taking some supplements like vitamin B, D, C, magnesium, etc etc. 

And yet I have developed IBS and I have abdominal pain every single day, bloating, gas, diarrhea etc etc. 

And what‚Äôs unfair to me is that I see so many people who eat everything, croissants for breakfast, chocolates, junk foods, go out every day, drink litres of coffee, drink alcohol every weekend and they are healthy. No stomach issues whatsoever. I‚Äôm so fed up with this. There are days when I don‚Äôt know whether I can live with this IBS any longer. It‚Äôs making me depressed and suicidal. 

Anyone else have the same thoughts about how unfair it is? ",3,1734719501.0,ibs,3,1.0,False

1hiq9jn,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/comments/1hiq9jn/socializing_is_fucked_up/,Socializing is fucked up.,"How the fuck do you meet new people dude?? And why has become so tough??? I live in Bangalore. 21M. Recently finished college. Shitty college with shitty people. Boys crying about girls not replying them and girls crying about not getting likes on insta post. Met only a handful of people of good people and had a good enough time that I didn‚Äôt run away from that place. But now they are also gone. I was looking to connect with new people, hang out, party, maybe learn a thing or two about different things. Sounds easy right?? But damn‚Ä¶ cracking a job interview was easier than this!! No school friends. No college friends. Workplace is filled with oldies. I know, that is good for my career but there are things happening in life other than career too, right?? 

I thought let‚Äôs try going on discord. Joined few famous servers. But story is same there. Guy won‚Äôt reply you if you don‚Äôt have a vagina and girl won‚Äôt reply you until you shower her with attention and complements. Then I though Reddit, posted to few subreddits, but mods removed my post. Tried joining whatsapp communities of meetups. And guess what, Bangalore has meetups only for startup enthusiasts. Now shall I go out in a park and ask people to be my friends using some sort of pickup lines?? India is not US to pull out shit like this. I‚Äôd be thrashed.

Before deciding on this stupid idea to find friends, I was planning to go to therapy cuz I am so fucking bored that paying a person to listen to me seemed a good idea too. But then I thought maybe I am too young for therapy and let‚Äôs spend money on friends rather than therapy. But fuck it man.

Also, if you are judging me, I am not an introvert or a loner. I still know a lot of people, I got friends, cousins, relatives around me. I just thought it would be nice going out, meet some guys, hang out, explore new places, have a coffee/beer, etc. But I understood that people today will just hide behind a screen and scroll till doom.",4,1734719276.0,OffMyChestIndia,4,0.71,False

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements and electrolytes.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

1hiq49p,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1hiq49p/reflections_a_life_of_meaning_purpose_and/,"Reflections: A Life of Meaning, Purpose, and Happiness. My search for meaning. ","I have always questioned what life is all about, why we are here, and how I can live a fulfilling life. Were we just put here to suffer and then die? Many things happening in society just don‚Äôt make sense to me. I am appalled by society's moral decay, the death of family values, the craze for social media fame, likes, and subscriptions, the narcissism and materialism of the world, and the overall superfluity of life today. I just want a simple yet meaningful and fulfilling life. Like it‚Äôs the 80s or 90s: I want to fall in love and be loved.

Because:
Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, and it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.

At this point in my life, I have my priorities straight. I now know exactly what I want from life and what will bring me everlasting happiness. I love the simple things ‚Äî laughing, cooking, having home dinners with family and friends, helping others grow, mentoring, home parties with games, quiet moments to myself, in my thoughts, walks under the moonlit skies, a quiet evening at home, the gentle cuddles of a loving partner, watching the sunset, a good meal, a walk by the beach, and creating simple, sweet, unforgettable memories. I deeply enjoy the peace, comfort, and reassurance of being around a loving partner. That gentle reminder that this right here is home and nothing else matters but us and what we do and achieve together. No competition, no jealousy, no ego and pride, no anger or hate, no fears of losing each other, no ‚Äúme vs you‚Äù. Us. 

I dream of the whole package in life: Picture a small beautiful dream and cozy house with lots of space and a backyard, a family with adorable, happy, and well-raised kids running around, a happy beautiful wife, and overall, a beautiful, loving, and happy family, with lots of love and laughter. Growing old together. Ultimately, this is the most important and precious thing in life. This is a life worth living, far beyond pursuing wealth, status, titles, fame, etc. My family should be my priority and ultimate responsibility in every aspect and I want a woman who shares this mindset. I work hard but my hard work and ambition aren‚Äôt just to have money (I don‚Äôt need much money for myself, I don‚Äôt have many responsibilities, and I am not materialistic. Fancy things such as cars, jewelry, shoes, and clothes do not impress me). I aim to achieve financial freedom solely so I can have much more time with my family, provide a comfy life, afford a dream home with comfortable living spaces and beautiful play areas, and be able to eliminate the stress and tension that come with financial worries. Also, as a man, working hard and achieving goals adds meaning and purpose to my life. And I would love someone who encourages me with words of affirmation, even though I need to encourage myself more. I don't like just sitting around doing nothing. At the same time, pursuing financial freedom shouldn‚Äôt jeopardize quality family time or time with my loved ones. I want to have a traditional family unit with a modern twist. This means that I don‚Äôt expect my wife to do all the housework and childcare. I don‚Äôt want to just throw money at her and sit back. These are also my responsibilities. So it is normal to share house chores, cooking, and other such endeavors, especially if she has a career. 

I would love a partner to share love, comfort, memories, and life with. I want to have family breakfasts, enjoy family dinners, pick up my kids from school, cook dinner together with my woman while dancing in the kitchen, adore and appreciate my woman, and read bedtime stories to my children, I want to be that couple who hold each other in the living room and slowly dance to evening love songs, I want to cuddle her and kiss her neck as we dance, dance that very slowly turns intimate, with touching, kissing, and slow passionate lovemaking (not just sex - I differentiate lovemaking from having sex), with the background music still playing, just have pillow talk, and kiss my wife goodnight every day, I want to put up Christmas decorations with her and wrap our children‚Äôs gifts together. To go and countdown on New Year‚Äôs Eve while holding hands. I want to wake up every morning loving life without complaints, appreciating what I have, and thanking God for life. I want to train, nurture, and watch our beautiful children and someday hold my wife and share a cry of joy as we watch our babies fade into the sunset of adulthood and college, knowing that we raised them to be the best society can offer, capable of handling all that comes their way and trusting us to be there for them in the inevitable challenges of their teenage years. I want my wife to be my partner in crime. My most trusted confidant, whom I can rely on 100% to handle our affairs when I am not around and vice versa because I believe in her abilities and intelligence. She should be the one I run to for advice and counsel when I am stuck. She should be the one I count on to manage and advise on our finances and she will reign as queen over our affairs at home, with my healthy support, and be by me as I strive to put food on our table, and a shelter over our head and to provide and protect our household.

I want us to be that old couple walking down the street holding hands, sitting at the park feeding the pigeons, or helping each other pick groceries. I want to be that couple who still makes jokes at each other and laughs even in their 80s, who welcomes their children and grandchildren during Christmas and other holidays and have a blast telling them stories of their lives‚Äîthe same old stories they've already told a million times.

To achieve this, I need to trust my woman enough to completely lay down my guard, be myself, and be completely vulnerable and emotionally available. To listen to her needs love her dearly and always reassure her of this love. I need to learn to communicate better, uplift her, openly praise the great things about her, and support her endeavors. I need to seek help for any issues that might sabotage our relationship. And learn to set boundaries when I need them and respect her boundaries when they are set. I need to take action to make our relationship better: Buy her flowers, plan dates, organize fun events, prepare surprises, and do other things that show her how much I am committed to making our relationship grow and our bond stronger and bring liveliness to the relationship. She shouldn't carry all the burden of making our relationship work.

Family means the world to me, coming from what I think is one of the best families ever. I want to start my own and be an even better father and husband than my father was. He was the best father in the world. I draw inspiration from him and many father figures in my life. I want to be a dad, not just a father and I want to be a husband, I don‚Äôt want to just get married or have a wife. I want to contribute to the world by raising children with strong moral principles. Children who do not add to the suffering of the world but grow to be men and women of strong values. Who live a life that has depth in a world that is plagued by the constant pursuit of superficial things. A world full of deceit and evil. Who grow to be good people, worthy of respect and honor, and who treat others with dignity. Children that others will say of them, ‚ÄúYou are a good person‚Äù.

Finding the right person takes time, and I‚Äôm okay with that. Once I find someone reciprocating my love and who shares this vision, I will be locked in and will give her all the assurance she needs to feel secure and safe in our relationship. I will never let go when trouble comes but try to find solutions instead. I understand just how important open communication is in that difficult moment. I understand just how precious reassurance is to the peace and well-being of my woman. Not just verbal reassurance. Reassurance also shows through actions and even in day-to-day conversations. Referring to ‚Äúus‚Äù and ‚Äúour‚Äù, not ‚Äúme‚Äù and ‚Äúmy‚Äù when having discussions. Reassurance gives her the peace and comfort needed to stay happy and grounded in what we have. It also makes her feel that this right here is home for her and I am not going anywhere. It makes her free to let go knowing that I am hers and nothing will change. It takes away her anxiety and best of all, it makes me love her even more. She should never question her place and worth in my life. The best lessons are learned from bitter experiences. 

I do not find pleasure in wild adventures such as partying, clubbing, getting drunk cheap flings, or other things that complicate my life. I don‚Äôt smoke, do drugs, get drunk, or pursue casual sex, and I vow to myself to never cheat on my partner as this is one of the very few sins that I can't forgive in a relationship. I am also taking the time to understand my emotions and personality through reading, watching videos, and therapy so that I will be a well-rounded man who understands his mind, personality, and emotions and how to treat a woman the best way possible.

In a relationship, I know that I should be able to change certain habits or ways of doing things that my partner finds unappealing and I expect the same from her. However, I should accept them for who they are, not try to bend them to a version of themselves that they hate. I always envision a good couple building each other up in terms of personalities and habits. Such things should be communicated more romantically and affectionately in a way that uplifts her, makes her feel appreciated and loved, and strengthens our bond rather than in a critical manner. 

What makes me happy? Simple things like breakfast together, sharing tea or coffee in our home, goofy jokes, sharing silly memes, checking in and supporting one another (something I need to get better at), new experiences, thoughtful surprised gifts, the outdoors during sunny days, the indoors during stormy days, hanging out with family and friends, trips to natural destinations, sharing a home-cooked dinner with friends and family, having a sense of purpose, making a positive impact on those around me, passionate love-making (not just sex), and treating others with respect and dignity. 

I love good food and enjoy cooking together with my woman with some background music. A movie night with popcorn, cuddled in a blanket - and being in that moment, not in my head, a competitive bowling session, and many such simple activities that build bonding and relaxation. I need to get out of my head more often, enjoy these present moments, and worry less about the future, and other things that I have no control over. 

I am learning to set and enforce boundaries when I need them to sort my thoughts and do so in a way that doesn‚Äôt leave my partner alienated or anxious about my commitment to her. I often felt like, setting boundaries was punishing my partner and cutting her off from myself. Like putting her in a cage and locking her away. Boundaries are very important for regaining one's composure and lead to clearer and better-thought-out communication. Because I saw boundaries as something bad, I was also terrible at respecting them because they felt like I was being exiled or cast away. 

I am financially stable with a good career. Beyond my job, I am working on other endeavors that I hope will someday generate income to supplement my salary and make me more financially free. I hope to keep building these, and hopefully, my efforts will pay off. I would love a partner who has hobbies and supports such endeavors, either by encouraging me or supporting me in other ways. Words of affirmation can go a long way.

The things I truly value are good moral principles, integrity (especially with money. I can't trust people whom I can't trust with money and I trust too easily), honesty, commitment (I demand more of this from myself too), and fairness ‚öñÔ∏è. I would like someone with similar values and principles. Many relationships today are centered around who makes more money, who has what, and couples actively planning how to get out of the relationship with the most shit. Who keeps the pet, owns the house, and has custody. These stories and accompanying vengeful behaviors make me feel hopeless sometimes, but there is hope. I want someone who doesn't care about things like this. Someone who's not planning an exit strategy, who is not overly materialistic and showy. Someone I can trust with my life's worth without fear of ending up on the streets or losing my kids. Someone who after the worst fight can still reconcile, laugh about it, and love each other even more. Not someone who holds grudges, is vindictive and always planning their revenge. Someone forgiving and who can apologize and ask for forgiveness. I'd forgive almost anything the first time if my partner explained themselves and asked for forgiveness. 

I hope she‚Äôs simply a good person who treats others with dignity, respect, and politeness, regardless of their social status or what they look like. I hate it when people look down on others. Someone who thanks the waiter for their service and helps the elderly or handicapped who are struggling or need help. Someone who tips the crippled by the road and makes friends with the stranger. Someone who sees the good in humanity and doesn't assume the worst of people.

The other quality I look for is someone who doesn‚Äôt buy into the idea of fairytale love like in Cinderella and the couples you see on social media. Those are not real. True love sometimes feels boring but still feels assured and safe. It is more calm and grounded in reality. It requires effort, initiative, and trust. Taking the initiative to do things that make us happy, have fun and bond more is something I have also failed at in the past. To organize date nights, and go out more for simple walks, to get rid of my phone and electronics during our time together, to find and play fun games, to be playful and goofy, not to take life too seriously, and not work so hard all the time, to go on road trips or weekends away, to lay my guards down, get out of my head and be present in all of this. I now know better from experience, my past failures, and therapy. 

True love fails sometimes and has flaws. It gets hard sometimes; picture a crying and sick baby, mental health issues, a sick partner, accidents, unforeseen disasters. Love goes through the storms without giving up. Sometimes, we fight and get at each others‚Äô throats and get nasty. Love is being able to beg for forgiveness and forgive and keep loving even more without holding grudges. It is supportive of each other, being there in the thick and the thin without giving up, it seeks solutions to problems not a way out. It is not distracted by external forces or influences, it praises and uplifts each other rather than criticizes. True love is holding hands and walking down the street together when we are old and gray - or bald in my case (I love seeing old couples together), dying together with a smile on our faces knowing that we gave it our all and overcame all the ups and downs.

In the end, I just want to fall in love. The old kind of love and live a simple, happy life away from all the chaos of cities, the madness of social media, and the confusion of modern society.

This will give my life the ultimate happiness, meaning, purpose, and fulfillment. It will be a life well lived and I‚Äôd die a happy man!!

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements and electrolytes.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

1hiq1dq,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/1hiq1dq/im_an_idiot_magnet_apparently/,I‚Äôm an idiot magnet apparently ,"I‚Äôm back with more stories of people claiming I work everywhere but the actual job that pays me. Btw I work at a fast food restaurant in an airport.

This first story happened earlier last month while I was clocking back in from break. Tell me why this lady walked pass all the store employees wearing a blue polo shirt standing around doing fuck all just to ask me - a fast food employee wearing a red polo shirt- if I have a certain shirt in a size extra small. The way I just turn on my heel and went on my merry way before I say something sassy. 

This happened again the week after, this time while I was clocking out. A guy with a thick accent asked me about heartburn OTC medicines. I assumed he‚Äôs asking if the store stocked any. Obviously idk because I don‚Äôt work there. By the grace of God an actual store employee showed up so I was able to easily pawn him off to her and leave. 

Then a couple of weeks ago I was on my way to clock out and this lady was trying to get my attention. I told her that an employee is there to answer her questions. Somehow she wasn‚Äôt listening or she doesn‚Äôt seem to comprehend what I was trying to tell her because she kept asking me if that‚Äôs all the chapstick in stock at the moment. I kept pointing at the employee sitting by the register watching the interaction go down and telling the lady to go ask the employee because that‚Äôs her job not mine. You‚Äôd think she got the hint. Nope. She became a mix of confused and mad and I was lowkey trying not to laugh at how stupid she was being. So she got louder. ‚ÄúIS THIS ALL THE CHAPSTICK YOU GOT?!?!‚Äù By then the store employee shot up from her seat and was like ‚ÄúOh yeah that‚Äôs all we got for right now.‚Äù And the look on that lady‚Äôs face was priceless when she finally realize that I don‚Äôt work there and I busted out laughing. But I can‚Äôt blame her because the store employee was hidden behind the self checkout so the lady didn‚Äôt see her.

And then this happened today. I swear it‚Äôs 3am and me and my coworker was on our way to the souvenir shop to clock in. Of all these people walking past this old couple why the fuck did they stop ME? Now I couldn‚Äôt hear what this lady was trying to ask me but I assume she‚Äôs trying to get me to do somebody else‚Äôs job. First of all I‚Äôm not even clocked in yet and second of all everyone knows a resting bitch face is universal for ‚Äúleave me tf alone‚Äù so I gave her a dirty look because wtf does she want? She asked me if I worked there to which I flat out told her no and kept it pushing. My coworker lost it and I ranted to him how people keep confusing my rbf for ‚Äúplease approach me I‚Äôm friendly.‚Äù And yes it‚Äôs loud and clear so she can hear. No idgaf what they think or say about me. And yes they gave me a stank look when we walked past them again. What‚Äôs funny was my badge was in clear view and they could‚Äôve obviously peeped that I was lying to them.


Side note: we don‚Äôt have a punch in/ out system in the restaurant so we have to clock in/ out at the souvenir shops. There‚Äôs 3 on air side and 1 on land side and it doesn‚Äôt matter which one we used long as we clock in and out. And if yall wondering how this doesn‚Äôt make sense just know the shops and the restaurant I work at as well as a coffee kiosk are under the same company that signs our paychecks.

It was going so well, then crashed and burned unbelievably. How do I even move on?","If you want to see where it gets terrible, skip to the first imgur link and the following texts.

I (20M) met this amazing girl (21F) at a college bonfire event in the fall. Immediately she expressed some interest in me, and we ended up chatting the rest of the night. I thought what the hell, and I got her phone number the next day. From there on, we texted daily and had some good conversations. I could tell even in the texts she was still pretty interested in me, and obviously I was super interested in her. She was beautiful, intelligent, clever, elegant, and cultured. I hadn't known what I wanted in a partner before, but she turned out to be exactly what I was looking for.

After texting for around 3 weeks, we set up our first date. We got coffee at a cafe near campus, then went and saw a symphony together afterwards. Obviously I was nervous, but it went really well. We had great conversations, enjoyed each other's company, and both express how much fun we had together over text when we got home. I gave her a hug at her car before we left.

Our second date was a week later, we went thrifting together, then walked around a park for a couple hours and got food afterwards. Again, we both had a great time and shared some good laughs and conversations. On our first date I bought her coffee and her symphony ticket, but this time she insisted on buying food for me, which I really appreciated.

  
The next week we met at the cafe from the first date and just studied together for a bit. We still talked about life and work, but she had class soon after so it didn't last too long. I was glad she made the effort to stop by anyways since she lives pretty far away. 

For our fourth date she suggested we get brunch. Afterwards we walked around a bookstore, a strip mall, and a grocery store. I didn't really have anything planned for us to do after so it kind of stalled out. I was kicking myself about that so I made sure to plan a bunch more activities after we parted ways. 

Our fifth date we did a christmas tour of a pretty mansion that she's always wanted to see. It was a lot of fun, I was feeling pretty comfortable with her by then with conversations and joking around, but I had always been nervous about physical touch and getting closer. As we left, I held her hand on the walk back to our cars. I know it's really slow to wait until the fifth date just to hold hands, but it's just what felt right. After that we got food together. It was still fun, but I thought she might have seemed a little distant and wistful at times. I gave her a hug before we left, but I had some concerns that I was moving to slow or too fast for her. I genuinely wasn't able to tell, and at this point we'd been talking for around 2 months, so I figured it was safe to be a little vulnerable with her and talk about it. I even ran this idea by another female friend and she agreed it was a good idea. Unfortunately, this is where things get really terrible. 

**\[where the ""fun"" starts\]**

I'm just gonna share the text for full transparency. 

[https://imgur.com/a/2CPlSxF](https://imgur.com/a/2CPlSxF)

Not my smoothest text but I was trying to be genuine. She didn't respond that night, which was fine because the day before at dinner she mentioned she was going to see a performance with some people that evening.

A little after sending that text, I got a follow request from a random guy on instagram. We had multiple mutuals, including the girl I was seeing, so I accepted. Later that night, right before I went to bed, I was tapping through instagram stories and saw his. It was a picture of his food and table at a nice restaurant, but sitting across from him was the girl I was seeing. The image was pointed down so her face was cropped out, but it was her. It was her outfit, her shoulder length hair, it was her necklace. 

I'm a pretty neurotypical, rational, solution oriented guy. With almost every problem in life I try to approach it optimistically and reasonably. This fucking destroyed me. 

I went to his account instantly. He only had two posts. His most recent one was around 15 pictures including a picture that looked like it was from her recent birthday party and another that might have been of her fucking dog. His only other post was from 2022, and there were lovey dovey comments on it from the girl I was talking to. I went to her instagram account and saw lovey comments from him up until around 2023. 

After this, I pretty much had a 24-hour anxiety attack. I did not sleep that night, I went to the gym as soon as it opened at 6:30am, and spent the entire next day trying and failing to distract myself. The terrible thing was, I had just sent her that vulnerable text, so the ball was in her court. My plan was to wait for her response, then call her and hopefully have a productive discussion about the situation. From the information I had, I determined that:

1) They had been dating probably until 2023

2) They went to the performance together

3) He followed me on instagram, so she must have told him about me

4) He felt the need to ""show her off"" to me on his story. I know I'm not the center of the universe, but the timing of it all made it feel directed at me. 

My genuine hope was that somehow, this was all a big misunderstanding, they were exes who were still friends and didn't have feelings for each other. Like I said, my plan was to call her after she responded and hopefully have an amicable discussion about the situation. Unfortunately, I never got the chance. 

She responded the night after I sent that text and saw that guys story.

[https://imgur.com/a/Vzv7Sm3](https://imgur.com/a/Vzv7Sm3)

The anxiety was gone; it was replaced with devastation. 

This just came as such a complete surprise to me. From my perspective, things had been going so well. She always seemed interested in me, and over the course of getting to know her, she changed from just a pretty girl to one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. She planned dates, she paid for dates, she wasn't using me, it really felt like she genuinely liked me. In the heat of the moment, I tried to get some kind of explanation. 

[https://imgur.com/a/rr0bdnW](https://imgur.com/a/rr0bdnW)

Now honestly, I can see how this is the case. As I said earlier, I was comfortable with having conversation with her and joking around, but I was still nervous about showing affection. I don't think I gave her many compliments on her appearance, even though I thought about so many of them in my head. But the last part of her message is so confusing? Obviously I was interested in her! and if her only problem was sharing words of affirmation, we could've just communicated that, it's such a simple fix. 

For full transparency, here are the rest of the texts. We haven't talked since.

[https://imgur.com/a/fKb3jRk](https://imgur.com/a/fKb3jRk)

I just feel hollow now. I'm so confused about what actually happened. I want her so badly still, she checked so many boxes for me. It felt like we were getting somewhere and then I blew it. I can't really make sense of it at all. I mainly think she wasn't romantically interested in me based off of her text, but I just don't know because she was so interested in me from the get go. 

I'm having a terrible time trying to accept things as they are and move on, even though I know that's what I should do. **Would it be wrong of me to go back and ask her about the situation, just to have some clarity?** The confusion of it all is allowing me hope that there's another chance for us. I'd rather just know for sure that there is no chance at all. It's just so difficult, she was so amazing and I haven't met anyone else like this before.

I wish I knew for sure:

1) If there was a chance for us to get back together

2) What she told her ex about me

3) What the actual reason for ending things was

4) If they are still involved

I unfollowed her on instagram, but I've been obsessed with checking her post count and follower count as well as checking her exes instagram, which is public. I know it's harmful but I can't resist.

**If anyone has advice for how to accept what has happened and move on, please share,** because I'm struggling mightily right now. I just wish it could've worked - it felt like it was working! It's so frustrating to feel like I ""fumbled"" the girl of my dreams. I know very well that she is her own person with her own motivations and desires, but it still feels like I failed.

**Bold below for TL/DR**

I'm a vegetable farmer by trade, but I'm considering getting into oyster production, and maybe some other species down the road. I don't have experience growing¬†*culinary*¬†mushrooms but I'm very familiar with indoor production from my earlier and wilder days, as well as being familiar with foraging/spore prints, etc.

Not only are oysters an obvious point of entry for a beginner, but I have many variables in my favor I cannot believe:

My life partner and I are constructing a local food grocery store (running an online farmers market that does 300k in revenue annually). Our current mushroom ally doesn't have an interest in expanding (or lacks time/space), so our grocery store will require (or create 'pull' in the marketplace for) shroomies.

Here's the kicker.. about a week ago I spit out my drink as I discovered the government grant program we're participating in (Farm to Food Pantry) will¬†**accept oyster shroomies @ 27/lb**. It's not a typo within their price list, I've made calls and I've emailed. The government neckties certainly didn't even side eye the price being well above their shiitake price... the program will last until June for sure, then could be renewed for another 2 years.¬†**Conservative estimate for this outlet is 15-20 lbs/wk to start**, and I could expand into neighboring region's agencies with larger population centers and eventually serve a 100 lb/wk market.

Now, revenue vs profit it totally different, this isn't forever, learning curve, contamination, yada yada. Yes, very great points! But I assure you all that I'm not drunk on misleading YouTube videos. Vegetable production is no get-rich-quick scheme.

**QUESTIONS:**

**Buckets v.s. bags @ 10-25 lb/wk as target. Thoughts on these approaches? bags on shelves, or hang them? Why? I have access to as many free food grade 5 gals as I want.**

**I'm planning on starting with lime pasteurizing, and growing into other infra once I'm cash flowing. Tips and tricks on doing this effectively?**

**I'm good with construction, and have set up grow rooms/indoor/outdoor irrigation. Build a 'martha'? Tents seem kinda pricey.**

**I've got channels set up for free coffee grounds, and hardwood sawdust. Straw shouldn't be too hard to find for a reasonable price. I'm considering beefing up my blend with cottonseed hull/meal, and running a couple different substrate mixes to try and optimize net efficiency. Any thoughts or experience sharing would be great!**

I'm just trying not to fuck this up and have a hard go about it. The unique opportunity could give one a big fat ego rush, but I'll be happy with the pricing thing subsidizing small scale start-up by 25%

Any help is greatly appreciated, and would warrant a big fat digital smooch!

I tried to learn Swedish from government school but then I couldn't work to focus on the language . Now im lost , confused  don't know what to do I want to study maybe people can take me seriously . Also I'm talented at drawing and now I lost spark on that too. I need help but I don't know what I need to fix first ...

P.S Sorry for my writing I'm a little overwhelmed and English isn't my first language probably some mistakes on my writing ! ",3,1734718430.0,Adulting,1,0.8,False
