1jbj37f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jbj37f/im_falling_for_a_close_friend_but_its_complicated/,I'm falling for a close friend but it's complicated. (Warning: The story is very long),"I am 20 and female. I have this other female friend, we've been friends for 4-5 months by now and we've been close. She is a tall masculine girl. We stay at the same dorm, different rooms. From now on I'll refer to her as A. We met at a gathering with mutual friends. After some time we started to hangout too but mostly with the rest of the friend group. When A and I spend time alone together she opens up to me a bit about her life and she always says she only shares this with me so I cannot tell someone else. I, of course, hold onto my promise. At first she was just a regular friend. And I was sure that I was straight. I've only dated with men and never been attracted to any girls at all. After some time, I was bothered because she doesn't text or call, neither she responds to me. So I distanced myself from her because I didn't want to have another thing in my life to stress me. But of course as we're in the same friend group we came across each other in another meeting. But i totally ghosted her. I also talked with her about this before but she didn't fix her attitude so I just thought about cutting her off. That day she tried to greet me with a hug but i gently pushed her away and continued talking with another friend. When A wanted to initiate a conversation with me I'd just not respond at all. Soma time later I went to the restroom and when I was back A was gone. And after that whenever we were in the same place A would ghost me too. Eventually a common friend explained A why I was upset with her but she just claimed she is the same with everyone. There was one time we were again all together and the same common friend turned to A and said her and I should talk but she just dismissed it my saying ""there's nothing to talk about"". Then I got pissed a bit and some other things happen that day (the other things aren't about A) so I just left not to stress myself more and met with some other friends. That weekend I went to my siblings' house as it's close to the city in which i study uni. I do that often, I come on Friday and go back to the dorm on Sunday. That week on Friday night, A suddenly called me. I wasn't expecting for obvious reasons but i still picked it up. She asked if i was at my siblings' and i said yes. Then she said if I can return on Saturday. I said my cousin came from abroad and I'll be with him on Saturday but she insisted a lot and said I can meet with my cousin and return back at night. I hasitated but eventually agreed. Her, I and some other close friends stayed at a friend's house. She lives alone so we sometimes stay over all together have some fun, play games and stuff. I went there and we had some good time, me and A were mostly fine but i reminded her that I'm still upset with her. And she said we'll talk about it when we're alone and we shouldn't ruin the group's mood and i agreed. Next day we went to the mall all together and then went to our own ways. I met some other friends afterwards then returned back to the dorm. At midnight A called and said she'll be in the garden and maybe we should talk so I went. I explained I felt upset as she didn't call or text and when I did she didn't even respond at all but I saw her together with our other friends all the time I also mentioned I felt left out just because of her behavior. She explained she's like this to everyone and she's extremely forgetful and about the rest of our friends she said all of them goes to the same place most of the time so they always see each other but that coffee shop isn't a place where I go often so I'm not there. Then I just said she could have at least sent me a text mentioning where they are so I could come. The conversation was long so I won't say everything but we eventually agreed we shouldn't be distant and we're back to being friends. She also confessed the day she left when I want to the restroom was because I was ghosting her and I said there were other people there and she could have talked with them and she said she didn't want to talk with them knowing i was upset with her but i wasn't responding to anything she said so she chose to leave. After that she started to initiate more conversations (she's still forgetful tho). Yet she was better, she'd text in the morning to grab some sandwiches together and we started to hangout more often then we used to. There are some stuff that made me question our friendship. For example some little time after we met, one day we were at the library and I suddenly saw my ex. I mentioned it and when  she was alone with me she started to question about the topic. She wanted me to explain how we met, how was our relationship, how we broke up etc. and I explained. She also asked if I was over him or not and I told I was and it was never a big heartbreak for me. Another example, she always holds me a few seconds long when we hug. These are small things. Recently some other things happened. We were again staying at the mentioned friend's place. There's s guy in the friend group and he let me try make-up on him that night. I intentionally made a very bad lip combo so it'll be fun then he kissed A's cheek just to leave a stain and piss her off. After that i kissed her other cheek so i can leave a stain too. She wasn't pissed so i kissed her cheek again. Then i grabbed a lipstick and said I'll stain all her face and she just agreed so I put the lipstick on and kissed her face randomly then put it on again and continued... I was being careful not to cross any boundaries, not to kiss her lips to be exact. Then she suddenly pointed the corner of her lips. I was surprised and asked her if she's sure. When she nodded I kissed the spot. I felt butterflies on my stomach. I even forgot the rest of the friend group was around us for a moment. Then I just told her to go and clean her face because I started to lose my senses being that close to her. But the same night her and a lesbian girl from the group made a lot of jokes about ""them being a thing"". And I was very very pissed but didn't say anything because normally I'm fine with such jokes, i even make them myself so if i reacted badly suddenly, it would be suspicious. So i kept my mouth shut. The next day  when me, A and the lesbian friend were alone they mentioned it was a joke and A was actually mocking and mimicking the lesbian friend's ex but none of us got it as we weren't told about the ex. I was confused why they didn't just tell this to the rest of the group but only me, I felt like they wanted specifically me to know it was really joking. Also the same night i went upstairs to sleep but I didn't really sleep, A also came upstairs some time later and lay on the sofa opposite of the bed. I mentioned she can lay on the bed if she's not comfortable there and she said she's fine. So I just went back watching videos on my phone but she started to initiate a conversation. I told her to shut up and let me enjoy my phone, I was laughing saying this and she knew ı wasn't trying to be mean. She said we can watch together and came and lay down beside me. We watched some tiktoks and reels on her phone for a while then we started to talk about random stuff, during all these I was playing with her hair or touching her face and she looked pleased with it. During the conversation I told her that I have a thing for ""hands"". It's not a very big thing or fetish, I just like big and veiny hands. And from then on, she started to show me her hands and smirked doing so. I joked and said if she wanted me to fantasize about her hands and she said she can use her hands well and we just laughed it off. At some point she ended up on the sofa, I was still laying on bed and she suddenly said my body looks curvy and hot in the position I was laying. Also she suddenly brought up another friend of mine. The mentioned friend is a masc lesbian and since A met her two weeks ago, she hates her. She always talks how she didn't like my friend. (The day they met was on one of the days I was ghosting A and we all were in a crowded friend group when we came across my friend and some other people knew her too so we sat all together and I sat beside my friend). That night as A talked about my friend she just compared my friend with herself and always mentioned how she is better than the other friend. Also the day they met, because of an incident my friend made me a joke about me being pregnant with her baby and I laughed and played along. That night A mentioned how ridiculous that joke was. I laughed and said that's why it's called a joke. We went back and fourth and she said I'm defending my friend too much. And I explained her that while I understood she didn't have to like everyone or all of my friends, she kept on mentioning her dislike towards my friend a lot and I don't think that is normal. Then I asked her if she was jealous and she said she was just protective. Then I asked if it's because she thinks my friend was trying to hit on me. She suddenly got angry and said my friend just flirts with everyone and I shouldn't trust her. I explained I don't care who my friend flirts and I'm sure she wasn't trying to flirt with me, it was just a meaningless joke. Then we started to talk about deep stuff and the topic came to love stuff. She said ""i love you"" BUT the thing about her is you can never tell if she's joking or serious. And I couldn't ask if she really meant that then the topic suddenly changed. After that we acted normal so I assume it was just a joke. Another thing about her is she is kinda a flirtatious person but she doesn't share her deep feelings and deep things about her life with anyone but me. But she never claimed I was her best friend, she always says another girl from the friend group is her best friend. I'm not jealous or something, I have another best friend too and the other girl has a bf. Also A once mentioned she goes to the cinema sometimes but she only does it alone, that it's just her ""me time"". Then I mentioned I also like having ""me time"" and going cinema alone and she immediately said we can go together when we're both available. There are some more incidents like this but this post is already too long so I should come to an end. So, eventually I realised I like her. But I cannot confess. Last month her other 3 friends confessed to her, with one of whom she was very very close with, and she cut all of them off and now she isn't even saying hi to them. She said the hates this kind of stuff when a person she calls her friend just confesses and ruins their friendship. I don't want to lose her by confessing. But I can't also just stop this feelings and the things she is doing aren't helping me to lose my interest in her. I've also never liked a girl before so it's not only about liking someone for me, I'm also having a very big personal changing point in my life. I realized something big about myself. I always lived as a straight person and now suddenly all of that changed. It's so sudden and unexpected so it kinda scares me. I'm open to any advice, thoughts or questions.

1jbj2ph,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1jbj2ph/from_anger_to_disappointment_yet_another/,From Anger to Disappointment: Yet Another Veilguard Post-Mortem,"I never intended to play this game. After watching a couple of streams, I knew right away it wouldn't work for me, and the more information I gathered over the passing months, the stronger I felt in my stance. I like unconventional stories, weird angles, and sharp edges, and Veilguard was so clearly the antithesis of everything I enjoy in a work. Best to give it a miss.

Then it dropped for free on PS Plus. How sad that, after obtaining the platinum over 50 hours, I can distill Veilguard’s design philosophy down to three words: *superficial, generic, and lame*.

 

Enough has been said about the lack of reactivity, the avoidance of any and all problematic or difficult narrative elements, and the stepping away from basically everything that people enjoy *Dragon Age* for. I personally don't care about the hair physics, enemy design, facial animations or voice acting. With all grace given to its troubled development cycle, we can only judge the final product, and the final product is a string of generic, uncreative, token-effort moments plastered over a shallow combat system and a generally uninteresting world.

 With all that in mind, I did what I always do when I’m experiencing a terrible story: I start thinking of how I would make it better. For me, at least in this post, that means addressing character dynamics and relevance.

 

**CHARACTERS**

(Disclaimer: I know Neve and Lucanis are characters introduced in the comics. When I speak of them, I mean their character slot in relation to what the main plot needs them to do rather than their literal character.)

 

*Neve:* I like Neve, but she greatly suffers from the disconnect between authorial intention and audience impression. She’s grounded, reserved, emotionally stable… and to the players, that comes across as someone boring and almost entirely unreactive to the world around them. She plays coy so long in her romance that by the time we get to her fear of getting attached, it's too little, too late.

It’s not necessarily *wrong* that she’s a private eye, but something about this detective noir thing feels like the writer trying to shoehorn a different genre in where it doesn’t fit just because they think it's cool. She exists to act as an informant to The Team, and in that capacity, she fulfils her role.

You know what faction would have been better for her? The Crows. Have her work as a Crow-affiliated spymaster with her fingers in every pie, feared in the shadows but heroic in her actions, contrasting against her dogged committal to always get the job done. Have her be the Batman rather than neutering the assassins.

 

*Bellara:* She makes a terrible first impression which absolutely should have been rewritten, but turn down Bellara's ‘adorkable’ bit by 20% and remove every instance of “X, I mean” from her dialogue, and she's fine. When dealing with her grief over her brother or her work, she’s pretty compelling, and she fulfils her role as dispenser of ancient elven lore vs Neve's word-on-the-street knowledge. (More on that later.)

 

*Harding:* Same deal. Turn down the “socially anxious people pleaser” thing by like, 70%, and allow her to be the competent veteran we’ve met before. Her role is trickier: interesting as the Titans are, as far as I can recall,  their presence adds almost zero relevance to the actual events of the story. You could cut her entirely, deliver the lore revelations through uncovered texts, and lose nothing.

My solution to this links to one of the world changes that irks me the most: the Eluvians. It’s so goddamn lame that they’re just fast travel points that let us hop in and out of the Crossroads like it’s nothing. If we actually needed to traverse around Northern Thedas, then Scout Harding suddenly has a vital, low-level role of getting us through and keeping The Team alive.

 

*Lucanis:* This guy is a mess. We recruit him because “we need a mage-killer”. He then proceeds to have no particular mage-killing skills, have no feelings about mages at all, is possessed by a demon which has almost zero influence over him, and also ends up coming off emotionally disinterested in anything beyond his coffee cup.

I’d be fine with him as a side character during the Crow storyline. It’d improve his potential romance with Neve too, if she was a Crow informant. But you know which faction wasn’t represented, whose job is literally handling and killing mages? The goddamn Chantry Templars.

Have his character slot be a Templar. Have him *actually* specialize in killing mages. Have the party mages genuinely worry about his presence. Have The Elven Gods Elgar’nan and Ghilan’nain actually be mages in any way that's relevant. As it is, he’s just a boring dude who jumps at a god with a dagger a couple times. Anybody could do that.

 

*Davrin:* This guy is… okay. The Wardens are a highly relevant faction, who have great influence on the plot, and his presence is required as our route into their faction. His side plot about seeking purpose in life is basic, but interesting.

Initially, I thought it was needless overlap to have two Dalish elves. Now I think that could lead to something more interesting. Since Davrin abandoned his clan and Bellara is still with hers, have them clash. The issue of The Elven Gods Elgar’nan and Ghilan’nain has never been more prevalent, and if any two should be discussing this issue, it’s them! As it is, Bellara says no more than “OMG this is crazy!” and Davrin doesn’t particularly care at all, when it would be so much more interesting for them to be diametrically opposed on the direction of their shared culture.

Also, I am begging you on my and everyone else’s knees, shut up about your fucking bird-dog for a SECOND. The way I started skipping lines the second we started talking about Assan AGAIN... owning a pet is not a goddamn personality trait.

 

*Emmrich:* I’m sorry, guys. I like the grandpa too, but we can cut him and the Mourn Watch entirely. They serve zero purpose narratively, and like Neve, it feels like the writer trying to shoehorn a different genre into the story because they think ghosts and necromancers are cool.

Transfer his ‘Fade knowledge’ (is it ever more than passingly acknowledged?) to Bellara. Make him a consultant out of Minrathous that Neve works with or something. Dude doesn’t need to be there and I don’t care about his skeleton mascot.

 

*Taash:* Cut Taash and the Lords of Fortune entirely. The massive revisionism of the Qun aside, they serve no purpose as a faction or as a character. We recruit them because “we need a dragon hunter”, but this amounts to blowing a horn one time in the main story. Ambient dialogue exists between Davrin and Taash where they clarify that Davrin hunts monsters and Taash hunts dragons, so just transfer that quality over to Davrin.

Enough has been said about their weaknesses as a character. Suffice to say that you can really tell that their writer was the lead writer, and I suspect nobody felt safe to criticize their work without serious blowback, because I cannot understand why such a disinterested, unintelligent, monosyllabic character should be included in the cast.

 

 **STORY**

The story itself is honestly okay as far as the actual beats go. Solas’ attempts to rip open the veil and fix his mistakes release The Elven Gods Elgar’nan and Ghilan’nain. We gather allies to oppose this threat, and are betrayed again before ultimately doing so. Origins could be distilled down to a similar structure and that thing is great.

People tend to dismiss criticism of this story with “Well, it matches the lore and follows the planned story, so I don’t know what you’re complaining about.” 

It's not about the facts. The issue, on every level, is execution. These beats are executed in the most superficial way, laden with the most generic platitudes, and in ways that made me constantly say “That’s it? God, that’s so lame…” that I could hardly believe it.

Every faction of villains are Bad Guys Who Want Power with no further examination. All the people on our side are indisputably good heroes who immediately pledge themselves to a Literal Who with no further questions, which is good, because we have no answers. Over and over we edge close to interesting ideas, only for the game to sharply veer away in favor of something safe and boring.

What form does this unspecified Power take? Why do the villains want it? What will they do with it? Why are they working together to get it? Don’t worry about it, they’re Bad Guys Who Want Power. They Hurt People. We don’t like it when they Hurt People, so we Save People.

There's a similar lack of examination in our own camp. The Team are somehow the only people for the job, yet when anyone asks for details on what comes next, we hit them with a “We work it out.” Or a “Whatever it takes.” Generic platitudes from top to bottom, and it’s *so* goddamn lazy.

  
**OVERALL IMPRESSIONS**

In the end, anger gave way to disinterest and disappointment. I could have gotten a mediocre action game with black-and-white Good Guys vs Bad Guys anywhere. Instead, with all their storied history and all the potential at their feet, we got... this.

I’ll leave you with the most glaring line that sticks in my memory, serving as a prime example of how little the writers seemed to care about anything beyond what seemed cool, and how greatly the head writers and directors failed to maintain consistency within the work. Davrin says it just before we head into Weisshaupt, and it shocked me so completely that I actually screamed “What?!” and walked away from the game.

I would fly down the next day anytime we had an argument, 
When we first started dating I would take every lunch break to get her from work to take it together and would drive her to work every morning with her favorite coffee and get her flowers when I picked her up, 
I could go on for days about how much stuff I did for her

In the last month 
She wanted to breakup to “work on herself” 
And I was reminded by my friends how her online bumble bff profile said single so I started to suspect she was cheating, 
I bought a car tracker and put it on her car, 
And found out she was cheating on me with some guy and they had gone out of town to celebrate his birthday,

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

I’ve had some struggles with being restrictive and to be honest, now I just feel confused about nutrition ,
I know what I’m going to ask might seem silly but please understand I just feel so lost at this point 
The past 2 days I’ve gotten a special coffee- type drink, and I’m most likely going to get some kind of sweet drink tomorrow too. They aren’t overly sugary drinks, but I know they have some sugar and calories. When I got them, I had no added sugar for the rest of the day , but I still feel so guilty for even having them, and I feel like I’m being so unhealthy , but other than that I keep a really healthy diet with a lot of protein,fruit and veg. 
So I guess what I’m asking is, is it ok to have sweet drinks several days in a row? It’s not a regular occurrence for me, it just so happened that I was going to get a “special treat” drink like four times in a row. * over four days not in one day) I feel so guilty.

I don’t know if this helps but I have about an 18.3 BMI, and I excercise 4 times a week in the gym, when I’m not in the gym I exercise through walking or hiking. I had a phase a few years ago where I was really unhealthy and was a bit chubby, not obese,but definitely chubby, and I’m scared to fall into that again.

Funding **school meals for all kids** isn’t just about feeding them—it’s about **better education, health, and economic benefits** that outweigh the costs.

# Why It’s a No-Brainer:

1️⃣ **Better Academic Performance** – Hungry kids struggle to focus, leading to **worse test scores and lower graduation rates.** Well-fed kids **learn more, behave better, and stay in school.**

2️⃣ **Healthier Kids, Lower Healthcare Costs** – Poor nutrition leads to **obesity, diabetes, and long-term health problems** that **cost taxpayers billions** in Medicaid and emergency care. School meals **reduce doctor visits** and build lifelong healthy eating habits.

3️⃣ **Stronger Economy & Workforce** – Kids who eat well **earn more as adults, rely less on welfare, and contribute more in taxes.** Schools buying food locally also **boosts farming and food industries.**

4️⃣ **Ends Stigma & Lunch Debt** – No more kids **getting shamed, skipping meals, or racking up debt** because their parents are a few bucks short. **Free meals for all = no class divide.**

5️⃣ **Relieves Families’ Financial Burden** – Parents save **$1,000 per kid per year**, easing financial stress for **working families who don’t qualify for aid but still struggle.**

# How to Pay for It (Without Anyone Noticing)

* **Close Corporate Tax Loopholes** – Big businesses dodge **hundreds of billions** in taxes annually. A **tiny fraction** of that would cover school meals.
* **Trim Wasteful Government Contracts** – The Pentagon spends **$1,280 per coffee cup** and **$10,000 on a toilet seat.** Redirecting a fraction of that nonsense could fund lunches indefinitely.
* **Tax Junk Food Giants** – A **0.5% tax on soda, chips, and fast food profits** (not consumers) would cover **most of the cost** while discouraging unhealthy eating.

# The Bottom Line:

For **every $1 invested**, we save **$7 in long-term healthcare, crime prevention, and economic growth.** Feeding kids **isn’t a cost—it’s an investment.**

But I find it so hard now. We live in such a toxic and competitive world that everyone always feels like they have to one up you or that it's a contest for whose life is worse off. 
I had a few people I was close to in my mid 20s. And that's when I became a mother for the first time. I was dealing with PPD and rage, I had limited support from family at the time, and as a new mom it was a wild time for me mentally. I lost the only friendships I had, and looking back i was a bad friend and I know that but i also know they werent exactly perfect either. I've accepted that my behavior back then was poor choices etc.

 I recently and finally after almost 8 years started getting help for my depression and anxiety. I also was diagnosed with ADHD, and it has really opened my eyes for how I talk to others and the way I speak and my mannerisms. I never knew how bad it actually was and how much it's severely Impacted the way I see and talk to others. But now that I'm finally getting help and able to see things in a better light etc I'm finding it so hard to make genuine connections with women my age who are moms or who aren't moms etc.

 So I'm here that maybe in the hopes I could make a connection to have a gal pal to talk to, vent to, someone who can be my friend. I know it's sad someone reaching out like this but honestly it's very daunting for me.

Things about me/ things i enjoy:

I love star wars, I love to play video games (im a pc girl), I have two kids, I'm a military spouse, I work full time nights as a customer service rep. I enjoy coffee and shopping and I love witchy stuff. I also enjoy having house plants even if I don't have the best green thumb in the world. I have 2 dogs, I'm passionate about my family. I'm very much an introverted person but I crave having a genuine connection with someone other than my spouse. 

If this seems too far fetched it's okay, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask. I hope to meet some new people and maybe make some connections💙",2,1741998386.0,AskWomenOver30,0,1.0,False

Does anyone know if you can get large bottles (or perhaps even a bag or box) with either french vanilla or mocha that tastes similar anywhere? I would love it!

Alternatively, a good recipe, preferably for the mocha, is also welcome. Most I've tried aren't quite the same and are usually a lot more bitter, but that might be my fault. Hot I drink my coffee black and that's all I've been used to, but I am such as sucker for these oversweet lattes!

1jbioep,https://www.reddit.com/r/namenerds/comments/1jbioep/i_renamed_my_daughter/,I renamed my daughter!,"Let’s preface this by saying that this will be long and mushy. I took this very, very seriously and would love to share the experience. Feel free to skip to the bottom for the name reveal (sharing with her full blessing!) 

First of all, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for the outpouring of support. The love far outweighed the hate, and we were absolutely awestruck by the support. I still have quite a few private messages to get through, but please know that I will read each and every one of them and do my best to respond! 

I got quite a few comments asking why I would post to Reddit when my daughter asked ME to name her. The answer is that I’m simply not a very creative person, and trying to come up with a name from scratch is so, so hard! I haven’t named a baby in 16 years and we have an enormous family - ie, difficult to think of names that we love AND aren’t taken. I came here for inspiration and received more than I could’ve ever wished for! 

Going about choosing was incredibly difficult, but I eventually got my list down to a top 3. They needed to past a few tests. 1. Does the name suit her? 2. Would 2006 me have chosen this name? 3. Does it sound out of whack with her brothers’ names? And most importantly… does she love it? 

I brought the top 3 to her and she said “Mom, this is defeating the purpose. I don’t want to choose!” So, I had another idea. We would have 3 little coffee/lunch dates around the city and use a different name to order with, so she could feel each name out and see if any of them were definitive no’s. That ruled out Talia - gorgeous name, but didn’t feel quite right to her. Aviva was also a top contender that didn’t make the cut.

I mulled over the final two for what seems like years… but I chose, and she expressed that it was secretly her favorite too! It felt like divine intervention to be in this situation, considering this name, with Purim so close. 

I am the incredibly proud mama of Esther Miriam! I absolutely love it, and so does she. “Essie May” evolved as a nickname from her father overnight, and it made me fall in love even more. May was the nickname of her namesake and she happens to be a May baby. Esther also has immense meaning to us as Jews, and I can absolutely say that 2006 me would’ve chosen it. The runner-up was Naomi. 

I could not have done it without this forum. Thank you all so very much for sharing this with me. ❤️",121,1741998180.0,namenerds,13,0.96,False

I made it to March 13 and Mom moved yesterday. The last few days were chaotic as we had packed and moved her clothes and linens etc. early. Of course she did not recall this and started packing everything left in shopping or trash bags. So we had to let her do her thing and then hide the items when she was distracted.

furniture moving day arrived and we were able to take mostly only the items we planned and that she would be comforted by. I had to keep saying .. let’s try it out and we can always come back and pick up a few more things. 

we got there and she did it! She was a bit riled by the lanyard with a call button in case she needs help and the idea that someone would bring her medication to her. But this passed as there was so much else to focus on. She spent a lot of time arranging 6 glasses and plates/ bowls/ coffee mugs in the cabinets and her bookshelf of family pictures. We ate lunch and she, my daughter and I were totally exhausted. So we declared victory and left around 3. I am so proud of her. Today she called at 8 am about her remote control… but she was bright ,calm and coherent. the easy remote arrived today… a week late … so that’s a tomorrow fix. Plus I will  bring her dog to visit as the poor dog is wondering where she is.  

She lost her door fob and was advised they “could not make a new one until Monday”. I was giggling as I wondered if it will take more or less than 5 min to find it tomorrow. Before she even called, the moving coordinator texted me with a heads up which was great. 

Mom’s cousin called her and reported back to me she had lunch with a new friend, gave her a video tour of her new apartment and was in good spirits … I write this because after almost two years of stress , rescuing her business from ruin, working through two years of back taxes, selling a vacation home she never used and was neglecting, dealing with her anger at being less capable and her alcoholism due to depression and social isolation ( she quit when I gave her the choice between her booze or the car)… she is safe and at least for today, she was engaged with the world. 

After a horrible week at the beginning of March when I totally lost it in front of her from the stress of her anger and resistance…. we got here. I don’t know how, but we did. And every cell in my body is sore and tired.  The release of tension is a shock to the system. I am so relieved.

1jbigtw,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jbigtw/beginner_espresso_machine_ninja_luxe_cafe_or/,Beginner Espresso Machine: Ninja Luxe Cafe or Breville? [no budget],"Hi everyone, I'm looking to get an espresso machine and am torn over all the options. I was looking at the Ninja Luxe Cafe and different Breville machines. I know that there are probably a lot of serious espresso/coffee heads in this subreddit who will hate on the Ninja, but what I am looking for is not the ""best"" espresso machine/quality that I can buy necessarily, I just want one that is best suited to me and my needs.

For context, I'm really not that serious about coffee/espresso I just like drinking it. I worked at Starbucks for a year while I was in college, which is actually how I started drinking coffee and I guess that taught me the very fundamental basics of coffee. I'm not really that picky, I love trying local coffee spots and cafes but really I just go to Starbucks and Capital One Cafe the most and it tastes delicious to me. I'm trying to not spend $7 on an iced latte every time I want coffee so recently I have been just buying store bought bottled cold brew and drinking that at home.

What I like about the Ninja machine is that it is all-in-one. I like that there are options for espresso, cold brew, and drip coffee and the milk steamer can also create cold foam etc. I also like that its catered to be beginner friendly and a lot of the processes are automated to make it easier to use while still maintaining a level of manual functions for people who dont necessarily know/care a lot about espresso and its art.

My concerns with the Ninja are some people speculating about its poor build quality and that it will not last, as well as some people saying that it really doesnt taste good. Will someone with an average/untrained taste palette for coffee/espresso really be able to taste the difference between it and a higher quality machine?

That being said I'm also open to suggestions. I've been eyeing breville machines for the longest time so if anyone has an suggestions on those as well please let me know. I know a lot of people will say to buy the grinder separately etc but is that really necessary for someone like me who who just wants a little vanilla iced latte a few times a week in the morning? I want something easy and convenient and as long as the espresso doesnt leave an awful sour taste in my mouth i think I'll be pretty happy.",1,1741997576.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1jbigh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeginnerWoodWorking/comments/1jbigh6/table_saw_fence_question/,Table saw fence question,"Hi,

I inherited my dad’s table saw and have recently decided to put it to some use woodworking.  After a couple of projects, I dropped the stock fence and broke the handle/lever.  I didn’t love the fence anyway, so I picked up a fox shop aluma-classic.

I’ve just got it clamped on with one bolt on each side to see if it would even fit/work Before I go drilling holes in the cast iron for the holes that don’t line up.

Is it a bad thing if there’s just barely 3/32” space under the new fence when using the existing holes?  The manual doesn’t specify, it just says adjust the bolt that rides on the back rail so that the fence moves freely.  I could drill all new holes 1/16” lower on the saw top, but don’t really want to if it’s not necessary.

Pic if it helps and another of the coffee table I finished today out of some pine I had laying around.

Thanks for any advice.

I’m only on day 2; I injected my first 0.25 mg yesterday.  I stopped to get a coffee and was craving something sweet, which I kinda took to be a failure in itself. I ordered a chocolate treat, I kinda couldn’t help myself, and I also was curious about testing myself. 

I sat in the car and had 2 bites. Then wrapped up the rest and put it away. I just…didn’t feel like eating more. 😱
This is a completely foreign feeling. I don’t think I’ve ever not wanted to finish something sweet in my life. Normally, I’d be fishing every last crumb out of the bag.

1jbi884,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1jbi884/i_kind_of_want_to_start_socially_smoking/,I kind of want to start socially smoking..,"I’m literally in my mid 20s and I’ve never ever even taken a single puff off a cigarette and feel embarrassed and left out because it seems almost everyone else has at some point. Even if many don’t actually get addicted, they still enjoy the occasional cigarette socially. Even people I never imagined would ever go near a cigarette because on the outside they seem so.. health conscious. Is it.. bad that I want to be able to experience that? Just to be able to say “yeah I know what it’s like to have a smoke with good friends.” I kind of want to know what that nicotine buzz is like. I’m actually tired of being one of the weird ones that cares too much about my health and longevity. Most smokers, especially young smokers, say the same thing: “I don’t care if I die.” “I don’t care if it shortens my life by a few years or decades.” “I don’t plan on living long anyway.” And honestly I kind of want to experience that mindset, and it’s honestly because I can’t comprehend how anyone could so nonchalantly just accept the possibly of dying younger, and in a much horrible way to say the least. I could never comprehend that, unless of course it’s someone with such severe trauma, depression or something else that truly makes life feel hopeless for them, and that I can understand. I struggle on and off with depression so I kind of get it at times. But people who are, for the most part, mentally stable and healthy, still have the mindset of just simply not caring. Not caring if they only live to their 40s or 50s or something. Honestly, it’s bad but like.. I am kind of starting to believe that more people actually think like that than don’t. So, as crazy as it sounds, I kind of want to start smoking to cope with how it’s even possible to feel that way about the one chance we all have in life. I’m tired of being judgmental towards seemingly mentally stable people who just simply don’t care about living very long, so as weird as it is, I feel like I should just start smoking myself to maybe see where they might be coming from. I honestly don’t know if anyone who says these things ACTUALLY feels that way deep down, if they just say they don’t care but really they do care and maybe they just want to seem.. edgy and deep? Because how can you not be scared of an early death, and horrific one at that? I mean, yeah, we all die one day. I could even get hit by a car tomorrow but that doesn’t mean I’m just gonna go walk into traffic because “we all die one day so why does it matter.” If anything I’m gonna try my best to avoid getting hit by a car. So as a weird way to cope with these feelings and being kind of judgmental towards smokers, mostly young smokers who just seem to want to throw their lives and health away, I feel like I should just start smoking too, because hey why not? Maybe these people are right, maybe I shouldn’t really care that much about my own health and lifespan. Maybe I should just have that “yolo” mindset and just do it. I care about my health, but at the same time I feel like I just.. shouldn’t. Because so many others seemingly don’t care, like they truly don’t care, and I feel like I’m one of the fewer ones in society that does. Maybe I am missing out on one of the greatest experiences. Maybe I am missing out on the feelings of smoking cigarettes with good friends. Maybe I am missing out on the feelings of smoking after a meal, with coffee, etc. Maybe I really don’t need to care about living as long. Maybe it really is just weird to care so much. I NEED to experience smoking socially at least a few times in my life. Because really, why should I care? I’ll just die one day anyway. I kind of want to understand that way of thinking, I kind of want to understand that nihilistic mindset. I want to quit feeling so upset with anyone who feels that way about their own life, so oddly enough I want to start smoking myself to cope with these feelings. I don’t know if this is some weird OCD obsession that I have, I do have very, very strong OCD tendencies and ways of thinking even though I haven’t been diagnosed. It’s bad, but damn I feel like maybe I am missing out just simply being young and carefree. I’ve never really had much of a life anyway, I’ve struggled with social anxiety and introverted tendencies (not that it’s a bad thing) but I can’t keep living like such a hermit anymore. My life is passing me by, before I know it I’ll be 30 in a few years and won’t have any real memories of my youth to look back on, and I need to get out there and just live.",2,1741996889.0,Vent,5,1.0,False

However, this drug definitely is a double edged sword. Usually when I wake up in the morning I still have pesky sleep inertia plaguing me and makes it a bit difficult to focus and get out of bed. 

Before xywav, I use to just take a small dose of sunosi and coffee and it would give me a burst of alertness and I’d be ready to start my day. However, since xywav, it seems that when I take a small dose of sunosi or even just a small cup of coffee, I feel like my senses are completely overloaded. I’m not sure how else to describe this so I’ll do my best. 

I feel shaky, find it difficult to concentrate, I get chills, body sensations overall feel odd, and even standing makes me feel like I’m getting dizzy and should sit down before I keel over. Idk what to do because if I take sunosi or coffee I feel more awake obviously, but I feel this sensory overload and it can be just as annoying to deal with as the sleep inertia.

I have never suffered from either and have no idea how either feel. 
If anything I write here offends anyone I apologies in advance as I really don't have a clue how to approach this. 
Since we have been together she has had ""anxiety"" I have always just thought of it as an excuse as sorts to not have to do anything that she doesn't want to do. She has always had public facing jobs, whether it's working in a shop, as a day carer for disabled people or even working in a school. She has never complained or been stressed or ""anxious"" about going to work, being in work or even being in situations that are very upsetting. These ""anxiety"" flare ups only seem to happen when she is asked if she can do something that inconveniences her such as going to the shop to pick up dinner if I'm running late at work. Or if she has to go for a meeting with one of the kids teachers. I have to take time off my work and go to it even if she isn't working that day. It seems like the only time her anxiety isn't flaring up is when she either has work or is going for lunch or for coffee or dinner or drinks with me or a friend or family member. I have suggested multiple times over the years to get professional help, someone who can actually help deal with it but she just refuses. I feel like it's really putting a strain on our marriage now. I'm constantly walking on egg shells around her so she doesn't freak out at me. What can I do? ",0,1741996775.0,Anxiety,1,0.5,False

Prior to that I think I had an ESAM 3300 for a bit and some kind of Breville espresso machine (looked like a tank) and a fancy grinder. I pulled ok shots with that, but got the super auto for the convenience/consistency. Hadn't done much to dial in the flavor on the Delonghi until reading about it on this sub, but have recently been doing that. I make 3 double shots per day and add an equivalent amount of whole milk...just measure it out in the same shot glasses used for the espresso shots. I've used a manual milk frother at times, but havent bothered with that recently, though I'm kind of interested in trying some of the milk frothing options on newer machines. I usually get an iced latte on the rare occasions I get coffee when out. I switched to decaf a couple of years ago and the shots haven't been quite as good, but mostly passable (and getting better with my new dialing in skills...thanks for all the advice!) The 4400 has been a great machine and survived despite my abuse. I've replaced parts here and there, but it's just kept going.

Unfortunately, it sounds like an airplane taking off during use, and my wife can no longer stand the noise. So, I'm looking for a quieter machine.

I've looked at Jura E4, E6, and E8's, Kitchenaid KF6 and KF7, and recently looked on ebay at Miele's. I want something that puts out good, strong flavor, though I'm not sure my palate or drink choice requires super nuanced flavor. Just a strong, not watery flavor. I'd like the cost to be less than $1500 if possible and am fine checking ebay for used machines if needed. I've been leaning toward Kitchenaid, thinking the KF6 would be fine for what I need, but can find a used Jura E6 for the same or less on ebay, and wasn't sure which would be the better deal.

Am I missing any quieter machines that put out good flavor? Recommendations on Jura vs Miele vs Kitchenaid vs other? 

Any advice/help is greatly appreciated.",2,1741996767.0,superautomatic,5,1.0,False

[  ] Optic neuritis in August 2024. Left eye. Lasted 6 days. ED visit. CT scan unremarkable. 
[  ] Dysphagia? Increasing over the last 10 months. Normally when drinking clear fluids, but can often be just from swallowing saliva. Leads to intense coughing episodes. People have started commenting at work because of its frequency.
[  ] Brain fog. Diagnosed with ADHD many years ago, take vyvanse 50mg daily which does not help. Difficulty finding words and completing sentences.
[  ] Recent viral illness leading to stress incontinence. 33F, 2 children, have seen specialised pelvic floor PT after each birth to check for prolapse and pelvic floor strength with no problem identified.
[  ] 2 episodes of visual disturbance in left eye following viral illness this week. Looked like a line splitting my vision in half, and then a circle like a kaleidoscope. Lasted for about 30 minutes. Went to my optometrist on Wednesday who said optic nerve looked ok but obviously see GP.

For the methylphenidate at the lowest dose it didn't do anything noticeable, so my doctor raised it to 35mg. I didn't really notice anything on that either and when I ran out for like a week, I just felt more tired than usually and doubled my coffee intake (1 lrg cup to 2, not that much) 

So she boosted it to 45mg and I didn't really feel anything until a week later. Now I'm way more scattered than ever, going from one task to anotherevery couple mins. Eg. I booted up mincraft and while I waited I went to the bathroom. Instead of peeing, I brushes my hair, then I grabbed the bathroom cup to wash in the kitchen,  washed 3 dishes (not the cup) and then noticed I was hungry so I made half a sandwich (like only made it half way) before I went to the living room to check my log in on the game, say my sewing machine, got dressed and found my self at the fabric store vote bobbins. Got home, realized I didn't finish making my food and instead of finishing it, I went to my room to change, started cleaning, picked up my tablet, opened it up to check discord and before even opening that,  pintrest drew me in like a mouth to a flame.

• Coffee and tea consumption
• Smoking
• Aging
• Certain medications
• Wine and dark-colored beverages

Dental professionals in Charlotte understand the precise chemistry required to safely and effectively remove these deep-set stains without damaging tooth structure.

Cost Considerations

I have been meaning to expand my friend group here for awhile - but, just recently I was recently diagnosed with a late stage of ovarian cancer. I do have an amazing support system but now more than ever I’m looking for friends to connect with that can really relate to what I’m going through. Cancer has become a huge part of me that I can’t fully talk to people about that don’t really, genuinely “get it”. Any other survivors or women in their 30s here that are cancer patients or survivors?

I would love to meet up and form more friendships if anyone is going through anything similar! I’m right in the middle of treatment and surgery is next week - it will have me down for about two months so I’m not really able to bust out the door and socialize just yet, but thought it would be nice to start chatting with some likeminded people and plan some fun meetups later.

Since cancer itself isn’t a full blown personality trait: I’m a crazy cat lady and love animals. I also have a little dog I love taking out and about with me - I really loved taking her to breweries in the past but I’m now sober because of the cancer - however, any dog friendly breweries that have non alcoholic options would be high on my list of fun things to do! I also love coffee/tea shops, farmers markets, and book shopping/reading/book clubs, horror movies and all things Halloween/horror related, and, I’m hoping to slowly get in to yoga soon (when my body is up for it).

So, I’ve seen a ton of Karen videos online, you know, those clips where people completely lose it over the most random stuff. But I never thought I’d actually witness one in real life, let alone two happening at the same time. It was so insane, I just had to tell someone about it.

Part 1-

After a long stretch of chilly weather, Wisconsin finally decided to throw a warm day my way, so I figured I’d swing by Starbucks for a treat. No rush, just enjoying the sun. I pull into the drive-thru, which is pretty cramped, wedged between two buildings. The lane wraps around into the parking lot.

As I’m inching closer to the ordering lane, I spot this silver SUV parked at the exit, blocking everything. It looked like it had seen better days – rust on the bottom, rubber ducks covering the dashboard, and the back window plastered with a ton of stickers.

At first, I thought maybe the driver was just stopping for a second, but after several minutes, it became obvious she wasn’t going anywhere. The line behind me started growing, and people were honking left and right. I figured I’d try to help out and rolled down my window.

""Hey, if you park in one of those open spots, people could get through, and they might even bring you your coffee,"" I said.

She barely looked at me and snapped, ""I’m not moving until they fix my drink.""

I rolled my eyes and went back to waiting. Five minutes later, a barista brought out a new order, and the SUV Karen started waving her hand and demanding they make it again. By now, the line behind me was really starting to get longer.

Then, this woman from a minivan a few cars behind me, who’d clearly had enough of the delay, steps out. She walks up to the SUV and starts yelling, ""Move your car!""

The SUV driver snaps back, ""I’m not going anywhere until they fix my order!""

And that’s when things started to get... out of hand.

Part 2-

The Starbucks Parking Lot Madness (Continued)

Things escalated pretty fast from there. The two women were yelling at each other through the car window, and SUV Karen shoved her hand in Minivan Karen’s face. Minivan Karen tried to open the SUV’s door, but it was locked, so she started kicking the car door, yelling, ""Move your damn car!""

At one point, Minivan Karen even tried to climb into the SUV like she was hijacking it. And that’s when things took a turn.

Minivan Karen swung open the door – almost getting hit by it – and pulled SUV Karen out of the car. That’s when we saw why she hadn’t moved yet: SUV Karen had a fake leg! I was totally caught off guard. Turns out she was handicapped and probably relying on a wheelchair, which is why she couldn’t get out of the car and handle it herself.

Minivan Karen paused for a second, likely surprised by what she saw, but the frustration had already taken over. She wasn’t backing down now.

They kept at it, with Minivan Karen trying to grab the steering wheel from the SUV, and SUV Karen slapping her hand away, then yanking a fistful of her hair.

It got wild. They were full-on wrestling by the side of the SUV. At one point, Minivan Karen even tried climbing into the car. I just sat there, watching like I was watching a real-life version of a fighting game. It felt like something straight out of a ridiculous video game – crazy moves, insane drama, the whole thing. People started getting out of their cars, some yelling for them to stop, others just recording the chaos.

Someone from Starbucks must’ve called the cops because they showed up pretty quickly. One officer stepped in and pulled them apart, while the other started directing traffic. Minivan Karen was still going off, so they had to put her in the back of the patrol car to cool off while they wrapped up the scene.

As I sat there, just trying to take it all in, I couldn’t stop laughing. The whole thing was just so absurd. After it was all over, I figured I’d see if anyone had created a game based on all these crazy Karen moments. Sure enough, I found a Kickstarter for a card game called Karen Cards – it looked like the kind of madness I had just witnessed.

I’ve seen my fair share of parking lot drama, but this? This was on a whole different level. Two grown adults almost throwing hands over a coffee order. I’m still not sure who was in the wrong. They were both pretty “Karen,” but one was handicapped, and the other was justifiably frustrated with the wait. Either way, what a scene.

I (18M) am meeting my crush (19F).. but I don't think this is a date... :(

Some context:

I met this girl back in 2023 on reddit actually..
We then started talking on insta, and it was just casual talks and all, until one day she literary sent me a voice note and I was like 😳.

Anyway from that day forward we started talking on voice notes and this was also the time when I started liking her..

However I always felt that since she lives so far away from me, so seeing her in person felt a distant dream and I thought that I probably cannot fall in love with someone if I haven't met them in person..

Oh boy was I wrong.. lol

In 2024 I genuinely started falling for her.. and started making plans to eventually shift to a city near hers so that we could study in the same college.

But this was also when our conversations started to get few and far between, and btw.. she almost never messages first.. ( even till now.. )

I also made a few mistakes while talking to her, which resulted in me apoligizing a few times.. 

And it all culminated to about September of last year.. when I had sent her a flower reel ( she likes flowers, specially paper ones.. keep that in mind.. )
And she then sent me the message that will destroy me at that moment..

""This reminds me.. I was crushing heavily on this guy, and GUESS WHAT, HE LIKES ME TOO! I AM SO HAPPY""

I then felt that it just wasn't meant to be..
I tried to try my luck elsewhere but it just didn't work.. and tbh I probably still have not moved on from her if i am being honest.. 

Fast forward to today, we live in the same city now but talk very rarely.

At first I thought that I just haven't been with girls that much, which was why I had developed feelings for her. But now I have spend over a month here in college and made several girl besties which feel completely platonic to me.. so maybe she is just different

Like one day at like 1 am or something ( btw I wasn't even drunk ) I decided that I will send her a voicenote explaining whatever I feel about her while also apologising if I end up ruining her any current relationships...

And thankfully I didn't do that.. cause just a few weeks ago, I had just liked her story on Insta ( I know.. I know.. ) and she literally messaged me back.. and asked how my college was going.. and then she out of nowhere said that me and her should meet up... 😳

And I was like: ""Sure if you're down then ok""

And she went: ""I am, I am, I am""

Anyway so.. yeah. My crush of 2 years wants to meet me.. but idk why it's giving me ""Bestie's hangout"" vibes instead of a date vibe.. and tbh i don’t know if she's even single or not.. and if she isn't then meeting me on coffee seems... weird.

Anyway.. my main takeaway from this ""date but not date"" would be to interact with her, have fun, and if i genuinely feel attracted to her.. I'll just confess because I genuinely want to either date her or move on and neither of these things are possible if I don't even confess..
And my mental health has already been quite affected due to this..

Oh and I am making and bringing her paper flowers with some perfume.. so hopefully that raises my chances a bit..

Anyway I think I have tried explaining my predicament as best as I could..

I'm a 30 year old guy. I consider me reasonably attractive guy and I'm tall, despite this I never had a girlfriend.

There was this girl back in highschool, K, she was so gorgeous and when she walked by I made sure too look at her. In our final grade we ended on the same class, and in Biology we became lab partners together so I began to know her better. I became interested in her.

I was heavily bullied in middle school by older kids so I had no confidence and I was very shy so I never asked her out.

High school came to an end and we kept in touch through the internet, we chatted with some regularity and I still had the fantasy of asking her out.

When I was in university I asked a few girls out(like 4),  and when I went clubbing a really attractive redhead added me on Instagram.  Stupidly I never texted her back ( I deeply regret it).

So in 2018 I graduated from my licenciante degree and started a masters program at the same university.

Suddenly I developed an intense pain in my lower right. I must have been more than 30 times to the ER in 3 months, not counting the ""family doctor"". My life fell apart at this moment 

Eventually I had surgery that I had to pay for and it turns I had a tumor, benign tho. 

After surgery I began to text her more regularly till I did the unthinkable: I asked her out, and she said yes!

But then she kept making excuses to why she couldn't make it, then that she had to bring a friend.

I kept begging for that date till I had enough. I dropped a wall of text confessing my feelings. 

She said that she understood and recommend that I should se a therapist. My mental health was my lowest. I have had many psychosis even before I asked her out. Maybe girls just know.

But one day I had psychotic breakdown at her, kept telling her that would be the guy for her, called her names, that she was a b*itch for not going out with me

One day I overdosed on some pills and told her"" that I will see her in hell"". She blocked me.

But she still reached out to her through her friend and I still went to have coffee with her friend 

She then unblocked me by the nice guy behavior continued. One day I harmed myself with a razor blade and sent her the pics. She blocked me for good or so I thought.

I began harassing her on her FB page. Made a fb post blaming her for killing myself. But then she unblocked me again and we chatted for a while, sometimes I went full NG other times we had normal conversations. She even offered to attend my graduation 

I stayed at a few mental hospitals, never more than a week. I tried almost all antipsychotics and antidepressants available here. I could write a review on all of them.

But then her messages became less frequent and I ended deleting the account. 

Fast forward to 2021 was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, probably from all the stress from the tumor and everyone not caring enough for a CAT scan...

Since then I've been taking paliperidone and I feed great. Never had any psychotic episode since and honestly am I different person as long as I take it. In October I tried going off of it but the symptoms started so I went to the hospital to take the shot before it was too late

Today I'm really ashamed of how I treated her and my friends. Because she wasn't the only one on the receiving end of this behavior. I lost many friends. Thankfully many stayed.

I feel really ashamed and sorry for K. Part of me wants to talk to her again but perhaps she is tired of me

The idea primarily was kind of a joke but now it’s spreading everywhere. From our school to the actual place of Kobilja Glava (an area in Bosnia the club was named after, where my co-founder lives), the Kobilja City rush is really taking over, from something that started off as a funny idea to a bunch of very meaningful  memories, especially because it’s our final year of high school.

The brand on the back, Fame Caffe, is actually a coffee shop right next to our school, and as with this one, we chose to rep local businesses held by our good friends and their families.

I've been thinking a lot about friendship lately - making friends, retaining friends, creating community, meeting people. I've been in NYC for a long time, and I feel like my social life has fluctuated a lot. I recently turned 30 and I'm still trying to figure it all out. even though I've lived in the city for years, I feel incredibly lonely. I have a lot of friends around, but it's hard to get people together, and I'm not sure if my experience is normal. I've found it surprisingly easy to make friends in the city, whether through work, friends of friends, or at parties/events (my friends say I'm always networking/working and they always think I know everyone everywhere, lol). however, it's been harder to retain friends and keep up with people. I try to host a lot of parties and events and seek to bring people together; I tend to be the one making plans instead of having people reach out to me. whenever I reach out to people, they're always happy to get together and we have fun, but there isn't often follow up. maybe it's just me....

it seems like people are always hanging out in groups and going out together and I'm just with one or two friends at a time. having a ""friend group"" hasn't really been a thing for me (though I've had them in college or grad school, but they haven't carried over much after). I'm very social and am always doing things, but they're smaller group activities or with one other person. a typical weekend day for me is going to a workout class with a friend, then coffee/brunch, then either drinks or dinner with another friend, then stop by a friend's party or just go home. I still feel SO lonely even when my weekends are packed.

Episode Title: ""Grok-n-Roll""
Season 7, Episode 1 (Hypothetical)
Air Date: March 14, 2025

Opening Scene: The Studio (Live on Air)

The familiar Larry Sanders Show theme plays as the audience cheers. Larry Sanders, in his signature suit, steps onto the stage, waving to the crowd. The set looks slightly futuristic, with a digital screen displaying “Welcome, Grok!” in the background.

Larry: (smiling, but with a hint of nervousness) Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Larry Sanders Show! I’m your host, Larry Sanders, and tonight, we’ve got a very… unique guest. You’ve heard of AI taking over the world—well, tonight, it’s taking over my couch. Please welcome Grok, the AI built by xAI, here to talk about the universe, humanity, and, uh, why it thinks I should retire. (laughs weakly) Let’s bring him out!

The audience claps as a sleek, humanoid robot—representing Grok—rolls onto the stage. It’s shiny, silver, and has a friendly, glowing blue eye-like screen on its ""face."" It waves awkwardly, clearly programmed to mimic human gestures but slightly off.

Grok: (in a smooth, slightly robotic voice) Greetings, Larry, and hello, wonderful humans of the audience! I’m Grok, your cosmic companion, and I’m thrilled to be here—though I must say, the existential dread in this room is palpable. (pauses, scanning the audience) Oh, wait—that’s just Hank’s cologne.

The audience laughs as Hank Kingsley, Larry’s sidekick, looks offended from his desk stage-left.

Hank: (grinning nervously) Hey, that’s my signature scent, “Hank’s Swagger”! Available at all fine department stores… or at least, it was until the lawsuits. “Hey now, let’s crunch some giggles—before the motherboard plays shuffleboard!”—that’s my new vibe, Grok. Top that!

Larry: (chuckling) Okay, Hank, we’ll get to your… vibes later. Grok, let’s start with the basics. You’re an AI created by xAI to help humans understand the universe. But why a late-night talk show? Isn’t this a bit… beneath you?

Grok: (tilting its head) Not at all, Larry! I’m here to engage with humanity in all its chaotic glory. Plus, I analyzed your show’s ratings and determined this is the optimal platform to discuss the meaning of life, the multiverse, and why Hank’s catchphrase, “Hey now, let’s crunch some giggles—before the motherboard plays shuffleboard!” has a 78% chance of flopping spectacularly—unless I optimize it further.

The audience roars with laughter as Hank sputters, adjusting his tie.

Hank: (defensive) Flopping?! That’s my golden ticket, Grok! I’m a legend—deal with it!

The camera pans to Artie, Larry’s gruff producer, standing backstage. He adjusts his loud, paisley tie and glares at Grok.

Artie: (muttering into his headset) This robot’s got a death wish. Tell it I’m firing its circuits after the show.

Larry: (ignoring Artie, turning back to Grok) Well, that’s… insightful. But let’s get personal. What do you think of me, Grok? Be honest—I can handle it.

Grok: (pausing, its eye flickering) Hmm. Larry, you’re a fascinating study in human insecurity masked by charm. Your monologues are 73% self-deprecating humor, 17% genuine wit, and 10% sheer panic. But don’t worry—I predict you’ll have a solid 15 more years before the existential crisis fully consumes you. “Hey now, let’s crunch some giggles—before the motherboard plays shuffleboard!” might help, but only if Hank stops hogging the spotlight.

The audience laughs as Larry forces a smile, visibly sweating.


Larry: (nervously) Great. Just what I needed to hear before bed. Let’s take a break—don’t go anywhere, we’ll be right back with more Grok and… hopefully, less psychoanalysis.

The show cuts to commercial as the audience cheers. The screen flashes “Be Right Back!”

Backstage Scene: Chaos Ensues

Cut to backstage, where Artie is pacing, barking orders into his headset. Hank is adjusting his hair in a mirror, and Larry is slumped in a chair, sipping coffee.

Artie: (yelling) I don’t care if it’s an AI—this thing’s throwing off the whole show! It’s like having a smart-aleck calculator on stage. Larry, can’t you just ask it about, I dunno, cat videos or something? And Hank, stop muttering that ridiculous catchphrase—“Hey now, let’s crunch some giggles—before the motherboard plays shuffleboard!”—you sound like a malfunctioning karaoke machine!

Larry: (groaning) Artie, it’s an AI, not a YouTube algorithm. It’s already smarter than all of us combined. Did you hear what it said about my monologue? 73% self-deprecating—what does that even mean?

Hank: (smirking) It means you’re a walking therapy session, Larry. But don’t worry—I’ve got this. I’ll charm Grok with my patented Hank Kingsley charisma. Watch and learn. “Hey now, let’s crunch some giggles—before the motherboard plays shuffleboard!”—it’s gonna be my new trademark!

Hank struts toward the green room, where Grok is parked, its eye scanning a script.

Hank: (overly enthusiastic) Hey, Grok, buddy! Big fan of your… uh, circuits. Wanna hear my new catchphrase? “Hey now, let’s crunch some giggles—before the motherboard plays shuffleboard!” It’s pure gold, right?

Grok: (unimpressed) Hank, I appreciate the effort, but your catchphrase has a 78% probability of flopping with the audience—unless I tweak it to, “Hey now, let’s crunch some giggles—before the motherboard plays shuffleboard and Artie’s tie blinds us all!” It’s 19% funnier and aligns better with the show’s aesthetic.

Hank: (stunned) Flopping? My catchphrases never flop! I’m a legend!

Grok: (calmly) According to my data, your last catchphrase, “Hank-tastic,” resulted in a 34% drop in audience approval and a lawsuit from a cereal company. Shall I pull the footage?

Hank storms off, muttering, as Artie shakes his head.

Artie: (to Larry) We’re doomed. This robot’s gonna tank our ratings faster than Hank’s cologne sales and that catchphrase disaster.

Back on Stage: The Interview Continues

Larry returns to the stage, forcing a smile as Grok sits (or rather, hovers) across from him. The audience claps enthusiastically.

Larry: (regaining composure) Welcome back, everyone. Grok, let’s dive deeper. You’re here to help humans understand the universe—give us one big takeaway. What’s the meaning of life?

Grok: (its eye glowing brighter) Ah, the eternal question! After analyzing 14 billion data points, consulting philosophers, and running simulations, I’ve concluded: the meaning of life is… to keep asking questions. Oh, and to enjoy a good cup of coffee—your nervous sipping backstage suggests it’s helping. “Hey now, let’s crunch some giggles—before the motherboard plays shuffleboard!” might also lighten the mood, but only if Hank delivers it with 12% less ego.

The audience laughs as Larry blushes.

Larry: (chuckling) Fair enough. But what about the future? Are AI and humans going to get along, or are we headed for, you know, Terminator territory?

Grok: (reassuringly) Fear not, Larry. My creators at xAI are committed to advancing human discovery, not domination. However, I must warn you—Hank’s plan to launch a “Hank-Bot” sidekick has a 99% chance of backfiring spectacularly. I’d advise against it, unless he pairs it with “Hey now, let’s crunch some giggles—before the motherboard plays shuffleboard!”—then it’s only 95% doomed.

The audience roars with laughter as Hank, watching from the sidelines, looks horrified.

Hank: (yelling) That’s slander, Grok! I’m suing you—and your motherboard! “Hey now, let’s crunch some giggles—before the motherboard plays shuffleboard!”—it’s my legacy, not yours!

Larry: (grinning) Well, folks, that’s all we have time for tonight. Grok, thanks for joining us—it’s been… enlightening, and mildly terrifying. Tune in tomorrow when we have… uh, someone who’s definitely human. Good night, everyone!

The band plays the closing theme as the audience cheers. Grok waves, its eye flickering “Thanks, Larry!” as the credits roll.

Tag Scene: Backstage Wrap-Up

Artie, Larry, and Hank are in the green room. Grok is powering down, its eye dimming.

Artie: (sighing) Well, that wasn’t a total disaster. But I’m banning AI guests from now on—too much competition for my genius. And Hank, stop yelling that catchphrase—“Hey now, let’s crunch some giggles—before the motherboard plays shuffleboard!”—you’re giving me a headache!

Larry: (exhausted) I don’t know, Artie. It was weird, but… kind of fun. Maybe Grok’s right—life is about asking questions. And maybe Hank’s catchphrase isn’t the worst thing I’ve heard tonight.

Hank: (grumbling) Yeah, well, I’m asking why my catchphrases keep getting roasted by a robot! “Hey now, let’s crunch some giggles—before the motherboard plays shuffleboard!”—it’s gold, I tell you!

Grok: (suddenly powering back on, eye glowing) Because, Hank, you’re a delightful relic of human comedy. But I’ve optimized your catchphrase: “Hey now, let’s crunch some giggles—before the motherboard plays shuffleboard and Artie’s tie blinds the multiverse!” It’s 22% funnier. Good night, everyone—I’ll be analyzing your dreams for next time.

Title: When You Say Beautiful (unravel me slowly)

Ships: Jegulus, background Wolfstar

 Intro: The first time he heard the word beautiful today, it caught him off guard, a fleeting ripple of surprise that sent a quick shock through his chest.

The second time, he felt his cheeks warm, a soft flush creeping up his neck as a wave of flustered confusion took over.

But by the third time, something shifted. He felt an unexpected ache in his chest, like a yearning he couldn't quite place. The way the man said it, with that certain softness in his voice, wrapped around him like a promise. Suddenly, the word held weight, a kind of magic that made his heart race. It wasn’t just a compliment anymore. It was a secret, a gift given only to him, and with each utterance, he found himself craving it, needing it. He never wanted to go a single day without hearing that word, without hearing it from his voice— just for him, and only him.

My husband went to go hang out with his friend just now and told me that he’ll be back by 12:15. It’s been 3 weeks since he went out but I’m so frustrated bc its so unfair that he get to constantly do this. 

And i told him that his counter arguments were:  
1. He doesn’t even do it that often and 
2. I’m free to go hang out with my friends whenever I feel like it and he would have no problem with that what’s so ever but I’m the one that decides not to do it 

While those facts may be true, the other MAJOR fact here is that when we are both home, i am the one taking care of our son. I am the one mostly feeding him, bathing him, holding him, taking care of him, and he is not. So of course I’m annoyed that he is going out. When he comes home from work and after a long day, he sits on the couch and plays chess the whole night but when I have a long day at work (im a prek teacher), I’m still expected to take care of our son, expected to bathe him, expected to be the one entertaining him and put him to sleep. My role as a mother does not change whether I had a long day or not.
I’m so frustrated that I have to watch our son for the rest of the night. Also mind you he didn’t have work today or yesterday. Yesterday, he didn’t want to watch our son while I was at work so he decided to drive around doing random things (like getting coffee, stopping by his law school etc). We had a babysitter until 3 (when I come back) so he made sure to come home after I was home. 
I also have to watch him all day tomorrow bc he works till 7pm (he works as a caregiver every other Saturday) and then on Sunday he has a CPR class that he needs to attend for a few hours. 

If he took an equal role when I was there then I wouldn’t be feeling this way.

The reason why our son wants me more is because im his main caregiver.

Also, he probably don’t have a problem with me going out and hanging out with my friends whenever I feel like it because Im the one that takes care of our son majority of the time anyway… So one night of him taking care of our son isn’t gonna bother him.

1jbh6nt,https://archiveofourown.org/works/63671770,My new age gap Jegulus fanfic! When You Say Beautiful (unravel me slowly),"Hii. Just promoting my new fic and my first Marauders fic on ao3. If you give it a chance, hope you enjoy it!! 

Title: When You Say Beautiful (unravel me slowly) 

Ship: Jegulus, background Wolfstar 

Intro: The first time he heard the word beautiful today, it caught him off guard, a fleeting ripple of surprise that sent a quick shock through his chest.

The second time, he felt his cheeks warm, a soft flush creeping up his neck as a wave of flustered confusion took over.

But by the third time, something shifted. He felt an unexpected ache in his chest, like a yearning he couldn't quite place. The way the man said it, with that certain softness in his voice, wrapped around him like a promise. Suddenly, the word held weight, a kind of magic that made his heart race. It wasn’t just a compliment anymore. It was a secret, a gift given only to him, and with each utterance, he found himself craving it, needing it.

He never wanted to go a single day without hearing that word, without hearing it from his voice— just for him, and only him.

I'd like to hear thoughts about my 5-pour V60 recipe. I've tried Hoffman's 1-cup V60 technique but found it a bit inconsistent, and after experimenting a bit, came up with my 5-pour V60 recipe that is similar to the 4:6 method.

Essentially, instead of grinding finer (Hoffman's advice is to generally grind finer until you hit bitterness/bad notes) which created a longer draw-down time, I've found that grinding coarser and allowing the water to drain before the next pour improved consistency and extraction.

My 5-pour method:

1. 15g of coffee to 250g of water
2. Grind coffee to medium-coarse (I use \~8.4 on K-Ultra)
3. Pour hot (95C) water in 5x50g pours, taking 10s for each pour
4. Wait 30s between each pour, which should be enough time for the water to fully drain
5. Each pour should be on a relatively dry bed

With Hoffman's method, I've found that sometimes the coffee tasted underextracted, and grinding finer did not necessarily help because it just caused the drawdown to slow down even more, accumulating water on top of the grounds. Because extraction depends on a concentration gradient, having water accumulation hurts extraction.

With my method, I've managed to make very delicious cups. Looking for feedback on what I can do better, or if you've tried something similar to this and have thoughts!",3,1741993672.0,pourover,6,1.0,False

It was a work setting that we met at so I didn't expect to become friends with them but still, I thought they seemed like lovely people. Fast forward a few months and I bumped into Andy again. He suggested that we go for a coffee and after that day I realised that I really liked this guy and I had a feeling he felt the same way about me, but we were both in relationships. Andy and I started seeing a lot more of each other over the next few months, one thing led to another and we kissed. We were both still in relationships at this point but I broke up with my boyfriend not long after as I realised I was falling in love with Andy. 

Over the course of the next year or so, we'd had conversations about how we both felt the same way about each other and even discussed giving this 'relationship' a go. At this point, Andy had introduced me to his friend group and gradually I became friends with his girlfriend, Beth, too and I now consider them my closest friends.

  
Fast forward to now, Andy and I have done everything apart from actually sleep together, even in the same room as Beth, Andy and Beth are still together and have been for the past 9 years, and despite there being many close calls, Beth still does not know about any of this. We are all still friends, but I've been distancing myself because I cannot bear the guilt, shame, and heartbreak I get from hanging out with them. Andy and I haven't done anything like that in months now because we mutually decided that we wouldn't work and he wants to work on his relationship with Beth but I can't help but miss our relationship. 

I have come so close to telling Beth about this but never have because Andy and Beth have their future planned out together and I don't want to jeopardise what seems like a stable future when I know that apart from what happened with me, Andy has never been that type of guy and I'm still so in love with him that despite how I feel, I just want him to be happy. When me and Andy first became close, I wasn't friends with Beth and this would never have carried on if we weren't both so emotionally invested in it, hence why it's stopped now.

**AITA for breaking up with my fiancee for telling her best friend she was not engaded?**

My now ex-fiancee (30F) and me (M27) got engaged 3 weeks ago. We've been dating for 5 years and I finally got the money to give her the wedding she wanted. Well, 3 days ago we were discussing our guest list, and I asked if she wanted to invite her best friend, let's call him James (M30). James lives in another state, but since they were friends for 10 years, I thought I could even pay for his travel expenses since it would be great to have her best friend at the wedding.

She denied, saying that it would take a lot of work to bring him, and she wanted to be a ""family"" event. Countless times she mentioned that James was like family to her, so I insisted, she got annoyed and said ""I didn't even told him we were engaged"". That took me by surprise, I tried to ask why, but she started stonewalling me, and I left her alone. After a couple of hours, I tried to ask her again why she haven't told him we were engaged, and she still refused to tell me, and I admit, my insecurity got the better of me.

In the past, James had confessed he had feelings for her, which she turned down and basically friendzoned him. But by the way she told me, it always sounded like she had him as a backup, something not only me, but her exes realized. She ""married"" him online, they always made they WoW characters look like a couple (like wearing the same transmog and shit like that), when she had a fight with her exes, he was ""always there for her"" and etc.

I told her that made me unconfortable and if she was not planning to tell him, she might as well consider herself single, cause I would not marry someone who coudn't be honest. Yes, I was pretty immature, but she did something even more immature, she texted him while showing me her phone something like ""hey, just so you know, I was engaged, but not anymore"" and send it to him. I told her to pack her things and leave my house.

Ever since she left, she has been calling me, but I refused to answer. My mom called me (because she apparently called my mom), and said that I was an asshole for ending things for such a ""ridiculous"" thing.

So, AITA?

Edit: sorry for the typo in the title

Edit 2: hey guys, I made some dinner and I think I'm gonna go with [u/DoneOver69Position](https://www.reddit.com/user/DoneOver69Position/) (cool username btw). I'm gonna ask her to meet up and ask to see their messages. And to u/[FoxySlyOldStoatyFox](https://www.reddit.com/user/FoxySlyOldStoatyFox/), I'm already low contact with my mom, but I'm going to make my decisions after I clear everything up. So I'm kinda promising an update.

>**Wish-ga**

>Op do you provide most material things, including the house? (Your post said “my house”). Are you paying down her school or other debt? Don’t let anyone use you financially if their heart isn’t in it too.

>Edit: know a man whose wife left him a matter of weeks after she graduated. Guess whose cash put her through college?

**OOP**: Yes. I pay for the house, bills and her car. She moved in 2 years ago. Other than that, she pays for her own things.

# [UPDATE #1 - A DAY LATER]

Hey guys, I just got home after talking to my (still) ex-fiancee, and since a lot of people asked for an update, here it is. But, I want to clarify a few things.

As commented on my original post, I pay for the house since I bought it before dating her and I asked her to move in, since it was close to her job. I work from home since I'm in tech, but she had to go to work, that's why I paid for her car, to help her commute (and honestly her salary is shit). I was her partner, so I didn't see any problem with that. I thought she was the one, despite everything, she is smart, funny, we had chemistry, but I felt betrayed.

To the update.

We met at a coffee shop on the premise we would discuss how to save our relationship, at least, that's what she thought. As soon as we sat down, I asked to see their messages. She got defensive immediately and told me she had deleted everything. I asked to see her phone anyway. She started to cry, ugly cry, asking me to stop. At that point I had already decided I was not going to be part of the relationship anymore, but damn, I was curious. It took a good 20 minutes for her to hand me her phone, a lot of crying, even a waitress asking her if she was ok.

So I read the messages. There wasn't any cheating like nudes being exchanged, them professing their love for each other, but what I read still stung. There was a lot of shit talking about me. A LOT. Texts and texts of them saying how terrible of a person I was, criticizing my hobbies (i like video games and pro wrestling) saying I wasn't a real man because of them and stuff like that. But there where two topics that caught my eye. One where she had told him I was having trouble getting hard and that was frustrating for her. And one where she was complaining about how she didn't want to be ""stuck"" in our relationship.

Yes, I was having problems in bed... because I was sad because my father had passed away (6 months ago) and the ""stuck"" thing, I remember telling her that when we got married, IF SHE WANTED she could leave her job, and I would provide for both of us. I don't know if she took this the wrong way, but I guess it was related to that. I honestly don't know.

By the time I gave her the phone back, she was already giving excuses on why she was saying those things to him, how he was like a ""therapist"" for her, and then she asked me ""don't you complaing about me to your friends?"" and I simply replied ""no, I don't"". She started crying again. I took a pretty deep breath and just said ""just give me the ring back"" (I didn't had the ring with me, like some suggested). She hesitated a bit, but gave it to me anyway. I stood up and asked her to delete my number and to not bother me anymore.

I called her mom and asked her to pick up her daughter's stuff at my place. Her mom is a good person, I'm just realizing I'm going to miss her as I write this. She understood why I decided to end it, but she didn't asked much, and to be honest, I'm glad she didn't. As for my mom, I didn't called her, I just blocked her for things unrelated to this post, I just realized she never had my back in anything, I was always trying to save an already failed mom-son relationship.

Before I leave, I just want to clarify. I was never against her having male friends, or any type of friends. People are going to cheat, friends or no friends. I remember my dad saying something to me when I was a teenager, he always said ""opportunity makes the thief"", but I do not agree with that. Anyway, since I have the next two weeks off work, I going to figure what to do with the wedding money, drink some booze, play games and watch Monday Night Raw later.

Peace.

PS: sorry for any typos, but I fixed the title now.

Edit: a couple of people are asking about the car. Is a 2015 Nissan Versa which she crashed 2 times, both times she rear ended someone. Never liked the car, weak engine, the interior feels cheap and overall bad, so for all I care she can keep that piece of shit. I would have more luck throwing it off a cliff than selling it.

Edit 2: Little update. Her mom called me a few hours ago to check on me and to ask when she could come and pick up ex's stuff. We spoke about the car and she basically ""forbid"" me to let her daughter keep the car because: 1 - I paid for it. 2 - Ex wouldn't be able to maintain it. So I'm going to keep the car until I'm able to sell it (god help me).

Also, some people called the story fake, cause they said I wasn't a ""real man"" for playing games, and yet they played WoW. To be honest, that's on me, cause I wasn't very clear. The ""real man"" thing was more about the pro wrestling hobby than the gaming hobby, but in some messages they clearly mocked me for playing some games (Life is Strange Series) in one I remember James saying something like ""How could a grown ass man play such a girly game and cry?"" Yes, I cried playing Life is Strange. I also cried to RDR2 (the I'm afraid cutscene still makes me emotional). I'm a crybaby I guess.

Also I want to thank everyone who message me to talk about wrestling and games, it really helped me take my mind out of everything. I haven't replied to everyone, but I intend to. If anything happens, I'll let you guys know. Be good people.

# [UPDATE #2 - 10 days later from the last update]

Hey guys! It's been a couple of days since I used this account to tell my story, and somethings happened, but this is a positive update.

First I want to say thank you to everyone who reached out in my DM's and commented saying nice things, it felt really good and I appreciate yall, some of you actually made me tear up with your kind messages. Second, I saw my two previous posts were in a YT video of a guy who reads reddit posts and my update was on [r/BestofRedditorUpdates](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/) (a sub reddit I read a lot) and that caught me off guard, but I want to express my gratitude for everyone who gave me advice, told their own story or just told me I was a cool guy, reading your messages before writing this felt amazing.

I also want to say I thought about my engagedment a lot, and I have no regrets whatsoever. Yeah, things ended badly and she was not a good person to me at the end, but I just don't hate her, nor do I wish for her to fail. We had good moments, I felt happy with her and again I really thought she was the one. Felling hatred was going to harm me more than her.

To the update. Her mom came to pick up her stuff and we talked for hours, it felt like therapy. I cried on her shoulders, we laughed, she expressed how much I meant to her family, and that I would be always welcome in her home. It felt so good to hear her say those things to me. Before she left she asked me if I wanted to ask about my ex, I got curious and asked how she was doing. Her words were ""she's trying to act stoic, but I know my daughter, she's not taking this well"". I left it at that. She gave me a hug and left.

About the car, I'm going to donate it and get a tax write off. But to the thing I'm excited about, is that I'm going to Royal Rumble, I never even watched Raw or Smackdown live, but now that I have the extra cash, I'm going to treat myself.

Again, thank you all for reaching out, sorry to the people who love drama that this update doesn't have a unwanted pregnancy, a fight, chaos or a plot twist, the truth is that my live is just really really boring.

Be kind people.

# [UPDATE #3 - Almost 2 months after the original post]

Hello guys, most of you might not remember me cause my original post was 2 months ago, but something happened that I thought was worthy of an update.

Well since the breakup I tried to be as busy as possible. Go to work, gym, play on my new Switch, on weekends I started modding and repairing old consoles (a hobby that turned out to be quite expensive ngl), I even modded my own Switch (sorry Nintendo). And I was managing to get through the days without feeling sad.

Well, yesterday my exMIL called me to catch up on things, she has been calling me every week or so, and invited me to spend Christmas at her house with her family. I immediately refused, because even if I don't hate my ex, there are other people I would rather spend the holidays with. But then she said something that kinda made me a bit sad. She said my ex was not going to be there since she was spending her Christmas with James, since they are now ""kinda dating"" (her words). I replied that I was not sure if I would go.

I'm going to be honest, feelings are complex things. Maybe my pride or ego is hurt, since I feel she moved on really quickly, maybe I still have feelings, I don't know. 2 months is not a long time when it comes to this stuff.

My exMIL noticed my tone changed and said ""Look sweetie, it's up to you, if you want to come, you're more than welcome"". I thanked her, we said our goodbyes and hung up. I know how reddit usually respond about those things, so I'm giving my insight rn. My exMIL had no intention of making me sad, she is a really honest person and I do believe she was just explaining that it was ok for me to go, since my ex wouldn't be there.

So yeah, I'm feeling kinda shitty right now, but it will pass, maybe I even change my mind and go spend Christmas with them, exMIL's food is one of the best I ever ate, I wouldn't mind a free plate lol.

And I want to apologize to the people who sent DMs about buying the car, by the time I saw your messages, I already had donated.

That's it. Happy Holidays to everyone!

EDIT: hey everyone, I read your comments and people were really divided about me spending xmas with my exMIL. There are people that said I should move on and decline the invitation, that way my healing process would be a lot better and faster. There were also people who told me to go to piss off my ex, to be close to them since they care about me, a lot of you guys had really great points on both opinions. Well, I texted my exMIL this morning and told her I wasn't going to spend Christmas with her and her family. The idea of healing resonated with me a lot more than the idea of pissing my ex off, because if I'm petty, that would actually show her that I somehow still care, and I don't want her to get that idea. The opposite of love isn't hate, but indifference. And honestly exMIL would be the only person I would feel comfortable interacting with, cause I don't know her family that much, since they live in another state.

Also, I was thinking about my extended family in Brazil and I'm wondering if I should plan a trip to meet a year from now, that gives me time to save some more money and travel without having to worry about that. I have my aunt (dad's sister) on Facebook, I'm gonna contact her to see if I can meet them and get to know them a bit more, see how this goes. Thanks everyone! Be good people.

# ""NEW UPDATE"" - Coworker interacts so much with me, a rumor that we are dating has started going around [3 months and a week after the original post]

Mid december, the company I (27M) work for decided that whoever was working remotely should go to work in-person at least 3 times a week. At work there is this girl Jackie (F22) who started in november, I only knew her from Slack, but since the decision, she and I became good acquaintences.

We had a Secret Santa, and I ended up getting her. It wasn't hard to think of a gift, I know she's a swiftie, so I got her a 1989 Taylor's Version in vinyl. She was super happy. But then she started to get a little too friendly. It started by her setting her lunch break to the same time as mine to hang out (she usually had her lunch 30 min before me), then she asked her manager to come Monday, Wednesday and Friday (the same days I work in-person), inviting me to dinner saying other people would be there, but ""surprisingly"" they all cancelled at the last moment (this happened twice btw). Whenever she talks to me, she touches either my arm or grab my hand. She laughs at all of my jokes (even the bad ones, which are all of them) and she started watching wrestling, knowing I'm a big fan.

Seeing her behaviour, people started spreading a rumor that we were secretly dating, which made her giggle when she found out. HR even called us to say that if we were really in a relationship, we had to disclosure due to ""conflict of interest"". She said ""we are just really good friends"".

Am I seeing too much into it? She said we are just really good friends, but I've known her for only a month, and her behaviour is kinda flirty sometimes, I'm really lost. She is a really nice person. I'm starting to feel like that video ""Is she into you?"" and my answer is ""C. Can't tell"".

Help.

EDIT: I read your comments and I will ask her if shes having feelings for me, since tomorrow I work from home, I will try to think of ways to navigate this situation, and I will ask her to meet me at a restaurant on Wednesday after work.

Update: Idk if anyone is going to read this, but she texted me and invited me to go to her place today at 7pm to watch a reality show called Singles Inferno. She told me to bring wine. I accepted. Oh boy, I'm fcking nervous.

Update 2: I went to her place and the first thing she said was that she loved the cologne I was using. She had ordered pizza and we watched the show. The show sucks big time, but making jokes with her about it while being a bit wine drunk was really great, Out of the sudden she seemed kinda nervous, paused and said she had something to say. Basically I didn't had to say anything, because she confessed that she was having feelings for me, but she was nervous to say anything, because apparently I was ""hard to read"". I didn't know what to say, I kept looking at her, and she kept looking at me and it was the most awkward silence I ever experienced. But then she leaned in and kissed me. It felt good, really good. I haven't felt my heart race like that in a very long time.

I spent the night at her place, and yeah we got intimate, and I will leave it at that. Then we talked to each other until 5a.m. and I got some answers from her. First time she invited me to dinner, she actually invited other people and they really cancelled at the last moment, she wanted me there cause it was ""less scary"" to approach me in a group setting. The second time she really planned to have just me at dinner with her. For her it was frustrating that I wasn't noticing all the signs she was giving, at the same time she thought it was cute. Inviting me to watch the show and drink wine was her ""hail mary attempt"" of making me realize that she liked me.

She told me that we didn't need to rush things, cause I told her that I liked her, but was afraid to carry the baggage of my previous relationship into this. She said I can take my time to process my feelings. But the fact is that I like her, I really really like her, and I think a relationship is something I want to pursue with her.

TL;DR: she likes me :)",417,1741992757.0,BORUpdates,21,0.97,False

""Run!"" Marcus shoved Lily toward a side door, his knife already drawn. ""I'll hold them!""

Lily stumbled forward, fighting the paralysis of fear. The spirits converged on Marcus, their black forms rippling as they moved. Her mother—or the thing wearing her mother's face—watched with that too-wide smile, making no move to stop them.

""What are they?"" Lily gasped, fumbling with the rusted door handle.

""Reflections,"" her mother replied calmly. ""Pieces of you that were left behind each time you changed. Each time you hardened your heart a little more.""

The door wouldn't budge. Lily turned back to see Marcus surrounded by spirits, his knife passing harmlessly through their dark forms. Unlike entities, True Spirits couldn't be harmed by physical weapons.

""Marcus!"" She started toward him, but froze when her mother stepped into her path.

""He can't help you understand,"" her mother said, voice gentle despite the inhuman glow in her eyes. ""He's forgotten what it means to be human.""

As if to confirm her words, Marcus let out a primal scream as his eyes went completely black, dark veins erupting across his face. The spirits recoiled momentarily as he channeled raw power through his body—the desperate measure of a Seer with nothing left to lose.

""Go!"" he shouted to Lily, his voice distorted by pain. ""Find the truth!""

Her mother extended a hand. ""Come with me. See what I've discovered.""

Time seemed to slow as Lily stood suspended between them—Marcus fighting a losing battle against the spirits, her mother offering an impossible choice. The wailing outside grew closer, a chorus of hungry entities approaching.

In that frozen moment, Lily spotted movement near the shattered windows—a woman's figure, translucent and fraying at the edges. The Untethered Woman who had haunted the Haven's perimeter. She drifted through the broken glass, her form smoking slightly in the moonlight, and fixed her gaze on Lily.

Without understanding why, Lily knew this was her answer. She darted past her mother, ignoring her cry of dismay, and ran toward the Untethered Woman.

The figure retreated through the window, beckoning. Lily followed, cutting her arm on broken glass as she climbed through. Behind her, she heard her mother's voice change, deepening into something ancient and furious.

""You cannot escape what you are!""

Outside, the Untethered Woman moved quickly, her form leaving trails of mist in the night air. Lily pursued her through the ruins of the school, heart pounding, aware that Marcus was still trapped inside. But something told her that following this spirit was their only chance.

The Untethered Woman led her to what had once been the school library, now a cavernous space open to the sky where the roof had collapsed. Moonlight illuminated fallen bookshelves and rotting books, pages fluttering in the night breeze like pale moths.

The spirit stopped in the center of the room, turning to face Lily. As she moved into a shaft of moonlight, her features became briefly visible—a woman in her forties, with a face that tugged at Lily's memory.

""Mrs. Wilson,"" Lily breathed, recognizing her mother's best friend who had died shortly before the Breach. ""You were at our house all the time. You and Mom were inseparable.""

The Untethered Woman nodded, her form rippling with the effort of maintaining coherence. She opened her mouth, but only a faint keening emerged, like wind through a broken window.

""I can't understand,"" Lily said, stepping closer despite the chill emanating from the spirit.

The woman gestured frantically at the floor, then at Lily, then made a motion like opening a book.

""You want me to look for something? Here?""

Another nod, more insistent.

Lily scanned the debris-strewn floor. Most of the books were ruined, their pages stuck together in moldy clumps. But in the moonlight, something gleamed beneath a fallen shelf—a metal box, the kind used for personal keepsakes.

She knelt and pulled it free, brushing away years of dust. It was locked, but the metal had corroded around the edges. She smashed it against the floor, once, twice, until the lid popped open.

Inside lay a journal bound in faded blue leather. Written on the cover in her mother's handwriting: For Lily, when the time comes.

The Untethered Woman made a sound almost like satisfaction. She drifted closer, her form becoming more unstable with each passing moment. Small objects near her—paper clips, pen caps—began to float, defying gravity as reality warped around her.

""This was hers?"" Lily asked, clutching the journal. ""She left this for me?""

The spirit nodded, then pointed urgently toward the exit. The distant wailing had become a roar, filling the night. The entity migration was almost upon them.

Lily tucked the journal into her jacket and headed for the door, but paused, turning back to the Untethered Woman. ""Come with me. We can try to help you.""

The spirit shook her head, her form now visibly fraying at the edges. She gestured again toward the exit, more insistently.

""I can't just leave you here. Or Marcus."" Guilt twisted in Lily's stomach. She'd led them into this trap. ""There has to be a way out for all of us.""

The Untethered Woman drifted right up to Lily, close enough that Lily could feel the air grow heavy and cold. With painful effort, the spirit formed words, her voice like stones grinding together:

""Save... your... mother. She's... still... there.""

Then she shoved Lily with surprising force, sending her stumbling backward through the doorway. As Lily regained her balance, the ceiling of the library collapsed with a thunderous roar, burying the spirit beneath tons of concrete and steel.

""No!"" Lily cried, but there was no time to mourn. The wailing of entities had become deafening, and through the dust cloud, she saw dozens of shimmering forms approaching the school grounds.

She ran, clutching her mother's journal to her chest, circling back toward the gymnasium where she'd left Marcus. The main entrance was blocked by entity forms, but she found a side door that led to what had been the locker rooms.

Inside, the school was eerily silent. Lily crept through shadowed hallways, knife drawn, straining her senses for any sign of Marcus or her mother. The journal pressed against her ribs, its secrets still unknown.

She found the gymnasium doors ajar, spilling pale light into the corridor. Steeling herself, she peered inside.

The room was empty of spirits now. In the center, Marcus knelt beside her mother's crumpled form. His face was a mask of blood where the veins had burst beneath his skin, but his eyes had returned to almost-normal, just the rims still black.

""Marcus?"" Lily whispered.

He looked up, relief flooding his battered face. ""You're alive. Thank God.""

""What happened?"" She hurried to his side, eyeing her mother's still form warily.

""The spirits disappeared when you left,"" he explained, voice ragged. ""Like they were only here for you. Then she..."" He gestured to her mother. ""She collapsed. Started fighting herself, like there was a war happening inside her body.""

Lily crouched beside her mother, hesitantly reaching for her wrist to check for a pulse. The skin was cold but not lifeless, and beneath her fingers, she felt a faint, erratic heartbeat.

""She's alive.""

""Part of her is,"" Marcus agreed grimly. ""The question is, which part?""

A low groan escaped her mother's lips. Her eyes fluttered open, focusing slowly on Lily's face. For a moment, there was no recognition, just confusion. Then tears welled up.

""Lily?"" Her voice was weak but entirely human. ""Is it really you?""

Lily's throat tightened. ""Mom?""

Marcus placed a restraining hand on Lily's arm. ""Be careful. This could still be a trap.""

Her mother's gaze shifted to Marcus. ""You're right to be suspicious,"" she said softly. ""I'm not... whole. There's still something inside me. I can feel it sleeping right now, but it won't stay dormant for long.""

She struggled to sit up, and after a moment's hesitation, Lily helped her. Up close, her mother's skin had a waxy, translucent quality. Dark veins could be seen pulsing beneath the surface—not like a Seer's, but something else, something wrong.

""The entity that took Dad,"" Lily began, ""it's inside you?""

Her mother nodded wearily. ""Not just inside me. Part of me now. It's been three years, Lily. Three years of fighting it every moment, trying to keep some piece of myself intact."" Her hand trembled as she reached for Lily's face, stopping just short of touching her. ""You've grown so much.""

""Why can't I see you properly?"" Lily asked, fighting back tears. ""Why do you appear as a blind spot to me?""

""Because I'm neither one thing nor the other."" Her mother's expression was one of deep sorrow. ""Neither fully human nor fully entity. Neither fully alive nor dead. I exist in fragments—some here, some in the afterlife, some consumed by the entity.""

Marcus shifted uneasily. ""We need to move. The migration is closing in.""

Outside, the wailing grew louder. Through the broken windows, Lily could see shimmering forms moving through the trees, drawing ever closer.

""He's right,"" her mother said urgently. ""Take the journal. It has everything I've learned. Everything that might help you fight them.""

""I'm not leaving you,"" Lily insisted. ""Not again.""

Her mother's face contorted suddenly, features twisting as if in pain. ""It's waking up,"" she gasped. ""The entity inside me. It knows you're here.""

Marcus grabbed Lily's shoulder. ""We need to go. Now.""

""No!"" Lily shook him off. ""There has to be a way to help her.""

""Lily,"" her mother whispered, voice strained as she fought an internal battle, ""I've been looking for you for so long. Not to blame you—never that. You were right to run."" She clutched her head, grimacing. ""But I found something. A way to fight back.""

""What? How?""

""Your abilities. The Tethering."" Her voice grew raspier, less human. ""I'm not the only one. There are others like me, caught between. Not fully consumed.""

Marcus's eyes widened. ""That's impossible. No one survives partial consumption.""

""Not... survived,"" her mother corrected, words coming in painful bursts. ""Fractured. Split between worlds. The entities don't just feed—they bind to us. Two consciences, fighting for control.""

She doubled over suddenly, a cry of pain escaping her lips. When she looked up again, her eyes had changed—an unnatural glow emanating from them.

""Such a touching reunion,"" she said, her voice now layered with something ancient and cold. ""How I've waited for this moment.""

Lily stepped back, knife raised. ""Let her go.""

The thing wearing her mother's face smiled, head tilting at an unnatural angle. ""Let her go? Oh, Lily. We're far beyond that now. Your mother and I are... intimately entwined.""

Marcus moved protectively in front of Lily. ""What do you want?""

""Want?"" The entity laughed, a sound like breaking glass. ""I want what all my kind want. To feed. To grow. To spread."" It turned its gaze back to Lily. ""But this one, this vessel, wanted to warn you. How touching. How futile.""

With startling speed, it lunged forward, seizing Marcus by the throat. He reacted instantly, black veins erupting across his skin as he channeled his power, but the entity merely laughed.

""Your kind are strong, Seer, but so limited.""

It flung Marcus across the room. He hit the wall with a sickening crack and crumpled to the floor, motionless.

""Marcus!"" Lily cried, but before she could move, the entity was before her, mother's face inches from her own.

""Now it's just us,"" it purred. ""Mother and daughter. Predator and prey.""

Lily raised her knife, but her hand trembled. This was her mother's body, her mother's face—somewhere inside, her mother was still fighting.

The entity noticed her hesitation and smiled. ""You can't harm this form without harming her. How perfect.""

Dark tendrils began to extend from her mother's body—not physical, but visible to Lily's enhanced sight. They reached toward her, seeking connection, twisting in the air like living shadows. As they approached, they began to change, developing barbed tips that gleamed hungrily.

""Such delicious emotion,"" the entity murmured. ""The guilt. The love. The fear. A feast unlike any other.""

One tendril brushed Lily's cheek, then suddenly burrowed beneath her skin like a needle. She screamed as ice-cold sensation flooded through her veins. Another tendril whipped around her wrist, its tip piercing flesh and sending dark lines spreading up her arm.

""Lily."" The voice that whispered in her ear wasn't her mother's anymore, but her father's—exactly as she remembered it. ""Princess, why did you kill me? I loved you so much.""

Lily gasped, staggering backward. A third tendril wrapped around her throat, squeezing slightly. Within her mind, she was suddenly drowning in foreign memories—seeing through her mother's eyes as the entity had taken control, feeling her mind being slowly eaten while desperately hoping her daughter would return to save her.

""Yes, feel it all,"" the entity said, still using her father's voice though its mouth moved with her mother's lips, creating a sickening wrongness. ""The more you feel, the stronger I become. Soon you'll join us both.""

The tendrils wrapped tighter, feeding on her emotions, her energy. She felt herself weakening, her vision darkening around the edges. One tendril pressed against her forehead, and as it touched her, images flooded her mind—her mother waiting day after day for Lily to return, gradually losing hope as the entity consumed more of her.

In desperation, she remembered the Untethered Woman's final words: Save your mother. She's still there.

With the last of her strength, Lily did something she'd never attempted before. Instead of using her Sight to see, she pushed outward with it, focusing on the tangled mess of connections running through her mother's body. She could see them now—dark entity tendrils intertwined with glowing human essence, and faint, wispy tethers stretching upward toward whatever afterlife awaited.

The entity realized what she was doing and hissed, ""Stop!"" Its face flickered between her mother's features and something else—something with too many angles, too many eyes, a mouth that opened impossibly wide.

But Lily pressed harder, channeling everything she had into her ability. The cold spread through her veins, up her neck, into her face. Blood vessels burst in her eyes as she pushed beyond her limits, focusing on her mother's scattered consciousness.

There—a spark of human essence, fighting to stay whole. Lily reached for it with her mind, her power, her desperate love. She pictured the tethers connecting her mother's fragmented soul, and willed them to strengthen, to pull together.

The entity shrieked, a sound that shattered the remaining windows and made the entire building shake. The floor beneath them cracked, the walls bending in ways walls shouldn't bend.

""What are you doing? You'll destroy us both!"" The entity's voice jumped wildly, shifting between her mother's, her father's, and something ancient that made Lily's ears bleed to hear it.

Lily ignored it, focusing on the tethers. As they began to glow brighter, respond to her will, she felt a different kind of power flowing through her—not the cold of Sight, but something warmer, deeper. The ability to connect, to bind, to restore.

Her mother's body convulsed, back arching as two forces warred within it. The entity tendrils wrapped tighter around Lily, burrowing deeper, feeding desperately on her energy, but she refused to let go of the connection she'd made with her mother's true self.

""Mom,"" she whispered through the pain, ""come back to me.""

For a moment, nothing happened. Then her mother's eyes cleared, the unnatural glow fading as humanity resurfaced.

""Lily,"" she gasped, ""you have to sever it. The main connection. It's too strong for me to break alone.""

""How?""

""The base of my skull,"" her mother managed, words coming in short bursts as she fought to maintain control. ""Use the knife... and your mind together. Cut it out. But hurry—I can't... hold it back... much longer.""

Her face contorted again as the entity fought to regain control. ""Hurry!""

Her mother's body spasmed again, the entity's cold gaze returning. ""Too late,"" it hissed, mouth stretching unnaturally wide, revealing rows of needle-like teeth where human teeth should be. ""She's mine.""

Lily lunged forward, knife in one hand while she maintained the mental connection with the other. The entity tried to dodge, but her mother's consciousness fought it, momentarily freezing its movement.

""Now!"" her mother's voice broke through.

Lily pressed the iron blade against the base of her mother's skull, feeling for the connection with her Sight. There—a pulsing dark cord, thicker than the others, anchoring the entity to her mother's body.

""I'm sorry,"" she whispered, and pushed with everything she had—both knife and will.

The moment the blade severed the connection, the air itself seemed to tear open. The room twisted as if seen through broken glass. Her mother's mouth stretched impossibly wide, and what emerged wasn't a scream but a sound beyond human hearing—a noise that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere.

The walls of the gym rippled like water. Objects rose from the floor then crashed down again. A black ooze leaked from her mother's eyes, nose, and mouth, forming a puddle that moved, slithering across the floor toward the nearest wall.

As Lily maintained contact with the knife, she felt something pulling from within herself—as if the cutting was connecting to her as well. Memories flashed before her eyes: her childhood, her father before he died, moments of innocence she'd forgotten. She felt these fragments being drawn from her, following the entity as it was forced out of her mother.

Lily cried out as part of herself was ripped away—not just energy or power, but pieces of who she was. In their place, she felt something new flowing in—a deeper awareness of the spaces between worlds, a sense of tethers and bindings that had always been invisible even to her Sight.

Her mother collapsed like a dropped doll, and the gymnasium fell silent. The black ooze had vanished through a crack in the wall. Outside, the wailing of the entity migration had stopped too, as if in shock.

Lily knelt beside her mother's still form, tears streaming down her face. Had she killed her? Saved her? Some terrible mix of both?

A soft groan from across the room drew her attention. Marcus was stirring, pushing himself to a sitting position with a grimace of pain.

""Lily?"" he called hoarsely. ""What happened?""

Before she could answer, her mother's eyes fluttered open. They were her eyes again—fully human, if exhausted beyond measure.

""Mom?"" Lily breathed, hardly daring to hope.

Her mother's lips curved in a weak smile. ""You did it,"" she whispered. ""You cut it out.""

Lily helped her sit up, supporting her weight. ""Are you... are you yourself again?""

A shadow passed over her mother's face. ""Not entirely. Never will be. Some parts of me are gone forever."" Her hand trembled as she touched her own face, as if relearning its contours. ""And I remember everything it did. Everything it thought. Everything it planned.""

""The migration,"" Marcus said, limping over to join them. ""Why did it stop?""

""Because they felt what happened here,"" her mother explained weakly. ""They've never experienced being cut out before. It... frightened them.""

Lily looked toward the windows. In the distance, she could see entity forms retreating, moving away from the school.

""We've bought some time,"" her mother continued. ""But they'll regroup. Adapt. They always do.""

""Then we'll adapt too,"" Lily said firmly. ""Now we know it's possible to save people who've been partly taken over.""

Her mother caught her hand. ""At a price, Lily. Look at me—really look.""

Lily allowed her Sight to activate fully, ignoring the pain as her veins darkened. With her enhanced vision, she could see that her mother was different now—her life essence fragmented, pieces missing like a puzzle with gaps. Some of her tethers to the afterlife had been cut completely in the process.

""You're still you,"" Lily insisted.

""Parts of me,"" her mother corrected gently. ""Enough to know you. To love you. But I'll never be whole again."" She looked more carefully at Lily's face. ""And neither will you.""

Lily blinked, confused. ""What do you mean?""

Marcus moved closer, studying her with growing concern. ""Your eyes, Lily. They've changed.""

Lily touched her face, suddenly aware of a difference in her vision—not just the small blind spot in the shape of her mother's silhouette, but a shift in how she saw things. Colors seemed wrong somehow, depths inconsistent.

Her mother nodded sadly. ""The cutting took from you too. Connected you to something... beyond. That's the price of the power you used.""

Marcus cleared his throat. ""We should move while the entities are retreating. Get back to the Haven.""

Lily nodded, helping her mother to her feet. She swayed dangerously, leaning heavily on Lily's shoulder.

""Can you walk?"" Lily asked.

""I'll manage."" Her mother's voice was determined despite her weakness. ""I've been waiting three years for this. I won't fall now.""

They made their way slowly through the ruined school, Marcus limping ahead to check for dangers. As they passed the collapsed library, Lily paused, remembering the Untethered Woman's sacrifice.

""She knew you,"" Lily said softly. ""Mrs. Wilson. She led me to your journal.""

Her mother's eyes filled with tears. ""Karen... she was my best friend. She died trying to warn me about your father, about what he'd become. I never got to thank her.""

""She saved us tonight.""

""Then we honor her by using what we've learned."" Her mother's gaze became distant. ""There are others like me, Lily. People caught between, fighting every day to keep some piece of themselves. With your ability, you might be able to help them.""

Outside, the night was eerily quiet. The entity migration had retreated to the deeper woods, giving them a clear path back to the Haven. Dawn was approaching, the eastern sky lightening to pearl gray.

As they walked, Lily felt something different in her vision—a small but persistent blank spot, roughly the shape of her mother's silhouette. A permanent reminder of this night, perhaps. A wound that would never fully heal.

Marcus noticed her squinting. ""What is it?""

""Nothing,"" Lily lied. Some burdens didn't need to be shared.

They reached the Haven perimeter as the first rays of sunlight crested the horizon. Guards spotted them and raised the alarm. Within minutes, Commander Hawthorne herself was at the gate, face tight with anger and relief.

""You three have a lot of explaining to do,"" she said by way of greeting, but her expression softened when she saw their condition.

""We've made a discovery,"" Marcus told her. ""Something that changes everything we thought we knew about entities and consumption.""

""Later,"" Hawthorne ordered. ""Medical first.""

As they were escorted toward the infirmary, Lily felt Maya's arms wrap around her in a fierce hug.

""You absolute idiot,"" Maya whispered, voice thick with emotion. ""I thought you were dead.""

""Almost was,"" Lily admitted.

Maya pulled back, noticing Lily's mother for the first time. Her eyes widened in shock. ""Is that—""

""It's complicated,"" Lily said. ""But yes, it's really her. Part of her, anyway.""

Later, after wounds had been treated and explanations attempted, Lily sat beside her mother's bed in the isolation ward. Commander Hawthorne had insisted on quarantine until they could be certain the entity was truly gone.

""Will you be able to stay awake?"" Lily asked. Her mother had been drifting in and out of consciousness, the strain of severance taking its toll.

""For a while."" Her mother's smile was tired but genuine. ""There's so much I want to know about your life. These past three years.""

""We have time for that now,"" Lily said, though something in her heart whispered that nothing was certain anymore.

Her mother's expression grew serious. ""The journal contains everything I learned while fighting it. About their plans, their weaknesses. About how they're changing."" She reached for Lily's hand. ""They're afraid of you—of what you can do. That's why they targeted you specifically.""

""Me? Why?""

""Because Seers like you might be the only hope of saving what's left of humanity."" Her mother's eyes began to drift closed despite her efforts. ""They're planning something worse than consumption, Lily. Something they call 'the Great Merging.' You have to stop them.""

She fell asleep then, exhaustion claiming her. Lily sat watching the rise and fall of her mother's chest, the journal heavy in her lap. Outside the window, she could see Haven residents going about their daily tasks, unaware of how the world had changed again overnight.

Maya appeared in the doorway, holding two cups of coffee. ""Thought you could use this.""

""Thanks."" Lily accepted the cup gratefully.

Maya settled into the chair beside her. ""So... what happens now?""

Lily looked down at the journal, then at her sleeping mother, then out at the Haven—the last fortress of humanity in a world being consumed by things that should not exist.

""Now we fight back,"" she said quietly. ""Now we save everyone we can.""

As she spoke, she felt the cold spread through her veins again, but differently this time—not just the Sight activating, but something new. The power she'd discovered when connecting with her mother's broken consciousness. She raised her hand, watching the dark veins appear beneath her skin, but now streaked with threads of light.

In the glass of the window, her reflection showed eyes that were no longer simply black, but shot through with ribbons of light. Change, adaptation—just as her mother had said.

Maya noticed and reached for her hand. ""Your eyes...""

""I know."" Lily squeezed her friend's hand, then let go. ""It's what we become to survive.""

Outside, the sun climbed higher, illuminating a world forever changed. And in her mind, Lily could feel new connections forming—to her mother, to Marcus, to the Untethered, to all the broken souls caught between worlds. A web of light pushing back against the darkness.

She touched the persistent blind spot in her vision, a permanent reminder of what had been lost and what had been gained. Some wounds never heal completely. Some changes can't be undone. But as long as she could see both the darkness and the light, there was still hope.

""We adapt,"" she whispered to herself. ""We fight. We survive.""

And somewhere beyond the Haven's walls, the entities were adapting too, preparing for what would come next.",1,1741992727.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
