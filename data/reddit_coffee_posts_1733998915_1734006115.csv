1hcjtu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hcjtu3/during_my_wifes_pregnancy_i_m31_gained_130lbs_in/,"During my wife’s pregnancy, I (M31) gained 130lbs in 9+ months, all in my belly—now stuck with a 67” gut, looking overdue w/ quadruplets. Doctors say it’s the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome, or ‘sympathetic pregnancy’ they’ve ever seen. How to prepare for seeing family and our twins’ arrival?","Hi everyone, I’ve been dealing with this extremely bizarre and surreal situation over the past year, and I could really use some advice. With the holidays approaching and the twins’ arrival getting closer, I’m trying to mentally and physically prepare for what’s ahead—whether that’s navigating family reactions over Christmas or figuring out how I can be the best partner to my wife once the babies arrive, even with my current size and challenges. If anyone has thoughts or suggestions, I’d appreciate it.

I never thought I’d be writing this, but after what’s happened to my body over the past 9+ months, I feel like I’m living in a surreal medical case study. My wife and I (both 31) are expecting our first children—twins!—and her pregnancy has been going as smoothly as possible. But for me, things took a very bizarre turn. Early in her pregnancy, I began experiencing symptoms of what’s called Couvade Syndrome, or “sympathetic pregnancy,” where men mimic some of their partner’s pregnancy symptoms. At first, it was funny—me complaining about morning nausea and intense cravings while my wife teased me for being dramatic. But as the weeks went on, the symptoms became extreme.

Within 9+ months, I’ve gained over 130 pounds, and it’s all gone to my belly.  Doctors have tested me for every possible condition—Cushing’s syndrome, hypothyroidism, ascites, insulin resistance, and a laundry list of rare disorders. They ran metabolic panels, hormone tests, and even MRIs to rule out anything that could explain this transformation. Everything came back normal. After countless appointments with endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, and dietitians, the consensus is unanimous: this is the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome they’ve ever seen. My body has gone into a hyper-sympathetic state, mimicking my wife’s pregnancy so intensely that I now look more pregnant than she does.

Here’s the wildest part: my belly has grown to an unbelievable 67+ inches in circumference. It’s perfectly round, heavy, and tight—so much so that doctors have compared it to an overdue pregnancy with triplets or even quadruplets. I’ve been experiencing cravings, hormonal changes, and even bizarre moments of arousal that have made this entire experience surreal and difficult to process.

The public’s stares reactions to me have been nothing short of overwhelming. Everywhere I go, people treat me like a walking sideshow attraction. Strangers constantly stop me on the street to ask, “When are you due?” or “Are you having twins—or is it triplets?” Sometimes, people assume I’m joking when I say I’m not pregnant or assure them that my belly is real, even, and not a costume. One particularly embarrassing encounter happened when a man followed me in his car, yelling “Hey, heifer! How’d you get so huge, fatass!” and filming me as I struggled to walk. He kept shouting out the window, “When are the babies due?” and even taunted me to run, laughing as I awkwardly waddled down the street. 

Another time, a homeless man trailed me for blocks, loudly asking, “Are you sick? What happened to you? You can still fix this. You look like you’re about to pop!” His comments drew stares from others, and the whole experience left me humiliated. Once, at a grocery store, I reached for something on a high shelf, and the movement caused my shirt to ride up, exposing my belly. A woman nearby loudly gasped and asked if I was okay, or pregnant, and when I assured her I wasn’t pregnant, she looked me up and down in disbelief before walking away, shaking her head.  Thankfully, some guys are entertained or supportive, and say things like “Damn, bro, that’s the most impressive belly I’ve ever seen. Take care of yourself. That’s crazy.”

Our small town caught wind of what was happening to me and even ran a story in the local paper. They did a photo shoot with me and my wife, documenting what they called “the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome on record.” The article focused on the medical mystery and included photos of me standing next to my wife, both of us cradling our bellies. At one point, they measured my stomach circumference on camera, which was mortifying. The reporter joked that I looked more overdue than my wife, and the whole experience left me red-faced, especially when people in town started recognizing me from the article and stopping me to ask questions.

Family and friends have been equally baffled. My wife’s parents were initially concerned and suggested I get immediate medical attention, while my own family didn’t believe it at first and thought I was exaggerating. Now, it’s become a mix of humor and genuine concern. Even at work, my coworkers started a playful due date countdown for me, marking it on the office calendar alongside my wife’s.

Despite the jokes, I feel terrible that my transformation has overshadowed my wife’s pregnancy. What should have been a time focused on her and the excitement of our twins has turned into a community spectacle about my bizarre condition. She’s been incredibly supportive and laughs it off, joking that I’m taking some of the heat off her by becoming the bigger attraction. But I can’t help feeling guilty—this was supposed to be her moment, and instead, I’m the one everyone’s talking about.

Meanwhile, I’ve struggled to maintain a sense of normalcy. My shirts don’t fit anymore, riding up over my belly and exposing the lower half every time I move. I’ve tried buying larger sizes, but even those don’t last long before I outgrow them. Just the other day, I bent down to tie my shoe at work, and the strain caused a button to pop off my shirt, shooting across the office like a missile. Everyone heard it, and I had to awkwardly laugh it off while turning red. Another time, I stretched to grab something at a 711, and the seam of my shirt tore open right down the side, leaving me scrambling to cover myself. My pants aren’t any better—they’re so tight under the curve of my gut that I’ve split the seams more times than I care to admit.

At work, I’m required to wear a uniform—a button-up shirt, no less—and squeezing into it has become a nightmare. The buttons pull so tight that I’m sure they’ll pop, and they often do—sometimes in front of coworkers or even clients, which is humiliating. I’ve started bringing safety pins to hold my shirts together in emergencies, but even those can barely contain the strain. Each week, I’m outgrowing something else, to the point where I’m running out of options entirely.

Getting dressed in the morning has become a daily battle. Pulling my pants up under the massive curve of my belly feels like trying to fit into a sausage casing. The waistband digs into me so tightly that it makes my gut stick out even more, exaggerating its size and making me look even more absurdly pregnant. My belt creaks and groans whenever I sit down, and I constantly worry it’s going to snap. Even sitting in a chair has become a spectacle; I have to ease myself down slowly to avoid bursting buttons or causing the furniture to creak under my weight.

Movement is an entirely different challenge. I can barely bend over to tie my shoes without my belly pressing hard against my thighs, forcing me to hold my breath just to reach the laces. I’ve started wearing slip-ons to avoid the embarrassment. Getting in and out of my car is another ordeal—it feels like I’m wedging myself into a tight space, my belly brushing against the steering wheel no matter how far back I push the seat. Walking down the street, my belly bounces and jiggles with every step, drawing stares from passersby. Sometimes, I even catch people filming me.

Everyday tasks that used to be simple now feel monumental, and I’ve stopped pretending I can blend in. Despite my best efforts to maintain normalcy, my transformation has made me impossible to ignore.

Doctors have been fascinated by my condition, describing me as a medical anomaly. They’ve even suggested publishing my case in a medical journal, as they’ve never seen anything like it. While I understand their excitement from a scientific perspective, it’s hard not to feel like a sideshow. I’ve been poked, prodded, and measured so many times that I’ve lost count.

As for other symptoms/side effects, there’s a lot more to this experience than just the abdominal growth. Early on, we thought it was kind of adorable how in sync my wife and I were during her pregnancy. I’d wake up nauseous when she did, I’d have random cravings, and we joked about how empathetic I was being when I’d have morning sickness. But as things progressed, it became clear this wasn’t just harmless sympathy symptoms. My body’s hormonal changes went into overdrive. Alongside the weight gain, I’ve dealt with intense mood swings, exhaustion, and an unsettling sensitivity to smells. Even little things, like the scent of strong coffee, can send me running for fresh air.  The exhaustion hasn’t helped with me also not being very active during this time. 

Unlike my wife, I’m not growing two babies, so everything I eat is turning directly into fat, and unfortunately, it’s all going straight to my belly. The uncontrollable cravings have been a big part of this. I naturally eat more than her as it is, but the hormonal changes I’ve been experiencing—like elevated prolactin and cortisol levels—have completely derailed any sense of self-control. It’s as if my body is craving the transformation itself. There have been times I’ve gone on insane binges, eating until I physically couldn’t anymore… Even when I wanted to stop, it felt impossible, I was still hungry, like my body was demanding more fuel to keep growing.

Doctors think my body is in a kind of “hyper-storage mode,” where every calorie is being stored as fat, specifically in my abdomen, almost as if it’s mimicking a pregnancy. Some specialists believe my fat cells in this area might have become overly sensitive to insulin, leading to the rapid, disproportionate fat accumulation. Others suggest that elevated prolactin levels, typically associated with lactation and maternal behaviors, might be affecting how my body stores fat and retains fluid. Combined with some fluid retention in my belly, it’s created this bizarre, ballooning effect that feels completely out of my control. It’s crazy to outgrow a shirt in a matter of a couple weeks. 

One of the more difficult—and frankly embarrassing—symptoms has been this bizarre hormonal arousal.  Sorry if it is TMI to share all of this, but it’s such a large part of the psychological side effects I’ve been dealing with that it would be hard not to include it. My doctors have explained that the surges of prolactin, cortisol, and other pregnancy-related hormones in my system seem to be “confusing” my body, tricking it into thinking this transformation is something I’m meant to desire or enjoy. It’s almost as though my body is trying to gaslight me into embracing the changes so it can continue expanding. They’ve told me that this is likely part of a feedback loop—my body experiences embarrassment or awkwardness from how big I’ve gotten and the trouble I have maneuvering or drawing attention, and that stress triggers a hormonal response that leads to an unexpected surge of arousal. That sensation then clouds my judgment, making me crave situations where I feel even more self-conscious, which leads to choices—like overeating or not avoiding tight clothes—that exacerbate the growth.

This feedback loop is one of the hardest aspects to navigate. It’s created a cycle where I feel like I’m feeding into my own situation, literally and figuratively. The arousal itself feels like my body’s way of pushing me to keep going, even though I logically don’t want to get bigger or draw more attention. And yet, I’ve found myself leaning into these situations, almost unconsciously seeking out moments that leave me even more embarrassed or humiliated. It’s such a strange and difficult headspace to be in because I know it’s my hormones playing tricks on me, but in the moment, it’s hard to fight against. The doctors are optimistic that these reactions should subside once my wife gives birth and my hormones stabilize, but until then, I’m doing my best to stay mindful and not let this cycle get even more out of control.

At the end of the day, I’m still at a loss. My body feels alien to me, and every day brings new challenges. I’ve started wondering if this condition will reverse after my wife gives birth—or if this is something I’ll be living with for the rest of my life.

Now that you’ve read all that, you can probably imagine how overwhelming this has been—not just for me, but for my wife and our family as well. Christmas is coming up, and it’ll be the first time many family members see me in person since this transformation. I know they’re already shocked by the photos, but I have no idea how to handle their reactions when I walk in the room. Do you think I should try to diffuse the awkwardness with humor, or just brace myself for the comments and move on? I’d love to hear how you think I can prepare for that emotionally.

Also, with the twins on the way, I’m worried about how I’ll physically keep up with helping my wife care for two newborns. Even simple tasks like getting up quickly or bending over are incredibly difficult now, and I don’t want her to feel like she’s doing everything on her own. Has anyone here dealt with physical limitations while caring for babies? What are some ways I can make sure I’m still present and helpful despite my size and lack of mobility?

Finally, I’d be curious to hear if you’ve ever come across a case like this, or if you have any ideas I haven’t thought of about how to better manage the reactions, logistics, or even just the emotional toll. Thanks for reading and for any advice you can offer!

1hcjs7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1hcjs7o/does_she_like_me_i_cant_read_body_language_well/,Does she like me? (I can’t read body language well enough),"To make a long story short,

I am a contractor/technician, my office is my vehicle, and I report to multiple different sites on a daily basis, usually four or five different companies.

On this particular call, the receptionist girl would not vacate my presence like normally, even though she most likely had responsibilities herself, I didn’t care though I’m not a tattletale, because honestly, she is exactly my type, told me that she is only a couple months off from my actual birthday, so we are in essence, the same age. 

Needless to say, I could not let the opportunities pass by, so I asked her out for coffee, after she explained her favorite coffee shop was right down the road, and I asked this in the most appropriate way I could given that I was on my own clock and retain a strong sense of professionalism… even though nobody is watching over me directly. 

The conversation went like this: 
Me: A simple “how’s your day so far* with a smile, I was a bit smitten, blushing perhaps, no mirror to confirm.

Her “I love this one coffee shop down the street, it’s to die for” (something like that), 

Me: “I’ve never been there, but it sounds amazing, and it seems like you would be the one to show me around, which I would definitely not be opposed to… I hope that I’m not being too forward, but here are my contact details *hand her my friend/non-business, and regular for-business card* 

She gladly accepted my invitation, saying yes, and she seemed very happy, pupils dilated, totally not the type of girl either to do drugs, so that was natural endorphins, causing the dilation, I over analyze because I’m on the spectrum, which makes me extremely good at what I do for my work, but extremely bad at picking up on body language, I am much better at making friends with machines. Let’s just say that, I’m a repairman of the highest caliber. She still didn’t leave, just for one second because her boss needed something and then she came right back, essentially just watching and learning, huge smile on her face, she was blushing, unless it was makeup- indicating that she does enjoy my presence from my own viewpoint.

I have never been able to instinctually tell if somebody has an interest in me, so based on what I’ve described here, do you think that I was unprofessional which I definitely think is a possibility, or do you think that I was handling it in the most professional way I could? Or somewhere in between? 

I really do know how to communicate corporate style, because it is essentially a language, you learn over time by working different jobs. As far as dating language, 

It’s pretty much like my mind never developed to that instinctual ability, so in order to compensate, I have to over analyze any kind of situation like this. In the past, it has been like this too, I end up liking girls that actually hate me, and the girls that actually do like me, I can’t tell at all, my Spidey sense is missing in that regard, so what can one do? Think think think. Do you think she likes me, or just has a bubbly personality that I’ve never quite encountered before?

1hcjrv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ezraklein/comments/1hcjrv4/why_chris_wrays_resignation_is_actually_bad_news/,Why Chris Wray’s resignation is actually bad news for Kash Patel,"There’s a lot of gnashing of teeth going on about Chris Wray’s announcement that he plans to resign at the end of Biden’s term. I think that consternation is misguided, and he is actually fucking over Kash Patel and Trump by resigning, rather than rolling over for them as everyone is claiming. 

I think it’s gotta be a given that the Republican Senate has to take at least one scalp out of the motley crew that Trump is nominating to Senate confirmed positions. Since our society has the memory of a goldfish, Matt Gaetz isn’t gonna count as that scalp, and Pete Hegseth looks like he’s been dosing their coffee with Love Potion No. 9 and may manage to squeak through somehow. This would put Kash Patel, IMO, at the top (bottom?) of the scalp-taking pecking order (Kennedy and Gabbard are both too high-profile for them to shoot down; Patel is an anonymous gremlin in comparison).

Were Wray to remain in office, Patel could be appointed to a non-confirmed position in the FBI, and when he is eventually fired and Patel’s nomination is rejected by the Senate, Trump could simply appoint him “acting” FBI director under the Federal Vacancies Act. However that provision requires that Patel be serving in the agency to which he is being appointed head of for 90 days before the vacancy exists.

By resigning before Patel is given a position in the FBI, Wray is going to require Trump to nominate Kash Patel to the Senate, see that nomination rejected, then nominate someone else who can get confirmed, then hire Patel to a lower level FBI role, then fire the guy he just got confirmed, and only then be able to appoint Patel as acting director.

When i tell you the level of quality and amount of info and rituals that's been put into it ( honestly for any kind of problem, from money, career, grades, love, break ups, beauty, hexes , cleanses, success, opportunity, mind manipulation etc etc) is insane. They are definately undercharging. People charge 3000 on tik tok for one spell with no guarantees, the celebrity witch club charges 60 a month ( basic membership) for hundreds of spells that have been tested by 100s of people inside the club plus the owners post only those rituals they have done and tested themselves. (Keep in mind that the club is famous in the entertainment industry, many members are models, bigger you tubers etc) I have even sent the owner an email saying she majorly under values her work as she has 1000s reviews and needs to charge more  (if anybody thinks the reviews are not real u need your head checked and ur tin foil hat removed as to create 1000s of reviews u need 100s of sim cards,ig allows 5 accounts or so per one phone, so to create 1000s of reviews u need to have no life, 1000s of ig accounts, 100s of phones lol and a level 10 of psychopathy to create full blown conversations d a i l y and then post them all 10 times a day for years.

It was bad, i was in a bad spot, it was horrible. I started by doing her cleanses, and when i tell you it was life changing i will not be lying. Within DAYS the depression lifted, i started waking up with joy just because the sky was blue , i started going on long walks just breathing when before i would only venture out if needed. I became more peaceful so to speak within myself. Then i concentrated on removing blocks whatever was holding me in that shitty life style and did a few luck spells.

I started as a journalist at Alabama Public Radio in Tuscaloosa where my basic function was to roam Alabama with my Marantz tape recorder and find untold stories to share with our listeners. I tried to cover everything and everyone, including natural disasters, politics, executions, the environment and civil rights ... and even sports on occasion. When I moved to Huntsville to work at WLRH as a Director and GM, a whole new set of unexpected adventures began, and are now coming to an end. Public radio is not NPR or some sort of liberal propaganda machine. It's an idea where a group of your neighbors will work together to share content that reflects your community in a way that informs and inspires. And it's a constant waterfall of unseen challenges that, hopefully, the listener never notices. I love talking about public radio and will answer anything you ask the best that I can. I don't mind cussing, as long as we aren't cussing at each other. I prefer things to be somewhat of a free-for-all, so I hope to hear some wild, thoughtful questions about how the public radio universe works. Thanks to everyone who took part in my accidental AMA that happened when I first joined Reddit. Let's do it again on December 20th, which is the same day as the WLRH Pledge Drive. I may even answer some of the best questions on the air. I'm an early riser, so I'll start responding as soon as I roll out of bed and get some coffee in me. Hope to hear from you.

So i just want to make a thread and collect information on

# Things that cost a LOT more than expected (or just in general)

And in no particular order - i'll start:

1. **Instant coffee powder mix.** For some reason the regular coffe powder costs 0.20 a piece, while the instant costs *1.56* and considering you can get stacks of em and they weigh virtually nothing - it's an easy grab and sell 
2. **Tampons and other assorted pads.** You can make *quite a lot* of cotton balls with 'em, but that's about it. They're a pretty good sell
3. **Betavoltaic cells:** ""Wha?"" you may ask, but this is really a mid-late game item. Once you figure out that they're found in ***basically every centrifuge by the dozens*** *and sell for* ***75$ a piece*** *-* it can easily become your main income, 

So i'll visit this thread every so often and update it if i find something interesting (and if i don't get overwhelmed), but if the thread isn't pinned then most likely the list will be forgotten afterwards.

So please - share your current items for sale! (Please, i'm very desperate for money in game)",4,1734005170.0,cataclysmdda,2,1.0,False

1hcjnfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/comments/1hcjnfq/it_should_be_illegal_to_advertise_caffeine_to/,It should be illegal to advertise caffeine to children. ,"

To be clear: I am not suggesting that we should ban selling caffeine to children. If a kid wants to buy a cup of coffee, a can of energy drink, or a caffeinated milkshake, they should be allowed to do that without being carded. 

The problem is that kids are impressionable, and they’re surrounded by advertisements for caffeine. The Starbucks unicorn latte, the Coca Cola Santa Claus commercials, and the Red Bull cartoon commercials are just a few of the many caffeine advertisements targeted at kids. 

Pediatricians recommend no more than 100 mg of caffeine per day for teens, and no caffeine for children under 12.  https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx

Caffeine is physically addictive. An 8 year old who starts drinking a can of Coca Cola (32 mg) every other day could easily turn into a teenager who needs a Monster Energy Drink (160 mg) every day to avoid a headache.

You know that moment when you look at your spouse across the living room, surrounded by toys, maybe some cheerios on the floor, and both of you just share that knowing smile? That's what being married with kids is all about!

I've been thinking lately about how different our marriage looks now compared to our pre-kids days. Remember those? When date night meant spontaneous dinner plans instead of frantically texting the babysitter two weeks in advance? 😅

But here's the thing - watching my partner become a parent has made me fall in love in completely new ways. Like when they do silly voices during bedtime stories, or somehow manage to find that lost teddy bear at 2 AM.

Sure, we have less ""us time"" now, but we've found new ways to connect:

* Quick coffee dates while the kids are at school
* Couch cuddles after bedtime (if we can stay awake! 🥱)
* Tag-team parenting during weekend chaos
* Those precious 5-minute conversations while doing dishes together

Hi everyone, 


I am a male in my 30s, and I am from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, Britain (England). I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc. 


As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.  


In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).


I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.


Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me). 


In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

1hcjk5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/BGodInspired/comments/1hcjk5n/safe_haven_embracing_the_strangers_among_us/,Safe Haven: Embracing the Strangers Among Us,"https://bgodinspired.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/1734004227.png

**Devotional: Safe Haven: Embracing the Strangers Among Us**

**Scripture Reading: Matthew 25:35-40 (NIV)**  
“For I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger, and you invited me in… The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’”

**Reflection:**  
In a world that often feels divided and strained, the call to embrace the strangers among us is both timely and profound. The concept of a “Safe Haven” invites us to become a refuge for those who are marginalized, displaced, or simply in need of companionship. When we reflect on Jesus’ words in Matthew 25, we see His radical call to love and serve—not just those within our immediate circles, but also those who may seem foreign to us.

Strangers can come in many forms: refugees fleeing war-torn countries, immigrants seeking better opportunities, and even individuals within our communities who feel lonely or disconnected. Each encounter with someone different from ourselves is a divine opportunity to reflect Christ’s love and hospitality.

**Educating the Heart:**  
Embracing strangers is not merely a social obligation; it is a spiritual mandate and an invitation to bless others while enriching our own lives. Here are a few insights to consider:

1. **Understanding Our Common Humanity:** Every person we encounter is made in the image of God, possessing inherent dignity and worth. Acknowledging this truth can help us extend kindness and compassion.
2. **Active Listening:** Often, strangers bring stories and experiences that can teach us about resilience, hope, and faith. By listening actively, we create space for genuine connections.
3. **At the Table:** In Biblical times, sharing a meal was an act of fellowship. Consider how inviting a stranger to share a meal can break down barriers and build relationships.
4. **Stepping Outside Our Comfort Zones:** Embracing strangers means stepping into the unknown. This might challenge our perceptions, but it is often where we witness God’s work in the most profound ways.
5. **Acts of Service:** How can we practically demonstrate our commitment to being a Safe Haven? Volunteering, offering help, or simply greeting someone with warmth can make a significant impact.

**Prayer:**  
Heavenly Father, thank You for welcoming us into Your fold as Your beloved children. Help us to open our hearts and homes to strangers, mirroring Your grace and love. Lead us to those who need a Safe Haven and empower us to be instruments of Your peace. May we find joy in serving and learning from those who are different from us. In Jesus’ name, Amen.

**Encouragement for the Week:**  
This week, look for opportunities to engage with someone from a different background. Invite them to coffee, participate in community events that celebrate diversity, or volunteer for organizations that serve vulnerable populations. Remember, each encounter is an opportunity to embody Christ’s love in action, becoming a beacon of hope and safety for those around us. Let us rise to the challenge and create a world where all feel welcomed and loved.

1hcjcs1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Contrave/comments/1hcjcs1/dosage_and_side_effects/,Dosage and side effects,"Hi, 

just wanted to share some insights on my own experiences with contrave that some of you reported as well. Also been writing a lot more lately as an outlet for growth, greatly recommended. 

So, I started out with contrave this august to loose about 50 pounds long term. 
First week, one pill a day, worked like a charm. I was renovating the house - so I probably worked physically 10 hours a day. Lost 10 pounds in about 10 days. 
Probably some water in that number - but visible results. 
Side effects were minor - some headaches and constipation. But the calmness in me regarding food cravings and being satisfied - my god - it felt good. 

Week 2 adding to twice a day went well the first day. After that I started having trouble sleeping. Woke up at two in the morning and could not get back to sleep. 
This continued more or less the entire week. I am stubborn and do not give up easily and reading everything about this medication, it was obvious that this could be overgoing. 

Week 3 adding another pill in the morning - every side effect continued to show up together with more headaches and now I also started to get anxious and uneven. 

Week 4 adding the last pill, hoping for the side effects to go away and trying to get a hold of my doctor. I held out the week and a bit more but  then decided to quit. 

My heartrate was racing (+10-15 resting heart rate), could not sleep, anxiety and feeling uneven , headaches, constipation, moodyness. 

Reflecting on what has been written in this forum and reading up on other sites I got to a couple of reasons.

1. The period was stressful without the medication - renovating a house, starting a couple of companies, getting a dog. Seems to have been reinforced by the medication. 
2. I did intermittent fasting - starting the day out on empty stomach with full dose together with coffee is not recommended. triggered anxiety. 
3. Took the medication too late at 9 in the evening. Did not go well with sleep. 
4. Ramping up according to schedule no matter what - a more reasonable way would be to call the doctor sooner. 

So, I stopped for a while, restarted with one in the morning for a couple of weeks. Did not get back to the feeling from the first time but some effect. Took it with breakfast at about 0630. Seems like the effect wore off during the day because at night I would get cravings again. 

Added a second pill at about 4 in the afternoon and WOW! What a difference. I have not felt this good in a long time. I eat controlled and very reasonably, three times a day (not to late) and the pounds are starting to go away again. I sleep very well and only have some minor headaches and constipation. I use glucomannan which is fiber for the constipation which also adds to the satiety. Have not worked out lately because of a surgery - just some walks with the dog - however to me weight loss at my age and office work is above 80% energy intake. I have done vlcd and keto before - and this last week i have had that supergood ketosis feeling without starving. 

All in all - it seems that these meds can work for me this way. They will last twice as long per box if this continues so it is not really a problem. 

I hope these insights can help someone else here and I wish you all the strength needed to succeed with your goals (or at least close enough - think 80/20).

Coffee makes me v happy. I need a cup of coffee in the mornings and in the evenings and sometimes in between too just to keep me going and wake me up. But recently, I've noticed that after a cup of coffee, I get extremely anxious and jittery and it leaves me feeling off and anxious through the day. I still can't quit though. 

I don't see another option apart from quitting it so I'm looking to switch to other alternatives, preferably something that still gives me the same kick as coffee does but without the anxiety (?) asking for too much? Maybe, but I'd like to give it a shot :)

1hcj96t,https://www.reddit.com/r/nihilism/comments/1hcj96t/an_ideological_barrier/,An Ideological Barrier,"Once upon a time in a small rural town, there lived a farmer and his wife. One day, looking a bit flustered and red in the face, the wife confessed a dream to her husband. She hoped to one day host a peace conference in the town hall. “What?” the farmer asked, suspecting his wife, Doris, had finally been driven insane by the unchanging scenes of country life. “I’ve just always wanted to do it. In the town hall! It’ll be fun making the poster. And it can go up on the pub notice board.” Bill didn’t reply. But Doris hadn’t expected him to give her any enthusiasm. Nor had she been in need of it. Often people just feel better announcing their intentions before they do something odd. As if giving the world fair warning made it easier to die on a strange hill. Once the poster was finished, it was hung from only two pins. They poked through the top corners of the large piece of paper, and into the pub notice board. It was a glittery poster. Earnest and self-aware. “Local Peace Conference” it read in hand drawn bubble writing (which was very neat so it didn’t look childish.) Doris had darted up to the notice board, and back to her distant table about as quickly as she could. Only slowing for a moment to make sure the poster wasn’t on an angle; she hadn’t thought to pierce a third or fourth pin through the two bottom corners of her creation. Whenever a nearby door opened or closed, the poster fluttered daintily in the breeze. It looked like a performer, vulnerable on stage for the first time. A lesbian couple seemed to be making note of the poster’s debut. They’d bought a nearby pumpkin farm about half a decade ago — new comers by the little town’s standards — and hadn’t once read a single thing on the notice board which interested them. They were Doris’ biggest fans by the looks of things. That is, except for Bill’s friends who for some reason, were extremely curious about the event. They had more questions than anyone else. A few of the men even promised to attend.

Doris’ nerves reached all new heights as the day neared. Barely discernible flu symptoms started threatening to flare up in her chest and throat. She kept telling Bill that maybe they should call it off because she didn’t want anyone to catch something. Disinterested, Bill said she should call it off if she wanted to call it off. She didn’t. The conference went ahead, and for whatever reason Doris didn’t get sick either. On the night, the hall was empty except for the two pumpkin farmers, a few of Bill’s friends, and Bill. The lads were all in tight black singlets and had pot-bellies, resemblant of pregnancy bulges, but caused entirely by excess beer consumption. Their singlets had been meticulously tucked, over their round stomachs, and into remarkably high cut, black or navy shorts. The town was in a small farming nation towards the bottom of the pacific, and these revealing shorts were traditional attire. From there, their mostly bare legs plunged into several pairs of gumboots. By the town’s standards the lesbians were dressed up nicely. This meant they were in woollen jerseys, and frayed denim skirts. To be fair, they almost always wore woollen throw overs unless it was hot. But on this occasion each had worn their best one. There wasn’t a single hole in either piece of knitwear nor any large clumps of dirt hanging onto the fibres. The two women, however, kept glancing over at a plate of sausage rolls which Doris had put out. As their eyes darted from the platter to their host, and back again, their lips remained tightly pursed the whole time. But the corners of their mouths wrenched upwards and downwards. Smiling a little when they met Doris’ eye, but always grimacing as they caught site of the strictly non-vegan nibbles.

At around quarter to eight, Doris stepped up behind the podium and cleared her throat. A moment later this registered with Bill who hurriedly nudged all his mates to quiet down. The two women finally tore their eyes away from the sausage rolls but made a final stand on the matter by doing so in a very drawn out way. They wanted to make sure Doris saw that they had been looking at the sausage rolls and let their eyes linger on them until the absolute last possible moment. To clarify, they weren’t allowing the evident catering mishap to ruin the evening entirely. But just wanted to offer some non-verbal hints towards improving any subsequent meetings. When it came down to it, this meeting was a breath of fresh air for the lesbians. The couple had, unsurprisingly, found the townsfolk quite backwards since they’d bought their pumpkin farm. It was actually only their meatless diet which caused any real controversy, and hence they weren’t necessarily being over-sensitive. The food put out that night was symbolic of a greater issue. Meanwhile Doris was completely oblivious to the attention being directed toward the pastries. In reality they hadn’t possessed any significance whatsoever, she’d just been in a mad rush to get any kind of snack out. There wasn’t even a full pack of sausage rolls on the table, she’d just retrieved whatever remained from the bottom of her freezer earlier that day. Doris had been standing alone since the meeting began, entirely lost in her head for the whole time. She actually had caught the flu, she realised. But must’ve subconsciously ignored the symptoms until now, preoccupied as she was with making sure the evening went smoothly. Her heart raced, and upper lip trembled. “Um,” she decreed. A little screech of feedback resounded through the speakers like royal trumpets. “Well I just thought, maybe there’s something that we could do for, um, world peace. Is there any way — and I only mean something small but — could we help stop any wars or something?” The room went quiet. Doris shifted uncomfortably in the completely unnecessary spotlight that had been turned on for some reason. Her dream was amounting to something ridiculous. The vegans even started to feel bad about the fuss they’d made, and blamed themselves entirely for what was happening. Gazing up towards the stage, their tender eyes shone with adoration, and it must be said, a fair amount of sympathy. If there were more people in the hall, then it’s unlikely the silence could have taken on a precise tone. Usually the preferences and thoughts of a crowd create a mottled atmosphere during silences. Neither energised, nor somber. Even funerals can feel strangely vague if enough people gather. In this case however, there were only eight people in the room, and the mood was completely awkward, everyone could tell. There was certainly the possibility of organising a fundraiser. Of donating money to a charity providing medical aid in a war zone. But actually incentivising that war conclude earlier than it otherwise might? Well that was certainly a little tougher than this morning’s crossword had been. Maybe it was on account of a train of thought similar to this one. Or maybe everyone present was just overwhelmed by shyness, but no one even found the idea of donations percolating into their thoughts. Everyone was completely stumped. Even Doris started to realise she’d come unprepared as far as actual solutions were concerned. Bill wondered to himself if this was how all peace conferences went. He stared at the floor as a barely discernible conflict played out in his eyes. Torn between the undeniably humorous sincerity of his wife, and the incomprehensible weight of everything bad that must be happening right this very moment. Not just the wars, but murders, abductions, beatings, sickness, and poverty. Was it psychologically possible or at all productive to contemplate these things? Well at the very least he was here in the town hall trying to figure that out. Slowly his friends started murmuring among themselves. To Doris’s ear these murmurs sounded like grumbles. The trembling of her lip returned; on the verge of tears now, her face started to screw in raisin like agony. Paralysed by awkwardness, the lesbians couldn’t think of a single way to bring about world peace either. But at the very least, they were outraged to hear what sounded like grumbling to them too. They started giving the chubby men a similar look to what the sausage rolls had been receiving earlier. Bill glanced up from the conversation noticing his wife, and the lesbians all watching them. He shook himself a little, and suddenly read the room with unprecedented intuition. Something needed to be done quick, for the sake of his marriage, and, well maybe even for the sake of world peace.

“Look I mean, we’ve been talking about it.” He said standing up, but looking back even as he did so hoping for support. “World peace is a pretty complicated thing… But we all do care about it. Don’t we?” The murmurs/grumbles crescendoed a little and rose in pitch. This seemed to signal an affirmative, but it wasn’t very convincing given world peace of all things was being discussed. Irritated with this weak response, Bill continued. “Well we do care about world peace, and… And we’ll all come a long next week as well!” The couple looked at each other surprised, and quietly started nodding as though they would also come next week. In perfect unison the grumbles then made a kind of noise like what a child might. When finding out that instead of going to a friend’s house, they were instead being served a giant pile of broccoli. Fortunately, Bill kicked one of his friends with his gumboot, and then they all seemed to give in to coming back next week. Doris looked stunned for a moment. At some point during Bill’s speech she’d fearfully retreated into her own train of thought, and was gazing off somewhere disassociated. “Oh, uh well” slowly what he’d said sunk in, and she noticed the lesbians were nodding. “Oh,” she half laughed, half gasped. “Oh!” More flustered gasping and then also a smile. “Well that would be lovely. And,” she made a point not to look anywhere in particular, “next time there’ll be some spinach and feta rolls too. For anyone that might want them.” Things started to round up, and Doris made her way down from the lectern to join the others. She didn’t quite know what had been the cause of her tears and heavy emotions on stage. But with no small amount of guilt, she had to concede it had not been on account of the world’s suffering at all. Nor had the vegan women’s outrage over the meat been fuelled by anything more than gossip amidst a peaceful town. The subject, which had been considered more deeply and varyingly during the meeting much than world peace or anything else, in the end turned out to be the sausage rolls. Because Bill and his friends had been distracted by the food all meeting too. The geezers now edged towards the savouries, trying to appear casual in their movements. When it came to snacks after any sort of town hall meeting, they’d learnt many times in the past. Never look desperate. Someone always notices and then thinks to announce that people can only have one sausage roll each. But furrowed brows gave away their seriousness. Doris rolled her eyes watching the imbecilic chubs stalk their limp prey, immediately reminding them of the hall etiquette. Gasps of agony and vexation were released, and several men even shook their fists at the sky. So often does the intellect project its anguish and existential dread into meaningless conquests… The weight of the world’s problems had been imposed on them by the conference so they were acting out of character. Ignoring this strange display, and misunderstanding its noble cause, Doris quickly offered to make the two women some tea or coffee.

Once they had all sat down together, the small group then enjoyed the first amicable conversation they’d ever had with each other. Although no one made a note of it — or really even understood it within themselves — a weight had briefly lifted off of each of them. Making it easier to talk, and to trust each other, all because Doris had been brave enough to do something out of the ordinary in a small town. She’d put up a poster in the pub, and called the eight of them together in the name of world peace. Each of them could feel it in their hearts. There wasn’t a soul in the hall that night looking to make enemies. It was this that made each of them feel lighter. For many years the group continued to meet every Sunday evening. More of the town started to come too. People started to realise that even if they did differ on many political matters, they were unified by the fact world peace was ultimately a good thing. Even if this fundamental issue had proved an impossible challenge for many of the world’s greatest thinkers, throughout most of human history, it still was a good occasion to get together. Perhaps for this reason alone, peace conferences weren’t a complete waste of time. They started to resent the world they used to know for being so divided! It was much better to be kind to people with different views even if they upset you at some level. For one thing, none of the group ever wanted the obligations of democracy to get in the way of their friendships ever again. They all vowed to never talk politics, and warmly encouraged each other into the voting booths each election. “I’m sure you’ll make the decision that’s best for you!” They’d say to each other, smiling. Ironically they became increasingly passionate about open-mindedness, and albeit they generally tried to be accepting to all kinds of people, they failed to notice actually they were beginning to despise the majority of people for not making a similar effort. Conference attendees refused to acknowledge this scornful attitude, even as it started to come up more of their conversations. Sometimes they would feel insulted if anyone tried to steer things away from the complaining, or worse defend people outside the group. For some reason, the vast majority of people find something traitorous in being self-aware of any flaws within their own community. The ubiquitous stance of nearly every single human being is that it’s much better to occupy yourself observing flaws in other people’s communities. A sense of superiority slowly accumulated in the group, unbeknownst to any of the members — unbeknownst as these kinds of feelings always must be, if they are to develop in the hearts of people claiming to be kind. 

This undetected arrogance, combined with the dangerously sweet aroma of unity which they had all been taking in for months now, soon stirred people into a frenzy. They became obsessed with creating a welcoming, wholesome environment like the first meeting. If everyone attending cared about world peace then politics could be set aside. And if you couldn’t stay cheerful with the people around you well then you mustn’t grasp just how amazing world peace would be if anyone ever figured out how to make it happen. People who weren’t accepting enough of each others’ differences received life-long bans from the group. Shortly after the bans came into affect, a few people who thought the life-long bans were a bit harsh also received life long bans. What really precipitated these bans however? It was simply that the prospect of conflict being a important confusing the group members. And confusion had none of the warmth in it which they were now addicted to. People would rather just get back to feeling nice and chummy with each other. Ethical complications could no longer be addressed, as the very thought of a complication became an immediate danger in and of itself to the preservation of the nice feeling. Having reached such a magnitude it rendered the comprehension of their own character flaws impossible, the group’s avoidant tendencies and escapism became indestructible. Everyone really believed they wanted to be accepting of all kinds of people, but only because they saw no sense in ever comparing these intentions to the actual actions in which they were all participating. It is from such a disparity that all self-deception is born. Within the fog of this delusion, a collective like this eventually reaches a boiling point. Two dangerous qualities gradually swell to a critical mass. A reproachful attitude towards the raising of objections, and isolation from people outside the community. Finally anyone cantankerous protest is made to feel unwelcome, and what is left behind is only a scared flock of sheep aimlessly following a collective nose which is controlled by no one. All supposed leaders within this nucleus of narrow mindedness lead in name only. The decisions they make are completely limited by the same fear of being cast out that plague those beneath them. This kind of unguided degradation is what befell the peace conference group. It was neither resisted or incited by any of the individuals, but emerged spontaneously out from the collective stupidity of the herd. World peace eventually became unquestionably associated with all the conference group’s other habits. Anyone who disliked one of many unrelated things, was instantly accused of not wanting world peace to come about ever.

Around this time the group begun making decisive efforts to isolate from the rest of society, eventually pooling in to build a new private meeting hall on Bill and Doris’ farm. They began to feel reproached by the rest of the town. And it was true, the remaining townsfolk were getting a bit uneasy. They had one fairly reasonable point which was that the peace conferences seemed to be turning into a cult. Some of the now exiled members also began making efforts to hold rival conferences back in the town hall. Half-heartedly they aimed to retrieve the original sentiment the group began with. It was obvious to them, that the light-hearted feeling brought on by contemplating world peace in a group setting, had been forgotten. The original group had become distracted from world peace as they sought the pleasant feeling generated by the meetings in and of itself. In doing so, they turned their sense of belonging into a commodity, which could be stolen by a disagreeing world. The new group of reformists thought bitterly about how the original one ought to have valued more the tenant of ‘minding your own business’ at all costs. Just let people get on with their lives! Support each other no matter what at a deeper level, and quit aiming for niceties and cheesy smiles all the time. The pressure to maintain a positive front at all times eventually get’s internalised as shame. People all become self-conscious simultaneously, which turns into a paranoia, and the only way to avert this imagined pressure off of oneself is to accuse the person next to you of doing something un-peaceful before they accuse you. The collective mistrust then cyclicly antagonises itself, and this pretentious mode of self-destruction infuriated the reformists. They vowed to demonstrate what open mindedness *really* looked like. Astoundingly none of these people noticed the light feeling never returned to them either.

It seemed as though that lighthearted feeling which had revealed itself most purely during the first ever meeting, was now completely gone. And there wasn’t a single bureaucratic ceremony the human mind could devise to methodically spark back up such flickers of joy. In this short, human life, you really just have to savour any rare moments of clarity which do haphazardly arise. And know those moments will leave when they’re ready. All the pious resolve in the world couldn’t recreate the humility which shone so purely from Doris’ pleasant little dream, and her arts and craft looking poster. For Bill, Doris and the rest of the original group, tensions between them and the town had long ago destroyed all the things the community stood for. The group was essentially an industrial effort to maintain a felt sense of harmony at all times. This peace factory didn’t work at all, but everyone who was a part of it had to remain silent or else they would be labelled as the reason why the factory had stopped working. As the years went by, both the old group, and the new group found their meetings completely filled with turmoil. Every Sunday, they came home physically exhausted because fear, anger, or even just anticipation, all involve a lot of bodily tension and convulsion. The revised meetings, and the original ones, became bad for everyone’s health. People even fell ill more often during the winters. Eventually Doris and Bill got busted by the cops for having half a tonne of homemade explosives in their hay shed. The vegan lesbians screamed with rage, and hurled pumpkins as the police cars carried Bill and Doris away. Eyes blurry with tears, the lesbians received four hundred dollars in fines. The equivalent value of ninety-two pumpkins (that is if you included the ones which smashed on the police car’s bonnet, otherwise the number was eighty-nine.) Soon after that, Doris and Bill’s farm and the meeting hall got sold, they’d be locked up for a long time. The arrests, gave the townspeople substantial evidence that peace conferences — especially ones that weren’t even peace conferences at all — were not to be tolerated. And this heat wasn’t entirely kept off the reformists who also had to stop meeting, but most of them were quietly relieved to give up their draining club anyway.

Remarkably, it only took a couple years after that for almost everything to return to normal. A few of the original group were now in prison, but otherwise the town was pretty much the same. All thanks to the resilience of small town communities. And the capacity for forgiveness they have no choice but to develop under such cramped circumstances. The only other difference was none of the townsfolk ever, under any circumstances, mentioned world peace. Everyone undoubtedly still approved of the notion itself, but it had become an extremely painful thing to talk about. That is until one day, a young man from the city found himself in the town’s pub. He sat alone chatting away on his phone with his friends who never strayed further from him than his pocket. The noticeboard was empty, so were all the tables. Except for some dark eyed women in jerseys who were tucked away into a booth, through in another room. And an old man dressed like a farmer but certainly nearing the end of career. The young traveller, still really just a boy around eighteen or so, was drawn somewhat reluctantly into conversation with the older man. He approached the boy laden with that unassuming small town chattiness which still hadn’t faded in the town, even after all those difficult cult years. The kid finally put his phone away when the other man offered him a beer. But still he proved a tough one to crack in conversation. Half-interested at best in answering any questions, and completely incapable of inquiring about anything himself. The old farmer paused in his chattering after a while, and stared wearily across at the boy. Considering whether to give up his conversation attempts, he was struck by that pang of embarrassment old timers sometimes get. They so easily become ashamed of coming across like forgotten cats. The kind which tirelessly seeks out being petted at the most inconvenient times, and irritates its owner. Across from him the boy’s darting eyes avoided eye contact with a habitual awkwardness common to his generation. What was puzzling was that, behind these anxious movements he still looked sedated somehow. There’s a kind of stiffness, and thousand yard stare which comes over people, if they ever notice a camera’s aimed at them. And kids these days all seemed constantly trapped in this state. The boy looked to meditating on an almost out of body visualisation of himself. Deadly focused on how every twitch of his face and posture might look to someone standing nearby. You could even tell by the way someone walked if they were caught up in this kind of contemplation, and the old man wondered how these kinds of young people didn’t end up walking into things all the time. Anyhow, he decided to make one last bid at peaking his unwilling drinking partner’s interests.

Gazing into his glass for a moment, he slowly summoned all the determination he’d need if he was going to tell such a difficult story well. If the kid was about to hear this crazy tale for the first time, he ought to hear an honest, well paced version of it. Nothing could be skipped over if it would leave the people involved misconstrued. Even those friends who had pushed the old man away over the last few years… He glanced around cautiously, and lowered his voice. “All right matey, I’ll leave ya’ be after one last story eh?” Smoothing his black singlet over the spherical mass of his stomach, and poking it back into his shorts with one hand, he continued. “I bet you look round this boring old place and reckon it’s got no good stories to tell. Nothing worth recounting to your mates anyhow.” The boy realised that he might’ve offended the man by looking disinterested. He sat up straighter, and began to concentrate more seriously. Guilt didn’t appear to be driving this new found focus however. More so the boy now appeared to be searching, with that same stiffness and distant air, for someway of resuscitating his likeable nature in the eyes of this stranger. His reputation paradoxically meant everything to him, even when it was in the hands of someone that meant nothing to him. With an audience of one eighteen year old who was trying to prove he was listening for no real reason, the old man began. He’d been there right from the start. Teasing Bill about his wife’s poster when it first hung just behind him on that notice board over by the door. It had been him who received the kick from the gumboot! That cursed kick, he claimed, is what eventually led him to attend the regular conferences. After that it was just one disaster after another. Albeit vacantly, the young man took in every word. The old man became more energised as his own speech further convinced him this was truly an epic tale. The boy would certainly do a double take after hearing this whenever he passed through a small town. Understanding many mysterious legends hide in unsuspecting places, and the world doesn’t all revolve around city life. The explosives were left out of the story but that was all. The old man still conceded things had gotten so serious people were in prison. And all because yet another lot of innocent fools felt the magical warmth. The glowing image of one’s fellow human out from behind every kind of ideological barrier. Right where you could finally embrace them. There’s nothing wrong with such an experience, it is beautiful, but so are a lot of things. Their mistake was thinking they understood the greater meaning of that special first meeting. Like it was a sign or foreshadowing good things to come. “I’ll tell you what, kid, that feeling of love destroyed more lives in this town than every bloody machine in *there* has combined.” The old timer stuck his arm out behind him without taking his now wild eyes off the boy. He was pointing straight through the door into where all the pokies were blinging away and flashing with all sorts of magnificent, alluring colours. The slot machines in the local pub were probably the most dazzling objects in the entire surrounding region. It was mostly just cows and grass for miles around, and casinos invest millions of dollars into making the pokies as visually striking as possible. “There’s a nice warm feeling I get putting twenty bucks into the pokies every weekend, and it hasn’t gotten me arrested for terrorism yet, not by a long shot! Same can’t be said about something so grand as peace or love. Got to enjoy the little things, horn, I’ll give ya that one for free.” (Horn was a local term of endearment.) Indeed sometimes the best things become the worst purely because of how powerfully they affect people. The worst things in life on the other hand, probably don’t benefit a person in any tangible way. But at least they do what they say on the tin. Everyone knows that the pokies are a waste of time and money, but they’re still fun anyway. Alcoholism too. People are well informed about how bad that is, even alcoholics are. But try and find one cult member who knows they’re hurtling off a cliff, and is excited to see where it goes anyway. They all think they’re doing something good. And that is what’s truely terrifying.

Towards the end of this long story the young man had started raising his eyebrows higher and higher. Really this was in anticipation of being freed from the conversation, and not at all to do with the increasing stakes the cult had faced as it neared collapse. In truth the story had almost no affect whatsoever on the young man, even though he’d seriously been listening. When the old man finally stopped talking, his company gave several exclamations, slowly shook his head in disbelief a few times, and even blew out a soft whistle. After that, he was sure he had prevented the retired farmer, who he would never see or think of again, from disliking him. He scurried nervously back to his room to lie on his bed, and go on his phone. Back in the pub the old man let out a long sigh which deflated his whole body. The nice feeling hadn’t meant anything and neither had his whole life. He’d thought there’d been something to learn from it all. As though getting sucked into a cult for a few years had been his calling and now he could warn the next generation not to do the same. But again, he’d just made that same mistake of thinking he knew the significance of his experiences. He couldn’t even learn from that mistake himself, let alone get some stupid boy to learn from it too. Even when people do discover something good and beautiful, they’re not observant enough to notice when it morphs slowly into something toxic.",1,1734003616.0,nihilism,0,1.0,False

Megan (fake name) was my coworker at my last job who assisted in training me since she sat in an adjacent cubicle. We became fast work acquaintances as I learned the ropes of our job. Over the course of the first year, we exchanged personal stories and advice. Six months into the job, my work schedule changed but I knew I wanted to still keep in contact, so I asked her if she wanted to get coffee or drinks on a day off. She obliged and we had a great time talking for hours. 

Since then, we’ve made arrangements on five separate occasions to hang out again, only for her to cancel the day of. Each time I’ve accepted her apology and since we communicate over text mainly, I think it’s hard for her to see that I’m bummed out when this happens. I’ve complained to my boyfriend, and he says I have more patience than him to keep maintaining this friendship.

I love Megan because we connect on a deep level. We’re at different points in our lives being five years apart in age but share the same sense of humor and values. Often times when we are at work, I will find an excuse to go over to her desk and catch up briefly. Note that it’s usually me that initiates this water cooler talk, and also the get together outside of work.

I’m wondering if I maybe rubbed her the wrong way in a past interaction but nothing stands out to me. I’m concerned that I did something offensive to her and she doesn’t bring it to my attention for whatever reason. If so, I guess this answers my question on why she’s cancelled on me so much.

I seem to be really invested in this friendship because I have a lack of close female friends from high school/ college that I keep in touch with. Most of my current friends are online and male (thanks to pandemic video gaming). I want a friendship that includes the girly things I don’t talk about with gaming buddies, however cliche it is.

Should I continue to pursue Megan (platonically lol) or should I let this friendship fizzle out? I need some insight from an unbiased third party, because I’ve already consulted with family.",0,1734003436.0,TwoXChromosomes,5,0.5,False

What separates the seen from the unseen? Most of the time, it’s the main picture. The main image of your product does more than show what it is; it’s also your quiet seller.

 It sets the tone immediately, makes the first impact, and says much about your brand in seconds. An exciting picture not only gets people’s attention but also builds trust, shows worth, and turns clicks into sales. 

The right main picture can make your listing stand out in a crowded market and turn casual viewers into loyal customers. If you’ve ever thought a picture wasn’t powerful enough, think again.

# The Impact of Main Listing Images on Amazon’s Search Algorithm

# Increasing the Click-Through Rate (CTR)

Amazon uses Click-through rate (CTR) as an important performance metric in analyzing your product’s relevance and attractiveness. A greater CTR indicates that your listing captures the interest of more customers, telling the algorithm that you have a [product worth promoting on Amazon](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-find-the-influencers-to-promote-your-amazon-product/). 

This is especially true for the main image, as it is typically the first item a shopper sees when browsing through search results. An attractive image can beat the competition and get clicks. 

Take, for example, a company that sells fitness trackers. It started with a generic photo that doesn’t get noticed. By changing to an image of its tracker being worn on a wrist while working out, it got a 30% uplift in CTR (see below).

 Likewise, a kitchenware brand got more engagement when it replaced a simple image of its knife set with a chef chopping vegetables. 

The examples above show that great [**listing images**](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-listing-optimization) on your main image can enhance CTR, which, through the rank and visibility of your product, can propel you forward on Amazon everyone.

 

# Enhancing Brand Perception

Your hero image directly reflects the way a shopper perceives your brand. A polished, professional image represents trust, reliability, and attention to detail. A low-quality or blurry photo can convey the opposite, making your product seem untrustworthy.

 Brand perception is everything in a competitive landscape where customers are spoilt for choice. For example, an individual [selling beauty products](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/selling-products-on-amazon-successfully/) went from amateur, low-resolution, dimly lit listing images to high-resolution/dimension/lighting that showed off their nice packaging.

 The boost in customer trust also resulted in conversions. For example, a sports equipment seller started with basic product photos, then used [listing images of their products](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-supercharge-amazon-ctr-for-your-unique-product-listings/) being used in a gym, appealing to the aspirational nature of fitness junkies. 

Quality [visuals enhance](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/harnessing-ai-for-stunning-product-visuals-enhancing-your-amazon-listings/) your brand image, increase trust, and make your product much more attractive to customers.

 

# Boosting Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

This means that the Amazon search algorithm favors listings with high metrics, such as clicking on a product and spending time on its product page. 

If your main image is well designed, it can affect these metrics by enticing shoppers to click on your listing and read the product details longer. 

A home décor merchant shared a picture of their coffee table in a complete design stage rather than just against a blank background to help customers visualize the product with their available space. It also meant that more time was spent on the page, causing more engagement. 

Likewise, a pet supply store had dogs and cats playing with its products, which added an emotional touch and invited shoppers to stay. 

These approaches show that eye candy draws clicks and improves SEO performance by making your product more available and legible in Amazon searches.

 

# The following are Compliance with Amazon Guidelines

To keep your [product listing](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/5-things-you-need-to-do-for-a-killer-amazon-product-listing/) active on the platform, you must follow Amazon’s stringent image guidelines. Failure to comply can result in a listing being suppressed, which is usually due to lost sales and a resulting drop in ranking. 

To meet Amazon’s requirements, it needs a pure white background, no text or logos, and should focus solely on the product. In one instance, a toy seller found their listing suppressed because their main image had a watermark. 

Once the image was modified to be consistent with Amazon’s required policy, the product became more visible and performed better in the search results.

 Likewise, one fashion retailer ditched the mannequin shots for pictures of living, breathing models, improving consumer confidence in the merchandise in line with Amazon’s adherence. 

Compliance means your listing will not be penalized, and your position in search results will not be affected, both of which are crucial for ongoing sales.

 

# Being Unique with Product Differentiation

With numerous brands in the market, unique selling points act as customer magnets, attracting customers’ attention and causing them to buy your product. 

Main Image: Your main image is a great opportunity to highlight your unique selling point, be it a new feature, a unique design, or an additional feature. As an example, a seller of coffee mugs showed a side-by-side of a standard mug next to theirs, highlighting its thickness and volume. 

By creating visual contrast, their product garnered more attention, which led to greater sales. In a lifestyle image, one backpack brand called out anti-theft features aimed at buyers whose primary concern was safety.

 

# Increasing Conversion Rates

An excellent main image not only persuades a passerby to click but also turns that click into a sale. The Amazon ranking algorithm favors listings with better conversion rates, so having a great main image can translate directly to more success. 

One gaming mouse company saw the non-repetitive text from the main image extolling its customizable buttons and ergonomic design [boost sales](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/what-are-some-current-ways-to-boost-sales-on-amazon-in-2024/) by 20%. Similarly, a skincare brand utilized the before-and-after carousel as its first image, which showcased the product’s efficacy, thereby gaining a potential buyer’s trust. 

Overall, these examples showcase the need to align better what your main image depicts alongside the product value proposition and product functionality/usage. Leading with a strong hero image eradicates indecision, establishes confidence, and activates shoppers to go through to complete their purchase.

 

# Encouraging Positive Reviews

The primary image sets expectations, and buyers are prone to leave a great review when their expectations are met or exceeded.

 Ensure customers can access clear, high-resolution listing images that showcase angles and details. This makes customers make informed decisions , decreasing risk of disappointment and ne[gative reviews.](http://www.inc.com/john-lincoln/if-you-sell-on-amazon-you-might-get-a-bad-review-here-is-how-to-handle-it.html) 

A shoe seller, for instance, has uploaded its shoe image showing different angles of the product in high resolution so that buyers can view the details before buying it. This level of transparency produced rave reviews.

 Similarly, a tech accessories brand showcased close-up photos of their phone case to convey clear expectations while providing some context, altering and reinforcing your expectations. 

Displaying your listing images correctly and attractively gives customers a reason to purchase. If they do, not only are the complaints and returns reduced, but the happy customers leave positive reviews, which helps earn your product credibility and boost Rank, too.

 

# Leveraging Seasonal Appeal

Modifying your top image according to seasonal trends or holidays will help you grab the attention of shoppers during driving periods. Using seasonal imagery targets emotions buyers might feel at the time of year and emphasizes the product’s relevance for a certain event type.

 Example: One of the most prominent changes made by a gift company is updating its hero image to one using holiday packaging during the month of December, which resulted in record sales. 

In another example, a sportswear brand incorporated warm backdrop details that showed how beach-friendly their products are to entice seasonal greenback shoppers. 

Adjust your listing images so that they match perfectly with the pace of the season. This will make your product appealing to shoppers at certain times of year or in line with what is trending. This will be a good driver of traffic and sales during important shopping periods.

 

# Gain Trust with Relevant Photos

Lifestyle photography lets shoppers picture themselves using your product, making it more real and enticing. These functional, scale, or style perspectives, added through contextual listing images, can be very convincing.

 For example, a mattress company posted a picture of its mattress in a nicely set-up bedroom so people could visualize it in their homes. Likewise, a camping shelter provider showcased its tent set up in nature, trying to attract the adventurous spirit. 

Contextual listing images like these help appeal to shoppers emotionally and lead to higher product purchases. When a potential buyer can see your product in action, you demonstrate its value and help build trust, which in turn converts more sales.

 

# Helping Cross-Selling Opportunities

The main image can also gently cross-sell complementary items and invite customers to peruse the rest of the catalog. By fulfilling multiple needs, this solution improves customer satisfaction and raises average order value. 

A cookware brand, for instance, put pots and matching kitchen utensils in the background so inspired shoppers would want to buy the whole set, just like the laptop seller who added a stylus and protective case to his photos, resulting in more bundle sales. 

Showcasing complementary products alongside your hero product can drive additional sales and entice shoppers to explore further offerings from your brand—as long as the co-packaged products do not distract from the hero item.

# How to Choose the Best Background for Your Amazon Main Image



# Put the Simple White Background for the Compliance

And rightly so; all main **listing images** on Amazon need to have a pure white background. This minimalist background cuts the clutter and helps your product’s colors, textures, and shapes shine. 

On top of that, a white background makes your listings look professional and ready with a polished look, which can help with your credibility and trustworthiness.

For example, a skincare label started using soft pink backgrounds consistent with its branding. That went against Amazon’s rules, and listings were suppressed. 

They went on to switch back to using a clean white background, and not only was the listing restored, but it also experienced a CTR and conversion boost because it looked smarter and more professional.

* Tip: You can use photo editing software (like Photoshop or Canva) to create a pure white background that meets Amazon requirements, but this may result in a low-quality image on your product.

 

# Place your Product in the Right Light

Because even simply using a white background, bad lighting, or wrong product placement can ruin your image. Proper lighting adds color and realism and brings your product to life to highlight its key features.

 Give attention to the product by strategically placing it where your eyes will gaze directly when you go shopping.

For example, a stainless steel knife kitchenware brand used bright studio lighting to capture the knives’ metallic lustre. The lighting itself also helps the product stand out—if a potential buyer is searching for something specific, it helps it pop out, which in turn makes it more alluring.

* Pro Tip: Use natural or studio lighting to avoid shadows and put the focus on textures, colors, and details that separate you from your competition.

 

Think About Adding Shadows or Reflections 

Simply adding a bit of shadow or reflection can make your product image look more three-dimensional and real while still being within Amazon guidelines and regulations. These effects add realism and make the product look like a real and professional product.

For example, a glassware seller has used a subtle image of the reflection of the wine glass on a white surface, adding an elegant, high-class touch to the photo. That simple refinement improved the product perception and proved beneficial with more clicks and more conversions.

* [Expert Tip](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/5-expert-tips-to-optimize-amazon-ppc-campaigns/): You can also lay down a gentle shadow or reflection to complement the product on an image editing software such as Adobe Photoshop, but make sure it appears realistic and does not steal attention from the product.

 

# Utilize Consistent Product Backgrounds

Using the same background for all your products helps create a branded look and feel. Shoppers seeing uniform backgrounds for different listings: Trustworthy, professional brands increase cross-selling and repeat purchases.

For example, a home decor [brand sells](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/sell-branded-products-on-amazon/) lamps and vases. Trust in the brand increased as the products they offered stayed the same, with the only difference being the white background, building repeat customers and an established market position.

* Tip: Use the same background, lighting, and photographs for every product in your catalog to [create listing images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/lessons-learned-after-creating-25000-amazon-listing-images/) that match up.

 

# Show Product Info with Zoom Strategy

If you zoom in on the product to show the details, it works on a white background. Since consumers spend on items based on the initial impression, they prefer transparency, and a close-up can highlight special characteristics, making your product a more appealing option.

A jewelry brand selling diamond rings used white background high-definition listing images to showcase the clarity and brilliance of the stones. This close-up imagery showed the product’s beautiful craftsmanship, which persuaded shoppers to buy it by providing them with a good feel.

* Tip: Use some listing images that show all product elements while balancing your zoom levels to avoid compromising crucial details.

 

# Do Not Over Complicate The Backdrop

When it comes to [Amazon’s main listing images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/is-it-time-to-up-your-amazmain-image-strategyon/), simplicity reigns. In trying to stand out, sellers often make their listing images too complex by using backgrounds with texture, color, or gradients. 

These tactics might seem downright clever, but they are usually against Amazon guidelines and distract from the product.

For instance, a fitness equipment company began with a solid-colored backdrop and displayed a gradient background to support its products. 

The clean white background was used to ensure that the listing images passed compliance; however, it also ensured that the product design stood out among competitors, leading to high CTR.

* Tip from the Experts: Stop selling and allow your product to sell for you. A clean, tidy background showcases its simplicity and naturalness well.

 

# Background Variations for Secondary Listing Images

Amazon leaves little room for creativity with the main listing images (which mandate a white background), but secondary listing images can be more creative. You can play around with lifestyle shots, colorful backdrops, and props to show your product in action and create greater emotional appeal with shoppers.

In one case, a camping gear company paired its main image free of charge with lifestyle shots of its tent pitched in a beautiful outdoor setting. These extra listing images added context, showing shoppers how to picture the product in use, which helped them convert faster.

* Pro Tip: You can A/B test image styles on Amazon and see which resonates best with your audience!

 

# Size & Colour of Product to Background

Some products, especially the light or white ones, can hardly be seen in a pure white backdrop. Sellers can overcome this by utilizing subtle shadows, increased contrast, or outlines that are still visible but compliant.

For example, a sneaker brand that was selling white shoes used a very subtle shadow effect to almost guarantee that the shoes did not blend into the background. Visually distinct, this small step put the product at a different level.

* Tip: Enable higher contrast keys or shadows so your product will stand out from the background/front.

 

# Hire a Professional Photographer

DIY photography is possible, but professional Photography works best. With professional photographers, you will get the best quality **listing images** in accordance with Amazon guidelines. They will capture your product in the best light.

For example, an electronics seller had a studio professionally photograph their neutral background and lighting headphones. This investment increased the product’s perceived quality and led to greater conversion rates.

* Tip: If you sell on an e-commerce platform, hire a photographer well-versed in these companies for the best practices and standards.

Amazon continues to change its image-related policies, and it is important to ensure compliance; otherwise, your listing will be suppressed. Frequent checks reflect adjustments to your strategies to adapt them with maximum performance.

Consider a proactive seller who updated the main listing images as per Amazon’s new guidelines before receiving a penalty, continuing their sales without being affected, and hence ranking well.

* Tip: Bookmark the guidelines page on Amazon and go back now and again, for the changes will always be there.

# Tips for Crafting a Scroll-Stopping Amazon Image



# Concentrate on a Sharp and Clear Subject

Your image should have your product as the main focus, in great detail, without any blurriness or distractions. Professional and trust-building listing images Their sharpness and clarity make them immediately pop into the shopper’s eye.

For example, a luxury watch seller posted an image of the face of the watch so clearly that every single number and detail of the strap is visible. The attention to detail made the difference, letting the buyers see the quality of the listing with just a glance.

* Tip: Get high-resolution Photography, a proper cold background, and a center product.

 

# Emphasize Key Features

Your image must convey the uniqueness or superiority of your product as quickly as possible. By showing the highlights visually, you remove the shopper’s guesswork.

For instance, the laptop bag seller displayed the number of compartments in the main image, assisting potential customers with considering the product’s functionality. By adopting this approach, customers who desire to search for particular features and functionality are attracted.

* Tip: Avoid clutter and highlight differentiators such as durability, flexibility, design elements, etc.

 

# Lighting Should Be Your Top Priority To Keep Things Vibrant

Lighting could either create an image for the product or ruin it completely. Good illumination brings out a product’s colors, textures, and overall beauty, making it look fresh and appealing.

Studio lighting enhanced the glossy appearance of this stainless-steel cookware, helping to give it an upscale appearance when selling it. Though the detail may seem small, it increased customer confidence in the product’s quality.

* Do not use any harsh shadow or uneven light; use softboxes or a lightbox (pro tip).

 

# Enhance with Light Shadows or Reflections

Subtle shadows or reflections can create a three-dimensional look, helping the product look real and tangible. This added visual depth can help enhance the product’s value.

For example, a seller of wine glasses added a subtle reflection underneath the glass. The outcome was an upscale look that appealed to customers wanting luxury-quality glassware.

 

* Closeup Shadow Trick: Approach attention-seeking shadows that don’t detract from the product and don’t clutter the image.

 

# Leverage Color Psychology

Colors create feelings and can persuade someone to buy. Use a visually appealing color palette that makes your [product attractive](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-attractive-product-packaging-improves-amazon-fba-reviews/) and visually aligns with the market and audience you want to reach.

Do you need a color palette for a new project? A children’s toy seller. Used bright primary colors over a clean white background to grab attention and tell you everything you need to know about it in the clearest way possible – fun and energetic. This trend in bright colors was consistent with the fun product to entice parents and children.

* Tip: stay away from posted colors and clashing colors that distract from the product.

 

# Have a Working Example of the Product

Lifestyle listing images in which the product is neatly showcased in a real-world scenario allow shoppers to envision how they might incorporate it into their lives. Context like this can be a strong driver of purchase intent.

As an illustration, the image showcased dumbbells at a home gym in a fitness brand selling weights. This visual helped buyers realize how the product was relevant to their fitness goals.

* Tip: Use settings and models that make the image relatable to your target audience.

 

# Subtle Callout Addition (Secondary Image only possible)

Although text or graphics are not allowed in the main image on Amazon, secondary listing images can contain callouts for benefits, certifications, or features.

 

Popular skincare brands took it a few steps further by calling out “Paraben-Free” and “Dermatologist Approved” in their secondary listing images, where the concerns of their target audience will be found. This information gave a sense of trustworthiness and made the product seem like a core option.

* Tip: Use callouts sparingly, with a clear visual hierarchy, so that they enhance, not dominate, the product.

 

# Use Consistent Image Styles

Having a unified style of listing images for each list reinforces your brand identity and makes your shop look professional. Using the same backgrounds, lighting, and angles builds your customer trust.

For example, one tech gadget seller maintained uniformity in background, with all products shot on a white background along with similar zoom-in levels. Such repetitive branding gave the consumer a familiar mental picture of the product, which aided in the confidence of the bargain hunter making a purchase.

* Tip: Stay consistent with your photography and editing style that reflects your brand identity.

 

# Close Up on Textures or Details

Facilitating a sense of luxury in your product and allowing buyers to see the details(also texture) enables people to know what they will be buying and convinces them that your product is a premium product.

A leather wallet seller had a closeup providing detailed shots of the stitching and leather grain. You can enjoy reliability, which is much more vital than other things

* Tip: Use an additional image that zooms in on the product as part of the main listing photo.

# The Science of Product Photography



# Different is Better — 360-Degree Photography

Conventional static listing images can provide only a snapshot of your product; however, 360-degree Photography delivers a dynamic, interactive perspective. 

It means shoppers can rotate the product digitally and examine all the features from all perspectives, which makes them trust a purchase and shopping overall. Uncertainty is a major negative emotion people experience when shopping online. 

A smartwatch seller, for instance, adopted 360-degree views that enabled customers to interact with the watch by looking closely at the buttons, straps, and display. This improved customer engagement and resulted in a 20% rise in conversions.

 You can produce consistent and flawless 360-degree listing images that improve the overall experience by utilizing specialized turntable hardware or software.

 

# Use Subdued Lighting for Supporting Listing images

Though Amazon’s general image guidelines call for a white background, secondary listing images can use creative lighting to create feelings or moods. Warm lighting can create a cozy, welcoming environment, while cool lighting can express efficiency or modernity.

 One candle seller used warm, ambient lighting (in their secondary listing images) to mimic a calming and comfortable environment that appealed to buyers wanting to enhance their home’s ambiance. 

Examining how different lighting setups can align the product theme with the emotional tone expected by your target audience invokes relatability and desirability towards their products.

 

# Experiment with Unique Angles

While straight-on product shots are necessary, exploring unique angles can offer a fresh perspective that draws attention to the product’s uniqueness. 

Shooting from different angles, such as top-down and low-angle shots, helps reveal depth, dimensions, or textures that are detailed and otherwise missed in traditional shots. A backpack seller utilized a top-down view angle to highlight the interior compartments and give them a practical feel. 

Adding a couple of quirky points of view with a standard shot helps sellers show a complete picture of the product and makes it look more chic and functional.

 

# Add Before-and-After Shots

A great way to showcase your product’s effectiveness is to feature transformation through before-and-after photos. This method is particularly effective for beauty, cleaning, or fitness products. 

For instance, a seller of teeth whitening kits used a before-and-after image to demonstrate what happened after two weeks of use — that alone greatly increased buyer confidence by visually demonstrating the product’s effectiveness.

 However, to ensure [Amazon images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-turn-shoppers-into-buyers-with-killer-amazon-images/) look credible and professional, it is important to keep the lighting, framing, and angles similar between the before-and-after pictures.

 

# Contextual Objects Emphasize Product Size

Size can be hard to judge by the listing images alone, and the biggest reason for returns is misjudging a product’s scale. Adding a familiar object—a ruler, a hand, or a common object like a notebook—can give shoppers a better sense of the product’s size. 

For example, the seller of a desk lamp placed a notebook alongside the lamp in a second image to define its size and minimize confusion and return rates. Choosing props that will appeal to your target audience will reinforce the size of what they are buying, leaving little room for doubt.

 

# Be Multi-Functioning

This is especially useful if your product has multiple uses or features, which can effectively convince buyers — show them in action! When audiences can witness a product being used in different capacities, in real-world situations, it can genuinely showcase the adaptability of the product.

 For instance, the seller of a multi-purpose contraption for the kitchen displayed the item in action—chopping vegetables, whisking eggs, and opening jars—all in one image collage. 

This method also showed the product’s multi-functionality in one-hit, which appealed to buyers looking for practical and value-rich solutions. Editing software makes it easier to blend these actions into a clean, cohesive collage that looks polished and engaging.

 

# Include Natural Shadows To Impart Some Depth

[Product listing images](https://medium.com/@theohuge3/common-mistakes-to-avoid-with-amazon-product-listing-images-ddb9da0edc76) with natural soft shadows can make those subjects feel more real, touchable, and grounded. This technique avoids the flat appearance of lighting that is overly bright, unshaded, or not illuminated with enough contrast. 

For instance, a shoe company subtly added shadows under their sneakers to make them appear more natural, adding a premium, realistic tone to the product. 

When working with diffused lighting and even post-production tools to enhance/sharpen shadows, the perfect shadow effect creates pictorial balance without diversion from the product.

 

# Get Seasonal Variants or Limited Editions

If your product follows a seasonal variation or has limited-edition designs, showcase them with visuals so users know it’s something to get now, as it will only last for a while. Seasonal props or composites in the background can also convey that the product is timely and relevant to the shopper. 

For instance, a seller of mugs used props, such as candy canes and snowflakes, in secondary listing images to support a Christmas edition.

 This seasonal imagery made sense to consumers hunting for festive gifts. When using seasonal props, be careful to keep the product manageable; the product needs to be the center of attention or its appeal will be diluted.

 

# Utilize Split-Frame Listing images

Split-frame listing images are a good way to display different qualities of your product at once, which is useful for emphasizing multiple features or product variations. This configuration splits the image into segments, providing a more comprehensive perspective.

 For instance, a beauty brand featured a split-frame image to highlight the product’s texture, packaging,, and a lifestyle shot of it being applied. 

Thus, simultaneously provide a quick glance at all key product information. Use contrasting colors or crisp dividers to keep the split-frame image understandable and digestible.

 

# Stress Tests: Focus on Durability

Something to turn up maxima when an aspect of your essence is resistant, you could realize some pressure tests to state how strong it really will be. Demonstrating product durability in an impactful but contained manner helps establish credibility and trust.

 For instance, a luggage brand showcased its suitcase being crushed by a car wheel to demonstrate its durability, attracting frequent travelers who are on the search for dependable, hard-wearing options. 

It’s important that these stress tests are realistic and don’t damage the product’s look or credibility because otherwise, the effect might be diminished.”

# How the Right Image Can Make Premium Pricing Acceptable



A product’s right image can significantly influence the consumer’s feelings of value for their money, making premium pricing acceptable if not desirable.

High-quality listing images create trust and confidence and show off the product’s high craftsmanship. These are a few examples of how an image can justify and support premium pricing:

 

# Detail Conveys High Quality

Premium products have always been synonymous with higher quality, and listing images that highlight this are all premium listing images that show a product in the best possible light suitably reinforce the notion. 

For example, closeups of skilled craftsmanship, expensive materials, and unusual design features will all help demonstrate the product’s value.

Example: A luxury watch merchant might use closeup pictures to show off the watch’s fine detail, such as the beautiful stitching on the leather band. Such detailed listing images can justify a higher price by focusing attention on the quality and craftsmanship of the product.

* Pro Tip: Macro lenses are useful for capturing fine details and textures that reinforce the product’s premium image.

 

# Making a Lifestyle Connection

So, premium products are not only about the product itself in terms of its material nature; they also represent a way of life or status.

 A product, if it’s shown where people want to live, very aspirational listing images, perhaps at a wine bar offering espresso in a new Porsche, a first-class airport lounge, or sailing tropically at sunset with their Haines Hunter, may communicate this message. 

A high-end piece of luggage in the exclusive airport VIP lounge or a top-tier skincare product in a spa-like setting both imply—or are targeted directly toward—buyers who love luxury and elegance.

Example: A top-of-the-line blender, like one made by Super Kitchen Appliances, might be photographed in an ultramodern kitchen with sharp-looking countertops. This helps potential buyers visualize the product as part of a high lifestyle.

* Pro Tip: Ensure that your [lifestyle images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/mastering-the-balance-of-infographics-and-lifestyle-images-in-2024/) tap into the aspirations of your target market by providing suitable locations and props.

 

Building Trust

High-quality pictures make your product seem more reliable. Drawing a picture so vividly real that the buyer is all but able to pick it up from the page is what a professional photographer can do. 

Sometimes, when so many pictures are in circulation, more general photographs have an even better effect on sales than those taken during a live-test event, particularly for still-life shots or listing images taken under different lighting conditions–because there is no room for opposition and they all look good. 

The important thing is to show your potential buyers that even though your product may have been photographed through an ordinary lens instead of one specially designed for its use, no one should think less of it because it looks just like others.

For example, One seller of premium-quality leather bags ensures that all their products are photographed in a clean, homelike setting without any extraneous interference. 

High-resolution cameras bring all the rich textures and high-class finishes to life. This proficiency adds value and makes the product better equipped for operation.

* Pro Tip: A professional photographer or a high-quality camera, in conjunction with excellent lighting, can ensure that your listing images reflect the actual quality of your product.

 

 Highlighting Exclusivity and Scarcity

Listing images can help show how rare or exclusive a product is. By packaging it in special edition boxes, offering limited-time deals, or fashioning unique design elements in images;, you suggest to the consumer that this is not something commonplace or easily come by. Consequently, it should be priced higher.

For example, a limited-edition sneaker brand may photograph the latest unique design of one of its shoes—something with its own distinctive color contrast, entirely novel materials, and fresh stylistic elements in its use of stitches. No one else in the world will have that model.

* Pro Tip: Use subtle brand markings or add appropriate verbiage on your image captions, such as “exclusive release” or even just the word “limited” where appropriate, because the rarity and exclusiveness will be heightened through this portrayal.5 Emotionally Involving People

 

# Through Color or Lighting

Colors and lighting can evoke emotions. Thus, people who buy high-quality products come to associate such items with positive feelings and experiences. Warm shades often suggest opulence and comfort, while cool or pale tones may signify that this product is in keeping with the spirit of the age. 

Careful lighting can make the product look glamorous, definite, and inviting to use at any time of day or night.

 

Example: A high-end skincare brand may choose soft, warm light sources for their listing images to help communicate the gentle, carefree feeling that comes from using one’s own skin care products, while a premium technology product would use cool lighting effects to signify not only modernism and fashion but also new accomplishments in this area.

* Pro Tip: Experiment with various lighting techniques and color gradations in order to ensure that your product’s listing images produce the correct emotional resonance.

 

# Creating Perception of Value Through Context

The context in which a product is displayed can definitely lift its perceived value. By putting a luxury product in an environment that’s been carefully selected, you’re alleging subtly that the product has value commensurate with its higher price because it fits readily into other luxurious or high-value items.

Example: A premium coffee maker could be photographed next to gourmet coffee beans, fine mugs, kitchen accessories, etc., thus creating a whole atmosphere and thereby providing potential customers with something special (prestige, to borrow another term).

* Pro Tip: Pay attention to the props and scene context in your pictures—make sure they are consistent with both the product’s brand image and the kind of lifestyle you’re supposed to be projecting.7.

 

# Educating the Customer with Product Features

Clear, informative listing images that emphasize the key features of a luxury product can help customers appreciate why it commands a higher price. 

For example, a closeup shot showing the materials used or a comparison side by side with a similar yet lower-quality version will show shoppers why the product is better quality.

Example: A high-end stereo earphone company would use listing images to display their expensive materials like memory foam earpads, brass-encased wire conductors, and fine audio drivers, thereby justifying the higher price tag with quality construction.

* Pro Tip: Use labels, zoom in on parts, and focus points to explain your product’s value proposition visually.

 

# Targeting Niche Markets

Premium prices are more acceptable when targeting the niche areas where exclusivity, craftsmanship, or having special features is valued. 

To help make customers feel comfortable buying a more expensive product, listing images must reflect very distinctly the tastes and needs of the [Amazon niche](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/10-explosive-amazon-niches-you-need-to-watch-in-2025/) audience.

Example: The selling of a custom-made guitar might focus on fine craftsmanship, special wood grains, and details, priding themselves on musicians whose living depend upon their instrument that suits specific styles of music. 

For the working musician, such an instrument will be a little more expensive but they can afford it if it fits into its narrow parameters.

* Pro Tip: Aim your [product photography](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-product-photography) at the hearts of your own customers. Target whatever characteristics from among common ones have some positive or special connotation for them.

Just picked up a used Vario grinder on marketplace for $50. When I picked it up I plugged it in to make sure it works but when I brought it home I realized that the grind size doesn't change when I adjust the dials. The seller was a gift shop that may have an an coffee machine at some point but closed down and liquidated everything.Anyone know if this is repairable? There's a company locally that claims they could fix it and would charge $150 plus parts but if I'm in it for $200 I think it would be better to put that towards a new one.",2,1734002765.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I thought that nearly every part is available separately, but I’m struggling so much with the handle of the flow control. I really would like to have these type of handles for the flow control instead of the paddle (yes maybe I’m stupid), but they are only available in bulk with the whole flow control/valve and apparently available nowhere separately, even though they usually put two in one package… Does anyone know where to get one in Germany/Europe maybe separately? Now I ran out of ideas, though I tried with the bigger suppliers.

Hi! I met this guy over Reddit, late 30s professional, and we really hit it off. We texted a bunch (friendly and spicy). We decided to meet up in person and had a great time. We got to know each other pretty intimately if you catch my drift. Next day, he messages me and tell me he feels super guilty about what happened since he’s married (which I knew, and I am also married). So we agree to be friends and keep things not spicy. I admit I messaged him a little too much telling him how much I liked him and that I didn’t want to just be his friend hahahaha and he hit me with the you can message me but I’m busy so idk if I can respond. Ok messaged received. A couple of days later, I message him to tell him a funny anecdote as a friend. He starts sending me flirty messages back asking me to get a drink with him and referencing things we did when we saw each other. I messaged him back because it’s what I want and he knows this. The following day, I don’t get any messages back from him. I told him I was going to be in town and we should get coffee. He said he wouldn’t be in town. I said oh maybe next time then. And then nothing.

Is this man interested? Is he playing games? Should I leave him alone? Do I keep pursuing it?

I get so tempted to message him but it drives me crazy that he won’t respond 🙃

For more information in Finnish please follow link: https://fb.me/e/4ShMs8r4G

Would you like to go deeper into Buddhist practice? Now, you have a unique opportunity!
We will start a five-year teaching series of the six yogas of the Ma Gyud — Mother Tantra in Finland from January 31st to February 4th, 2025.

WHAT ARE THE SIX YOGAS?

The Six Yogas is a classical Tibetan practice ensemble with different teaching lineages. Also, the names of the ensemble and their parts vary, sometimes referred to as the six dharmas, the six paths, or the path of methods. The number of exercises also varies. Here, we use the term six yogas, the most familiar term in the Western world.

In the context of Mother Tantra, the term Tabhlam Che, integration of methods, is used for the six yogas. With the help of the six yogas, you can integrate the practice into everyday life. Geshe Lhundup considers it particularly important how we can carry out the practice long-term in our daily lives.

The six yogas of Mother Tantra are:

1. Tsa Lung and Tummo (movement, breathing, and visualization exercises designed to balance the elements in our body and open the central channel, using inner heat and the experience of bliss)
2. Dream yoga (conscious dreaming, transforming dream experiences, and understanding the nature of existence through the dream world)
3. Clear light yoga (resting in the nature of the mind during deep sleep)
4. Chöd (generosity exercise to overcome fear)
5. Phowa (ejection of consciousness through the crown chakra at the moment of death)
6. Bardo (preparation for death and the journey of consciousness in the post-death state)

THE STRUCTURE OF THE TEACHINGS

According to the preliminary plan, Geshe Lhundup will teach us two to three times yearly in five-day sessions. In addition, we will organize joint Zoom exercises with him, during which you can also ask questions. We will also hold online exercises once a week among Finns. Tsa Lung is the main exercise, and as the teaching cycle progresses, we also plan to do other Mother Tantra exercises together.

You can attend any teachings even if you have not participated in the previous ones. However, you will get the most out of the teachings if you commit to them long-term. You can also follow the teachings via Zoom. The lessons teachings are translated from English into Finnish.

These exercises are not recommended for people with severe mental health problems.

THE TEACHER

Geshe Lhundup was born into a nomadic Tibetan family in a small village called Damrani in Kham province, about 750 kilometers north of Lhasa. At six, he started tending his family's yaks and sheep. At age 12, he became a monk and moved to Patsang Monastery in Kham. While there, he received Dzogchen, Trul-Khor, and Tsa-Lung teachings from several masters of the Bön tradition.

In 1993, at the age of 17, Geshe Lhundup went on a pilgrimage to Mount Kailash. From that journey, he and 29 other people escaped across the Himalayas on foot to Nepal. In Kathmandu, they were welcomed by Yongdzin Tenzin Namdak Rinpoche, the most important teacher in the Bon tradition and founder of Triten Norbutse Monastery in Nepal. He encouraged the refugees to continue their journey to Menri Monastery in India, where they could study for a Geshe degree, the equivalent of a Western doctorate in philosophy.

Geshe Lhundup studied at Menri Monastery in Dolanj from 1993 to 2009. His studies included Sutra, Tantra, and Dzogchen, as well as Tibetan grammar, poetry, astrology, medicine, mandala painting, calligraphy, yoga, and meditation. After 15 years of study, he completed his Geshe degree. From Menri Monastery he went to Dharamsala to learn English and also met the Dalai Lama.

Geshe Lhundup's first book in Tibetan, Mahayana: The Foundation, Way, and Consequence of Dzogchen, was published in 2008. An English translation of the book is currently being prepared.

In 2010, Geshe Lhundup arrived in France at the Shenten Centre. From 2013 to 2016, he taught in France under the auspices of Ligmincha International, which Geshe Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche created. In 2018, he founded the independent Association Sagesse du Tibet.

It was a gloomy, drizzly Wednesday morning as I left my compound for my usual moped --> subway --> school route. I stopped at my favorite Baozi place for breakfast and rode to my subway stop. As I got off my moped and reach to get my phone from my pocket in order to pay for the subway, I realized it was gone. I searched my backpack and moped to see if I put it in a weird spot but it's nowhere to be found. I realized I must have dropped it as I was putting my phone back in my pocket after paying. I rushed back to find it and, even though it had only been \~10 minutes, it was gone. 

I pull out my iPad using a coffee shops wifi to use find my iPhone and see it is 4 blocks away (not in the direction of my subway) so I figure someone had taken it. I drive to the location and find a police officer in a car and ask him to help me look. He goes to the location, sees it's a 20+ floor apartment building, and says sorry he can't search the entire thing and he would need a description of the person that took it. I asked him to check the CCTV footage of the area I lost it in and he directed me to the relevant police station. 

After arriving (he sent me to the wrong one at first), it's been about 1 hour since I dropped my phone. I asked the police officer at the reception to check the CCTV telling her what happened and she called out the officer that handles the CCTV footage (I guess, maybe she just delegated). The other officer took all my info such as the store name and location, the time I bought the baozi (thanks WeChat pay for exact transaction times), and the route I took to the subway. She then goes in the back to look. After \~20 minutes she came out and told me I didn't drop it at the store, but it had slipped out of my pocket \~2 blocks after. Using CCTV, she had followed me and saw the tiny black dot that was my phone fall out of my pocket. I excitedly returned to the location but after looking for 10 minutes I couldn't find it. 

I went back to the police station, and the CCTV officer said she would check again to see if anyone had picked it up after I dropped it. After about another 20 minutes, she came back looking excited and said she saw who picked up my phone! She called over another officer, giving him the footage of the person picking up my phone, and within 30 seconds he had the persons full information (name, DOB, hometown, address, picture, phone number, everything). The police gave them a call, and after a little persuading that nothing would happen to them if they just returned it (the person who took my phone sounded STRESSED), they came to the police station and returned my phone (again, they seemed freaked out!). It had been ran over a few times as the CCTV officer noticed but the screen protector and case did its job and there was no major damage (props apple).

In the end, this took about 3 hours, where in my home country the US, that phone would have never been seen again. This just goes to show, if China wants to find you, they will. Any law they want to enforce, they can. I've heard other stories of cops not helping foreigners and while I'm not discrediting those, I wanted to tell a great story of Shanghai cops helping me. I'm sure there are many factors that played a role in them helping me such as that I speak Chinese (22M-W), but I think also just being really thankful for their time helped too! If you ever have something stolen in Shanghai, go to the police, be nice, be persistent, have details such as when, where, and where you went after, and hopefully you can get it back!

I'd love to hear anyone else's stories (good or bad) about working with cops in Shanghai!

I had the suspicion Mr. Cavendish wanted something stronger than the water he ordered from his housekeeper, Ms. Liesel, after we had all sat down in the living room and tried to adjust to this new life.

In the car, I had made a great effort to quietly, firmly, and consistently lay out what had happened with Chloe. I had just been accepted as a kindergarten teacher at Hamilton Prep, a mostly human school with an excellent reputation. I had also been dating a fellow teacher, though I downplayed that because Chloe was listening.

And then there had been the day I’d come home to my apartment, and there in the courtyard was a man I’d never seen who was leaving a wicker basket on my doorstep.

I called out to the man and even tried to chase him, but he disappeared too quickly. I came back and opened the basket to find an infant, though I could tell it wasn’t a newborn. A small printed note in the basket had read only: This is Chloe, born May 5. Please take care of her.

That, Chloe’s diaper and onesie, and a small blanket were all I had to go on when I went to the police.

At this point, I couldn’t help but gather Chloe up in my arms and apologize solemnly for lying to her about her parents. I explained I had wanted to wait until she was just a little older to tell her the truth.

To my surprise, Chloe took several minutes to consider things before nodding very seriously and saying she understood. Then she hugged me and said, “You take care of me, Mommy.”

Grace, who had been sitting on her own in the loveseat, got down, walked over, and sat down next to me on my other side. I cuddled them both and held back a few tears. I saw how the girls looked at each other in happiness. I thought my heart would burst.

When I could continue, grateful for Mr. Cav’s patience, I explained how I’ve been raising Chloe, skipping the part about how the man I had thought I might marry disappeared as soon as I moved her in. I talked about the werewolf lore I’d learned, including seeing to it that my daughter participated in rites that were appropriate for pups, providing her with books on werewolves and humans, and never letting Chloe forget her heritage.

“And what can you remember about this man’s appearance?” Mr. Cavendish asked.

I shook her head and hugged both girls a little tighter. “He was just a silhouette, and not even that was clear, considering the evening shadows. And it’s been five years now. I remember he was tall, but I don’t even know if he were human or a werewolf.”

The chauffeur knocked briefly and opened the door to the living room. At a nod from his employer, he gestured behind him, and three strong-looking betas entered carrying my sofa, armchair, and coffee table. It was all I could do not to shout in my surprise.

“What’s that?” I wanted to know, and I would have stood up if two little girls weren’t in my arms.

Three more betas entered carrying Chloe’s mattress, box springs and bed frame, and her little white headboard with the flowers carved into it.

“Oh, we will need to discard some of this,” Mr. Cavendish said oh-so-casually, looking it over with a judgmental eye.

I bristled. Yeah, my sofa didn’t cost as much as a new car, but my furniture was fine. Hiding my dismay, probably poorly, I asked, “Wait, please, what exactly is going on here?”
“As of today, you’ll be living here,” he told me.

“You’ve just made that decision for me?”
“You don’t have a choice.”

I looked at Chloe, who immediately hugged me tighter, whispering, “Mommy. Are we going to live with Daddy?”

I saw Mr. Cavendish purposefully soften his expression. “My child deserves the best education, the best environment, and they, well, they need you. Besides, I must learn the truth about the past, and you are the only clue.”

I wanted to argue, but then I looked down into both girls with their bright blue puppy eyes. Was I supposed to deny Chloe a better life because of my pride? And yes, he was being officious, but he was an alpha and doubtlessly used to getting his way with no questions.

“All right,” I said. “I can see the necessity and how this would be the best for our, I mean, Chloe and Grace. They need to get to know each other, after all, and I won’t be parted from Chloe.”

He nodded.

“But at least I should have the right to decide where these pieces of furniture go, right?” I said. “Each item was bought with the money I earned and is filled with memories of Chloe and me. You can’t just decide to throw them away. If I’m to live here, where’s my room?”

He looked surprised that a “little” human would assert herself. He looked back over my things, and then at the kitchen table, flat-screen TV on a stand, and chest of drawers as they were brought in on a second trip by the first trio of betas.

I knew my furniture was all quite simple, but it was comfortable and clean with a homey feel. I hoped he could understand the familiar items would help Chloe to adjust to living in this new place.

“You’re right, and you will take the guest suite,” he said as he gestured to his chauffeur, who led the betas out of the room and down the hall. He returned a moment later and murmured something to Mr. Cavendish, who nodded and then asked me to go into the room and show where the things should be placed.

Ms. Liesel led me, Chloe, and Grace into a suite larger than my entire apartment. It had an attached bath and a kitchenette, and I wondered if it had been sitting empty or if Mr. Cavendish had had it emptied for me and Chloe that morning.

Soon enough, I had the betas placing the beds, nightstands, desks, and bookshelves where they would maintain go flow through the room and clearly mark off the space for my daughter from my bed area. By the time the betas were bringing in boxes of books, Chloe was putting up the pots, pans, and utensils with an air of authority that made me smile.

Grace was standing next to me as I was putting the linens on Chloe’s bed. The sheets and pillowcase were plain white, and the comforter was covered in black-and-gray sketches of wolves with blue eyes. I hoped Mr. Cavendish wouldn’t object to it. I wanted this to feel like Chloe’s “real” home as much as possible.
“Will you be my mommy now?” I heard Grace ask in a whisper.

“How is that possible? She’s just a human,” Liesel snapped, all but rolling her eyes at the idea. “Only Miss Ella is worthy of Alpha Zane.”

“Miss Ella?” I asked. What was my old employer’s relationship with Mr. Cav, exactly?
Liesel drew herself up a bit. “Miss Ella is the twin sister of Zane’s former wife, and she raised Miss Grace. Remember your place; you’re just a human.”

I shrugged and said, “You’re right, but that has nothing to do with me. I’m just here for Chloe, but that doesn’t mean Grace and I can’t be great friends, does it, sweetie?” I looked down at Mr. Cav’s daughter, who smiled and nodded shyly.

Then I realized Mr. Cavendish was standing in the doorway and turned away from the officious Ms. Liesel’s proud, beta-brown eyes.

“Sign this,” he instructed, handing me a folder, which I opened with a frown. What new thing did he want from me now?

“A nanny non-disclosure agreement?” I asked, scanning it. “I’m to be responsible for the daily care of Chloe and Grace.” That was fine.
Then I read it: Remember your human status, and do not disclose any private information about your employer. Do not seduce the employer or engage in sexual relations with him.",1,1734000976.0,GoodNovelHub,0,1.0,False
1hcilai,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1hcilai/people_of_indore_please_be_cautious_of_scams_at/,"People of INDORE, please be cautious of scams at the Ibus booth.
","Sorry for long paragraph but please read it if you use iBus regularly.

I don't know where to start, but I want to share with you all an incident that happened to me on December 8th at 8:00 AM at the Satya Sai iBus ticket booth. It was just a normal day, everything was fine, and I lined up to buy an iBus ticket from Satya Sai to Visnupuri. I gave a 200 RS note to the counter, the ticket fare came out to be 25 RS and along with the change (multiple 20Rs note), I got my ticket. But here's the catch: while I was about to leave for the iBus, which was just about to depart, I felt that something seemed off when the guy gave me the change. Thus, I recounted the notes and, to my surprise, instead of 175 RS, it was just140 RS(7notes of 20Rs) and a 5 RS coin. Seeing this, I thought to myself that maybe my math is not accurate this early in the morning, so I headed towards the counter, recounting notes while looking at the ticket maker at the booth. But I realized that it was not my early morning without coffee fatigue; this guy really tried to scam me. Upon approaching him, I saw him slowly shifting his hands around the counter and slightly moving the change in all coins towards me. When I asked him about how much the fare was and how much he gave me back, he gave me an excuse of, ""Oh, you forgot this change I've put here,"" and so on, while I knew that he didn't give me any at the start. But here comes another event that made my blood boil: instead of happily giving me my change, he insisted that he had given me the correct amount and accused me of lying. He asked for the money he gave me to be returned to him, so I complied and gave it to him. He recounted the money and gave it to me, but after I got the money in my hand again, I felt something was off as before there were many notes, now there were few, and when I counted it, instead of being 140 RS of 7 notes of 20 RS, it was just 4 notes of 20 RS. The good thing was, I was standing in front of him when he handed over the money to me. As I looked at him again, I saw the 10 RS coins he had placed in front of him slowly moving towards me. Then, in a louder voice, he said that he had put the change in front of me to collect. I replied, asking why he had taken the notes away when they were fine. Hearing this, he stumbled for a second and apologized. I collected my ticket, and while waiting for another bus, I saw him checking around the stop to ensure all the cameras were off or not watching him. He then returned to the booth.

After everything that happened and discussing with my friends at place, I learned that this is happening very commonly in Indore and If you do not pay attention, they will scam you too.

After this, I reimagined the situation and discovered how these guys got me in the first place.

toh ye log aise krte h ki dekhte h ki kya booth ke samne bheed hai ki nhi, fir dekhte bus khadi h ki nhi ya dusari wli kabh aane wli h( mere case me booth wle ko samne se hi dikh jata h signal pe khadi bus) , fir ye dekhte ki hadbadi kitni h( iss case me mere dost ko 150 ka chuna lga tha), fir ye dekhte tumne paise kitne diye, agar jyada badi rakam hoti let's say 100-200, toh ye scam hone ke chances increase ho jate h bahut jyada. abh hota h yha se scam, ye tumko ticket ke sath change denge aur change dete wakt ye ginte ginte bahar dekhega taki tum bhi uske sath dekho aur ussi beech ye note badalta upar neeche, aur h kabhi bhi badi note me nhi dete ye change ( 50rs,100rs ki notes me) hamesha 10 ya 20 ya kabhi kabhi 50.....fir tum paise loge aur socho ge ki bhai sahi diya hoga aur nikal jaoge.....tumhare jate-jate counter se bahar dekhna booth wla banda tumko dekhta rehta h jate hue, agar tum palte vapas toh voh jhaat se counter pe rakha change aage kr dega aur tumko lagega ki me bhul gya aur agar nhi palte toh voh dusare ko abh pakdne me baith jata aur aise ye scam chal rha h.

TLDR: I experienced an attempted scam at a bus ticket booth in Indore. The ticket seller gave me less change than I was owed, and when I pointed it out, they they had given the correct change and me of lying. The seller then tried to return the correct change, but I noticed the amount of cash had decreased. I also observed the seller trying to hide the security cameras, suggesting an attempt to cover up scam..

1hcijo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Digital-Marketing-dp/comments/1hcijo4/understanding_the_impact_of_voice_search_on_seo/,Understanding the Impact of Voice Search on SEO,"https://preview.redd.it/mtkb842fee6e1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=500f3b841ca681975b9874cc01fabc49d745a6eb

# Shift to Conversational Queries

One of the primary differences between text search and voice search is the way users phrase their queries. Voice search is typically more conversational, with users asking full questions rather than typing keywords. For example, a text search might look like “best restaurants near me,” while a voice search would be more natural, such as “What are the best restaurants near me?”

As the [Best SEO Company in India](https://www.digitalpiloto.com/seo-company-india/), Digital Piloto Pvt. Ltd. suggests optimizing your website content to reflect this conversational tone. Using long-tail keywords and phrasing that mirrors how people speak can improve your rankings in voice search results.

# Focus on Featured Snippets

Featured snippets, also known as ""position zero,"" are the concise answers that appear at the top of Google search results. These are highly valuable for voice search, as virtual assistants often pull information from these snippets to answer user queries.

To capitalize on this trend, businesses should structure their content in a way that answers common questions clearly and succinctly. Optimizing featured snippets by providing direct answers, lists, and bullet points can boost your chances of being featured.

# Mobile Optimization is Key

Voice search is predominantly used on mobile devices, making mobile optimization essential for businesses. Google’s mobile-first indexing means that mobile-friendly websites are prioritized in search rankings.

Digital Piloto Pvt. Ltd. advises ensuring that your website is responsive and optimized for mobile devices, with fast loading times and easy navigation. A mobile-optimized site is not only crucial for SEO but also for improving the overall user experience, which is a critical ranking factor.

# The Importance of Local SEO

Voice searches often have a local intent, with users searching for nearby businesses, restaurants, services, and products. For instance, a user may ask, “Where is the nearest coffee shop?” or “What’s the best dentist in my area?”

Optimizing your website for local SEO is crucial for appearing in these voice search results. This includes claiming and updating your Google My Business listing, using location-specific keywords, and ensuring your name, address, and phone number (NAP) are consistent across all online platforms. As an [SEO company](https://www.digitalpiloto.com/seo-company-kolkata/), Digital Piloto Pvt. Ltd. emphasizes the importance of local SEO to help businesses capture local voice search traffic.

# Structured Data and Schema Markup

Structured data and schema markup are essential for helping search engines understand the content on your website. By using schema markup, businesses can enhance their search visibility, especially in voice search.

For instance, adding structured data for reviews, products, or events can improve the chances of your business being featured in voice search results. As part of our SEO Services, Digital Piloto Pvt. Ltd. helps businesses implement schema markup to ensure that search engines can easily extract relevant information from your site.

# Faster Load Times

Voice search users expect quick, accurate results. Websites with slow loading times can negatively impact the user experience and hurt your SEO rankings.

Digital Piloto Pvt. Ltd. recommends optimizing your site for speed by compressing images, minimizing code, and leveraging browser caching. Ensuring fast load times not only improves user satisfaction but also boosts your chances of ranking higher in voice search results.

# Voice Search Analytics

To refine your SEO strategy, it’s important to track and measure the impact of voice search on your traffic. Tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console can help you understand how voice search is influencing your website’s performance.

Digital Piloto Pvt. Ltd. advises setting up voice search-specific tracking to [measure](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/measure) the success of your optimization efforts. By analyzing voice search data, you can adjust your content and strategies to improve performance.

# Conclusion

The rise of voice search is transforming how users interact with search engines, and businesses must adapt their SEO strategies accordingly. By focusing on conversational keywords, optimizing for featured snippets, improving mobile performance, and leveraging local SEO, companies can better align with voice search trends. As the Best SEO Company in India, Digital Piloto Pvt. Ltd. offers comprehensive SEO Services to help businesses stay ahead of the competition in the voice search era.

I’m a 27 year old male from the UK 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 like some on reddit I don’t get to outwardly express my sexuality and sexual interests in everyday life so here I am.

I’m usually commenting on NSFW subs, edging and ARAD being most prominent. I enjoy giving compliments on normal nudes etc. and on the flip side I enjoy other more not as nice subs within the confines of the kink that’s being engaged in. 

My DMs are open, love chatting and making new friends. I do play in chats and send to the right people if we get along int he first instance. I’m dominant in a soft and carrying sort of way so if that’s your thing then I’d be down to explore and see if we’re a good match for some Dom/Sub play.☺️

Kinks include: Domination, degradation, humiliation, BDSM, Anal, Squirting, Fingering, Light choking, BBW’s (I love all woman’s bodies but I have a soft spot for the curvy kind 😇), Pee Play, Bladder control, Orgasm Control, Dirty messy panties, Scent, Misogyny (only within the terms of kink I am by no means a real misogynist) and I’m sure more that aren’t coming to mind. 

Limits are: Blood, Scat, Knives, Needles, Beast, Actual harm, Minors and anything illegal whatsoever.

Anything not in my kinks and limits I’d be cool with chatting about and exploring 😋

 Also, consent and online safety is important! I value everyone’s consent and would never look to take advantage or ever share anything shared with me. I will likely ask us both to verify during chatting as I know how bad the catfish and not problem is on reddit.

Other than that I enjoy a simple life like time by myself, coffee, wine, walks, movies and tv, video games, little bit of an anime nerd but not to a degree where I’m gonna be weird about it 😅 I’m 6ft 2, medium/short messy brown hair, big hands and I guess anything else you want to know you can ask 😇

Being the mother of Kronos after all. Those who delve into the unknown secrets she and her son created within the depths of the world, she herself had created will find nothing worthy of wealth or glory. However, the folly of man is ceaseless, despite being her children, when they seek out the mysterious places of their land. Will find nothing but mystery, madness and most likely of all, inevitable death.

Andrew, Emily, Evelyn, Douglas and I were all studying at the university of Exeter. :Douglas studying mechanical engineering, Emily being a student of geography, Andrew of history, Evelyn studying philosophy, and I being a student of medicine (trying my best, but struggling with the workload). Which as it turns out we all were. Douglas suggested during exam season ""We should really go on a trip so we aren't wasting our lives reading books, textbooks and ancient history books of no note, there's only so much Gibbon you can read before it gets dull"". Douglas was a foolhardy person and was obsessed over his passion project of working on a 1980s Jeep bought for £300 at auction, which he insisted would work a beauty once he'd finalised his 'alterations and repairs'. We were all young, just out of adolescence with me being 22 and the rest being 21 almost touching 22 themselves. I progressed to say ""To be honest Doug, despite how silly you are that isn't the worst suggestion you've ever made"", which the group found amusing and we settled on the idea of the weeklong jaunt.

We decided a nice trip would be towards the coast, as the beaches around Exeter were beginning to bore us, having lived most of our lives in the area. Anyways, we settled on our destination being to a cottage on the south-western coast of Cornwall in a small village Doug had heard of called Anglesand in one of his silly car magazines. He insisted that we set off as early as possible stating ""I'm not quite sure if these headlights will last too long, and the battery isn't fantastic"". This obviously filled us all with apprehension, but foolhardy as we were, this plan seemed good enough. I was the one to pack for the journey; I didn't necessarily plan particularly well - I packed an optimistic set of summer gear: some raincoats (being England after all), enough blankets for us all incase the cottage was undersupplied, and two sleeping bags. Along with a set of food, and obviously booze, some bottles of whisky, far too many cans of beer and a couple bottles of wine for when we felt bougie. I perhaps should have packed some tools, and even some binoculars, for spotting birds and eventually our final illusive hope of rescue.

Setting off as Doug had suggested early in the morning much to Emily's chagrin, her being a night owl stating ""Why couldn't we just move on at midday, its summer, doesn't even get dark until near bloody 10pm"" To which Douglas responded ""Because despite how fantastic an engineer I am, I don't trust the headlights and I'm quite frankly shocked the car passed the MOT"". This did nothing to unsettle Emily's nerves about Doug's engineering 'prowess', but as we rolled through the English countryside in pleasant weather, Emily fell asleep on my shoulder. I had been crushing on her since I'd met her 3 years prior, so this seemed like maybe my flirtatious attitude had finally had some success. A beautiful brunette with stunning hazel eyes, the moment I set my eyes upon her I was smitten.

Whilst we travelled through the beautiful rural English summer countryside, Andrew had grown bored and brought out a book he had 'borrowed' from the university's library, describing the history of Anglesand. Andrew began talking with most of us ignoring him out of disinterest ""Anglesand was founded in the 4th century AD by the Roman's, apparently according to this book drawn to the area by the hot pools and the easy access for trade back to Gaul and even Rome itself. But, they abandoned the town shortly after establishment and it was later inhabited by the Anglo-Saxons, who seem to have done the same. The history ends there, odd but maybe the chronicler got bored of this project and moved on before he had finalised his last edit"". None of us frankly cared about Andrew's rambling, and continued to enjoy views of the English countryside.

Our group arrived in Anglesand in the late afternoon, and journeyed straight to our cottage with Evelyn unsurprisingly taking 20 minutes to figure out the process of opening the rusted keybox (her not being of the handy, nor precise kind hence why we tasked her with this, as sort of a crass joke). During this time we conversed about what we should do on our weeklong trip. Douglas piped up ""We should visit the town hall, and check it out, from what I read it sounded beautiful and masterfully conserved"", I then suggested the church first as that was the primary building of the village, but sadly Emily overruled me (maybe our budding romance wasn't going as well as I had thought). Once Evelyn finally finished the convoluted process of opening the aged keybox I said and Doug agreed "" We should take an early night and begin exploring in the morning"" However, our party had endured our final exams that week and despite Doug and I's protestations to catch a nice early nights sleep to start early in the morning, we ended up drinking and playing cards and drinking games late into the night. Andrew being the last to pass out on to the couch, after finishing off a bottle of rum he'd brought privately.

When we eventually awoke surprisingly and almost suspiciously early, with me being the first to wake with a shocking headache. I began making the classic hungover travail of making breakfast and probably pissed the group off by shouting ""Breakfast is ready!"" which in a small cottage probably wasn't necessary. We sat down, drank some coffee to help heal our hangovers and ate the frankly delicious mix of food I had prepared. Bacon sandwiches, toast with marmite, butter and jam - and the most beautiful item in my most honest opinion, some croissants I had made the day before. I had meant to bring a pancake mix, but sadly in our hurry to begin the journey I had left it at home.

First on our list of sites to visit was as Doug had previously described the infamous town hall. Which we were surprised to find dilapidated and generally in a poor condition; not the highly maintained and beautiful regal building Doug had described on our journey down. Evelyn thought this hilarious, and said whilst stifling laughter ""Doug, I know you always think you're right but I don't think you can tell your left hand from your right"", Doug clearly annoyed by this commented ""Well I only read a fucking magazine about this place, making the magazine wrong not me - I'm always right"" We all disagreed, but figured we shouldn't inflame Doug further by continuing what was becoming an argument. I tried to diffuse the situation saying ""C'mon guys this is meant to be a holiday, not a riot and bout of arguments"", this diffused the group's condition a bit and Emily gave me a pleasant smile for my unusually neat handling of the situation; unusual for me being quite unconfrontational normally.

The growing confrontation sorted for now, we finally decided to actually do what we had intended, explore the town hall. I said ""We should probably be wearing masks or something, its a bit damp"", Doug retorted ""Shut up with your medical nonsense, a bit of damp has never harmed anyone"". Almost falling through some of the rotten floorboards, we travailed up to the centre of the town hall. Finding nothing of interest really, some charming paintings on the walls being of most interest, and some inscriptions in Latin written on the walls which Andrew found fascinating, but not knowing how to discern Latin just took a photo for later examination. Bored by this time, and the weather looking quite pleasant from the dusty windows, we decided to set off to the beach which had been one of the original intentions of the trip, and enjoy some beers and maybe even brave the cool Atlantic waters.

Hopping in Doug's car, figuring that it being a tiny village a bit of slightly drunken driving wouldn't be too treacherous. The trip to the beach was short, although Doug's car was starting to show his shoddy alterations hadn't exactly improved it's performance. I said the car was a pile of rust and rubbish, which didn't improve Doug's mood from earlier but I thought was humorous nonetheless.

We settled down on the beach with: blankets, beers and some snacks I had brought from Exeter. Lounging there for hours, with us even venturing into what we found was quite an unusually warm sea, pleasant as it was. Leaving all of us a little confused - especially Emily, being a young geographer she thought the water was far too warm for that time of year, or any time of year at all. Eventually, it began growing dark and Evelyn insisted we get back to the cottage before it was too dark, probably remembering Doug's previous comment on the state of his headlights. They made it back safely, and after the day's excursion were tired and actually followed my advice from the night prior and we settled into a pleasant sleep before midnight.

Awakening on the crack of dawn, unusual for students and especially the night owl Emily. We had a quick breakfast, and I quietly suggested ""Maybe we should visit the church early today, so we can have another nice day on the beach, or even visit the cliffs above"". The group agreed, with Doug being especially excited as the town hall and church were his primary reasons for visiting the town initially. Little did they know, this is where their happy holiday turned for the worse.

The church was a short walk from the cottage, but at this point we realised we had not seen a single person since arriving in the village. Evelyn being the first to mention this fact ""I thought this village was meant to be a tourist hotspot, at least based on your magazine Doug"". Doug, as vehemently defensive of his proficient planning said ""Well, there was an advertisement for a village festival this week and they probably just all got a bit too jolly and are sleeping of their previous night's drinking, maybe its even turned into a camping trip of sorts. We might not see them all week!"". This seemed reasonable to me, small villages of this sort do tend to host these kinds of events, similar to the ones up in the highlands of Scotland near Lochs Tay and Lomond.

Upon reaching the church, it was a beautiful sight - cladded with aged marble, with intricate indentations in said marble and small, albeit aged statues of ancient characters: Moses, Christ, and strangely Icarus; famed for flying too close to the sun and tumbling to his untimely death. None of this bothered the group, aside from Andrew being the only one with knowledge of Icarus grew slightly unnerved, believing their fates may have became intertwined. Inside the church was again, similar to the town hall, a dilapidated and clearly unkempt building. But, with fascinating statues: a masterfully crafted statue of Caesar during his death throws on the ides of March, situated beside a small statuette of Romulus and Remus being weaned by their surrogate wolf mother (this being an originally Roman church), a painting of the vestal virgins - and all the other less unusual things you would find in a church. Emily exclaimed ""Despite the state of this place, it is absolutely beautiful, someone should really come back to this village and do it up, even pop it on Home's under the hammer"" I was the only one to laugh and agree to this frankly silly, perhaps sarcastic suggestion, continuing my flirtatious attitude towards Emily. The others in the mean had found something peculiar. Some floorboards (all being rotten within the building similar to the town hall) which seemed to have been the most recently placed and heavily secured. Doug and Andrew, both agreed to dig up the boards to see what was hidden beneath, maybe ancient treasure or some secret from the elder days. Andrew ever the bookish and scholarly man said ""These old churches tend to have large crypts, filled with corpses and coffins of wealthy men, worth checking out for sure"". I didn't agree, this church seemed strange, there was a strange odor in the air and a faint whisper which only I could hear, coming from beneath the floors of the church.

Doug, ever the handyman eventually broke through the boards revealing a set of stairs leading to a crypt of sorts. The group followed silently, the first thing being noticed by the party being a wall of skulls with a door set inbetween, in almost perfect symmetry. Emily remembered a passage from a story she had read as a child, and unusually not skittish as usual said ""These skulls likely belong to the priests and noblemen of the time. It was meant to be an honour to be entombed in such a noble church at the time"". Whilst Emily was waffling on, Andrew discovered scrolls and ancient books in a  partition of the crypt, which he packed into his rucksack to read later on, back at the cottage.

I, not normally of the suspicious sort, thinking of myself quite sensible was starting to grow wary of this crypt, I guess thats what being surrounded by partial corpses does to a young man. Doug then figured in his ever widening wisdom, along with Andrew (more centred by curiosity than brutality) proceeded to break down the door centred between the wall of skulls. 

What they found inside shocked us all, even Doug. An enclosed room, with skeletons wearing preserved togas, and disturbingly an image of the cross drawn in blood bordered by an icon of a three headed daemon. Finally, an image of Cerberus the three headed dog who guarded the entrance to Hades domain of the underworld, a mix of Christian and ancient Greek iconography. I, strangely for me once again said ""The men entombed here were probably just imprisoned for some heinous crime, or sacrilegious act subsequently going mad in the darkness they were confined within"". Figuring we had explored enough and all quite spooked by the whole affair (Andrew especially, but being a quiet character didn't say a word), decided to leave and head back to the cottage or beach for some rest. 

Whilst walking back through the church, making sure to maintain ourselves on the steadiest floorboards. Suddenly, Andrew fell through the floor - the group being obviously worried for their friend precariously made their way to the chasm which had formed where Andrew had fallen calling out his name as they went. The floorboards had concealed a chasm, thinking perhaps a concealed old well but Emily suggested flippantly (given the likely death of their friend) ""Perhaps this is why they founded this town, being built on an extinct volcano with warm generating nearby hot pools, mentioned in that magazine of yours Doug?"" The group had no response, and Emily despite her calm reaction to Andrew's sudden demise began to sob. Eventually saying they should leave the village immediately before anything else horrible happened. Our now smaller group, agreed.

We were all by this point distraught, at the presumed demise of Andrew and the generally increasingly supernatural nature of the village, still having not seen a single person. The car was packed up, and we drove back the way we came with Doug being cautious with his car as his 'alterations' were beginning to prove not exactly precise nor efficient. After an hour, we noticed we had passed the same signs multiple times. Then in horror to us all, 'Welcome to Anglesand', we had returned to the village. The opposite of our failed escape attempt, which was the aim of leaving and returning to Exeter.

Growing dark, exhausted by the day's strange events we retired early with Emily and I sleeping in the same bed as she was the most unsettled and required company. Despite all the goings on I was greatly pleased by this as I could finally embrace the girl I had dreamed of being with for years. None of us slept well, dreaming of daemons and creatures of the night which terrified all of us.

Meanwhile, Andrew regained consciousness at the bottom of the chasm which he had tragically found himself falling down earlier that day. A broken leg, light concussion and confusion around his location and a glowing red light beckoned him further into the cave, even in his condition curiosity was one of Andrew's many follies. Despite his injuries, he quickly as he could (a broken leg not being conducive to speediness), staggered towards the light. What he found was a shock to even the bravest of souls. The volcano sitting beneath Anglesand was not inactive, but in fact highly active; with liquid magma and fumes spitting forth from the pool of boiling rock which sat directly beneath the town. Andrew recalled the original town's people's exodus from the town and realised in a spitting gargle of angst; The Roman's entombed within the tomb were maddened by the fumes from the deep volcanic stream, with the following Anglo-Saxons having no knowledge of this, resettled the town and likely succumbed to the same fate. Hearing whispers, and approaching heavy footsteps, with a sense of dread - Andrew, exhausted, bruised, broken. Sat down leaning against one of the warm rocks of the cave and passed into a pleasant sleep, from which as far as we know, he never awakened.

We awoke on the 4th day, Doug ambitious as ever tried starting up his 'glorious' jeep, but his 'additions' had clearly not been sufficient enough, and the engine only lasted half the drive to the cliff we had planned on seeking aid and rescue from. Despite this, Evelyn said nervously, but with a highly affirmative tone ""We need to do something or we'll be stuck here till we die, and why are there no people here? I just don't understand"". I responded ""I agree this is turning into a folly but we should stay positive, maybe the people will return from the festival and direct us home"". This did little to console our group, and we headed to the cliff. Carrying the bare necessities, the last of our whisky, wine, beer and what little food remained. Upon which we found another unusual aspect of the village; the cliff was warm, similar in warmth to a lightly heated blanket. Emily, ever to have an explanation for anything geographical suggested ""Maybe the volcano isn't inactive, and is what drove the people from the town"". We couldn't disagree as none of us had a better explanation. Setting up a small camp (I neglected to bring a tent), we made a fire with the wood from the benches in the church hoping to flag down a boat. We slept roughly that night, with Emily and I coupling together once more, under a multitude of blankets, with Doug and Evelyn claiming the sleeping bags and sleeping closely between each other.

Once again, we awoke and in a surprising change of our fate spotted a boat. Ecstatic with our change in fortune, we flagged the ship down and it approached slowly. We stripped down to the bare minimum and slid down the cliff into the again surprisingly warm Atlantic sea. We swam embraced in a spasm of joy in circles awaiting the boat to arrive to save us from our horrible previously approaching fate. Sadly, the boat never came, and in fact was likely an illusion caused by the same madness which claimed the previous inhabitants of the town, Andrew being the only member of the group to suffer a similar fate; and probably by this point deceased or turned into the very daemon which cursed the town. What occurred afterwards we will never know, but if you ever see a sign directing you towards Anglesand, do not follow it and immediately turn around; as you will likely never return.",1,1733999814.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1hci8w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hci8w4/an_old_friend_on_christmas_dinner/,An old friend on Christmas dinner ,"I’m Mark, a 33-year-old chef turned food blogger, based in a small but picturesque town in Texas. My life, though once fast-paced, is now quiet and comforting. I live with my wife, Clara, who works as an elementary school teacher, and our 5-year-old daughter, Lily, who has her mother’s curly brown hair and infectious smile. We love the holidays—especially Christmas. It’s our tradition to host Christmas dinner for close family and friends, a ritual filled with laughter, love, and homemade recipes.

This year, however, was different. A few weeks before Christmas, I received a message from an old friend, Daniel. We hadn’t spoken in over a decade. He was a successful businessman now, but his words carried an uncharacteristic desperation. He wrote, ""Mark, I need a place to spend Christmas. It’s been a rough year. Can I join your dinner?"" Clara, always the kind-hearted one, insisted we say yes.

Daniel arrived on Christmas Eve. He looked thinner, with shadows under his eyes that told of sleepless nights. His suit was tailored, but his face was weary. Over a glass of wine, he told me about his divorce, failed ventures, and how he’d lost touch with most people he cared about. Clara suggested he stay for the night, and he accepted with a grateful nod.

The morning was perfect. Snow coated the streets, and the scent of cinnamon wafted through the house as Clara baked her famous apple pie. Lily, oblivious to the undertones of adult stress, excitedly helped me hang the last ornaments on the tree. Daniel watched quietly from the couch, his eyes distant.

As evening approached, the guests arrived. My parents, Clara’s sister, her husband, and a few neighbors filled our home with chatter and warmth. The dining table, adorned with flickering candles and festive decorations, was the centerpiece of the night.

Dinner was served. We feasted on roasted turkey, mashed potatoes, and Clara’s pie. But Daniel barely touched his plate. He kept glancing over his shoulder, as if expecting someone—or something. At one point, I caught him staring at the window, his expression pale.

“You okay?” I asked.

“Yeah… just tired,” he replied, forcing a smile.
As we moved to the living room for coffee and desserts, strange things started happening. First, the lights flickered, which we dismissed as a power surge from the snowstorm outside. But then Lily screamed.

“What’s wrong, sweetie?” Clara asked, rushing to her.

“Someone’s in the hallway!” Lily cried, pointing toward the darkened corridor.

I grabbed a flashlight and walked toward the hallway. Empty. I tried to laugh it off, telling myself Lily’s imagination had gotten the better of her. But deep down, I felt the prickle of unease.

Back in the living room, Clara was comforting Lily, who refused to leave her lap. Daniel sat rigidly on the couch, gripping his mug so tightly his knuckles turned white.

“You saw something, didn’t you?” I whispered to him, and he finally met my eyes.

“I’ve been feeling watched,” he admitted. “Ever since I arrived.”
By 10 PM, the guests had left, and the house was eerily quiet. Daniel asked if he could talk to me privately. Clara took Lily upstairs to bed, leaving us in the dimly lit living room.

“There’s something I haven’t told you,” Daniel began, his voice shaking. “A few months ago, I attended a séance. It was a stupid bet. I didn’t believe in that stuff, but… something happened. The medium said I had a presence attached to me, a spirit that wouldn’t let go.”

I stared at him, incredulous. “You’re kidding, right?”

“I wish I was,” he said. “Weird things started happening after that. Doors slamming shut, whispers at night, and… it followed me here.”

Before I could respond, we heard a loud crash from the kitchen. Rushing in, we found the entire rack of plates shattered on the floor. The room was freezing, our breath visible in the air. Clara joined us, clutching Lily, her face pale with fear.

“We need to leave,” she whispered.

But the front door wouldn’t budge. The windows wouldn’t open. It was as if the house itself had sealed us in.
The night descended into chaos. Shadows moved where they shouldn’t. Whispered voices echoed through the halls. At one point, Lily started laughing uncontrollably, staring at something none of us could see.

“Who are you talking to, sweetheart?” Clara asked, trembling.

“The man by the tree,” Lily replied, pointing to the Christmas tree. “He says he likes our house.”

I turned to look. For a split second, I saw it—a figure, tall and gaunt, with hollow eyes staring back at me. And then it was gone.

Daniel broke down, sobbing. “It’s him. He’s here.”

Clara and I huddled with Lily, trying to comfort her. Meanwhile, Daniel muttered apologies, his guilt weighing heavily. He believed he had brought this entity into our home, and he was right.

Around midnight, Daniel decided to confront the spirit. He stood in the middle of the living room, shouting, “Leave them alone! This is my fault. Take me, not them!”

The air grew colder, and the candles flickered violently. Suddenly, Daniel was lifted off the ground, his body convulsing. We screamed, helpless, as he was thrown across the room. When he hit the wall, the whispers stopped. The house fell silent.

Daniel lay unconscious, his breathing shallow. I checked his pulse—it was weak but present.

We spent the rest of the night in the car, waiting for dawn. Daniel was rushed to the hospital, where he recovered but refused to speak about what happened. He left town the next day and hasn’t contacted us since.

As for our family, we moved out of that house shortly after. Christmas has never been the same. We still celebrate, but there’s a shadow over the holiday now, a reminder of that night. I sometimes wonder if the spirit truly left or if it’s just waiting for another invitation.

Every Christmas Eve, I double-check the locks and keep a wary eye on the tree. Some gifts, it seems, come at too great a cost.

1hci7xo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hci7xo/3_years_a_dream_of_us_gone/,"3 Years, A Dream Of Us Gone.","You were my life. I gave you my all. I held you as you cried, I consoled you as you told me about your past traumas, even as it began to take a toll on me, I was there for you every single second. We both grew together, we were both teens without a plan. I grew because I had you in my corner. I started the gym, I changed my life from a wondering aimless teen to a driven ambitious man with you. I tried to bring you with me, I really thought that I did for a while, even as you continued to drown yourself no matter how hard I pulled you up. 

We were happy, we really were happy together. We talked constantly, we were inseparable. I stood by as you made mistakes, I stood by as you changed your plans multiple times, no matter how wrong I thought them to be, I supported you after making my feelings clear. I really thought this time was it, when you got accepted for tech I was beyond proud of you. 

Then you told me one day you didn't know if you just liked girls or not. I was heartbroken and devastated, and I gave you your time to decide. 

You let me keep my promise to bring you to your first day. You gave me this look after I said something loving, I thought it was a realization that you had decided to be with me. But it was really an ""oh shit"" look. You cheated on me. It wasn't a spur of the moment thing driven by alcohol, you told me this lie about being confused about your sexuality to cover yourself. You turned off your snap maps. You took the time I gave you to decide and used it to cheat on me. You went out multiple times with someone, you fucked them once that I know of.

I dragged the truth out of you after phoning you while you were out with him the same day I brought you to tech. I was broken, and hurt. You were emotional, you were regretful, you were.. I'm not sure how you really felt. You sent me paragraph after paragraph, you told me ""You know I'm the one who loves you the most"" you told me ""I can see us growing old together"" you told me ""I will do anything. I will literally sell my body every night just for you to forgive me""

And you know what? I believed you. I really did believe you. 

I took you back, I took you back and humiliated myself. Every person I knew and had told about what happened told me not to. I ignored every single one of them. I could care less what they thought, you were the one for me.

We had a good three weeks I think. One of my conditions was therapy for your need to lie, but from my perspective, it just seemed like a way to come after me. Every time you came out, I'd get shit. Every time.

Then it boiled over. We argued. I refused to back down and so did you. You ignored me for a day, and broke up with me the following day for my ""controlling"" behavior.

And then you went out with the guy the next day.

A guy who is worse by every metric, and not in a bad boy type of way. A guy who I'm pretty sure you aren't even with anymore, if you ever were.


I pushed too hard, I know that. I shouldn't have pushed so hard for you to come to the gym, for you to do this and to do that. I know that, but not one single thing I did was for my own self interest. I wanted you to be able to look in the mirror without crying, I wanted you to go a week without being sick because of you being underweight. I wanted you to see yourself the way I saw you. 

It's not fucking fair that I had to be your parent and boyfriend. It's not fair that your mother has no parental instincts, it's not fair that I had to fill in for her. It's just not fucking fair for either of us.

I was going to marry you. I was going to have kids with you, the image of our kids with your eyes haunts me.

I clinged on after you broke up with me, and I'm embarrassed by it. I told you you were dead to me in anger.


And today, I finally gave up my dream of getting you back, of pulling you out of the water. I asked to meet, you said you couldn't. We had a nice conversation over text, and I'm not sure how to feel. I blamed your mum, I blamed your friend, hell I blamed your fucking therapist. But today was confirmation that it was you in control, it always was and always will be.

You told me that in another reality, we were meant to be. 

But you are the one who is stopping us from being, not reality, not any gods, not the universe, not any person, not the government.

You, and you alone, are what's responsible for it.

I have to accept that I can't help you, I have to accept that you need to learn these lessons without me. You left tech after leaving me, I'm not sure how long after leaving me it was, but I was so disappointed when I found out. Then I see you awake at 3am morning after morning. 

That's what I think hurts me the most, the disappointment. I could manage if I knew you were having a good life, but from what I know, you aren't. If I was offered a deal for you to have a good life, but without me, I would take it in a heartbeat. It would be devastating, but I would do it. Because that's what love is, and I'm not sure you really ever understood that. 

My desire for violence against him is gone with my desire to help you. It just isn't there anymore. My mercy prevails over my wrath.

I would single handedly conquer the world for you, and you wouldn't even meet me for a coffee.

In all timelines, in all possibilities, only you.",1,1733999356.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1hci7cx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hci7cx/aita_for_not_wanting_the_gifts_my_husband_gives/,AITA for not wanting the “gifts” my husband gives me? Including a brand new car? ,"Tbh, I feel like an as*hole writing but I gotta know! Long story short, my husband(m25yo) whom I’ve been with since 2016 and married just this year, likes to “surprise” me(f27yo) with extravagant gifts. 

Now I’m not stating that I don’t appreciate these gifts as they’re very nice. The biggest one being a brand new car and the most recent one being a PS-VR headset. He’s very doting like that but this is where I’m kind of getting thrown off. Let’s dive into the deets shall we? 

To start off, we are poor. I know I know, the gifts suggest otherwise BUT it’s the honest truth. We don’t have a large savings, no house or stocks and not the best credit either. Living life the best we can paycheck to paycheck, he is blue collar but that is still relatively a recent development so not much actual capital gain as we are paying off our credit cards AND/OR he keeps living above our means. Now I’m no saint in this department either as we just had a discussion about my shoe collection. But I buy cheap, nothing over 20$ because again ~poor~ 
 
Now, because of his new job over the last 6 mo, my husband has left me and our child EVERY WEEK for the full week, to go work down south of the state. We only get to see him on weekends and that’s usually just Friday night, all of Sat. And then Sunday morning because he leaves for work to drive where ever Sunday afternoon. We get very little time together and sometimes even sacrifice spending time with our child by having them stay over at gmas just so we can be intimate. (Exhale)

Proceeding to the gifts! THE CAR is amazing honestly, I was driving a 20+ year old car prior and it was my turn for a new vehicle as my husband was on vehicle number 3 (wanting to sell and buy his forth one) to which I promptly refused and stated I needed a more reliable car for driving our child everywhere. He agreed wholeheartedly but this is where things get tricky. I LOVE LOVE LOVE my car, it’s gorgeous and not as expensive as I thought it would be but still about 15k more than what my budget was for car payments. Here’s the situation, he left and came back with the car one day. Put 1600$ down on it and handed me the keys. At the time he was making big money and that was a weeks worth of income for him (I know I’m pissed about it as well). Unfortunately when he handed me the keys, he said “happy birthday! (Month late) it’s $512 a month and that’s just the payment.” I know for some that might be cheap compared to what they’re paying and I’m really not trying to be ungrateful or unappreciative because he knows I don’t just jump the gun on these kinds of things. It’s just that if I’m the one making the payments, I should be the one to decide what car I’m getting and how much I’m willing to spend on monthly payments. I definitely wasn’t wanting to get a brand new car either for that exact reason as (again) I am poor. Even though we are married, we pay for our own bills, except rent. Since he’s the bread winner, he pays that. I, however, make just above minimum wage and pay for most of our child’s needs. I also stacked up a decent amount of debt on credit cards and am trying my best not to touch and pay them down to fix my credit. THE CAR IS NOT HELPING. 

Onto the most recent gift, remember how I mentioned all that time away from home my husband has been doing? Well I’m depressed MAJORLY about it. Like cry myself to sleep after our child goes to bed because I miss him so much. He’s usually too busy throughout the day to call or text which I understand; but at the end of the day he’s also way too tired to talk for longer than 30 mins (also understand). It’s almost completely radio silence all week. The thing is, and I’m probably just reading into it way too much but the past few weeks he’s come home, he walks in and immediately holds our child for extended periods of time. And gives me, his wife, a single quick peck on the lips. It’s literally making me insecure about whether my breath has been stinking or something. Idk, I love that he is a great father but I’m not getting that love and endearment that I so desperately need, even him just sitting next to me with one arm wrapped around my shoulder while he holds our child would be nice. I’ve voiced all of this to him and he seemed taken aback. Now in retrospect, I know it goes both ways but I always tell him in our brief conversations that I miss him and can’t wait to cuddle and hug on each other to which he always agrees. 

Moving onward, we agreed that we needed to spend more time together. Unfortunately this same weekend, my friends bday party was planned and I had to leave for the second half of Saturday. That’s basically a large chunck of time my husband will be home. Now we planned to spend the morning together and enjoy our time. My husband stated he would even wake up at 5 am to keep his work sleep schedule on track. I told him I was not waking up at 5 am (as this conversation was taking place at 1 am) and that 7 am would be a doable route. I then went on to lost all the things that would happen if he did indeed wake up that early. And wouldn’t you know it? I freaking called it! Now I’m not sure if my husband just did it out of spite or to spend the little amount of time with me possible. I of course don’t rub it in his face that I was right but here’s what happened. 

He woke up at 5 am, made coffee and ate breakfast. I woke up at 5:45 because I had to pee. He seemed alarmed that I was up but asked if I wanted to join him. Mind you, I’m a zombie just trying to empty the pressure in my bladder. So I politely tell him no Ty and asked him if he could instead wake me up at 7. Just give the zombie girl another hour of sleep pleaseeee. He did and even woke our child and we cuddled in bed for….maybe 5 minutes before he promptly passed out. I tried to stop it from happening telling him a few times that he can’t fall asleep but…well…I don’t blame him and even said it would happen. Still, wish he would have listened to my solid advice. 

So me and little baby go and have our brekky and I get my coffee. I’m out of things to do so I just do the next mom thing and start cleaning everything. 2 hours goes by (9am) and he’s still conked out. I’m scheduled to meet my friends at 2pm so we are running out of time. Still I let him sleep, cause he’s works hard and it’s his weekend and he deserves the rest and doesn’t need me ruining his sleep time. So me and baby dance and do reading time and typical playdate stuff with tons of dinosuars involved. I’m getting worn out so I put together a snack and turn on a show. It’s now 11am, and here comes sleepy head “why did you let me sleep in?” Well…why couldn’t you just wake up at 7? Anywho, he noticed I’m upset because at this point, I get basically 2 hours to spend with him but I’ll take what I can get ya know? Bday party is planed to go from 2 pm to 11pm. Loooooong day of Xmas shopping together and fun times. Well, he randomly asks me if I miss playing beat saver on our old Oculus, and I told him I did cause it was fun but that was years ago before we had a child. Hard game to play when I have to watch our child who isn’t 2 yet and gets into everything! 

After I state that I did miss it, he up and leaves, no words exchanged. I thought he probably forgot something out in his truck. Nope, turns on his truck and drives off. Then I think oh he probably just wants something to drink from the store and has been known to do that. Nope. I get a text about 5 min late that he’s decided to go Christmas shopping. I promptly reply “k” cause fml, I just wanted to spend time with my man and he knows this, and instead of just shopping at the same time I was going to be shopping, he leaves during our us time. 

For 1.5 hours. 

At this point I’m beyond pissed and just dgaf about whatever “gifts” he’s getting because ALL I WANT IS TO SPEND TIME WITH HIM. I’m laying down with our baby while he’s napping and this man comes walking into our room asking for 5 minutes before coming out. I know his typical go to moves and he’s setting something up. He returns and asks me to come see, I am excited but still pretty peeved about the whole thing. 

Now, the PS-VR headset is something HE wanted a month back. I told him it’s way too expensive and we already have more than we need in consoles, pc, monitors TVs the whole shebang. It was a WANT not a NEED. I for one also told him that we hardly ever played on the previous head set console and he agreed at the time. THIS MAN BOUGHT ONE AND PRESENTED IT TO ME AS A GIFT FOR “ME”. He also got a card, chocolates, flowers and my favorite wine. Now I loved all of it but the headset definitely felt like more of gift for himself. The message he wrote in the letter was bittersweet but also he made it very clear that he feels the time and distance away more than anyone else and just wants me to be strong as he’s sacrificing the most in this situation. I feel…on the fence about that. We’re BOTH sacrificing a lot for this job he has. He has to leave his family and go live in hotels for weeks at a time working long hours. I have to parent alone while working a full time job which is basically working from the time I wake up to when I go to sleep. I love our child but parenting is not for the weak of heart. Especially with our screeching dinosaur. 

My loving husband then proceeds to set up the ps-vr head set and leaves me to watch the child. Again. So I get ready and leave and have tons of fun with my friends. Now, this week while my husband was away at work, every. Single. Night. He would ask me if I played on the headset. Uhhhhhhhh NO?!? I have to watch our child and cook dinner and clean and prep for the following day and bathe said child and put said child to bed. From 5-8, that’s not a lot of time. By the end of it all I’m sleeping at 8 too! He seems mad now that I haven’t touched it and idk what to say? I only want to spend time with him and get out of the house and make memories together with our son. Also become financially stable and buy our first home together. I would also like to state that I buy my husband expensive gifts too, and he’s not the only one to blame for our current financial situation hence the credit cards but let it be known that I’m not some ungrateful wife who’s the only one receiving gifts in this relationship. 

So people of Reddit, AITA? I feel like I am but I also want to justify my feelings on what’s currently going on and/or how to approach it with my husband without sounding unappreciative or ungrateful. ",3,1733999285.0,AITAH,19,0.81,False

I don't know where to start, but I want to share with you all an incident that happened to me on December 8th at 8:00 AM at the Satya Sai iBus ticket booth. It was just a normal day, everything was fine, and I lined up to buy an iBus ticket from Satya Sai to Visnupuri. I gave a 200 RS note to the counter, the ticket fare came out to be 25 RS and along with the change (multiple 20Rs note), I got my ticket. But here's the catch: while I was about to leave for the iBus, which was just about to depart, I felt that something seemed off when the guy gave me the change. Thus, I recounted the notes and, to my surprise, instead of 175 RS, it was just140 RS(7notes of 20Rs) and a 5 RS coin. Seeing this, I thought to myself that maybe my math is not accurate this early in the morning, so I headed towards the counter, recounting notes while looking at the ticket maker at the booth. But I realized that it was not my early morning without coffee fatigue; this guy really tried to scam me. Upon approaching him, I saw him slowly shifting his hands around the counter and slightly moving the change in all coins towards me. When I asked him about how much the fare was and how much he gave me back, he gave me an excuse of, ""Oh, you forgot this change I've put here,"" and so on, while I knew that he didn't give me any at the start. But here comes another event that made my blood boil: instead of happily giving me my change, he insisted that he had given me the correct amount and accused me of lying. He asked for the money he gave me to be returned to him, so I complied and gave it to him. He recounted the money and gave it to me, but after I got the money in my hand again, I felt something was off as before there were many notes, now there were few, and when I counted it, instead of being 140 RS of 7 notes of 20 RS, it was just 4 notes of 20 RS. The good thing was, I was standing in front of him when he handed over the money to me. As I looked at him again, I saw the 10 RS coins he had placed in front of him slowly moving towards me. Then, in a louder voice, he said that he had put the change in front of me to collect. I replied, asking why he had taken the notes away when they were fine. Hearing this, he stumbled for a second and apologized. I collected my ticket, and while waiting for another bus, I saw him checking around the stop to ensure all the cameras were off or not watching him. He then returned to the booth.

After everything that happened and discussing with my friends at place, I learned that this is happening very commonly in Indore and If you do not pay attention, they will scam you too.

After this, I reimagined the situation and discovered how these guys got me in the first place.

toh ye log aise krte h ki dekhte h ki kya booth ke samne bheed hai ki nhi, fir dekhte bus khadi h ki nhi ya dusari wli kabh aane wli h( mere case me booth wle ko samne se hi dikh jata h signal pe khadi bus) , fir ye dekhte ki hadbadi kitni h( iss case me mere dost ko 150 ka chuna lga tha), fir ye dekhte tumne paise kitne diye, agar jyada badi rakam hoti let's say 100-200, toh ye scam hone ke chances increase ho jate h bahut jyada. abh hota h yha se scam, ye tumko ticket ke sath change denge aur change dete wakt ye ginte ginte bahar dekhega taki tum bhi uske sath dekho aur ussi beech ye note badalta upar neeche, aur h kabhi bhi badi note me nhi dete ye change ( 50rs,100rs ki notes me) hamesha 10 ya 20 ya kabhi kabhi 50.....fir tum paise loge aur socho ge ki bhai sahi diya hoga aur nikal jaoge.....tumhare jate-jate counter se bahar dekhna booth wla banda tumko dekhta rehta h jate hue, agar tum palte vapas toh voh jhaat se counter pe rakha change aage kr dega aur tumko lagega ki me bhul gya aur agar nhi palte toh voh dusare ko abh pakdne me baith jata aur aise ye scam chal rha h.

TLDR: I experienced an attempted scam at a bus ticket booth in Indore. The ticket seller gave me less change than I was owed, and when I pointed it out, they they had given the correct change and me of lying. The seller then tried to return the correct change, but I noticed the amount of cash had decreased. I also observed the seller trying to hide the security cameras, suggesting an attempt to cover up scam..

I suspect it might not be the best investment given that i plan to live here for the next 3 years at least. ,"Hey Reddit,

I’m a 40M, recently divorced, no kids, an immigrant living in the UK. I love living in the city and am currently dating around. I make £100k per year and have been eyeing a **one-bedroom flat** in Canada Water. It’s **570 sqft**, modern, bright, decently spacious, and part of a nice development with a beautiful view of Canary Wharf and London. It's got an amazing full view on Canary Wharf, and London, I can see everything except the south. The service charge is reasonable at £2500, and it has a great garden, rooftop, fully equipped proper gym, groceries, and coffee shops downstairs.

It’s also just a **15-minute walk to the Tube**, so overall, it’s pretty great.

The flat (6 years old) is priced at **£450k**, which felt like a good deal until the recent changes to **stamp duty relief for first-time buyers (FTBs)**. I'm about 75% (enquires have been raised) in so I will qualify for the current FTB rate which is just £1250 for me.

However, with the new changes, the short-term value of this flat might fall. My life plan was:

\- Live here for 3-4 years (when I estimate I might get re-married) and hopefully sell at at least 460k

\- If value falls, rent it out instead, but due to to taxes on rental income, I'd probably be losing out a bit by about £900 shortfall in mortgage payments

\- I can save roughly 2k a month, so in 3-4 years combined with my current savings I'd have close to £100k saved up for a new home purchase, hopefully with wife who might be able to contribute to that too.

However, with the reduced assistance, I’m now second-guessing the purchase. I’m worried that the value of the flat might drop in the near future, and I’m wondering if I should stretch my budget to **£500k (or slightly higher)** to get something more long-term, like a **two-bedroom flat**.

The two bed flat also allows my parents to visit for longer periods of time at a low cost since them staying in a hotel or airbnb for that time is expensive. Though with my 1 bed they can stay, as I can just sleep on the sofa, so mildly inconvenient but not a deal breaker.

I love the flat, but at £450k, but reading this forum and others have made me second guess it.

I know a two-bedroom would provide more flexibility for things like hosting, resale/rental appeal, or even a bit more room to grow.

However, if I switch to a 2-bed now, I'll likely have to pay the new stamp duty which would be £10k+

I’d love to hear your thoughts. Should I stick with this flat, or would it make more sense to pivot to a two-bedroom for better long-term value?

What low profile mechanical keyboard is sealed enough to withstand this sort of punishment, or has drainage holes, or can be recovered via replacement switches?
