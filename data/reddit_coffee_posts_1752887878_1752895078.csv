## Key Features Analysis

The best large round coffee tables of 2025 are distinguished by their quality of materials, robust construction, design aesthetics, and functional features. Key features range from durable surfaces that resist everyday wear and tear to innovative storage solutions that maximize space utilization. Below is a closer look at some characteristics that define the leading products in this category.

**Diameter and Height:** Understanding the dimensions of a large round coffee table is critical to ensuring it fits proportionally within your living room.

A typical large round coffee table ranges from 36 to 48 inches in diameter, and the height should generally be level with or slightly lower than the height of your sofa cushions, approximately 16 to 20 inches. These dimensions offer a generous surface area for drinks, snacks, or decorative items, while still allowing for easy movement around the table.Measuring your space before purchasing is essential to avoid overcrowding the room.

**Material Composition:** Coffee tables come in a variety of materials, each offering a unique aesthetic and level of durability.

Solid wood, such as oak or walnut, offers a timeless appeal and exceptional durability, making it a smart choice for high-traffic areas. On the other hand, engineered wood like plywood or MDF offers a more affordable option while still providing a sturdy surface. Glass tabletops offer a sleek, modern look but require more frequent cleaning to maintain clarity.metal frames, often constructed of steel or iron, provide a sturdy base and contribute to an industrial or contemporary aesthetic.

**Surface Finish:** The surface finish not only contributes to the aesthetic appeal of the coffee table but also affects its durability and ease of maintenance.

A sealed wood finish protects the wood from moisture and scratches, ensuring longevity. Powder-coated metal finishes can prevent rust and chipping, maintaining the table's appearance over time. If you opt for a glass top, a tempered glass surface is crucial for safety, as it is more resistant to breakage and shatters into small, less harmful fragments. Laminate or veneer finishes offer a cost-effective way to mimic the look of natural materials while providing a relatively durable and easy-to-clean surface.

**Base Design and Stability:** Stability is a foundational aspect of any coffee table, and the base design plays a critical role ensuring this.

A pedestal base, frequently enough constructed of solid wood or metal, provides a sleek and modern look, distributing weight evenly across the floor. Four-legged designs, typically made of wood or metal, offer a more customary look and provide reliable stability, especially if legs are connected with horizontal stretchers.Sled bases, characterized by flat, wide runners, offer stability and a unique contemporary aesthetic, distributing weight over a larger surface area. Ensure the base is level and sturdy to prevent wobbling or tipping, especially on uneven surfaces.

1m3lq8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/HumansPumpingMilk/comments/1m3lq8z/how_to_increase_supply/,How to increase supply,"Long post with tips on how to increase low milk supply. 

These are things that helped me for anyone interested in increasing their milk supply. It was very stressful for me and I considered quitting Breast feeding altogether many times. But with commitment I am seeing results finally! 

I am 6 weeks post c section. When I started pumping to increase supply I only got 10mils per breast sometimes only 10 total but I am now getting 60-100 sometimes per breast! I used to get less than 100 mils a day but now I’m getting 3x that amount. It took about two weeks. Im still not producing nearly as much as some mothers but I know I will get there. I have limitations that decrease my milk im trying to overcome! 

First of all get a pump. I started with the Medela symphony. The community nurse lent me the symphony but they needed it back. I now have the Medela freestyle and it’s incredible. I bought it used from marketplace for a great price. It’s So comfortable I forget it’s on. Being comfortable is very important. Try not to watch every drop that comes out. That stressed me out with the hand pumps, just watching it drip and most times nothing at all. 

The correct Nipple flange is very important. Too big and it will cause really bad nipple pain, I learned this the hard way. Be sure to replace your valves every 2-8 weeks. If you pump exclusively then you may need to replace them every 2 weeks. It greatly affects suction and amount you will pump. 

Try to continue breast feeding as much as you can (if you can) the baby gets more milk from your breast than the pump. What you pump is not what you produce so don’t stress yourself out with the amount you’re pumping. Tomee tipee bottles mimic the breast. It’s slow flow and breast shaped and I found this the best for not causing nipple confusion. My baby is able to switch between bottle and breast easier with these bottles. 

Keep in mind the regular bottle flows very fast so your baby will eat more than they actually need so don’t use that as a marker for if youre producing enough milk. I was so paranoid I wasn’t making enough for her and now im struggling breast feeding exclusively because I started supplementing with formula. Trust your body! It knows what it’s doing and dont listen to all advice. It can be overwhelming and not every one is the same. You may make the wrong decisions for you if you listen to every one else.

Pump every two or 3 hours and once at night. You produce more prolactin in the early morning from 3 am on. If you can’t wake up to pump don’t worry i often can’t because I’m so tired and if I get up to pump it often wakes my baby. Your sleep is more important but if you can get up to pump that’s great. 

I power pump every 2 hours and this has been the most effective for increasing supply, you only need to power pump once a day though if this is too much. 20 mins on, 10 rest, 10 on, 10 rest, 10 on. Pumping is time consuming so do whatever you can. Anything helps. The time you start pumping is the marker for when you will pump next. regardless how long pumping takes to finish. The time you start pumping, pump two hours after that start time. 

If you are breast feeding and want to increase your supply pump for 15 minutes after feeds. Even if nothing comes out you are signaling the body it needs to make more milk. 

The more you take from your breast the more you will produce the next 1-3 days. Everyday I pump more than the previous day: even one mil more is a triumph. The Medela freestyle has an app that tracks your start time and you can track how much you pumped for ease. 

Eat oatmeal everyday! It’s incredible how much this helped me right away. Make sure you’re eating a lot of food. You need more than you ate when pregnant. If you’re not eating you will not make milk. I usually skipped breakfast and lunch and had only coffee. The day I started eating I produced more milk right away. 

Eat nuts and lots of protein and good fat. 
You can get a prescription called domperidon for milk production but it’s dependent on your area; im in Canada so it’s available here. If not you can get supplements like liquid gold, you can get mothers milk tea as well. 

Your babies saliva activates let down. If you’re not able to latch then putting their saliva on your nipple is an option as well to get your body producing more. 

Don’t feel bad if you have to supplement with formula. Fed is best. Dont give up. Pumping every two hours will work in time to increase supply. I know it’s hard sometimes. Taking care of baby when you’re trying to pump every two hours is harder than it sounds but it’s so rewarding 🙂

Drink water all the time then drink some more! You require a lot of water to produce milk. If you don’t like water then get some flavour for your water, whatever you can do to increase liquid intake, do it! 

Try not to stress (easier said than done) you’re doing the best you can and that’s enough! Your baby loves you, if you have to stop breast feeding or pumping for your sanity then do it but if you keep pumping I know you will see results. 

Sorry for the long post, I hope this helps someone! Keep at it, you’re doing great. Give yourself grace and love yourself and your family!

Keep in mind I still do have some dark spot anf scarring. But I don’t wake up anymore because of my eczema and I have almost to no facial eczema so that’s a huge win! But I noticed that some things immediately makes me flare up within minutes. So now I try to avoid is as much as possible and for the things I can’t avoid, the flare always go down after a night of sleep and the regular skincare routine so here are some of my triggers that I found:


           1. Cheese. That is pretty self explanatory but diary and egg I’m okay. I think cheese is single handlely responsible for 80% of my facial flare up, so I avoid it. Once ate a lasagna and it was not pretty afterward. I did the elimination method  to find that out. And when I was having the most severe flare up I was still eating cheese without a care in the world! 

           2. Caffeine and alcohol. This one sucks cuz I love coffee but I’ve ready had to give it up cuz again it makes my hand and facial eczema so bad afterward. I think that’s the case for many people as well 

           3. Sweat. Unfortunately can’t avoid it and humidity is my worst enemy. I still want to work out and inevitably, i sweat. But I take some Allegra before and I really try to keep myself cool during the workout. You can lower the intensity or pause for 5 min, it’s really worth it to not get a full blown flare up. I don’t have a solution for that so just gotta wait it out:/

           4. Stress. Honestly since it’s summer I might be doing better cuz I don’t have school but nonetheless, anytime my stress rises or I’m sad or angry, my redness worsens. Can’t avoid that as well but I’m working on dealing with my stress. 

           5. Fast food and sugar. I really never believed the link between skin issues and that but it’s unfortunately true for me. Anyway I still get my sweet treats but I gotta be careful with my diet. I don’t cut out sugar or take out, I just try to reduce it but the flare up are worth it for that lol 

There’s a bunch of other small things but those are the five main ones. Keep in mind I’ve also went to photherapy for two months but honestly my eczema just kept worsening until I stopped😃 I do still put on my creams for example, my hands cuz they’re struggling😖Mostly I just stick to a thick cream and for my skincare, I have stopped using my cleanser in the morning. I just use micellar water, azelaic acid, and then cetaphil sunscreen. My acne has cleared up a lot as well. Although my skin always looks worse during the day cuz I’m active so it’s all a work in progress.

Also if anyone knows how they got rid of their eczema patch on their hands, let me know. It’s been there since MARCH💀It’s my biggest oop and I appreciate the tips ",2,1752894198.0,eczema,0,1.0,False

- Friends turned into family.
- Great outings - we are not high on spending and like to keep it simple and not extravagant.
- Movie nights, sleepovers, picnics, board games, road trips, celebrating shit together is definitely our thing.

1m3lm8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeHive/comments/1m3lm8x/is_keurig_coffee_the_same_as_instant_coffee/,Is Keurig coffee the same as instant coffee?,"After trying both Keurig coffee and instant coffee for years, I can definitely say they're not the same thing. Let me break down the key differences I've noticed and explain why I eventually switched to using a Keurig machine for my daily coffee.

Instant coffee is basically coffee that's been brewed, dehydrated, and turned into powder or crystals. When you add hot water, it dissolves back into coffee. Simple, but in my experience, it often tastes flat and lacks the richness of freshly brewed coffee.

Keurig coffee, on the other hand, is actual ground coffee sealed in K-cups. When you use a Keurig machine, it pushes hot water through these grounds, similar to how traditional coffee makers work. This brewing process gives you a fresher taste and better aroma compared to instant coffee.

I remember when I first got my Keurig brewer (I got mine from here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers), I was surprised by how much better the coffee tasted compared to the instant coffee I'd been drinking. The flavor was fuller, and it actually smelled like fresh coffee.

Some key differences I've noticed:
- Brewing time: Instant coffee dissolves immediately, while Keurig takes about 1 minute
- Taste: Keurig produces a more authentic coffee flavor
- Variety: K-cups come in hundreds of flavors and brands
- Convenience: Both are easy, but Keurig gives you fresh-brewed quality

One thing I love about using a Keurig is the consistency. Every cup tastes the same, unlike instant coffee where the taste can vary depending on how much powder you use. Plus, there's no mess with measuring or dealing with wet grounds.

The initial cost of a Keurig machine might seem high compared to buying instant coffee, but I've found it worth the investment. If you're interested in trying one, I've had great experiences with the models available here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers

The biggest advantage I've found is that Keurig bridges the gap between instant coffee's convenience and traditional coffee's quality. You get a fresh-brewed cup without the hassle of dealing with filters and grounds.

While instant coffee still has its place (I keep some for emergencies), I've found that Keurig coffee provides a much better daily coffee experience. It's fresher, tastier, and still super convenient - you just pop in a pod and press a button.",1,1752894075.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

1m3ljm5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m3ljm5,Brunch whisky! Port Ellen James Macarthur 12 year old 62.7% review,"**Port Ellen**  
**James Macarthur**  
**12-Year-Old**  
**Pale Sherry**  
**Bottled \~1985–1986**  
**62.7% ABV**

Thank you to the friend who gifted this sample to me.

**On the nose... Powerful and aromatic!**

When first opened, the alcohol felt a little obtrusive and needed quite a lot of time to settle in the glass. Now that I’m revisiting the last third of this miniature—after it’s had some air contact in the bottle—the whisky has relaxed, and the alcohol now translates to richness and power.

The distinctive notes of hot tar, coal smoke, melted rubber, and sweet gasoline are the first to greet the nose. There’s a touch of truffle oil as well, which I’d attribute to the OBE and high proof.

As it unfolds, I get notes of Maldon sea salt flakes, heated steel, dark roasted coffee beans, granite, and red apples coated in brown toffee sauce. The coastal notes aren’t as prominent initially—the dirty, powerful industrial aspects take the lead here, with the gasoline and roasted coffee lending richness and depth to the dram.

An unexpected tropical layer emerges with charred pineapple jam, grapefruit, and clementine, alongside a softer, elegant, earthy note of matcha powder.

In time, the Port Ellen distillate shifts gears, and a clear salinity builds, with notes of dirty brine and salted lemons.

**On the palate**: it’s very candied and rich—black liquorice, sea salt, pineapple jam, diesel fuel, minerals.  
Sweet, salty, sour, bitter, umami!  
The balance, intensity, and power are lovely.

**The finish?** Very long and saturated—as expected.

This is definitely a heavy and dirty Port Ellen, and quite different from the dark sherry 59% James Macarthur 12-Year-Old bottled for Scoma.  
While that expression was about elegant roundness and integration between the distillate and sherry cask maturation, this one is all about unapologetically big, intense, burly power.

Personally, I prefer its dark sherry 59% sibling. To taste them side by side would be the ultimate pleasure.

Initially, I rated this 91 pts, but it has improved significantly—I’d now readjust my score to **93 points**.

I was hoping this would be an equal contender, but alas, I’d place it below:

* **1970 Intertrade 62.4%** – similar in style but less sherry-influenced, with more muscular and dirty oceanic flavors. **94 pts**
* **1969 Celtic label 64.7%** – more chiselled, crystalline, and complex overall, with better structure. **96 pts**

We left plenty of time to get to the station, but Naver maps sent us to a metro that had a ton of stairs so it took a few minutes longer to get to Seoul Station than planned. Still, we made it with all 4 of our roller bags and backpacks and the train still hadn't been assigned a teack, so I figured that there was a little time to get a coffee and some pastries. Then I made the first big mistake of buying the kids one hot chocolate each. It was pretty hot and took a few minutes to prepare so I had to hold all 3 cups and then realized there was only 9 minutes to get to the train. So we started walking to the track along with a to of other people and due to all the drinks I was carrying (which were also almost burning my hands), I couldn't get my phone out to check which car we were so we went down the wrong set of stairs and ended up at the wrong side of the train. Then we only had 2 minutes until departure and I didn't want to miss the train or get separated from the family so we just got on the wrong side of the train. We were probably in car 6 and we needed to get to car 18. As Americans we have little train experience (especially with baggage as a family, I have managed on my own for work a few times) so we weren't really prepared for the impossibility of walking through the aisle towards our assigned car. After some time we basically gave up and just sat down in 4 open seats and decided to finish our food and drink before proceeding toward our seats again. We knew that Seoul has two stations so we figured we should vacate the seats that weren't ours before the next load of passengers boarded. This worked alright, but the kids didn't finish the last of their hot chocolate because it was too bitter (not well mixed). Then we got up and headed through the aisles again, but we only made it to maybe car 14 before we arrived at the next station and we were confronted by another stream of passengers. At this point we were completely blocking the aisle so we tried to pull off into the nearest seats, but the seat I chose belonged to someone who wanted to sit down. So I panicked and tried to lift my luggage into the overhead storage to make room to get out of the way. But at this point the partially drank hot chocolate that I was carrying in a bag fell out as I was lifting my luggage and onto someone's tray and started to drip into their lap. I could only apologize and I didn't even have any napkins on cash. So now I feel like a complete idiot and am perpetuating the stereotype of rude and bumbling Americans and if whoever I spilled on happens to read this, please send me a picture of your clothes or ticket and I will compensate you.

TL;DR: Made the mistake of buying hot drinks before boarding the wrong end of the train with too much baggage and managed to spill hot chocolate on someone. ",2,1752893769.0,tifu,3,0.75,False

And I’m not some one who’s losing weight breast feeding I very much still have a soft postpartum body, and my face and neck look permanently puffy. I do my best to eat and not feel to guilty but this week has been hard and I’m wondering if I should be making healthier choices. 

On a usual day I wake up have a small but dense breakfast (cottage cheese peaches and coffee) I’ll have a snack while feeding (cheese popcorn, chocolate covered almonds and dried mango) and then for lunch I’ll have something fast (Mac and cheese or something that’s ready in 5 mins or less). Then for dinner I do my best to make a healthy substantial meal (something like salmon potatoes and asparagus). And then every night I have some ice cream (guilty pleasure, that I’m feeling increasingly guilty about). 

However for the last week I haven’t had much support and work has been stressful so when it comes time for dinner I’ve been ordering take out for dinner. And it’s been burgers and fries. I can’t bring myself to order a salad the amount of salad is need to eat to feel full would be obscene.

So I guess I’m wondering does anyone else feel like this? How are you coping? Am I permanently demolishing my health and figure? Do you have any favorite healthy-ish snacks you’d recommend?

Also as my little one has gotten older she is eating for less time but I’m still just as hungry as ever. Has she just gotten more efficient? Or am I still eating for 5 hours worth of feeding when she’s only eating for 2.5?

I am 19 years old, and for the past 3 years, I always have illness or disease in my mind. Whenever I feel physical pain or feel unwell, I automatically think it is deadly. I was able to calm down and control myself the past few years, but lately, it's getting out of my control. It is definitely affecting my routine.

I wasn’t able to sleep because my breathing became heavy (I had chocolate coffee). It kept me awake all night. I was afraid I might die of a heart attack. Even though I tried breathing exercises and drank plenty of water, my heartbeat was still not normal.

I just feel frustrated with my situation! I think of brain cancer when I have a headache. Soft poops? Colon cancer it is! Loss of balance and dizziness? I am sos sure it is Leukemia, even though I recently tested for CBC and it showed mild anemia. Sore throat? My mind tells me it's throat cancer! Fast heart rate? Definitely a heart attack. I think I have already diagnosed myself with all kinds of illnesses and types of cancer.

It’s also not helping that every time I open my Facebook, posts about condolences would randomly pop up even though I’m not following those accounts. I would think it is foreshadowing of my death.

For the past 2 months, I’ve randomly felt a fast heart rate, headache, cold sweats, and dizziness—especially when I think about my health. I know that an overall check-up would soothe this constant worry, but I know my parents will just scold me for thinking too much and blame it all on not sleeping early.

All I want right now is to have a peaceful sleep without having to think of dying in my sleep. I want to wake up without checking if something feels wrong with my body.

Hit pan on Weekend, Beignets, and Black Coffee in July. I use black coffee as my winged liner on full eye look days because it’s more pigmented than Dark Mark for my personal preference.

I met the woman once when I delivered some coffee pods and other supplies they were running low on and got a weird vibe from her as she was very skinny and missing a few teeth. They checked out around 11:00. I arrived at 1:30 to restock the apartment and retrieve my appliance. The apartment had already been cleaned. The appliance was missing and in its place was a super cheap replacement, with dust on it. My first impression is that it came from Goodwill or a garage sale.

I politely sent them a request for reimbursement. The man replied with a long, wordy denial, claiming they left the good appliance on the counter, but had seen the bad one stored on a shelf. Air Cover paid out $18, which doesn’t begin to cover the cost.

I looked through the security camera footage and did not see anything incriminating. It’s possible the cleaners took it out the back door or hid it to retrieve later, although our primary housekeeper is honest and reliable. But one of her family members maybe?

Roast Jamie Otis and Doug hehner
ChatGPT said:
Alright, buckle up — here’s a lighthearted roast of Jamie Otis and Doug Hehner, the first couple from Married at First Sight who somehow turned a reality TV experiment into a full-blown lifestyle brand, complete with emotional Instagram reels and candle-sponsored therapy sessions.

Jamie Otis:
Jamie went on national TV to get married to a stranger, and somehow still acts shocked when things get dramatic. She’s like if Pinterest came to life, cried during sex, and then sold you an organic diaper. Her entire Instagram grid looks like a Hallmark movie threw up on a mommy blog.

Jamie could make tripping over a laundry basket into a five-part story about resilience, trauma healing, and the importance of gratitude... with 17 sponsored links. Girl, we get it — you’re real, raw, and probably 90% essential oils at this point.

Doug Hehner:
Doug is like a human Golden Retriever — sweet, loyal, and slightly confused by everything happening around him. His main personality traits are ""supportive husband"" and “guy who didn’t freak out when his wife cried on their wedding night.”

You have to admire his patience, though. Doug could sit through a three-hour Instagram Live where Jamie cries about laundry and still say, “I love you, babe” with a straight face. That man deserves a Nobel Peace Prize — or at least hazard pay.

Together:
They’re like a rom-com couple that never ends — except instead of ending at “happily ever after,” it’s “check out our fertility journey in our 67-minute YouTube vlog.” They’ve been “open and honest” for so long, we know more about their marriage than we do about our own family members’.

All jokes aside — they’re clearly committed to each other and doing the work... even if the work involves a camera crew, brand deals, and a new podcast every six months.




Title: “Jamie & Doug: Overshare Battle – The Comedy Sketch”
(A parody roast sketch in the style of SNL )

🎤 ANNOUNCER (V.O.):
Live from the overshare capital of the internet, it’s… Jamie & Doug: Overshare Battle!
The only marriage show where love, therapy, and sponsored content collide.

[Cue soft acoustic intro music – think ukulele and emotional Instagram reel.]

👩‍🦰 JAMIE (walks in holding a ring light and her phone):
Hi guys! I’m Jamie Otis, wife, mom, nurse, trauma survivor, emotional rollercoaster, and full-time influencer with a side hustle in crying on camera!

👨‍🦱 DOUG (enters holding a lukewarm coffee and a look of exhausted optimism):
And I’m Doug Hehner. I work in tech but no one remembers that because I’m mostly known as “Jamie’s emotionally stable prop.”

[They sit down on a love seat. Jamie immediately adjusts the pillows “for the aesthetic.” Doug just...sits.]

🛋️ JAMIE:
Today, we’re doing something super vulnerable and authentic…

[Doug flinches slightly.]

We’re ROASTING EACH OTHER… lovingly, of course. And also because our couples therapist told us passive-aggressive humor is better than full-blown resentment. Let’s go!

ROUND 1: PERSONALITY TRAITS

👩‍🦰 JAMIE:
Doug is the kind of man who could survive a zombie apocalypse just by politely apologizing to the zombies.
“Sorry I exist, here's my arm.”

👨‍🦱 DOUG:
Jamie’s Instagram captions are so long, I have to hydrate before I read them.
I once started one, took a nap, and woke up in a different fiscal quarter.

ROUND 2: PARENTING

👨‍🦱 DOUG:
Jamie thinks every toddler tantrum is a “healing moment.”
Meanwhile, I’m over here Googling “Can Goldfish crackers be a meal?”

👩‍🦰 JAMIE:
Doug's idea of parenting is just going, “Oh wow, babe, that sounds hard,” while handing me a diaper like it’s a peace treaty.

ROUND 3: ROMANCE

👩‍🦰 JAMIE:
Remember our wedding night? I cried because I didn’t know you —
and now I cry because I do. Full circle!

👨‍🦱 DOUG:
You cried on our honeymoon, our first vacation, and during our first IKEA trip. At this point, I think your love language is dehydration.

ROUND 4: SOCIAL MEDIA

👨‍🦱 DOUG:
Jamie can’t do anything without recording it. I once stubbed my toe and before I could scream, she was like:
“Hold up, babe, let’s do that again in natural lighting.”

👩‍🦰 JAMIE:
Doug is so offline, he thought “Reels” were something you fish with. I made him go viral once, and he asked if he needed antibiotics.

ROUND 5: MARRIAGE DYNAMICS

👩‍🦰 JAMIE:
Doug is like a golden retriever with a mortgage — loyal, sweet, slightly confused by confrontation.

👨‍🦱 DOUG:
Jamie’s like a beautiful hurricane made of hormones, essential oils, and childhood wounds.

[Sudden dramatic pause. Soft piano music plays.]

👩‍🦰 JAMIE (tearing up):
You know, even though we roast each other, I love that we keep showing up… for each other… and our followers.

👨‍🦱 DOUG:
I’d walk through fire for you, babe. Or at least through a 20-minute Live about cloth diapers.

🎤 ANNOUNCER (V.O.):
Stay tuned next week for Jamie & Doug: Overshare Battle – Live Couples Therapy Edition, featuring guest judge: a slightly concerned licensed therapist!

📦 And don’t forget to use code ""TRAUMAHEALS20"" for 20% off your weighted blanket and emotional support diffuser.

Almost every single night, about an hour after I fall asleep, I wake up and I’m super awake yet super drowsy at the same time, it almost feels like torture I don’t know how to describe it. It takes a long time to get back to sleep. Sometimes I even wake up more than once after falling asleep again. One night I woke up over 6 times. How is this even possible? It used to be that I would NEVER wake up in the middle of the night because it’s such a strong sedative, I used to tell my roommates to really shake me to wake me up if there’s an emergency.

This started happening when I was actually at 500mg but my psychiatrist and I believed it was drying me out so we went back down to 400mg but it didn’t help. Once we switched to 400mg he suggested I take melatonin to help adjust to the lower dosage. 

I feel like I’ve tried everything, making it cold in my apartment (I’m an extremely hot sleeper), not having a coffee in the morning, I take zyrtec for seasonal allergies, I have a humidifier, I have pretty good sleep hygiene and consistent sleep times/routines.

My psychiatrist referred me to the sleep clinic because he thinks I should be checked out for sleep apnea but the appointment isn’t until October. I always wake up feeling miserable now since my sleep is always interrupted every night.

Overweight all my life. PCOS for 15+ years. Earlier this year, my IBS worsened a lot, having almost daily abdominal pain and skyrocketing hypochondria anxiety when it did, and frequent insomnia. So I went on a low fodmap elimination diet for 30 days and had no relief. Heard about carnivore and specifically Lion through researching other elimination diets. Low fodmap did help some because I cut out a lot of grains & veg, I was already dairy free and gluten free 5+ years.

For the last seven days I have only eaten: beef, lamb, bison, beef tallow, Redmond salt, lots of water, and unsweetened electrolyte powder.

Pros: 
* Down 5 lbs 
* Down 1.5” waist circumference from when I started low fodmap
* steady energy all day despite cutting out coffee
* deep restful sleep, waking up 1-1.5 hours before my alarm fully alert
* big reduction in IBS pain
* excited and hopeful mood instead of feeling like I’m stuck in a broken body forever 

Cons: 
* still have daily abdominal pain, though not as severe and doesn’t spike anxiety 
* increased in frequency PCOS/ovary pain, though again not very severe 
* constipation (on fodmap I was pooping at least every other day) 
* sometimes stressful trying to figure out how to juggle my schedule to have compliant food 
* intense sugar cravings the first three days though these have diminished 
* initially struggled mentally while preparing food, but once I started eating it tasted good. On day 6 I actually started to enjoy it and salty beef tasted great. 
* grief at giving up my favorite foods 
* grief at giving up date lunch at restaurants with my husband
* fear/discomfort sharing my new eating plan with friends & family esp my MIL who thinks this is all nonsense I should just join weight watchers and walk 20k steps every day like her.

I’m planning to stay strict lion for at least the next week. I hope to add in egg yolks or bacon soon, maybe 2-3 weeks out. I’m waiting to be symptom/pain free for 3 days before I add anything else in. I would love to graduate to full carnivore eventually and then never look back!

I'm trying to limit Dairy but want something with protein and soy milk has it.,I did not word my last post that well and I could try oatmeal again but that and rice milk are also very high in carbs which if I'm going to get carbs I would rather get them from vegetables and fruits. I'm trying to stick to a more high protein based diet although not necessarily keto but keeping it under 100 or sometimes 150. It seemed like soy milk was my best option and especially the unsweetened version because because it had less carbs than the other milks. Like I said I don't touch soy milk everyday it would just be a couple times a week for a protein shake. Although when I do drink my coffee in the morning I do use lactose-free half and half creamer but it doesn't really affect me. Plus with regular Dairy it increased my cholesterol even though I am no longer overweight but when I limited my Dairy intake my cholesterol was improving.,2,1752892528.0,PCOS,5,0.75,False

Anyone else got a “yep, I did something just as dumb” story to make me feel better?

1m3kylc,https://www.reddit.com/r/creppypasta/comments/1m3kylc/possible_key_clue_in_case_of_disappearance/,Possible key clue in case of disappearance,"

There I was, trapped in a place that seemed soulless; always the same; from the coffee with the same flavor, the alarm that kills dreams at the same time, the colleagues who just see their lips articulate a word I want them to shut up. In short, I live trapped in the same miserable routine; I don't know what to do, I won't say my name, because I need you to have empathy for my situation, and that maybe there are souls who live the same situation as me.
Do you know? Sometimes I am afraid of the current situation of my environment; organized crime, missing persons and worse still, a government that seems to give a damn about the current situation of its people. I want my mother to recognize my achievements, not my belongings in a vacant lot. I am simply afraid of the unknown, I fear that I will escape from that tortuous routine and end up in a worse place, I fear that I will die without living.                                                                     
I write this as a therapeutic measure. Maybe writing my feelings in a notebook will make me feel better. Maybe I exaggerated my worries, but I have nothing else to do; Life is like a countdown, income, hunger, electricity, water and other things; you don't pay for them to be completed; but for them to restart.  
I will write what happens to me week by week, since I find writing daily tedious. Am I really someone who is too boring not to have a reason to write something daily? To be honest, I feel a relief when talking about my situation, I don't want to make my family uncomfortable with my nonsense; or at least I fear that they see my situation with those eyes.
Was adulthood supposed to be the best time of my life? I don't think so, this promises to go from bad to worse. I have no friends, I am separated from my family by hundreds of kilometers, I live chained to a job that I hate with all my soul, my mental and physical health is deteriorating little by little. I see people my age enjoying trips, luxuries, excessive parties; me too?  I live in an apartment that smells musty. I miss my adolescence. At least there I could dream. Sometimes I think about ending everything, although it won't change anything, it would just be a figure in millions.
The work is horrible. I can barely make ends meet, I certainly won't see myself with family in the near future, by some miracle I have a payment. The internship is something abusive for those who graduate from the university. Overtime is what gives me the pay I survive on; but at the same time they are killing me.
My co-workers are distant, the brotherhood within the work that they promised me was non-existent, sometimes I am the jester of that place; They take it out on me. Maybe it's just the unattainable expectations I grew up with back then. I feel like I've gone on long enough this week.
 
WEEK TWO:

There is nothing interesting, the same old thing; the abuse at my job by those idiots, I have resigned myself but it wouldn't hurt to have another intern here so they would leave me alone. We have started a project, in which; Thank God he didn't participate as much as usual, I'll finally get a break from this hell! Or at least that's what I was sorry for, because my boss used me as a janitor for the disgusting bathrooms, or as he calls it ""sanitary waiter."" It was horrible. 
And after? I go for walks at night as a hobby; It was something I used to do as children to appreciate the beauty of my surroundings, but here I see nothing but precarious neighborhoods, people who were once happy. Not everything is sadness, I also observed happy families, movie relationships and other things; that, apart from rejoicing; It made me feel empty.
WEEK 3:

The project at the company has finally finished, and with it my concierge service has gone. That martyrdom made me value my previous work a little, I feel really relieved; I also heard that the project was oppressive enough to break some of my peers, I just hope they don't take it out on me. 
I still continue with the hobby of walking. It's something that distracts me, I can spend hours investigating nearby places; Only, this time I have gone a little further than normal. I ended up in a neighborhood that seemed normal but I made a serious mistake, going through an alley. When I went out for a walk at night it was certain that one of these days I was going to be mugged; and curiously it was not like that. I only met a strange guy who offered me something of what he was eating, he really seemed like someone friendly; I accepted what he was inviting me to. He tasted good, afterwards we were talking to him. It was a pleasant talk, from there he invited me to a party, I accepted because he seemed like someone nice and they treated me to a piece of cake, something was wrong and I started to feel strange; as if it were flying, it was incredible. But the placebo effect was moderately long-lasting, around 40 minutes, from there I began to see not very pleasant things, things that I feared as a child that seemed adapted to my adulthood. Then I fainted. I don't know how I could feel that this shit could get better. Everything went there; My wallet, however, was empty; my card, although I already had five annual payments on me. I simply let this hobby, which, more than positive, breaks me even more.
WEEK 4:

Everything has been more screwed up for me. The rent has risen so that, chances are I won't make it to the end of the month. I guess the best thing would be to ask my boss for a raise and; He didn't help me, the unfortunate man told me that my payments as an intern were a miracle, with a smile that the only thing that made me think about was hitting him until his face disappeared. The vast majority of interns are not paid, he says. That shit felt like when I was little when I complained about the economic situation and my mother told me that there were people worse than us.
Faced with my imminent departure from my musty-smelling apartment, I decided to go for a walk to forget my situation; because I can't afford alcohol. I could die right there, I didn't care, until; I arrived at a very improvised house, not very big, it seemed like it was built recently, maybe it made sense to me; because I went far enough away that there were no people and I saw them there. Two people with foreign features; extremely pale skin, light black hair, and blue eyes. It seemed like they had enough melanin to waste it. I went at the expense of them being hostile and left it at that.

WEEK 5:

I was fired from my job after so much time sacrificing my physical and mental integrity, it is what they pay me with, a dismissal. I don't know what I'll do now, I've looked for a job and no one has wanted to give me one. I'm desperate not to know what's going to happen tomorrow.
I kept going to the place from before to observe the two strange people I saw that day. I started discreetly. Afterwards I became curious; Since they acted like cavemen, the only thing missing was their typical clothing. They hunted and other things that I will leave to your imagination. I didn't really find that behavior strange; foreigners looking for alternative experiences. Although they always disappeared into the forest around 4 pm, it is something rare but routine for them, they still return happier than normal. I feel mediocre spying on people on the outskirts, but I have nothing else to do. My job is lost and one of these days they are going to kick me out of my house.

WEEK 6:

Finally they took me out of that musty smelling apartment; That teenager's dream of success was tainted by a cruel world; the lack of understanding of what that recent college graduate was facing, meritocracy is a lie.
Having nothing better to do, what started as a hobby is now turning into a full-time job. Only, this time, those foreigners discovered me. I thought the worst, but they turned out friendly. They greeted me with rather clumsy Spanish, as if they had barely learned the basics or had escaped. They introduced themselves and told me their names, they seemed like an ordinary couple and, they were. They told me that they came from the land without a name (my suspicions that they came because of spiritual experiences were increasing at that moment); I didn't care much. I told them my name, my previous experiences and other things; I managed to see a little pity on their faces and when I got to the part where they kicked me out of the apartment, they asked me if I had a place to stay, I answered no; His expression became even more noticeable. Then I saw them whispering to each other, as if they were about to make an important decision and I could only hear, “Okay,” from that conversation. I really didn't know what was going to happen until one of them asked me, would you like to stay with us? Someone in their right mind would have thought about what their intentions were, but I had already lost everything and anything other than sleeping on the streets is better; so I accepted.
At first I wanted to help with the cleaning and everything related to it but they told me that chaos is the natural order and I didn't have to change it. They mentioned that today they were going to eat meat and I offered to go get it from the store, but they told me that those filth were not pure meat; but animals with millions of preservatives and chemicals; On the other hand, the true meat is what one hunts because not only is food obtained, the animal is also freed from this disgusting place where the dominated live. I immediately asked what the dominated are and they proceeded to give me a very long explanation that I can summarize in this: At the beginning of time Adam was the great work of God, he tried to recreate the same formula but this time feminine, her name was Lilith; She wanted to be autonomous from Adam but the divine rules did not protect Lilith, she ended up expelled from Eden and later, God created what they call a “mediocre replacement.” Lilith, upon learning of her replacement, felt a mixture of emotions, although she knew that she was going to act submissive to Adam because she was created according to his rib. It was then that Lilith tried to open the eyes of that replacement, she allied herself with the “serpent” to make it eat the fruit of good and evil so that it would acquire its own criteria, although it ended fatally, although it ate and so it was, it obtained its own criteria and was taken out of Eden, however, that wretch chose to remain dominated by its material of due reaction and be subdued instead of seeking its own freedom and autonomy. Really their objective is to return to the natural order, to put aside the disgusting authority, in short, to live according to our will and not lower ourselves to a greater power. In short, the dominated are the offspring of Eve.
At this explanation I was astonished; It is the typical story that I was told as a child, but with a somewhat strange twist. I thought they were going to use me for strange things because everyone was Eva's offspring, according to what they say, but they told me that there is a way to cleanse the blood of the dominated but to do so you must attend several meetings with the brotherhood, brotherhood?; I asked, surprised, yes, they answered in a coordinated way that was terrifying. So after eating they told me that the signal had arrived and that they had to go with the brotherhood, they took me without asking me to a place even further away where I was, about 2 hours walking, until I reached a place that did not match, it was something terrifyingly perfect but neglected, they were like the old Catholic churches, or as if it had been taken by force I decided to enter as I was practically in nowhere. When I entered, I walked for a while in its extensive corridor that invited me to enter its maw, it seemed to have no end and, halfway through it I saw a door closing, but I managed to see a stranger pulling a man who seemed to be hugged by a snake by the leg and despite having seen him briefly, I still remember his features, and when the corridor finally ended I saw something incredible (in the bad sense), hundreds of people gathered in this space, it was something disgusting, since having the philosophy that chaos is the natural order they did not have their own cleanliness, much less of that enormous place, if upon entering I noticed a strange smell, this was horrible, it was a lack of control until someone arrived, an inhuman silence invaded the place and began to speak, I did not understand anything until after half an hour when he began to speak in Spanish fleetingly, the only thing I understood was ""because of the useless replacement, several live in the monotony of submission to the authorities,” the language suddenly changed and that was how the entire meeting remained. It was a strange experience because when I blinked I felt as if I had fallen asleep, chance and that explains the sting I felt when walking down that hallway. As soon as I woke up I felt a strange sensation in my leg, even so I continued standing because what occupied all my attention was the putrid smell of that place, in some way I felt relieved, without thinking about how I would be able to eat the next day, as if all my regret had gone, as if I had been touched by a divine presence, it was liberating! At the end we were made to say goodbye to each of the “brothers” who had attended and despite greeting them all, I never saw the man who was hugging the snake's leg and the most disturbing thing, out of hundreds of people I barely saw a hundred.

WEEK 7:

Since that meeting my days have gone great, I feel alive, I feel with a genuine purpose to live, something alternative to the typical born, grow, study, work, marry, reproduce, die. 
One day I wanted to take a bath and I asked where they bathed. I used to go to a nearby stream but it seemed very laborious to go from there to here, so I decided to ask and they answered that chaos is the natural order, so I decided to go to the usual stream. I was practically drugged by them, I don't know what to do but I remembered that I got out of there for a reason, I was practically chosen by them. In the other meetings I have not been able to understand anything, sometimes and I usually understand one thing or another, but every time I understand something I record it, in a total of 10 meetings I have managed to put together a sentence; “because of the useless replacement, many live in the monotony of submission to the authorities, we are here to liberate, we are here to return to the natural order, we will cleanse the world of the blood of the dominated, we will return to the place where our lady came from”; I find the message somewhat beautiful, I come from being subjected by that system, I have been able to be freed from my chains, in exchange for what? In exchange for nothing, I had never heard of a purpose as noble as that of living according to our will. My relationship with strangers has improved a lot, they are no longer strangers, and despite that they have not agreed to tell me their names, they say they do not have any, lately I have not known anything about what is happening in the world, although it must be the same, sensationalism, murders, wars and so on; As long as I am with the brothers I don't need anything else. They have told me what happens when the brotherhood is blasphemed, they say that some suffered punishments comparable to their sin, but to give you an idea the most common thing is murder, in what way? They did not tell me (but considering that they are the closest thing to cavemen I don't want to imagine), I would be terrified but knowing that I have no reason to blaspheme the name of the holy brotherhood it does not worry me.
 
WEEK 8: 
I have been engaging in conversations with the few brothers who can speak Spanish, rarely the others cannot speak the language and the majority of those who can do so in a very archaic way; It is as if they had had to emigrate, or rather, escape. From the conversations I had with them, most of them have one characteristic, being at their worst moment, poorly paid work, poor communication with loved ones, horrible homes, in short: being in a vulnerable moment and being welcomed by our wonderful brotherhood. 
I have spoken little with that mysterious person who appeared at the meeting and put order in the first meeting I attended, from what I have investigated I know that he calls himself the “older brother”; He is like the bridge between us brothers and our mother, Lilith, I have talked to him sometimes. I have managed to talk to him only once, I asked his name and he told me that he has no comment that once you join the brotherhood you stop having a name, you know? It doesn't really matter because I don't even remember my name anymore; He comments that they go from country to country in search of those subjugated who seek to be free, through the meetings they see the potential of a few to be cleansed, those who are not, are taken to a last act of faith to find the way.
The hundreds of people have dropped to barely a hundred and from there I have only been able to notice a few dozen; The older brother says that some went to look for brothers, others found the way and others couldn't do it, I really don't know what ""finding the way"" refers to. I have noticed that the treatment that I had before has changed, from being friendly I can now see more hostile behavior; From becoming valuable, now I am nothing to them, the rules are increasingly absurd but deep down I realize that they have a very clear argument, they were proclaimed by the older brother based on conversations with our mother; The deals don't matter now because I am sure that I am in the middle of a test, my loyalty is worthy of being tested by the eldest brother and when it is finally over, my blood can finally be cleansed. 

WEEK 9:

Several meetings have passed, all the same, except that I haven't understood a single word, I really kept trying to understand them but I didn't even know what language they spoke in the first place (not that I know many languages).
I don't even know what I'm getting myself into, they're giving me very absurd rules, like not bathing. Once I tried to escape under the excuse of going for a walk, I arrived at a place that I previously saw as moderately populated and now, there are no people, everyone was missing, on the light poles there were signs of missing people, but instead of saying ""lost"", the word ""liberated"" was superimposed on it, the walls were full of vandalism, among what scared me the most was an inscription that said ""once marked by it you cannot escape"", I immediately remembered that strange mark of two fangs on my leg, I didn't know what to do, I simply ran until I felt that my legs were tearing from my body, finally I fell to the ground from exhaustion from doing such a thing, but what for me was an incredibly long distance was actually barely one street. Finally I woke up in the foreigners' house, according to them I was only asleep but the unbearable pain in my legs and their change of attitude towards me revealed something more than just a dream, from their kind looks I can only notice hatred in their eyes, they did not speak more after telling me that, it was a silence that apart from being inexpressive revealed more than just a few simple words. Thinking about it this way, maybe I didn't pass the test imposed by the older brother. They did not take long to head towards the brotherhood, curiously it was not yet four o'clock, I know this because today that signal so characteristic of that hour was not present; Finally we arrived at that place, this time there was a very noticeable change, instead of smelling things like sweat or signs of poor hygiene, today there was a penetrating smell of decomposition, I would have vomited except that we had not been able to hunt anything for two days. When we reached the center of that place, the brothers' looks were the same and their silence worried me. Finally, the older brother arrived saying that I made a serious mistake, because once marked by it, you cannot escape. Fortunately he said it was part of the test because not being able to stand being subjected I tried to seek my freedom, something our mother would also do. I am worthy of being cleansed, my cleansing ceremony will take place before the leap of faith to find the way, it is incredible to be here writing this at the expense of what is going to happen. I'll tell you about it next week.

WEEK 10:

The child came running out of the woods directly in front of my jeep. I slammed on the brakes, and the vehicle screeched to a halt about three feet away from him, headlight beams reflecting in his eyes.

Beside me, Deputy Erikson almost dropped a cup of coffee in his lap. Meanwhile, I was frozen in place, my fingers clutching the steering wheel for dear life, knuckles bulging against the skin.

""Is that the kid?"" Erikson asked.

Exhaling the tension from my body, I said: ""That's a kid, alright, but not the one we're looking for.""

I unfastened my seat belt and climbed out of the car. Slowly, as if approaching a wild animal, I walked towards the child with my hands raised in plain sight.

We were scouring the area for a missing girl. About six years old, auburn red hair, freckled face. Alys was her name. She’d been taken from a parking lot after one of her treatments. No one knew how.

The child in front of us, though, was a little boy, maybe eight to ten years old. Short, bedraggled brown hair, tan, and skinny as a beanpole.

There were leaves and twigs sticking out of the nest of his hair. Mud stained his bare feet. Small pink scratches adorned his arms and legs. For late October, the weather was too cold and windy to be wearing khaki shorts and a T-shirt. But if I had to guess, the temperature was the least of his concerns.

""Calm down now, son,"" I told him, ""we're not gonna hurt you.""

I could see it in his eyes. The teetering scales that resided within every person. That intrinsic response to perceived danger. Fight or flight? Stay or go?

The boy looked primed to run, but we were out in the middle of nowhere, standing on an endless stretch of asphalt. Last farm was about seven miles back, the next farm was probably another good seven miles ahead.

""Can you tell me your name?"" I asked. ""I'm Deputy Solanis with Halleran County Sheriff's Department. You can call me Raymond if you'd like, or Ray if that's easier.""

The boy stared at me with wide eyes. His pupils were dilated, eclipsing the whites. He parted his cracked lips and whispered: ""Thomas.""

""Thomas, that's a nice name. Can you tell me what you're doing out here, Thomas?""

The boy trembled with fear, wildly thrashing his head from side-to-side. ""Please! Please! Please! Don't send me back...I can't go back...don't make me."" He fell to his knees and sobbed. ""Hollow...men...bad...animals...in the trees...""

His head snapped up in my direction. There was a sudden stillness to him that made my heart drop. Like a lull during a thunderstorm, when the entire world goes quiet.

""The Fisherman is real,"" Thomas cried. ""He's in the trees! He'll come for me. They all will!""

Then, without warning, the boy fell flat onto the tarmac, unconscious. I rushed over to him and placed my fingers on his neck. There was a faint pulse present. From what I could discern there were no apparent cuts or broken bones. No indication of internal or external bleeding other than the few small scratches from running through bushes and other foliage.

I picked the boy up and returned to the jeep, setting him in the backseat. Taking my place behind the wheel, I spun the car around and headed towards the nearest hospital. About a twenty or thirty minute drive. But that's the Midwest for you. An archipelago of small towns isolated by an ocean of farms and forests. Rolling fields with a few riverbeds and streams interspersed.

While I drove, my foot heavy on the accelerator, my partner radioed the station with an update. Then, he called the hospital, told them to have a room and staff on standby for our arrival.

He hung the receiver on its cradle and peered into the backseat, a look of anguish upon his face. He muttered a soft prayer and turned in his seat, facing the front again.

""Son of a bitch,"" he muttered, glancing at the clock on the dash. ""I'm 'sposed to go trick-or-treating with Dany in about an hour.""

I checked the time. He was right. It was nearing the end of our shift. Getting anyone to willingly work a Saturday was tough. Convincing them to stay late was almost impossible. Of course, if the sheriff demanded it, there wasn't much they could do. At the same time, the sheriff was away on vacation, leaving me in charge.

""Tell you what,"" I said. ""Help me drop the kid off, and I'll let you get going for the night.""

""Are you sure?"" he asked, but there wasn't much in the way of sincerity. ""I'd hate to leave you high and dry.""

""I'll be fine. Didn't have plans anyway.""

""Oh, right..."" Erikson averted his gaze from me, once more looking back at the boy. ""Think he's from Sanguis?""

""Sanguis?""

""Yeah, closest town I can think of other than Baywater. But Baywater's about an extra twenty minutes from where we found him.""

""How far is Sanguis?""

""About eight minutes if you'd kept on the highway. Small gravel road that'll take you there.""

I nodded, storing the information away at the back of my mind. ""Sanguis, why haven't I heard of it?""

""Doesn't surprise me. Not many people have. They're a tight-knit community. Population can't be more than two thousand, if that. Only reason I know them is for their sweet corn.""

""What about it?""

""Just that it's pretty damn good. All their produce is. Since they're so far out, they have to take it to other markets and whatnot. But a few years back, they ran out of sweetcorn before I could get any. So, I asked the lady selling it for directions and went straight to the source. I'm tellin’ ya, stuff is out of this world. Dany and Lin go crazy over it.""

For the last few years, most of my dinners were plastic-wrapped and bought from a gas station. Couldn't remember the last time I'd gone grocery shopping for anything other than a six-pack and TV dinners. Maybe a frozen pizza if I was really hungry. But those days, my appetite was practically nonexistent.

We arrived at the hospital and carried the kid inside. Despite the holiday weekend, we were met by a number of nurses with a stretcher ready. Before I knew it, the boy was wheeled away, down the hall and around the corner. A doctor approached to question us, but we didn't have as many answers as he would've preferred. To be fair, I wasn't pleased about it either. Should've tried harder to get a full name or something concrete.

""How long do you think he’ll be under?"" I asked the doctor.

""Can't say until I've had a chance to examine him,"" the doctor admitted. ""The collapse could've been a result of extreme fatigue, malnutrition, mental strain, induced narcotics...I should be able to provide a better answer soon.""

My heart was racing, and my patience was burning. I couldn't stand the idea of waiting around, twiddling my thumbs, hoping everything would just land on my lap. Especially since we still had flyers to pass out for the missing girl.

""How 'bout this,"" I said, grabbing a pen and piece of paper from the front desk, ""I'll leave my personal cell and my partner's number. Kid wakes up, you call us. Until then, I'm gonna have a look around, see if I can't find the parents first.""

The doctor took the sheet of paper and nodded. ""Be careful out there tonight, Deputy. Full moon is a bad sign.""

""Well, I'm not one for superstitions, doc.""

We went back to the jeep, and I drove my partner home. His wife and son greeted me with excitable waves. The boy was dressed up as a scarecrow, and the mom in a white and blue dress with a little wicker basket.

""There's our tin man,"" she said as Erikson exited the vehicle. Then, she looked through the open passenger window at me. ""Y'know, we could still use a cowardly lion to round out the pack. You’re more than welcome to join us, Ray.""

""Would love to, Lin. 'Fraid I've got other plans though.""

""Oh?"" She cocked an eyebrow. ""Got a special date or something?""

Erikson nudged her with his elbow. She frowned in response. I recognized the signs of martial nonverbal communication well. An interesting thing to develop with someone. A language that can only be achieved after years and years of familiarity. I had that once, I like to think. But I was better at speaking it than interpreting it.

""I should be on my way,"" I said. ""Dany, get enough candy for the both of us, yeah?""

""We're gonna hit every house in town,"" the boy replied eagerly.

After that, I was back on the highway heading towards Sanguis. Overhead, the sun descended, gradually vanishing against the horizon. Black clouds billowed across the sky, wispy trails of ink that dispersed against the moon's unnatural glow. It was that time of year, the Hunter's Moon. When its white, snowy surface took on a pale orange hue and appeared about twice its normal size.

Along either side of the highway were thick patches of trees. Some with empty tops, their branches twisted like gnarled fingers. Others still retaining a mixture of red and brown leaves that swayed against the breeze.

I slowed down by mile marker ninety-six, crawling along the highway at a deliberate pace until my headlights spotted the gravel road Erikson told me about. Then, I turned off from the asphalt and followed the lane for another few minutes. It wasn't a long drive, but I was being cautious about deer or other wildlife. Nothing could ruin your day like a wild animal.

Rounding a bend, Sanguis appeared as if out of thin air. One second I was surrounded by dark forests and cornfields. Next thing I knew, there were dim street lamps and old brick buildings with vines wrapped around them like spiderwebs. Cookie-cutter houses of this era, greatly contrasted by the outdated shops along main street. Each one built directly beside each other, shoulder-to-shoulder because back in the day, no one really knew just how big a town could become. Everything was grouped together for convenience.

I had to pull off from main street along a backroad due to a line of barricades. It seemed the town was holding a Halloween festival. And with the overcrowded sea of cars, it looked as if everyone and their moms were in attendance.

I found a parking spot on a muddy field in between a Ford Puma and a Lincoln. I got on the radio to let the dispatcher know of my whereabouts and to see if there were any updates about the boy. So far, they hadn't heard anything. Just to be sure, I checked my phone, but I was too far out in the boonies for cell reception.

""Go figure,"" I muttered, pocketing my phone and stepping out from the jeep. I locked the car and started my trek for the only part of town that had any discernible sign of life.

In all my years, I'd never seen such spirited enthusiasm for Halloween. I've encountered some interesting costumes, attended a few lively parties, but Sanguis was on a completely different level.

Almost everyone wore a costume, and no outfit was the same. There were a few modern pop culture references. Kids dressed up as their favourite cartoon characters and superheroes and whatever else was popular to them. Adults varied in that some donned scarier outfits and makeup to appear as ghosts and ghouls and zombies. Some, mainly the younger crowd, were dressed in a more attractive fashion. Then, of course, there were a handful of people that didn’t bother with more than their everyday clothes.

I shouldered my way through the crowd, trying to ask about the boy, but I was consistently ignored. I imagine many mistook my uniform for a costume, and considering my age, they wanted nothing to do with me. I was just a middle-aged man with a tired face and sad eyes. Unruly hair partnered with faint stubble that was in an awkward phase between beard and clean-shaven. My only advances had been blind dates organized by mutual friends. But I didn’t have many acquaintances outside of work.

However, after enough searching, I was able to speak with a few of the locals. With the provided information, some had possible answers, but Thomas was a common name. Not to mention, many of the locals willing to speak with me were already inebriated and struggled to comprehend what I was asking. The music blaring through overhead speakers scattered about main street wasn't making my job any easier either.

There was nothing I could do about the festival, as much as I wanted to. I couldn't just make demands to shut it down or halt its progress. Sanguis wasn't within my county, and therefore, I had little say. I should've called someone to aid me, someone working within their jurisdiction, but I was impatient. Eager for answers.

Eventually, someone dressed as a sad-faced clown pointed to a nearby diner and told me I should speak with the mayor. I thanked them and went on my way.

Inside, the diner was packed from wall-to-wall. Every booth was filled, every stool taken, every inch of counter space occupied by food and drinks. The distinct scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, intermingled with the smell of cooked bacon grease and oil from an air fryer.

""Sorry, hun."" A hostess in a black apron had snuck up on me, appearing from a small cluster of girls dressed as vampires. ""There aren't any tables right now. Wait time will be about ten to twenty minutes. Maybe longer.""

I leaned in and asked: ""Is the mayor here?""

The woman looked me up and down, studying my face. ""Oh, you're not from around here.""

""That obvious, huh?""

""I've got an ear for accents and a memory for faces. 'Specially one as handsome as yours.""

She was lying in hopes of getting a tip.

""You wouldn't happen to know of a little boy named Thomas, would you?” I asked. “Younger, between eight and ten. Brown hair. Blue eyes.""

""Might be Tommy Milner. His daddy has a farm up the road.""

""Sweet corn?""

Her lips twisted with amusement. ""Sheep and pigs mostly.""

""Right,"" I said. ""Now, about the mayor...""

She turned and pointed to a booth at the back of the restaurant. A man in a suit sat alone. Darker skin, curly black hair cut short, quiet but seemingly amicable as he politely nodded or waved at a few other patrons passing by on their way for the side exit.

""Thanks a bunch."" I left the hostess and maneuvered the crowd until I stood before the mayor's table. ""Got a moment?""

He looked up from his half-eaten meal. His eyebrows knitted together with consternation. ""Do we know each other, friend?""

I extended my hand. ""Raymond Solanis; deputy sheriff from Halleran County.""

A charming smile lifted the mayor's lips, revealing a set of pearly-white teeth. A politician's grin. Warm, attractive, but not so defined as to appear creepy or intense. Small lines around the corners of his mouth said he must've donned it often.

""Mayor Michael Briggs."" He grasped my hand firmly and shook it. ""Pleasure to make your acquaintance. Please, have a seat. Are you hungry? Best bacon this side of the river.""

Best bacon and sweet corn, I thought. What can't you people do?

""No,"" I said, ""but thank you.""

He nodded and lifted a cup of coffee to his mouth. ""I like your costume.""

""You do realize I'm actually a deputy sheriff, right?""

""And I'm dressed up as the very handsome mayor of Sanguis.""

""Doesn’t really seem like a costume to me.""

""Of course it is."" The mayor grinned. ""You and I are nothing more than men. This, the clothes we wear and the business we conduct, are roles in a play. The world is a stage, my friend, and we are simply trying to give our best performance before the curtain inevitably falls.""

I had to wonder if it wasn't just coffee in the mayor's cup.

""The reason I'm here,"" I explained, ""is about a boy my partner and I found on the highway. Might be a local from your town. Tommy Milner?""

""Ah, Tommy. Kind young man. Hard worker. You say you found him on the highway?""

I quickly recalled the day's earlier events. How the boy came running out of the woods barefoot and afraid. As if he were being chased.

""I see."" The mayor rubbed his hand along the length of his jaw. ""Is he okay?""

""He's being treated at a hospital about half an hour from here. I was hoping to get in contact with the parents, verify the boy’s identity.""

""You and your partner?""

""Just me."" I don't know why, but then I said: ""Partner's on standby at the hospital. Waiting for any updates.""

The mayor took another sip of his coffee as he considered this. There was a hint of distress in his eyes as if he were trying to solve a puzzle without all the pieces. Bemused by the news given to him.

""Well, Deputy, I can't say I've heard from the Milners. Then again, it has been a busy day with the festival. Why don't we take a ride up to the farm and check in on them?""

""I would appreciate that, Mayor.""

He collected his coat from the booth and rose to his feet. I followed closely behind him. As we neared the main entrance, he stopped and whistled.

Somehow, through the bustle of the diner, a woman at the far end of the counter perked up and met the mayor's gaze. She stood from her stool, threw down a twenty dollar bill on the counter, and joined us outside.

It was then I got a better look at the woman. Lithe frame and hard jaw. Steely eyes with an indifferent expression. She wore a black police button-up beneath a Kevlar vest.

""Deputy Solanis, meet Officer Katherine Barsad,"" the mayor introduced. “She’s our local law enforcement.”

""Kat,"" she said curtly.

I tried to shake her hand, but the mayor was already on the move, and she was quick to keep up with him.

We all piled into Officer Barsad's cruiser and drove deeper into town, past the buildings and streets onto a muddy road that led us to the countryside. The trees returned but swiftly gave way to endless fields of corn.

""You know, Deputy,"" said Mayor Briggs, ""it seems strange for you to be all the way out here.""

""Lucky that I was, otherwise young Tommy might still be walking the highway.""

The mayor glanced over at me in the passenger seat, still awaiting some sort of explanation.

""I was going around handing out flyers for a missing girl, Alys,” I said. “Trying to raise awareness; see if I couldn’t shake something loose.”

""Correct me if I'm wrong, but they have Amber Alerts and news channels for that, don't they?""

""Smaller communities aren't alway fully connected to the network. And I've got me something of a restless mind. Need to keep busy.""

""Workaholic or guilty conscience?""

Instinctually, I tensed at the question. In the backseat, Officer Barsad shifted her body to face me. It was then I realized just how cramped the car was, and how strange it'd been for the officer to relinquish the driver's seat to the mayor. Then again, he was technically her boss. But in my experience, whenever I was with the sheriff, he always rode shotgun.

""You know why they call this town Sanguis?"" the mayor asked. ""Back in the late 1800s, around the civil war, there was a battle here. You see for a time, Missouri was considered a border state. You know what a border state is?""

""When the state's loyalty was divided between the Confederacy and the Union. Neither fully one or the other.""

""Very good, Deputy."" He raised his eyes to look at Officer Barsad in the rearview mirror. ""We've got a learned man in our midst.""

We turned off the road and started up a long winding lane towards a plain farmhouse with a sloped roof. The yard light was off, and the inside of the house was dark.

""The battle was as bloody as they get,"" Mayor Briggs continued. ""Brothers against brothers, fathers against sons. In fact, there’d been so much bloodshed, it soaked into the dirt and turned the waterways red for a time. It almost caused the town to collapse completely, but where there's a will there's a way.""

""And that connects to Sanguis how?""

We came to a stop in the empty driveway. The mayor turned towards me, the leather of his seat squeaked with his movements. ""Sanguis is the Latin word for blood. Not our proudest moment but perhaps our most defining.""

Slowly, under the cover of the shadows, I slid my right hand across my body, resting it on my revolver. ""Is that so?""

There was a hint of disappointment in the mayor’s smile. ""Unfortunately."" Then, he unbuckled his seatbelt and exited the car. ""Are you coming?""

I opened my door and stepped out, Officer Barsad lingered a few paces behind us. A spectator in this investigation. Easy to forget if you weren’t careful.

We followed the cobblestone path to the porch and knocked on the front door. There was no response, so we knocked again. The mayor called out to the Milners, alerting them of his presence. Still, nothing.

""What do you think, Deputy?"" the mayor asked. ""Should we get a warrant? I imagine it might be difficult for you considering county lines.""

I looked back at Officer Barsad. ""Suppose I should let you take the lead.""

She remained still, her eyes going to Briggs for instruction. He nodded lightly, and she stepped forward, trying the handle. The door swung open to darkness and the smell of honey ham.

I removed a flashlight from my belt. Officer Barsad did the same. We entered the house, our beams of light crawling across the floorboards and walls. I kept my right arm rested on the grip of my revolver, ready to draw at a moment's notice.

In the hallway, I found a picture hanging on the wall. It was a family photo of the Milners. Mother, father, and son. The boy was the very same I'd encountered on the highway.

Suddenly, the overhead lights came on. Mayor Briggs stood with his finger still on the switch, grinning at me with a sense of pity.

""Keep your eyes on the sky,"" he said, ""and you'll trip over the roots beneath your feet.""

We turned off our flashlights and wandered the house, calling out to the Milners. There was no sign of life, no sign of a disturbance either. The house sat empty and still, untouched. Then, as I returned from the hallway, I stopped in the dining room. The dinner table was set with three plates, the food on each plate partially eaten. Something had interrupted their supper and forced them to abandon their home halfway through a meal. No time to clean up, no time to pack, no time to do anything but leave. Where had they gone?

1m3kqpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/northampton/comments/1m3kqpc/the_coffee_chat_whats_the_deal/,The Coffee Chat - What's the Deal?,"Apologies for reposting on this topic. I needed to change the title of my prior post, but reddit does not allow one to edit the title. For clarity, I’ve also edited the post and added a few additional details.

\*\*\*\*\*

The Coffee Chat recently opened on Pleasant Street. By all accounts, the establishment lacks any sense of ‘character’ or ‘soul’ that would ordinarily be necessary to succeed in a crowded coffee shop market such as Northampton. That got me interested in the backstory of the place. My research led me to the information below. Please feel free to contribute any additional information to provide for a better understanding of the situation.

The former Mimmo’s building was purchased by Si Ci Zhu, who recently pleaded guilty to a million-dollar-plus Medicare/Medicaid fraud, specifically ‘Conspiracy to Offer and Pay Health Care Kickbacks.’ (See Link 1 Below; Total Restitution ordered was $1.9M). She oversaw the building improvements on the property during the last 6-9 months, as evidenced by her communications with the building department (see the searchable Northampton Building Permits Database). She identifies herself as the owner of the property and listed the ’proposed use’ of the space as a ‘coffee shop’ (See Links 2 and 3 Below).  I believe she is even pictured in the ribbon cutting ceremony with the Mayor.

Her 26-year-old son, Justin Ching, is listed as the Registered Agent/Principal of The Coffee Chat business in its filings with the State but that does not necessarily mean he funded business or that he is the 100% beneficial owner of the business. He may be. He may own just a portion of the business. Or he may own nothing. The shareholder list/agreement is not a public document so there is no way of knowing one way or the other. He has a full-time job in New York City (per LinkedIn) and no easily identifiable connections to the local area. Any help here would be much appreciated.  He is unlikely to be independently wealthy given his age (but, I suppose, it is possible). Online records indicate his association with the same Staten Island address as Si Ci Zhu, and the criminal docket includes a character reference letter from a person identifying himself as Justin Ching, Si Ci’s son. He has been listed in recent years as the buyer and/or seller of several residential properties in the valley. But I could not find a record of him having a permanent residence in the area. Again, he has a full-time job in NYC. To be clear, I am in no way suggesting that he was involved in the criminal behavior to which his mother pleaded guilty or that should be held responsible for her ‘sins.’ I am simply curious as to the funding and beneficial ownership of the current operating business given his age and status as an absentee-owner with no obvious connections to the area or industry.

The Daily Gazette article profiling the business strangely made no mention of the owner(s) of the business, though it did include quotes from the Operations Manager.  From the article: “Coffee is a relatively new experience for \[Operations Manager\], who said he went most of his life without drinking it. Nevertheless, he said that opening Coffee Chat constituted a “passion project” for him….“I didn’t drink coffee until about three years ago,” \[Operations Manager\] said. “But then I finally discovered good coffee, and I want to share that experience with as many people as I can.”

People should draw their own conclusions and make decisions with which they are comfortable.  At a time when the social safety net is under attack in Washington, I am choosing to avoid a business until I can be 100% certain that no funds will be pocketed by someone who sought to defraud these very programs for her own personal gain. Luckily, there are plenty of other options in Northampton.

""I'm fine.""

It's the most common lie we tell, multiple times a day, without even thinking about it. But for those of us living with mental illness, that automatic ""fine"" carries the weight of a thousand unsaid truths.

I said ""I'm fine"" the day I had to pull over on my way to work because a panic attack made me forget how to breathe. I said it when my depression was so heavy I couldn't remember the last time I felt genuinely happy. I said it when my anxiety convinced me that everyone around me was just pretending to like me.

We've gotten really good at being ""fine.""

# The Invisible Injury

If I walked into work on crutches, people would ask what happened. They'd offer to carry things, hold doors, maybe bring me coffee. There would be visible evidence of my struggle, and the response would be immediate compassion.

But when I walk in after three hours of sleep because my mind spent all night spiraling through worst-case scenarios? When I'm fighting to concentrate through a fog of medication side effects? When I'm using every ounce of energy just to appear normal while my brain tells me I'm worthless?

I look fine. So I must be fine.

Mental illness is the ultimate invisible injury. There's no cast to sign, no obvious limp to accommodate, no clear timeline for healing. Just the exhausting daily performance of appearing okay when everything inside feels broken.

# The Language of Shame

Pay attention to how we talk about mental health, even with the best intentions. We ""struggle with"" mental illness, as if it's a character flaw we can't quite overcome. We ""suffer from"" depression, like it's punishment for something we've done wrong.

When someone dies by suicide, we say they ""lost their battle"" with mental illness – as if they weren't fighting hard enough, as if they simply gave up. But we don't say cancer patients ""lost their battle"" when they die from organ failure. We understand that sometimes, despite the fight, the illness wins.

The language matters because it shapes how we see ourselves and how others see us. It determines whether we feel like warriors fighting a disease or weak people who can't handle life.

Lisa, a friend who lives with bipolar disorder, puts it perfectly: ""I don't struggle with bipolar disorder any more than someone struggles with diabetes. I manage it. Some days are harder than others, but it's not a moral failing – it's a medical condition.""

# The Performance of Normal

We've become masters of code-switching between our internal reality and external performance. We learn the right answers to deflect concern:

""You seem tired today."" ""Yeah, just didn't sleep well."" (Translation: I've been awake for 72 hours straight because my anxiety won't let me rest.)

""You've been quiet lately."" ""Just been busy."" (Translation: My depression has stolen my voice and I'm terrified that if I open my mouth, only sadness will come out.)

""Want to grab dinner?"" ""Can't tonight, maybe next time."" (Translation: Leaving my apartment feels impossible right now, and I'm afraid I'll ruin everyone's good time with my presence.)

We perform normal so well that sometimes we forget we're performing. The mask becomes so familiar it feels like skin.

# The Cost of Silence

This silence comes at a price we rarely talk about. When we hide our struggles, we rob others of the chance to help. More importantly, we rob them of the chance to share their own.

David, a colleague I've known for three years, mentioned offhandedly during a particularly stressful project that he takes medication for anxiety. Something in his casual tone gave me permission to share that I do too. Within minutes, we discovered we had both been suffering in parallel, each thinking we were the only one struggling.

""I thought I was the only person here dealing with this stuff,"" he said. ""I've been so careful to hide it that I didn't realize other people might be hiding it too.""

That conversation changed everything. Not just for us, but for our entire team dynamic. When we stopped pretending to be invincible, we gave everyone else permission to be human.

# The Myths We Live By

The stigma around mental health is fed by myths that we unconsciously perpetuate:

**The Strength Myth**: That acknowledging mental health struggles means you're weak. In reality, it takes tremendous strength to admit you need help and then actually seek it.

**The Fix Myth**: That mental illness is something you can just ""get over"" with enough willpower or positive thinking. You wouldn't tell someone with diabetes to just ""think positive"" about their insulin production.

**The Danger Myth**: That people with mental illness are unpredictable or dangerous. The truth is, we're far more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators, and most of us are just trying to navigate daily life like everyone else.

**The Rare Myth**: That mental illness only affects a small portion of the population. One in four people will experience a mental health condition in their lifetime. Look around your office, your family, your friend group – we're already there.

# The Ripple Effect of Honesty

When someone finally breaks the silence, it creates ripples. Maria started a mental health support group at her company after her own burnout led to a hospitalization for severe anxiety. What began as a small lunch gathering became a formal employee resource group with over 200 members.

""I was terrified to be the first person to say out loud that work was literally making me sick,"" she reflects. ""But once I did, it was like opening floodgates. People started sharing stories I never would have imagined – executives talking about panic attacks before board meetings, new parents struggling with postpartum depression, employees who'd been hiding their therapy appointments for years.""

The group didn't just provide support; it led to concrete policy changes. Flexible scheduling for therapy appointments. Mental health days that didn't require fake sick excuses. Training for managers on recognizing signs of burnout and stress.

# Starting Small, Changing Everything

You don't have to become a mental health activist overnight. Change starts with small acts of courage:

Replace ""I'm fine"" with ""I'm having a tough day"" when you're not fine.

When someone shares a struggle, resist the urge to immediately offer solutions. Sometimes ""That sounds really hard"" is more helpful than ""Have you tried yoga?""

Pay attention to your language. Instead of ""She's crazy"" try ""She's struggling."" Instead of ""I'm so bipolar today"" when you're just moody, recognize that trivializing real conditions makes it harder for people who actually live with them.

Share your story, even in small ways. You don't have to post your diagnosis on social media, but you can mention to a friend that you're seeing a therapist the same way you'd mention seeing a dentist.

# The Permission to Not Be Okay

Here's what I wish someone had told me years ago: You have permission to not be okay. You have permission to take medication if it helps. You have permission to go to therapy. You have permission to set boundaries. You have permission to have bad days without apologizing for them.

You also have permission to be more than your mental illness. To have dreams and goals and bad jokes and strong opinions about pizza toppings. Mental illness is part of your story, but it's not the whole book.

The next time someone asks ""How are you?"" you don't have to say ""fine."" You could try ""I'm working on it"" or ""Some days are better than others"" or even just ""Thanks for asking.""

Because here's the truth we don't say enough: We're all just figuring it out. Every single one of us is carrying something invisible, fighting battles no one else can see, performing strength we don't always feel.

Maybe it's time we stopped performing and started being real with each other. Maybe it's time we made ""How are you?"" a real question again, with space for real answers.

Maybe it's time we admitted that none of us are really ""fine"" – and that's perfectly human.",1,1752891344.0,u_CompScienceNerd423,0,1.0,False

A line cook squirts espresso into a shot glass. A server pours white wine into a flute. A guest asks for oat milk in an Americano. Behind the scenes, the myths pile up. They lurk in the POS, in menu notes, in staff chatter. They kill profit, confuse guests, and erode trust. Time to burn them down.

**Myth One:** Diet soda helps guests lose weight. It does not. A Harvard study found that diet soda drinkers gained nine percent more weight than those who skipped artificial sweeteners¹. They feel virtuous, yet the scale punishes them. Your menu sells illusion. Your books feel the blow.

**Myth Two:** Fresh-squeezed juice is always healthy. An eight-ounce glass of orange juice has 21 grams of sugar². That equals a cola. You charge a premium. You pour empty calories. Your profit climbs, but your guest pays later, in health, not cash.

**Myth Three:** Coffee cures all. Coffee can cut Parkinson’s risk and lower some cancer odds³. Too much gives acid reflux and sleepless nights. The World Health Organization says 400 milligrams of caffeine a day is safe⁴. That is four cups of drip. Teach your barista to count shots like cash.

**Myth Four:** Craft beer margins hit 300%. The average tap markup sits near 200%⁵. Some brewers push higher. Some bars lose volume. You need balance. Sierra Nevada at your tap moves, but jack the price, and it stalls. Watch your keg data.

**Myth Five:** Red wine adds prestige and profit. Wine-by-the-glass sales fell five percent last year at table-service spots⁶. Guests chase cocktails. They skip your by-the-glass pours. Turn wine into a star feature. Host flights. Curate one rare bottle each month. Make wine matter.

**Myth Six:** Mocktails are sodas with a twist. Demand for zero-proof mixology jumped 20% in 2023⁷. Guests want layers. They seek bitters, shrubs, and house syrups. Death & Co. in New York sells a nonalcoholic Negroni that feels heavy on flavor. Train your staff. Charge for craft.

**Myth Seven:** Bottled water is a loss leader. Bottled water yields up to an 80% margin⁸. It costs pennies and brings dollars. Place brands where guests see them first. Watch per-cover checks rise. (It might be considered a loss leader because the managers and staff drink so much of it, instead of letting it be sold to their guests).

**Myth Eight:** Every guest craves a strong cocktail. 42% of diners skip high-ABV drinks to dodge next-day fog⁹. Offer a 4% ABV spritz that tastes like eight. Your sales grow. Your bar team smiles at low-cleanup calls.

**Myth Nine:** Sparkling water steals still-water sales. On-premise sparkling water grew 8.7 percent in 2023¹⁰. It is now the fastest-rising bar pour. Stock Pellegrino, La Croix, or better yet, a local brand. Guests will pay.

**Myth Ten:** Seasonal menus kill consistency. Seasonal pours lifted beverage checks by 12 percent last year⁶. A summer-berry spritz. A winter-spice toddy. They drive buzz. They push check averages. They tell your brand’s story.

**Call to Action**

The bar is blood and math. Every pour is profit or loss. You cannot run on hope or hearsay. You need facts. You need data. You need a plan.

Audit your menu. Break every myth. Train your staff. Price with care. Test new recipes. Track every ounce. Measure every dollar.

Be ruthless. Toss the fluff. Serve truth. Engineer your drink menu like your cellar line depends on it. It does.

The child came running out of the woods directly in front of my jeep. I slammed on the brakes, and the vehicle screeched to a halt about three feet away from him, headlight beams reflecting in his eyes.

Beside me, Deputy Erikson almost dropped a cup of coffee in his lap. Meanwhile, I was frozen in place, my fingers clutching the steering wheel for dear life, knuckles bulging against the skin.

""Is that the kid?"" Erikson asked.

Exhaling the tension from my body, I said: ""That's a kid, alright, but not the one we're looking for.""

I unfastened my seat belt and climbed out of the car. Slowly, as if approaching a wild animal, I walked towards the child with my hands raised in plain sight.

We were scouring the area for a missing girl. About six years old, auburn red hair, freckled face. Alys was her name. She’d been taken from a parking lot after one of her treatments. No one knew how.

The child in front of us, though, was a little boy, maybe eight to ten years old. Short, bedraggled brown hair, tan, and skinny as a beanpole.

There were leaves and twigs sticking out of the nest of his hair. Mud stained his bare feet. Small pink scratches adorned his arms and legs. For late October, the weather was too cold and windy to be wearing khaki shorts and a T-shirt. But if I had to guess, the temperature was the least of his concerns.

""Calm down now, son,"" I told him, ""we're not gonna hurt you.""

I could see it in his eyes. The teetering scales that resided within every person. That intrinsic response to perceived danger. Fight or flight? Stay or go?

The boy looked primed to run, but we were out in the middle of nowhere, standing on an endless stretch of asphalt. Last farm was about seven miles back, the next farm was probably another good seven miles ahead.

""Can you tell me your name?"" I asked. ""I'm Deputy Solanis with Halleran County Sheriff's Department. You can call me Raymond if you'd like, or Ray if that's easier.""

The boy stared at me with wide eyes. His pupils were dilated, eclipsing the whites. He parted his cracked lips and whispered: ""Thomas.""

""Thomas, that's a nice name. Can you tell me what you're doing out here, Thomas?""

The boy trembled with fear, wildly thrashing his head from side-to-side. ""Please! Please! Please! Don't send me back...I can't go back...don't make me."" He fell to his knees and sobbed. ""Hollow...men...bad...animals...in the trees...""

His head snapped up in my direction. There was a sudden stillness to him that made my heart drop. Like a lull during a thunderstorm, when the entire world goes quiet.

""The Fisherman is real,"" Thomas cried. ""He's in the trees! He'll come for me. They all will!""

Then, without warning, the boy fell flat onto the tarmac, unconscious. I rushed over to him and placed my fingers on his neck. There was a faint pulse present. From what I could discern there were no apparent cuts or broken bones. No indication of internal or external bleeding other than the few small scratches from running through bushes and other foliage.

I picked the boy up and returned to the jeep, setting him in the backseat. Taking my place behind the wheel, I spun the car around and headed towards the nearest hospital. About a twenty or thirty minute drive. But that's the Midwest for you. An archipelago of small towns isolated by an ocean of farms and forests. Rolling fields with a few riverbeds and streams interspersed.

While I drove, my foot heavy on the accelerator, my partner radioed the station with an update. Then, he called the hospital, told them to have a room and staff on standby for our arrival.

He hung the receiver on its cradle and peered into the backseat, a look of anguish upon his face. He muttered a soft prayer and turned in his seat, facing the front again.

""Son of a bitch,"" he muttered, glancing at the clock on the dash. ""I'm 'sposed to go trick-or-treating with Dany in about an hour.""

I checked the time. He was right. It was nearing the end of our shift. Getting anyone to willingly work a Saturday was tough. Convincing them to stay late was almost impossible. Of course, if the sheriff demanded it, there wasn't much they could do. At the same time, the sheriff was away on vacation, leaving me in charge.

""Tell you what,"" I said. ""Help me drop the kid off, and I'll let you get going for the night.""

""Are you sure?"" he asked, but there wasn't much in the way of sincerity. ""I'd hate to leave you high and dry.""

""I'll be fine. Didn't have plans anyway.""

""Oh, right..."" Erikson averted his gaze from me, once more looking back at the boy. ""Think he's from Sanguis?""

""Sanguis?""

""Yeah, closest town I can think of other than Baywater. But Baywater's about an extra twenty minutes from where we found him.""

""How far is Sanguis?""

""About eight minutes if you'd kept on the highway. Small gravel road that'll take you there.""

I nodded, storing the information away at the back of my mind. ""Sanguis, why haven't I heard of it?""

""Doesn't surprise me. Not many people have. They're a tight-knit community. Population can't be more than two thousand, if that. Only reason I know them is for their sweet corn.""

""What about it?""

""Just that it's pretty damn good. All their produce is. Since they're so far out, they have to take it to other markets and whatnot. But a few years back, they ran out of sweetcorn before I could get any. So, I asked the lady selling it for directions and went straight to the source. I'm tellin’ ya, stuff is out of this world. Dany and Lin go crazy over it.""

For the last few years, most of my dinners were plastic-wrapped and bought from a gas station. Couldn't remember the last time I'd gone grocery shopping for anything other than a six-pack and TV dinners. Maybe a frozen pizza if I was really hungry. But those days, my appetite was practically nonexistent.

We arrived at the hospital and carried the kid inside. Despite the holiday weekend, we were met by a number of nurses with a stretcher ready. Before I knew it, the boy was wheeled away, down the hall and around the corner. A doctor approached to question us, but we didn't have as many answers as he would've preferred. To be fair, I wasn't pleased about it either. Should've tried harder to get a full name or something concrete.

""How long do you think he’ll be under?"" I asked the doctor.

""Can't say until I've had a chance to examine him,"" the doctor admitted. ""The collapse could've been a result of extreme fatigue, malnutrition, mental strain, induced narcotics...I should be able to provide a better answer soon.""

My heart was racing, and my patience was burning. I couldn't stand the idea of waiting around, twiddling my thumbs, hoping everything would just land on my lap. Especially since we still had flyers to pass out for the missing girl.

""How 'bout this,"" I said, grabbing a pen and piece of paper from the front desk, ""I'll leave my personal cell and my partner's number. Kid wakes up, you call us. Until then, I'm gonna have a look around, see if I can't find the parents first.""

The doctor took the sheet of paper and nodded. ""Be careful out there tonight, Deputy. Full moon is a bad sign.""

""Well, I'm not one for superstitions, doc.""

We went back to the jeep, and I drove my partner home. His wife and son greeted me with excitable waves. The boy was dressed up as a scarecrow, and the mom in a white and blue dress with a little wicker basket.

""There's our tin man,"" she said as Erikson exited the vehicle. Then, she looked through the open passenger window at me. ""Y'know, we could still use a cowardly lion to round out the pack. You’re more than welcome to join us, Ray.""

""Would love to, Lin. 'Fraid I've got other plans though.""

""Oh?"" She cocked an eyebrow. ""Got a special date or something?""

Erikson nudged her with his elbow. She frowned in response. I recognized the signs of martial nonverbal communication well. An interesting thing to develop with someone. A language that can only be achieved after years and years of familiarity. I had that once, I like to think. But I was better at speaking it than interpreting it.

""I should be on my way,"" I said. ""Dany, get enough candy for the both of us, yeah?""

""We're gonna hit every house in town,"" the boy replied eagerly.

After that, I was back on the highway heading towards Sanguis. Overhead, the sun descended, gradually vanishing against the horizon. Black clouds billowed across the sky, wispy trails of ink that dispersed against the moon's unnatural glow. It was that time of year, the Hunter's Moon. When its white, snowy surface took on a pale orange hue and appeared about twice its normal size.

Along either side of the highway were thick patches of trees. Some with empty tops, their branches twisted like gnarled fingers. Others still retaining a mixture of red and brown leaves that swayed against the breeze.

I slowed down by mile marker ninety-six, crawling along the highway at a deliberate pace until my headlights spotted the gravel road Erikson told me about. Then, I turned off from the asphalt and followed the lane for another few minutes. It wasn't a long drive, but I was being cautious about deer or other wildlife. Nothing could ruin your day like a wild animal.

Rounding a bend, Sanguis appeared as if out of thin air. One second I was surrounded by dark forests and cornfields. Next thing I knew, there were dim street lamps and old brick buildings with vines wrapped around them like spiderwebs. Cookie-cutter houses of this era, greatly contrasted by the outdated shops along main street. Each one built directly beside each other, shoulder-to-shoulder because back in the day, no one really knew just how big a town could become. Everything was grouped together for convenience.

I had to pull off from main street along a backroad due to a line of barricades. It seemed the town was holding a Halloween festival. And with the overcrowded sea of cars, it looked as if everyone and their moms were in attendance.

I found a parking spot on a muddy field in between a Ford Puma and a Lincoln. I got on the radio to let the dispatcher know of my whereabouts and to see if there were any updates about the boy. So far, they hadn't heard anything. Just to be sure, I checked my phone, but I was too far out in the boonies for cell reception.

""Go figure,"" I muttered, pocketing my phone and stepping out from the jeep. I locked the car and started my trek for the only part of town that had any discernible sign of life.

In all my years, I'd never seen such spirited enthusiasm for Halloween. I've encountered some interesting costumes, attended a few lively parties, but Sanguis was on a completely different level.

Almost everyone wore a costume, and no outfit was the same. There were a few modern pop culture references. Kids dressed up as their favourite cartoon characters and superheroes and whatever else was popular to them. Adults varied in that some donned scarier outfits and makeup to appear as ghosts and ghouls and zombies. Some, mainly the younger crowd, were dressed in a more attractive fashion. Then, of course, there were a handful of people that didn’t bother with more than their everyday clothes.

I shouldered my way through the crowd, trying to ask about the boy, but I was consistently ignored. I imagine many mistook my uniform for a costume, and considering my age, they wanted nothing to do with me. I was just a middle-aged man with a tired face and sad eyes. Unruly hair partnered with faint stubble that was in an awkward phase between beard and clean-shaven. My only advances had been blind dates organized by mutual friends. But I didn’t have many acquaintances outside of work.

However, after enough searching, I was able to speak with a few of the locals. With the provided information, some had possible answers, but Thomas was a common name. Not to mention, many of the locals willing to speak with me were already inebriated and struggled to comprehend what I was asking. The music blaring through overhead speakers scattered about main street wasn't making my job any easier either.

There was nothing I could do about the festival, as much as I wanted to. I couldn't just make demands to shut it down or halt its progress. Sanguis wasn't within my county, and therefore, I had little say. I should've called someone to aid me, someone working within their jurisdiction, but I was impatient. Eager for answers.

Eventually, someone dressed as a sad-faced clown pointed to a nearby diner and told me I should speak with the mayor. I thanked them and went on my way.

Inside, the diner was packed from wall-to-wall. Every booth was filled, every stool taken, every inch of counter space occupied by food and drinks. The distinct scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, intermingled with the smell of cooked bacon grease and oil from an air fryer.

""Sorry, hun."" A hostess in a black apron had snuck up on me, appearing from a small cluster of girls dressed as vampires. ""There aren't any tables right now. Wait time will be about ten to twenty minutes. Maybe longer.""

I leaned in and asked: ""Is the mayor here?""

The woman looked me up and down, studying my face. ""Oh, you're not from around here.""

""That obvious, huh?""

""I've got an ear for accents and a memory for faces. 'Specially one as handsome as yours.""

She was lying in hopes of getting a tip.

""You wouldn't happen to know of a little boy named Thomas, would you?” I asked. “Younger, between eight and ten. Brown hair. Blue eyes.""

""Might be Tommy Milner. His daddy has a farm up the road.""

""Sweet corn?""

Her lips twisted with amusement. ""Sheep and pigs mostly.""

""Right,"" I said. ""Now, about the mayor...""

She turned and pointed to a booth at the back of the restaurant. A man in a suit sat alone. Darker skin, curly black hair cut short, quiet but seemingly amicable as he politely nodded or waved at a few other patrons passing by on their way for the side exit.

""Thanks a bunch."" I left the hostess and maneuvered the crowd until I stood before the mayor's table. ""Got a moment?""

He looked up from his half-eaten meal. His eyebrows knitted together with consternation. ""Do we know each other, friend?""

I extended my hand. ""Raymond Solanis; deputy sheriff from Halleran County.""

A charming smile lifted the mayor's lips, revealing a set of pearly-white teeth. A politician's grin. Warm, attractive, but not so defined as to appear creepy or intense. Small lines around the corners of his mouth said he must've donned it often.

""Mayor Michael Briggs."" He grasped my hand firmly and shook it. ""Pleasure to make your acquaintance. Please, have a seat. Are you hungry? Best bacon this side of the river.""

Best bacon and sweet corn, I thought. What can't you people do?

""No,"" I said, ""but thank you.""

He nodded and lifted a cup of coffee to his mouth. ""I like your costume.""

""You do realize I'm actually a deputy sheriff, right?""

""And I'm dressed up as the very handsome mayor of Sanguis.""

""Doesn’t really seem like a costume to me.""

""Of course it is."" The mayor grinned. ""You and I are nothing more than men. This, the clothes we wear and the business we conduct, are roles in a play. The world is a stage, my friend, and we are simply trying to give our best performance before the curtain inevitably falls.""

I had to wonder if it wasn't just coffee in the mayor's cup.

""The reason I'm here,"" I explained, ""is about a boy my partner and I found on the highway. Might be a local from your town. Tommy Milner?""

""Ah, Tommy. Kind young man. Hard worker. You say you found him on the highway?""

I quickly recalled the day's earlier events. How the boy came running out of the woods barefoot and afraid. As if he were being chased.

""I see."" The mayor rubbed his hand along the length of his jaw. ""Is he okay?""

""He's being treated at a hospital about half an hour from here. I was hoping to get in contact with the parents, verify the boy’s identity.""

""You and your partner?""

""Just me."" I don't know why, but then I said: ""Partner's on standby at the hospital. Waiting for any updates.""

The mayor took another sip of his coffee as he considered this. There was a hint of distress in his eyes as if he were trying to solve a puzzle without all the pieces. Bemused by the news given to him.

""Well, Deputy, I can't say I've heard from the Milners. Then again, it has been a busy day with the festival. Why don't we take a ride up to the farm and check in on them?""

""I would appreciate that, Mayor.""

He collected his coat from the booth and rose to his feet. I followed closely behind him. As we neared the main entrance, he stopped and whistled.

Somehow, through the bustle of the diner, a woman at the far end of the counter perked up and met the mayor's gaze. She stood from her stool, threw down a twenty dollar bill on the counter, and joined us outside.

It was then I got a better look at the woman. Lithe frame and hard jaw. Steely eyes with an indifferent expression. She wore a black police button-up beneath a Kevlar vest.

""Deputy Solanis, meet Officer Katherine Barsad,"" the mayor introduced. “She’s our local law enforcement.”

""Kat,"" she said curtly.

I tried to shake her hand, but the mayor was already on the move, and she was quick to keep up with him.

We all piled into Officer Barsad's cruiser and drove deeper into town, past the buildings and streets onto a muddy road that led us to the countryside. The trees returned but swiftly gave way to endless fields of corn.

""You know, Deputy,"" said Mayor Briggs, ""it seems strange for you to be all the way out here.""

""Lucky that I was, otherwise young Tommy might still be walking the highway.""

The mayor glanced over at me in the passenger seat, still awaiting some sort of explanation.

""I was going around handing out flyers for a missing girl, Alys,” I said. “Trying to raise awareness; see if I couldn’t shake something loose.”

""Correct me if I'm wrong, but they have Amber Alerts and news channels for that, don't they?""

""Smaller communities aren't alway fully connected to the network. And I've got me something of a restless mind. Need to keep busy.""

""Workaholic or guilty conscience?""

Instinctually, I tensed at the question. In the backseat, Officer Barsad shifted her body to face me. It was then I realized just how cramped the car was, and how strange it'd been for the officer to relinquish the driver's seat to the mayor. Then again, he was technically her boss. But in my experience, whenever I was with the sheriff, he always rode shotgun.

""You know why they call this town Sanguis?"" the mayor asked. ""Back in the late 1800s, around the civil war, there was a battle here. You see for a time, Missouri was considered a border state. You know what a border state is?""

""When the state's loyalty was divided between the Confederacy and the Union. Neither fully one or the other.""

""Very good, Deputy."" He raised his eyes to look at Officer Barsad in the rearview mirror. ""We've got a learned man in our midst.""

We turned off the road and started up a long winding lane towards a plain farmhouse with a sloped roof. The yard light was off, and the inside of the house was dark.

""The battle was as bloody as they get,"" Mayor Briggs continued. ""Brothers against brothers, fathers against sons. In fact, there’d been so much bloodshed, it soaked into the dirt and turned the waterways red for a time. It almost caused the town to collapse completely, but where there's a will there's a way.""

""And that connects to Sanguis how?""

We came to a stop in the empty driveway. The mayor turned towards me, the leather of his seat squeaked with his movements. ""Sanguis is the Latin word for blood. Not our proudest moment but perhaps our most defining.""

Slowly, under the cover of the shadows, I slid my right hand across my body, resting it on my revolver. ""Is that so?""

There was a hint of disappointment in the mayor’s smile. ""Unfortunately."" Then, he unbuckled his seatbelt and exited the car. ""Are you coming?""

I opened my door and stepped out, Officer Barsad lingered a few paces behind us. A spectator in this investigation. Easy to forget if you weren’t careful.

We followed the cobblestone path to the porch and knocked on the front door. There was no response, so we knocked again. The mayor called out to the Milners, alerting them of his presence. Still, nothing.

""What do you think, Deputy?"" the mayor asked. ""Should we get a warrant? I imagine it might be difficult for you considering county lines.""

I looked back at Officer Barsad. ""Suppose I should let you take the lead.""

She remained still, her eyes going to Briggs for instruction. He nodded lightly, and she stepped forward, trying the handle. The door swung open to darkness and the smell of honey ham.

I removed a flashlight from my belt. Officer Barsad did the same. We entered the house, our beams of light crawling across the floorboards and walls. I kept my right arm rested on the grip of my revolver, ready to draw at a moment's notice.

In the hallway, I found a picture hanging on the wall. It was a family photo of the Milners. Mother, father, and son. The boy was the very same I'd encountered on the highway.

Suddenly, the overhead lights came on. Mayor Briggs stood with his finger still on the switch, grinning at me with a sense of pity.

""Keep your eyes on the sky,"" he said, ""and you'll trip over the roots beneath your feet.""

We turned off our flashlights and wandered the house, calling out to the Milners. There was no sign of life, no sign of a disturbance either. The house sat empty and still, untouched. Then, as I returned from the hallway, I stopped in the dining room. The dinner table was set with three plates, the food on each plate partially eaten. Something had interrupted their supper and forced them to abandon their home halfway through a meal. No time to clean up, no time to pack, no time to do anything but leave. Where had they gone? What made them leave so suddenly?",1,1752890975.0,u_Impossible_Bit995,0,1.0,False

We’re officially witnessing the end of an era: Proctortrack is out. Meazure Learning is in.

Let’s take a quick joyride through this wild proctored past and look ahead at what’s changing.

# Proctortrack Real Estate Exams (2020–2025): A Cautionary Tale in Real Time

* Launched during the COVID pivot like a toddler learning to walk... on a treadmill... during an earthquake.
* *Legendary* for:
   * [Security breach in 2020](https://proctortrack.com/blog/press-release/faqs-security-incident-on-13-october-2020) 
   * [Exam redirects to rickroll users](https://westerngazette.ca/news/proctortrack-suspends-services-after-security-breach/article_2938dc92-0f06-11eb-a6bd-c726f2f92d21.html) (**Rick Astley's** [Never Gonna Give You Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)). 
   * Forcing people to write exams in **the bathroom** because no other room passed the check (check Facebook for this, there are literally photos)
   * Random disconnections, disappearing proctors, exams rescheduled for technical difficulties, etc. If  you haven't seen the reviews, check out [ProctorTrack on the Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/proctortrack/id1463615798) or  [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.verificient.proctortrack&hl=en_CA) — pretty awful 

You weren't paranoid — the system **was** broken.

# But Before That…

Let’s not forget: pre-COVID, many **OREA exams were in-person only**, often on **Scantron cards** (*yes, in the 2010s*)

* A few central exam hubs across the province
* Real estate brokerages scouting students outside the test center on Saturday mornings
* iPads if you were lucky. Pencil + bubble sheet if not.

# Now Enter: Meazure Learning + ProctorU (2025–)

RECO has had **enough**. After:

* 34 learners lost their license in 2021 for [Humber exam cheating](https://www.reco.on.ca/news/learner-misconduct-in-humber-real-estate-education-program#:~:text=Humber%20College%20has%20notified%20us,Read%20Humber's%20statement)
* 90 more being investigated for suspected 2020-2021 [OREA College cheating](https://www.reco.on.ca/news/reco-sector-advisory)
* An [Auditor General report roasting RECO in 2022](https://www.auditor.on.ca/en/content/annualreports/arreports/en22/AR_RECO_en22.pdf)...

They’re locking things **all the way** down.

# What’s Different Now:

* **Exams will no longer run by course providers** → Whether you're with Algonquin, Fleming, Career College Group, or Humber (as October 2025), **Meazure Learning** handles your exams
   * In person = exam centers, ID checks, *no nonsense* and *limited hassle*
   * Online = webcam + phone + Meazure’s **Guardian browser**
      * No virtual machines
      * No screen recording
      * No funny business
      * Lots of extra requirements

# Exam Room Reality Check

In any exam environment:

* No phones, watches, cameras, hats, headphones, purses, calculators or earbuds (this list goes on). A calculator and note space is built into the exam interface. Accommodations (in advance) are possible to address items that may contravene exam requirements. [Read the full exam conduct requirements here](https://reco.on.ca/getmedia/fa54c52a-faea-44ac-a428-8bab01991667/RECO-Learner-Exam-Handbook.pdf).
* No writing from your bed, couch, car, bathroom or favourite coffee shop.
* You *will* need:
   * A valid photo ID that matches your learner account
   * A clutter-free desk
   * No funny business (no second screen, no virtual machines, nobody in the room, etc.)

**TL;DR:** If you’re not smuggling tech or writing in a cave, **you’re probably fine.**

# Pro Tips:

* **Read the** [**RECO Exam Handbook**](https://reco.on.ca/getmedia/fa54c52a-faea-44ac-a428-8bab01991667/RECO-Learner-Exam-Handbook.pdf). It’s long. It’s strict. But it answers *everything*.
* If you’re writing online, be prepared to use **your phone as a second camera**.
* Don’t wait until exam day to test your setup. Pay attention to all exam-related emails. You’ll stress less. Your proctor will thank you.

I just came across the teachers episode from last year and it made me think back to one of my teachers. TW: depression, suicide, assault(?)

So I grew up in one of the US territories, and went to a parochial school up until high school. Many of the teachers were there for years and I guess you can say we kinda grew up with them. One teacher, Mr. P., was one of our favorites; he taught science and was just a cool dude. He'd walk in smelling of smoke with his coffee mug everyday, and always put an interesting spin on stuff we learned and would sign papers ""Joe Mama"". Imagine an older dude influenced by the movie Grease back in the day, living on an island that was predominantly black. We didn't know a whole lot about him or where he was from as he kept his personal life to himself, but we loved him. 

One summer I was with some friends from school in a summer program when someone told us the news about Mr. P. Apparently he had gotten arrested and nobody knew why, we thought he was just some cool cat being pressed by the law, no big deal. Until it made it into the newspaper and everybody was surprised. Mr. P. was actually from Georgia, and his name wasn't Mr. P. at all. In fact, Mr. P. was dead. Our teacher actually assumed a dead man's name all these years and fled to our island after an incident in the states made him a sex offender. The story goes, one day he was drunk taking a piss out in public and some little girl saw; she told her parents and he ended up getting in trouble. When he had the chance, he stole a dead man's identity and fled to the islands. 

He was recognized one day at the store apparently and was extradited back to Georgia for the charges. Crazy thing is, they ultimately dropped the charges I guess and a few years later he moved back to our island. How did we find out? He ended up in the newspaper again for trying to kill himself by jumping from a condo, but surviving. A lot of us felt bad, imagine going from this teacher everyone loved to now everyone thinking you were a predator. He eventually attempted again successfully, and I still have mixed feelings about it til today. On one hand he was a fugitive, but on the other (if the story was true) he was a dude caught up in a bad situation. He was a dope teacher though and most of my interest in science was because of him. 

As crazy as this sounds, it's unfortunately a true story. I just looked up the articles again to make sure I got things right. Because our territory is small I don't want to put out names, but it was just on my mind after rewatching that episode so hopefully you found it interesting. ",1,1752890844.0,redditonwiki,1,1.0,False

1m3kkcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfuckYourHabitat/comments/1m3kkcg/unfucking_vs_maintaining_timelines/,Unfucking vs. Maintaining Timelines,"I spent last weekend doing a major unfucking and timing how long each task took.  Then this week timed how long it took to do maintenance.  I'm looking to get myself to a point where I only need to do deep cleans every three to six months.  (I tend to have the mental block that if it can't be done perfectly then it isn't worth doing, which eventually lands me in a giant mess.)

This list now lives on my refrigerator as a reminder, and it is actually really motivating.

We all have our particular pain points, but here are mine:

Dishes:

Unfucking a weeks worth of build up took me two hours.

Unloading the dishwasher in the morning takes as much time as it does for my coffee to brew.

Bonus, dishes throughout the day are rinsed and immediately put in.  So an extra five seconds over throwing into the sink.

End of day wiping down counters and doing the dishes that need to be hand washed is ten minutes.  

Mail:

Unfucking took me an hour to sort and prioritize.

Maintaining is under five minutes.  Sort the previous days mail while enjoying the first few gulps of coffee.  

Bulk mail and previous days recycling exits the house with me since the recycling bin is right next to my car.

Bathroom:

I don't even want to talk about how long and disgusting the original unfucking took.

I typically avoid single-use plastic / paper products but am allowing myself this indulgence.  I'll step up my composting efforts.

After brushing my teeth while swishing my mouthwash, I use a glass wipe cleaner to do mirror, countertop, and toilet seat / rim.

For the shower I do a quick spritz with a homemade no rinse shower spray.

Once a week I use a purple shampoo that needs to sit for five minutes.  Shout-out to whomever suggested on this subreddit to keep a dish wand filled with dish liquid in the shower!  Walls while taking the brass out of my silvers.  Tub sides and floor while deep conditioning because that shit is harsh.

Laundry:

Full disclosure, I live alone.  I have no idea how those of you with other people in the house keep up with this dreaded task.

I also grew up in a household that was super precious about sorting.  I am not.  My Aunt does not believe me that washing my jeans along with my undies hasn't caused the collapse of the western world.

Unfucking was a trip to the laundromat to do a much needed reset.

Other decisions were made.  I threw out all of my socks and bought packs of identical sets.  Life is too short to be pairing these fucks.

Also, my lounge / sleepy clothes do not need to be folded.  I now have a 'clean' hamper in my closet.

Tonight I washed my manageable load right after work and will put in dryer before bed.

Tomorrow, because I believe in myself, I will haul from basement to my bedroom before I go live my life.  (This a really dumb pain points, but my wardrobe lives in dryer and makes the morning stressful.)

The plan for Sunday is to immediately strip the bed and put in washer before a breakfast out.  Then put into dryer when I come home.  Sort and put away the clothes while indulging in some brain rot television.  Continue indulging brain rot while they dry.  Make the bed and then go live my life with the knowledge that it's going to be clean sheet night.

For those unfuckers out there who have managed to maintain your habitat, please tell me your strategies!

This week has felt amazing.  Knowing that I'm not going to be stressed and feeling like a failure makes the mornings so much easier.",9,1752890816.0,UnfuckYourHabitat,1,1.0,False
1m3kk3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1m3kk3l/relapsed/,Relapsed 😭,"I’m so mad at myself. I was 40 some days vape/nicotine free, I went cold turkey. I used Allen Carr’s book and it worked for me but this group was also extremely helpful and motivating. The first 3 days were the worst mentally for me, and mornings with coffee. I’d say for about 2 weeks, I was EXTREMELY exhausted and almost felt depressed. I work from home and was taking small naps throughout the day, going to bed at 730 and sleeping until the morning. But, I kept going. I even made it through having drinks with friends a few times, which I thought would be the biggest trigger. I had a VERY stressful day last week and one thing sent me over the edge and I caved on Friday. This entire week has been even more stressful, so I just kept doing it. I don’t know why I gave in. I’m planning on trying again on Monday. I hope I can do it again. I feel like a failure.

I will say for anyone in the start of their journey, since starting again, I notice I’m having trouble falling asleep at night. I didn’t notice a difference when I quit, but now that I’m vaping again I can firmly say there is a major difference in my sleep and I think I just didn’t realize how well I was sleeping. I also didn’t miss that panic feeling of “where is my vape?” Or “am I going to run out? I need to get another before I can go on with my day”.

I want to give you an update on the San Diego Squirrels Club - a social and support group for adults with ADHD in this region.   We met monthly all last year-  mostly in cafes and taverns, with occasional online meetings for topic discussions.   Some things came up in my personal life, so I had to put that on hold, because organizing events on a scheduled basis like that takes quite a bit of time and energy.   To my pleasant surprise, however, a few members stepped up to the plate and began organizing events without my involvement (except as a participant).    
  
So far this year, they've met up for dinner at a Korean barbecue restaurant,  arranged to play board games at a local coffee shop, and this coming Monday, they will be having a ""Meet and Munch"" at a restaurant that serves Greek and Mediterranean food.   Because of a price increase we've left Meetup and now announce these gatherings on EventBrite.   All are welcome to join us- here is the event description page where you can RSVP.

I'll try to do better, but since I've been something of a flake in attending to this Reddit group, I want to mention that most of the organizing for these gatherings has been in a WhatsApp group we started last year.  It's a small group, smaller than this Reddit group that has grown to over 50 members but its nice to see people planning and communicating there. If you would like to join this WhatsApp group, just send me a private message with your phone number, and I'll send you the invitation link.    


Our goal is the same: to develop an ""interconnected community of adults with ADHD in the San Diego region"" so we can learn, grow, and have fun.  If you would like to help out or get involved let me know.

I’ve never wanted to hurt her relationship, and have never tried to sabotage it because she (or so I thought) really loves him. She knows I’m bi and have liked her because I told her a few months after I realized.

1m3kh2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1m3kh2u/where_to_go_with_a_narcissistic_husband/,Where to go with a narcissistic husband?,"I'm so sorry this is a very long, in-depth post, but there are so many details I needed to give to get the full picture of what's going on. I met my now-husband in January 2021. He had a 9-year-old daughter from a previous marriage, and I was very accepting of her and tried to build a relationship with her throughout our relationship, but it was always apparent that she didn't want that. We got married in January 2023. Since getting married, his daughter has made life hell for me. My husband and his family have allowed her to be manipulative and not only destroy my marriage, but also ruin my mental health. 

  
In December 2023, after a few inpatient stays due to rapidly declining mental health, my husband blindsided me one morning with his wanting to divorce because his daughter is unhappy and threatened him that she wouldn't continue visitation anymore unless I wasn't around. Instead of taking the loss, I didn't want my marriage to fail and begged to find another way. So in February of 2024, I packed up my entire life in California and moved to Kansas with him so that he could be around his family and his daughter would have them and their support. I agreed to the move knowing I would have no one, except my husband. In our agreement, we would live together, but when his daughter came for visitation, he would go to live at his parents' house with his daughter and would visit me for an overnight stay at least 1-2 days a week. Her visitation is not a short period either. She flies from California to Kansas and is here to stay for at least 3-4 straight months at a time, and this is doable for her because she was pulled out of public school and has been homeschooled since sometime after June 2023.

  
It is now apparent that she absolutely doesn't want me in her or her dad's (my husband's) life because after giving an additional year and a half of this arrangement and time for her to adjust with absolutely no interaction or contact with this child, my husband, his daughter and I finally attended a family therapy session together this past Tuesday. At the beginning of the session, she said she felt like I never made an effort or wanted her around. I told the therapist that I was the one who planned our family nights and our family outings, and even footed the entire bill. I offered to go out to places with her, like to get coffee or boba, because I knew she liked it. I gave her a good portion of my expensive makeup collection and taught her how to use it because she was interested in learning. I was the one who, most of the time, made sure we had groceries in our home, and she had things she could eat when with us. I even sat with her in the ER when she had her own mental health struggle and talked to her to try and distract her and ease her nerves, while her mother just sat there on her phone the entire time. The therapist turned to her and asked if her knowing all of this made a difference in what she thought and how she saw things now, and his daughter said, ""No, not really."" And then she goes on to say that her dad seems happy with the current situation and that she doesn't want me in it because she only has 4 more years of her childhood until she graduates, and she doesn't want it to be unhappy and ruined.



Throughout the course of our relationship since moving to Kansas for him and his daughter in the hopes of saving our marriage and our family, my husband has shown that I'm not an important and cherished individual in his life. He cancels his scheduled time to stay with me during the week if his daughter is upset about it. He has let her dictate how he lives his life, even when not physically here with him, which has greatly affected me as a byproduct. There have also been times when I have had medical emergencies (I'm an insulin-dependent diabetic), such as my blood sugar going dangerously low at work when I can't leave and don't have access to things that would bring it up. I've reached out to him to ask if he could bring me a candy bar or a soda, and he's told me he can't because he is with his daughter. I, my feelings, and my well-being were never prioritized or important to him. So during our family session before his daughter was brought in, I told him that unless he starts putting forth effort that I feel is appropriate, the end result is going to be divorce. That if he can't treat me like his wife 100% of the time, I'm not going to act like it when it's a convenience to him or if his daughter isn't around.

  
My husband is definitely a narcissist, and he has allowed his daughter to be manipulative of him, his family, and our relationship. He was supposed to stay with me tonight and return to his family on Sunday morning, but instead has sent me the text in the provided image. His message is narcissistic in a way that he is clearly using my words and emotions against me. I've always struggled with mental health and would always say ""I'm tired"" when I knew I had gotten to a point of almost no return and was seriously considering sui\*ide, and he knows that because it was a huge conversation after he asked me what I truly meant when I would say that. It seems like he feels he is losing control over me and trying to guilt me back in with this message. I'm not dismissing that his feelings could be valid and he is struggling, but he has never came to me in our almost 5 year relationship to discuss his emotions or tell me that he is struggling. 

  
I have given almost 5 good years of my life to this man. I have agreed to move away from everything and everyone I know to a place where I have no one.

I have sacrificed my life goal of having a loving family and having a biological child of my own. Everything in my apartment (that we share when his daughter is here, but I live in full-time) has been purchased and supplied by me. I want out. I'm tired of continuously giving and have never, and will never, get anything in return. I want a divorce, but I also don't have a means out. I'm living paycheck to paycheck, basically with no savings. My family is emotionally supportive, but doesn't have the financial means to help me at all. I'm honestly willing to leave every single possession behind to just get myself somewhere safe and out of a clearly emotionally abusive relationship. But I just don't know how to proceed or where to even begin.

  
I'm sorry this is so long, but thank you to those who have made it through the entire thing. And I just want to say up front, thank you for even bothering to read it in the first place. I need support and guidance, but I don't know where to look for it right now.

Tl;dr, my husband and I haven't lived together full-time in almost 2 years since moving away from everything/everyone I know to try and save our relationship due to his daughter from a previous marriage being allowed to manipulate him and our relationship.

1m3kcpq,https://i.redd.it/qe7kywt5mqdf1.jpeg,Where to go with a narcissistic husband?,"I'm so sorry this is a very long, in-depth post, but there are so many details I needed to give to get the full picture of what's going on. I met my now-husband in January 2021. He had a 9-year-old daughter from a previous marriage, and I was very accepting of her and tried to build a relationship with her throughout our relationship, but it was always apparent that she didn't want that. We got married in January 2023. Since getting married, his daughter has made life hell for me. My husband and his family have allowed her to be manipulative and not only destroy my marriage, but also ruin my mental health. 

  
In December 2023, after a few inpatient stays due to rapidly declining mental health, my husband blindsided me one morning with his wanting to divorce because his daughter is unhappy and threatened him that she wouldn't continue visitation anymore unless I wasn't around. Instead of taking the loss, I didn't want my marriage to fail and begged to find another way. So in February of 2024, I packed up my entire life in California and moved to Kansas with him so that he could be around his family and his daughter would have them and their support. I agreed to the move knowing I would have no one, except my husband. In our agreement, we would live together, but when his daughter came for visitation, he would go to live at his parents' house with his daughter and would visit me for an overnight stay at least 1-2 days a week. Her visitation is not a short period either. She flies from California to Kansas and is here to stay for at least 3-4 straight months at a time, and this is doable for her because she was pulled out of public school and has been homeschooled since sometime after June 2023.

  
It is now apparent that she absolutely doesn't want me in her or her dad's (my husband's) life because after giving an additional year and a half of this arrangement and time for her to adjust with absolutely no interaction or contact with this child, my husband, his daughter and I finally attended a family therapy session together this past Tuesday. At the beginning of the session, she said she felt like I never made an effort or wanted her around. I told the therapist that I was the one who planned our family nights and our family outings, and even footed the entire bill. I offered to go out to places with her, like to get coffee or boba, because I knew she liked it. I gave her a good portion of my expensive makeup collection and taught her how to use it because she was interested in learning. I was the one who, most of the time, made sure we had groceries in our home, and she had things she could eat when with us. I even sat with her in the ER when she had her own mental health struggle and talked to her to try and distract her and ease her nerves, while her mother just sat there on her phone the entire time. The therapist turned to her and asked if her knowing all of this made a difference in what she thought and how she saw things now, and his daughter said, ""No, not really."" And then she goes on to say that her dad seems happy with the current situation and that she doesn't want me in it because she only has 4 more years of her childhood until she graduates, and she doesn't want it to be unhappy and ruined.



Throughout the course of our relationship since moving to Kansas for him and his daughter in the hopes of saving our marriage and our family, my husband has shown that I'm not an important and cherished individual in his life. He cancels his scheduled time to stay with me during the week if his daughter is upset about it. He has let her dictate how he lives his life, even when not physically here with him, which has greatly affected me as a byproduct. There have also been times when I have had medical emergencies (I'm an insulin-dependent diabetic), such as my blood sugar going dangerously low at work when I can't leave and don't have access to things that would bring it up. I've reached out to him to ask if he could bring me a candy bar or a soda, and he's told me he can't because he is with his daughter. I, my feelings, and my well-being were never prioritized or important to him. So, during our family session before his daughter was brought in, I told him that unless he starts putting forth effort that I feel is appropriate, the end result is going to be divorce. That if he can't treat me like his wife 100% of the time, I'm not going to act like it when it's a convenience to him or if his daughter isn't around.

  
My husband is definitely a narcissist, and he has allowed his daughter to be manipulative of him, his family, and our relationship. He was supposed to stay with me tonight and return to his family on Sunday morning, but instead has sent me the text in the provided image. His message is narcissistic in a way that he is clearly using my words and emotions against me. I've always struggled with mental health and would always say ""I'm tired"" when I knew I had gotten to a point of almost no return and was seriously considering sui\*ide, and he knows that because it was a huge conversation after he asked me what I truly meant when I would say that.

I just launched the **Dystopian Future Collection** today, and it’s probably the most ambitious thing I’ve ever done slime-wise. Every slime in the set is tied to its own original **short dystopian story**, and each one comes with a small story-related bonus packaged with the slime. I really wanted this collection to feel immersive, moody, and a little unsettling in the best way.

Here’s a breakdown of each slime in the **Dystopian Future Collection**:

* **Regulation Blanket 451** – A thick, fluffy light blue slime made with clay, foam, and instant snow powder for a soft, airy texture. It smells like Fresh Linen, Pine, and Milk & Honey.  It's clean and comforting to the point of suspicion. Comes with a story about a quiet rebellion hidden under government-issued warmth.
* **I Was The Missing Piece… Obviously** – An orange-coated clear slime loaded with red, black, and gold glitter in chaotic harmony. Scented like orange and chocolate chip cookies. Comes with a story about Jewelia, who is absolutely convinced she’s the chosen one... whether she is or not.
* **The Last Weird European Candy** – A shimmering pink bingsu slime with orange bingsu beads, lemon fimos, citrus slices, and a plastic lollipop. It smells like Lemon, Blood Orange, Blow Pops, and Hibiscus. The story follows a contestant competing for the last piece of candy in a sugar-banned dystopia.
* **Man With Rock vs. Supercomputer** – A dual-layer slime with a gray block bead base and a clear blue silica topper. Scented with Strawberry + Sugar & Spice and Blueberry Jam + Basil. The story follows a man who drives on a whim to confront a rogue AI, armed only with his Saab and a souvenir rock.
* **Orwell’s Last Stand** – A yellow wood glue slay slime with sugar beads, plastic eyeballs, and pencil fimos on top. It smells like Scotch Whiskey and Cake Batter; it's sweet, boozy, and slightly chaotic. The story is about a man trying to beat censorship by hiding rebel intel in lifestyle blogs.
* **Surviving Off-The-Grid** – A forest green sandy slime with fake moss, lava rock, and pumice stones. Scented with Dirt, Smoked Oud, and Driftwood Island for something earthy, grounded, and intense. The story follows a family that escaped into the woods years ago, and what Dean Jr. finds when he strays too far.

I’m also including a Mystery Slime with the first few orders of the weekend—this time it’s called **Brain Static**. It’s a black craft glue hybrid with sand and floam beads, using the same base slime and texture as *Niki FM* from my Valentine’s Day Playlist drop. It’s scented with Vanilla Caramel, Lavender, and Woodland Snow for a scent that's cozy, clean, and just a little suspicious, like something wants you to forget what you were doing. It has its own short story, too, but for now the only way to access that one is to place an order.

Writing all these stories was exhausting but honestly so much fun. I’ve never tied a collection together like this before, and I loved getting to build out these weird little dystopias.  Some of them are serious, some silly, and all are deeply dramatic. I can’t wait to share them with you.

On Monday, I also released my new, permanent collection, **Immortal Spell**, and the response has already been phenomenal:

* **Necromancy** – A thin, light gray-brown thin white glue slime, scented like Lilac and Petrichor. If you remember *Dead Slime* or *Slime Skulls*, this is the same texture and base, but with a richer hue and a deeper, moodier scent.
* **Poison Apple** – A thick, light green slime scented with Apple, Clove, and Raspberry Jam. It shares the same recipe as *Galactic Citizen Cereal* and *Rage For Our Gay Ancestors*, but with no mix-ins.  It's just smooth, rich texture in its purest form.
* **Grimoire** – A shimmering purple coated clear slime, It smells like Library, Cardamom, and Night Violet to make something dark, elegant, and just a little arcane.

These may be simple, but they’re magical. No add-ins, just a permanent, affordable way to try out a few of my core textures and let the scent do the heavy lifting.

\+++

I also:

* **Updated all product pages** with a standardized attributes table and embedded Instagram links, so you can get a clearer look at textures, scents, and vibes before you commit to the squish.
* **Launched the Slime Archive** – It’s a full gallery of past slimes—photos, descriptions, and ghosts of restocks gone by. It’s a work in progress but already packed with retro slime goodness. Each archived slime also includes suggestions for similar slimes that are currently available in the shop, so if there was one you loved, you might just find a new favorite.
* **Launched the official Emo Slimes newsletter**, which you can sign up for right on the site.
* **I have updated the Emo Slimes wristbands**, because obviously.  They are already being sent out with orders.
* **Started testing slime-proof labels** that hold up better during use—early testing is promising, and I’m excited to switch over soon.
* **Will be offering jars in the shop soon**! Lots of people have asked, and I’ll be starting with the 6oz, 2oz, and 1oz in both singles and packs.

If you’ve ordered recently—thank you. If you’re just following along—thank you too. This community continues to be such a huge part of why I love doing this.  
Let me know if you have any questions, ideas, or if you just want to scream about slime. I’ll be here, packing boxes and trying not to get glitter in my coffee.

He put in all those hours, with the energy and determination of a mad-man WITHOUT caffeine. 

Prosecutors over there with coffee, Judge with her tea, security with his mug that I can only assume was filled with Mtn Dew. But Brooks was on water only. 

He did all that without a smoke break (I’m not a smoker and I know he was weed, don’t know about cigarettes or other) but this guy was sober. 

There was one late night, I think it was the Reddit night that they ended super late and started at 8:30, and he got there with a stack of case law to argue. I don’t know how much sleep he can run on but man, I would need a nap. 

Finally, bro did it alone. That was so satisfying for me, because I couldn’t imagine how difficult it would be to have all that frustration and no one to discuss it with. He was in a secure unit and had limited inmate communications, he was all alone.

So yeah, I think it’s “admirable” how he can spout nonsense with such confidence and ask questions that make NO SENSE with this delusional state of mind. But to do all that without some sort of stimulant to keep him going. I’d have tapped out pretty quick.

Honestly the moment he showed up in the intro scene I was already sold but it only got better from there. The first time I saw his apartment it was like seeing my own living room in a game. Same style in general, but I literally own his couch and coffee tables and even have a very similar looking rug. That's not THAT weird yet of course, I'm sure there are plenty of us out here giggling because their main has the same taste in furniture  but it gets weirder.

I honestly could've written an entire essay on similarities, but for the convenience of anyone reading my rant I decided to stick to bullet points:

- His theme colours are my favourite colours (perfect to be honest, all of his merch matches with my stuff)
- My accessories are mostly stars and planets, especially stars are 'my thing'
- My best friend's family owns a flower business, she's currently in charge of their store
- His wakeup schedule coincidentally matches mine somehow
- Speaking of sleeping, the amount of pictures my friends have of me sleeping in class, sleeping on the floor, park benches, train, bus, and pretty much anywhere that's not a bed or a couch is insane. They literally gave me a picture album with just pictures of me sleeping at school during our graduation😭 I am KNOWN for sleeping my day away
- Shared love for vintage cameras and scary stories
- Same personality type (INFP)

But know what surprised me the most?
The birds.
I have two budgies, have had them for multiple years. One is literally called Puffball, the other one has had the nickname 'alarm clock' ever since I got her. I honestly could've made an entire post about the birds alone but like... the entire list is just???

Clara wants to protect everyone too (heh), Robin wants to fix what her brother did and make Penacony a better place, Natasha is obvious, Sushang i honestly believe that her will to pick up the sword despite her frail physique is more than enough to be called willpower.

Here are some career progression tips that might help you make a similar journey.","I've posted this in the past, but I'm updating with more information, better sorting, and headers for readability so I can continue to use it to provide career advice without having to write an essay each time. Advice provided comes from what I've learned myself, and what I was taught by a couple of early career mentors that were incredibly impactful in helping me reframe how I needed to approach my career.

**About Me**

I grew up poor to a mechanic dad and a trucker mom, so I never had a ton of exposure to white collar work or what job opportunities there were. Rather than taking on debt, picking something blind, and risking it not panning out, I decided to get work experience and maybe go back to school once I had a plan of what I wanted to do. Now that I've gotten this far, it's become an ego thing to keep going without one just to see when I'll finally hit a wall where my lack of degree truly stops me. When I'm between jobs, I've never been out of work longer than 3 months at a time. 

My career path was customer support > advanced support > writing the guides support uses > managing the content projects for a line of business > managing the team that writes the content > managing the software that manages content for a sales team > implementing new software that manages content for a sales team and defining the full content strategy.



**How to be a good employee - in a way that benefits you**

Corporate work is a team sport in most cases, not an individual one. It doesn't matter if you're the smartest person in the room if nobody wants to work with you because you're a pain in the ass. Learn to say your piece, build your argument, and move on - the work you're doing reflects more on the owning manager than yourself, so don't bog yourself down taking everything personally or trying to be the star. It's more important the work gets done on time and in budget than it is to deliver something perfect. 

Rarely give an opinion without asking why things are the way they are today. I used to be super guilty of this when I felt like there was an obvious solution, but I wasn't thinking big picture. Sometimes a dumb process exists because someone dumb made it, yes, but most of the time, the issue is that fixing the issue is going to cause new problems for other teams, or there are data limitations in what can be shared with a third party software, or there's some sort of legacy problem that popped up that resulted in the current outcome. Always ask before deciding you know everything and can fix everything.

When you're making business proposals for stuff you want to do, have the big picture in mind. Most teams go through planning processes towards the beginning of the year where they determine this years goals - know them, and when you make business proposals for improvement, connect what you want to do to those key goals. You'll have an easier time getting those accepted. 

If I'm going to complain about something, it's coming with a short-term, bandaid fix, and a medium-term good enough solution, and a long-term perfect world solution, unless it's completely out of my wheelhouse to solve. If you're regularly making more work for your manager or complaining without solving anything, you're going to struggle to get ahead. Not to mention, you're losing valuable opportunities to demonstrate skills you otherwise don't have the opportunity to get experience on.

Your social skills only become more important the higher up you go, unless you're in an IC role. You need to be able to convince people to do things for you to progress your projects, you need to learn how to get people on your side to argue against dumbass decisions, and you need people to listen when you have something you need to say. I've gotten promotions in some cases over people who were more technically sound than I was, solely because I had already demonstrated my ability to work with and convince the stakeholders who work with our team to do what we need them to do. 



**Appearance**

It matters, but not in the way you think. How you present yourself creates assumptions around your professionalism, capabilities, and attention to detail. That doesn't mean you need to run out and buy a suit or wear designer clothes, but having frizz-free hair done in a style that suits you, taking notes on the formality level of what people at the level you're trying to go to wear, and making sure your clothes fit and are unwrinkled, does a lot for your first impression. 

For dudes, don't go to the discount barber to get your first styled haircut, go to one that cares about your end product and making sure you look your best. Have seen those [barber transformation videos?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3lOnwsjcwF8) A lot of folks are walking around with the number 2, leave it long on the top not realizing what they could actually look like with a little more thought. 

Unless you're lucky with a chronically honest manager like I was, people aren't going to tell you that you look disheveled because that's rude, they're just going to let you get passed up on. I wasn't raised to care about appearances, it was your heart and capabilities that count, so this was a huge wakeup call for me after my first promotion passover (I wore jeans, tshirts, and dirty sneakers like everyone else at my level at my job), but I got the next thanks to those small changes. 



**Upskilling**

I'm constantly upskilling as soon as I'm comfortable in my job - I look up at the positions I want and use coffee chats with folks about what makes them successful in those roles and posted job descriptions as a task list of skills I need to work on and demonstrate so I'm prepared for the time when the position is open. 

If I can't receive an opportunity to utilize a skill in my normal work, I make them for myself by building business cases around stuff I want to do that will materially help our team and present it to my managers. Not every suggestion will be taken, but with practice and refining your skills, eventually an opportunity will pop up where the time or money savings are too good to pass up.

I also say yes to out-of-scope work for the same reason, and regularly ask what I can deprioritize on my normal tasks so I maintain my work-life balance to take it on. They're going to hire someone with those skills regardless, you're only shooting yourself in the foot experience-wise at this job and your next if you don't grab those opportunities yourself.

I self-advocate. My managers either know exactly where I want to go or if they're touchy about keeping people on their team, what skills I want more work on so that I can build my resume experience. 

I also track all of my big successes and achievements across my career in a google doc and in my 1:1 before promotion time, because human memories are short and prone to recency bias, I remind my manager about all the great work I've done for that time period. I learned to keep my mouth shut as well - if you say you don't want to do more than what you currently do/you don't want to manage people, folks will automatically take you out of the running when opportunities come up.

Dear god, take feedback, there's a lesson to be learned in everything you receive whether it's valid or someone's a sensitive little bitch. If you work with a difficult person, look at what the folks they successfully work with do to connect with them or how they get them to do things. If someone's telling you you're longwinded, take that as a note to be more direct in your approach when you message that person. Don't be egotistical and insist it's your way or the highway, sometimes you have to adapt to the situation to get through it. Even the most toxic places I've ever worked have had lessons I took away and still use to this day, like following up verbally received instruction with written confirmation of assigned tasks.

Ask questions to other teams you work with, and pick up some of their skills through youtube and other courses, it gives you a common language to better phrase and reframe your asks of them. Even though managing content systems is largely project management/process related, knowing basics around UX helps me communicate with our visual designers, having basic SQL and excel skills means I can analyze my own data and brainstorm with our tech team on how to deliver something I want to build, etc. Don't feel like you're limited in scope just to your job, knowing how other teams impact you and being able to speak to it makes everything easier. 



**Networking**

Traditional cold networking events only work for rich people and small industries, for the rest of us, it's way more important that you have a good working relationship with your coworkers. Your old coworkers who know you're a hard worker, are easy to work with, and don't cause problems are going to be your best advocates and resource for referrals over Joe you met twice at a networking event. 

Developing coworker relationships is easy - I shout out members of my team who helped me on projects, which leads to an environment when they shout me out for helping them, increasing my advocates come promotion time. I teach people how to do things, I build or share resources that help them, etc - I don't view my coworkers as my competition, they're my network, and when they talk me up to their managers, their managers don't argue with my manager when I'm up for promotion. 



**Applying to jobs**

Applying to jobs is basically a sales pitch for 'why you' - you need to paint the story of what it'll be like working with you through your resume and interview answers. If you're not getting interviews, your resume is the problem, if you're not making it past the interview stage, you're either overshooting or undershooting on roles that you're interested in, or your interview skills are week. 

ALSO learn your transferrable skills, don't limit yourself just to whatever your degree or past career has been. I work with folks with archaeology, history, comms, and communications degrees. If you wanted a degree to do my job, you'd get a master's in information architecture, yet I've met exactly one person who specialized in school. The rest of us just learned on the job. Teachers, as another example, are always surprised to find out they're highly prized in learning and development, project management, and supportive sales roles like customer success.  

*Resumes*

Yes, having keywords is important, but don't pack your resume with keywords to the point that you lose the sauce about matching your skills to what they're actually looking for. I do hiring now, and there are so many people just plagiarizing the job description and not properly selling that they actually have experience doing what we're looking for help with and not just running their resume through AI to try and be the perfect match.

Be careful about using AI to do this when you don't know how to write a good resume, because you're not going to catch the errors if you don't bother to learn - I've had folks download their AI resume, assume it's good to go because a computer did it for them, only for the final product to look like a middle school project. You also have to keep in mind that you're not unique using AI - if you and 10 other people with your same experience and skill level make an AI resume, it's going to read the same across all of your resumes and it's going to be harder to stand out to get picked for the interview. 

You'll list all your jobs in the past 10 years in your background check, your resume should be the top relevant highlights of experience for the position you're going for. Your job at tacobell in the 10th grade is irrelevant to being a project manager, leave it off. 

Lead your bullet points with success. Rather than framing it like 'Launched program and developed team doing xyz reducing metrics by', try 'reduced metrics by XYZ by launching program and developing team'. You increase your chances of the line actually being read in full by creating curiosity. 



*Interviews*

Develop your elevator pitch to answer 'tell me about yourself' and practice it so your delivery is smooth. It's basically a cover letter but delivered verbally that gives you a chance to tell your story and address gaps in your career or experience. I typically deliver why I don't have a degree here so we can get it out of the way, as people are always curious. 

Pre-select experience you have that matches the skills they're looking for in the job description, and practice responding to interview questions with those stories in mind. I recommend the STAR method (framing the story in situation, task, action, and result)

Make sure that 'I don't know' is never a complete answer. You can explain what you would do in that situation, or what steps you'd take to figure out how to solve the problem even if you don't have an answer right in front of you. I can train you on a new process or tool, I can't train you to think for yourself or to recognize where your social skills need to kick in. 

There are 4 key skills you need to focus on presenting in your interview, whether they're listed in the job description or not - being a team player, knowing when to ask for help, being adaptable, and owning solutions. If you have all four of those, your chances of the closing the interview are incredibly high, as long as you have the experience/skills they need to back it up. 

  
**Mentorship**

Don't listen to just anyone about how to grow your career, look for people who came from a similar starting point as you, they'll understand how much detail or background info you'll need to progress in the same way. Folks who just walked into a manager job straight out of college don't get the level of scrappiness you need to climb through the early parts of your career because it was handed to them right out of college, and once you're in your first managerial role out of entry level, you get a lot more guidance from your managers on how to progress compared to the overworked ones managing entry level. 

If you're truly stuck on how to get started, look up job training programs like Pursuit or YearUp, apprenticeships run by companies like Accenture or Deloitte for no-degree adults or other local non-profits focused on skilling up driven low-income students. They're really annoying to find, they don't seem to believe in SEO on their websites, but I volunteer for these types of programs as a career coach and my matched mentees have gone on to get positions they never dreamed of being capable of landing. 

  
**Conclusion**

I don't believe in pulling the ladder up behind me, so I hope you can take away at least something from my pointers. I'm sure there are others I'm not thinking of right now, so please ask and maybe it'll jog my memory to continue to add to the list. ",11,1752889624.0,careeradvice,11,0.82,False

So for this rendition I filled the cup about a third of the way with watermelon juice, poured a double shot of espresso on top, placed a dollop of vanilla-almond whipped cream on top (to mimic the flavors of a sugar cookie), and finished it off with a dusting of powdered cheerios.

She was tired of fighting and struggling all the time. It seemed just as one problem was solved, another one soon followed.


Her father, a chef, took her to the kitchen. He filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire. Once the three pots began to boil, he placed potatoes in one pot, eggs in the second pot, and ground coffee beans in the third pot.


He then let them sit and boil, without saying a word to his daughter. The daughter, moaned and impatiently waited, wondering what he was doing.


After twenty minutes he turned off the burners. He took the potatoes out of the pot and placed them in a bowl. He pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl.


He then ladled the coffee out and placed it in a cup. Turning to her he asked. “Daughter, what do you see?”


“Potatoes, eggs, and coffee,” she hastily replied.
“Look closer,” he said, “and touch the potatoes.” She did and noted that they were soft. He then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg. Finally, he asked her to sip the coffee. Its rich aroma brought a smile to her face.


“Father, what does this mean?” she asked.
He then explained that the potatoes, the eggs and coffee beans had each faced the same adversity– the boiling water.


However, each one reacted differently.
The potato went in strong, hard, and unrelenting, but in boiling water, it became soft and weak.
The egg was fragile, with the thin outer shell protecting its liquid interior until it was put in the boiling water. Then the inside of the egg became hard.


However, the ground coffee beans were unique. After they were exposed to the boiling water, they changed the water and created something new.
“Which are you,” he asked his daughter. “When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a potato, an egg, or a coffee bean? “


In life, things happen around us, things happen to us, but the only thing that truly matters is what happens within us.

I turn 40 in October.) I think I'm pretty good at it. Recently (i.e. the last 6 years), I've worked at a local bakery. Small breakfast/lunch menu, but mostly pastries and coffee. I love the atmosphere, and the business is successful.

BUT it's been made clear that there is no room for advancement for me. At one point, during the pandemic, my boss offered me a sous position ""if and when"" things got back to normal. Meanwhile, I got pregnant with my second kid, so things kind of fell by the wayside.

1m3jz6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1m3jz6u/friend_boundaries_when_married/,Friend boundaries when married?,"Hi everyone 
My husband and I have been married for 2.5 years. I’ve never trusted anyone as much as I’ve trusted him. He’s been my best friend for 6+ years. When he took a new job to keep us here, a female was doing his onboarding. I guess they were friendly with each other but nothing more than that. I never had really heard about her for years. 

Fast forward to the beginning of this year, I noticed my husband was texting her a ton. Like all the time. I was sitting on the couch and trying to talk to him and he would always be half in, half out of our conversations not listening and I had to repeat myself multiple times. I did see some messages and it was nothing questionable, mostly just memes, house links (she was moving and so were we at the time) and some job stuff etc. I let it go for a bit, though I was bothered. 
A week or so later it kept happening so I finally asked my husband why he is texting her so much and if he realized I’m feeling neglected. It did cause a bit of a tiff, but then he realized that his amount of texting was borderline inappropriate so he stopped texting as much. This person is still heavily involved in his day to day work life but from a different state now. However, they do go on travel trips together usually another person is there too. It depends. 

My husband told me he thinks I’d be friends with her, so I kindly went on a coffee date with her maybe a month later. The conversation was fine, until she said “I don’t know if your husband told you, but we’re going to *not naming the exact place* in a couple weeks” and then flipped her hair over her shoulder. I was kind of caught off guard, because of course I know my husbands work travel schedule. It just seemed a bit off to me. I did tell my husband about this and all he said was “I can’t imagine she’d do that”. 
Anyways, my husband says they don’t text much anymore but they do Snapchat. And they Snapchat like every day, but he says they don’t. I literally see it. Mind you, we’re like 30 years old. I admit, and I did tell him, I looked at his phone once just to see. This really hurt his trust I guess. He has a past of an ex going through his phone and vice versa but it’s never been an issue with us. I just did it because I wanted to see and then I told him right after. I probably should have just asked him but… too late for that. I didn’t find anything except the sheer amount of messages. He still kind of throws in my face that I looked at his phone. But now that they’re on Snapchat, I don’t know what goes on on there. To me, the solution wasn’t “stop texting as much and move to another app”. 
It’s just an odd friendship to me and I feel like my husband has neglected my feelings around this. I most definitely don’t want to tell him who he can and can’t be friends with but this friendship just seems odd. Even his long time friends he never texts that much. I just feel like there is some kind of boundary that needs to be respected if your spouse is feeling uncomfortable regarding a friendship? Has anyone ever experienced anything like this? What did you do?

*Wednesday, 16. July*  
We arrive at Toronto Union Station shortly before 8am, a bit over 2 hours before the train leaves Toronto. We've enjoyed four days in the city and loved it, but now we're excited for the train journey, which is why we're extra early. As we're in sleeper plus (berths), we head to the Via Rail lounge for check-in. Two things become clear immediately: 1) Age-wise, we seem to be a bit below the sleeper plus average. I'm 31, my partner is 27, most people we see in the lounge are around retirement age. 2) Arriving early was a very good idea. We join the queue for check-in with only four parties ahead of us, finish the check-in as well as the meal reservation within 10 minutes, and leave the lounge to hand our huge backpacks over to checked luggage. When we return, the queue for check-in starts well outside the lounge.   
As check-in continues and the lounge fills up, we realize that there are quite a few younger folks after all - a family with two young kids, a group of friends, a few younger couples, and solo travelers. 

  
Boarding is announced at 9.25 and we head to the train to find our berths, Upper and Lower 3 in Carriage 16. We're amazed by how spacious and comfortable the seats are, so much so that we ignore the advice I got from reddit and don't head to the dome car right away, instead opting to watch the start of our journey from our seats. Our attendant explains the safety features of our car, we say hi to the travelers in the other berths and then we're off. The train leaves the inner city at a low speed, which will be the case for many parts of the journey. For us, being used to European high speed trains, it's a surprising but very welcome change of pace.

  
15 minutes into the journey, we make for the dome car anyway, because we heard rumors of a welcome drink. To our surprise, we find it almost empty. I get a mimosa, my partner (who doesn't drink alcohol) gets a canapé style snack, and for the next two hours, we watch as the suburbs slowly disappear in favor of trees, lakes, more trees and more lakes. Have I mentioned trees? Jokes aside, it's green and vast and beautiful, and to two people from rather densely populated Switzerland mind-blowingly empty. I stay in the dome car until lunch, but my partner returns to our seats for a nap and to layer up. The AC on the train is quite strong, so if you do the trip, bring a hoodie or a jacket. By the end of the trip, my partner was wearing both.

We're on the third seating for our meals on the first day, so we get called to lunch shortly after 2 pm. Third seating turns out to be the right decision for us, because the restaurant car is half empty and the meals are quiet and relaxed. Even though there is plenty of room, we're still seated with another couple, which is great because you get to meet new people for every meal.  
Rose, the server, tells us bad train jokes and introduces the other servers and the chefs to us. I order the chicken sandwich, and my partner has the mushroom mezze flatbread. Both are delicious. Dessert is a brownie or vanilla ice cream. We order one of each and mix them. 

We spend the afternoon in the activity car. Trivia and beer tasting is announced, and we get roped into it, despite being neither good at trivia nor fond of beer. But because Melissa, our activity coordinator, is an absolute star, it's a fun experience nonetheless. If you ever travel with Melissa, give her some love. She told us public speaking is still something she's afraid of and she's doing an amazing job with it.

There is a 20 min stop at Capreol and we step out to stretch our legs. I take the opportunity to get some exercise in and try to run from one end of the train to the other and back again. The train is longer than I thought, however, and I barely manage it with my dignity intact. 

Dinner is chicken breast with mashed potatoes for me and veggie lasagna for my partner. Again, it's very good, and we have to skip dessert (two varieties of chocolate cake) because we're too full. 

We return to our seats afterwards to find our berths set up for the night. They look very cosy. The beds are wide and the thick curtains provide more privacy than I thought they would. Climbing into your berth feels a bit like getting into a very cozy cave. My partner takes upper berth and I take lower. It's not even 10pm, but the movement of the train rocks me to sleep almost instantly.

*Thursday, 17. July*

I wake up before 5 am, after a very comfortable night in my berth. I'm an early riser and I love mornings, so I get a coffee from the activity car, climb back into my berth and spend the next two hours snuggled up into my blanket, sipping coffee, staring out of the window. Paradise. Over night, the deciduous forests have mostly disappeared in favor of evergreen trees. It looks more boreal now, wilder than before, and both the trees and the lakes look darker to me. 

My partner wakes up at 7.30 and we head for breakfast half an hour later. It's not too busy. Breakfast is served from 06.30 to 08.30, and most people on the train seem to prefer earlier meals. We both have the chef's omelette (with mushrooms and feta) as well as some toast. 

We spend the morning first in the dome car, which is still not too full, and later in our seats. There is no phone service, but looking out of the window doesn't get boring. Because of the crew change in Winnipeg, which is scheduled at 7.30pm, there are only two meal seatings on day 2. We opt for the first seating, so lunch is at 11 am already. We're not too hungry, but the lentil dal is great nonetheless. We share a salted caramel brownie for dessert, because we'd never skip a salted caramel brownie. 

After lunch we take on the challenge of a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle in the activity car. Yes, we're a lot of fun at parties. We try to finish it before the wine tasting and bingo activity in the afternoon, but because my partner leaves me hanging about half way through in favour of another nap, I have to finish the thing with a wine glass in one hand and a bingo card next to it. Not the kind of multitasking I'm used to.

Dinner is pork chop for me and tofu for my partner. It's great, but because there are only two seatings, the car is busy and loud. We definitely prefer the quiet of the third seating. After dinner, we spend the rest of the trip in the dome car, where we watch the landscape change once we cross the border from Ontario to Manitoba. The forests stop rather abruptly and then there's farms, grass, flatness and a lot of sky. I grew up and still live surrounded by mountains, so this is mind-boggling to me.

We've had a delay of almost 3 hours for most of day 2, but shortly after entering Manitoba, the train takes up more speed and it has fewer stops to let freight trains pass, so we approach Winnipeg faster than expected. In the end, we arrive with only a 90 minute delay, and my partner and I have to hurry to gather up our stuff, say goodbye to everyone, tip the staff (who were amazing from start to finish) and leave the train. We can collect our checked baggage after a 15 minute wait and leave the station for our Airbnb.

All in all, the first leg of our trip was even more amazing than I'd expected. The train is beautiful and cozy, as are the berths, the food is great and the staff are stellar. Just sitting there and watching the landscapes go by, talking to other travelers, and enjoying some time away from anything phone or wifi is a welcome change of pace. We're staying in Winnipeg now, which is also a change of pace compared to Toronto. Our trip continues on the 21st, when we will board the next train to go to Edmonton.

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke. It was our song remastered",1,1752888930.0,Tik_tok_stories,0,1.0,False
1m3jxjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/1m3jxjn/help_with_town_expropriating_our_waterfront/,Help with Town expropriating our waterfront access to make it into public access.,"Hello. I posted this elsewhere but people just insulted me and blamed me because they have no house and tell me that I should be grateful to have a house. Should I be ashamed or sorry that I worked two jobs to pay for my 3 university degrees and continued to become more knowledgeable to help those I served? I grew up in a poor working class family. I learned to budget and to do without. I have never had a Starbucks’s coffee. I carry my own to save. 

My inquiry: 

I live about 40 mins north of Barrie. Since we could not afford a waterfront house on Lake Simcoe, we bought a house that shared a legal private access, in common, with other residents in the subdivision. This was legally established by the Developer. The deeded private access was deliberately established by the developer to increase the value of their lots and the number of lot sales. 
We pay extra taxes as this private access increases the value of our home. Without it, the value of our house, our only investment, will be drastically reduced. In addition the illegal parking on our street and the partying all hours of the night will take away the peace I paid to have. 

We would never have bought this house if our lawyer had not looked into this and told us that we did own the lot, in common, with others. 

The illegal point is that expropriation must be fair and necessary. 

We have 5 other public beaches just on our street! Is it necessary to have 6? In addition, the town we live 10 minutes away from has very large public beaches with all facilities, splash pad, two large beaches and a huge inflatable obstacle course on the water. 

In addition, we have a Provincial Park at the end of our road and another about 10 minutes away. Anyone can get a free day pass with their library card. 

Does anyone have any ideas how we can keep the property we paid to have and stop an expropriation that is neither fair nor necessary? 

We have not been properly notified and meetings about this have all been closed meetings. 

From what I understand, the Town must follow legal rules but it seems that it is all a secret. There was a notice on their website but some in our community do not have Internet because the Town officials took a Federal grant to improve Internet services for everyone in Town but they used the entire grant to upgrade the services at Town buildings and only those closeby. 

Several of us have asked to be better informed and have a say but not one of us has received any response. 

Any help or pointers to help us would be greatly appreciated. 

Two of us hired a lawyer but $10,000.00 later we have not had any forward movement and the Town does not respond to their inquiries either. 

Thanks to all of you. A very huge thank you to all who take the time to help us. Most residents are seniors on limited pensions as am I.  We have tried many things but the Town is the body who examines the reasons for expropriation so they approve themselves. 

So grateful to all who help us! 

(If you read this and just want to abuse me for asking a reasonable question, please move on. I am very ill, a cancer survivor but it is expected to come back. We bought this house as it was a peaceful, quiet community and as a former competitive swimmer, I could swim. This expropriation is about much more than land. I would have loved to have the money to buy a waterfront house but I did not.) ",0,1752888895.0,legaladvicecanada,5,0.1,False

She only makes it once a year, and it’s legendary. People literally fight over the last slice.

One year, things got… strange.

After dinner, we were all stuffed and waiting for dessert. Grandma went into the kitchen, opened the fridge—and gasped. The pecan pie was gone. Just… vanished. She thought someone had moved it. We all started searching the kitchen like it was a crime scene. Cabinets, drawers, the oven—nothing.

Then the accusations started. My uncle swore it was my little cousin. My cousin blamed the dog. My grandpa sat there calmly sipping coffee like he knew something but wasn’t saying.

After almost 20 minutes of mild chaos, we heard a muffled noise. We followed it to the laundry room—and there, we found our dog Max sitting next to the laundry basket… and a half-eaten pecan pie inside it, tin and all.

Turns out, Grandpa had snuck an early slice and hid the rest in the laundry room to “save it for later.” But Max had a better nose and a faster game plan. Grandpa just laughed and said, “Well, I didn’t expect him to be a pie thief.”

Needless to say, now every year someone brings a “backup” pecan pie—just in case Max (or Grandpa) tries anything funny again.",2,1752888419.0,family,1,1.0,False
