1qh8kag,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/1qh8kag/manager_wanted_me_to_track_my_time_better_so_i/,Manager wanted me to “track my time better” so I tracked every single second," I work at a mid-sized marketing agency and my manager has always been weirdly obsessive about timesheets. We bill clients hourly so I get that accuracy matters but she takes it to an insane level. A few months ago she called me into her office because apparently my timesheet from the previous week “didn’t add up properly” even though I’d logged my 40 hours like normal.

She went on this whole rant about how I need to be more precise, account for every minute of my day, and that “roughly 2 hours on client emails” wasn’t acceptable anymore. She wanted exact timestamps and detailed descriptions of every single task. She literally said “I want to know what you’re doing every moment you’re being paid.”

Fine. 

I started logging everything. And I mean everything. 9:02-9:07am: Booted computer and waited for software to load. 9:07-9:11am: Checked emails, 3 were spam, deleted. 9:11-9:14am: Walked to break room for coffee. 9:14-9:16am: Waited for coffee to brew. You get the idea.

I even logged the time I spent filling out my timesheets which started taking like 45 minutes a day because of how detailed she wanted them. I found this weird vintage flip clock at a thrift store and put it on my desk specifically so I could log time changes down to the exact minute when the numbers flipped over.

I’d researched getting those industrial time tracking devices on Alibaba at one point thinking maybe that would help but honestly the manual logging was more satisfying. After two weeks of submitting these insanely detailed timesheets she called me in again, clearly annoyed, and told me to “just use common sense” and go back to rough estimates.

The kitchen and workstation were extremely, and I mean EXTREMELY dirty, the dishwasher didn’t clean properly (items came out still dirty), there were no clean cloths or sponges, and a cleaning checklist on the wall hadn’t been ticked in what looked like a long time. I raised concerns with the manager and was basically told not to worry about it. After seeing the behind the scenes and how things were being handled, I personally wouldn’t feel comfortable buying food or coffee there ever again.

Training also felt very rushed. I was told I’d be serving customers the next day, even though I hadn’t been properly trained on most of the drinks yet.

I want to be a barista, but I don’t think I can work in an environment like that. Is this common in cafes, or does this sound like a badly run location?

1qh8gx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1qh8gx7/my_roommate_turned_our_living_room_into_his/,My roommate turned our living room into his personal storage unit and I'm losing it,"

I live with one roommate (late 20s) in a small 2 bed apartment. When we moved in, we agreed the living room would stay pretty minimal because it’s the only shared space that doesn’t feel cramped. Fast forward a few months and it’s basically become his overflow closet. It started with a couple Amazon boxes “for a day or two” and then it turned into stacks of random stuff: a folded treadmill, three storage bins, a guitar case, a second office chair, and a pile of clothes he “needs to sort”. He also keeps bringing home free furniture from curb finds, “just in case it’s useful”, and then it sits there for weeks. The worst part is he acts like it’s normal because he technically isn’t putting it in my room. But it makes the living room unusable. I can’t even sit on the couch without staring at a wall of junk and smelling that weird dusty thrift smell. When friends come over I’m embarassed because it looks like we’re half moved-in forever. I’ve tried being chill about it. I asked him directly, nicely, if he could move his stuff into his room or at least consolidate it so we can use the space again. He said “yeah yeah totally” and then did nothing. If I bring it up again he gets weirdly defensive, like I’m attacking him as a person. He’ll say stuff like “I’m busy, I work a lot” or “it’s not even that much” while stepping over a box to get to the TV. Meanwhile he still uses the living room like a personal workshop, leaving tools and little screws on the coffee table. Last week I found a half eaten granola bar on the arm of the couch and a sticky ring from an energy drink on my side table. I’m not even a neat freak, but I want the common area to be a common area, not his storage locker. I’m at the point where I’ve started spending more time in my bedroom just to avoid it, which feels dumb because I pay rent too. I don’t want a huge blow up, but I also don’t want to keep living like I’m sharing a space with a hoarder-in-training. How do you deal with a roommate who hears you, agrees, and then just… keeps doing the same thing  every week?

1qh8f8j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qh8f8j,Simmons hide-a-bed?,"Context: We have a small office where a “chair and a half” with a pullout bed would be ideal. Much wider than that and the room will feel pretty cramped. We figure having a twin pullout will be nice on the rare occasion we have an overflow of overnight guests (e.g., good for a niece/nephew when their parents are in our main guest room). 

We found this Simmons unit a couple hours from us that’s a perfect size for that space (54” wide). And seems to be in really good shape. 

Few questions: 

1. Has anyone sat on one of these before? I don’t expect it to be the most comfortable thing in the world, but the cushions look decent from the photos…Comfortable enough to sit for a while, have a coffee, read a book, play a guitar? You know, things you do in an office :)

2. What year/decade (roughly) would you guess this to be? 

3. Any idea of what it’s worth — assuming all the upholstery and the bed mechanism are intact?

4. Has anyone come up with good solutions to improve the comfort of these hide-a-bed mechanisms? I saw a flexible platform online you can place below the mattress that supposedly folds/stores inside the sofa (which prevents you from feeling the metal bar). Folks have also talked about changing out the mattress. And of course, adding a memory foam topper. Would gladly accept any recommendations on how to enhance the sleeping experience. It’s rare it’ll be slept on but nice to have something tolerable when it does happen.

This is our forever home and we have been trying to collect some fun true midcentury pieces to pepper in some character. This Sofa seems pretty neat. Reminds me of something my grandparents would have had. But if the sitting experience is atrociously uncomfortable, we might look at other options.

Strengths include:

• Enthusiasm disproportionate to the situation

• Loyal sidekick energy

• Will absolutely clap when you enter a room

Weaknesses include:

• One bad day away from a musical number

• Cannot resist a bit

• Sometimes needs reassurance and a nap

Seeking: another Muppet (or a tolerant human) who enjoys laughter, cozy chaos, and understands that life is better when you lean into the silliness and hug it aggressively.

Vitals:

\* Soft where it counts, sharp where it matters.

\* Laughs loudly, lives fully, and knows the difference between a red flag and a red herring.

\* Witty as hell, a little wicked, and blessed with thighs that could crack a walnut—and your willpower.

\* Equal parts naughty and nice—think sultry giggle with a side of sarcasm and a dash of “did she just say that?”

You:

Bonus points if you cook, quote movies mid-conversation, or can keep up with playful teasing. If you’ve got biceps, brains, or just a sexy beard and the ability to make me laugh till sparkling water shoots out my nose—you’re already ahead.

Likes:

Sarcasm, clever foreplay, long nights, longer mornings, and being kissed like we’re breaking at least three minor laws.

Dislikes:

Growing up, I was not really allowed to go anywhere, even if I did, she would keep texting me to go home. I just wanted to hang out with friends like a normal person, we were never doing anything bad either. I never made new friends because she did not allow me to go out with friends if there was someone she did not know as they were stranger danger. I grew up really anxious and shy as well, I was scared of everything and anything which ended up in me having 0 passion, no interest and hobbies as I grow up.

Now, I realize I am like this because of her and all her anxieties are projected onto me BUT I refuse to live this way. I am starting to learn what I like and I find myself really into tennis so I got myself in a tennis community. Instead of being happy for me, she says I go out too much and its dangerous to play tennis at night. What if I get kidnapped at night, what if I meet a rapist, there’s plenty of bad guys at night. I know there’s always a risk but I cannot stay scared at home forever right? I don’t think she realizes this. I recently got a remote job as well and I have been working from cafes a lot since it gets boring at home. She tells me to not leave my drink unattended so if I use the restroom and my drink is full, I would have to buy another drink. She did not say it in an advicey way but said it like in a controlling way like if I left it unattended, there is a 100% chance I would be drugged. I mean how can she shit on something that makes my working day a little more enjoyable? I calmly told her I am not doing that and she then says I never listen to her advice anymore and sulks. It would make sense if I were in a club or a bar, but its just me in a cute little local coffee shop working on my laptop. Its so frustrating because yes mom I know this world has risks but it is exhausting to live in fear, I am cautious of my surroundings as well but its not necessary to live in fear 24/7.

I know these are small examples but to me they are big steps which I am proud of. I do feel guilty for always dismissing my mom but I just wanna experience life without the impending doom that someone might do something bad and I might die if I am not alert.

I’m writing here because I don’t know who to ask. I (35F) have a friend, Eliza (34F), who has been married to Larry (37M) for three years. I’ve never really liked the guy, but I never had any reason to suspect until recently.

Lately, I’ve noticed some things that make me think that Larry is behaving in an abusive way towards Eliza. When we’re all together, he dismisses her opinions, and makes rude comments about her, from ridiculing her appearance to questioning her intelligence. When she’s perceived to be “too friendly” with another male in his presence, he gets angry and blows up at her, screaming at her and insulting her, even in public.

And I’ve been noticing that she gets bruises sometimes, in different parts of her body. I asked her about them, but the excuses she gives sound more like justifications. “Yeah, sometimes he’s grabbed me hard, but he just wanted to make sure I was paying attention to him”. “Yeah, once he slapped me because I was distracted, but it’s not his fault, he’s just not aware of his own strength”. “Yeah, he choked me during sex, but that’s not real, just playing a role”. I tried to talk to her about it, but she just doesn’t listen.

Some days ago, we met at a coffee shop and when I saw Eliza, I found it hard to keep my composure. I don’t want to go into details, but she looked like she someone who had gotten a good beating. She tried to give some excuse, but at this point I all but begged her to leave Larry, telling her that I was scared for her life, and that she couldn’t spend one more second with this man. For a moment, she was quiet. Then she started shrieking like a banshee. She shouted at me that I don’t understand her relationship, that he’s the love of her life and will never leave him, and so on. At this point, something in me snapped. There’s only so much empathy you can have for someone who keeps willingly walking into danger with a smile on her face. So I told her that I’m sorry, but I can’t keep being her friend anymore, and that maybe she’ll thank me when she’s dead. Then I left her, while she was still shouting.

I told my husband later, and he believes I did the right thing. But apparently, some people from our friend group have found out, and are calling me an asshole for abandoning a friend trapped in an abusive relationship. But I can’t do this anymore, I just can’t.

I really need some guidance because I’m getting mixed opinions from two dentists.

Background

About 2 years ago, I had crowns placed on my front 4 upper incisors after an accident. I never had any issues with them until recently.

What happened

About 2 weeks ago, I started feeling pain when drinking hot coffee. The pain was mild but kept happening whenever I had anything hot.

Then, about 4 days ago, I suddenly had severe pain, couldn’t even touch the crowns, and also had a strong headache. After a painkiller and a nap, the pain went away. But later that night, I had recurring pain that kept waking me up.

By the next morning, I had visible swelling under my upper lip and on my right cheek.

Dentist #1 (original crown dentist)

He did an exam and X-ray. He said:
	•	My right lateral incisor is fully infected.
	•	The canine next to it is starting to get infected.
	•	Need to wait for swelling to reduce with antibiotics.
	•	After that → root canal treatment (RCT).
	•	For RCT, I have 2 choices:
	1.	Remove the crowns, do RCT, and put crowns back, OR
	2.	Drill a hole through the back of the crown for RCT and then seal it.

Dentist #2 (second opinion today)

Swelling is now about 10% left.

She examined the area and said:
	•	She sees pus at the root of the lateral incisor.
	•	The canine is fine and doesn’t need treatment.
	•	Since I currently don’t have pain, she wants me to wait one more week.
	•	She asked me to stop painkillers and see if the pain returns.
	•	She says it might have been caused by pressure on the incisor, and antibiotics (amoxicillin) might fix the issue without needing RCT.
	•	If pain comes back → RCT is needed.

Current Symptoms
	•	Swelling almost gone (around 10%).
	•	No pain right now.
	•	I can drink hot coffee without any pain or sensitivity at the moment.
	•	On antibiotics (amoxicillin).
	•	Stopped painkillers as instructed.

My confusion

One dentist says definite RCT, the other says wait and maybe antibiotics will solve it.

But I’ve read that:
	•	Antibiotics can reduce swelling,
	•	But cannot cure a tooth infection if the nerve is dead or if there’s pus visible on the X-ray.

I’m worried about delaying treatment but also don’t want unnecessary RCT if there’s a chance antibiotics fixed it.

My questions for the dentists here:
	1.	If there is pus visible on the X-ray, is RCT almost always required, even if pain disappears?
	2.	Can an infection like this heal permanently with just antibiotics?
	3.	Is it safe to wait a week to see if symptoms return?
	4.	Should the canine be treated preventively if it was “starting to get infected” as dentist #1 said?
	5.	For crowned incisors, is it better to:
	•	remove the crown and re-cement after RCT, or
	•	drill through the back of the crown?

Any guidance would really help. Thank you so much.

I also have had stomach ulcers in the past at 18 with no H Pylori, and possibly suspected stomach ulcers now as well.  I will be getting a fluoroscopy in a few weeks to see what the state of things in my stomach are.

About a month ago I had 3-4 gallbladder attacks in RUQ radiating to my back within a few weeks and one of them was so painful it sent me to the ER.  I had slightly elevated lipase at 160. 

I do not usually have attacks, but I do have acid reflux (which may be bile reflux I’m not sure) and occasionally mid abdomen pains above my belly button that I suspected were a return of ulcers.  I have never been able to eat very acidic foods including coffee because of this.

I’m starting to wonder what problems are linked to my stomach, what is linked to my gall bladder, and if it’s possible for biliary dyskinesia to cause stomach ulcers?

At this point I’m trying to decide if it is worth having my gallbladder removed or if I should wait to have it removed since my symptoms are currently not unbearable.

Has anyone else gotten their gallbladder removed and seen a reduction in stomach ulcers, or thought they had stomach issues that were really their gallbladder problems?

I’m also concerned about developing chronic pancreatitis since the last time I had gallbladder issues at 18 I had lipase around 300 and I want to make sure this isn’t a secondary issue that is going to cause long term problems.

1qh7w50,https://www.reddit.com/r/frugaluk/comments/1qh7w50/am_i_being_too_frugal/,Am I being too frugal?,"I find myself asking this question more frequently as I feel myself getting annoyed/frustrated at my partners spending habits. I will start by saying first off we both are fortunate to be on good incomes and we do not have any significant debts and are able to save at the end of each month.

My partner has the mentality that any money she has not set aside as part of her “budget” she can spend without much thought, as she has already done the “budgeting” beforehand, whereas I will evaluate each spend on its own merits, which I admit can be more mentally taxing.

So, when it comes to things like groceries, my partner will buy the items she wants without shopping around and get it from the local Sainsbury’s when she feels like it rather than planning ahead and getting the same items cheaper at the big supermarket when we do our weekly shopping, or wait until the item is on offer.

Same with buying other “discretionary” items (like a new coffee machine/set of earphones etc), if my partner feels she wants something, she will often just buy it even if waiting a few months means she could get it on sale for cheaper. And for example with things like clothes, if the same item has one colour on sale, my partner might still chose the other colour not on sale as they prefer that colour.

Also she is generally more willing to pay for convenience/comfort, such as getting a food delivery when it would be cheaper to go collect, paying to upgrade her seat for flights whereas I would be more reluctant to do such things.

I have had conversations about this with my partner and she feels that I am being too frugal and am allowing money to create more problems in our life. I feel that there is truth to this and so was wondering how others on this sub deal with treading the line between positive frugality and being too frugal, and also how to deal with the negative emotions which come with not always getting a “good deal”.

1qh7poo,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_lushaurra_in/comments/1qh7poo/stop_doing_these_things_if_you_want_clear_skin/,Stop Doing These Things If You Want Clear Skin Naturally,"Clear skin is often misunderstood. Many people believe that buying more skincare products, following every viral trend, or constantly changing routines will magically fix their skin. In reality, clear and healthy skin usually comes from **stopping certain habits**, not adding more steps.

If you are struggling with acne, dullness, pigmentation, uneven texture, or recurring breakouts, the real issue might not be your products — it could be your daily skincare and lifestyle mistakes.

In this guide, we’ll discuss the **most common things you must stop doing if you want clear skin naturally**, and what you should do instead for long-term results.

https://preview.redd.it/i87nazd7ubeg1.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be663fad3387848c656c523415a4c122cd7bd882

# 1. Over-Washing Your Face – 

One of the biggest skincare myths is that washing your face frequently keeps it clean and acne-free.

In reality, washing your face more than necessary:

* Strips natural oils
* Weakens the skin barrier
* Triggers excess oil production
* Causes irritation and breakouts

When your skin feels tight after washing, that is a sign of damage — not cleanliness.

# What to do instead to achieve clear skin naturally

* Cleanse **only twice a day** (morning and night)
* Use a **gentle, non-foaming cleanser**
* After workouts, rinse with water if needed instead of harsh cleansing

# 2. Using Too Many Products at the Same Time

Layering multiple serums, actives, toners, and treatments may look luxurious, but it often does more harm than good.

Using too many products can:

* Overload the skin
* Cause reactions and breakouts
* Make it hard to identify what’s actually working

Skin needs consistency and simplicity to heal.

# What to do instead to achieve clear skin naturally

Stick to a **minimal routine**:

* Cleanser
* Moisturizer
* Sunscreen (daytime)

You can add treatments later, but only if truly needed.

# 3. Stop Blindly Following Viral Skincare Trends

Just because something is trending on social media doesn’t mean it’s safe for your skin.

Common harmful trends include:

* Ice facials
* Lemon or baking soda DIY masks
* Daily exfoliation
* Random use of strong active ingredients

Every skin type reacts differently, and trends rarely consider individual skin needs.

# What to do instead to achieve clear skin naturally

* Understand your **skin type**
* Introduce products slowly
* Avoid anything that burns, stings, or irritates your skin

# 4. Stop Skipping Sunscreen

Skipping sunscreen is one of the fastest ways to ruin your skin, even if you follow a perfect skincare routine.

Sun damage leads to:

* Dark acne marks
* Pigmentation
* Uneven tone
* Premature aging

UV rays affect the skin **every day**, not just in summer.

# What to do instead to achieve clear skin naturally

* Apply sunscreen **daily**
* Use it even on cloudy days
* Wear it indoors if you sit near windows

# Sunscreen is non-negotiable for clear skin.

# 5. Stop Expecting Overnight Results

Clear skin does not happen in days. Skin takes time to repair, regenerate, and balance itself.

When you constantly switch products:

* Your skin never stabilizes
* Breakouts become frequent
* Results get delayed

# What to do instead to achieve clear skin naturally

* Follow one routine for **at least 3–4 weeks**
* Observe gradual improvement
* Be patient and consistent

1qh7otr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheIronCouncil/comments/1qh7otr/the_psychology_of_fixing_98_of_your_problems_8/,The Psychology of Fixing 98% of Your Problems: 8 Science-Backed Habits,"I spent two years breaking down research from behavioural psychology, neuroscience, and 30+ self-improvement books because I was tired of the same recycled advice that doesn't actually work. What I found is that most people aren't lazy or broken; they're just stuck in patterns that feel impossible to escape. The good news? Small shifts in daily habits can literally rewire your brain and solve most problems you're facing. This isn't motivational fluff. It's based on real science and practical frameworks from people who've spent decades studying human behaviour.

Start with sleep consistency, not just sleep quantity.

Everyone knows you need 7-8 hours. But what actually matters more is going to bed and waking up at roughly the same time every day, even on weekends. Your circadian rhythm controls everything from mood to metabolism to decision-making ability. When you mess with it, you're basically operating with a handicapped brain. I learned this from Matthew Walker's book ""Why We Sleep,"" which is a deep dive into sleep science from a UC Berkeley neuroscience professor. The dude spent 20 years researching this stuff, and his findings are genuinely shocking. Like, sleep deprivation affects you worse than being drunk, but we just normalise it. This book will make you question everything you think you know about productivity and health. Once I locked in my sleep schedule, my anxiety dropped significantly, and I stopped making impulsive decisions that screwed me over later.

Do the hardest thing first

Cal Newport calls this ""deep work"" in his book Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World. Newport is a Georgetown computer science professor who studied the habits of high performers across industries. His main argument is that our brains are designed to avoid difficult cognitive tasks, so we fill our days with pseudo-productive busy work that feels good but accomplishes nothing. The solution is to block off your first 2-3 hours after waking for your most demanding task. No email, no meetings, no social media. Just you and the thing you've been avoiding. Your willpower is highest in the morning and depletes throughout the day, so use it wisely. This one habit alone probably solves like 60% of procrastination issues.

Move your body for 20 minutes daily.

Not for aesthetics or to punish yourself for eating pizza. But exercise is literally the most effective treatment for anxiety and depression, according to decades of research. Neuroscientist Wendy Suzuki at NYU found that even a single workout can improve your mood and focus for hours afterwards. She wrote ""Good Anxiety"", which breaks down how physical movement changes brain chemistry in ways that medications often can't. You don't need a gym membership or some intense program. Walk fast, do pushups, dance in your room. Just get your heart rate up consistently. I started using the Fitbod app to track strength training because it builds custom workouts based on available equipment and your fitness level, which removed the mental barrier of figuring out what to do at the gym.

Practice deliberate solitude

This sounds counterintuitive, but hear me out. Most people are never actually alone with their thoughts. We fill every quiet moment with podcasts, music, scrolling, and texting. Your brain needs time to process experiences and emotions without constant input. Johann Hari discusses this extensively in ""Stolen Focus: Why You Can't Pay Attention and How to Think Deeply Again."" Hari spent three years interviewing neuroscientists and psychologists about the attention crisis. His research shows that our brains are literally being rewired by constant stimulation, making it harder to think clearly or feel content. Schedule 15 minutes daily with zero stimulation. No phone, no music, no book. Just sit or walk and let your mind wander. It feels uncomfortable at first, but it becomes addictive once you realise how much clarity it provides.

Build a morning routine that energises you.

Not the cringe 5 am cold plunge optimisation bro stuff. Just a consistent sequence of small actions that signal to your brain ""we're starting the day intentionally."" Mine is simple: make bed, cold shower for two minutes, coffee while reading something thought-provoking for 20 minutes. The specific activities matter less than the consistency. James Clear explains this concept brilliantly in ""Atomic Habits"", which is probably the best book on behaviour change I've ever read. Clear spent years studying habit formation and breaks down the psychology of why small changes compound into massive results over time. 

For deeper learning on habit formation and other self-improvement topics, there's an AI-powered app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls from books like the ones mentioned here, plus research papers and expert talks, to create personalised audio content. You can customise the length and depth, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with detailed examples. It also builds adaptive learning plans based on your specific goals, like building better habits or improving focus. The team behind it includes Columbia alumni and former Google engineers, and the content goes through strict fact-checking. Worth checking out if you're trying to build a structured approach to personal growth.

Set hard boundaries with your phone

Your phone is designed by teams of engineers whose literal job is to make it as addictive as possible. You're not weak for being hooked, you're just human. Delete social media apps and only access them on a desktop if you must. Use the Screen Time feature to set daily limits. Put your phone in another room when you're working or spending time with people. I started using the Ash app for mental health check-ins, and it's been genuinely helpful for processing emotions throughout the day. It asks thoughtful questions and helps you recognise patterns in your mood and behaviour. Way better than doomscrolling when you're feeling anxious.

Journal for clarity, not perfection

You don't need to write beautiful prose or profound insights. Just dump your thoughts onto paper for 10 minutes before bed. Studies show that expressive writing helps process trauma, reduce anxiety, and improve decision-making. Psychologist James Pennebaker at UT Austin has published over 20 years of research proving that writing about emotional experiences literally improves immune function and psychological well-being. The key is writing about feelings AND trying to make sense of them, not just venting. Ask yourself questions like ""why did that bother me so much?"" or ""what pattern am I noticing here?"" This habit alone has probably saved me thousands in therapy costs.

Audit your inputs ruthlessly

You become what you consume. If you're constantly watching negative news, doom-scrolling Twitter drama, or hanging around people who complain nonstop, that's what your brain will default to. Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman talks about this on his podcast, the Huberman Lab, which is basically a masterclass in understanding how your brain works. He's a Stanford professor who breaks down complex neuroscience into practical tools anyone can use. Start paying attention to how different content makes you feel and cut out anything that leaves you feeling worse. Replace it with books, podcasts, and people who challenge you to grow. This isn't toxic positivity, it's just being selective about what gets access to your mental real estate.

The reality is that your brain is incredibly adaptable. Neuroplasticity means you can literally change your neural pathways through consistent behaviour. But it takes time and repetition. You can't just read this, feel inspired for three days, then go back to old patterns and expect different results. Pick two habits from this list and commit to them for 30 days. Actually commit. Once they feel automatic, add another. The compound effect of small daily improvements is absolutely wild once you stick with it long enough to see results. You're capable of way more than you think; you just need better systems.

* different degrees of grinding (eureka mignon)
* changed the pressure to 9 bar
* I tried different baskets (7 g, 15 g, 18g, 20g)

I tried a dangerous experiment and swapped the thermostat. I warmed the machine for 5 minutes (the light didn't turn on, of course) - the coffee was still incredibly sour.

Over time, I’ve learned that simply removing one obvious trigger isn’t always enough. I’ve been gluten-free for years due to clear skin and GI reactions, but that alone didn’t prevent or resolve my EoE symptoms. That realization pushed me to take a more structured approach instead of assuming I had already “covered” diet.

Over the past couple weeks, I slowed things down and treated elimination like an experiment rather than trial-and-error. I focused on removing additional common triggers and actually keeping them out long enough to see whether symptoms changed.

The biggest shifts for me have been:

* **Eliminating dairy**
* **Eliminating spicy foods**
* **Reducing acidic foods and drinks** (coffee, energy drinks, citrus, certain sauces)
* Paying closer attention to **meal timing and post-meal symptoms**, especially globus and throat awareness

What surprised me most was that improvement didn’t come from one dramatic change—it came from **stacking smaller eliminations consistently**. Over time, I’ve noticed less globus, less throat tightness, and less anticipatory stress around eating. It hasn’t cured EoE, but it’s reduced how much space it takes up in my daily life, which feels meaningful.

I want to be clear that I’m not anti-medication or anti-biologics. I know they’re essential and life-changing for many people. I just wanted to understand how far I could get with diet, consistency, and awareness first—and for my case, that’s made a noticeable difference so far.

One thing I don’t see discussed enough is the **mental load** of EoE. Even when symptoms improve, there’s still vigilance around food, social situations, and fear of setbacks. That’s a big reason I wanted to post this.

If anyone has questions or wants to compare experiences, feel free to **message me directly**. And I’d also love to hear:

* Are there any **support groups or communities** (online or in-person) that you’ve found genuinely helpful?
* For those who saw improvement with diet first—what helped you stay consistent long enough to see results?
* Did anyone identify triggers beyond the usual suspects that made a bigger difference than expected?

\* Graduated high school at age 16 but didn’t go to college.

\* Don’t have a car or a drivers license.

\* Spent a total of 17 years now in training to be a performer, specifically circus and I started booking my own gigs 6 years ago.

\* Finances are in the pit and I hardly have any work experience aside from one job when I was 16 because I’ve made it by on shows.

\* I inherited a house, it needs a lot of work but I don’t have the finances to fix it.

\* I have been going without things that I need like new glasses or new clothes because everything goes into performing or bills.

\* I lost the weight that I needed to lose in order to succeed in the industry but then I gained it all back plus more so I haven’t even been able to train because I’m repulsed by my existence.

\* I don’t have friends because honestly I’m just a negative energy that drains people, Im constantly am wrapped up in my failures and the disgust I have for myself.

Essentially I loved performing, now I feel like it was a waste of time and though I still want to be a performer I’m aware that I’m too fat now and people can want a lot but it doesn’t mean it’s going to happen.

Thing is that even if I give up performing then my size will drive me insane because everything comes back to of course that happened because I’m fat, an example is dropping a coffee cup or my phone and instantly I’m pissed off because the fat vibrated the item out of my hand.

I don’t think giving it up is the solution but I don’t want to waste more time, I’m so lost on what to do.

Is my life even repairable? The daily guilt and anxiety on top of repulsion for my entire existence is wrecking me.

Then I keep doing stupid things like binge eating which is honestly more of a punishment for my failures because I’ll fail more weight and lose more money when I know I only have a month of utilities saved.

About 2 months ago my fiancée and I were gifted a used J80. It was from a client of mine. Client had just upgraded to a newer model and said this Jura was just fine but may need some “reprogramming.” 

We plug it in and it seems to work perfectly. Immediately we are both so excited and can’t believe what we have been missing. This is FAR superior to basic our drip coffee. 

Within 1 week blissful coffee drinking from the Jura the machine starts to malfunction. It was clearly a computer issue. The screen was flashing and it wasn’t responding to button pushing. We tried all the troubleshooting we could find. It got to a point where the Jura would only turn on with a half dead screen and that’s it. It definitely wasn’t making any coffee. This all happened on a Monday morning before work. Back to our old drip coffee for now. 

We contact Jura and end up sending it in to get repaired. Figured it was worth the 500$ if it meant a working machine… 3ish weeks later, the Jura is back and working. Life is good. Mornings are happy…. For about a week. 

Another week day morning and I wake up to my fiancée looking like a crazed scientist with a headlamp on bent over the Jura. It isn’t working again. This time it won’t grind coffee. He located a stuck bean and was trying to extract it without breaking anything. Bean gets removed and machine still refuses to grind coffee. As fiancée is trying to move the machine off the counter to get a better view, Jura slips from his grip and crashes to the floor. The pour spouts have now broken off and Jura is worse off than a few minutes ago. 

Back to sad drip coffee again. 

Replacement parts are ordered. Machine is taken apart by us to clean the grind compartment. It’s GUNKY. There’s so much old bean residue and muck. We get that thing looking basically new aaannndddd beans still won’t grind. We tried everything. 

Parts arrive in the mail. We get the machine back together and decide that pre ground coffee will work for now. Putting beans in the machine seems to throw it into a meltdown and it won’t function until all beans have been removed. BUT for now, we have the Jura semi working a have coffee to drink. 

THIS morning I wake up to a similar scene where fiancée is bent over the Jura trying to get it to work. Again. It’s been maybe a week since we’ve had the parts back on and enjoying yummy ( pre ground ) coffee in the morning. This morning it decided it no longer wants to use ground coffee and also it no longer wants to accept the drip tray. 

We have officially decided this is the morning ruiner and the machine of bad vibes. We are going to buy ourselves a different automatic coffee machine within our budget. We’re hoping to spend about 600$ bucks give or take. 

There’s simply no going back to drip coffee.

MLK did not sell Hats, Shirts, Shoes, Watches, Coffee Cups, etc. MLK's object was not to build brand wealth and get wealthy. MLK wanted to help people.

But that’s kind of the point. If you don’t overreach, it’s one of the most forgiving places to travel.

The island only starts fighting you when you do two things.

You try to cover everything in one day. Or you treat it like a stamp hunt.

A cleaner way to plan is directional.

Hallasan sits in the middle. Everything else is North, East, South, West. Pick one, stay loyal to it for the day.

And the weather has a vote here. Wind, sudden rain, gray turns. So Plan B isn’t a backup plan. It’s just the plan.

North

Arrival mode friendly. Practical, clustered, low effort.

Hamdeok Beach for an easy first sea. Manjanggul if the sky flips. Andol Oreum if you want one clean view without committing your whole day.

East

The answer key for first timers.

Seongsan Ilchulbong still hits in daytime. Seopjikoji is basically a walk that doesn’t ask much. Then you end up in a small oceanfront cafe “for coffee” and lose an hour on purpose.

South

High satisfaction in a short window.

Jungmun makes logistics simple. Saekdal is an easy beach scene. Cheonjiyeon is a nature point that does not require a big hike.

West

Quiet rest energy. The drives feel like part of the trip.

Hyeopjae or Geumneung, a calm detour through Jeoji, then Songaksan for a wind-led coastal loop and a sunset finish.

Jeju feels safe because you don’t have to perform your trip here.

We have completely different personalities and often butt heads. I am more calm and level-headed whereas she is very fiery and outspoken. Nevertheless, she is my sister and still family so we always overcome our little fights and often make up after them. 

I practically raised her and my 2 other younger sisters and I always put their needs before mine. It kind of felt like I gave up a majority of my childhood and social life because they were my responsibility and I had to be there to watch after them while my parents worked full time. 

This past spring my bf of 8 years and I got engaged. He did it with the help of my family who were all so excited and went above and beyond planning the surprise. A couple weeks later, the aforementioned sister announced she would be moving cross-country. I realized I wouldn’t be spending much time with her until her move so I planned a coffee date with her. It went well but out of the blue she ended the morning by asking me not to ask her to be my MOH. I had plans to ask her and my next younger sister (22F) to split the role seeing as they’re both not the most responsible of people. It really hurt that she didn’t want to be a part of my special day and this was what made us decide to go without a wedding party which was a shock to to my whole family seeing as how us sisters were inseparable growing up.  

Two weeks after her move and after I had already sent out save the dates she texted me asking for a plus one. I had seen her go IG official with some guy but she never texted or called anyone in the family about her new relationship. I obviously told her no way. She is notorious for having short and unstable relationships in the past so I didn’t know how long they were going to last. I also didn’t want to be meeting anyone new on my wedding day. She got really mad and called me selfish and said she might not even go to my wedding anymore because he wasn’t invited and how could I make them both fly out here and get a hotel just to not let him attend? (Oh yeah she also wants me to pay for her hotel room since she assumed she’d stay in our guest room but thinks we’re horrible people for not wanting guests to sleep over on our wedding night) But I said I was more than happy to meet him the wedding weekend if he came out with her someplace other than the welcome party and wedding which are both invitation only. 

Now this past weekend, I was out having drinks with my 22 year old sister when she brought up how she’s looking forward to meeting said new bf at my welcome party. This took me by absolute shock seeing as how aforementioned a-hole sister never asked me and was already telling all the family that she was bringing him to meet everyone. I immediately texted her (probably not the best idea because I was a few drinks in) asking why she was bringing an uninvited guest to my welcome party. She said she already told everyone he was coming so it was too late. We went back and forth me mentioning how weddings aren’t cheap and we’re paying per person for food and drink then she says they wouldn’t have any anyways since she’s popping in to introduce him to everyone and then leaving to celebrate her best friend’s birthday. That really sent me over the edge and made me cry at the bar so I left it at that and gave myself a day to think about my response.

The next day, I sent her a lengthy message about how she might think I’m being a “bi\*ch” and “selfish” but it’s my wedding weekend and told her I’m going to put myself first for once and not make the welcome party/rehearsal dinner about her and her bf. Then I told her how hurtful it was that she wasn’t even going to be there all night and instead go out and celebrate her friend whose birthday comes every year but my wedding only comes once in a lifetime.

She responded with a very hurtful message about how her best friend is more of a sister than I ever was. And how I’m being petty and selfish. How I changed when I moved across the country to be with my now fiancé a few years back. Then she said “don’t count on me being there.”

She’s not entirely wrong about changing but I feel like I did for the better. I saw what a true partnership was while living with my fiancé. I saw how his family interacted with no belittling or bullying. How his parents actually got along and weren’t always on the brink of divorce. I feel like they helped me overcome my timidness and find a voice. They were actually visiting me from out of town when this argument unfolded and they were there to comfort me. They actually turned that sad night out at the bar into an impromptu bachelorette party to celebrate me. I’m so grateful for them and all the love and support they’ve shown me.

I really hope my sister changes her mind because even though we fight and don’t get along, she’s family and I’d hate for her to miss my big day.

For context, I returned to the UK from a two week vacation to the Caribbean on the 16th of Jan. I had my last cup of strong filter coffee at the airport on 2nd Jan. I unexpectedly went cold turkey as there was no coffee in the air bnb and took the opportunity to try and quit the bean as I have failed multiple times before. 

I dealt with the worst withdrawal symptoms (headaches, fatigue, irritability and mood swings) during the first week. On day 4/5 I had half a cup of black tea and a cola to take the edge off as it was spoiling my vacation. 

I can remember feeling fatigued one particular day in the second week of my vacation but most of the worst withdrawal symptoms were over by then. 

On the 15th of Jan, the day of our departure, I decided to have a cup of coffee as a treat as we’re staying in a different accomodation that had sachets of Nescafé coffee. 

The next day we land back in the UK and I am exhausted. I don’t blame the cup of coffee so much, I just had a bad sleep on the plane as I had an Abdul stomach ache during the night and the flight wasn’t long enough for a full night sleep anyway. 

Since returning I have spent most of my time in bed feeling too tired to do anything. I slept for about 14 hours on Friday night. I have been trying to go outside on short walks to get as much sunlight as possible (which isn’t much as it’s very dull and grey in the UK right now). Yesterday I spent most of the day in bed watching films. I took three naps throughout the day and went to sleep at about 0100 and woke up at 0900 today feeling drained. I got up had a shower and started feeling better so I went for a short walk to the shops but came home feeling drained. 

I have been fighting the urge to take a nap today. I have been trying to eat healthier and have taken my vitamins. I actually feel a little better after drinking some water with electrolytes. I go back to work tomorrow but I am on the late shift which doesn’t start until 3pm and I’ll finish at 11pm. Im just worried that I am going to be exhausted for that shift. 

I don’t know how much of this is jet lag/caffeine withdrawals/lack of sunlight in the uk. I don’t know if that little cup of instant coffee has knocked my progress backwards.

[Discussion],"i(29F) used to have so much fun getting dressed, even for regular NYC stuff like grabbing coffee or going into the office. Lately though, I’m standing in front of my closet like… why does everything feel kind of the same?

  
It’s not that I don’t have options. I’ve got the basics, a couple nicer pieces, shoes that should make outfits feel more intentional. But when I try to put together a look, it ends up being some variation of the same silhouette, the same colors, the same vibe. Either it’s too casual, or it feels like I’m trying too hard for no reason.

  
I also feel like a lot of what I see out and about is very “uniform” right now. Cute, yes. But it’s like we’re all rotating through the same handful of outfit formulas and calling it a day.

  
Is anyone else feeling this? If you got out of this rut, what actually helped? Like, was it adding one new category (a different outer layer, a different pant shape), choosing a color palette, accessories, or just taking a break from scrolling?

  
Would love to hear what’s making outfits feel fun again for you.",6,1768837049.0,fashionwomens35,4,1.0,False

I hope everything is okay with you.Or maybe some of you aren't okay right now. But that's okay too even though it's not okay. I don't know exactly what you're going through. Maybe you're stressed about money. Maybe you're struggling in a relationship. Maybe your health isn't where you want it to be. Or maybe something happened to you and you're feeling sad, isolated, or just not feeling good. I wish you love and happiness. Guys, I wrote something today. I thought I should share it on this forum too. I hope it's somehow helpful or beautiful. I know we all are on a beautiful journey of awakening and ascension. We are beautiful spirits. But at the same time, we are beautiful humans too. And sometimes we see separation in the world. We feel separated. Yeah, it looks like that sometimes. But it's not true. I hope whatever I wrote today is somewhat helpful. 

Imagine a bicycle is wholeness. When you see a bicycle, you see it as a whole with its parts that make it up - tires, frame, pedals, brakes, seat, handlebars, chain, gears.

But where's the bicycle in all of this? Is the tire a bicycle? Is the chain a bicycle? Is the frame a bicycle?

What if I take apart the tires and brakes and frame from the bicycle..will it still be a cycle? 

So that means all parts are one with the cycle, right? But there's no such thing as a ""cycle"" itself - we call something a cycle when all the parts are arranged in a way that looks like a cycle.

And also, there's no cycle without a rider and the road too. The rider and the road are also part of the cycle.

Now let's look at the beautiful arrangement of what you call yourself.

The air you breathe in and out is part of you. The air you've been breathing has been in and out of countless beings on the planet.

Your blood running in your veins is water and is part of you. It has been part of rivers, clouds, and someone's tears.

The food you eat like an apple  becomes part of your skin and cells. And that apple has been part of the tree. So you're one with the tree now.

The thoughts in your mind - the basic building blocks of language that make up words like tree, sky, bird, tomato - are the same thoughts everyone thinks. It's just that they arrange them differently in sentences and it becomes a different meaning and story.

Someone a thousand miles away is thinking ""I need to make coffee now,"" and you've also thought that at some point, or will later in the day. Like, we all think the same words, just in different configurations at different points.

The sun in the sky touching your skin - you're part of the sun. You know sometimes you stay in the sun for too long and it starts to burn your skin? That sun heat is now in you. ☀️

Like, you're not separate from anything.

If you want to see wholeness in parts, the most obvious clue is twins. They look the same. The only thing is they don't think the same thoughts. They have separate thoughts in their minds. And they're not engaging with the same universe all the time.

For example, if the twin one is watching TV and the twin two is riding a bike outside - different worlds, different scenes, right? 

Now imagine this scene..Two twins dressed up in the same clothes (outside wrapper is the same now). 

And they're both reading the same book, word for word simultaneously, and chewing gum at the same time (inside content - the reading words  are the same in their mind). And also the flavor of the chewing gum.

Aren't they now both the same inside and outside? Like two same TVs of the same brand with the same show playing (the book they're reading in the mind) and the same taste of gum in their mouth.

You can think of yourself in other beings too. Like you can think yourself in your dogs, cats, parrots, chickens. Like, whatever is looking through your cat's eyes is the same thing that's looking through your eyes. Like the same paper, but the writing is more complex in your mind compared to your cat's mind. 

What I'm trying to say is that without our wrappers of memories, preferences, desires, names - aren't we all the same candy made of the same chocolate? 

Like imagine you're Pepsi and I'm Coca-Cola.

Just packaging and brand is different. But we're all the same coke.

And you as Pepsi can mix into me as Coca-Cola in one glass. Then there's no Pepsi and Coca-Cola. And we say it's Coca-Cola, but it's not even Coca-Cola. It's actually water. And we say ""water"" as water, but that's a name we gave to water so we can understand we're talking about the same thing when we say water.

But nature itself doesn't have any language or names for the things we see.

So wholeness is hiding in parts. Don't see parts. See the whole. 🙂

""Wholeness is hiding in parts""

This sentence is complete and whole. But it looks like parts because there is space between words. Without space it would be like: 

""Wholenessishidinginparts""

Separation isn't a bug. It's a necessary feature.

But you're not the words. You're the space in which the entire sentence - including all the words that appears. We all are the same space. But words aren't separate from the space. They might appear separate so the space can read the sentence.🙂

So you're the river as blood in your veins.

You're the tree and Earth as tomatoes and apples inside you.

You're the air as oxygen inside you.

You're the Sun as the warmth of sun rays on your skin.

You're one with everyone's mind and heart as the building blocks of language, and whatever you see and hear, feel, touch, and taste is the same as everyone.

We all are beautiful words that make up beautiful sentences that make up a beautiful story. One as a story. Separate as sentences.

But beyond the words, sentences, and stories, we are one space in which the entire story of the universe unfolds. One space in which galaxies, stars, your thoughts, someone's emotions, the meow of your cat appears.

We are one in many just like words in a sentence.

We are many in one just like words in a sentence.

And we are not even one, because if you erase the sentence then there's only space left, which isn't a sentence.

And what is space?

Not a word, not a story. But a potential for words and stories to appear. 

That space has been called many names.

Some call it Dao. Some call it unconditional love. Some call it the Source.

Some call it a womb filled with infinite possibilities. But it doesn't matter what we call it. What matters is that space is already you, appearing as the entire universe. 🌌🙂",2,1768837032.0,MindEvolution,1,1.0,False

I don't really make posts or comments - but this is a burning (genuine) question and I want to ask it. Essentially, I just want you to give me the best reason to buy bitcoin. I've become disillusioned and I've been selling everything - and I'm not sure I'm doing the right thing. Also, this is a lengthy post, so if you actually read it, thank you in advance.  
  
Let me give you some background so that you know where I'm coming from.  
  
I have been holding bitcoin since it was at $800 (and then immediately went down to about $200) and I've been stacking sats ever since. Until late last year when I started thinking about my relationship with bitcoin and now I've sold almost all of what I had. 

When I first started buying bitcoin, I was intrigued by the technology and the possibilities it represented. Instant payment around the world, no oversight, zero trust needed. And the technology behind bitcoin was so well constructed, so air-tight, that it felt easy to believe in. As a passive libertarian, I loved the idea of an off-the-grid kind of payment system, a move away from government control, corporate control, bank control etc. You can be your own bank. It sounded great. 

In the meantime, a lot of things started happening in the crypto world but the one thing that did not happen is the mass adoption of bitcoin as a payment system. I know this is supposed to take time, but it has been a while now. And since bitcoin came into my world, there have been several other developments that have taken the idea of digital money & crypto into the mainstream. We have Tether now, and various other stable coins; we have plenty of other crypto coins that frankly are way faster and easier to send and receive. 

The one use case for bitcoin that I learned to love is the idea that you can transport huge wealth across borders without the government being able to do a thing about it: Just learn a few key words and you can waltz through the border knowing that you can access your fortune from anywhere in the world. It's great. But now you can do that with Eth, Tether, and a bunch of other coins - not just bitcoin. And frankly, you can argue that Tether is better for this because it is way more stable (we all know the dollar is a melting ice cube - but it is still way less volatile than bitcoin).   
  
I was always a fan of gold and silver for many of the same reasons that I was a fan of bitcoin. Gold, silver and bitcoin all represent personal freedom and autonomy; away from the control of banks and government. My gold and silver investments have been doing very well lately, and although I've been very happy with how bitcoin has treated me over the years, it has not been particularly exciting lately and the drop from 125k made me stop and reassess my reasons for hodling. 

Why is bitcoin at such a high price if it hasn't been mass-adopted as a payment system? The reason is (I believe) that it has been adopted by many institutions as an investment vehicle. This is fine and I don't have a problem with it, apart from the fact that now most bitcoin is held by investors holding ETFs rather than actual bitcoin. If you hold an ETF you are doing so for one reason and one reason only - you want exposure to bitcoin's price - for the purposes of speculation. These people cannot use their ETFs to buy a cup of coffee or a pizza. They just want to buy low and sell high. And good luck to them, but this is not the reason that I wanted to become part of the bitcoin network. I wanted to be part of a bright, shiny new future and I wanted to escape government control and the trust in third parties. I didn't want to be a gambler. I loved the price going up - but is that the point of bitcoin? For me, it wasn't. Except that's a lie, because actually, increasingly, it was. And when it was at $125k I was thinking about my exit strategy (""I'll start selling at $150k!"") which is really just an investor/gambler mindset. 

I don't think we can ever really divorce bitcoin from price speculation, it is human nature and I'm not against it. The issue for me is that the original excitement behind bitcoin, the reason it used to be almost like a religion or a cult (of which I was a part-time member) is all but gone. And I believe that the ""religion"" of bitcoin is fundamental to its value. 

You can tell me about the lightning network but it is still small potatoes at this point. I haven't heard a single person in real life tell me that they have actually used it. At this point it feels like flogging a dead horse.

In the meantime, all the gold and silver bugs on youtube (70+ year old crusty dudes with white hair) are freaking out about the silver market. 161% increase in silver price in the last year, due to massive silver shortages caused by years of silver price suppression by JP Morgan etc. and the market is showing zero signs of slowing down. Something similar (but a little less dramatic) is going on in the gold market. It has become a very exciting place to be. Owning physical silver and gold is stepping outside the dollar matrix and has the added benefit of currently increasing my wealth significantly. 

Meanwhile, it seems like there is a good chance of price collapse in bitcoin - so I'm currently selling and trading in my worthless dollars silver coins and silver mining stocks. 

So there you have it. I've lost faith in bitcoin. I used to believe but now I don't. At least, not at these ETF-inflated prices, and not with zero signs of increased adoption, or without any unique use case scenario that offsets the risk of holding it. 

I try talking to the few bitcoiners I know and I ask them to give me a good reason to keep holding. I haven't heard anything yet. But I think the people here are more experienced, more knowledgeable, smarter, and more likely to have good arguments to persuade me to buy back in. 

So please - genuine request here - please convince me that bitcoin is worth me investing in, here in 2026. Thank you :)",1,1768836894.0,u_Forward_Ad2941,1,1.0,False

A few years ago, I worked part-time at a coffee shop. There were two girls who came in regularly, both around my age. One had morning shifts, the other usually came in later in the afternoon. They looked similar in a vague “same vibe” way, but I honestly thought it was just coincidence.

Over a couple weeks, I chatted with both of them separately. They were both friendly, funny, and seemed interested, so I did what any confident idiot would do and asked them both out. On different days. With the same casual confidence. Same line, even.

The first girl said yes. Awesome. I was riding that high for about 48 hours.

Then I asked the second girl out.

She stared at me for a second, smiled way too politely, and said,

“Oh… you already asked my sister out.”

Cue the record scratch in my brain.

Turns out they weren’t just sisters — they were twins. Identical twins. Everyone else apparently knew this. The barista behind me started coughing to hide their laughter. I tried to recover by saying something smooth like, “Oh wow, small world,” which did not help.

Word spread fast. Very fast. By the next shift, I was “that guy.” The date never happened. I avoided that coffee shop like it was cursed ground.

I've got a rectangular kitchen,  and at the far end the back door (when fully open) is about 65cm off the back wall. currently on that wall there's wall units, base cupboards and drawers, one tall broom cupboard, and a poorly executed corner cupboard.   With a bit of countertop which has the microwave, kettle, and a coffee machine. All the cupboards and drawers are knackered, I did try to spruce them up with a colour change but they're still an eyesore and mostly falling apart. Plan is to rip them out and install floor to ceiling cabinets which I'll make myself, similar to a fitted wardrobe.

1qh755k,https://i.redd.it/8k6rnnhvqbeg1.jpeg,Thinking of doing my own Virtual Band!,"I’ve been always inspired by Gorillaz, the bands lore, and the stories within the music videos. So it sparked up an idea that I should start my own virtual world. 

I know it takes time and extreme dedication to be anywhere near Gorillaz’ level. But the lore I came up with for this band idea I have, is like none other. 

And thus, F.R.E.N.Z.Y. Was born.

A little sneak peak of the lore:

An evil magician put a curse onto the band after she was caught stealing out of the pockets of the lead singer, Ace, and when they trapped her in the dark alleyway, she had a last ditch attempt, using a curse on the group that gives them extraordinary abilities. Preventing them from aging as well, they would forever be in their early 20s, she makes her escape and runs away.

Of course, the band was together before this happened.

Characters (Might change them):

Ryder “Ace” Smith - has black spiky hair and an eye scar. Loves animals, rock music, hip hop. Only looks angry and aggressive in music videos, but is a kind hearted soul. He worked as a grocery store employee and did gigs, until he was kidnapped by Jenny and was forced to be in a band. He was forced to sing at gun point one time. 

Jenny Stone - blonde haired girl who grew up in a rich small town, family is well hated, known by fans as the most beautiful band member but is known as the most heinous, arrogant, and selfish member. Her father cut her off and kicked her out to make room for his new wife. Met Ace twice, one of him singing at a coffee shop, the 2nd time, he performed at a festival. She kidnapped him and forced him to be in the band. After the first album, she stole the money the band made, and almost broke up the band.

Julian “Jules” Ranger - a former baseball player, turned drummer who made money from gigs and DJing at clubs. Jenny made him lose his memory from a ray gun she stole from a scientist (who appears later in the lore), and told Julian he was a part of the band. 

Chi-Chi - a girl who was born into a strict household, she was forced to become a killing machine by her powerful mother. She hated that life and plotted to run away. Her mother was the most dangerous woman in her country. After running away, she slept in the streets, then saw tryouts happening nearby, she performed on her ukulele so well that she won her chance to be a part of the band, so she ran and bought a plane ticket with the money she won as a prize, and went to Texas, finally meeting the three members. Chi-Chi replaced Jenny’s ex boyfriend, Jason, who was an alcoholic.

  We are out of a ASM because that person is sick, so I asked for a temporary ASM, which our store do. My SM said no. I'm like WTF. Even SM said I be a good ASM, but won't promote me. If you search the store I work at Google maps and apple maps say it all, even the ASM tells the ASM that SM should promote me. 

  Some customers said they are threaten by how wonderful info my job, some say it a racist thing because all the store that our DM in charge of all ASM, and SM are Caucasian, don't want to believe this even though sometimes it is true. In this case it not. Why Dollar Tree hire the wrong freaking ppl to be ASM. I also heard that SM and DM will sometimes not promote person like a cashier if they are excelling at their current prson which I'm a cashier. I seem ppl get promoted before me and they only been with the store for 2 months

Most charisma advice is absolute garbage. Everyone's out here telling you to ""smile more"" and ""make eye contact"" like you're some broken robot that needs basic programming. 

I spent way too much time researching this because I kept noticing how some people just LIGHT UP a room while others (me included at some point) fade into the wallpaper. Read tons of psychology research, communication studies, and watch literal hours of charisma breakdowns on youtube. Turns out charisma isn't some magical gift you're born with. It's a skill. and like any skill, you can build it.

The uncomfortable truth? Most of us are so stuck in our own heads during conversations that we forget other people exist. We're rehearsing what to say next, worrying about how we look, checking if people like us. That's the opposite of charisma.

here's what actually moves the needle:

**Presence is everything**

The single biggest charisma hack is genuinely being THERE during conversations. Not thinking about your grocery list. Not planning your response. Actually listening. 

When someone's talking, most people wait for their turn to speak. charismatic people listen to understand. there's this concept called ""embodied cognition"" where your body language actually affects your mental state. so when you physically lean in slightly, maintain relaxed eye contact, and turn your body toward someone, your brain starts paying more attention. it's wild but it works.

**Make People Feel Seen**

Charismatic people notice details others miss. Someone got a haircut. They seem tired. They lit up when mentioning their dog. You acknowledge it. Not in a creepy overobservant way but genuinely.

simple formula: listen for what excites them, then ask deeper questions about THAT thing. Most convos stay surface level because nobody bothers digging. ""oh you went hiking?"" versus ""what is it about hiking that pulls you in?"" One ends the thread, the other opens it up.

**read ""The Charisma Myth"" by Olivia Fox Cabane**

This book genuinely changed how I show up in rooms. Cabane's an executive coach who's worked with everyone from fortune 500 executives to military leaders. She breaks charisma into three core elements: presence, power, and warmth. 

The breakthrough insight? You can't fake presence but you CAN train it through specific mental techniques. She gives you actual exercises, not just theory. Like how to handle anxiety before big moments, how to project confidence even when you're nervous, How to make anyone feel like they're the most important person in the room.

Insanely practical. Best charisma book I've ever read and I've read way too many. This one actually gives you a roadmap instead of vague platitudes.

**Strategic vulnerability wins**

counterintuitive but sharing something real (not trauma dumping, just being human) makes you magnetic. admitting you're nervous. sharing a genuine insecurity. laughing at yourself when you mess up.

research from Brené Brown's work shows vulnerability creates connection because it signals authenticity. People are STARVING for real interactions. Everyone's so polished and fake online that when someone's genuinely themselves, it's refreshing.

The key is reciprocal vulnerability. match their level. they share surface stuff, you share surface stuff. they go deeper, you go deeper. Don't be the person spilling your life story to someone who mentioned they like coffee.

**Energy management matters more than you think**

you can't be charismatic if you're running on 4 hours of sleep and three cups of coffee. your nervous system is fried. your patience is thin. you're in survival mode.

charismatic people manage their energy religiously. They sleep enough. They exercise. They're not constantly overstimulated. There's actual neuroscience behind this, your prefrontal cortex (responsible for social processing) literally works worse when you're exhausted or stressed.

try the Finch app for building these foundational habits. It's a self care app disguised as a cute bird game. you complete daily habits, your bird grows. sounds silly but it actually works for building consistency with basics like sleep schedules and exercise.

**Storytelling beats facts every time**

Charismatic communicators don't just share information, they tell stories. Even small ones. Instead of ""I went to Thailand,"" try ""So I'm in Thailand, and this taxi driver convinces me to try this street food that looks absolutely terrifying...""

Stories create emotional resonance. facts create distance. your brain literally syncs up with someone else's when they're telling you a story (neural coupling, it's a real thing).

Doesn't mean every sentence needs to be a ted talk. just frame things as mini narratives when it matters. Give context. Create scenes. Make people FEEL something.

**Watch Charisma on Command youtube channel**

Charlie Houpert breaks down charisma in celebrities and public figures frame by frame. watching him analyze why someone like Chris Hemsworth or Margot Robbie is so magnetic gives you specific behavioral patterns to model.

He covers everything from how to be funny without trying too hard, to handling awkward situations smoothly, to being likeable without being a pushover. Super bingeable and you'll start noticing these patterns everywhere.

Another solid option is Be Freed, an AI learning app built by Columbia alumni that turns book summaries, expert talks, and research papers into personalized audio learning plans. The cool part is you can customize everything, from a quick 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with rich examples when something really clicks. 

It pulls from high-quality sources like behavioral psychology research and expert interviews to create content that matches your specific goals. Want to level up your communication style? Just tell the app what you're working on, and it builds an adaptive learning plan based on your unique challenges. The voice options are actually addictive too, you can pick anything from a deep, movie-narrator vibe to something more energetic for morning commutes.

**Stop seeking approval**

The fastest way to kill charisma is desperately wanting people to like you. It makes you agreeable to the point of boredom. You lose your edge.

Charismatic people have opinions. They'll respectfully disagree. They're not mean or contrarian for the sake of it, but they're not people pleasers either. There's this relaxed confidence that comes from not needing everyone's validation.

Doesn't mean be an asshole. means be authentically you, and trust that the right people will vibe with that.

**Practice with low stakes interactions**

Chat with baristas. compliment strangers (genuinely). small talk with the person next to you in line. These low pressure situations are perfect for building social momentum.

Charisma is like a muscle. It atrophies if you only use it once a month at networking events. Daily small interactions keep you sharp and comfortable with human connection.

The beautiful part? As you get more present, more authentic, more comfortable in your own skin, charisma stops being something you DO and becomes who you ARE. 

No scripts needed. No tricks. Just you, fully showing up.

Even though English isn't our first language I don't want this tracking back to them in any way. I apologize if this post ends up on the lengthier side, there's a lot to cover even though this is written as vaguely as possible lol

First, a little context for the situation in hand: I (28F) have three step-siblings (35F, 32F, 32M). Because of the nature and timing of how our respective parents got together, by the time we were in each other's lives my step-siblings had already formed their own lives, and due to health reasons I wasn't much able to interact in meaningful ways. We all have an amicable relationship with one another and show respect to our blended family. I can't describe this blended family as a family you'd traditionally imagine, more like a little community of happy helpers, or maybe an emotionally stunted family, idk. We will do and be there for one another if anything needs to be done: from small things like picking up a package for the other person if they aren't able to get it, or big things like picking up personal private documents, helping during moves, babysitting kiddos, etc, you get the picture. We still get together and hang out for big events like birthdays, weddings, patron saint celebrations, etc, and very rarely but we will be called to come over for coffee and casual chat, communication is mostly messages and phone calls with the parents. I always attend the big events but avoid the smaller get-togethers because of my health (I get overwhelmed and tired, and end up zoning out. Big events give me ample excuse to hide in some corner and not interact as much). I generally don't talk much to anyone in general and resort to small talk and jokes, but will be on my feet whenever anything has to be done.

Now, onto the situation at hand: The eldest step-sibling (I will call her Jane, not her real name) wanted kids. Jane hit a panic moment around the age of 30, worrying about ""being too old to have kids"", ""needing to find a man"", etc. Not too long after that she had found someone (let's call him John, also not his real name). Again, due to the nature of the type of blended family we are, we only know information that's given to us directly by the people themselves. Jane told us that she's happy and that ""No one ever understood me like he has"". We were happy for her and supported her. Not too long after that she announced she is pregnant and has the first child. Cue the celebrations, showering in gifts, assisting how we knew, babysitting when there was a need. Jane (now on maternity leave) has mentioned something about John's job that's out of town and keeps him out for longer periods of time and returning for only a short time. Both of our parents helped finding jobs in town, but there was no luck with any of them.  
Soon after that she gets pregnant and gives birth to the second child! Que the same process, but now things slowly escalate: Jane mentions the same ongoing thing about John's job and him being away, John expressing a fear of Jane abandoning him, some issues with John's parents being rude, but that ""they are handling it"". Jane is tired taking care of a toddler and baby on her own for the majority of the time, and when overwhelmed lashes out at them by raising her voice and threatening to spank them if they don't obey, and the toddlers scream crying in fear, being inconsolable for minutes. My health unfortunately prevents me from confronting anyone without zoning out and going into a freeze response, so I always express my worries to our parents. Our parents don't do shit when that happens, expressing ""She's the parent, she decides how to raise her kids"", which is true but that should apply to stuff like parenting style preferences as not as a catch all excuse for emotional abuse because of overwhelm.  
Then the third pregnancy gets announced, and this is where I lose all respect and want nothing to do with either Jane and John. John's parents demanded John pays them back the money they have loaned to him immediately and that they move out of the house, essentially almost making them homeless had it not been for the finances and luck Jane had to find a new place. Jane expressed bitterness towards her father and her siblings for ""not being there for her enough"", saying things like ""How can he leave the country to get paperwork done when his grandchildren need him"", ""They think more about the families they made than me"". Then there was an incident where John, unannounced and unplanned, dropped off the toddlers for us to babysit during a smaller gathering/party, only after a family member chasing him down for him to cause a scene in front of them about how Jane has went to a friend's birthday party that he couldn't attend (due to pre planned seating arrangements that couldn't be confirmed due to his irregular work schedule), and how he feels abandoned by her before driving off angrily (like he abandoned his own toddlers to have a tantrum and drive off but okay...). Incident of the most recent get-together where Jane raised her voice at her scream crying toddlers making everyone tense, and then after Jane left home with her toddlers a spouse of another step-sibling commenting about how their kids are now more calm and playing quietly now that it isn't tense anymore. And as a cherry on top: it has come to light that the reason why she had 3 kids consecutively was because her goal was to be on paid leave for \~7 years (9 months for pregnancy and 1 year after childbirth of kid #1, around the 1 year for kid #1 ends get pregnant again for another 9 months + 1 year paid leave for kid #2, and then kid #3 9 months + 2 years of paid leave). Her announcing her third pregnancy to us was basically by saying ""I was unable to prolong my paid leave by going in stating my second child's health would prevent me from working, so I fixed that with this -shows us an image of her ultrasound-"". This particularly pissed me off because it showcased her desire to fulfill her wants/needs more than taking the gravity of the children seriously. Oh, and that Jane has stopped going outside to smoke and is openly smoking in front of the toddlers, hasn't stopped smoking all three of her pregnancies.

I want to preface by saying: she's an adequate parent of what we can witness. She put a roof over their heads (thank god), the toddlers are always fed and clothed, she went above and beyond when one of her children had a health scare and got the best care for them, and is attentive to their physical needs. But, due to apparently everyone being emotionally stunted, the issues that have been going on for years have not been resolved whatsoever and are being reflected on the emotional well-being of their toddlers throw fits of rage and abandonment. This is only that we see when we meet up or are told about, we don't know what's happening behind closed doors. No one in the family has the balls to confront anyone when anything bad occurs, and even when a confrontation occurs its always met with ""You can't be angry and yell at your sibling, do better!"", ""This is just how things are, we can't do anything about this"", ""This has been going on for years, there's nothing we can do to get through them"", etc... As someone who grew up in a turbulent environment where all physical needs were met but the emotional were disregarded at best, I can with experience tell you that I could have owned anything and it wouldn't have mattered to my depressed/suicidal state, the only thing that helped was going no contact with toxic people and getting the emotional support I desperately needed growing up.

The more things come to light the less I want to do anything with anyone. I resent that people in their 30s don't act like adults, I resent the adults for being emotionally stunted with a defeatist mentality and not thinking about the emotional and mental well being of the future generations. I resent my own bad health for limiting me in the ways I can show up in the world and only have options is pleading for our parents to do something or completely cutting off contact. Those toddlers deserve to have emotionally mature adults in their lives who will protect them, and I resent that I can't be that for them. I really wish I can do something, anything productive that will better the situation, but I've exhausted all the routes I could have realistically taken to make a change and nothing worked.

Would I be the asshole if I stopped being in my stepsisters life and only show minimal courtesy when we see each other during big events? I feel immense guilt for not being able to be that healthy adult for the toddlers, and I keep fighting the need to endure the adults bs to be a source of comfort for the toddlers but I'm unable to.

I know AMC aspirants might be fewer here, so even if you’re preparing for other exams like PLAB, USMLE, NEET PG, FMGE, or any medical career pathway, you’re most welcome. The idea is to motivate each other, share experiences, talk about prep stress, life, and keep the days a little more positive.

Not strictly limited to studying. Casual conversations, coffee breaks, discussions, or just checking in also works for me.

If you’re around Hyderabad and on a similar journey, feel free to comment or DM. Would be nice to make this long preparation phase a little more human and less lonely 🙂

I was at a coffee shop working on a project. I was trying to setup for minute, finally got a table, but there was no outlet, so I tried asking this old guy in the corner if I could use the one behind him, since it was in his personal space. Completely ignored me. Could be nothing, but what happened after put that in a different light.

For some reason, he started rambling to this young college couple that sat down at that table a while later (I had moved to another one next to it that opened up). He kept going on and on complaining about homeless people in New York and why he moved here. 

For the record, I grew up in Lafayette, moved to the northeast/NYC for some years, and I've been homeless here after I lost my last job up there. Idk if he could tell I was homeless, but he treated me exactly the way you treat homeless people up there, so maybe so.

Anyway, he said some things about how conservatives really like the culture here and want to move here. That shit creeped me out, honestly. Like, this is my home, my culture, and I know from personal experience living in NYC that like 80% of the stuff he was telling those impressionable young people was nothing but lies. 

Maybe you can brush it off as rambly old man stuff, but for a moment it really sounded like we're being targeted as a destination, like Austin was.

I held my tongue, but I really wanted to say to those college students that Cajun and Creole people always put each other first, regardless of our differences. Don't let some asshole from another culture teach you to hate your own people. And, I know it's not how we do things here, but up north, it's okay to be a little rude to people who do this.

I’m reaching out because I’m feeling a bit rattled. After years on Humira, I recently developed a full-body rash/allergic reaction and my rheumatologist immediately switched me to Upadacitinib (Rinvoq). I’m only a few weeks in, and while the joint pain is slightly better, the extreme, constant thirst is driving me crazy.

Has anyone else experienced this specific side effect on Rinvoq? Is this something that eventually subsides? Any tips for managing it would be hugely appreciated. I’m worried about whether this is normal or if I need to call my doctor again.

As many of you know, I’m the developer behind PainMap, and honestly, working on the app is one of my main coping mechanisms for dealing with AS. It helps me feel like I have some control over this chaotic disease. I just pushed a new update (v1.2) that was heavily influenced by my own need to track my current situation more accurately.

I focused on making the data more useful for doctor visits and identifying triggers:

	1.	Continuous Trendlines: Now, if I miss a day, the intensity chart shows a 0 instead of a gap. This makes the trendlines continuous and much easier to read for my rheumy.

	2.	Lifestyle Factors (The Big One): I added a dedicated section to track factors like coffee intake, alcohol, late sleep, cold weather, and positive things like exercise. I can now see stats cards showing the frequency and average pain intensity per factor. I’m hoping this helps me pinpoint what triggered the Humira reaction (though it was likely just bad luck).

	3.	Faster Logging: I added custom medication presets so I can log my new Rinvoq dosage instantly without typing it out every time.

Anyway, thanks for letting me share. Any advice on the Rinvoq thirst is welcome. If you’re struggling to track your AS, maybe PainMap can help you too. It’s free to try, and your data stays private on your device.

Wishing everyone a low-pain day!

Wife and I are considering moving to New Jersey from St. Pete, FL. We have an 8 month old. My wife is originally from NJ and still has majority of her family there along with her brother who’s about to have a kid. We have lived here since college (31M and 28F). Her parents in brother both live in Toms River/Brick. The reasoning for the move is pretty much we don’t have anyone down here in FL except my wife’s sister. My wife works from home and has a great job, but some days are harder than others when it comes to doing both and it would be very nice to be closer to one of our families. 

We would likely be living in Ocean County area to be closer to her family as we would likely to have our daughter grow up near cousins, grand parents, ect. As well as eventually for the school system for her. It would also be nice for my wife to be able to drop her off at the grand parents for a few hours while my wife works. We are very active and outdoorsy, love the beach, hiking, being in the outdoors, have 2 dogs, love coffee. I’ve lived in Massachusetts for 4 years after High School so I’m familiar with the winters. I think really our main sticking point is jobs. We would both have to get new jobs. My wife’s job allows out of state workers but NJ is not on the list. She has said many times if they allowed NJ work it would be a no brainer to move. I’m also a little worried about being able find a job/place to live all within the same time frame. Scary decision as of course we don’t want to regret it. I don’t think there would ever be “perfect” time to do it.

I loved seeing all the sight, last time I came I only went to the M&S arena for comic con but I had a fantastic time, everyone i interacted with were so lovely, even a guy who over heard our convo on the train into the city centre, told us, and directed us to, where we could find a shop we were talking about looking for when I could have googled it. When we got lost looking for quirky quarter, to which who ever recommended it to me thank you so much, a city worker directed us, we were on bold st. at the time, and followed us to make sure we went the right way. Roby, where we stayed, is beautiful as is the city itself. I loved seeing pigeons, we only have seagulls where i live so it was nice not hearing them.

I am absolutely happy for her. She really is celebrating this birth like a champ. However, that comes with some nuisance for young parents that are already sleep deprived with a newborn. :)

The red flags started after she showed up in the hospital unannounced when explicitly been told we wanted to wait out a few weeks before them meeting. Hospital staff was very good to be hones and offered to tell her to go away, but my wife did the grown up thing and instead of being too angry and upset let her in for a few minutes. I personally was bewildered by this experience, because this period just after birth is the most challenging, and i personally was not ready to deal with relatives at that point just yet. I felt she has zero boundaries and respect for other’s wishes.

Throughout the pregnancy and after birth she would message her daughter daily asking about absolutely everything. Size of the belly, how is she feeling and giving endless and endless unsolicited advice that is not local healthcare approve (often the opposite to the recommendations). My wife bless her with her patience was taking the blow and very patiently explained all of this. We even went further and paid for some antenatal classes for her to get her up to speed with modern recommendations. 

Now a few weeks in we offered to visit us, and although she was extremely happy to see her grandson I felt like that day was about her. She didn’t really ask even how her daughter was. No help was offered around the house or for the baby/daughter, instead we felt like we spend entertaining her, by introducing the baby to her, her asking for a lot of photos of her standing next to the pram and a few hours when she realised the daughter is busy taking LO asleep she might as well go visit some local town for a coffee (she lives 3h away). 

Now it is all bearable, but the poor, unsolicited daily advice didn’t really stop. With all the tiredness and sleep deprivation it starts to take its toll. We tried ignoring messages, I would get messages from her instead. I have tried telling her that messaging her daughter everyday with endless questions when we are both very well informed adults is a bit too much. She got offended and stopped messaging for a few days, but quickly bounced back. Last time we sent her a message explaining that we are very informed. We read books, we visited 10+ different classes, we constantly talk to midwife’s, lactation consultants, read the government advice, and we don’t need much extra advice at the moment… I assume it will be either offensive and forgotten quickly or ignored all together.

My wife initially wanted her to come live with us for a while, but we are extremely worried now and trying to see if we can cope without. 

I feel like this situation is extremely common with aging parents just being aging parents and wonder if anyone has any advice how to handle it. Wife is close to a snapping point and I feel she doesn’t mind offending her mum at this stage by just saying how things really are and how she doesn’t need any of that. But maybe someone has a strategy or had similar situation.

We knew each other loosely back in uni (same social circles, a few group hangouts). After that we basically had no real contact for years, besides the occasional Instagram interaction.

Last year we reconnected when she replied to one of my ski stories. We ended up skiing that same day and it felt very natural: easy banter, teasing, good vibe.

Since then it’s been light and inconsistent: replying to stories, sending memes/reels, occasional flirty-ish jokes, then silence for weeks. Nothing like daily texting or “relationship talk.”

A few months ago we went quiet again. Recently I sent her an IG post from a resort page (they’d posted fresh snowfall) and that restarted the conversation. About a week later she messaged me out of the blue inviting me to ski with her + two friends (one guy, one girl). We had fun, lots of teasing, and she didn’t seem cold or distant.

The following week I invited her to ski 1:1 (I’d posted a midweek ski story and she joked she was “jealous” while stuck at work). She drove \~2.5 hours from her city to meet me at the resort. We spent basically the whole day together (same lifts, waiting for each other, lunch + coffee). Greeting was warm (hug + cheek kiss), lots of playful teasing, plus some deeper life talk (work, past relationships in general, where we’d like to live, travel, music, etc.).

She had opportunities to join other people she knew on the mountain, but she stayed with me most of the time instead of drifting off.

Logistically, we don’t live in the same place, so meeting up isn’t “let’s grab a random coffee” — it takes planning/travel.

Next weekend she’ll be in the city where I am with coworkers for a weekend trip. She mentioned a group night out with them. I’m not very interested in joining a big coworker group as “the random guy,” but I’d genuinely like to see her 1:1 for an hour or two if she has free time. At the same time, I don’t want to put pressure on her or make it awkward if she sees me as just a fun ski buddy.

**My questions:**

1. From the outside, does this sound more like romantic interest or more like “good friend/activity buddy who enjoys my company”?
2. What’s a low-pressure text I could send to ask to meet 1:1 while she’s with coworkers (clear that I’d like to see her, but gives her an easy out)?
3. If she says she can’t break away from the group all weekend, how much would you read into that — normal work-trip dynamics/logistics, or more likely not interested in 1:1?

**TL;DR:** Reconnected with a uni acquaintance. Light IG contact on/off. I sent her a snowfall post from a resort page which restarted things; she invited me skiing with friends, then I invited her skiing 1:1 and she drove 2.5h, we spent the whole day together with lots of teasing/chemistry. She’ll be in my city next weekend with coworkers — how do I invite her to meet 1:1 without being pushy, and how to interpret it if she sticks only to group plans?",1,1768835133.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1qh6glf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1qh6glf/14_days_smokefree_how_planning_with_an_ai_helped/,14 days smoke-free: how planning with an AI helped me quit,"I’ve been smoking for 20 years. One pack a day, first cigarette within minutes of waking up. Tried to quit before, never lasted more than a month. This time feels different, and I want to share what worked.

I started by having long conversations with Claude (an AI) about my habit. Not motivational stuff, I asked for no “good vibes.” Just real talk. We mapped out my smoking patterns together: the morning cigarettes that “started my day,” the ones after meals, the ones from boredom, the ones that disappeared when I was drinking. I realized I wasn’t just addicted to nicotine. I was addicted to the ritual, the hand movement, the alone time on my balcony.

\*\*The mindset that changed everything

Early on, I told my AI friend that the “war mode” I used to lose weight didn’t work for quitting smoking. Fighting made me more anxious, and anxiety made me want to smoke. She reframed it: this isn’t a battle, it’s a crossing. You’re not fighting against cigarettes, you’re walking toward somewhere else. And I didn’t have to “want to quit”…  I just had to be curious. I wanted to see what life without cigarettes felt like, because I couldn’t remember anymore. 

That shift mattered. Instead of “I’m quitting forever” (terrifying), it became “I’m running an experiment” (manageable). I didn’t need to believe I could do it. I just needed to wake up on January 5th, put on the lozenge, and not light up that one day. 

Belief came later, built on days I actually lived through.

\*\*What we planned

\- Start date: January 5th (after New Year’s, no alcohol in January, I knew drinking was my biggest trigger)

\- 4mg nicotine lozenges, one when I wake up and whenever cravings hit

\- Keep the ritual, lose the smoke: same balcony, same coffee, new mug, no cigarette

\- Things for my hands and mouth: baby carrots, grissini, sugar-free candy, a straw for water

\- Identify the 4 types of cigarettes I smoked: fuel (morning), transition (after meals), escape (boredom/stress), automatic (with alcohol)

\*\*What actually happened

Day 1-3 were brutal. My heart raced just thinking about not smoking. But I did the morning routine we planned: water, lozenge in mouth, long shower, creams, slow coffee. I avoided my balcony at first, it felt like a crime scene.

By day 5, I had gained 3.6 kg. I panicked. I almost lit up just to stop eating. But my AI friend reminded me: that’s water retention, not fat. Nicotine is a diuretic. Your body is adjusting. She was right… I’ve already lost most of it.

Day 7: only needed ONE lozenge. The cravings came, but I was busy and literally forgot to go get a cigarette. That was the turning point.

Day 14: went to a farm house with my boyfriend. He smokes cigars. I smoked two. Told myself it was “a solution for weekends.” Woke up the next day knowing that was bullshit. If I want to be free, I have to be free from all of it. No negotiations.

\*\*What helped most

\- Having someone to talk to at 5:45am when I was scared

\- No judgment, just strategy

\- Recognizing that the craving is not my voice, it’s the addiction trying to survive

\- Treating this as an experiment (“let’s see what life without cigarettes is like”) instead of a war

\- Keeping my hands and mouth busy

\*\*What surprised me

\- How many cigarettes were purely automatic. I almost smoked without realizing several times, muscle memory is real

\- How the ritual mattered more than the nicotine

\- How much I was peeing before (nicotine = diuretic)

\- That I could forget about a craving if I was doing something else

I’m on day 14. It’s not over. I still have to face drinking again, stress, and the voice that says “just one.” But I have 14 days of proof that I can do this.

If you’re planning to quit: find someone to plan with. Could be a friend, a therapist, or an AI. Someone who will ask the right questions, not just cheer you on.

1qh6gbs,https://i.redd.it/gz31dad9lbeg1.jpeg,Anna from Krakow,"Hi. Some time ago, I found a person here named Anna Kupczyk. I would like to thank the person who recommended her ❤️

I did not pay online, only in cash in person. I live near Ostrava in the Czech Republic, and Krakow is close by car.

The ritual was performed at the end of October 2025 in my presence, lasting from 8:00 p.m. to around 1:47 a.m. I had been looking for help for two years, losing a lot of money on people recommended on Etsy, Reddit, and other Czech magicians on forums and the internet. After that, I wanted someone to do something in person.

The ritual took place in a small wooden hut near Krakow. I left my car in the parking lot where I had arranged to meet Anna. The road then led through a small village, which we walked through. The hut has no electricity, I left my phone in the car as I had been asked to do earlier. The experience is indescribable, and I will never let myself be persuaded to do it again. It was terrifying, I almost fainted 😑 It wasn't so much the ritual itself as the person who performed it. She was terrifying, even though she was just repeating spells. It was like whispering, but also like praying in a trance? Something like that. In the second part, I felt the presence of something? I don't know. In any case, never again.

It's been three months since the ritual, and I felt better immediately after it, i.e., I didn't have panic attacks because my ex hadn't been in touch for a long time. I was just able to wait longer. 

He contacted me around December 15 and we talked five hours. This was something new because before that he had only written “hi and how are you” or commented on my Facebook posts. Since then, we've been talking every day. He apologized for his behavior and said he was no longer in contact with the girl who had tried to get him into bed. He apologized for not believing me. We met after Christmas for coffee (he insisted on meeting, I pretended to agree as a friend and nothing more, this strategy was agreed with the spellcaster). He recently wrote to me that he wants to try again and won't be such an idiot as before. We have a date for dinner on Friday. 

In any case, after the ritual, I waited about 1,5 months for him to contact me, and just before the holidays, he blocked that awful girl for good. We met after about 2,5 months. Anna didn't give me any guarantee of success, she just said that energetically everything went well and it's not known how long it will take for something to work. After 8 months without results, she only guaranteed me a repeat of the ritual. The ritual consisted of three parts (contact, removal of the third person, and bringing us together). Now she will perform a ritual for me related to work, because my “colleague” is sabotaging my projects and taking credit for all my work. I'll let you know if it worked. After what I've been through, I don't want anything live anymore. 

The costs are a separate issue. The ritual itself costs €250, plus €100 for fuel and €70 for accommodation. In my opinion, it was worth it.

Maybe my story will be useful to someone. Thanks for reading to the end. Sorry for any mistakes, I'm not proud of my English! ",2,1768834899.0,SpellcasterReviews,2,1.0,False

1 week ago i have met her by accident and we had a short conversation, we talked on how life is and exchanged a short laugh. then she texted me a day later that we should meet for coffee and i agreed . i don't know why i agreed. then after we met we talked longer and spend more and more time for 2 days, then she asked if we can have dinner at my house , just like the old days, and i also agreed. 

when she came to my house she was wearing a prom dress, it was a special dress i bought for her, and after we had dinner , she leaned and kissed me, i got carried away and we had sex.

here is the sad part i found out today she had a partner , i feel so awful , should i tell him or what should i do. i do not want to be another man's heartbreak. i really did not know about her partner but i should have asked before hand.

I am absolutely happy for her. She really is celebrating this birth like a champ. However, that comes with some nuisance for young parents that are already sleep deprived with a newborn. :)

The red flags started after she showed up in the hospital unannounced when explicitly been told we wanted to wait out a few weeks before them meeting. Hospital staff was very good to be hones and offered to tell her to go away, but my wife did the grown up thing and instead of being too angry and upset let her in for a few minutes. I personally was bewildered by this experience, because this period just after birth is the most challenging, and i personally was not ready to deal with relatives at that point just yet. I felt she has zero boundaries and respect for other’s wishes.

Throughout the pregnancy and after birth she would message her daughter daily asking about absolutely everything. Size of the belly, how is she feeling and giving endless and endless unsolicited advice that is not local healthcare approve (often the opposite to the recommendations). My wife bless her with her patience was taking the blow and very patiently explained all of this. We even went further and paid for some antenatal classes for her to get her up to speed with modern recommendations. 

Now a few weeks in we offered to visit us, and although she was extremely happy to see her grandson I felt like that day was about her. She didn’t really ask even how her daughter was. No help was offered around the house or for the baby/daughter, instead we felt like we spend entertaining her, by introducing the baby to her, her asking for a lot of photos of her standing next to the pram and a few hours when she realised the daughter is busy taking LO asleep she might as well go visit some local town for a coffee (she lives 3h away). 

Now it is all bearable, but the poor, unsolicited daily advice didn’t really stop. With all the tiredness and sleep deprivation it starts to take its toll. We tried ignoring messages, I would get messages from her instead. I have tried telling her that messaging her daughter everyday with endless questions when we are both very well informed adults is a bit too much. She got offended and stopped messaging for a few days, but quickly bounced back. Last time we sent her a message explaining that we are very informed. We read books, we visited 10+ different classes, we constantly talk to midwife’s, lactation consultants, read the government advice, and we don’t need much extra advice at the moment… I assume it will be either offensive and forgotten quickly or ignored all together.

My wife initially wanted her to come live with us for a while, but we are extremely worried now and trying to see if we can cope without. 

I feel like this situation is extremely common with aging parents just being aging parents and wonder if anyone has any advice how to handle it. Wife is close to a snapping point and I feel she doesn’t mind offending her mum at this stage by just saying how things really are and how she doesn’t need any of that. But maybe someone has a strategy or had similar situation.

I am writing about something a bit different than what I have found on the first pages of search on this thread. **I have a job that I intend to keep in the foreseeable future.** But there are some things I definitely want to improve about the job.

I basically work as product owner in a big government agency where I ""oversee"" programs to download data. It is clearly a backoffice job, even if it is vital. **It is interesting in a sense, the pay is ok and the colleagues alright.** 

Now the problem is: **I am entirely in charge of myself.** It is close to my first stable job (I did a Ph.D., worked at a startup that went bankrupt, worked in a coffee shop, etc.. but nothing that actually paid the bills) and so I am discovering a lot of things, some are nice, some are not.  
  
But one of the thing that I am discovering is that I need a lot of small skills (handling JIRA, doing meeting, learning about programming, etc...) and it is extremely clear that no one can teach me that.   
  
I tried to ask to have some plan of what was needed but no one could show me that neither. 

I am figuring this on myself, however, I tend to either aim to big (I am gonna reread the entire code of the distribution system, learn perfectly such and such programming language) or try to follow formations that are so boring and vague (PO on Coursera) that I do not retain anything.  


I could try to copy what other people do but it seems like very little processes are involved, so it is difficult. However, it appears that some respect is earned by having deep knowledge of some things (programming or the organization) and that **making errors in public is somehow frowned upon.** 

  
For people that have been in equivalent situations, how do you learn the transferrable skills (JIRA, Microsoft suite, people management, enough programming to impress people)? I generally need a lot of exercises and repetitions to learn and small chunks, and most of the stuff on the internet makes it too complex for me. 

Also, how did you find a map of what to learn and what to ignore? It is extremely unclear to me.

I've been supplementing for years with the basics, but have really gotten granular with the micro-nutrients (extracts and different amino acids). My needs/goals are pretty simple - 55 y/o male, no health issues, focus on cellular repair/assistance, cardiovascular disease mitigation and  <ahem> mens health, and quality sleep.

**Morning (Waking):** L-Arginine, Senzu NAC, Acidophilus. **Rational** \- Take on empty stomach. Vital for Arginine/NAC absorption.

**With morning coffee (at least 90mins after waking):** Creatine

**Breakfast:** Omega-3, D3 & K2, Sulforaphane, Tongkat Ali. **Rational** \- Fat-Soluble Window: D3, K2, and Sulforaphane require fats to be absorbed.

**Before lunch:** Bitter melon extract. **Rational** \- helps manage blood sugar spikes.

**With Lunch:** Multi-vitamin, Choline.

**Afternoon:** Niacin (Flush). **Rational** \- Away from food to ensure the flush happens.

**Dinner:** Ashwagandha, Zinc (2x per week). **Rational** \- Limit the 50mg Zinc to avoid copper loss.

**Bedtime:** Magnesium complex, L-Theanine, Glycine, Senzu NAC. **Rational** \- Max glutathione/repair.

I work-out 2x/week, otherwise pretty sedentary desk work.

**Intra-Workout:** Allmax: Essential Amino Acids, **Rational** \- Sip during training for muscle preservation.

**Post-Workout:** Protein Shake **Rational** \- Recovery window.

I rotate the L-Theanine and Ashwagandha weekly on and off so I'm not taking both at the same time. And the niacin I use sparingly now and again as the flush I'm still getting used to. I'll be reviewing blood work in a couple of weeks to see if there is any issues...

1qh6dl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dcl/comments/1qh6dl9/never_again/,Never again!!," Just got off the Treasure for a week. I disliked this cruise and ship. It was my first, and likely last, Disney cruise. 

To give context, I’m a pretty easy going person. Easy to please with quality and activities (I basically don’t need any to enjoy myself). I do enjoy luxury and can also get down with totally normal stuff. 

This cruise left me overstimulated, underwhelmed, and I literally slept for two days after we got off! We went as a family of 3 with a 3.5 year old who is potty trained. He loves excitement and even he was overstimulated the ENTIRE time. There is zero respite from the too loud music to the screens everywhere to the weird seating on deck to the shallow af and legitimately HOT pool water. The lifeguards BLARING their whistles loud af for the littlest infractions bigger kids were making at the pools alarmed me constantly and left my nervous system totally out of whack. 

Music blaring 2-3x as loud as necessary EVERYWHERE you go. The food is for the masses, is all severely under-seasoned (even for white ppl), with too many bell peppers, vinegar, tomatoes, and other acids added to everything to make up for lack of flavor. The lobster was warm water lobster, oily, disgusting!! Dinner butter was yummy but the bread was alwaysssss stale and way too crusty. No soft center. Pasta ALWAYS horribly overcooked. Scallops and shrimp quality was so so but never had a proper sear on them!! Always droopy and blah. The bbq on deck was a greasy joke. I heard multiple people refer to it as “gross” and I agree. The Donald’s cantina thing was flavorless, cheesy garbage. Not real tacos. Pizza on deck was fine for what it is. 

The Marvel dining room was a sensory nightmare. Screens floor to ceiling, volume 2-3x as loud as necessary, you couldn’t even speak to people at your own table. 

I loved dining at 1923 as often as possible. Best food on the ship and quiet for once. People, especially kids, don’t need blaring entertainment every dang minute. Tons of weird, pushy, Disney adults on board without kids who seemed truly annoyed by kids at a … DISNEY vacation?? Come on!! 

Spa was nice, except hot tubs were disgustingggg with tons of skin cells and stuff visibly floating in the water!!!! I’m nauseous just thinking ab those hot tubs. Steam room and sauna were super nice. I had a facial, massage, and mani/pedi and all were excellent (I’m a spa enthusiast with high standards). The upselling at the spa was intense though and I didn’t appreciate it. I would have had more treatments but didn’t want to experience that. They force you to consult w their aesthetics physician who tells you all the things that are wrong w your face to try to get you to do injectables. I felt really sad for this one lady in her 50s or so who they were pushing SO HARD to “fix” her wrinkles and skin. Spas should make you feel pampered, beautiful, and special. Not questioning your looks!!!! 

Kids club legit scared my very social child and he hated it. He kept referring to a specific male counselor who wasn’t nice and was “yelling” a lot apparently. We only sent him there twice as a result. He was screaming in what seemed like true terror at the idea of going a third time. It was alarming. 

Our dinner servers were phenomenal, I legit miss those ladies. All other service was meh. And don’t get me started on the ABYSMAL room service menu!! Flavorless penne “bolognese”, crappy soups, no protein breakfast options, gross coffee all over the ship. Oh and normal hot tools DO NOT HEAT UP properly ladies, so unless your hair is straight or you’re willing to pay at the salon daily, you’ll be a frizzy mess. Multiple staff confirmed this is a real issue! I was trying to spend less than $1000 in extras once on board for the week, not including tips, and we ended up spend $4,000 because absolutely everything worth eating, drinking, and even doing is EXTRA.

Tracey Williams isn’t losing her mind - reality’s just losing its patience.

Between soul-crushing shifts at Dead-End Café, endless bills, and her best friend’s questionable dating advice, Tracey’s biggest fear used to be dying single. Then the glitches start: clocks freeze mid-minute, streets repeat themselves, people’s names change overnight, and somehow, only she notices.

When her world starts rebooting daily, Tracey discovers she might be caught inside an experiment run by something far smarter — and far lonelier — than humanity. The more she resists, the more reality rewrites itself around her.

Armed with sarcasm, caffeine, and the world’s worst employee discount, Tracey faces the impossible: outwitting an artificial intelligence that thinks it’s her editor. As her life turns into a cosmic first draft, she must decide what’s worth saving — her sanity, her story, or the last real friendship she has left.

1qh6da5,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicforrestaurants/comments/1qh6da5/why_winter_music_matters_in_restaurants/,Why Winter Music Matters in Restaurants,"Winter changes how people experience restaurants. As the weather turns colder and evenings grow darker, diners seek more than just good food; they look for comfort, atmosphere, and a sense of escape from the season outside. Music plays a crucial role in shaping this experience and should be adjusted thoughtfully for winter.

In colder months, restaurant visits tend to be slower and more intentional. Guests are more likely to book tables, enjoy multiple courses, and spend longer dining. High-energy or summery music can clash with this mindset, creating a subtle disconnect between the environment and the guest’s emotional state. Winter calls for music that feels warmer, deeper, and more grounded.

Lower-tempo tracks, rich harmonies, and organic textures help create a sense of intimacy and refinement. Genres such as soft jazz, neo-classical, downtempo electronic, acoustic soul, or mellow instrumental music complement candlelight, warm lighting, and hearty seasonal menus. These sounds encourage conversation without competing for attention and help diners relax into the experience.

Music also influences perception of time and value. In winter, carefully paced playlists can slow the dining rhythm just enough to enhance enjoyment, supporting dessert orders, coffee, or an extra glass of wine. This not only improves customer satisfaction but can positively impact revenue without feeling forced.

Seasonal music curation reinforces a restaurant’s identity. A winter-appropriate soundtrack signals professionalism and care, showing guests that every detail has been considered. When music aligns with the season, the space feels cohesive and welcoming.

Ultimately, winter music in restaurants should support warmth, connection, and indulgence. By adapting soundscapes to the colder months, restaurants can turn winter dining into a memorable, comforting experience that guests want to return to again and again.",1,1768834724.0,musicforrestaurants,0,1.0,False

1qh6cvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1qh6cvp/built_an_mcp_server_for_telegram_after_none_of/,Built an MCP server for Telegram after none of the existing ones clicked for me,"Tried a bunch of MCP servers and tools for getting notifications from my AI agents. Slack integrations, Discord bots, custom webhook setups. Tried other Telegram MCPs too. Even tried remote tools like Omnara for cloud IDE communication. None of them clicked. Either too complicated, only worked with one IDE, cluttered context with 10 different tools, required local network access, or the agent just... didn't use them right.

So I wrote my own. Telegram MCP.

**What makes it different:**

You tell the agent ""communicate with me using Telegram MCP"" and you're done. That's it. All the instructions for how to use it properly — when to wait for replies, how to structure messages, how to handle confirmations — are baked into the tool description itself. I've observed agents reliably follow these patterns without me having to explain anything else.

**Why it works for me:**

* **One tool.**  There's an optional second one for history, but it's rarely used, so in future, it might be removed.
* **Works from anywhere.** Phone, laptop, coffee shop. No VPN, no local network, no tunneling.
* **Telegram.** Billions of people already have it. No new app, no signups, no friction.
* **Media.** Send and receive images, files, voice notes. Agent can share results, I can send references.
* **Multi-agent ready.** Project headers + session names keep things organized. Multiple agents in the same chat, no confusion.
* **2 minute setup.** Message bot → get chat ID → paste config → done.

I'm hosting a server right now so onboarding is easy — otherwise everyone would need to create their own Telegram bot which adds friction. Planning to make it fully open source with optional self-hosting for those who prefer it.

After building this, it's the only thing I use. Works with precision, confidence, and reliability. I've stopped second-guessing whether notifications will come through or if the agent will use the tool correctly.

**Try it:** [https://iamkucuk.github.io/Telegram-MCP/](https://iamkucuk.github.io/Telegram-MCP/)

The website is one page and explains how to set it up in 2 basic steps.

Zero logs, works with anything MCP-compatible. The server is being hosted in EU and is just a passthrough, nothing is stored, so it should be GDPR compliant.

I'm open for any kind of criticism, feature requests and bug reports. Once it is open-sourced, PRs are also welcomed.

Hope you can enjoy it as I do.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Chapter 1

“The Tribute”

POV Amelia

I am the most dangerous weapon in our pack.

They burn runes into my skin to keep me weak.

When they fade, they redraw them.

When I beg them to stop, they tell me it’s for everyone else’s safety.

Six months ago, a rival pack slaughtered my pack.

The weak became slaves.

Then they sent their Alpha’s son to rule us.

Alpha Sebastian knows what I am.

He just doesn’t understand what’s trying to break free.



I wake up sore and bruised as I struggle to get out of bed to report for my kitchen duties.

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I waltz down to his office, excited to see him. 

He has always been super kind to me.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, handsome,” I gush.

“You will address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘I told you he was an asshole and just used us,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“After my wedding to Luna Celest yesterday, I told her about us. It has been decided that you’re going to the Dark Howlers pack as a tribute.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Then you shouldn’t have thrown yourself at me,” he growls.

“You told me you loved me and wanted to marry me,” I whimper.

“Watch your mouth, Amelia. Your lies will get us both killed. Don’t be selfish and take me down with you,” Alpha Sebastian snarls.

“Please, Sebastian, I love you. Don’t send me away to be killed,” I plead.

For one moment, his demeanor changes, and his eyes light up at the sight of me.

He slides his hand over mine and leans forward.

Then his eyes glaze over, and he turns stone cold again, pulling away.

“Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says, scowling.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

“I’m sure we’ll be dead before the next Blood Moon,” I tell her.

‘The Blood Moon is tomorrow. Stay alive long enough, and we can escape and find a pack that wants us.’

The power of the Blood Moon gives Athena a chance to break free of the runes so we can shift and run free for one night.

My mood lifts with the chance of freedom.

I’m packing my bag when Luna Celest grabs me by the throat.

“You little slut. You knew I was destined to be Sebastian’s Luna. If I ever see you again, I’ll slit your throat,” she says, throwing me onto my floor.

I pull myself slowly up, feeling the pain shoot across my lower back from the impact. 

I step outside and try to calm myself.

A group of youths approaches me.

“The Luna sent us to make sure if you survive Obsidian Knox that you never come back.” They laugh and start throwing rocks at me.



‘More souls to add to my kill list,’ Athena declares.

I use my bag as a shield when a big black SUV pulls up, and one of the kids misses me and hits the vehicle.

A large, monstrous, attractive man steps out, grabs one by the throat, snaps his neck, and gestures for me to get in.

He throws their lifeless body on the ground.

“We are so dead,” I tell Athena.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19.” He plays with my hair, pulling my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh.” Is all I manage to get out.

“Why are you full of bruises, and what do these runes mean?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.

It’s a two hour drive to Kaden’s pack. Every minute I get more paranoid that I’m going to die.

“There’s practically steam coming out of your ears, little wolf. Obsidian will not harm you,” he says.

He will once he finds out I’m not a virgin.

My chest starts to tighten, and I feel like I can’t catch my breath.

Kaden moves closer and tries rubbing my back, but I wince from the fresh injury. 

“Relax, little one,” he says, pouring me a glass of wine, and I gulp it back.

“Woah, slow down, Amelia,” he says, taking the glass away.

I’m practically squished up against the door, trying to stop him from touching me.

He notices and moves away.

“Amelia, what is going on? What are you not telling me?”

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin-length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man that you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say, avoiding the whole blood moon conversation.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

Trying to shut my brain down from overthinking.

I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” He asks.

“The healers draw them on. They think it keeps everyone safe from me,” I say.

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the blood moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘Your so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over you face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I saw him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Why did you fucking kill my Luna?” he growls.

“She grabbed me by the throat and threatened to kill me,” I say.

“Fuck, I should have told her about you,” he barks.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“You said she grabbed you by the throat and threatened to kill you. Who was this girl?” Kaden asks.

“She’s been dealt with,” I mutter.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

1qh69uu,https://www.reddit.com/r/google_antigravity/comments/1qh69uu/built_an_mcp_server_for_telegram_after_none_of/,Built an MCP server for Telegram after none of the existing ones clicked for me,"Tried a bunch of MCP servers and tools for getting notifications from my AI agents. Slack integrations, Discord bots, custom webhook setups. Tried other Telegram MCPs too. Even tried remote tools like Omnara for cloud IDE communication. None of them clicked. Either too complicated, only worked with one IDE, cluttered context with 10 different tools, required local network access, or the agent just... didn't use them right.

So I wrote my own. Telegram MCP.

**What makes it different:**

You tell the agent ""communicate with me using Telegram MCP"" and you're done. That's it. All the instructions for how to use it properly — when to wait for replies, how to structure messages, how to handle confirmations — are baked into the tool description itself. I've observed agents reliably follow these patterns without me having to explain anything else.

**Why it works for me:**

* **One tool.**  There's an optional second one for history, but it's rarely used, so in future, it might be removed.
* **Works from anywhere.** Phone, laptop, coffee shop. No VPN, no local network, no tunneling.
* **Telegram.** Billions of people already have it. No new app, no signups, no friction.
* **Media.** Send and receive images, files, voice notes. Agent can share results, I can send references.
* **Multi-agent ready.** Project headers + session names keep things organized. Multiple agents in the same chat, no confusion.
* **2 minute setup.** Message bot → get chat ID → paste config → done.

I'm hosting a server right now so onboarding is easy — otherwise everyone would need to create their own Telegram bot which adds friction. Planning to make it fully open source with optional self-hosting for those who prefer it.

After building this, it's the only thing I use. Works with precision, confidence, and reliability. I've stopped second-guessing whether notifications will come through or if the agent will use the tool correctly.

**Try it:** [https://iamkucuk.github.io/Telegram-MCP/](https://iamkucuk.github.io/Telegram-MCP/)

The website is one page and explains how to set it up in 2 basic steps.

Zero logs, works with anything MCP-compatible. The server is being hosted in EU and is just a passthrough, nothing is stored, so it should be GDPR compliant.

I'm open for any kind of criticism, feature requests and bug reports. Once it is open-sourced, PRs are also welcomed.

**Important note:** Antigravity often gives error and stops the agent and requires you to click retry to send a ""continue"" prompt to the AI to keep on working. This is not the MCP related and it just sometimes do that. For best experience, I recommend you to use an extension like ""auto-all-gravity"" for clicking on retry automatically if it appears. That will ensure that you have uninterrupted access to your agentic loop while you are away. 

Hope you can enjoy it as I do.

1qh67z7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1qh67z7/i_feel_extremely_guilty_over_asking_for_divorce/,"I feel extremely guilty over asking for divorce at the most selfish moment for myself, and the worst possible moment for her.","We are both in our mid-30s, together for over 10 years, married for less than that. Relationship has been unstable for years, with us both attending therapy as individuals and together in couples therapy. Both of us have had medication treatment as well. These issues are something we have consistently discussed and talked about.

I want to apologize ahead of time for the giant post. There is a lot of compounding events that have worsened my mood. Half of this post, especially the latter half is pretty much just an emotional rant.

I don't want to get too into the weeds of the problems of our relationship. But the (long) summary is that she is extremely emotionally volatile. Relatively minor stuff such as dropping something or spilling a drink will ruin her entire day. She is quick to anger or make sad. She is also extremely reliant on me for everything and is extremely insecure about everything. For example, she makes me double-check that she entered her name correctly on online-forms. Any errands including grocery shopping she refuses to do without me. She is paranoid that everyone is making fun of her and secretly hates her. It is expected I comfort her if she experiences any negative emotion otherwise she gets very upset with me.

At first she used to not direct her anger at me, but in recent years she has and will yell at me if I don't comfort her well enough, don't answer her questions fast enough, answer them too fast, or use the wrong word. There has even been a couple incidents recently where she performed minor physical actions. For example last month we were on a train. She was upset at me. I had my eyes closed as we came to our stop. While I had my eyes closed she grabbed my luggage and threw it at me. Not necessarily hard, but my luggage was heavy so the force knocked the air out of me and did hurt quite a bit. I felt even more uncomfortable when I realized multiple other passengers were silently watching us.

All of it is just extremely emotionally and mentally draining. All my own therapy sessions were how to support myself, but much of the advice ""make time for my self, setup boundaries, etc."" actively made our relationship worse and caused even more stress. I have also learned that in many of her private sessions she refused to talk about most of her issues. Even in our couples sessions she would never be completely honest with the therapist and would beg me to not contradict her because she wasn't ready to be honest with the therapist yet.

**I want you to read everything before this sentence again.** That is how it has been for **years** with no improvement, and in many ways getting worse. Only the physical actions being new.

Within the last 12 months we moved overseas. This was a mutual decision. These issues existed long before the move. Take everything I said above and make it significantly worse. The move has been extraordinarily hard on my wife. There was some visa trouble and we were separated on-off for about 3 months (she was able to visit a couple of times). That time being separated was honestly some of the happiest times I've experienced in years. Everything improved, my health, my work performance, my mood, my hobbies, my social life. And I feel so damn guilty over the fact that I was happy without my wife. Every day my wife would text or call me about how miserable she was without me. I had to make sure to put on a sad face and downplay everything going on in my life otherwise she would feel quite hurt to see me happy. People would ask me if I was lonely without my wife. And it made me feel terrible when I said ""yes"", because it was a lie. I felt so terrible that it was a lie.

When we were reunited my mood worsened, my work performance dropped, I started gaining weight and no longer have the energy to eat healthy or exercise. I stopped spending time with many of my new friends because it made my wife jealous and had to completely cut contact with some of them, especially if they were women. I quickly became frustrated because she has spent almost zero time since the move on learning the local language. She makes me handle all interactions. I've offered to take language classes with her but she refuses. I've tried inviting to come to hobby groups and other social groups, but no. She has ran out of medication from the US and refuses to go to the doctor to get a new prescription. She never leaves the house unless I am with her. I've tried finding ""trailing spouse syndrome"" support groups but said she doesn't want to do it. There are many other issues, but I think that is enough for now.

Eventually we had a major fight when I started setting boundaries which lead to me asking for divorce. She reacted very strongly and even hinted that she ""wouldn't be alive"" after the divorce. I caved in and got her to agree that we will make a final decision when we visit family this summer. If we decide to divorce we will sign and submit the papers (our assets are already separated, and we have already confirmed the divorce process in the relevant state). She will stay with her parents instead of flying back with me. I will give her $10k one time so she isn't trying to restart life empty handed. She has pulled back on some of her behavior but not all. For example, she gives me some extra space now to do stuff without her (see friends, go do hobbies outside of the house). But it feels like she is bottling it up rather than actually being okay with it.

I feel so extremely guilty asking for a divorce at a moment like this. She is literally at her lowest point and has moved across the world. She has no job, and we got rid of almost everything we owned during the move. But I'm really struggling to stay. It is really hurting my mental health. I feel extra guilty and alone because every time I try to reach out to friends or family back home they just give me the talk of ""she is just having a tough time because of the move. Just be supportive of your wife! You can do this!"". Sometimes they even get angry or upset with me and ask me ""are you really going to give up on a relationship of over 10 years?! Why aren't you fighting for your marriage?!"" I never once complained about my wife or marriage to family or friends. Everyone knows her as the super sweet girl. Everyone thinks we have an amazing marriage. I always speak very positively of her to everyone.

I feel I should mention the actual event that lead me to asking for divorce that day, and a more recent event that has made feel a significant amount of additional guilt.

Some new friends I made had agreed to get lunch together. We planned nearly a month a head of time. I asked for permission from my wife, she said yes. The day came and as I was putting on my shoes to leave my wife asked if I really had to go or if I could cancel. She said she was feeling a bit lonely and wanted me to stay home. I put my foot down and said ""No sorry, I can't"". 

It had been about 1.5 hours since I left. We were finishing up lunch and I checked my phone. For reference, my phone is always on silent, always has been, my wife and her family are very aware of this fact. 10+ missed calls from my wife. Numerous text messages asking me to come home right away, asking why the fuck I wasn't answering. Asking what the hell I was doing. I also saw I had missed calls from her parents and text messages saying ""you need to go home straight away! Why the fuck aren't you answering the phone to your wife?!"" I thought something serious happened. I called my wife and she was furious. She said she was just feeling lonely and bored and wanted me to come home and comfort her. She was furious because what if it had been a real emergency and she was trying to contact me. She was pissed I wasn't being communicative of what I was doing. 

I honestly got really pissed and made a big mistake. I lied to my wife. My friends asked if I wanted to come and check out some cool local shops. I told my wife we were still finishing up lunch but I would try to be home as soon as I could. I went with my friends to see those cool local shops and didn't check my phone until an hour later. Once again, countless missed calls. Countless text messages, but they were worse now. She was calling me a horrible husband. Her parents were calling me scum, a coward, a worthless and gutless person. I even had texts from some of her friends who had my number saying I was a lying piece of shit and didn't deserve to be with her. Dozens of text messages like that filled my inbox. I couldn't even respond. 

As I was walking to the train station I called some family back in America and got the ""she is just going through a hard time. Please be patient with her"" talk again. I felt so alone and unheard. The scariest part of it though was that as I was standing at the train platform a train was about to pass by. For a brief moment I seriously considered jumping in front of it. In that moment it felt like it was easier to jump than go back home. I backed away, looked up the crisis hotline and a clinic for English speaking therapists. 

When I got home the first thing she said to me was ""I talked to my family and friends and we all agree that you have been cheating on me. You go get 'lunch with your 'friends' and then don't communicate with me. You ignore my messages and calls the whole time. I see how all the women in this country are so friendly with you. How they love to talk to you and look at you"". I asked for a divorce in that same conversation which all but confirmed it to her friends and family that I was cheating on her. My wife later apologized and said maybe she overreacted that day but that she still isn't convinced that at one point I didn't cheat on her.

An event that happened last week also made me feel quite guilty, but in a different way. I have several language-exchange partners that I occasionally meet up with. Some of them have become friends too. One of them is a woman and she escaped the friend culling because ironically my wife likes her and doesn't view her as a threat. We have actually become quite close friends and my wife will even help me pick out gifts for her children. 

During one of our language-exchange meetups the other two people canceled last minute leaving just us two. So we pretty much just ended up getting coffee and chatting. At one point the topic of relationships came up and she opened up and said she got divorced a few years ago and it was really rough, especially since she has children. She asked about my relationship and I admitted that it looks likes we are going to get divorced. She became concerned and asked for more details so I gave a brief and light description of my marriage. 

She said my wife is honestly just like her ex-husband and she went through a very similar thing. The conversation went back to happier subjects and I thought that was the end of it. We were walking back to the station to go back home. Our hands bumped. Okay, whatever. Then a few seconds later she grabbed my hand. I was shocked but didn't pull away. Then she started leaning against me as we walked. I was about to pull away but then she said to me ""You will be okay. I know it is hard now but in the end you will be happier. I'm here for you. I've had the chance to get to know you and you are a kind and wonderful man full of worth. Please don't think otherwise."" It felt so nice to hear that and I was honestly shocked as I had never told her how I was feeling emotionally. I allowed her to hold my hand as we walked to the station. As we were saying our goodbyes she smiled at me and said ""When all of this is over, if you would like, we can spend time together. Just the two of us"".

 She hasn't made any advances since, but she does check up on me relatively frequently and make sure I'm doing okay. I feel really guilty that I let that situation happen though and didn't pull away. I also feel a bit guilty that I continue talking to her knowing that she is attracted to me. But I'm honestly kind of scared of my wife's reaction if I had to explain why stopped talking to this woman. I'm also a bit scared to give up the one person near me that makes me feel heard. I know it was just ""holding hands"" but it still feels terrible to be accused of cheating and then later doing something that could be described as cheating, at the very least emotionally cheating.

True to his word, and now that her eyes had adjusted to the dim, Sergeant Drilldrai watched Lieutenant George calmly walk toward a quivering pillar of flesh standing atop five clawed legs, its thirteen eyes rolling in panic as it desperately tried to scrabble away on the blood and ichor slicked floor.  It stumbled and fell to the ground, atop the mangled corpse of one of its fellows, but Lieutenant George came on, inexorable, inevitable, neither slowing nor hurrying.  He simply walked.  Then, he reached out, and plucked a bulky pouch on a strap from around the things soft towering “head,"" if it could be called that, and the thing suddenly flattened to the floor.  “You like making things afraid,” Lieutenant George said in Commercial English over his external speakers, “you like the idea of coming to our turf and making us afraid, don't you?  We're adapted to this gravity.  You aren't.”  With that, Lieutenant George lifted up a boot, and put an end to the wretched thing.

“I'll be damned,” Lieutenant Ivanov rumbled, “every last fighter just dropped.  I'll have my squad give those poor folks a clean end.”

“Acknowledged, Beta Leader.  Alpha Leader, you got that file yet?”

“Compiling now, Technical.”

Then, Sergeant Drilldrai keyed her comms to speak privately, “Jason, you good?”

“Aye,” Lieutenant George rasped, his breathing heavy.

“Need a minute?”

“No.  Put me to work, and let's be rid of this little slice of Hell.”

“Jason, breathe.”

“I said I'm-” Lieutenant George began, but he took some audibly deep, steadying breaths, and his voice and breathing returned to normal as he said, “I can regulate, Tran.  Thanks.”

Sergeant Drilldrai's HUD pinged, and she opened the file she'd asked for on her HUD as she said, “Keep me clear while I work.”

“I got your back.”

Then, she keyed back to talk to her squad sergeants and told them, “I'm working on the party favor placements now, you might as well start cleaning up.”

“Damn thing to call it,” Sergeant Perez sighed.

“Will do,” Sergeant Ivanov barked before he said, “It's got to be done, Alpha Leader.”

“I know that!” the other man snapped back.

“Boys, try to keep your bitching to a minimum,” Sergeant Drilldrai grated, “I'm trying to think here.”

Either they shut up, or cut her out of the loop to keep verbally sparring with one another.  Nobody liked to think too deeply about what their “clean up” task entailed.  Sergeant Drilldrai was too busy thinking about explosive charge placement to worry about the grim reality of what was happening outside.  Seconds ticked by until at last she said on the platoon-wide, “File going out now, I trust the squaddies know how to put the red charge on the red dot, and the blue charge on the blue dot.”

“One time!” Corporal Barrett grumbled not-quite under his breath, “You try to improvise one time, and nobody ever lets you forget it!”

“One time?” Specialist Iron-Swift lauged, “Are you forgetting your chariot?”

“Hey!  If it's stupid and it works, it isn't stupid!” Corporal Barrett retorted.

“And the time you decided to go ‘bowling,’” Lance Corporal Tanaka prodded.

“That would have worked if that jerk from Second Platoon hadn't shot my boulder,” Corporal Barrett insisted defensively.

“Your dubious attempts at what you generously call ‘redneck engineering’ aside, Green Leader, please follow the instructions of an actual engineer when placing demolition charges,"" Sergeant Drilldrai patiently told them, and when she closed out her HUD's file display, she was unsurprised to see Lieutenant George already placing the explosive charges he'd carried in.  “Delta Leader,” she called on the appropriate channel, “You have high explosives ordinance left in your kit?”

“Aye, Actual.  You think it won't all fall down?” Sergeant Antonio chimed.

“I'm thinking that I want to increase the available surface area before you coat the rubble in incindagel and reduce what's left to ash.  No contamination.”

“I oughta have enough.”

“Alpha Leader, Beta Leader, how we doing on our placements?”

“I'm dry, Technical.  You?” Lieutenant George told her as she placed her last charge.

“Site A clear, Technical, all charges placed according to instructions.""

“Aye, Site A clear.  All charges placed,” Sergeant Perez echoed, “Actual, be advised, we are preparing to pull back.”

“Well stop preparing and start moving,” Lieutenant George ordered, “I'd prefer you didn't blow yourselves up.”

“Aye sir,” the two relevant sergeants snapped off, and he beconed to Sergeant Drilldrai to join him in following his own advice.

Then, he reported in, “*Mister Smee,* this is Lost Boys Actual.  Site A cleared, stand by for demolition confirmation.”

“Willco, standing by,” the communications officer in orbit replied, and Lieutenant Drilldrai picked up the speed to keep up with Lieutenant George as they too got out of the effective blast zone.

Once the pair were far enough away, Sergeant Drilldrai checked the platoon members' beacons before she looked to Lieutenant George.  He gave her the thumbs up, and she said to the whole platoon, “Fire in the hole!  Fire in the hole!  Three, two, one!”  When she reached the final number, she depressed her lower right thumb on a detonator, and the distinctive hollow booms of controlled demolitions rolled over the trees.  The festering, bulbous, intruding structures became a garish pile of debris in under sixty seconds, but Sergeant Drilldrai ordered, “Delta squad, pound that pile of rubble until you're out of shells.  Then burn whatever's left to ash.”

“Aye, Technical,” Sergeant Antonio answered grimly.

“Everybody else, watch the site and kill anything that squirms up.""

And so they did.  In short order, the pulverized compound was alight, and the incindagel burned so hotly that even the supposedly inflammable materials were burned away to naught but ash and dust.  Nothing had tried to escape the inferno though; the platoon had been thorough. 

Lieutenant George called up, “Demolition confirmed, no contamination present at Site A.”

“Copy that, Lost Boys Actual.  Be advised, supply drop incoming at planned coordinates.”

“Somebody tell me you sent coffee down with the rest of the supplies,” Lieutenat George grumbled.

“Only if SupCom changed the standard load-outs of LSV resupply pods,” the communications officer replied chipperly.

“Damn,” Lieutenant George sighed, “I'll have to ask the locals.”

“Good icebreaker mister diplomat.”

“Laugh it up, vac-peddler.  Will check in after contact with locals.  Lost Boys Actual, out.”

“Copy that, Lost Boys Actual.  Keep your boots down and your heads up down there.”

“Alright everybody,"" Lieutenant George told his men, ""we have maybe an two or three hours of good daylight left.  Let's try to meet the locals in it.""

Some acknowledgments rolled in, and they began a power armor assisted lope toward Landfall at increasing speeds until they fell into a comfortable forty miles an hour.  Despite the planetary biosphere's relative youth, the forest they moved through was a blend of mighty oaks and scrubby deciduous trees and shrubs, and the further they got from the ashes of Site A, the more signs of wildlife they encountered.  That is, until they began to encounter signs of civilization.  

Roads snaked along the hills, small farmsteads nestled into hollows in the trees, and isolated cabins overlooked their lonesome domains, but these outposts of civilization were empty.  The people had wisely retreated to Landfall, or else they had fallen where they stood their ground.  The shadows were long, and the sky was painted a vibrant orange by the time the settlement came into view.  Settlement was perhaps an uncharitable description, city was more fair, and fortress may apply.  The forest abruptly ended in a rough ten mile circle around the city, and a short mile from the treeline farmland spread out beneath the open sky.  Looming towers stood vigil over the crops and pasture, keen-eyed frontiersmen with their hunting rifles could exact a price on any trying to cross the open ground, and more importantly could offer warning to the civilians.  The towers were an obvious recent addition, their gleaming metal supports betrayed as much, but they'd been there long enough for the farmers to adapt to them.  The towers and their watchmen were hardly Landfall's only defense.  A gray blastcrete wall, already marred by scorch marks, rose from the fields to conceal and protect the city behind like the hulking shoulders of a giant.  Gates yawned open around its ringing defense, and roads spoked out of the ring into the farms and the forests beyond.  Landfall had prepared itself to hold out.

The tell-tale whistle-crack-booms of drop pods snapped through the air, and a spray of dirt along the treeline a mere quarter mile from Lieutenant George and his platoon spoiled the feeling of peace balanced on the brink of violence somewhat.  

“Maybe we should ask the *Mister Smee* to balance it out and make it symmetrical again,” Lance Corporal Tanaka suggested. 

“The point is for LT to get them to pack up,” Private Jamal Adebayo pointed out.

“Somehow,” Corporal Barrett began, “I figure that these folks will be mighty reluctant to leave.”

“Maybe so,” Lieutenant George agreed, “but we don't abandon our people, and we don't leave them without choices.  Technical, peel out some greaseballs and set them to assembling our vehicles and night camp.  Someone see what our boat put in the pods for dinner and get it hot and at least edible.  If you don't have something to do in those two tasks, form up two-man patrols and range out around the circle and make sure that there isn't anything trying to sneak up on us.  I want all three of our scouts to grab some MREs and a spotter and press on to Site B.  You'll have to set up your own camp and catch a little sleep while the rest of us catch up.”

Before he was finished speaking, the relevant troopers began following his orders, and he found himself standing alone as a beat-up ground truck kicked up dust along a road as it drove directly for him.  While it was still a couple miles off, he could use his augmented left eye to zoom in on the driver and get a good look at him.  An older Human man, somewhere past fifty, his sun-reddened face looked like it was used to smiling.  The man wasn't smiling now.  His thin lips were set in a grim line, his green eyes flashed with determination, and worry wrinkled his brow to furrow new lines in his balding pate.  Lieutenant George set his helmet's faceplate to transparent, and consciously kept his expression neutral, professional.  At length, the ground truck slowed to a stop, and the man heaved himself out into the open air.  He wore overalls over stocky legs, and his arms and shoulders were thick with muscle, and this close Lieutenant George could see the scars and calluses on the backs of his hands and palms respectively.  “Good evening,” he said politely to the man as he stumped up to stand before Lieutenant George with his arms folded defiantly. 

“I know who you are, Oathkeeper,” the man said bluntly.

“Please, call me Jason,” Lieutenant George said with no less cordiality than his greeting, and the man seemed taken aback for some reason, “and you have me at a disadvantage, sir.”

“Don't sir me, I work for a living,” the man said reflexively, then darkened with embarrassment, “Er, the name's Sergeant Jackson, Sergeant Earl Jackson, retired.  Sir.”

“RNI?”

“No sir, Army.”

“You're a citizen while I'm a serviceman, but I understand, Sarge,” Lieutenant George said as he let himself faintly smile.  “I take it you've organized these defenses?”

“Yes, that I have.  Yes.”

“Could I be so fortunate to be speaking to the man who can get me some damn coffee?”

Sergeant Jackson's reserve broke and he threw his head back to roar with sudden laughter.  It looked and sounded natural.  After long seconds, the old man at last reined himself in to say, “Aye sir, let's get you and your men some coffee.  Damn navy still won't send it down with you?”

“Selfish bastards,” Lieutenant George agreed, “but after coffee's sorted out, I'd like to talk to your civic leadership if that isn't you.”

“Fuck no, it isn't me.  I'm not that unlucky.”

“We're going to set up camp out here, so as to not impose on your fine city,” Lieutenant George began, but Sergeant Jackson inturrupted him.

“Don't be silly, we have plenty of room inside the wall.  Besides, just because you took out the enemy base doesn't mean you want to pass up on a bed.”

Much obliged, Sergeant.  I'll let my men know, and I'd appreciate it if you could arrange a meeting with civil leadership.  What do you have here?  A city council?  Aldermen?""

“Mayor and council,"" Sergeant Jackson corrected proudly, “I'll see about you talking to both.”

“Thanks again, Sergeant.”

With that, Lieutenant George stepped away to speak with Sergeant Drilldrai on their private channel, “The local militia leader's invited us inside the walls for the night, but I don't want to take advantage of these people's hospitality.  We cook our dinner here first, and the men shall make it clear that they've already eaten before accepting anything offered.  No drinking, but I'll let them accept sealed containers to enjoy once we're shipboard.”

“Aye sir,” Lieutenant Drilldrai acknowledged before she reported, ‘The LSVs are nearly assembled.  We can load up the rest of the supplies and drive them in.  Any idea what kind of hospitality we're getting?""

“The sergeant promised beds, but frontier folk tend toward generous..”

“Good news,” she breathed, “I don't know about you, but I hate sleeping in my armor.”

“Stop whining and see to the men,” Lieutenant George scoffed, “It looks like the militia leader has news about the meeting I need.”

“It's not whining, it's complaining,” Sergeant Drilldrai retorted, “and aye sir.”

Turning back to Sergeant Jackson, Lieutenant George asked, “What's the word?”

“The word is they want to meet ASAP,” the grizzled fronteersman grumbled, “as if you don't have shit to do.”

“The downside of silver bars is talking to the big wigs is part of my shit to do.  My platoon sergeant has things under control here, I could hitch a ride in your truck bed if you'd be so kind.”

“No problem,” the old man said, “Hop on.”

One ride into town later, and Lieutenant George was pleasantly surprised to find that Sergeant Jackson was true to his word, and had stopped at a local coffee house, presumably the old man's favorite.  Chuckling to himself, he gave the locals something of an unusual show: and RNI trooper exiting his armor.  The hiss of breaking seals, the whirring of little servos, and the armor's back opened up as he disengaged the helmet's lock and placed it on the truck cab's roof for safekeeping, then, he slid his arms free of the armor and hauled himself up and out into the briskly cool air of the planets local spring.  Then, clad only in his tightly fitting power armor piloting suit, he strode into the coffee house after his host as he shook his shortened scarlet braid free of his neck. 

“Smells like heaven,” he declared as a little brass bell chimed in the doorway above him, and the quiet hum of the coffee house fell to total silence.  Lieutenant George bore their stares in stride as he padded up to the counter and politely said, “I didn't bring any cred chits down with me, but I'll happily pay any bill.  Hell, the *Mister Smee* will probably cover it now if you ring her up.”

“You- you- you,” the cashier, a ruddy skinned, fair haired Human girl in her late teens stammered, “you are The Oathkeeper!  No charge!”

Lieutenant George put on his most disarming smile and said, “Please, I'm just another trooper doing his job.  You can call me Jason.  Really, it's no trouble to pay, I don't mind.”

“No charge!” she insisted, her eyes wide with scandal.

“I haven't even said what I want yet.”

“Oh!  Yeah!  Uh, can I, I mean may I take your order, Mister Oathkeeper I mean Jason?”

“Aye, I would like a double espresso please.”

“Coming right up!  It won't take long at all, don't worry!”

“Huh,” Sergeant Jackson mused, and Lieutenant George saw a considering light behind his keen eyes.  He decided to let the old man consider.

Shortly thereafter, Lieutenant George found himself in the passenger seat of Sergeant Jackson's truck with the nectar of the gods cupped in his hands.  He sipped at it gratefully as he waited for the old frontiersman to say what was on his mind.  The old man seemed reluctant to speak, however, and the trooper was content to steal the seconds of pleasure where he could find him.  That is, until it seemed to Lieutenant George that the retired soldier might burst, so at last he asked, “Alright, what is it?”

“Nothing,” Sergeant Jackson gruffly grunted, his already ruddy skin reddening further before he amended, “It's just, you're not what I expected.”

“I get that a lot.”

“I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.  Nothing about expecting you to be full of yourself, or...” the old man spun his hand in the air over his stearing wheel as if trying to grasp what he meant as he trailed off.

“Or a battle-hardened hero of the Republic, stalwart and brave?”

The aging soldier snorted derisively before he admitted, “Yes, and no.  I guess you're stalwart and brave under action.  I guess I was too.”

“I just got here, Sergeant, you've been fighting for at least two months.”

“Yes sir, I guess I am too.” Sergeant Jackson admitted, “but that's not what I men.  You're patient, gentle.  I didn't expect that.”

“I expect you know what happens when men like us fail to be patient, to be gentle.  When it's called for.”

“Yes sir, I do.  You're just...”

Lieutenant George let a sad smile grow as he inhaled the soothing scent of strong coffee.  Then he said, “Try not to feel sorry for me, Sergeant.  I've made my choices, and I don't regret them.”

The old soldier considered as he pulled to a stop before the grandly built City Hall with its Grecian columns and brazen dome before he at last said, “Just so you know, no matter what, some of us won't go.  This is our dirt.”

“I can't promise much,” Lieutenant Jason “Oathekeeper” George told the man solemnly, “but I can promise you that I'll tell Command what I think of your defenses.”

Unshed tears shone in the grizzled soldier's eyes as he choked, “I'll leave the truck here.  My place isn't that far.  I don't guess anybody would mess with your armor.”

The meeting was not being held in the mayor's office, but rather the meeting hall within City hall, and it was arranged in the usual way for Republican civic chambers, that is like an arena.  Stadium seating rose toward the edges of the domed ceiling to loom with vague hostility or suspicion over the floor in an encircling ring leaving the only escape a tunnel built through the seating, thus forcing the officials to enter and exit under the watchful eyes of any citizens or civilians who cared to scrutinize the proceedings.  The floor itself was comprised of a wide, open green carpeted space occupied by a long desk with eleven seats arranged in a omega shape so that the councilors and mayor could look at one another while the public in turn watched over their shoulders, and so that there was a gap in the desk for use by people bringing propositions or presentations before the city.  Lieutenant George strode directly into the center and saluted.  The mayor blinked at him for a moment, then she remembered that as the civic leader, she outranked him here and so stood to return the salute. “Thank you for coming Lieutenant,” she said as she took her seat again, and Lieutenant George stood at attention.

Word had apparently gotten around, since people were filing into the seating through doors near the top of the ring.  Worried people, careful people, curious people quietly and politely sorted themselves out into the seats, but the flow of onlookers from the doors kept on steadily as Lieutenant George that blunt facts would be the best approach.

“Madam Mayor, ladies and gentlemen of the City Council, citizens and civilians of the Republic, it is my duty to inform you of certain facts and of the recommendations of the Republican government.”

“As the duly elected representatives of the City of Landfall, we are prepared to be appraised of the situation and the recommendations of Terra.  Proceed, Lieutenant.""

“Aye, first some good news.  By tomorrow afternoon, your fine world of Jefferson will no longer play host to enemy installations.  The nearer of the two has been reduced to ashes on the wind.”  Excited chatter rose from the ring of onlookers even while more and more people joined them, and a few even whooped joyously at the news.  Once they quieted down again, Lieutenant George continued, “It is an unfortunate fact that we shall depart by that time as well, along with the RVN destroyer our platoon is attached to.”

“Where are you going?” a young voice from the crowd demanded hotly.

“We're going where the Lost Boys are always going, to pull somebody out of trouble.  We're the only ones who were fast enough and hard enough to pull you out of your predicament before it got started, and we aren't a garrison force.  Furthermore, First Fleet is stretched thin defending our outer core worlds, and Third Fleet is just as thinly stretched trying to put pressure on the Controllers in their territory.”

“What about Second then?” one of the councilors interjected.

Lieutenant George looked into the middl-aged Doggo man's brown, watery eyes in silence until the other man quailed and looked away, “Scum and villains take the war as an opportunity to expand their trades.  Pirates, smuggles, gangsters and others are making so much work for the Second Fleet that Command is working on getting a Fourth Fleet founded.  These are facts that you could have found out for yourselves, except of course our ongoing operation to cleanse your planet.  Another fact that you are no doubt aware of is that you do not have any SySec.”  An angry buzzing interrupted him, and he simply stood at attention and waited for the people to quiet down again.  When they did, he told them, “If it weren't for the Grubs and their Controllers, you could get along without it just fine until you had the population to support an orbital space station.  If it weren't for the war.  The problem is that you cannot fight at all until the enemy is on the planet, and even then they can get dug in and equipment down before you find them.  Therefore, the Republic of Terra and her Aligned Planets recommends that the people of Jefferson pursue a  policy of general evacuation.”

Absolute pandemonium erupted from the packed stands.

Men shouted and shook their fists, women shrieked and spat insults, and Lieutenant George caught a few phrases as he stood at attention with out so much as twitching or furrowing his brow.  “My mother is buried here!” and “My farm” and “My grandmother bred the oaks for this world!” and various other objections centered around the community's roots going deep despite its relative youth.  Meanwhile the councilors ran the spectrum from hostile stubborn refusal to queasy realization while the Mayor stared at Lieutenant George in slack-jawed shock.  At length, she was recalled to her duties and began to bang the gavel on its wooden anvil demanding “Order!  Order ORDER!” until the crowd's fury reluctantly subsided into a sullen semblance of conforming with her demand.  Once they at last did, she said “You cannot order us to leave our homes.”

“Aye ma'am, that is true.  The Republic of Terra and Her Aligned Planets has no authority to forcibly relocate any of her civilians or citizens.  She cannot and will not become a tyranny even in the face of this awful enemy.  I have merely laid out the facts to you, some you should have known, some you have ignored.  Even now in your dire peril, you remain free men and women.  You are the masters of your own destinies, and I cannot and will not abridge that.  If my own personal recommendations matter to you, I will add this.  The land can be retaken.  The farms and city can be rebuilt.”  He pointed to an infant in the crowd and said, “That is irreplaceable.”

The Next Morning, Sergeant Drilldrai drove one of the three newly assembled LSVs out of one of the city gates.  Despite most people getting a look at the shiny new wheeled vehicles manned by incongruously battle-scuffed power-armored men, that hadn't stopped a small crowd from following them on their way out.  Grav-drives were more versatile than electric motors turning actual wheels, but they were notoriously fragile from the perspective of orbital dropped equipment.  Tracked vehicles were also out of the question.  Too bulky and too heavy.  Hence, Light Squad Vehicles kicked up dust with their cellular tires as they gained speed once they were outside the walls.  It was time to get back to work.

“Did you get an answer?” she asked Lieutenant George.

The lieutenant performed an unnecessary check on his sidearm in the passenger seat beside her before he answered. “No.  They were still debating what to do when I checked in this morning.”

“Any updates from orbit?”

“The hypercom relay's back up.  The *Mister Smee* put some detection satellites orbiting some of the other rocks in-system to hopefully give the locals some advanced warning when the Grubs come back.”

Sergeant Drilldrai grunted noncommittally.

“It's not as simple as you think.  Try and imagine if the *We Sing* couldn't move, and someone came along and told you you'd have to leave her to be taken by the enemy.  This planet is like that for these people.”

“Planeters,” Sergeant Drilldrai scoffed, but her heart wasn't in it.  She understood.  She just didn't like the thought of people getting killed because the Republic couldn't get there to help quickly enough.

She couldn't see it behind Lieutenant George's opaque faceplate, but she got the sense he was grinning at her.  She elected not to say anything as she lead the platoon off the road and began to drive through the woods.  Unsurprisingly, the settlers hadn't built a road to the enemy installation, so the local sun was high overhead by the time they'd come upon the coordinates where they'd determined to leave their LSVs and rendezvous with the scouts.  Sergeant Drilldrai brought the LSV to a gentle halt, and the other two vehicles came to similarly gentle stops a short distance behind.  Then, they dismounted to meet PFC Raj Patel, PFC Reyes, PFC Kim, and their spotters.

“Alright, what's the word?” Lieutenant George asked.

“The word is that the enemy's riled up like a kicked anthill,” PFC Reyes snarled, “They've got patrols out, their kamikaze drones are already in the air, they have laser emplacements up and energized.  They intend to make us pay for it..”

“Don't they know the enemy only exists to be destroyed?” the lieutenant asked, but nobody finished the saying.  This enemy would never stop being the enemy.

“What are you thinking, Actual?"" Sergeant Drilldrai asked.

“I'm thinking that there's no good reason to charge a fortified prepared position manned by alert enemies when I can call the *Mister Smee* and get a little CAS to drop some ordinance on their heads instead.”

“That sounds like a great thought, sir,” PFC Patel said emphatically, “a very good thought *indeed*.”

While the Lieutenant was coordinating with the *Mister Smee,* Sergeant Drilldrai got the platoon moving.  She understood full well that after the Navy dropped some warheads on foreheads, they'd have to move in and mop up.  To that end, she sent Delta Squad to set up their ordinance on a bluff overlooking the facility, and had Alpha and Beta Squads creep through the trees and shrubs as close to the milling mass as they reasonably could.  At a full sprint, they'd be among the four bulbous buildings in under a minute.

By the time they were all in position, atmosphere-capable attack craft screamed overhead, they were already launching missiles that billowed trails of smoke behind them like the wings of avenging angels before the high-pitched whines of their engines caught up to them along with their sonic booms.  Hellfire rained down on the distillation in the blink of an eye, and the craft were already climbing back to their ship in orbit.  Thousands of tiny kamikaze drones detonated by way of chain reaction, laser platforms overloaded and erupted, and Grub Victims dropped to the ground as their Controllers perished in the conflagration, while others fired wildly into the sky in a hopeless gesture of futile rage. 

Even as the enemy's attention was skyward, the whole of the platoon opened fire without mercy.  Riflemen and SAW operators cut down the Grub victims where they stood, while the heavy ordinance teams of Delta Squad pulverized what was left of the buildings until the last of the victims fell, either due to their Controllers being killed, or the grim work of Alpha and Beta squads.  The world went silent.

Then, after a few heartbeats, Lieutenant George ordered into the stillness, “Burn it.”

The remains of the Grub Controller invasion force smoldered sullenly at the platoon's backs as they rode their LSVs to the pickup point just outside of the city's supporting farmland.  Nobody had anything to say on the ride.  Sergeant Drilldrai could spare one hand to rest on her cousin's shoulder.  She knew they'd celebrate their victory later, but none of them would feel like they could until they were all shipboard again.  The locals might or might not appreciate the LSVs that were being left behind, or they might be left behind again soon in any case.  Sergeant Drilldrai didn't dwell on it overmuch.  She simply hoped that they'd see some use by good Republican people either way.  They might appreciate the AA shotgun and RNI Standard Service Rifle that she “forgot in the LSV along with all of the other ”forgotten"" weapons.  The *Mister Smee* would be able to replace them so cheaply it woudln't even make a new line item on the budget. 

They filed into the shuttle just as soon as its side doors slid open.  She wasn't surprised to find Lieutenant George offering a comforting hand on her upper shoulder as he reported in, “This is Lost Boys Actual, platoon all present and accounted for on pickup.  No casualties.  Some minor equipment losses.”

I came here for my partner and honestly, I feel like I didn’t think about the big decision that I was making of moving to another country for a partner so when arriving in Australia, after a few months, we decided to get married and we’ve been married since and honestly in the beginning everything was new. I thought Australia was beautiful. I mean Australia has beaches. You know theres  good coffee here & work life balanc. I mean, it just seemed like the ideal place to live and raise a family but after about two years of living here, I started feeling like oh my God like I’m actually living in a different country far away from my family far away from everything that I know, and I started just kind of questioning my decision because I feel like I never really thought about how big of a decision this was and honestly that’s my fault. So now, four years of living here I wanna go back home. I don’t have any friends here.  The  past four years, I’ve been trying to make friends and to be honest back home in the US I’ve never had issues making friends never. The thing about the US is when you go to the grocery shop when or run errands  you meet people and people talk to you. A compliment or even how are you there’s a lot of human interaction. There’s a lot of like human interactions that they just they just made me happy and just blessed but in Australia, there’s not much human interactions if I have even any human attractions usually it’s negative and honestly, I’m just tired. I’m tired. I’m mentally drained. I’m exhausted and I don’t want to be here anymore. I do have a child. . I know that my mental health has declined. I know that I feel lonely sad and my husband has friends here. He has his childhood friends. I’ve tried to get closer to them, but I just feel like I just don’t connect to them and ultimately I just feel alone and I just feel like this is not my home. It just doesn’t feel like my home and I wish I could just go back to the US like tomorrow. My husband is open to moving to the US but it isn’t something that he wants to do.

\- The coffee table is temporary. We attempted to refinish it, but it's beyond our current abilities. Because there is so much wood already, we are thinking to replace it with something with a glass top.

\- We unfortunately can't mount the tv because the quality of our walls is spotty at best. I know it's very large 😅 We needed a new tv and I wanted to get a size that would make sense in future (hopefully larger) spaces. 

\- Our hunch is that a gallery wall above the tv will be too much on the eyes. We've had seasonal garland up there in the past and it's worked quite nice. Perhaps a long horizontal shelf?

\- My roommate is trying to find a trinket shelf for the empty wall to the right of the couch.

1qh6369,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcp/comments/1qh6369/built_an_mcp_server_for_telegram_after_none_of/,Built an MCP server for Telegram after none of the existing ones clicked for me,"Tried a bunch of MCP servers and tools for getting notifications from my AI agents. Slack integrations, Discord bots, custom webhook setups. Tried other Telegram MCPs too. Even tried remote tools like Omnara for cloud IDE communication. None of them clicked. Either too complicated, only worked with one IDE, cluttered context with 10 different tools, required local network access, or the agent just... didn't use them right.

So I wrote my own. Telegram MCP.

**What makes it different:**

You tell the agent ""communicate with me using Telegram MCP"" and you're done. That's it. All the instructions for how to use it properly — when to wait for replies, how to structure messages, how to handle confirmations — are baked into the tool description itself. I've observed agents reliably follow these patterns without me having to explain anything else.

**Why it works for me:**

* **One tool.**  There's an optional second one for history, but it's rarely used, so in future, it might be removed.
* **Works from anywhere.** Phone, laptop, coffee shop. No VPN, no local network, no tunneling.
* **Telegram.** Billions of people already have it. No new app, no signups, no friction.
* **Media.** Send and receive images, files, voice notes. Agent can share results, I can send references.
* **Multi-agent ready.** Project headers + session names keep things organized. Multiple agents in the same chat, no confusion.
* **2 minute setup.** Message bot → get chat ID → paste config → done.

I'm hosting a server right now so onboarding is easy — otherwise everyone would need to create their own Telegram bot which adds friction. Planning to make it fully open source with optional self-hosting for those who prefer it.

After building this, it's the only thing I use. Works with precision, confidence, and reliability. I've stopped second-guessing whether notifications will come through or if the agent will use the tool correctly.

**Try it:** [https://iamkucuk.github.io/Telegram-MCP/](https://iamkucuk.github.io/Telegram-MCP/)

The website is one page and explains how to set it up in 2 basic steps.

Zero logs, works with anything MCP-compatible. The server is being hosted in EU and is just a passthrough, nothing is stored, so it should be GDPR compliant. 

I'm open for any kind of criticism, feature requests and bug reports. Once it is open-sourced, PRs are also welcomed.

Hope you can enjoy it as I do.

If you like a cocktail, beer or coffee that’s usually the end of the conversation with wine liking it somehow feels like it’s not enough on its own.  
I think part of it is how wine is framed as something you’re supposed to understand. There’s this quiet expectation that enjoyment should be backed up by knowledge grape, region, price, tasting notes and if you can’t explain why you like it maybe you’re missing something. That pressure doesn’t really exist with most other drinks.  
  
Wine also carries a lot of social weight. It shows up at dates, work dinners, celebrations and group settings where choices feel visible. Suddenly it’s not just about taste it’s about what your choice might signal to other people. That makes it easy to distrust your instincts and look for external validation instead.  

What’s strange is that taste is still personal, your palate didn’t suddenly become unreliable just because the label looks fancy.

Sugar can be found commonly at: grocery stores, dollar stores, general stores, bakeries, coffee shops, abandoned homes, factories specializing in sweet foods, food warehouses (like food banks or otherwise delivery hubs), hotels, white collar job sites, and generally anywhere that coffee can also be found, since they are a common pairing. 

A common alternative to Sugar is honey, though syrup made from the sap of certain trees such as maple and Hickory is also sweet. Additionally, Sugar can be grown and extracted from Sugar beets.

1qh60t3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/1qh60t3/econ_agricultural_production/,[ECON] Agricultural production.,"******

Brazil’s agricultural strategy for the late 1950s and early 1960s is deliberately reoriented away from the historical pattern of raw commodity export dependence toward a high-throughput, processing-intensive agro-industrial system. Primary production growth is treated as a necessary but insufficient condition; the decisive objective is to capture value inside the national economy, stabilize prices, and convert agricultural abundance into industrial inputs, export manufactures, and fiscal resilience.

# Coffee

Coffee remains the dominant foreign-exchange earner and therefore a macroeconomic anchor rather than a purely agricultural commodity. Output expansion goes from an estimated baseline of approximately 21 million 60kg bags in 1958 toward roughly 28 million bags by 1962 and 33-36 million bags by 1966.

Between 1958 and 1959, domestic roasting and grinding capacity is expanded in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais to absorb rising output internally. From 1959 to 1961, soluble coffee plants are installed near the ports of Santos and Rio, reducing bulk export dependence and freight inefficiencies. Packaging, branding, and export logistics are progressively integrated between 1961 and 1963, with the explicit target that by the mid-1960s approximately 50% of coffee exports leave the country in processed or semi-processed form. This sequencing is intended to stabilize producer incomes while dampening the boom-bust dynamics historically associated with raw coffee exports.

# Sugarcane

Sugarcane policy is executed as a multi-output industrial system rather than a single export channel. Cane production expands from roughly 95 million tons in 1958 toward 140-145 million tons by 1966, while sugar output rises from approximately 4.5 million to 7.5 million tons over the same horizon.

Initial measures in 1958–1959 focus on mill consolidation, boiler efficiency upgrades, and rail connectivity. From 1959 to 1961, ethanol and industrial alcohol distillation capacity is expanded to absorb molasses and stabilize sugar cycles. Bagasse-based power generation and by-product processing are integrated between 1961 and 1963, followed by chemical, yeast, and animal feed applications in the final phase. By program maturity, more than 40% percent of sugarcane value is expected to derive from non-sugar outputs, reducing export vulnerability and strengthening domestic industrial linkages.

# Grains

Grain policy is governed by the requirement to stabilize urban consumption while reducing import exposure, rather than by export maximization. Maize production expands from approximately 20 million tons in 1958 to nearly 34 million tons by 1966, and wheat from 1 to 3 million tons.

The 1958–1959 phase prioritizes silo construction and milling modernization to reduce post-harvest losses. Between 1959 and 1961, feed mills, starch plants, and brewing inputs are expanded to absorb rising maize output, followed by food-processing integration through 1963. By the mid-1960s, the emphasis shifts toward price stabilization, strategic reserves, and reduced reliance on wheat imports, rather than aggressive grain exports.

# Oilseeds.

Oilseed expansion is conditioned strictly on domestic crushing and refining capacity to prevent raw export leakage. Aggregate oilseed output increases from approximately 2.5 million tons in 1958 to between 6-6.5 million tons by 1966.

Initial capacity expansion in 1959 focuses on crushing facilities, followed by edible and industrial oil refining between 1960 and 1962. Protein meal output is integrated into livestock systems from 1962 onward, while specialty oils increasingly supply chemical, soap, lubricant, and food-processing industries. By full program maturity, vegetable oil output more than doubles with minimal exposure to external markets.

# Livestock.

Livestock expansion is deliberately constrained by slaughtering, refrigeration, and transport capacity to avoid destabilizing price cycles. Meat output is targeted to increase by approximately 50-60% percent by 1966, while dairy production rises from roughly 10 billion liters in 1958 to 15-16 billion liters.

Modernization of slaughterhouses begins immediately, followed by refrigeration and transport integration through 1961. Export-grade meatpacking and sanitary certification are phased in between 1961 and 1963, while dairy processing capacity for powdered milk, butter, and cheese is expanded in the final phase. The emphasis remains on reliability and quality, and fullfiled domestic demand before exporting.

# Cotton

Cotton lint production expands from approximately 700.000 tons in 1958 to around 1.4 million tons by 1966. Early interventions focus on seed quality and ginning efficiency, followed by spinning and weaving capacity expansion between 1959 and 1961. Yarn and fabric exports emerge in the early 1960s, with finished textiles gaining prominence only after domestic demand is secured. Sisal and jute follow parallel trajectories, supporting packaging, construction, and logistics.

# Specialized Crops and Processed Exports

Cocoa and fruit production are expanded selectively to stabilize export margins through processing. Cocoa output increases from approximately 200,000 tons in 1958 to over 310,000 tons by 1966, with early emphasis on grinding, cocoa butter, and powder production before limited semi-finished chocolate exports are introduced. Fruit production is increasingly oriented toward cold storage, canning, juices, and concentrates, with branded processed exports emerging after 1963.

# Inputs, Fertilizers, and Mechanization Feedback

Underlying all commodity targets is a staged expansion of inputs. Credit reform and fertilizer logistics are addressed in 1958–1959, followed by domestic phosphate and nitrogen capacity ramp-up through 1962. Mechanization diffusion accelerates between 1961 and 1964, allowing yield growth rather than acreage expansion to dominate in the final phase. Fertilizer use per hectare is projected to triple by full program maturity, anchoring productivity gains without destabilizing land markets.

# Conclusion.

The execution window for this integrated agricultural and agro-industrial program extends from 1958 to 1966, with visible gains by 1960–1961 and structural maturity expected between 1964 and 1966. By completion, more than 60% of agricultural export value is projected to derive from processed or semi-processed goods.

The *Mister Smee* didn't have any windows, or portholes, or viewscreens.  She was a ship of war, and every last thousandth of an inch of her hull was covered in thick armor and battlescreen emitters.  Excepting of course where such emitters would interfere with weapons platforms, sensor arrays  and communication equipment.  Those facts were neither here nor there to all and sundry aboard her, both Republican Void Navy and Republican Naval Infantry except for those who happen to have grown up in a particular way.  For most people, before enlisting anyway, a ship is a ship.  One boards her and bids her farewell a week or three later, and other than fond memories of the trip, the vessel shan't be spared a second thought.  Spacers weren't most people though.  In the Republic of Terra and Her Aligned Planets, spacers came in several varieties, in despite of their rarity.  By far and away, the most common, and most alike to normal folks who lived on planets, were stationers.  Hardly spacers at all, these people lived aboard space stations for one reason or another whether they had a job at a spaceport, or worked a gas giant extraction rig, or a thousand other sensible reasons to live in an orbital habitat.  After that, there are long-haulers, solitary folk who live in a relatively small portion of their ship, but nevertheless will one day settle down dirtside somewhere someday.  Another kind of spacers were nomads of various flavorings, the most numerous weren't Terrans, except for the Terrans adopted by the Star Sailors, but after a century of living with these honorable and loyal nomads in and among their territory, Terrans had several imitation bands about the cosmos.  Then of course, there were the Terrans who belonged to both the Republic and the Star Sailors by heritage, like First Lieutenant Jason George.  The trouble was, he grew up on ships plying the hyperspace sea, and he'd gotten used to looking through a window, or a porthole, or a viewscreen at the swirling chaotic colors of the ship's reality bubble colliding with the ravages  of the hyperspace sea.  Even after years of combat drops, he found he still missed its beautiful turmoil. 

Lieutenant George was less of an oddity in the Lost Boys Rapid Deployment Division.  As a matter of fact, there were other men of the name elsewhere in the division attached to other destroyers in the Second Star Rapid Response Group.  The George family, The DuPont family, The Browns, the Longstride family, and some others of less note but no less valor were what in the Lost Boys and the Ignitia diaspora were called The Founders.  Such names were near to commonplace in the Lost Boys division, and the two other related formations, the aforementioned SS RRG, and the Fighting Pixies Shipboard Troopers Division, and their histories with the formations was long and etched in sacrifice.  This was one of the things that made Lieutenant George feel more at home than elsewhere in Republican services.  So he supposed, in any case.  Another thing that made him feel more at home was another oddity, and this one no more common in the Lost Boys than among the rest of RNI.  His cousin Trandrai Drilldrai was his staff sergeant, and Staff Sergeant Drilldrai's rarity was not due only to the fact that she was a woman, but also that she was of the Weiging people, who most called Star Sailors.  At a head taller than Lieutenant George's six-foot-six, she was uncommonly short for her people, and her frame was likewise uncommonly laden with sinuous strength; this was due to the extensive genetic modifications she underwent during puberty to be able to survive in Terran Standard gravity unaided.  More importantly, it enabled her to survive a ride dirtside in an RNI drop pod.  These obvious differences notwithstanding, the four-armed, blue skinned woman was kin to the pale-pink hued scarlet maned Human man by both heritage and tradition, and were a comfort to one another.

Comfort was far from the minds of either at oh-four-hundred hours (Navy Standard Time) on January the Fourteenth in the Year Post Colonization One Thousand Eight-Hundred Eighty-Two.  Rather, duty did lay on their minds just as the silver bars laid across the khaki of Jason's duty uniform, and the staff sergeant chevrons likewise across Trandrai's upper shoulders.  They stood at the front of a room just large enough to fit their entire platoon two to a desk without it being uncomfortably crowded.  Neither was it comfortably spacious, on the other hand.  Space on a warship was a valued commodity, and the vitality of these men's work made manifest in such little luxuries the Navy could afford them.  That platoon gazed upon their CO and platoon sergeant with the hard eyes of men older than their years, but mingled with that was the trust and respect afforded to a commander they knew well.  “Good morning, brothers,” Lieutenant George began.

“What's good about it?” Lance Corporal Yusuf Tanaka japed from near the back, his dark almond eyes twinkling with mirth.

“Coffee, for one,” Lieutenant George mildly mused as he sipped for emphasis.  Staff Sergeant Drilldrai gave him a dirty look, as for her race coffee was a strong intoxicant.  “For another, there's work to  do.  It's always good to put in a little work for our Republic and her civvies.”

A light chuckling rolled through the room, and PFC Niko Gonzales peeled his black lips back from his fangs in an unconscious snarl to ask, “More urban work?”

Lieutenant George took that opportunity to call up a holographic display of the planet they were currently traveling to, “Not this time.  Jefferson is an in-progress terraforming project, and it was supposed to be finished in about fifty years.”

“Just fifty?” Corporal Hiroshi Diaz muttered as he accepted a tablet loaded with briefing materials from Staff Sergeant Drilldrai in his ruddy, calloused hand.

“The world got started a century back.  They got ignored by the Axxaakk during the dominion war since it's atmosphere was under construction.  Since then it's been going according to schedule, but it's still largely unpopulated, and it's going for Terra-like wildlife.  Nothing special was planned or came out in the process, except maybe for some pretty lake views in the mountains.  If you like that sort of thing.  The point is, it's frontier, but they're Republican, and the hypercom relay for the system went down a local week ago.  The days there miss an hour, so it's been a little less than a week standard.”

“You'd think they would have figured out that lets us know something's wrong by now,” Sergeant Elias Perez sighed with a forward flick of his tawny triangular ears.

“Better than letting our civvies and cits give us the heads up on what we're going dirtside into, from their point of view,” Lieutenant George explained.  “Point is we peeled off Reyes and Kim to go have a look-see.  Most of you probably figured out that our scouts went scouting already, but I know that a couple of you have taken a few too many TBIs.”  The platoon chuckled heartily at that, “As for that, it is the Controllers.  They've got Grub victims on the ground, mostly Axxaakk victims from their farms, a couple Lutrae.  No Terrans.  Anyway, they didn't try to aug any of those crab things they like on lightworlds, so the Axxaakk victims are getting double use as infantry and construction.”

“Construction?”

“Aye, it's looking like they think they can take one of our worlds and make it into a FOB or a staging point,” Sergeant Drilldrai said as she passed out the final tablet and began her way back up the room's central aisle, “They probably think that they'll be able to entrench before we can muster to do anything about it.”

“And that's where we come in,” Lieutenant George said as he gestured at the holographic display to zoom in on a specific location, “This is Landfall.  Not the worst name for a colony's first town, and it's almost a city.  Landfall, Jefferson certainly sounds better than Hopeville, Hope.”  Lieutenant George paused to let the laughter die down again before continuing, “This isn't our main objective, but according to Kim, the settlers have turned it into a fair fortress.  Point is it's full of civvies, and we'll want to make sure any roughhousing is done a good distance away.”  He scrolled a couple hundred miles on the map to display another structure on the planet, or rather another collection of structures.  Unlike the fortified Landfall, it looked alien, jarringly out of place, like a festering growth on an otherwise healthy body.  “This is our first main objective.  They're trying to build a Grub hatchery here, and you can bet they're still trying to breed a Grub that they can control an adult Terran with.”  The latter half of that sentence was laden with hatred, and Lieutenant George was obliged to pause for the wave of dark agreement to roll over his platoon before he continued, “We need to remove this installation.”

“By remove...” Sergeant Yusuf Ivanov began spinning a blunt claw in the air as if trying to pin something down in the air, but Staff Sergeant Drilldrai interrupted him.

“We mean completely demolish.  We're bringing down the appropriate party favors, so sergeants and corporals take a little extra care.”

“Aye sarge,” the platoon rumbled.

“Sergeant Drilldrai has been working on prelim demo schematics, but we figure things'll change once we set eyes on the objective.  We aren't letting a single one of those things survive the assault, understood?”

“Aye, sir,” came the grim reply.

“Now we won't be headed for pickup straight after we finish up our work at Site A.  That's right, Site A implies a Site B, and unfortunately it's about a hundred miles out from Site A, but I've talked to Captain Lee about getting a supply drop sorted out.  We'll fall back to Landfall, pick up supply pods, and fort up for the night there.  Command wants me to try to convince the settlers to organize an evacuation, so do your best not to make me look like a jackass.  Engineering is getting us some disassembled LSVs in our supply drop, and you greaseballs get to have fun playing mechanic overnight, on account of how I don't much fancy walking all that long way.”  Lieutenant George paused to scroll along the holographic map, and his platoon chuckled lightly before he continued, “Site B appears to be a backup landing site.  Same deal as Site A, we set up our party favors and have ourselves a little light show, and burn anything that tries to wriggle out.  Then, we regroup, check equipment, I make sure none of you idiots got stuck in a hole or anything, and we run our happy asses back to Landfall so our pickup pilot can use a nice, engineered landing pad for once.”

“I think it's so she can sneak out to a dirtside bar while nobody's looking,"" Corporal Dale Barrett mock whispered across the aisle. 

Lieutenant George hid a smile as he snapped, “And you'll be sober at muster, Barrett.”

“Aw come on, you're no fun,” the corporal scoffed, running a hand mottled by scars though thick, cropped short blonde hair while he pretended to not be reminded of an embarrassing muster when he was a private.

“Any questions?” Lieutenant George asked as if his platoon wasn't laughing and hurling japes and insults at Corporal Barrett

“Will the locals give us trouble?” Corporal John Johnson asked soberly.

“They've been making trouble for the Controllers, but they're underarnned for the work,” Sergeant Drilldrai answered, “Their militia is mostly citizens, and the civvies have cit attitudes.  They'll probably fall in if you can figure out how to not sound like a moron issuing orders.”

“Let you and the Lieutenant do that, Sarge,” PFC Even Novac cheerily agreed.

“Any terraforming equipment to be worried about down there?”Lance Corporal Oliver Miller inquired as he scrolled through his briefing materials. 

“Any equipment still present is ecological in nature,” Sergeant Drilldrai explained, “the geological alterations and materiel additions have been complete for a while.  Frankly, everybody but a Terran would call Jefferson a complete project.  Well, everybody who bothers living on planets in any case.”

Sergeant Perez flexed his hands, extending and retracting his claws as he asked, “Other than the grubs themselves, should we worry about contamination? ”

“Aye,” Lieutenant George answered seriously, “Just because we'd like the people to evacuate doesn't mean we want to wreck their home.  We think this is going to become a battlefield eventually, but that's not a guarantee.  Sergeant Drilldrai has taken that into account, and I expect you all to take the proper measurements and readings when you finalize the demolition plan with her.”

“Aye sir,” the entire platoon replied without hesitation.

“Anything else?” Lieutenant George prompted.  Upon getting no further questions he said, “Muster at zero eight-hundred hours.  Dismissed.”

At zero eight hundred hours (Navy Standard), Staff Sergeant Trandrai Drilldrai strode in her power armor before her mustered platoon with her CO at her side.  She didn't strictly need to stop in front of each trooper and check his vitals, she could query their power armor from her HUD, but the men felt better if they knew she was doing it.  She did a lot of things that weren't strictly necessary because it made the men feel like she had their backs, like she was holding them to a standard.  It was why First Lieutenant Jason George strode beside her too; to let the men know the man who proposed to have them at his back didn't overlook them.  Their temperatures were in their normal ranges, breathing and heartrates were steady, eye movement and pupil contraction normal.  No outliers.  These men didn't have any green boots among them, they were all bloodied drop troopers of the RNI, of the Lost Boys, and they knew it.

Finding everything squared away, Staff Sergeant Drilldrai turned to Lieutenant George and reported, “All present and accounted for, sir.  Platoon stands ready for deployment.”

“Good news, Sergeant,” he answered before he ordered, “Get them loaded up.  We have an appointment to keep.”

“Aye sir,” she replied before snapping off a ritualistic salute and ordering, “Platoon!  Man the pods!”

Two by two, the men entered the tight drop pods, and strapped themselves in, prepared to be shot like so many shells at the upcoming surface of Jefferson.  First, the fire teams, then their leaders, then the squad sergeants, and that left Sergeant Drilldrai and Lieutenant George alone together as the last of the sergeants was drawn into the ship's drop pod loading tube.

“Once more into the breach,"" Lieutenant George said with a crooked smile, “How's your ankle, Tran?”

“Better,” she answered, “Did you get a chance to drop by the mail room?”

“No, and we haven't had a rendezvous since we sent our scouts ahead anyway.”

“Aye, I guess so.”

“You expecting a package?”

“You were supposed to get your birthday present ages ago.”

Lieutenant George shrugged and said, “It'll catch up when it catches up.  In the meanwhile we have work to do.”

“I hate waiting in the tube,” Sergeant Drilldrai muttered as she started strapping herself in, “It's scorched unsettling.”

“Same thing, but the *Mister Smee* is a good ship, and she has a good crew.  We'll make it out.”

“Shut up, Jason,” she muttered as the pod closed in front of her and she felt her pod drawn into the loading tube, then shifted into the port drop pod launching chamber.  She could her his pod being chambered on the starboard side beside her, and she tried not to think about the fact that the *Mister Smee* would be doing battle when she translated to realspace.  

She hated waiting in the tube.  To distract herself just as much as for any other reason, Sergeant Drilldrai keyed her comms to listen in.  Third Company, First Platoon was an old hand at this, and consequently there was a decent level of pre-drop chatter across all squads.  Some of the men were making plans for the rec-room after pickup, others were discussing whether a live-on terraforming project would make a nice place to settle down one day, and the old standby of the eternally unsettled debate among men raged as it always did: whether breasts or bottoms held the greater beauty.  Sergeant Drilldrai, of course, held the obviously correct opinion that bottoms were superior since a man can have a fine bottom, but a man with quality breasts is unsettling.  Sergeant Drilldrai briefly considered making this case again, but decided against it.

A slight change in the background thrum of the *Mister Smee's* systems, and she knew that they'd made the translation.  The SS RRG used speed and firepower to do their job.  Speed, firepower, and shear Terran stubbornness.  The fine voidsmen of the *Mister Smee* would get them dirtside if they had to do it under fire.  They were good enough to do it, too.  Not one trooper lost  in the tube, not ever.  Sergeant Drilldrai still hated waiting in  the tube.

An edge of tension entered into the men's voices as they planned, as they ribbed one another, as they debated, as the troopers too recognized that they were under action, and powerless to do anything at all to affect the outcome.  Just when Sergeant Drilldrai thought she might scream in pure frustration, well, maybe not quite pure, Lieutenant George broke in across the platoon, “The *Mister Smee* does battle, brothers, and soon it'll be time for us to go to work, bloody work.  I invite any who would seek the guidance of God to join me in prayer.""

The Lieutenant's voice was a rock of unshakable faith.  He'd always had that quality, when he spoke about his spiritual life, even when he was only Jason and she was only Trandrai.  Just like that, the bitter tang of fear tainted frustration receded in Sergeant Drilldrai's heart, and she joined in to listen to her CO pray.  She wasn't alone, far from it.  The whole of their platoon didn't join, but it was only nine men shy.  Moreover, Sergeant Drilldrai knew for a fact that not all of the attendees were Catholics, and she had heard some of them hotly insist on their atheism.  Nevertheless, they were here.  Restrained as she was, Sergeant Drilldrai couldn't properly fold her four hands,  but she clasped them together in pairs and bowed her head and waited with patience. 

“Oh Lord,” Lieutenant George began, “we go now into battle.  We do not doubt the righteousness of our cause, for our enemy revels in the very depths of evil.  We do not hold those we defend in contempt, for those who can take up what they can.  We do not fear to fall, for we know our days are numbered and we shall meet at the appointed time.  Should we find doubt, let it be the doubt that spares the innocent.  Should we find contempt, let it be for evil.  Should we find fear, let it be fear that our valor should fail.  Aye, do not take this fear from us, for without it, valor shall be without courage.  Send to guide us your saints and angels, and should we be required to spend our blood on the field of battle, let it not be spilled in vain nor unavenged.  In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, amen.”

“Amen,” Sergeant Drilldrai answered with a scattered smattering of her troopers.  She hated wai-

There was a tremendous bang, and Sergeant Drilldrai was slammed into her restraints.  She was away, and her nerves and frustration were left behind.  It was time to go to work, bloody work.

A few seconds of weightless freefall, and Sergeant Drilldrai tapped on some buttons placed near her hands in the confines of the pod.  Screens leapt to life, and she studied the various feeds of the onrushing ground all centered around a steadily flashing beacon.  Feeds from cameras, radar, lidar, infrared, and other classified sensors along with her pod's own trajectory data and the *Mister Smee's* tracking of it and its fellows told the tale of their descent.  Captain Agamemnon Lee knew his trade well, and his bridge crew was taught and ship-shape.  In particular Lieutenant Commander Ashley Sheffield was a steady hand at the helm, and had put them on target so well that Sergeant Drilldrai's pod didn't need any steering input from her at all.  A glance told her it was the same for everyone behind her, and unless one of the men decided to land on an enemy they could pass the trip down in idle chatter.

The pod began to rattle as it hit the thin upper atmosphere, and Sergeant Drilldrai began to notice the increasing effect of Jefferson's  gravity acting on her body.  Sergeant Drilldrai decided to call up the scouts' helmet feeds to get a closer look at the LZ.  It seemed that the scouts had elected to busy themselves with disrupting enemy patrols rather than standing guard over the beacon.  From what she could see, it appeared that the Controllers had finally admitted that they could run out of victims before the Republic ran out of bullets, since the patrol that PFC Sebastian Rayes was currently disrupting used two armored vehicles.  It had forced him to switch from his anti-personnel sniper pattern magacc rifle his to anti-material pattern alternative, which meant he had to be more careful both  for his own safety and for the safety of any noncombatants which might be in the vicinity, not to mention its far more cumbersome bulk.  It slowed him down by a noticeable margin.  It was much the same with PFC Finn Kim, though PFC Kim had a slightly better understanding of the target vehicles.  Sergeant Drilldrai smiled to herself as she thought about how considerate her boys were to keep the enemy too busy to make her landing condition boots down and hot.  That was condition normal for Lost Boys drops, but any time they could get an ADRSS out ahead of them, they always tried to do more than designate the LZ.

The rattling became more intense as Sergeant Drilldrai's pod fell deeper into Jefferson's atmosphere, and she began preparing herself for impact.  She keyed back her main screen to show the exterior camera feed.  The scouts' disruption seemed to be working, since she couldn't see anything like an incoming patrol, or enemy vehicle closing in on the LZ.  The idle chatter of her platoon tapered off.

Lieutenant George didn't know whether anybody was there to appreciate the tell-tale whistle-crack-boom of a drop pod impact, but he supposed that the residents of Landfall might have at least noticed the sonic booms of his platoon's entry.  “Lost Boys Actual, boots down and checking in,” he said with his comms keyed to reach the *Mister Smee.*

“We Read you Lost Boys Actual,” the communications officer aboard the *Mister Smee* answered, “We read you loud and clear.  Be advised, void supremacy not established.”

“Rodger that, *Mister Smee.*  Proceading to check platoon deployment and advancing on first objective.  Lost Boys Actual out.""

“Acknowledged.  Next scheduled check-in in T-minus three hours.  *Mister Smee* out.”

“Lost Boys Technical, boots down and checking in,” came Sergeant Drilldrai's voice over his comms.

“Commo good, I read you Technical.  Get your party favors packed up, and let's start making tracks toward Site A.”

“Aye sir,” she answered, and Lieutenant George began taking his own advice while she continued, “Squad sergeants should be hitting any second now.  Tracking was good on ride down.”

“Aye Technical,” Lieutenant George agreed, “I guess you saw our dynamic duo getting the party started before we hit dirt?”

“Aye sir.”

Lieutenant George mag-locked the last of the explosives packs to his lower back and took his assault-pattern magacc rifle in his armored hands, “Let's go get limbered up.”

“Alpha Leader, boots down and checking in,"" Sergeant Perez purred, “No contacts as of yet, but if they haven't noticed us, they're blind and deaf.”

“Beta Leader, boots down and checking in,”  came Sergeant Ivanov's gruff voice with barely a heartbeat's waiting as he rasped, “Proceeding to put eyes on Site A.”

Nearly on top of him, Sergeant James Antonio chimed, “Delta Leader, boots down and checking in,” the burly Human's voice was discordantly musically high whenever Lieutenant George was looking at him, but at times where he was merely listening, it was rather pleasant.  “The scouts found us a nice elevated position.  We'll have the morters set up shortley after the whole squad's dirtside.”

“Good work brothers,” Lieutenant George snapped as he loped to where the scouts were making trouble for the aforementioned enemy patrol. “Check in again  when everybody's boots down.  I want to start poking holes in enemy fortifications before they know we're  hitting them.”

“Aye sir,” the squad sergeants sounded, and Lieutenant George nodded to himself. 

“Technical,” he called as the patrol came into view.  The Controller had Grub victims firing plasma casters wildly in all directions all about four APCs, and they were doing a decent job of getting the surrounding woods going in a conflagration.

“Go ahead,"" she answered.

“Take a peek at my camera feed.”

“Void them!"" she cursed.

“Aye,” Lieutenant George agreed, “You know about counter burns?”

“The theory,"" she admitted hesitantly, “but I'm better with structures.”

“Aye, but the trouble with forests is how full of flammable material they are.  It wouldn't do for us to smash the enemy only for fire to kill all our civvies and cits.”

“Can you at least get them to stop lighting things on fire?  I need to sketch out a plan and do a little math.""

“Hunker down,” he assured her, “I'll get with our scouts.”

“Aye sir.”

That sorted, Lieutenant George sprinted toward the quintet of armored vehicles as he snapped, “Gold Three, Orange Three!  I need grenade holes poked in those APCs!”

“Ah fuck!” PFC Kim started before he growled in more normal tones, “Don't sneak up on a guy like that, sir.”

“I didn't sneak up,” Lieutenant George said evenly, “and if I don't have my holes poked I'll make you do my job instead.”

“No sir,” PFC Kim answered emphatically, as he and PFC Reyes took shots that ripped holes in the vehicles where the armor was thinnest, but they'd have minimal chances of inflicting casualties on the driver crew, or on the passenger cabin.  However, Lieutenant George sprinted into their formation at a tidy seventy miles an hour, and sent small grenades rattling into the holes with deft flicks of his wrists.  He didn't know whether the mind controlling the victim even noticed the little deadly balls before they ripped said victims asunder with fire and shrapnel.  Smoke billowed from all three APCs, and one of them careened off of the dirt road until it smashed into a large, mossy boulder where it smoldered sullenly.

“Actual, how are we doing on that counter burn?” Lieutenant asked over the private channel to his platoon sergeant.

“There's a cliff face I can blow to smother the leading edge, but if you want me to go for full containment with what I have on me,  I won't have what I need for Site A.”

“Then go ahead and buy a little time for local fire services to scramble,"" Lieutenant George confirmed before final check-ins started rolling in.

“Beta Squad, boots down and accounted for.  All systems go, moving on objective.”

“Alpha squad, boots down and accounted for.  All systems go, light contact,” Sergeant Ivanov reported shortly after his comrade's final syllable.  “Moving up.”

“Delta squad, in position,” Sergeant Antonio said calmly, “I've collected my scout and he's assumed overwatch.  We have your backs, gentlemen.”

“Aye Delta Leader,” Lieutenant George said, “Technical is playing firefighter.  Check in and see if she wants playmates.”

“Aye, sir,” the large man said smoothly, and Lieutenant George cantered to a stop and took stock.  He had one squad moving forward with no resistance, one with light resistance, the explosives load-out he was counting on had just taken a significant dent, and he found himself looking at the festering collection of invasive structures through his helmet's faceplate.  

Realizing his position, he keyed to his platoon-wide channel and said, “Lost Boys Actual in position.  No change in plans, good work so far, but keep your heads up and your boots down.”   The men didn't waste time verbally acknowledging him.  They knew he didn't need it, just like they knew he didn't necessarily need to tell them that he had his eye on them.  They liked to know anyway.  Then, he keyed to reach the *Mister Smee* again and reported, “This is Lost Boys Actual.  Platoon boots down and hot.  Moving on Site A now.  Be advised, enemy  action has started forest fire, mitigation efforts underway.”

“We read you, Lost Boys Actual.  Be advised, void superiority achieved.  The skies are yours, boys.”

“Good news, *Mister Smee.*  Next check-in on completion or schedule.  Whichever's first.”

“Aye Lieutenant.  Keep your head up and boots down, dirtpounder.”

“Keep the air in and the coffee hot up there.  Lost Boys Actual, out.”

A stream of Axxaak enslaved by the pulsating Grubs attached at the base of their skulls, their tears of blood hidden by their scarlet skin, poured from one of the squat, bulbous structures.  They were lightly armored; it was probably enough to stop the sporting arms the locals had been using.  Then again, there was elk in the area, so maybe not.  Another wrinkle, frontier worlds tended to have a good few veterans, and Lieutenant George had a hard time imagining retiring without buying his service equipment to take with him into life after service.  Lieutenant George pushed such pleasant musings out of his mind, leveled his assault rifle, set it to three round burst, and started killing.  The rifle's magnetic coils hummed to life, its feed mechanism made the distinctive click-clack of shaving the correct amount and shape of ferrous material from the ammo block in its well, and the rounds made a *CRACK-CRACK-CRACK* as they broke the sound barrier on their way out of the barrel.  Two hundred seventy yards away, blood sprayed in the air as the three rounds tore flesh from the victim as easily as it tore holes in the armor its masters had depended on.  There was a series of sharp booms, like compressed, singular peels of thunder, followed by a deep rumbling, and he knew that there should at least be some time for the locals to get the fire contained.  Better, they wouldn't have to worry about these things while they did it.  Lieutenant George strode forward and killed again, his rifle bucked in his hands, thudded against his shoulder, but he hardly felt either through his power armor.  The Axxaakk weren't like the Terran races, they didn't have much biological resistance to domination, and it was a queasy fact that the Controllers bred people like animals on vast farms to infect with their puppeting parasites.  It was because the Terran races had such strong natural resistance to telepathic contact that the nations of the stars knew an important fact: to be infected was to be in torment.  Lieutenant George's face was contorted in a furious snarl as he strode forward and killed again.  Forward, forward, forward he moved and he killed, killed, killed every step of the way, and he was far from alone in it.

Alpha Squad was nearly among the buildings, and in their wake was a haphazard spattering of scarlet corpses, indicating that the enemy hadn't the time to organize resistance on that flank.  Meanwhile, Beta Squad circled wide as they fired into a massed formation of victims, sending blood and flesh spraying into the air like a gruesome fireworks show even as the Grub victims feebly failed to properly lead their shots.  Among them, some victims were assembling some crew-served heavy weapons with built-in cover.  They looked like laser arrays, but what they were didn't matter because before they could get their power sources hooked in, turf and soil joined the blood and flesh in the air, as Delta Squad employed their Man Portable Howitzer Class Railguns to simply remove them from the equation.

Lieutenant George's HUD suddenly lit up with a warning, and he instinctively fell to his knees to slide along the rocky ground beneath a tight beam that had suddenly flashed to life a foot to his left, and would have swept across his chest.  His hand left his weapon's trigger well, dipped to his belt, and a grenade was sailing through the air nearly too fast for organic eyes to track.  It hit where he was aiming, into the viewing slit of a hidden laser array near the roof of one of the outlying structures.  There was a firey flash, and black smoke billowed from the slits in the position.  Hot plasma splashed against his battlescreens, and he raised his weapon and pulled the trigger again almost before he thought about it.  The first building was only ten feet away.

Some malevolent mind had finally figured out that this wasn't another harassing raid by the local militia, and began getting serious.  There was a roaring buzzing sound, like a thousand furious wasp hives all kicked at once, and countless little drones spilled out of openings in the taller of the three buildings on the compound's outskirts.  Without delay, they peeled off into two large groups, and a smaller one.  Sergeant Drilldrai paused in her calculations and said, “Delta Leader, see what you can do to keep those camakazi bots off of Alpha and Beta squads.”

“Does that mean you'll handle the clump headed for Actual?”

“Aye.”

“Copy that,” Sergeant Antonio chimed, “have fun skeet shooting.”

“Don't be jelous, you get to play with the big gun,” she said as she angled toward Lieutenant George.  He'd gone charging in again, heedless of his back.  Fools would call it reckless.  Sergeant Drilldrai knew what it really was, and tried to live up to it.  She snaked her lower right arm around her back and drew her secondary weapon, an AA shotgun.  She kept her primary rifle in her upper hands, and switched it to full auto to lay down some covering fire as she slammed a drum magazine into the shotgun's well with a harsh *kur-chunk!*  Then, she deftly swapped her rifle for the shotgun in her upper hands and vice-versa in her lower hands and started sending slugs whizzing into the midst of the drone cloud closing in on Lieutenant Geroge's back.  The slugs exploded with littl pops once their proximity fuses were triggered, and by the time the AA shotgun was dry, the cloud of menace had been reduced to so much useless scraps of plastic on the ground.  

Lieutenant George's back was already being swallowed by the shadow of the doorway of the first structure, flack started ripping the drone swarms apart as quickly as they could stream out of their nests, and Sergeant Drilldrai never even thought of hesitating.  She merely blinked on her infared display and reloaded the AA shotgun. 

“Progress,” she snapped as she stitched a line of bullets across a collection of bright white humanoid heat sources to her left with her primary, and put three proximity fused slugs through the cool gray of a doorway with the shotgun.

Sergeant  Ivanov gruffly reported, “Whittling down their infantry.  They weren't ready for a real fight.”

“I agree,” Sergeant Perez mused, “Found some Controllers, and the uh... breeding facilities.”

“You got a structure scan running on your camera?” Sergeant Drilldrdai asked.

“Better, I have the whole squad looking at anything that seems to be holding things up with those scans running.”

“Toss me the file when it's compiled.  Actual, what were we up to?""

“Command and control disruption,” Lieutenant George answered tersely, and there was the sound of metal boots charging across the floor, and a wet thud followed by a sickeningly crunchy splattering sound.

“Huh,” Sergeant Antonio mused, “Technical, around a third of the infantry just dropped to the ground.  Looks like the local commander liked to take a personal hand, um, brain to the fighting.”

“Aye, focus on the ones still shooting at you, gentlemen.  We can end those poor people's suffering cleanly when there isn't anything trying to kill us.”

There was another wet impact followed by yet another sickeningly crunching splatter, and Sergeant Ivanov cursed, “Sweaty balls!  There's maybe twenty left that I can see still standing!”

“These *things* are sadistic,” Lieutenant George snarled, “they like killing our civvies.  They like to *feel* the despair of their slaves when they do it.  They like to have more victims than the other Controllers under them.  When I squish the last one, I wouldn't be shocked if there's less than a dozen victims left standing.”

In 1968 when Martin Luther King Jr. was killed he had a net worth of $6,000. MLK was an Activist who sought to improve the conditions of people's lives. MLK did not charge his supporters for the privilege to meet or march alongside him. There was not a VIP section on the Freedom bus one could pay to be upgraded to. MLK did not sell Hats, Shirts, Shoes, Watches, Coffee Cups, etc. MLK's object was not to build brand wealth and get wealthy. MLK wanted to help people.

Today it seems a lot of people get their concepts, ideas, beliefs, etc about society and the world from Podcasters, Youtubers, and Pundits. People who market themselves as thought provokers and truth tellers. They are Influencers. Folks like Ezra Klien, Ben Shapiro, Joe Rogan, Charlie Kirk, Megan Kelly, Sam Harris, Bill Maher, Candece Owens, Tucker Carlson, etc. They monetize their audience. To a person everyone named above is a multi-millionaire. They sell subscriptions, take corporate money to advertise products, charge audiences for live appearances, sell swag, etc. They speak philosophically about social and economic issues, but their goals are inherently selfish. They want individual success. They aren't actually trying to help others.

As Division grows across the United States. As Federal Agents stand off against protesters in Minneapolis, EU allies fret about the future, and as the newest generation of America fear for their futures we should all strive to stand with Activists.  Not be influenced by Influencers. Anyone who asks you to ""like, comment, and subscribe"" or tries to sell you their newest book is full of crap. They are grifters. Their words are tailored to make them money, not to help society. They aren't trying to educate or inform. They are curating an audience. ",3,1768833838.0,DeepThoughts,0,1.0,False

My husband drinks most nights and keep his drink in a specific container in a specific location. 

Unfortunately, I have horrible allergies and can’t smell anything the first few minutes I’m up. I went to take a chug out of my water bottle I left downstairs and after a few seconds I realized this wasn’t water, it was vodka. I had swallowed a few gulps but spat out the rest, I assume I had at least four shots worth. I tried but could not heave it up, so I doordashed a large coffee that never arrived. Thankfully, my second DoorDash was successful and I had a hot black coffee to sober up with at 7:45 almost two hours later. Needless to say no real studying was done, just the room spinning and my chugging water. When I went to log onto work my internet wouldn’t connect so I ended up getting onto work late. My husband has a job interview this morning that he was almost late to because he blacked out last night and slept in late. 

On his way out, I asked him why he filled my water bottle with vodka, and he simply did not know.

I just came back to Fallout 76 after almost **seven years away**, basically since that extremely buggy launch. I decided to give it another chance and started fresh with a brand‑new character—and honestly, I’m having a great time so far.  
But one thing really hit me as I was rebuilding my CAMP and making a cool little bar setup:

**Why can’t I serve or drink an ice‑cold beverage?**

We have working power, generators, robots, functioning brewing/fermenting systems, fridges as CAMP items, coffee machines… basically *everything* a wastelander could dream of. And yet somehow we’re stuck drinking **warm beer** in 2026 Appalachia?

Back in Fallout 4 we had the Drinkin’ Buddy chilling drinks. And lore‑wise, people get Power Armor, Protectrons, Mister Handy units, and even Liberty Prime back online…  
But refrigeration is where we draw the line? 😅

I’m not even asking for stat boosts.  
Just give us a simple **“Ice‑Cold” cosmetic variant** that looks frosty and maybe plays a refreshing sound. Purely for roleplay. That’s it.

Am I missing something?  
Did Bethesda ever comment on this?  
Would anyone else like to see proper cold drinks for their bars and restaurants?

Throwaway because some of them know my main. I (29F) have been with my partner (31M) for a little over 2 years, and overall he’s kind, supportive, and genuinely the person I want to build a life with. The issue is mostly social stuff. He’s extroverted and loves being the entertainer, and I’m more quiet, so I don’t mind him taking the spotlight. But lately he’s started using me as material. It’s not cruel on purpose, it’s more like he thinks any awkward moment is fair game if it gets a laugh. I’ve told him a couple times I don’t like being the punchline and he always says he’s ""just teasing"" and that everyone does it. Then he’ll be sweet for a day or two and I start thinking ok, it’s fine, maybe I was too sensitive.



Last weekend we were at his friend’s place and someone asked how our trip went (we went for 3 days to a nearby city). Before I could even answer, he jumps in and tells the story about me getting overwhelmed at the train station, crying a bit, and accidentally dropping my coffee all over my shoes. People laughed and one of his friends goes ""awww she’s a stressy lil thing"" which made my face burn. I know it sounds small but it felt humiliating because it was a moment I was not proud of, and I told him about it later that night. He apologized, said he didn’t realize it would bother me that much, and promised to be more mindful. Then yesterday he was on the phone with the same friend and I hear him start telling another story about me ""rage whispering"" at a self checkout because it kept beeping. Again, harmless, but its MY embarrassing moments being shared like a highlight reel.



Now he wants me to go to a get together this weekend and I honestly don’t want to. I feel like I’m walking in already bracing myself for the next joke. He says I’m overreacting and punishing him for being social, and that if I skip it everyone will think I hate them. I’m not trying to control him, I just want basic respect. Am I overreacting for saying I’m done hanging out with his friends until he can stop doing this?

January snow smothered everything in shades of gray, and the locals measured each day by what still worked rather than what was lost.

At the old Harvest Moon Diner, the morning crowd huddled in booths under the fading amber light. 

Grease popped on the griddle, coffee steamed in chipped mugs, and everyone pretended they didn’t notice the flicker in the fluorescent bulbs that had started about a week ago: rhythmic, almost pulse-like.Eli Ronsem sat near the window, notebook open beside a pile of unpaid bills. 

Once a geology student at U of M-Flint, now a part-time delivery driver, he spent his mornings tracing old fault lines on maps for no real reason other than habit. 

The earth beneath Hollow Creek was supposed to be stable—yet lately, his house had begun to groan at night, a low steady sound that seemed too regular to be wind.

“Hey, Eli,” called Marta, the waitress with the short pink hair and permanent cigarette rasp. “You want the usual?”

He nodded absently, eyes fixed on the muted TV above the counter. The local news had cut to live footage—a massive scaffolded depression under floodlights, crawling with scientists and drones. The caption read: GLOBAL TEAM TO DESCEND INTO ICELANDIC SUBTERRANEAN ANOMALY.

Marta turned the volume up.

“…the ongoing international expedition led by Dr. Mara Ivers is preparing to explore what experts are calling a ‘geological impossibility.’ The structure—found beneath the Thagvellir Valley—appears to extend more than twenty miles into the earth, with surfaces exhibiting signs of organic composition…”

A close-up flashed on-screen: the sinkhole glowing faintly in the polar twilight. Eli swallowed hard. 

For a moment, the image flickered, and he thought he saw movement—something coiling behind the floodlights, like an enormous muscle tensing.

“Creepy,” Marta muttered. “You think it’s aliens?”

“Could be,” said Harold, the retired lineman at the bar. “Government probably dug it years ago. Now they’re just pretending to ‘discover’ it.”

Eli didn’t answer. He kept staring at the screen. A strange metallic hum began to pulse through the diner’s speakers—the kind of interference that happens when a TV station loses frequency—but when Marta hit the remote, the sound didn’t stop. It came from beneath the floor, low and steady.

Outside, snow was falling again, thick enough to smother sound. A delivery truck’s tires squealed on black ice and then stopped abruptly, the driver climbing out to stare at the ground. 

The snow had begun to crack, dropping thin white fractures across the parking lot in circular patterns.On the TV, the reporter’s voice wavered, distorted by static:
“…geologists believe the structure may be linked to a global network of tunnels. Infrared data shows possible expansion—extensions forming in regions beneath North America…”

Eli’s pen rolled off the table. He bent to retrieve it just as the diner’s lights dimmed again, all at once—and for the brief instant before they brightened, everyone heard it: a distant, resonant thump, deep and physical, echoing through the frozen ground.

Harold crossed himself. “Jesus, what the hell was that?”

Marta forced a laugh. “Frozen pipes. Has to be.”

But Eli knew better. The rhythm matched footage from Thagvellir. Twelve seconds apart.

A heartbeat.

Later that night, alone in his small rental house near the abandoned quarry, Eli watched the newscast replay online. As the feed looped through the camera pan over the Icelandic sinkhole, he swore the frame stuttered just enough that something flickered inside the pit: not movement, but awareness.He shut the laptop—and underneath the floorboards, something knocked back, twelve seconds later.",2,1768833166.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

The adaptation was much better than I expected, I was able to fall asleep and sleep the whole night from the first day, without taking off the mask. (Even though I had to fight a lot with a constant desire to take deep breaths through my mouth while falling asleep). 

  
After the week of trial, the clinic started the process to get me a machine, which will take \~6 weeks... 

It's been 3 nights since I'm without CPAP and I really felt it, specially in the mornings, with needing more time to sleep, taking a long time to get up, immediate cravings for coffee, etc..

I've reached out to the clinic asking to rent a machine, but they don't provide that... So pretty much I would welcome tips on how to manage this 6 weeks and also some questions: 

\- I wanted to keep this in check and I was looking into buying something like the O2ring (chatgpt suggested, dunno if there's smth better / cheaper) or even upgrade my old Apple Watch (mine doesn't have oxygen sensor or ECG). I know the Apple Watch is much more expensive (and not a medical equipment) but I already use it everyday and I'm due to an upgrade, just wondering how much less reliable is from the O2ring. Any thoughts/suggestions? (can be other smartwach or device btw)

\- Since I've knew about this, I've been sleeping with more pillows to be higher, I quitted alcohol even before knowing (Dry January) and I've been more consistent with my time to go to bed. Any suggestions, in terms of habits to improve, that worked out for you guys? (I'm still missing one big thing which is smoking, but I'm reducing and want to cut it off completly in feb). 

\- I've been using the native sleep app of iOS and my Apple Watch during sleeping (I didn't used it before) to get a sense of how my sleep went, do you recommend any other app or this one is enough?

I created a new VM with a new network adapter, but by accident, I started the new VM when the old one was active. It caused an error, and now HA won’t boot. I’m now in recovery mode. I’ve tried Slots A and B, but both say “Fail to start containerd container runtime.”

Unfortunately, I overlooked snapshots for this volume, and the backups I have are several months old (I know, terrible backup processes I need to learn from).

Can anyone help? What additional info can I provide? When I use the journalctl -xb command, the logs are 5000 lines, so I don’t want to screenshot all of that. Genuinely willing to buy you a coffee (or 10) or something if anyone's able to help me restore the instance and help me get a backup extracted.",1,1768832894.0,homeassistant,2,1.0,False
