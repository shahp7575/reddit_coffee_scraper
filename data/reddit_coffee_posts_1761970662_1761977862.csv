I stretch the shard of truth that lay in the hallway, thinning it, and fall asleep on her lap.
The beginning of memory is a great refusal. The egg tart hurled from the fifth floor.
You slump, smelling like an infant’s head, then stand. “Even so, I’m happy,” you said.

Mother’s handmade butter sandwiches rot, and Father goes to his lover. Beginnings are never fun.
Brown eyes search the ceiling, a glimmer leaks from the ribs like stars.

On the right arm of a woman I met at the bar I frequent, a skull and the Roman numeral III.
At dawn I recalled that the gap between what she and I saw would not be bridged.
She said she wanted a child. I said I did not.

When the heater shifts to fan, you stare into the fridge with dead eyes.
I look at the brown eyes.

Father’s lover faces me. Black eyes, short hair.
Mid‑thirties, long‑legged, slender; sloped shoulders; a hooded top suited her.
A ring on the left ring finger.
Large eyes, a straight nose, ears a little large; well‑formed, yet her face showed hardship, as if luck were thin.
I liked such women too, and felt my father’s blood.
Black eyes look back.

Streetlights in equal intervals. In the city’s center, new buildings keep growing.
I said it was wrong. I said it spins.
I knew it was a shallow lament.
I said it on your lap.

Back home, Mother cries before the kitchen. Father is likely out.
Even so, the floor is warm. From her saucered cups, Mocha coffee is served.
Even going the wrong way, some things do not change.

Tell me where I go from here.
“A job ends; what comes next?” a friend said.
He meant the work is thin, and he wants something.

“Did you ever cry your first cry.
Do you truly remember it.
Is this life one you built.”
With that face, Father’s lover’s black eyes look at me.

A cold gaze. An endless trip.
Human resignation turning and turning.
Answers that will not settle.
On your lap, I stopped my words.
The light did not go out.
The world has gaps.
Seeing the same thing does not promise the same response.
I could predict to a point,
yet it rarely went beyond it.

Today I will buy an egg tart, take it home,
put it in the refrigerator, open it in the morning.
Whose eyes will share it.

Time is tangled.
Like a room that holds to one temperature, I live a trivial time.

---


Commentary 

A refusal nails the opening, and a pastry becomes a hinge. The thrown tart fixes an arrow in time; sweetness shatters and will not be gathered. Brown eyes versus black eyes, want versus refusal, mother’s warm floor against a cold gaze in the fridge light. The skull and the Roman III tag the night with count and emblem, while evenly spaced lamps measure a city that keeps building. The lap is a short pier where speech moors and breaks. The house offers heat and Mocha, the world offers a gap that prediction rarely clears. Father’s lover returns the look, asking whether the first cry was ever ours and whether this life was built by our hand. Morning is drafted by a small act—placing a tart on a shelf. The question is not hunger but sight: which eyes will meet the sweetness. Light remains; agreement does not. Between constant temperature and tangled time, the future reduces to a hand on a door and the quiet of what we take or refuse.

It would be an absolute dream to be on a creep cast episode, please give any thoughts on part one of my story, I'm dyslexic and this was hard lol. 

( I would also like to say that this deals with death and has some real events of my life in this part) Thank you! 

Part 1:

 From when I was younger,

I could always remember being afraid of monsters, big and hairy, razor sharp teeth, and claws. But monsters are not real. 



I am a Police Officer in my hometown on the coast in New Jersey. Before you ask this was not my aspired profession. After high school my best friend Hannah Murphy and I were accepted into Michigan State. Her parents Melissa Murphy and Gary Murphy owned a small restaurant called Ocean View Cafe known for their burgers across the country. Hannah’s brother Jacob Murphy is four years older than us and has already graduated from college one year into my studies. My parents Jennifer Campbell and Morgan Campbell are both in the business of money. They met in college and my Mother became an accountant and my Father owns a little tax advisory shop in our town. They both grew up here and since my mom’s job is remote, she chose to settle down close to family and have me, Aria Campbell. My parents met the Murphy’s when I started daycare with Hannah, “friends for life” they’d say watching us eat our playdough creations together through the playroom window. 



My original aspiration was to major in Biomedical Engineering, Hannah was majoring in Pharmacology. I was always known for being gifted in the math department, and as a broke college student I am justified in my college business. What business you ask, doing classmates math homework for cash. In the month leading to spring exams I made $567.10, and got invited to every party. Turns out people like you more as a nerd in college. All I can remember from that time was a mix of studying and drinking until I’m sure I was on the cusp of liver failure when I received the call. The call that my Grandpa had committed suicide. 



George Baker was Chief of Police in my town, he was known as a loveable kind man to everyone. I remember thinking the call was fake. “Mom, I can’t hear you” I say in an obviously joyous tone as the man known as ‘Bear’ in my class was dancing around handing out some sort of jungle juice.

“It’s Grandpa” my mom said in a defeated tone.

“What? Hang on let me go outside” I pushed through other classmates to the door.

I remember the outside crisp air hitting my sweaty skin and I immediately had goosebumps over my entire body. “Okay I can hear you now, what’d you say mom?”

I heard muffled crying over the line “Grandpa’s dead”

  


The next few months were a blur. I can’t explain the overwhelming guilt I felt, partying while, my family was falling apart. I flew home two days after the news and felt a coldness in the cab entering my town, then the anxiety pulling into my neighborhood. Taking my bags out of the trunk I felt an immense heaviness settle upon me. Walking up the walkway to my childhood home I felt my ears begin to ring. A place that should be filled with such happy memories and fondness now feels like a darkness, an impossibility. My eyes sting as I turn the knob. The first person I see is my dad, he’s wearing a whitish grey T-shirt with black dress pants, I can see the sadness emanating from him. His thick eye-brows curved and held out his arms weakly for an embrace.

“You’re Mom’s upstairs” he said his chin resting on the top of my head. “She isn’t doing well”. 



It makes sense seeing as now she’s lost both her parents now, she was always a daddy’s girl. After awhile of sitting in the early quite living room with Dad I heard small foot steps making there way toward the hallway upstairs. When my Mom came into view I could tell she had been crying, It looked as though she hadn’t stopped seeing as her makeup was running. She wore a long velvety black dress, it’s what I imagine a witch to wear based off every basic iteration. She looked small and defeated. My dad stood and I knew that was the sign we were leaving.



 The funeral was held in the center of town at the big old church. My Grandpa was of faith so it felt right for his send off to be where he attends every Sunday. Walking in smelling the faded incenses and the grim lighting is when I broke. My Grandfather, the man who carried me on his shoulders, who promised to protect me from all evils, who cried the hardest at my leaving, is dead. Worse he killed himself, why? Why didn’t he talk to me? Why didn’t he tell me or anyone for that matter what he was dealing with? Being a Vietnam veteran and on the force for that long I know he saw it all, I know he lost his faith in humanity. When his Wife died of Pancreatic cancer he held it all together for Mom and vowed to live in every moment with his family. I just can’t comprehend that he’d do this. That the last time I saw him was Christmas, when he wore a Santa hat and smiled the most out of anyone handing out presents, when I told him I couldn’t afford a good gift while working my part time job at a coffee shop and got him a small pine candle to stand in until his summer birthday. Even so he cherished the gift, like the answer to all things wrong in this world. All I feel is guilt.



As the funeral progressed a priest read about how good of a man my Grandpa was, all I can look at is the casket. Sitting in the front row of the pews, it was in direct eyeline. Every time I looked all I felt was an overwhelming heaviness and stinging in my eyes. Once the reading ended we were offered an invitation to speak, many locals from town and Police Officers did. They told the funny stories of my Grandpa on the force and how kind and charitable he was. When we stood up I saw them Mr. and Mrs. Murphy, I ran to them in tears down the aisle and embarrassed my second mother in a tight hug.



“Oh honey. I am so so sorry for this loss. We haven’t stopped praying for him and your family since” she paused pulling me out of the hug gently. “ We invited everyone here to the restaurant after for the wake, your Grandfather loved our food and it felt right to donate our place to his favorite people in his honor”. 



She smiled at me, and I felt slightly better. Mrs. Murphy has always been a kind hearted women, she used to host weekly sleepovers for me and Hannah, she even picked me up from school when I started my period in 6th grade.



We all followed the police escorted hearse to the cemetery, since my Grandpa was Chief of police he had a beautiful private plot in an exclusive area. The cemetery was on a hill, the winding roads forming a knot in my stomach. ‘ It’s really real’. My uncle and a few cousins carried his casket out to the plot from the hearse when I heard a comment from my cousin Zachary, “ wow this is really light”. Was Grandpa not taking care of himself towards the end? It felt like I was hit by a truck. I watched as the box was lowed into the dry dirt and threw a rose into the pit along with other family. If you were wondering why I didn’t say how he looked lying there in a faux comfy bed, I don’t know it was a closed casket due to the nature of his death. Gun shot to the head.



The wake was lively, people laughing, eating, drinking cheap beers. I sat at the counter seat in the Ocean View Cafe. The restaurant is small with a multitude of 4 seater booths in an array of black cushions with small homely tears. Across a small walkway was the counter top, they have an L shaped counter with a high top then dipping into a low top towards the register. With soft tiled floor that definitely used to be white, and a small widow about 5 feet up with a heat lamp inside. Through the small window I can see Mr. Murphy near the grill, his half head of grey hair bobbing in and out of view. He had a soft look similar to his wife, he always sported a half hazard shaven face completed with small razor bumps. His gray shirt stained with grease like always, and it looks like he’s never replaced his apron, not once. I looked at the food on my plate, a simple slider and a few fries, but I can’t bring myself to eat. As I’ve mentioned Ocean View is known for their burgers, they’ve been in multiple articles and on the local news more times than I can count. They really are good it’s a shame I just can’t find my appetite.



“Want me to box that up for you Hun?” Mrs. Murphy said while a shy smile. She wore her dyed black hair to combat the incoming grey in a messy bun now. She had a black turtle neck sweater tucked into a black satin skirt. 



“ No Ma’am, I just can’t bring myself to eat right now.” she looked understanding but I couldn’t help feel rude.



That's when I felt a hand on my shoulder, “ Hey Aria, right?” It was Officer Cullen. He was semi-new to the force and a trainee of my Grandpa’s. 



I gave a slight nod, he continued “ Your Grandpa always talked about you, he said he always thought you’d take after him and join the force” he wore more of a smile now.



“ I never gave it any thought” I said honestly. Why would Grandpa want me to join something that could’ve lead to his own gruesome fate.



He looked at me in an inquisitive manner for what felt like an eternity and then chose to sit next to me, “ let me buy you a drink” he was now smiling and flagging down Mrs. Murphy. He ordered two beers and she gave me a questioning look and then decided to serve me regardless of the fact I am only 19, probably due to the blank expression I wore along with the events of the day. Officer Cullen and I spoke for the rest of the wake, and I had my first beer.

What do you folks recommend? Specifically:

1. Good-value beans/daily brews that are smooth-ish (not too acidic / harsh), suitable for French press


2. Specialty coffees for an occasional cup which isn't too expensive, suitable for French press

1olgh11,https://www.reddit.com/r/manipaljaipur/comments/1olgh11/how_to_get_placed/,How to get placed?,"The only reason I’m posting this is because I came across this misguiding Reddit post (https://www.reddit.com/r/manipaljaipur/s/Ul1v90JBtz). This post is missing the actual OG resources like The Odin Project and Andrej Karpathy. Instead, it’s filled with random YouTube creators, most of whom have never worked as real engineers at any major product company.

Some final year student wrote about ‘grinding for four years’ to land a 6.5 LPA job. Not his / her fault, they’re just freshers.

I’ve been in the industry for 10+ years across engineering, product, and revenue roles at top startups like Postman, Atlan, DevRev, and Supabase. I’ve consistently earned 1 Cr+ for the past several years.

So here’s a more realistic roadmap to landing a significantly higher-paying role - in months, not years (3–6 months if you do it right).

You do not need to follow all the noise and you should definitely stay away from Indian YouTube tech creators. Do this instead.

1. Create a solid LinkedIn profile.

2.Find people who are already doing your dream job in your dream companies and send them connection requests.

3. Once they accept, send a short cold message asking for a 30 mins conversation. Usually one out of ten will agree.

4. Appreciate their career growth and let them know you want to learn from them as you are trying to break into the industry.

5. On the call, be fully transparent about where you stand. Ask them to walk you through their typical day which includes reading legacy code, understanding systems, infra work, design meetings, planning and everything else. Take it slow and absorb the details. Offer them coffee/lunch/pizza in exchange for their time.

6. After the call, reverse engineer their role and start learning those exact skills. Follow up biweekly with them.

7. Once you feel ready which usually takes 3-6 months, start reaching out to founders in seed and Series A startups.

8. One complete enterprise level end to end project is enough to get interviews. Usually ten reachouts result in one interview.

9. Your first few interviews may not go well which is perfectly normal. By the time you finish around 10 interviews, you will land a strong offer.

This is how you get into good product startups.

Hi! Reposting this since I've yet to find someone 🥴

Dating apps haven't been a great experience lately, so I figured I could shoot my shot here (again).

I'm a 25 year old musician who loves video games just as much as all things music. So much so, I've got a day job as a Play Tester. 

Someone told me to date a best friend, so here I am looking for someone to make great friends with. I'm looking for someone I can share my days with, someone I can spend my free time with. Me-time is great and all, but to commit my time for someone else gives that sense of fulfillment I'm looking for in life. To be vulnerable with someone is a feeling worth searching for.

Today, I was walking around downtown in my hot dog costume, handing out candy. I deliver food to just about every building in San Francisco. Rich young guys. Poor old ladies. Pre kindergarten classes. Oh you should have seen the looks on those baby faces when I ran up on them at Mission and New Montgomery. Tikes. Holdings parents hands. I say, can I give your kids some candy and these baskets the size of coffee mugs get swung around these toddler arms. I tell you guys, I deliver downtown. I filled those bags. Security at fancy buildings laughing about a hot dog costume I got on. Serious faces breaking down. Cops. Staring me down. The high guard. They gotta act like they’re above the influence. Meanwhile, a fire truck in mission bay rings bells for me. Chanting hot dog. I guess it’s different when you’re with the boys. The day wears on. I hand out candy to a few customers who order Uber Eats. Toss some candy to Instacart customers. A young lady planning a dinner for her friends, stressed out about it, hands me 10$ cash because I put her at ease with a smooth delivery. Making my way downtown. I decide it’s time to cross neighborhoods. Take in the air. I go see the other side. Old ladies in the grocery store tell me they’re just kids. I give them candy. Panhandlers get candy. Street musicians. Bag boys telling me hot dog jokes. Candy. Heck. I make my way down the escalator out of Embarcadero to tons of people in costumes. I say candy. Hands out as I make my way down and they come up. It’s been a long day. The bag of candy sits at 20%. I get to west Oakland. Costumes. I offer candy. Young women are fearful. Only one guy, with his girlfriend, accepts 1 piece. He’s serving as the defacto west Oakland poison tester. I board my e bike and ride to a liquor store. Ya’ll kids weak. I know toddlers in Soma braver than you. I pull up to my favorite liquor store in west Oakland. Friday night. Obviously a crowd. I’m dressed as a hot dog. Obviously, I’m getting grilled the moment I pull up, but I got a big bag of candy. Bro, unc ain’t shy like the girlies in west Oakland. He grabs a fist full. Then a couple guys. Handfuls. See, the folks in the city, even my friends in SF would be like “why are you giving me so much just like one piece bro.” Nah, that bag was down to 10 pieces by the time I left the liquor store. Your grandma be sticking her fist in the bag talking asking me for “just one more.” I rode out of that liqueur store on my e bike. The guys were curious about the thing parked outside, but it was clear the candy man rode in on that and he deserved to ride out on it on account of being such a lick. Especially for a hot dog. I made my way home through downtown Oakland. A young couple remarked on the costume. I gave them the last of my candy. I got home and went to the bowl of candy I put out in my building for everyone. Only 1/4 empty. Man, I don’t know how people experience Halloween in urban environments. I’m from the suburbs of the suburbs. Man I’m from HOLLISTER. We can’t decide if we’re South Bay or Monterey Bay, but in my city you scare kids with elaborate lawn performances and hand out candy. I guess I got to do a little bit of that myself as a friendly guy handing out candy in the city. The kind of stuff your parents warn you about and the kind of stuff the Bay Area is built on. From the rich folks walking their dogs out of the high rises of SF, to the folks hanging out outside of the corner stores trying to come up on something, I gotta say, I had a good night.

1olfvkh,https://i.redd.it/bewgm9blykyf1.jpeg,"""O mesmo assunto dito denovo""","Uma coisa que me veio após ver um vídeo de uma pessoa se assumindo como uma garota trans, e que me incomodou sem que eu saiba bem o porquê, foi o fato de ela ter se afirmado como trans. Isso me gerou um estranhamento, pois a voz não combinava com o que ela dizia, apesar de eu achar o avatar do canal dela uma fofura. Ao mesmo tempo, me veio à mente o pensamento de que talvez o transexualismo não esteja sendo tratado com a seriedade que de fato deveria ter. É uma escolha séria e com consequências, sejam elas quais forem.


Não gosto de ideologia nenhuma. Posso até parecer do lado B para alguns, pois não creio em pronomes neutros nem nada do lado A, mas também sinto incômodo com a falta de empatia que muitos conservafroxos demonstram com pessoas trans. Como já vi aqui, muitas delas vêm de lares cristãos e acabam escondendo quem realmente são. Por isso, acredito que ser trans não deveria estar dentro dessas guerras ideológicas e culturais, porque isso envolve o eu existente e não um lado político.

Outra coisa é que eu sei o que é ter disforia, não se sentir bem no próprio corpo. Eu passei por isso durante uma fase da minha vida e entendo, na pele, o quanto isso é real. Dói saber que outras pessoas passam por isso, enquanto a família provavelmente odeia essas pessoas ao ponto de espumar pela boca.

Acompanho esse subreddit há alguns meses e já vi muitas situações parecidas com esse exemplo que dei. Por isso, não gosto de ver o tema trans sendo associado a ideologias, porque para mim é algo muito mais íntimo e profundo, algo inerente a si mesmo. Ainda assim, não deixei de sentir algo estranho vendo aquele vídeo, por mais tolo que seja esse sentimento.

Nunca vi ou conheci uma pessoa trans pessoalmente. Meu único contato foi através de conteúdo 2D, e eu nem preciso dizer o que é.

Não gosto da ideia de ter relacionamento ou de casar hoje em dia, e isso não tem a ver com essas questões de gênero. Envolve algo que provavelmente alguns aqui não concordam ""o medo de falsas acusações de estupro"" creio que é algo que existe e que afeta muito mulheres que sofrem de verdade com situações de abuso doméstico e também o fato de eu ter aceitado que, no fundo, não era isso que eu queria de verdade. Aceito que prefiro morrer sozinho e não quero que entendam que sou apenas um fetichista que teve uma fase de identidade alterada pelo NSFW.

Agora que tenho uma certa ""liberdade financeira"", acredito que quero ser eu mesmo. Mas não tenho coragem o suficiente para ser mulher, não do jeito que eu gostaria. Quero apenas ter uma aparência andrógina, algo que me agrade, mesmo que seja feminino do jeito que acho agradável. O masculino no meu corpo mesmo depois do meu eu de 12-13 anos me incomoda e me traz um sentimento de aversão mas como sentimento de não aceitar a si mesmo, embora algumas coisas que consumi me façam ver que o masculino também pode ter seu lado bom.

Um exemplo é JoJo, o anime e mangá que moldou muito do meu olhar para a arte e me fez enxergar a masculinidade com olhos mais positivos.

E sobre a parte da feminidade acho que tentar ter uma voz feminina como vi algumas aqui modulando a própria e alguns outros vídeos de vr chat de meme  me fez ter interesse em querer performar como uma garota em uma dublagem me até por que não se tem ""homens dublando mulheres"" mesmo que seja possível ter um tom de voz feminino modulando a voz.

Mesmo assim, ainda penso em tomar hormônios e ir atrás disso, mesmo sem querer ser mulher ou me vestir como uma. Já considerei o crossdresser, mas não gosto da ideia, usar roupas femininas parece algo desconexo para mim. Só que ainda existe o medo, medo dos sintomas ruins que o uso desses medicamentos podem causar em mim, medo dessa busca pela minha identidade acabar me levando à morte. E o que faria eu se meus pais  descobrissem

Esses dias, falei comigo mesmo achando que estava resolvido ""acho que prefiro aceitar só existir por existir e ignorar esse conflito, pois não sou masculino nem feminino."" Mas esse assunto voltou à minha cabeça depois de jogar um jogo chamado CoffeeBuns, histórias sobre personagens que mudam de gênero sempre me chamaram atenção.

**Show Notes:**  
  
This show was part of the three-show [ Festival 8 ](<http://www.phish.com/festival8>) . The first set, which started at noon, was billed as Phish's ""first full-length acoustic set"" (complete with complimentary coffee and Festival 8 themed donuts). The first set featured Trey and Mike on acoustics, Page solely on piano, and a unique stage setup that had Fish stage right with Page on the far left. Before Brian and Robert, Trey encouraged the crowd to sit down due to the ""mellow"" nature of the set; he added that they had never before played to a crowd that was sitting. Whether the crowd should stand up or sit down became a running joke throughout the set, until Trey confessed during Wilson that he only asked the crowd to sit down at the request of the crew and, in fact, he hates telling people what to do (and also hates sitting down). This show marked the Phish debuts of Invisible and Sleep Again. Fish performed a whistle solo on My Sweet One. The band briefly left the stage after McGrupp, returning to encore with Driver, Talk, and Secret Smile. The second and third sets were played later that evening. Reba lacked the whistling ending. Trey took a moment before Tweeprise to thank those who helped put on the festival.

**Show Notes:**  
  
Divided Sky was dedicated to Sun Ra. 'A' Train contained Dixie teases from Trey.
Tweezer included Wait quotes from Trey. After Pusherman (Curtis Mayfield), Trey
explained that Hold Your Head Up became the Henrietta theme (prompting teases of
HYHU by Page and Mike) because Fish hates that song more than any song ever
written except La Bamba (which was then also teased by Page and Mike); the
Pusherman theme was offered because Fish likes that song. Trey noted that Stash
was a request from some friends of theirs on the phish.net. Trey explained
phish.net and that the band was honoring requests.

1olfr3i,https://i.redd.it/rfm158uhokyf1.png,8 Level Ups on Second Dispatch.,"This is a follow up to my [9 Level Ups on First Dispatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/DispatchAdHoc/comments/1oftb2u/9_level_ups_on_first_dispatch/) post. Read that post first or this guide will not make much sense.

I want to start by saying that the second dispatch segment is VERY RNG heavy due to teaching the **Sabotage** mechanic. The way it works is that every character will try to sabotage every other character, unless they have synergy with that character or that character has already been sabotaged once. So if two characters have been individually sabotaged, they can be safely sent on a dispatch together and they will not sabotage each other.

Character synergies are as follows:  
Sonar, Malevola  
Flambae, Prism  
Invisigal, Golem  
PunchUp, Coupe

Sabotage solutions are as follows:  
Golem - Pry Loose  
Flambe - Blast it  
Coupe - Backstroke, or Evade if dog  
Sonar - Track down  
PunchUp - Force  
Invisigal - Ditch Him  
Prism - Distract  
Malevola - Fight. Must level up Combat or is guaranteed to be injured by every option.

If sent in synergy pairs, Sabotage will not occur on route to the dispatch, but may still occur on the return trip by a third character. THERE ARE NO AUTO RESOLVE OPTIONS IN THIS DISPATCH SEGMENT. Every single mission is a % success chance, that's it.

With that out of the way, I will present two options to run the second dispatch segment. The RNG heavy option to give everyone a level up, or the less RNG option that will level up everyone except Malevola and Coupe, they will both be 300 xp off from a level. This segment also requires creative use of game mechanics to make sure everyone can rest between missions.

***RNG Heavy option - 8 level ups***  
First, level up Sonars Vigor, PunchUps Mobility, Malevolas Combat, and Coupes Vigor. This is done to reduce the RNG you will be facing with this route, which basically requires winning 4 coin flips in a row. I got lucky with a random stat point and leveled up Malevolas intellect too to help.  
  
Open and close Beach Cleanup until you get PunchUp and Malevola in the two slots. Malevola must be the one that gets sabotaged, this will require restarts. The 4 coinflips in this mission that you must pass are:  
\-PunchUp saborages Malevola  
\-PunchUp solos the Beach Cleanup  
\-Malevola solos the Drug Bust  
\-Coupe solos the Tailgate

1.  Beach Cleanup - PunchUp, Malevola. DO NOT OPEN RESULT until everyone is rested.  
2.  Drug Bust- Malevola. DO NOT OPEN RESULT to prevent Drug Base from appearing.  
3.  Tailgate - Coupe. DO NOT OPEN RESULT to prevent Landslide from appearing.  
4.  SDN Scammer - Flambe, Prism. View result right away.  
Once everyone is rested, open results for Tailgate, followed by Drug Bust. This will cause Drug Base and Landslide to appear immediately. Dispatch teams at the same time to both.  
5.  Drug Base - Invisigal, Golem. Make sure Golem has normal stats or he will get injured if sabotaged on return trip.  
6.  Landslide - Sonar, Coupe. Triggers sabotage on Coupe, and injury on Coupe when she returns to base.  
7.  Mascot - Flambe, Prism  
8.  Investigate - Invisigal, Golem  
9.  Parking Lot - Coupe, PunchUp  
10. Runaway Train - Sonar, Malevola  
You shouldn't need coffee for anyone, but remember you have it if some timer messes up.

For those of you less insane than myself, here is a less RNG heavy option that relies on synergy pairs to avoid sabotage. Same rules apply for not viewing the results of Drug Bust and Tailgate to let everyone rest before Landslide and Drug Base are activated, so I am omitting those notes below.  
  
**Less RNG option - 6 level ups**  
Level up Sonars Vigor, and PunchUps Mobility, as they both have to solo a mission. You only need to make sure that PunchUp sabotages Malevola, and succeeds in Beach Cleanup. After that, you're basically guaranteed to clear the rest of the day.  
  
1.  Beach Cleanup - PunchUp, Malevola  
2.  Drug Bust- Sonar, Malevola  
3.  Tailgate - Coupe, PunchUp  
4.  SDN Scammer - Flambe, Prism  
5.  Drug Base - Invisigal, Golem  
6.  Landslide - Sonar, Coupe  
7.  Mascot - Flambe, Prism  
8.  Investigate - Invisigal, Golem  
9.  Parking Lot - Coupe, Malevola. Heals Coupe and reveals Malevolas power.  
10. Runaway Train - Sonar, PunchUp. On rare occasions they may still sabotage each other, but most of the time both of them end up sabotaged by this point and will be safe for this mission.",11,1761973942.0,DispatchAdHoc,0,1.0,False

I’ve been living in Louisville for about 5 years now, but it recently hit me that I’ve mostly stayed in my own little bubble — same routines, same places, not really exploring much outside of what’s familiar. I’m 23 and just graduated, and I’m trying to make a slow change in how I live. I want to get out more, meet new people, and feel more connected to the city instead of just going through the motions.

I’m not trying to force anything or suddenly become super social overnight, but I do want to start showing up more — whether that’s joining local events, community groups, rec sports, volunteering, or just checking out new spots around town like coffee shops, live music, or weekend markets.

If anyone here knows of good ways to meet people in their 20s or welcoming communities to join, I’d really appreciate the suggestions. Bonus points if it’s something chill or beginner-friendly — I’m just easing back into putting myself out there again.

Thanks in advance for any ideas or recommendations! Always open to hearing about fun things to do or low-key ways to meet good people in Louisville.",2,1761973482.0,Louisville,0,1.0,False

1olfk3v,https://acaia.co/products/umbra,"A minimalist, display-free industrial weighing scale","I picked up one of the new Acaia Umbra Lunar to replace a suddenly inoperable TimeMore Black Mirror Nano. I have no idea as to the reason for its demise.

I did a search of the web to figure out the current offerings for good quality espresso scales at an affordable price. Not much had changed so nice I last time around and nothing much changed. 

Then ran across tan overview of the 2025 SCA Expo this past April. One of the highlighted products was the Acaia Umbra Lunar. The most noticeable thing about the Umbra (other than significantly reduced price tag) it has no display. Instead it can pair via Bluetooth to a Acaia scale to utilize its display or you can connect to Apple or Android Acaia app.

After reading as much as I could find (which there isn’t a lot yet) I concluded that it’s an Acaia scale, so I ordered one. Except it isn’t on Amazon so you need to find a reputable espresso/coffee equipment vendor or go to Acadia direct. NOTE: it is not widely available.  It arrived at my doorstep on Oct 21. 

I have used it for 10 days and I have it paired to a new iPhone 17 after downloading the Acaia Brewmaster App.  it is easy-peasy to use.  

Every morning I use it to weight out a few single dose beans.  It is an easy transition  to an espresso shot timer to auto start weight and track the time duration  of the shot. 

My experience is the Bluetooth connection is stable with no lagging at all.  I find it fast and responsive.  It is one of the smallest espresso scales I have found.  It stands at just 15mm thick or just .59 inches or 19/32nds of an inch.  

The scale starts the timer almost immediately at .1 to .2 grams hits the bottom cup.  The scale talks to the Acaia app and the readout on  the app begins amazingly fast. It’s as fast and more consistent than my old TimeMore Black Mirror Nano.  Plus, the Acaia App  can do things the old scales can’t do by providing analytics.  It automatically  creates a graph of the time and flow. Plus, the data can be saved into an archive. 

The Umbra Lunar works very well, however, you need to be comfortable working with the app. If you are tech phobic your will probably not be comfortable with the Umbra. There is a status light on the Umbra unit and the color gives some basic info like it’s on.  I just tap where the light is located and the light activates and your u hear a beep. From that point on everything is done via the app. 

A few days isn’t a lot of time but it’s $35 over the current TimeMore Black Mirror Nano. It works!

NOTICE:
I have no affiliation with Acaia nor any other vendor selling the product.

I’ve always been told to buy in bulk. Everyone does and they are still broke.  I live for today, and found I waste things that I buy in bulk because the product either goes bad, gets wet, stale, moldy, and it just doesn’t work for me.  

I’ve stopped buying in bulk. I don’t have kids and never will and this may not work for large families. But for single individuals or couples, it might. 

I started buying the travel size head and shoulders for 1.50. It lasts the week. And a single bar of soap. Or two bars.  I  don’t buy paper towels, I use rags that I wash or throw away. I take old clothes that most would throwaway and I make rags that are washable or it is okay if i throw it out because it’s gross and I’ll make more.  I do still buy laundry detergents in larger quantities but I also use baking soda and it helps, but I buy a combo of different forms such as liquid, pods, and powder. I spend more on laundry detergents than anything and it still only 15 bucks every week and that includes dryer sheets and backing soda, gain pods and powder. 

So I live in the moment , and  I stopped worrying about the future. I’ve noticed it is getting harder to find small things and simple products. I don’t need a five gallon can of coffee ,  I just need  a small jar to get through the week. So, if I can only find gigantic packs of products, I go to look at another store. 

It works for me, it may not work for anyone else but if you are struggling , this may help you. ",7,1761972898.0,povertyfinance,4,0.82,False

I recently broke up with my ex after a **3-year relationship**. It was actually a *healthy breakup* — no drama or betrayal. We both agreed we needed time apart to focus on ourselves, and we even talked about possibly reconnecting in the future after some no contact. I genuinely thought she was my soulmate, so even though it ended respectfully, it’s been really hard.

Here’s where things get complicated. Her **guy best friend** is also a *mutual friend* of mine. He just got out of a **5-year relationship** himself — his ex cheated on him — so I tried to be understanding and supportive. But ever since my breakup, he and my ex have been **hanging out constantly**. They hang out every other day, texting and talking frequently, and share a level of emotional closeness that feels too intimate given the circumstances.

To be clear, I *know* their relationship is platonic — I don’t think they’re crossing physical boundaries. But the way they bond emotionally, support each other, and spend hours together feels off. They’ll go out for coffee or grab drinks for a few hours, and they’ve even gone out of town to go rock climbing together — even though my ex had previously told me she wouldn’t go out of town to hang out with him locally. Watching this happen makes me feel **replaced and disrespected**, especially because it feels like they’re ignoring how it affects me.

They both know how I feel. I told them that seeing them hang out and share that kind of connection makes it really hard for me to move on. They told me it’s **purely platonic** and that I’m overthinking it. But I asked him directly — if he were in my shoes, how would *he* feel? He admitted he wouldn’t like it either. That’s what hurts the most. He understands, yet still chooses to do it.

He even told me at one point that he’d stop hanging out with her for a bit out of respect. But later, he said he felt hurt that I didn’t check in on *him* after his breakup — and now it feels like he’s using that as a reason to keep spending time with her.

I’m not trying to control anyone or act possessive. I know they’re free to be friends. But it feels like there’s a lack of empathy and respect from both of them, especially considering how recent everything is and how open I’ve been about my feelings.

I’m torn. Part of me wants to confront them again, but another part of me feels like I should just distance myself from both and focus on healing. Has anyone been in a similar situation?

It’s this subreddit where people tell you to drive a shitbox, make coffee at home, and save save save on literally everything. I read it just to make myself feel better, because most of them live miserably. Then someone asked about the cost of raising a child because he was trying to make up his mind, and the majority were like, “You’ll lose a lot of money, but it’s worth it!” Someone said having kids is waaay better than having money, and others listed how expensive it is but still said it’s the best thing in the world.

Every year, coffee lovers flood Reddit’s r/Espresso and r/CoffeeDeals threads asking the same question: *Are Black Friday espresso machine deals actually worth it?* The answer in 2025: **yes - but only for verified listings.** Many “50 % off” tags are recycled from spring sales, while others hide older model numbers with fewer features.

Reddit’s caffeine-fueled community has filtered the hype, tracking genuine discounts, comparing pressure systems, and even posting brew tests. Below are **the most trusted espresso machine deals this Black Friday**, backed by real user reviews and consistent price history.

*Updated daily through Cyber Monday 2025 for freshness and authenticity.*

* [**PHILIPS 5500 Series Fully Automatic Espresso Machine**](https://www.pricedropdeals.com/2025/10/31/black-friday-espresso-machine-deals-2025/#strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-corsair-hs-65-surround-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong) **- 12 % Off**
   * The Philips 5500 is a Reddit-approved favorite for busy households wanting automatic excellence without complexity. With a 12-step grinder, LatteGo milk system, and one-touch cappuccino button, it’s built for effortless mornings. Redditors love its intuitive display and minimal maintenance - the LatteGo system cleans in under 15 seconds. Produces consistent crema on espresso shots. **Balanced Reality:** Slightly loud grinding cycle and limited cup clearance for tall mugs, but unbeatable for hands-off brewing at this price tier.
* [**CASABREWS Ultra Espresso Machine** ](https://www.pricedropdeals.com/2025/10/31/black-friday-espresso-machine-deals-2025/#strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-razer-black-shark-v-2-x-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong)**- 16 % Off**
   * CASABREWS rose fast on Reddit for its mix of affordability and genuine 20-bar pressure performance. Stainless-steel housing, dual temperature control, and a precise steam wand make it ideal for beginners learning latte art. The integrated pressure gauge helps perfect extraction. **Balanced Reality:** Manual frothing requires patience, and the drip tray is shallow - but espresso flavor rivals machines twice the cost.
* [**Philips Series 2300 Fully Automatic Espresso Machine**](https://www.pricedropdeals.com/2025/10/31/black-friday-espresso-machine-deals-2025/#strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-sony-wh-1000-xm-5-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong) **- 15 % Off**
   * A mid-range powerhouse, the 2300 Series offers six beverage presets (espresso, americano, latte macchiato, and more) and adjustable aroma strength. Reddit users praise its ceramic grinder for quiet operation and long life. The My Coffee Choice menu lets you tweak strength and temperature easily. **Balanced Reality:** Doesn’t include LatteGo system found on higher models; milk frothing requires external frother - but still produces barista-level espresso consistently.
* [**Chefman CaféMaster Pro Espresso Machine**](https://www.pricedropdeals.com/2025/10/31/black-friday-espresso-machine-deals-2025/#lg-48-inch-class-oled-evo-ai-c-5-series-oled-48-c-5-pua-22-off) **- 22 % Off**
   * Chefman’s CaféMaster Pro is one of the surprise heroes of Reddit this year. It combines a compact design with 15-bar extraction and an advanced thermoblock heating system for fast startup. The steam wand creates fine microfoam suitable for cappuccinos and flat whites. Redditors call it “the best under-$200 semi-auto.” **Balanced Reality:** Lacks a built-in grinder, meaning you’ll need fresh grounds or a separate burr grinder for the best results.
* [**De’Longhi Magnifica Evo Automatic Espresso Machine** ](https://www.pricedropdeals.com/2025/10/31/black-friday-espresso-machine-deals-2025/#strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-dji-avata-2-fly-more-combo-1-battery-27-off-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong)**- 22 % Off**
   * De’Longhi’s Magnifica Evo continues its legacy of durable Italian engineering. The dual heating system allows simultaneous coffee and milk prep. Reddit home-baristas love its creamy espresso texture and automatic cleaning cycle. The display icons are simple, ideal for beginners upgrading from pods. **Balanced Reality:** Slightly bulky footprint and proprietary milk frother parts cost more to replace - but reliability and flavor payoff are outstanding.
* [**Gevi Dual Boiler Espresso Machine**](https://www.pricedropdeals.com/2025/10/31/black-friday-espresso-machine-deals-2025/#strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-sony-inzone-h-9-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong-strong) **- 24 % Off**
   * Reddit’s enthusiast pick for value. Dual boilers enable simultaneous brewing and steaming, rare under $600. PID temperature control and commercial-style portafilter offer impressive shot consistency. The brushed-metal finish feels premium, and it comes with a solid steam wand. **Balanced Reality:** Takes time to preheat fully, and drip tray fills quickly - but performance rivals Breville’s higher-priced lineup.

# Buying Tips from Reddit’s Coffee Community

* **Check pump pressure specs:** 15 bar is the sweet spot; higher numbers aren’t always better.
* **Budget for a burr grinder** if you’re buying semi-automatic models like Breville or Chefman.
* **Avoid “bundle kits”** that include flavored syrups or off-brand tamper tools - Reddit threads show they often inflate prices.
* **Look for cleaning cycles** or removable brew groups for long-term durability.

1olf9mu,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1olf9mu/do_i_really_have_adhd_or_do_i_just_have_anxiety/,Do I really have ADHD or do I just have anxiety and caffeine addiction?,"I just got diagnosed by a psychiatrist last week. Well, the psychiatrist said it was an ""initial assessment"" but he said he could tell I had ADHD in the first 20 minutes of our session. He prescribed me some medication after the session. I haven't bought the meds yet and I'm kinda scared to take meds because I read that it can have crazy side effects such as risks of heart attacks and increased hyperacticity if a person who doesnt have ADHD takes them.

I just wanna be extra extra sure I have ADHD before taking medication. I know a literal psychiatrist already told me I have it but I'm just super anxious about it. I also detoxed from any caffeine for 2 days before my diagnosis so that the caffeine effects won't affect my behaviour during the diagnosis. 

Maybe anyone here can confirm if my behaviours/experiences do indeed indicate that I have ADHD?

1. I have a history of extremely disruptive behaviour as early as kindergarten. I got into physical fights with other kids. I never got along with other girls my age because I tend to play rough and I also didn't understand the nuances of like keeping secrets and handling misunderstandings in a non-confrontational manner.

2. In high school, I struggled to fit in because I still liked to play physical games like tag or talk about cartoons. I often moved around in the classroom to chitchat with my friends. Teachers hated it when I volunteered to talk or make jokes. My friends have called me ""childish"" and ""tactless"". 

3. When leaving the house, I find myself going back in again at least 3 times because I forgot an umbrella, a water jug, my ID, keys, etc.

4. I have really good memory when it comes to things I like. I can reacll really specific events from my childhood, books, movies, and video games. I also dont forget deadlines because I like to mark them in my calendar. The things I forget are like mostly physical items that I carry around. 

5. I had bad grades from kinder to highschool but I had no trouble passing the class, I just didnt feel like putting in extra effort to get in the honor rolls? My parents criticized me for that so I made up for it since 11th grade to this day (I am currently a 3rd year law student). Since 11th grade i was able to get high grades but I noticed that I am more prone to depression now? I dont enjoy life as much as I used to. 

6. I like to daydream—A LOT. Walking to the bus stop, riding the bus, driving my car—I listen to music and daydream about characters I made up. Whenever I have to sit in classes I dont like, I dissociate from reality and imagine those characters i made up. 

7. I also like to draw in class. I think aside from video games and movies, drawing is the one thing I can spend hours and hours fixating on. Some days I feel restless because I wanna watch a movie but I also love drawing but I only have time for one thing—so I watch a movie on one screen and draw digitally on the other screen. Or when I have a book I wanna finish, I like to listen to audiobooks while I draw.

8. I like to read fictional books too but that takes a bit of effort, usually I read books when I'm with my family or friends and I cant relate to what theyre doing so I retreat to a world that makes sense. I also read during lunch breaks during class hours while waiting for class to start. I also have to reallllyy like the story otherwise I wont finish the book. 

9. I am bad with social cues. I have trouble knowing when it's my turn to talk. As a kid I had a tendency of talking over others or interrupting them. I can talk for hours and hours without running out of things to say or activities to suggest doing. As an adult, I feel a bit more self conscious about that habit because I've had a lot of people tell me to shut the f up so I just go completely silent until the other person actually asks me ""so what do you think?"" 

10. I was addicted to coffee (1-3 cups a day) from grade 11 to 2nd year law school. I quit last year and replaced coffee with black tea and energy drinks. Without caffeine i just feel like I have a brain fog and I cant function, I just end up zoning out to my imaginary world staring at nothing or watching a movie for hours, not getting anything done. 

11. I tend to make white lies to cover up my incompetence. It's easier to say ""Sorry i was late, yknow traffic haha"" than to say ""I forgot I was supposed to wear a formal attire in the 2x2 ID pic we had to turn in today so I had to get it reprinted twice and I also don't know what the difference between a legal and a long bond paper is so I had to print two copies on both types of papers which  costed an insane amount by the way—which I did not know because I didnt check the prices before printing—also forgot to print the application forms needed so i had to run to another computer shop on the way here to get that printed too.""

12. If I have a stressful event planned ahead, doesnt matter if its an event that will happen in an hour, a week, or in a few months, I will constantly be thinking of strategies to cope for that event. Let's say i have to hangout with an acquaintance next saturday.  I will think ""welp there goes my saturday"" even though it's only like an hour of hanging out and it's like a week away. 

Sorry if this is super long. I just wanted to be thorough. Thoughts? Do i have adhd or is this just anxiety??

1olf850,https://www.reddit.com/r/traumatizeThemBack/comments/1olf850/this_happened_yesterday_and_i_still_dont_know_if/,"This happened yesterday and I still don’t know if I handled it right, but I can finally breathe","I (F45) worked at a consulting firm for twelve years. When I started, it was just five of us in a tiny office above a dentist. We used to order Thai food and argue over fonts. It felt like a team.

Then we got acquired.

The new management came in talking about “fresh energy” and “modern culture.” Which everyone over 40 immediately understood as: your time is almost up.

My new boss was 28. Smart, ambitious, and so sure of herself it was almost painful. I was supposed to train her. Within weeks, she was taking credit for my work and “coaching” me on how to write shorter emails.

One afternoon she called me into a glass conference room and said, “You have great institutional knowledge, but you rely on old methods. I need you to be more adaptable.”

I smiled and said I’d try.

That was the start of the end.

I stopped getting invited to client calls. My role was “redefined.” They moved my desk to the hallway “for better collaboration.” I kept telling myself it was fine. That if I just kept my head down, I’d outlast the storm.

Then HR called me in on a Friday. “Your position is being restructured.” Severance packet. Security escort. My boss smiled and said, “You’ve been such a steady presence here. We’ll miss your reliability.”

Reliability. Like I was a coffee maker that still kind of worked.

That was six months ago.

I was barely sleeping, just floating. Then one of our old clients reached out. Said they’d heard I wasn’t with the firm anymore and asked if I’d consider consulting. Apparently things had gone downhill fast.

I said yes.

That one project turned into three. Then I hired two old coworkers who’d also left. We set up a tiny firm. Nothing fancy, just quiet, solid work.

Yesterday morning, I got an email from my old boss. “Hey! We’re having trouble with the analytics model you built back in 2018. Would you be open to consulting?”

I said sure.

I walked into their shiny new office this morning. Everything was glass and neon, like a startup from a commercial. She looked genuinely shocked to see me. Said, “You look great! We’re so excited to work with you again.”

They were completely stuck. I recognized the problem immediately — it was my old system, just gutted and renamed. I fixed it in an hour.

She stood behind me the whole time. When it was done, she said quietly, “I didn’t realize how complex this was. You really knew what you were doing.”

I said, “Yeah, I did.”

Then I packed up my laptop and left.

She emailed later to thank me and said she hoped we could “collaborate again soon.”

I wrote back, “Of course. Send me the contract next time.”

Now I’m home, drinking tea, still kind of shaking. I keep thinking about how she looked when she realized I wasn’t gone — just working somewhere she couldn’t touch me.

Part of me feels bad. She’s young, probably under a lot of pressure. But also, she made me doubt myself for months.

And now she’s paying me to fix the mess she made.

Maybe that’s not revenge. Maybe it’s just balance.",168,1761971975.0,traumatizeThemBack,11,0.99,False

Many people get fast and safe relief just by changing a few daily habits.

* Drink warm water in morning (1-2 glass)
* Eat more fiber foods (papaya / banana / apple / flax seeds / oats)
* Walk or light exercise daily
* Cut down coffee, junk food, too much dairy products
* Try same toilet time every day
* Do not sit all day - move every 1-2 hours
* Stress control helps gut (slow breathing / small meditation)
* Herbal tea (like ginger / mint / fennel) can relax stomach
* Lemon + warm water can soften stool

This is “fast + safe” home method for many people.

1olf5ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1olf5ep/have_some_concerns_perhaps_theyre_ridiculous/,"Have some concerns, perhaps they’re ridiculous.","I’m not quite sure how to word my concern here but I’ll say that as more people have converted or been at least curious about orthodoxy, I’ve grown increasingly skeptical and cautious about the direction American orthodoxy is pointed. Not because conversion is anything negative (praise God for His work!) but because there seems to be a great emphasis placed on the politics of our day. Idk if anyone has encountered this in parish life (thankfully, I have not. Though I can’t say these are topics I’d want to bring up at coffee hour) but I’ve seen a huge amount of people (online, at least) gravitating towards radical political ideologies which they then tie to Orthodoxy as if orthodoxy supports something like Nazism(!) or segregation. I cannot, for the very heart of my being, understand how a Christian can support racist ideas or eugenics. This sincerely baffles me and yet it seems to be getting tied to a “traditional expression” of the faith. Is this concern valid at all or is this almost entirely online? What is going on here?

So, as an artist and digital creator, I wanted to paint something that celebrates *their strength, grace, and unapologetic power*.

If you love **digital art**, **watercolor stickers**, or simply believe in supporting **women-led creativity**, this is for you.

So I thought why not try it this way. Is anyone interested in a small casual meetup tomorrow 10:00 am at the Starbucks in Ueno Park? Let’s grab a coffee and maybe walk around the park. I would prefer to keep it small, so I’m thinking maybe up to 4 people me included. Meeting spot would be in front of the Starbucks.

1olf0ye,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1olf0ye/tinder_scam_shalimar_bagh_rohini/,Tinder scam Shalimar bagh Rohini,"It was a 6 months back episode. Why I'm posting this now because I have just seen few post heading tinder scam so I thought I should also contribute some of my recent experiences.

So it was a match in tinder. After 7-8 hours of general talking she asked my WhatsApp number. So you guys are right ladki kaise pehle number puch Sakti hai I was in the same impression. I have got the first intuition like it is a scam. The girl was very average looking. 

Anyways I have just shared my number and started talking on call and WhatsApp both. Normal dating questions like what is your expectations and all like you are looking for permanent partner or a friend or a just casual date..


So after 3 days she insisted me to meet as we were at the same location hardly 2 km from my home. She called and told me let's meetup for a coffee. I said okay but back of my mind hint number 2 its a scam ladki kaise pehle bol sakti hai Milne k liye. At the same time she asked me to talk to another girl from Rohini saying she is my cousin. I don't want to go alone can I ask her to come along I said it's okay. So I thought girls need general safety that's why she is asking for so I thought it's okay. Meanwhile she asked me to talk first with her cousin so that we don't feel awkward. She send me some pictures of her she was hot and sexy. In my mind I was confirmed it is a 200 % scam. 

So I was just wanted to see what these guys are doing. So finally we both are agreed for a meeting. I picked up her from Shalimar bagh and she said I'm hungry let's goto haldiram. Her leg was handicapped so I thought it can not be a scam. But I was wrong. I said okay because she told me her cousin stays near by to haldiram. I tried to change the location but no she was dead sure she wants to eat chole bhature.

Finally we picked up her cousin. Yes pics was same and she again forced for haldiram. So her vibes was not good at all. Finally I'm in my car with 2 scammer. Again I tried let's go to Starbucks will eat something there. But no she said haldiram only. So I was sure I have to be careful in haldiram. What these guys will do there. 

We entered in haldiram I told them to sit I'll get the food. They forced me no no we will go along with you. So in the billing counter I placed my order 1. Chole bhature 2. Raj kachori 3. Pao bhaji. And guess the bill it was 1900 something. I got it there when I asked for the bill she was there near the counter and took the bill in her hand. So I paid the bill quickly and ran away from there. Told them some medical emergency at home. And blocked them. 

So what was that of 1900 I was curious. I called haldiram after 2 days I need the bill I have got it misplaced so they send me on my WhatsApp. It was some random kaju stuff normal packed items. So once you know it's a scam you can get rid of it easily or may be I'm lucky. I was scammed with 2000 rs only.

1oley62,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCryptoIndia/comments/1oley62/can_bitcoin_ever_be_everyday_money/,Can Bitcoin Ever Be Everyday Money? 🤔💸,"So, I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately — Bitcoin has been around for over a decade, and while it’s technically a currency, it still doesn’t really function like one in everyday life. 

Most people aren’t buying coffee, groceries, or paying rent in BTC. Instead, it’s treated more like digital gold — a store of value or speculative investment.

But is that ever going to change?

On one hand:

⚡ Lightning Network is making transactions faster and cheaper.

🌍 Some countries (like El Salvador) have already made Bitcoin legal tender.

💳 There are Bitcoin debit cards that let you spend BTC anywhere Visa/Mastercard is accepted.

On the other hand:

💰 Price volatility makes it risky for both buyers and sellers.

🏦 Governments and banks still resist widespread adoption.

🧮 Transaction fees and confirmation times (on-chain) can be impractical for small purchases.

So, can Bitcoin realistically evolve into something we use for daily transactions — or will it always remain more of a digital asset than an everyday currency?

Would love to hear your takes — especially from people actually using BTC for daily stuff. Do you pay for coffee, groceries, or services with it? Or do you just hold?",1,1761970961.0,TheCryptoIndia,0,1.0,False

1olevsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Needafriend/comments/1olevsb/23m_looking_for_a_friend/,23m looking for a friend,"Hey hey! 👋

I moved to Toronto about 185 days ago (not that I’m counting 😅) from a small border town between Alberta and Saskatchewan. I was born in Canada but spent most of my life growing up in the Caribbean, and I moved back here about two years ago. I’m 23, around 6ft tall, and a Virgo — if that sort of thing matters to you.

It’s been a pretty interesting adjustment moving from a small town to a big city like Toronto. So far, I’ve made a few friends — mostly through school and Reddit — but you know how that goes… people come and go, conversations fade, and it’s hard to find that one person who really sticks. I’m really hoping to find a long-term, meaningful friendship — someone I can genuinely vibe with, share things with, hang out, talk about random stuff at 2 AM, or even just sit in silence and still feel comfortable. You know, that ride or die type of friendship where it feels effortless but solid.

A bit about me — I’d say I’m a little outgoing once I get comfortable, though I definitely have my chill and quiet moments too. I’m currently in college and living in North York. I love hiking (especially discovering new trails around Ontario), cooking (trying new recipes or making comfort food from home), watching TikToks or random YouTube videos, and just relaxing after a long day. I also really enjoy exploring — new neighborhoods, restaurants, coffee shops, anything that feels like a little adventure.

I’m looking for someone who’s also serious about making a real connection. Not just surface-level chatting or ghosting after a few days — but someone who actually values consistency, honesty, and effort. I don’t care too much about age or gender — just good vibes, respect, and mutual energy.

If any of that sounds like something you’re looking for too, feel free to message me. Tell me a bit about yourself — what you’re into, where you’re from, what kind of friendship you’re hoping to find. I’d love to get to know you and see where things go from there.",1,1761970718.0,Needafriend,1,1.0,False
