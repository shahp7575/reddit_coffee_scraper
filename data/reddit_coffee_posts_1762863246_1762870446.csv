Chapter 1

The year was 1996, and the air in suburbia Los Angeles hung thick with the sweet smell of possibility, cheap pizza, and CK One. Tonight’s venue was the spacious, vaguely beige rec room of Kevin Miller's house in the San Fernando Valley, a space hallowed by countless weekends of teenage inertia. Outside, sprinklers hissed, but inside, the sound system throbbed with the familiar, grinding chords of Smashing Pumpkins’ ""1979,"" the bass vibrating through the worn carpet.

Kevin, all gangly limbs and an oversized Hurley t-shirt, was currently engaged in the delicate operation of fast-forwarding a rented VHS copy of Twister to the tornado scene. ""Dude, Blockbuster was out of Trainspotting again,"" he griped, adjusting the tracking with a satisfying whirrrr of the VCR. ""Some senior had the last copy.""

Maya was draped across the beanbag chair, a phone cord wrapped around her finger as she semi-listened to her mom's strict nine p.m. curfew reminder while flipping through the new issue of Sassy magazine. ""Yeah, love you too, Mom, bye."" She hung up, a practiced, teenage sigh escaping her lips. ""Curfew,"" she announced to the room, as if it were a new, terrible law she'd just discovered.

Slumped on the cracked leather sofa, Brian was trying, and failing, to beat the final level of Super Mario 64 on Kevin’s N64, a gift he’d received that very morning. ""Peach's castle is stupid,"" he muttered, thumb a blur on the gray, three-pronged controller. He was wearing a fresh pair of JNCOs, their enormous cuffs already fraying from dragging on the ground.

The fourth member of their quartet, Chloe, sat cross-legged on the floor, meticulously painting her toenails a shade of frosted pale blue called ""Ice Queen."" A half-empty can of Tab rested precariously near her knee. ""It’s cool, we can just watch Clueless again,"" she suggested, not looking up. ""I can practically recite it.""

""No Clueless,"" Brian groaned, finally throwing the controller down in defeat. ""I can only handle so much 'as if' in one night.""

A sudden, sharp ding-dong from the front door sent a wave of mild panic through them. Kevin’s parents were out at a neighbor's Tupperware party, meaning unexpected visitors were a wild card.

""Did anyone invite anyone?"" Kevin whispered, hitting the mute button on the TV remote. The room suddenly felt very quiet, save for the hum of the refrigerator down the hall.

""No,"" Maya whispered back, sitting up straight. ""Maybe it's the pizza guy? We only ordered twenty minutes ago.""

""Pizza delivery guys don't ding-dong, they knock,"" Chloe pointed out logically.

Kevin crept out of the rec room and peeked around the corner of the entryway. He let out an audible sigh of relief and flung the door open. It was just Leo, a guy from their geometry class, holding a worn cassette tape and looking slightly nervous.

""Hey, sorry, the front door was unlocked,"" Leo said, stepping inside. His T-shirt was an authentic, faded Beastie Boys Licensed to Ill concert tee that everyone coveted. ""My car stereo ate my tape on the way over. Brian, you still have that extra car adapter for my Walkman?""

Chapter 2, Waking Up

The smell of stale pizza and artificial grape soda was the first thing that greeted Kevin’s senses the next morning. Sunlight, sharp and unforgiving, cut through the gaps in the blinds, casting dusty stripes across the rec room floor. Brian was still asleep on the sofa, mouth open, a small puddle of drool on the leather cushion. Maya and Chloe were curled up in the beanbags, looking surprisingly comfortable.

Kevin stretched, his Hurley shirt twisted around his torso. His stomach growled a complaint, and he sat up, blinking the sleep from his eyes. He glanced toward the television set, intending to check the time on one of the cable news channels before his parents woke up.

He stopped, mid-stretch.

Where the bulky, beige VCR and the squat, gray RCA television had been was now something entirely different. It was a screen, massive and floating above a sleek, nearly invisible base on the entertainment center. The strangest part: he could see the wall and a framed picture of his family through the screen. It was perfectly transparent until he saw tiny, barely-there icons flicker to life at the bottom edge.

He rubbed his eyes hard. The screen remained, a sheet of glass that seemed to hum with an almost imperceptible energy.

""Uh, guys?"" he whispered, his voice dry.

Maya stirred, pushed herself into a sitting position, and followed his gaze. ""Whoa. Did your dad buy a new TV last night while we were asleep?"" she mumbled, voice thick with sleep. ""That is... weirdly flat.""

Brian snorted awake. ""Wha—did we get the future, or something?"" He stumbled over to the set, reaching out a tentative hand. The surface was cool and smooth.

""Kevin, try turning it on,"" Chloe suggested, eyes wide now.

Kevin fumbled for the remote on the coffee table, but the remote was a small, smooth, oval object with only a few buttons, nothing like the bulky, thirty-button controller from yesterday. He picked it up. A faint light glowed when he touched it.

""Power,"" he said out loud, uncertainly, holding the remote towards the screen.

Instantly, the transparent screen filled with light and color. A sleek, minimalist interface appeared, accompanied by a soft, pleasant chime. A small box in the corner blinked: ""Voice Command Active. Good Morning.""

""Voice command?"" Brian echoed, stepping back. ""Like on Star Trek?""

""Play MTV News,"" Kevin blurted out, a test.

The screen shimmered, reorganizing the windows on the display, and a news anchor appeared, overlaying the view of the wall behind the TV. It wasn't the usual static-filled cable; the picture was so crisp it looked like the anchor was standing in the room.

""Okay, this is some next-level rich-kid stuff, Kev,"" Maya said, getting up.

""I swear to God, I have no idea,"" Kevin said, bewildered. ""My parents went to a Tupperware party, not the electronics store.""

He reached for the pocket of his shorts for his pager and wallet. His pager was gone. Instead, he pulled out a slim, clear device that looked like a smooth shard of dark glass. The edges glowed when he gripped it. It was cold to the touch, lighter than air. It looked just like the futuristic handhelds they had only ever seen in the pages of sci-fi magazines.

Chloe and Maya pulled identical devices from their pockets and bags. Brian checked his JNCOs pocket and found one too.

""Is this a phone?"" Maya asked, touching an icon that looked like a phone receiver.

A minimalist interface appeared on the glass, showing a dial pad and a tiny date in the upper corner: Friday, May 31, 1996.

""It's still '96,"" she announced, a hint of relief in her voice. The date hadn't changed. The world hadn't skipped a few years.

""It's also a music player,"" Brian discovered, swiping a finger across the clear screen, his finger leaving a glowing, temporary trail. A playlist appeared, full of bands he knew, but the interface was space-age.

The group gravitated towards the corner of the room where Kevin’s bulky PC usually sat on a small desk. The boxy monitor and the enormous tower were gone. In their place was a sleek, all-in-one unit with a floating, transparent screen hovering over a thin keyboard base.

""Let's go online,"" Brian suggested. The group felt an instinctual pull to the only place they might find answers: the internet, slow and dialing up as it usually was.

Kevin sat down and instinctively knew how to wake the computer with a motion gesture. The transparent monitor flared to life. The boot sequence was silent and instantaneous, no screeching modem sounds.

He opened ""Netscape Navigator"" which now had a different icon and instantly connected. There was no dial-up noise, just silence. He typed in a query that felt suddenly vital: Space Race End Date.

The search results popped up in a fraction of a second, an overwhelming flood of information organized impeccably.

Kevin clicked the top link. They all leaned in over his shoulder, reading the text on the floating screen:

The Space Race, a decades-long competition for supremacy in space exploration between the United States and the Soviet Union, formally concluded in 1991 with the collapse of the USSR. The US established the first permanent lunar base, 'Tranquility,' in 1973, followed by Zvesda, NASA conducts first human missions to Mars in 1986. First Mars base established 1989.

A heavy silence descended on the rec room.

""Nineteen ninety-one?"" Brian whispered. ""My history book said the Space Race tapered off in the seventies...""

""And a moon base in '73?"" Maya added, her eyes darting between the transparent handheld in her hand and the futuristic computer screen.

Chloe looked at her reflection in the glossy, transparent screen of her new handheld, her ice-blue nail polish looking suddenly out of place. ""The Cold War ended in '91, and we won? I thought things were still kind of... tense.""

They looked at each other, the bright, synthesized future humming around them in the form of transparent screens and silent computers. The world outside the window still looked like their 1996 Los Angeles suburb, but everything they held, everything they touched, screamed that their reality had been fundamentally, subtly, upgraded overnight. The year was 1996, according to their handhelds, but it was a different 1996—a future that had somehow arrived forty years too early, while they were sleeping off pizza.

Chapter 3, The Future

The teens, still reeling from the instant-on internet and transparent screens, stumbled out of Kevin’s rec room and into his sun-drenched backyard.
Brian was the first to reach the sliding glass door and peeked through the vertical blinds, his voice a disbelieving gasp.

""Guys. You have to see this.""

They gathered behind him, peering through the slats, and a new wave of shock washed over them. It wasn't the Los Angeles they knew. The low, rumbling hum of the freeway was gone, replaced by a softer, more constant whir. What had been a cerulean-brown smudge on the horizon—the ever-present, smog-choked Los Angeles skyline—was now a crisp, crystalline vista of impossible structures. Gleaming towers of glass and chrome pierced the perfectly clear blue sky, connected by what looked like aerial walkways and platforms. The city's sprawl was replaced by an almost organic, vertical architecture.

Then they noticed the traffic. Or, rather, the complete lack of it on the streets below. The roads were virtually empty, save for a few boxy, self-driving shuttles silently ferrying passengers along designated routes. But above the streets, in organized, luminous lanes, a stream of vehicles flowed through the air. Sleek, pod-like flying cars zipped along, a silent ballet of personal transport. Larger, more utilitarian-looking flying semis and buses, presumably hauling goods and people across the vast, revitalized metropolis, moved with the steady grace of an ocean liner.

""It's like Blade Runner,"" Chloe breathed, her voice a mix of awe and terror. ""But... clean.""

Maya's gaze was fixed on a flying semi that banked a turn with an effortless dip of its chassis. ""How is there no smog? Did... did they invent some kind of smog cleaner?""

""This can't be real,"" Brian muttered, shaking his head and pinching his arm. ""I'm still asleep. This is some kind of collective dream we're having.""

But the feel of the sunlight on his skin was real. The smell of freshly cut grass from Kevin's pristine lawn was real.

Kevin stared at a futuristic flying bus, painted with the city's emblem, as it floated down the main street. His mind, still stuck in the rhythms of 1996, struggled to process the seismic shift. The sound of a leaf blower, a noise he was accustomed to, would have felt more natural.

""What do we do?"" Maya asked, pulling her arms around herself. The world outside looked magnificent and terrifying, an alien landscape painted over the familiar canvas of their suburban life.

""We have to see if anyone else noticed,"" Kevin said, his voice firming with a new, strange resolve. ""We have to find out what happened.""

They ran back inside, past the silent, future-tech TV and computer, their own transparent handhelds clutched tight in their hands. They burst out the front door, onto the still-familiar concrete of Kevin's driveway, where their bikes were still propped against the garage. But the garage itself, a place of suburban normalcy, now looked like the entrance to a time machine.

Chapter 4, Fusion

The street outside was quiet, the only sound the high-frequency hum of a personal aerial vehicle zipping two hundred feet overhead. Their bikes were still propped against the garage door, the rubber on their tires smelling faintly of the same old air, a small comfort in a world gone mad. But the sight of a flying garbage truck floating silently down the street was enough to send them scurrying back indoors, the front door slamming shut behind them.

They gathered around the transparent computer screen again, a newfound purpose in their movements. They needed answers, and their new, hyper-speed internet seemed eager to provide them.

""Okay,"" Kevin said, grabbing the floating mouse—a small, smooth orb—and moving it over the screen. ""We know the space race went longer. We know the USSR fell in '91. We have anti-gravity cars and clear skies. There has to be a reason for the tech jump."" He began typing, the silent keyboard responding instantly to his touch. ""Technological accelerator event.""

The search results populated instantly. The top result was a historical timeline from the ""Global Consensus Archive.""

1980: Project Ares Initiated - US and USSR collaborate on joint human mission to Mars, spurred by the 1979 energy crisis.

1985: Ares I Lands on Mars - First human steps on Mars; establishment of the 'Olympus' base begins.

1988: Fusion Breakthrough - Dr. Aris Thorne patents the 'Confinement Ring' fusion reactor design at the Olympus Mars Base, enabled by unique atmospheric conditions and collaborative effort.

1991: End of Cold War; Global Energy Treaty Signed - Fusion power plants begin construction worldwide.

1994: First Anti-Gravity Propulsion Test - Leveraging ultra-high-density power generation from fusion, scientists develop stable gravimetric plating.

They read the timeline in stunned silence.

""Mars base,"" Brian whispered, eyes wide. ""They had a human mission to Mars in 1985?"" In Brian's 1996, the space shuttle program was the peak of achievement, and Mars was a dream for the next century.

""Thorne figured out fusion... on Mars?"" Maya asked, tracing the dates with her finger on the screen. ""In '88? That's eight years ago!"" The Maya from yesterday thought fusion was a theoretical pipe dream, always forty years away.

""That’s why the skies are clean,"" Chloe realized, pointing out the window toward the pristine blue sky. ""If they have fusion power plants everywhere, they don't need fossil fuels.""

""And anti-gravity,"" Kevin added, scrolling down to the 1994 entry. ""They have so much power that they can just... cancel gravity. That's why the cars fly. That's why everything is so sleek."" He looked at the transparent computer screen in front of them, then at his clear handheld device. ""The technology wasn't just invented; it was accelerated. The need for a Mars base created the breakthrough, and that breakthrough changed everything else.""

The group stared at the computer screen, the sheer scale of the change settling over them. It wasn't just their neighborhood that was different. The entire trajectory of human history had shifted, catalyzed by a collaborative push into space in a decade that, in their minds, was defined by big hair and the Iran-Contra affair.

""We fell asleep in one version of 1996,"" Brian said, a slow, dawning realization crossing his face as he looked out the window at a flying school bus, ""and woke up in a whole other one.""

Chapter 5, Space

A new kind of wonder, different from the sleek cityscapes, filled the transparent screen as Kevin navigated to the news site detailing the inter-agency space development. A video played, showcasing a montage of humanity's off-world progress.

The spaceships were nothing like the clunky, gray, and utilitarian rockets of their past. Powered by the clean, powerful glow of fusion engines, they were massive, elegant beasts of engineering. Many followed a ""spine"" design: a long, central truss connecting the main propulsion at the rear with the habitat and cargo sections forward. The habitat sections themselves often featured rotating rings to provide artificial gravity, the rings spinning slowly, a mesmerizing waltz of engineering and physics. 

Some ships were massive, multi-hulled cargo carriers, their fusion exhaust plumes a constant, barely visible shimmer. These were the vessels that carried the immense loads for asteroid mining operations or supplied the domed cities on Mars and the moon bases.

The most stunning visuals came from the deep space exploration vessels. These ships were a blend of industrial might and graceful, retro-futuristic style. They had large, dish-like radiators, and powerful thrusters, but their living quarters often featured large, transparent viewing ports, bringing a sense of majesty and openness to the cold vacuum of space. The aesthetic seemed to be a mix of the optimistic future of 1980s sci-fi movies, but with the clean, elegant execution of a civilization that had mastered its technology.

The final video clip showed the NASA administrator, Margo Madison, standing in front of a sleek new prototype that dwarfed the other ships. The vessel had an unusual, ring-like structure at its front. Her announcement that NASA was working on an Alcubierre Drive, a technology that would theoretically allow faster-than-light travel by warping spacetime, marked a bold, new future. The images of these ships cemented a single truth in the teens' minds: their world had advanced, and humanity's reach was no longer limited to Earth.

Chapter 6, Food

The teens, still glued to the transparent screen, continued to follow the rabbit hole of their altered reality. Kevin, now an expert at navigating the futuristic interface, typed in a new query:

""Why is the food so different?"" The thought had just occurred to them as their stomachs rumbled, a stark reminder of the half-eaten pizza box from the night before.

The search results detailed how the intense demands of the Martian bases and Moon colonies for self-sufficient food production had revolutionized agriculture on Earth. The same technologies used to feed astronauts in sterile, controlled environments were brought home.

They read about the rise of vertical farming, a system of hydroponic towers and automated, climate-controlled greenhouses that had replaced most traditional farms. This new method used a fraction of the water and land, allowing for fresh produce to be grown year-round in cities themselves.

Next, they discovered lab-grown meat. The same biological science that engineered resilient crops for space missions had created an ethical, resource-efficient way to produce all kinds of meat in vast, sterile facilities. This had completely ended the industrial livestock industry, massively reducing methane emissions and land usage.

The biggest surprise came with the mention of RNA-modified and GMO crops. Instead of a controversial topic, the space race had fast-tracked this technology to create crops that were more nutrient-rich, resilient to disease, and could be grown with higher yields in any climate. This agricultural boom had led to an unprecedented abundance and variety of food.

A news article from their current 1996 timeline scrolled across the screen, a profile on the changes to public education. ""Thanks to the abundance of low-cost, high-quality ingredients from vertical farms and synthetic protein labs, every public school and university cafeteria now offers a menu of diverse and nutritious meals,"" the article stated. It showed images of high school students eating authentic-looking stir-fry and pad thai.

""So, no more mystery meat in the cafeteria?"" Chloe asked, her mind trying to reconcile the image of a healthy, diverse school lunch with the soggy tater tots and rectangular pizza she was used to.

""And check this out,"" Maya said, pointing to a highlighted sentence. ""College students no longer rely on ramen for sustenance, with many only eating it as a 'nostalgic treat.'""

Brian looked at the screen and then out at the flying cars silently cruising through the air. The realization hit them all at once. Even the most mundane, everyday aspect of their lives—what they ate—had been completely transformed by the race to the stars.

Chapter 7, Space Continued

The computer screen became a window into a vast, thriving solar system. Kevin clicked on the news portal's dedicated ""Sol"" section, which opened a dynamic map of human presence beyond Earth. Interactive links detailed the scope of humanity's expansion.

The Moon was no longer a barren rock. Below the Tranquility base they had read about earlier were sprawling images of fortified habitats and industrial complexes nestled within the walls of craters and lava tubes, protected from radiation and micrometeorites. The headlines spoke of extracting helium-3 for the fusion reactors back on Earth.

Clicking on Mars brought up breathtaking aerial views of the planet. While the surface was still predominantly red desert, massive, crystalline domes shimmered in the sunlight, covering entire cities that thrived within. The atmosphere outside the domes was thin but slowly being terraformed. Maya pointed to a headline about ""The New Alexandria,"" a university city in the Valles Marineris.

The timeline jumped further out, showcasing more ambitious projects. The Asteroid Belt was a hive of activity. The screen showed cross-section diagrams of hollowed-out asteroids that had been transformed into self-contained, rotating cities, their inner surfaces covered in green space and residences, providing both living space and immediate access to raw materials for the mining operations happening all around them.

The most shocking images came from the outer solar system. A video detailed the ""Europa Accord,"" a joint US, Russian, and EU project focused on Jupiter's icy moon. They watched footage captured by robotic submersibles exploring a vast, black ocean beneath miles of ice. The video cut to an underwater city anchored to the seafloor, illuminated by artificial light and the faint, filtered light of Jupiter above.

Finally, they saw footage of colossal rotating ring space stations, not just small modules, but genuine habitats floating in orbit, serving as transfer points for the massive spaceships that traveled between planets. They served as bustling space ports, teeming with a new class of space farers who saw the solar system, not just Earth, as home.

Brian, the N64 controller still in his hand, sat back, completely overwhelmed. ""Europa. Underwater cities on Europa. Yesterday, the deepest we went was the local pool.""

The sheer scale of the vision on the screen was undeniable. The generation of teenagers, who only yesterday thought the future would look like The Jetsons in 2060, were now living in a 1996 where humanity had already become a multi-planetary species.

Chapter 8, Mech Ball

The news articles and historical timelines continued to pile up on the transparent screen, painting a more complete picture of the future. The teenagers, now thoroughly engrossed, had completely forgotten the stale pizza and their once-normal lives.

""Asteroid mining led to this?"" Brian murmured, his attention captured by a different headline. Kevin clicked on the article, and a video of a sleek, armored, bipedal machine appeared on the screen. It was several stories high and moved with a grace that defied its size, its legs articulating like a dancer's.

The article explained that early asteroid mining, requiring complex maneuvers and precise drilling in zero-gravity, spurred a joint project between Lockheed Martin and a Japanese aerospace company, Shikishima Industries. Their partnership created advanced, haptic-controlled machines for mining operations. These mining mechs were designed for stability and dexterity in low-gravity, and their robust construction was necessary for breaking apart large asteroids.

It wasn't long before the technology, combined with the new fusion power sources, found a use beyond space exploration. An entrepreneur, seeing the potential for a spectator sport, had the radical idea to repurpose the mining technology for entertainment.

The next video clip showed a massive, futuristic stadium, filled with thousands of screaming fans. On a field roughly the size of five traditional football fields, two teams of towering, armored mechs clashed. They resembled muscular, futuristic football players, with shoulder pads and helmets. The mechs slammed into each other with controlled force, their pilots inside experiencing every impact and jolt through the haptic feedback system, a direct descendant of the asteroid miners' controls.

""They play football with mechs,"" Chloe said, dumbfounded. ""That's... that's a new level of extreme.""

A commentator's voice echoed from the speakers, describing the action with a frantic excitement that sounded familiar, but applied to something entirely alien. ""The Las Vegas Neon Knights are driving hard downfield, pilot 'Viper' Tanaka showing incredible precision in the driver's seat!""

""Hotshot pilots,"" Maya said, eyes wide with the spectacle. ""They're the new sports superstars.""

The article went on to explain the demise of the NFL. As technology had evolved, football had become safer, more precise, and frankly, less exciting. With the advent of fusion power and advanced haptic technology, the world was ready for a new, more visceral spectator sport. Mech Football, with its blend of strategy, raw power, and high-tech piloting, filled that void perfectly. It was violent, dramatic, and a perfect showcase for the incredible technology born from the space race.

The teenagers, yesterday obsessed with the upcoming football season, now stared at a future where their favorite game had been replaced by a much larger, more explosive one. The quiet, suburban streets of their 1996 looked further away than ever.

Chapter 9, Humanitarianism 

The paradigm shift continued as the teens explored how their new world addressed fundamental human challenges. The breakthroughs that fed space colonies and revamped American school lunches had a profound global impact.

The search results detailed a transformative era for Africa. The continent, once frequently plagued by famine and disease in their original timeline, had become one of the fastest-developing regions on Earth. The reasons were a direct result of space-derived technologies:

Vertical Farming and Drought-Resistant Crops: The RNA-modified and GMO crops, designed to grow with minimal resources and high yields in space, were rapidly deployed in African nations. These resilient crops flourished even in drought-prone areas. Simultaneously, large-scale, efficient vertical farms were established in and around rapidly growing urban centers, ensuring consistent food supplies that were no longer dependent on volatile weather patterns or traditional farming constraints.

Disease Reduction and Health Tech: The advanced medical monitoring, imaging (like MRI and CT scanners), and portable diagnostic equipment developed for astronaut health and remote space medicine

 were commercialized and distributed widely. These technologies, coupled with improved sanitation infrastructure made possible by efficient fusion power and advanced engineering, led to massive reductions in common diseases and an increase in life expectancy across the continent.

Infrastructure Leapfrog: Africa, with abundant access to clean, affordable fusion energy, skipped the fossil fuel-heavy industrialization phase of other nations. This allowed for the rapid development of advanced infrastructure, communication networks (leveraging the vast satellite constellations), and modern cities built with a futuristic, clean-slate approach, avoiding the pollution problems that choked cities like their L.A. in the original timeline.

Articles highlighted bustling African capitals with sleek architecture and thriving tech industries, fueled by a healthy, well-nourished, and rapidly growing population. The narrative was one of empowerment and progress, using the very technologies born from the global competition of the space race to address Earth's most pressing problems.

The image on the screen showed a bustling, futuristic African city, vibrant and full of life. The sight was a powerful contrast to the images of poverty and struggle that had dominated the news in their previous 1996. The world they now inhabited wasn't just technologically advanced; it was fundamentally more equitable and prosperous, a startling, hopeful realization that left the four teens in quiet awe.

Chapter 10, Family

A noise from upstairs broke the trance. A familiar, cheerful voice called down the hallway: ""Kevin! Breakfast is ready! Don't let those friends of yours sleep all day!""

The sound of his mom’s voice, unchanged, normal, and warm, brought a jolt of relief mixed with a strange anxiety. They were still their families. The people they knew and loved were here, in this upgraded world.

""We should probably... go eat,"" Kevin suggested, leading the way upstairs to a kitchen that was also subtly different—sleek, induction surfaces, and a holographic recipe projector. His parents greeted his friends as they always did. Maya's handheld buzzed. ""My mom just texted me,"" she said, looking at the transparent screen. ""She's fine. My sister's fine. Everything at home is normal.""

After a quick breakfast of something that looked like a bagel but tasted remarkably better and was nutritionally complete, they realized they had to get to school. They gathered their things and headed outside, the bright sun of this new, clear LA morning hitting their faces.

""We can take my car,"" Chloe offered, pressing a button on her transparent handheld.

The vehicle that rose from the garage was a stunning sight. In their original 1996, it was a brand-new, standard silver BMW convertible, a point of pride for her parents. Now, it was a sleeker, almost seamless silver vehicle with subtle aerodynamic curves and no visible exhaust pipes. It didn't roll out; it lifted, hovering a few inches off the ground on silent anti-gravity pads. The roof retracted smoothly and silently, revealing a pristine white interior.

""Hop in,"" Chloe said, a nascent grin on her face. This was pretty cool.

They piled in, and Chloe instinctively knew how to operate the simple interface on the dashboard. A map projected onto the windshield, showing their route with an estimated time of arrival of just four minutes. The car silently accelerated, rising ten feet into the air and merging seamlessly into the flow of aerial traffic. Brian, in the back, stared down at the streets below, a mix of sheer terror and pure joy on his face.

Their school, Northwood High, was the next surprise. The familiar, low-slung, beige campus was gone. In its place stood a towering complex of glass and steel, integrated with vertical gardens and solar panels. It was enormous, a genuine campus of learning that looked more like a modern university from their old timeline. The sheer scale was breathtaking.

Chloe landed the BMW convertible in a designated aerial parking spot on the third level of the parking structure. They walked toward the entrance, their eyes scanning the massive grounds.

They emerged onto a large green quad, and there it was: the sports field. It was far more massive than any field they had ever seen, its turf a perfect, artificial green. The goalposts were colossal, intricate structures designed to accommodate much larger players. On the far side of the field, a row of idle mechs stood, parked and waiting. They were easily two stories high, their metallic hulls gleaming in the sun, a few students in haptic-suits milling around them.

The bell rang—a soft, pleasant chime rather than a piercing klaxon. Students walked past them, casually scrolling through transparent handhelds, heading towards a school where lunch was gourmet, football was played by robots, and the future was already here. The four friends shared a look. They had a lot of catching up to do, but for the first time since they woke up, they felt a real, buzzing excitement for the day ahead.

Chapter 12, Lunch

The school cafeteria was less a cafeteria and more a vibrant, open-air food court. Sunlight streamed in through massive windows, illuminating a space filled with bustling students, holographic menu projections, and the quiet whir of automation. The smell was incredible, a medley of spices, fresh vegetables, and savory grilled meats—worlds away from the soggy french fries and rectangular pizza of their memory.

The four teens found an empty table, their trays holding colorful, artfully arranged meals that looked like they belonged in a five-star restaurant, not a high school. They had chosen a variety of dishes: Kevin had a plate of sushi, Maya had what looked like authentic Thai noodles, Chloe was eating a perfectly grilled burger on a sesame bun that was lab-grown, and Brian was devouring a massive burrito. They were still so engrossed in their new reality, however, that they barely touched the food at first.

""Look at this,"" Brian whispered, passing his transparent handheld to Kevin. On the shimmering screen was a high-resolution image of one of the mech football players they'd seen on the field, its intricate mechanical design perfectly rendered. ""This is a real robot football player. Our world's biggest sports stars are robots.""

Chloe nodded, scrolling through her own device, looking at close-ups of the cockpits. ""And they're piloted by teenagers, basically. Can you imagine the reflexes you'd need?""

""It's all that haptic technology from the asteroid miners,"" Maya added, her own handheld showing a video clip of a mech making a brutal, but somehow graceful, tackle. ""It's insane.""

As they gawked at the images, a small, sleek robot on two bipedal legs glided silently past their table. It carried a tray of drinks, its movements fluid and precise. A few seconds later, it delivered a pair of smoothies to two students at a nearby table and glided away, its movements so normal that no one else even glanced at it.

Another, larger, robot approached the main food station, its multiple arms deftly scooping food from large warming trays and placing them on trays for students who had just arrived. It had a small, digital face that displayed a friendly, minimalist emoticon. The students walked up, their handhelds likely pre-ordering their meals, and the robot served them with perfect efficiency.

""Is that thing... an AI?"" Kevin asked, mesmerized as the robot navigated the crowd with practiced ease. ""It just... knows what everyone wants.""

""And it’s so fast,"" Chloe said, looking at the long, empty line that would have been a chaotic snaking queue in her old timeline. ""No lines, no human errors. Just robots and amazing food.""

Brian, who hadn’t been able to keep his eyes off the robot waiter, finally took a bite of his burrito. His eyes widened. ""And the food is... oh my god. This tastes like an actual burrito. Not some frozen thing reheated under a heat lamp.""

The lunch crowd was a blur of seamless, technological convenience. Students laughed, chatted, and ate their gourmet meals, completely oblivious to the fact that their daily lunchtime routine was powered by technologies born from a space race that had re-written human history. For the four of them, however, it was just another mind-bending, reality-warping moment in their new, bizarrely advanced 1996.

Chapter 13, Clueless

The lunch period was winding down when Maya nudged Chloe and discreetly pointed towards the center of the cafeteria.

""Look,"" she whispered. ""It's them.""

Sitting at a table near the main entrance was a group of girls they instantly recognized. In their old timeline, this clique was the untouchable elite: cheerleaders with perfect hair, superior sneers, and an uncanny ability to make everyone else feel small. The ringleader, Brittany, was famous for her cutting remarks and an entourage that followed her every move.

In this 1996, they looked different. Their clothes were stylish and definitely ""girly,"" but with a futuristic edge. Brittany wore a sleek, iridescent pink top that seemed to shimmer with a faint internal light and a flowing, asymmetrical skirt that defied conventional fabrics. Her friends wore similarly chic, brightly colored outfits, their accessories minimalist and technologically integrated. Their hair was styled, but not the stiff, aerosol-sprayed 'do' of the old timeline; it looked effortlessly perfect and healthy.

As the four friends watched, one of the girls laughed, a genuine, warm sound that felt foreign coming from her. Another one activated a small projector on their table, showcasing a complex, rotating diagram of a mech engine part, which they all leaned in to examine. It seemed they were discussing a project, not gossiping.

""They look the same, but... different,"" Chloe observed. ""And are they seriously looking at engine specs?""

""Watch this,"" Brian said, a devilish idea forming. He picked up a piece of cutlery—a sleek, metallic utensil that was impossibly light—and ""accidentally"" fumbled it, sending it clattering to the polished floor, sliding directly toward the popular girls' table.

The noise cut through the low hum of the cafeteria. Brittany looked up from the projection on her table. The four friends braced themselves for the usual eye-roll, the superior smirk, and the icy glare that would demand they pick it up while making them feel like garbage.

Instead, Brittany offered a small, polite smile. She elegantly reached down, picked up the utensil, and stood up, walking toward them.

""Excuse me,"" she said, her voice completely devoid of the usual snobbishness, just a calm and friendly tone. ""I believe this is yours."" She held it out to Brian.

Brian, completely thrown off balance, stuttered, ""Uh, yeah. Thanks. Sorry.""

""No problem,"" she said, still smiling. ""Accidents happen."" She glanced at their food, then back at them. ""I hope you guys are enjoying the Pad Thai. The protein synthesis on the lab-grown chicken in that dish is particularly high quality today. I recommend adding a dash of the spice oil for a better flavor profile.""

With a polite nod, she turned and walked back to her table, seamlessly rejoining her friends and their technical discussion.

The four friends stared after her, their meals forgotten.

""She was... nice,"" Maya said, in complete shock. ""She offered a genuine food recommendation. She didn't call me a loser or ask if my mom knew I was wearing that outfit.""

Kevin looked at the spot where Brittany had been standing. ""Maybe the space race fixed attitude problems, too?"" he mused. ""With all this advanced tech and a better world, maybe people just stopped being so petty.""

""Or maybe,"" Chloe suggested, a thoughtful look on her face as she looked at her high-tech cutlery, ""in a world where the future is this amazing, there’s no time to be a jerk about who sits where.""

The dynamic of the school had shifted as much as the technology. Cliques seemed less rigid, focused more on shared interests in science or engineering than on social hierarchy. In this advanced 1996, the world was too big, and the future too exciting, for high school drama.",1,1762870144.0,BeverlyHills90210,0,1.0,False

I like listening to people. I am good at empathy and I guess I give decent advice. At work, if someone was stressed I would say hey want to talk about it and sometimes we grabbed coffee. It was casual. But recently my team started treating me like their personal counselor.



It began when one coworker asked if we could “schedule a session.” I thought she was joking. Then she sent me a calendar invite labeled talk about my marriage problems. Later someone else added a “weekly check in.” Another person actually sent me a document of topics to cover. My calendar became a mess of one on one emotional dumps. People would show up at my desk and say so today I need to process something heavy. Meanwhile I am drowning in my own work and have deadlines, but they act like my time is free because listening is not real work.



Last week someone messaged me asking if I had any open slots in the afternoon. Like I am a therapist with billing hours. I told them I can not keep doing this, that it is draining and I need to focus on my tasks. They looked shocked and said wow I thought you actually cared. Another coworker said I am “emotionally selfish” and that I created the safe space so I should maintain it.



I stopped accepting invites and started answering with sorry I am not available. People are now gossiping that I dont support the team. I feel guilty since I did start the whole listening thing but I dont want to be everyones emotional sponge at work. AITJ for setting a boundary and refusing to be the unpaid therapist

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

She scans the room, spots the outlet by my table and heads straight toward me like a missile.



Without even saying hello she asks how much longer I will be using the outlet. I say I am working and probably need it for a while. She sighs dramatically and says she needs to charge her phone right now because she has very important calls. Then she literally sets her cup down on my table and reaches toward my charger. I put my hand over it and say please dont touch my stuff.



She responds well I need this seat and you already used the outlet too long. I remind her I bought food, I was here first, and the cafe doesnt assign tables. She tells me that students and remote workers abuse cafes and that I should let her use the outlet because she is a paying customer. I look at my receipt sitting beside my laptop. She didnt even buy anything yet.



At this point the barista comes over because he heard raised voices. The woman says this guy is refusing to let me use the outlet. The barista calmly asks if she purchased something. She says not yet I was going to once I get a table. Barista says sorry but customers who have made a purchase can use any available outlet. She goes red and says then cancel my order.

1ouaa8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ouaa8y/my_girlfriend_of_4_and_a_half_years_has_been/,My Girlfriend of 4 and a half years has been having an intimate relationship with my brother,"Just as it says in the title..this is my first post so bare with me

So me and my partner 33m and 28f have been together for 4 and a half years. Honestly as cliche and it sounds, I really thought she was the love of my life! Traveled the world with her and some of the most amazing experiences with her.

So let's get down to it. Half way through this relationship my brother was having a mental breakdown and wanted to end his life, he had been begging me to move in as he didn't want to be alone, which honestly was a surprise as my brother is very together on paper (owns business and goes to the gym etc) he has a very stoic mindset. As a brother I felt it my duty to move in, even if I didn't want too, I wouldn't want to have him harm himself or do something silly.

So me and my partner moved in, we figured aswell as looking after him it would give me and her time to save for a few years so we can get our own place. This seemed like the right choice given my brothers situation...oh how wrong I was.

So while living there my girlfriend lost her job due to lay offs, she was unemployed for about 5 months. My brother being self employed works from home..I believe this  is where it all started as they were spending alot of time together at this point.

My relationship started to take a funny turn when I approached her about how close she was getting with my brother, this caused her to have a serious level of distain for me over long periods of time, I would often wonder...did I do something wrong? Find myself apologising because honestly maybe I was being paranoid? Or so I thought.

We eventually moved out and found our own place to rent, life was good! Or so I thought,
It all started seeming off when she would stay at her parents and video call me most nights, I got to see her so it was fine, we chat say good night and go to bed. I found she needed space or something? What I fool I was.

So my partner told me one night she didn't want this anymore, out of nowhere! I was absolutely dumbfounded and heartbroken. Turned completely cold and blocked me on everything. This destroyed me but I told myself I would be okay.

We met up occasionally after this a few times over the course of 6 weeks, we even slept with each other

Then silence for 2 months until one day my father was pulling up in his car at my brothers and saw my ex parked at the end of the road, they made eye contact and she blanked him, my dad messaged me to let me know. Confused I was thinking ""is she stalking me or somthing?"" Then I hear a knock at the door, surprised it was her I was lost for words. She hugged me and came in for some coffee. I put the question to her why she was there, she told me she was there to buy a Vape...she left about 25mins later and it felt like she didn't want to be there.

Alarm bells were ringing but I wasn't sure. A week went by and I couldn't contain myself anymore. I decided to go down there and confront him. I had no real proof....but my gut was telling me somthing was really wrong. I went upstairs to his bedroom as he was getting changed..I noticed love bites on his neck, I did something I'm not overly proud or but I had to get the truth. I convinced him i saw messages between him and my ex..then he confessed.

I was in shock, he tried to apologise and even offer me money, saying it was mostly her bla bla bla, I died inside. I never have experienced such betrayal. We decided to take a drive down together and surprise her. We pulled up close.by to where she lives and he texted her as I sat in the back seat of my brothers car (she had no idea I was there) she skipped over to the car hot in the passenger seat and hugged my brother. She noticed me pretty quickly ""what's he doing here""

My brother filled her in on what I knew and she started going off. Turns out they were going on weekends together away, dates and were even developing feelings for each other. She confessed her self and didn't even apologise.. my brother remained mostly silent

I told my brother she was still meeting me and even slept with me..I watched her flat lut lie in that car last night...this was somone I trusted with my life lying and reviling me, she stormed out the car and went back to her place.

My brother and I agreed that we must keep her out of our life and we owe it to each other though somehow I am not fully convinced.

It's been a week since then....it's like a nightmare i can't wake up from.. I haven't left my home accept for the gym. 

My own brother and the love of my life.....I still cannot believe it. He was the golden child, he was the big brother who was meant to guide me.

I'm truly broken and feel like I'm in a dessert and I don't know which way to go, I'm not sure why I'm posting this here..I'm just all sorts of messed up and my life has been shattered.

After that I followed her on insta and later asked for a coffee , we met it was good. Then we used to chat in Instagram, I started mostly , she also used to initiate but very less. 

Then one day she suggested we should met again , we met it was good. I indirectly asked her about dating but she indirectly told no. I don't have a mad crush on her but I just want to try and see if it works. Then I sometimes use to message her when see puts some interesting story on Instagram. Then we again decided to met but due to time schedule , it didn't happened. 

Now today is single's day and she has put a story and I have messaged her giving her some major hint. I'm a very optimistic guy and i have done this but I don't think she will reciprocate, I was thinking whether I did the right thing or I'm being that cheppu guy.

1oua8ad,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1oua8ad/package_sent_via_dhl_cant_get_cleared_now_my/,Package sent via DHL can't get cleared. Now my girlfriend is forced to declare she is abandoning it so she doesn't face violations & fines.,"Sent a small box of christmas gifts to my girlfriend (some cute toys and keychains) and some of the SSDs I no longer need so she could use it on her PC since hers broke. After so many back and forths and providing receipts and whatnot, DHL Vietnam got back to her saying used electronics are prohibited and importing brand new items require licensing that they don't offer and which she has to apply by herself for. They said if she can't comply, she might get fined and a violation is recorded under her name.

Now we don't have a problem with that but during shipping, DHL inspected the contents of my box before sealing it and they knew exactly where its destination is gonna be yet they didn't let me know used electronics are prohibited and brand new items require more paperwork even if it's a gift. My girlfriend wasn't aware either because this is the first she's receiving a package from another country. We tried getting a customs broker but the coffee money is way too much: 200% the overall value of my shipment.

So DHL made her choose: 1. The shipment is returned to me and I pay for shipping returns cost BUT DHL will file paperwork regarding the violation and send it to customs wherein she faces fines up to 10M dong and she gets a case/charge/record for 2 years under her name.

2. She declares she abandons/refuses the shipment and DHL will handle the rest. Obviously it gets conveniently lost or destroyed and I don't get refunds. No penalties, no violations on my girlfriend's part.

Obviously we chose 2. There is no way I'll let her get a violation even though she insists on getting it but exporting/importing into Vietnam is a nightmare. I know this now. I'm just posting here if anyone else is like me, sending stuff for the first time. It's my fault for not doing enough research on the matter.",2,1762869743.0,VietNam,1,1.0,False

Make sure you give your best shot, and never, ever succumb to cheating. The OSI Police are in full force during this critical period, and you know it, through the Reddit threads that you would occasionally find how onerous these threats could be.

**You Are Not Alone & You'll Get Through This.** Know that you are not alone.

We all go through ups and downs and have tests or projects that don't go as planned. Never fear as bright days are ahead of you. Utilize this thread if you're feeling down and or want someone to talk to. We are all in this together and we're here for you and one another.

**There is a lot more to life than work and school.** Health, family, & friends always come first.

School is not the most important thing in life. Remember, Bs (and intentionally sometimes even Cs) give you degrees. Further, there is no shame in quitting OMSCS.

**Nobody cares about a perfect 4.0 GPA,** besides yourself.

The intention by the administrators is that **OMSCS should always be done part-time** so that you could explore things that you love and enjoy. Do not rush to graduate! Take time off, do something that you really like in the meantime, and come back stronger.

**So what if the current job market is thrashy?** Take it slow.

With a part-time program, this gives you the best of both worlds - you keep your cash flow, gain real-world experience (be it through internships, jobs, love, holiday, etc.), and let the *learning sink in*, properly. 

**We emphasise on 1 class a semester.** It's tried & tested. 

Why rush & then burn yourselves out for a piece of paper that won't guarantee stability? Mastery doesn’t come from cramming, it comes from building knowledge steadily, applying and reflecting them, and then positively and creatively reinforcing them. 

**Life’s not just a race.** Go at your pace. 

This is especially more so now when the track we are in keeps on changing. Your future self will thank yourself for it. And when all is done, post a new thread and celebrate with us.

* 🌿 **Lifestyle Reset** — Life moves slower here in the best way. People take time to chat. Families gather in plazas. I finally stopped running on fumes.
* 🌮 **Culture That’s Alive** — From tamales in the morning to mariachi at night, the vibrancy is constant.
* 💰 **Affordable, But High-Quality** — In Mexico City I spend \~40% less than I did in Denver, with better healthcare, fresh food, and specialty coffee.
* 🌞 **Sunshine** — Every. Single. Day. Enough said.
* 🤝 **The People** — Warm, welcoming, and generous. Neighbors check in, strangers help you navigate — the kindness here is unmatched.

1oua6r8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MAXNSQUEEZE/comments/1oua6r8/are_you_looking_for_purpose_of_human_life/,are you looking for purpose of human life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I'm a 26-year-old bean from Pennsylvania, just hoping to meet some new people and see where things go. I’m all about finding that natural, comfortable vibe where we can be ourselves and enjoy the little things in life.

A bit about me:

I’m a big fan of PC gaming (especially when I can team up with friends – I’m a good sport, I swear).

Coffee is my true love – if you’re into espresso, I think we’ll get along just fine. ☕

Lately, I’ve been trying to get more into outdoor stuff like camping, hiking, and fishing. I think it’s about time I take advantage of nature’s beauty.

When I’m not outside or gaming, you’ll probably find me painting Warhammer 40k miniatures (it’s my brain off time) or getting into some pixel art.

Now, let’s talk about my hobbies and passions :

I’m a huge Dungeons & Dragons fan – whether I’m playing or just creating characters, I’m all about the storytelling and roleplay. If you’ve got a campaign going, I’m always down to join!

Lord of the Rings is a world I can never get enough of. Give me a good Middle-earth adventure, and I’m hooked.



And if you love dinosaurs, we’re practically kindred spirits. I can talk about prehistoric creatures for hours (just try me!).



Physically, I’m 6’1”, have short brown hair, a beard, and glasses. I’m on the skinnier side, but I try to carry myself with confidence and humor. I guess I’m one of those “I’m not perfect, but I’m real” kind of people. Also I just got my gym membership yesterday! Time to not be so smol



What I’m looking for:

I’m hoping to find someone who appreciates the same mix of things – whether that’s a love for good coffee, getting lost in fantasy worlds, or just taking some time to appreciate the outdoors. A sense of humor is key, and I’m all about honesty and genuine connection. Whether you want to chat about Middle-earth, brainstorm D&D campaigns, or bond over a love of dinosaurs, I’m all for it.



I’m a pretty laid-back person, but I’m also someone who really cares about the people in my life. I value deep conversations, those spontaneous, silly moments, and just feeling at ease with someone. I’m not into drama or games – I’m here for something real and easy-going.



If you're into coffee, D&D, dinosaurs, or just looking for someone who’s kind, honest, and enjoys the simple things in life, feel free to reach out! I’d love to connect and see where it goes. <3

I'm a 26-year-old bean from Pennsylvania, just hoping to meet some new people and see where things go. I’m all about finding that natural, comfortable vibe where we can be ourselves and enjoy the little things in life.

A bit about me:

I’m a big fan of PC gaming (especially when I can team up with friends – I’m a good sport, I swear).

Coffee is my true love – if you’re into espresso, I think we’ll get along just fine. ☕

Lately, I’ve been trying to get more into outdoor stuff like camping, hiking, and fishing. I think it’s about time I take advantage of nature’s beauty.

When I’m not outside or gaming, you’ll probably find me painting Warhammer 40k miniatures (it’s my brain off time) or getting into some pixel art.

Now, let’s talk about my hobbies and passions :

I’m a huge Dungeons & Dragons fan – whether I’m playing or just creating characters, I’m all about the storytelling and roleplay. If you’ve got a campaign going, I’m always down to join!

Lord of the Rings is a world I can never get enough of. Give me a good Middle-earth adventure, and I’m hooked.



And if you love dinosaurs, we’re practically kindred spirits. I can talk about prehistoric creatures for hours (just try me!).



Physically, I’m 6’1”, have short brown hair, a beard, and glasses. I’m on the skinnier side, but I try to carry myself with confidence and humor. I guess I’m one of those “I’m not perfect, but I’m real” kind of people. Also I just got my gym membership yesterday! Time to not be so smol



What I’m looking for:

I’m hoping to find someone who appreciates the same mix of things – whether that’s a love for good coffee, getting lost in fantasy worlds, or just taking some time to appreciate the outdoors. A sense of humor is key, and I’m all about honesty and genuine connection. Whether you want to chat about Middle-earth, brainstorm D&D campaigns, or bond over a love of dinosaurs, I’m all for it.



I’m a pretty laid-back person, but I’m also someone who really cares about the people in my life. I value deep conversations, those spontaneous, silly moments, and just feeling at ease with someone. I’m not into drama or games – I’m here for something real and easy-going.



If you're into coffee, D&D, dinosaurs, or just looking for someone who’s kind, honest, and enjoys the simple things in life, feel free to reach out! I’d love to connect and see where it goes. <3

Shannon says that right now her life hasn’t changed much because Dollop just shits, eats and sleeps.
Apparently she’s thinking about bringing the kid on her tours.
Then she talks about Sabrina Carpenter, “she’s very sexy”  
Boring story about Amber’s wedding.. of course enow Shannon makes it about her and talks about the mirror on the floor at her wedding and everyone dying because they were roasting and James’   melt.

They talk about jobs and studies and how Bella is the only one in the family that wants a job and be in corporate.
 They talk about comedy and apparently Shannon will continue in it and will make a new special. Dear Media has a contract with Shannon for 40/50 weeks.
 Amber will have a Netflix special and they talk about it. She will also have a show in Knoxville.

1ou9xs0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1ou9xs0/thoughts_on_the_50_year_mortgage_from_someone_who/,"Thoughts on the 50 year mortgage, from someone who did the math","I posted this in another thread, but I thought it important enough to make its own post.  I'm expanding on the logic a bit in this thread.  

There's a lot of simple answers here, so let's do the math. For this example, I'm assuming a 90% loan on an US Median Home price of 423,100, at 6%, and ignoring taxes and insurance. 

* On a 30 year mortgage in the above scenario, the monthly payment is $2,283.03 and the total interest paid over 30 years is $441,100
* On the 50 year mortgage in the same scenario, the monthly payment is $2,004.5 and the total interest paid over 50 years is $821,908. 
* Since it's likely that a 50 year mortgage will have a higher rate (like the 30 does over the 15), let's raise the rate on the 50 year by .5%.  In that scenario, the monthly payment is $2,146.58 and the total interest paid is $907,156

Now, let's put that in real terms: adding another 20 years to your mortgage saves you $279 a month on your payment, but costs you $380,808 in interest over the life of the loan. That $279 savings is only $3,348 over 12 months. If you do the math, and most of you haven't, that's hardly a game changing amount. Most of you could cut out fancy coffee and save more than half of that a month. 

If the rates are .5% higher, then adding another 20 years to your mortgage saves you $136.45 per month, but costs you $466,056 in additional interest.  

It's a placebo. Sure, there's some idiots that would do it to save a few bucks a month, but they'll do it at the long term expense of reduced equity and the potentially being locked into a starter home for even longer. 

* On a 50 year mortgage, your paydown at the end of year 5 is only $7,016
* On a 50 year mortgage at a 6.5% rate, your pay down at the end of year 5 is $5,935
* On a 30 year mortgage, your pay down at the end of year 5 is $26,449

Short term, the benefit of this plan is minimal. Long term......it's financially devastating.  Is this going to have a dramatic impact on housing prices?  I don't think so.  Because, when you do the math, the savings are minimal on a monthly basis, and destructive over a person's lifetime.   ",25,1762868995.0,RealEstate,49,0.93,False

I’m a single mom of two (10 and 7) in Maryland, and I’ve been house-hunting with a $200k budget. I just found a home that at first I loved! Quiet one-way street, parking pad, nice yard, dishwasher, central air, finished basement, 3 bedrooms, and it’s a duplex so I only share one wall. The kitchen is beautiful and even has a cute little balcony off the back where I imagined drinking coffee while the kids play.

The seller is super flexible! Willing to accept $15k below asking, cover major issues, and maybe help with closing costs. They’re also putting on a brand-new roof before closing! Between that and my city grants, I’d probably only pay around $1k out of pocket.

I’m also dealing with a difficult custody situation, and this home is 9 minutes from my kids’ school (we currently live 30 minutes away in a large luxury rental). The drive has become exhausting for me and the kids, especially since I have an autoimmune disease and work from home.

The concerns:
• The kids’ bedrooms are tiny compared to our current ones.

• The house is old and sits on a hill. The porch and basement are noticeably sloped.

• The steps are very steep and narrow, which makes me nervous (again, I have a health condition).

• The second time I saw it unfurnished, I noticed all the imperfections. Small closets, no coat closet, only one full bathroom upstairs and a half bath in the basement.

• The basement made me feel dizzy and nauseous, like I was on a boat. That’s a problem since my work-from-home setup would be down there. I’d be down there most days.

• The house has been on and off the market for years. The owner bought it in 2014, rented it, tried selling in 2022 (went pending then fell through), and now it’s back again. The agent says the last deal fell through due to financing, but I’m skeptical.

I can’t tell if I’m being too picky because I’m used to my newer rental, or if I’m ignoring red flags. Part of me worries I’ll regret passing this up in this market, but another part of me can’t shake the uneasy feeling.

Would you go for it, or keep looking?

⸻

TL;DR:
Love the house’s location, price, and perks. Hate the slope, steep stairs, small rooms, and one bathroom. Feels like a great deal on paper but my gut feels off.",2,1762868962.0,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,4,1.0,False

I’m a design student researching how people *actually live* with plant-based products like **Oatly** — not just how they shop for them.

Many people still mostly use oat milk in coffee, even though it could fit into so many   
other parts of daily life — breakfast, cooking, snacks, desserts, etc.  
  
I’m trying to understand:

* What small daily moments with plant-based products still feel inconvenient, confusing, or less fun than they should?
* Have you ever wished there was a simple digital or interactive tool (app, QR, chatbot, whatever) that made those moments smoother or more enjoyable?

For context — I’m currently developing a concept called **“Oatly Talks Back”**: when you scan a QR code on the oat milk carton, it “talks” to you with short, funny comments or simple ideas for what you could make with it (coffee, smoothie, pancakes, etc.). It’s meant to make oat milk feel more personal and playful, not like another wellness or recipe app.

I’d love your honest thoughts:

* Would something like this make you smile or feel more connected to the brand?
* Or do you think a different kind of digital interaction would actually be more useful or meaningful in your daily plant-based life?

I used to think the office was just a normal busy place. Phones ringing, printers, people talking. No big deal. Then I got a few weeks of full remote.



The silence hit me like a spa day. I could hear birds. I could hear my own thoughts. I could actually finish a task without someone shaking a stapler next to my head asking “got a minute.”



This week I had to go in for one single meeting. Within 15 minutes I heard:

a chair squeaking like it was trying to send Morse code

three separate loud Teams notifications from the same guy

someone eating chips that sounded like they were stepping on gravel

a random coughing symphony



At home I work in peace with coffee and my plants. In the office I’m doing deep breathing exercises and questioning my life choices.



Remote work spoiled me and I’m never going back by choice.

1ou9p6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalenfield/comments/1ou9p6j/coffee_run_with_my_2nd_re_bike_turkish_market/,Coffee Run with my 2nd RE Bike / Turkish Market Perspective,"I totaled my moped which was my first bike at 17, and for three years I didn’t ride ever again until Royal Enfield entered the Turkish market. With their targeted price reduction to have a presence in the market, I convinced my father to buy a Hunter 350 for university commute. I only had it for 4 months, the J platform bikes are pretty slow for the Istanbul bridges and highways. The dealership took it back and traded me a brand new Interceptor which I love.

Royal Enfield (the company) did have a limited presence within the motorcycle community in Turkey because our most popular influencer, who passed away sadly, made a video about a specially imported Classic 500 and reviewed it. I’ll provide the link. But after 8–10 years Enfield officially entered the market and they became very popular with the 350 bikes, the Himalayan, and the 650 platform. Whenever I go out to school or just for fun, I always see at least 1 or 2 RE bikes.

I made a few changes to the bike:

* The stock seat was a pain for my balls. Replaced it with the Premium Touring seat — I recommend it to everyone, but it is taller than stock.
* I bought an aftermarket exhaust from the dealer. It sounds pretty good but has subpar build quality compared to the options you guys have in India :(

The GT and Scram belong to fellows that I met in a café, good chumps.

1ou9ngj,https://v.redd.it/bozbxmv3bm0g1,"Full weight loss results - 2 seasons in, 60lbs down, gained some skills, excellent cardio","**TLDR: It is basically calories in: calories out** \- but in my experience high carbs + high fats were a bad move and I did that for a decade, I over-ate and ate anything. Carbs make me hungry later, aren't satiating like fats, but offer benefits for energy and hydration and I found it's best to stay around less than 60g/day which is like two slices of bread. It can be a slippery slope. One chip leads to another. I've tried carnivore - lasted 3 weeks, caved and ate a breadstick with butter at 3am. I've been looking for ""the ideal human diet,"" but it's mostly just about being dynamic with hunger signals. If I eat more on one day, I'll adjust for the next. I try to eat intuitively now, with smaller portions, and just being mindful helps a lot, such as asking myself ""could I use less butter in this frying pan?"" and those things add up to a real result over a couple months. Another example, I stopped putting 16 teaspoons of cream in coffee - stopped having sugar in drinks - and started drinking orange pekoe tea with 2 teaspoons of cream. Now I'm not getting a sugar blast at 545am. I haven't had alcohol in 3 years, less than 2L of soda in 4 years.

I was 167lbs when I was 27, taking a year to go from around 280 to 167, by eating once a day and working a lot/heavy exercise. I'm turning 38 this month and all I've cared about lately is my health. 2020 hit and I ballooned to around 310 by 2021. I also quit benzo's then and stopped sleeping well for 4 years. This first weight loss attempt in Feb. 2024 was because on the last day of January I went to put my socks on and I nearly fell over from my leg hitting my gut. I felt so bad about not being able to do basic balance/movement stuff so the next day I started a 5 month long 1-hour daily walking ritual with my dog and lost 26-28lbs.

Current diet is eating a large avocado with olive oil and sea salt at noon-2pm, then dinner, meat and veg at 5-6pm. If I want a snack it's a full fat pork belly pork rind with a dab of diana's smokehouse bbq sauce. These things are like eating crunchy butter, too rich to have more than 5-10g at a time, and the serving size is 30g = 250kcal. Snacking on these I had a much better result than with plain popcorn because I'd eat 8-12 cups of it (300-500kcal, depending on butter/oil). The hand-in-bag motion disappears with full fat pork rinds, and they're highly satiating. Fasting 6pm to noon, but wasn't sleeping past 5-6 hours a night for 2 years - I had to rebuild my nerves. In the past 3 months I've been sleeping 7-9 hours, consistently at 730pm, waking 530am. I've reduced nicotine from 6mg to 1.4mg in the last 6 months in an effort to slowly taper and quit vaping after 10 years and it has worked without me noticing withdrawal, now lowering by 0.1mg every 3 weeks, mostly just to breathe better when biking.

I thought biking would make me lose weight, but walking seems to have done more even though I'm ugly breathing much of the time while biking. In 2024 I went from around 310 to 280 by doing a 1-hour+ daily dog walk from February 2024 to June 2024, then I bought the bike. No change in diet during all that walking. Due to not sleeping well and being excited about picking up the bike and riding it, I picked up the bike on a 1-hour sleep and during the first ride I went to get off the bike my foot merely grazed the ground to stop and my calf cramped so hard I couldn't walk home, I had to call a taxi van to get the bike home. I couldn't walk for a month so I started actually-biking in July 2024.  
  
I bought this Diamondback Highline 1 in June 2024 after Sportchek gave me a 20% discount on top of a 40% discount - I may not have bought the bike otherwise. Bought my gf a Diamondback Expresso at 40% off the following Christmas, and she rides with me 1/5th of the time. I thought it'd help me lose weight entirely, but saw weight gain from putting on muscle, and after 5 months of city biking-only I gained a pound but obviously that's too little to tell anything. I thought, man, just try calorie tracking - and it did work to give me an idea of portion adjustment - I quit that after a week because I felt like I could just wing it by then, going from having no idea what calories were in things to being able to guess pretty well anything to within 100kcal (which can be *the difference* in weight loss, so take that with a grain of salt). Yesterday I randomly weighed a pork rind and accurately guessed that it was *exactly* 17.5 grams so I've still got it. People say ""don't wing it"" - and I'd agree for the sake of, but I'm good on that... until I'm not.

I started a calorie deficit from Nov. 15th 2024 to the end of February 2024, losing 21lbs over the holidays, without biking, then maintained calories until 1 month ago, without a tracking attempt. I biked, walked and hiked a lot more in 2025 too, and started going into the woods exclusively in May 2025:  
  
(Approx.)

* **Nov 2024 – May 2025:** 1-hour daily walk in snow
* **May:** Mountain biking **2 hrs daily all month**
* **June:** Biking **3x/week (2 hrs)** \+ **1× 4-hour hike**
* **July:** Biking **1–2x/week (1–2 hrs)**
* **August:** Biking **1–2x/week (1–2 hrs)** \+ **1× 4-hour hike**
* **September:** **Injury recovery** (no biking) - went OTB
* **October:** Biking **1x/week (3–4 hrs)** \+ **1× 4-hour hike**
* **November:** **2 rides**, **3 hours each**

I didn't include any walks or rides to the grocery store which takes an hour, my only transporation being the bike. A toss up as I can walk my dog to the store.

**No weight loss after all those woods rides (with climbs of up to 40 meters on a ski hill). Arms and quads slightly bigger looking. Cardio is crazy good but can easily overheat on rides.**

**I've been in a calorie deficit for 25 days - 10lbs off.** All I did was stick to the avocado lunch/meat & veg dinner/pork rind snack plan, and it's working, without noticing much hunger. I expect this to taper off to -7lbs/month as I'm targeting an aggressive 1350kcal/day while my sedentary TDEE is 2434kcal/day with no exercise or 2789kcal/day with ""light exercise - 1-2 days/week"". With heavy exercise ""6-7 days/week"", 3500kcal/day. I've hit 15-20k steps during hikes. I've burned 1k+ calories during 3-4 hour rides. It seems as hard as I ride I get home and eat those calories back without even noticing, but I've heard that walking disrupts that eating-after-exercising which is why I'm doing this over the winter (because holidays + no biking). I tried a few city rides in blizzards last year (northern Canada) and it's even harder than biking in the woods on a hot day, it's way too difficult in terms of staying on the bike. I kinda wish I lived South.

My A1C has gone from 5.9 at 310lbs to 5.6 at 250lbs, with a goal of 5.0 and 170lbs. I expect to have more ups and downs, and being consistent is key - but that was hard for me after \~3 months, I was craving pizza. It's better to just be good at getting back on the horse than it is to cycle between ""failures and quitting"". Ignore the times you've failed and/or quit entirely; and just keep plugging away despite the setbacks. The only way is forward.

Blood panel in 2025, probably 6 months ago, only showed slightly low mean corpusular hemoglobin. I started using an iron frying pan to compensate, now awaiting recent blood panel results. 

Blood pressure was a big one. I was getting ocular migraines every 3 months, odd symptoms, and going to the ER and not getting real answers. At the docs/ER, I'd be at 160/90 during those 4 years of not sleeping well (there's an answer). Measured at home, averaged over a month in 2024 while I was city biking in the summer, 131/87 - so I do have ""white coat syndrome."" Last week, measured by a 3x accurate BP machine at the docs office, 124/78. I couldn't believe it because I'm still 250lbs. I believe this is from sleeping better (sunlight, routine, diet, exercise, supplements, cannabis/I've quit a month ago).

Supplements: B-complex once a week, 200mg magnesium biglycinate a couple hours before biking so my muscles don't over-exert. Other vitamins, lots of home made electrolyte drinks (probably too much sodium).

I'd say that digestion is very important as when your digestion turns sour from things like ibuprofen use or other medications you'll feel your mental health slipping away as you cannot absorb required B-vitamins etc, which makes you choose worse foods. Everything turns dark for me then, and I start taking a lactobaccilus rhamnosus capsule, a digestion pill that un-facks everything within a couple days of eating easily-digestible foods. I've had plenty of migraines in the summer from hot days and heavy exertion rides and have taken ibuprofen like once every week or two. Ultra-processed has gotta go to maintain good digestion; listen to your guts/energy levels and observe your toilet.

I'm seeing a dietician on the 19th to ask about lowering uric acid and bad cholesterol. I had gout on my big toe 3x in 2 years. It's so painful that words cannot even describe it. This is mostly due to being obese, but it's also genetic. There's some lasting joint damage, but I can still walk, hike and ride. I've noticed that when I consistently eat high sugar for a week or two (ice cream, flour in pancakes/crepes), it flares. Pre-2020, I didn't have so much as a cold since 2012, let alone any health issue. Being obese wwrrreecccks you.

If you're considering buying a bike for weight loss, ***just do it***, even though it doesn't exactly cause overall sustained weight loss; it just leads to, and compliments it. I'm sure my circulation is better overall and my muscles feel tighter/stronger. Your muscles use like 70-85% of your glucose after eating, 20-30% at rest, and helps stabilize blood sugar (and therefore eating habits). It helps you sleep too.",70,1762868258.0,MTB,8,0.99,False

He was in the class I TA'd for two semesters in a row, and he always came to my office hours with another friend. The other friend and I became pretty close and she and I hang out a lot to study, get coffee, etc. After the semester was over, I bumped into him over the summer and he asked for my number. Since then, we've hung out a couple of times, and our conversations are always really funny and sometimes they've verged into the more personal, getting-to-know-you territory. 

I want to get closer to him as a friend but it's hard for me to tell if he wants to as well or if he just wants to be acquaintances (just catching up every once in a while). He's always said yes to hanging out with me but no to studying with me (although neither of us study well with another person), but he never initiates over text, only if we see each other IRL, and IDK if that's just a guy thing. We just haven't seen each other a lot IRL since we don't have classes together. He always likes all my stories, responds almost instantly, but he just doesn't initiate hangouts over text. I want to know both 1. if he wants to be friends and 2. how to hang out more often to develop the friendship? I do think friendships in college are harder to develop if you don't see each other as often, but how can I gauge his interest?",1,1762868227.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Theres a small park right behind my apartment. Around 7 am I take my coffee and walk one lap before work. Almost every morning I pass this older man with a tiny fluffy dog. We dont talk. We always notice each other and do this polite mini wave. Like a tiny salute of respect. His dog always trots with purpose like they have a big meeting to attend.



Today something different happened. I stopped at a bench to tie my shoe and the dog walked up and sat right infront of me like a tiny guard. The man laughed and said she seems to like you. It was the first time I ever heard his voice. He told me the dogs name is Buttons cause she is cute as a button. Then he said have a nice day and walked off. That was it. But for some reason it made my morning warm.



It made me think about how many small characters exist in our everyday routines. The guy who bikes too fast on the trail. The person who always buys the same pastry. The crossing guard who dances while holding the stop sign. They are not in our lives, but they sort of are. They become background comfort.



Anyway I hope Buttons and the man live a great long life. Tomorrow I might bring a dog treat. Or maybe just keep waving. Not every connection needs to be a full friendship to matter. Some are just tiny pieces of routine that make the world feel less lonely.

Chapter One
An outcast stranger.
She was, as far as all who never knew her were concerned, an ordinary girl. Yet, this most mysterious of teenagers held a secret never suspected of her. Behind the fiery red locks of long and awesome hair, the innocent face, and the kind demeanour, the golden glow in her hazel eyes and her kindly smile, there lay an ability not yet seen by the residents of Oakwood, Devon, England.
 I was a young mutant, only just aware of my power. Yet, I already felt vulnerable and worrisome due to the reality of human prejudice and fear. I had, not one year ago, been subject to such cruelty at the hands of homo sapiens firsthand; kicked out of my own Beechwood home at the tender age of 14, and left to roam, with only my way with words, a literary passion, a kindness towards others, a deep sense of morality and my newly-discovered, potentially deadly ability concerning fire.
 As I lay out there, on the thin and well-mown summer lawn of the house of my best friend, the One Whom I Would Do Anything to Protect, when I first asked myself perhaps the most outlandish question I had ever asked; could it be normal to be a mutant?
 I lay there daydreaming, my eyes wearily closing, as if I were about to nap this summer afternoon.
 Then, he came out, merrily jogging through the open French doors, and enlivening my spirit. Jamie was only six years of age; some would think it strange that a girl of 14 should be friends with a boy so young. Yet, Jamie was more than just a friend. Even, he was more than just a brother - he was a son to me.
 “Come here,” I called out, affectionately. The young lad came over merrily, and allowed me to hug him.
 “Would you like to come over to the meadow with me?” I asked, remembering how he loved it when we played there, whether it was football, pond-dipping, playing in the mud, counting the birds, insects and other animals, or simply enjoying a leisurely walk together, with nature.
 “Yeah!” He exclaimed, in a joyous, boyish voice. He tugged at my arm, and I got up and began walk with him…
 The day involved much joy, conversation about anything from toys to the universe, a game of tag and the simple pleasure of smiling and knowing I was in the company of my one true friend. The afternoon was ours!
 As we continued our walk further, we engaged joyously in the sniffing of flowers and observation of the many insects; there was some sticky wrap on my face, and I poked it, only to notice a small spider, which I removed carefully and allowed to crawl away.
 Next, a yellow butterfly flitted from one flower to another.
 Then, there many a winged creature, in flight, in the air between bush-branches, hardly staying still for more than a few seconds.
 As the day set, I turned to Jamie and told him he’d better go back now. I accompanied him back, with joyous ambling followed by solemn walking. We bid goodbye and goodnight to one another, and to Jamie’s mother, and then parted ways for the night.
 Jamie’s mother, though she liked me, never allowed me to spend the night, on the account that she didn’t fully trust me, based on the fact that I was a mutant, and based on my specific power. So I usually slept nearby, on the wooden bench beneath the tree.
 I had just nodded off, when an acorn fell, disturbing my sleep. Perturbed, I shook it off and began to daydream. I was dreaming of my childhood, when I was loved by my family, and experienced nostalgia. I then sighed and yawned, before closing my eyes and following back asleep.
 I was awakened the next morning by the early birdsong and the scurrying of squirrels as they carried their acorns and met their mates, dashing along the grass and up the tree.
 I wasn’t sure what to have for breakfast that morning. I wondered if the local fishmonger might spare me some cooked sardines, as would often be the case. Then, I remembered it was Sunday, and his shop would be closed. None of the local restaurants would foster any compassion for a mutant.
 Then, I remembered that Jamie’s mother would sometimes prepare me some toast, so I decided to pay them a visit once more.
 I walked eagerly up the bricked path, paying a small amount of attention to the continued birdsong and the occasional drop of an acorn or branch. I even notice the summer’s sunlight reflected on the glass of the French doors!
 I knocked at the door of the Winslow household. I noticed Jamie’s mother (Mrs Winslow - widowed) as she approached, with a friendly smile. She greeted me and asked what I wanted. I explained that I only wanted food, and to see Jamie off to school. I used to attend the same school as him, but I got kicked out over fear of danger to the other students. Apparently, mutants are exempt from educational requirements here; we can be educated, but it is not law here. Most schools are afraid of the dangers we pose.
 Mrs Winslow, however, was not afraid - at least, not so afraid as to not invite me in or allow her son to be in my close company. She seemed to trust me as another parent to Jamie, as well as his best friend.
 The house smelled homely and inviting. Mrs Winslow had just lit some lavender incense and the conservatory, with its pale, soft cream colours and its homely, relaxing scent, along with its collection of books, VHS’s and DVDs stacked on the shelves and its little TV, had a very cosy feel. It was home…
 I followed Mrs Winslow into the dining room, wherein the scent of the fresh fruit in the fruit bowl on the oak dining table wafted up my nostrils. The oak floorboards creaked slightly as I and Mrs Winslow walked upon them. This dining room also had a relaxing area; a small area with a red, checkered sofa and some armchairs, along with a nice little coffee table, a few books and magazines and another TV.
 Mrs Winslow disappeared into the kitchen (which was to the left side, through a wooden door in the wall). She was only gone for about a minute. Then, she reappeared, carrying a small plate of two slices of buttered toast with jam and a small glass of orange juice.
 “Here you go, Firespit,” she said, kindly.
 I smiled happily. It was the first time she had called me by my newly acquired mutant moniker. I gratefully received the toast and the orange juice, and took my place at the table and began to eat the toast and sip the orange juice, its tangy and sweet flavour a simple indulgence of the day. The jammy toast was another indulgence of the day; the sweetness of the strawberry jam met perfectly with the creamy saltiness of the butter, which I enjoyed.
 I asked where Jamie was. Mrs Winslow told me that he was still getting ready. “Once you’re finished, could you please go upstairs and nag him to get a move on? The school bus will be here in about twenty minutes!”
 I nodded. When I had finished my breakfast, I dashed up the cream-carpeted and wonderfully carpet-scented stairs, past the fragrant bathroom and knocked on Jamie’s bedroom door.
 “Friend,” I addressed him, in the way that I often did. “The school bus will be here shortly. Please get ready.”
 “Coming, Firespit!” he replied. He always called me by mutant name. “I just need to put my school tie on, and then I’ll be ready!”
 Shortly afterwards, he rushed downstairs with me.
 He seated himself at the dining table, where his mother had placed a bowl of cereal and another small glass of orange juice, which he ate and drank quickly.
 “Did you brush your teeth?” His mother asked.
 “Yeah!”
 As usual, Mrs Winslow allowed me to use her toothbrush and toothpaste, providing I rinsed the brush afterwards.
 I then left the warmth and cosiness of the house, and walked past the bench, meandering towards town. I was greeted with a mix of, “Hey, Firespit” and suspicious and warning glares. Merely an unwelcome mutant in a human world, a freak in supposed civilisation, I wandered through the streets, which grew in energy and hustle-and-bustle the further I went. I would give anything to be accepted by society, but I had long since given up hope of society ever throwing its arms around my kind. To them, I was a dangerous freak.
 As I drew closer towards Sidmore Street and its associated residential areas, the energy began to switch from being filled with the noise and busyness of residents and visitors going about their days to a quieter, almost ominous energy that wasn’t sure I liked.
 The white van that had been seemingly following me for a few minutes suddenly pulled up and parked right outside the cinema, drawing its drive to a halt as its wheels screeched a little and its apparently damaged exhaust system puffed out another shot of strong-smelling fumes into the air. The energy and the apparent evil intent of its drivers grew evermore obvious, especially as one blonde-haired man in a black suit and leather jacket got out. He was quickly followed by another man, a great fat and brutish-looking bloke who just puffed out one last puff of smoke from his cigar. 
 My instincts told me to flee the situation, but my good sense somehow told me to back away slowly. I would not use my power unless I absolutely had to; there was no way I was going to make the image of my kind any worse than it was already. As I backed away slowly, the blonde man reached into what seemed to be some kind of holder on his belt and pulled out a shotgun. “Oh no,” I thought, as I attempted to make a quick dash. I made a move past the cinema, my heart pounding faster than their vehicle could run. I had heard of officials capturing and killing mutants before, rendering them powerless at the sight of the suspected mutants. I gasped and began panting like a dog, as I attempted to move out of danger’s way. I raised my hand to shoot my flame, but the gun that was pointed at me clicked and-

 Chapter Two
The laboratory.
My memory of what occurred in the next hour is completely blank and blurred, except for sensations; there was the tactile sensation of rough, gloved hands grabbing me and dragging me across the ground, a chemical smell and a few as since forgotten words uttered to and fro, as well as the roughness of the journey, as we appeared to go over bumps.
 As I sat there, completely bewildered in what appeared to be a cage, I began to cry. What had I ever done? Why was I here? Was I in jail?
 I had been ambushed and seized, kidnapped by and for the cruelty of humans. Was I going to die? Would Jamie and his mother come to rescue me? Would Jamie be put in danger through any such rescue attempt?
 As I looked around, I soon realised that I was not alone. There were loads of other people, presumably others of my kind, in rows of cage-like cells. My heart began pounding fast again, not so much for myself this time, but for the others. Many were bloodied and lying down, appearing to be dead or dying.
 “What is this place?” I asked. I received no answers. I could only assume the worst - I had heard of the government’s laboratories capturing mutants to be used and killed, in the name of public safety.
 The eerie silence was soon broken by the sounds of footsteps and the banging of doors. Another man appeared in one of the doorways, wearing a white suit and blue plastic gloves. He held a scalpel. He ignored the others as he walked past, addressing only me.
 “Mutant,” he said coldly, at first glaring and then smiling. “We can either do this the easy way or the hard way.” He produced some handcuffs from his pocket, and unlocked my cell door, thrusting it open and hitting me.
 The teenager backed away, and then came forward, making a dash out of the large cage and towards the door out of the room. Her abuser attempted to stop her, but the gifted teenager raised her wrist and shot a flame right out at him. The flame grew upon the screaming man, who attracted the attention of other staff, who came armed with fire extinguishers. As he cried in pain and the staff rushed to attempt to destroy the flames, the young mutant pelted down to the door on the other side of the room, escaping out into the hallway.
 I ran as fast as my legs could carry me. I felt so threatened that I ended up shooting my fire at some random staff members who were gathered in the hallway.  That was the first time I had ever harmed someone who had done no harm to me. The commotion grew as the remaining staff members attempted to extinguish the flames that grew and grew by the moment. I felt sure that soon the entire building would be alight. I would be free again, the others would be out of their misery and justice would be served. I indulged this pleasant fantasy as I ran and shot flames at a few more staff members. I indulged this fantasy until I came face-to-face with none other than my blonde-haired captor once again, as quickly drew his gun…
 That night, news programmes across the country told the horrifying news of an escaped captive at the Government’s Sellsmith Sciences Research Laboratory in Oakwood, Devon, intentionally committing arson at the facility, wounding at least five people, and causing three to be hospitalised in critical condition. A spokesman for the Government’s Mutant Control Department assured the residents that there was no possibility of the perpetrator escaping and the captured arsonist would be recaptured. Children, left in tears of fear by the news, were reassured that no one and nothing could harm them or their families in the safety of their communities…
 About half an hour later, I opened my eyes to find myself back in the cage. I attempted to shoot fire at the bars, but the flame simply fired back at me. “Must be fireproof,” I thought. Luckily, I had long since realised that I was fireproof as well.

I would sneak fiction books inside my Chemistry textbook and sit at the last bench reading. Romance, thrillers, British humor, fantasy, anything I could read. I fully romanticized a future filled with cozy bookstores, coffees, and a Darcy-like partner who would totally get my mysterious, bookish self. And my whole plan was to major in english literature.

Then I went to university where I ended up doing my undergrad in history and political science… and somehow just stopped reading for fun. I just couldn’t connect to books anymore. Well, I am doing a PhD in the humanities now, so I technically read a lot (or try?), but that’s academic reading, which is a whole different thing. Anyway, I’ve missed that part of me who genuinely wanted to read instead of having to and truly enjoy it. My partner of 7 years just doesnt even believe me when I say I used to be a sucker of fiction. He just cannot even picture it .

Well now, suddenly, after almost ten years, it’s back. I finished a book in five hours (it was short, but still), immediately started another, and then spent two hours making a list of books that match my current mood and life phase. Downloaded them to my kindle. Registered at my local library and I’m so so excited to go there tomorrow! I feel like I’ve officially re-entered my reader girl era.

Buuuut at the same time I’m so scared. I love it so much that I’m terrified it’s just another hyperfixation that eventually fades. I really don’t want that. Because as much as this feels like my adhd pattern, it also feels like I just rediscovered a part of myself I’d lost and was trying to revive all these years.

I don’t even know what my question is honestly. I just wanted to share this weird mix of excitement and anxiety.",7,1762868034.0,adhdwomen,4,1.0,False

I tend to take around 2 hours to drink my coffee and don't want to have my aligners out for that long, will I be ok with drinking my coffee over 2 hours and then straight after rinsing my mouth with mouthwash and brushing my aligners with a soft toothbrush and warm water?

He is very smart and works in marketing. He is also obsessed with “perfect communication.” Lately it feels like he is treating my normal texting like a work project. If I try to text my friend to ask if she wants coffee, he leans over and says things like wait let me see it first. Then he changes my message to be more “clear and concise.” Sometimes he will literally take my phone and rewrite the whole thing. Last week he changed haha to haha. because he said punctuation matters and made the joke look more intentional.



Yesterday I sent a voice note to my sister to check on her new baby. He stopped me half way and said I should redo it because I sounded unsure and that I should “smile during the recording so your tone is warmer.” I snapped and said I dont need a communication coach for texting my own family. He got offended and said he was helping me be the best version of myself. I told him it makes me feel stupid, like everything I say is wrong. He replied that I am over sensitive and that people appreciate messages more when they are well written.



I get that he likes words and cares about how things sound. But I just want to send texts without feeling like I am being graded. Since yesterday he has been pouting and said I was rude for not valuing his help.

**Memory Transcryption Subject: Asri Dalmali, Indonesian Minister of Space Operations**

*Date \[UTC\]: February 12, 2140*

There are decades when nothing happens, and there are days when decades happen, and the last several days were of the latter kind. We were among the limited states who has established contact with Venlil Prime.   
  
The multi-national structure without an unifying entity such as a more powerful UN has left us each with a very limited diplomatic bandwidth, though we still insist on establishing our own embassy instead of operating under the Chinese embassy, like most states on Asia. It will also make integration of our economy to the new interstellar trade and tech exchange much less rocky.

We do seem like the sidekick of China in global, and now interstellar politics, with the second greatest population, economy, and military contribution in the TGAMA, above Pakistan and Russia, but in reality, we do have a secret rivalry in many sectors, like space mining, military tech, industrial strength, cultural exports, and most importantly; we yearn for economic freedom.  
  
They were the ones that made us the strong economic tiger we are in this century, the same way USA made them in the last centuries. We were the main recipient of their outsourcing, and built the rest of our industry on that, in exchange for giving them the rights to all Indonesian electronics design for minimal prices, so they keep introducing new standards that make it harder for our competitive products to enter their market, then funnel their resources to the state companies that rival and outcompete us.

The Chinese claim they have been reformed into a benevolent democracy, but we look up north into the Philippines, and remember their intervention on their revolutionary government that seeked to secede from the TGAMA and restore their naval and territorial rights, limit foreign land ownership rights, and put laws against industrial pollution and for worker welfare into action. And see how comparable that month on Manila was, with what the Japanese have done to them 2 centuries ago. That was also their intimidation for us too, if we dare to deviate too far.   
  
*Their democracy is as faux as the Americans, and in their core, they are just as sinister. We manage to keep them in an arms length, not any closer, not any farther. Even I don't think I would be here if I didn't have contacts in the CCP, and constantly made compromises with them here and there.*

It is also difficult to deal with all the globalist sheepmen who constantly ask for the reasoning for our division, and then come up with conclusions like ""Predators could be just inferior at cooperating and instead they're heavily individualistic, clinging to tribal systems, therefore unable to form a global hegemony, no offense"" as if all the Arxur eating them aren't united under one dominion, as they claimed a hour ago. It eventually got a little tiring talking with some of the curious officers, so I retreated back

My secretary, who tagged alongside me in the 3rd American Diplomatic Expedition, sent by a larger spacecraft for 50 passengers returned back to our suite, panting. She's better at actually talking to people and convincing them to our points, so she was our face here. I ask

""Mrs. Yawena! How did it go? Are they finally opening contact with us?""

""Huh... Well, yeah.. Sort of.""

""Sort of?"" I asked as she tossed her shoes to the side, and grabbed the water jug on the kitchen counter, gulping down most of it.

""Ah... Each of the human diplomats were assigned with a single Venlil Federation diplomat. The gal assigned to me fainted after accidentally seeing my face. We talked a bit before and after that though.""

""So, you still see her, right? Can Indonesia be recognized by the Venlil Republic, even only by a single.. twitchy alien?""

""Well, not really. The Venlil government is still reluctant to recognize any human government anything more than a clan of the UN, so the whole humankind will be given one big embassy for all countries. They also refuse to deal with any country with less than 150 million residents unless they're part of a larger coalition or operate autonomous under a larger countries banner, ""major subdivision"" as they call it. We can expect East Timor, Papua New Guinea, and potentially Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand, and some Pacific island states to apply to be our autonomous territories if they wish to participate in interstellar trade and politics.

""Well, good for them. Let's see how long it lasts, until it all falls apart and Elias Meier expresses his concerns as the Arxur start devouring human children. Yeah we're predators too maybe, but other than that, we're far from fierce.""

""I remember you much happier and hopeful until the first contact. Come on, it can't all be doom and gloom, Ms. Dalmali.""

""I don't know, I believed the aliens would be something completely different, much more intriguing, much more enlightening, whatever they would be. Instead, they are just some cowardly furries and cannibalistic nazi scalies, who know only the rules of nature in space. Even the culture is kind of lacking, sure the different plants and some of the architecture is kind of intriguing, but everything is just disappointing.""

""At least we're literally standing in a tidally-locked planet... and its gravity makes even walking around hard labor. I was on the verge of passing out, and I swear to god if I keep talking, I will! I don't care if it never becomes night in here, good night.""

Yawena laid down on her bed, pulling the synthetic blanket on her. I could understand her, I get tired of talking too, maybe a little earlier than her. This whole mission was tiring, so I was going to do what I like to do.   
  
I got up and pour the ground coffee beans I brought with me to a cup, poured hot water and some sugar, and sit at the balcony facing away from the sun, that overlooks an inner plaza covered in massive alien bushes, away from the public eyes.

God, that coffee is bitter, yuck. I've unintentionally put too much coffee on the cup, especially for a coffee without milk and cream. Why couldn't some of them be weird fucks like us who normalized drinking milk post-infancy, and then made lactose-free milk for weird fucks without weird fuck ancestors, even more like us? It normally should be absurd thinking we had the same damn milk as the aliens, who definitely shouldn't be the same damn mammals as we are, but well, thanks to their lack of clothes, it was obvious they were. Weird fucks.   
  
The notification ping of my phones news app stopped my train of thought, I scheduled it to depart once again after I looked at the notification, to search ""~~Venlil~~ Venlil Primean mammal milk"" some time later. Thank god there isn't some emergency order that prevents any of us to research any potentially sensitive topics, and even forbids us from engaging in alien interactions if we find a loophole. Don't know where that came from.

""Almost 10 paws after human contact, what has changed?"" Oh, a Venlil video article! Well, because we're connected to their internet, because ours are 16 light years away, and it's like the pre-telegraph ages where only the sailors, we, carry any information from and back to Earth. That's cool to realize too. The 42:9 resolution is too small on the flat screen, so I cast it to the air, on a semi-circle holo display surrounding me. Hope my battery holds.

""The predatory visitors claim to have only the friendliest intentions, and they've repeatedly said so in all 3 of their expeditions to our planet, including this paw. Today, USA, the tribe that organizes the expeditions, has pledged military support, while Russia, India, and some smaller tribes under the EU, offered food donations, and an exchange program encompassing the whole Earth is in the works. The original Human astronauts from the first expedition has appeared in many programs in the state channel of VP and its colonies, espousing peace and understanding, and Governor Tarva is in support of their appearance, and ceased all contact with the rest of the Federation, to prevent information leakage. But what about the public? We interviewed the various residents of Dayside City, Dawn Creek, Tonalu, and Duskvalley about these bald tailless beasts:

""I.. am not sure. It would be bold, especially odd for a Yulpa, and well, hope I don't come off predator diseasey, but I am quite curious about them. A potentially benevolent predator species, like straight out of some tainted fantasy. Well, for the best of all of us, hope they're telling the truth."" *said a brown, menacing looking, quadrupedal creature with his dark gray tongue slightly sticking out, holding a bag, walking on a crowded and dense market street with his family of the same kind*

""You want peace, I want peace, so please stay peacefully in your den, humans! I swear to my father in the groves they'll redirect The Flow straight to their mouths and the next thing you know, Venlil Prime is just another dead, forgotten planet in the archives if it keeps going on like that. The freaks around here are more than enough for us already."" *said the weird, old looking venlil woman with short white-tan fur, who got up from a street-facing bench, looking pissed, swinging her walking stick on the air*

""You know what I think? I think the Exterminator Guilds must immediately coup d'etat the government, lock Tarva up in a High Security PD facility, and seek immediate Federation aid to exterminate the predator contamination in the Venlil Republic's 20 light year bubble."" *said a pitch black venlil protestor in a barely illuminated night-side city with an orange bandit mask covering under his muzzle, standing near an inactive spaceport gate with around a hundred or more protestors and riot police, a quarter of them in both sides are in gray hazmat suits, violent slogans against humanity and Tarva are loud in the air*

""WE'RE BRAHKING DOOMED THAT'S WHAT IT IS. We had no choice but to surrender, they're holding our government at gunpoint, foolishly expecting us to believe we're free and they're all preylike while LOCKING UP AND HOLDING US CAPTIVE IN OUR PLANET LIKE A BUNCH OF CATTLE!"" *said a young adult venlil woman with a white, dirty fur, leaning to the wall of an old low-rise office building-*

..the battery's dead. So, 3 out of the 4 still see us as irredeemable monsters, with 1 actively calling for our extinction. Fuck this goddamn universe I had to found myself in, and fuck me for being human, I guess. What are we even trying to do here, extending our hand to a rabid dog that wants to bite it off and piss on it and call themselves righteous for it? This whole arms race to invent FTL was fucking pointless, and all of our attempts at friendship is just futile. Even Tarva doesn't seem all that supportive except she's holding off the federation away from us, but for how long?

I should just go lay down and find something to distract myself. I stepped in back to our suite; but -*ohshlsxlfasdgghhhfh-* stumbled and hit my pinky toe on the leg of a table. The empty cup slipped from my fingers, loudly breaking on the floor. as if everything was going anything resembling alright..

The noise woke up Yawena, and she groaned and stretched. ""wh-whats.. don't make noise!"" she said with her natural, odd accent, after all she was a Jewish-Papuan who knew 7 languages and Indonesian was most certainly not her native one. I don't have a clue how did she get into a heavy sleep that quick, but it seems like she did. She leaned forward, stared to the floor, and then me, and talked in a more proper accent:

""..You look even more upset than when I was awake, and it doesn't look like it's because of the cup, so what's up now?""

""Its just, do you feel like no matter whatever you do, what you say, it's all pointless, like you're just talking to a brick wall that despises you and won't bulge at all? You get what I am saying?""

""Don't hurt my head with metaphors, I know it's about the aliens. You know how it went with the Venlil diplomat?""

""You said she fainted.""

""She was extremely skittish, didn't want to stay anywhere close to me, was hardly speaking, and kept looking for a way out in case I get aggressive.""

""That's the thing, they just look at you and don't listen what words come out of your mouth, they just see a big bad monster that wants to eat them, you can't reason-

She stick out a finger to ""shush"" me, and continued: ""We walked into her office, and while she was looking for a form there, I unknowingly brought myself too close to her back, and when she saw me like that, she fainted. I carried her to a first-aid room, and called for medical assistance. After she woke up as I was bringing a venlil nurse to her, she was much less stressed around my presence, knowing I wouldn't let harm come to her even at her most vulnerable, and I was a reliable person. She just needed to be assured of that.""

""So you're saying?""

""All we need is time and patience, and as we go around, I am sure the universe will warm to us. After all, we aren't the man devouring menaces they fear we are. Now, good night Ms. Dalmali, and please make minimal noise to avoid interrupting my most serene slumber."", immediately falling back to her bed with her last word.

I slowly collect the largest shards of the broken glass, pull a smaller, empty table above the rest, and put the shards on the table, hopefully signifying a warning about the smaller shards to a room maid that would come to clean the room. I felt more hopeful, that we would finally be able to be understood, and be cherished by the galaxy, who doesn't judge us by what we are, but by who we are.

I then silently retreat to my bed, plug in my phone. I remember, I forgot looking at the internet about alien milk, which I was curious about earlier. After charging my phone a little for a few minutes, I boot it up, open the Internet, and search for it.

Yup, as much alien as any other mammal on Earth, with the same ol' lactose. Dear god, give misery to these unoriginal lifeforms.

It was a quick decision once I decided to dive into Espresso rabbit hole - no real competition there. Bambino plus seemed like a Chinese plastic toy compared to the beautifully designed and solidly built Gaggia, with all metal construction and new brass boiler. More of a pro machine than a kitchen appliance like Sage/Breville.

But now comes the hard part - deciding between the grinders. I narrowed down to the 4 options which I can afford.

1Zpresso J Ultra - Eur200

DF54 - Eur200

Kinu M47 - Eur300

DF64 - Eur300

Now, grinding manually is not an issue for me. Been grinding for years manually for V60 and Aeropress with Timemore C2, and it's been a breathe. I'm as fit as an elite MMA athlete and can deadlift 3x my bodyweight, so extra biceps workout is always welcome. 

But I don't want to miss on the quality of Espresso shots (maybe flat burrs of DFs have edge there..). In other words, I want to chose the grinder which will give me the best possible Espresso among these options. I tried recently DF54, DF64 and Kinu in the shop. I was blow away by the quality of Kinu - such a beautiful and solid thing. Although DFs didn't look slouch either and their noise level is not a bother for me. Pls advise which of these can give me the best possible shots. (Medium to light roast, third wave coffee (mainly central African) chocolaty espressos with sweet fruity notes are my fav). I don't like Italian style espressos and dark roast beans.

1ou9faz,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1ou9faz/the_underrated_discipline_hack_the_5minute_brain/,"The Underrated Discipline Hack: The 5-Minute ""Brain Dump"" Before You Open Your Laptop","I’ve finally figured out the single biggest sabotage mechanism for my entire day, and it wasn't laziness, poor planning, or lack of coffee. It was the friction between the chaos in my brain and the blank page on my screen.

Every morning, I'd open my laptop, see the thousand pending notifications, the emails, the to-do list, and I’d immediately get hit with a wave of decision fatigue. My brain would throw up an internal protest, and I’d resort to the classic coping mechanism: scrolling my phone for 30 minutes to get a quick hit of dopamine before facing the real work.

The Solution: The 5-Minute ""Brain Dump""
I implemented a non-negotiable rule that has completely changed my mornings and boosted my deep work capacity: Before I touch my laptop, check my phone, or even think about the first real task, I take five minutes to do a simple Brain Dump.

I use an actual paper notebook for this, the friction of opening an app defeats the purpose.

Here is the quick, 3-step process:

1• The Panic Inventory (2 Minutes):
 I write down everything that is currently causing me low-level stress or anxiety. It’s a complete free-flow of thoughts: I need to call the dentist. Don't forget the dog food. That awkward email I sent yesterday. What should I make for dinner? This externalizes the internal mental clutter.

2• The Priority Funnel (1 Minute):
 I look at the chaos I just wrote down and circle only the three most important things I must accomplish today (work or personal). This gives the day a simple, focused target.

3• The ""Close the Loop"" Statement (2 Minutes): 
 I then write one final sentence that closes the loop on the negative thoughts: ""My concerns are noted. I will deal with them after my main task is complete."" This is the signal to my brain that the inventory is finished, the worries are filed, and it's time to transition.

The Power of the Reset Button
This process takes less time than making a cup of coffee, but it functions as a mental reset button. It clears the noise and allows me to approach my actual work desk with a sense of intention rather than reaction. When I finally open my laptop, I'm not reacting to the notifications; I'm immediately executing the pre-approved priority task.

If you struggle with morning procrastination or that feeling of being instantly overwhelmed, try giving your brain a full five minutes of externalized peace before you engage with the digital world.

Wet cat food has been pressure cooked and canned, so it's lost most of the nutrition.
I did some research on all the nutritional needs of cats and then researched what foods you would have to use to get your cat full range of optimal nutrition.

Here's the recipe:

Chicken thighs 2 lb
Chicken hearts & gizzards 1 lb
Freeze dried liver 36 g
Eggshell powder 1 tsp
Sardines (in water) 1 can or 1 tsp salmon oil 

Simmer chicken parts together gently until 160 F. Separate thighs from organs. Cool quickly and then remove bones, gently shred meat. Throw organs, liver, eggshell powder, and sardines into a blender with a splash of the cooking broth and blend to a paste, then gently but thoroughly mix into shredded chicken.

Keeps 3-4 days in the fridge or 3 months in the freezer, longer if you vacuum seal it.

Bone in chicken thighs are cheap. Chicken hearts and gizzards are even cheaper. Freeze dried liver is cheap if you buy it in bulk(can be bought as dog treats but it's still freeze dried liver) eggshells are literally free if you eat eggs, just take the shells, bake them till they're dry and throw them into a blender or coffee grinder until it's a fine powder. 

This recipe is actually CHEAPER than canned food, healthier for them, and most cats go CRAZY for it. Only downside is the prep time but after the first couple times you get efficient at it. 

IMPORTANT: measure the liver per batch CAREFULLY. It's high in vitamin A and too much could become toxic. Get a gram scale, do NOT eyeball it

Since you're using all human-grade ingredients you can keep the broth and either let your cat drink a bit of it as a treat or drink it yourself.

Of course, purity culture, no sex or kisses before marriage. Since I was 13 I was dreaming a lot about my marriage, always had crushes on someone. And then nothing (no relationship) ever happened. Of course, it’s been a lot of first dates, talking phases. 

After a while I realised it was not a big choice in our community. And by the age of ~27 I started slowly stepping back from church. And trying dating apps very low-key (it was always just coffee dates, no physical things involved). 

And in my mind it was hard to step away from the image of an amazing christian man I always planned to get together with. Or I kinda wanted to meet someone trustworthy, etc., but not a christian. 
So I still haven’t dated (been on dates a lot, a lot of guys asked me on a second date but I just didn’t feel connection). I am of course really interested in sex, and was offered a few times haha, but can’t really jump into bed with a stranger (even tho my fantasy brings me there sometimes). I guess I am demi-sexual, so I need to build trust first in order to have sexual attraction and desire to touch someone. 

If you also were christian, did it affect your dating life in a bad way? Like, you can’t choose to like someone really bc your image of relationships was very different and the standards were too high.

I get this weird guilt like someone is gonna pop out of a corner and yell gotcha. When I was in the office I used to walk to another floor to chat with a coworker or take a lap around the building and nobody cared. At home if I step away from my laptop for even a tiny bit I feel like Im slacking and everyone will assume Im not working at all.

Last week I noticed I didnt even eat lunch. I was scared to leave Teams green status for more then a couple mins. The funniest part is my manager doesnt micromanage. She literally told me to take breaks and that she trusts our output. Still my brain acts like some invisible boss is watching through my webcam.

I started timing my breaks and writing them down so I feel like its legit. Its dumb but it helps. I also moved my workstation away from the kitchen so grabbing snacks doesnt feel like a full escape mission. Anyone else dealing with this? Do you have tricks to stop feeling guilty for just being a normal human during a work day? I know remote work gives freedom but I didnt expect the mental part to be this hard.

Came to a ward where the charge for the doctors' office tea fund is £20 per four month rotation. Apparently nobody was paying in until this month. Opinions amongst the SHOs are divided. F1s have decided not to enjoy tea or coffee at work to keep their heads down and not cause trouble. Consultants and registrars seem to dip in without paying.

£20 sounds like a lot, but that's £5 per month, and sometimes there are biscuits. What I'm less happy about is SHOs funding freebies for their seniors. Naturally only the F1s and SHOs have been targets in the non-payment crackdown.

At home we aim for a double espresso around 60 ml and a caffè crema around 200 ml, and I’m trying to understand whether those volumes make sense as baselines with espresso-roasted beans on the Jet.

My spouse prefers less caffeine, so I’m testing both baskets: the single 12 g basket for her and the double 20 g for me, which complicates dialing in since grind/timing swing quite a bit between the two.

I did take some measurements :

|Beverage|Single basket 12 g|Double basket 20 g|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Espresso/Americano 60 ml — 25–30 s|Grind setting 34, 22 s; Grind setting 33, 27 s.|Grind setting 22, 37 s; Grind setting 24, 24 s; Grind setting 25, 21 s; Grind setting 28, 16 s.|
|cafe crema 200 ml — 25–35 s|Grind setting 38, 99 s; Grind setting 40, 80 s; Grind setting 44, 66 s; Grind setting 54, 64 s.|Grind setting 32, 78 s; Grind setting 36, 76 s; Grind setting 38, 78 s.|

**Questions**:

1) For espresso and Americanos, is this 25-30 sec a valid starting point for 60ml?  
Hence, use Grind 33 for 12g but Grind 24 for 20g?   
  
2) For cafe crema, would you run a longer, lungo‑style shot on the Oracle Jet and treat beverage volume as the key target, or is there a better ratio/time approach that works consistently with espresso roasts.  I am lost on what at all should be the target extraction time. At grind 33 it tasted fine, but took 90sec to get done. Not even sure if one should use cafe crema at all or rather try with Americano",1,1762866762.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,1.0,False

Saturday morning, Mary and I strolled up Bath Avenue to Nick's Candy Store on Bay 16th Street, grabbing a couple of buttered rolls and coffees.

We ate at the counter, savoring the warm, doughy rolls and the rich brew before heading back home.

The air carried a slight chill, maybe 58 degrees. I threw on a sweatshirt, Mary wore a light sweater, and Nick's strong coffee hit the spot perfectly.

By the time we reached the apartment, the phone was ringing. Mary fumbled with her keys, rushing in before the caller hung up.

""Oh, hi, Angie!"" she said, her voice bright. ""That's amazing news! I'm so happy for you. How'd Jeff take it?""

""Just like I figured,"" Angie said. ""Freaked out at first, totally blindsided. But I calmed him down. He'll be fine.""

""Sounds quiet up there,"" Mary said. ""He doing okay now?""

""He's out walking Lucy,"" Angie replied. ""He wasn't thrilled at first, did it grudgingly. Now he loves her to death. Takes him a bit to come around.""

""Good. I'm so glad,"" Mary said. ""I can't wait to tell Gerry.""

Mary hung up. I was sprawled on the couch, catching every word.

""What's going on?"" I asked, raising an eyebrow.

""Oh my God, amazing news!"" Mary said, eyes sparkling. ""Angie and Jeff are having a baby.""

I sat there, stunned for a second. ""I was with Stein Wednesday. He didn't mention anything about Angie being pregnant. Said he couldn't even think about kids right now.""

""Angie was having morning sickness,"" Mary said. ""She suspected but waited until today to take the test.""

""And it was positive, obviously,"" I said. ""So you knew?""

""Yeah, I knew,"" Mary said, a little defensive. ""But it was Angie's secret, not mine. I waited for her to tell Jeff before saying anything to you.""

""Hey, that's fine,"" I said, raising my hands. ""None of my business anyway.""

""Of course it's your business,"" she countered. ""They're our best friends. It's wonderful news. I thought you'd be a little excited.""

""I am,"" I said. ""I'm thrilled for them. Gonna love that kid. How'd Stein take it? Did she need to call an ambulance to sedate him?""

We cracked up, the weird tension melting away. Truth was, secrets weren't supposed to exist between us—but Stein, Danny, and I kept plenty from our girls too.

""Angie said he took it better than she expected,"" Mary said. ""Surprisingly well.""

""I'm heading over,"" I said, standing. ""You coming?""

""I haven't even showered yet,"" she said. ""Go. I'm sure he'll be happy to see you.""

""Yeah, I'll drag him to Danny's to break the news. Surprised he hasn't called yet, but he's probably still wrapping his head around it.""

""Tell them we'll take them to the Vegas Diner tonight,"" Mary said. ""Our treat.""

""Will do. Maybe Danny and Diane will join, and we can hit Ernie Barry's to celebrate.""

""Angie'll love that, even if she's off liquor while pregnant,"" Mary said. ""Lots of changes coming.""

She pulled me in for a hug and kiss before I headed out. Couples argued—it was part of the deal. Mom and Pop would be yelling one minute, lovey-dovey the next. Mary and I weren't there yet, thankfully.

I hopped in the car and sped down 17th Avenue. At a deli, I grabbed flowers for Angie and cigars for Stein, Danny, and me.

I parked up the block on 66th Street. My buddy Vinny was on his stoop, and we traded quick Mets talk—our ritual since we were eleven. I cut it short and headed to Stein's place.

They buzzed me in, and I took the four flights two steps at a time. Angie opened the door, I handed her the flowers, then scooped her up and spun her around.

""Thank you, Gerry, but put me down!"" she laughed. ""With my morning sickness, I might puke all over you.""

Stein came out from the kitchen, Lucy bouncing at my feet. I scratched under her chin, then pulled Stein in for a bro hug.

""Can you believe it, Gerry?"" he said, laughing nervously. ""Me, Steinberg, a dad.""

""Six months ago, I'd have bet against it,"" I said. ""Now? Feels right. You've done a hell of a job with him, Angie.""

""Soon I'll have two kids to wrangle,"" she teased. ""Coffee, Gerry?""

""Actually, I'm stealing Jeff to break the news to Danny,"" I said. ""He'll be as stoked as we are.""

""Go for it,"" Angie said. ""Get him out of my hair so I can clean.""

""Let me grab a sweater, and we're off,"" Stein said.

""Angie,"" I added, ""Mary and I want to take you guys to the Vegas Diner tonight, then Ernie Barry's to celebrate.""

""That's so sweet,"" she said. ""I'm in. Just sticking to seltzer for a while.""

""You don't need liquor,"" I said. ""You're glowing.""

Stein and I walked up the block and knocked on Danny's basement door. It was unlocked, as usual.

""Let's head upstairs,"" I said. ""Steinberg's got an announcement.""

""Hey, guys,"" Patsy said from the kitchen. ""Fresh pot of coffee. Sit.""

Danny strolled in, eyeing us. ""Alright, what's the big deal?""

Patsy poured coffee, and the caffeine hit just right—I'd been running around all morning and needed the boost.

All eyes turned to Stein. He stood, cleared his throat. ""Angie and I are having a baby.""

Patsy lunged across the table, kissing his cheek and squeezing him so tight his face turned red. ""Oh, Jeff!""

Danny shook his hand with a smirk. ""Congrats. You guys are really something. Once Diane hears this, there'll be no living with her.""

""Danny, that's what you're worried about?"" Patsy scolded. ""This isn't about you—it's about Jeff and Angie. And it'd be my dream to be a grandma,"" she added, her eyes glistening with tears.

""Ohhh, see? That's what I mean,"" Danny groaned.

I passed out the cigars, and we lit up. Three puffs in, we were coughing and crushed them out. Another toke and we'd have been hurling.

After finishing our coffee, we said goodbye to Patsy. ""Tell Angie I'm thrilled for you both,"" she told Stein. ""I'll have you over for dinner soon.""

""Thanks, Patsy,"" Stein said. ""She'll love that.""

""Let's move,"" Danny barked, slipping into full General mode.

We marched to the club. Angelo was at the poker table. ""How much do I owe you?"" he asked, half-hoping we'd lowball him.

""Two hundred each for me and Danny,"" I said.

""Alright, a hundred forty each,"" Angelo corrected, citing the real amount. ""Now make a bet.""

""Same as last week,"" I said. ""Forty-two dollar parlay on Florida State and Notre Dame.""

""You, Stein?"" Angelo asked.

""I gave you all my winnings back last week, Ang,"" Stein said. ""I'll wait to bet on my Jets tomorrow.""

""Put forty-two on Florida State and Notre Dame for Stein, too,"" Danny said. ""Call it a baby gift.""

""Baby?"" Angelo said, looking up. ""You're having a kid, Stein?""

""Yeah, just found out,"" Stein said.

Angelo stood and poured shots of Absolut. ""Salute,"" he said, raising his glass.

""Salute,"" we echoed.

It struck me how ironic it was—betting football and celebrating life under the same roof. Only in our world could a new baby and a parlay share the same toast.

We agreed to meet at the Vegas Diner tonight for dinner on me and Mary. Danny said he'd bring Diane, then we'd hit Ernie Barry's to celebrate.

As we left, we split up to head home. The news of a new addition felt electric, but the old crew—Stein, Danny, me, even Angelo—was still pretty damn good. Life was shifting around us, but the heart of it all hadn't changed.

Chapter 14

Mary slipped into a tight black dress that hit just above her knee, perfect for our night out at Ernie Barry's. I threw on pleated black Dockers and a sharp dress shirt, and we were set.

We met Stein and Angie at the Vegas Diner, where they were waiting outside, having just arrived. Mary, buzzing with excitement since hearing their news, rushed to Jeff, hugging him and planting a kiss on his cheek. ""Hi, Dad,"" she teased. Jeff's eyes misted as he hugged her back tightly.

We waited fifteen minutes for Danny and Diane but finally grabbed a table, figuring they'd be late as usual. We settled in, scanning the menus. I went with my go-to, chicken Marsala, while the others picked their favorites.

Danny and Diane showed up just before the waiter took our orders. ""We know what we want,"" Danny said, brushing off his delay with a vague ""finishing some business.""

They both congratulated Angie and Jeff on their news. Diane was bubbly, in high spirits, a contrast to the tension that had been flaring between her and Danny lately, sometimes making things awkward.

""I can't believe we won today,"" Jeff said, grinning. ""We could ride Florida State and Notre Dame all season.""

""Nah,"" I said. ""Next week, we're skipping the Irish—they're at Michigan. I'll get the kid to pick another team.""

""My heart was in my throat the whole game,"" Mary said, now a seasoned weekend bettor. ""Stanford made it way too close for comfort.""

""The football gods were smiling on us,"" Danny said. ""Even the Steinberg mush was on hold with the baby news."" We all burst out laughing.

Diane leaned toward Angie. ""You look stunning,"" she said. ""I can see that motherly glow already.""

Angie blushed, smiling. ""Thanks. Honestly, I've never felt better. It's like I've always got company.""

""Do you talk to the baby?"" Mary asked.

""Oh, yeah,"" Angie said. ""I tell 'em, 'Careful not to kick too hard, 'cause once you're out, I'll kick you back!'""

We roared with laughter. Angie always knew how to land a punchline.

I offered to cover dessert, but everyone passed. I picked up the check as a baby gift for Jeff and Angie, feeling extra good knowing Angelo's payout was footing the bill.

We met at Ernie Barry's in Bay Ridge, a lively spot where finding one parking spot is a challenge, let alone three. As lifelong Brooklynites, we're used to it—it's just part of the deal.

I parked a couple of blocks away, but the crisp fall air felt good after a hearty meal, making the short walk worthwhile.

I was the last to arrive, no surprise since Angie and Danny drive like they're auditioning for NASCAR. Mary teased me, calling me a ""right-lane cowboy.""

The bar was buzzing when we walked in, our crew already holding court. We squeezed in between Angie and Diane, and I tossed a twenty onto the pile, ordering a Bud Light for myself and a vodka cranberry for Mary.

A local oldies band, The Fines, was set to play later, promising doo-wop from the fifties and rhythm and blues from the sixties. For now, Yvonne Elliman's If I Can't Have You blasted through the speakers, keeping the crowd in a festive disco mood. The dance floor was alive, and it wouldn't be long before Mary and Angie joined the fray.

I chatted with Steinberg, who was trying to convince both me and himself that he was ready for fatherhood. I reminded him his fallback plan was simple: Angie would handle most of the heavy lifting, aside from a few errands.

""Can you imagine me changing diapers?"" Steinberg said. ""I'll probably put it on backwards or upside down.""

""Just make sure the tape goes on the diaper, Stein—not over the baby's mouth.""

We both cracked up when I felt a slap on my back. I turned to see Andre, decked out in one of those work suits he didn't need to wear, looking like an eight-year-old posing for a class picture.

""Long Island Iced Tea!"" I yelled into the bartender's ear, knowing Dre's go-to drink. The bartender mixed it like a wizard, five liquors splashing into the glass so fast I barely caught his hands moving. I handed it to Dre just as he opened his mouth to order.

""How'd you know what I wanted?"" he asked, deadpan.

""It's not like I just met you,"" I shot back.

Mary was beside me, deep in conversation with her cousin Linda, Aunt Terry's daughter. Linda was a spitting image of Mary's mom, Dolly—shorter, with strawberry blonde hair, a bubbly, sweet personality, and an infectious laugh. Mary, tall and slender, got her looks from her dad's side.

My head swiveled like I was at the U.S. Open, glancing between Andre and Linda. This could be it, I thought—a match made in heaven. But I had to play it cool. Andre had top-tier boyfriend potential but crippling social anxiety around women. His first instinct was always to bolt when one got too close.

""Linda!"" I called out, cutting Mary off mid-sentence.

I pulled Linda into an awkward hug, positioning her against Mary's back with me sandwiched between her and Andre.

""Too tight!"" I said, stepping back. Mary shot me a look like I'd lost my mind. I slung one arm around Linda, the other around Andre, and pulled them together to face each other.

""Linda, this is my buddy Andre,"" I said. ""Andre, Mary's cousin Linda.""

Linda, ever warm and welcoming, greeted Andre with a bright smile. To my surprise, he didn't freeze up. Instead, he went straight for a compliment. ""You've got pretty hazel eyes,"" he said, and I could've sworn the air sparked.

""Let's dance,"" I said, taking Mary's arm and steering her toward the dance floor.

""But I was talking to Linda before you cut us off,"" she protested.

""You're not talking to her now,"" I said. ""Besides, she looks pretty happy getting to know Andre.""

We hit the dance floor, twisting to Chubby Checker's The Twist. Angie and Jeff spotted us and joined in, spinning round and round. Diane jumped in too, grooving solo, while Danny, too cool for school, stood at the bar, itching to bolt for Pastels.

The next song kicked in—Mel Carter's Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me. I pulled Mary close, and Jeff did the same with Angie. We swayed slowly, lost in each other's eyes.

I glanced at the bar—Andre and Linda were gone. I scanned the club, but they were nowhere in sight. Then someone bumped my back. I turned to see Andre and Linda, locked in a close embrace, swaying awkwardly, gazing at each other like lovesick teens at a prom.

""You seeing this?"" I whispered to Mary.

""Oh, I'm seeing it,"" she said, unsure what to make of it.

When the song ended, we headed back to the bar. Linda and Andre drifted to the far end, wrapped up in their own world.

""Look at what you've done to my cousin,"" Mary said. ""I barely recognize her.""

""Same with Andre,"" I said. ""They're staring at each other like Sam and Jake at the end of Sixteen Candles.""

Danny and Diane bailed around 1 a.m. for Pastels. It was nice seeing them civil for once.

Andre and Linda slipped out without a goodbye. I'd have to call him tomorrow to get the scoop.

We finally said goodnight to the expectant parents.

""Thanks for an amazing night,"" Angie said. ""I can't remember the last time I had this much fun at a bar without drinking.""

We hugged and kissed, then headed our separate ways. We'd celebrated Angie and Jeff right, and maybe—just maybe—Andre had found his soulmate.

Chapter 15

I was knee-deep in a trouble ticket for a manual ring-down circuit for Tullet and Tokyo, one of our biggest clients. When their circuits went down, getting them back up was priority one.

I was on the line with one of their site techs, who confirmed he could see my seizure, meaning I could ring him, but we couldn't hear each other when we tried to talk.

They had several Verizon channel banks on-site. I tested a loopback on the AT&T side from our closest central office and got a good signal, but the loop closer to the customer's premises failed.
I opened a ticket with our Central Office to check for a bad channel card at Broad Street, pretty sure that was the culprit.

The Tullet tech was relieved and said he'd update his brokers. ""Hopefully, it'll be fixed within the hour,"" I told him, and I could hear the sigh of relief over the line.

I was updating my ticket log when I caught Stan chatting with Debbie, their usual morning thing. What wasn't usual was her slipping her hand inside his open shirt, rubbing his chest. 

Debbie's face held a curious, almost clinical look, while Stan's expression screamed he'd just died and gone to heaven.

I had to rewrite my log entry—too distracted, I'd left the caps lock on.

Later, I saw Stan, still dazed by Debbie's touch, drift over to the DEX terminal at the corner table. My curiosity got the better of me—Angie'd call me a yenta for this. I strolled over.

""Checking a cross-connection, huh?"" I said. ""Think that's the issue?""

Stan looked up, lovesick-puppy written all over him. ""Say that again, Gerry. Wasn't listening.""

""I'll bet,"" I said, grinning. ""What was that with you and Debbie? Chest cold needing a Vicks rubdown?""

""Gerry, we were just talking like always,"" he said. ""She saw my chest hair through my open button, said she'd never felt it before. Next thing I know, she's rubbing it like she's knitting a sweater. I've been trying to check this cross-connection for twenty minutes but was too, uh, bashful to stand up, if you catch my drift.""

""Oh, I catch it,"" I said. ""You gonna be alright?""

""I hope so,"" he said, shaking his head.

""Man, your poor wife has no idea what's waiting for her tonight.""

""I already called her,"" Stan said. ""Told her to have her mom take the kids after school.""

""Well, damn,"" I said. ""Sounds like a win-win. You get some action, she gets romance.""

""Hope I can hold out that long,"" Stan shot back.

""Think we've taken this talk as far as it'll go,"" I said. ""I'm hitting the bathroom. Just a number one.""

November kicked off, and with it, a new month at the office. Wojo took over from James as the in-charge tech, settling in behind us next to Gary.

""Hit Pending!"" Wojo barked. ""If nothing's in Pending, hit Hold. Stop cherry-picking New, you slugs!""

Gary shot him a sly grin. ""Real taskmaster, huh? I like it,"" he chuckled.

""Yeah,"" Wojo said. ""These cherry-pickers wouldn't have lasted a day in Nam with us, right, Sandy?""

Vinnie jumped in. ""Maybe not, but they'd have fit right in on the Lehman College campus with me and Doc Johnson, waving 'Bring Our Boys Home' signs.""

""Speaking of,"" Doc piped up, ""if a war breaks out, I'm sitting it out.""

""Why's that?"" Wojo asked.

""I've got circuits to work on,"" Doc said, deadpan.

""What is this, Crossfire?"" Gary shouted. ""Less debating, more troubleshooting!""
He leaned in, lowering his voice for me, Steve, and Pete. 

""Got a surprise for you guys at the three o'clock workout.""

The day zipped by. Before we knew it, it was time to hit the gym. Up on the 18th floor, Gary unlocked the door to our makeshift gym, revealing a workout bench, 250 pounds of weights, and a set of dumbbells.

""Damn,"" Pete said, impressed. ""This is like a free YMCA membership without leaving the building.""

""Exactly,"" Gary said. ""Borrowed my brother's pickup yesterday, and my son helped me set it up.""

""Gary, you're the man,"" I said. ""No need for a gym membership in my neighborhood now.""

""That's the idea,"" he said. ""Calisthenics are fine, but nothing beats pumping iron.""

We dove in, rotating with just a minute's rest between sets. Chest and back today—two exercises per body part. We crushed bench presses and flies for chest, then deadlifts and rows for back. Perfect for our goals.

The thirty minutes flew by like nothing. We'd brought spare shirts this time and were back at our desks, hitting Pending like Wojo demanded, still buzzing from the pump.

When I got home that night, I hopped in the shower, then reheated the leftover lasagna and meatballs we'd grabbed from my parents' house yesterday.

Mary walked in, looking worn out from a long day. ""Today dragged,"" she said. ""I'm turning in early.""

I checked the lasagna to make sure it was hot, plated it, and we sat at the table.

""Anything interesting at work?"" I asked.

""Not much,"" she said. ""Mr. Baker had emergency gallbladder surgery yesterday, so he'll be out a couple of days. His replacement made one big mistake—he asked Angie to make him coffee. After she bit his head off, he not only apologized, he made her a cup of coffee. You?""

""Same old,"" I said. ""But Gary brought in a set of weights for our gym. I'm gonna put back that ten pounds of muscle I lost."" I flexed my pecs for effect.

""Ooh, I like that,"" Mary said, reaching over to feel them. ""Let me get my hands on those.""

""You know what's great?"" I said, grinning. ""No kids to worry about, so we can get busy whenever we want. But this lasagna's calling my name.""

""Well, that's what microwaves are for,"" she teased.

Hey I thought. If it worked for Stan, it'd work for Gerry.

Chapter 16

It was Wednesday morning, a month later—Angie and Jeff's wedding day.

Angie had handled everything: the marriage license, the City Hall appointment, set for December 8th. Her Italian grandma called it a lucky day, falling on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception.

Mary and I were standing up for them. I wore a sharp sports jacket and slacks, while Mary looked radiant in a beige dress she'd bought for her cousin Matt's wedding.

We headed to Jeff and Angie's place to ride in together. I offered to drive, but Angie shot back, ""We'll take my car—I want to get there today.""

Jeff looked dapper in a sharkskin blue suit, his style elevated by the hipsters he worked with at MTV. Angie, naturally, was breathtaking. Her egg-white cocktail dress hugged her perfectly, subtly masking the early signs of her pregnancy.

Mary and I piled into the backseat of Angie's car. As we hit the Gowanus Expressway, I buckled up tight—Angie weaved through morning rush traffic like a stunt driver for The Fall Guy.

Their appointment was at 9:45. Angie snagged a parking spot five blocks from City Hall, on a street where you didn't need to feed the meter—a small victory.

We walked into City Hall by 9:30. Angie and Jeff handed their marriage license to the clerk, who checked that everything was in order.

Jeff was surprisingly calm. After nearly a year with Angie, he leaned on her steady strength, his usual anxious jitters nowhere in sight.

At 9:45 sharp, we were ushered into the ceremony area. We took our places before a licensed New York City officiant standing behind a wooden pedestal.

Mary grabbed my hand and looked  into my eyes.""We'll have our time soon enough,"" she said. ""Always and forever.""

He greeted us warmly and turned to me. ""Do you have the rings?""
I nodded, and he smiled. ""Let's begin.""

""Dear Angie and Jeff,"" he said, ""we are gathered today in the presence of your loved ones to unite you in marriage. Marriage is a solemn yet joyful commitment, a promise to support and cherish one another through life's journey.

""Do you, Angie, take Jeff to be your lawfully wedded spouse, to love and honor, in good times and bad, for as long as you both shall live?""

""I do,"" Angie said, her voice clear.

""Do you, Jeff, take Angie to be your lawfully wedded spouse, to love and honor, in good times and bad, for as long as you both shall live?""

""I do,"" Jeff said, steady and sure.

""If you have rings, please exchange them now as a symbol of your commitment. The ring, a circle, represents unending love and devotion.""
They slid the rings onto each other's fingers, eyes locked, both beaming with radiant smiles.

""By the authority vested in me by the State of New York, I now pronounce you married. You may seal your vows with a kiss. Congratulations!""

Caught up in the moment, Jeff pulled Angie close, kissing her with a passion worthy of Scarlett and Rhett in Gone with the Wind.

I pulled out my handkerchief and blew my nose, eyes misting up.

""Look at my boy,"" Mary teased, pulling me into a comforting hug. ""Your nose is all red.""

I hugged her back, kissing the side of her neck. ""Good thing Danny's not here,"" I said. ""He'd never let me live this down."" We all cracked up, the tension breaking.

We took a quick tour through City Hall to kill time. Angie had invited a small group of close friends and family to celebrate at the Americana Diner on 65th Street, right off the Gowanus Expressway exit.

The guest list was tight: Mary and me, Angie's mom, dad, and grandparents, Jeff's sister Nancy, and, of course, Danny, and Diane.

Jeff's adoptive parents, in their 80s, had retired to Florida so the couple planned to visit them later.

By the time we pulled into the Americana's parking lot, everyone was already there. We'd gotten stuck behind a jackknifed tractor-trailer on the Gowanus, and Angie's creative cursing had Jeff covering his face while Mary and I tried not to laugh in the backseat.

Jeff and Angie were swarmed with hugs and kisses from loved ones. Angie's parents had initially pushed for a big wedding, but she'd explained that their situation was unique—they were more about the marriage than the wedding itself.

We filed into the Americana Diner and were seated at a long table in the back. Menus in hand, Mary, Danny, Diane, and I settled toward one end.

What the diner lacked in elegance, it made up for in joy. Angie's grandparents were a riot, trading quips like they were in a Neil Simon play, keeping the table in stitches.

Grandpa Sid delivered jokes flawlessly. ""A mother is at the beach with her four-year-old son when a huge wave sweeps him out to sea. She wails, 'God, please bring him back, and I'll pray daily!' Another wave returns the boy unharmed. She looks up and says, 'He had a hat.'""

Even Danny caught the spirit, saying, ""Seeing Angie and Jeff this happy might make me rethink the single life."" He quickly added, ""I said might,"" drawing laughs.

Danny punched The Summer Wind by Sinatra into the jukebox by our table. On impulse, Jeff took Angie's hand, and they slow-danced beside the table, the whole back room clapping along.

The food at the Americana was top-notch, better than the Vegas in my book. My chicken cutlet parm over spaghetti could've come from a fancy restaurant.

Angie's dad had dropped off a strawberry shortcake with the manager, served after we finished our entrées. We presented the couple with their wedding gifts, and kissing Angie's glowing cheek made it all worth it.

Angie's dad, a burly construction contractor who clearly passed his toughness to her, picked up the check.

After cake and coffee, Mary, Jeff's sister Nancy, and I headed to Angie's parents' house. Danny and, Diane stayed to congratulate the couple. Danny slipped Jeff an envelope as a wedding gift, kissed Angie, and gave Jeff a peck on the cheek, saying, ""I'm damn proud of you, man.""

""I felt honored to be included with the family. Angie and Jeff weren't just friends—they were blood.""

As far as weddings go, I can honestly say it was one of the best—if not the best—I'd ever attended. It solidified my certainty about marrying Mary. We'd do it our way, with our own plans, but topping this one would be a hell of a challenge.",1,1762866405.0,u_glac1018,0,1.0,False

**COLD OPEN**

**Interior – IT Department – Morning**

Joe sits at his desk staring at a ticket.

On his screen:  
**USER REQUEST:** *“Please export my Chrome passwords and import them on my new device.”*

Joe reads it aloud slowly, as if decoding ancient hieroglyphics.

**JOE:**  
Huh. “Export.” Interesting word.

Gina walks by.

**GINA:**  
You did that twice last week.

**JOE:**  
Noooo.  
No I didn’t.  
I think I’d remember something like that.

**Cut to Flashback:**  
Joe doing this exact task twice, taking notes, nodding, saying “This is easy, I’ll never forget.”

**Flashback ends.**

**GINA (deadpan):**  
Yeah. You were really proud of yourself.

Joe nods confidently.

**JOE:**  
Sounds like something I’d do.

**Cut to opening theme.**



**ACT ONE**

Joe picks up the phone and calls **Rich**.

**RICH:**  
IT Support, Rich speaking.

**JOE:**  
Hey Rich, quick question—how do you export Chrome passwords?

Rich closes his eyes. He knows. He *knows* Joe already knows.

**RICH (patient voice):**  
Joe, you click the three dots, go to Password Manager, export, then import on the other machine.  
Just like last week.

**JOE:**  
Right. Right right right. No, yeah, obviously.  
(beat)  
Could you, uh… say that again but slower?

Rich stares into the void.



Joe hangs up. Immediately calls **Tom.**

**TOM (picking up):**  
Tom.

**JOE:**  
Tom! How do you export Chrome passwords?

**Camera snap-pan** to Rich, sitting 10 feet away, hearing this call.

His soul leaves his body.

**TOM (exhausted Buddhist calm):**  
Joe. Rich just answered that question. For you. Moments ago.

**JOE:**  
Yeah but I didn’t *understand* him.

Raj walks by, sipping coffee.

**RAJ:**  
Do you understand Tom?

**JOE:**  
Not really.

**RAJ:**  
There it is.



**ACT TWO**

Joe decides to **Google** it.

He types:  
**“How do chrome make password move to different chrome from other chrome password computer???”**

Google just says:  
**Did you mean: “How to export Chrome passwords?”**

Joe clicks a YouTube video where an 11-year-old explains the process in 40 seconds.

Joe nods like he just attended an Ivy League seminar.

**JOE:**  
Okay okay, I get it now.

But instead of doing it, he swivels toward Gina.

**JOE:**  
Hey Gina, I have a ticket about exporting Chrome passwords—since you’re *already in a workflow* can you just do it real quick?

Gina is in the middle of answering three chat tickets, one call, and writing an email.

She doesn’t even look up.

**GINA:**  
Fine. But you owe me coffee.

Joe pumps a fist like he scored a touchdown.



**ACT THREE**

Gina completes the task in **under 90 seconds**.

She sends the confirmation email.

Joe immediately hits “Reply All.”

**JOE (typing aloud proudly):**  
“Passwords successfully migrated. Let me know if you need anything else. -Joe”  
Smiley face.  
Thumbs-up emoji.

Raj overhears.

**RAJ:**  
You didn’t do it. Gina did.

**JOE:**  
Raj, that is called *delegation.*

**RAJ:**  
It’s called *not doing your job.*

Tom passes by, hears this conversation, keeps walking.  
He has transcended caring.

Rich sees the email reply and just rubs his temples.



**TAG**

**Break room – Later**

Gina is drinking the coffee Joe bought her.

Joe is explaining loudly to another coworker.

**JOE:**  
Yeah, exporting Chrome passwords is easy once you know what you’re doing.  
I’ve done it like three times now.

Gina sips her coffee without looking at him.

**GINA (muttering):**  
What are you going to do?  
It’s Joe.

Cue laugh track and fade out.

Saturday morning, Mary and I strolled up Bath Avenue to Nick's Candy Store on Bay 16th Street, grabbing a couple of buttered rolls and coffees.

We ate at the counter, savoring the warm, doughy rolls and the rich brew before heading back home.

The air carried a slight chill, maybe 58 degrees. I threw on a sweatshirt, Mary wore a light sweater, and Nick's strong coffee hit the spot perfectly.

By the time we reached the apartment, the phone was ringing. Mary fumbled with her keys, rushing in before the caller hung up.

""Oh, hi, Angie!"" she said, her voice bright. ""That's amazing news! I'm so happy for you. How'd Jeff take it?""

""Just like I figured,"" Angie said. ""Freaked out at first, totally blindsided. But I calmed him down. He'll be fine.""

""Sounds quiet up there,"" Mary said. ""He doing okay now?""

""He's out walking Lucy,"" Angie replied. ""He wasn't thrilled at first, did it grudgingly. Now he loves her to death. Takes him a bit to come around.""

""Good. I'm so glad,"" Mary said. ""I can't wait to tell Gerry.""

Mary hung up. I was sprawled on the couch, catching every word.

""What's going on?"" I asked, raising an eyebrow.

""Oh my God, amazing news!"" Mary said, eyes sparkling. ""Angie and Jeff are having a baby.""

I sat there, stunned for a second. ""I was with Stein Wednesday. He didn't mention anything about Angie being pregnant. Said he couldn't even think about kids right now.""

""Angie was having morning sickness,"" Mary said. ""She suspected but waited until today to take the test.""

""And it was positive, obviously,"" I said. ""So you knew?""

""Yeah, I knew,"" Mary said, a little defensive. ""But it was Angie's secret, not mine. I waited for her to tell Jeff before saying anything to you.""

""Hey, that's fine,"" I said, raising my hands. ""None of my business anyway.""

""Of course it's your business,"" she countered. ""They're our best friends. It's wonderful news. I thought you'd be a little excited.""

""I am,"" I said. ""I'm thrilled for them. Gonna love that kid. How'd Stein take it? Did she need to call an ambulance to sedate him?""

We cracked up, the weird tension melting away. Truth was, secrets weren't supposed to exist between us—but Stein, Danny, and I kept plenty from our girls too.

""Angie said he took it better than she expected,"" Mary said. ""Surprisingly well.""

""I'm heading over,"" I said, standing. ""You coming?""

""I haven't even showered yet,"" she said. ""Go. I'm sure he'll be happy to see you.""

""Yeah, I'll drag him to Danny's to break the news. Surprised he hasn't called yet, but he's probably still wrapping his head around it.""

""Tell them we'll take them to the Vegas Diner tonight,"" Mary said. ""Our treat.""

""Will do. Maybe Danny and Diane will join, and we can hit Ernie Barry's to celebrate.""

""Angie'll love that, even if she's off liquor while pregnant,"" Mary said. ""Lots of changes coming.""

She pulled me in for a hug and kiss before I headed out. Couples argued—it was part of the deal. Mom and Pop would be yelling one minute, lovey-dovey the next. Mary and I weren't there yet, thankfully.

I hopped in the car and sped down 17th Avenue. At a deli, I grabbed flowers for Angie and cigars for Stein, Danny, and me.

I parked up the block on 66th Street. My buddy Vinny was on his stoop, and we traded quick Mets talk—our ritual since we were eleven. I cut it short and headed to Stein's place.

They buzzed me in, and I took the four flights two steps at a time. Angie opened the door, I handed her the flowers, then scooped her up and spun her around.

""Thank you, Gerry, but put me down!"" she laughed. ""With my morning sickness, I might puke all over you.""

Stein came out from the kitchen, Lucy bouncing at my feet. I scratched under her chin, then pulled Stein in for a bro hug.

""Can you believe it, Gerry?"" he said, laughing nervously. ""Me, Steinberg, a dad.""

""Six months ago, I'd have bet against it,"" I said. ""Now? Feels right. You've done a hell of a job with him, Angie.""

""Soon I'll have two kids to wrangle,"" she teased. ""Coffee, Gerry?""

""Actually, I'm stealing Jeff to break the news to Danny,"" I said. ""He'll be as stoked as we are.""

""Go for it,"" Angie said. ""Get him out of my hair so I can clean.""

""Let me grab a sweater, and we're off,"" Stein said.

""Angie,"" I added, ""Mary and I want to take you guys to the Vegas Diner tonight, then Ernie Barry's to celebrate.""

""That's so sweet,"" she said. ""I'm in. Just sticking to seltzer for a while.""

""You don't need liquor,"" I said. ""You're glowing.""

Stein and I walked up the block and knocked on Danny's basement door. It was unlocked, as usual.

""Let's head upstairs,"" I said. ""Steinberg's got an announcement.""

""Hey, guys,"" Patsy said from the kitchen. ""Fresh pot of coffee. Sit.""

Danny strolled in, eyeing us. ""Alright, what's the big deal?""

Patsy poured coffee, and the caffeine hit just right—I'd been running around all morning and needed the boost.

All eyes turned to Stein. He stood, cleared his throat. ""Angie and I are having a baby.""

Patsy lunged across the table, kissing his cheek and squeezing him so tight his face turned red. ""Oh, Jeff!""

Danny shook his hand with a smirk. ""Congrats. You guys are really something. Once Diane hears this, there'll be no living with her.""

""Danny, that's what you're worried about?"" Patsy scolded. ""This isn't about you—it's about Jeff and Angie. And it'd be my dream to be a grandma,"" she added, her eyes glistening with tears.

""Ohhh, see? That's what I mean,"" Danny groaned.

I passed out the cigars, and we lit up. Three puffs in, we were coughing and crushed them out. Another toke and we'd have been hurling.

After finishing our coffee, we said goodbye to Patsy. ""Tell Angie I'm thrilled for you both,"" she told Stein. ""I'll have you over for dinner soon.""

""Thanks, Patsy,"" Stein said. ""She'll love that.""

""Let's move,"" Danny barked, slipping into full General mode.

We marched to the club. Angelo was at the poker table. ""How much do I owe you?"" he asked, half-hoping we'd lowball him.

""Two hundred each for me and Danny,"" I said.

""Alright, a hundred forty each,"" Angelo corrected, citing the real amount. ""Now make a bet.""

""Same as last week,"" I said. ""Forty-two dollar parlay on Florida State and Notre Dame.""

""You, Stein?"" Angelo asked.

""I gave you all my winnings back last week, Ang,"" Stein said. ""I'll wait to bet on my Jets tomorrow.""

""Put forty-two on Florida State and Notre Dame for Stein, too,"" Danny said. ""Call it a baby gift.""

""Baby?"" Angelo said, looking up. ""You're having a kid, Stein?""

""Yeah, just found out,"" Stein said.

Angelo stood and poured shots of Absolut. ""Salute,"" he said, raising his glass.

""Salute,"" we echoed.

It struck me how ironic it was—betting football and celebrating life under the same roof. Only in our world could a new baby and a parlay share the same toast.

We agreed to meet at the Vegas Diner tonight for dinner on me and Mary. Danny said he'd bring Diane, then we'd hit Ernie Barry's to celebrate.

As we left, we split up to head home. The news of a new addition felt electric, but the old crew—Stein, Danny, me, even Angelo—was still pretty damn good. Life was shifting around us, but the heart of it all hadn't changed.

Chapter 14

Mary slipped into a tight black dress that hit just above her knee, perfect for our night out at Ernie Barry's. I threw on pleated black Dockers and a sharp dress shirt, and we were set.

We met Stein and Angie at the Vegas Diner, where they were waiting outside, having just arrived. Mary, buzzing with excitement since hearing their news, rushed to Jeff, hugging him and planting a kiss on his cheek. ""Hi, Dad,"" she teased. Jeff's eyes misted as he hugged her back tightly.

We waited fifteen minutes for Danny and Diane but finally grabbed a table, figuring they'd be late as usual. We settled in, scanning the menus. I went with my go-to, chicken Marsala, while the others picked their favorites.

Danny and Diane showed up just before the waiter took our orders. ""We know what we want,"" Danny said, brushing off his delay with a vague ""finishing some business.""

They both congratulated Angie and Jeff on their news. Diane was bubbly, in high spirits, a contrast to the tension that had been flaring between her and Danny lately, sometimes making things awkward.

""I can't believe we won today,"" Jeff said, grinning. ""We could ride Florida State and Notre Dame all season.""

""Nah,"" I said. ""Next week, we're skipping the Irish—they're at Michigan. I'll get the kid to pick another team.""

""My heart was in my throat the whole game,"" Mary said, now a seasoned weekend bettor. ""Stanford made it way too close for comfort.""

""The football gods were smiling on us,"" Danny said. ""Even the Steinberg mush was on hold with the baby news."" We all burst out laughing.

Diane leaned toward Angie. ""You look stunning,"" she said. ""I can see that motherly glow already.""

Angie blushed, smiling. ""Thanks. Honestly, I've never felt better. It's like I've always got company.""

""Do you talk to the baby?"" Mary asked.

""Oh, yeah,"" Angie said. ""I tell 'em, 'Careful not to kick too hard, 'cause once you're out, I'll kick you back!'""

We roared with laughter. Angie always knew how to land a punchline.

I offered to cover dessert, but everyone passed. I picked up the check as a baby gift for Jeff and Angie, feeling extra good knowing Angelo's payout was footing the bill.

We met at Ernie Barry's in Bay Ridge, a lively spot where finding one parking spot is a challenge, let alone three. As lifelong Brooklynites, we're used to it—it's just part of the deal.

I parked a couple of blocks away, but the crisp fall air felt good after a hearty meal, making the short walk worthwhile.

I was the last to arrive, no surprise since Angie and Danny drive like they're auditioning for NASCAR. Mary teased me, calling me a ""right-lane cowboy.""

The bar was buzzing when we walked in, our crew already holding court. We squeezed in between Angie and Diane, and I tossed a twenty onto the pile, ordering a Bud Light for myself and a vodka cranberry for Mary.

A local oldies band, The Fines, was set to play later, promising doo-wop from the fifties and rhythm and blues from the sixties. For now, Yvonne Elliman's If I Can't Have You blasted through the speakers, keeping the crowd in a festive disco mood. The dance floor was alive, and it wouldn't be long before Mary and Angie joined the fray.

I chatted with Steinberg, who was trying to convince both me and himself that he was ready for fatherhood. I reminded him his fallback plan was simple: Angie would handle most of the heavy lifting, aside from a few errands.

""Can you imagine me changing diapers?"" Steinberg said. ""I'll probably put it on backwards or upside down.""

""Just make sure the tape goes on the diaper, Stein—not over the baby's mouth.""

We both cracked up when I felt a slap on my back. I turned to see Andre, decked out in one of those work suits he didn't need to wear, looking like an eight-year-old posing for a class picture.

""Long Island Iced Tea!"" I yelled into the bartender's ear, knowing Dre's go-to drink. The bartender mixed it like a wizard, five liquors splashing into the glass so fast I barely caught his hands moving. I handed it to Dre just as he opened his mouth to order.

""How'd you know what I wanted?"" he asked, deadpan.

""It's not like I just met you,"" I shot back.

Mary was beside me, deep in conversation with her cousin Linda, Aunt Terry's daughter. Linda was a spitting image of Mary's mom, Dolly—shorter, with strawberry blonde hair, a bubbly, sweet personality, and an infectious laugh. Mary, tall and slender, got her looks from her dad's side.

My head swiveled like I was at the U.S. Open, glancing between Andre and Linda. This could be it, I thought—a match made in heaven. But I had to play it cool. Andre had top-tier boyfriend potential but crippling social anxiety around women. His first instinct was always to bolt when one got too close.

""Linda!"" I called out, cutting Mary off mid-sentence.

I pulled Linda into an awkward hug, positioning her against Mary's back with me sandwiched between her and Andre.

""Too tight!"" I said, stepping back. Mary shot me a look like I'd lost my mind. I slung one arm around Linda, the other around Andre, and pulled them together to face each other.

""Linda, this is my buddy Andre,"" I said. ""Andre, Mary's cousin Linda.""

Linda, ever warm and welcoming, greeted Andre with a bright smile. To my surprise, he didn't freeze up. Instead, he went straight for a compliment. ""You've got pretty hazel eyes,"" he said, and I could've sworn the air sparked.

""Let's dance,"" I said, taking Mary's arm and steering her toward the dance floor.

""But I was talking to Linda before you cut us off,"" she protested.

""You're not talking to her now,"" I said. ""Besides, she looks pretty happy getting to know Andre.""

We hit the dance floor, twisting to Chubby Checker's The Twist. Angie and Jeff spotted us and joined in, spinning round and round. Diane jumped in too, grooving solo, while Danny, too cool for school, stood at the bar, itching to bolt for Pastels.

The next song kicked in—Mel Carter's Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me. I pulled Mary close, and Jeff did the same with Angie. We swayed slowly, lost in each other's eyes.

I glanced at the bar—Andre and Linda were gone. I scanned the club, but they were nowhere in sight. Then someone bumped my back. I turned to see Andre and Linda, locked in a close embrace, swaying awkwardly, gazing at each other like lovesick teens at a prom.

""You seeing this?"" I whispered to Mary.

""Oh, I'm seeing it,"" she said, unsure what to make of it.

When the song ended, we headed back to the bar. Linda and Andre drifted to the far end, wrapped up in their own world.

""Look at what you've done to my cousin,"" Mary said. ""I barely recognize her.""

""Same with Andre,"" I said. ""They're staring at each other like Sam and Jake at the end of Sixteen Candles.""

Danny and Diane bailed around 1 a.m. for Pastels. It was nice seeing them civil for once.

Andre and Linda slipped out without a goodbye. I'd have to call him tomorrow to get the scoop.

We finally said goodnight to the expectant parents.

""Thanks for an amazing night,"" Angie said. ""I can't remember the last time I had this much fun at a bar without drinking.""

We hugged and kissed, then headed our separate ways. We'd celebrated Angie and Jeff right, and maybe—just maybe—Andre had found his soulmate.

Chapter 15

I was knee-deep in a trouble ticket for a manual ring-down circuit for Tullet and Tokyo, one of our biggest clients. When their circuits went down, getting them back up was priority one.

I was on the line with one of their site techs, who confirmed he could see my seizure, meaning I could ring him, but we couldn't hear each other when we tried to talk.

They had several Verizon channel banks on-site. I tested a loopback on the AT&T side from our closest central office and got a good signal, but the loop closer to the customer's premises failed.
I opened a ticket with our Central Office to check for a bad channel card at Broad Street, pretty sure that was the culprit.

The Tullet tech was relieved and said he'd update his brokers. ""Hopefully, it'll be fixed within the hour,"" I told him, and I could hear the sigh of relief over the line.

I was updating my ticket log when I caught Stan chatting with Debbie, their usual morning thing. What wasn't usual was her slipping her hand inside his open shirt, rubbing his chest. 

Debbie's face held a curious, almost clinical look, while Stan's expression screamed he'd just died and gone to heaven.

I had to rewrite my log entry—too distracted, I'd left the caps lock on.

Later, I saw Stan, still dazed by Debbie's touch, drift over to the DEX terminal at the corner table. My curiosity got the better of me—Angie'd call me a yenta for this. I strolled over.

""Checking a cross-connection, huh?"" I said. ""Think that's the issue?""

Stan looked up, lovesick-puppy written all over him. ""Say that again, Gerry. Wasn't listening.""

""I'll bet,"" I said, grinning. ""What was that with you and Debbie? Chest cold needing a Vicks rubdown?""

""Gerry, we were just talking like always,"" he said. ""She saw my chest hair through my open button, said she'd never felt it before. Next thing I know, she's rubbing it like she's knitting a sweater. I've been trying to check this cross-connection for twenty minutes but was too, uh, bashful to stand up, if you catch my drift.""

""Oh, I catch it,"" I said. ""You gonna be alright?""

""I hope so,"" he said, shaking his head.

""Man, your poor wife has no idea what's waiting for her tonight.""

""I already called her,"" Stan said. ""Told her to have her mom take the kids after school.""

""Well, damn,"" I said. ""Sounds like a win-win. You get some action, she gets romance.""

""Hope I can hold out that long,"" Stan shot back.

""Think we've taken this talk as far as it'll go,"" I said. ""I'm hitting the bathroom. Just a number one.""

November kicked off, and with it, a new month at the office. Wojo took over from James as the in-charge tech, settling in behind us next to Gary.

""Hit Pending!"" Wojo barked. ""If nothing's in Pending, hit Hold. Stop cherry-picking New, you slugs!""

Gary shot him a sly grin. ""Real taskmaster, huh? I like it,"" he chuckled.

""Yeah,"" Wojo said. ""These cherry-pickers wouldn't have lasted a day in Nam with us, right, Sandy?""

Vinnie jumped in. ""Maybe not, but they'd have fit right in on the Lehman College campus with me and Doc Johnson, waving 'Bring Our Boys Home' signs.""

""Speaking of,"" Doc piped up, ""if a war breaks out, I'm sitting it out.""

""Why's that?"" Wojo asked.

""I've got circuits to work on,"" Doc said, deadpan.

""What is this, Crossfire?"" Gary shouted. ""Less debating, more troubleshooting!""
He leaned in, lowering his voice for me, Steve, and Pete. 

""Got a surprise for you guys at the three o'clock workout.""

The day zipped by. Before we knew it, it was time to hit the gym. Up on the 18th floor, Gary unlocked the door to our makeshift gym, revealing a workout bench, 250 pounds of weights, and a set of dumbbells.

""Damn,"" Pete said, impressed. ""This is like a free YMCA membership without leaving the building.""

""Exactly,"" Gary said. ""Borrowed my brother's pickup yesterday, and my son helped me set it up.""

""Gary, you're the man,"" I said. ""No need for a gym membership in my neighborhood now.""

""That's the idea,"" he said. ""Calisthenics are fine, but nothing beats pumping iron.""

We dove in, rotating with just a minute's rest between sets. Chest and back today—two exercises per body part. We crushed bench presses and flies for chest, then deadlifts and rows for back. Perfect for our goals.

The thirty minutes flew by like nothing. We'd brought spare shirts this time and were back at our desks, hitting Pending like Wojo demanded, still buzzing from the pump.

When I got home that night, I hopped in the shower, then reheated the leftover lasagna and meatballs we'd grabbed from my parents' house yesterday.

Mary walked in, looking worn out from a long day. ""Today dragged,"" she said. ""I'm turning in early.""

I checked the lasagna to make sure it was hot, plated it, and we sat at the table.

""Anything interesting at work?"" I asked.

""Not much,"" she said. ""Mr. Baker had emergency gallbladder surgery yesterday, so he'll be out a couple of days. His replacement made one big mistake—he asked Angie to make him coffee. After she bit his head off, he not only apologized, he made her a cup of coffee. You?""

""Same old,"" I said. ""But Gary brought in a set of weights for our gym. I'm gonna put back that ten pounds of muscle I lost."" I flexed my pecs for effect.

""Ooh, I like that,"" Mary said, reaching over to feel them. ""Let me get my hands on those.""

""You know what's great?"" I said, grinning. ""No kids to worry about, so we can get busy whenever we want. But this lasagna's calling my name.""

""Well, that's what microwaves are for,"" she teased.

Hey I thought. If it worked for Stan, it'd work for Gerry.

Chapter 16

It was Wednesday morning, a month later—Angie and Jeff's wedding day.

Angie had handled everything: the marriage license, the City Hall appointment, set for December 8th. Her Italian grandma called it a lucky day, falling on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception.

Mary and I were standing up for them. I wore a sharp sports jacket and slacks, while Mary looked radiant in a beige dress she'd bought for her cousin Matt's wedding.

We headed to Jeff and Angie's place to ride in together. I offered to drive, but Angie shot back, ""We'll take my car—I want to get there today.""

Jeff looked dapper in a sharkskin blue suit, his style elevated by the hipsters he worked with at MTV. Angie, naturally, was breathtaking. Her egg-white cocktail dress hugged her perfectly, subtly masking the early signs of her pregnancy.

Mary and I piled into the backseat of Angie's car. As we hit the Gowanus Expressway, I buckled up tight—Angie weaved through morning rush traffic like a stunt driver for The Fall Guy.

Their appointment was at 9:45. Angie snagged a parking spot five blocks from City Hall, on a street where you didn't need to feed the meter—a small victory.

We walked into City Hall by 9:30. Angie and Jeff handed their marriage license to the clerk, who checked that everything was in order.

Jeff was surprisingly calm. After nearly a year with Angie, he leaned on her steady strength, his usual anxious jitters nowhere in sight.

At 9:45 sharp, we were ushered into the ceremony area. We took our places before a licensed New York City officiant standing behind a wooden pedestal.

Mary grabbed my hand and looked  into my eyes.""We'll have our time soon enough,"" she said. ""Always and forever.""

He greeted us warmly and turned to me. ""Do you have the rings?""
I nodded, and he smiled. ""Let's begin.""

""Dear Angie and Jeff,"" he said, ""we are gathered today in the presence of your loved ones to unite you in marriage. Marriage is a solemn yet joyful commitment, a promise to support and cherish one another through life's journey.

""Do you, Angie, take Jeff to be your lawfully wedded spouse, to love and honor, in good times and bad, for as long as you both shall live?""

""I do,"" Angie said, her voice clear.

""Do you, Jeff, take Angie to be your lawfully wedded spouse, to love and honor, in good times and bad, for as long as you both shall live?""

""I do,"" Jeff said, steady and sure.

""If you have rings, please exchange them now as a symbol of your commitment. The ring, a circle, represents unending love and devotion.""
They slid the rings onto each other's fingers, eyes locked, both beaming with radiant smiles.

""By the authority vested in me by the State of New York, I now pronounce you married. You may seal your vows with a kiss. Congratulations!""

Caught up in the moment, Jeff pulled Angie close, kissing her with a passion worthy of Scarlett and Rhett in Gone with the Wind.

I pulled out my handkerchief and blew my nose, eyes misting up.

""Look at my boy,"" Mary teased, pulling me into a comforting hug. ""Your nose is all red.""

I hugged her back, kissing the side of her neck. ""Good thing Danny's not here,"" I said. ""He'd never let me live this down."" We all cracked up, the tension breaking.

We took a quick tour through City Hall to kill time. Angie had invited a small group of close friends and family to celebrate at the Americana Diner on 65th Street, right off the Gowanus Expressway exit.

The guest list was tight: Mary and me, Angie's mom, dad, and grandparents, Jeff's sister Nancy, and, of course, Danny, and Diane.

Jeff's adoptive parents, in their 80s, had retired to Florida so the couple planned to visit them later.

By the time we pulled into the Americana's parking lot, everyone was already there. We'd gotten stuck behind a jackknifed tractor-trailer on the Gowanus, and Angie's creative cursing had Jeff covering his face while Mary and I tried not to laugh in the backseat.

Jeff and Angie were swarmed with hugs and kisses from loved ones. Angie's parents had initially pushed for a big wedding, but she'd explained that their situation was unique—they were more about the marriage than the wedding itself.

We filed into the Americana Diner and were seated at a long table in the back. Menus in hand, Mary, Danny, Diane, and I settled toward one end.

What the diner lacked in elegance, it made up for in joy. Angie's grandparents were a riot, trading quips like they were in a Neil Simon play, keeping the table in stitches.

Grandpa Sid delivered jokes flawlessly. ""A mother is at the beach with her four-year-old son when a huge wave sweeps him out to sea. She wails, 'God, please bring him back, and I'll pray daily!' Another wave returns the boy unharmed. She looks up and says, 'He had a hat.'""

Even Danny caught the spirit, saying, ""Seeing Angie and Jeff this happy might make me rethink the single life."" He quickly added, ""I said might,"" drawing laughs.

Danny punched The Summer Wind by Sinatra into the jukebox by our table. On impulse, Jeff took Angie's hand, and they slow-danced beside the table, the whole back room clapping along.

The food at the Americana was top-notch, better than the Vegas in my book. My chicken cutlet parm over spaghetti could've come from a fancy restaurant.

Angie's dad had dropped off a strawberry shortcake with the manager, served after we finished our entrées. We presented the couple with their wedding gifts, and kissing Angie's glowing cheek made it all worth it.

Angie's dad, a burly construction contractor who clearly passed his toughness to her, picked up the check.

After cake and coffee, Mary, Jeff's sister Nancy, and I headed to Angie's parents' house. Danny and, Diane stayed to congratulate the couple. Danny slipped Jeff an envelope as a wedding gift, kissed Angie, and gave Jeff a peck on the cheek, saying, ""I'm damn proud of you, man.""

""I felt honored to be included with the family. Angie and Jeff weren't just friends—they were blood.""

As far as weddings go, I can honestly say it was one of the best—if not the best—I'd ever attended. It solidified my certainty about marrying Mary. We'd do it our way, with our own plans, but topping this one would be a hell of a challenge.",1,1762866274.0,fiction,0,1.0,False

1ou8tzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyWitch/comments/1ou8tzk/how_im_incorporating_witchcraft_into_my_daily/,How I’m incorporating witchcraft into my daily routine,"Some context: I picked up witchcraft for the first time a couple years ago when I was on the verge of divorce. I listened to a bunch of podcasts about it, read about spells, got into tarot, etc.  At the time it was mainly a maladaptive coping mechanism more than anything else. I felt so untethered that I needed something that felt like it gave me a sense of power/control.
I left it behind for a while but I still messed around with tarot every now and then mainly because I have raging OCD and it often became a compulsion 🙄
Recently, however, I’ve felt drawn back to the craft. I went through the ending of a situationship in September that hurt pretty badly and I went back to my usual coping mechanism of compulsively looking to tarot to find some kind of comfort. For some reason though I felt like I needed more than the anxiety-ridden tarot pulls. So I’ve been slowly dipping my toes back in to witchcraft in a way that feels much more heartfelt than ever before. I wanted to share some small ways I’ve started incorporating it into my day to day —
1. I bought a cheap little journal from the dollar store where I write down correspondences, spells, prayers, manifestations, dreams, etc. I’ve started using it to write a list of things I’m grateful for each morning while I have my coffee
2. I made a little altar space on a shelf in my kitchen. My altar is probably my favorite bit of my practice so far. I’m an artist, so visuals/aesthetics hold a lot of weight for me. I love rearranging my altar and adding new little things that are meaningful. I got a pack of cheap tea light candles from the dollar store to light each day on my altar.
3. I went to a local metaphysical/occult bookstore and bought some cheap items to enhance my practice — some chime candles for specific spells along with some incense and a couple of crystals. I’ve started carrying a crystal with me in my pocket. I like being able to have something to hold onto that feels grounding throughout my day.
4. Each morning when I have my coffee I add some honey and then stir it in using a clockwise motion and silently set an intent for the day.
5. I have been trying to incorporate tarot into my day to day morning routine so that it moves from a compulsive action to something meditative and less scary. I write down which cards I pull each day and even if I don’t fully understand them I like to think about them throughout the day and then come back to journal about them more later if I have any new thoughts about them. 

If you made it through all that, hopefully you found something helpful in there! I’m a low income divorced mom with autism and adhd so it can feel nearly impossible to incorporate new routines into my life. But I’ve found a lot of comfort in witchcraft so far and I think it’s really freeing that it can be sort of whatever you want it to be and how there are plenty of ways to develop your own practice without it being super costly. ❤️✨",10,1762866060.0,BabyWitch,0,1.0,False

Now, more than ever before, we need to step our spend and replace game up. We need to show love to the merchants willing to accept Bitcoin.

I'm not asking you to go out of your way to spend money you wouldn't spend otherwise to prove a point. Instead, I'm asking that you:

1. Keep some sats in a lightning wallet, even something simple like Cash app.

2. Keep an eye out for Square merchants that accept Bitcoin. I believe Square will be making a map available soon.

3. Maybe buy your next coffee or your next meal with some sats when you have the chance.

4. Convert more fiat to Sats when you make a purchase.

Four easy steps to accelerate hyperbitcoinization. It's that simple, now put your money where your mouth is and MAKE IT HAPPEN!

Inb4 muh Gresham's Law: Shut up and stop being a nerd. There is zero drawback to spending Bitcoin if you immediately convert the fiat.

You hit refresh on your Google Ads dashboard. $100,000 in sales.

That sweet, sweet dopamine hit. You're already thinking about scaling.

You jump over to Shopify to see the real numbers, maybe do a little happy dance... and your heart just sinks.

$60,000.

...what?

My first thought was, did I read that wrong? Is Shopify bugged? Or... is Google just straight up lying to me?

It's not just a few bucks off. We're talking about $40,000 that just vanished into thin air. It's a total gut punch and makes you question your entire marketing budget.

I've been digging into this for a while, and if you're seeing this too, you're not alone. It's a super common and infuriating problem. It's not necessarily that anyone is ""lying,"" but it's a mess of tech, user behavior, and how these platforms are built.

# So, why the hell does this happen?

After way too much coffee and staring at spreadsheets, I've realized it boils down to this:

Google and Shopify have two completely different jobs.

* Google Ads is a salesperson. Its main goal is to show you the value it's providing. It wants to take credit for a sale if it was involved at any point in the customer's journey. It's trying to prove its worth to you.
* Shopify is your accountant. It's your financial source of truth. It only records the final, actual transaction that happened. It doesn't care about the journey; it just cares that the cash register rang.

They're measuring two different things, even though they both call it a ""sale.""

# Is it Google's fault, or is my tracking just broken?

Honestly, it's usually a bit of both.

Your tracking setup is probably more fragile than you think. That little bit of code (pixel) on your site that talks to Google? It can be blocked by SO many things:

* Ad blockers (duh)
* Apple's ITP (Intelligent Tracking Prevention) basically nuking cookies
* People just clicking ""Decline All"" on your cookie banner
* Someone might see your ad on their phone at lunch, get distracted, then go home and buy on their laptop by typing your site in directly. Google, with its cross-device magic, might say ""Yep, that was my ad!"" Shopify will see a ""Direct"" visit and give the credit there.

And yeah, sometimes your GTM or GA4 setup is just messed up and you're accidentally firing two purchase events for every one sale. It happens.

# And don't even get me started on ""Attribution Models""...

This is where it gets really messy.

Shopify is simple: it gives 100% credit to the very last thing someone clicked before buying. If they clicked an email link last, the sale goes to Email. End of story.

Google is... more complicated. It often uses a ""data-driven"" model. It looks at the whole journey and tries to assign credit to different touchpoints. So if a user's journey was:

Google Ad Click -> Facebook Ad Click -> Email Click -> Purchase

Shopify will say: ""100% credit to Email.""  
Google might say: ""Well, my ad started it all, so I'm taking partial (or even full) credit for that sale!""

Neither is ""wrong,"" they're just looking at the same painting from different sides of the room.



# Okay, so what can you actually DO about it?

You'll never get the numbers to match 1:1. Chasing that is a ghost story. But you can get them a LOT closer and gain some sanity back. Here's what's working for me:

* Move to Server-Side Tracking. This is the big one, guys. It sends data from your server directly to Google, bypassing all the browser-level ad blocker/privacy stuff. It's more work to set up but it makes your data way more accurate. Look into GTM Server-Side or Shopify's Customer Events API. Game changer.
* Use Enhanced Conversions. This lets you send hashed (i.e., anonymous and safe) customer data like emails to Google. Google then uses this to match sales that its pixel might have missed, especially when people switch devices.
* Actually AUDIT your tags. Open up Google Tag Manager's preview mode. Make a test purchase. Do you see the purchase tag fire once? Or twice? Is the correct value and currency being sent? It's boring but you might find a simple, dumb mistake that's costing you.
* Treat Shopify as your 'Source of Truth'. This is the most important mindset shift. Shopify's number is your revenue. That's what hits your bank account (before refunds, etc.). Use Google Ads data as a directional guide to optimize your campaigns, not as your financial report.

TL;DR: Google Ads and Shopify report different sales numbers because they have different jobs (salesperson vs. accountant), use different tracking methods, and different attribution models. You can't get them to match perfectly, but using server-side tracking and enhanced conversions helps a ton. Always trust Shopify for your final revenue numbers.

Flexeril made me sorta drowsy the first few times but I didn’t notice ANY HINT of my muscles, ya know… RELAXING? I kinda figured muscle relaxers were some kind of placebo-effect thing where if the doctor says it will help you just believe it is working. Haha. ANYWAY… I of course am most stiff in evening, at night, and when I get up in morning. So yesterday evening I took half a 2 mg tablet before watching tv and guess what?? I think this is going to be a huge help! I actually DID feel my muscles relaxing! I got a tiny bit loopy (hence why I only took half the lowest dose), but it wasn’t too bad. I slept great and this morning I had significantly less lower back spasming. I asked my Dr why I’ve never heard of it or why doctors don’t prescribe it and she said it’s because it is known to make you tired/loopy more so than Flexeril even. But I’m planning on using for night time anyway. I had to get up early this morning and only had a teeny bit of grogginess that left after my morning coffee. Alright, over and out!

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Air Force Falcons vs. LIU Sharks: A Clash of Scoring Snails and Defensive Turtles**

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for a game that sounds like a math teacher’s nightmare: the Air Force Falcons (0-2) host the LIU Sharks (1-1) in a matchup where both teams’ offenses play by the rulebook of “slow and slower.” Let’s parse the numbers, news, and humor to see who emerges from this defensive slugfest.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Snails

The betting line has LIU as 2.5-point favorites, with the total set at 138.5. Let’s translate that into human terms. For LIU (-2.5), the implied probability of winning is roughly **63%** (based on their -171 moneyline odds), while Air Force’s chances hover at **31%** (+216 odds). The rest? Bookmakers’ profit, probably funding a new “How to Defend Like a Wall” seminar for college coaches.

Historically, LIU ranked **24th in defense** (allowing 65.3 PPG) last season, while Air Force ranked **232nd in defense** (73.7 PPG allowed). Put another way: LIU’s defense is a locked vault; Air Force’s defense is a vault that forgot to lock, left open, and then took a coffee break. Offensively, both teams are equally anemic—LIU scored 67.7 PPG (325th), Air Force 61.9 PPG (also 325th). Together, they form a scoring duo that would make a tortoise blush.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Zero Assists, and a Toaster Offense

Air Force’s latest loss to Austin Peay was so one-sided (74-54) that Ethan Greenberg, their lone bright spot (21 points), might’ve needed a defibrillator to revive the team’s offense. Oh, and did we mention Air Force recorded **zero assists** in that game? Greenberg’s a one-man band playing in a ghost town—no backup singers, no crowd, just a lot of m

So I've been living in a tiny apartment for about two years now, and honestly, finding hobbies that don't take up half my living room has been a challenge. I got into crocheting last year because I needed something relaxing to do after work, but I quickly realized that not all crochet kits are created equal when you're working with limited space.

I wanted to share what I learned because I know a lot of you are probably in the same boat.

**The Space Problem**

Most beginner crochet kits come with way too much stuff. You get these huge storage boxes, multiple yarn skeins scattered everywhere, and before you know it, your coffee table looks like a craft store exploded. When you've only got a small apartment, you need something compact that you can actually put away when you're done.

**What Actually Works**

After trying a bunch of different options, I found that the best crochet kits for small spaces have a few key things:

- Compact storage that fits in a drawer or small basket
- Just enough yarn for a project without extra bulk
- Clear instructions so you're not printing out a million papers
- Basic tools that don't require tons of accessories

I've been using [this crochet kit](https://athomewave.com/crochet-kit) for a few months now, and it's honestly perfect for apartment living. Everything fits in one small container, and I can tuck it next to my couch or in my closet when I'm not using it.

**Why Size Matters**

Look, I know it sounds obvious, but the physical size of your supplies really does make a difference in whether you'll actually stick with the hobby. If setting up your project feels like a huge production, you're just not going to do it as often. I like that I can grab everything I need in one trip and start working right away.

**My Recommendation**

If you're tight on space but still want to try crocheting, go for a starter kit that focuses on one or two simple projects. You don't need 20 different colors of yarn right away. A basic kit with neutral colors works great, and you can always add more later if you really get into it.

[Check out this beginner-friendly option](https://athomewave.com/crochet-kit) that won't overtake your apartment. It's got everything you need without all the extra stuff that ends up collecting dust.

**Final Thoughts**

Crocheting in a small apartment is totally doable. You just need to be smart about what you buy. Start simple, keep it organized, and don't feel like you need every tool and color under the sun. Trust me, your space will thank you.

I got you!,"Let's break down the reasons why native speakers sound so quick, and how you can catch up. The big reveal is that native speakers speak fast! The main reason you can’t understand them in movies is because they use ""linked speech,"" connecting all the words in a sentence instead of saying them separately.

Here are the common linking tricks you need to master:
1. ""What do you"" becomes /Wa diu/: Instead of saying ""what do you"", they smash it together. So, ""What do you do?"" sounds like ""Wadiu do?"". 
Fun fact: sometimes it's not the speed but a lack of clarity (like mumbling or an unclear tone of voice) that makes comprehension hard.

2. When /d/ hits /y/, it sounds like /j/: You don't pronounce /d/ and /y/
separately.
""Did you"" becomes /diju/. (Example: ""Wha diju do?"").
""Would you"" becomes ""wouldju"". (Example: ""Wouldju like coffee?"").

3. When /t/ hits /y/, it sounds like /ch/: Just like with /d/, the /t/ sound merges with /y/.
""Don't you"" becomes ""don't chew"". (Example: ""Don't you get it?"").
""Let you"" becomes ""let chu"". (Example: ""I can't let you go"").
Bonus Reduction: You might also hear ""get it"" reduced to ""get it"".

4. How is it becomes ""How's it"": This is a common phrase often linked and said fast. ""How is it possible?"" becomes ""How's it possible?"".

5. Removing Grammatical Parts: Native speakers often drop parts of a sentence, making it technically grammatically incorrect, but they do it because the other person still understands the meaning.
A very British example: Instead of ""Do you fancy a cup of tea or coffee,"" they remove ""do you"" and change ""a cup of"" to ""cuppa,"" leaving: ""Fancy a cuppa?"".

6. Contractions (The Final Tip): Native speakers use tons of contractions, which are shorter forms of two or three words. For example:
""Let me"" becomes ""lemme"".
""Going to"" becomes ""gonna"".
""Want to"" becomes ""wanna"". (Example: ""Wanna dance"" or ""You wanna go"").

1ou8bd5,https://i.redd.it/yajx5imbpk0g1.png,Wrapping up 3 years with Hyatt [48 reviews],"Hi everyone! As the year wraps up, I wanted to share my updated reviews for each Hyatt I've stayed at in the past 3 years, which has about doubled since the last time I posted here. I rewrote most of my reviews for clarity and expanded my scoring criteria. I’ve included as much detail as possible across all my stays, and feel free to AMA! 

Full sheet here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11akZpLPSEdDBqOjmm-x2e7M79KOWDe6ZfQAqV\_2YPF0/edit?gid=0#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11akZpLPSEdDBqOjmm-x2e7M79KOWDe6ZfQAqV_2YPF0/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

**Andaz Tokyo (9.6)**

Favorite hotel we've stayed at to date, or generally tied with other top hotels. We loved the room design, especially the carpets. The room itself is massive, and we were given a complimentary upgrade to a park-view room (not a suite). Everything about the room was wonderful. We had a slightly delayed check-in process, and they sent us a free bottle of champagne to apologize (no apology necessary). The breakfast was, in our opinion, not as flavorful as the Grand Hyatt Tokyo’s, but it offered significantly more options and was still excellent.

I felt the location was slightly less convenient than the GH/HTH as the walk to the train is labyrinthine, but if you’re staying multiple days it’s easy to acclimate. The Aesop toiletries were amazing, and overall this hotel was truly excellent. Would absolutely stay again, but it was bumped up to Category 8 so harder to justify.

**Park Hyatt Seoul (9.4)**

We had a really positive experience here, well beyond expectations after reading some tepid reviews online. Our suite overlooked the square and featured beautiful fixtures, the best shower I’ve ever had (fantastic water pressure), and a super comfortable bed. The real excellence, though, was the service. We experienced a minor incident outside the hotel’s control while checking in, and the staff went above and beyond with multiple check-ins and thoughtful gifts. I believe the manager assisting us was named Stephanie, she was wonderful.

The hotel feels warm and refined, and the fitness center/spa are top-notch. Breakfast was very good, though we preferred the Andaz Seoul breakfast for its larger variety and livelier atmosphere. The location is not bad; it's close to a major train station, Lotte World, and Starfield COEX Mall, but we preferred the Andaz’s more central positioning and access to parks and shops.

**Andaz Seoul Gangnam (9.2)**

I was fortunate enough to spend about two weeks in this great hotel this year, and I had a generally amazing experience the entire time. The staff is very good, they celebrated my birthday and did several kind things throughout our stay, such as a room switch, two separate suite upgrades, and just generally being kind and welcoming throughout. The breakfast is my favorite in Korea, and just about tied with the best in Japan. The fitness center, pool, and sauna are all wonderful too. The only downside is that all three are underground with no windows, so not a great place to hang out for the entire day. On my first two stays, I did not receive an early check in, but I did receive room upgrades each time. Finally, on my third stay, my flight arrived at 5 am and the staff did everything possible to get me into my room by 11 am which was EXTREMELY appreciated, as I immediately fell asleep until 8 pm.

If you can swing it on SUA, I strongly recommend the standard suite as it more than doubles the square footage and generously expands the bathroom size by more than double. It's an example of a suite being more than twice as good as the standard room, and the standard room is perfectly great too. Lastly, if you're still reading this and planning on staying here because of my review, please smell the Byredo body soap that was in the spa.

**Grand Hyatt Tokyo (9.2)**

It’s hard to explain why this hotel felt so right to me. It’s not new, and some design choices are a bit dated (Balmain toiletries just aren’t my favorite and wish GH would move on), but the room feels built out of the heaviest, most solid materials imaginable. The breakfast in the club lounge was among the most flavorful I’ve ever had, though the selection was somewhat limited. I still think about that breakfast a year later. Direct access to the Mori Art Museum and Roppongi Hills Mall without leaving the hotel, plus easy access to multiple subway lines, makes the location excellent.

The staff were professional but less outwardly warm than other Japanese hotels, even non-luxury ones. Check-in and check-out both took a while (perhaps this could be handled on the club floor, but I wasn’t informed of that option).

**Hotel Toranomon Hills (9.1)**

Absolutely loved this hotel. The room was spotless, though smaller than the others listed above. Was upgraded to a view of the Tokyo Tower both times we stayed here. Gym was brand new, though small and no spa / sauna. Breakfast was superb. In between the Andaz Tokyo and GH Club breakfast in terms of variety, but everything tasted really, really good, and the ordered menu was also great (note: even better the second time). Probably my favorite breakfast of the three for repeat visits. Location is IMO better than the Andaz Tokyo, but you may disagree.

Of the Hyatts in Tokyo, this was the one we elected to stay at a second time during a second trip this year. On our second stay, the staff impressed us even further, hand delivering a very heavy package to our room. Additionally, Jeffrey at the front desk did a great job remembering me and made me feel very special throughout my stay.

**Grand Hyatt Fukuoka (9.0)**

Felt super welcome here the entire time I was present. The most hospitable Grand Hyatt I've stayed at anywhere in the world. The location couldn't be better, right in the heart of Fukuoka. The club breakfast was super super good, and the snacks and drinks throughout the day were great (we had to skip filling up on afternoon food so that we could take in the rest of the city!). The room is undoubtably dated, but the shower pressure was extremely powerful so I can't possibly give this room a low score. Also the standard room was super spacious (ours had a hallway / WIC hybrid room which helped with spacing out our luggage), had a nice view of the river, and the bed was solid.

**Park Hyatt Paris Vendome (8.8)**

Actual bench in the gym. Great experience, loved this hotel. The room is a bit dated, but it's still nice. Great service, amazing breakfast. I would definitely stay again. Kind welcome gift of desserts and champagne. I cannot personally imagine a more ideal location in all of Paris as well. I liked it much more than others here have, and I thought the breakfast was very good.

**Andaz Singapore (8.7)**

Spent almost a month at this hotel, and was sad to leave. Loved the breakfast and the facilities (expansive SE Asia buffet selection, infinity pool, lots of common space, good gym with free weights). Agree with another review stating impersonal staff, however they moving my belongings to another room while I was away one weekend, and also comped me free breakfast for the entire trip, even though my GoH was only good for a week. Location was a bit tedious to get to, have to take stairs/escalator to elevator to second elevator, but more generally it is pretty central to a lot of food/shopping. I will note that there is no spa here which was disappointing

**Thompson Denver (8.6)**

Was my favorite Hyatt hard product until my most first trip to Japan this year. Corner room was spacious, clean, and felt brand new. Wood felt great, and comfortable bed. Really nice room design, and location is basically in the heart of downtown. At the time was informed the fitness center was unavailable which was a major detractor, and I did not have breakfast, so my score is a bit of a wash because of these factors, but I look to stay here again in the future if the opportunity presents itself.

**Grand Hyatt Indian Wells Resort & Villas (8.6)**

Okay so this breakfast was really good. It's a bit more of a limited selection, but if you like Southwestern food, you will be in heaven. The grounds are a dream come true for just about any family. The gym is solid and while we did not use the spa, it looked pleasant as well (no idea on cost or if it's included). We received an upgrade to a penthouse suite (standard suite, though the name may suggest otherwise) and thought it was excellent. No real complaints, other than the water pressure is on the weaker side (I get it, California is in a perpetual drought). Parking is not cheap, I think it was around $32 a night which is a bit silly since you're in the middle of an expansive desert. Next time I will try to stay at the Thompson Palm Springs, which I suspect I'll like more, but this was still really great and would happily return.

**Hyatt Place Moab (8.5)**

Great HP with great, top HP breakfast. Perfect location for entrance to Arches. Reasonable price for being so clean, modern, and nice. Next time I'll aim to enjoy more of the amenities, but they all looked great. Extremely strong HP hard product in the US.

**Park Hyatt Tokyo (8.5)**

I personally loved this hotel, but I understand why other more traveled guests may not feel so strongly about it. The room was dated, which clearly explains why the building underwent renovations. The staff guaranteed us a spot at the New York Bar which felt incredible, as when we arrived there was a line of 50+ people waiting for a table. We were able to skip the line without any issues. 10/10 stay for the common Lost In Translation fan. The location is the biggest detractor. The surrounding area is very quiet and far from most trains, and getting in/out of the building requires some time and effort. Shuttle service is only to Shinjuku station. We did not mind walking, but can't speak for all guests so trying to be objective.

**Hyatt Regency Kyoto (8.5)**

Was honestly disappointed by breakfast after reading reviews stating how good it was. Another example of there just being too much other good food in the city to waste calories on a mostly mid buffet. Exceptional staff, however, of the best of any hotel I've stayed at. We left a bag of antiques in our room and did not realize until we were half way back to Tokyo. One phone call and they overnighted it to our next hotel for only 1250 yen. This is the way.

Some will complain about location but we thought it was great, really close to some desirable temples that get crowded by 9 am, as well as free taxi from Kyoto station on arrival. Now you may be saying, OP, that was what subtracted score from the Park Hyatt Tokyo, but the key difference here was the improved proximity to more historical areas, and also away from some of the super crowded spots (Note: the biggest selling point of the Park Hyatt Kyoto is the location, but after 9 am, it's completely saturated with people. This location is not). Even though more expensive than HP and technically less central, we would stay here again.

**Hyatt Regency Hakone (8.3)**

Beautiful hotel common space design that felt inspired by the Park Hyatt Tokyo. Found the Japanese breakfast and dinner both excellent. Rooms felt very dated, though we were upgraded to a view of the tip of Mount Fuji which was much appreciated. Would consider staying here again.

**The Standard - East Village (8.3)**

Was upgraded to the corner deluxe room. I don’t stay in New York that often but by far the biggest room I've had with a great view and excellent shower. The smell of the bathroom products.. I miss them. Breakfast was good, I had a great French omelette and solid coffee, but very limited selection. Didn't have a chance to use any facilities but heard the gym is a day pass to Crunch which isn't ideal for a quick workout. Otherwise no complaints and by far my favorite of the Hyatts I've stayed at in New York.

**Hyatt Place Kyoto (8.2)**

The ""garden view"" is really just an airshaft that they stuck a very small zen garden in. Don't expect it to be a good view of anything. Room is clean and modern, spacious for Kyoto. Breakfast was appetizing. After staying a second time I do believe the breakfast here is pretty good, but with so much good food in Japan, it's hard to justify using up a meal here if it's not free. There is a sign right on the front desk that you will not be receiving any kind of upgrade as a Globalist.

I'm leaving my first stay review up for posterity, but I did stay here a second time and I feel like I had a better experience. Still got an airshaft room though. The breakfast felt better than the first time, making it really good in my opinion (better than the Regency Kyoto), and the location is extremely central while also avoiding huge amounts of crowds / touristy spots. One of the best donuts you'll ever have is an 8 min walk away, and if you ask nicely in the comments I'll let you in on my secrets. The gym is microscopic, but it's ok, you'll make up for it by walking 25K steps each day, right?

**Hyatt House Frankfurt Eschborn (8.1)**

Far from downtown, but the street of the property is quiet and serene. We were able to check in at 10 am as globalists, which was amazing because we just arrived via red eye. The room is really nice, seemed brand new. The bed was comfortable and the shower was great. I enjoyed breakfast as well, really good compared to US HH/HP, would definitely stay here again. We received a fruit basket with chocolate and chips, much appreciated. Even being far from the city proper, we regretted not staying here a second night and instead opting for the other hotel further down this list.

**Grand Hyatt Jeju (8.1)**

This is by far the most ""grand"" of the Grand Hyatts we've stayed at, and not really for good reasons. It is a maximalist casino vibe, which is super far from what we were expecting (this is my own fault, I did only superficial research). The hotel is huge, vast, too big. Thankfully the club was pretty relaxed vs the rest of the building each time we visited. The fitness center, pool, spa, etc were all basically at capacity each time I checked, so even though they appeared nice, it was difficult to enjoy throughout the stay. We thought the Club breakfast was pretty good, not amazing, but we did make a friend there so that made it much more memorable. The room was good, spacious and clean, and had a great view. No complaints there.

The location rating for this hotel is high not because the surrounding area is good, but because it offers easy escape routes to all of the better corners of the island via its strategic placement along multiple highway arteries. If you visit Jeju, I strongly advise getting out of the city of Jeju as much as possible, you will have a dramatically better time.

**Grand Hyatt Taipei (8.0)**

Literally across the street from Taipei 101, so just about as central as you can get. The room is a step down from the Grand Hyatt Jeju, and unfortunately the """"101 view"""" room is more of a view of its base than of the tower itself (at least in our room, there was an extension from the next floor up that prevented us from seeing anything beyond the first 1/3 of the skyscraper). The club breakfast was okay, I would recommend skipping it for the actual first floor breakfast which has about 5x the selection. I appreciate when a hotel with a club offers you access to either breakfast site so you can really compare, and in this case the winner is clear.

Great staff, we were able to get checked in early with a priority cleaning request, and just generally felt welcomed throughout, even if there was nothing particularly out of the ordinary said or offered. The spa/fitness center both appeared fine, but were crowded throughout our stay, similar to GH Jeju.

**Hyatt Place San Carlos (7.9)**

One of my favorite Hyatt Places, and likely the hotel I would choose vs others in the area on a future stay (or maybe I'll try the SFO GH). Above average breakfast, staff comped parking due to long check-in wait (was only 5-10 minutes, so really NBD). Brand new and spacious room, great location for access to SF and Menlo Park / Palo Alto etc (if you have a car)

**Andaz Amsterdam (7.7)**

Great location and view, interesting hotel and room design. I spent too much time in the toilet reading the wallpaper. Room key stopped working before checkout and it took almost 30 mins and multiple trips to resolve. On check in, agent rudely and loudly explained I was not elligible for free breakfast (understandable) and that it was too late to apply a GoH (okay sure). The way she announced this so the entire room could hear was quite embarrassing

**Caption by Hyatt Osaka Namba (7.6)**

Insanely good value if booked with points, only 5000 vs \~$200/night (at the time, think this may have jumped to 8-10?). Breakfast was so good, super fresh sashimi, but with a slight upcharge from globalist free (I think it was 1200 yen/person/day), but IMO well worth it. Room is small but clean and makes good use of limited space. Trying to get access to the two W/Ds is a bloodbath, I did my laundry from 2:30 - 4:30 am.

**Grand Hyatt Incheon (7.6)**

Quick one night stay here. Location is a wildcard here because it really is extremely close to the airport but with nothing else going on near it. No upgrade offered on my one night stay which is fine, and the front staff was very apologetic and endearing about it. Room was fine, nothing special, and the breakfast was on the weaker side compared to all of the other great breakfasts I've had in Japan and Korea. However the fitness center and pool were both great and while I did not visit the spa, it looked really nice as well.

**Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress (7.6)**

I had a mixed stay here. I took my parents here and booked a suite thinking that the living room would be acceptable for me to sleep in, given that the listing says that this configuration sleeps 4. I was mistaken, as the pull out couch was about 1 inch thick and felt like laying on a pile of shovels. I asked what options were available for me aside from booking a second room (which I was prepared to do as a last resort), and was told I could pay $35 for a twin bed to be rolled in. I was able to get the twin bed for free by talking a bit more about it, which was appreciated, but it ended up getting delivered to my parents' room. After getting the bed situation squared away, the stay got a bit better. I wasn't super impressed by the room -- it felt a bit dated (shower was pretty decent at least), but the grounds were by contrast amazing, especially for families. Breakfast was super solid IMO, better than I expected, and the staff there were very kind and personable. They made sure to take good care of my mom and dad. Parking gave me sticker shock, but guess that's Orlando.

**Hyatt House Santa Clara (7.2)**

Stayed here for a week and honestly liked it a lot, aside from the breakfast. Room was spacious and clean, bed was extremely comfortable, great shower water pressure. Right off multiple highways and in a plaza with a ton of walkable stuff (was Ubering otherwise)

**Hyatt Place Times Square (7.1)**

First time staying in a hotel in NYC since leaving the city (I am back in New York now so no more Hyatt stays here for the time being). I felt like an intruder, but the staff was super kind and friendly. Quickly recognized my Globalist status and gave me a free tray of cookies and a handwritten note on both stays. Room is small but not embarrassingly so, especially for New York. Location is not times square, so definitely pay attention to that if you need that (I didn't). Breakfast was good but super hectic as the entire building gets it for free (I think?), which in NYC is a significant opportunity savings. Fully staffed front desk so easy and quick check in/out

**Hyatt Place Pasadena (7.0)**

Great HP in Pasadena. Cheapest parking out of LA Hyatts (I think it was $25ish/night?), have stayed 3x. Above average breakfast vs other US Hyatt Places I've been to, room is really big for a HP as well. I definitely recommend this one over the HHs I've stayed at in LA and OC.

**Hyatt Regency Newport Beach West (7.0)**

First Discoverist stay. Pretty unremarkable, but pretty interior of building. Reminded me of the Embassy Suites I idolized when I was a kid. Kind staff but somewhat cold and provided nothing above and beyond. Felt embarrassed asking for free water (something I eventually had to get over)

**Hyatt Regency Etoile (7.0)**

Nice hotel, but very out of the way of most things in the city that I care about, and a huge traffic jam any time you need to go anywhere via car. However, the subway works fine here. Thought the club breakfast was actually inferior to the expansive main downstairs breakfast (exact same feedback as Taipei), but enjoyed the club's afternoon snacks. Would I stay here again? Given the cost of the Vendome, yes.

**Hyatt Regency SLC (6.9)**

Room was barely nicer than a HP, so I guess I'm thrown off by the branding. By contract, excellent fitness center with everything you could need. Last stay needed for Globalist so did not try their breakfast.

**Grand Hyatt Denver (6.9)**

Large, clean room with tons of extra space. Shower pressure is weak. Hotel is starting to show some signs of age in the hallways, fitness center, and communal areas. Great breakfast with really kind staff. Pancakes were delicious/ Front desk was kind on check in and helped me get a corner room, no suites available.

**Hyatt Centric Mountain View (6.5)**

Weird hotel. Great location in the heart of MTV, and interesting hotel design. Cold, somewhat rigid staff gave me grief to watch my bags for a few hours before room became available. Very poor wifi in my room, no resolution offered

**The Pell (6.5)**

Unremarkable and good. Much better than the Mystic discussed later. they have a hard $500 fine for anyone who vapes in the room, so make sure you don't do that!

**Hyatt Regency Jersey City on the Hudson (6.4)**

100 feet from path station, so can be to WTC in 5-10 min. Even after renovation, room feels like a Hyatt Place, or maybe even a bit less ""standard"". Very loud on weekends, could hear music at 1 AM coming from the ballroom. Breakfast was $45pp for the buffet, which was only marginally higher quality than any HP breakfast (Globalist is free but still worth noting). Negative parking experience, but in part due to my own error. Did not bring my valet key as did not realize that Globalist free parking was valet only, so ended up having to use a 3P parking garage. Valet would not allow me to self park, even though I saw the same cars in the same spots at check-in and check-out, without any car blocking happening.

**Hyatt Centric Downtown Denver (6.3)**

Bed is extremely soft so firm mattress sleepers beware. Shower pressure is really bad but room is otherwise unremarkable/good. breakfast is slow and below average, and the restaurant staff seemed to really be struggling to keep up. Gym is modern, clean, with pelotons and technogym equipment. No official upgrade, but got a corner room, however, there's only a window on one side, so is it really a corner?

**Hyatt House San Diego Sorrento Mesa (6.1)**

Arrived late and checked out early, so my review is lacking. Hotel was buried atop a hill and surrounded by business parks, so nothing interesting in the immediate vacinity. Gym was very small. Pool looked nice, but had no time. Room felt more dated than Hyatt House Santa Clara.

**Hyatt Regency Boston - Cambridge (6.1)**

Good breakfast and gym, but it sounds like there are much better Hyatts in Boston. The person who checked me in seemed like they were having an especially bad day, and they did not acknowledge my status, offer me a breakfast voucher, or explain parking even after I asked. I went down the next morning to ask about breakfast and the same person was there, but thankfully I spoke with someone else who was very confused and apologetic. Room was outdated, water pressure was acceptable but not amazing. My dislike of Regencies continues

**Hyatt Place Long Island City (5.9)**

Really big room for New York (though it is in queens). While the location isn't super central, it's close to the 7 and lots of good Asian food. Water pressure is probably the worst of any Hyatt. Breakfast is average for HP (note: on stays 2 and 3, it fell to below average). Overall I prefer the Times Square HP.

**Lindner Hotel Frankfurt Main (5.7)**

No early check in, no late checkout, no welcome acknowledgement, no status recognition. Room is far too big, it could be 2.5 units, no wonder there's limited availability. Poorly decorated and old. The gym is small but adequate, there is also a sauna and pool. Ordered water to the room, it never came.

**Hyatt House Boston / Waltham (5.3)**

In retrospect one of the weaker HP hard products, but I found the staff exceptionally kind and the breakfast cozy and slightly above average for HP. Something about the hotel felt very friendly and warm to me, that hasn't been captured as well in other Hyatt Places. I would not mind staying here again if I return to the Boston area, given the price.

**Hyatt Regency Sonoma (5.2)**

Complimentary room upgrade to deluxe, but hard product still felt dated and a bit sad. Comfortable bed however. Advertised as Sonoma but was really in Santa Rosa, 40 min drive to Sonoma proper

**Hyatt Centric Midtown 5th Avenue (4.9)**

On my third stay in NYC, wanted to switch it up from the HP and regret doing so. No room upgrade (was told I was already in the best room with a balcony; no balcony given and definitely not the best room). Somehow a worse room than HP TS. Breakfast was very slow and bad (limited menu for Globalists vs access to the entire menu, no buffet). Only one staff for check-in, check-out, so be prepared to wait a minute.

**Hyatt House Cypress Anaheim (4.8)**

One of the worst breakfasts of any HP/HH I've stayed at, but I appreciate that they offered Miso soup and tofu. Room situation was difficult because I specifically requested a room with a desk, didn't get one, and then had to wait until the second day of my stay to get moved into a room with one.

**Wild Palms Hotel (4.5)**

Unremarkable stay before I ended up going all in on Hyatt. Remembered more fondly than Avante, but nothing about the stay stood out to me in a positive way. Staff were pleasant throughout. I did not include breakfast, or did not consider it as free, not sure which it actually was at the time. Larger than average room, but stylings are a bit weird.

**Hotel Wallace (4.5)**

Room was microscopic, with no room for opening luggage anywhere but on my bed. Shower was a half glass setup, but worse than what you're imagining in that it actually caused water to spill everywhere. View was of a brick wall. I can't really recommend this hotel unless you opt for a more expensive room, or are staying here literally just for sleep and nothing else. Location is good.

**Hyatt Place Mystic (4.4)**

A nice, large room, but that's all I have to say that is good about this hotel. The water pressure is the worst out of any hotel I've stayed in in this entire list. It's the equivalent to plant watering canister. The gym was just two treadmills, an elliptical, a peloton, and 5 pound weights. Five pounds! Further, the breakfast was the worst of any HP/HH I've been to - the eggs were glowing yellow, and other foods (frittata bites) were cold in the center. Truly a gross experience. It's insane that this hotel was as expensive as it was, I paid $220 for a king room on a non-holiday Tuesday. I arrived at 7 pm and was never greeted as a globalist, but instead informed the only king left in the building was next to the elevator. I said was there no other options to keep a nicer positioned room stored for me, and they said no, we're fully booked. Then, I woke up to a note slipped under the door trying to get me to stay a second night.

**Hyatt House LA University Medical Center (3.7)**

I wanted to like this hotel and defy the negative reviews, but sadly it was just not possible. I have so many complaints.. the room is fine and the bed is comfortable, but the shower has basically zero water pressure and a strong sulfuric smell. I think if my girlfriend used conditioner at any point in our stay, she would still be in there today. The breakfast was below average, bordering on very bad, but the oatmeal was decent. Getting hot water after 9:30 requires standing around for 5 minutes while someone sighs and runs off to a kitchen somewhere. Staff really need to be retrained. No water in my room, was told the hotel does not offer water (I told them I am a globalist and they quickly changed tune), I had to re-request parking on the second night, my room key stopped working on the second day, and overall everyone just seemed completely clueless throughout the entire time. Also the entire downstairs plays like club music very loudly 24/7 to the point where you need noise cancelling headphones just to work outside of your room. Also the windows in your room don't open! Lastly, yes, there are trains next to this hotel running 24/7, blowing their horns all the time, and you will hear it. It will wake you up, I guarantee it. The gym is fine and there is a pool.

So I have a smoothie and coffee everyday. I really try to reduce dairy, I’ve never liked milk. I only eat kefir yoghurt & some Parmesan basically. 

I started using an almond milk with no added ingredients in my smoothies and whilst it’s nice and doesn’t seem to have a negative effect, I’m concerned I’m now lacking calcium without dairy or fortified milks (I logged on Cronometer for a few days and my calcium level was low). 

Do any of you use traditionally fortified plant milks without issue?

I also don’t like almond milk in my coffee so I’m lost. I left oat behind as it seemed to inflame me, but I have soy milk maybe once a week at a coffee shop and would rather not have it daily. 

I know this will be a trial and error thing, but what works for you guys? 

On a tangent, what else can I include in my diet to increase my calcium if I don’t eat much dairy.

It’s nothing fancy, just a Kambu Koozh stall. For those who don’t know, Kambu Koozh is a pearl millet porridge usually served with thick curd or buttermilk. It’s very tasty, healthy and a filling breakfast option. In Tamil Nadu, people grab a cup for just ₹30 and it keeps them full for a long time. I’ve even seen a small vendor selling it without any employees making 100-200 plus every day and selling out completely.

In a city where people often rely on unhealthy snacks during breaks or in the mornings, this could be a great alternative. Places like Infopark are perfect, people often step out for chai or coffee and a healthy option like this would surely be popular.

[China has been building its dominance in rare-earth minerals since the 1990s.© Doug Kanter\/Bloomberg News](https://preview.redd.it/5bz88beu1m0g1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ba0baff21b58535e0fc69a1258e89deeb121300)

China plans to ease the flow of [rare earths](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/how-china-took-over-the-worlds-rare-earths-industry-fb668839) and other restricted materials to the U.S. by designing a system that will exclude companies with ties to the U.S. military while fast-tracking export approvals for other firms, according to people familiar with the plan.

The “validated end-user” system, or VEU, would enable Chinese leader Xi Jinping to follow through on [a pledge](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/trump-meets-xi-for-high-stakes-u-s-china-summit-a9c7738f) to President Trump to facilitate the export of such materials while ensuring that they don’t end up with U.S. military suppliers, a core concern for China, according to the people familiar with the plan.

If strictly implemented, the system could make importing certain Chinese materials more difficult for automotive and aerospace companies that have both civilian and defense clients. Beijing’s plan could still change and its licensing system wouldn’t be certain until it is implemented, the people said.

China’s Ministry of Commerce didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Rare-earth magnets and other restricted materials are used widely in civilian goods such as electric vehicles and passenger jets, but are also needed in jet fighters, submarines and attack drones.

The VEU mechanism that Beijing is considering is modeled on U.S. laws and procedures, as is [much of Beijing’s export-control architecture](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-trump-tariff-trade-war-response-1ac838b0).

Under the American version of the VEU system, which has been active since 2007, certain Chinese companies are cleared to buy sensitive goods under a general authorization—essentially a simplified export-approval mechanism—instead of needing individual licenses for each purchase.

This makes it easier to import controlled goods such as chemicals or chip-making equipment, but requires companies to put up with U.S. government inspections of their facilities, among other steps, to verify compliance with the program.

Since April, Beijing has used restrictions on the export of [powerful rare-earth magnets](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/dyspro-what-why-an-obscure-element-has-the-ev-industry-in-a-panic-70623bf4) to win concessions from the U.S. in the trade war. Following the Oct. 30 truce between Trump and Xi, which saw both sides make concessions, China has publicly committed to issuing general licenses to ease the flow of controlled materials.

While Trump has said that the issuance of general licenses by Beijing will mark the de facto end of export curbs on critical materials, Beijing appears to be keeping some of the controls in place, even as it tries to ease exports for proven civilian uses.

***Beijing hasn’t made clear which companies will be eligible for general licenses, or exactly what benefits such licenses would provide.***

It isn’t clear how long VEU protections would last. Under the U.S. system, Chinese companies that are cleared to receive purchases under the VEU sometimes have this clearance taken away, which has caused consternation in Beijing.

As a result, many companies may continue to decide to seek out alternative sources of controlled products, even if they can benefit from China’s VEU arrangement.

***In recent months, companies in the U.S. and Europe have complained of reduced access to rare-earth magnets. Though China has periodically agreed to relax magnet restrictions, Chinese rare-earth magnet exports to the U.S. declined 29% in September from the month before, in a sign that curbs continued to affect companies in the weeks leading up to the truce.***

China is reportedly preparing new measures to control the flow of rare earth elements and other critical materials to the United States, according to a report by *The Wall Street Journal*. The initiative aims to create a “validated end-user” (VEU) system designed to restrict exports to companies linked to the U.S. military, while facilitating shipments to civilian firms.

This policy move underscores Beijing’s strategic leverage in the global rare earth market, where China remains the world’s dominant supplier. Rare earth elements are vital for producing a wide range of products, from smartphones and electric vehicles to advanced military technologies and renewable energy equipment.

The proposed VEU system will enable China to identify and approve buyers that qualify for streamlined imports, ensuring faster access for non-military enterprises. At the same time, it will allow Beijing to tighten control over firms with both civilian and defense contracts—potentially complicating supply chains for U.S. manufacturers reliant on these materials.

The decision also aligns with Chinese President Xi Jinping’s pledge to U.S. President Donald Trump to resume rare earth exports to the American market, signaling a partial easing of trade restrictions. However, analysts suggest that the system could serve as a tool for China to maintain influence over critical supply chains while appearing cooperative on the international stage.

**In response, Washington has intensified efforts to diversify its rare earth sources, securing new agreements with allied nations. Notably, Australian company Lynas Rare Earths Ltd (ASX:LYC)—the largest rare earth producer outside China—has become a key player in the U.S. strategy to reduce dependence on Chinese supply.**

# ✅ Positioned at the center of the U.S. Critical Minerals strategy, NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project offers:

* Multiple \*\*\***Top 10 USGS-listed minerals = (\*\*\*Niobium, Terbium & Dysprosium)**
* **Supply chain independence from China & Russia**
* Vertical integration across mining, advanced processing, and **future recycling**
* Alignment with the **MCS (Multilateral Commercial Stockpile)**, **DoD offtakes**, **EXIM funding**, and a **DFARs compliant U.S. secure, domestic, generational source located in Nebraska!**

# NioCorp: The Strategic Basket

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project isn’t just another mine — it’s a **national industrial base reset button**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek’s mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# 🔑 The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)** – The *quiet giant*. From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. Elk Creek could supply a good portion — potentially all — of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.
* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl₄)** – Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl₄ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)** – *The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)** – The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships. *Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

[🔥 \\""FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE\\"" — Nb, Sc, Ti & REE! 🔥When NioCorp CEO Mark Smith dropped that line, it wasn’t hype — it was a warning shot to the entire U.S. defense and aerospace sector. With Elk Creek now owning a full square mile and standing as America’s only DFARS-compliant source of Niobium, Scandium, Titanium, and Rare Earth Elements \(Nd, Pr, Dy, Tb\), the message is crystal clear: Lock in your offtake now or get left behind. Every F-35, SMR, and EV magnet built in the next decade will need these materials, and once early contracts are inked with Lockheed, RTX, and DOE programs, there won’t be much left on the shelf. Elk Creek isn’t just a mine — it’s the new gatekeeper of U.S. materials sovereignty.](https://reddit.com/link/1ou849r/video/6cxem564dm0g1/player)

# 🧭 “The 1-Mile Lock-Up: NioCorp Secures America’s Critical Minerals Future”

On November 10th, 2025, NioCorp quietly crossed a threshold that could redefine America’s critical minerals landscape. The company officially completed the acquisition of all land required to launch its Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project in Nebraska — locking down an entire one-square-mile section of property that will host both its underground mine and integrated surface processing complex. This “1 Mile Lock-Up” gives NioCorp full ownership and control of every surface and mineral right necessary to begin construction, eliminating access and permitting risks while reserving expansion options on surrounding parcels. It’s more than a real-estate move — it’s a signal of operational readiness, made possible by over $360 million in equity financing raised in the past year. With the land secured, the path to full financing and construction is now wide open.

This milestone comes just days after the U.S. Department of the Interior released its Final 2025 List of Critical Minerals, reaffirming that mineral security is now national security. **Among the 60 materials listed, Niobium, Dysprosium, and Terbium rank among the nation’s top-ten priorities — and all three are found in NioCorp’s Elk Creek resource, alongside Scandium, Titanium, Neodymium, and Praseodymium.** That makes Elk Creek the only U.S. project capable of supplying seven federally listed critical minerals — from one site, on U.S. soil. If December’s final assays confirm a speculative expansion toward a 1-million-tonne TREO resource base, Elk Creek could instantly become the strategic basket for U.S. supply-chain independence across defense, aerospace, EVs, clean energy, and quantum systems.

The implications are enormous. Once NioCorp completes project financing and receives its expected EXIM Bank Final Investment Decision (Q1 2026?), the United States gains more than a mine — it gains a secure, vertically integrated industrial base asset. Elk Creek’s design covers every link of the value chain: from mine to oxide to alloy to recycling, all within the U.S. This means fully DFARS-compliant feedstock for the Pentagon, the DOE, and major aerospace primes — directly aligned with federal initiatives like the Multilateral Commercial Stockpile (MCS) and Defense Production Act Title III. ***Each product stream — Niobium, Scandium, Titanium compounds, and REEs — feeds a mission-critical sector: jet engines, lightweight alloys, permanent magnets, SMRs, EV drivetrains, and advanced defense systems.***

With top engineering partners Zachry Group (surface) and Dumas (underground) already engaged, an updated Definitive Feasibility Study and ESIA expected in early 2026, and roughly $360 million in cash on hand, NioCorp is positioning itself as the backbone of America’s mineral independence strategy. The Elk Creek Project’s 38-year mine life ensures continuity of supply for the next generation of clean-energy and defense technologies — from F-35 fighters and hypersonic platforms to small modular reactors and magnet factories.

**In short, NioCorp’s 1 Mile Lock-Up isn’t just about land. It’s a declaration of intent.** With ownership, permits, and process validation complete, and final assays and financing on deck, Elk Creek stands ready to anchor a new era of American industrial self-reliance. When history looks back on where U.S. mineral sovereignty truly began, it may point to this moment — when a single square mile in Nebraska became a cornerstone of America’s critical minerals future.

# — and it’s clear: NioCorp isn’t just about magnets. It’s part of the U.S. Critical Minerals Solution!

# — A game-changer for American Resource Independence by 2028/29 and beyond.

# ""Elk Creek's “U.S. National Security Asset"" is here to stay! — 🛰️⚡

# 💥  Resource Reclassification — “Speculative to Strategic”

IMHO- Once additional ore is confirmed via remaining pending assays, NioCorp effectively transitions to becoming **a central node of U.S. critical minerals independence** — the **“Fort Knox of Functional Metals \~ Niobium, Scandium, Titanium & REE's.”**  
Thinking... Mark Smith’s **“First Come, First Serve”** comment ***=*** the larger the resource, the **more exclusive early allocations become**, since offtake volumes will be reserved for strategic customers — defense, aerospace, and energy sectors first.

I want to get my boyfriend a moka as a gift since he loves coffee, but I'm a little stuck on which one to get since I know almost nothing about coffee and don't drink it as much. 

I really like the Bialetti Brikka 4 Cup, I read that it gives you cca 120ml of coffee so since he normally drinks a long or a short + long Nespresso, usually a strong arabica, I'm assuming the size would be okay? He's a huge coffee drinker, drinks probably around 6 cups of such espressos a day, some with some without caffeine. 

I watched some videos too and most recommended a 3 cup, but the Bialetti Brikka only comes in 2 or 4 cups, so not sure if the 4 cup will be too much?

Any recommendation? Or even different type or brand recommendations? I'm open to spend more on something that's good quality and gives the results. ",4,1762863936.0,mokapot,3,0.84,False
1ou83iv,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamInterpretation/comments/1ou83iv/really_strange_dream/,Really strange dream,"I was giving a class presentation on why I wanted to be a teacher while on my period. I talked about how when I first started trying to become one, I thought I would become less human because of how people talk about the job, but that I still get my period. I then started to bleed really heavily, and when I sat down there was a big pool of blood, so I got up to go to the bathroom and I wiped my seat with my sleeve, and the blood turned into a picture of a dragon. My boyfriend gave me his hoodie to cover the blood, and I slipped a tampon into my sleeve, took my face wash and contact solution out of my backpack, and started heading towards the bathroom. I was having trouble finding the bathroom because the school had been partially renovated to have a huge cafe. I walked past a guy from my high school who made distant commentary that helped me find the washroom. I didn’t say anything back to him.

I walked into the large cafe because the washrooms were in the back, and I gazed at all the new things and items on the menu. I got a fancy coffee drink and some chicken fingers and fries that I planned to share with my boyfriend. The girl at the counter was older and kind of dingy but nice. I asked for a dip with my chicken fingers. She offered a lot of sweet dips like sour strawberry watermelon. I asked if she had ranch, and she did, but she gave me some of the other dip to sample as well. The phone was non-stop ringing. She picked it up and told the police on the other side that she was no longer going to answer the phone because she knows it’s dangerous here and gets 50 calls a day, but she’s protected and can’t do anything else about it. She told me I should probably get going soon.

I washed all my clothes because I was covered in my blood and then headed back to class with my food. I started playing with files on my computer, and my boyfriend said there was a sticker on his sweater that was now missing. I told him that he needs to tell me when he has easily loseable things on his clothes when he gives them to me. I told him I had food for him and that I washed the sweater. He found the sticker just slightly off-placed. It was a little bone sticker. I began sorting his clothes in piles, sweaters and shirts, while he ate the chicken fingers. I picked flowers and put them in a vase next to his clothes. The flowers shrank small, but I remember thinking they were still pretty.

Someone said, “Are you guys dating? How long? I didn’t know?” I said, “I don’t know if we’re dating, but we are together.” I continued to sort files on my computer. There was this weird poem written with all the words smooshed together without spaces, so it was hard to read. Then I clicked on it and it expanded. It read something along the lines of “Do you think of your mother dead, do you think of your mother dead? Death thinks of you.” 

Then I got a sharp pain in my lower back and I woke up.

Not sure what to change.,"I’m trying to figure out how to get a good, consistent cup on weekdays without overthinking it or spending even more money on gear upgrades. I know I don’t have the best grinder setup, but I want to do this practically.

My setup:
Breville Precision Brewer, cone basket, Gold/My Brew mode 
1Zpresso J Manual grinder but mostly I was using a KitchenAid grinder toward a more medium grind. Anything finer was way too bitter. 
Light–medium roast beans
Paper filter, rinsed
Typically 50g coffee for 30oz water

Problem:
I’ve been testing different doses, grind settings, bloom times, and temps:
60 g coffee → too bitter/stinging
50 g coffee → flat/papery

Today I tried a 16 oz test with my 1zpresso and slightly better, but still flat. I think too corse. 

I’ve tried 198–203 °F, 30–45 s bloom, medium flow. The coffee is improving, but it’s still missing sweetness, liveliness, or body.

I’m mainly looking for a reliable weekday recipe. nothing perfect, just a cup I can enjoy without wasting more beans and have auto drip. I’m ready to throw it all out actually. Seems like I don’t even know what coffee is supposed to taste like now.

🔥 When you’re engaged to the perfect man… but his best friend awakens something you can’t ignore | NALA: PART 1 AND 2","Hey everyone, I’m Elo — I create cinematic African stories on my YouTube channel Storytime with Elo.

“Nala” is a modern love drama about a young lawyer torn between safety and passion. It’s rich with culture, emotion, and messy choices.

 

**NALA: PART 1 – THE RIGHT THING**

Nairobi pulsed beneath the late afternoon sun, restless and alive. Matatus rattled past, their horns sharp and insistent, painted with wild colours and faces of pop stars. Hawkers called out in rapid bursts, waving packets of roasted groundnuts, belts, and knock-off sunglasses at anyone who made eye contact. The air carried a mix of roasted maize, exhaust, and the metallic tang left behind by a light drizzle.

Nala Mwende threaded her way along Kenyatta Avenue with measured steps, her heels sharp against the pavement. She carried herself with a deliberate grace, her back straight, her chin high, as though the chaos of the city would never dare touch her. Her cocoa-toned skin caught the glow of the dipping sun, her braids pulled into a tight, high bun that sharpened her features into something elegant, even untouchable.

From the outside, Nala was everything a woman was supposed to be: ambitious, disciplined, in control. Twenty-eight years old, law degree in her pocket, internship at a respected firm, fiancé with a future so stable and polished her parents boasted about him to neighbours. She had built her life like a meticulously balanced argument—logical, tidy, correct.

But beneath that veneer, something restless lived inside her.

For years, she had been the girl who always did the right thing: studying late into the night while her friends were out dancing, saying no to wild detours, standing by David through the gruelling years of med school. She had given so much of herself to duty, to responsibility, to what was expected, that she sometimes wondered what was left for her.

David Otieno. Her fiancé. He was kind, dependable, adored by her family. He was the very definition of “a good man.” And she loved him, in a steady, careful way. Yet love with David was like the Nairobi traffic on a Monday morning: predictable, unmoving, a line of cars that stretched forever without surprise. Nala and David shared a modest apartment on State House Road. It was close enough to the hospital for David to run back between shifts, and spacious enough for Nala to carve out a study corner with her law books. Their families had never been told—they wouldn’t have approved. Her mother had once said cohabiting before marriage was “a curse you invite yourself.” David’s parents were equally old-fashioned. But they had been together five years, engaged for one, and practicality had quietly won.

On the surface, their life was neat. Two mugs hanging on hooks in the kitchen, a soft blue throw on the couch, a small balcony where they sometimes drank tea together at night. It was safe. Predictable. But lately, safe felt suffocating. Safe.

And safety, Nala was beginning to admit, had grown suffocating.

The thought was dangerous, and she knew it. So she buried it beneath the rhythm of her heels and the curve of her practiced smile.

At Nala’s parental home, the air always smelled faintly of boiled maize and bleach. Her mother insisted on scrubbing every corner until the house gleamed, as though cleanliness alone could ward off misfortune. Mama Mwende was a woman with opinions as sharp as her cheekbones: practical, firm, the kind of mother who saw sacrifice as a badge of honour. To her, David was not just a man; he was proof that all her years of labour, saving and praying, had borne fruit.

“Eh, Nala,” Mama said one evening, adjusting the scarf tied around her head as she stirred a pot on the stove. “That man will make you a doctor’s wife. Do you know what that means? Respect. Security. A name in society. You are blessed, my daughter.”

Blessed. The word hung heavy in the kitchen, caught between the steam and the clatter of the wooden spoon.

Her father, Baba Mwende, was different. Where Mama sharpened, Baba softened. He was tall, slightly stooped now, his palms calloused from years of factory shifts. He had the gentlest eyes Nala had ever known, but they carried expectations too—quiet, heavy ones.

“Your mother is right,” he said from his chair, folding the day’s newspaper. “I see how David looks at you. He is steady. A man must be steady, Nala. The rest comes and goes, but steadiness lasts.”

She smiled dutifully, nodding at the right times, but inside, something coiled tighter.

Being an only child meant there was no one else to absorb the dreams her parents pinned on her. No one else to distract them, to divide the weight. It was all on her shoulders: the hope of comfort in their old age, the promise of respectability, the pride of having raised a daughter who chose wisely.

And choosing wisely, of course, meant David.

David, who brought her mother pineapples after his hospital shifts. David, who helped her father carry water buckets when the taps ran dry. David, who sat in their living room with such ease it felt as if he had always belonged to them.

Nala watched it all with a careful smile, folding laundry as her mother praised him, listening as her father marvelled at his discipline. They saw a future of certainty. But she—she sometimes saw a cage, painted in the warm colours of approval.

If her parents were the voice of duty, Miriam was the voice of mischief.

They had met in law school, thrown together in a study group. Where Nala lived by color-coded notes and late nights at the library, Miriam breezed in with braids dyed honey-blonde, oversized earrings, and a laugh that could rattle the walls. She had a sharp wit, a habit of skipping classes to chase “networking opportunities,” and a knack for coaxing Nala out of her rigid shell.

One Saturday afternoon, they sat at a café in Kilimani, the clatter of cups and smell of spiced tea swirling around them. Miriam sipped her cappuccino and leaned back, eyes dancing.

“So,” she said, drawing out the word, “how’s life with Nairobi’s most eligible doctor-to-be? Are we still swooning at bedtime stories about anatomy?”

Nala rolled her eyes, stirring her tea. “David is… good.”

“Good,” Miriam repeated with mock solemnity. “Good is how you describe tea that’s lukewarm or a dress that doesn’t itch. You’ve been with him five years, Nala. I want fireworks, not ‘good.’”

“You don’t understand,” Nala countered. “He’s steady. He cares. My parents adore him. That matters.”

“Of course it matters,” Miriam said, waving her spoon. “But since when is marriage supposed to be a group project with your parents? You’re the one who has to wake up next to him forever.” She leaned forward, lowering her voice. “And honestly? You sound… bored.”

Nala bristled, though the word struck a little too close. “I’m not bored. I’m just… focused. Law is demanding. Life is demanding.”

Miriam smirked, unbothered. “Focused is fine. But don’t confuse sacrifice with happiness. You deserve both.” She took another sip, then added slyly, “Besides, if a fine, dangerous stranger walked in right now and looked at you like you were oxygen, would you still call David ‘good’?”

Nala laughed despite herself, shaking her head. “You’re impossible.”

“And you,” Miriam said with a grin, “are too careful. One day, life will throw you a curve, and I can’t wait to see what you do.”

Nala didn’t reply. She only smiled faintly, pushing her spoon through her tea. Miriam didn’t know it, but that curve was already on its way.

A few days after her coffee with Miriam, David came home carrying a bag of groceries, his tie loosened after a long hospital shift. He smelled faintly of antiseptic and cologne, a combination that had become his signature.

He kissed her cheek in passing and began unloading vegetables onto the counter. “We’re having company tomorrow,” he said matter-of-factly, handing her a bundle of spinach.

“Company?” she asked, raising a brow.

“Jabari.” His face brightened. “You’ve heard me talk about him since forever. My best friend. He’s finally back from the UK. I can’t wait for you to meet him.”

Nala nodded, stirring a pot on the stove. David had told her stories of his childhood friend many times—football matches that stretched past sunset, wild teenage escapades, promises of brotherhood sealed long ago. To Nala, Jabari had always been a character in David’s past, nothing more.

The following evening, Nala set the table, adjusting the cutlery twice though it hardly needed it. She wore a simple black dress, her hair pulled into a neat bun. David moved around the kitchen, humming under his breath, happier than she had seen him in weeks.

When the doorbell rang, David’s grin spread wide. He hurried to open it.

And there he was.

Jabari stepped into the room with a presence that seemed to shift the air itself. He was taller than she expected, broad-shouldered, his chocolate-toned skin gleaming under the light. His eyes—dark, intense, flecked with amber—lingered on her just a second too long before he broke into a grin and embraced David in a clap of brotherhood.

“Look at you,” David laughed, holding him at arm’s length. “The same troublemaker, just in a suit now.”

They both chuckled, their bond effortless, old as time. Nala smiled politely, offering her hand when David introduced them.

“This is Nala,” David said proudly. “My fiancée.”

Her hand slid into Jabari’s. His grip was warm, firm, deliberate. Their eyes met, and something sharp shot through her chest—unexpected, unsettling.

“Finally,” Jabari said, his voice smooth, low, threaded with Swahili warmth. “The woman who’s tamed him.” His lips curved, not quite a smile, not quite a tease.

Dinner began politely enough. David spoke animatedly about rotations and exams, his hands moving as he told stories from the ward. Jabari listened, interjecting with questions, but every so often, his gaze drifted back to Nala. She felt it like a touch, even when she focused on her plate.

At one point, she rose to fetch more water from the kitchen. When she returned, Jabari’s eyes followed her movements with quiet intensity. She ignored it, but her pulse betrayed her.

After dinner, the three of them stepped out to the balcony. The city stretched beneath them, glittering and damp from a light drizzle. Horns blared faintly from below, the night thick with the scent of rain on asphalt.

David excused himself to take a call, leaving them in the cool night air.

For a moment, silence reigned. Then Jabari spoke.

“You always seem… perfect,” he said quietly, leaning on the railing. “Even now, when you’re just standing here. But I wonder…” His eyes caught hers, steady, unflinching. “…do you ever let yourself breathe?”

Her lips parted, but no sound came. She turned toward the lights of the city, her hands tightening on the railing. No one had ever asked her that.

Before she could reply, David returned, cheerful and oblivious, and the moment dissolved. But it lingered, etched into her skin.

Later that night, long after David had left for the hospital, Nala sat in her bedroom, staring at her phone. A message had appeared.

*Let’s meet. Just the two of us.* – Jabari.

Her pulse pounded. She set the phone down, then picked it up again. The words glowed on the screen, daring her.

Her hand trembled with the weight of one choice.

The message glowed on her screen all night. *Let’s meet. Just the two of us.*

Nala lay awake, staring at the ceiling, heart thudding with a mix of guilt and desire. She knew what the right thing was: delete the message, roll over, and call David in the morning to tell him about it. But her thumb hovered, betraying her.

By evening the next day, she found herself standing outside a rooftop bar in Westlands, the kind of place where the city spread beneath you in glittering chaos. She told herself she was only coming for clarity, to prove to herself there was nothing here. But the moment she saw him leaning against the railing, blazer unbuttoned, shirt collar loose, his skin catching the city lights, every rational thought deserted her.

“Glad you came,” Jabari said, voice smooth and low, like a secret.

“I shouldn’t be here,” she replied, though her feet carried her closer.

“Maybe not,” he said with a slow smile. “But you wanted to.”

Their conversation danced around the surface at first—his years in London, her cases at the firm—but beneath it, something darker hummed. The way his eyes held hers a second too long. The way he leaned in as though every word she spoke was worth keeping. She felt alive in a way she hadn’t in years, as though the city itself had poured fire into her veins.

When his fingers brushed hers on the table, a spark shot through her so sharp she almost pulled away. Almost. Instead, she let it linger.

“You feel it too,” he murmured, more statement than question.

Her chest rose and fell too fast. She swallowed, eyes darting away. “This is madness. David trusts us both.”

His smile faded, replaced by something softer, more dangerous. “I love him like a brother. I’d never set out to hurt him. But you…” His eyes darkened, voice dropping lower. “You undo me, Nala. I can’t stop thinking about you.”

The words seared through her. She should have run. Instead, she leaned in, breath trembling. “Don’t say that.”

“I have to,” he said, and the intensity in his gaze made her feel naked. “You’re not like anyone else. I’ve been with women before, plenty, but none of them—none—ever felt like this.”

The air between them throbbed with heat, her pulse matching it.

When she finally pulled back, heart racing, she knew she was already lost.

Later, in her bedroom, Miriam’s words echoed in her mind: *One day, life will throw you a curve, and I can’t wait to see what you do.*

Well, here it was. And she was no longer certain she wanted to dodge it.



**PART 2: ADDICTED**

The messages began innocently enough.

*How was your day?*  
*Can’t stop thinking about last night.*  
*You looked incredible in that dress.*

At first, Nala told herself she could stop whenever she wanted. That these late-night texts weren’t betrayal, not really — just words, just harmless connection. But soon her phone was buzzing at all hours, and she lived for the glow of Jabari’s name on her screen.

Each message was a spark, and she was addicted to the burn.

When they crossed paths again at a dinner with friends, it was unbearable. Sitting across from him, David at her side, their eyes found each other over and over, lingering too long. A brush of his knee under the table made her breath catch. When David excused himself to take a call, Jabari leaned close enough that his lips almost grazed her ear.

“You’re mine, Nala,” he whispered. “Even here.”

Her heart hammered so loudly she thought the whole table could hear. She should have pulled away. Instead, she shivered with something that felt dangerously like joy.

Nights blurred into a secret rhythm. Rooftop bars. Stolen hours in a quiet hotel room. Even moments on her own balcony when David was on call at the hospital, the city glittering below as Jabari’s hands traced fire along her skin. She had never felt so alive.

Jabari was a storm, a drug, a danger she couldn’t put down. Every kiss was lightning, every touch a blaze that burned away her guilt until only hunger remained.

And yet, the double life weighed heavy. By day, she played the fiancée—dinners with David’s family, wedding talk with her parents. By night, she unraveled in Jabari’s arms, tasting freedom she had never allowed herself before.

Miriam noticed first.

One afternoon, they sat again at their usual café. Nala tried to sip her tea casually, but Miriam’s eyes narrowed.

“You’re glowing,” she said, blunt and amused.

“Glowing?” Nala laughed too quickly. “I’m just… happy.”

“Happy, my foot.” Miriam leaned forward, voice dropping. “There’s something different about you. You’re lighter. Sparkier. And don’t tell me it’s David—because I’ve seen the way you look at him, and it’s not this.”

Nala froze, her spoon clinking too hard against the cup. She forced a smile, shaking her head. “You’re imagining things.”

But Miriam’s grin told her she wasn’t buying it. “Mm-hm. Keep your secrets, Mwende. But one day, you’ll spill. And I’ll be here, waiting with popcorn.”

Nala laughed it off, but her chest ached. Miriam was right—she was different. She was lit from within by something reckless and wild. Something dangerous.

She just wasn’t ready to admit it.

Their meetings grew bolder. A rooftop bar one night, a quiet hotel suite the next. Nala had told herself she could resist, that she was strong enough to play with fire without being consumed. But Jabari was not a man who allowed half measures. Every time she swore it would be the last, she found herself answering his texts, her body betraying her mind.

One evening, as Nairobi’s skyline glittered beyond the floor-to-ceiling hotel window, she lay tangled in the sheets, breath unsteady. Jabari sat beside her, bare chest glistening in the half-light, a glass of whisky in his hand. For once, his smile was absent.

“I’ve never done this before,” he said, staring into the amber liquid.

Nala laughed softly, pulling the sheet tighter around her. “What? Slept with a woman? I find that hard to believe.”

His eyes flicked to hers, serious. “I’ve slept with women. Too many. I’ve broken hearts, walked away, never looked back. But this—” He reached out, brushing her jaw with his thumb. “This isn’t the same. You’re not the kind of woman a man forgets.”

Her chest tightened. She wanted to believe him, and yet fear clawed at her. “And what about David?” she whispered.

His hand lingered on her skin, eyes dark with conflict. “He’s my brother. I love him. Hurting him is the last thing I want. But, Nala…” His voice dropped, raw. “I can’t let you go. You’re it for me.”

Her pulse thundered, torn between guilt and exhilaration. In his arms, she felt both doomed and alive.

The next afternoon, she met Miriam for coffee. Nala had tried to hide the changes—looser hair, brighter clothes, the glow that clung to her—but Miriam saw straight through.

“Okay,” Miriam said, sipping her latte slowly, eyes narrowing. “Who is he?”

Nala froze, spoon hovering over her tea. “What are you talking about?”

Miriam smirked, unimpressed. “Don’t play dumb. You’ve been smiling at nothing. You’re walking lighter, like you’ve got a secret. Spill.”

Nala forced a laugh, shaking her head. “You’re imagining things. I’ve just been… less stressed, maybe.”

Miriam leaned across the table, her earrings swinging. “Nala Mwende, I’ve known you for years. I know your ‘focused’ face, your ‘bored stiff with David’ face, and this—” she pointed her spoon like an arrow—“this is new. This is I’ve-seen-someone-undress-me-with-his-eyes-and-I-liked-it.”

Heat rushed to Nala’s cheeks. She stirred her tea furiously, avoiding Miriam’s piercing gaze. “You’re ridiculous.”

“Mm-hm,” Miriam hummed, leaning back with a wicked grin. “Keep lying, my dear. But remember—secrets have a way of slipping out.”

Nala smiled tightly, but her chest throbbed with guilt. Miriam didn’t know the half of it.

The club was loud, pulsing with Afrobeats and flashing neon. Miriam had dragged Nala out for “girls’ night,” insisting she needed to loosen up. But halfway through the evening, Nala caught sight of him. Jabari, leaning against the bar, blazer discarded, shirt sleeves rolled, looking like temptation itself.

Her heart lurched. She hadn’t expected him here—but then again, Nairobi was a small city for secrets.

Miriam spotted her distraction instantly. “Don’t tell me you’re ogling some stranger,” she teased, swaying to the music. But nala didn’t hear her, her gaze focussed on Jabari. Miriam leaned in. “ I’m going to ladies, be back just now.”  Mirriam headed towards the toilets.

The next moment, Jabari was beside Nala. His hand brushed her back, steadying her as the crowd surged. His mouth dipped close to her ear, the bass vibrating through them both. “Dance with me.”

It wasn’t a request.

Nala hesitated for a heartbeat—then let herself be pulled into him. His hands were strong, anchoring her waist, guiding her as the rhythm overtook them. Every move was heat, every shift of his body against hers a promise of something deeper. She forgot Miriam, forgot the crowd, forgot everything except the man whose presence set her veins alight.

By the time they slipped outside for air, her pulse was a drumbeat in her throat. The city sprawled around them, alive with noise and light, but the balcony felt like its own universe. Jabari pressed her gently against the railing, his gaze fierce.

“Let’s get out of here,” his voice was low, rough, “ I need you”.

Her breath came shallow, chest tight. “I need you too”.

Her throat ached. For years, she had lived the life mapped out for her: dutiful daughter, loyal partner, the girl who always chose the right thing. But here, in the city’s heat and chaos, with Jabari’s hands framing her face, she felt like herself—raw, flawed, alive.

She kissed him, fiercely, desperately. And in that kiss was everything she feared and everything she craved.

David’s night shifts had become relentless. Three, sometimes four in a row, leaving him stumbling home just as dawn painted the sky, his body heavy with exhaustion. He would collapse into bed still half in his scrubs, pressing a tired kiss to her forehead before sinking into dreamless sleep. At first, Nala had pitied him, resented how much of their time the hospital stole. Now, it gave her room—room for nights spent elsewhere, in someone else’s arms, while David remained none the wiser.

When he did have time for her, it was in fragments. A rushed dinner. A movie half-watched before his head dropped against her shoulder in sleep. Sometimes, he reached for her in bed, the way he always had—tender, steady, dependable. But now Nala pulled away, citing exhaustion, early mornings, deadlines at the firm.

“Not tonight,” she whispered once, guilt tightening her chest.

David sighed, kissing her temple with weary affection. “We’re both tired. When this rotation ends, things will go back to normal.”

Normal. The word cut her. Because nothing about her life felt normal anymore.

Sunday dinner at the Otieno house was proof of the life she was supposed to want. The table was rich with ugali, sukuma, goat stew, laughter rising with the steam. David’s mother fussed over her, calling her “my daughter already,” while his father asked about her latest cases at the firm. David sat beside her, hand warm and steady on her knee, pride written in his every glance.

“You two must set a date soon,” his mother urged, beaming. “Five years, one year engaged—it’s time!”

Nala forced a smile, her fingers brushing the engagement ring on her hand. It glittered under the warm light, heavy as a chain. She nodded politely, her throat dry.

Later, walking home with David, he slipped his arm around her shoulders. “You looked beautiful tonight,” he said softly. “I can’t wait to see you as my wife.”

She smiled, but her stomach twisted. Because all the while, her phone buzzed in her purse. One word lighting the screen.

*Come.* – Jabari.

 And when David kissed her goodnight and headed back to work, Nala slipped back out into the night.

Jabari’s apartment was alive with music and low light. He opened the door shirtless, his body sculpted like temptation itself, a glass of whisky in his hand.

“You’re late,” he teased, pulling her inside.

“I couldn’t just walk out,” she whispered, still breathless from the rush of deceit.

But the moment his arms wrapped around her, every ounce of guilt dissolved. He kissed her like a man starved, like every second without her had been unbearable. And she kissed him back, desperate, reckless, alive.

The city blurred beyond the windows, but inside his apartment, everything sharpened: the heat of his mouth, the strength of his hands, the low sound in his throat when she clung to him like a lifeline. Every touch reminded her why she couldn’t stay away. He was danger, he was freedom, he was the fire she had been starving for.

Later, curled against his chest, Nala let herself laugh, really laugh. He teased her about her strict schedules, mimicked her lawyerly tone, made her forget the weight of her double life. For a few stolen hours, there was only them—heat, laughter, fire.

“You’re mine,” Jabari murmured into her hair. “No matter what the world thinks.”

She closed her eyes, because in that moment, she wanted nothing else to be true.

Miriam had been dodged long enough. For two weeks Nala had ignored her calls, made excuses for coffee dates, sent half-hearted texts. But when they finally met again at their usual café, Miriam’s expression was cool, her arms folded tight across her chest.

“You left me,” she said flatly, skipping any pretence of small talk. “That night. Girls’ night. I turned around and you were gone. Hours, Nala. Hours. And when I finally spotted you—” her voice sharpened, “—you were slipping out with him. With Jabari.”

Nala’s stomach dropped. She hadn’t meant for Miriam to see. She hadn’t meant to abandon her. But in the haze of music, lights, and Jabari’s hand on hers, she had forgotten everything else.

“Miriam, I—”

“No.” Miriam’s voice cut like glass. “Don’t. I’ve defended you for years when people called you too careful, too predictable. And honestly? I was glad you finally seemed… alive. But him?” She shook her head, disbelief clouding her features. “Of all the men in Nairobi, you pick Jabari Mwinyi?”

Her chest tightened. “You don’t understand.”

“Oh, I understand perfectly.” Miriam’s eyes blazed. “He’s David’s best friend. His brother. You think this is love, Nala? This is betrayal on both sides. And when David finds out—and he will—it’ll destroy him.”

Nala’s throat ached. She wanted to explain, to defend herself, but no words came. She saw the judgment in Miriam’s eyes, the disappointment that cut deeper than anger.

“You always said you wanted to do the right thing,” Miriam said softly, almost mournful now. “But this? This is the one thing you can’t make right.”

That night, in Jabari’s apartment, the city glowing through the windows, she broke.

“He knows,” she whispered, pacing, her arms wrapped tightly around herself. “Miriam knows. She saw us. And she hates me for it.”

Jabari watched her, leaning back in his chair, shirt unbuttoned at the collar. For once, there was no smirk on his lips.

“She’ll get over it,” he said, his voice steady.

“She won’t. And when David finds out—” Her voice cracked. “Jabari, he’s your brother.”

“I know who he is,” Jabari snapped, then softened instantly, standing to close the space between them. He cupped her face, forcing her to meet his gaze. “I’ve spent my whole life running through women, never settling, never even wanting to. And then you walked in, and suddenly I can’t breathe without you. You think I don’t hate myself for what this means for David? You think I don’t lie awake every night knowing I’m breaking the only brotherhood I’ve ever had?”

Her breath shuddered against his chest. “Then why—”

“Because I can’t let you go,” he said fiercely. “I’ve tried. God knows I’ve tried. But you—” he kissed her forehead, then her cheek, lingering near her lips—“you’re it, Nala. The one. And if I burn for it, so be it.”

Her hands trembled as they gripped his shirt. She hated him for saying it, hated herself for believing it. But when his mouth finally found hers, all that hate melted into heat, and she knew she was lost.

Miriam had been dodged long enough. For two weeks Nala had ignored her calls, made excuses for coffee dates, sent half-hearted texts. But when they finally met again at their usual café, Miriam’s expression was cool, her arms folded tight across her chest.

Miriam’s eyes were sharp, unwavering.

“I saw you, Nala,” she said, folding her arms across her chest. “At the club. You disappeared with him. Don’t insult me by pretending it was nothing.”

Nala’s mouth went dry. “You don’t know what you saw.”

“I know enough,” Miriam shot back. “I know there’s a man. And I know he’s the reason you’ve been glowing these past weeks, walking around like someone lit a match under your skin. So tell me—who is he?”

Nala hesitated. She could have lied, chosen another name, softened the truth. But the words slipped out before she could stop them.

“Jabari Mwinyi.”

Miriam’s face dropped. “*David’s* Jabari?”

Nala nodded, pulse pounding.

“Jesus, Nala.” Miriam leaned back, shaking her head. “You’re sleeping with David’s best friend? Do you even hear yourself? This isn’t just reckless—it’s cruel.”

“Miriam, you don’t understand—”

“Oh, I understand perfectly.” Miriam’s voice trembled between disbelief and fury. “I’ve heard the stories. Everyone has. Jabari and the trail of broken hearts he left behind before he ran off to London. Women who swore he was serious, only for him to vanish the second he got bored. And now you?”

Nala’s chest tightened. “He’s not like that with me.”

Miriam’s eyes softened, just slightly. “I believe you *think* that. But what if you’re wrong? What if he burns you too? You’re risking everything—your career, your engagement, your family’s pride—for a man who could leave you shattered. And worst of all—you’re betraying David with *him*. His brother in everything but blood.”

Nala’s eyes stung. “It’s not that simple.”

“Yes, it is,” Miriam snapped. Then her tone shifted, sad but firm. “If you want Jabari, fine. But have the decency to break things off with David first. Don’t make a fool of him. Don’t be that woman.”

That night, Jabari held her close in his apartment, the city lights casting shadows across his face. He kissed her, slow but intense, before pulling back.

“You’re trembling,” he murmured.

“Miriam knows,” Nala confessed, her voice breaking. “She saw us. And she thinks I’m a monster.”

His jaw tightened. “She doesn’t matter.”

“She does. She’s right. I’m engaged. To your best friend. You realize how impossible this is?”

Jabari’s gaze burned into her. “Nothing about us is impossible. I’ve had flings, Nala. Too many. I’ve walked away without looking back. But this?” He grabbed her hand, pressing it against his chest. “This is different. You’re the first woman who’s made me want to stay. Don’t ask me to step aside so he can keep dreaming of a future that doesn’t exist anymore. I can’t live in the shadows, not with you.”

Nala’s breath caught. Torn between the life she’d built and the fire she couldn’t resist, she clung to him, saying nothing. Because she wasn’t ready. Not yet.

Until that night, Nala had drawn one line. She had never allowed Jabari into the apartment she shared with David. Never into *their* bed. No matter how reckless she’d been in bars, in cars, in Jabari’s place across town, she had clung to that boundary. It was her last scrap of loyalty, the one lie she told herself to soften the guilt: *at least not here*.

But when Jabari showed up at her door just past midnight, his eyes burning, his voice low and hungry, she couldn’t send him away. David was on another brutal night shift at the hospital—forty-eight hours straight. She told herself no one would ever know.

And so she let him in.

The sex was frantic, a blur of heat and sheets, her body betraying every vow she’d ever made. After, she lay against him, the scent of him on her skin, the guilt pushed down so deep she almost forgot it existed.

Almost.

The sound of the key in the front door turned her blood to ice.

Jabari tensed. “No—” he whispered, already half-rising.

But it was too late. The bedroom door opened, and David stood there in the dim light. He had come home early, his scrubs still creased, exhaustion shadowing his face. But the look in his eyes cut through every ounce of fatigue—rage, grief, disbelief all fused together.

For a moment, none of them moved.

Then David’s voice, hoarse and raw:  
“So this is why you’ve been so tired.”

Nala scrambled upright, clutching the sheet to her chest, words choking in her throat. “David—”

“Don’t.” His hands shook as he stepped into the room. His eyes flicked between them, between the man he had called his brother and the woman he had wanted for his wife. “Not one word.”

Jabari’s jaw flexed, but he said nothing. His silence was admission enough.

David’s breath came hard and fast, his face pale with the weight of betrayal. “Five years, Nala. And you throw it all away—here? In our bed?”

Her tears blurred the edges of the room. “I—”

“You don’t even recognize what you’ve done,” he said, his voice breaking. He turned to Jabari, fury trembling in his frame. “My brother. You too.”

The silence stretched, unbearable, until David spun away. The door slammed behind him, the sound ricocheting through the apartment.

Nala sat frozen, the sheet clutched tight, her pulse roaring in her ears. For the first time, she understood there was no line left to cling to. The fire she had lit had consumed everything.

I’m doing some research on remote work for my dissertation and I’m really interested in the *rituals* people use to create boundaries or structure in their day.

For example - do you have a small routine that helps you “arrive” at work even though you’re at home? Maybe it’s making a specific coffee, taking a walk before logging on, lighting a candle, or even changing clothes.

I’d love to hear what helps you transition in and out of work mode, and whether you feel these little rituals affect your focus, mood, or overall work-life balance.

Two months ago we got assigned to the same project, and had loads of work together, we held all-day-long meetings where there were only the two of us. One month ago he started acting strangely with me, I would even say provocatively, he brought me coffee to my desk, asked me about my private life (more than before), organised unnecessary 1v1 meetings with me and regularly left work at the same time and walked me to the bus station.

Last week he confessed to me that he has been in love with me for over two months. He mentioned that it started with a crush, and he thought that he could suppress his feelings, but turned out he couldn’t and that’s when he started acting provocatively (I suppose he wanted to find out if I had the same feelings for him).

The problem is, that he’s been married to his wife for one year, and I have a fiancée for a few months now. As he said he realises that this is therefore four people’s concern, but he told that he would divorce his wife for me as well.
I feel very disappointed, and confused, because I feel like I have also developed minor feelings for him during this two months, I can’t really deny it. I told him I was not up to starting a relationship with him, that I love my fiancée (which is true), and that it is normal developing these feelings for someone else from time to time, the question is how one reacts to these feelings.

We agreed to keep distance, and that nothing will happen between us, but I keep finding myself thinking about him. I am so confused, I can’t leave this workplace for other reasons, how could I keep distance when we see each other at work frequently?

For example you need to start cleaning from 20:30-21:00 the soda machine, the ice cream machine, the coffee makers and then put towels down, then the ""pistols"" for the sauce then clean the kitchen utensils and trays that are being used less and less since everything has to be clean by closing time.

Most experience I have with is McDrive (3-4 days), I have been restocking all the fryers, fridges, getting items from the freezer room, preparing tomatoes, refilling the boxes used by kitchen, cleaning everything they throw at me and I also have to take orders from cars, isn't this too much? On the small sheet there need to be 23 people working and we are left with 4-5 people to handle every single thing from 21:30 to 01:00 and everything turns messy and rushed as I've said.
I will probably quit by the end of the month, the restaurant is huge 500-600m2 and it's simply too much work and multitasking you have to go through on top of the guiltness I feel when probably 10 people daily get sick or get stomach issues by the food I am giving them by hand.

Lobby people (cleaning - closing) clean the toilets (just the tissues, empty the small cans and clean the mirrors), clean the parking area (bins outside and big things on the parking area), broom the entire restaurant - just the big noticeable things (customer area inside) and clean the tables (60 ish), then clean as I said the coffee makers and the others machines and finally broom and mop the McCafè and the counters. They also of course clean the room for staff (where the cleaning stuff is and also where the tray carts are being emptied)

Kitchen - clean the table and their wall, the grill, assemble the things (that are given by the drive guy that cleans it), mop and broom their lane

Drive - clean the fryers, fry storing place, clean/refill the fridges, clean every singular utensil and box that they are thrown at and also parts of the grill, the sauce pistols, etc.
