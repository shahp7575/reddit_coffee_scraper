1lth4vh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lth4vh,I built a news aggregator because Apple News wasn't available in my country.,"Hey Reddit,

For the last three years, I've been working on a project close to my heart: a news aggregator app called [Newsreadeck](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/newsreadeck/id1593025917). I have a tradition of kickstarting my mornings with a cup of coffee in one hand and a variety of news sources in the other. Yet, I've noticed that most comparable apps cater primarily to an English-speaking, U.S.-based audience.

I first experimented with using RSS feeds, but soon found that many sites don't support them, and manually sorting or finding RSS feeds proved to be a cumbersome task. Even when I did find feeds, they either redirected to web pages or offered only partial views of articles instead of full content.

To overcome these hurdles, I designed my own data sources. I created a collection of over 16,000 carefully selected sources, classified by language, geographical location, and subject, which I carefully review for credibility. This app gives you the freedom to explore and follow as many sources as you like and provides seamless access to articles. I've also developed a specialized reader that strips away ads, banners, and other disruptions, although it can't yet bypass all paywalls.

If you're as enthusiastic about news as I am, [you're welcome to try out the app, available on the App Store.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/newsreadeck/id1593025917)

We’ve named it Greg. This is bc she doesn’t see him as a part of her just like an entity that’s always there making comments on her eating habits. 

She’s described it to me as she likes feeling “empty” bc that makes her feel light and clean. The only way to feel empty is to workout or not eat. And when she can’t work out she just doesn’t eat. But there are days that Greg is a bitch and says that working out isn’t enough so she has to workout and not eat to feel ok. 

Usually this doesn’t shut Greg up anyways so she still ends up feeling like shit and idk how to help. When she gets like this she describes it as feeling gross and helpless bc there’s nothing left for her to control essentially.

I’ve asked her to go to therapy but…. She says she likes Greg and that when she’s good and listens to him she feels light and ok. And she likes feeling like that. 

She doesn’t see a problem bc another way she describes this.. thing… is that she just likes experimenting on herself and she likes to know certain goals that she sets for herself and her body are achievable. I don’t like when she says this bc it sounds so… not ok and not healthy. 

I started writing this post a couple hours ago bc I knew she was having a really hard day, but in the couple hours she’s sent me a message saying that maybe she doesn’t want Greg anymore. Idk how to go about this bc I feel like if I push too hard she’ll close back up. 

She said that she doesn’t wanna eat today or tomorrow. I’ve made rules for days like this that even if it’s just a protein shake she has to have something every “meal time” of the day. (Idk if this is ok to do but I’ve never been w someone who has a ed.. she also prefers drinks to food like coffee and energy drinks will substitute actual food..)

I’ve been stressing/obsessing and would really like to resolve whatever this is. I can barely smile these days feeling like my gums are so messed up.

What is this redness? Why does it look like there is a v-shaped line or outline in my gums between and over my central incisors? Is that normal? 

The reddish swollen area randomly appeared over my right central incisor at the end of March. No bleeding or pain, but the gums felt “tight” in that area. Today, the swelling had lessened but there is also a smaller red spot above my left central incisor. My gums don't bleed in any area, even with flossing or brushing.

Dental history: I had braces removed two years ago + gum contouring to even out the gumline (performed by my ortho). Could this be related to that, even so long after and with careful hygiene?

1ltgue7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Halloweenmovies/comments/1ltgue7/i_know_its_done_to_death_but_i_have_an_idea_i/,"I know it's done to death, but I have an idea I think would have saved Halloween Ends and have to film very little extra.","I thought of this in another thread, but if they were going for the transfer of evil thing at all, they should have done a reference to 1978. A little boy runs into Michael dressed as a clown. Michael stops/grabs him like he does in 78 and lets him go. 

But this scene wouldn't be a reference. This scene would be the scene where Michael looks into Corky's eyes and sees he's evil so he lets him go. This goes far beyond that. I don't think Michael would even conscience of the fact that he's The Shape. But when he touches the little boy (sounds really bad out of context) it's almost like an epiphany. Michael knows his time is very near its end because The Shape isn't being satisfied like it used to due to Michaels advanced age (so they can leave in the sewer part). It would be hard to convey the whole ""The Shape is a force of nature that is somehow intertwined with the most evil people imaginable, and it happens during childhood"" so you just don't have to explain it and do what Halloween does best and leave it to interpretation. 

Anyway so Michael still goes to kill Laurie. Only this time it isn't wrong place wrong time. Michael isn't an avenger. He kills indiscriminately. But realizing that he's not long for the world he has his final showdown with Laurie, who of course should win. She kills Michael in some indisputable way (what they did with the metal crushing thing was perfect). 

I forgot to add in Halloween Ends: The Much Better Edition Laurie doesn't go from being so paranoid about Michael that she had PTSD for life that she passed onto her child and eventually lost custody doing it, only to be grandma gardening a year after her daughter was murdered by Michael Myers who's still at large for fucks sake lol. In this version she's Halloween 18 Laurie on crack. Like Michael, killing has become the only thing she cares about. It's just that she only wants to kill Michael. 

So Laurie is still traumatized by the death of her daughter when this movie starts. 

So a few weeks (maybe a year...probably a year) she's gardening grandma now. She opens her front door in a regular house that isn't a trap for Michael and looks out into the peaceful neighborhood, the leaves falling from the trees. She sighs a sigh of relief (maybe show her look at a picture of her daughter to imply she's found a way to move on despite her grief). Then she looks down and notices the news paper. On the front page ""7 year old child murders teenage sister in cold blood."" They show a little boy dressed like a clown giving a thousand yard stare through two police officers. Suddenly Laurie goes pale and dread overcomes her completely. She continues staring at the picture of this young boy when the reality dawns on her. (Also the kid should look totally different. Maybe a completely different race to emphasize that evil has neither a face nor a color.)

Then the movie ends one of 2 ways. 

After the realization Laurie drops her coffee mug. When it hits the ground the Halloween theme starts playing and Laurie is just staring in horror out into the world realizing that evil never dies (except when it dies tonight of course. Say it with me 137 thousand times). Credits. 

Or, and I'd prefer this less than the first one but I can see these options being polarizing. I think the other best possible ending is after Laurie regains the color back in her face she walks back into her house. She's walking differently now. Confidently. Like someone who feels like they're in complete control. She takes out a shotgun from some hiding place (something like a hiding place built into a piece of furniture or behind a piece of art, as if she always had a backup plan)  Laurie grabs the gun and cocks it. No fear in her eyes. Credits. 

In all situations Michaels supernatural ability and/or The Shape are never acknowledged or mentioned so we can continue to have conversations about Michaels humanity or lack there of, because that's part of the fun. At least for me. Even Rob Zombie gave us an unanswered questions; what WAS Michael's intentions with Laurie? Reuniting of finishing the job? Or now that I'm saying it I'm realizing it began as a reunion and ended in revenge. So maybe he didn't get anything about the character right. But it was still Michael Myers in a cool mask, plus he was literally a terrifying giant. Not saying it holds a candle to 78, 2, or 18, but I like it. You're allowed to like both. It's actually what got me interested in Michael Myers. I had seen H20 and Resurrection prior. It was Rob Zombie that made me eventually watch 78 and getting to witness a perfect movie, not even slasher and horror. Just period. Oh and since I'm outing myself as ""not a real fan' because I didn't lie and say I saw 78 first, I'm also going to say that when H20 ended, I thought the entire franchise was supposed to end and I thought that ending was amazing. But again this is all pre me watching 78 and seeing Michael Myers as he was meant to be seen. But on that note I now genuinely believe there never should have been a second Halloween movie at all. But that's neither here nor there.

1ltgszy,https://i.redd.it/mcn03txukcbf1.png,This app is actively ruining my sleep (and suggestions for changes to cooking),"Okay so first off, I'm a F2P min-maxer. I like being able to do the most with the least, so I know I'm already kind of a minority player demographic but I do think the situation in the picture must be something a lot of other folks face.

Scenario: It's midnight, I'm dying to go to bed (especially jetlagged after a flight to the other side of the world) and I want to make this damn meal so I can pass out. Of course, I'm one ingredient off, have no ingredient tickets left and my Quags and Gengar are staring at me like @__@ what do you want us to do?

So what happened? I'm staring at my bright ass screen at midnight, waiting for a little magnifying glass to pop up so I can tap and hopefully get ONE MUSHROOM to finish my meal so I can sleep.

I ended up passing out anyway, and waking up at 2am to see my screen still on (and hot as hell) and then at that point, I make my meal. I forget to change to a suitable team for overnight sleep, which ruins my next day, and my sleep is totally f*cked to boot.

This exact thing happened to me two times this week (and has happened countless times in the previous months), and it really sucks the fun out of this game for me. Sure there are plenty of ways for me to ensure it doesn't happen like overstocking the week before but I already open the app like 30x a day and switch teams constantly to get ingredients and I don't think I should (or can) do anymore for my own sanity/social life.

I think cooking needs to be reworked. A simple QOL of change that I believe I've seen other people mention would be to able to set an auto cook on a recipe once the required ingredients are gathered. If that's too OP of a function in devs' estimation, then either set it as only available for dinner (since I'm trying to get to damn sleep) or have it so you can only cook the base recipe and the fillers are randomly determined or something. 

tl;dr I want to do my best in this game but frequently having to stay up past my desired bed time to cook because of RNG ingredient gathering is actively ruining my sleep and enjoyment in this game. ",2,1751849020.0,PokemonSleep,4,0.75,False

Graduated last year with a masters in env studies and sustainability from a pretty reputed college. I naively thought it would be relatively easy to land a job, so I took it easy for the first month, settling into post-grad life. Boy, was I wrong. I applied to countless job postings through LinkedIn, Indeed - you name it. Didn’t really have too many contacts for referrals like most of my American friends because I’m basically international (did my schooling/undergrad abroad and all my family/contacts are abroad). I somehow managed to get a fellowship with a consulting company which kept me busy from September to December but was back to square one once that ended. Barely got any interviews after submitting more than a 1000 applications. The change in administration also signalled trouble for people in my field which was super discouraging. Managed to set up a few coffee chats with people in the industry but always thought it was weird because it would feel like I was begging them for something they were in no position to give me. Slowly saw that all my friends were somehow finding jobs which was even more discouraging. Obviously was super happy for them but there was always that voice in the back of my head screaming “Why not me?”. Got a few interviews but always put so much pressure on myself given that interviews were so hard to come by + general anxiety overall which always led to me messing them up one way or the other. Got into a pretty dark space mentally around April and was just ready to pack up and go back home to my family and look for jobs there. I’m very lucky to have a supportive family who were more than happy to have me back but I always thought leaving was a sign of giving up - which I realise now is not true. 

Then in May, I started to get more calls for interviews. At this point I was so checked out and mentally prepared to be going back home that I feel like I didn’t put as much pressure on myself. I just did my best to prepare for the interviews, and then left the rest to the universe. I started getting more comfortable in interviews - speaking to interviewers like people, not putting them on pedestals, and letting go of that weird inferiority complex. Got to interview for a dream company I had applied to for over 15 roles and met with the hiring manager and team - and for the first time I just felt like I belonged. Less than a week after meeting them, I had an offer. 

I started in June and it has been a pleasant experience so far. I didn’t have to move out of the city I have been in since I arrived in the US which is huge for me, I’m getting paid decently, working for a company that is probably the best one to work at in my field, and I feel like I’ve learnt so much already. While it took me a lottt longer than I would’ve liked, I feel like it happened for a reason. It definitely seemed like I was just throwing applications into the void and was really hard to stay motivated to do it every day but there is light at the end of the tunnel. If I could do it, you can too. ",1,1751848961.0,recruitinghell,2,0.67,False
1ltgrny,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ltgrny/how_could_i_30f_give_nonhappy_feedback_to_an/,How could I (30F) give non-happy feedback to an acquaintance (30F)?,"I (30s, F) am hoping to hear from anyone who has been in a similar situation, as the recipient or giver of critique in a social setting. I’ve been a member of a book club for 12-15 (late 20s to mid 40s) women for about a year. Probably only 6-10 make it to a monthly meeting, but it’s been a lot of fun, we’ve read and discussed books that I never would have read otherwise, and I enjoy the diversity in opinion and experience that leads to fun conversations.

This is question is about one of the participants, who is otherwise a nice woman (30s, F). She has multiple young children, her partner travels for work, and she’s mentioned that this book club is one of her main social outlets. She comes to almost every meeting and always reads the book – but she also tends to dominate discussions. After 1 or 2 glasses of wine, she’ll use around 30-40% of the oxygen, rerouting topics to her personal stories, ignoring questions in favor of what she wants to talk about, and going on long tangents. She doesn’t talk over people, so if someone else re-routes she respects that, but then within a few minutes she’ll take back over. I really don’t think there’s anything malicious here, truly, I think she’s just really happy to get to talk to people who aren’t toddlers, but it creates noticeable tension and hasn’t improved organically over the past 4-5 months. Multiple people have griped about it to me.

The problem is, she’s not close friends with anyone in the group, and the person who invited her has other social ties in the community that make her unwilling to say anything for fear of social awkwardness. I don’t think it’s fair or kind that all this frustration/resentment is building about her, that she doesn’t have a clue, and that she hasn’t been given a heads-up to tone it down a bit. My bias is that I work in a field where I give a lot of critical feedback everyday, so I’m probably too cavalier in my impulse to tell her directly. I personally would find a text message about something like this to be incredibly unexpected and unkind, but I don’t know her well enough to just call her up. I don’t want her to feel run off (again, she reads all the books! She seems really nice! I don’t want her to leave!) but she’ll eventually notice that people don’t tend to include her and that seems cruel as well.

So, Reddit – if you were in a group and were receiving some kind but critical feedback about your participation – how would you want to receive that? Do I invite her for a walk or coffee? I have a close friend in the club who has also heard multiple complaints about the same situation – would a group of three feel like a gang attack or be less off-putting than an unexpected 1 on 1 invite?  Am I subconsciously blurring the lines between my work obligation to give “employees” a fair chance to improve with the social obligation to mind my own beeswax?",2,1751848909.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

I'm a student from Morocco, passionate about building things, and I have an app idea I'd love to get your thoughts on. It's called **'9hiwa'** , and the core concept is to help **Moroccan men connect one-to-one or in small groups over coffee** for focused discussions on skills, ideas, and potential collaborations.

I want to be clear: I'm focusing on **men specifically to ensure the app remains purely professional and avoids any confusion with dating apps like Tinder.** This is about fostering genuine, skill-based networking in a casual, in-person setting.

Think of it as a platform for 'building in public' in real life. If you're into things like **e-commerce, web development, SEO, freelancing, startups, or just want to brainstorm a new idea** with someone who has complementary skills (e.g., finding an automation expert for your e-com business), this could be for you. My aim is to create a space purely for genuine connection and knowledge sharing, not for making money from the meetups themselves.

I'm especially keen to hear from those of you who work on projects or businesses and sometimes wish you had a local, informal way to connect with others on specific topics.

My bf and I were planning to get engaged next week while overseas on vacation. I was beyond ecstatic, and have been waiting for so long for him to ask. I couldn't wait to be his wife, but all that's gone now and I can't understand it. Backstory: I used to live in a very small, peaceful, quiet town, where everyone kind of knew everyone. The total population is about 6k people. The local coffee shop always had the same regulars, the bar tenders knew all the local faces, the local Dunk's employees knew everyone's usual order, you get the idea. I only left that town to move back home after a break up. Now I live in my hometown and this is where I met my current bf. We have had some ups and downs, like everyone couple, but in general, we are very happy together. While living in my old town, I met an older gentleman who's a friend of a friend. We only met on 2 brief occassions, and only ever exchanged pleasantries. There's never been even a hint of romantic interest between us. But the thing about him, is that he loves to make other people smile and spread happiness, so he semi-frequently sends mass messages out to all of his friends list (GIFs, memes, cute animal pics, etc., but never anything inappropriate). While my bf and I were looking at something on my phone, a FB message came through from that friend. I was annoyed at the timing, as we were busy, and I was not interested in looking at the message, so I swiped it off my screen, which, in hindshight, may have been a mistake. My bf was immediately suspicious and asked to see it. Fair enough, so I gave him my phone immediately and we looked at the message together. As always, nothing inappropriate, just a quick reel that was kind of funny. But my bf lost it, asking why I was receiving messages from another man. I tried to explain, but he was having none of it. He accused me of having a secret relationship behind his back, made wild claims that I must be having late night phone calls with this man, and ""probably suck his D"" behind my bf's back. I was shocked, confused, and very hurt. The message was completely innocent in nature, but my bf insists that it's inappropriate to allow other men to DM me, regardless of content. I disagree, and don't see anything wrong with people of opposite sexes being friends or friendly with one another. He says that allowing other men access to my social media and/or DMs is ""keeping the door open for them"" and keeping them ""on deck"" while I wait for my chance to leave my current relationship for one of them.

1ltglkd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pratt/comments/1ltglkd/pratt_freshmen_lowdown/,Pratt Freshmen Lowdown,"Making this post to hopefully help some curious incoming freshmen out! I covered everything I could think of, but if there’s any more questions I’m happy to help. 

CLASSES
you’ll have 5 mandatory classes for each semester, and they’re split into year long or semester long. studio classes are 4 hour long classes where you do fine art. they’re very dependent on the professor you get. generally you’ll do some in class work and then get assigned a bigger homework/take home assignment, which you will critique the next class (crits usually an hour long). first semester is about building your technical skills through exercises and practice and second semester is about taking those technical skills and applying them with conceptual skills. lecture classes are 3 hours long and encompass most GenEds. 

- visualization representation (drawing class) (YR LONG) (studio)
- light color design (shapes and colors class) (YR LONG) (studio)
- art history (YR LONG) (lecture)
- lit crit (semester long but i think they’re making it year long next year) (lecture)
- space form process (sculpture class) (studio) OR time and movement (video art class) (SEM LONG) (studio)

depending on your major your experience may vary. most majors take all these classes, but there are exceptions. fashion, for example, only takes a semester of LCD and has a fashion class. architecture has their own entire foundation year. 

your classes will be mostly the same people. pratt currently runs foundation with a cohort system, where there’s one bigger cohort (let’s say it has 20 people) and of that large cohort, it’s split up into 2 smaller cohorts of 10 people, we’ll call it cohort a and cohort b. cohort a takes all art classes with cohort a, and cohort b takes all art classes with cohort b. for lecture classes, HALF of cohort a mixes with half of cohort b, making cohort AB and BA. cohort AB takes all their lecture classes together as does cohort BA. all these people in your cohort will also live in your residence building and be a variety of majors. all this to say you’re going to be taking classes and live with essentially the same small group of people all year (with a few exceptions). 

foundation year is kind of controversial. some people love it, some people hate it. depending on the skillset you come in with, you’ll have a vastly different experience. those who come in with a stronger fine arts background, especially with painting or charcoal, might feel like they’re doing child’s work. those who come in with none at all might feel very behind and question why they have to do fine arts at all considering their major. remember, most majors take the same classes. the painting students will still be taking drawing with the photography students. the sculpture students are still going to be taking space form process with the illustration students. IMHO it makes for an interesting mix. foundation isn’t unique to pratt, most art schools have you do it. it’s pratt’s way of making sure everyone’s skills are at base level needed for future classes, and gives people time to try a bunch of different mediums and make sure that their major is the right choice for them. if you choose to switch majors during foundation year, it’s very easy. i personally think foundation is what you make of it. the professors can be pretty lax (at least first semester), so it’s up to you to up the rigor if that’s what you want. try to make work you personally want to make. foundation year can be very valuable if you tailor it for yourself. coming in with an already strong fine arts skill set, the biggest thing i personally learned was how to self motivate + how to make the same quality of work but at a much faster pace. enjoy yourself!

DINING HALL
you’re going to be on a required meal plan. you’re probably never going to use all the swipes each week unless you eat three meals a day every single day. make sure you use your points regularly. they roll over to the next semester, so if you don’t use all of them in fall it’s fine, but you’ll have an easier time finishing by using them regularly.  points can be used at the coffee shops (!!), in the dining hall, and at willoughby market place (!!) where you can spend them on things like ice cream tubs, frozen food, breakfast foods, snacks, tide pods, etc. 

the dining hall food isn’t that bad honestly it used to be a lot worse. but it can get boring when it’s what you eat all day every day. if you’re trying to make friends id encourage going and EATING THERE regularly even if you’re eating alone. it’s half of how you build up friendships, just seeing people regularly to have familiarity. 

DORMS
last year the freshmen were all put into triples, even though the rooms were meant to be doubles. no clue what’s happening this year. good luck. you have three housing options, Pantas, Stabile, and Emerson. short summaries below:

Pantas
- suite style with private bathrooms (one per 6 people, three in each room)
- closest to campus “center” (1min walk from dining hall and most academic buildings)
- one kitchen in the first floor lounge equipped with a stove and sink
- each floor has a small lounge (but it’s basically just an elevator space with a bench)
- laundry room and one studio space in the basement
- kinda old

Stabile
- suite style with private bathrooms (one per 6 people, three in each room)
- a couple of rooms in the building are Meant for triples, but there’s a low number of them so it’s a low chance you get the large room
- bigger than pantas IMO
- a bit further from campus center. 2-3 minute walk to dining hall, and varying lengths for the other academic buildings. close to the exit to myrtle ave, a strip of restaurants/grocers/other stuff
- each floor has a couple work rooms/studios and a small kitchen
- laundry room in basement
- known for its prison aesthetic although some really like it

Emerson
- suite style with communal bathrooms
- newest dorm
- off campus, just down the street from stabile’s entrance. about a 5-7 minute walk from dining hall and the rest of the buildings
- closest to myrtle ave
- laundry room in basement
- each floor has a nice and large lounge area and kitchen
- the most modern with the nicest facilities IMO, but being off campus + communal bathrooms can be a deal breaker for many

id honestly say all the dorms are good and have their pros and cons. i wouldn’t say there’s any clearly “best” or “worst” dorm it’s genuinely up to personal preference for most. i like pantas because it’s in the middle of campus and im lazy. 

dorms all come with some drawers, closets, beds, desks, mini fridge, and microwave. there’s only one small trashcan so id get your own BIGGER one. no tiny desk trashcan you’ll be taking that out every day. britas are good if you don’t want to go down to the lobby to refill your water bottle all the time. bathroom space is limited get a shower caddy. command hooks are your best friend. if you want to keep the space clean swiffer regularly and get a rug. living in a dorm with others can be daunting, but if you get along, it’ll be so chill. set up cleaning agreements (and i mean real cleaning agreements like a schedule with consequences) at the beginning of the year. you do NOT know your roommates habits so it’s better to get this stuff on paper or on phone. chores are a lot easier when split between 4-6 people rather than on 1-2. this is how you’re going to avoid tension. be friendly with each other and try to always assume the best. the dorms feel a lot bigger when you don’t hate each other. living with people is hard.

STUDENT LIFE
go outside and do things!! i guarantee you no matter how many friends you have you’re going to feel lonely and isolated and the whole FOMO cocktail in first semester. this is entirely normal. you do not need a friend group only a couple months in and nothing is wrong with you if you don’t have one. everybody is going through this at the same time!! that being said, put yourself out there, because if you don’t, you’ll never get over it. none of these people know who you are, you can be and act however you want to. try new things out! especially at the beginning of the year, everyone’s just trying to find some connections. go to club fairs, try out clubs (even if you only go to one meeting), when people invite you to things go for it. do the orientation weeks events, even the non-mandatory ones. talk to your classmates and make a cohort group chat for homework. invite people to explore the city with you!! you will find your place, just explore before you get comfortable. and try to be friends with your roommate, really. 

pratt doesn’t have a huge party culture, but people definitely go out. since it’s NYC it’s mostly to clubs or out of campus parties people hear about. people do throw dorm parties, but that’s usually more on a friendgroup basis. if partying is your vibe, go for it and bring a buddy, if it’s not, you can easily avoid it all.

1ltgiv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ltgiv5/trying_to_understand_targeting_logic_would/,"Trying to understand targeting logic, would appreciate any perspectives","I’ll start by saying I’m not well versed in all the legal or military details of the Israel-Gaza conflict but I’m trying to learn more. Please understand I’m not here to take sides or be convinced, I’m asking for factual, grounded explanations specifically about Israel’s approach. I’ve been following the conflict and trying to better understand how Israel justifies certain targeting decisions, especially when it comes to defining legitimate targets and distinguishing between civilians and combatants.

For example, I’ve noticed Israeli officials sometimes justify strikes on individuals or locations in Gaza based on claims of prior militant affiliations, family connections to Hamas or older intelligence suggesting someone was involved in militant activity even if it’s unclear whether the person is still active. Sometimes those details are only made public after the strike. At the same time, Israeli society is heavily conscripted with most adults having served in the military, many as reservists and many civilians having close family members serving.

Here’s where I’m confused:

If Israel argues that indirect ties like family connections or past militant activity can make someone or somewhere a legitimate target, couldn’t that same logic theoretically be applied in reverse? For example, Palestinian groups (even though I know Hamas fires rockets blindly, which is heavily criticized internationally) could claim that Israeli civilians are valid targets because they are former soldiers, reservists, or connected to the military through family.

To be clear:

I’m not justifying any side’s actions, especially not indiscriminate attacks. I’m trying to understand:

* How does Israel track who is currently active in groups like Hamas and who isn’t? Or do they tend to target anyone ever affiliated with Hamas?
* Is there an accepted threshold for when family ties or past involvement justify a strike?
* From an Israeli perspective, where is the line between justified targeting and unacceptable harm to civilians?

This is very fascinating from the International law perspective:

Apparently, you can only legally target someone while they’re actively fighting not just because they used to fight, know someone who fights or look like they might fight someday. So technically, a Hamas member chilling at home is considered a civilian, just like an Israeli reservist grabbing coffee off duty is a civilian. I find that interesting because even if Israel is killing known Hamas members based on old intel, isn’t that breaching international law if they’re not actively involved at that very moment?",3,1751848160.0,IsraelPalestine,5,1.0,False

So I have this very very close friend at work. He's straight, with fiance and a kid. And a top leader in our company, in a global level (we are a huge US congolomerate). Im his junior and an openly bi guy. We were very tight, he was my mentor and protector.

Anyway he went on a worktrip abroad in EU and asked me to follow so it was a vacay for me. He wanted me to try cannabis (it's legal where we were). It was my first time but he had this many times before

We got high. We were talking. He led the convo to something sexual. I didnt mind because we were open. Also even before, he was very jokingly touchy but I brushed it off as straight guy roug humor, though I tell him to stop. But to be very clear, I have never shown any indication of attraction because I know how the it looka when it is the queer guy giving compliments. And I dont feel that way. 

So anyway the stuff he was saying included apologizing to me for his touching and all and how we are friends. I was saying yeah yeah no worries. Then he was asking me to lay beside him. I said no many times. This went on for like 4 times, until I finally said ""just lie in my bed"" thinking he would stop and maybe he would just protect me from doing anything stupid because I was really high.

Then when he did. He cuddled me. He asked me to cuddle but said 'no' many times or pretended I didnt hear him. But when he changed his tone, I did it because Im now worried how saying no or rejecting him will affect our relationship (friendship and career). I wasnt worried he'd physically hurt me tho even though he was this big buff guy and Im so much slimmer but it did cross my ""what if"".

Im not gonna go on more details but he made me do sex stuff. He was the one in charge, telling me what to do and he seems more sober than me because he had the foresight on what will happen (like he told me where to do it so his fiance wont see). In between, he was saying ""should we be doing this"" or ""hey we're still cool right"" and I was placating him like ""yeah sure"" but honestly I just wanted it to be over. When he was done he showered and said ""how are we gonna be tomorrow?"" then left me on my bed. 

Come morning we were very alloof and awkward and we spent the next four days avoiding each other, though talking a bit. We got to spend time a little on our last day, but obviously still distanced. On the last day he was joking again and flexing his muscles and all so I thought this is my chance to ask, but he got high again. We didnt talk much until our flight back. This was tough for me fearing that things changed but I was giving him time since it must be confusing for him and he must be ashamed.

On Monday, he went to the office and sat on his desk (next to mine) but I transferred seats because he made me anxious. He joined me and our friends in the pantry so I left because it causes me anxiety to see him be present but not talk to me. Then I felt guilty for building that wall so I asked him for coffee and he said no.

The next few days he transferred to another site so we didnt see each other. On Friday (9 days after what happened) nagmessage but he just told me ""Nothing to talk about. Give me time. This is your problem. But keep quiet."" It triggered me so much. Like how he dismissed me and thought only of himself when he involved me in this mess. I was so hurt so I sent a long message saying I just wanna get a the reassurance that we are still friends and also I have so many questions. And how his ignoring made feel used that I literally stopped eating. That I can look past the sex and forgive ut but its the treatment of me that really makse me feel Im not safe anymore or un work ko safe ba. Kasi parang di na sya un taong kilala ko that I trusted.

That was my last message and Im just waiting him to talk to me. He occassionally messages me in groupchats acting like nothing happened. He goes around all cheery like everything is just the same. And it triggers me talaga.

 Im spiraling down from the pain and confusion and guilt and paranoia and anger. And shame. So it messes with my mind.

At first I just wanna fix the friendship and clear the air and make sure our work wont be affected and that he wont do it again since he has a fiance. Tbh I also care about him. Baka may sarili syang trauma and he needs psychological help. Baka he is in a state of shock nagawa nya un kaya di nya ko makausap. Malalim din kasi pinagsamahan namin.

Sometimes I blame myself. Like should I have talked to him right away? Should I gave him more time before asking to talk? Should I just pretended to be asleep or walked out (though I couldnt stand because I was high). I also couldnt tell anyone at work because we are in the same circle and Im worried he would paint me the liar. A gay guy vs a straight family man doesnt seem like an undersog story many would root for. Tho everyone who knows me knows Im not promiscuous and I have a partner. 

But now, since I lost trust on him, Im reflecting if I should report it to HR. But he's an influential global leader so Im considering lawyering up because with the power dynamic and all some say it is assault. But tbh I dont wanna go through this. This is so unimaginably stressful for me. I have seen 3 therapists almost everyday. I dont want to drag this. The last two weeks were emotional hell, I cant imagine doing this more. And I wanna believe still that this guy is still the good guy I lookes up to and probably just made a lapse in judgement.

All I want is for him to acknowledge what happened so I know he is still that person that I knew. He had been so kind to me and I am still shocked how this went. But right now I dont know who he is and what he is thinking so Im torned between giving hin the benefit of the doubt and moving on while being open if he reaches out to me, OR just report this and be ready for a long draining battle and accept the bridge has burned. So andun un struggle ko. 

Right now, I just want to cope with the pain and function like normal again so I can lead my projects properly. Tbh the sexual stuff, I can forgive that and look past that, if he would just give me a sincere apology and explanation and a promise me Im safe despite knowing his secret. But even if he does that, will I be okay?

So un un choices ko. Ayaw ko gawin criminal case because I dont have the emotional and mental capacity for that. I might raise this to HR but Im worried it might backfire to me becaise of his position and also because naka palabasin nya lang na type ko sya. So I dunno.",0,1751848046.0,LawPH,2,0.5,False
1ltggqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/1ltggqz/on_the_path_to_finalizing_divorce_from_a_covert/,On the Path to Finalizing Divorce from a Covert Narcissist,"I am a 36m and my STBXW is 34. We have been together for 10 years and married just shy of 5 years. She underwent MAJOR weight loss via Zepbound, lots of red flags occured, and she filed for divorce.

She never had an official diagnosis for Covert Narcissism but she has ALL the traits. Let's start from the beginning.

1. She had a rough childhood. Her mother divorced my STBXW's father and she witnessed a terrible divorce. The man was left with nothing. Since then (this was over 20 years ago), she bounced around from man to man to man. My STBXW witnessed this her entire life. During that time, she suffered emotional abuse from her mother... ""get on the treadmill you are fat!"". She admitted that years ago she was sexually assaulted by one of her mother's lovers. When she confronted her mother on this she basically said ""no, you are lying, and you probably led him on anyway"".

2. She suffered from body image issues and low self-esteem her entire life. She was never IMO that big when I was with her. But before I was with her she was quite big.

3. She has VERY limited friends. Really no hobbies. I didn't mind during our relationship because I loved her. I have many friends but she never really wanted to associate. ALL of my friends now admit she was very standoffish and unwelcoming.

4. She hasn't talked to her mother in years. She is off/on with her brother. She will cut him off and has several times for various reasons and then will re-kindle that relationship.

5. She has always had problems with co-workers

6. She dropped dramatic weight in the span of about 2 months on Zepbound. She is also on anti-depressants. 

7. The weird comments and redflags started to emerge during this weight loss such as: ""a man said I was beautiful today at starbucks and he bought me coffee"". ""I have fantasies of you watching me have sex with another man"". ""My male co-worker says he masturbates to the thought of me"". ""you are in the military, when you deploy you should get a hall pass and have sex with whomever you want"". Now, the sex with us was actually good during this period. The final straw was while I was away on a trip, she deleted Ring/Blink footage of her coming and going late at night. When I got home and confronted her on this, she said she has been unhappy for a long time and is filing for divorce.

Ever since her filing it is like she is a completely different person. No emotion. She gaslights me on everything and has flipped the script with every scenario. She has become NASTY with crazy comments. We agreed to not have children years ago and I got a vasectomy. She admitted that ""with the right man I would consider having kids"". That hurt. She admitted that ""marriage is a piece of paper"". She says I am the reason for this and she admits no fault at all. We are co-living in this house and she dresses up almost every night to go out. My co-worker found she has a Bumble. She originally said ""lets be amicable through this"". Well, based on her crazy requests I had no choice but to hire a lawyer.

I went NC. Shortly after, she asked for a hug. I said no. 

I truly think she is a Covert Narcissist and the mask came off with the extreme weight loss. 

She is turning into her mother.... the women she DESPISED my entire 10 years with her. I remember her saying how disgusting it is that her mom can't be comfortable with herself and needs to bounce from man to man. My wife is now that woman! It hurts so much to be discarded like this so abruptly.",2,1751847985.0,LifeAfterNarcissism,1,0.75,False

1ltgfd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1ltgfd6/the_golden_zippo/,The Golden Zippo,"I've always been a fighter. I was born too early and had to fight just to survive. Then life said that was an easy fight. My mother gave birth to twins two years later. On my tenth birthday, I had to fight my uncle for stealing our rent money. At thirteen, my mother had a mental breakdown, and now I'm a child raising two preteens and taking care of an adult.

I never had what people call a childhood. No, my upbringing was more aligned with a battleground. When we didn’t have much food in the fridge or cabinets, I’d go out and steal what we needed. My mom knew, and yet she didn’t care.

“So long as the kids have food,” she would say with chip crumbs on her chest.

To say I hate my mother would be an understatement. There was a defining moment in high school. I got caught stealing a lighter with a Grim Reaper printed on it. I started stealing out of boredom more than survival. Around the same time, my mother’s mental health was declining faster every day. When my mom arrived at the police station, I knew it from what the uniforms were saying:
“Nah man, cowboy hat, cowboy boots, and goddamned Daisy Dukes.”

When the uniforms left, I just tilted my head back and sighed. Not from frustration or relief. No, it was still from boredom. That’s when I met him for the first time.

In the corner of the small room stood a man that wasn’t there before. He had a grin on his face like he was watching a movie for the seventh time and his favorite scene was about to come on. He was opening and closing a golden zippo lighter. When he finally snapped it shut one last time, I saw a stylized, scripted letter “D” on it.

“You look bored,” said the Zippo man.

I just stared at him. I could feel my face settling into cold indifference — the face I would wear whenever I thought I was looking at someone with authority.

His grin turned into a smirk when I didn’t reply. The next two words he whispered gave me nightmares. His eyes flashed golden and his lips barely moved when he said,
“Watch this.”

He snapped his fingers and vanished. Then my mom walked through the door and told me the police were using witchcraft and we needed to leave. Her delusions had now evolved to include witchcraft. I just shook my head and walked out with her.

When the cops returned the stuff from my pockets, they also gave me a golden Zippo I didn’t have before. When I tried giving it back, the cop insisted I keep it.

That was 20 years ago. My mom’s long gone. My siblings live out of state. As for me, I’m finally settling some old scores in a way that only a kid who’s had to fight his whole life can. I don’t need witchcraft, I don’t need demons, and I don’t need pride.

You see, the spirits of the desert didn’t like that they lost their Desert Son and the secrets I took with me. I’m no longer a child wearing indifference like sunglasses. I have a purpose now, and I sure as hell ain’t bored anymore.

I destroyed the lighter last night. I accepted I deserve hell. I’ve led so many people down the path of darkness without even realizing it. I didn’t know people were watching and being influenced. Others wearing indifference like it was in style.  

What I also know is I can’t save myself from my fate. That’s just facts. You see, now something else is living in me. It’s burning inside, and it’s helping me finally make a difference in this fight. Death has no power over me now. I’m not fighting for victory anymore. I’m fighting from victory. I’ve got a new name, and it’s written in a book I never knew existed.

“Are you ready to finish my story, old man?” I say to a man sitting at the café’s small table, overlooking his tea.

“Not bored anymore?” he says with a Cajun accent.

I look at him with amusement painted on my face. I can feel my expression shift as I look into his eyes. My eyes start to turn to steel, my lips fall to a neutral placement, my shoulders relax. I leave the café without my coffee.

He’s baiting me, I think to myself. If I fight him now, everything I’m doing will be lost.

Funny — I have things to lose now. I’ve got an entire police force to look into before anything. There are also others who need to hear the Truth.

They deserve to be given a choice. Even if they make the wrong one, they need to know choices exist. 
If you see this man with his zippo, just know he’s a liar. He only offers pain and suffering wrapped in golden lies.

- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 6 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.

1ltg7n5,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1ltg7n5/how_a_loyalty_rewards_program_helped_one_of_my/,How a Loyalty Rewards Program Helped One of My Clients Grow Their Customer Base (and Keep Them Coming Back),"
I wanted to share something that’s been surprisingly effective for a few small business clients I’ve worked with—loyalty rewards programs.

Now before you roll your eyes and think “ugh, another punch card gimmick,” hear me out. I’m talking about modern, text-based or digital loyalty systems that actually track and automate customer engagement.

Here’s what I’ve seen:

✅ Repeat business went up — One local coffee shop client saw a 27% increase in repeat visits over 90 days after implementing a simple text-based rewards program. Customers got a text after their purchase with a thank-you message and a progress update toward a free drink. It kept them coming back without needing to manually hand out cards.

✅ Customer data — Instead of hoping people remember you, you now have a growing customer list you can engage with via SMS or email. Think: flash deals, birthday specials, VIP early access. You’re not just hoping they come back… you’re inviting them.

✅ Stronger connection — People love to feel appreciated. When you reward loyalty (even with small perks), you stand out from competitors who are just offering discounts to new customers. Loyalty builds brand love.

✅ It’s cheaper than you think — You don’t need to drop thousands. Some platforms offer low-cost monthly plans, and honestly, the ROI in terms of repeat business and referrals can be worth way more.

Not saying it’s a silver bullet—but if you’re a small business struggling with customer retention, it might be worth a look. Especially in local markets where relationships matter more than ever.

Anyone else tried this and seen results? Curious how it’s worked in other industries too.

It’s something we’ve been working towards for years, scraping together savings, scrolling endlessly through real estate listings, going to inspections only to be disappointed or outbid. When this house appeared within our budget, it felt like a small miracle. A moment of alignment in an otherwise unpredictable housing market. It’s a modest single-story home with a decent backyard, tucked away in a quiet, comfortable part of town. The kind of place that feels lived in.

It’s not huge or fancy, but it feels right. We managed to get it for around AUD 200,000, which still feels surreal given the market these days. The fact that we own a home in our mid-20s (I'm 26 while my girlfriend is 28) still doesn’t feel entirely real. It’s strange in a way I haven’t fully wrapped my head around.

Jen, my girlfriend, works full-time as a nurse, often on her feet for long hours. I compose music for TV and advertising, which means I’m usually based at home. While I keep fairly busy with projects, my schedule is more flexible than hers, so I usually take care of the housework and cooking. It’s a rhythm that works for us. I’m grateful that I get to do what I love creatively, while also having the time and space to explore my other interests and take care of our home.



I usually wear headphones while I work, listening to rough demos, sound libraries, or just letting a Spotify playlist play in the background. Even when I’m cleaning or folding laundry, I tend to keep something playing. Music fills the silence, keeps me moving. Which is probably why I didn’t notice the sound earlier.

It had been nearly two months since we moved in when I first heard it.

I was in the kitchen, making my second coffee of the day, when I heard it. A wheeze. Deep and nasal, like something catching its breath through dust-clogged lungs. It was subtle, almost buried under the hum of the kettle and the clink of the spoon in my mug. But it was there. Then came the creak of the floorboards. I figured it was just the house settling. Old wood, shifting temperatures, maybe even possums on the roof.

Still, something about the sound off. Almost rhythmic.

I tried to catch it again later that day, pressing pause on my music and standing still in the hallway, straining to hear something, *anything*. But the house held its silence.

A week would pass before I was certain I heard it again. Same as before, a deep wheeze followed by creaking floorboards. I tried to see if I could record it, but it went away before I could get one of my microphones from my studio. Later that night, when Jen came home from a shift, I tried talking to her about it, but after working a 12-hour shift, she wasn’t really in the mood to listen to any crazy talk from me. “I think you just need to get out of the house more.” she said, her voice flat, somewhere between exhaustion and irritation, as she slipped off her shoes.

At the time, I just laughed it off and agreed with her. It had to be some kind of cabin fever. So, I started spending less time at home. I would go for jogs around the suburbs instead of using the treadmill and take my laptop to local cafés to mix tracks, enjoying the ambient chatter and the way the afternoon sunlight filtered through the autumn leaves. For a while, it seemed to work. I didn’t notice any strange noises, and I started to feel a little more grounded again. Maybe I had just been going stir-crazy.

But that didn’t last.

One night, maybe two weeks later, I woke up around 3 a.m. The house was still. No wind, no passing cars. Just that heavy kind of silence that blankets everything in the early hours. I didn’t know why I woke up at first. Jen was snoring lightly beside me, her breathing steady. I lay there, trying to drift back off, when I heard it again.

The wheeze.

Louder this time. Closer. Wet.

I tried to wake Jen up, but her body was limp, heavy with sleep, and no matter how many times I whispered her name or nudged her shoulder, she didn’t stir. Her snores continued, undisturbed, steady and mechanical, as if on a loop. 

So I got up. I grabbed my phone, turned on the flashlight, and padded down the hallway. That’s when I noticed it. The air had changed. It was heavy with the smell of mildew, and the walls seemed slick, glistening faintly in the light. I pressed my fingers against the paint, and they came away damp.

The floorboards were colder in patches and sticky beneath my feet, as if something had seeped up through the cracks. My phone's light cast long, sickly shadows that pulsed faintly, almost imperceptibly, as if the house was… moving. Breathing.

I stood still. Watched. The shadows moved again. Slowly, subtly, like lungs expanding. Contracting.

The hallway exhaled.

That’s the only way I can describe it. The house let out a breath. Long and wheezing. I swear I felt it on my skin, warm and fetid, brushing the hairs on my arms.

I lifted my phone and hit record, capturing the sound before it vanished again.

I’ll try to embed it in this post. But if you hear what I heard, really *hear* it, just know: it wasn’t the wind. It wasn’t the pipes. And it sure as hell wasn’t the house settling.

It was breathing.



I finally managed to get Jen awake as the “house” stopped it’s breathing. I showed her the recordings, once she heard the breathing, I could see a look of fearful realisation cover her face.

We spent the rest of the night huddled on the couch with all the lights on, watching the hallway like it might lurch to life again. Neither of us could sleep. The air still felt wrong, as if we were intruding on something ancient and half-asleep. The damp hadn’t gone away either. It seemed to spread, blooming like black veins along the skirting boards and ceiling corners. 



The next day, we made a few calls, packed only the essentials, and left to stay at Jen’s parents’ place. We didn’t tell them about the breathing. How could we? Even if they believed us, how do you explain something so absurd and terrifying? We told them someone had broken in while we were asleep, that we didn’t feel safe. That much, at least, was true.

Neither of us has gone back since. Every time we tried to go back to grab the rest of our things, something stopped us. Not physically. Just a feeling. A pressure in our chests, the closer we got, like the air itself was warning us. Like the house knew we were coming and didn’t want us back.

But we still have the deed. The keys.The debt. The house is still ours.

Jen hasn’t gone back to work. “Fever,” she tells people. But most days, she just sits on the edge of the guest bed, staring. Thinking.

I’ve tried calling the previous owners. The real estate agent. I’m just greeted by voicemails. I think I’ll drive over. See if I can find them in person.

I’ll update this if I find anything.



Part 2:

A lot has happened since the last post, and I felt like it warranted an update. 

Jen still refuses to leave the house. She says being outside makes her feel unsafe now. She doesn’t go for walks anymore. She keeps the blinds closed, avoids the windows. Neither of us has been sleeping well. The nights feel longer here. Heavier. When I do sleep, I wake up drenched in sweat, heart pounding, sometimes convinced I’ve heard the wheezing sound again. 

Most of my time lately has been spent researching the house. I started with the basics, sales records, property listings, anything I could find online. But there wasn’t much. Just some outdated real estate pages and a few blurry Google Street View images that barely even show the front fence.

Like I mentioned in my last post, I’ve tried calling the real estate agent and the previous owner multiple times now. Still no response. Voicemails, disconnected numbers, and generic out-of-office messages. It’s like they’ve vanished. Or maybe they’re just choosing not to talk.

While I waited for callbacks that never came, I decided to dig deeper. I went to the local library, thinking I might find something in old council archives, maybe building permits, development plans, or even newspaper clippings. I thought it would be straightforward. 

But there was nothing. **Absolutely nothing.**

No building permits under our address. No zoning documents. The street shows up in current directories, but if you tried to cross-reference it with older maps, things get murky. A 1998 record lists the lot as an empty paddock. A 1986 street plan shows the area as part of a public reserve. The oldest aerial photographs, grainy black-and-whites from the '70s, show thick trees where the house should be. Just trees. No fence. No clearing. No structure. Over and over again, **our house simply isn’t there**.



None of this makes any sense. When we first toured the place, the agent told us the previous owner had inherited it from his parents, who’d supposedly built it in the 1970s. When I was on the phone with the owner, he even mentioned how it had been recently renovated. “Good bones,” he said. “Solid history.” He sounded casual, almost proud. Like he was passing down a family heirloom.

I couldn’t let it go. I *needed* to understand what we’d stepped into.

So I drove to the real estate office.

I didn’t make an appointment. I didn’t want to give anyone a chance to dodge me. I just walked in and asked to speak to the agent who’d sold us the house. The receptionist looked confused. She asked for his name again. I told her. She nodded slowly and said, “He’s out on appointments right now. We’ll let him know you stopped by.”

That was two weeks ago.

I’ve gone back three more times. Each time, it’s the same story. He’s “out.” No one knows when he’ll be back. When I press them, they fumble. They say they’ll pass along a message. They never ask for my number.

One of the other agents, a younger guy, looked uncomfortable when I brought the subject up. Like the name made him uneasy. He said, “I don’t think he works out of this office anymore. Might be with a different branch.” When I asked which one, he just shrugged.

**Dead end.**

There was only one lead left. One last thread I hadn’t pulled on yet.

I had to meet the original owner. In person.

After digging through digital directories and making a few quiet calls, I managed to track him down, or at least find someone with his name, living about an hour outside the city. I asked Jen if she wanted to come with me, but just mentioning the idea of her leaving her parents’ house made her eyes widen with a kind of sick panic. Her sleep deprivation is getting worse. Her face looks… hollow. Sunken. Like her features are being pulled inward, slowly collapsing.



So, I went alone. 



I don’t remember much of the drive. Just a blur of overcast sky and static-laced playlists. My GPS took me to a weathered old house surrounded by dying autumn trees. It was just after 5 p.m., but the sky looked darker than it should’ve. Overcast, but too still. 

I knocked.

When the door opened, I knew it was him. He looked older than I expected, but I recognised him from the property photos. He blinked at me, confused.

“Hello? What can I do you for?” he asked cheerfully. 

“Hey, I’m Will. I bought your old place recently. I was hoping I could ask you a few questions.”

His expression shifted. The friendliness drained from his face like someone turning off a light. His smile vanished. He stared at me for a long moment, then stepped aside.

“…Why don’t you come in?” he said quietly. “I’ll make you a cuppa.”

His voice was polite, but his posture was rigid. Braced.

The house smelled like dust and old clothes. He moved slowly, placing two chipped mugs on a low table. No sugar. No milk. He didn’t ask what I liked.

Then he sat down. Said nothing.

“So,” I began, “I’ve been looking into the house’s history. And I can’t find anything before 1999. No permits, no records. It’s like it didn’t exist until recently.”

He didn’t react.

“I just want to know what we bought.”

Finally, he exhaled, slow, deliberate.

“You shouldn’t have come here,” he said. “That place… it doesn’t belong on any record.”

I said nothing.

“We didn’t build it,” he continued. “We found it. My parents thought it was just some old settler’s house, abandoned out in the scrub. The roads hadn’t reached that far yet. They thought they could fix it. Make it ours.”

His hands were shaking.

“But it wasn’t right. Not even then. The more time we spent there, the more it changed. The halls got longer. Corners started shifting. One day, a door appeared in the laundry. We opened it once. Never again.”

He looked up at me, eyes red, sunken.

“My parents got sick. We all did. The air there… it sticks to you. Slows everything down.”

I swallowed hard. “So why sell it? Why now?”

His brow furrowed.

“I didn’t.”

“What?”

“I never sold it to anyone,” he said. “I haven’t set foot near that place in over forty years. I never went back.”

“But… I spoke to you. You told me it had good bones.”



His face twisted, like the words stirred a memory he didn’t want to acknowledge.

“I never said that,” he muttered. “Not to you.”

I felt a chill move through me. “I remember it. Your voice. You said it had a solid history, that it had been renovated. You sounded proud.”

He stared at me. “You should go now.”

Not unkind. But final.

I drove home in silence. No music. Just the hum of the tyres and the noise in my head.

I haven’t told Jen what he said. I don’t know how. She’s barely functioning. She won’t eat. Won’t leave the guest bedroom. I hear her whispering at night. When I check, she’s either asleep or pretending.

The wheezing is back. Faint, behind the bathroom mirror.

The walls in this house, Jen’s parents’ house, creak like they’re shifting. Like they’re learning how to breathe.

Yesterday morning, the hallway outside the guest room was longer than it should’ve been. Just by one step.

But I noticed.

I think I’m going crazy.

But I’m going to try one more thing.

There's a name I found in the archives, a local historian who went missing in the early 2000s while investigating undocumented properties in this area. His last known article referenced a “structure with no origin, no footprint, and no end.”

I’ll try to make another post when I can.

  
Final:

This will probably be my last post about this topic, or last post in general. I’m not even sure if I’m writing this to anyone. I think I need to say it out loud. Maybe it’ll get out. I found the historian. Or at least... I found where he went.

I guess I’ll just walk you through what happened.



Jen’s getting better. But only just.

I tried to take her to the hospital, but anytime someone got too close, she panicked. Screamed. One nurse tried to calm her down and ended up with a black eye. After that, I brought her back home to her parents’ place. I told myself I’d wait it out. See if she improved.

And for a while, it looked like she might. She started speaking again. Short sentences. Asking for water. Responding to her name. I thought maybe… just maybe… she was coming back to me.

Then her dad said something that gutted me.

“Will, I think it’s about time you and Jen returned home.”

Just like that. Calm. Direct. Like we were overstaying our welcome, and it was time to move on.

I just stared at him. Eyes bloodshot from endless research over this thing I had brought into our lives. I didn’t know what to say.

“We can’t go back,” I said, though there wasn’t much fight in my voice. I was too tired for that.

He sighed. Not annoyed, just worn down. “Look, Will. Julie and I have been happy to take you both in while you recovered from the… break-in. But Jen’s looking better. And we think it’s best should get back to your lives.”

Our lives.

Back to *that* house.

I nodded, because what else could I do? I said I’d talk to Jen about it, that we’d figure something out. He smiled, relieved, and patted me on the shoulder like everything was going to be fine. Like this was normal.

That night, I sat beside Jen in the guest room. The lights were off, but she was awake. Staring at the ceiling like she was watching something move across it. Her breathing was shallow. Steady.

“Jen,” I said softly. “Your dad wants us to go back.”

She didn’t respond.

“We don’t have to,” I added quickly. “Not yet. But they think we should.”

Her eyes flicked toward me. Just slightly. Then she whispered, almost inaudible: **“We’re already in it.”**

I sat up straighter. “What?”

She didn’t repeat herself. Just closed her eyes and turned her face to the wall.



There was only one thing I could think to do. The only thing that might convince them we couldn’t go back.I had to show them.I had to take them to the house.

So that’s exactly what I did.

“I need you both to come with me.”

I stood in their living room; my voice firmer than it had been in weeks. They looked at me with quiet surprise, not quite shock, but like they didn’t expect such a sudden shift from me.

Without much hesitation, they agreed. Maybe they were humouring me. Maybe they were just tired, too.



The house was worse than I remembered.

The air around it felt heavier, like it dragged at your lungs when you breathed it in. The walls were discoloured, streaked with black moss or mould that hadn’t been there before. The bricks looked swollen, as if the house had grown bloated, distended. Something inside was pushing outward, trying to escape. Or burst.

Even the lawn was wrong. Too green. Too still. Like plastic grass laid over rotten earth.

When we reached the front door, I froze. My hand hovered over the knob.

I hadn’t been back since *that* night.

Then I opened it.

A wave of cool, damp air spilled out. Wet and earthy, like the inside of a cave.

That *smell*. The mildew, the rot. It wrapped around you like a second skin. Yet, it was oddly nostalgic. 



“Gotta get the parents to clean up the house for yah?” Jen’s dad offered, voice light, strained. He chuckled. An attempt at humour, I guess.

The house was darker than it should’ve been. We hadn’t touched the power; the mains were still on, but no lights came on when I flicked the switch. The bulbs stayed cold. Dead. 

Jen’s mum paused just inside the door. Her hand went to her chest.“Will, it’s freezing in here.”

I didn’t respond. I couldn’t. I was staring at the hallway.

It was different again. Longer. Tilted slightly, the floor was sloping downward. The edges of the walls were soft, like they were made of wet paper.

Jen’s dad wandered a few steps ahead, peering into the living room. “God, what happened here?” The floorboards were bowing inward toward the centre of the room. The wallpaper had peeled back in long strips, revealing a pulsing black growth that didn’t look like mould. It looked like veins.



As I opened my mouth to speak, the house began to rumble.

**Then Wheeze.**

An exhale.

A long, slow, wet sound, rising from the floorboards, from the walls, from *beneath* us.



“What the hell was that?” Jen’s mum said, fear cracking her voice.

I could see their faces changing.

Jen’s dad stood rigid, staring down the hallway like he was being *called*. His lips moved, but no sound came out.

Jen’s mum began backing away, eyes wide, muttering, “This isn’t right, this isn’t right,” over and over again, each repetition softer, fainter.



“We need to leave now,” I said with an authority unbecoming of me

But all I got back from Jen’s parents was a small, whispered phrase. 

“We’re already in it.”

Behind us, something slammed. The door to the guest room. Then another. And another. The house was closing, getting ready to grow upon itself.

The hallway stretched again, visibly this time. The light at the end pulled away like a retreating star. The shadows grew deeper, thicker. They started to ripple.

I turned back to Jen’s mum. She was gone. No sound. No scream. Just… gone.

Her shoes were still by the mat.

I grabbed Jen’s dad by the arm, tried to pull him toward the kitchen, but he didn’t budge. His feet were rooted to the spot. I looked down and saw black sludge creeping up his ankles like vines.

He didn’t scream. He didn’t even move. He just looked at me with those distant eyes, like whatever part of him could have fought had already gone quiet.

“Don’t-” I tried, but my voice caught in my throat.

The black tendrils pulsed once, then surged up his legs like liquid rope. They reached his chest in seconds, and with a horrible, wet *pop*, he was gone. Just… folded in on himself and *gone*.

The hallway groaned. Not the creak of old timber, but a deep organic groan. The sound a throat might make if it stretched too wide.

I ran.

Spiralling endlessly into itself, the halls of this creature extend out as I run throughout its bowels. 

Rooms repeated. Doorways led back to earlier ones. The floor throbbed beneath my feet.

I ran until I didn’t know if I was moving forward or down. I eventually stopped running. I was already deep in its depths.

There is no centre to this house. No heart to reach. No exit to claw toward. The deeper I went, the warmer the air became. The more it pulsed with a rhythm I couldn’t name.

And yet, I persisted

As I wandered, all I heard now was the deep wheezing of the house.

There are rooms I can’t look into. Shapes moving behind doors I refuse to open. But I’m not scared anymore. I don’t think I have the energy for fear. Just a heavy, sinking calm.

One of the rooms I came across held some human remains.Just pieces: hair matted into the floorboards, clothing reduced to threadbare scraps, and bones warped and softened by time, or digestion. The skull looked partially melted, the jaw fused to the floor.

I think it was the historian.

Another room seemed to lead to the outside world. This artificial sun was blinding my eyes as I stepped onto fake plastic grass.

The sky above was a perfect gradient, soft blue into pale gold. Not a cloud in sight. The air was warm and still, like the world had been paused, not lived in, just rendered.

There were no insects. No birds.Only the slow, steady wheeze from somewhere beneath the soil.

I stepped back inside. And I keep walking.

I pass familiar rooms dressed in unfamiliar skin, the guest bedroom, the kitchen, my studio, all repeating like echoes losing shape. Some of the doors lead nowhere. Some lead to things that almost look like people. Some look like Jen.

I’m sitting on the floor now, writing this on my near-death phone, the walls are warm against my back. They rise and fall, slow and steady. Breathing. Always breathing.

It doesn’t hate us.

It doesn’t even notice us .

A place where Time doesn’t move unless I do.

Step forward, and the world lurches ahead—people blur, clouds streak, conversations flicker past like scenes on fast-forward.

Step backward, and everything rewinds: traffic flows in reverse, spilled coffee leaps back into cups, even the sun crawls eastward across the sky.

Stand still, and it all freezes.

No sound. No breath.

Only deafening stillness.

As if the world’s frame rate depends on my step count.

Nobody can see me. Nobody can feel me.

Am I a ghost?

Did I die?

Am I the only one?

I’ve been here so long, I think.

Time means nothing.

I can follow anyone’s life with the right sequence of steps—

like playing that six degrees game, bouncing from stranger to stranger,

watching their lives unfold one step at a time.

I’ve given up trying to get back to normal, linear time.

I’ve found a new home.

Her.

I’ve seen every moment of her life.

Her birth to…

My one regret is not being able to build one with her.

I’ve spent lifetimes just staring at her face.

Her whole life is like a photo album to me—

a collection of moments I can flip through with a few steps.

Seeing whatever version of her I want is easier than walking down the street.

Every version of her is my favorite.

I know this sounds creepy.

I don’t care.

She makes me feel like I’m with someone.

Sometimes she just stares into empty space.

And if I position myself just right,

I feel seen.

The first time I walked through her life, I couldn’t accept the end.

How unnecessary her death was.

I walked the lives of everything in that moment—

down to the birds in the air and the baby sleeping two houses down.

Everything just happened to line up perfectly.

Like a math equation.

No matter how loud I screamed at her not to cross the street.

Regardless of how I begged the mother to look out her window.

I couldn’t get the driver to look at the road and not the birds.

I couldn’t even stop the bird from flying that way to begin with.

Every step forward after her death is a moment in a world without her.

I don’t want that world.

I’ve never been to her funeral.

I don’t know what they did with her body.

She doesn’t exist like that for me.

I never go that far.

I guess it’s like a TV show you’ve seen a thousand times.

You just start over.

Step here.

Step there.

Her happiest moment was her ninth birthday.

I’ve seen every smile she’s ever given,

and none of them reach the sides of her mouth

like that one after the candles blow out.

This is where I live.

With her,

in her greatest joy.

I must be dead.

And this is hell.

1ltg1s2,https://v.redd.it/w9gwm2gtfcbf1,Is Using Celebrity in Commercials Smart or Lazy?,"When celebrity marketing shines—and when it falls flat

📦 Framing the Question
Celebrity endorsements can catapult a brand into the spotlight—but are they always strategic? This question goes beyond glitz, touching the core of brand authenticity and audience alignment. In this post, we explore when star power elevates a brand and when it becomes lazy marketing. Understand the psychology behind celebrity appeal, learn from iconic campaigns, and discover how to align fame with substance.

The Power of Association: Why Celebrities Work

Celebrities naturally draw attention. Their fame becomes a spotlight for the products they endorse. Done right, a celebrity’s values and audience align with the brand, creating instant trust and recognition.

Social proof: “If it’s good enough for them, it’s good enough for me.”
Brand recall: A memorable face ties to a memorable product.
Aspirational appeal: Celebrities symbolize what people aspire to—beauty, status, success.
📌 Case in Point: Michael Jordan and Nike
This wasn’t just a partnership—it was a brand-defining era. Jordan was athletic excellence, and Nike sold that aspiration in every Air Jordan box.

📊 A Nielsen study found celebrity endorsements can increase brand recall by up to 20% and improve sales by an average of 4%.

When It Becomes Lazy Marketing

Star power isn’t always smart. Sometimes, brands slap on a famous face without thinking through the fit.

Watch for these red flags:

Poor alignment: No shared values or audience with the celeb.
Overreliance: Using fame instead of building a message.
Short-term buzz: No lasting narrative or emotional resonance.
📌 Misstep Example: A celebrity endorses a tech product they clearly don’t use—resulting in inauthentic, ineffective messaging.

📊 Ace Metrix (2021) found only 12% of celebrity ads outperformed non-celebrity ones, often due to a lack of genuine connection.

Smart vs. Lazy: A Real-World Comparison

Two beverage campaigns, two outcomes:

Smart: George Clooney for Nespresso. Worldly, elegant, refined—mirroring the brand’s identity.
Lazy: A pop star with no coffee credibility pushing a generic soda. Flashy but forgettable.
Clooney didn’t just promote coffee—he personified it.

How to Use Celebrity Marketing Intelligently

To avoid falling into the lazy trap, use this checklist:

Match values and vibe: Does the celeb live your brand’s promise?
Tell a story: Is the narrative compelling, not just flashy?
Support with substance: Is there real value beneath the star power?
Think long-term: Build a relationship, not a cameo.
When used with clarity and care, celebrity endorsements become not just seen—but remembered and trusted.

Summary

Star power can either elevate or erode your brand—depending on how well it’s aligned. The smartest marketers use celebrity influence as a bridge between identity and audience, not a replacement for strategy. When fame meets authenticity, the results resonate.

Okay, this whole post is a spoiler.

>!So, I am still on the kool-aid, but it’s getting intense. I am reading the part about the details of the group contract Eleven was made to sign. !<

>! I only ever read cruelty in full fantasy side, but never with involvement of humans. If people have read or seen the series Manifest, or the 100 or the Hunger Games, dystopians, it gives you an idea what humanity can become. In Manifest, how the people from flight were seculded and kept under watch. So much like settlements in this book series. And as the blurb of this book say it's much like Hunger games. But they were all humans, and somehow I wasn't that affected!<

>! What is getting intense for me is actually reading how the choice, the freedom, the free will is taken away. There is not an ounce of fairness anywhere. The recruitment to the Stone Dahlia aka the adult trafficking? Watching a film still didn't land that level of impact.!<

>! I think what I am trying to say is, most books I've read, the  above-mentioned things are already established or just skimmed over. In this book, you can follow along the emotional tide of every character and how they slowly get sucked into these things. Which is getting intense. The tipping point I decided this was all intense, was the contract. 90% earnings to label and you get 10% to split between group? For 15 years? Can't marry, can't have relationship? Have to put yourself on display day and night? serve coffee? !<

 I have more to say, but I should end it here. Does anyone else got into a thinking streak about what money and power can mean behind the glamorous portrayal on screen and how dark it actually is in real world?

PS: I hope people can overlook the constant mention of this series in this subreddit. I am in the middle of reading this book and was looking for safe space for a discussion like this.",1,1751846452.0,ReverseHarem,0,1.0,False

Started with a V dipole made from a broken tape measure and messed around with receiving NOAA APT transmissions. Had a blast trying different things to get a better signal/image. Printed off the helicone antenna for the NOAA HRPT signals but haven't tried it yet. Just about finished building the rotator out of old 3d printer parts, hoping to test it out next weekend.

Then I found an old 3m C-band dish at a friend's place. After a sketchy ride on the trailer to our farm, I got it set up last weekend. Found an old coffee tin with a bunch of rusty nuts and bolts that was just about the perfect size for a GOES-R cantenna. Dumped out the contents and built the cantenna based on the online calculator. Scrounged up some scraps to mount it on the arm and finally got to download some sweet sweet GOES data. Man, what a bunch of fun, and our planet is so beautiful. Excited to get back to it next weekend!

Sorry for rambling but I do also have a few questions:

* The dish is missing a mesh panel and a few other are kinda disfigured. Obviously this will have some effect on the quality just wondering how much? Satdump said my SNR was around 13 and it was green so I'm assuming that is ok
* I'm currently using a Nooelec NESDR smart and running power to the Sawbird+ GOES LNA. I wouldn't mind getting another SDR but which one would you guys recommend with Bias-T? Was kinda looking at the Smartee XTR but not sure
* What else can I do with this big old dish? Would love some ideas for future projects

No idea how my sugars spiked from 98 to 145 while making breakfast. After taking my insulin and eating my sugars were still elevated 2.5 hours later. They only went down to 130 after eating and waiting the limit. I decided to go for a bike ride to lower my sugars and they are at 170 now after a 12 mile/1 hour bike ride. My bf and I went at a moderate pace. Not fast but not slow because I just started biking. Is it normal for them to spike before coming down?

That way I could just send all of my new world stuff that I'll want in bulk (rum, cotton, gold, coffee, etc.) straight to cape trelawny, and have everyone who would need it only in cape trelawny.

If I had artisans or higher in the old world, I would have to import new world stuff into cape trelawny and the old world, but if I just had farmers and workers, I could purely dedicate the old world to resource extraction and some production, without any imports, just sending raw goods to cape trelawny where they could be either consumed or processed by artisans, engineers, and investors.

In particular I'm thinking about things like fur coats, which both artisans and engineers need, so if I had either in the old world, it could potentially delay my production lines, since I would have to 1) import cotton 2) produce fur 3) make the fur coats and 4) move the fur coats to both regions. If I just had artisans in cape trelawny, I could just skip that 4th step and either produce fur in cape trelawny, or produce it in the new world and import it to cape trelawny (or both). Same with rum, and with other goods if I put engineers/investors in the old world.

basically, would it be a good idea to only have artisans and higher in cape trelawny so I don't need to move around products that require stuff from the new world to multiple regions",2,1751846123.0,anno,1,1.0,False

They got semiannual sales, I got a semiannual empties post, plus a little extra :).

In no particular order, other than my loose memory of supposed chronology, beginning with ""I really could have finished this by the end of 2024"" but did on like New Years Day or week or what have you to I just started using a new blush today because I finished this one yesterday and I already miss it.

**The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Light Cleansing Oil**: I think my brother got this, not realizing he doesn't really need it since he doesn't wear makeup (have to remind him to put on sunscreen tbh). I was like ugh, I'll use it Ig. Tell me why I liked it so much omg. I really warmed up to cleansing balms so I wasn't familiar with actual liquid form, but this was fantastic. I was pretty liberal with my use, due to my heavy full beat (2 pumps), but lasted me over half a year, I think. I sometimes see this at the local TJ Maxx and I might pick it up again later.

**Eau Thermale Avene TriXera Nutrition Nutri-fluid Lotion**: smaller version of what I finished last year. Not much change in thought (not the most pleasant smell. Watery and runs out too fast), other than I did warm up to it.

**Coola Sunless Tan Anti-Aging Face Serum**: wait, I did not read the name of the product until right this very moment as I type this and may have used this on my arms and legs. Glad I didn't use it on my face, given it was hit and miss, including being orange and patchy at some of the fewer than a handful times I used it. I liked how it smelled in the beginning, but it became gross later.

**ELF Beautifully Bare Liquid Highlighter**: I got this because I couldn't get the Jelly Pop highlighter stick (both times! :(). It's so bad omg. I gave it so many chances, with different application methods (finger, sponge, brush) and uses (eyelid, high points of face, clavicle, arms/legs). It's super liquid, no matter how much I shake, and oily, lifting and muddying up the products underneath. For my limbs, I used it as all over highlighter and it just doesn't do anything, in either highlighting or moisturizing. Every time I would think that a regular body lotion would be better.

**Dream Dream Hand Cream in ""Scarlett Rose:""** last dedicated hand cream, other than the bona fide last tube at work. The reason was that I really didn't like the smell, so I didn't use it until it became my only option. I like the scent of rose enough. It's not my absolute favorite, but I like it. Except this thing is overwhelming, both initially and after application, just lingering. I also felt like the product didn't dry down enough and would feel oily, no matter how little/much I used. But it was winter, I needed hand cream, and I've grown to like it enough that I felt a little sad when I was done with it.

**Tower 28 LipSoftie Tinted Lip Treatment in ""Dulce de Leche:""** got it as a gift from a friend when she ordered a couple tubes at launch. I like using whatever I have, especially for more practical items like lip balm. That said, this was such a delight. Smelled so decadent and moisturized my lips so nicely. Warm and thick, just like the name. I used it as lip balm/treatment at home only, but it's such a flattering shade. I felt bad because my friend got another one for herself after I liked it so much.

**Keenoniks Rosy Tone-Up Sunmilk**: a mineral sunscreen with not as much white cast, due to the pinkish tint. I found it brightening (without being whitening) and comfortable on the skin, especially in the winter. My thing is, I got this last winter from somebody and it expires before end of 02/2025. I was almost done with the ELF sunscreen, but because sunscreen is the one product category I actually mind the expiration date of, I used this, very liberally. Joke's on me though, because I think the ""liberal"" amount is the actually dermatologist recommended amount. Unfortunately I finished it about a week or two after the expiration date, but I really liked it.

**ELF Suntouchable! Invisible Sunscreen**: I think I got it as the birthday gift last year. I wanted to try Supergoop for the longest time, so I was super excited for this. I really liked it initially, finding it smoothing and blurring (I love the silicone texture). I was almost done with it by the end of the year, but as previously mentioned, the Keenoniks had to be used up first, so I put this aside. When I came back to it, I just didn't like it as much? Possibly because I quite liked the other one and how moisturizing that was. It didn't help that this also started pilling. It's still not expired btw. I think I'll stick with more moisturizing sunscreens.

**Mise en Scene Perfect Serum**: I do the absolute bare minimum with my hair. I get a haircut every other year to donate. I brush it, tie it up in ponytail. Rarely have it down so when I do, people make comments (it gets hot and the hair can mess with my lipstick). I shampoo, but only sometimes condition (when my hair is longer and closer to the cut). As in I'm not the target market for any hair products (other than the growing serums but they are so expensive. I still dream of Grow Gorgeous). But my mom was going to throw it out, so I used it. I think she got it from a hairdresser. I quite liked it. It made my hair softer and shinier, arguably even darker? I could tell when I didn't use it. I still don't think I'll go out of my way to get hair products myself, but if people want to throw them but, I'll volunteer as a panner. Oh, and amazing smell. Warm, luxurious. Very much a hair salon smell.

**Milani Baked Powder Blush in ""12: Bella Bellini:""** one of the products from makeup swap with a friend last year. I used up Petal Primavera last year and liked it so I thought I would like this one too. Wrong. Way more glitter/highlighter, giving too much sheen. Also it didn't build up as much as the other shade. Now that I think about it, this might have worked better as an eyeshadow or for those with deeper skin tone, highlighter.

**Haus Labs by Lady Gaga Triclone Skin Tech Foundation in ""120: Light Warm:""** another of makeup swap products. When I first tried it, the color was a little off (a bit too warm?), but the more I used it, the more I understood why people love this product so much. It feels, I don't know, intuitive? Like the product ""gets"" skin, like it's almost adapting to it. It provides coverage without being suffocating. My skin looks and feels like skin, but better. All the things I like in a good foundation, but somehow better. I don't know, like I feel like there is actually some innovative stuff here. A bit too expensive for me, but I really loved it. Now can I please get some tickets, please please please.

**ELF No Budge Cream Eyeshadow in ""Wispy Cloud:""** I really liked the Tonymoly eye brightener as eyeshadow primer so much that I got this. Big mistake. Big. Huge. Yeah, I know it's not a primer, but it doesn't work well as an eyeshadow or liner either. Patchy, dries down too fast. Silver lining is I got good at working with eyeshadows very quickly (have the brushes packed with the shadows and pat it on the second my finger is off my eyelid). I'm going to clean this up and let it join my jar club.

**Well People Power Palette Eyeshadow in ""Amethyst:""** I got it from Influenster and I was so excited at the shade selection. 9 times out of 10, I will go for shimmery shades, except when it comes to matte mauves or other colors similar to it (dusty pinkish purples). It's not the absolute worst, like some of the shades were better than others (the matte mauveish color), but I don't think it's worth it. Inconsistent and more than half the shades were patchy, even with me giving fair tries with all the methods I know. This is a clean beauty product, so I had to use this up before anything else, and even then, I feel like the product deteriorated noticeably. No, really. My oldest eyeshadow palette (using it rn) is from 2012. Infinitely better than this and from reading my old reviews, I actually complained about that very product before. Glad I got to try it, but wasn't terribly impressed with the product, brand, or clean beauty in general.

**Rare Beauty Always an Optimist 4-in-1 Mis**t: another makeup swap product. I still don't know what the product is really for, like it didn't really set my makeup and I think it about melded the finished face together as well as other mists. That said, I used it when my makeup felt too much (usually the powder atop) and I liked how it made my face feel more comfortable. I'm going to clean the bottle out and reuse it, because I do like the mister.

**The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA**: got it from my brother, who buys a lot of TO, but uses much less. It's mild, if not ineffective (I feel harsh for saying it). It's very boring, but I have other products that I can use the same words for with more fondness. I wasn't the biggest fan, but there were some actives that I was testing out that needed finishing moisturizer on top, which this served as. It did its job, I guess. I would personally not buy it. If there were other choices, I'd probably not reuse it. I wasn't thrilled with it.

**Youth to the People 15% Vitamin C + Caffeine Energy Serum**: got it from BzzAgent. As a coffee aficionado, I was super excited to try this, even knowing that it's not coffee (I don't discriminate. I like tea, energy drinks, etc. as long as it's delicious). It actually smelled more like ginger? Still, after I learned that caffeine can be applied topically, I always wanted to give it a go. I think... it worked? I feel like it made my face look not as puffy, in the most indiscernible way? I really can't tell, to be honest. But it felt indulgent adding a step to my morning skincare routine. Also this thing lasted practically daily use for more than 6 months. I personally wouldn't buy it myself, but if you are interested, it does last a while.

**Clio Kill Cover Mesh Glow Cushion in ""Linen:""** got it as a gift and I hate to say it after looking at the price, but this was incredible. Such high coverage, all the while making my skin look like hydrated, beautiful, and near perfect. Works well with all types of skincare products, as well as powder and cream makeup products. Long-lasting but fades gracefully. The puff design with a little corner for smaller area application is so, so smart. Probably the best cushion foundation in that when I cut it open after suspecting being out of the product itself, I could see that there was no waste with a sponge/cushion sucking it up, because it's the product, then the mesh to control the amount of the product. Beautiful, if not excessive packaging. If I had the money, I may be tempted to keep the compact for refills. 

**Rouge Dior in ""952: Cafe de Paris,"" Clinique Almost Lipstick in ""Black Honey,""** and **ELF Sheer Slick Lipstick in ""Black Cherry:""** last year was all about fuchsia/magenta/deeper and bolder pinks. This year, I'm leaning more towards these deeper berries with hints of brown that lean purple-ish? I had the Dior lipstick for years and in the beginning, I was like ooh, it's so dramatic and dark. Now, I feel like it lacked color on me. Love the formula, but if anything, could use that extra oomph (Rose Harpers >). Still really liked it, especially in colder weather. I got the Clinique sample from a friend, who said she can't wear red lips. Tried to tell her I heard it's natural but she didn't want it. I wanted to try this thing for the longest time, so I was so, so excited. I was honestly ready to hate on it, given that I don't do natural makeup and don't really believe in universal, one for all products. Ugh, I love it so much. The formula is so strange, like it builds up but never becomes opaque, but it still can look dramatic. This with a darker lip liner... Incredible. I got a lot of comments (lowkey don't love that people think I'm toning it down and going for pretty rather than striking, like nah, blue-based reds until the day I croak). I feel like it can be dry at times, but it's lowkey chic? This with black/burgundy outfits have been excellent. I liked it so much I got the ELF one as a dupe. I think it's serviceable and I don't mean that with any negativity. If anything, I think this one is even more practical, even setting aside price. I think the application/stay is more consistent, in that it has more glide and is more moisturizing. It has a lot more slip, so I definitely used the said lipliner every time. With ELF price increase looming, I think I'll pick up at least one more (with how much I like it, I think I'll keep picking it up, which is absolutely insane to me, because I have absolutely no brand, much less product, loyalty, especially for ""fun"" color products like lipstick). I adore this color.

July empties so far, because I want to drop them off, even though if I wait a couple more days, I could also include my lip balm which already has been cut open and has probably 2-3 uses left:

**ELF Primer-Infused Blush in ""Always Punchy:""** I heard such great reviews and it did not disappoint. At 10g, this thing is a monster and took forever, but I liked it so much that it really didn't feel long. Took forever to hit the initial pan, but once that happened, I finished it relatively fast. I think ELF always excelled in blushes, at least the powders in my experience. They are always a tad bit too powdery with a lot of fallout/kickback (dw, I tap them back into the compact), but also always beautiful, anywhere from natural smidge of color to dramatic opacity. I'm so tempted to buy more of these (they don't have the initial color lineup, it appears) before the price increase, but I'm resisting because I have blushes for years to come. I miss it already though.

**Maybelline Color Jolt Intense Lip Paint in ""30: Red-dy or Not:""** I got this as an F it impulse buy in early 2019 for less than $2? I love this thing so much. This is a problem product, in that it gets everywhere, especially my teeth, even though I don't lick my lips. Like the whole time I was using it, no matter how careful I was, it would get everywhere, not just on my person. Even so, it's so freaking beautiful in the way I need my lip products to be. Yes, it can be pretty with lighter application and I like it, but the full opacity application with the full vinyl shine. Unmatched. Summer in a tube. One of my top 3 all time favorite lip products is this discontinued Dior lip product that's not necessarily gloss, even though that would be the closest product category. Insanely intense red and shine. This is that but deeper in tone, with more opacity and stick. Top 5, if there is space. If not, I might have to make space. Lowkey should be called a nightmare product, but I loved this so bad.

**Glamfox Rice Niacinamide Cleansing Balm**: I like cleansing balms so much that when I ran out last night, I ordered the ELF one ASAP (excited to try it). Along with bronzer and lip liner, cleansing balm is one of the product categories I thought I would not be for, but cannot go without. The jar is a bit misleading, in that there is actually smaller cup inside, containing less product than you'd expect at first glance. It actually lasted near daily, very liberal use for nearly half a year. I also really like the scoop. I think I've seen this at TJ Maxx and I wouldn't be opposed to getting more. I'm going to let the jar join the jar club.

1ltfqbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ltfqbu/the_scarecrows_watch/,The Scarecrows Watch,"My name’s Ben, and I was fifteen the summer I stayed with my grandparents.

Mom said it would be “good for me.” A break from the city life. Somewhere quiet after Dad died in that car crash. I didn’t argue. What was there to argue about anymore?

Their house sat on a couple dozen acres in rural North Carolina, surrounded by woods and with a massive cornfield that buzzed with cicadas day and night. My grandfather, Grady, still worked the land, even though he was in his seventies. Grandma June mostly stayed in the house, baking, knitting, and watching old TV shows on a television twice my age.

They were kind, but strange. Grady never smiled, and Grandma’s eyes always seemed to be looking at something just over your shoulder. The cornfield was their pride and joy. Tall stalks, thick rows, perfectly maintained. And right in the middle stood the scarecrow. I saw it on the first day I arrived.

It was too tall (like seven feet) and its limbs were wrong. Thin and knotted like old tree branches you’d see in rain forest videos. It wore a faded flannel shirt and a burlap sack over its head, stitched in a crude smile. I don’t know what it was but something about it made my skin crawl. When I asked about it, Grandma just said, “It keeps the birds out. Don’t want them crows eating our corn Benny.”

Grady didn’t answer at all.

But at night, I’d hear things. Rustling from the field. Thuds. Low groans, like someone dragging a heavy sack over dry ground. I convinced myself it was wind. Or raccoons. Or just being away from home, messing with my head. I just wasn’t use to the quiet at night. I was hearing things I never would or could in the city.

Until the fifth  night.

I woke up thirsty and walked past the kitchen window to get a glass of water. That’s when I saw it. The scarecrow wasn’t where it should’ve been. Now it was closer to the house.

It had moved. I blinked. Rubbed my eyes. But there it stood, just at the edge of the field now. Still. Watching.

I told Grady the next morning. He just looked up from his coffee and said, “Don’t go into the corn. Not unless you want to take its place.”

I laughed nervously, thinking it was a joke. He didn’t laugh back.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. So I did what every dumb kid in your classic Hollywood horror story does. I grabbed a flashlight and went into the field.

The corn was thick, and hard to move through. Every rustle made me flinch. I turned in circles, trying to find the scarecrow.

The corn stocks rustled just off to my left. I froze in place. My heart thudded in my chest like a jackhammer. I peeked a few rows over and there it was. I couldn’t believe my eyes. It was… Walking.

Its feet dragged in the dirt, but it was moving, limbs twitching, head tilted unnaturally to one side. It stopped a few rows away from me, as if it knew I was there.

I didn’t scream. Hell, I couldn’t. I just turned and ran, crashing through stalks, until I saw the porch light. Grady stood outside, shotgun in hand.

“You went into the corn, didn’t you!?” he said, not angry. Just…

Behind me, I heard the rows rustle.

“You better get inside now,” he yelled. “It’s seen you!”",2,1751845827.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

when we met i had just broken up with my boyfriend and was single. we started talking every day and would spend all day and night talking. some months into our friendship i realised i had feelings for him and told him, he said he didn't feel the same way but wanted to remain friends and we did. 

some months after that i got back together with my ex and me and my best friend started to talk less and less. two months ago, me and my bf split up and i became single again. the day after we broke up, my friend asked me how i was doing and we started talking more and more. fast forward a month, my friend tells me he has feelings for me that can't be explained as just platonic or strictly romantic. he tells me him and his boyfriend are in an open relationship and he would like to extend our friendship to include physical acts of intimacy if i would like that (sorry for being clinical with this, but that's pretty much how he worded it). he said explicitly it wouldn't be a poly thing.

at first i was shocked and felt weird and kinda hurt by this, but we started talking about it and it started making sense in my head. his bf reached out to me and we had a coffee and talked about it. i agreed to it and we started sleeping together. 

the thing is, sometimes it feels like he forgets we aren't in a relationship (joking around saying he's jealous of my ex partners or calling me his prince, getting weirdly somber when i mention other people taking interest in me) and it geniunely doesn't feel like just sex anymore, if it ever did. we spend most of our time together laying in bed, cuddling, and telling each other how much we love each other. 

sometimes when we have sex we just stop in the middle of it, look in each other's eyes, hold the other's gaze for some time and then immediately start cuddling because we love each other so much. 

the thing that keeps fucking me up is when he compares me to his bf (physically and in other ways). 

i don't feel jealous, i just feel offended in the way that this all works in my head if i'm not a romantic option in a way that his bf is (not that kind of list, not that category) but by doing this it feels like i very much am an option but i'm just second best. 

also, him mentioning his boyfriend didn't bother me at first (bc he talked a lot about him before we started sleeping together too) and it still doesn't. if i'm not imagining them having sex. if i do, i get this sick feeling in my stomach.  

it's weird bc if it's only a sex thing then that solves the 'second best' problem, but opens a new problem, which is that i love this guy and it would feel like he's lying to me. if it's a poly thing (in the way that he does love me in a romantic way) then that would fix the 'he doesn't love me' problem but open the 'second best' problem. if he told me he loves me and wants to be monogamous that would open the horrible attachment issues i have since leaving my ex. 

so, any hope for me at all?",4,1751845671.0,nonmonogamy,2,1.0,False
1ltfnrw,https://i.redd.it/8ubxhqyj5cbf1.png,Just about had a heart attack (GRAVEL),"One of my last rides of the season, after putting around 8,000km on my first bike, I had just started my return trip after having a coffee at Piha Beach. I had just passed a lookout spot, so I was travelling fairly slowly through that & just picking up speed again as I climbed the hill. There's a bit of traffic on this road & they often cross the centre line, so I was riding fairly central in the lane as it wound left (we drive on the left here in NZ) & not going too fast. There was also a lot of shadow on the road, so it's not as well-lit as it looks here.

BAM! Gravel! I'm used to seeing a bit of gravel around the outside edges of corners, but I didn't expect it right in the middle of the lane! I felt my rear wheel skid out & slip left & right. Luckily I was already accelerating as I climbed the hill & that motion stabilised the wobble. I felt a pang in my gut as the adrenaline immediately kicked in, but none of that panic translated to my inputs on the controls. If I had grabbed the brakes, I would certainly have gone down. I actually felt pretty fine afterward too, I didn't get the shakes or anything. Not the closest of calls, but it would have been heartbreaking to havetalayerdown after a whole season of keeping the rubber side on the road.

What did I learn? Accelerating stabilises a rear wheel skid (OK, I knew the theory, but I hadn't really experienced it like that before). When there are a lot of stripey shadows on the road & visibility of road condition is reduced, take it easy. Is there anything else I can learn?

INCOMING CALL
(CALL ENDED)

9:06
Open the door. 

INCOMING CALL. 
(CALL ENDED) 

It’s not like I wasn’t expecting it. I just didn’t think it would happen on a Friday night, after a full day of classes and a shift at the campus coffee shop. 

The summer sun was still scorching my back at 8pm, and I was drenched in sweat. My backpack weighed me down. 

I needed a shower, and standing outside the house, sticky and exhausted, was humiliating.

The door was locked. I tried it three times, tugging at the janky handle. 

Still locked. 

The place was ancient, so I was used to wrestling with the hinge until it finally gave. 

But this time, my key didn’t work. That meant my housemates had changed the locks while I was in class. Impressive, considering their combined brainpower was roughly that of a toddler. 

I knocked, knowing damn well they weren't going to answer. “Open the door,” I said, swallowing a frustrated sob. 

I was tired, and the barricade between me and my bed was boiling my blood. 

I knocked three more times, pressing my face against the door for even a slight relief from the heat. 

The three of them had been scheming to kick me out ever since I called out Hanna for being an entitled brat. She was rich, so of course the others took her side. 

I was the bad guy for bullying “poor, defensive little Hanna,” also a twenty-three-year-old woman so sheltered she didn’t understand criticism. 

I was asked to apologize at breakfast, and I refused. I was expecting at least a fucking notice. “Can we not do this right now?” I said. “I said I'll move out, but I need to get my stuff first, all right?”

I jumped back when I noticed movement through the keyhole. Someone was spying. Adam. I could hear his slightly hitched breaths, a painful attempt at being subtle. I took it back. 

These idiots didn’t even have the combined intelligence of a mushroom. 

I straightened up, my legs wobbling. I had to pull off my backpack to relieve the strain. “How did she do it?”

He surprised me with a laugh. “What?” 

“How did she *buy* you, Adam?” 

Adam’s meek response was almost funny. I would have laughed, if my world wasn't crumbling around me. 

His accent was the cherry on the top of the irony. Adam was so painfully British, he was the embodiment of the *polite* stereotype. 

“I’m not allowed to open the door,” he said, “I'm sorry, Cady.”

“What did she promise you?” I demanded, squinting through the keyhole. Adam’s dull grey eyes blinked back at me. 

He’d shown up last night with a chocolate cupcake and a confession: 

“Hanna’s fucking crazy, and we’re getting out of here.” He’d announced, eating half the cake, before leaving with a grin. 

Adam was like rainfall after blistering heat. I felt safe and *sane* with him around, despite Hanna’s attempt to push me into a corner. 

The only thing that could’ve changed his mind was either brutal brainwashing, which wouldn't surprise me, or cash.

Adam was always teetering on the edge of broke, and Hanna knew that. 

Which stung worse than being locked out. My supposed best friend had traded me in for filthy money. “Did she pay your tuition?” 

My voice was trembling. I didn't want to break— but Adam made it hard. 

“She must’ve bought you,” I whispered, losing control of my voice. “You said she was *crazy*,” I blurted, “You said we were going to get away from her, so what changed?”

There was a pause, followed by more shuffling footsteps. Hissing sounds. He definitely wasn’t alone. 

“I didn’t say she was crazy,” Adam said, as if she were breathing down his neck. I could sense her wandering hands playing with him, creeping across his mouth in case he blurted something against her. 

“Just stay away for one night, and I’ll talk to her, and maybe…” 

He trailed off, his voice shuddering. “I don’t know, Cady, maybe you guys can talk it out and apologize to her.”

I couldn’t resist a laugh, sinking into a pathetic crouch and pressing my forehead against rough pinewood. 

Through the blur, I could make out the brown mop of Adam’s hair. “You’re not answering my question.” I said. “Tell me how she brainwashed you.”

Adam didn't respond for a moment. I could sense him leaning against the door. 

The sound of his shuffling footsteps lodged my breath in my throat. 

Adam was a textbook college jock, practically a trope. 

Handsome, maybe a bit of a dick, and completely unaware of the world around him, despite Ivy league level intelligence. 

I was still convinced he was possessed by a smartass. 

He was probably running his hands through his hair, which was a habit of his. 

As if he could sense me watching him, he returned to heavy-breathing down the keyhole. “Well, we just, I don't know, we talked, and certain things happened—”

I suddenly had the overwhelming urge to slam my head against the door. “You're not serious.”

“She likes me, Cady.”

“She *likes* that she can control you.” 

Adam was smart. Top of his classes in high school, and in pre-med. I thought he was better than the default caveman brain. 

I didn’t stop to think. I saw red, pounding my fists against the door. 

I was too tired to care about making a scene. “I need to get my things.” 

I was far too aware of passersby. 

Hanna wanted to live in the city, which meant our lives were never private. She chose a high-end detached house on the north side. 

Pretty to look at, with large blue wooden doors and steps lined with silver railings. 

Which meant my mental breakdown was now on full display for every stranger walking by. 

I knocked again, jiggling the handle, trying to be polite. 

Trying not to look crazy. “At least open the door so we can actually *talk*.”

“Bye, Cady,” Adam said, voice hesitant. “Don’t come back.”

His words felt like needles down my spine.

“Is that you talking,” I asked, “or her?”

I held onto his hesitation, before he shattered it. “Me.” 

I let out a dry laugh. “So she’s not whispering in your ear right now, Adam?”

“Go away, Cady.” Hanna’s voice cut through the air, cold and flat. “Adam doesn’t want to talk to you.” I could hear the smug grin behind her words. 

“You actually make him super uncomfortable. Adam’s too nice, so I'm going to say it for him,” Hanna raised her voice. “He's never going to fuck you. You're pathetic.”

I grabbed my backpack, my hands shaking. We had a moment a few weeks back. I was drunk. I thought he kissed me back. But he'd been silent ever since, avoiding talking about it. 

Adam had always said he was bi, preferring guys. I kissed him and made him uncomfortable, and Hanna was there to pick up the pieces (use it to her advantage). She was a natural at psychological warfare, after all. 

My cheeks burned. But I wasn't leaving without my pride. 

“I'll go,” I said, my voice shuddering. “I'll also be calling campus security.”

I didn’t wait for their answer. I walked away.

“Cady, *wait*.”

Adam’s voice hit me when I reached the bottom of the steps. 

I ignored him. 

It took me five steps to delete his number. Six steps to block Hanna on everything. Ten steps to drop my fucking phone and crack the screen. 

I had nowhere to go, so a coffee shop was my only bet. It was the 24-hour one I used for pick-me-ups during exam season. The place was cozy. 

I walked straight into the air-con, which blasted the heat from my skin. Tables and chairs were arranged in a flower formation, fairy lights strung across bright yellow walls. Very millennial. 

I ordered a latte, pulled out my broken phone, and downloaded Craigslist, slumping into a bound leather chair. 

I just needed somewhere to stay for the night. 

Adam called while I was mindlessly scrolling.

“You know I didn't mean any of that,” his voice crackled through the speaker.

“I don't want to talk to you,” I said. “I'm looking for somewhere to stay.” I swallowed burning words tangling my tongue. “I didn’t mean to kiss you, and if I’d known it made you uncomfortable—”

“That doesn't matter,” he said in a hiss. But his tone said otherwise. I had hurt him. Hanna was right about at least one thing.

“Where are you staying? Look, Cady—”

I cut him off, tipping my head back, arching my neck. “I'm looking for somewhere.”

He paused. “Okay. Just stay safe. I'll call you, okay?”

“Do you like her?” I asked, before I could bite back the words.

Adam sighed. “You know I don't like her. She's using me to fuck with you, and I'm using her for cash, and she knows that.” 

He lowered his voice. “That's why she's keeping me hostage, snorting coke in my room.” I could hear him in the kitchen, clanging around. 

“I'll talk her into letting you back in,” he said. “But stay away for tonight, all right? She just wants attention, we both know that. But you've got to work with me too, okay?”

I lowered my voice into a hiss. “You do realize that's illegal, right?”

“Cady, I’m fine.” Adam groaned. “I'll call you later, all right?”

“Iced latte?” one of the barista’s called out my order. 

I ended the call and reached for my drink on the counter, unaware that someone else was reaching for it too.

He was tall, towering over me, with a mop of dark blonde curls and freckles speckling his cheeks. 

He looked strangely sophisticated, considering his inside-out tee, the jacket slung over it, and the vape dangling from his grinning mouth. 

The moment I grabbed the coffee, he pulled his hand back. Instead of apologizing, he whipped the vape from his lips, his grin widening.

“Sorry, but I couldn’t help overhearing you’re looking for a place to stay?” he said, his voice slightly muffled through the vape.

When I didn’t answer, he gave a casual wave and pocketed the vape. “I’m Kai,” he said, bowing, like he was onstage. 

Theatre kid was my first thought. 

He leaned against the counter with a wide smile, and I wondered how many times he'd made this speech. 

“I live with my friends. We’re an odd bunch, but the house is cosy. One of them is an a borderline psychopath, and the other is frothing for a female housemate to combat *testosterone levels*,” he said, air-quoting with an eye roll. “But we’re basically a family!”

This guy sounded like a walking commercial. 

I studied him, drinking all of him in. He was blinking, so definitely not an android. 

Unless ChatGPT could possess people. 

I found my voice, sipping my latte. I felt weirdly  confident, copying his lean-against-the-table strat. 

“I'm curious,” I said, “How many times have you said that today?”

Behind me, two teenage boys talking loudly, went silent. 

Kai’s expression crumpled, before he laughed. 

“Fuck,” he groaned, nearly toppling off his chair. His facade cracked, and thank god it did. Gone was the suave, the sophistication. Hello, chronic klutz. 

His shoulders drooped. 

“Was it that obvious?” he chuckled, pulling out his phone and showing me his script on the Notes app, a single paragraph full of typos, looking more like the start of a story than a pitch.

“Twenty-three *times*,” he hissed, shoving the phone back into his pocket. His accent change was jarring. 

Australian. 

This guy was close to breaking point. 

That wide grin was a cry for help. 

“It would’ve been twenty-four, but this guy cut me off and walked away. The people in this store are ignorant.""

He held up the vape. “This is a prop! It doesn’t even work, and do you think I want to fake an American accent?” 

He rolled his eyes, took a fake drag, and blew out fake smoke.

“It’s like I’m invisible! Everyone, and I mean everyone,” he said loudly, “Yes, I’m talking about you, Jake,” he added, twisting to point at a barista mid-order. 

“Even those guys are ignoring me.”

“I can't imagine why,” I said, unable to resist a laugh. 

Kai smirked. “Glad to know I have supporters,” he said with a wink. “Anyway, if you’re serious about finding a room, we’ve got a spare.” 

His eyes flicked to my phone, and I caught the slight curl of his lip. 

He averted his gaze. Kai had overheard the whole conversation. 

“You can stay tonight. If my friends don’t scare you off, the room’s yours.” He held up his phone, and I copied the address. 

“No pressure,” he added. “The door’ll be open all night, so just come on in whenever you want.”

I nodded slowly. The offer was tempting, and it was only for one night.

“Thanks,” I said. “I’m Cady.”

Kai smiled wide. “Sup, Cady! Nice to meet cha!” He gave me a two-finger salute. 

“See ya tonight?”

I paid for my coffee, finding myself staring into the barista’s wide eyes. 

His expression was somewhere between disgusted, and maybe a little curious. 

I handed over the cash, and he snatched it quickly, stuffing it into the register. “Enjoy!” he said, then called, “Next!” before I could reach for a tip. 

I opened my mouth to offer one, but he cut me off, with a panicked laugh. 

“I’m *good!*""

I twisted back to Kai to say, “See? You’re not the only one being ignored.”

But he was gone. I was staring at empty air. 

The two boys were still laughing, one of them mocking my voice. 

*“I’m Cady!”* He mimicked me. But they weren’t the only ones watching. The other patrons had gone quiet. 

When I moved to the door, the people queuing were quick to back away, like I was contagious. 

Maybe Kai was universally hated. 

Their judgmental stares burned into my back as I left the shop quickly, a sour taste rising in my mouth.

Kai hadn’t left a contact number, and his directions were a mess.

I started walking north toward the center of town before realizing he meant the other direction. My phone buzzed as I was crossing the road. 

I pulled it out—UNKNOWN CALLER filled the screen.

*“Cady Isaacs?”* a disembodied voice crackled. *“Do you accept your audition?""*

Something ice cold slithered down my spine. “What?”

*“Do you accept your audition?”* The voice repeated. *“Please do not respond. Your audition will begin when you end the call.”*

“Who is this?” I panted, breaking into an awkward run. The sun was finally setting, offering some relief from the sticky heat. 

“I think you’ve got the wrong number,” I hissed out, shoving my phone in my pocket. I didn’t see the headlights behind me. Didn’t feel the exhaust fumes pricking the back of my neck. 

Maybe it was adrenaline, or the spur of the moment. 

Something cruel, something *heavy* slammed into me, knocking the breath from my lungs. It was so fast. Too fast for pain to strike, or my brain to register 5000 megatones of metal crushing me. 

My body jerked like a puppet on strings. I was weightless. 

Flying, like I was dreaming, and then plunging down, down, down, and hitting the sidewalk with a meaty smack.

I heard the sounds of my bones splintering, my organs exploding on impact.

There was no bright light, no heavenly staircase. 

I wasn't dead. 

Screams crashed over me, loud and piercing. 

*“Stop!”*

*“Someone’s been hit!”*

For a disorienting moment, I lay on my back, staring up at the dimming sky, the sun bleeding behind the clouds. 

The  ice cold breeze grazing my cheeks was a good indicator that I wasn't dead. 

My brain was still inside my skull. My blood was still in my veins. 

It hit me when loud heel clacks sounded across the concrete.

A shadow darted into the road, arms flung out to stop traffic. 

The silhouette bent over me, late setting sun illuminating a face, an identity bleeding into view. 

It was a girl with silvery-white blonde hair tucked behind her ears. 

For a moment, she was just a silhouette, a faceless shadow, before bleeding into a real person. She was ethereal, with wide eyes and scarlet lips parted in a shriek. 

Her expression crumpled. Was she crying? 

“Oh my goodness, are you okay?” she whispered. “I’m so sorry! I should’ve stopped it. I was too slow. I literally saw the car coming, and I completely froze!”

I had no idea why *she* was apologizing. She wasn’t the one who hit me. 

I blinked, crawling out of the road, pulled by her hand. I was fine. 

No broken bones, no concussion. I ducked to grab my phone facedown on the sidewalk.

The screen was shattered. I bit back a hiss. So much for Kai’s directions. 

“Hey, are you sure you're okay?” the girl followed me when I managed to force my shaking legs to walk. 

Somehow, I *was* okay. I was maybe a little shaken, and my knees were grazed, but apart from that, I was in one piece. 

The girl, however, insisted on going to the hospital, prodding me. She stuck to my side, stumbling in her heels.

I noticed her outfit: jeans and a tee, a long white knitted cardigan wrapped around her.  

“What's your name?” she stuck to my side, jumping ahead of me. 

“Cady,” I bit back a frustrated hiss, tapping at my dead phone. “I don't suppose you know an Australian called Kai?” I said, with a bitter laugh. 

*“Kai?”* The girl leaned into me, seemingly unaware of boundaries. 

She was startlingly cold, despite the sticky heat. 

The girl straightened up, shooting me a look. “What did that idiot do *this* time?”

I stopped walking. “You know him?” I couldn't resist an incredulous laugh. 

The girl rolled her eyes. “Unfortunately,” she muttered. “Bound by blood relation.”

“Sister?” I asked, manically stabbing my phone screen. 

“Cousin,” the girl corrected. “Kai lives with me, and my other cousin, who’s practically a recluse.” 

She skipped ahead of me, her gaze fixed on cracks in the concrete. 

“Kai’s been trying to lure potential roommates since Nathanial left us.""

She sighed, twisting around and shooting me a grin. “You're my cousin’s newest victim.”

“Victim?”

The girl raised a brow. “Sweetie, *anyone* who interacts with Kai, I consider a victim. I'll show you the house!"" she twisted around, her eyes suddenly wide. 

""Unless you'd rather not? We are *kinda* freaky, so I'd like, *totally* understand.""

I nodded. ""Just for the night.""

She did a twirl, nearly stumbling into the road. I had to pull her back.

This girl had zero awareness around traffic. It's like she didn't even care. 

This girl was as unhinged as her cousin, grabbing my arm and tugging me with her. “Okay! Well, it's nice to meet you  *roomie*,"" she said. ""I'm Sabrina!""

""Like the witch?"" I managed to say, more of a joke. 

I pretended not to notice her expression darken. 

She wore that exact same theatrical beam as Kai. 

Sabrina reminded me of a doll. 

With a slightly inclined head, her smile widened. ""Sure!"" 

Being so close to her, Sabrina's eyes were far too hollow to match her eerie smile. 

Like staring directly into oblivion itself. Twin stars of *nothing*. 

Her grip tightened on my wrist. 

“Follow me."" she laughed, but I had no idea what she was laughing *at*. 

Sabrina ran ahead of me, and I could have sworn she was blurring in and out of view, getting further and further away.

We used to all do everything together. I've been there for them through a lot of major events. They're both also super devout Christian but I am not. Despite our religious differences, we did everything together. 

About a year ago I noticed we drifted. They stopped sending messages in our group chat and any time we would get together, which was very seldom, there'd be hints that they message back and forth without me .. which is fine I'm not saying that two friends can't do that, but neither of them really ever messaged me individually and I would always end up feeling like a third wheel. 

Everything came to a head when they both messaged the group chat to get together for coffee. I was excited. Little did I know, this get together was essentially a shaming session. They didn't like how I ""changed"" and named everything in the book i ever did ""wrong"" which consisted of moving in with my boyfriend before marriage, wearing skirts that were too short (I lost weight over the years and i have been feeling better about showing a little more skin. I used to wear pants and baggy t shirts in the summer), and canceling on plans (i did this one time when I was sick and I can't tell you the countless times they've been flaky at the last minute. For example, my halloween party. The one girl is sensitive to certain ingredients so I made/bought food special for her. They were both coming together in the same car but decided to go to the store on their way and were 2 HOURS LATE. Then the girl with food sensitivities said she didnt want to eat the food i special prepared because it would probably be gross from sitting out. 

The ""hang out"" ended with them telling me they'll always be my friend but in order to support me I need to accept christ in my heart. 

I also was not invited to the one girls wedding. Even though she used me as a sounding board for ideas for her wedding. At the time I didn't know I wouldn't be invited so I offered my ideas and even helped with wedding related things. 

I finally blocked both their asses and now they've both been repeatedly calling and texting me saying they are so hurt i would just cut them off like that.

I have zero things to compare our abilities to. All I know is that I can 100% do this from time to time, willingly. In my opinion, that doesn’t make me rare in this community. It just makes me another member of our ever growing community of those that are waking up to this ability. I’m no more special than you or the next person.

Recently, I’ve been seeing an influx of people talking about “blocked” AP experiences. I’ve seen people seeking clarification for sober and drug-induced experiences. I also see a lot of people in the comments seeming to take a firm stance. A large population of our community has been focused so much on the “sober” perspective, that I wanted to speak out and see if anyone else agrees with MY perspective:

Firstly: Bob Monroe, a father to many of us, smoked cigarettes. So did a lot of people back then. It was a cultural norm and they didn’t know as much then as we do now about nicotine. Additionally, I’ve read in his books and others about people having coffee with him.

Secondary: DMT. While I’ve never done DMT myself, the number of experiencers while on this drug can NOT be ignored if we take this seriously. We need to admit that there is obviously (at least) a minimal connection there somewhere.

——

So what I want to tell the community, is to stop taking this so seriously. Honestly. That’s a huuuuuuge unspoken hurdle. I hate that I never see anyone mention it.

My AP experiences began to increase when I finally told myself to simply just be comfortable with myself, and to have good intentions. I’ve AP’d while sober… and I’ve done it while hungover. Trust the process, y’all. ",2,1751844897.0,AstralProjection,0,0.75,False

Nostalgia lives vividly through our veins, like an infinite collection of moments that never leaves us. Like a warmth, caring, kind embrace of a mum or the bright laugh of siblings. It’s a  quiet assembly of nights where luck interlinked our souls. The smell of fresh coffee in the kitchen in the mornings. And suddenly your mum is still awake, early, with old french varieties for company. The cracks of old paintings of the building where your inner child had her fingers crossed by a multitude of different coloured pencils. A sincere smile from a total stranger to the little worlds that your sister and you, created. Our minds are designed by the beauty we search to see in every corner of every universe. 
We are an unbreakable mix of a million faces who make us fall in love with life.

So grab your tits and bits, Reddit, and buckle yourselves in for a wild and bumpy ride! Please keep your hands and feet inside the vehicle at all times!

So I (28F) have been married to ""Jake"" (fake name) (30M) for 6 years. We're your typical lower-middle class suburban couple—two cats and our adopted Himalayan whistle kid. We both work low-paying service jobs. We're not stupid, just tired.  Tired of life, tired of the whistle kid, tired of each other. Marriage got boring. Affection turned into routine. Jake said my tits had become too floppy. I said the same thing to him about his dick. Sex turned into silence. Fall turned into winter. Parenting became unbearable. I wanted more. I needed more. I need some strange. So I started cheating.

Now, here's the thing — Jake (30M) (fake name) (my husband) did too!

Only…but we didn’t know it at first. Here’s where it spirals like things that spiral. 

So I met ""Chris"" (fake name) (32M) on a late shift at my diner. He came in every Thursday night, always alone, always reading something dense—philosophy or current politics or horror or whatever made him look brooding and tortured like a French playwright.  He had this way of asking for more coffee like he was whispering sexy secrets. It felt like he was making love to my soul. I wanted him to make love to a few areas on my body too. 

So get this — one night, after a horrible fight with Jake over a broken toilet and his refusal to unclog it, I followed Chris outside on my break. We talked. We smoked. We... ""kissed"".  We took a trip through the devil's playground, if ya get my drift (We fucked). We spiraled and spun, spiraled and spun like the tea cup ride at Disneyland. 

Not long after, I inadvertently discovered (through an inadvertently thorough search of his phone) that Jake had started sleeping with some whore named ""Melinda"" (fake name) (29F) (probably not an actual whore). They met at the hardware store where he works. She bought a wrench. She didn’t know what to do with it. He made a dumb joke about torque and tension that made her giggle like an idiot. Apparently he found that hot.

He (Jake) (fake name) (my husband) (30M) started going out on “late inventory nights"" at the hardware store. Every night. I never asked. I didn’t care. Because I was ""meeting a friend for drinks"" (read: me bent over a cheap motel dresser with Chris whispering Nietzsche in my ear while doing me in my rear). 

Here’s where the karmic twist comes in,  like a wrecking ball made of molten lava spewing out of God's green earth. 

So, last Saturday I decided to surprise Chris. He mentioned he was doing a “writing retreat” at a downtown hotel. I knew the place—classic, seedy, its walls and furniture stuffed to the seams, nearly bursting with the kind of secrets you'd never tell your kids or therapist about. 

I put on my red lipstick (the one Jake always hated), and ordered a Lyft. My  plan was to knock on Chris's door wearing nothing but a trench coat and a saucy red grin. 

I knocked. 

A woman answered.

A hot woman. 

A skinny hot woman with huge, pendulous knockers fighting for dominance inside her bra. 

It was Melinda. Chris's wife. 

I froze. She froze. We stared. We unfroze. My coat fell open slightly. She blinked and stared.  We froze together. My jaw dropped to my knees and my eyes bugged out of their sockets like an overreacting cartoon character. Melinda had a tight, bitter grin and her eyes glittered wearily with curiosity and contempt as they shot daggers into my soul. She took a sharp breath. Her chest heaved like a sailboat in a spiraling storm. 

She looked at me with a mixture of fear, shame and lust pouring out of her face like dry brownie batter and said the most terrifying sentence I’ve ever heard:

“You must be Jake’s wife.""

I was so taken aback by this and yelped like a fox. I was mesmerized by her prescience and by her décolletage. I froze. She laughed manically. 

We went inside. Chris was shirtless on the floor. Jake was pantsless with his phone on the nightstand. There was only one bed. 

I was taken aback. It didn't make sense. 

Like a midget at a urinal, I needed to keep on my toes. 

Like a nervous virgin going in fast and dry, reality quickly rushed back in and smacked me in the tits. 

I calmly asked what in Jesus H. Fuck was going on. 

Then we all screamed. We all cried. We all felt the gravity of the situation. Some of us froze.  Melinda threw a wine glass. Chris sat on the floor in some kind of existential fugue. Jake punched a lamp. I calmly demanded to know how long things had been going on. Melinda said three months, then she grinned and kicked me in the twat. I wanted to kiss her hot lying mouth. Chris whined about “being emotionally dead inside"" or some stupid shit so I calmly threw him down onto the floor, spit in his stupid face and called him a coward.  Jake tried to hug me but I punched him in the dick. Then I calmly cried in the hallway until the janitor made me move so he could finish vacuuming. 

Now it’s been four days. Jake moved out. Chris keeps texting me like this is some kind of indie film with a bad 80s soundtrack. Melinda deleted all social media and hasn't been seen or heard from since. My family and friends have been blowing up my phone with insults.  As for me, I'm sleeping on the couch now. The cats eye me with pity and disdain. 

So, Reddit, I need your help figuring out what to do next. Should Jake and I try to get back together, or should I shack up with Chris instead? 

Should we even bother trying to find Melinda or should we assume she's gone, never to return? 

There’s no happy ending here, Reddit. No silver lining. Just silent, judgmental looks from my cats and Netflix autoplay.

I just needed to scream into the void. Thanks, Reddit.

**Update**

Update because y'all keep blowing up my inbox with the same stupid fucking questions, so shut up and actually read this before DMing me, mmmkay? I’m gonna explain how the dots connected in a way makes perfect sense, even though this whole situation feels like it was written by a crazy cat lady on her fourth glass of boxed Chardonnay. 

Buckle up. 

**How did I *actually* know Melinda?**

Okay. So the thing is—I sort of knew of ""Melinda"" before all this. Not, like, in a friend way. More like in a ""I saw her once in a Facebook neighborhood group complaining about the raccoons in her attic"" kind of way. We live in a tiny town. Everyone’s name has floated past you at some point, usually attached to a yard sale post or a weird community drama thread.

And here’s where it gets... aggressively coincidental.

Back in early spring, I remember scrolling through the group and seeing this woman —""Melinda R."" (F29) (fake name)—post a very frantic and borderline unhinged rant about how she had ""no idea how tools worked"" and just wanted “someone to tell her if a crescent wrench is edible or not” (her words, not mine). I calmly laughed. I even screenshot it and sent it to Jake. And like a cheap, overcooked  steak from the Sizzler, his reply is seared into my brain: 

 “Haha. Probably some ditzy, fake-titted wine mom with a broken doorbell. Is she hot?""

Fast forward a few days: Jake comes home with this smug little half-smile and says, “ I taught a customer how to use a wrench today. She looked at it like it was an alien probe or maybe a shish kabob.”  I asked if he was talking about that ""Melinda"" chick from Facebook and he didn't even blink! He just said “nah, not her” and changed the subject to how our toilet seat squeaks like a dying bat.


**So why did Melinda buy a wrench if she didn’t know how to use one?**

How the hell should I know? Why don't you ask **her** instead? Jesus H. Christ at the Cracker Barrel, you fucks. I don't know every single fucking detail. Research it yourself if you're so gung-fucking-ho about stupid details, ya turds. 

**But wait—how did we recognize each other instantly at the hotel, if we weren’t actual acquaintances?***

Okay. Picture this.

I knocked on the hotel room door. It opened. And holy shit guys, it's her—Melinda! I’d never met her, but I instantly recognized her. 

And then — I saw her wrist tattoo.

It was a tiny raccoon holding a wrench.

It suddenly hit me at once, like an anvil that somehow fell on your head with a wacky, brain-clearing metallic thump. 

Raccoon attic lady. Crescent wrench eating lady. Jake’s “hot crescent wrench eating idiot"". 

I gasped calmly as I realized she'd been fucking 'Jake"" (fake name) (30M) (my husband) almost as long as ""Chris"" (32M) (fake name) (her husband) and I (Ratleen) (fake name) (28F) had been fucking!

My jaw dropped to the floor. It was like a fourth wall had shattered for some reason, rawly exposing us as mere actors on life's grand stage, suffering under the hot stage lighting that now binds us together for eternity in its harsh, unforgiving glare. 

We didn’t need to have met before to know each other! The breadcrumbs were there all along. We just needed to find them.

Fate, Facebook, a crescent wrench and a raccoon tattoo.

I have yet to make my own espresso at home due to some dilemma.. 

I just recently purchased a Breville Bambino Plus +  Shardor Anti-Static Burr Coffee Grinder(not sure if I'll get demolished here for initially buying this one..), and a Kingrinder K6 on the way as my first setup. 

Just recently found out that this rabbit hole branches into further rabbit holes, specifically with the water we use for the espresso machines..

I am in Angus, near around Barrie, Ontario where we seem to have hard water, is it really bad to use tap water as first cycle and for regular use making espresso with my Bambino? 

I've read some posts that Brita filters do nothing to soften the water and most use RO filtration system for their water and remineralize them again to avoid corrosion of the machine over time? 

Is it really worth doing all that than just having my descaling maintenance more frequently by just using hard tap water?

Thank you so much in advance!

So my older brother moved in with me and my mom after getting kicked out by my grandmother. The thing is he went to the hospital saying he was going to commit *.  They took to a mental facility. He was there for a few days, but he blames my mom and said she made him go there.

He has no money or a job. He has never been able to hold a job. My mom has paid his bills and rent over the years, but he tries to deny it and say he paid everything.

Before him coming here we had a fully stocked house on food and had leftovers for days. With him here he won't stop eating. He eating everything and then gets upset there nothing in the cabinets because he ate it all. He also goes through 3 to 6 cups of coffee a day. Big things of coffee creamer that previously last us 2 to 3 weeks are gone withing 2 to 4 days now.

He also smokes like a lot. My mom number 1 rule for him to live here was no smoking in the house, he broke it recently. Then said something along the lines of ""don't talk to me I'm upset"", when we told him not to. He got this big bag of nictone I believe where he roll it himself I don't really know what it is. He gets it everywhere on the floor. We have cats and don't want them licking it but he won't clean it up. This means I am having go in behind him to get it all off the floor before the cats get to it.

Another thing is he also vapes. Since he has no money or a job he can't afford a new one and neither can my mom. She told him to make it last and he got really mad. Started screaming and saying things like how am I supposed to quite and that she gonna have to buy him more.

He also like to make comments or do small things that he knows will make us mad. Recently I was looking for one of the cats and asked if he saw the cat. He looked at me and said he's dead. I was like what and thankfully my cat was still alive, but genuinely why would he say that. Next few days after that he keeps saying the cats are dead even though they weren't. I got mad and told him to stop and he started to get upset and crying. He legit said ""oh so now I can't make jokes because ur to sensitive"". I lost 3 animals this year within 3 months I didn't find those jokes funny at all.

During the whole cat thing he would also wait until I go to the bathroom and knock on the door and tell to hurry up because he had to use it. There are 2 other bathroom that he could use. When I could come out he would either be watching TV or outside and he wouldn't go to the bathroom at all for a few hours. I thought I was going insane and asked my sister if he was doing this to me on purpose and she thinks he was. 

Edit: forgot to ask aitah for not wanting him to live with us. My mom feels guilty because he'll have nowhere else to go, but he makes her so stressed ",2,1751843983.0,AITAH,6,0.67,False

Dear [Agent],

I’m excited to share my contemporary magical realism novel, Cafe, complete at 98,000 words.

Fred Something, an apathetic loner, can speak with his dog and has an unhealthy relationship with his shadow. Desperate to straighten himself out after a recent divorce, Fred searches for an identity in a Yankees baseball cap, attempting to blend in with the streets of New York City—a home he’s never truly understood. When getting a coffee in an East Village cafe, his cap becomes the center of a deal with an enigmatic stranger who has no name. The nameless man sells Fred on the premise that he can help straighten him out. Since Fred’s unconvinced anything could help him and his shadow, he agrees to the bargain based on the stranger’s charismatic nature. Shortly after, he finds himself experiencing sporadic mental psychoses and objects slowly disappearing from his apartment.

What Fred didn’t realize is that the nameless man was a prisoner to a metaphysical reality, and Fred provided the substance he needed to come into the psychical world. When the cafe’s barman, Angus (the narrator), discovers the nameless man’s escape, he becomes threatened to find a way to return the man before he is damned further by the cafe’s owner. As Angus cannot exist anywhere outside the cafe, he must rely on the Owner’s daughter, Angelica, to restore the balance that Fred has broken.

As the nameless man slowly gnaws away at Fred’s psyche, he finds he is not the first to have entered Fred’s dreams. The deterrent of Fred’s former marriage—his ex father in law and billionaire real estate mogul, Mr. Angst—remains lost within Fred’s mind, slowly losing himself after Fred detached from the hold Mr. Angst had on him during his marriage.

Over the course of a week, Fred must navigate getting pulled in multiple directions while attempting to remain sane through it all. From tripping on psychedelic lasagna, to confronting suicidal clowns on the subway, only Fred’s little dog, Leopold, has any desire to lead him to what he really needs: finding identity in himself. Fred may find balance, at the cost of traversing a dreamlike, kafkaesque landscape, which is hard to tell if he was ever awake for. Cafe is a meditation on the subconscious, the hidden realities that underlie the everyday, and the modern struggle of identity. It is an unpredictable fever dream that will appeal to the fans of both Gareth Brown’s The Book of Doors and its capacity of unravelling secrets, while depicting the mysterious city mood of Haruki Murakami’s The City and its Uncertain Walls.

I am a first time author who works as an IT Administrator by day, and, like Fred Something, continually works on my own relationship with my shadow.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

It was during a time of a huge project (we have our own business with an office in our house). When my husband had to wake me up, he would sit down next to me, put his hand on my hip, and start talking to me (usually telling me my morning coffee was on my bedside table) to wake me up. I am quite a light sleeper, so it is very easy to wake me. I definitely felt that somebody was sitting down next to me, half awake, and I was waiting for my husband to tell me my coffee was on my bedside table. After a while (it could have been seconds or minutes, I really don’t know), I stretched out my hand and turned on my nightlight. My husband was asleep next to me, and our dog was asleep in his bed. I didn’t feel threatened or anything, just confused.  I thought it was a dream, so I put it out of my mind. A few weeks later my husband said he was exhausted, and he was going to take a powernap in our living room. I was pulling an all-nighter and just put my headphones on and continued working. After some time he came up to me, touching my shoulder and asked if I was okay. I said “yes, why?” and he replied that he felt me sitting down next to him on the couch. I said I hadn’t moved out of the office, and we were the only people in the house and office at that time. He just said it was weird, he didn’t feel scared or anything, he really thought it was me.

1ltey2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/OliveMUA/comments/1ltey2p/searching_for_a_pink_lipstick/,Searching for a pink lipstick,"Hi all. I suspect I'm a cool olive, given how difficult it has been to find a lipstick that doesn't pull purple or brown-red. I'm alright with some of the lipsticks that have worked, but they're still pulling browner or mauver than I'm looking for. I'm trying to find a pink that is fresh pink (without purple hints) like [this](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS-J48DO5UauHm8oaYoZCqhM-9nFKJIiDq9Gw&s) and more neutral pink (for me) like [here](https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/68026001fda9af45bcec2f0f/16:9/w_1920,c_limit/2209359070).

For reference, here are some ~stats:

My foundation/concealer shades: NYX Bare Concealer in Beige, Armani Luminous Silk in 5.25 (a touch too dark swatched, blends out nicer, the undertone is close to a perfect match compared to the shades one step below/above). My overall coloring for hair/eyes/skin is similar to [Selena here](https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Selena-Gomez-2020-billboard-1548-1629389624.jpg) and [Leah here](https://people.com/thmb/3Rm-Bxn50VOkuvRfedfdRMZ29aE=/750x0/filters:no_upscale\(\):max_bytes\(150000\):strip_icc\(\):focal\(722x320:724x322\):format\(webp\)/Miguel-Harichi-Leah-Kateb-AVA-Resort-Cancun-111524--839baa95ae364af8850c5c8c7e9c4a0b.jpg). 

A sampling of some lipsticks I've tried or regularly wear (shades lighter than these are clown-like pink on me):

- MAC Fairplay - a nice mauve with one thin layer, pulls purple-brown with another layer. Creme in Your Coffee is a little more forgiving. 

- MAC Mehr, Syrup, Brave, Creme Cup - the pinks I'd love to wear, but looks [chalky and dusty on my lips](https://senseiteve.com//wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MAC-Mehr-Swatch-FOTD.jpg). The woman looks great here, the shades pull exactly like that on me but the white base shines through so it looks clowny against my undertones. 

- MAC Taupe - it's like the gray is sucked away, pulling as a [reddish brick tone](https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/A-U8NP5s6TGSv6ZK-sNFZjF3I94=/750x0/filters:no_upscale\(\):max_bytes\(150000\):strip_icc\(\):format\(webp\)/ScreenShot2021-09-18at12.44.06PM-2ace4200be3f42aaac0a78a8439c2a8b.jpg) 

- MAC Velvet Teddy - another dud, it was straight up brown on me

- CT Pillow Talk Medium - close to a MLBB when applied thinly, has a tendency to pull burgundy

- Mario Dumbo - this was an impulsive pick, it's like a pinky-brown with a hint of terracotta, somehow one of the most flattering lipsticks on me. I don't wear terracotta/coral/orange-based blushes since they pull so strongly orange on my skin, so this was surprising.

- Bobbie Brown Italian Rose - a pretty soft pink that actually shows up as in the realm of pink, again I suspect the terracotta/coral tinge helps?

- Bobbie Brown Blue Raspberry - my perfect MLBB

- Revlon Mauvy Night - saw this commonly recommended, but it's straight up a dark purple on me, much like MAC Amorous 

- NYX Lip IV in Hydra Honey - goes on a dark brown, the tint is an unflattering brighter pink

Blushes that look the best on me. Strongly warm blushes look like a rash, so these are on the cooler end:

- Purples and lilacs pull the perfect natural cold flush, my skin looks insanely bright and even with these -- UD's Bittersweet, Lorac's Ultraviolet, Clinique Pansy Pop, Nars Behave, Nars Impassioned

- Pinks -- MAC's Blushbaby, MAC Mocha, Bobbi Brown Nectar, Hourglass Sublime Flush (if I could marry a blush, it'd be this one), Nars Deep Throat, Nars Amour

- These ones are a mix of darker pinks/mauves/plums give that cute slightly sunburnt, naturally flushed from exertion look -- MAC Burnt Pepper (this one was surprising, as it's warmer than anything else I wear), MAC Desert Rose, Nars Dolce Vita, Nars Out There, Hourglass Mood Exposure, Clinque Fig Pop  

Based on that, it seems like pinks are notoriously hard to find. If this makes sense to anyone else, I'm eager to hear your insight and recommendations, please.

Hindsight *****

She heaved a heavy sigh, staring down at hey keyboard.  It wasn't the dozens of accounts on the screen before her still waiting to be paid out for today, the stale coffee by her wrist, nor was it the nearly seven hours remaining until quitting time. Tonya was just so tired of looking at that DAMN tattoo... and for good reason. It was a hideous thing. A pallette of off-kilter colors all jumbled into a shape that once held great and intimate meaning, but was now just a reminder that our  youthful bodies are inhabited by some completely foreign entities. How - or to where- those entities might fade.. who cares? All she had was today, and today was just another in a long line of regretful days.  Tonya had had enough.  She clicked away from her spreadsheets and began to look into laser removal, fading creams, and flesh colored inks.  
 Nearing the end of the workday,  she'd all but given up on erasing her mistake. Everything was either too expensive or seemed like an outright scam. Defeated, annoyed, and now a full Friday behind on work, she stomped out ""get this fucking ink off of me!!!!"" Into the search bar.  She whacked the return key for the last time this week, and just as she reached to slam her laptop shut, she noticed the ad. ""Instant, complete, PERMANENT ink and color removal"". Tonya sank back into her chair, clicked the link and began to read.

The next week, she found herself sitting in the lobby of a very clean and clinical feeling building.  Spotless nurses in brilliant, glowing white took all of Tonya's information, then her vitals, blood and skin samples, some hair follicles,  a mouth swab, dozens of pictures and measurements of the offending tattoo, and a few other increasingly personal and surprisingly thorough screenings.   She was amazed to have passed and still be qualified for this ""miracle"" treatment, which remained almost a complete mystery to her.  After another few minutes, a very pleasant man in a white lab coat at last floated into her exam room, gushing about how pleased he was to finally meet a good candidate for the trial. He explained that 99% of applicants are rejected based on health history, half of the remaining have too large or too dark of tattoos, and half of THOSE remaining just flat out refuse the procedure. ""You see,"" he continued hesitantly, almost nervously ""it's a breakthrough process in which we basically send nanobots into your skin to attack and destroy ink particles at a microscopic level... long story short, in three days, you won't see any evidence of EVER having a tattoo! It's that simple and it WORKS!""  The man almost looked like he might explode if she didn'tanswer
*I'm just really not sure... *

She couldn't believe it.  It'd barely been 72 hours, but just like the doctor said, Tonya didn't see a single smudge on her skin where thar damn, awful tattoo had sat. She was elated.  Her confidence seemed to spike, she began crushing work assignments with a renewed energy, and soon landed a major account and a promotion to boot!  Her entire life took an upgrade. She bought designer clothes, bags, and shoes.  Oh, and that hot yellow Porsche she's always dreamed about.. she bought that too!  People were so envious of that flawless machine on the road, Tonya could barely get through an intersection without half a dozen people laying on their horns. 
*And all, all of this, she thought, just from removing that damn, ugly tattoo.*
 Life was a rainbow, FINALLY! It was Tonya time.

Three days turned into three months in the blink of her honey-colored eye. Tonya stood in front of her closet, filled with beautiful designer fabrics in every hue.  *But... where's that bright vivid red one?
She stood, frozen, and stared at her clothes.  Everything looked... muted.  She could barely tell the blues from the greens, the purple from the blues, and on and on. In fact, to her horror, it looked as though they were all melting into the same, drab gray.  She turned, and so was the carpet.. the wall, her paintings.. wait.. where ARE the paintings? She saw nothing but that same soulless grey. Everywhere. Tonya ran into the kitchen,  throwing open all of the gray cabinets and flipping through the dozens of gray packages of consumables in her pantry.  She looked across the gray windowsill and saw a gray lawn, gray trees and a cloudless gray sky.  She panicked. After a little searching she found her gray keys against the gray counter top, took her gray Porsche and sped towards the tattoo removal clinic. The gray divider lines were a shade or two away from impossible to see against the gray highway, and with a sickening feeling Tonya realized why people had been honking their horns at her for weeks now. 
*the stop lights*
 She realized she'd been so busy with upgrading her life, she ignored all of the color leaking away from it.  The world had been like this the whole time, ever since that third day after the clinic.  She prayed with all of her might it wasn't too late to fix this.
  As her tires scraped against the gray concrete of the curb, Tonya sobbed. Gray boards covered all the windows, and chains sat across the gray door of what used to be the tattoo removal clinic. The gray buiding was absmally dark, not a breath of life inside. Someone had painted on the wall (in all nearly impossible to see gray letters, of course) GIVE US BACK OUR MISTAKES, GIVE US BACK OUR RAINBOW.

1lteus8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lteus8,Please advise this second bedroom as an entertainment room,"This will serve as an entertainment room if I can figure it out. Every layout feels awkward. The table for TV is temporary, I just can’t buy furniture until I figure the orientation.

First one works, but cramped. Second & third feel more open, but too far from the TV & light coming in has to be dealt with. 

Things I’m looking to add: plants, wall shelves, rug, coffee table, replace bookcase with tall one. Any help is appreciated, thank you!",2,1751843333.0,malelivingspace,0,1.0,False

I use a local coffee shop called empty cup “redeye” for all my pre afternoon crafted drinks and their “running on empty” for drip coffee. Extremely happy with both. But I find their decaf “for the love of coffee” very watery and no crema no matter what settings I use to dial in. Any setting recommendations or is that just what I should expect? Is it worth trying different decaf beans?

Using a Breville Barista Pro. I have my caffeine drinks absolutely dialed.",1,1751843297.0,BrevilleCoffee,5,1.0,False
1ltetyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lumines/comments/1ltetyx/my_opinions_on_the_lumines_remaster_or_the_game_i/,My opinions on the Lumines remaster (or the game I played),"I really like this game. Although it could use a lot more things to make it better, such as:

The puzzles should be easier to do as I completed the mission mode, but of course RODENT is the unlockable for that mode. 45 degrees, I will come for you. 

There should be more skins. Imagine we get the B pack, which consists of:
Circles
Block the sky
Mysterious travel to Asia
Kabuki
Bean jam?
 (if applicable)
T.S.L
Take a coffee for a moment?
KAWAII

The A pack, which has:
Sparks!!
The mission to The moon
Bad boy century
Cuckoo clock
 (if applicable as well)
You are not here.
So that someone may visit you.
tiny piano
Flashback
HIKARU frame work 

The S pack, which includes:
Day dream
Aoi
Shadow of Grand Father
Butterfly Stroke
Hometown
Dao 
BIG THINGS

The VS. CPU pack (which is free):
That savanna calls
Naha!!
The speed of light 
Go to a toy town
Papa's Ukulele 

The Licensed Music pack:
SUGIURUMN - HOUSE 66 
TECHRIDERS - 4X4 BRICKS
Genki Rockets - Heavenly Star
Genki Rockets - Heavenly Star (SOS Remix)
Genki Rockets - Breeze
muku - Cosmic Humming

The Rockin' Holiday pack/winter remixes pack

And the Supernova skins (except for LittleBIGplanet for obvious reasons)

For bonus skins:
Elect MGR
Xop
Fanatic 
Inheritance 
Manager class
MACHINE INTERFACE 
Neodymium (with mental gymnastic taking its current place)

Also, there should be the Sequencer mode

But anyway, I like the music and gameplay. I will be sure to get Arise when it comes to Nintendo Switch 2. What I would like to see next from the Enhance guys is Meteos (the Masahiro Sakurai puzzler) and Gunpey-R (PSP). Then I can be happy.

I will give Lumines Remastered a 9/10. I love it so damn much.",2,1751843268.0,Lumines,5,1.0,False

1lteses,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1lteses/am_i_overreacting_for_fighting_with_my_fiancé/,Am I overreacting for fighting with my fiancé because he made plans without talking with me first?,"I apologise for my English , is not my first language. 
So me(24f) and my fiancé(25m) are currently in holiday in his home country. We already made plans for this summer and one thing we are planning to do is getting engaged. I don’t want to go too much in details but the thing is we need a lot of time for getting engaged because of I’m not from his country I need to go to my country to take some documents and we have only 2 months for this. And after finishing with all of this we are also thinking to have 1 week holiday somewhere in a beach. So till 2 days ago we were planning to go to my country for the documents next weekend but my fiancé  made another plans with his friends. His friends are from work. We do work in the same job. I can say that I know them but I’m not really friends with them. I’m just being nice to them because they are friends with my fiancé and we work in the same place. Otherwise I don’t think will be even hanging out with them because we don’t have nothing in common. We don’t even speak the same language. Me and my fiancé are talking in English and from this 10 friend only 3 of them can talk English. So when we are sitting all together they are always talking in their language and I’m just sitting there looking at my phone. And about activities they are doing I don’t like how they spend their time. Because the group is mostly male they like to drink ,make barbecue and talk about football and stuffs. And girls (we are 3 couples in a group the rest is single and male only ) are just listening them and prepare food and stuffs. I don’t like to be around drunk people because of some trauma from my child hood because of my father. That’s why when they make a plan to meet I go only for short time and go back home or don’t even go there and stay home. So fast forward to 2 days ago while we were drinking coffee outside my fiancé get a call from his friends in a group zoom call. I understand little bit their language so I listen a bit. They was talking about the plan that they made while chatting in the group and they was trying to figure out the date. The plan is after the next weekend to rent a villa in a mountain and stay there with all this friends for 4-5 days. I knew about this plan before , I didn’t hear 2 days ago. 2 months ago or something there was a discussion about this plan but the next day I talk with my fiancé and he assured me that this plan will never gonna happen because apparently every year they make this kind of plans but it never happend. So that’s why when we make our plan for holiday we didn’t include this friend mountain trip. So 2 days ago after he finish the call I asked him what’s happening and he said that they already decided about everything that next weekend we are going to mountain. And I ask why he didn’t not say nothing about this because I am also included in this trip but I don’t know nothing about it and he told me that we talk about it 2 months ago and I should not be angry about this. Then I said to him to have a nice trip that he is going because I don’t want to go. After I said like that we didn’t talk about this conversation till today because he was angry on me that I’m overreacting. Today He just talked with one of  his friend and he learned that his friends girlfriend is also coming. So after he finished the call he start to talk about how will be in the mountains even tough I said that I’m not going 2 days ago. I said to him again that I don’t want to go there and we start to fight again. He said that if I don’t go I will embarrass him and let him alone and his friends will see that as I’m being rude. I also don’t feel like they are real friends to my fiancé and I start to say this kind of stuffs to him about their friendship and about this plan and he got very pissed and told me to mind mine own business and to don’t go in between him and his friends business. After he said like that  I got really sad and started to cry and we didn’t talk yet. Do you guys think am I overreacting about this? What should I do ? Should I go to this trip or not ?
