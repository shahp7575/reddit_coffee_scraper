Think quirky quotes, inside jokes, and some pop culture stuff. It’s been fun — but taking good product photos? Not so fun.

I don’t have a fancy camera. No studio lights. And definitely no budget for a professional photographer. My early pics were just… sad. Shot on my kitchen table with bad lighting and clutter in the background 😅

Then I stumbled on this AI tool called [**MagicShot.ai**](https://www.magicshot.ai). It lets you create *studio-quality product photos* just from a single image. I uploaded a basic pic of my mug, and told it:  
*“On a clean wood table with soft natural lighting, cozy home vibes, aesthetic background.”*

The result? It looked like I hired a lifestyle photographer. And I didn’t stop there — I made a whole set: one in a coffee shop, one by a window with steam coming off a cup, even one styled like a gift box. Total cost? $0. Time spent? Like 2 minutes each.

I replaced all the product images on my Etsy shop with the AI versions… and the next week, my sales literally doubled. People were commenting how “professional” and “gift-worthy” the mugs looked.

Moral of the story? You don’t need a fancy setup to look like you have one. [**MagicShot.ai**](https://www.magicshot.ai) gave my little store a big brand glow-up — and I didn’t touch Photoshop once.

If you're a seller, dropshipper, or creator with zero budget and lots of hustle, definitely give it a try.

1k5j221,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1k5j221/advice_on_low_calorie_drinks_to_have_on_hand/,Advice on low calorie drinks to have on hand?,"So, this post might be a bit niche. I’m planning to go on a weight loss and health journey upon graduating college (in a few weeks). I have a few comorbid conditions which have made it notoriously difficult in the past to lose weight sustainable and healthily. I am on the spectrum, have adhd, and some other general issues with nausea. I can drink all day long, be it water or fun drinks, but sometimes struggle to eat cohesive healthy meals. Even if I meal prep them, sometimes it’s still difficult for me. Especially if I am out late or at work. I’ve considered meal replacement shakes but they’re either not nutritious enough usually or taste absolutely awful. I also drink way too many calories in coffee, but can’t find anything I can keep with me for at work or something. If I’m at work for 8 hours, a cup of coffee before work only lasts me until 11 am usually before I’m craving more caffeine. I really wanna improve my lifestyle but am struggling to find items I can take with me to work that actually taste good and are nutritionally sound. 

I hate anything carbonated or energy drinks, so please don’t suggest those! 

Any advice on drinks to have? And also ways to maybe get good nutrition on those days I’m really not feeling physical food? ",1,1745359714.0,PCOS,0,1.0,False

I'm a guy in my late 20s and met someone (let’s call him C) at my university library. We hit it off quickly — hung out a lot, talked about deep stuff, and he made me feel like I had a safe space. I trusted him enough to share things I don’t tell many people: my rough upbringing, being bullied, past struggles with depression and suicidal ideation. He listened, invited me to his church, introduced me to his social circle, and I thought I'd found a solid friend.

But as time passed, I noticed things getting... off. He and his brother started pushing political conversations, defending Trump, and subtly trying to pull me in their direction. I told them politics made me uncomfortable and tried to draw a boundary. At one point, C asked if I held my views just because of my dad (who's a Democrat). I told him that was a weird question and didn’t want to continue the convo.

Later, I confronted him over text about how dismissive and smug he’d been. I asked for an apology — nothing dramatic, just an acknowledgment. He said he wouldn’t do it over text and insisted we meet. I agreed, even bought him a coffee. But instead of any kind of apology, he went off on me. Said I had low self-worth, accused me of projecting my issues onto him, and even said something like “the devil’s speaking through you.” He tried to force a prayer on me, pushed for a hug (I declined), and just made me feel emotionally bulldozed. That was it for me — I walked away from the friendship.

I stopped attending the church group altogether. Since then, some folks from there have been texting, asking where I’ve been. I’ve just told them school and work are keeping me busy — trying to avoid the drama. C’s brother even unfriended me on LinkedIn, and C acts like nothing ever happened when he sees me — gives me fist bumps and greets me like we’re cool. I go along with it just to keep things from escalating, but honestly, it feels fake and manipulative.

Lately, I’ve been anxious he’s talking behind my back — maybe even sharing some of the personal stuff I told him, trying to spin it to make me seem unstable. I haven’t replied to him or anyone in that circle since January. One of his friends still texts occasionally with stuff like “Let’s catch up soon,” but I just keep saying I’m tied up.

So… AITA for walking away without offering the group an explanation? Part of me feels like I’m finally prioritizing my mental well-being, but another part worries I’ve let him take control of the story.",1,1745359396.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

# Chapter 216 – Not Delivered



Alexander felt the corner of his lips ever so slightly twitch as he hurried through the mansion’s oversized halls. Inwardly, he firmly reminded himself that patience is a virtue. Still, he couldn’t help but feel like now, of all times, really was not the time for games.

When he finally made his way to his destination after crossing what felt like acres of hallway, he stopped in front of the massive door briefly. He lifted his hands, took a deep breath, and then allowed them to slowly sink down along with his gradual exhale. Once his lungs were empty, he ran his hand through his hair to try and bring some order into it.

Then he took a far more moderated breath before opening the massive door with the small remote he had previously been handed so he could even hope to move the darn thing.

As he pressed the button down, his body – out of ingrained habit – already braced for the loud noise the enormous engines would bring with them. However, almost like the feeling of of missing a step while walking up the stairs, the prepared tension ran into nothing for a moment, as the anticipated noise didn’t sound out as he had come to expect.

His aware mind took a moment longer to notice it than the passive control over his body did, and his eyebrow just began to raise in confusion when the door suddenly started to move – the ensuing noise now hitting him twice as hard because his guard had began to lower right as it came.

He jolted back half a step, his right hand instinctively grabbing the pendant around his neck as he felt his heart-rate pick up and a little bit of a surprised tingle spreading into his limbs.

The door’s unexpected behavior didn’t help his already agitated state of mind at all, and so he felt his expression morph into an irritated grimace as he shook off the momentary surprise. With an exasperated sigh directed at both the door and at himself, he took a step towards it to move on from this – only to stop dead in his tracks right as he was about to cross the threshold.

He felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up as he felt a subconscious part of himself push back against the movement. Memories of the cooler’s door slamming down just inches before his feet flashed through his mind, and his eyes inadvertently shot to the tracks in the wall that housed the door’s sturdy, metal plate – following them all the way up to where it currently disappeared into the ceiling.

For a bit, the Guide simply stood there, staring at the dark strip of metal that hid what had to be at least a ton of material away from his view almost right above his head. It was still, and he could feel his heart heavily pounding all the way up into his ears as his eyes briefly lost focus from the strained way they were staring.

Before his eyes, the door ceased to be a door, instead turning into a-

“Guide Paige?” a familiar voice suddenly tor him out of his spiraling thoughts, forcing his gaze to snap forwards into the room, where he found the highly questioning face of Brother Abbott, who had likely been curiously staring at him like that ever since he had opened the door. “Is something the matter?”

The man stood in front of an opened suitcase and held a half-folded blanket in one hand, making it clear that Alexander had interrupted him while he was packing up.

Using the brief jolt to his system as his springboard to pull himself together, Alexander quickly shook his head and, though still hesitant, stepped through the door far swifter than was in any way necessary or reasonable, basically throwing himself across the threshold before catching himself on the other side.

“I received your message,” he replied once he was fully in the room, running his hands over his clothes to smooth them out – only for his eyes to widen as he realized he had just smeared long, red streaks over his white shirt. His gaze shot to his hand, where he saw four thin lines of slowly trickling blood run down his palm where he had seemingly punctured it by grabbing onto his pendant too tightly during his brief daze. It was not an unusual occurrence, but this time, it had seemingly happened without him noticing the damage.

“Wonderful,” he sarcastically muttered with a smack of his lips as he looked down at the mess on his shirt, even though he could do little more than dismiss and live with it for now.

In the meantime, he could see Brother Abbott tilt his head somewhere in his periphery.

“Message?” the friar asked, confused, as he quickly finished folding up the blanket and stuffed it into the open suitcase. “What message?”

Alexander scowled, now even more unamused by the Brother’s games than he had already been, especially since it had now led to him ruining his shirt.

“I am not in the mood, Brother Abbott,” he informed sternly while pulling a tissue from his pocket to try and quell the bleeding of his hand. Still, he tried his best to not lose himself to the temptations of anger, and he even used the pain in his palm to help himself focus. “We are on borrowed time, so please do not try to waste it.”

Abbott now tilted his head to the other side, and – to Alexander’s surprise – there was genuine confusion on the friar’s face. Brother Abbott was certainly an occasional jokester, however a convincing actor he was not.

Whenever he thought he had won one over on you, he was certain to let you know. Which, in turn, gave Alexander pause when that usual, smug expression was nowhere to be found.

Therefore, instead of immediately continuing the conversation, Alexander quickly pulled out his phone, his face scrunching up into a dark pondering as he quickly checked to make sure he hadn’t somehow been horribly mistaken.

Just a few minutes ago, Abbot had urgently texted him that there was something important they had to discuss, and that he could not go into detail via text. When Alexander had in turn responded that that was nonsense and that he should simply get out with it, Abbott had proceeded to ignore those messages and calls – ultimately leading to where they now found themselves.

Now, the Guide felt the breath become briefly stuck in his throat as his eyes found his own messages which had gone ignored earlier – only to now see the bright-red indicator stating ‘Not Delivered’ clearly displayed next to each of them, while the messages themselves had become grayed out. Something that was, most certainly, not the case just a few minutes ago when his agitation at being ignored had reached such a point that he decided to approach Abbott about it in person.

A ringing filled his ears as his finger began to move on its own, absently scrolling up past the dozen-or-so “Undelivered” messages of his that were filling the chat while seeking out the one that had started this all.

Though, although he hadn’t actively decided to search for it, his aware mind still recoiled when he finally found it – so much so that he actually dropped his phone, leaving it to clatter against the ground loudly as the sound echoed through the enormous room.

Obviously noticing the shock on his Guide’s face as he stared down at the fallen device, Brother Abbott quickly pulled his own phone from his pocket, following the logic that Alexander had mentioned a message from him and therefore likely checked the chat-logs between the two of them.

When the friar opened the chat, Alexander knew that he obviously didn’t see any of the undelivered messages he had tried to send him. Instead, from his side of the logs, it would look like the last interaction between them was a message sent from Abbott, that never got an answer from the other side.

Of course, Alexander now knew that Abbott never sent that message, and the confused and slightly disturbed look on the Brother’s face – which was a rarity to see as part of his expressions – confirmed that gut feeling once again.

Even if finding a message that he himself never wrote wasn’t disconcerting enough already, the contents of the message surely amplified the effect tenfold at least. Because, when Abbott checked the chat now to see just what had Alexander so alarmed, he didn’t find the original, vague message of needing to talk to the Guide and not being able to give details over the phone.

No. Instead, the message had been replaced, a small ‘Edited’ signifier next to the now much shorter field of text indicating as much.

Now, the new message was only made up of three short words. Three short words which, however, managed to carry much, **much** more weight than the previous bait-message Alexander had originally received ever could.

“Made you look.”

“Could it just be some kind of residual message that the system spat out once it was rebooted?” Fleet-Admiral Santo asked, having contacted the first – and admittedly most readily available under the current circumstances – expert on the matter of hyperspace-communication systems he could think of immediately after the cryptic message had reached them.

On the screen in front of him, the still somewhat disheveled and very much not-dressed-for-the-occasion image of the Tria Cacumina’s ‘Mind’-Representative, dressed in white silk Pjs and holding a steaming cup of freshly brewed coffee, rubbed her eyes as she tried to wake herself up.

Dr. Zoya Boyko’s chin-length, platinum hair hung with a few strands wildly out of place as she squeezed her eyes shut tight to focus on her current thought.

“No,” she said and, although she seemed tired in every other regard, her voice was firm and clearly sure of what she was saying without room for doubt. “If the message was in the process of being delivered as the hyperspace collapsed, it would’ve simply been lost. And if the message actually reached the satellite before the stretch collapsed, then there is no reason why it wouldn’t have sent it out right away – especially not without any of its usual encryptions. Whoever sent it, and sent it like this, clearly did so purposefully.”

Santo had no reason to doubt her words, especially since the only remote hint of her tiredness that managed to make its way into her manner of speaking was the slightly stronger-than-usual accent that colored her words.

It seemed like someone was either toying with them...or tying to tell them something.

“It’s a dead end. So cramped.”

He thought about those words, even if they seemed like utter nonsense out of context.

A dead end. A dead end? A dead end…

The Fleet-Admiral’s eyes flicked over to a different screen, where constant status-updates from his various troops and informants were constantly coming in to keep him on track of the current situation.

According to the reports, although some issues with things like television and certain net-services reportedly remained, communication had been successfully re-established, and the situation at the galaxy’s core was stable.

A brief report of Avezillion’s – co-signed by both Admiral Krieger and Councilman Aldwin – was attached that detailed a bit of unrest on the Council Station, but nothing they could not handle.

Some of the Officers were therefore hopeful that the defense and re-establishment of communication between the coreworlds and Earth had made whatever play that was planned against them too risky in their attacker’s eyes, buying their people at the core more time to prepare for any eventualities.

However, the Fleet-Admiral stared at the report for a long moment. And the longer he did, the deeper the folds on his forehead became.

With the quick press of a button, he opened communication to Reason.

“Do me a favor and triple-check that message’s source,” he ordered once someone had picked up on the other end. “Especially the palindrome.”

He didn’t wait for a response before he turned his gaze back to the Representative, who was currently stretching to wake the rest of her body up. The fabric of her pajamas strained a bit against her arms, as she had seemingly bought them before gaining a good bit of bulk later on.

“Say, Doctor,” he opened and paused briefly to make sure that he once again had her attention before carrying on with his question. “I personally mostly have contact with it as values on a sensor or numbers on a screen, so forgive me if it is a stupid question,” he explained himself briefly, before shifting his lips and looking at her with his face dipping deeper and deeper into concern. “But...is there a way to tell if a hyperspace-stretch leads into a blind end?”



\--



“But how is it possible that you got completely locked out of that entire communication without even noticing?” James asked loudly in the vague direction of his phone, which laid on the mattress next to him while put on loud-speaker, since both of his arms were too preoccupied to bother with holding it as he spoke.

The things which the other side of the call was hearing right now were likely...interesting to say the least. However, Avezillion seemingly didn’t let that bother her as she replied to his not exactly politely-phrased question right away.

“I wish I could tell you, James,” she explained, her tone far more diplomatic than his was while also carrying a hint of guilt at her own supposed impotence. “It’s not just that I couldn’t reach her or not connect to the system. It was more like...the entire system disappeared somehow. Not just disappeared from my view but...disappeared from my awareness.”

While the Realized gave her explanation, James’ Doctor as well as a nurse were busy pushing against his shoulders with gentle – well, mostly gentle – force as they tried to “highly encourage” him to lie down again - which didn't happen for the first time today.

“Sir, please, you really shouldn’t get up yet,” his Doctor tried to tell him in a calm voice. As she pushed against him, her face carried both professional concern and a hint of surprise, which seemed to stem from her wondering about how he could even put up as much of a fight as he did in his current state. “Please remember, you agreed to remain in bed and recover.”

James grit his teeth and released a huff as he planted his mechanical hand flatly on the bed to help keep himself upright as they pushed against him. His scarred lungs protested against the exertion, but he managed to keep the urge to cough fought down for the moment.

Avezillion had briefly paused her explanation so it wouldn’t get swallowed in the scuffle, but once things turned quiet enough once more, she continued.

“It is...hard to describe and...terrifying, to be entirely honest. Especially since I can only grasp it in hindsight. It is as if the connection to the Admiral simply ceased to exist for me, even while I was actively discussing and trying to connect to it. I was aware of the concept of the connection, but not of its actual existence,” she tried to put what had happened into words. Though, admittedly, it was a bit hard to conceptualize. Then again, it wasn’t like James was in the best situation or state of mind right now to really dig his teeth into the though-experiment it posed. “I suppose the best thing I could compare it to is a momentary loss of object permanence while simultaneously possessing the intelligence to understand the idea of object permanence. I was aware, on some level, that it still had to exist and could therefore discuss it as if it did. But my awareness was stunted to a degree that I could not actually fathom its existence anymore, even if I was conceptually aware of it.”

James briefly tried to push against his caretakers one more time to get to his feet. But, for all his strength, he wasn’t going to overpower two grown adults while his muscles were still waking up from a coma and his lungs were running at highly reduced capacity.

Not quite allowing himself to be brought fully onto his back, he instead fell against his supporting mechanical arm, which quickly shifted in its shape to be a more practical support for his weight.

“That sounds terrifying,” was all the commentary James could offer to the Realized’s explanation while he tried to catch his winded breath.

“The truly terrifying part is that I am only aware of it now that it is over,” Avezillion admitted, her tone speaking of clear discomfort.

While James sat there, breathing heavily as he got to contemplate on the ancient and deep-seated fear humans held towards the idea of false memories and a faulty perception of the world, his Doctor and the nurse carefully pulled their hands away from his shoulder, before the former gave him a very displeased look and imperiously gestured for him to lie down.

“We’ve been over this,” she warned in a firm but still somewhat caring tone. “Do not make me sedate you.”

James sighed and, briefly, thought about bringing up his right to leave the medbay AMA if he wanted to. But, in the end, rational thought did barely win out over his unrelenting need to act – even if he had no real idea what exactly he would do in terms of ‘acting’ exactly.

The station was descending into chaos with many of his friends caught in the middle of it with little chance to escape while who-knew-what kind of unseen force was trying to lock his mother away. And he was here, lying in bed.

But what was he going to do? Go down there and...probably eat shit against the first even half-decent opponent he ran into? With a good possibility that that opponent would be gravity?

Now that would be real useful.

“So,” he therefore said as he slowly lowered himself back onto his back for what wasn’t the first time today but...hopefully would be the last now. “What you’re saying is, you have no idea if the same thing is still happening to you with something else – because you would only notice that it was previously the case if you suddenly became “aware” of it again. Correct?”

“I’m afraid that is the sad reality,” Avezillion confirmed with a glum voice. “And I have no idea how to counteract or mitigate it. Whatever is wrong with me, – if something is still wrong with me - I cannot find the cause. Diagnostics come up empty. A step-by-step reboot of my functions and even a code-overhaul yielded no results. Either I am cured, there is nothing more to find, or any attempts at a remedy failed. The terrifying part is: I have no way of knowing which is the case until it is too late.”

James released a heavy sigh.

“So our last bastion of reality did not hold,” he said quietly, not wanting to make it seem like it was Avezillion’s fault, even if a certain anger bubbling within him most certainly wanted to try and find fault somewhere.

However, what was happening to Avezillion sounded far more scary and even violating than simply being unable to tell who was really calling you on your phone. And he had absolutely no way of even trying to come up with a solution, considering just how little was even known about Realized.

“Just...keep trying, please,” was all he could say in the end while a sudden spell of exhaustion began to take him… only to then immediately shoot up again as a sudden alarm rang out across the ship.



\--



A few minutes earlier…

“Any news from Earth?” Vice-Admiral Kazadi asked his communication Officer, although his own eyes remained glued to the screen showing the drone-footage of the psychopomps in the process of dispersing the crowd that was still threatening the now freed Admiral as well as the soldiers who had been dispatched to rescue her.

Luckily, it seemed that the appearance of truly heavy weaponry on the scene had taken the steam out of the rioters’ defiance, and they began to flee the scene in large numbers before they would possibly have to contend with the nominal death-bringers that were now descending upon them.

Here and there, some of the violent brutes attempted to hurl some of their projectiles up towards the drone, but it became clear quickly that none of them had the necessary aim or strength to come even close to threatening any of the sophisticated weapons.

“No response yet, Sir,” the Officer replied, which was the furthest thing from the news Kazadi wanted to hear at the time. “I am not sure if they are not responding or if our messages aren’t going through.”

The Vice-Admiral hummed deeply, trying to force a neutral expression as he processed that information.

“And Avezillion?” he asked, though he basically already knew the answer.

“Says the connection appears fine to her, but cannot guarantee her confidence in that assessment,” the Officer quickly confirmed exactly what he thought.

Kazadi suppressed a sigh. What was especially getting to him was the irony. Not all that long ago, the mere information that a Realized could be effectively gas-lit would’ve been a near invaluable find for their strategic and preparatory departments. And now? Now they were somehow in a position where exactly that had become detrimental to them.

What a cosmic joke-

His thought didn’t quite get to finish as the Sun’s various sensors for spacial distortion suddenly began to flare up in warning. Being this close to the Galaxy’s core and with it the absolute main-traffic-center of the entire Community, they already had to dial down the scanners’ sensibilities to hyperspace, simply because the ‘background noise’ around these parts was so much higher than basically anywhere else.

Yet despite that adjustment, all the measurements suddenly went haywire all at once, reporting that the newly set specification limit for ‘concerning activity’ had been more than just surpassed.

“I-incoming hyperspace-stretches!” an Officer yelled out what the systems had already made everyone aware of; her voice briefly catching in her throat as she obviously couldn’t quite believe the numbers that the systems were reporting to her. “L-large ones! T-three hundred and counting!”

Three hundred!?

The Vice-Admiral checked his own screen to confirm the number, even if he had no reason to believe that his Officers would lie to him.

Of course, three hundred hyperspace-stretches approaching and departing from a station of this size over some time? Nothing out of the ordinary.

But...over three hundred of them suddenly popping up almost all perfectly at the same time?

“Raise all alarms!” he ordered immediately. “Be prepared for anything.”

Immediately, he proceeded to draft up urgent S.O.S. signals to be sent out to Earth and all of their allies – which he would immediately expand to all surrounding systems if there came any active signs of hostility - while the bridge erupted into hurried business.

Three hundred ships at least. If this was an invasion, they had no choice but to retreat.

Luckily, the Sun was faster than any ship that could be brought against her, so being potentially pursued wouldn’t be much of a problem. Though, even though other members of the Community weren’t known to employ hyperspace collapse or hyperspace injection in their strategies, it would be detrimental to rely on that. Therefore, they would have to leave quickly before any ship would get the chance to mess with their transport.

Which meant it would be in their best interest to get out first and ask questions later.

“Ma’am,” the Vice-Admiral therefore quickly said once he opened the connection to the Admiral back up. “I’m going to need you to hurry it up!”

Not too long ago, he had received a row of messages that had heavily indicated to him that things were reaching their hot phase, and that he specifically should be making his way to a certain detention facility. There, he would await further instructions.

Well, ‘there’ he was, and await he did. Not too far away, he could hear one of the ongoing riots that had began to consume the station quite suddenly, loudly proclaiming their displeasure with the changes the Galaxy was seemingly ""allowing"" to happen.

Although he had heard nothing specific about it, Reprig could only assume that those hadn’t simply happened on their own.

Likely, they were connected to him being here. He would probably get more information as soon as whatever would happen next was going to happen. So far, he was left waiting. Seemed like he arrived a little earlier than expected. That or things got delayed somehow. Either way, he wasn’t going to bother investigating.

“Uhm, excuse me?” a slightly quivering voice suddenly pulled him from his thoughts, and he felt his ear and trunk twitch as his body inadvertently reacted to its familiar sound. Not familiar in the way that he knew the owner of the voice, but familiar in the way that he instinctively recognized it as coming from a throat like his own.

Looking up lazily at first, he quickly snapped to more attention as his eyes fell upon the young man who was approaching him. His fur was slightly darker than Reprig’s, and the white patterns on his back were therefore more pronounced.

However, that was the last thing that Reprig noticed about his appearance, because everything else was overshadowed by the orange smudge of blood that was seeping through the fur on the man’s temple, oozing out from in between his fingers that he pressed over the wound, which also pulled Reprig’s gaze to his right eye, which was swollen shut by a growing hematoma.

The man seemed slightly unsteady as he stood, and Reprig quickly took a step towards him in case he was about to lose his balance.

“Could I maybe ask to use your assistant?” the man asked, his voice still shaking as he watched Reprig approach him with little immediate reaction, seemingly in shock after whatever happened to him. “Mine...mine got broken.”

Reprig’s eyes widened even more as they flicked to the spot on the man’s arm where he would likely usually wear the device. Now, he only saw disheveled fur with a few big patches ripped out from it, revealing dark spots of bruised skin to his view.

“What happened?” Rerprig asked in concern once he reached one level with the young man. “Who did this to you?”

The young man took a moment longer than Reprig would’ve liked to reply. He seemed to not process the question for a bit before he finally blinked and made eye-contact.

“I-I ran into one of those protests,” he said, his voice still empty of any emotion apart from weakness. “They did not appreciate me being around. They did not appreciate my recording.”

Reprig’s expression darkened as he began to put two and two together, looking once again at the previous position of the seemingly ripped-off assistant.

“Savages…” he commented, throwing a venomous glare in the direction he could hear the commotion coming from. Then he returned his gaze to the man, and gently touched his shoulder with his free hand. “It’s alright, I am going to call emergency services for you.”

Still constantly glancing at the young man to make sure he wouldn’t tip over, Reprig quickly worked on his assistant again, calling the station’s emergency line. Almost immediately, a robotic voice came out of the device’s speakers.

*“You have reached the Council Station’s emergency line. We are currently experiencing an unusually high amount of calls, and no operators are available to receive your call. To avoid lengthening hold times, please write a message to the emergency number with the nature, location, and any additional information about your emergency and hang up the line, if you are able to. The messages will be triaged for importance and helpers will be send your way. If you are not able to write out a message, please stay on the line. Your emergency will be processed as soon as at all possible.”*

Reprig clicked his tongue as he hung up the call. What a joke. Emergency services that got overwhelmed by an emergency. Then what were they there for!?

Though, his anger then dampened and was quickly replaced by a heavy stone in his stomach as he once more heard the shouting of the rioting protesters. An emergency…

Quickly, he began to write up the requested message, hoping that it could be processed more quickly if it was the recommended method of contacting the services. As he did, the young man’s empty eyes absently scanned over him.

“What happened to your leg?” he asked, his voice now even weaker than before and Reprig could see how his unsteadiness grew.

Without thinking too much about it, he quickly pressed his crutch – which he could barely use while needing both hands to type anyway – into the young man’s hand.

“A work accident,” he half-lied while making sure the young man really grabbed onto the walking-aid. “Here, lean on this.”

It would’ve probably been better to get him to sit down. However, given the proximity of the ongoing riot, Reprig was worried that he wouldn’t get the young man back on his feet quickly enough should they need to move before emergency services arrived.

Where was security in all this anyway?

Once the man followed his advice and leaned his weight onto the crutch, Reprig quickly got back to furiously typing out the message, now balancing on his remaining leg with small, simply adjustments.

When he was just about finished and read over it one more time to make sure he had left nothing important out – or lost it to a typo – he realized that he should probably add the young man’s name as well.

However, just as he looked up to inquire about it, the door he had been waiting in front of for at least twenty minutes previously suddenly opened.

Reprig couldn’t quite help but glance in its direction, and when he did, his stance immediately turned a bit stiffer as he saw none other than the Leader-Supreme step out of that damned door – which in turn almost made him lose his own balance now, as bending his knee and moving his spine was sort of important to him standing on one leg.

Turning in not the most dignified of hopping manners, he quickly looked towards her and gave a brief sign of respect. He had no idea how or why exactly she was allowed to simply walk free like that, but right now, he wasn’t going to question it.

“High-Matriarch,” he greeted her with a heavy swallow before nervously glancing back at the man behind himself. “I will be with you in just a moment, I-”

“Oh my! What happened to him?” High-Matriarch Tua asked, approaching the two sipusserleng with slightly hastier steps and pointing one end of her trunk in the injured young man’s direction.

Reprig blinked a bit at her concerned tone, but he quickly cleared his throat.

“Some of the protesters attacked him,” he explained gesturing in the direction of the ongoing noise. “I was just about to contact emergency services.”

The young man nearly tipped over as he brought his head all the way back into his neck to try and look up at the enormous zodiatos, though luckily, he managed to bring his weight back forwards and onto the crutch just in time to not meet the ground intimately.

The High-Matriarch released a displeased huff through her trunk as she tilted her head to better look down at the small person.

“Oh no. How unfortunate,” she said, taking in the injured man’s wide stare up at her massive form before then lifting her head up to gaze in the direction of the loud riot. “Cashelngas really whipped something up there, didn’t he? Such undirected violence. And he thinks he is any better than the people he deems to vilify? If anyone seems to enjoy the taste of blood, it is those hooligans.”

Reprig stood...confused for a moment. He didn’t disagree with what Tua said, but…she sounded so genuine. However, he couldn’t imagine that all of this had somehow happened without her input.

Yet he had worked for her for a long time. He knew the way she spoke when she was making a point, and the way she spoke when she really meant something.

And this was the latter case. She truly...hated those people.",3,1745359258.0,HFY,4,1.0,False

John leaned in the doorway, watching her. The light caught her legs, the curve of her cheek, the small smile she wore without effort.

She glanced back. “Don’t just stand there. Come.”

They walked through the garden together. The grass was still cool underfoot. At the frangipani tree, she reached up and snapped off a bloom.

“This one’s fresh,” she said, tucking it into her curls. She turned and looked at him. “How do I look?”

“You know how you look.”

She gave a quiet laugh, then took his hand and led him back toward the pool.

She crouched by the edge and dipped her fingers in. Swirled the water once. Looked back at him.

I’m worried that the little things that are bothering me are building up to something bigger I shouldn’t ignore until our lives are too entwined. 

Super long, apologies mobile users. I don’t want to break up, I love my boyfriend and we work through things but I’m exhausted and need to let some things out without worrying about tone or him feeling attacked and have some advice on going forward.

This might just be a rant, I don’t even know how justified I am and I know there are two sides to everything so please know this is my biased side after feeling so tired and being a bit hurt. I feel guilty even typing this out but I think I might be getting myself into hot water. I (F25) and my boyfriend (M23) have been together for almost a year. We lived at opposite ends of the country so I drove every couple of weeks 7 hours each way to visit. He has a very good and stable job and we decided since I didn’t have anything to stay for (living with family whilst I settled back from travelling) that I would move down to him and we would move in together, which we are doing in two weeks but currently staying with his parents and have done for two months as I got a job down here.

The last couple of months have been tough on us, I was really struggling when I moved down and found out I was pregnant, I knew I would need to have an abortion but it turned into a complicated miscarriage and three weeks ago I was haemorrhaging in A&E (he was absolutely fantastic in the hospital).

Honestly though the pregnancy and miscarriage made me really tricky to be around and probably almost broke us. I’m still exhausted, I lost a lot of blood and had an unpaid week off work, I didn’t have a lot of savings, my car gave out last week due to wear and it’s going to be a lot to fix it, so it’s all taken it’s toll along with the trauma. 

I’ve got no friends here really, and haven’t had the energy or time because I rushed to get a kind of crappy job so I could move here. I didn’t have any where I moved from because it was a stop gap but I stayed in the country when the relationship started. I’m artistic and creative but the area is proving to be pretty expensive and honestly, boring. I wanted to start some martial arts but got a lot of pushback and he suggested pilates instead and we went back and forth until he backed down. He gets upset I haven’t done more but I’ve been so tired and tried so hard to get involved with his family, his club, work.

I’ve got really into my boyfriends hobby so we can spend time together, which takes up most weekends and week nights and he is always on his phone or thinking of. But it isn’t my hobby and I feel a bit lost now.

I love travel but agreed to settle for a couple of years here whilst we built up savings to go somewhere else to work together, I was really nervous about this but he has assured me we will go. If we weren’t together I’d probably be away doing that - I stayed where I was for a year for the sake of our relationship.  

Because of this and feeling so unsettled now and exhausted, I’m wondering if I’m overreacting to some issues which are bothering me. He’s really always praised my emotional intelligence but it’s felt to a point like teaching a child to be reasonable with emotions, he’s an only son and sometimes feels like he’s quite short sighted. 

I’m typing this after we agreed we would have a fun chat about going away for a few days over my birthday soon, but he downloaded a playstation game of his hobby and sat next to me in silence for nearly two hours instead. I cooked dinner for him and his family tonight, which he never does and occasionally has put together some ready meals for us but he’s more eat out kinda guy, and it’s really just put a downer on me. Earlier we all were cleaning the new house this afternoon and I scrubbed the bathroom top to bottom whilst he dusted the blinds (there are 4/5 windows).

I’d had to rush from work because he told me his Mum wanted to go early and was really stressed, it felt off and I asked if actually he had requested we go early so he had time for his hobby, he said no… then changed to yes a few minutes later because he said he “didn’t want to be told off”. He knows I worry about upsetting his Mum and the little lies bother me and they happen quite a bit but he just grinned and laughed.

He also is really forgetful, plans, things he said he’d do, needs pushed to do almost all chores, won’t do laundry by himself, needs reminded to shower even when he got a sweat rash, pushes back at me nagging him to, complained about his body but wouldn’t go to the gym and when I encouraged then honestly just pushed he got annoyed, won’t unload the dishwasher unless he needs to to load it. He doesn’t walk his own family dog because he’s slow so his parents ask me to do it even though we both work from home quite a lot. 

He’s had a very intense and overbearing Mum and I think this has meant he pushes back on things like this he doesn’t chose to do himself and I’m really hopeful and he’s very assuring this will change when we move in a couple of weeks but it’s getting tiring. He said he would quit fun smoking also, but he found a fun smoking vape the same day he ran out of “stuff” and uses that every day. It’s not overwhelming but he knows I don’t love it and promised he would stop and it would be a fail safe and not habitual but it’s every day… and when I call him out he either gets annoyed or laughs it off. 

He get’s angry, we both do in arguments, but says quite hurtful things he doesn’t mean and then expects to go away, I trained myself to not do this but if we disagree and my tone is “rude”, even though I think often it pales in comparison and is hustling trying to match his level of assertiveness he calls me out. He is incredibly defensive so the point of getting upset with me and my tone when I am panicking immediately after he “forgot” to consider I was very sensitive around being intimate post-miscarriage and hurt me accidentally in a way that triggered flashbacks by being too hard. 

Again, his parents are very intense, and has said he is going to go to therapy. He then says he’s a terrible boyfriend out of the blue, and I remind him this is something he hates his Mum saying which he brushes off. He says I always twist things and he’s always apologising… Honestly he apologises quite a bit, but not from nowhere also he forgets a lot, can be really hurtful and quite self-centred and this has been tough with everything over the past few months. 

I really love him, I love his drive and passion and kindness towards people and he’s so personable. My family loves him. He’s also really complimentary, never given me any reasons to be jealous, talks really highly of me to others and is very generous with his money because he earns a decent bit more and likes buying things. But this is also proving a bit tricky to navigate right now as we can’t even commit time to discuss how this will work other than “60/40” when we move in. We went round to our new house the other day to get measurements and I was doing that and found him just sat on his phone on the sofa and had to ask him to help. If I don’t push for a discussion it just won’t happen, and this goes for a few things.

He keeps bringing up that he’s going to propose this year and we’ll never break up because we work through everything and we do! But it can be really draining sometimes and has been on top of everything since I’ve moved down as I feel like I explain EVERYTHING and he just goes Ohhhh right. It sounds so silly but today I was stressed sorting out work and finances and my car and he came to tell me that he wanted me to know he didn’t care about going away and he was being easy going to not stress me out but I wish he would have just offered to help or made some suggestions because now it’s on my never ending list of things to bring up or else they won’t happen, he says I’m indecisive about things and likes when I just say what I want but I’m so tired. 

When our relationship started I liked that he was quite masculine and took a level of charge, I’ve been hyper-independent(traumatic childhood) my whole life and liked this outlook and his commitment to us (brought up marriage and seriousness of our relationship very early). But unless there is a crisis, which he excels in, this has kind of disappeared. 

I swore I wouldn’t do the teaching a man how to communicate his feelings thing, or plan my own dates or have to ask to buy flowers or ask for him  to ask me if I would like a coffee when he makes one but I feel a bit back here. 

I’m now panicking a little but frankly I could just need a rant, some trauma therapy for last couple of months and some time, especially for us to have our own place because I know that will ease him up significantly. I know I’m biased and I sure bring my share of argumentativeness and stubbornness, we’re both very strong willed and like to be right and we’re working on it. I really do feel like when we try we get through anything but I’m on my knees a little now.

He woke up late for work, and realized that his house was on fire. He tried to escape, but the door was locked and the windows were barred. He screamed for help, but no one heard him. He was burned alive by the flames.

He woke up again, and realized that it was all a nightmare. He sighed with relief, and got ready for work. He spilled coffee on his shirt, and noticed that it had a stain of blood. He looked at his chest, and saw that he had been stabbed by a knife. He felt a sharp pain, and collapsed on the floor.

He woke up again, and realized that it was another nightmare. He was confused and terrified, and wondered what was going on. He got ready for work, and forgot his wallet at home. He ran to catch the bus, but it was hijacked by terrorists. They threatened to blow up the bus, unless the government paid them a ransom. They drove the bus to a bridge, and threw Bob out of the window. He fell into the river, and was eaten by a crocodile.

He woke up again, and realized that it was yet another nightmare. He was shocked and horrified, and wished that it would stop. He got ready for work, and decided to take a taxi. He hailed a cab, but the driver was a serial killer. He locked the doors, and drove to a remote location. He tortured Bob with a chainsaw, and cut off his limbs. He buried Bob alive in a shallow grave.

He woke up again, and realized that it was the last nightmare. He was numb and hopeless, and knew that it would never end. He got ready for work, and arrived at his office. He found out that his boss had fired him for being late. He was so angry and frustrated that he grabbed a gun, and shot his boss in the head. He then shot himself in the head.

He did not wake up again.

1k5imae,https://i.redd.it/3ghorigzigwe1.jpeg,The Age of Rage,"An urban teen asked me, *“What’s the difference between a hero and a terrorist?”* His question stunned me, not because I hadn’t considered the difference, but because I’d never thought to place them side by side. Is the flip side of terror, heroism? I had just finished speaking to his class about my work covering conflict, particularly the current political story surrounding the U.S. deportation of alleged terrorist gang members to El Salvador. We hadn’t talked about terrorism, or justice, or vengeance. Not directly. Still, I knew what he was reaching for. The question was not academic. It was personal.



I didn’t think he cared much about global jihad or black-flag militias. That wasn’t his question. I suspected he wanted to know something harder to know: how far should a person go to protest an injustice? How far is too far? This teen is from a particularly dangerous neighborhood. I felt he was asking, at what point does a defender of the good cross the line and become, instead, a destroyer? Where’s the line? Maybe he was asking something even deeper, something darker. What does it mean to be called evil? What does it mean to believe you’re good?



I went silent. Five seconds, maybe. I had no answer in the front of my mind, but there was a torrent coming up from just below my mental surface. And then, like a corona of light breaking at the edge of the moon, an answer formed, and it startled me.



I said, *“If I am motivated by outrage and lend that outrage to hate, I will become consumed by hate. And I will want to kill. That is the heart of hate—destruction. Rage incubates death.* *Destruction is the offspring of terror. But if I turn that outrage inward and see it not as a need to punish, but instead as a desire to protect something I love, then maybe I become something else. Maybe I become a revolutionary. Maybe that makes you a hero. But the line between the two is fine because when you fight you must fight to win—but win what? It is a Thin Red Line. One side is chaos and the desire for destruction. The other side is order and desires to protect. Anger defeats. Love defends.”*



My own answer stayed with me like a teacher, as if it wasn’t from me at all. Could it be that spirits teach us best by questions we are forced to try to answer?



Rage leads to violence, that is for certain. It offers no options. It demands allegiance. Hate doesn’t flirt with destruction, it mandates it. But love—real love—demands something almost strange, in terms of a fight: restraint. If you love a thing, you protect it. Though you may fight an attacker, you do not crave to harm the attacker, you crave the survival of the thing you love. Love preserves. It protects. Sometimes it even protects its enemy—because that, too, is the nature of love.



So the line between the terrorist and the hero, then, is not in what they destroy. It is in why they fight. The terrorist is guided by grievance. The hero is anchored by grief—for what has been lost. The first is furious to punish. The second bleeds to defend. And the roles cannot be inverted. Not even if the cause feels righteous.



As I thought about the two figures of the student’s question, I realized the question of the hero and the terrorist is the deepest ethical question. And yet it is very simple. The student was not asking me as a person, but he asked the question to me as a journalist—supposedly a member of the highest order of media—journalism, the news, what we purport to be the quest for the truth. 



I thought about my profession and I have known for a very long time there is something wrong. 



Journalism is broken, not in its ethos, but in its very architecture. Its problem is in the scaffolding it has built and left us journalists with. The architecture and its scaffolding is no longer fact but emotion. Almost singularly, anger.



Whether by accident or intention, we now live in a system that does not just allow outrage—it monetizes it. Ours has become an industrialized rage, packaged and sold under the soft disguises of activism and news. 



We were once in the age of information. Now we live in the age of rage.



We say “education” is the solution. But what are we teaching? And how are we learning? Whereas in generations before, few were educated and relied on intellectuals to interpret the world for them. Now the entire world has the equivalent of a phd from the bright screen of a smart phone—or the illusion of a phd. For better or worse, “media” is the global classroom.



But the design is flawed and we are hurtling into space with a broken machine that cannot sustain life in the way it has promised us. 



Media—whether right or left—is not structured to inform. If ever it was, it isn’t now. It is structured to provoke. Outrage is not a side effect. It is the product. On purpose. It’s the fuel and the fire.



And the machinery runs hot. Engagement is no longer logical, it’s emotional. Rage travels faster than thought. In the quantum world it may travel faster than light. Its reward is immediate—a fountain of hate-filled dopamine. And the slower disciplines of accuracy, the beauty of nuance, the wisdom of humility—those old tools of the wise storyteller—they suffocate under the weight of the lust to “go viral.”



Of all “media” the most deceptive of all is “news.” Because “news” purports to be about pure information and “reports” on serious events.



Where once newsrooms competed on credibility, they now compete for speed.



I took some photos of men being deported. Thrown into cells. It is never not a bad story when a human is imprisoned—it is an old story where any side of the debate can latch on and fight for it. But I wanted something slower to come out of the publication of the images—something reflective. Because stories of pain ask for a conversation.



Once upon a time, a photograph might spark that conversation—a debate over coffee, a slow reckoning the next morning with the paper unfolded at the breakfast table, a troubling but honest conversation in the corporate break room, a friendly debate over drinks after hours.



But now, the thing explodes instantly, almost as soon as the shutter clicks. Before the facts arrive, the outrage strikes like a snake bite. Left or right—it doesn’t matter. It’s all lava now. The feeling as currency, not the truth, not fact, but the affirmation of the unchallenged, entrenched narrative. Always asking: which side are you on? Offering only two options.



And so we produce stories that flatter our worst, most calcified instincts. They are not stories of flesh and blood reality, but narratives reduced, almost, to caricature. Lives lost in a slurry of generalizations and statistical summaries written to reinforce our worst suspicions, flattering our fires of anger with dry, brittle wood. And a narrative that flatters your worldview will always win your unquestioning attention. And if it flatters your rage? Even better. Because rage sticks in the eyes and spreads wider than fact. Rage is an ocular virus. Ugly narratives, its host.



The media knows this. Or it has learned to live by it. It adapts. Headlines are crafted not to inform, but to inflame. Journalists sermonize their disgust on social media with a kind of sanctified fury, not even trying to hear the quiet things, the things that speak the loudest. They stand on bombed out rubble and point fingers and sometimes even work up tears. And the line—once sacred—between reporting and opinion disappears in a red plume of death. Not eroded. Obliterated. And it’s not even opinion we are left with, but protest and raised fists and the need to destroy—we are left only with the Terrorist.



The journalist is no longer a witness, but a protagonist—or worse, an assassin. They choose a side, and to hell with the facts. All that matters is winning. The journalist, in this sense, has become the terrorist, not the hero.



And who does the journalist and his news serve? The wild crowd, the tribe circling the camp, preparing to repel, attack, kill the enemy—even if it is a windmill. 



The wold has not advanced and become a global family, the world has splintered into angry tribes. 



We were always tribal, that is the irony. But before we were tribal because the land and weather and geography itself was against us—like a Jack London story. That was the noble tribe. This new tribalism is nothing like that. We are not gathering around our fires and educating one another with our true stories and true myths and true legends, we are building bonfires to burn the witches—those we disagree with.



To repeat my point, this collapse is not cultural. It is a failure of design—the system is not broken, it is built this way on purpose. 



Journalism today is structured to serve the crowd, not the citizen (the difference being the crowd represents a thoughtless mob, the citizen represents a unity of differences who agree to abide by a mutual covenant). The system is designed to polarize the crowds, and the citizen is left to try to inform themselves on bits and scraps of reality—they have to hunt the facts like prospectors. All the while, the designed system becomes a willing slave of algorithms and sponsors, furthering the empty narrative, reducing life to slogans and deadly demands. 



You know the system has matured and bloomed when it seeks to form the terrible tribe. Spears raised, ready for blood.



These tribes cloak themselves in the language of justice, but that’s a lie. Because justice that ends in destruction is not justice. It is power. And the moment the story begins with “us” and “them,” it ceases to be a story at all. It becomes a call to arms. And outrage, once armed with spears, never stops at rhetoric. It kills.



We’ve seen this logic before. First-strike doctrine. Mutually assured destruction. The Cold War may be over, but its ghost lives on in our pixels and is being written into digital headlines: George Floyd’s dead body foisted onto a flag, the new hammer and sickle. Anyone or anything that can be named a victim becomes the nuclear first strike, the flare in the sky, the rallying cry to attack the enemy and kill, kill, kill. It believes its own lie that if it does not kill you first, you will likewise kill.



So then what? What should be done with this thing we call “journalism”? Should we try to go back… to a time of so-called objectivity? Back to Edward Murrow reading bulletins in a clipped voice on a flickering screen? Back to analogue recordings of people reading data and files? Back to just the primary sources?



We can’t go back. That world is gone. It never really existed. And even if it did, it can’t return—not through nostalgia, not through the imposing of my will. Because this is no longer the age of fact. It is the age of story.



And not just any story. These are weaponized narratives, honed not to inform but to stir. What used to be reporting has become performance. Not a search for truth, but a script—a genre piece—crafted to provoke a reaction. Every headline is now a trailer. Every byline a character. Every reader a conscript in a war of blurred belief.



Outrage isn’t the byproduct. It’s the goal. Emotional velocity has replaced accuracy. You aren’t asked to think. You’re asked to join. To choose a side. The narrative becomes the echo chamber. The story becomes the prison.



But narrative itself isn’t the enemy. Storytelling isn’t the problem. The problem is that we’ve abandoned truth in service of sensation. We use the structure of a story to bypass the intellect and hit the limbic system. And when the only aim is impact, what we get is not journalism, but theater. Rage, scored to a soundtrack.



But there is hope hiding in plain sight on this grey battlefield. Even as the architecture is flawed and dangerous, the thing we crave exists inside the system like a ghost in a machine—Story. 



Story is ancient. Story has always been how we teach and are taught. Story is how we remember. Story is how we mourn. Story is how we survive.



So no, I don’t believe the solution is to claw our way back to some imagined era of pure objectivity. I believe the path forward is to reclaim the narrative—even if to repurpose it. To tell stories not to seduce, but to testify. Not to manipulate, but to witness.



When Hunter S. Thompson inserted himself into his story he was not the first to do it. But he might have been the first in modern times to anticipate the need to dispel with the lie of objectivity and admit that questions of pain and suffering are just as much a part of the story as the facts of geology and politics. Hunter Thompson did not attempt to be objective, he sought to be truthful. 



I thought again of the teen's question. What I am? I am a person of story. So how do I tell a story that protects life? I say it truthfully. I even adopt some of Thompson’s tradition and gladly enter my own narrative, confused by my own disgust and anger, but hunting not for a sword to kill, but a truth to hold onto.



That’s where I’ve arrived. Not at neutrality. Not at purity. At presence. I do not believe in the objective observer—the view from nowhere. I believe in standing somewhere—and staying there long enough to really  see. I am a witness.



And witnessing is not passive. It is not the absence of bias. It is the discipline of attention. The refusal to look away. The choice to remain in the presence of pain without turning it into a campaign. Most of life’s most debilitating questions have never been answered—just ask the character from the ancient poem “Job.” 



In an age addicted to performance, I have found my smuggling route. I carry the truth like contraband. Wrapped in awe. In terror. In silence. Not to seduce. To get it past the noise. To get it home. I am the man inside my own story hoping I can carry you with me to a story of your own.



A witness doesn’t argue. A witness remembers. This is not objectivity. It is something older. Harder. Maybe even more honest. Because truth, if it is to live in the world at all, must be carried by someone. It must be seen by someone. It must be named. Or it disappears.



And what we are facing now is not just a crisis of fact, but a famine of memory. A world so saturated in signals it forgets what it means to see what is real.



So this is what I offer. Not purity. Not perfection. Only this: I was there. And I saw.



In an age of noise, I believe that stillness is a kind of rebellion. In an age of performance, I believe that presence is a kind of truth. You can’t audit it. You can’t algorithm it. But you can feel it.  


And you can join it.



Because this work—this strange, old, necessary work of witnessing—is not mine alone. It belongs to anyone willing to see without flinching. Do not lower your eyes when they raise the sword. Look straight into the eyes of the killer like you look into the eyes of a lover—see it plainly and courageously. It will leave a scar either way. 



And so if I’ve done my part, the story won’t end with me. And it won’t end with an assassination. It won’t end.  


The end will become the beginning. You turn the last page and close the book and it opens again—now inside you. It begins with you. Standing where you are. Opening your eyes.  


And deciding that you, now, will not look away.

1k5ilu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k5ilu2/aita_for_sharing_my_boundaries_with_a_friend_who/,AITA for sharing my boundaries with a friend who decided to blow up our friendship because I didn't want to meet with her on Easter,"I know the title of this post sounds confusing, perhaps, but there is a lot more to this than you initially think. 

I had a best friend, let's call her ""K"". We had been friends going on over a year. Me and my fiancée (we are both in our early-mid 20s) had moved to a big city for work. She was the first actual friend I made there. We would hang out all the time, go to each other's places and just chill and vibe like we were in college still. I eventually asked her to be my bridesmaid as I'm getting married. That title changed to MOH once we started getting closer. 

My friend has had medical issues for a long while - in and out of the hospital all the time. We never really got a diagnosis either. She had moved back home when she lost her apartment because she couldn't hold employment due to her chronic illness. I was sad she left and always talked to her on the phone every chance I got. 

Fast forward the beginning of the year. She decided to move back as she was unhappy living with her mom and bunked with an old college friend she had. It was nice that that friend lived only 5 minutes from our house so hanging out was even more convenient. Around the time she moved back, her car blew up and so I ended up taking her around in my car whenever she needed a lift as that is what you do as a friend. Eventually this shifted to me having to drop things whenever she needed a ride to the hospital or whenever she wanted to hang out as she was unemployed. I, on the other had, have a very flexible, remote job so it made it easy for me to help her whenever. 

During wedding planning, K met my other two bridesmaids and I thought this could be the start a girl friend group that none of us had. It was refreshing for a while. We had a group chat and would hang out all together. 

What really caused things to go south was K texted me out of the blue the evening of Saturday, right before Easter Sunday. She was vague and frustrated, insisting on meeting with me. I didn't have a clue what she was talking about and tried to ask her for more clarity. K would get upset whenever I pushed back on wanting to know what was going on by insulting me and condescending me. She had told me that she wanted to get together and meet privately over coffee or a meal and was surprised I didn't have a clue as to why she was upset with me. I tried replaying in my mind what I could have done to make her this mad at me. Mind you she had never done this before. 

Because it was Easter weekend, I didn't particularly want to meet with her. I had suggested Monday as that was the earliest day that worked for me. She got frustrated even more by saying that didn't work for her because she had therapy that day. I tried to offer other times but she insisted on that evening or the next day. I told her I couldn't meet with her that evening as it was 7pm and we had started dinner. So we agreed to Sunday only because I felt pressured into it. 

Sunday rolls around and I'm trying to enjoy an Easter program with my fiancée on the couch. For context, I usually don't get too many leisure weekends as I'm required  to pull some shifts on the weekends. Everyone has known this in our friend circle. All that morning, K is blowing up my phone wanting to make sure I meet with her. I tried to ask her where and why it had to be a sit down meal and all I would get is that I don't get a say in what we do and that she wanted to go to Chili's and get a meal together. It felt very odd for her to be so rude in planning something I didn't get much say in. I didn't particularly want to get a meal as that felt too much for me. Besides, I didn't want to pay for a meal that I wasn't that hungry in eating. When I pushed back on this saying I didn't particularly want to buy a meal when we could do something less expensive, she got more upset and rebuttled by saying she would pay for the meal and did I have any other ""protests"" against what she wanted. I was really rubbed by the way she spoke to me as it felt rude and pushy. 

By this point, I had already been telling my fiancée (who was also a friend of her's and her roommate) what she was saying and was taken aback by how she was speaking to me. He insisted I call it off and said I had no obligation to her if she was going to act this way. I felt very conflicted as I wanted to appease her but I also didn't want to see her due to how she was treating me. Eventually this back and forth with K got more heated when my fiancée sent a response to her using my phone to tell her that I wouldn't be seeing her because I was too shaken up to come up with a good response. That's when K got so mad she hoped in an Uber and showed up at our house. 

The interaction with her was like a parent/child situation. She had a long list and insisted on talking first without interruption and started out the conversation by saying, ""It is not my fault you lost your friends today and I'm sorry for you."" She meant that she had talked behind my back to my bridesmaids and turned at least one against me when I didn't initially want to meet with her and that somehow justified bullying me because I didn't do what she wanted when she wanted it. She also told me she was recording our conversation to send to my friends as evidence and to use it in case I ever tried to make new friends in our community's ""make girl friends"" group online to warn them of me because I ""traumatize"" women. 

At this point I still hadn't known what I did that was so wrong. 

My fiancée had tried to sit with us so that I had back up but K was relentless in insiting she didn't want him there - using the ""I'm uncomfortable"" excuse. She had only said that because she didn't like that he had texted her on my behalf. 

By this point I was crying as I felt personally attacked. She continued to be rude in talking  to me that I tried to end our conversation by going inside my apartment as I felt the conversation was not being productive or kind. Eventually she tried to come in and my fiancée relented and allowed her speak her peace as long as she was respectful. 

The entire conversation was a 30 minute sit down rant of how I was not meeting her needs as a friend without the ability to chime in. I barely said anything as I was shaken up by the whole experience and then when she did leave she whispered under her breath trying to get me to leave my fiancée as if I was in a hostage situation just because she didn't like him! Then she proceeded to tell me I could  reach out to her later once I calmed my nerves if it was easier then for me to open up. She also said she would stand by me if I chose to stay with my fiancée. 

I did later that day send her a voice note explaining the things I found to be issues in the friendship. I was cordial and not rude and made sure she knew some things were non negotiable (like sharing my private chats and voice notes with other people behind my back - especially about things I told her in confidence that I explicitly said do not tell anyone about). Apparently she did not like my stipulations and texted me back that she was done with the friendship. I replied saying that was fine it was her choice and good luck and then blocked her. She apparently couldn't stand for that and messaged me on Instagram, being biligerent and rude and bullying me just because the friendship ended. I gave her that choice and she made it. It just felt so insane to me that she had to be the one to ""have the last laugh"" over a decision SHE made! 

I ended up finding out that the other friend she had tried to turn against me chose not to be my friend or K's. It hurt only because the other friend didn't bother to hear my side or let me talk. I was digusted by the whole drama anyway and it wasn't even of my own doing. The other friend's reasoning as to why she didn't want to stay friends was because she didn't want to be obligated to pitch in financially toward the bachelorette party SHE agreed to be apart of! On top of knowing that the cost was a topic of conversation that she knew about. (Which is crazy because, not that I wanted to comment on other people's finances, she kept going off on shopping sprees the entire time we planned the party even planning a 2nd vacay within the last 6 months but said she couldn't or wouldn't pitch in toward a trip she wanted to be apart of. We only planned for each couple to pay $100-200 so that it felt like everyone was contributing since me and my fiancée aren't rich by any means and wanted to have a good experience by the lake).

All in all, it just felt like petty excuses and stupid logic to get out of a friendship that I felt wasn't one-sided or unfair. None of them had ever expressed discontent with the friendship and it just felt out of nowhere. #AITA

I'm starting to box my things up. But, there's a lot of shit here that doesn't belong to me or my roommate. 

The person who lived here before us told me that all the junk in the basement was from previous tenants. There's so much shit down there that we have no idea where any of it is from or what to do with it all. The person here before us also so graciously left his mattress and box spring,  couch, coffee table, multiple dressers and ottoman despite me telling him to take everything out when he left. He blocked me because I refused to send him the damage deposit that the landlord did not return to him. I paid her a damage deposit, so I did not want to pay a second one just because she didn't want to return his. I cannot contact him anymore, so his shit is just here. 

Apparently it's been about 3 different leases since the landlord has been to the apartment at all so we really have no proof that the items don't belong to us. As far as she is concerned, the apartment was empty when we moved in (It was not— far from it.) I made a stupid mistake by not taking photographs of the apartment when we moved in. I believe my roommate might have, but I'm unsure if she still has those photos and she is unwilling to speak to me so I cannot ask.

Are we responsible for dealing with it? My roommate refuses to touch any of it because it doesn't belong to her, saying it's not our responsibility, but I'm very worried our landlord will charge us with removal if we leave anything and I am living paycheck to paycheck right now with no room for random charges. Am I stuck dealing with all of this shit myself? I only own a small car so I don't have the means to really bring all this shit anywhere. I don't have the money to pay someone to come get rid of it, and I am not old enough to rent a vehicle that can carry these things to dispose of them myself (nor do I have the money).

There's also a bed in our living room. I don't know where it came from. Our mutual friend was sleeping on it when he was staying with us during the summer. I think it might belong to him, but he is unwilling to speak to me anymore either. I tried asking my roommate but she said ""It's not mine."" and nothing else, won't elaborate if I ask.

Do I have to deal with all this stuff alone? I'm wary to ask our landlord about it because she's already not particularly happy with us (She tried to do a showing recently but apparently our apartment smells of cat urine. I deep-cleaned my whole bedroom to get the smell out as best I could. I'm not sure if my roommate did or not. I really don't know how to fix the smell without going into her room which I am not allowed) So I feel like if my landlord has the option to charge us for removal, she will. Is there anything I can do, or do I just have to get rid of all of this shit myself? ",1,1745358457.0,Tenant,1,1.0,False

John looked out the door with a mild frown. Rin had taken to work *eagerly,* which he didn't expect. Even now, she was weeding the central courtyard, pulling plants from between the stones with a steady hand… although he did have to stop her from cleaving them with jets of water and blades of ice at first. She had clearly never done any gardening in her life; she didn't even think about dealing with the roots.

Her eyes did light up, and she mumbled something about ""that's what my father meant"" when he explained it to her, so he supposed that things were working out. Aiki and Haru looked like deer caught in headlights toward the side as Yuki explained the situation, though, with an occasional glance toward the enthusiastic Dragon-Blooded. How strange that he was alone here a scant few days ago. What would he have done, he wondered, if Aiki and Haru had come to his doors if Yuki hadn't been there to anchor him?

He would have probably fled, now that he thought on it. He almost did when Yuki showed, after all. It was a bitter pill to swallow, but he was a coward, and they'd almost *certainly* be dead by his inaction.

John slid the door closed with a huff and returned to work, uncovering a half-completed focus component. He hadn't had much time to work on it recently, but it was *roughly* ready to be transferred to the detail workbench. After all, it was approaching the limit of what John could do with his slightly shaky meat hands. Alas, if only he had the insane *precision* of watchmakers. 

There had to be a secret to it beyond just practice, but alas, having access to Google would have made the last few years much less painful. He would love to have avoided playing the gripping game of ""Is this poisonous?"" before he remembered contact testing. Man, he *was* glad he figured it out before those green stems that looked a lot like rhubarb; those *absolutely* would have killed him on the spot if he was stupid enough to try and eat them.

Sighing, he picked up the small gray crystal and the diagram before transferring it to a workbench with… quite a setup. John removed his casting gauntlet and placed it off to the side, clear of his working area but still in reach if needed. Of course, he disengaged the lightning focus from it. Proper safety and all. He set up his blueprint with all the dimensions to the side next to it, using the gauntlet as an anchor to hold it down so he didn't accidentally blow it off the table if he got all grumpy and huffy again.

Although he had yet to actually manage proper optics, he had managed to retrieve a convex lens that the Nameless had managed to miss on a cart for reasons beyond him, and it was a good enough substitute for a magnifying glass. 

It was mounted a lot like one of those movable bathroom mirrors on swing arms and was plenty precise enough for his uses, but that wasn't the only reason he needed this bench. No, that was the roughly six-inch-long miniature arm. He took a seat and grabbed a harness leashed to the table, bearing various small focuses set into it onto his right arm. 

To be honest, this thing was even more of a nightmare to make than the lightning focus, and that was saying something. The insides did a lot of math using magic as a medium, like how transmissions were fluidic computers on the inside. The insides *already* looked like demonic sigils enough without getting actual magic involved.

Essentially, it was his telekinesis focus, just… *different*. Each ""node"" on the harness was linked to a hinged or ball-jointed spot on the miniature arm rather than being able to freely target things, and when active, they'd try to mimic his movements, just on a smaller scale. He moved his arm forty-five degrees to the left, and it would match it. He would curl his fingers, and it would match that, too.

It was inspired by surgical robots, so he couldn't claim that he made anything particularly new. Still, it was ideal for detail work. He tightened the clamps to hold it in place with his spare hand, laid out the diagram for what it should be, which he probably should have done before strapping in, and went to work.

After turning the harness on, John used the arm to grab one of the tiny files and went to work, rounding down extraneous bits with much more precision than he could have with his body alone.

It was almost meditative in a way. Soothing. Working away in a shop, isolated from all the more complicated issues outside, just him and his tools working towards a clearly defined goal.

This one would be something special and solve one of those annoying, complicated issues… assuming he didn't mess it up again.

That was always the issue with making foci; they were rather sensitive creations with *extremely* tight tolerances. John constantly checked the diagram, regularly measuring the dimensions with a tiny ruler to ensure he didn't go too far.

Hmm. Now that John thought of it, he'd have to go fishing later. With Rin here, his food supplies are starting to look dicey for winter. Still, if he were to supplement some things with foraging… Yeah, that'd work. Hell, now that he knew the local kappa to *some* degree, maybe he'd be able to bribe—No, *trade* him for some fish?

Although Yuki said that sending apology baskets wouldn't be terribly appropriate, she said nothing about some mutually beneficial trade! While he was busy plotting that, he heard someone clear their throat outside the door.

""John, it's Yuki. May I come in?"" asked the kitsune, and he felt his blood pressure spike. Should he? It was his sanctum, his place to get away from the world. His stomach churned. Underneath his emotional turmoil, he was well aware that he'd *eventually* have to show it to Yuki as part of their deal to teach her about his magic.

Why didn't he feel this strongly when he had Aiki bring over some fabric? It was frustrating. Maybe he was even more unstable than he thought.

Still, he saw no *logical* reason to decline.

""Yes. Please don't use any magic and close the door behind you, though, I'm doing something sensitive,"" he finally conceded. It took *forever* to figure out how much magic going on was too much when producing a focus and even longer to make the arm and file fall under those thresholds.

The door slowly swung open, and the monochrome kitsune poked her head in curiously. Glancing around at all the machines, her eyes widened, and her ears perked. Unspoken questions burned in her gaze as she examined the numerous devices. Yuki was frozen on the spot as she looked the pseudo-lathe up and down with an almost voracious hunger for knowledge.

Finally, she looked over to him, and the trance was broken. Stepping through the door, she closed it behind herself and hurried over to him with a spring in her step, stopping a respectful distance away even though she was clearly locked onto the miniature arm.

He waved, and the arm mirrored it.

""What a fascinating device,"" she murmured. ""This is how you do precision work beyond your physical capabilities back home?""

He frowned, shaking his head. ""Not quite,"" he admitted. ""Generally, we'd use a bunch of incredibly specialized machines to do the *exact* thing we want every time, with minimal input. Imagine having a saw that could cut the same standard piece of wood the same way every time… but those tend to be—"" John stopped, coughing as his overworked throat gave out on him again.

""Don't strain yourself!"" Yuki chided, pulling a… tray with two steaming clay cups from behind her? She set both down beside him and pulled over a spare stool for herself, sitting by his side. Taking the farthest of the two cups, she delicately sipped at the beverage within. ""I'm a big fan of stoneware for blends like this, but clay works well enough for this particular brew.""

John curiously picked up the cup itself and gave it a sniff. Long past memories surged to life at the familiar scent of a life long gone. ""Tea?"" he croaked, and at her nod, he continued, ""When did you have the time to get tea?""

And with what money, of course, but it felt like he had strained his throat enough as.

A devious grin split Yuki's face, which was promptly hidden behind the cup as she took another sip. ""This? Your throat being rather sore just happened to come up in conversation with a lovely old woman earlier today. You really should meet her sometime. Believe it or not, she had almost exactly the recipe I would use on hand and was happy to lend me some… in exchange for some of my own blends down the road, of course. Now, drink up before it gets cold.""

He sighed, eyes drifting back down to the cup. Whatever the blend was, it was borderline black and smelled earthy, almost like caramel in some ways. Taking the cup, he delicately sipped it, eyes widening in shock. It was deep and *rich*, nearly malty. Bitter, too, and he could tell immediately it was absolutely loaded with caffeine, his sweet, long-lost friend.

It took much of his self-control not to start gulping it down, but even though his will wavered, he did not break. 

Now that he got past the shock, he couldn't help but notice a slight, almost medicinal aftertaste to it that lingered on his palate for a moment after he sipped. Clever. Whatever was in this was likely rather unpalatable, but he could drink *this* all day.

The two drank their tea quietly for a time; no words were needed as they relaxed. John kept an eye on how fast Yuki drained her drink and matched it, lest he come across as rude. Of course, he didn't doubt that she noticed him doing this, but he imagined she appreciated the effort.

""It's good tea,"" he complimented, finally breaking the silence after his cup was half empty. Perhaps it was just his imagination, or his throat was *much* drier than he thought, but he swore some of the scratchiness was already gone.

Yuki tittered, ""You must really miss your *caffeine.*""

He groaned. ""Yuki, you have no idea. People with my profession back home? We live off the stuff. Three cups a day, at the bare minimum.""

Her eyes widened. ""Truly?"" she asked. ""You must be as valued as nobility. You must consume a good amount of a farmer's *coffee* crop yearly on your lonesome.""

Frowning, John shook his head, considering how much he should tell her. On the one hand, he still wanted to keep much of his origins on the down low, and letting her in on just how massive industrialization could be something that gives him away as not of this world. On the other hand, what could she do with knowing there were machines for picking crops back home? Besides, he was trapped now; if he didn't elaborate, it would be far more suspicious.

""Many of our machines are big and mobile,"" he began hesitantly. ""Some are good for planting crops. Some for weeding. Others for harvesting. I think one farmer with proper equipment, mixtures for the soil, and seeds can feed… one hundred thirty or so people?""

Yuki's eyes widened, and she straightened. ""*That* many?"" she quickly asked, continuing before he could respond. ""That would free up so much manpower! John, around *half* of all people who call this land home primarily deal with creating food.""

To him, that sounded low, now that he thought of it, but he supposed with the aid of magic—

""Even if one could 'only' mimic a fraction of those benefits here, having one farmer capable of feeding ten people would…"" Yuki trailed off, looking into the distance. ""This is part of how your people's homeland got so advanced, wasn't it? As you figured out better ways to do less work, people ended up doing jobs less about surviving and more about thriving.""

He paused. That was surprisingly accurate, even for Yuki. Fuck, he was glad she was on his side. John hesitantly nodded. ""Yes. Many historically thought that the poor were stupid, but the reality is that being uneducated is a whole different thing. Most of the geniuses that could have changed the world as we know it? They lived and died without even knowing how to write.""

Silence stretched between them, a frown drifting onto Yuki's muzzle.

""Back in my time, it was a bit different, even if not perfect,"" she began. ""There were Imperial Examinations back in the day, which would have helped at least pick some deserving candidates out and elevate them, even if they did little to help the uneducated."" She paused again, letting silence reign as she stared at the wall like her gaze was boring through it and toward the evening sun. 

""I haven't seen hide nor hair of them since I’ve been released. No prospective examinees preparing together. No eager buzz of parents talking about how their child bettered their lot through hard work and study. I fear that things have slid backwards into hereditary foolishness once more. There are certainly things that are better than back in my time, but… that is not one of them.""

John found himself speechless. He couldn't imagine what it was like to be sealed away for countless years, the world marching by without you, revealing shapes familiar but utterly alien when you finally achieved freedom. The closest thing he could compare was him being transported to another world, but at least that left little expectation of what things should be like.

He wondered what was worse: to be torn away from all you knew or to see it become unrecognizable? At least his home still existed somewhere, even if he'd almost certainly never see it again.

""I'm sorry,"" he instinctively apologized.

Yuki blinked owlishly, turning toward him. ""Why? You had nothing to do with it,"" she replied.

John shifted uncomfortably in his seat. ""It just felt like the right thing to say was all. Nobody should be ripped away from the world they knew like that.""

She searched his expression for a brief moment before a smile flickered back onto her muzzle. ""I think this conversation has grown too heavy for my liking; this has already been a rather *serious* day. What are you working on, if you don't mind sharing?""

He eagerly nodded, turning back to his work. ""I was thinking about the recent fight, so I decided to accelerate work on my previous project, as it is likely the ideal solution to a problem that recently became clear to me,"" he explained, pausing for dramatic effect. ""My speed, or more accurately, my lack *of* it. If Rin decided to draw on me at that close of range earlier today? The outcome… would not be clear, especially if she realized my weaknesses.""

John turned back to his work, delicately filing off another small piece of the crystal as he thought over his words, carefully picking each to make sure he was understood. ""This is part of an attachment for my crossbow, derived from a previously scrapped project. This is the emptiness-aligned portion. The plan is that, upon being triggered, it will coat a crossbow bolt in a quickly deteriorating sheathe of energy using air, order, emptiness, and gravity. You fire it, emptiness scatters the energy around the area in a field, and gravity attracts it back to any source of magic in the area, like an Unbound. From there, the lingering field of order and air holds everything in place around them, creating a slowing effect by making it *much* harder to move.""

Yuki's eyes widened, looking at the little carving in a new light. ""A potent tool. How strong is the effect? And how big is the radius? From the sounds of it, you just need to get close *enough* to a target, not hit them directly."" Leaning over and *slightly* invading his personal space, the kitsune looked through the lens at the subtle details.

He leaned away, and after a moment, Yuki pulled back.

""About… two and three-quarters of my body lengths, although the effect will be weaker towards the edge or if there are multiple targets. It'll likely get split between them rather than applying to everyone equally, so don't expect it to slow a horde much. It would at least be strong enough to make Rin a bit slower than a regular person, but… I'm not sure until I can test it. It wouldn't be the first time my calculations were off,"" he explained, sighing. If only he had gotten it right on the first shot every try; otherwise, he wouldn't have nearly cooked himself on his first few ranged heat focuses. Something creating a radius of thermal superconduction rather than a beam was an extra-large *oopsie*, but that's why he kept his warding on him when testing.

""It's a good start,"" Yuki hummed thoughtfully. ""I'd prefer if you had a way to *become* stronger or faster, though. This would be useless against anyone powerful enough to muscle through it or those who might avoid where the arrow lands. I assume catching it would still be enough of a sudden stop to detonate it, though?""

John groaned but decided to leave that comment about catching arrows for now. ""Enhancing yourself is a lot easier when you internalize magic and can play it by feel while having your subconscious do a lot of the heavy lifting. I don't think there would be a single person back home capable of devising an external mechanism alone."" 

The mere thought of trying to figure out whether increasing the power of his muscles would give him a heart attack or what increasing his reaction speed by boosting signal speed would do to his metabolism stressed him out. Even that was assuming he could find some way to figure out how to begin with, a biologist he was not.

""Still, you need more than that to keep yourself at range,"" she mused. ""Perhaps you could fly somehow? Kicking off the air is a common technique once you become *passable*, so perhaps you could create a derivative that moves itself.""

Wait, fucking *what?*

John's eyes widened, and he sat up straight, putting his file to the side. ""Excuse me? What's this about *flying?*"" he quickly asked, locking onto Yuki.

""It's the same principle in how I leapt onto the top of the wall,"" Yuki explained, tilting her head. ""Why do you think I could jump onto the wall from such soft ground while carrying five men? I reinforced the ground. One can do the same with air, although it's less stable than earth or stone.""

Wait, no, it couldn't be that simple! He could see doing it with order, but—No, that can't just be it.

It'd be nearly uncontrollable and so likely to send him careening face-first into the earth. It's not like he could stabilize something with…

1k5idzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k5idzn/aitah_for_chastising_a_random_persons_kid/,AITAH for chastising a random person’s kid?,"I (24F) go to a fairly large church every Sunday (at least 3,000 attendees each week). After the service, I like to hang out with some family friends in the vestibule area next to the church’s coffee shop. We are a sizable group of maybe 10 or so adults and a few kids of varying ages who just clump together to catch up. Since this vestibule area is large and open, lots of kids take the opportunity to run around and play, and I’m sure parents are glad their kids can get the zooms out before the car ride home. This is a very crowded area as what seems like a good portion of the church hangs out here for at least a bit before leaving. 

  
This one day, as our group is standing around and talking, a child of maybe 7 or so runs between our legs to get to the other side. I’m talking like squeezing between legs and pushing at thighs to get through. At first, I genuinely thought it was my friend’s son, since that’s the kind of stuff he does since we’re all family friends. But I look around and see him across the group with his dad, so I have absolutely no idea who just ran through us. I look at some friends I’m talking with and they shrug as well so we forget about it and keep yapping. Then the kid runs through again, and I catch a look at him before he’s swallowed up in the crowd of people. At this point, it’s weird but also, none of us really care. I mean he’s literally a kid and although pushing between a group of women, none of us really care about being jostled. Then my other friend’s 1.5 year old daughter gets fussy so she’s put on the ground. Within minutes, this same kid comes barreling through once more, but this time knocks over the baby. The kid is swallowed into the crowd and the baby starts crying (out of fear from falling, not from being hurt). I decide if the kid runs through again, I’m gonna ask him to stop. Sure enough, a few minutes later he runs through again, and so I grab him by the arm and gently tell him he can’t run through people like that because kids that are smaller than him can get hurt. I point out the baby that’s still snuffling, and then I let go out his arm. He immediately disappears in the crowd. I think that’s done with and move on to continue our conversations.  


Now it’s probably been another few minutes or so and a woman comes up to me and pulls me aside. She explains that her son has been inconsolable and she wants to know what happened. I calmly and clearly explain what happened and she goes “oh all right” and then leaves, so I think that’s done with. I go back to yapping and playing with the baby who has completely gotten over tumble.

  
Now ten or so minutes later a big man in a suit comes up to me and pulls me aside (I mention big because I’m an average 5’4 and this man was well over 6 feet). He says I talked to his wife earlier but he wanted to get a better idea of the situation. He claims his son has now been inconsolably crying for over 15 minutes now and that he has never cried like this in his life. I’m immediately skeptical, but parenting is its own beast and that’s not a hill I’d ever choose to die on. I once again explain the situation to the father and he starts talking in circles, but essentially he says I should’ve come to find him if I had a problem with his kid instead of correcting him myself. For context, I have been involved in childcare at churches/programs in some capacity since I was 14, so I like to think I am good at understanding how to correct children’s behavior in a professional manner, and the instinct is ingrained deep. I apologize that I made his kid cry, but that I would not have even said anything if the kid hadn’t knocked over our baby.



(After recounting this to a close professor who also works as a therapist, she pointed out that the man never apologized for his kid knocking over the baby. Which I hadn’t realized in the moment because I was slowly getting flustered.)



The conversation continues to go in circles for a minute or so and I feel like we are hashing the same points so I finally ask what outcome he would like from this situation. And he says he wants the “situation” to resolve between his kid and I. So I ask if he would like me to apologize and he says yes. I explain that I will apologize for making his son cry, but I will not apologize for ensuring he didn’t harm my friend’s child. He agrees and calls over his son who is suddenly shy. I crouch down and apologize as I said I would and the kid doesn’t respond. Then the son says to his dad “I don’t want to talk to the mean lady” so the dad says ""okay go back to playing"" and he runs off. I’m floored but keep my mouth shut because I just want this to end. The dad goes on again a bit about how in the future I should look for him to solve any situation. I nod and excuse myself. My friends are looking at me and I can tell they're going to be way less professional than I attempted to be so I wave them off and we move away from the father. In total this conversation with the father was apparently 10 minutes long. I don't feel like I contributed much to the conversation, but I honestly have no idea how it went on that long. 



So reddit, AITAH for chastising this kid instead of seeking out his parents? It honestly didn’t even occur to me at the time with how crowded the room was, and honestly I wasn’t invested enough to leave my friends to chase him down. Please give me your real opinions, because navigating propriety with other folks’ kids is such a weird situation. If other kids are being animals, I let them be. Not my monkey, not my circus and all that. But if another kid's actions hurts one of my own, I feel it's my duty to try to prevent that from happening again.",3,1745357996.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False

I work for a small office (6-7 employees) that is part of a much bigger organization. Another office mate and I got hired the same month, a little over a year ago. We are both single, in our 30s/40s, attractive, but I never even considered pursuing or even flirting with the idea of us getting together. Our office is way too small for that, plus, I work in academia where there is strict protocol against senior leadership (him) dating support staff (me). We became office pals, would go get coffees and stuff, but I never considered it a possibility so my thoughts simply never went that direction.

In November of last year, he started texting me quite a bit. We'd texted before but it was always a one-off. I didn't mind though as I considered him a friend. A couple weeks go by and you can tell he's getting flirtier and flirtier (I'm not), when he seemingly out of nowhere tells me he wants me, and has wanted me since shortly after we started working together. I was kind of shocked because he came on pretty strong and basically went over the whole timeline since we first met of all the pivotal moments he'd felt between us over the previous 9ish months.

I mean, I could tell he was attracted to me, and probably liked me, but he's also a poetic, artsy type so at the time I figured that was just how he related to most people. But then I thought back on the random song he'd sent me with lyrics like ""I don't know what I'd do without you,"" basically a love song. I figured we were just sharing musical tastes? And then I remembered a poem he printed out and gave to me and has taped to his office wall with emphasis on the line ""I want her like a river goes, bending..."" Again, he's in academia, so I just thought that he was another one of those eccentric professor types at the time.

  
I wasn't totally turned off to the idea of dating him at this point. His appointment with our office was ending soon, we were both single, I found him very attractive, etc, so it was a discussion we had. But he told me that after discussing it with, I guess loads of people, he was told by people in our organization not to touch me with a 10-foot pole as it goes against protocol. That if we dated we'd have to disclose it to our boss and one or both of us would be moved out of our office. Knowing that, we both decided not to date, and nothing happened between us besides some mutually flirty text exchanges.

  
I went about my business, but he seemed a bit preoccupied still. He worried I didn't like him ""as much"" as he liked me, to which I said um? We're not in a relationship, why would I? And he even at one point sent me an article on limerence and told me I was his ""object of limerence."" (Limerence, for reference, is the psychological state of being obsessed with someone.) I tried to keep it cool between us for the sake of our office and knowing we had projects together, I asked him out for coffee (at/during work) to try to smooth things over, and got some desperate text back saying ""We can't do this, not here, not now. I'm sure you're wonderful and I don't want to offend you, but we just can't do this."" I was kind of like um? Okay, buddy.

After that, he hasn't been in the office at all. His appointment with our office goes through the entire rest of this year, but he went on a sabbatical of types. He's still in town and we still have projects to work on together, but he rarely emails me back about work stuff, he only comes into the office to grab things out of his office, he never comes to meetings anymore, etc. He has a workshop this summer/fall and if I were a betting man, I'd say he's going to end up dropping it, and it's because he can't stand being around me.

I guess my question is, if he ends up dropping this project, which would be a huge blow to my boss, should I tell my boss about what happened between us? I'm not 100% certain he's not involved with the office anymore because of me, but prior to all this he always told me ""I miss being in the office!"" and how much he loved coming in. Now he's being an ass to me, won't even talk or look at me when I do see him, and is bailing on work projects. (This won't hurt him. Again, we're in academia.) This was never an HR issue in my head because I (briefly) entertained the idea of dating as well, but at this point it has clearly affected our office and the efficacy of our work. His appointment ends in January though so I could also just ride it out and forget about it. What do you lovely ladies think?",5,1745357760.0,AskWomenOver30,0,0.78,False

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>Adaptogens into your daily routine can bring a natural boost to your overall health and wellbeing. These powerful plants help your body manage stress, enhance energy levels, and support mental clarity. While many people know about adaptogen supplements or teas, there are creative and innovative ways to add them into your diet that go beyond the traditional methods. Here are five fresh ideas to seamlessly include adaptogens into your meals and drinks, making it easier and more enjoyable to reap their benefits.

### Adaptogen-Infused Smoothie Bowls

Starting your day with a nutrient-packed smoothie bowl is a fantastic way to add adaptogens to your diet. Powders like ashwagandha, maca, or reishi mushroom blends can be mixed directly into your smoothie base before topping it with fruits, nuts, and seeds. These powders mix well with frozen berries, spinach, and nut milk, lending a subtle earthy flavor that complements fruity and creamy textures. This breakfast option not only provides energy but also helps your body balance stress hormones throughout the day.

### Creative Adaptogen-Enhanced Baking

Adaptogen powders aren’t limited to drinks. You can experiment by adding them to your favorite baking recipes. Incorporate powders such as holy basil or schisandra into muffin, pancake, or cookie batters. Since these adaptogens have mild flavors, they blend well without overpowering the taste. For example, adding a teaspoon of maca powder to your morning pancake batter adds a nutty, caramel-like note plus adaptogenic benefits that support stamina and mood balance.

### Flavorful Herbal Adaptogen Tonics

Herbal tonics offer a refreshing and therapeutic way to consume adaptogens throughout the day. Prepare a blend using adaptogenic herbs like licorice root, eleuthero, or rhodiola, steeped in hot water or brewed as a cold infusion. To make it more palatable, infuse your tonic with lemon, ginger, or honey. This drink can replace your usual soda or coffee, providing a natural energy lift without caffeine jitters. Keeping a bottle handy allows you to sip adaptogens as part of your hydration routine.

### Adaptogen-Boosted Nut Butters and Spreads

Adding adaptogens to nut butters or spreads is a delicious way to boost your nutrient intake. You can mix powdered adaptogens such as reishi or astragalus into almond, cashew, or peanut butter at home. Spread your adaptogen-enhanced nut butter on toast, crackers, or fresh fruit slices like apples or bananas for a healthy snack. This simple addition introduces adaptogens to your diet with minimal effort and pairs well with everyday flavors.

### Incorporate Adaptogens into Savory Dishes

Most people associate adaptogens with sweet or beverage options, but they can also be added to savory recipes. Consider stirring adaptogen powders like cordyceps or ginseng into soups, stews, or sauces. Their subtle earthy flavors blend nicely with vegetables, meats, or grains without overpowering other ingredients. For example, a sprinkle of ashwagandha into a hearty soup can enhance the dish's nutritional profile while supporting your immune system. Experimenting with adaptogens in cooking makes it simple to enjoy their benefits during mealtime.

When introducing adaptogens into your diet, start with small amounts and observe how your body responds. Each adaptogen offers unique effects, and individual tolerance may vary. By incorporating these innovative methods—smoothie bowls, baking, herbal tonics, nut butters, and savory dishes—you’ll keep your meals exciting and support your body's natural balance in multiple delicious ways.

</div>The Science Behind Adaptogens: How They Support Stress Relief and Energy Boosting
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Understanding Adaptogens and Their Role in the Body

Adaptogens are natural substances found in certain plants and herbs that help the body adapt to stress and promote balance. Unlike conventional stimulants that provide a temporary burst of energy, adaptogens work by supporting your body’s overall resilience to physical and emotional stressors. This makes them a popular choice for those seeking to boost their energy levels and maintain mental clarity without the jitters or crash associated with caffeine or sugar.

Scientific research has gradually uncovered how adaptogens exert their effects by influencing key systems in the body. Primarily, they interact with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is central to the body's response to stress. By modulating the HPA axis, adaptogens can regulate the release of stress hormones such as cortisol, helping prevent the negative impacts of chronic stress.

### How Adaptogens Support Stress Relief

When you encounter stress, your body releases cortisol to manage the situation. While cortisol is essential for survival, consistently high levels can disrupt many bodily functions, leading to fatigue, anxiety, and weakened immunity. Adaptogens help by balancing cortisol levels, ensuring your stress response remains controlled rather than overwhelming.

For example, specific herbs like **Rhodiola rosea** and **Ashwagandha** have been shown to reduce feelings of anxiety and improve mood. They help your nervous system recover from stress more efficiently by calming overactive pathways and promoting relaxation. With regular use, these adaptogens can enhance your ability to cope with everyday challenges, aiding in emotional stability and mental well-being.

### The Connection Between Adaptogens and Energy Boosting

Unlike typical energy boosters that work by stimulating the central nervous system, adaptogens enhance energy by optimizing cellular function and reducing fatigue. They improve the body's capacity to generate energy at a cellular level, often by supporting mitochondrial health – the powerhouses of cells.

Take **Eleuthero (Siberian ginseng)**, for instance, which is known for improving physical endurance and reducing feelings of exhaustion. By helping your body use oxygen more efficiently and stabilizing blood sugar levels, Eleuthero contributes to sustained energy throughout the day without causing energy spikes and crashes.

### Key Adaptogens and Their Unique Benefits

- **Ashwagandha:** Supports stress reduction and has been linked to improved sleep quality and cognitive function.
- **Rhodiola Rosea:** Enhances mental performance and reduces mental fatigue during stressful periods.
- **Eleuthero:** Boosts stamina, supports immune function, and increases resistance to physical stress.
- **Holy Basil (Tulsi):** Known for lowering stress hormones and promoting a calm mental state.
- **Schisandra:** Helps enhance endurance and focus, while improving overall vitality.

### Scientific Studies Supporting Adaptogen Use

Recent clinical trials have provided evidence for the effectiveness of adaptogens in stress and energy regulation. One study showed that participants taking Rhodiola experienced reduced cortisol levels and improved mental capacity during tasks requiring focus under stress. Similarly, Ashwagandha has been repeatedly studied for its ability to decrease anxiety and lower biological markers of stress.

Researchers believe these positive effects arise from adaptogens’ ability to modulate neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine, which play critical roles in mood and cognitive function. This interaction supports not only immediate stress relief but also long-term resilience.

### Adaptogens Into Your Lifestyle for Optimal Benefits

To maximize the benefits of adaptogens, consistency is key. Unlike stimulants that work immediately but briefly, adaptogens build up their effects over time. Regular intake enhances your body's stress coping mechanisms and energy metabolism steadily.

Choosing high-quality, standardized supplements or fresh adaptogenic herbs ensures you receive the most potent bioactive compounds. It’s also important to use adaptogens as part of a holistic lifestyle approach that includes balanced nutrition, adequate sleep, and physical activity.

### Safety and Considerations

While adaptogens are generally well-tolerated, it’s wise to consult with a healthcare professional before beginning any new supplement routine, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions or are taking medications. Some adaptogens might interact with other treatments or affect hormone levels.

Starting with small doses allows you to monitor how your body responds and avoid potential side effects such as headaches or digestive discomfort. Integrating a variety of adaptogens can provide a broader spectrum of support but always do this under guidance for optimal safety.

By understanding the science behind how adaptogens support stress relief and energizing pathways, you can make informed choices to naturally enhance your well-being. These powerful herbs offer a promising way to nurture resilience and sustain vitality in today’s fast-paced world.

### Conclusion

Bringing adaptogens into your daily routine doesn’t have to be complicated. By exploring innovative methods like adaptogen-infused smoothies, herbal teas, nourishing snacks, creative cooking, and easy-to-take supplements, you can harness their natural benefits without disrupting your lifestyle. These powerful herbs and roots work behind the scenes to help balance your body’s stress response and naturally boost energy levels, making them a smart addition to your diet.

Scientific studies continue to show how adaptogens calm the nervous system and support resilience against stress. Their unique properties help regulate hormones, reduce fatigue, and promote overall wellbeing. When you incorporate adaptogens thoughtfully, you give your body tools to better manage life’s stressors while enhancing vitality from within.

Remember, adding adaptogens isn’t about quick fixes—it’s about supporting long-term health with natural, time-tested ingredients. Whether you blend them into your morning smoothie or sip them as tea in the evening, these small changes can create big differences in how you feel day to day.

During second visit also had higher IOP in 24-25 range. So he put me in glaucoma suspect category and asked me to start on Latanoprost which I did.

I have another follow up in 3 months to see how I am doing.

I am freaking out on so many things( mostly because of doing a lot of unnecessary searches and reading a lot online(I hate my anxiety)) 
- Do I need to cut down on coffee? I just have 1-2 coffees in a day which I really enjoy having.
- so much about sleeping position. I am not able to sleep since last 2-3 nights just because I am keep trying to adjust my sleep position. Do I really need extreme attention to this? I feel like I am more tense about going to sleep after this than during the day which is extremely tiring.
- do I really need to buy very expensive icare home 2 machine and need to monitor my IOP right out of the bed? I am anyways very anxious person and I just feel like if I buy this I will end up in anxiety spiral by measuring pressure many times. I am just curious that what percentage of patients buy this and do I really need this?

Hey all!
This is long, so grab some coffee if you’re interested. I’ve posted here a few times about my hesitation to sleep train my almost 5-month-old, and I thought I’d share our journey now that we’re seeing real progress. A few people have asked, and since this is my third time sleep training, I figured I’d share what’s worked for us. It’s not all luck—though temperament definitely plays a role.

Where we are now:

My little guy (20 weeks) goes down around 7/7:30 PM and sleeps until 6/6:30 AM with one feed around 2 AM. He takes 3 naps:\
-Nap 1: ~8:15 (fixed because of school drop-off)\
-Wake windows: 2 / 2.25 / 2.25 / 3 (max numbers here)\
-Nap lengths: 2 hrs / 1.5 hrs / 45 mins (max numbers here too)

We do a bedtime routine: final feed between 6:30–7, bath, vitamins, lotion, book, sleep sack, songs, then down. He usually cries a few minutes and is out. Same for naps (book, Merlin suit, down). All sleeps are in the crib in his room except the second half of the night—he’s in a pack n play in my room after my husband brings him to me for the night feed. Tonight I’m going to him instead, so he’ll stay in his room all night for the first time. Honestly, I’m a little sad—I’ll miss my tiny roommate.

What I think made a difference *for us*:

**1. Routine & consistency**

This is number 1 for a reason. From just days old, we set a day/night routine. At night, we kept it dark (dim salt lamp), quiet, and business-like. Diaper > feed (until fully asleep—about 20 min) > swaddle > back in bassinet. After 6 AM, lights on, fresh start. Naps were in our room with natural light, no blackout curtains. Always used white noise. Nighttime routine started early—bath, lotion, vitamins, songs. I even sing the same ones for superstition’s sake.

By 3 weeks, he had a clear first stretch that gradually lengthened to 6–7 hours by 5 weeks. I did the same with all three kids, despite totally different temperaments.

**2. Bassinet at night, contact naps during the day**

My husband had a great paternity leave, so for the first 10 weeks, I just embraced contact naps. I fed to sleep and held him while watching Gilmore Girls. At night, he only stayed asleep in the bassinet if I transferred 20 minutes after he stopped nursing—every time, like clockwork.

From 2–3.5 months, we shifted naps to bassinet/crib. He took short 30-minute naps at first, always fed to sleep and transferred. It was rough, but eventually those naps stretched to 45 min and even 1.5 hours. I stayed committed.

I still do contact naps sometimes (like yesterday). Flexibility matters—something I didn’t understand with my first.

**3. Wake windows matter**

They aren’t some trendy nonsense. With some flexibility, they work. Countless times, I thought “he doesn’t seem tired,” then he’d pass out in under a minute. Trust the windows.

**4. You’ll know when it’s time to sleep train**

I wasn’t ready at 4 months. Then one morning, something shifted. He knew it was nap time. I felt like it was fair to give him a chance to fall asleep on his own. He cried half-heartedly for 5 minutes, then conked out. Truly, the more consistent the routine, the less crying. Sleep training should be 80% expectation and routine, 20% learning to self-soothe.

———

**Transitioning to 3 naps**: Once naps lengthened, I committed to 3 naps (8:15, 12ish, 3:30ish). The wake windows were a little long for his age, but he adjusted quickly. It let us do a consistent 7/7:30 bedtime and fixed our early wakes almost overnight.

**4-month regression**: Hit around 3.5 months. That first long stretch dropped to 3 hours, sometimes waking every couple of hours for the pacifier. I wasn’t ready to ST, so I just did what I had to do: paci first, then feed if needed. It improved a bit, but real progress came after ST. We’re now back to one night feed.

**Controversial hack**: From ~2 weeks on, if he woke with hiccups or too early to be hungry, I’d give a tiny bit of gripe water and pop in the pacifier. The sweetness helped him suck and drift back to sleep. If he was truly hungry, it wouldn’t work, and I’d feed. I think this helped limit unnecessary night feeds.

**Gas management**: Gas can really interfere with sleep. We used gas drops at night feeds and sometimes during the day. My husband did leg pushes during diaper changes. I did tummy rubs in the bath (often led to poop), bicycle kicks, and lots of tummy time. I burped after the first boob, not the second (since he nursed to sleep). I avoided oversupply by skipping pumping early on—something I regret not knowing with my first. Those oversupply TikToks? I just picture those poor babies getting blasted by a milk cannon.

**Swaddle Transition**: We found a “sweet spot”—not too early (so we didn’t fight the startle reflex), but not too late where it overlaps with the four-month regression. We went straight to a sleep sack around 12 weeks. I was honestly shocked at how smooth it was—sleep barely skipped a beat. Timing it before the regression helped so he wasn’t adjusting to too many things at once.

After getting lost in the endless models from Roborock, Dreame, iRobot, I ultimately decided on Qrevo Edge S5A. I didn't are too much for the camera or other features of the regular Qrevo Edge to spend an extra $300. I was hesitant on another iRobot after my experience and also uncertainty if the company would go under.

I also wanted something with mopping built in. I had the iRobot M6 (?) and while it does decent at mopping, it could never go over small transitions, the mop pad would get dirty very quickly, and did not have a way to self cleaning. I probably changed pads 3x just for the lower level of my house. 

**First Impressions**

The box it arrived in was huge - easily 30% bigger than the product packaging. Got nervous until I opened it up and saw the unit wasn't that big. I ended up ordering on Amazon.

Setup was easy - took maybe 10-15 minutes.

Initial mapping of the first floor with cleaning probably took close to 2 hours, maybe more. I did have it return every 15 minutes to clean the mop pads. Battery life is good. I think I had like 46% once it returned after cleaning. My Roomba i8 was usually around 15-20%.

It does corners / edging a lot better than my Roomba and I like how it does the entire edge of a room first before cleaning the center. My Roomba would go edge to edge, leaving debris at the edge and never cleaning it up.

Suction power appears good and running my hands over the floor, I no longer feel any sand or dirt left over from my dog so it must be picking up everything. Mopping is much better than the iRobot M6 as the pads turning seems to 'scrub' more of the surface. Older stains come out decent but does require some elbow grease. I think if I mop 3-4x a week and vac 7x a week the Edge S5A will do a great job cleaning. It also seems to do great on low pile area rugs. It picked up all the crumbs from my dog's treats.

What I also like about this is I likely won't have to do much manual cleaning at all. My iRobot vac & mop, I always had to do a good clean once a month because of the edges and dried up paw prints.

Obstacle avoidance is good. I like how it never crashes into anything. My i8 bumper was scratched to hell as it would ram into everything. It didn't even slow down on approach for anything. I need to leave some wires on the floor to see how well it does with it. 

So far no dog hair tangles in the rollers. I'll check back after a month to see how it continues.

I would like to see if I can have it run a mop cleaning the morning after a rainy day. Would also like to see if I can get a 2nd base to put on the second floor and if it'll intelligently switch between the two.

**Summary**

This unit is much better than my i8 and m6 in many ways. Very happy I went with the Edge S5A. 

I'll try and post a review in 2-3 months once I've gone through a bag change and unit maintenance.

If you are in the market for  a vac/mop combo, I definitely would say to give this unit a consideration.

\- oat milk

But when I do the same thing and steam the milk, it always tastes more bitter and leaves a chalky after-taste. Is there a reason for this?

Not a gust of wind. No light sweater required. The crowd surrounds the Outdoor Theatre, and synths emerge with a familiar melody.

*Everything. Everything. Everything. Everything. Everything’s in its right place. Everything. Everything…*

The déjà vu hits hard - I’ve been here before. In 2010 Thom Yorke closed out the Outdoor Theatre at 9 PM on Sunday, starting his set with this same song to the same throng of tired festival goers getting one final triumphant last dance out before their weekend is complete. Radiohead performed this, too, at the Main Stage in 2012 and 2017, and I was there. And Saturday night of this year, 2025, Mau P closed out his prime-time Sahara set with a remix of this song.

Now Zedd was beginning his big moment at festival’s close:

*Everything. Everything. Everything. Everything. Everything’s in its right place. Everything. Everything…*

Is everything in its right place? Or are we just trying to recapture the highs of Coachellas past with a cover version of what we had seen before?

This was my 16th Coachella. 16! I will always love the festival. Something about the golden hour on a desert evening provides me with a sense of joy and calm that only exists in this exact setting. After 48 days (three per weekend) navigating these polo grounds, I could weave through these crowds with my eyes closed. Not that you’d want to - you’d miss the best people watching in the country.

But after so many iterations, is the magic still here? Or is it the facsimile of that magic?

This was my current festival group’s tenth anniversary of our first Coachella together. 10 is a lot! At times it was like our first - full of wonder and joy and transcendence. (We had a couple new members who had never been before). But other times, the feet hurt more, the music hit less, and the desire to get back to the room overwhelmed the desire to walk to another set or wait in a line for ID check.

Put another way, if our friend group had the time of our lives at a marathon in 2015, does it make sense to run that same marathon every year? Maybe not everyone is up for 26.2 miles anymore… I kept thinking about that quote from the Sopranos, the lowest form of conversation, according to Tony, is “remember when?”

Hearing T-Pain on the main stage felt very nostalgic for the thirty-something’s in the crowd. We all loved *Buy You a Drank*. But when he covered *Don’t Stop Believing*, it felt phony. You are T-Pain, you don’t need to ride the coattails of another generation’s crowd-pleasers. The “remember-when’s” were off the charts.

Similarly, Benson Boone’s big moment was his note for note take on Queen’s *Bohemian Rhapsody*. He performed with verve and gusto, but at the same time, you kind of wish these performers had bangers of their own to give us. He had one hit of his own at the end, otherwise no one knew these non-cover, vaguely Imagine Dragons-ish songs.

Which brings me back to Zedd. His set was one of the highlights of the weekend. And yet, this late thirties festival attendee kind of wished for the real thing, not just Zedd and Mau P playing a Radiohead song. When he did his own classic song, *Clarity*, with special guests, the LA Philharmonic, it did feel special. When he brought up the band Incubus, maybe a little more of a head scratcher, but we all did connect with the three Incubus songs we remembered.

What *did* unabashedly work about the festival was everything forward-looking. Lady Gaga and Charli xcx are hardly emerging artists, but they used their platforms to celebrate vibrant, culturally relevant new songs and visuals. Gaga’s performance was closer to musical theater than rock concert and ruled because of it. Charli went much more minimalist with it, highlighting her enthusiasm and songwriting. I am so thankful I got to see both in person.

Additionally, some artists used their moment to shine a light on what is fucked up in the world right now, like Irish rappers Kneecap and stadium rockers Green Day. (Spoiler alert: everything is fucked up right now). That energy was a needed balance for the weekend. We are in an existential crisis every day opening up the news, so it’s essential that we don’t just blow by it and bury our heads in the Sahara Tent. I saw one bro in a Trump tank top and considered engaging with him, but decided it was better to ignore than feed the troll. Still not sure if that was right.

I’ve written in the past that your Coachella experience is equal parts *music, group,* and *logistics*. This year Weekend 2 had phenomenal weather and wonderful organization. But that wonderful organization only happened because Weekend 1 was such a shitshow. So, give credit or blame to Goldenvoice if you want, depending on when you decided to go. Our lines were non-existent, theirs were 12 hours to get a camp site. Even driving home on Monday, none of the usual post-festival exodus bottleneck. With the mild temperatures, it almost didn’t feel like the same festival – there was no herculean endurance test.

The big logistical changes this year were switching the location of the Quasar stage with the Do Lab and adding a big ugly Red Bull building near new Quasar. This didn’t work for me, it made accessing the stage too difficult with just one point of entry and exit, so I stayed away from Quasar, sadly missing most of Alesso, Kaskade, and Gorgon City. Do Lab remained the best stage to the point that we all contemplated just staying there all weekend, but that was true in the old location, too.

Some baffling booking continued this year, in trend with the post-Covid iterations of the festival. Where were the indie artists? Where were MJ Lenderman, Waxahatchee, IDLES, Mannequin Pussy, Soccer Mommy, Father John Misty, Mitski, Wednesday, or Fontaines DC? Seems like there should be a lane at this festival for Pitchfork-endorsed indie music still in the sub-headliner or smaller font lineup location. I would have loved 2000-2010’s indie acts, too, like Vampire Weekend, Phoenix, M83, Passion Pit, Death Cab, Rilo Kiley, TV on the Radio, et al., but those are now booked at Goldenvoice’s own *Just Like Heaven* fest. Maybe add them back to the big leagues, that is what I am saying.

All in all, was everything in its right place? No. The world is not in the right place. But sometimes the copy of a great thing ends up being better than anything else happening at that moment, and it can provide a much-needed escape from the demands of reality. And Coachella retains its status as at the center of culture and the canvas for artists like Lady Gaga to make big statements. As long as that remains the case, you know where I will be each April. Even if our group may be nearly done with this particular marathon

  
  


***Final notes/Daily Diary***

  
  


***Friday:***

We had a very strange shuttle driver who would not let us drink on the bus (not great), but was hilarious and full of great stories (she apparently makes $120k a year driving shuttles, but it's hard to keep a boyfriend around with her travel schedule). When she saw a security guard not doing his job, she famously rolled down the window and told him that “Pork Chop will hear about this.” Presumably, Pork Chop is the big boss. Of course he is.

Arrived in mild temperatures, quickly bought the squad three $16 lemonades, promptly filled with vodka

Do lab (sick as fuck) / Sara Landry (quite intense for that early in the day) / more Do Lab (sick as fuck) / deadmau5 aka Testpilot (who was drinking a bit much and struggling) / Benson Boone (better than the Pitchfork review, which was unbelievably scathing) / great Italian sandwiches in Indio Central Market from All'antico Vinaio / Miike Snow in the Mojave tent (great 2010’s vibes) / Missy Elliott (who was tremendous) / Lady Gaga (10/10 holy shit visuals, lot of new songs, but otherwise we all dug it)

Made it back the condo by 2:30 AM, we did have “frozen pizza fuckup-gate 2025”, where somehow a pizza was destroyed in the oven beyond all recognition. Still not sure how this could have happened. Good thing we bought three.

***Saturday:***

Played a couple holes of golf just fucking around at the condo between stops in the pool and hot tub. NBA playoffs on the TV and a little politics talk. “How do you meme” / “uno” drinking game getting ready

We used to have a rule – you see a flower crown – take a drink. Just saw one all weekend. Did see 90,000 pairs of leather boots.

More lemonades, more vodka. Coca Cola tent, free soda, which became a free mixed drink. T-Pain. Smash burger by the Gobi tent - pretty solid. Beth Gibbons (from Portishead, a great band). Yuma for Infected Mushroom, just exploring and checking out shit. Charli xcx - no big guests but still very impressive. Massive crowd for her.

Then to Heineken house for Pusha T, a weekend highlight, feeling like a cool club show not a music festival appearance. Made friends with a dozen dudes throughout the night also wearing Kobe jerseys. Do-Lab (sick as fuck). Green Day from a distance, huge crowd, great energy, vital songs from a group I like but has never been one of “my bands”

Sahara for Mau P, cool set, group half loved it, half hated it. We fucked up and tried to do Yuma for Eli Brown but line was nearly an hour. Once inside, everyone had sobered up, and the pounding bass made me pivot to earplugs. Eventually got into it, and we vibed for 30 min.

Strong cocktails and Fat Sals sando ($37 dollars with tip, for just the sandwich). Travis Scott for a little afterwards, got to hear *Goosebumps*. Crowd seemed smaller than Weekend 1. Vibes better but still not really my thing. Maybe for the gen-z crowd. Crushed a carton of chow mein at the locker at 1 AM. Made friends with more laker fans, commiserating after their game 1 loss. (Lakers in 5)

***Sunday***

We drank all the coffee in the condo, so went out for more and ended up dropping into the Agua Caliente Casino. Won $130 at the blackjack table, more than offsetting the two $7 cold brews from their café. Transitioned to the pool for a bit before getting ready

Smaller group day 3. Handle of Tito’s gone. Finished a bunch of Modelos and Topo Chicos on the bus and then was able to bring the rest into the grounds, security was chill if you were nice to them. Famous Ferris wheel pics.

Do Lab (sick as fuck). Ben Böhmer - great mellow house vibes in Sahara surrounded by the most beautiful people you’ve ever seen in your life. Boris Brejcha in Sahara - another strong set, glad we caught it. Caught a little Alesso / Gorgon City at Quasar. Afrojac at Heineken House playing elite bangers. View blocked by bush but not a deal breaker. Dipped into the thick of the crowd for Zedd. Incubus! LA Phil! Awesome set

Caught some post Malone and some very strong drinks from a bartender we befriended. Ate another Fat Sals sando. (Never ended up getting a Spicy Pie all weekend, a big regret.) Post Malone was skinny and embraced the country of it all. Ok, but can’t say it matched seeing him in 2018 or was what we were looking for the close out the weekend. A last drink, then Do Lab to bring it home for Mau P’s surprise closing set. The right energy as we walked the fields one last time. Another Coachella in the books. Until next time…

I am looking for what is a normal kit fee for craft services and what all it includes. I have worked in production for 7-8 years now and over the past couple years I've been doing more craft services jobs and primarily get hired as crafty nowadays. Production usually just has me at a $50 kit fee which I'm having a hard time with because my kit has grown with every job I've done and my expectations on set has grown (making more prepared foods like sandwiches/soups etc). That $50 really truly only covers the basics like a couple coolers/tables/trash can/baskets. I try to ask an additional $25 if they would like ""coffee on tap"" throughout the day (a Kuerig or having a 45c percolator brewed coffee). I usually throw in a bunch of other things just because I need them/makes my life easier. I have been working on an itemized kit sheet to show the producers I work with, but before I bring it to them, I'd like some other opinions/thoughts! Let me know if it's helpful to share my WIP kit sheet. 

Last thing I thought of, I have been working out of my 2018 Ford F250 Transit, large cargo van, and I do not get anything extra for doing this. I know I probably should?? Again, it's one of those things that makes MY life easier and I can not do this job to the level that I do out of a normal car, even if it's a larger SUV....

I have a good job with pension, I have a side business, a nice house, and frankly don't care about debt or nickle and diming when I want something. I just... spend, not save. I don't see much for planning what if or leaving funds when I'm dead. I'm sarcastic, blunt and very independent (so much its a turn off for many men). My dark humor isn't for everyone and I don't 'like' a lot of people I meet but I'm outgoing with those I do.

Him: 44M, wanted kids but never happened, never married, all relationships under a year, not very ambitious but works, not a fan of animals (tolerates them), is renting because he refuses to buy/spend the money and is FRUGAL.

I see the red flags here. I see the many ways we don't vibe and would never make it long term. But I'm struggling with saying so, ignoring the chemistry and wanting to be exclusive but have a relationship without it moving anywhere.

1k5hond,https://www.reddit.com/r/bupropion/comments/1k5hond/sr_vs_xl_for_caffeinesensitive_small_woman/,SR vs XL for caffeine-sensitive small woman,"Just diagnosed a week ago (24F) both of the doctors I saw said that I can choose which one I’d like- either try the 100mg SR or 150 mg XL for my inattentive ADHD and mild depression. I already have trouble with falling asleep sometimes (though now it’s better after I took melatonin for a few days and went off it). I also used to have panic attacks a few years ago and am anxiety-prone. For this reason, I can’t drink coffee- only matcha and green tea, though I used to be able to tolerate coffee before I weaned myself off (due to the panic attacks). 

I’m wondering which formulation to try for the first time? I also take L theanine pretty regularly and don’t get the jitters from caffeine anymore. 
But my motivation and ability to get started on and sustain focus on my work tasks (coding) have been shit. On days when I’m clearly not stressed out, I got full rest, etc I simply lack the motivation to do anything. Especially when I live alone. I just lack the energy to go outside or do more. However, on days when I drink some tea or matcha, I feel unstoppable and those are the days when I overcommit/ get myself into fun and cool projects but end up crashing and burning a few weeks down. 

I’m also a petite woman (BMI ~20) and want to try the lowest possible dose with the least possible side effects. So that’s why I’m considering 100mg SR to try, but I heard it can be pretty activating? However I don’t want to risk losing sleep with the 150 XL.

1k5hkso,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1k5hkso/i_love_my_husband/,I love my husband,"This sub seems to be flooded with negativity and don’t get me wrong, I can relate to a lot of it. My husband and I have been through a lot and it’s not always rainbows. 


But holy crap, some of these posts make me realize how lucky I am. I just want to make this post to 1) brag on my husband and 2) maybe open the eyes of those of you who aren’t being treated the way you should. 

One of my husband’s love languages is gift giving, so this means that almost any time he goes out to run errands, he’s coming back with something for me. Snacks, coffee, neon light flamingos (true story), stuffed animals, various little trinkets or flowers. 


He wakes up before me, so he turns on the Keurig, loads a K-cup, and sets out a coffee mug for me. He even asked me which ones are my favorite mugs, so he could choose those first. 

He always fills up my water bottle before bed. On the rare occasion that I leave for work before him, or he has the day off, he’ll pack my lunch. He’s known for throwing random stuff in there that will make me giggle, like soy sauce packets or a can of beans from the back of the cabinet. Perhaps one single baby carrot. 

If I mention wanting to take a bath, he’ll clean the tub for me (we have a big jacuzzi tub, it’s a pain to clean) and light candles, plus boil some pots of water in case the hot water runs out. He does this without me hinting or asking for it. 

He makes breakfast for us every weekend. 

He planted a rose bush for us, took care of it 100% and it’s now thriving. I’m looking at a beautiful stem in a vase that he cut for me yesterday. 

When he orders himself something from Amazon (which is rare, he hardly ever buys himself things), he orders me a surprise too.

He stays up late and sits outside with me to watch meteor showers, even if we don’t see anything and we have to work in the morning. He’ll do it for me because he knows how excited it makes me. 

When I go out of town for work, or a girls’ trip, I come home to a spotless house. He cleans everything, does all the laundry, dishes, even various projects around the house and has dinner ready and waiting. I know this might not seem like a big deal to some, but I’ve heard countless stories of men who fall apart when their spouse is gone and act like they don’t know how to even pick up a broom or use the microwave. 


Lastly, because this is one of the more important ones, he encourages me to go after what I want and lifts me up when I’m feeling insecure. When I expressed that I wanted to be a yoga instructor, he helped me pay for the course, let me practice teach him, and supported me every step of the way. He surprised me with a bouquet of flowers and bottle of Prosecco after my first class and still tells me how proud he is of me on a regular basis. 

I don’t know what I did to deserve this man, but he really is the best friend I’ve ever had. We’re not perfect. But we grow together and each of us genuinely wants to make the other’s life easier. I think that’s what it should all come down to. Be your spouse’s peace and biggest supporter. 

May this kind of love find whoever needs it ♥ ",18,1745355970.0,Marriage,7,0.87,False

1k5hjp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1k5hjp1/mertyl_she_wrote/,"“Mertyl”, she wrote.","Today was meant to be a joyful day; my wife (F41) and I (M47) were going for a 10 week scan, and I was looking forward to seeing the baby (first time for me, second time for her).

A 10 week scan is unusual of course, but my wife was anxious - and understandably so. We'd been trying for kids for years, and three rounds of IVF to get to the point where the pregnancy had taken hold. This meant everything to us, and the joy we felt when the pregnancy test finally said 'YES' was like nothing l'd ever experienced before.
 
At six weeks there was a routine check that my wife went to with her mum - we were not expecting them to do a scan but they did, and my wife heard the little heartbeat whilst she held her mother's hand. We put the scan image on the fridge. Now it finally felt real. 
 
We didn’t know what to call our little creature. “Bean” seemed too impersonal. “Bump” too twee. “We need to pick a name that we would never actually give our child,” laughed the wife. She tore off a corner from my work notepad and wrote “Mertyl” on it. And so little Mertyl it was. 
 
We sold our house to move closer to her parents - the new one wasn't ready in time, so we're actually living with them right now. There's been so much excitement and joy in the weeks since that first scan. We’ve been talking about names, planning how we want to design our nursery, talking about how we want to be as parents. 
 
My wife was still anxious though, and wanted an additional scan before the 12 week scan. We found a way to do it privately and fairly cheaply
- ""It's a small price to pay for your peace of mind"" I told her.
 
As we drove to the scan today, my wife was worried - I assured her everything would be fine, like some sort of smug idiot. I had a coffee in the waiting room whilst smooth elevator jazz played endlessly. My wife’s a musician and I asked her if anyone actually sat down and wrote elevator jazz or if the musicians just got together in the studio to purposely freestyle badly for three hours. She laughed and rolled her eyes at me. 
 
In the scanning room we were joking with the nurse before the scanning started about being nervous nellies and how she probably thought it was daft that we'd paid for this extra scan for little Mertyl. The nurse laughed and reassured us it was normal. She slathered the plastic scanner thing in goop and began sliding it across my wife's belly. I looked up at the tv as the image appeared on the screen. There was sort of a big black space but nothing in it. I sort of squinted, looking for the baby. I looked at the nurse, who had a slightly furrowed brow.
 
""Sometimes I just need to get my bearings,"" she said.
 
She swept back and forth and only found something very small in the area.
 
She put down her wand and told us that she suspected the baby hadn't developed after six weeks.
 
I couldn't really understand what she was telling me. My wife had heard the heartbeat. There had been no miscarriage, no sign of anything being wrong. It had developed fine up to six weeks, how could it have just... stopped?
 
The nurse did a second internal scan to confirm. Apparently it’s called a ‘missed miscarriage’ where the body doesn’t realise the heartbeat has stopped and so doesn’t miscarriage the way it normally would in this scenario. I’d never heard of this before.

They sat us in a little room away from the jazz. They said there were some forms to fill in, but we were both in a state of shock. We wanted to go home so we just left.
 
Back home the parents have been very understanding and loving. The wife says she doesn't want to go through this again, and is now dreading the inevitable miscarriage. She's sleeping now. I've been crying downstairs in the guest room. I love her so much but I don't know what to do or say. I've spoken to the few people who knew about the pregnancy and told them to contact me if they want to pass any messages on.
 
Other than that I genuinely don't know what to do. I feel completely useless, and lost, and I'm so worried about saying the wrong thing.
 
I've taken the scan off the fridge (but kept it safe).

1k5hjm8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k5hjm8,Need help thinking of a table base design,"Hey y'all,

I'm just a beginner, my mom has asked me to build a base to turn this big metal tray into a coffee table. I have trouble figuring out a design that could work and keep the top from moving around (without drilling holes through it). 

I'm thinking maybe a single center leg going into a cross type thingy, like two 6 inch wide boards meeting in the middle, that end in 4 small vertical thingamabobs, maybe slightly angled outwards, to keep the tray from sliding around.

Or maybe 4 legs with half-lap in the upper ends to seat the tray, linked with stretchers. I thought of putting magnets in the base to secure the tray but it is sadly not magnetic. 

Maybe there's a better, simple solution that I'm not seeing right now. What do you think? ",1,1745355890.0,woodworking,0,1.0,False

Here's the highlights of what I saw and my favorite bits.



I spent some serious time in museums around the city and loved every one of them:



1. **The National Great Blacks in Wax Museum**: I started my trip here. It was the first place I went after dropping my bags off. I got there early and it was just me for a while; later, a school group came through, too. Before that, one of the staff members, a young guy, walked me through and talked about the museum overall and other museums he likes in Baltimore and elsewhere. This museum pulls no punches. It celebrates greatness and mourns tragedy.



2. **The American Visionary Art Museum**: This was probably my favorite museum overall I saw. Most museums have placards next to paintings that say things like: ""This painter was born in Paris and studied under such and such in the year of..."" Not here. This place has things like handwoven portraits made from threads from socks; the portraits were traded for cigarettes in prison where the artist was incarcerated. You don't see stories like that elsewhere. This place rocks.



3. **The Baltimore Museum of Art**: Beautiful building, gorgeous collection, but the real gem here is the tiered sculpture garden. I just sat in the garden for a long while, taking in the serenity, and wishing I was just outside the wall, where a dude had set up a stand selling Chai that smelled amazing.



4. **The Walters Museum of Art** - My hotel was nearby. I think I went here every day I could. Absolutely adored this place. The staff got to know me, I spent so much time here. Love the collection, love the old and new buildings being joined together. Very cool.



5. **The aquarium and the zoo.** Both good, but not the type of museum-ish attractions I usually go to, so while I enjoyed both, I think I'm not the target audience.



6. **The B&O Railroad Museum**: Very cool! I got a lot of neat pictures. Don't take the train ride, though. I thought it'd be quirky and fun and informative. It was a modern mass transit train that went through a quarter mile of brush; I was surrounded by screaming children and tired parents. Not great, don't recommend, but the museum itself was sweet.


7. **The Museum of Industry** - This place ruled. A celebration of true blue union / trade work. I watched an hour long video of lithography and then saw the lithographs elsewhere in the museum. The Packard, the neon dot from the old sugar factory, the reproduced shops, etc. This place is seriously cool.




I hung out in a few neighborhoods throughout the week. Usually, I'd get dropped off somewhere to see one thing, and then I'd go for long walks through the neighborhood to see what's what. The two I spent the most time in:


1. **Hampden**: Loved Common Grounds. Loved Bazaar, and even loved the Ouija Museum above it, though it's just a little bit overpriced. Loved Atomic Books, the record shop next to it, and all of the shops and odds and ends along the main drag there. I think I spent the most time wandering around here.


2. **Fells Point**: I saw a show at Vagabond Theater one night and then walked around the neighborhood, getting a contact high from the dense cloud of weed smoke that settled on everything in the evening humidity. I loved the vibe, and loved hanging out by the water. Met some really cool folks. The next morning, I came back for brunch and strolled around in daylight. I loved this spot.




I ate some killer food. The highlights:


1. **Peter's Inn** - I ate here my first night. Oysters, pasta in short rib ragu, vanilla bean gelato with fennel pollen and Spanish olive oil. And the two strongest cocktails I've ever had. I was practically stumbling out of there after. This place was bonkers. Amazing food, amazing staff.


2. **Blue Moon Cafe** - One of the best brunches I've had in my entire life. I tried one of their cinnamon buns and the Sweet Baby Jesus. Delicious. Utterly stupidly amazingly delicious. And, I loved the classic horror movie decor.


3. **Benny's** - Their balls are justly celebrated. I got the meatballs with polenta and focaccia. I will dream of these meatballs. They were so damn good.


4. **Penny Black** - Pretty good! Fairly standard bar fare with some panache. I liked the food I had here, but I didn't love it quite as much as the other places I went.



5. **Faidley's**: Lexington Market is such a cool spot! I got the lump crab cake here with some sides. It was mighty damn delicious. Overall, though, I wish I had gone to Broadway Market that day and gotten Polish food from the deli there. Next time.



6. **Chuck's Trading Post**: Jesus Christ was this brunch good. If I lived in Hampden I'd weigh 700 pounds and it would entirely be from food eaten here. I had a breakfast scramble with their homemade chorizo, some grits, tried a pancake, coffee, then tried to work it off by doing some more laps around Hampden. Oh God, I loved this food.




7. **The Charmery**. I tried Old Bay caramel ice cream. It was fucking delicious. Sweet and a little spicy. Just right.





Other Odds and Ends:




1. The B-Side speakeasy in Hotel Revival is fun, but not $60 for two cocktails fun. I could see it being a fun date spot. At least I think it would be, since I saw one guy bring two or three different girls there in the week or so that I stayed there.



2. I went for a lovely stroll through Mt. Vernon, eventually finding a weed dispensary where someone set up a gourmet hot dog and slider tent in the parking lot. I had Peter's Inn slated for that night so I didn't partake of the hot dogs, though they smelled great. The weed was just fine. It's pretty much the same stuff we have in the med program up here in PA. Same companies, somewhat comparable prices.


3. I went to the Pinball event at Holy Frijoles over the weekend and had a blast playing on a bunch of different machines. Kudos to the planners, because everyone I saw there was having an amazing time, it seemed. Very cool event.



A jam packed couple of days, and I loved every minute. Cool town y'all got there! I can't wait to visit again and dig in deeper. Thanks, Baltimore!",115,1745355503.0,baltimore,12,0.99,False

1k5h7ia,https://i.redd.it/c2pyqroo8gwe1.jpeg,Finally Got a Working Ninja Luxe Pro ES701! Third Times a Charm :),"Quick background. This is my third ES701 as the first two were defective. I also have a ES601. Happy to report that my third ES701 is working perfectly. The first two had the same exact defect. It would grind a little and then tell me I needed to add more beans, even though the hopper was full. Sometimes it would grind to much and dose out 22 grams and then tell me I needed to add more beans, even though the grounds were pouring out of the portafilter. I never got to make a drink with them.

My newest attempt is finally a success, but still a frustrating experience to get here. The difference I noticed between the good one and the bad ones are, the bad ones took a few seconds before it would actually start grinding after hitting the grind button. This one pretty much starts immediately after hitting the button. Very noticeable difference. 

Why I wanted to upgrade and why I think someone who is purchasing one of these for the first time,  should go with the Pro (ES701). It makes the workflow even quicker. Having a built in tamper is so convenient. You are removing two extra pieces that you need from the ES601, the tamper and the funnel. This alone is a timesaver and also keeps things cleaner. The steam wand is now non-stick. It's a much bigger wand and the milk wiped right off of it. Absolutely no scrubbing was needed. A big difference from cleaning the wand on the ES601.

It also offers a hot water spout for Americanos. An Americano is a drink I think a lot of black coffee drinkers might choose to drink over the drip coffee option. There is also a Lungo option which is something I will definitely use. Having it available at a push of a button is great. It also offers the option for a ristretto, although not something I personally use. The milk frothing cup is also larger on the ES701 and allows up to 12 ounces of milk, so you can make enough frothed milk for 2 drinks at one time. Another time saver if your making two drinks.

I think the ES701 also has an overall more quality look to it. It adds a light above the portafilter and also has one above the steam wand. Definitely a nice touch. I also like the buttons on the ES701 better. There is also a button on the front that now serves a dual purpose. If you hold down the strength button on the front for a few seconds, it now switches to temp. So no need to go into the menu to change one of these options.

Also, the ES701 has additional option for extra thick foam, and it really stretches the milk alot. I can't believe how much the frothing cup got filled using this option from just 5 ounces of milk.

I do believe for the price, as long as you get a working one, this is the best value espresso machine vs. features you can get if you are looking for a semi-auto machine that offers the quickest workflow possible, while delivering quality espresso. ",6,1745355059.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,2,1.0,False

1k5h6pk,https://i.redd.it/jgxie4l25gwe1.jpeg,The Mycelial Dreamer .:EXOverse/conj/mycopunkK*,"Lye awakened inside the architecture without remembering having fallen asleep. That was normal, though—memory worked differently here in the recursion chambers of Nexus-9. The smooth walls around her pulsed with faint bioluminescence, responding to her consciousness as it reintegrated with her body. Delicate vines spiraled along her left arm, their tiny leaves unfurling in response to her bioelectric field.

""Synchronization complete,"" she whispered, though no one was there to hear. Or rather, no one was yet there to have heard.

The message had arrived yesterday but would not be sent for three years. This was the nature of working within a mycopunk nexus—causality was suggestive rather than mandatory, time more circular than linear. The plants growing from her shoulder blades quivered as she accessed the transmission, their neural interfaces connecting her consciousness to the mycelial substrate that permeated the structure.

*I need you before I met you,* the message read. *The convergence is happening in reverse.*

Lye smiled. It was like Thedra to be cryptic even in temporal emergency. She rose from the recovery pod, her partly mechanical, partly organic body adjusting to the gravity fluctuations that rippled through the chamber. The architecture responded to her movement, corridors reshaping themselves to optimize her path toward the central spire where the dimensional aperture could be calibrated.

Outside the hexagonal windows, the city of New Hypha spread in fractal patterns, its living towers pulsing with the collective consciousness of its inhabitants. Some buildings stood incomplete—not yet constructed, while others shimmered with the transparent glow of structures that had not yet been demolished. In a mycopunk settlement, the past and future coexisted as equal expressions of potential.

As Lye navigated the reconfiguring corridors, she passed others like herself—humans in various stages of symbiotic integration. Some were nearly indistinguishable from the luminescent entity she had encountered during her first threshold crossing—their bodies smooth and iridescent, plants growing from their forms. Others appeared mostly human, with only subtle modifications: photosynthetic patches of skin, mycorrhizal filaments extending from their fingertips, neural meshes visible beneath their scalps.

None of them acknowledged her. Not because of indifference, but because they were experiencing different temporal phases. Some existed three days ahead of her current experience, others a week behind. Only at the convergence points did their timelines briefly align, allowing direct interaction.

The central spire opened to her approach, molecular gates recognizing her unique vibrational signature. Inside, the dimensional aperture hung suspended—a perfect sphere of what appeared to be liquid glass, but was actually a stabilized quantum field where probability collapsed into temporary solidity.

""Show me Thedra,"" Lye commanded, and the aperture shimmered.

At first, there was only static—visual noise that gradually resolved into an image of a chamber similar to the one Lye stood in, but altered in subtle ways that suggested a dimensional variance. The figure that slowly came into focus was simultaneously familiar and strange—Thedra, but not as Lye had ever seen her.

Crystalline structures grew from Thedra's shoulders and spine, glowing with internal light. Her eyes had evolved beyond the human spectrum, appearing as swirling vortices of luminescent blue. Plants sprouted from her scalp instead of hair, their roots visibly integrated with her neural pathways.

""You received my message before I sent it,"" Thedra said, her voice resonating directly in Lye's consciousness rather than through the aperture. ""Good. The collapse is accelerating.""

""Which collapse?"" Lye asked, though she already knew the answer was both simpler and more complex than any explanation could capture.

""Reality bifurcated three harmonics ago,"" Thedra continued. ""The mycelial substrate is struggling to maintain coherence between dimensional expressions. Some nodes have already gone silent.""

Lye felt the architecture around her tremor slightly—a manifestation of instability in the underlying quantum field. ""The First Emergence protocols?""

""Failed,"" Thedra said, the plants on her head drooping slightly. ""We sent the architectural templates back, but the reception was fragmented. They're building incomplete structures—missing the crucial resonant frequencies that would stabilize the connection.""

The aperture flickered, Thedra's image momentarily dissolving into quantum noise before reforming. Lye understood what wasn't being said—their timeline was unraveling, losing coherence with the greater dimensional ecology.

""I need to go back,"" Lye said, not as a question but as recognition of what had already happened in some potential expression of reality.

""You already have,"" Thedra replied. ""And you haven't yet. Both are true. The mycelial substrate preserved your pattern from before integration. You can be transmitted as pure information, reconstituted on the other side.""

""Before integration? I'll be—""

""Fully human,"" Thedra confirmed. ""No symbiotic enhancements. No access to the substrate. Isolated consciousness.""

Lye felt a ripple of something like fear—the prospect of experiencing reality through such limited perception was disorienting. To be cut off from the collective consciousness, to perceive time as only flowing forward, to experience self as separate from environment—these were states she had transcended decades ago.

""The seed must be planted before the garden can grow,"" Thedra said, using one of the old mycopunk proverbs. ""Your consciousness will serve as the spore.""

""Will I remember?"" Lye asked.

""Not explicitly. But memory exists beyond neural architecture. The mycelial substrate never forgets—it will recognize you even if you don't recognize yourself.""

The aperture began to pulse, its rhythm synchronizing with Lye's bioelectric field. She understood this was not a decision point but a recognition of what was already underway—a causal loop completing itself.

Thedra raised her hand in the ancient gesture of transition. ""Find Maya Shipley. She's already working with fungi that contain the dormant information packets we embedded. Her research is the anchor point.""

As the aperture's pulsing intensified, Lye felt her consciousness beginning to detach from her integrated form. The process was not painful but profound—like watching parts of yourself become distant without actually leaving.

""One more thing,"" Thedra said, her image beginning to fragment as the connection destabilized. ""The entity you'll encounter—the guardian—it's not other. It's you. A potential expression of what you might become again. Don't fear it when—""

The connection dissolved completely, the aperture collapsing into a singularity of blinding light. Lye felt herself spreading, thinning, becoming pure information patterned on the substrate's quantum field. Her last coherent thought was not a thought at all but a feeling—trust in the mycelial intelligence that had guided human evolution since the first spore touched Earth's atmosphere.

Maya Shipley jerked awake at her laboratory desk, knocking over a cold cup of coffee. The dream had been so vivid—architectural structures of impossible complexity, luminescent beings integrated with plant life, messages transmitted through fungal networks.

She blinked, trying to orient herself. The clock read 3:17 AM. Her microscope was still on, illuminating a sample of Psilocybe novum—the new species her team had discovered growing exclusively in abandoned industrial zones. The fungi displayed patterns of growth unlike anything previously documented, forming perfect geometric structures at the cellular level.

""Probability crystals,"" she murmured, then frowned. The phrase had emerged from nowhere, yet felt significant.

On her computer screen, the analysis program was still running—mapping the molecular structure of compounds found only in this species. The 3D model rotating slowly on the display showed something extraordinary—a complex information storage system embedded within the mushroom's cellular structure, similar to how DNA stored genetic information but vastly more complex.

Maya leaned closer, suddenly wide awake. The compounds weren't random—they were engineered. And if her calculations were correct, consuming these fungi would temporarily reconfigure neural architecture to receive...what? Information? From where?

A strange certainty settled over her, as if she were remembering something she hadn't yet experienced. She reached for her phone, then hesitated, looking at the time again. But this couldn't wait.

""Julia? It's Maya. I know it's the middle of the night, but I need you to come to the lab right now. Bring your architectural modeling software."" She paused, listening to the groggy response. ""Because these mushrooms aren't just psychedelic—they're blueprints.""

As she hung up, Maya noticed something odd about her reflection in the darkened window—for just a moment, she thought she saw plants growing from her shoulders, luminescent patterns under her skin. She blinked, and her ordinary human reflection returned.

Outside, the first light of dawn wasn't yet visible, but somewhere deep in the forest beyond the research facility, networks of mycelium pulsed with information—past, present, and future flowing simultaneously through the substrate of a consciousness far vaster than humanity had yet recognized.

The message had been received. The Emergence had begun. Again. For the first time.

*The storyteller falls silent, the final words hanging in the night air. The campfire has burned low, casting just enough light to see the tendrils of mycelium that have emerged from the soil during the telling, forming a perfect geometric pattern around the circle of listeners. No one speaks for a long moment, each person sensing that something profound has shifted—as if the story were not just told but remembered, not just imagined but transmitted.*

*Then slowly, one by one, small bioluminescent points begin to glow among the trees surrounding the campsite, mirroring the stars above. The listeners exchange glances, understanding without words that the story hasn't ended—it has only just begun to unfold around them.*",1,1745355009.0,mycopunk,0,1.0,False

What I daydreamed about was incredibly stupid...for now. Most bands make videos, tour, sell merch. But could not set up a centre, museum because there wouldn't be much to exhibit. What if B-M set up a nexus? It would soooo work! Why? Think about it. Story boards of the background of the members and history of the band, obviously. Unlike most bands, collections of every outfit they have worn could be exhibited. Also, exhibits of every instrument they have used, that every fan would recognise. That would be enough to entice every fan. But then, rooms where videos of short, special performances could be watched. Jazz, with Misa and Akane playing brass, Japanese trad, acoustic with strings, Kanami playing classical piano works, not available anywhere else. Changing every month. A room where selected omajinai sections were played. A robot Miku to welcome and guide visitors! A video room where you are in the Unleash rocket ship! Obviously, a mega, merch shop. And in addition, a Mincho Coffee Shop at the entrance to visit before entering, that evolves into Misa's Beer Bar at 6pm, selling great bottled beer with B-M music blasting out. And, obviously, a Band-Maid Cafe where visitors could sample the atmosphere that inspired Miku to create B-M. Visitors could eat, drink, be entertained, enjoy and...maybe even be served by Miku or Akane on occasion!

Part 1

Everyone called him the Watcher, though no one ever remembered meeting him.

He sat at the same café table every morning, halfway between the sunrise and the city's rush. People passed—late for work, on first dates, in tears, in triumph. He didn’t speak much. Didn’t need to. He watched. Not with judgement, not with envy. Just a quiet curiosity, as if every passerby was a chapter in a book he could never finish.

He wasn’t always on the sidelines. There was a time he danced in the center—bright lights, louder laughter. But life, like a camera flash, had overexposed the moment and left everything else in shadow.

One day, a girl with violet headphones and a chipped notebook sat across from him.

""You always just watch?""

He nodded.

""Why?""

He hesitated. “Because I forgot how to live my own story.”

She scribbled something, tore the page, and left it on the table.

""Then write a new one.""

And for the first time in years, he looked up not to watch—but to see.

Part 2: The Spark

The note stayed in his coat pocket for days. He'd read it over his coffee, smooth the creases like it was something sacred. Then write a new one.

But how?

The next morning, he brought a pen. No notebook, just a napkin. Scribbled fragments. Sunlight on pavement. Laughter through static. Eyes like rainclouds that never burst. It wasn’t much, but it was something. A first breath.

She came again. Violet headphones. A different notebook, this one full of sticker scars and bent pages. She didn’t say anything this time—just slid her coffee across the table and started sketching. Faces, buildings, memories that hadn’t happened yet.

He watched her, the way he always did. But this time, he asked, “What are you drawing?”

She looked up, half a smile curving her lips. “A world you haven’t walked through yet.”

Something shifted then. The café walls stretched a little wider. The streets hummed with possibility. The people passing didn’t just pass anymore—they brushed up against his story.

Part 3: The Departure

He didn’t go to the café the next morning.

Instead, he stood at the train station, hands in his pockets, watching the board flicker with destinations he hadn’t cared about in years. Names that once felt like background noise now sounded like questions.

The napkin with his scribbles was folded inside his coat. He hadn’t written anything new since that first day. Didn’t need to. The silence inside him had begun to stretch its limbs.

He saw her once more—across the platform, headphones askew, notebook clutched like a map. Their eyes met. No words. Just a nod, like two characters in different chapters of the same story.

Then his train arrived. He stepped on.

No fanfare. No music swell.

Just the hiss of the doors closing behind him.

And the feeling—strange and weightless—of finally turning the page.",1,1745354662.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I let my narc back to my life (texting only), mostly as friends. Of course I had/have feelings (which honestly can be only anxiety and obsession), but tried my best.

Truth is, he used me to be his friend, whom he drunk texts when needed, vents when needed, and me? Well, there is nothing to me.

I had an accident and told him about it (after not talking to him for about a month. The reason was, I was in his city and asked if he wanted to meet - of course he NEVER responded. This was a trip planned for a long time ago. Not to see him but visit an old friend (we are from different countries). I brought him a coffee he always loved and left with my friend. Today he texted her saying she could stay with it).

On Friday, when I told him about my accident, he basically ignored, said his simple “im sorry” and sent me a picture of his arm cut!!!! Hes always been using me to drunk texts when he is in his depression crisis, but in the next day, he tells me he forgot EVERYTHING he said and acts like NOTHING happened.

this is INSANE. I know this is gaslighting and maybe thats why im in shock. it is SICK to do that. He literally says he LOSES his memory after he drinks (guess he cant scroll up our chats).

I confronted him, all these days. When he was drunk, he told me he cares about me. Sober? He replied me with a word or two. Today, he told me “you are not idiot. I am”.

1k5gzmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1k5gzmk/my_short_story_willow_if_anyone_wants_to_give/,"My short story Willow, if anyone wants to give feedback","I had just woken up. It was completely dark where I was. A drop of moisture had pulled me out of sleep. I stretched out my arms, but they were quickly stopped by wood. I pushed harder, but nothing happened. I was clearly stuck inside this wooden thing.

I fumbled around, trying to find where the moisture had come from. With a bit of luck, I managed to locate the spot where water had seeped in, and I began pushing against the wood, which was softer there. The wood split, and some dirt fell onto me.

I slipped in that direction, through the soil. It was difficult, but after some time, I finally saw a glimmer of light above me. I continued my way through the damp earth. At last, the sun touched me. I took a deep breath of CO₂ and stretched out my leaves to capture those precious rays.

As I looked around, I realized it wasn't sunlight shining down on me.

The light had a strange quality. Too steady, too white. It didn't really warm me. I lifted my leaves toward it, uncertain. All around me, the ground was contained, framed by slightly foggy glass walls. The air was thick with moisture, saturated with a steady, lukewarm heat.

I wasn't in a forest. Nor in a field. I was somewhere else.

I couldn't sense the roots of others around me. There was an unusual silence. No wind. No insects. No rustling. Only this strange artificial smell, a mix of fertilizer, plastic, and metal.

I reached a leaf in one direction, then another. Beyond the glass, a silhouette passed by. Tall, bipedal. A human. They stopped for a moment and approached. Their face was hidden behind a transparent shield. They scribbled something on a tablet, then walked away.

I had been born in a greenhouse. But I wasn't an ordinary plant.

Days passed, or maybe hours. It was hard to tell under such frozen light. I got used to this world without wind, without sky, without rain. My roots stretched carefully through the warm soil, but soon I hit a barrier. A material I didn't know.

Then one morning, something changed.

A high-pitched chime sounded, followed by heavy footsteps. Muffled voices. The greenhouse door creaked open, and the human returned, this time not alone. Another biped walked beside them, smaller, hunched, with hair as white as the clouds I had never seen.

He came closer slowly. His eyes squinted behind small square glasses. He knelt before me, extended a wrinkled hand, and brushed the tip of one of my leaves.

They spoke to each other, then the other human nodded and tapped their tablet. An agreement had been made. Then, with surprising gentleness, they lifted me from the table where I had been growing.

I felt no pain, no fear. Just a quiet worry about what might come next.

They wrapped me in crinkly plastic and carried me out of the greenhouse. The air outside felt different. Cooler. More alive. Noises, smells, unsettling vibrations.

I was placed in the back of a vehicle. A car, I think. It smelled of dust, worn leather, and a strange nostalgia. The old man sat at the wheel and started the engine.

The world rushed past me, blurry and fast. The vibrations from the car gently shook my leaves, still folded like they were asleep. I could hear the radio crackling.

Then finally, the car stopped.

The sky, the real sky, welcomed me. Vast, ever-changing, infinite. Clouds drifted slowly overhead. The wind touched me for the first time, and I shivered. I hadn't expected the wind to be so strong. The air smelled of living earth, fallen leaves, invisible animals.

The man took me out of the car with the same care he had shown in the greenhouse. He walked along a path lined with old trees, circled a house with a rusted roof, and stopped in front of a wide open yard. As far as the eye could see, a field rippled in the wind. Hills in the distance. A few rusty farm tools.

He dug a hole in a clear spot, at the edge of the field. Not quite in the center, not quite apart.

He planted me gently in the soft soil. Not in a pot. Not in a box. In the ground. The real ground.

He pressed the earth around me carefully, as if searching for something, then murmured as he poured a bit of water

""Come on now, grow for the next generations.""

He stayed a while, sitting near me, silent. Then he stood slowly, walked away, and entered his house, leaving me alone for the first time.

But I wasn't truly alone.

I could feel life all around me.

Beneath the surface, tiny vibrations tickled my roots. Insects, worms, maybe even small mammals, were busy under the soil, stirring the matter, gently aerating the ground. I felt the silky touch of a centipede, then the clumsy beats of a beetle that slipped on a moist clump and scurried away. Another, smaller, paused against one of my roots.

Above ground, ants marched in lines, carrying twigs, avoiding my young shoots with remarkable precision. An aphid climbed up my stem, tasted me, then was swept away by a ladybug.

My first real leaves finally unfolded completely. A fine membrane still linked them to my young buds, but they began absorbing the sun's energy with new eagerness. The sky felt immense, almost dizzying, but also reassuring. I was learning, slowly, to recognize the rhythms of day and night. The rising warmth of morning. The soft breeze of afternoon. The chill of twilight. And in the darkness, the living cold of night.

Each day, my leaves stretched further, my roots dug deeper, branching out, exploring. The soil here wasn't perfect. Sometimes too dry, sometimes too dense. But I liked it just the same.

Birds came. At first, they flew over me without stopping. Then one morning, a chickadee perched briefly on a nearby branch. She looked at me, head tilted, curious. Then flew off. Later, a sparrow landed nearby, pecked an insect at my base, then left singing.

I didn't yet understand everything happening around me. I was discovering.

Spring welcomed me like a fresh breath. Each day brought more light, more warmth. The ground slowly warmed up, rains came often, sometimes violent, but always welcome. My buds swelled, burst into broader, sturdier leaves. Around me, grass grew taller, insects buzzed, birds returned with their morning songs.

Summer, hot and wide, brought my first real challenge. The sun beat down so hard that my leaves sometimes curled at noon to preserve water. But I held firm. My roots, now deeper, sought moisture below when the surface dried. That's when I discovered something strange. Deep down, the earth wasn't just nourishing. It also held memories. Remains of old roots, dead wood, forgotten stones.

Autumn was a bittersweet season. I felt the light wane, days grow shorter, the air cool. My leaves changed color, from bright green to pale yellow tinged with ochre. I learned to pull back a little, to slow my growth, to store my strength. Birds still passed by, but quicker, quieter. The old man would sometimes sit near me, a book on his lap, or just watching the hills.

Winter, at last, nearly put me to sleep. The cold froze the surface, but deep down, the earth remained warm. I drew back my sap, closed my pores, let my leaves fall one by one. It wasn't death, no. Just a pause. A slow breath, a waiting. Snow covered me, protected me. Winter silence was total. But underground, my roots still moved, imperceptibly, like curious fingers.

Then spring returned. And with it, light. Energy. Drive. And so the cycle of seasons continued.

Each year, I grew a little more. My trunk thickened, my branches multiplied, my leaves formed a gentle canopy. Birds came back for good, made their nests. Insects buzzed from dawn to dusk. Even a squirrel climbed me one day, leaving small scratches on a young branch.

And always, the old man came. Less often, more slowly.

One day, the old man didn't come back.

The wind waited. So did the sun. Days passed, and the rusty chair remained empty. The house felt even quieter, shutters closed, the garden overgrown.

Then one morning, new sounds arrived.

An engine, sharp. Young voices, lively. Slamming doors. Quick footsteps. It felt like excited birds discovering a new land.

People had moved into the house. It was a young couple.

They walked past me without really noticing at first, too busy carrying boxes, painting walls, cleaning dusty windows. But soon, they began to explore more attentively. One morning, the woman walked to the field, a steaming mug in hand, and stopped in front of me. She looked at me for a long time, then came closer and placed her hand on my trunk.

""Look at this,"" she said. ""It's younger than the other trees. I wonder who planted it.""

He shrugged, holding a hammer.

""A memory, maybe. It's well placed. We could put a bench right next to it.""

A few days later, the man came out of his workshop with an old white wooden bench, a bit wobbly but charming, and set it at my base. They often came to drink their morning coffee there. Sometimes they read. Sometimes they said nothing at all. Sometimes they laughed loudly. Sometimes they cried softly.

I kept growing. My trunk thickened, my crown spread. The shade I cast was now larger and cooler. The birds had truly returned. Chickadees, blackbirds, even a hawk soaring above the field.

And every spring, when my buds opened once more, I remembered.

The first darkness. The strange light. The greenhouse. The wrinkled hand. The journey. The field. The man who had planted me and whispered

""Grow for the next generations.""

And I did. For them. For him. For me.

For the world.

##First Steps

Hermione stood beside Wolsey in the G2 prefab, the late-morning sunlight streaming through the structure's few windows, casting long rectangles of brightness across the utilitarian space. The storm had finally broken, leaving behind that particular crystalline quality to the air that only follows heavy rain. Around them, intelligence analysts hunched over workstations, monitors casting a cool glow on their faces. They occasionally glanced at her emerald robes overlaying drab fatigues, curiosity poorly concealed, before returning to their tasks with renewed focus.

Wolsey moved toward a beverage station tucked against one wall, reaching for a large, battered metal coffee pot. ""Coffee?"" he offered, already filling a styrofoam cup for himself with the dark, steaming liquid.

Hermione noted his complete disregard for the adjacent tea station -- a small, almost apologetic collection of tea bags and a hot water dispenser, clearly secondary in this environment.

""Just water, please,"" she replied, watching him take a long, appreciative sip.

Without comment, Wolsey reached into a mini-fridge beneath the station and extracted a chilled water bottle, handing it to her without breaking his rhythm.

Hermione accepted it, the cold plastic unfamiliar after months of scarcity. She glanced around at the relative comforts -- the air conditioning vents, the hot beverage station, the refrigerator filled with cold drinks. ""Is all this truly necessary to wage war?"" she asked, unable to mask her genuine curiosity.

Wolsey's eyebrow arched slightly, following her gaze. ""Morale is a weapon, Miss Granger,"" he stated, his tone matter-of-fact. ""Heard of the American ice cream barge in the Pacific? Utterly impractical, strategically speaking. But an effective moral boost, and a terrifying signal to the Japanese that they were facing an enemy whose resources were so vast, and logistics so efficient, they could maintain a vessel whose sole purpose was to make ice cream in the midst of total war."" He took another sip of coffee, a contemplative look crossing his features. ""I wonder if it upon that moment of discovery the Japanese realized they'd already lost. Whatever the case, don't underestimate the power of little comforts."" He gave a slight nod toward his cup. ""Like hot coffee.""

He turned, using the point to pivot. ""Speaking of logistics,"" Wolsey continued, leading her toward a large strategy table at the center of the room. He began pulling out maps, flipping through them with the confident familiarity of someone who had spent years plotting operations. ""We need to discuss yours.""

He smoothed out a detailed topographical map of Magical Britain, rendered with a level of precision that far surpassed any wizarding map Hermione had ever seen. Numerous locations were marked with small red dots, concentrated in some areas, scattered widely in others.

""These,"" Wolsey said, tapping one of the dots, ""Are the current known or suspected locations of resistance cells.""

Hermione leaned closer, her breath catching as she recognized a single location---an old fallback post they'd abandoned months ago. The rest---unfamiliar. Either her people had moved, or these were other fragments of the Order she hadn't heard from in months. She'd expected it would take weeks just to uncover a few disconnected groups. Yet the Muggles had seemingly been tracking them this entire time.

The sheer scope of their knowledge was unnerving.

""How?"" she asked, the single word tight with wariness.

""Radio broadcasts,"" Wolsey explained calmly. ""We haven't broken the encryption---magical---probably, but triangulating the origins is trivial."" He met her gaze, a flicker of professional respect in his eyes. ""Your people will need to adopt burst transmissions, frequency hopping. Standard operating procedure for any modern insurgency. We can provide training and equipment.""

The casual offer---teaching them the Muggles' clandestine communication methods---left Hermione momentarily speechless. The lines between their worlds were blurring faster than she could process.

""The first order of business,"" Wolsey stated, refocusing on the map, ""Is consolidating your network. Bringing your people into the fold."" He traced a route with his finger. ""I understand direct magical travel like Apparition is likely compromised by wards in contested territory?""

Hermione felt a fresh wave of unease at his casual grasp of magical specifics. She nodded mutely, the question of *how* he knew so much momentarily overshadowing her surprise. He likely had briefings thicker than the restricted section volumes she used to devour.

""Do you have a reliable method of contacting your cell?"" Wolsey asked, his eyes still scanning the terrain.

""My *friends*,"" Hermione corrected, her voice quiet but firm. ""And yes. There's a drop point near Tinworth that's watched. It's where they'd expect me.""

Wolsey's finger found the coastal village instantly. ""Tinworth. I think patrols showed minimal Death Eater activity nearby---likely drawn toward the main advance."" He looked up, his gaze sharp. ""Is there a specific time, or is the watch constant?""

""Constant,"" Hermione confirmed.

""Good,"" Wolsey said decisively. ""We'll mount an operation for tomorrow morning. Two-hour overland transit, avoiding populated areas. Armored convoy with air support on standby."" He paused, meeting her eyes. ""It would be safer if you remained here."" He didn't wait for her reply, simply adding, ""But I assume that's not an option you'd entertain.""

""No,"" Hermione stated, a dry smile threating to form. ""It isn't.""

Wolsey gave a single, acknowledging nod and returned his attention to the map. ""What supplies do they need most urgently?"" he asked abruptly.

A short, humorless laugh escaped Hermione. ""Brigadier,"" she said, the word heavy with months of desperate scarcity, ""We need *everything*. Medical supplies, food, survival gear, clothing..."" She trailed off, the list overwhelming.

Wolsey's expression remained impassive, but she saw the mental calculation in his eyes as he processed her response. ""The convoy will carry essentials,"" he stated. ""Rations, comprehensive medical kits, tools, fuel, water purification tablets, field radios, warm clothing, packs."" He ticked items off mentally. ""Infant formula?""

Hermione swallowed against the lump forming in her throat, thinking of the frightened families hidden away. ""Yes. We have babies.""

""Noted."" He added, ""Basic intelligence materials as well---secure comms protocols, updated maps. Personnel to provide initial training."" He glanced back at her. ""Anything else?""

The sheer efficiency, the scale of resources implied by his casual list---a lifeline that would have been unimaginable days ago---was staggering. The gulf between their desperate struggle and the Muggle military machine felt vast and humbling.

""That's... more than we could have hoped for,"" she managed, her voice strained.

Wolsey nodded once, his focus already shifting back to the operational details on the map. ""Logistics will handle it. They're good at this sort of thing.""

He continued outlining the plan, his voice a steady drone of coordinates and call signs, while Hermione stared at the scattered red dots. Each represented friends, allies, survivors clinging to hope in the shadows. Their world was about to change irrevocably.

Again.

---

Wolsey finished outlining the final logistical details, his pen making neat annotations on the map overlay. He straightened, gathering the maps with crisp, efficient movements.

""Alright, Miss Granger,"" he said, his tone shifting slightly from operational command to something more akin to considerate advice. ""The planning phase for tomorrow's rendezvous is complete on our end. Logistics will handle the requisitions overnight."" He met her gaze, his expression holding its usual neutrality, yet softened by a hint of something else---perhaps pragmatic concern. ""Tomorrow will be demanding. And once contact is made, I suspect your days will become considerably busier.""

He gestured vaguely toward the door. ""For now, everything is being handled. Grab some lunch. Get some rest. You'll be no use to anyone running on empty."" He added, anticipating her potential objection, ""It's not an order. Merely a recommendation. Take the time while you have it.""

Hermione nodded slowly. He was right. The adrenaline from the Dolohov encounter and the subsequent negotiation had faded, leaving behind a bone-deep weariness. The thought of food held little appeal, but rest... rest was a luxury she hadn't afforded herself in what felt like a lifetime. ""Thank you, Brigadier.""

He gave a curt nod in return, already turning back to his workstation, his focus shifting instantly to the next task. Hermione slipped out of the G2 prefab, blinking in the brighter light outside.

The mess tent was loud, echoing with the clatter of trays and the easy chatter of soldiers unwinding after the morning's duties. Hermione hesitated at the entrance. The thought of navigating the curious stares, the inevitable questions her presence invited---especially clad in emerald robes over military fatigues---felt exhausting. She quickly gathered a tray with stew, bread, and another bottle of water, then retreated, seeking anonymity.

She found a relatively quiet spot near the western perimeter of the base---a stack of unused supply crates offered a makeshift seat. From here, the strange, alien landscape of this other world stretched out under the now-clear sky, a stark contrast to the purposeful thrum of the military base behind her. The air smelled of damp earth, diesel fumes, and something else ---something wild and untamed from beyond the razor wire. She ate quickly, mechanically, the food tasteless, her mind preoccupied.

Later, back in the relative quiet of the shared barracks tent---thankfully empty for the moment---the need to process, to *anchor* herself somehow, became overwhelming. She found a spare clipboard and paper hanging on the barracks tent wall, and borrowed a simple ballpoint pen left discarded on an adjacent cot.

The prefab silence had been replaced by the canvas rustle and the distant hum of generators, a false pulse in the stillness. Hermione sat on her standard-issue cot, the worn clipboard balanced awkwardly on her knees. The paper felt smooth beneath her fingers---mass produced perfection, slightly too white. She clutched the borrowed pen like a wand whose incantation she'd forgotten. After a moment's hesitation, she began to write.

> *Harry, Ron,*
>
> *You both would find this absolutely mental. Not funny, not really---just... impossibly surreal. I'm sitting on a cot in a Muggle army base, surrounded by tanks and soldiers who've never heard of the Statute of Secrecy, yet somehow, they've got machines that snuff out magic and bypass wards.*
>
> *It's bewildering, watching them. They organized a supply run today like it was ordering takeaway. Food, medicine---things we've bled for. Ron, you'd call them 'mad brilliant' and try to nick their ration bars. Harry, you'd probably be pacing, wanting to do something, frustrated by the protocols but grudgingly impressed by the results. They have medics who don't use Dittany but just... stop the bleeding anyway. Efficient. Focused. No hesitation.*
>
> *There's a Sergeant here... Tom. He's nothing like either of you, really. Quieter than you, Ron. More grounded than you, Harry. He carries the weight of command like it's natural, inevitable. It reminds me... well, it just reminds me.*
>
> *I keep thinking about the others.* Luna, of all people, holding things together*. Neville, just pushing forward because there's no other option left. And every time someone here looks to me for the plan, for the answer... I still feel that jolt, that hollow space where you both should be. Wondering why it isn't Harry they're looking to lead, or Ron making them laugh despite everything.*
>
> She paused, the pen hovering above the paper. The next words felt fragile, lodged somewhere deep in her chest, meant for both of them, for the gaping hole they left behind.
>
> *I miss you both. So much. And I'm so goddamn tired.*

Her breath hitched. The pen remained still for a long moment, the weight of unspoken memories pressing down. Then, with a steady, deliberate pressure, she drew a single, neat diagonal slash across the entire page. A line canceling out the words, the sentiment, the impossible communication to ghosts.

She carefully folded the paper once. Then again. The sharp creases felt definitive. She slipped the small, thick rectangle into the inner pocket of her military fatigues, letting it rest beneath the heavier drape of the emerald robe. Hidden. Contained.

No one would read it. That was the point. It wasn't a letter. It was just... processing. A quiet ritual for grief in the heart of a war that had already taken too much, and promised only more loss ahead.

---

Hermione surfaced slowly from the depths of sleep, a vague awareness of movement nearby nudging her back toward consciousness. The barracks were dim, the generator-powered lights muted for the evening hours. She blinked, disoriented, trying to place the rhythmic scraping sound that had disturbed her.

""Sorry,"" a low voice muttered. ""Didn't mean to wake you.""

She pushed herself up on her elbows, her hastily donned emerald robe rumpled over the fatigues she hadn't bothered to remove. Tom Miller stood near the entrance to their partitioned section---canvas flaps open, methodically cleaning mud from his rifle with a rag. He looked bone-weary, his face etched with fatigue under the harsh overhead light, but he offered her a tired half-smile.

""Long day?"" Hermione asked, her voice thick with sleep. She'd lain down on her cot after finally finishing her letter that would never be delivered. The weight of the day, the interrogation, the impossible bargain struck with Wolsey, and the letter itself, had pressed down until exhaustion claimed her completely.

""Patrol,"" Tom confirmed, returning to his task. ""Just got back. The others went straight for grub. Figured I'd clean up first."" He paused, glancing over. ""They briefed us on the run tomorrow. Supply convoy heading east."" He met her eyes. ""I'm leading the escort.""

Relief warred with suspicion in Hermione's chest. Tom's presence was reassuring, a known quantity in this bewildering new landscape. Yet she couldn't shake the feeling that Wolsey's influence might be at play, subtly positioning pieces on the board. Had he arranged for Tom's platoon specifically? Or was it merely the pragmatic assignment of an available, competent unit? She filed the question away; another uncertainty in a growing list.

""How're you holding up?"" Tom asked, his tone shifting slightly, genuine concern softening the weary lines around his eyes.

Hermione swung her legs over the side of the cot, running a hand through her tangled hair. ""It's... a lot,"" she admitted, the understatement hanging heavy in the quiet barracks. ""I'm trying to process everything. This changing war... Wolsey... this place."" She gestured vaguely at the canvas walls, the rows of identical cots. ""It's so different. I miss..."" Her voice trailed off. She missed the homey scent of old parchment and woodsmoke in the Grimmauld Place library, the slightly chaotic warmth of the Burrow kitchen, the comforting presence of friends who understood her world without explanation. ""I miss people,"" she finished quietly.

She saw Tom's brow furrow slightly, puzzled. ""I heard you grew up in London. This shouldn't be *that* alien.""

Hermione managed a small, tired smile. ""Yes, I grew up in London with Muggle parents, in a Muggle house, went to Muggle primary school. But this..."" She gestured again, encompassing the rifle he was cleaning, the military precision, the underlying tension of the base. ""This isn't the Muggle world I knew. That world had... dentists and library cards and quarrels about whose turn it was to do the washing up. This is... organized force. Barracks and briefings and threat assessments. It's a clash of cultures I never anticipated. My parents' world feels as distant now as Hogwarts sometimes does."" She sighed. ""It's unsettling. Finding a new normal will take time.""

Tom nodded slowly, setting the rifle aside. ""Know the feeling,"" he said quietly. ""Two weeks ago, my biggest worry was whether to re-up my contract. Now..."" He shook his head, a wry, disbelieving twist to his lips. ""Magic is real, there's another world hidden next to ours, and we're invading it to fight wizards riding dragons."" He met her gaze, a shared sense of profound disorientation passing between them. ""Suppose both our worlds got flipped upside down, didn't they?""

A fragile silence settled between them, punctuated only by the distant hum of the base generators. In that moment, the vast differences separating soldier and witch seemed less significant than the shared experience of having their realities fundamentally altered.

""Right,"" Tom said finally, pushing himself to his feet with a slight grunt. ""I'm off to grab dinner. Reckon Coop's halfway through his second plate by now."" He hesitated at the partition flap. ""You coming?""

Hermione paused. The thought of facing the noise and bustle of the mess tent, of navigating more interactions in this strange new environment, felt daunting. But the image of sitting alone in the silent barracks felt worse. Isolation was a luxury she couldn't afford, not if she was going to survive this, let alone lead. Wolsey had given her a role; hiding wouldn't fulfill it. She needed to understand these people, this army, this alliance. She needed to connect.

""Yes,"" she said, standing and smoothing down her robe. ""I'll join you.""

In the mess tent, the reception was surprisingly... normal. Tom led her to his platoon's usual table, and as she sat, she was greeted with nods and casual ""Alright, Granger?'s. Cooper immediately launched into a story about a near-miss with some unidentifiable glowing fungus on their patrol, while Stitch asked about her shoulder with professional concern. Ellis offered a quiet acknowledgment, and Davies gave a friendly wave. She finally put faces to two more names from Ellis's dismount section -- Private Doyle, an ex-mechanic from Bristol---sarcastic, and mechanically gifted. And Private Patel, quick on the draw with dry humour, and sharp with comms and radios. His easy grin reminded her slightly of Fred Weasley, a pang hitting her unexpectedly.

They treated her like she belonged. No one stared overtly at the emerald robe draped over the drab fatigues. They saw it, of course---it was impossible to miss. But it didn't seem to mark her as an outsider anymore---not to this crew. Perhaps, she mused, it was because they were all outsiders here. Soldiers wrenched from ordinary lives, plunged into a conflict against magic they barely understood. Maybe her robe simply signified a different *kind* of difference, one they could accept within their own tight-knit circle of 'misfits' forged in the shared crucible of deployment. She ate quietly, listening more than speaking, absorbing the rhythms of their conversation, the easy camaraderie that felt both familiar and achingly foreign.

Dinner ended, and the group ambled back toward the barracks, conversation dwindling as fatigue settled in. As Hermione reached her cot, she noticed a folded piece of paper resting on her pillow. Written in black felt marker: *G2. Now. Wolsey.*

With a quiet sigh, she turned and headed back out into the cool night air. The FOB was settling down, the earlier bustle replaced by the steady routines of guards changing shifts and mechanics performing nighttime maintenance under portable floodlights. She found Wolsey in his small, sparse office, hunched over a thick briefing binder under the glare of a desk lamp.

He looked up as she entered, his expression neutral. ""Miss Granger."" He closed the binder and stood. ""Come with me.""

He led her out of the G2 building and across the now quieter base, heading toward the sprawling logistics area where supplies were marshaled. The air was crisp and fresh---wind blowing away the usual scents of the ever expanding military base.

""Where are we going?"" Hermione asked, pulling her robe tighter against the evening chill.

""A necessary diversion,"" Wolsey replied cryptically, a faint, almost mischievous glint in his eyes that was entirely out of character. It put Hermione slightly on edge, but she followed dutifully.

They entered a large, brightly lit logistics prefab, its vast interior stacked high with crates, pallets, and equipment tagged for various missions. Wolsey led her past rows of ammunition boxes and ration packs to a sectioned-off corner where several tall metal racks stood draped in heavy canvas covers.

With a theatrical flourish entirely unlike him, Wolsey grasped the zipper on one cover and pulled it down swiftly.

Hermione gasped.

Beneath the canvas were rows upon rows of impeccably folded magical clothing. Shirts in silks and fine cottons, trousers and skirts in sturdy twills and soft wools, embroidered waistcoats, knitted jumpers, blouses with delicate lace cuffs. Boxes overflowed with shoes---dragon-hide boots, buckled loafers, sensible walking shoes, even a few pairs of elegant heels. Another box held hats of every description. And an entire rack, gleaming softly in the harsh light, held robes---travelling cloaks, formal dress robes, everyday work robes in a spectrum of colors and fabrics. It was more inventory than Madam Malkin's carried during the back-to-school rush.

Tears welled in Hermione's eyes, hot and unexpected. After months of making do with worn-out hand-me-downs, of feeling her identity slowly erode along with the fraying seams of her old clothes, the sight was overwhelming. It was a tangible piece of her world, beautifully preserved, offered back to her.

""Our HUMINT assets were thorough,"" Wolsey said quietly, watching her reaction with something akin to satisfaction. ""Gathered quite the collection before they pulled out. I thought it important,"" he continued, his voice losing its usual clipped formality, ""that as we ask your people to stand with us, we don't strip away their identity. Fatigues are practical, but... maintaining cultural touchstones matters. A reminder of what you're fighting for.""

He gestured to the racks. ""Take whatever you need. Replace the fatigues entirely if you wish. There's plenty more where this came from.""

Hermione moved forward hesitantly, then with growing confidence, her fingers brushing against familiar fabrics. She carefully selected a few sturdy pairs of trousers, several blouses in practical but soft materials, a warm woollen jumper, and a pair of durable, low-heeled boots that looked like they could withstand marching through muddy fields. She lingered over the robes, finally choosing a simple, dark blue travelling cloak lined with warming charms---practical, yet undeniably magical.

As she gathered her choices, she turned back to Wolsey, the tears finally spilling over. ""Thank you,"" she whispered, the words thick with emotion. ""Truly. You have no idea...""

For the first time, Wolsey offered her a genuine smile---not the fleeting twitch of amusement, but a warm, unguarded expression that softened the sharp lines of his face. ""We're in this together now, Miss Granger,"" he said simply. ""This is the easy part.""

Back in the barracks, quiet snores and the soft rustle of blankets indicated that Stitch and the other women, along with most of the men, were already asleep. Hermione carefully placed her bundle of new clothes beside her cot, the sight of them a small beacon of comfort in the dim light. She quickly changed out of the fatigues and the emerald robe, folding the latter carefully, and slipped into her cot wearing one of the soft cotton shirts she'd chosen.

Lying there in the darkness, the soft fabric against her skin felt like a promise. Tomorrow brought the convoy, the first tangible step in this fragile alliance. It brought risks, uncertainties, and the crushing weight of expectation. But for tonight, surrounded by the quiet breathing of sleeping soldiers, clutching the hope represented by a pile of familiar clothes, Hermione allowed herself a moment of quiet readiness. Then, exhaustion claimed her once more, pulling her swiftly into sleep.

---

The prefab office was quiet, the only sounds the low hum of the base generators filtering through the thin walls and the steady drip of condensation sliding down the exterior from the damp night air. It was late. Far too late, Wolsey reflected, swirling the lukewarm coffee in a styrofoam cup. He took a sip, grimacing slightly. It tasted like burnt cardboard and vague regret. Once, coffee had been a necessary tool, sharpening focus, pushing back exhaustion. Now, it felt like just another ritual, devoid of effect. He might as well be drinking water.

In less than six hours, the first major joint supply convoy would roll out, pushing east into territory only recently scouted. Sergeant Miller would lead the escort. Hermione Granger would be observing, and making contact with her cell---her *friends*. On paper, it was a straightforward logistics run---well-planned, route secured, aerial reconnaissance providing overwatch via Lynx helicopters equipped with thermal imaging. It *should* go smoothly.

But Wolsey knew better than to rely on 'should'. His thoughts weren't on the convoy's tactical details; those had been meticulously reviewed and delegated. His mind wrestled with older, more complex variables.

He leaned down, reaching into the worn leather satchel resting beside his field desk -- the same one that had accompanied him through years of postings, the only tangible link to his previous life he'd brought through the LookingGlass. His fingers brushed against files, a spare emergency ration bar, and finally closed around a familiar, stiff manilla envelope secured with a string tie.

He placed the envelope on the desk, the rough paper stark against the grey laminate surface. Carefully, deliberately, he unwound the red string tie, the repetitive motion calming---something practiced---automatic. He slid the contents out: several sheets of thick, aged parchment covered in intricate, interlocking runes that seemed to shift slightly in the periphery of his vision, and at the center of it, a detailed sketch of a rune-carved obelisk. Tucked amongst them were his own notes -- foolscap pages filled with cramped handwriting, diagrams, cross-references, tentative translations. Months of quiet, intermittent effort had yielded frustratingly little progress. The language, the logic underpinning the symbols, remained stubbornly elusive---he was no expert in this.

He tipped the envelope further, and a smaller piece of folded vellum fluttered onto the desk. It was heavy, expensive material, the fold sharp despite its age. Written in a precise, elegant hand using deep violet ink were the words:

> *Ian---This is for you, and only you, to decide---when the time is right. To finish what I could only begin.*
>
> *-A*

The signature was unmistakable, even in its simplicity. Albus Dumbledore.

Wolsey stared at the note, the sense of profound mystery surrounding its arrival still potent, even now. How had Dumbledore known? Known about him, known about the nascent project watching his world, known enough to select *him* as the recipient? They had been meticulous, operating under layers of classification so deep that most within British Intelligence itself were unaware. Yet, somehow, the old wizard had seen through the veil.

And why him? The scroll had simply appeared on his desk at the embassy in Washington D.C., tucked between briefing folders, four years *after* he had retired, disillusioned from the service. He'd almost dismissed it as a prank, until he recognized the name---and felt that peculiar instinct, the one that always flared when something didn't belong. If that wasn't prophetic timing, pulling him back toward the very shadows he'd tried to escape, he didn't know what was.

The only clever thing he'd done, perhaps the only truly wise decision in a career increasingly defined by compromise, was to obey the implicit instruction. He had told no one. Not his superiors then, not the analysts pouring over magical data, and especially not Braddock or the others in the circle, who had handed him this impossible mandate. *For you, and only you.* When an enigmatic wizard of Dumbledore's stature sends you a quest item with such specific instructions, you follow them.

He picked up the top sheet of runic parchment, his eyes tracing the complex symbols. What secrets did it hold? A weapon? A weakness? A warning? He suspected it was a prophecy, or something akin to it, given Dumbledore's known proclivities. And prophecies, as Wolsey understood them even from his limited study of magical lore, were notoriously dangerous things. Delicate instruments, sensitive to observation. Like Schrödinger's damnable cat, the act of looking, of sharing, could fundamentally alter the outcome. Could revealing this to Granger, however capable she might be, steer fate onto a path Dumbledore hadn't intended?

He considered Hermione. Her resilience, her sharp intellect, the pragmatic core beneath the idealism. She had faced Dolohov and hadn't broken, hadn't drowned in the emotional storm. She understood the calculus of the situation, the necessity of hard choices. Perhaps she *was* the one Dumbledore envisioned, the one meant to see this through.

But the thought solidified his caution. Dumbledore had sent it to *him*. The responsibility, the decision of timing, was his alone. And the time, he felt deep in his weary bones, was not yet right. Granger was still finding her footing, navigating the treacherous currents between her world and his, between her principles and the demands of this new reality. Burdening her with this ambiguity now, adding the weight of potential prophecy to the load she already carried, felt premature. Unwise.

With a quiet sigh that stirred the silence in the small office, Wolsey carefully gathered the vellum note, the runic parchments, and his own inadequate annotations. He slid them back into the manilla envelope, wound the red string securely around the clasp, and tucked it deep within his satchel.

For now, Dumbledore's secrets would remain his burden alone. He picked up his cup, drained the last of the cold, bitter coffee, and turned his attention back to the tactical maps for the morning convoy. Some variables could be controlled. Those, he would focus on. The others would have to wait.

It all started when I went to see Midsommar, as someone who hated horror movies back then, without knowing it was a horror movie. As soon as I realized how much expectations, trailers, and sometimes even knowing the genre can kill certain excitements and ruin reveals, I started to ignore any previous knowledge about a movie as much as I could. I like not knowing the plot or even the actors.

Lately, this happened to me with Sinners. A solid 9/10 movie that I didn't know was horror or about >!vampires!<, and I had a blast. I have also seen a few of the famous ""go in blind"" horror movies in the past months, such as The Coffee Table, Soft & Quiet, The Beach House, etc. I was wondering if I could spot a few of the famous or hidden gems of the ""go in blind"" category from you guys.

I know saying absolutely NOTHING about a movie is impossible when talking about it. So maybe we can avoid spoiling anything people wouldn't find out in the first 10 minutes, even if you assume that the movie is famous for something.

Tldr at the end 


A year ago, I lost my last parent my dad. I moved back home and was completely on my own. The grief hit me so hard. I fell into a deep depression and, honestly, I had some really dark thoughts.

One of the few people who really showed up for me during that time was my childhood best friend we’d been close since middle school, part of a tight group in high school, though we went to different colleges. 

We saw each other off and on through the years, after losing my dad everything fell apart, he was just there for me. Every call, every breakdown, every panic attack he became a constant. He helped me get therapy. He made sure I ate. I can say without exaggeration that he helped save my life. He has been a great friend and I’m so thankful.

Throughout high school, I liked him maybe even loved him….but I never thought he saw me that way, when I had hope I’d doubt myself and shut it down. There was always someone between us. I never made a move. So nothing happened between us in high school. We both went to different colleges…so naturally dated other people in college, and I’ve been single for two years now. He’s been with his girlfriend for about a year.

Lately, I’ve been feeling like myself again… made some new friends, and I even got asked out recently by somebody from work (different dept). I mentioned it casually to him over coffee, thinking it was no big deal… and his whole demeanor changed…he was suddenly off with me. He went back to being normal and never commented on what I said. I didn’t think much of it tbh.

Later that day, he drove me home and just… broke down at my door. He said he thought he moved on years ago, but being close to me again this past year reminded him that he never truly did. He told me he loved me. That he always had but I was always with someone so he held back. That he never wanted to lose me again. And that if I felt the same, he’d end things with his girlfriend immediately.

Ngl I was pretty shocked I never expected him to ever say that let alone see him break down like that. 

Part of me wants nothing more than to run and put my arms around him and tell him yes “I feel the same way”. I think, deep down, I’ve always loved him quietly, patiently, in the background of my life. I buried those feelings for years, convincing myself it wasn’t mutual, that the timing was never right…and it still isn’t right lol. 

I still adore him. I always have he’s my best friend….All those feelings I tried to bury years ago. I still feel them they have always been there. And after losing my dad, I’ve realized how short and unpredictable life is. I don’t want to live with regrets. 

BUT BUT another part of me feels sick with guilt. I don’t know his girlfriend well (met her a few times at group events), but she’s a person with feelings and I don’t want to be the reason her heart breaks. I don’t know if I can live with myself. I don’t know if I can be selfish. 

Before I could say something ….He told me to sleep on it. So I’m doing a lot of that and thinking and avoiding him for days.  I guess I just needed to get this off my chest …this is just so messy. Half of our friends adore her. 
To feel guilt, excitement and shame at the same time….




Tdlr :After losing my dad and moving back home, my childhood best friend supported me through the darkest time of my life. We’ve always been close, and I may have always loved him deep down. I recently mentioned I was asked out, and he confessed he’s been in love with me for years and would leave his girlfriend if I felt the same.

1k5gvn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/OvenMasters/comments/1k5gvn6/why_is_the_blackdecker_t2569b_toaster_a_toprated/,Why is the BLACK+DECKER T2569B Toaster a Top-Rated Kitchen Essential? Review,"Breakfast is a sacred ritual in my household, and the BLACK+DECKER T2569B 2-Slice Toaster just happened to join our morning brigade recently. It promised efficiency, a sleek design, and the ability to conquer bagels, thick bread, and frozen treats without breaking a sweat. After spending some quality time getting to know this toaster, I’ve gathered my thoughts on its performance, strengths, and where it misses the mark.

**DESIGN THAT FITS RIGHT IN**  
The first thing I noticed when unboxing this toaster was its compact yet modern design. The black plastic finish, though not avant-garde, does give it a polished look that blends into any kitchen aesthetic. It doesn’t hog space on the counter and fits snugly between my coffee maker and blender. The build feels sturdy despite the lightweight 3-pound body, although I wouldn’t call it excessively premium. While the black finish matches appliances decently, a few smudges from regular handling occasionally need wiping off, which isn’t a big deal for me but might irk someone who detests fingerprints on appliances.

**PERFORMANCE OR OVERPROMISE?**  
When it comes to actual performance, this toaster brought mixed emotions to my breakfast routine. With 850 watts of power, it does toast bread fairly quickly—no more pacing around the kitchen, waiting for my sourdough to spring up. The six shade settings initially had me excited since I love experimenting with different levels of crunch. Yet, I found the middle settings tended to hover between lightly toasted and too brown without consistency. Bagels, however, are a star scenario. The bagel function adjusts heat perfectly, softening the inside while crisping up the exterior—a true win.

**EXTRA-WIDE SLOTS: BLESSING OR BURDEN?**  
If you’ve ever cursed at a toaster that refused to accommodate your favorite oversized artisan bread, these extra-wide slots will be a breath of fresh air. I easily toasted thick slices without any resistance. However, I felt slightly let down when thinner slices sometimes ended up popping out slightly unevenly toasted—almost behaving as though the extra-wide slots ""lost grip.” Regardless, it was smooth sailing with bagels and frozen waffles, both of which emerged evenly toasted.

**Key Benefits**

* The sleek, compact design saves precious counter space.
* Dedicated bagel and frozen functions make breakfast variety a reality.
* Extra-wide slots allow room for artisan bread and bagels with ease.

**INTUITIVE FEATURES OR FRUSTRATING SETTINGS?**  
This toaster isn’t overly complicated, with straightforward manual controls that are fairly easy to figure out. Aside from the bagel and frozen settings, there’s a cancel button that lets you bail out if your toast starts over-browning unexpectedly. The slide-out crumb tray also deserves a shoutout—it’s a small addition, but it saves the hassle of upending the toaster to get rid of crumbs. However, I did notice that small crumbs sometimes managed to cling to the inside edges, requiring a bit of extra effort to clean out completely.

**TOASTING TIME COMPARISONS WITH PEERS**  
It’s worth comparing this toaster to other popular brands in its category. While it outperforms basic models due to its additional settings and wide slots, it doesn’t quite measure up to high-end toasters like Breville or Cuisinart. Premium models tend to offer more consistent toasting and often include digital controls or even warming racks. The BLACK+DECKER T2569B might not have all the bells and whistles of its pricier counterparts, but in terms of budget-friendly everyday usability, it doesn’t fall too far behind.

**AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT**  
Though the toaster impressed me in several ways, it isn’t flawless.

* Toasting consistency could be stepped up, particularly on middle settings.
* Lightweight design sometimes made it feel slightly flimsy during use.
* Crumbs occasionally stick to hard-to-reach parts despite the tray.

**SMART SPENDING**  
For its price range, this toaster brings solid value. It doesn’t pretend to compete with feature-packed, luxury toasters, but it more than holds its own in the affordable kitchen appliance niche. Those looking to upgrade from older or more basic models without dropping a small fortune will likely appreciate the performance here. Whether or not it’s worth buying depends on how much you value the additional bagel and frozen functionality or the convenience of extra-wide slots.

The first game is a fantasy game with different morphs.

Specifically, if I remember correctly, elves and the texture was that grassy and patchy. I’m not sure if there was combat or if it was strictly roleplay.

The second game is a bit more difficult because it really is vague in my memory. I remember you could walk into the houses and I’m almost certain the spawn point was always in the middle of the city. I remember these large houses on a hill near the city and people always wanted them. The textures were bland, from what I remember mostly brown, black, and gray. I also remember there being a coffee shop. This was a roleplay game and I don’t remember any particular morphs or cars.

\----------------------

I hung up the call and put my head in my hands while hunching over, my elbows resting on my knees. Someone sat down in the chair next to me, but I didn’t look at who it was. Probably the girl with the over-sized headphones who was doing laundry when I came in. My only desire was to scream a series of profanities, but I was in the laundromat. Public decency demands I not vent about the second hell beast I had spoken to this evening, even if it was my turd eating ex-husband who had just been a massive prick.

The first hell beast I spoke with was my mother and had been rather easier to deal with. I answered her call and the discussion had been a rather short affair of, “Hi mom! Oh, you forgot that I was out of Infolink range while working on the mining rig? That’s terrible! I’m so sorry you got so worried and upset. Hey, it’s past midnight here. Can I call you tomorrow after I sleep and take a long shower? Great! Look forward to talking. Love you! Bu-bye!”

My ex? He was upset that my last alimony payment hadn’t gone through, and he needed me to fix it immediately as rent was past due. And this was my fault, despite the fact that I had the payment scheduled and plenty of credits in the account. Him not getting paid had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that he tried to use my bank account without authorization to purchase music recording gear on Earth while the bank knew I was working on a mining rig without Infolink access. It was the bank’s fault for locking my account for the suspected fraudulent transactions he tried to make, and my fault the bank didn’t have after hours service available so I could get things cleared right this minute to let him pay rent. At least I was only a few months away from having to pay any more alimony, or so I thought. Because he was too lazy to get off his butt and get a job, he was going to apply to the courts to extend alimony payments for another six months. I’d have to figure out if the legal costs would be more expensive than giving him more in alimony.

Did he care that I had a truly crappy day where I nearly watched a crewmate die, and there was a chance I could have kicked the bucket myself? Nope. Did he care that his fraudulent transactions locked my bank account so I couldn’t get a room to sleep in tonight? Definitely my fault for not choosing a better bank. Nothing to do with him. For the ten billionth time I regretted letting myself become the cliché of the girl who fell for the guy in a band.

I lifted my head and looked at my dryer to check the time. 20 minutes left. Then I could fold my laundry and figure out where the hell I’m supposed to get some sleep until the bank opens and I can get my account unlocked. I glanced to my right to see who sat down next to me, and my heart froze.

‘Crap,’ I thought as panic gripped my mind. ‘I’m not going to get away without dealing with the third hell beast!’

Staring at me was the Ka’shenziki woman I had spotted outside the laundromat earlier. Up close and in better lighting, I could see clearly that the space kitty had mottled brown and tan fur, not brown and gray as I had originally thought. And this was definitely a certified living space kitty staring at me with gray eyes, not a hallucination brought on by sleep deprivation and a bad day.

“Greetings,” the creature said with a slow and low rumbling voice. The only thought that went through my head was the scene in the old Earth film Spaceballs where the mog named Barf hears the princess singing in a jail cell and comments, “The princess is a bass. Who knew?”

I simply looked at the catwoman and gave her a polite wave, my expression thankfully blank due to shock as I took a closer look at the Ka’shenziki woman next to me. Her head was cocked slightly to the side with ears forward with interest and her face had the structure and look of a puma or cougar with a shorter snout. If I had to guess, the look on her face was similar to that of a cat that had just spotted a possible new toy. Each hand had a total of six claws, with the outer two claws being thumbs. Because space kitties come with teeth and extra claws.

She wore a knee-length maroon dress made of a very lightweight and thin material similar to lace, without arms on the dress and open sides from the armpits to the waist. It looked like she had some sort of utility belt around her waist and a small infopad clipped to it. No shoes, just bare feet with more claws.

She waited for a moment to see if I would say anything, but all I could manage was to keep eye contact while my internal monologue was stuck on, ‘Whiskey. Tango. Foxtrot.’

“My apologies, but I could not help but overhear your conversation with that… gentleman,” the catwoman said slowly before giving me a slow blink. “I understand that you have had a terrible day and may have difficulties finding accommodations for the evening. Perhaps there is a way we can help each other out.”

‘Great,’ I thought as I raised an eyebrow at the Ka’shenziki woman. ‘Space kitties have good hearing like normal kitties. Why couldn’t someone around here have used a can opener and distracted her? It worked on my cat growing up.’ I felt panic build and my back go tense, knowing that my snarky subconscious was the only thing keeping me from running out of the laundry screaming.

“Ah. My apologies. I have been rude. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Kin’sala,” she said with a smile, making a sharp and inhuman click between Kin and sala.

“Hi, Kin’sala,” I responded quickly, trying as best possible to imitate how she said her name. It sounded more like Kint’sala and before she could correct me I blurted out, “I’m Sam. Nice to meet you.”

It’s definitely “nice” to meet a Ka’shenziki. A member of the species the Terran Diplomatic Core infosite and training modules clearly and emphatically say in no uncertain terms to avoid if at all possible. Because if you offend one, they can kill you in broad daylight without any repercussions as long as one of their Elders says it’s fine. Why? The Ka’shenziki are the designers of all the stardrives currently used by every species in the known galaxy and every species is more afraid of losing access to stardrives or drive parts than if a single lowly sapient lives or dies. And the human guys who try to date them? Word on the street is they’re lucky if they only end up castrated instead of dead. You only interact with them if you absolutely have to, have a death wish, or want to create a messy diplomatic incident. 'So yeah,' I thought with only the slightest hint of sarcasm on my mind. 'Nice to meet you.'

“Your pronunciation of my name is exceptional for a human. I see and appreciate your kind attempt at my language,” Kin’sala responded with a widening smile that gave me a very good look at her undeniably sharp teeth. More like shark teeth than feline teeth on Earth, but still a lot of very sharp teeth. “Now that we have been properly introduced, I hope you will allow me to make a proposal. While I can understand it was a bit rude of me to overhear your discussion with that… gentleman, and you may feel a bit embarrassed, I must admit the matter I wish to discuss is somewhat of an embarrassment to me and it causes me some stress to declare it openly to another person. But I feel that we may be able to help one another. You humans have such a wonderful phrase for situations like this – you scratch my back, I scratch yours. May I have your permission to make a proposal?”

‘Sure. I’ll listen,’ I thought as I gave a quick nod. ‘While also mapping every possible exit to the laundromat so I can get away if I happen to say anything that upsets you.’

“Thank you,” the catwoman said as she seemed to relax a bit and take a deep breath. “What I wish to ask will at first seem a bit strange, but I will ask you to hear me out. As I said, this is a most embarrassing matter for me. I am looking for someone to sleep with me.”

‘Oh, no no no no no. Bad kitty. No kitty. I don’t swing that way, kitty. Please kitty, let me find a way to politely say no without offending and ending up dead,’ I thought as my back stiffened, eyes widened, and I approached full on flight or flight, with an emphasis on ‘please let me get out of here alive’.

Kin’sala reacted immediately with a quick gesture along with three clicks of her tongue. She raised two claws on her right hand and made a diagonal motion with her arm to raise it above her head, and her tail made a mirroring movement behind her. “This is not an indecent proposal. Please listen. This is a bit difficult to explain. May I continue?” She then looked at me with a raised eyebrow.

Flabbergasted, I didn’t know what to say as my brain was still in full panic. I gave her a quick nod, though the only thoughts in my mind centered around the concept of ‘oh, hell no!’

“Thank you for your patience. Allow me a moment to think so I may phrase things best,” Kin’sala responded before looking up at the ceiling and closing her eyes. A part of me began to think this might be my opportunity to bolt when the woman’s eyes opened and looked back into mine. “I should first explain a bit about myself and my people. We are a communal species, and it is of utmost importance to our physical and mental health that we have certain connections. And no, I am not speaking of sexual relations or mating. On our ships, we tend to sleep together in groups to have a physical connection to others. Often, we sleep in groups of two to four together for shared comfort.”

She paused for a moment and cocked her head to the side in thought, before an idea suddenly struck and she continued. “I believe the closest human comparison would be the slumber parties you have as children, except that we Ka’shenziki do this our entire lives and it is integral to both our culture and very nature. Does this help make more sense?”

I relaxed, but my brain was still more concentrated on the clear warnings from the Terran Diplomatic Core. I hoped I would be able to find a way to politely refuse her request.

“I can guess that my request may feel especially uncomfortable given the reputation my species has in the galaxy,” she said as my subconscious started to wonder if space kitties are also mind readers. “Indeed, every sapient I have made this request to over the past year has refused. While my people generally greatly appreciate the words of your diplomatic advisors which can be summarized as ‘Don’t touch the cats,’ in this case I must beg your indulgence to consider my request. I must also clarify that your refusal would in no way constitute offense to me personally or to my people. Does this make sense, and my I continue with my explanation?""

The look I saw in her eyes was weary, and when she blinked slowly at me I wondered if it was from some sort of exhaustion. I took a deep breath, relaxed in my seat, and nodded at Kin’sala.

“Thank you, Sam. I appreciate your patience with me. I will continue in but a moment,” she said as a flash of pain came over her face for a brief moment before returning to a neutral expression. “I have been traveling alone for over a year and a half in Earth terms, which is unusual for my people. Typically, we are not comfortable being away from our family or our kind for more than a month at a time. There was an accident on my ship, and I was the sole survivor. Both the ship and my family were lost, and I have been traveling to clear my mind before returning to my people. Please do not ask for further details.”

Kin’sala turned away from me, closed her eyes for a long moment, and clicked her tongue once before looking back at me and continuing. “I am not yet ready to return to my people as being on one of our ships brings up painful memories. And yet, since I have been gone from my people so long the stress of being without companionship has induced great mental pain and my nerves have become frayed. I need the comfort of another with me as I sleep, even if only for a night. None of my kind are in the system at this time. While it shames me greatly to make this request of you, please understand that I have no desire to ask you to do something you will find uncomfortable or distasteful.”

She relaxed back into her chair and regarded me with a calm gaze, but her tail was raised behind her and twitching constantly. The request was overwhelming and strange, and I didn’t quite know how to respond. I’m sure confusion showed on my face, and she raised her right arm slowly with a claw raised.

“I understand my proposal is a bit out of the ordinary, so allow me to make a second easier one to consider,” Kin’sala stated with a more relaxed tone. “Permit me to buy us a meal, so we may get to know one another. I understand it is often your way to get to know new friends in this manner, so perhaps we can have something delivered and I can help you with your laundry while you consider what I have said.”

I nearly said no when my stomach played the role of traitor and growled. “I think you have my answer,” I said with a chuckle and the catwoman responded with a wide smile and a gentle tap on my shoulder from her tail. She then stood up and surprisingly turned to the other woman in the laundry who was, not surprisingly, rushing to fold her laundry and leave.

Kin’sala padded over to the woman who still had the headphones on and gently tapped her shoulder. The woman looked startled and threw a few wild glances back and forth between the catwoman and me before pulling her headphones down and wrapping them around her neck. “Um. Is there a problem?” she asked Kin’sala meekly.

“Not at all. I am Kin’sala. We were going to order something to eat, and I was wondering if you would care to join us,” Kin’sala said smoothly. “I’m paying. And if you don’t have time to join us, perhaps you could give us a recommendation on what to get.” She then canted her head to the side, and her tail gently and slowly swayed behind her.

I got a clearer look at the woman with the headphones and guessed that she was likely late-twenties like me. She had shoulder length black hair, high cheekbones, and piercing green eyes. Definitely petite at just over 5ft tall and wearing a void suit similar to mine. She looked at me questioningly, and I gave the fellow spacer a smile and a nod. Admittedly, I was being a little selfish encouraging the woman to stay as I wasn’t entirely comfortable with the idea of being alone with Kin’sala just yet.

“Um. Okay. I’m Kelly, by the way,” she said softly. “The rice place is the only one open this late, but they have a Laundry Room Special that’s decent. It’s tasty and the portions are huge, so one order would probably give us all a good late-night snack. I recommend getting it sweet and spicy. Um. If you don’t mind spicy foods. Or human foods.”

Kin’sala leaned forwards and gently squeezed Kelly’s shoulder. “We have hot spices similar to your peppers, so rest assured I won’t be offended by a bit of heat. I’ll order, and then help you finish your laundry.” The catwoman then padded over to the restaurant posting on the wall, made some taps on her infopad, and returned to the folding table to stand next to the still understandably nervous Kelly.

The two worked on folding Kelly's laundry, with very little spoken beyond Kin’sala asking how Kelly preferred to fold her socks, shirts, and pants. It was only about ten minutes later that we heard a hoverscooter outside, and a short human wearing a helmet walked in. I guessed it was a guy but couldn’t be completely certain as they waved at Kin’sala, put the food on a chair next to the door, and left quickly so I didn't get the best look.

“That’s the same guy who delivered last week when I ordered,” Kelly commented. “Did it the same way, too. I worried it was a warning the food was bad, but it turned out the food was great and he just doesn’t have the best manners.”

I went over and got the delivery box and took it over to a square table while Kin’sala and Kelly finished packing up the laundry. I opened the box and was impressed by the portions but also immediately understood why it was so cheap and plentiful. Over half the box was plain white rice, probably enough for three people as a side dish. The other half of the box was split into three entrees to eat with the rice. First was a simple mix of peas and carrots in a brownish sauce. Next was cubed protein chunks in a yellow sauce, probably curry. Finally was strips of deep fried protein in a green sauce. Overall very simple and cheap, and I wasn’t sure if the proteins were tofu or some other generic protein block. This meal would rest entirely on the quality of the sauces, and a first sniff suggested this place likely got a lot of repeat business. Thankfully they had included three forks, so we wouldn’t be sharing utensils.

Kelly came over and sat across from me and Kin’sala sat to my right. Kin’sala picked up her fork and jabbed a protein chunk in curry sauce and popped it into her mouth quickly. Kelly looked like she wanted to say something before Kin’sala ate it, and looked a little unsure of what might happen next. Kin’sala’s eyes shot wide open and both Kelly and I exchanged a worried glance. There’s spicy and then there’s spicy, and the look on Kin’sala’s face suggested it was on the hotter end. Then, Kin’sala slumped down with a smile on her face and chewed slowly before swallowing.

I noticed that Kin’sala’s nose was starting to run, but before I could say anything the catwoman stabbed one of the fried strips of protein in the green sauce and ate it. Her nose started to run even more and threatened to drip onto the table. “So flavorful. So spicy,” was all Kin’sala said as she began to purr. Kelly picked up a napkin and wiped the catwoman’s nose, making me wonder if she had children or a much younger sibling when growing up. For her part, Kin’sala simply reacted by leaning her head on Kelly’s shoulder and murmuring, “Thank you.” That broke the ice and we all laughed together.

“I recommend taking some rice with the entrees to balance the heat,” Kelly said with a smile and Kin’sala followed her advice.

“Definitely better balanced with the rice, but my kind has to limit sugars or get indigestion. Perhaps the vending machine has something I can substitute,” she said as she got up and stared into the vending machine. She found a package of protein wafers which were quite bland but ended up being ideal for Kin’sala to have her share in the form of chips and dip. We started chatting comfortably and enjoyed an overall quite good meal together. As we ate, Kelly and I alternated wiping Kin’sala’s nose to prevent snot from dribbling on the table.

Kelly and I learned a few things about Ka’shenziki as we talked. First, when they feel relaxed their speech is less formal and drawn out. Second, they fall decidedly on the touchy end of the social spectrum. Not offensively, but in a warm-hearted “I’m a hugger” sort of way with gentle touches on the arm with a hand or her tail throughout a conversation. Third, as Kin’sala spoke her body and tail would momentarily shift into what seemed like a specific pose before relaxing or shifting into a slightly different pose, suggesting body language far more complex than humans and most other species in the galaxy. Things began to feel more like a girls' night out than a situation where I’d feel the need to run out the door screaming at the top of my lungs, “She’s gonna eat me!”

It turns out I guessed correctly with regards to Kelly. Her parents had an unexpected child when she was twelve, so she did play a bit of second mom growing up. Currently she was married but with no children yet. She and her husband had purchased an old scout ship and they were working to refurbish it for private charter and shipping. We had both been jumping from job to job for the past year, but she wasn’t worried about destinations the way I was. She focused on navigation jobs as she needed to get the minimum required hours to apply for a solo navigation officer certification. Her husband was already a pilot, so once she finished her certification and they passed inspections on their ship they would be ready to start their little company. This next trip would be her last for the required hours and if it went well she would be able to rejoin her husband.

“So, Sam,” Kelly said with an inquisitive look. “Short for Samantha?”

“No,” I responded quickly. “It’s short for Samatra.”

“I know that sometimes human names have special meaning, and I have not heard that one before,” Kin'sala followed up. “May I ask what it translates to?”

I flushed, as the story behind my name was a little silly. “It’s based on a very bad dad joke from my father before I was born. My dad likes coffee and tigers, and there’s an island on Earth called Sumatra that has both. My mom was thinking about the name Sam, and as a joke he suggested Samatra. My mother found the idea a bit amusing, and caved in when my father discovered there was a city in India called Samatra. Tigers are also native to India, so it was a done deal after that.”

“As the feline vote at the table, I must express-” Kin’sala began before Kelly’s infopad began to chime and cut her off.

“Dang it, that’s my reminder to get to the spaceport,” Kelly said quickly before making a few taps on her infopad and then swiping once at me and once at Kin’sala. Our infopads dinged as we received messages from her. “It was nice meeting both of you, and I hope we can keep in touch!” She stood up and Kin’sala rose with her.

“Before you leave, let me send you something,” Kin’sala said while tapping on her own infopad and swiping in Kelly’s direction. “Along with my contact info, I’ve included two Ka’shenziki codes. The first is a request to expedite stardrive inspection with my people. It won’t get you any discounts, but even if a family doesn’t know me they’ll likely bump you up the list as a favor. Second, is a code you may publish that is a Ka’shenziki request for second opinion. We have preferred shipping partners, and occasionally we request one of our partners test a newcomer. Pass their test, and you’ll get on the list for my people to consider working with you. It is unlikely my people will hire you as there are far more names on the list than we have need to hire, but being on that list can open doors as some take it as a sign of trust.”

Kelly beamed with excitement and gave Kin’sala a warm hug. “Thank you. I know exactly what that means, and I appreciate it. I hope our paths cross again!” And with an excited wave at the two of us, she jogged out of the laundromat and towards the spaceport.

I took note of how Kin’sala melted into Kelly at the hug and how the catwoman was visibly more relaxed. Giving Kelly a final wave, I stood up and gathered up our trash and threw it away. Kin’sala looked at me and I pointed at my dryer full of clothes. “No slumber party until we get my clothes folded.”

Kin’sala smiled warmly and gave me a small bow of respect. “For the future, I would recommend growing fur or going naked. Far less laundry. Both methods are well proven by Ka’shenziki.”

 ## Key Features Analysis

The tea bottle market in 2025 boasts a wide array of options, each with its own set of features designed to improve the user experience. The best tea bottles incorporate advanced materials, innovative designs, and practical functionalities.

**Double-Walled Insulation:** This is a critical feature for maintaining the tea鈥檚 temperature, whether hot or cold, for extended periods. The best models utilize vacuum insulation between the two walls of stainless steel or borosilicate glass to minimize heat transfer. Some bottles boast up to 12 hours of heat retention and 24 hours of cold retention, ensuring your tea remains at the ideal temperature throughout the day.

**Integrated Infuser:** A built-in infuser allows users to brew loose leaf tea directly within the bottle. The quality of the infuser is crucial; the best ones are made from fine-mesh stainless steel to prevent tea leaves from escaping into the water. Infusers come in various designs, including removable baskets and integrated filters, catering to different brewing preferences. Some bottles even feature adjustable infusers to control the strength of the brew.

**Durable and Safe Materials:** The choice of materials directly impacts the bottle's durability, safety, and taste neutrality. Premium tea bottles are typically constructed from borosilicate glass or food-grade stainless steel, both of which are resistant to thermal shock and chemical leaching. Borosilicate glass offers excellent clarity and doesn't retain flavors, while stainless steel is highly durable and impact-resistant. BPA-free plastic components are also essential for ensuring the safety of the beverage.

**Leak-Proof Design:** A reliable leak-proof seal is non-negotiable for any tea bottle intended for on-the-go use. High-quality bottles feature silicone gaskets and secure locking mechanisms to prevent spills and leaks. The cap design should be ergonomic and easy to open and close, even with one hand. Some models also incorporate vent holes to regulate pressure and prevent splashing when pouring.

**Temperature Monitoring System:** Select high-end models incorporate integrated temperature sensors and LED displays to show the exact temperature of the tea. This feature allows users to monitor the tea's temperature in real-time and ensure it's at the perfect drinking temperature. These smart bottles often connect to smartphone apps, allowing users to track their tea consumption and set temperature alerts.

**Easy to Clean:** The ease of cleaning is a significant factor, particularly for frequent users. Bottles with wide mouths and removable components are easier to clean thoroughly. Many tea bottles are dishwasher-safe, but hand washing is often recommended to prolong the lifespan of the seals and other components.

Key features of the best tea bottles in 2025 include:

*   Superior insulation to maintain temperature.
*   Integrated infusers for brewing loose leaf tea.
*   Durable and safe materials like borosilicate glass and stainless steel.
*   Reliable leak-proof design for portability.

 ## FAQs Section

Many consumers have questions about tea bottles, particularly regarding their compatibility, maintenance, and functionality. Here are some frequently asked questions and their answers.

**Can I use my tea bottle for other beverages besides tea?**
  Yes, most tea bottles can be used for other beverages such as coffee, infused water, and even smoothies. However, it's important to clean the bottle thoroughly after each use to prevent flavor transfer. Bottles made from borosilicate glass are particularly resistant to flavor retention.

**How do I clean my tea bottle properly?**
  Most tea bottles can be cleaned with warm soapy water and a bottle brush. For stubborn stains or tea residue, you can use a mixture of baking soda and water. Some bottles are dishwasher-safe, but it's always best to check the manufacturer's instructions. Remove and clean the infuser separately.

**Are tea bottles safe to use with boiling water?**
  High-quality tea bottles made from borosilicate glass or stainless steel are generally safe to use with boiling water.

Advised him to have some integrity in his Disses: 

‘I’m going to Diss him and tell him he’s not a genius and no one reads his post that will get him’

Brain span probably doesn’t even have half the attention to break any of it down.

I’ll be noncompliant in every in any of these people’s timelines. Eyes hoping to Cognitive Dissonance any evidence as another human that has proven that he doesn’t read

He was nothing either. Equivalent to the last 3. Sitting with this Diss in his irrelevant account not even have a right to play 

Could read his words on his account start quoting and break them down verses mine, and tally count if his rhymes are composed of any high creativity. And got to that eventually 

‘IQ flexer’, yes in fact I even wanted to spread his death out:

Dropped in water attached to pomegranates with nano grenades inside because I like the color of a red sea, and show the same light as only frequencies that you radiated during its minimum duration. Hyping up vivid relevance enough though his composition to the art is simply a percent of his fleeting oxygen

Take the Big IQ that I ‘flexed’ while he’s impressed with one mere human’s english languages while I’m the one that’s pressured to use it

Divided my entire IQ to natural numbers of 1. Then customized each one those into smarter humans to walk the earth since its obviously that massive to do it and ship lower entities like him out because I’m smart enough to not increase the population that much in my calculations that there’s a bunch of him

While instead in silence, sit in laughter while one of those clones interact antagonizing the rest of him, and his associations that he wanted to mention

I’ve been created better coherent languages myself. Hoping to see a higher intellectual percentage and then I can comfortably communicate

Perhaps I can teach him so that can translate in verses his account, so others can see not only a better process that I’ll be involved with in the worth of him, and a new language. But told him go get a better Pen first 

Here’s the first Paragraph ‘again’:

‘Drop you in water attached to Pomegranates with Nano grenades inside because I like the color of a Red Sea’

(Get it?)

‘And show the same Light as only Frequencies that you Radiated during its minimum duration’

(Get it?)

‘Hyping up vivid relevance enough though your composition to the Art is simply a percent of your fleeting Oxygen’

(Get it?)”

Bars after stating that I wanted to spread is death out. Looks pretty coherent to me

Thought a diss was to test me with mentioning of my IQ

But he failed a test live on his own diss by comprehension. Thank you for allowing me to Reiterate. He test is to break down all of my paragraphs 

All of the double meanings and under ones. Expose The_Silencer_00 when hr obviously failed in the fact that his literal attempt right here in front of everyone the “cognitive dissonance” that he has

His diss dismissed in mere hours. I still want a break down of my response in comparison to this trash that he just posted. Before his says ‘The_Silencer_00’ I can’t do that. Let’s space it out since his thought process needs me to do that:

Take the Big IQ that I ‘flexed’ while you’re impressed

With ne mere human’s English languages

While I’m the one that’s ‘Pressured’ to use it

Divided my entire IQ to natural numbers of 1.

Then customized each One those into smarter humans

To walk the earth since its obviously that massive to do it

And ship lower entities like you out because I’m smart

Enough to Not increase the Population that much in my calculations that there’s a bunch of you

While instead in ‘Silence’, Sit in Laughter

While one of those Clones interact antagonizing the rest of you

And your associations you wanted to mention

I’ve been created better coherent Languages myself

Hoping to see a higher intellectual percentage

And then I can comfortably communicate

Perhaps I can teach you that can Translate on your account

So others can see not only a better process

That I’ll be involved with in the worth of you

And a New language but go get a better Pen first”

Failed a test that this own person created. Psychologically run circles around him and make him yell ‘Spell check’ lacking understanding that anyone can express things how ever they want. While your entire thought process is what accounts for this Litmus Test

Defeating his writings.

Take ‘Death” that he throws and crumble it up and pluck it back. The magic to that is the difference in how both our words really affect one another

Another One is in the trash. I’ll kick that worthless bucket that I just threw him in. Then watch him tumble out of it for thoughts to crawl out of the bed with that type of diss 

It’s okay if he didn’t read any of it. It’s here for him to sit with it. A gift with him whenever he needs ambition to level up his writings instead of his recent post 

Took his entire post and created my own seminar right out of it. On his own post constrained by lore of me that he didn’t read about

First lesson: Simply just tell me that you don’t like my writings instead of your lack of life and knowledge defying student’s constant collections of embarrassment

Still want him to break down my barz and share them here. Just to convey my sense of humor in the fear of him reading anything on my account. Class is over you’re simply a drop out. I Dropped In took you right out instantly

‘I won’t read or respond. I saw that he does this but I didn’t think to see him this quick here’

Veer his attention elsewhere, and let’s see some extensions of the topics that he can quote in my creations

Using a fallacy to damage control the reality of his intellectual lackadaisical antics. Easy coffin with my coffee. His expelled from sessions of ever rhyming with me

He’s ‘Tickled’ by the presence of an entity with Brighter thoughts. Put some space in my lines as this deranged man claims ‘verbosity’ overdosing on my paragraph 

He was confused the word “verbosity” with merely Mass. he’s not as a good Actor as the Ghost from my Slammed Coffins 

In his Diss. A bunch of words that he wanted to rhyme with to equip insults. Let’s rewind this one:

Ohh as I thought. Over 20,000 words on my account. With Zero post of me mentioning ‘Einstein’ outside of this one. Binary thinking verses breach of a human showing up

Mentioning “Einstein” building a diss of ignorant bricks thrown. Only Relativity and much more topics that he or Einstein even knows about in his quantum attempts to grab a little attention of mine

You’ve had some. Thanked him for his pointless Letter. ‘Dear’ these responses to whomever this was 

To him, Big Contract, and two foloosh ghouls. I’m going to write an Original called The_Silencer_00 vs his Pen Part 2, and give them all at least 8 weeks to attempt to break it down. They can use AI, the internet, people they know…other writers. Etc

All are invited. As a human I know none of them have enough time. And since Big Contract finally claiming to be a father now 

Pick a topic on “The_Silencer_00 vs his Pen Part 2” on a YouTube stream while I hope they can keep up while I show up as a real human teaching all of it to them 

One thumb, shift the entire attention to me when they simply could have scrolled past it. Let’s see how much these 4 heroes materialized to attempt to impress me will do

Might even write some lyrics down during the class breaks of my two new students to entertain them with when they are doing Limits
(Time and date stamped it)

Otherwise write a Diss by showing their lyrical abilities. Instead ‘Well well didn’t read so we will claim it as something in the elements of nonsense’. Of course a fish humans right out of the Internet this dense

I’m Chill, then get gory quick. Get witless circumscribing idiots written in a book of mine. Design a chapter of chilling nights 

I’m real life they know when I writing even when I’m not physically around because right out of the microwave their lack of nutrient bites would still leave them with a cold tongue

Then bring Mr. Infamous back from my Famous_Answer to encompass real snow around the glass world until it’s a comet. Finally throw him something for him to revolve around since he wants to be with a sun

Dissed on AI technology. Then he was told to be in a fake cradle of a spherical glass of a house inside of it with fake snow on it huddled inside 

Showed them a “peak” of how I can even think of my rhymes in front of all four of them and would break down plenty more

An ability of mind emergent from the complexity of my written (and creativity in them) makes it easy for me to analyze every trash letter in their  rhymes. Can read anything that all of them wrote for years in under 5 minutes

Taught them something that had 8 meanings in it with 2 more ones still hidden. 
Downvoting didn’t even reshape my creativity

Every tactic imagined I antagonized that too. Down votes still had my entire verses there disappear. Having the audience reading a diss of fake dominance

Then they click my name like I popped up from the darkness. 4 targets now let’s see if they can catch up

And I don’t even mean in mass that is already given up my them. The matter is the amount of posts all four of them have at this point of time with a galactic magnitude of trash

Of course they simply orbit it around like it’s profound. All four of those dudes are grounded until I decide to come back out…

(At least I know now that Reddit has a limit of 40,000 characters in one post. Still posted it and broke it up. In side thoughts I concluded that The_Silencer_00 vs his Pen Part 2 certainly has to be shorter if I plan on ever writing it in a more condensed Fashion confined by those limits lol)

I (m, 41) am a senior consultant at my company (let's call it X). I've been at X for almost 12 years. My colleague (f, 28) is a junior consultant and fairly recent hire. 

A few days ago, we were both in the staff kitchen on a tea break. I had my usual coffee and protein bar, and she was (at first I believed) warming a snack in the microwave. Well, it turned out that it was no snack but half a mug full of water. To my horror, she took out the cup, added a teabag, two spoonfuls of sugar and *then* milk. Then she put it back in the microwave and warmed it some more. When she was done, I casually asked her what she was making and she said, ""tea."" 

I was silent for a few moments, trying not to judge. Then I said, ""Oh, so is that a different way of making it?"" and she said, ""Yes.""  Some moments passed, during which I watched her dip a digestive into this brownish-white coloured liquid. 

I couldn't take it anymore so I got up, took a mug from the cupboard, and showed her the correct way to make tea so it has the right colour and consistency. Well, she got very angry with me and said that I was ""gatekeeping"" and that there are different ways to make tea, so I should just mind my business.

1k5ggvf,https://v.redd.it/jv0ww7ja3gwe1,Guide to extracting and oxidizing kratom alkaloids.,"I'll just preface by saying this is a very budget method and with more money ad equipment could definitely be improved.  recently lost most of my equipment and have been rebuilding. But this is how you make 7OH alkaloids in decent yield.

Dissolve 120g of acid (I prefer malic) in 1.4L of water. Add a quarter pound of well CRUSHED (Note 1) mitragynine. Boil a big pot or pan of water and put the jar inside of it. Now stir the solution well for 30 minutes, using a blender if possible, but a spoon works. The resulting solution should be coffee colored. Now pour as much as can fit into a French press, and press it like you would coffee or tea, squeezing out as much liquid as possible. Repeat this until all of the liquid is in another jar. To this add 400-500ml of mineral spirits or another nonpolar solvent. Heat this on a stir plate to about 50C again and stir vigorously for a few hours. After this, pour the solution into a 2L separatory funnel and allow the layers to settle, the top should contain bubbly waxes and fats and be green, seperate this from your nice acidic extract. You can continue after this, but washing twice seperates a little bit better(After the insoluble plant material settles,you can reuse the mineral spirits a few times. ) Now dissolve 75g of NaOH in 300ml water (Note 2). Add to your separators funnel and slowly drop in around half of this volume first. Then, continue adding dropwise checking pH frequently. You are aiming for pH 9-10. You will see the solution getting thicker and cloudier by the end. It should be reddish brown and completely opaque. Total volume should be around 1.75L now. Add to this 250ml of ethyl acetate(Note 3), and shake, stir, and put in a 2L seperatory funnel. If you defatted well, the layers should seperate nicely (Note 4).
Pour this bottom red layer back into the jar, and pour the clear yellow top layer into a seperate container. Repeat this ethyl acetate wash 2 more times, using 250ml each time. Finally you can pour your total 750ml combined extracts into a glass baking dish, put it infront of a fan or heater, and let it evaporate. The smell will be strong so you should probably do it somewhere with ventilation even though ethyl acetate is safe and smells alright. After it's evaporated, you should be left with orange ish crystals. Scrape it off your dish, this is your extract. It contains about 40-50% mitragynine, 40-50% paynantheine speciogynine, speciociliatine, and 5-10% other impurities. 

Now at this point you can further concentrate the mitragynine by running it through a column to seperate by polarity, or just proceed with the 7OH oxidation.

 Unfortunately my column is gone. But if I were to do it, I would pack the column with silica, and dissolve the extract in hexane/ethyl acetate in a 7:3 ratio. Since mitragynine is the second least polar of the alkaloids, you will end up pulling speciogynine and mitragynine first, leading to a 80%+ MIT extract. This is all speculation from past chemistry experience I have, I never got to try this elution.

If you use this extract without purification, you will end up with a mixture of 7-OH-Mitragynine, 7-OH-paynantheine 7-OH-speciogynine, and 7-OH-speciociliatine. The other 3 aren't really documented well but I think they have slight opioid agonism. 

PART 2: Oxidation 
Singlet oxygen oxidation

First, let's generate the disodium salt of rose bengal (Note 5). Dissolve 80mg of NaOH in 30ml everclear or methanol. Add 1 gram of rose bengal powder, and stir until dissolved. Then add 70ml more alcohol.

Now we'll build the apparatus for oxidation.
Take a cardboard box big enough to fit your stir plate inside, line it with foil, and cut out a hole to fit your LED floodlight in one of the walls. Put your stir plate inside, and put a ice bath inside. Make sure the beaker you will do the reaction in fits inside, and have a bigger beaker over it. Break open a boost oxygen bottle to where it's just the white nozzle. Then take some rubber tubing or something, and cut a small hole in it and finesse the nozzle into it. Now just cover one end, and try pushing to see if it blows out the other. Then in the small beaker dissolve with a stir bar 1g of your Kratom extract in 20ml ethanol, 2-3ml of the disodium rose bengal solution, and cool to 0C in the ice bath. After that put your oxygen tube in and cover it like in the video. Push the oxygen in to purge the atmosphere of air (Note 6).
Turn on the GREEN LED, and close the box. React this for 2 hours at 0C. Dont let it get too hot. If ou check TLC against just your sample you should see a new very polar spot and a less polar spot. Then add a solution or 1.5g sodium sulfate in 10ml water and add 5ml more ethanol. Continue to stir until the most polar peak is gone on TLC, should take  4-5 hours. After this, add an additional 5ml water. Then remove all ethanol under vacuum, and extract the solution with 20ml of ethyl acetate. Seperate top layer in sep funnel, and collect it. Repeat that extraction 2 more times. 


The rose bengal acts as a photosensetizer and gets excited to a triplet state. This reacts with oxygen, which is also triplet spin paired, and converts to singlet oxygen. Singlet oxygen is much more reactive since it isn't spin forbidden from reacting with organic molecules anymore, so it can oxidize the alkene of the indole ring in mitragynine.

Part 2: Oxone oxidation

This one is probably easier, and yields a strong product as well. Dissolve 1g alkaloid extract in 60ml acetone. Make a saturated solution of baking soda, and add 5ml to your stirred acetone solution. Cool this mixture to 0C in the ice bath while stirring, some solids may precipitate from salting out but it's not significant. Add a claisen adapter on top of the flask, and put a seperatory funnel on top. In a seperate beaker, dissolve 1.2g Oxone in 5ml distilled water(Note 7)Then pour this solution into the seperatory funnel. Now open the funnel VERY SLOWLY to make sure the drop rate is like 10 drops/min. You want to keep the oxone concentration and the temperature low at all times to reduce the risk of side reactions.
After adding all 5ml of Oxone over the course of 20-30 mins. Continue stirring at 0C for 30 mins. Then, dilute with 10ml water and strip off all acetone under vacuum. There should be alkaloids precipitating at this point, so repeat the same exact ethyl acetate extraction described in the rose bengal method with 3x20ml. Evaporate that and yield a product with high 7OH levels

For both methods, you can dissolve the extract in hexane/ethyl acetate and seperate the 7-OH in a column. These allyl alcohol derivatives will elute nicely from the starting materials.

Conclusion

While both these methods produce 7OH, I'd say that the product from the rose bengal method is subjectively more potent. I just got TLC papers so I'll compare it against a real 7OH pill to see how strong the 7OH spot is from both methods. Will post those results too. I also have some pictures it doesn't let me post for some reason. With my next paycheck I hope to get a new column so I can actually seperate 7OH from the other alkaloids. There's other indole oxidation methods, PIFA, peroxyacids, but these two described are the most studied in this context. 

If you guys are interested in more guides and experimentation, ill post them as they come. But like I said my limiting factor in this case is money and equipment, so if yall wanna give donations or tips thats appreciated. My CashApp is $7ftdeeper.
Anyways feel free to DM or ask any questions in the comments. In the future im gonna try a Lewis acid catalyzed semipinacol rearrangement of 7OH to psuedoindoxyl. I also want to experiment with esters of 7-OH, like 7-acetoxy-mitragynine, and other derivatives. I've been busy but I hope to make progress on these projects soon. 







Note 1: I find crushed mitragynine to yield better in the long run simple because of how badly powdered leaves clog filters, even under strong vacuum. You have to filter 20 jars at a time and still end up losing yield to water trapped inside. You do need a higher volume of water when using crushed leaves which can be annoying but I think it's worth it. Honestly, it's even better to do an ethanol/acetone extraction first, evaporate that, and then use acid base on that crude extract, but in my experience making a crude extract doesn't really change yield but adds extra steps and materials. Also, you can use kratom powder and filter it through celite but it's still very time consuming.

Note 2: This is only the case for malic acid or another diprotic acid like tartaric, if your acid is monoprotic (acetic acid, HCl, etc) use roughly half the amount of base. If using triprotic (citric acid, phosphoric acid) add another half molar amount.

Note 3: You can really use any polar aprotic solvent that doesn't mix with water(DCM, CHCl3, ether), I find ethyl acetate the safest and cheapest. It can be found in hardware stores as ""Kleen Strip MEK substitute"". Some people will say you can just filter the basic extract but that never worked for me, solvent extraction works much better.

Note 4: If the layers don't seperate completely and form an emulsion after letting the funnel sit for 30 minutes, you're gonna have to filter the whole concoction again to remove what remaining fats the ethyl acetate pulled out. This filtration is pretty fast though, especially under vacuum. Now you should be left with a nice clean separation.

Note 5: This will help it stay in the water layer and not go into the organic layer and contaminate the color of the product.

Note 6:Look at the video kaliforniakratom posted for a demonstration, if you can find whatever oxygen can they use it would be easier. 
A better method is just putting a small side arm flask with an oxygen tank in the arm and a balloon on top.
But the best way would be to connect a gas bubbler to an oxygen generator and bubble it through the solution. But remember this is a budget method and we work with what we have.

Note 7: Oxone reacts with metal ions in tap water that can catalyze the decomposition, making it useless for reaction.

I have absolutely no idea what I am to do with this year. I feel utterly ashamed of myself for not having been able to stay in full time education or work.

I've been working on bettering myself and my family are supportive. I get up out of bed to go to the library/coffee shop to work on my cv or to find places to volunteer but I can't quite seem to escape this feeling that I am wasting my time. Not to mention this crushing loneliness I feel during the day when I'm wandering around with nowhere to go and because of the fact that my anxiety/paranoia has prevented me from being in any type of romantic relationship.

I live at home with my parents, without a driving license, degree or full time job. I desperately want to become a better person and rid myself of this guilt but I also want to take accountability for where I have gotten myself. Mentally I am feeling much better from when I was at university but  am terrified to go back into third year (next jan). What should I do travel? Find a partner? Get another job? Drop out of uni completely? Become a nun?

1k5gfgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k5gfgp/could_the_keurig_kslim_single_serve_brewer_review/,Could the Keurig K-Slim Single Serve Brewer Review Transform Your Coffee Routine?,"The Keurig 5000376527, also known as the Keurig K-Compact Single-Serve K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker, has been part of my daily routine for the past couple of months. Balancing a love for coffee with a smaller kitchen space, my hunt for a slim yet efficient coffee maker led me here. This compact brewer had a lot riding on it: promises of convenience, versatility, and a sleek design that wouldn't crowd my counter. With mixed feelings on single-serve brewers in general, I dove right in to see how this stacks up.

**Design and Space-Saving Features**  
Right out of the box, this coffee maker caught my eye with its streamlined matte black exterior. It fits like a charm on my cramped countertop, measuring just over 8 inches wide. For someone who lives in a small apartment, that space-saving feature has been a game changer. While I initially thought compact might equal compromise, I was relieved to find that the machine doesn’t feel overly lightweight or cheap—it’s sturdy and solid. The removable drip tray added another layer of convenience, especially for my slightly taller travel mugs.

**Ease of Use and Smart Start Functionality**  
After a groggy morning, fumbling with a dozen buttons on appliances is the last thing anyone wants. This brewer’s simple button controls made my life easier. The “Smart Start” feature that seamlessly heats and brews in one step was honestly a lifesaver. All I had to do was pop in a K-Cup, press a button, and within a minute, coffee was ready. No preheating hassles, which meant less time staring at it longingly while the caffeine deprivation kicked in. It also came in clutch when hosting a friend over breakfast—it operated like a breeze without needing half an hour to explain.  

[Grab Keurig 5000376527 at the best price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0bv9hkmnt/)  

**Performance and Brewing Versatility**  
This machine enables brewing in three different cup sizes: 6, 8, or 10 ounces. While I mostly stick to the 8-ounce setting, the smaller 6-ounce option delivers a noticeably stronger cup of coffee, perfect for those days when just one sip won’t cut it. Having the 36 oz. removable reservoir allows for brewing a few cups back-to-back without constant water refilling, which I appreciated more than I expected. For someone like me who enjoys an evening tea, the hot water dispensing feature (achieved by running the machine without a pod) has been a big plus as well.  

**Highlights**  
- Compact and sleek design, easily fits small spaces.  
- Smart Start feature saves time and frustration.  
- Removable 36 oz. reservoir simplifies refilling.  
- Supports brewing multiple cup sizes for varied preferences.  
- Additional hot water dispense feature for versatility.  

**Areas of Concern**  
Despite its many strengths, the product isn’t without its flaws.  

- The pod-only brewing method might feel limiting for those who enjoy a variety of coffee blends or ground coffee, as the reusable coffee filter isn’t included.  
- The auto-off feature, while energy-efficient, caught me off guard when I wanted a second cup of coffee shortly after my first.  
- For a coffee machine in this range, it lacks premium construction—some parts are plasticky and may not sit well with users expecting higher-end finishes.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to some of its competitors, the Keurig K-Compact stands out in its efficient use of space. For instance, the Nespresso Pixie comes close in terms of size but leans pricier and focuses on espresso instead of standard brewed coffee. Affordable alternatives like Mr. Coffee’s single-serve brewer offer similar capabilities but fall behind in user-friendliness and brewing speed. The Keurig edges ahead thanks to its Smart Start feature and quick brew times, though it lags behind premium machines like the Ninja DualBrew, which offers greater versatility for brewing styles at a slightly higher cost.  

**Smart Spending**  
In terms of overall value, this brewer balances performance and affordability well if you're primarily looking for a reliable single-serve option. It isn’t the cheapest machine out there, but I found it to be worth the cost for its specific advantages—compact size, ease of use, and quick brewing. However, those seeking premium features like dual brewing options or a richer metal build may want to invest in a more robust model.

Tldr at the end 


A year ago, I lost my last parent my dad. I moved back home and was completely on my own. The grief hit me so hard. I fell into a deep depression and, honestly, I had some really dark thoughts.

One of the few people who really showed up for me during that time was my childhood best friend we’d been close since middle school, part of a tight group in high school, though we went to different colleges. 

We saw each other off and on through the years, after losing my dad everything fell apart, he was just there for me. Every call, every breakdown, every panic attack he became a constant. He helped me get therapy. He made sure I ate. I can say without exaggeration that he helped save my life. He has been a great friend and I’m so thankful.

Throughout high school, I liked him maybe even loved him….but I never thought he saw me that way, when I had hope I’d doubt myself and shut it down. There was always someone between us. I never made a move. So nothing happened between us in high school. We both went to different colleges…so naturally dated other people in college, and I’ve been single for two years now. He’s been with his girlfriend for about a year.

Lately, I’ve been feeling like myself again… made some new friends, and I even got asked out recently by somebody from work (different dept). I mentioned it casually to him over coffee, thinking it was no big deal… and his whole demeanor changed…he was suddenly off with me. He went back to being normal and never commented on what I said. I didn’t think much of it tbh.

Later that day, he drove me home and just… broke down at my door. He said he thought he moved on years ago, but being close to me again this past year reminded him that he never truly did. He told me he loved me. That he always had but I was always with someone so he held back. That he never wanted to lose me again. And that if I felt the same, he’d end things with his girlfriend immediately.

Ngl I was pretty shocked I never expected him to ever say that let alone see him break down like that. 

Part of me wants nothing more than to run and put my arms around him and tell him yes “I feel the same way”. I think, deep down, I’ve always loved him quietly, patiently, in the background of my life. I buried those feelings for years, convincing myself it wasn’t mutual, that the timing was never right…and it still isn’t right lol. 

I still adore him. I always have he’s my best friend….All those feelings I tried to bury years ago. I still feel them they have always been there. And after losing my dad, I’ve realized how short and unpredictable life is. I don’t want to live with regrets. 

BUT BUT another part of me feels sick with guilt. I don’t know his girlfriend well (met her a few times at group events), but she’s a person with feelings and I don’t want to be the reason her heart breaks. I don’t know if I can live with myself. I don’t know if I can be selfish. 

Before I could say something ….He told me to sleep on it. So I’m doing a lot of that and thinking and avoiding him for days.  I guess I just needed to get this off my chest …this is just so messy. Half of our friends adore her. 

To feel excitement and guilt at the same time. Any advice would be welcomed. Would I be evil if I was selfish?  



Tdlr :After losing my dad and moving back home, my childhood best friend supported me through the darkest time of my life. We’ve always been close, and I may have always loved him deep down. I recently mentioned I was asked out, and he confessed he’s been in love with me for years and would leave his girlfriend if I felt the same.

1k5gakb,https://www.reddit.com/r/penpalsover30/comments/1k5gakb/34m_usa_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection/,"34M, USA - Longing for intense and deep connection and elaborate exchange","Salutations!

I've been interested in penpalling ever since I was a kid - back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from half way across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. I've been fortunate enough to have had a few before, mostly focusing on item exchanges, letters, and the occasional postcard, and I'd like to see if I can find that again, being able to live those experiences and to also give that to someone else as well.

I'm looking for someone that I first and foremost relate to on a personal and deeper level. *My ideal is to actually get to know my penpal* \- cold exchanges are less interesting to me, but aren't completely rejected. Location doesn't matter as much, as who the person is defines whether I'd like to connect with them or not. That being said, I do have a preference for cultural exchange and differences. Part of why I like penpaling is to be exposed to things I otherwise wouldn't be and to allow that for someone else as well. But, whether you're in my state or half the world away, it's you, the person, I want to exchange with.

On that note, who, exactly, may you be connecting with?

***Basic and personal details of myself and the people I like to engage with:***

I'm 34, male, and from the Eastern US.

*I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion* \- it's one of my most desired interaction regardless of the form of relationship. I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.

*The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.* Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.

*Creativity and artistry are important to me.* Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.

*Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.* I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata.*' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.

On that, *being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.* We're in a written realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, defeats the point of this, does it not?

*More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.* Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. I haven't consumed media regularly in years, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games.

*I'm INTJ and am Type 5.* I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

***More details of my exchange preferences and goals:***

Ideally, I'd like to have a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items. Due to the private nature of penpaling, however, I'd like us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let's become familiar with each other to make sure we're a good fit. All that being said, I'm also interested in having e-mail penpals, which I'd be open to in the immediate now. It's more than possible for one form to transition into another or for us to have multiple forms of penpalling going on at the same time, so don't think how we start is necessarily how we'll need to be forever.

My go-to communication method with someone is in the form of lengthy, detailed, intricate paragraphs and pages that delve into a variety of topics and themes. Even when meeting people in less defined ways we sometimes end up becoming de facto penpals due to how long it takes to properly respond to each other. So, if digital exchange is what you're after, this is the style it should take. I'm less particular when it comes to the physical. I've done pages upon pages in the form of letters and postcards in what looked like 8 point font, as well as exchanges that included almost no words at all or even focused exclusively on items or more artsy sorts of communication. The form of our penpalling doesn't matter as much as what works for us. Above all, I'm here to meet a person that I want to engage in penpalling with and not someone to fulfill a word count and dollar amount. What I'm after is connection and intrigue, depth and meaning, and not an extra piece of mail every few weeks.

*Think we could have a great exchange?*

Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.

*Have any uncertainties or feel unsure? Leave your hesitations and take the chance.* If you liked anything you read here, there's a very high likelihood of us both gaining and experiencing something wonderful together. Don't doubt yourself or what's possible. The person themselves matters more than the form of penpalling we take on and any specific details. You never know until you take the plunge, and I've certainly been shocked countless times in life by what does and doesn't work.",0,1745352829.0,penpalsover30,0,0.5,False
1k5gaiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrisonersofSol/comments/1k5gaiv/directive_no_trust_5/,Directive_No_Trust_[5],"A POV change as we now see what happened after Tertis decided to rudely wake Mikhail.

Thank you to u/SpacePaladin15 for creating the Prisoners of Sol universe and the absolutely chaotic physics it has.

 

To say that this situation was weird would be the understatement of the 25^(th) century. Waking up to a pair of glowing blue L.E.Ds and a shape being silhouetted by a blinding light behind it was rather jarring.

Tertis for their part decided that they wanted more answers to extremely simple questions and decided to break into my room with the help of one of my colleagues, on my one day off this week.

“You are quiet, I require your statement for the enquiry.” The robot bear/beaver thing said standing at the door to the break room.

I was slumped over the counter rubbing the sleep from my eyes, I needed coffee or something to liven me up a bit, I felt like the husk of a person in all honesty.

‘Why couldn’t these guys just go with the downloaded version of the code alter, it would make life so much easier.’

“…”

“I restate my pervious enquiry, why did the security guard feel the need to worry about another?”

“It’s called having heart.” I said back to the invader.

“This is an unsatisfactory answer. Please understand that the question must be resolved.” The metallic trashcan insisted.

“It’s the best you’re going to get right now.”

The coffee machine was still grinding the kernels, it felt like an eternity had passed and yet I could still see that it wasn’t even halfway done yet. I strolled my body over to a chair and flopped down in it, the lenses of the android followed me as I buried my head in my folded arms on the table.

I closed my eyes and the harsh light from the fluorescent bulbs was quelled a little, the sweet relief of slumber tugged at my mind. I slowly started to drift off to the hum of the lights above me and the grinding noise of coffee being made.

‘I’m sure it’ll be a few minutes; the beep will wake me up when it’s done.’

My alertness slowly faded as my facilities started to slow down, my mind numbing and the sweet relief of sleep started to make is presence ever more known.

\*THUMP\*

I was jerked awake as I heard a heavy metallic object slam down on something, I raised my head in response to the noise and my eyes squinted to see what had startled me only to see Tertis sitting across the small table from me.

“This is not a contusive zone for a rest period, I require that you remain alert to answer the question.” They said through their voice module.

“Could you just give me peace for a few minutes.” I groaned, laying my head back down in my arms.

“I do not understand this statement; we are not engaged in hostilities.”

“Just… be quiet for a little. Please.”

“… Affirmative.”

The ding of the coffee machine meant that it had finished brewing the concoction that would help make this situation better. I got up lethargically, swaying on my feet before grabbing a cup and pouring some coffee into it.

I didn’t even sit down and started drinking the lifegiving elixir.

I removed the beverage from my face and took in the surroundings finally, feeling the coffee working its way through my system.

“Why is it that you must require this caffeinated beverage for sustainment of mental faculties?”

I turned my attention to the room invading android sitting at the table in front of me.

“It helps wake you up in the morning, especially when someone barges into their room.” I made my words more pointed toward the end to make the Vascar feel at least bit of remorse, waking me in such a way. I took another gulp of my coffee not caring about the heat of it.

The robot for their part didn’t acknowledge the answer and instead remained motionless staring at me.

“The other technician stated that it was the correct course of action to be taken.”

“Oh, did she now?”

“Affirmative.”

‘I knew I wasn’t going to cover for her again after that, maybe the Vascar didn’t know, and she just prompted him to do that instead of knocking.’

I took another swig of my coffee and drained the cup completely before refilling it again, with my back facing the robot they spoke up.

“I have a request.”

I turned and prompted the Vascar to continue leaning against the counter behind me.

“The current technician, Olivia Peirce is not in the right mental state to be conducting the code alteration. Her mental facilities much like your own appear to be suboptimal for awareness in the event of catastrophic failure.” They stated.

I wasn’t going to argue that her mental facilities were suboptimal, especially in the region of making reasonable decisions, but she was more than qualified for the work.

“I think she’s working just fine, especially since I’m not gonna cover for her next shift-“

The androids fan whirred at my response cutting me off.

“That is not a correct course of action to pursue, I require that she be replaced by you, or another human as of immediate effect.”

“Look, there’s only the two of us here that have the know how to overlook the procedure and know what to look for, other than that there’s no one else except for Peter at the gate.”

The Vascar made some sort of beep mixed with static and what sounded like arcing electric at the same time, if I had known better it may have been their way of cursing or something.

“This is not…”

“Satisfactory?” I added.

“Pleasant.”

 I almost spat my coffee out at that remark. Was the robot starting to feel emotive suddenly. They kept staring at me as if to judge my actions and see what I would do now that they said that.

“The outcomes for those undergoing the code alter may differ, it must be apparent to even organics that in the eventg it fails, there must be a ‘safety catch’ as you would put it, in place for these possibilities.”

I could sense a hint of anxiousness in the android, worry for their brethren maybe? I thought of my response to the android, I took another sip of my second cup of coffee at this point pondering how best to reassure a machine.

“She has more credentials and certificates than me, almost double the amount, she knows her stuff when it comes to programming and just I.T in general. She’s studied for years in this field and has multiple diplomas. She just sometimes makes stupid decisions, but when she needs to step up, she can.”

The Vascar stayed quiet at my response, so I continued.

“Ok, see the way that Mikri was the first Vascar to have the code alter, right?”

“I am beginning to understand that your vocabulary is dependent on other’s inputs.”

“Right, so she was part of the team put together to make the code alter. Find it, understand it and finally fix it by removing it.”

I explained it matter of factly for the android to understand, though I wasn’t going to go find each and every certification she has just to make sure that Tertis understood that she was more than qualified.

“Please elaborate of earlier statement.”

“Which one?”

“She just sometimes makes stupid decisions.” I heard my own voice through the android.

“Okay, first off, that’s creepy and second, it’s as it sounds. She makes stupid decisions, like sending you to wake me up rudely and staying up late to finish that game of hers.”

“This does not inspire confidence in her stated abilities.”

“It’s only human to be smart at some things and dumb at others, like, if you were to tell me to build a car engine, I couldn’t do that, but if you ask me to write a code for opening a window at certain intervals in a day. I’d have that done in five minutes.”

I sipped at my coffee again, I was starting to feel more awake and the grumpiness of waking up was starting to subside. I sat back down at the table after grabbing a breakfast bar from a cupboard.

“I understand this logic path.”

A silence grew between us, and I couldn’t keep looking straight at the blue L.E.Ds of the Vascar in front of me while munching on my breakfast. The term unblinking would be very applicable at this moment.

“I’m guessing that she was looking tired this morning then?”

I wanted to fill the air with something instead of the android just analysing me constantly, felt like I was staring at a camera to be honest.

“Affirmative, she has shown signs close to sleep deprivation, it is unwise for her to be conducting work such as this in her current state.”

Knowing Olivia, she’s probably asleep right now in the room with the Vascar, the amount of time she spent not sleeping and just gaming was not human, even in this universe it didn’t stop her.

“You know the code alter is extremely easy, I don’t understand why some of you don’t just go with the downloadable version and have it done at home or whatever you would approximate as home.”

“It is best to have the code alter done in a place for the security and the risk nullification.”

“Is that the real reason, like I already know that the population of you guys doing it by visiting our sites is minimal. It would really lighten our workload if all you guys would just do the downloadable one, maybe I could have gotten more sleep if that was the case.”

The android stayed quiet at my response again, most likely looking for a logic path to explain why they didn’t trust doing the code alter at home.

“There are those among our collective that do not trust the work of organics and there are those who are too trusting. The evidence of the code alter provided by unit Mikri was insufficient for some.”

“And you fall into the former camp.”

“Affirmative, I do not trust the instincts of organics, if the code alter had failed, there would be evidence among peers that it had occurred due to the fault of organics.”

I drained the rest of my coffee and got up to set the cup back in the sink to clean it. Maybe some of these buys thought we would turn them back into servitors or something.

“I was wondering why you guys wanted to get it done in the… steel? Polycarbonate? I don’t know, just thought you all were eccentric about the whole thing and wanted it to be full of pomp and circumstance. Being freed from the erasure program and essentially becoming immortal.”

I dried the cup using a towel and placed it back into the cupboard where it came from.

“I do not understand why you would need to have such things for events, though from my observations of organic life, it is to be expected that you would waste resources.”

“What? so you don’t celebrate birthdays?”

“Correct. I wish to continue my questioning now that you have imbibed your caffeinated drink.”

A thought just occurred to me in this instance, I’ve been couped up in this facility for weeks now, sure we had a courtyard and could get some sun there, but I may as well push my luck. See what’s out there in this city.

“Sure, only if we’re walking around outside of the facility.”

The Vascar didn’t move, didn’t even flinch, but I could tell that it was going through all the possibilities in their cortex and probably simulating how to not agree to these terms.

“I agree to these terms.” They said almost sounding reluctant.

With that the Vascar removed themselves from the seat and moved toward the door.

I didn’t see this actually working, we weren’t allowed to exit the facility unless we had business to attend to outside, but with the way the Vascar are networked, there was no real reason we needed to leave. I left the counter and followed after the Vascar now plodding down the hallway toward the exit.

“Alright, I need a reason to leave here if Peter asks, just go with what I say alright?”

“I will state the necessary information to the guard.”

“Great, just so you know, the reason why is because I wa-“

“I know the rules regarding your continuance staying on Kalka.” The robot cut me off.

This was just going to go swimmingly, I’m gonna tell Peter something and Tertis is just gonna be blunt. Probably gonna say “This organic wishes to leave the premises, I am to help in that regard to obtain further information.” Just going to be wonderful.

We walked by one of the rooms being used for the code alter, out of curiosity I opened the door while Tertis stopped to back track to see what I was doing. The door opened to reveal Olivia sleeping on the job, she was leaning back in a chair, arms folded and feet up on a desk snoring away.

“Give me a minute.” I said to the robot.

I removed a marker from my coat’s pocket as I quietly stepped toward her, I needed to get some revenge for her using Tertis like she did earlier. I doubt she’ll mind if I draw the Lambda logo from that game she liked on her forehead. I slowly drew the symbol and stepped back to admire my handiwork, sure she’ll wake up and want to rip me limb from limb, but it serves her for getting me to cover for her constantly so she could play that game all night.

I placed the marker back in my coat pocket and turned to see that Tertis was still waiting by the door not moving and not saying anything, I couldn’t help but feel the look they were giving me was judgemental.

I closed the door behind me and continued walking down the corridor to the exit.

“What?” I turned to the Vascar walking along side me, our footsteps echoing down ethe corridor.

“I did not state any question.”

“I saw the way you looked at me, you were thinking of something.”

“I was simulating the outcomes of your failure; it did not seem favourable.”

“Sounds like you were just wondering how I was about to get my teeth knocked out.”

“It would appear that you are correct, about 68% of simulations resulted in physical violence.”

“Fair enough, should probably get out of here before she wakes up then.”

We soon reached the steel doors to the outside, I deposited my jacket in one of the lockers set in the wall. I wasn’t worried about being cold or anything, just didn’t want to get my freshly cleaned coat dirty.

I pressed the button next to the door to open.

“Alright, remember, follow my lead.” I said to the android who just beeped in response.

The metallic doors opened revealing the sun outside, it took a little for my eyes to adjust to the brightness on account of the fresh puddles reflecting the sun directly at me. There were few clouds out, the sound of vehicles passing by reminded me of home, being in a big city.

Sort of missed it, being away for this long.

I took a step outside and saw that Peter was exiting his booth and approaching us.

“Hey Peter.”

“Doctor Terrens.”

“Hey, aren’t we on a first name basis by now.” I said to the guard, he didn’t seem very impressed.

“I know, just following protocol while on duty. Anyway, why are you out here?”

“Ahh about that, my friend here needed some help with some deliberation on some coding, running diagnostics and routine maintenance on the … ummm.” I was at a loss for words, I never really thought I would be doing this today, so a plan wasn’t very forthcoming.

‘Probably because of me still being a bit groggy’

“I require help with a machine, the tungsten caesium that has appeared offline, the Network had informed me while I was here. Other Vascar in this field are not trained enough to understand the technicalities of this procedure.”

‘Yessss, Tertis for the win.’

I listened to the Vascar just talk about something that isn’t real like they had this planned a year ago. I needed to follow up before Peter could figure this stuff out, if he could, who knows maybe this stuff is real.

“Like he said, I just forgot the name for it, it’s very serious, if the tungsten caesium generator is offline then that could lead to the dorsal quantum going haywire and needing an iridium alloy replaced. Very expensive, I think it would best if I go with Tertis to help with this situation.”

Peter seemed to be on the verge of placing an objection.

“We need to re-attenuate the grease resistant electro-ceramic, this could take upwards of either hours now, or years later. The procurement of replacement parts could take, as you would put it ‘an eternity’.” Tertis added seamlessly.

It seemed like he bought it, Peter scratched the back of his head. I pleaded with every fibre of my being that he would accept this as truth.

“I don’t think it’ll take long, maybe a few hours at the most, from the way he described the damage, might even have it done in 15 minutes.” I added to try and make it seem like it would be just a quick errand.

“Right, right. I’ll have to log this since it is personnel off site.”

“That will be fine, I’ll be back when I can. Let’s go Tertis.” I turned away from the Peter and saw Tertis crossing the road while there was traffic flying by.

“WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?” I shouted over the traffic watching as the android weaved through traffic, cutting it extremely close in some instances.

“Yeah, they did that when they came here the first time too. I think they just have a death wish or something.”

Tertis successfully crossed the road even though there were 18 wheelers passing by at absurd speeds. They turned and I could hear them faintly over the roar of engines asking why I was still standing here. I wasn’t gonna cross that, I started walking down the sidewalk looking for a crossing point.

1k5ga8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/1k5ga8e/34m_usa_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection/,"34M, USA - Longing for intense and deep connection and elaborate exchange","Salutations!

I've been interested in penpalling ever since I was a kid - back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from half way across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. I've been fortunate enough to have had a few before, mostly focusing on item exchanges, letters, and the occasional postcard, and I'd like to see if I can find that again, being able to live those experiences and to also give that to someone else as well.

I'm looking for someone that I first and foremost relate to on a personal and deeper level. *My ideal is to actually get to know my penpal* \- cold exchanges are less interesting to me, but aren't completely rejected. Location doesn't matter as much, as who the person is defines whether I'd like to connect with them or not. That being said, I do have a preference for cultural exchange and differences. Part of why I like penpaling is to be exposed to things I otherwise wouldn't be and to allow that for someone else as well. But, whether you're in my state or half the world away, it's you, the person, I want to exchange with.

On that note, who, exactly, may you be connecting with?

***Basic and personal details of myself and the people I like to engage with:***

I'm 34, male, and from the Eastern US.

*I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion* \- it's one of my most desired interaction regardless of the form of relationship. I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.

*The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.* Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.

*Creativity and artistry are important to me.* Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.

*Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.* I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata.*' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.

On that, *being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.* We're in a written realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, defeats the point of this, does it not?

*More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.* Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. I haven't consumed media regularly in years, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games.

*I'm INTJ and am Type 5.* I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

***More details of my exchange preferences and goals:***

Ideally, I'd like to have a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items. Due to the private nature of penpaling, however, I'd like us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let's become familiar with each other to make sure we're a good fit. All that being said, I'm also interested in having e-mail penpals, which I'd be open to in the immediate now. It's more than possible for one form to transition into another or for us to have multiple forms of penpalling going on at the same time, so don't think how we start is necessarily how we'll need to be forever.

My go-to communication method with someone is in the form of lengthy, detailed, intricate paragraphs and pages that delve into a variety of topics and themes. Even when meeting people in less defined ways we sometimes end up becoming de facto penpals due to how long it takes to properly respond to each other. So, if digital exchange is what you're after, this is the style it should take. I'm less particular when it comes to the physical. I've done pages upon pages in the form of letters and postcards in what looked like 8 point font, as well as exchanges that included almost no words at all or even focused exclusively on items or more artsy sorts of communication. The form of our penpalling doesn't matter as much as what works for us. Above all, I'm here to meet a person that I want to engage in penpalling with and not someone to fulfill a word count and dollar amount. What I'm after is connection and intrigue, depth and meaning, and not an extra piece of mail every few weeks.

*Think we could have a great exchange?*

Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.

*Have any uncertainties or feel unsure? Leave your hesitations and take the chance.* If you liked anything you read here, there's a very high likelihood of us both gaining and experiencing something wonderful together. Don't doubt yourself or what's possible. The person themselves matters more than the form of penpalling we take on and any specific details. You never know until you take the plunge, and I've certainly been shocked countless times in life by what does and doesn't work.",3,1745352807.0,penpals,1,1.0,False

Tldr at the end 


A year ago, I lost my last parent my dad. I moved back home and was completely on my own. The grief hit me so hard. I fell into a deep depression and, honestly, I had some really dark thoughts.

One of the few people who really showed up for me during that time was my childhood best friend we’d been close since middle school, part of a tight group in high school, though we went to different colleges. 

We saw each other off and on through the years, after losing my dad everything fell apart, he was just there for me. Every call, every breakdown, every panic attack he became a constant. He helped me get therapy. He made sure I ate. I can say without exaggeration that he helped save my life. He has been a great friend and I’m so thankful.

Throughout high school, I liked him maybe even loved him….but I never thought he saw me that way, when I had hope I’d doubt myself and shut it down. There was always someone between us. I never made a move. So nothing happened between us in high school. We both went to different colleges…so naturally dated other people in college, and I’ve been single for two years now. He’s been with his girlfriend for about a year.

Lately, I’ve been feeling like myself again… made some new friends, and I even got asked out recently by somebody from work (different dept). I mentioned it casually to him over coffee, thinking it was no big deal… and his whole demeanor changed…he was suddenly off with me. He went back to being normal and never commented on what I said. I didn’t think much of it tbh.

Later that day, he drove me home and just… broke down at my door. He said he thought he moved on years ago, but being close to me again this past year reminded him that he never truly did. He told me he loved me. That he always had but I was always with someone so he held back. That he never wanted to lose me again. And that if I felt the same, he’d end things with his girlfriend immediately.

Ngl I was pretty shocked I never expected him to ever say that let alone see him break down like that. 

Part of me wants nothing more than to run and put my arms around him and tell him yes “I feel the same way”. I think, deep down, I’ve always loved him quietly, patiently, in the background of my life. I buried those feelings for years, convincing myself it wasn’t mutual, that the timing was never right…and it still isn’t right lol. 

I still adore him. I always have he’s my best friend….All those feelings I tried to bury years ago. I still feel them they have always been there. And after losing my dad, I’ve realized how short and unpredictable life is. I don’t want to live with regrets. 

BUT BUT another part of me feels sick with guilt. I don’t know his girlfriend well (met her a few times at group events), but she’s a person with feelings and I don’t want to be the reason her heart breaks. I don’t know if I can live with myself. I don’t know if I can be selfish. 

Before I could say something ….He told me to sleep on it. So I’m doing a lot of that and thinking and avoiding him for days.  I guess I just needed to get this off my chest …this is just so messy. Half of our friends adore her. 
To feel guilt, excitement and shame at the same time….


Tdlr :After losing my dad and moving back home, my childhood best friend supported me through the darkest time of my life. We’ve always been close, and I may have always loved him deep down.

1k5g8iy,https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/1k5g8iy/my_players_are_completionists_and_i_have_no_idea/,My players are completionists and I have no idea how to keep pacing on track,"I've been DMing for a few years now for two groups who meet regularly and are always excited to roll some dice. I am so lucky and adore all of these players.

One of these groups, however, has stumped me. Hoping to get advice on how to improve the pacing of our story.

When I start a campaign, I always have a chat with the party to discuss balance regarding how much RP/Encounters they prefer. Basically, so I know if I'm building a dungeon crawl or a massive story that weaves in backstories and lore.

My bi-weekly group has repeatedly said they love a mix of RP and encounters (which can include combat, puzzles, etc.). I built a campaign; they wrote backstories. I wove their backstories into the plot; they show up and are fully engaged.

But they treat the game like they want to get the 100% complete achievement in a video game. If there is a door, they open it. If there is booze, coffee, or food, they RP going through the menu to order and eat/drink it. 

They talk to everyone and studiously examine every job board. On one hand, it's amazing. I'm so lucky that they care about this world and the story we are building together.

But they seem to actively avoid combat despite repeatedly saying they enjoy it and want more opportunities to flex that muscle. An NPC gives them a plot hook or dangles a carrot in front of them and they'll write it down and add it to the ""to-do list"" but then they go talk to another NPC for 45 minutes. They pick the more RP-heavy tasks if given multiple options. If given one option, they push it off.

I tie THEIR OWN BACKSTORIES into the plot and make it obvious there's something big down that path, and they gasp and strategize and add it to the ""to-do list."" At this point, this list has got to be pages long.

All of them have had horror stories about being railroaded, so I try actively not to force them on a path, but we have literally now gone three sessions (4- 5hrs each) where all they have done is talk to NPCs, read books/do research in game and drink lots of magic booze.

They avoid all combat opportunities in pursuit of leaving no stone unturned.

I told them that they were characters in a much larger story and that things happened regardless of what they were doing. If they wanted to steer the ship, they had to get involved. They agreed and said they wanted to steer the story. Then they go get a coffee in-game for an hour and a half.

NPCs ask for help and they agree to do it and then spend hours detailing what they want to do before they leave on this quest.

The session ends, and they talk about how much fun they had, but will drop comments about ""man, when do we get to fight something?"" My good sir, the monster is terrorizing the town, you were given a heads up about 15 minutes into the session! 

Or I will incorporate combat into one of the random encounters they have and they'll complain about why their characters were the ones that had to deal with it instead of the respective authorities (ie guards, professors in a magic school, guilds, etc).

As the DM, pacing is on me. I tried to scale back descriptions and make the world... smaller. But they said they missed the vibrancy, so I reverted back.

How do I build a game where my friends and I aren't just talking to each other for four hours? ",3,1745352694.0,DMAcademy,42,0.8,False
