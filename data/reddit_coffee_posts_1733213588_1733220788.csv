1h5k6uw,https://www.reddit.com/r/KaffeBox/comments/1h5k6uw/day_3_amateur_review/,Day 3. Amateur review,"Today, I will be biased. I love both: the Lang√∏ra roaster (it was love at first sniff of their Fruktbombe); and coffees from Kibingo station (tried it first from amazing NoMad Coffee roaster in Barcelona). So, naturally, I was excited as a kid when I saw today's pick. You've been warned - I have warm feelings to today's combo. With that out of the way, let's get to the beans.

**ROAST:**

The roast is light enough. It's slightly darker than my blueprint Scandinavianroast from another Oslo roaster, yet still lighter than Day 1 geisha.

[Day 3 \(bottom\) vs The Blueprint \(top\)](https://preview.redd.it/6y23kev6sl4e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8700f5789a9682389876cc4850288431ecb2845)

**RECIPE:**

Considering there was no suggested brew method on the official webpage for today, I went for my regular approach to bourbon (and the one that worked for beans from Kibingo previously): a somewhat adjusted 4:6 method:

* **Ratio**: 1:15 (15/225)
* **Water temp**: 94 degrees
* **Method:**
   * Start - 40g bloom with swirl at the end to saturate all the grounds
   * 0:45 - pour until 90g
   * 1:30 - pour until 135g
   * 2:15 - pour until 190g
   * 2:45 - pour until 225g. Very gentle swirl at the end
   * **TBT**: 4:00 minutes

**AROMA:**

Here's where things become both disappointing and tricky, yet very exciting. Right off the canister, the aroma was just cardboard. Plain unpleasant. It didn't matter whether one smells the beans or the cardboard itself. Not so much coffee aroma. However, as the beans ""breathed"", the aroma changed a bit, and some notes of suede (quite pleasant, I must admit üòÖ) started to reveal themselves. However, no matter the slight transformation, it's clear that the surface oils of the beans absorbed the smell of the cardboard canister, and that's what was left.

And here's the interesting part - once you overcome the disappointment of the first moments and start grinding, you realize that you're onto something exciting after all. The coffee aroma starts to ""jump"" out of the grinder - very pleasant. The beans, when ground, smelled yummy. Sweet, milk chocolate, probably some roasted nuts, and something fruity in the background - something tropical (lychee, maybe?) that combines sweetness and some acidity in the back.

During the blooming, aroma transformed even more and revealed some green, fruity aroma with a slight touch of tobacco leaves (but definitely not the cheap tobacco that ruins everything - quite contrary here).

And then, in the cup, the aroma finally reached it's final destination üëè To me, it was a distinct combination of black tea with some caramelized almonds. Very pleasant.

**TASTE:**

https://preview.redd.it/ow01mhu8yl4e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=acc989990c68b960f7264b1ecc629652e8d45915

In the beginning, the taste felt intense and bold. The impression was probably influenced by the comparison with the previous 2 days. But the brew method usually yields a more intense cup for me as well. So nothing unexpected here. At the same time, it was very refreshing. As the cup cools down, things become not as straightforward, more complex, and even more exciting - I really enjoyed analyzing this brew. The cup was sweet (also characteristic of the brew method), with delightful acidity at the back of the tongue. One might get some fresh greens, which I consider nice. The tropical fruit I smelled in the aroma transformed into something that reminded me of the sweet cherries in the taste. And then it all went into floral notes with distinct black tea.

All in all, I enjoyed this cup. Refrain from letting the cardboard smell, in the beginning, turn you away from enjoying this coffee. I think the brew method might affect your experience here, so I'm keen to hear if you used a different brew technique and got different aroma/taste notes in your cup.",1,1733220527.0,KaffeBox,0,1.0,False

So let's say it's true. In a few years 1 coin is 200.000 or 500.000 or whatever?

So, you cash out. But then THAT money needs to come from somewhere? I get it that when people sell at a loss (Bought for 100. Sold for 50) you have 50

But what if bitcoin reaches a new high. It's not just me but hundreds (And even countries now it seems) cash out. I paid 20.000 for a coin. Sold it for 100.000 Now it's not a number in a cloud somewhere. It's money cash in the bank i can buy a house and food for. Where did the 80.000 come from? And when more people cash out. Where did the 500.000.000 come from? Surely eventually there is so many Bitcoin 'value' there is no actual cash to match it? Or is, in the end, only the cash money people bought bitcoin for can actually pay out. Like, an Elon Musk or other billionairs or whatever suddenly decides to sell a HUGE amount of bitcoin that we, the little man, are left with coins of few value? I must admin a fear of mine is that, in the end, the really, really wealthy end up getting even more wealthy and we, the small people who made Bitcoin real with small cash saved from a 40 hour work week end up with the short end of the stick again.

Not talking when you send money to a wallet to buy something as digital currency. We are not there yet i can buy a house or coffee with bitcoin. Someday perhaps.",1,1733220495.0,CryptoHelp,1,1.0,False

I tried tasting the water that was boiled in the kettle, and it had a very distinct plastic taste. I haven't been satisfied with my coffee lately, and I think this might be the reason. Has anyone else had this experience? 

I use zerowater remineralised with Epsom salt and baking soda. The plastic taste is also there when using tap water, although not as pronounced. Non-boiled remineralised water does not have the plastic taste, as well as water boiled in my stovetop Hario. 

I tried cleaning it with vinegar, and afterwards with baking soda, as suggested on Fellow's website. I did not notice any difference. 

I tried contacting Fellow, but they couldn't help since I'm in Europe.

Curious if anyone else has had this experience! I've borrowed this unit from a friend who went travelling, and I'm considering to get one myself. Trying to figure out if it's a fault of just this unit or if all kettles have this problem. 

To avoid confusion: I do not mean the plastic smell of the base of the kettle after heating up. I did notice this, but it doesn't bother me as long as the water tastes good. ",1,1733220309.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

1h5k48g,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Rendezvous517/comments/1h5k48g/roommate_issue/,Roommate issue,"My daughter is in her senior year of college. She found a girl who had signed a lease to an apartment close to campus. They met twice and talked over coffee in which my daughter expressed how she was noise sensitive(mainly at night when studying), liked to keep things clean and didn‚Äôt like a lot of people over all the time. The girl casually mentioned that she was Christian.  My daughter told her how she was raised primarily Jewish, but her dad was Catholic and her grandfather was Indian so she was very open minded and had fun celebrating many holidays and traditions. We both met the roommates mom who was a beautiful, Southern, put-together, and a truly warm lovely woman. My daughter and I decided it was a go and I signed a notarized letter agreeing to pay for half the rent and utilities and the girl‚Äòs parents added my daughter in an addendum as a roommate (but still not the leaseholder). That‚Äôs when the nightmare began. The girl told her she was previously involved in many harmful and wreckless things, had anxiety and been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and then found ‚ÄúGod‚Äù that consequently solved everything and was now set free. Which was fine. My daughter is very open-minded. You do you. However, the girl started making my daughter question her beliefs and criticized a Tibetan prayer flag with positIve quotes on love,friendship, peace, etc and basically asked her to remove it because it invited the devil, along with Hindu, Buddhist and Muslim religious practices. My daughter was insulted because her grandfather was raised Hindu and still celebrates the holidays and traditions. The roommate also pointed out things she ‚Äúobserved‚Äù which she found unlike her ‚Äúnormal‚Äù teenage activities and expressed how she thought Jesus could help my daughter, like it helped the roommate and my daughter could be free from anxiety and worry. My daughter felt insulted, criticized and a bit frightened. My daughter pulled away and started completely doing her own thing and avoiding her at all costs; trying to avoid conflict, criticism and stress. Her roommate then started being extra mean, critical and seemed to be gaslighting my daughter and borderline bullying her. My daughter is sweet and unconfrontational. She tried to be nice and accommodating, and avoid her roommate and the apartment to avoid conflict. It hasn‚Äôt worked. My daughter calls me 5 times a day questioning herself and crying. The roommate has many symptoms of a narcissist. She seems to be enjoying the antagonizing and bullying and is unable to listen to my daughters point of view and always has to be right. (ie. putting one jacket with a zipper in the dryer which is right next to my daughter‚Äôs room late at night when she knows my daughter is noise sensitive and my daughter kindly asked her to refrain from doing laundry after 10pm on a school night. Also inviting people over without warning and being rude and loud. It‚Äôs pissing me off because I feel like my daughter is submissive and just taking it. I personally would fight back. Do the same things she‚Äôs doing to my daughter to show her how it feels. My daughter keeps telling me that I don‚Äôt understand, and that by doing that it will only make the situation worse and it would be stooping down to the roommates level and it‚Äôs not who she is. Maybe she‚Äôs more mature than me but its not fair!! The worst part is that the rent is $1800 a month and I am working extra hours and pulling from my savings because I wanted my daughter to have a memorable senior year considering all the COVID issues when she started, along with some personal challenges she‚Äôs fought to overcome. I feel so bad for her. I told her to ask her roommate to try to find someone that‚Äôs she is more compatible with for Spring semester. Her roommate said no. I can‚Äôt afford to pay her current rent (which I think we are legally bound to because of the notarized letter) and a new rent somewhere else‚Ä¶.otherwise, I‚Äôd remove her from the situation.

Your actions or rather inactions hurt me deeply and as much as I wants to text you and tell you how much you‚Äôve hurt me, I know that it wouldn‚Äôt make any difference and that nothing will ever change. For the times that we‚Äôve known each other and the times that you‚Äôve hurt me, I‚Äôve tried to justify your actions and dismiss my hurts feelings but I am done trying to understand nor do I have any sympathy left for you. It‚Äôs always about you and your feelings and never mine. I can‚Äôt keep trying to understand why you hurt me when I‚Äôm left hurting times and times again. I fought for your love and love is something that I shouldn‚Äôt have to fight for. I‚Äôve fought enough and you should‚Äôve known that. I give up because you never try. All I needed was to see you try and to see that you cared. The love that I had for you was real and it take everything in me to stop myself from loving you. I needed you when it mattered the most and you didn‚Äôt even have the guts to be there for me when I did everything I could to show you that I cared. I am hurt and I don‚Äôt think I know how to look past this hurt. I forgive you times and times again but all I‚Äôve ever seen was empties apologies. I love you, I forgave you, I tried for you even at the cost of my own dignity. That‚Äôs love and that love came from me. I don‚Äôt know why I have so much love for you, you didn‚Äôt deserve that. I never once feel love or value by you, there was no love coming from your side and that‚Äôs how I know I truly and deeply love you from my own heart. I did all I could but I can no longer love you at an expense or my own heart. I spent the last 2 years hurting everyday and you knows nothing about it. That‚Äôs not the love that I deserve so you‚Äôre right I deserve better. My love was never wasted, it taught me that I am capable of loving someone unconditionally and I know that one day someone will appreciate what I bring. If you need my forgiveness to move on and be happy then I forgive you but I hope you know that you hurt someone that gave you her all.  Love for me is through thick and thin and not just when you have it right. Love for me is when you pick each other up when they‚Äôre down. Love for me is someone that stays when it‚Äôs ugly and never about external or material things.

It's weird because I felt safe, and calm for the first time around a spider. I've never felt anything like this. 
I just thought that sharing this may help someone, even if you feel a disconnection, Loki is always somewhere next to us. I'll go make them some coffee now<3

Then after two days, the weird almost throbbing sensation switch to two other teeth. It went away for a couple of days, only for the sensation to return on my teeth lower front teeth, and I really only feel this at night when I‚Äôm trying to sleep. 

Does anyone have any idea what this could be? I think I am mildly sick, which I did mention before, but I don‚Äôt remember any prior sickness causing my teeth to throb randomly. I‚Äôm still trying to book an appointment with a periodontist but I figured I‚Äôd come here again and ask if anyone‚Äôs ever heard of something like this? My sinuses are a lil wonky, which is the main reason I think I may have a mild illness, but I truly do not understand this strange sensation. It feels like when you‚Äôve been grinding your teeth and your mouth gets a lil sore, but I‚Äôve been very conscious over the last week of that and have been making sure my teeth don‚Äôt touch and that my tongue rests on the roof of my mouth at all times to prevent any grinding. Could I be doing it without realizing it? Thats the only thing I can compare this feeling to. At this point I‚Äôm just very confused about what I‚Äôm feeling in my mouth and it‚Äôs getting on my nerves. 

Edit: I should have mentioned that I have completed Invisalign treatment and have retainers. I‚Äôve had my retainers for like three months or so and I‚Äôm still wearing them all day and night except for when I‚Äôm eating, I had them out a bit longer today by like an hour or so because I had some coffee and I only drink water with my retainers in, but I‚Äôve had them in for the last 6 hours and the sensation could be compared to the feeling you get when your retainers feel a bit tight, but that usually goes away after the first hour of me having them back in, it‚Äôs weird for it to start up again when I go to bed and have had them in for hours.

To start off with background, I am a college student (paying completely out of pocket btw due to working a full time job two summers in a row and putting away nearly every penny) (just wanted to flex because im proud B] ) and my brother is still in highschool

Ive grown up in a household without any sugary foods. So any treats were rare until we got old enough to supply our own treats. My brother has a history of eating my stuff. Like it is so bad my family has to hide any and all sweets. My parents are always sympathetic towards him and scold me for getting upset. The worst part about it is that he lies about it and my parents cover for him. Telling me that I should have hidden it or that it's a communal space and you don't have a fridge in your room or even that ""He can't help it"". Every time it's my fault. Every. God. Damn. Time. 

They tell me that it's compulsive and he can't help it, ""shaming him is only going to make it worse"".

The best my parents have done is tell me to clear off a shelf in my room for my snacks and label stuff that needs to be refrigerated. 

examples:

One time at my grad BBQ, my friend bought our group two bags of chips and my brother stole a whole bag and when I went to his room to get it back. (Will specify I had been drinking) he asked for a handful and I agreed. He gave me the handful and told me ""I gave you your handful"" and pretty much told me to fuck off. My mom told me ""not to ruin a fun night""

Eating my entire bag of crackers I bought for school in one night and getting pissed off when I asked. My dad covered with ""I'm sure in probably just fell in the cupboard"" and the moment he left the car dad turned to me and said ""You know he ate them and I know he ate them, but he feels bad about it and shaming him will only make him hide it more""

The worst time was while I was out of town for five days to see a concert, before then I had bought a big tub of icecream with plans for it for when I got back. My brother was eating so much of it that my parents threw it out to stop him. Without asking or telling me. My mom saying ""well I don't have to tell you everything"". It got into a fight so bad my mom called me ungrateful and got out of the car threatening to walk home from the airport in the rain. I'm not allowed to bring this up anymore. 

Another thing is, 
 A: I am autistic with fluctuating food related sensory issues

B: have really bad periods to the point I am completely out of commission the first day due to pain and extreme fatigue. My family, friends, and boyfriend are all aware of this. My sensory issues also worsen around this time.

So to finally start, today was the dreaded day one of my period, it being study week I stayed home and accidentally slept until noon. My boyfriend came over and surprised me with a little goodie box. It had chocolates, candy bars, and two poptart packages. I was so happy. 

While lying on the couch and watching battle bots I opened one of the packets and ate a single poptart. My stomach felt kind of off so I left the other one for later. 

Getting kind of tired I decided to go back upstairs to lie in bed, forgetting my goodie box on the coffee table. I passed out and woke up about four hours later in horrible pain (the joys of being a woman). I couldn't get up. I wanted my other treats so I texted my dad and asked for my goodie box. He brought it to me. Scanning it, it was missing my second poptart packet. I sighed with frustration and texted my brother who was at work asking him about it. He responded with ""nah knee it was urs and backed off"" I replied ""there's one missing"" and he then countered by guliting me about it, citing some stomach issues he's been having.

This is total bs, my mom has a gluten allergy and my dad's not a fan of sweets. No one else could have eaten it.

Later after taking some pain killers I forced myself up for supper, telling my parents about the theft of my treat. I was immediately met with ""can you not come down the stairs with that attitude? How about trying to fix it?"" From my mother. When I mentioned that he lied and gulited me she responded with ""Well your brother's afraid of you Rats"". I being in horrible pain and not in the mood to take this, snarkily remarked ""not afraid enough to stop stealing"" while serving myself supper. I proceeded to go back upstairs and softly cry in my room. Only to look over at the parfait I had made myself the night before to see he had taken spoonful taken off the top. 

My parents are saying that I'm over reacting and that we should talk about it as a family after having ""preliminary discussions"" with my brother. But frankly I don't see what there is to talk about. My brother stole and ate a gift from my boyfriend while I was sleeping to escape debilitating pain.

So please be honest with me, am I being totally petty here? Because I don't know what to do. I'm sitting here awake because I'm so pissed off about it. This doesn't feel fair, I never eat his stuff, and the times I accidentally have I've replaced it. I've tried hiding it in a special cupboard, buying him extra, labeling it. Nothing has worked.

Here's why those periodic visits to the dental clinic are so important:.



**1. Curing Problems Before**¬†

They Become Woes Ever have a toothache come up from seemingly nowhere and blossom in what seems like minutes? The thing about many dental problems is that they start small and may be painless, but within moments they can balloon to major issues if they go unaddressed. Regular appointments will help your dentist catch this in time before they start growing.



For instance, a small cavity takes just couple of minutes to be filled in the routine visit, but in ignorance, that gives room for root canal or tooth loss. Or better put, routine visits are more about confronting minute problems before they gain ground.



**2. Prevention of Gum Diseases**

Gum disease is sometimes called periodontal disease and it is the leading causes of tooth loss in adults. This initially comes about as gingivitis, which are red swollen gums that can lead to more severe infections if it is not treated.



Regular checkup and cleaning by a dentist remove plaque and tartar - the two main causes of gum disease. The dentist will inspect your gums on this visit and point out some ways you can care for your teeth in the comfort of your home.



**3. Oral Health = Overall Health**

Your mouth is an indicator of your health. When he checks your teeth during a routine dental checkup, your dentist actually views your mouth for any health conditions related to it.



Oral diseases such as infection, dryness, or gum inflammation may, from time to time, become pointers to problems like diabetes, heart disease, or even cancer. Your dentist will be able to spot them early through regular check-ups and suggest what to do.



**4. Professional Cleaning**¬†

That Can't Be Done at Home No matter how frequently you brush and floss you must do it daily there are just some places in the mouth that you can't reach and clean. Plaque builds up becomes tartar which only professionals remove.



A dental cleaning will leave your mouth feeling fresher and healthier. This is achieved using specialized equipment to remove tartar and polish the teeth. It also helps avoid bad breath, so visiting will be worthwhile for both your confidence and your health.



**5. Oral Cancer Detection**

Oral cancer is serious but really very treatable if it's identified on time. Your dentist would like to look inside your mouth and discover any unusual lumps, sores, or even some whitening that might prove an early sign of oral cancer during your visit check-up.



It's a mere five minute screening but literally save a life.



**6. For Longer Smile Endurance**

If you just take care of your teeth properly, they can serve you your entire lifetime. These routine check-ups keep your smile healthy and strong-whether it's fixing chips in the teeth or more major problems, like tooth sensitivity-all the way to making sure your oral hygiene routine is working effectively.



For instance, most dentists in Mirdif welcome the use of advanced facilities and practices in monitoring your dental and gum health and providing you with personal suggestions on how you can maintain them perfectly.



**7. Gradual Reducing of Dental Anxiety**

If you are afraid of going to the dentist, then frequent visits will benefit you. The more you visit, the more you become used to the surroundings, the people, and the treatment. Most of the [dental clinic in mirdif](https://www.drpaulsdentalclinic.com/dental-clinic-mirdif/) will work towards the comfort of their patient so that you may find a friendly atmosphere along with even sedation if required.



**8. Being a good role model for your children**

Being a parent, these are the best times to exhibit good habits to your little ones. Children grow and learn by observing the surroundings, and if their parents are keen on taking proper care of their oral cavities, they too become serious about it. Child-friendly dental clinics in Mirdif have made this easily possible for little kids with their fun and non-stressful environment.



Regular dental checkup is more than clean teeth. It's part of healthy living and preventing certain diseases that might have their way into your mouth, threatening quality of life.

Maybe a soft reminder, to have an appointment scheduled for that visit next time to your most trusted dental clinic in Mirdif and take the very first stride to that healthy smile, toward that much healthier YOU. It is a saying after all that prevention is always costlier and better than being cured.",1,1733217710.0,u_Rohith_Warrier,0,1.0,False

I've had no colonoscopy/biopsy and I now know that they can't diagnose without (this wasn't you may have or it looks like. I was told you HAVE several times.) 

Since then I've had around 3 weeks where things have been manageable, currently on my second week off work. 
I've been to my gp and he gave me codeine that made things worse, 111 sent me to hospital where I was given antibiotics and buscopan and sent on my way. I'm waiting for a call back for another appointment today. 

These symptoms started in June of 2023 and are only getting worse. 

It feels like I'm getting nowhere with the NHS, the Dr I spoke with at hospital jokingly said it could be 2028 before gastro see me and it sums it up. 

I'm in fairly constant pain, constant toilet trips and eating very little. Ive lost around 3 stone this year but because I told them I've cut back to 1 coffee a day (from 4-5) they've put the weight loss down to that. 

I'm worrying about all the time off work I'm having, I'm worried about my mental health declining and it feels like I'm getting zero help. 

Short of acting on it and exaggerating my symptoms I really don't know what else I can do. I've tried to go private through work but they require 5 years medical history, I have 4 (before that I was registered at a different Dr but had not seen them in at least 15 years) 

This is a rant more than anything, everything points towards IBD but I've had nothing to confirm or treat. I got a sick note for my second week off and they've signed me off until the end of the year with no plan on actually doing anything! ",1,1733217614.0,IBD,0,1.0,False

(Slice of Life Scenario with added Angst and Drama) 

‚ú®Searching for a Detailed, Romantic Slice of Life Scenario With Added Drama and Angst Slow-Burn - Long-Term Scenario ‚ú®

‚ú®Female looking for anyone writing as Male‚ú®

I‚Äôm not at all replacing any current partners but simply looking to add to my writing scenarios and outlets! 


I LOVE a slow burn, all the angst and drama that comes with it, whether that be as a friends to lover trope (one of my favourites!), forbidden love to strangers to lovers just meeting for the first time or a complete difference in personalities, and aesthetics, but with a mutual deep connection and understanding of one another. Simply like say a grumpy x sunshine, black cat x golden retriever, sort of trope; one where on the exterior the male character can appear cut off, a little tough perhaps, and grumpy but with her he‚Äôs so vastly different. He‚Äôs vulnerable, gentle, and understanding; something he isn‚Äôt with just everyone else. She helps him to become softer, much, much more gentle all round, whilst he helps her to become less of a pushover or people pleaser. 

For this scenario, I‚Äôm simply looking to mix the world of fame with romance in very much a Slice of Life way, with lots of slow-burning romance and added drama! - I feel you can never have too much of that and adds a lot to the storyline itself! Something that‚Äôs very much realistic where the writing tugs on your heart strings, after all everything isn‚Äôt always going to be wonderful and happy 100% of the time! It has all the similarities of a general Slice of Life premise with the two characters falling for one another yet with added depth of the implications of their fame and recognition within the public eye. From potential scrutiny of the public themselves - even just the simple grazing of their hands - both on social media and from news outlets, to paparazzi and reporters desperate to follow and generate money from their every move. Whilst falling for one another they have the added pressure of external influences to consider; less privacy and security of that of any other, ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, couple out there within the early stages of their relationship. Those that are able to head out on dates, even just for coffee, without being recognised! It just brings *so* much added drama, which I love!!! There‚Äôs just so many ways to navigate it all which is exciting! 

I have no ‚Äòset in stone‚Äô concepts so that we‚Äôre able to come up with an idea entirely together to ensure we‚Äôre both happy, content and invested in what we‚Äôre writing - after all it is a partnership! Especially as this is *your* character to write as however you please and see for! Particularly so that it‚Äôs your choice entirely as to *why* they are famous. For my character, I am envisioning her as being like this ‚Äòrelatively new onto the music scene‚Äô, but very much high in demand and taking the world of music by storm, kind of pop princess singer songwriter?


For some rough outlines, what line of work is your within? Are they also within that same field of work or entirely opposing careers? From actors, to singers and songwriters, or perhaps more within the athletic department? Why have their paths crossed? Strangers who have met at an event or even perhaps two individuals who have always known of one another? Or perhaps a chance meeting when purposefully brought together for a certain situation, event or work opportunity?

I roleplay in first person and would consider myself to be very detailed and descriptive; so I‚Äôm hoping to find someone of a similar match. I really enjoy a lot of back and forth rapid replies, rather than say one or two messages a week, but of course appreciate that that can‚Äôt always be the case! - just simply that I‚Äôm often able to provide those quick responses, particularly in the evenings, and that I‚Äôm also seeking this in a writing partner too! I‚Äôve been writing overall for around ten years; including with the same writing partner during that timeframe until the start of the year - so I‚Äôm well versed within the longevity of writing with the same partner hahahaha! 

Please let me know if you‚Äôre interested by private message, leaving behind your age too - as again I‚Äôm only looking to write with someone of a similar age range - also leaving behind a little information and some insight into what your own interests and any ideas you may have!

Anyway I currently have A LOT of family staying with me, 5 people, I have 2 spare rooms so 3 of the people are fine but the other 2 I popped in the converted attic space, which sounds bad but I swear it‚Äôs not that bad, it‚Äôs quite a large area and has a couch, coffee table, tv etc plus the 2 double beds I put up there for the 2 people to sleep in. 

My problem is it‚Äôs fine in winter, but it‚Äôs currently summer here with a lot of 30¬∞C days, and the attic space is SO HUMID AND WARM. Uncomfortably so, and I feel awful, my family arrived today so I need to figure something out asap, I was thinking I could get a dehumidifier but I read that they can increase the temp of the room even more because it‚Äôs an electric appliance. 

Looking for recommendations on what to do, to be frank I don‚Äôt understand why the space doesn‚Äôt have a window, the walls are massive and one is the side of the house, it very easily could‚Äôve had windows. Anyway, the door is a regular door, kinda small, and is a few steps up, so putting a fan in the door way to blow cool air in is kinda hard. 

I was thinking I could maybe get a dehumidifier, plus like 2 or 3 powerful pedestal fans, do you think that would help with the heat? Again any recommendations are greatly appreciated as I‚Äôm quite stuck on what to do!",1,1733217329.0,lifehacks,5,0.57,False
1h5jhan,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlusSize/comments/1h5jhan/are_dating_apps_even_worth_it/,Are dating apps even worth it ,"25F, I decided to go out of my comfort zone and create profiles on hinge/bumble/coffee meets bagel. I pulled some photos from my Instagram to put on my dating profiles but I tend to wear a lot of form flattering clothing and the photos are taken by my friends on flattering angles so it might not be accurate. I did really try to find full body photos . I have tinder trauma from when I was 18 and the last time I ever had apps before I do now, I was told by some clown I got emotionally invested in that I catfished him and that‚Äôs the last thing I want to do to someone, so I made sure my profile explicitly states I am plus sized. I have had maybe 2-3 matches on hinge in the last 1.5 months all that started off well but fizzled out because the guy stopped putting effort into responding. The likes I‚Äôve gotten are from people who are not my types and have deal breakers (smoker, religious, looking for hook ups only, too far away, etc) I don‚Äôt think my face is that bad, granted I‚Äôm trying to take my health seriously and lose a few pounds to feel better mentally and physically so if successful my face will slim down a little bit. Is it the algorithm? Is it me? I paid for premium for a trial period on these apps and still nothing. I‚Äôm not paying anymore because nothing was really going on. I tend to swipe no on a lot of guys who are out of my league, but the guys I send likes or messages to that I feel are more my type or in my league at least career/looks wise that MIGHT be attracted to me never like back. Can anyone share their experiences online dating as a plus sized woman? Good or bad lol

1h5jgdc,https://i.redd.it/ccrnqc8lol4e1.jpeg,"‚ÄúFailed‚Äù first date with a friend I‚Äôve known for a few months, what now? ","Had a great first date but woke up to the dreaded rejection text, so what now?

Hey everyone! The other night I (21M) went out with a girl (20F) who I had been friends with for a few months. When I first met her in the beginning of this year, I thought she was kinda cute but I was in a relationship at the time. When that one finally ended, I'd still her a few times a week, as I originally had, in a lounge designated to people in our major. It's a spot where people in our major do HW and stuff. We mostly did our own work but made conversation and found out we have a lot in common morally, politically, value-wise, and found out she lived on my street lol

Again, I didn‚Äôt think too much of it at the time and assumed we were just friends and being polite. Over time I realized that I liked her and I started to see that those friendly signs were actually signs of interest. She‚Äôd smile at me and laugh at all my jokes. Eventually, I decided why not and asked her out to Mass and dinner afterwards and she said yes! In that week leading up to the date we still chatted as normal.

Come date time I picked her up at her house. Her parents were interested in seeing who I was so I introduced myself and shook hands and all of that. We go to Mass and it was great! We sat very close to each other and our arms were touching the whole mass. There were times where she‚Äôd lean in to look at the missal or tap my shoulder to say something. I went for a hug for the sign of peace and she hugged me so tight lol. Dinner went well afterwards! After that, she asked if I wanted to go back to her house and have coffee and dessert with her parents and some family friends and I agreed! They all liked me and I think they even thought or assumed I was her bf lol.

When it was time to leave, I went for the hug and she latched on tight and told her I‚Äôd see her around campus. I texted her when I got home telling her I had a great time and went to bed. I woke up to the dreaded rejection text this morning (I‚Äôll attach it in this post).

I was honestly really hurt by it (as all rejection stings). I know she‚Äôs busy since she‚Äôs applying for med school soon but we had talked about that (and she said that I‚Äôve been so patient with her and thinks it would work out). It leads me to believe that she didn‚Äôt feel a spark or something. I was a little confused because we had known each other for several months and clearly she thought there was enough spark to agree to go out. I'm confused on how to proceed. I want to add I truly do like her as a friend and severing all connection would be awkward bc I see her around campus (and we both agreed to take a specific class together next semester). At the same time, I‚Äôm scared that holding on would result in false hope that she‚Äôll change her mind. I had to resist the urge to try and ‚Äúfight‚Äù it out and ask her to reconsider and all of that üò≠ I‚Äôve only been in this position once before and I severed the connection bc I found out the girl made fun of me to her friends for asking her out.

Here‚Äôs where it gets interesting:

 I saw her today in that shared lounge area. There was another girl in there too. She said hey guys and I responded hey but she only looked at the girl. I tried to make eye contact with her but she kept staring at her computer. Eventually I had to ask her a question (about something she agreed to help me with) and she responded pretty flat and still staring at her computer. 

I think she may have been talking about me to the other girl by texting while I was in the room! This is a huge assumption but if true is incredibly childish. Eventually both leave the room for 15 mins and I leave to fill my bottle. I hear them climb up the stairs and heard the one girl say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs so weird!‚Äù Upon seeing me the two immediately shut up and looked tense. 

Eventually more people came in the library and she did end up looking at me when I told a story. I tried to give it back and smile but I‚Äôm pretty sure she looked away quickly. 

Idk if it‚Äôs a classic case of both people overthinking and a big misunderstanding (her thinking I‚Äôm mad and me thinking she‚Äôs mad). I can‚Äôt stand this. My closest friend said it doesn‚Äôt hurt to shoot a text and explain I‚Äôm not mad at her, but idk about this. I feel like I wouldn‚Äôt be giving her space and in addition to this I like it‚Äôs her job to reach out to me her job to reach out to me",2,1733217197.0,GuyCry,1,1.0,False

We've been together a year, I love him and I am attracted to him but I need some resolution to this otherwise I risk losing him? ","We first met in January after less than a week of texting on a dating app. I thought he was mostly interested in me for sex even though he said he wanted something long term. He's attractive, and has a stable career. I liked him for his conversations which was why I agreed to meet him.

He doesn't have kids which made me really interested in him. What stopped me from dating older guys in the past was that the vast majority of them have kids.  I don't want to be some kind of step mom at my age.

Tbf I was involved with one older guy before. He was 39 at the time if I recall correctly and I was 22. But really that was mostly me testing the waters and I knew it would never last. Before that I was with 2 guys around my age. So I only have 3 bodies under me before I met my current boyfriend.

He literally asked me on the first date to be girlfriend and we had not even finished our appetizers. Call me stupid but I said yes. During our date he asked me if I've been to monument X which is a world famous monument in our country.  I said no. He was flabbergasted and said are you free this week? I can take you there. I said yes again (by the way I had agreed to be his girlfriend before he asked to take me on a trip, he didn't seduce me with a trip or anything like that). So our second date was at the check in counter of the airport. He joked no more coffee dates for you. You've been upgraded to coffees in planes. 

3 months later I moved in with him. My lease was getting over and he said why should you waste your money on rent while I own a house. I agreed since I was spending more time at his place and basically subsidizing my roommate.

We have had no issues in our relationship except initial trust issues as he believed that I would leave him for a younger/hotter/richer/smarter guy. Like if I didn't reply right away he would get worried and twice he ""broke up"" with me. Once I was late to a date and another time I had to cancel a date. So he said both times that you're free to pursue the man you believe will truly make you happy. I'm ending this, I wish you the best. He was never rude or insulting or disrespectful. But I didn't accept his break up after I showed him that I really was not talking to anyone else let alone dating or sleeping with someone else. And he's not controlling. He doesn't restrict my movement or require me to give him an accounting of my day or restrict my use of social media. I mainly only use IG for business reasons (I am not an influencer)

Things have been good. But he does have a much higher sex drive than me. I kind of lied to him initially describing to him things I liked sexually. So he assumed I have a sky high sex drive. Turns out he's got a libido the exceeds mine easily except when I'm ovulating. And he says you're lucky that we're not the same age, for it we had met when I was in my 20s you would be always sore. 

This was good initially as I did things to keep him satisfied in the bedroom but I can't constantly be giving him sex. More than a few times I've had to say no. He generally takes it well in that he's not pushy. No means no to him which is great. But he then says things like if I'm not attractive to you we should break up. You can't live the rest of your life with a man you're not attracted to. Sex shouldn't become a chore. 

Either have sex when I don't want or have to constantly smooth my boyfriend's fragile ego? ",0,1733217168.0,relationship_advice,12,0.2,False

I know it sounds clich√©, but hear me out. For years, I focused way too much on what was going wrong in my life things I didn‚Äôt have, goals I hadn‚Äôt reached, or situations I wished were different. It felt like I was always chasing happiness but never really finding it.

Then, about a year ago, I read somewhere that writing down just three things you‚Äôre grateful for every day can help shift your mindset. I was skeptical at first, but I figured, *Why not give it a try?*

The first few days felt forced. I‚Äôd write stuff like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful for coffee,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful I didn‚Äôt forget my keys.‚Äù But over time, it became easier, and I started noticing all the little things I used to take for granted‚Äîlike a kind word from a stranger, a sunny day, or even the fact that I had a comfortable bed to sleep in.

The impact was subtle at first, but now it‚Äôs huge. I find myself complaining less and appreciating more. It hasn‚Äôt solved all my problems, of course, but it‚Äôs made the good moments shine brighter.

If you‚Äôre feeling stuck or overwhelmed, I can‚Äôt recommend this enough. Grab a notebook, or even just use your phone, and jot down three things you‚Äôre grateful for each day. It‚Äôs so simple, but it can really shift your perspective.

If that's you, I was wondering if you could give me an opinion on which headline you think draws more eyes in a tourist area.  I just bought a restaurant and know fuck all about restaurants, but have done 15 years of direct response marketing building my other businesses.  Nevertheless, It's good to have honest opinions.  :)  Never offended.

Obviously it's just basic ad-copy text thrown together fast in some image app, and fonts will changed, and a tiny bit of graphic work (that doesn't distract) will go into it.  For more background it's a very industrial/metal/chic restaurant/cafe/bar with retro Asia design.

Edit:  For Direct Mail, later, I'll probably use some base of this but with a bit more text to sell the USP/WIIFM stuff.

# 

Hey! üëã Tired of eating dinner off a wobbly IKEA table or your coffee table? Let's talk about how to choose a dining table that'll make your space look awesome and actually work for your life.

# Why Your Dining Table Matters More Than You Think

Listen up - a dining table isn't just a chunk of wood with legs. It's the MVP of your living space. This is where:

* Late-night pizza happens
* Board game marathons go down
* Your drunk friends spill wine (sorry, table)
* Family drama unfolds during holiday dinners

# Measure Twice, Buy Once: The Space Survival Guide

Pro tip: Don't be that person who buys a table that makes your room look like a furniture disaster zone.

**Measuring Hacks:**

* Grab a tape measure
* Leave at least 3 feet around the table
* Account for chair movement
* Consider your clumsy friends who need extra space

# Style Matters: Pick Your Vibe

Your table should scream ""this is me"" without actually screaming. Popular styles include:

* **Minimalist**: For the ""I watched too much Marie Kondo"" crowd
* **Farmhouse**: Basically Pinterest's favorite aesthetic
* **Industrial**: When you want to look like you live in a cool loft
* **Traditional**: Your grandma would approve
* **Scandinavian**: Clean lines, maximum hygge

# Material World: What's Your Table Made Of?

**Choosing Materials 101:**

* **Solid Wood**: Looks great, lasts forever, costs a kidney
* **Glass**: Modern AF, but hello, fingerprint central
* **Metal**: Feels like you're living in a cool startup
* **Marble**: Fancy, but one wrong move and RIP wallet

# Size Matters (No, Really)

Table size is like dating - it's all about compatibility:

* **2-4 people**: 48-60 inch table
* **Family size**: 60-78 inch table
* **Party host mode**: 78-96 inch table

# Budget: How to Not Go Broke

Real talk - a good table is an investment. Think:

* Cost per use
* Durability
* How many Instagram stories it'll be in
* Potential ""wow"" factor

# Pro Tips That'll Save Your Dining Game

* Get an extendable table for surprise guests
* Consider ease of cleaning (white tables = nightmare)
* Think about chair compatibility
* Protect from sunlight and spills

# The Reddit Reality Check

Want to avoid a total dining table fail? Ask yourself:

* Will this actually fit my space?
* Can I afford it without eating ramen for a year?
* Does it match my vibe?
* Will my friends be impressed?

# Warning: Red Flags to Watch Out For

üö© Avoid these dining table sins:

* Super trendy tables that'll look dated in 2 years
* Impractical surfaces that stain easily
* Tables too big or small for your space
* Chairs that look good but feel like torture devices

# Final Pro Move: Where to Find Your Perfect Table

Check out:

* Local furniture stores
* Online marketplaces
* Secondhand shops (hello, hidden gems!)
* Reddit marketplace communities

# Your Turn, Reddit!

Drop a comment with:

* Your wildest dining table story
* Pics of your current setup
* Questions about finding the perfect table

I currently use a basic Singer machine to make black coffee. Using a scoop of pre ground powder of Pandoranga Wild coffee.
 Towards the end of the video the pour starts to become very watery even though I put more than enough water and the recommended amount of powder. Is that normal because the machine is very basic or can I do something to make the pour more homogeneous?",9,1733215199.0,IndiaCoffee,4,1.0,False

I moved into a small apartment and want to maximize the living room space, which is room in the apartment while still keeping it looking cozy and inviting. My roommate and I have tried a couple of different arrangements in the living room and this is the latest we came up with but I feel there's room for improvement, especially to try to make it less boring. I like the dark theme, but want to make it doesn't come off as too dark and dull. I'd also want to get a rug for under the table to add contrast between the coffee table and floor. I just put up one of the curtains, I left the other one down so I can get advice on what people think looks better (both/none/one on which side, what collor), given the limited lighting from the North-facing windows. The couch with both pieces doesn't fit against the back wall. Even though it is a big couch I don't want to get rid of it because it's amazing quality, but if needed I can potentially move the part that's not under the window to a different space in the apartment if needed. The armchair is a bright yellow color  (the one from Ikea) so for now we just threw a sheet over it until we figure out a better solution, which may just be fitting the sheet tighter onto the chair. We also want to get a book shelf, so any thoughts on what color to get would be welcome. I would appreciate any advice on how to keep it looking bigger, how to keep the darker look without making it dull and any general tips for layout etc. Thank you so much in advance.

I attached pictures of: our current layout. I included a normal picture and also a zoomed out picture (that deceptively makes the room look bigger than it is) look  to show the whole space, our old layout (the pic with the cat and the blue sheet), and the different color options of long curtains ",1,1733215030.0,HomeDecorating,0,1.0,False

I have been diagnosed with ADHD and autism at the age of 24 for the first time last week and am really struggling with medication.

I am stable on 100mg Pristiq for Depression/Anxiety which has side effects but stabilised my mental health. However, since starting Ritalin 10mg, I have been hit with incredible daytime sleepiness. To the point where I had to call out of work on my first day back. 

I know insomnia is a possible side effect but I've been sleeping 7-8 hours a night. I just feel dull and I don't go back to my Psychiatrist for a couple weeks. 

I've cut my caffeine out at home and only have coffee in the office (opposed to energy drinks) to drink reduce side effects. 

Has anyone had similar issues? ",1,1733214591.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

They get worse with coffee and some medications. They go away with benzodiazepines.

Will it ever disappear? Could they be a symptom of another underlying issue?

The only 3 symptoms I had were a pounding heartbeat but not dysrrhytmic, profusely sweating and a very mild vertigo - dizziness. All lasted for abour 3 hours. My electrolytes were all good. The only thing I know is that T waves do not look good. I always have absent P waves which is normal tho, I'm an 18 year old male. What could this ECG possibly show? They just did the ECG, got me a blood test for electrolytes and sent me home because there was a lot of emergencies. (Symtpoms lasted 1 hour after all this too, and even while at complete rest) I don't use any substances ever, alcohol, coffee, green/black tea (I refuse everything with even a bit of alcohol of caffeine), I also never take medications like oxymetazoline or xylometazoline or any pain reliever with caffeine so basically I don't take any sitmulants EVER for already a year and a half. Besides smoking cigarettes, I smoke around of 15 of them a day but last night when this ECG was taken I hadn't smoken for houra already (and I also wasn't physically active besides a little bit of walking) Considering everything, shoild I be worried, and if yes, for what?

I have no experience with plated desserts and could use some help. I need some simple, but elevated plates that can be finished off by our front of house staff, since I am not there during service. Please share ideas!

What are some basics you recommend I master? Does anyone have any back-pocket recipes that they know will always work and they don't have to think too much about?

For some context, last weekend we did a warm coffee/cardamon bread pudding with an orange cream anglais, caramel tart with mascarpone whipped cream, and a three layer sesame cake with a burnt honey cream.
