But fear not! I have a little secret that even the most charming individuals rely upon.

Simply invite them to a caf√©. These establishments are, quite literally, designed for social interaction. A serene caf√©, accompanied by soothing music, can envelop anyone in a state of tranquility, allowing them to overlook any perceived shortcomings in social finesse. And let‚Äôs not forget the delightful coffee or tea infused with caffeine, it will keep you alert, enhancing your listening abilities remarkably. Your anxiety will dissipate, enabling you to engage in conversation for hours, fostering connections at an astonishing pace. Caf√©s transform your social skills into an effortless endeavor.

The sole drawback? Well, caf√©s do come with a price tag, and there is always the chance that your invitation might be declined. However, if you‚Äôre networking with someone of a higher social echelon perhaps a preppy type or a particularly charismatic individual the odds of acceptance are decidedly in your favor.

And, of course, do remember to extend a courteous bow and graciously offer a seat, especially for a woman older than you or a gentleman of superior status when you approach a cafe with them  ",1,1733436501.0,socialskills,1,1.0,False

It‚Äôs marketed as a keto-friendly diet pill that combines several natural ingredients, including tropical nutrients, to boost **metabolism**, **reduce cravings**, and **improve energy levels**. But does Lipozem really work, or is it just another overhyped supplement? Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what this product offers, how it works, and whether it might be worth your attention.

# What is Lipozem?

Lipozem is a weight management supplement that promises to help people lose weight by addressing multiple factors that affect body fat and energy. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúmagic pill‚Äù but aims to support natural weight loss by boosting the body‚Äôs natural processes. According to the brand, Lipozem‚Äôs ingredients are carefully chosen to work together to help improve metabolic function, curb cravings, and provide a clean energy boost.

What stands out about Lipozem is that it‚Äôs made in the USA using a blend of five natural ingredients, each of which is known for its benefits in weight management or wellness. This makes it an appealing option for those looking for something simple and natural.

# How Does Lipozem Work?

The idea behind Lipozem is to enhance several key areas of health that can influence weight management:

1. **Boosting Metabolism**: By stimulating metabolic activity, Lipozem aims to help the body burn calories more effectively. The presence of BHB (Beta Hydroxybutyrate) is meant to support this process by promoting fat-burning even when you‚Äôre at rest. This could be particularly helpful if you‚Äôre trying to lose fat in stubborn areas.
2. **Reducing Appetite**: Ingredients like African Mango Extract are included to help manage hunger and cravings. By keeping your appetite in check, it may make it easier to stick to a calorie deficit, which is essential for weight loss.
3. **Improving Energy Levels**: Weight loss diets can sometimes make people feel tired or sluggish. Lipozem includes ingredients like Green Coffee Bean Extract, which may help boost energy without causing jitters. This helps users stay active and motivated, making it easier to keep up with exercise routines.
4. **Supporting Healthy Sleep**: Quality sleep is critical for weight loss since poor sleep can disrupt hormones related to hunger and stress. Lipozem also includes L-Theanine, which is known for promoting relaxation and better sleep, helping users wake up feeling refreshed and energized.
5. **Reducing Inflammation and Stress**: Ingredients like Garcinia Cambogia and Raspberry Ketones are believed to help the body cope with inflammation and stress, which can sometimes interfere with weight loss.

# Ingredients in Lipozem

Lipozem‚Äôs formula is built around five main ingredients, each known for specific benefits related to weight loss or overall wellness. Here‚Äôs a quick look at each one:

1. **Garcinia Cambogia**: A tropical fruit that‚Äôs known for its role in blocking fat production. It contains hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which may help suppress appetite and boost serotonin, potentially helping to improve mood while you‚Äôre on a diet.
2. **Green Coffee Bean Extract**: Contains chlorogenic acid, which has been linked to fat metabolism. This ingredient helps regulate blood sugar levels and may reduce the absorption of carbs, making it easier to maintain energy without as many calories.
3. **Raspberry Ketones**: Known for their ability to break down fat within cells, Raspberry Ketones support fat loss and provide a bit of an energy boost. They work by increasing levels of adiponectin, a hormone that helps regulate metabolism.
4. **African Mango Extract**: Extracted from the seeds of the African Mango, this ingredient may help control appetite and support blood sugar management, two key areas that impact weight gain and cravings.
5. **L-Theanine**: An amino acid found in tea, L-Theanine promotes relaxation without making you drowsy. It‚Äôs a unique addition to a weight loss supplement because it supports sleep and reduces stress, which can help prevent stress-related eating.

# Pros and Cons of Lipozem

# Pros

* **Natural Ingredients**: Lipozem contains plant-based ingredients, which is ideal for people who want to avoid synthetic additives.
* **Comprehensive Formula**: It doesn‚Äôt just focus on one thing like metabolism but aims to support energy, sleep, and cravings as well.
* **Money-Back Guarantee**: Lipozem offers a 180-day money-back guarantee, which provides some reassurance if you‚Äôre on the fence about trying it.

# Cons

* **Price**: For some, Lipozem might seem pricey, especially if you want to try it for several months to see the full effects.
* **Results May Vary**: Like any supplement, individual results can vary widely. Some users might see changes quickly, while others may need more time or may not experience the same level of results.
* **Not a Quick Fix**: It‚Äôs not a substitute for healthy lifestyle habits, and it‚Äôs unlikely to work miracles on its own. Using it with a balanced diet and regular exercise is still recommended.

# Who Might Benefit from Lipozem?

Lipozem is marketed toward people who are looking for a natural boost in their weight loss journey. It could be particularly useful for those who struggle with **cravings**, **low energy levels**, or **stubborn fat areas**. Since it contains ingredients that support both metabolism and appetite control, it could make a noticeable difference for people who need help sticking to their diet or maintaining energy throughout the day.

That said, if you‚Äôre dealing with specific health issues, it‚Äôs best to consult a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement.

# Does Lipozem Actually Work?

The effectiveness of Lipozem seems to come down to how it‚Äôs used and the person using it. Each of the ingredients has some science behind it, especially in the context of ketogenic or low-carb diets, where ingredients like BHB can be especially helpful. For many people, Lipozem might not result in drastic weight loss on its own, but it could make the journey easier by tackling multiple factors that play a role in weight gain.

The best results with Lipozem are likely to come when it‚Äôs used alongside healthy habits. Supplements aren‚Äôt a substitute for diet and exercise, but if you‚Äôre already working on these areas, Lipozem could provide a helpful edge.

# Is Lipozem Worth a Try?

If you‚Äôre curious about Lipozem, it might be worth considering if you like the idea of a supplement that targets more than just weight loss. It‚Äôs got components for energy, metabolism, and even stress relief, which is a pretty unique combination. Since it also offers a **180-day money-back guarantee**, it provides some peace of mind if you‚Äôre hesitant to try something new.

For those who are interested in learning more or purchasing Lipozem, you can find more details on the [**Official Website**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/2F98D3JW/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST). Just keep realistic expectations and remember that it‚Äôs not a quick-fix solution.

# Final Thoughts

Lipozem appears to be a well-rounded option for anyone looking to support their weight loss journey with natural ingredients. It tackles more than just fat burning, aiming to support areas like sleep, energy, and cravings, which are all important in maintaining a balanced lifestyle. However, it‚Äôs important to remember that individual results will vary, and supplements like this work best alongside healthy lifestyle choices.

For those who are thinking about giving it a shot, here‚Äôs a link to check it out: [**Official Website**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/2F98D3JW/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST). It‚Äôs always a good idea to do some research and consult with a healthcare provider if you‚Äôre unsure.

Ultimately, Lipozem may offer a gentle but effective boost to weight loss efforts. The decision to try it depends on your goals and whether you‚Äôre open to adding a supplement into your routine.",1,1733436370.0,HowToLoseWeightFST,0,1.0,False
1h7l9by,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychosis/comments/1h7l9by/confused_are_these_psychosis_symptoms/,Confused- are these psychosis symptoms? ,"Hi. Last night I had very strange behaivoir and I'm feeling really nervous about it so I'm posting on this forum, because I feel like I have to ask somewhere. I want to gain insight from people who have experianced pshychotic symptoms because I dont know if this ""counts"" as psychosis or if it could be something else. I havent known anyone with psychosis symptoms and I don't know a lot yet so I hope nothing I say sounds accidently insensitive, I am just trying to understand what happened to me. I have deep empathy for the pain you all must go through and I admire all your resiliance.

For some background, I'm in my mid 20s, I have ADHD and depression, and I take MyDayIs for my ADHD symptoms. I have no history of psychosis disorders, and I dont have any family history either (as far as I know. )

Yesterday i fell into some very strange thought patterns I could only describe as delusions. I don't know if it counts as a delusion since I had a level of awareness. I knew that what I was thinking sounded absurd. A tiny part of me felt like my beliefs were irrational, and even though I knew they made no sense, it was all SO believable to me. I felt about 90% certianity and 10% doubt¬† at the same time.

I will describe the experiance: I suddenly started noticing dirt on my wall. (I don't live in a very dirty house, there's just a few things like chipped paint or dust or splotches or a speck of dirt that the pets tracked in.) I started to believe that any imperfection on the wall was mold (It wasn't, but i thought it was at that moment) and I had suddenly gained the ability to see it, as it had been inivisible before. I believed that this mold had targeted me and had slowly sapped my functioning away from me in the past year (My mental health has worsened in the last year, I've felt more depressed, less energy, less motivated, ect.) I concluded my worsening state was the fault of this secret mold I couldn't see until now. I felt blessed with rare, enlightning knowledge, like being able to see the mold made me special somehow- I didn't feel like i was better than other people of course, just molecularly different in a small way. I know that sounds like sci-fi but thats just how it felt..., and I was euphoric about being able to understand.) Even though I knew it wasnt rational, It felt so real and believable to me. I spent hours wiping this ""mold"" off of the walls.¬† I knew I couldn't tell my friends or family because they would think I was crazy. So I drank a ton of coffee and stayed up all night wiping every wall in my house while my family was asleep. But I wasn't worried about my family because I felt like the mold wouldnt target them and it had chosen me specifically (maybe because It knew I was going to see it someday.)

I also had other REALLY absurd thoughts. Like I had seen the news about that one¬† Healthcare CEO guy getting shot on TV last night and I thought ""Maybe he could see something that other people couldnt see,¬† just like how I can see the mold now, and thats why they shot him. (Of course not, but this is what I thought at the time.) But I wasn't scared that ""they"" would shoot me because I'm not ultra-wealthy, I live in a small town, and i felt like my knowledge had given me some kind of invulnerability.¬† I also saw a paper towel folded in a paper airplane shape and I thought I was possibly being sent a message of encouragement to destroy the mold. I believed that mold on walls was MUCH more dangerous then mold on flat surfaces and I shouldn't care about the flat-surface mold. Even though this all sounds nonsensical I cant underexaggerate that I had really strong self awareness during this and I even googled ""delusion mental health"" while it was happening. I knew I was acting in a bizzare and irrational way while I was doing it. But everything was so believable that my doubts weren't a big deal to me at all. I didn't feel paranoid, I just felt enlightened to see things that other people couldnt,¬† like I was blessed. Anwyay I stayed up all night and wiped about every wall in my house (except for rooms where my family was sleeping or where I couldnt turn the lights on without possibly alerting them) until I was so tired i laid on the couch. Intended to lay down for only minute, but I fell asleep almost instantly.

After I woke up these delusions were no longer believable at all. I felt shocked and confused and scared upon remembering. I have no idea how this possibly happened. It honestly felt like a dream, I haven't even processed it completley yet I don't think. I dont understand how I was self-aware yet consumed by this delusional thinking. I didn't have any audio or visual hallucinations while this was happening ,as far as I know. I am currently withdrawing from Lexapro for depression and I wonder if this was a side effect. I am terrified I could be developing another mental illness. I know people who have to live with psychotic disorders are greatly misunderstood. Id like to understand¬† what could have happened here and what it could mean.¬† I am very grateful that you took the time to read this, thank you.",1,1733436353.0,Psychosis,0,1.0,False

There are so many options out there‚Äîstrips, toothpaste, gels‚Äîbut how do you know what will actually work? I‚Äôve tried plenty of products that promised a brighter smile but left me disappointed or, worse, with sensitive teeth. Then I discovered **Laughland Teeth Whitening**, and it completely changed my perspective.

Here‚Äôs everything you should know about this kit and why it worked when others didn‚Äôt.

# What Makes a Good Teeth Whitening Kit?

The best teeth whitening kit doesn‚Äôt just give temporary results‚Äîit removes deep stains without damaging your enamel or causing sensitivity. Many products rely on weak ingredients or abrasive methods that leave your teeth feeling sore and don‚Äôt give long-lasting results.

**Laughland Teeth Whitening** stands out because it uses a **dentist-formulated whitening gel** paired with an **LED mouthpiece** for professional-grade whitening at home. It‚Äôs designed to work on both surface stains and deep discoloration, giving you a brighter smile in just 6 days.

# What‚Äôs Inside the Laughland Kit?

When I received my Laughland kit, I was impressed by how complete and easy-to-use it was. The kit includes:

* **Whitening Gel Applicators**: Pre-measured for consistent results.
* **LED Mouthpiece**: Activates the gel for faster, more even whitening.
* **Adapters**: Connects to your phone or USB, making it super convenient.
* **Step-by-Step Instructions**: A simple guide to walk you through the process.

Each session only takes **10 minutes a day**, and the results build quickly. The gel is stored in a **temperature-controlled facility**, so it arrives at full potency‚Äîsomething most kits don‚Äôt offer.

# My Experience with Laughland Teeth Whitening

The process was surprisingly simple:

1. Brush and dry your teeth.
2. Apply the whitening gel evenly using the applicator.
3. Insert the LED mouthpiece, plug it in, and relax for 10 minutes.

After just a few days, I started noticing a difference. By the end of the first week, my teeth were noticeably brighter‚Äîat least 5-7 shades whiter. And the best part? **No sensitivity**. I‚Äôve always been wary of teeth whitening because of how painful it can be, but Laughland was completely pain-free.

# Why Laughland Stands Out

There are plenty of teeth whitening kits out there, but **Laughland Teeth Whitening** has a few unique features that make it worth considering:

1. **Professional-Grade Formula**: It uses hydrogen peroxide, just like a dentist‚Äôs office, but balances it with gentle ingredients to protect your enamel.
2. **Temperature-Controlled Storage**: Ensures the gel stays potent and effective when it arrives.
3. **LED Technology**: The LED mouthpiece activates the whitening gel, helping it work faster and more evenly.
4. **Gentle on Sensitive Teeth**: Designed to whiten without discomfort, making it a great choice for anyone with sensitivity.

# Who Is This Kit For?

This kit is perfect if you:

* Struggle with coffee, tea, or wine stains
* Have yellowing from smoking or aging
* Want professional-grade results without the dentist visit
* Need a gentle solution for sensitive teeth

Whether you‚Äôre prepping for a big event or just want a confidence boost, **Laughland teeth whitening** is an easy and effective way to brighten your smile.

# Final Thoughts: Is This the Best Teeth Whitening Kit?

After trying so many options, I can confidently say that **Laughland Teeth Whitening** is one of the best teeth whitening kits out there. It‚Äôs simple to use, gives real results in just a few days, and doesn‚Äôt cause sensitivity. If you‚Äôve been let down by other products, this is definitely worth trying.

4. **Metabolic Health and Weight Management**
   * Green tea, oolong tea, and hibiscus tea regulate lipid metabolism, enhance insulin sensitivity, and promote fat oxidation.
   * These effects are mediated through autophagy-related pathways such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling.
5. **Cardiovascular Health**
   * Antioxidant-rich teas like green tea and safflower tea reduce oxidative stress, improve lipid profiles, and support vascular function.
   * HYSA from safflower tea enhances blood flow and reduces thrombosis risk.
6. **Anti-Inflammatory Effects**

1h7kzby,https://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/1h7kzby/dating_rantidea/,Dating? Rant/Idea?,"Hi all, 40/m, having a hard time meeting people.

So, 10 years ago, you had to pay for a Match.com profile so you could actually meet people because nowadays 1/2 of the accounts are fake (because it‚Äôs free for the scammers).

So women I feel are scared to meet people that they meet online so it‚Äôs really hard to meet people. Only 12 people viewed my profile in a month supposedly and it‚Äôs like I have no control over that.

So here‚Äôs my idea: maybe some women would like to bring their friends and meet me so that they feel safer. I love art and comedy and do stand up. My wife was older than me and very beautiful, and I miss her very much. I‚Äôm good to all of my nephews and nieces. I‚Äôm incredibly kind and good looking and very humble /s. I‚Äôm joking, I really am humble and am tongue in cheek about being good looking.

I don‚Äôt drink or use drugs. I‚Äôd be willing to buy all of your friends a coffee and just talk, no strings attached. Whatever would help you feel comfortable to actually meet me in person, I will do, if I can. You don‚Äôt even have to give personal information until you feel comfortable.

I started a meetup.com group called Madison Single and Fun and I set an idea of getting together at Cargo Coffee on Sunday at 3pm. You can see a picture of me on the meetup when I was married.

So please if you want to have fun and just get out, we could always just be really good friends, please consider joining the meetup (it‚Äôs free) or message me privately. I won‚Äôt bite unless you‚Äôre into that sort of thing /s.",3,1733435638.0,madisonwi,5,0.71,False
1h7kz5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSweatyStartup/comments/1h7kz5j/how_to_actually_make_friends_as_an_adult_from/,How to Actually Make Friends as an Adult (From Someone Who Did It),"People brag about the weather in San Diego. The opportunity in New York City. The food scene in Houston. The outdoor adventures in Colorado. The fishing in Key West. The energy in college towns. The list goes on.

But what they don‚Äôt tell you is that the most important part of any city you choose is the community. Your friends. The people who you spend time with. Great people can make any city great. No friends at all can make any region brutal.

Making friends takes work. If you aren‚Äôt willing to do the work, you won‚Äôt make any friends in a new environment and you will be miserable.

A lot of lonely people on social media complain about not having any friends but make zero effort to do things with people.

If you sit in your house playing video games or watching Netflix, you will not make friends. If you wait for people to come up to you and invite you to do things, it won‚Äôt happen.

When we moved to Athens, Georgia, we didn‚Äôt know anybody within three hours. Not a single person.

Today, seven years later, we have an amazing community of friends we do everything with, from vacationing to playing golf to getting coffee and dinner. Our kids play together. Our community is strong!

My advice:

Bring energy to conversations and ask people about themselves. Approach people your age and strike up conversations.

Ask other grown adults for their phone numbers and invite them to do things like play golf or get dinner. Say yes when people invite you to things even if you don‚Äôt feel like going.

Read the book ‚Äú7 Habits of Highly Effective People‚Äù - a self help classic.

It works. We made friends this way, and they are a super important part of our life.

Rather than do this, I came home to ""talk"" to a fellow drunk on this Reddit.  Right now the desire to drink has left me.  I absolutely don't want to get drunk today.

I have an app on my phone called Loop Habit Tracker that does basically what I'm looking for, but haven't found anything for Wear OS. I would love to find something I can use this way on my watch.

Specifically I want an app that lets you set any generic goal and units and then track a set number of that thing per day, week, etc. allowing you to set a goal or limit.

For a goal example, let's say ""Go outside 3 times a day"" is your goal. You could track up to 3 and see a chart of your progress. 

For a limit example, let's say you want to cut down on caffeine so you only drink up to 5 cups of coffee per week, you could set that as your weekly limit and track whether you are staying under that. 

Loop habit tracker shows graphs/charts of this to show how close you are to your goal/limit and that's the kind of thing I'm hoping to find on my watch. Are there any apps that do this? Built-in or third-party?

Ideally, I want one that allows you to set different time spans for the goals like weekly or monthly, but even a daily one I'd be interested to know about.

1h7ksol,https://i.redd.it/dmzd7sroo35e1.jpeg,Help with ratios! ,"Hi, still new to cocktail making so thanks for any help! 
I ordered this a couple weeks ago and it was the greatest thing I‚Äôve had in a while! They had it pre batched then garnished with a pickle. A couple of questions: 
1) what ratios would you use for this? 
2) it tasted like a very dry vermouth. Brand suggestions?
3) when oil washing the vodka, is quality of vodka going to matter? I am planning on using a nicer single origin olive oil. 

Thanks in advance!!

He may or may not still have a girlfriend- not entirely sure whats going on there and too afraid to ask him abruptly.

1h7kpax,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeasideUniverse/comments/1h7kpax/angel_lanes_part_twentyseven_gas_station/,Angel Lanes (Part Twenty-Seven) Gas Station Interrogation ,"‚ÄúYou remember our friends we met in Las Vegas, and their smugglers we accidentally may have ripped? I‚Äôve seen this kind of thing only once a decade, and they‚Äôre the most wanted fugitives in the entire world right now. They managed to break out of the most secure prison ever made, and nearly unleashed an apocalypse along with it. We‚Äôre not the priority right now.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do you know all that?‚Äù I asked. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs complicated. But I‚Äôve been around.‚Äù

Without stopping, we drove nearly ten hours straight, passing Edmonton and heading into Northern Alberta on a straight route to Alaska. We needed another car, which was a pressing issue as I called Rosa, who arranged another switch. Meeting in an ‚Äòabandoned‚Äô chop shop in the middle of the Albertan woods, we moved all of our stuff into an indiscreet, armored minivan before our hot-wired buddy got crushed and put into a pile of junk. 

‚ÄúSo, Tim,‚Äù I said, still sitting in the backseat behind our hostage-ally as I barely kept my eyes open.

Kenji was passed out, the boy snoring while I ran on energy drinks and coffee. Even though he had fought with us, I had always been extremely wary of the shady operator types, something I had learnt from my time in the ‚Äòstan‚Äôs‚Äô. They were cunning, quiet, charismatic, and always had ‚Äòthe mental factor‚Äô that made them different from your typical grunt. Tim was no different.

‚ÄúWhy are you even working these jobs?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúYou could make the same amount doing work as a legit mercenary, back in Afghanistan or something. The market would love a guy like you.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor one,‚Äù he yawned. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt leave the continent. Also, if I showed my face again in any country south of the Mediterranean, I would get beheaded by every militant organization you can name. Working at home is better, and much less risky.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt care about being arrested?‚Äù I asked him, the grip on my pistol pointed to his back slightly weakening. 

‚ÄúArrested?‚Äù Tim laughed. ‚ÄúMy old friends basically own every single judge, politician, and cop in North America. I‚Äôm not worried about that, and besides, any record of my entire existence was wiped a long time ago. I need to be around anyways.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre living large or anything. Wouldn‚Äôt your pension and benefits set you up for life? You did work for the fucking CIA.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that, my friend.‚Äù He lit a cigarette inside the car as Angel glanced at him warily. ‚ÄúMy brother got killed when we were both on our first deployments. He stepped on a mine, and his whole fucking body got vaporized. He had two kids and his wife ran out on all of them a while ago. I‚Äôm paying for their livelihoods, they‚Äôll be going to college soon. I only need to go on several more jobs, and then I‚Äôll retire forever.‚Äù

I sighed. I was compelled to feel some kind of sympathy for him, but then again, everything he said could have been a lie designed to lower my guard. Guys like him were masters at killing their enemies with their minds and words as much as they were with a rifle and radio. 

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIf you really need the money‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll give you some of my cut if you help us all the way to Alaska.‚Äù

Tim nodded. ‚ÄúAlright. Any idea why your employers need this kid to get there anyways? Couldn‚Äôt they just have flown him there with a plane?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey weren‚Äôt divulging any details,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut they wanted us to travel by land specifically. Harder to get shot down from the sky when you‚Äôre in a car.‚Äù

The night was cold, and there was some snowfall in these parts, a sheer contrast to the boiling heat of the Nevada desert that I had become accustomed to. After nearly ten hours straight of driving, we had finally become low on gas, and I parked at the most desolate and isolated gas station I could find. 

I wasn‚Äôt going to leave Kenji in the car with Tim under any circumstances, so he stood watch from a distance, while Angel filled up the car and Kenji stayed in the locked minivan, still sleeping. I walked inside the gas station, the neon fluorescent lights humming as I quickly relieved myself, but while washing my hands, some guy bumped into me while heading for the stalls behind me.

My hands instinctively shot towards my hip for my pistol, but I relaxed myself and continued. The caffeine wasn‚Äôt helping my constantly spiraling paranoia, and I caught myself looking into the mirror to make sure the man in the stall wasn‚Äôt pointing a gun to my head through the cracks. He left the stall as I was drying my hands, before making eye contact with him. It was deliberate, prolonged, like he was staring me down or trying to get a read on me.

He was shorter than me, with slicked back brown hair, glasses, and a slender, but extremely athletic figure. Most noticeably, he was wearing a stained white dress shirt with a black tie and jeans under a bulletproof vest. 

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs keep this short,‚Äù he sighed with a smirk, before I shoved him and instantly drew my pistol, flicking the safety off and‚Ä¶

He had somehow disarmed me in under a second, holding the slide back and ejecting the magazine, the bullet in the chamber flying out and hitting the ground with a plink. There was no way he was a normal guy, or at least untrained. He was unarmed, from what I could see, but my adrenaline and the alarms in my head were going off. I ran through my options, I could scream out for Angel or Tim to rush in and kill this guy, but he could knock me out with a blow before I could even open my mouth. Or that could have been a deliberate distraction to get both combatants inside the building and occupied while someone killed or kidnapped Kenji. The risks were too high, so I complied. 

‚ÄúWho the fuck are you,‚Äù I breathed.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about that, man.‚Äù He grinned, not even mirroring a single sign of panic or tension that was evidently on my face. ‚ÄúBut you can call me Roger. I‚Äôm not here to kill you, or the three persons of interest outside this gas station. I just want to ask a few questions. Now you want to put that gun away before I punch your throat in?‚Äù

I nodded, as he let go of the barrel, and I picked the fallen magazine up before reupholstering my pistol.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Roger said. ‚ÄúI know who you are. Lane, right? Ex-marine? I have to make sure I got the right guy, you know, I wouldn‚Äôt want to be fucking with some random civillian.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúLook, if you‚Äôre just going to ask questions, can you hurry the fuck up? I‚Äôm kind of in a hurry.‚Äù

‚ÄúCalm down, man.‚Äù he feigned a defensive pose. This guy was really starting to piss me off. 

Any second, Angel would get suspicious that I was taking too long in the gas station, then hell would break loose. I needed to get this over with before that could happen. 

Roger leaned against the dirty bathroom wall without a care in the word.

‚ÄúSo, I know just a little bit about what you and your partner are up to, and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre on our radar. But, as I‚Äôm sure you know, my team has bigger fish to fry. And just to give you a heads up, I have your car, and this entire gas station surrounded by more than a hundred soldiers who will kill on my command.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood luck with that,‚Äù I gritted my teeth. ‚ÄúShe can dodge bullets.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think we don‚Äôt know?‚Äù Roger laughed hysterically before calming down and tapping his head. ‚ÄúI work with guys who can catch the bullet between their fingers and cut it into hundreds of pieces before it reaches its target. But bro, enough talk. I‚Äôm busy as is.‚Äù

Was this guy fucking serious?

‚ÄúWe looked through some camera footage we confiscated from a restaurant and found that you and your partner had a meeting with some persons of interest. And I just have to say, you guys are all pretty fucking stupid. I mean, meeting in public, with literally zero disguise or precaution? With how you guys look? It‚Äôs amateur shit.‚Äù

Looking back on hindsight, he was right about everything, as much as I didn‚Äôt want to admit it. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you know them well enough, but they go by ‚ÄòDagon‚Äô, ‚ÄòRipley‚Äô, and ‚ÄòCerberus‚Äô. I‚Äôm not going to give you a whole summary on the situation, or bitch about the details. I just need to know a few things.‚Äù 

‚ÄúGo on,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúThey gave you a package, which we assume was meant for you to deliver as a third party? Where was that to, and who did it go to?‚Äù 

I shrugged. Since they had tried ripping us off, I had no qualms about giving the smugglers up to this DOSACD agent. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm giving them up because I don‚Äôt have any obligation to protect them. So, they‚Äôre some kind of European smuggling operation with a base in the upper Missouri border‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt recall the exact spot.‚Äù

Roger pulled out his phone and showed me a picture of dead soldiers in odd black fatigues, their corpses on the ground or in trees, with ATVs and dirt bikes nearby giving away their cause of death. 

‚ÄúWere these the smugglers? Do you recognize them?‚Äù He asked. 

I shook my head. ‚ÄúNever seen them before. If you want the smuggler‚Äôs location, I can just show you. We robbed them after the deal went south, but I never opened the package or saw whatever was inside.‚Äù

I showed Roger the rough coordinates of the compound, as for the first time, he groaned in frustration.

‚ÄúFuck. That was only forty miles from the gunfight‚Ä¶‚Äù He groaned. ‚ÄúBut hey, buddy, thanks for the info.‚Äù

Just as he said that, Angel burst into the washroom, looking ready to tear the building down as she caught me right in the middle of talking with Roger.

‚ÄúOh, Angel, it‚Äôs been a while.‚Äù

However, I take 50mg of l Theanine everyday, 25mg around 4pm, and 25mg before I go to bed. While this is a laughably low amount, I genuinely do feel a difference when I take it vs when I don‚Äôt. For about 5 hours after taking, I feel ~protected~ from what could be intense anxiety. This protection might be placebo because of the low dosage, but I‚Äôm not sure I could be convinced of it.

Obviously my end goal is to live life with no anxiety-curated lifestyle changes, to live with someone without an anxiety disorder. I feel like L-Theanine is holding me back from this. I take it for an extra layer of support when I do exposures and I feel slightly unsafe when I don‚Äôt take it during my exposures. In a way, I‚Äôve attributed the lack of L Theanine in my system as the reason my first panic attack was so visceral and traumatizing. So I‚Äôm partially convinced that when I don‚Äôt take L-Theanine, I‚Äôm at risk for another life changing traumatizing panic attack. 

I‚Äôve been working on this fear however, going to libraries and coffee shops during the day without taking it, but with an additional worried thought, ‚ÄúL Theanine isn‚Äôt working in my system right now, you‚Äôre extra exposed to anxiety/panic right now!‚Äù. On top of this, I‚Äôve convinced myself that I can experience withdrawal effects from L-Theanine, that for a short time after L-Theanine has worn off, my anxiety is extra intense until I wait and level out. So in a sense, I feel like every day I‚Äôm floored from achieving a true non-anxious state, because L-Theanine withdrawals haven‚Äôt fully passed, and by 4pm, I take it again and start the cycle over.

1h7kmoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1h7kmoa/the_divine_storm/,The Divine Storm,"Alex Butler sat in the small, dimly lit living room, his gaze fixed on the screen in front of him. The weight of the world pressed down on him, a burden he would never share with anyone. He had come to Earth in secret, an alien in every sense of the word. The repercussions of discovery were far too daunting to face. But here, in this world of humans, he had found a life, a home.

His fingers brushed the fusion-powered device on the coffee table‚Äîa symbol of his wealth and his plan. A genius mind had built the first fusion battery, and in time, Alex had perfected it. These tiny, efficient power sources now powered everything. They cooked food. Powered cars. Heated homes. Even the simplest bicycles ran on the very energy he had brought to Earth.

""How do you do it?"" Sakura‚Äôs voice broke through his thoughts. She was sitting beside him on the couch, her hand resting on his. ""How can you just sit here when the world is falling apart?""

Alex didn‚Äôt move, his gaze still fixed on the device. There was a stillness to him, an almost unnatural quiet. He could feel Sakura‚Äôs eyes on him, but the question hung in the air, unanswered.

He had never known how to respond to her. The calm she saw in him wasn‚Äôt real‚Äîit was motionless resignation, an inability to act in the face of the catastrophe unfolding around them. Sakura had always been the one to push forward, her strength in moments of chaos, while he‚Ä¶ he had grown used to standing still, observing the devastation as it swept through the world. He could not fix it, and he could not explain that to her.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Alex whispered, finally lifting his gaze to meet hers. ""I wish I could fix it all.""

The words felt empty as they left his lips. Deep down, he knew he couldn't. He had always kept himself in the shadows, never imagining a time when his actions would have to matter to anyone. But now, the storm was closing in, and there was no hiding from it.

The news broadcast interrupted their quiet moment. The sound of the anchor‚Äôs frantic voice filled the room.

""We are under attack! An alien force, unlike anything we‚Äôve ever seen, has arrived. They have devastated India, struck China, and now they are advancing across the world. Our military stands no chance!""

Sakura‚Äôs breath caught in her throat. She stood up, her face pale. ""I have to get this out. The world needs to know.""

""Sakura,"" Alex said, his voice barely a whisper as he remained seated, rooted to the couch. He didn‚Äôt have the strength to get up, to move. ""You don‚Äôt have to‚Äî""

She shook her head, her voice firm. ""I have to. People need to know what‚Äôs coming. What‚Äôs already here.""

Sakura hurried to the door, grabbing her coat. Alex watched her leave, his heart heavy.

""That crazy woman!"" Alex thought. ""Crazy humans.""

But as she disappeared into the night, a thought crossed his mind‚Äîa desperate, reckless plan. It was a crazy idea, one that wouldn‚Äôt have worked on his homeworld, but maybe‚Ä¶ just maybe, it could work here. A tiny tweak to the fusion batteries, turning them into hard-light emitters. Maybe humans were just crazy enough.

He pushed himself to his feet and ran after her, his steps quick and determined.

‚ÄúThe intensity would drop off fast with range. But humans might make it work. They have to.‚Äù

He caught up to her just before she entered the building. Quickly, he started explaining. Sakura listened intently, her face a mask of focus. After a few words, she dragged him inside, shouting, ‚ÄúNew story!‚Äù

Inside, Alex was a passive observer, watching the chaos unfold as Sakura moved fluidly through the preparations for the rushed live broadcast. She kept everything running smoothly, her calm demeanor a stark contrast to his silent, motionless anxiety.

After the broadcast, his heart was heavy. There was no guarantee this would work. But for the first time, he allowed himself to move‚Äîhis mind racing with possibilities, the weight of the world finally forcing him to take a step forward.

\--

The skyline of Tokyo was a wreck. Once-glittering skyscrapers were now twisted skeletons of metal and concrete, their forms bent and broken by the relentless onslaught of the machines. Fires blazed across the city, and the air was thick with the ash of destruction. The invaders, cold and unyielding, were unstoppable.

Alex stood at the edge of a temple, its traditional wooden structure now scarred by the horrors of war. The small rock garden at its heart, once a place of peace and meditation, had been disrupted. The rocks lay scattered, out of order‚Äîsymbolizing the chaos that had consumed the world. The temple, too, seemed to mourn, its serenity torn apart by the violence around it.

Sakura, standing beside him, was as composed as ever. Once a renowned newsreader, now a vital voice in the resistance, she had been tireless in spreading the word of the weapon Alex had created. And now, despite the carnage around them, she refused to leave his side.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not from this world,‚Äù Alex said, his voice barely audible over the din of the dying city.

Sakura‚Äôs footsteps faltered as she processed his words, her gaze snapping to his. She had always known there was something different about him‚Äîthe way he seemed detached from the human world, the subtle hints in his behavior that spoke of a past far beyond anything Earth could offer. But hearing him say it out loud, in the middle of everything that was happening, hit her like a wave.

She took a deep breath, the weight of the world pressing in on her. After a moment, she spoke, her voice steady and calm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always known.‚Äù

Alex stared at her, his heart pounding, as if the ground beneath him had shifted. He had feared this moment, the moment when his secret would finally come to light, would unravel everything. But the look in Sakura‚Äôs eyes was different from what he had anticipated. There was no shock, no fear‚Äîjust acceptance.

‚ÄúIt was your secret,‚Äù she continued, her voice low. ‚ÄúAnd I respected that. I never asked.‚Äù

Alex exhaled, the tension in his body releasing like a rope slackening after a long struggle. For the first time in years, he felt the weight of his fears lift, if only a little.

The soldiers assembled, their faces weary yet resolute. They, too, had seen the horrors of war‚Äîmany of them had lost loved ones in the first wave. But now they were here, prepared to face the enemy once more, armed with the only weapon that could pierce the invaders' seemingly impenetrable armor.

Sakura stepped forward, her hard light sword now activated, the humming blade casting a ghostly glow as it flickered to life. But it was not the hilt she gripped‚Äîit was the tsuba, the guard above the hilt. The tsuba, a symbol of her heritage, anchored her to the traditions of the samurai. In the past, the guard was often a piece of intricate artistry, representing the warrior‚Äôs connection to their ancestors. Today, it was her link to that legacy, a fierce declaration of protection for her home, her people.

""For outsiders, this is the land of the katana and samurai,"" Sakura murmured, her eyes fixed on the horizon where the machines marched, oblivious to the human spirit gathering in defiance. ""To them, it's a land of duty and honor. But to us, it's our home.""

Alex exhaled, the tension in his body releasing like a rope slackening after a long struggle. For the first time in years, he felt the weight of his fears lift, if only a little.

There had been disbelief. A hard light emitter? Some had jokingly called it a ""light sabre"" or a ""Jedi sword."" But the first tests proved that it cut. Everything. What had once been an innocent invention, a simple fusion battery, could now pierce the invaders' seemingly impenetrable armor. Alex had never imagined his work would carry such weight‚Äîbut now, it was their only hope.

The soldiers were a silent sea of resolve, their faces strained but unyielding. Fear flickered in their eyes, but it did not consume them. They all knew the truth‚Äîmost would not make it out of this day alive. But none of them faltered. The charge began with a unified roar. The soldiers ran through the wreckage of Tokyo‚Äôs streets, the light from their emitters cutting through the smoke-filled sky, a fleeting beacon of hope against the overwhelming darkness. They could see the invaders now, towering and relentless, their machines reflecting the dim glow of the hard light.

The battle raged on, an unyielding storm of violence and desperation. The machines, relentless and merciless, tore through cities, decimating everything in their path. The world‚Äôs defenses had crumbled, and humanity was on the brink of annihilation.

Alex stood at the heart of the battlefield, watching as the humans fought on. They were outmatched, outgunned, and outnumbered. But they fought like lions, their fury and resolve unmatched. They drew power from deep within the land. The spiritual connection, once dulled by years of TikTok and neon advertisements flashing from towering buildings‚Äîsuddenly reformed.

The tide of bodies was unrelenting. Wave after wave crashed into the enemy lines, until they broke. Alex watched in awe as the humans fought with a strength he had never known, a strength that came from something deeper than technology, deeper than anything his kind had ever understood. They had tapped into something ancient, something powerful. And with that power, they pushed the invaders back.

Alex stood at the edge of the battlefield, his heart heavy with the knowledge of what had been lost. The cost had been high, too high. But the storm had passed. The machines were gone. The world was still standing.

Sakura and Alex became the faces of the resistance, not just for their role in delivering the weapon that turned the tide against the alien invaders, but for their actions on the battlefield. Among the many moments that defined their legacy, one scene stood out above all others.

In a brutal confrontation, Sakura unleashed a ferocious attack on a towering machine, her blade slicing through its metallic leg with a force that left onlookers in awe. The crowd that watched her battle, both live and on countless broadcasts, was transfixed by her power. But Sakura, ever humble, later claimed that the machine was already dead by the time she struck it down.

""I just let my rage take over,"" she would say. But no one believed her. To them, the scene only grew more legendary as they replayed it over and over‚Äîan unstoppable force driven by something more than just strategy or skill. It was raw, unbridled fury.

But perhaps the most iconic moment came after a frontline soldier handed her a baby, with orders to bring it to safety. At that point in the battle, Sakura had already proven her prowess on the frontlines, but the war had taken its toll. With the battle raging on, another fighter made the practical decision to take her off the field.

Sakura cradled the child without hesitation, her warrior‚Äôs instincts momentarily dulled by the innocence in her arms. Moments later, as she made her way through the battlefield, two damaged machines‚Äîstill smoking from previous attacks‚Äîtried to ambush her. The cameras caught the entire exchange.

Without flinching, Sakura turned and dispatched them with a calmness that stunned the witnesses. ‚ÄúIt was nothing,‚Äù she said afterward, brushing off the near-death encounter as if it were an inconvenience. ‚ÄúThe baby gave me luck,‚Äù she shyly joked, a faint smile on her lips.

The world, however, did not take it as a joke. It became a defining moment in her rise as a symbol of hope. Soon after, people began to call her ""Sakura ‚ÄòAngel‚Äô Nakamura,"" not just for her skill, but for the way she balanced the violence of war with the purity of her actions.

""They‚Äôre calling you an angel,"" Alex said quietly, not taking his eyes off the screen.

Sakura glanced at him, a small, self-conscious smile playing at the corners of her lips. ""Why?"" she asked.

""Because you are,"" Alex replied, his voice soft but firm.

For a moment, the noise of the broadcast faded away. It was just the two of them, caught in a brief, shared moment of warmth amidst the chaos. But then, the news continued.

‚ÄúThe tide of humanity, once scattered and unsure, is now a relentless force. The machines have no place to hide.‚Äù

Alex exhaled slowly, watching as humanity‚Äôs fury and resolve were broadcasted to the world. They weren‚Äôt just surviving anymore.

A few years later, the UNSS (United Nations Space Ship) *Vengeance* was launched. It was powered by a million tiny fusion batteries‚Äîthe same ones that had powered the hard light swords.

Alex smiled. ‚ÄúNothing holds humans back.‚Äù

Sakura answered, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how I got you.‚Äù",6,1733434725.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

1h7km0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1h7km0d/afterlife_death/,Afterlife Death,"‚ÄúThis¬†can‚Äôt be right,‚Äù I said, my eyes glued to my iMac, my coffee-lifting arm frozen midair. I was in the study, wherein I‚Äôd spent the better part of a month scrutinizing job listings, afore a desktop buried under bite-sized candy bar wrappers.

¬†

‚ÄúWhat can‚Äôt be right?‚Äù asked my wife, Beatrice, from just over my shoulder. Since my layoff, her pretty face had sprouted three new wrinkles‚Äîdeep ones‚Äîand her incessant nagging was the only thing keeping me from the couch, from watching ESPN until my eyes bled. Her job as a telecom sales rep barely covered her wardrobe requirements, after all, and our savings would only stretch so far before we lost the house.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúThis listing. No way can it be legitimate.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it say?‚Äù

¬†

I swiveled in my seat, to stare into those chestnut-colored eyes of hers. It seemed that she‚Äôd been crying. Anxiously, she finger-scrunched her black bob cut.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúIt says that the research and development division of some company‚ÄîInvestutech, I guess it‚Äôs called‚Äîwill pay $10,000 to anyone who lets the company claim their body after death.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúSo they pay you now, even though it might take you decades to die?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúIt appears so.‚Äù

¬†

Softly laughing, she shook her skeptical head. ‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs¬†*gotta be*¬†a scam. But then again, it can‚Äôt hurt to call the number.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre serious? You want me to call these guys?‚Äù¬†

¬†

Before I could blink, Beatrice had the phone in my hand.¬†¬†

¬†

\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*

¬†

Investutech‚Äôs R&D facility epitomized modern architecture: a massive cube of steel and glass, unadorned and soulless. In its lobby, I met Dr. Vern Landon, Lab Supervisor. A short, bald fellow disappearing into his own liver spots, the good doctor shook my hand as if attempting to crush a spider between our palms.

¬†

‚ÄúThanks for coming down,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI know we‚Äôre somewhat off the beaten path, but that‚Äôs how corporate prefers it.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no problem.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here about the Internet listing, I understand.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶it‚Äôs some kind of scam, right?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúQuite the opposite, my friend. At this establishment, we seek nothing less than world-shattering scientific innovation. In this pursuit, we use every tool obtainable, even the dead ones. To those of a scientific bent, a fresh corpse offers a cornucopia of potential knowledge.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúSome experiments are too risky to use a living human as a test subject, and lab monkeys don‚Äôt always cut the mustard. Perhaps you‚Äôd like an example. Well, when developing a medical device, we can insert it into a deceased man or woman to ensure that everything fits where it‚Äôs supposed to. We also harvest organs for tissue engineering projects.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúTissue engineering?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYeah, buddy. Right now, we‚Äôre learning to create artificial and bioartificial organs for patients awaiting transplants. We also use cadavers in all sorts of genetic engineering projects.‚Äù¬†¬†

¬†

Gently gripping my arm, Dr. Landon herded me down the corridor. ‚ÄúCome along now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you the grand tour.‚Äù

¬†

We passed a cafeteria, wherein a handful of sad-faced individuals in lab coats sat at Formica tables, silently consuming their lunches. As we walked, my guide began orating:

¬†

‚ÄúInvestutech is the number one innovator in a wide range of fields‚Äîfrom mainstream consumer technology to the wildest of fringe sciences. In fact, there are facilities like this spread all across the United States, answerable only to Investutech‚Äôs board of directors. At this location alone, we have laboratories dedicated not only to biomedical engineering, but also to physics, biology, and even psychology. We are engaged in many exciting projects here, which I‚Äôm unfortunately unable to speak of. Here‚Äôs the elevator. Why don‚Äôt we hop aboard?‚Äù

¬†

\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*

¬†

While I didn‚Äôt get the whole run of the facility, I saw enough to be suitably impressed. Many doors were closed to us, requiring security clearance denied to visitors. I did, however, get to see a particle accelerator, located in an extensive, circular tunnel beneath the facility. The device‚Äôs beam pipe resembled something from a sci-fi flick, as if light cycle races could take place inside it. Naturally, I requested to see the thing in action‚Äîpropelling particles at nearly the speed of light‚Äîbut the doctor assured me it wasn‚Äôt possible.

¬†

The labs I visited were practically identical: workbenches and cabinets, sinks and tables, notebooks filled with incomprehensible jottings. In some corners, I saw containers marked with radioactive waste tags.¬†

¬†

In one laboratory, I was introduced to the jubilant Dr. Hegseth. Rotund and mottled, the man handed me a pill bottle labeled¬†*6/7.9*.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù I asked.

¬†

‚ÄúHave you ever gone to the movies after getting good and smashed at the nearest bar?‚Äù¬†

¬†

‚ÄúWhy, yes, I suppose I have.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great, isn‚Äôt it? In fact, the practice has gotten me through many an evening with the missus. The only drawback is the inevitable bathroom break, during which you could be missing the movie‚Äôs best scenes.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶what‚Äôs your point?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWell, each of those pills affects your system like a six-pack of strong beer. You can get as drunk as you like and never have to pee once. Pop a pill or two and you‚Äôre ready to sit through even the most insipid romantic comedy. Best of all, you won‚Äôt be burning off your date‚Äôs eyelashes with a blast of dragon breath.‚Äù

¬†

Thinking it over, I had to admit that the innovation intrigued me.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúKeep the bottle,‚Äù Dr. Hegseth said. ‚ÄúThey hit the market next month.‚Äù

¬†

Dr. Landon led me further down the corridor. Passing a number of simulation-running supercomputers, we arrived at the psychologists‚Äô labs: austere rooms featuring one-way mirrors and hidden cameras, allowing one to observe the behavior of human test subjects. Only one room was occupied. Imagine my surprise when Dr. Landon whipped out his security card and ushered me inside it.

¬†

In one corner of the room, sitting with his knees pressing his chest, was a bearded man in a hockey jersey and soiled blue jeans. He stared without seeing, rarely blinking, spittle spilling from his mouth corners.¬†*Does he even register my presence?*¬†I wondered. For a moment, his face seemed to contort into a terror mask‚Ä¶but then his mouth slackened again, and I had to wonder if I‚Äôd imagined the expression change.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúThis is Ruben,‚Äù my guide informed me. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the last of our Nonlinears.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúNonlinears?‚Äù I asked.

¬†

‚ÄúHow can I explain this to you? Basically, our brains are filled with these cells called neurons‚Äîaround 100 billion of them, supposedly‚Äîwhich process and transmit information all day long. Each neuron is electrochemically linked to at least 20,000 other neurons, sending and receiving signals through synapse connections. If not for them, our minds wouldn‚Äôt function properly.

¬†

‚ÄúWith the Nonlinears, we did a little brain tinkering, blasting their temporal lobes with intense dopamine bombardments to unlink the neurons associated with linear time perception. We weren‚Äôt sure what would happen, but the results defied all hypotheses.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù I asked, astounded.

¬†

‚ÄúWe discovered that by unlinking these selected neurons, we altered their time perception beyond anything we could‚Äôve imagined. In fact, the tragic bastards ended up living every moment of their lives from that point onward simultaneously, all the way up to their deaths.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs amazing.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd think so, but experiencing a lifetime of sensations all at once is too much for¬†*anyone*¬†to process. That‚Äôs why Ruben doesn‚Äôt move. We feed him and clean him because he‚Äôs trying to do as little as possible, to limit his movement and sensations to a manageable level. He‚Äôll likely remain that way until he expires, the poor guy.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúSo, what happened to the rest of the Nonlinears?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúSome had immediate heart attacks, the sensation onslaught being too intense for their autonomic nervous systems. Some succumbed to brain aneurisms. The rest committed suicide in the most gruesome way imaginable, bashing their heads against the walls until their skulls caved in.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúGood lord.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúOnly Ruben had the foresight to claim a corner for his own. Who knows what‚Äôs happening in that manic brain of his? Every communication attempt has been a failure thus far, just like the experiment itself.‚Äù¬†

¬†

The doctor ushered me out. ‚ÄúWell, that about concludes the tour. I could show you the bacteriology and virology labs, but you‚Äôd have to put on a biocontaminant suit before entering, and then take a chemical shower, followed by a regular shower, before leaving. It‚Äôs not worth the effort, trust me.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúNo problem. My mind‚Äôs blown already.‚Äù¬†¬†

¬†

‚ÄúOf course it is,‚Äù he chuckled. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶have you made a decision? You‚Äôve seen what we do here. Will you sell us your corpse?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúFor ten grand, it‚Äôs a no brainer,‚Äù I replied.

¬†

‚ÄúGreat! Step into my office and we‚Äôll fill out all of the necessary paperwork. We‚Äôll cut you a check and let you get back to your life.‚Äù

¬†

\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*

¬†

Two weeks later, my wife and I were eating portabello tatin at a quaint French bistro. Sucking down Pierre Ponnelle Pinot Noir by the glassful, we contemplated a getaway cruise to the Bahamas.¬†

¬†

The check had cleared, and life was grand. No longer did we argue about money; no longer did I power through bags of miniature candy bars at my desk, searching in vain for a job that never existed. The ten grand would run out eventually, but until then I wasn‚Äôt going to let life get me down.

¬†

My wife made a joke. Laughing uproariously, I accidentally knocked over my wine. Dabbing it up with a napkin, I regretted popping a¬†*6/7.9*¬†pill before dinner, which had left me buzzed immaculate, just a stone‚Äôs throw away from drunk. I didn‚Äôt want to embarrass Beatrice, not when things were going so well.¬†

¬†

Neither of us desired dessert, so with our plates mostly emptied, I signaled for the check. Tipping the waiter a magnanimous twenty-five percent, I took my wife by the elbow and escorted her from the restaurant, into the sun-drenched day. There was a park across the street, a grass field framed with benches, containing no less than twelve picnic tables. To prolong our love‚Äôs rekindling, I suggested that we grab a bench, to watch a Hispanic family play croquet.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúThat sounds nice, dear,‚Äù Beatrice cooed, giving my hand a tender squeeze. I felt a decade younger, like it was our first date all over again, and it was going better than I‚Äôd hoped for. When the little green man appeared at the other end of the crosswalk, we strode forward leisurely, eyeing each other, not the surrounding traffic.¬†

¬†

Just as we passed the median strip, tragedy struck. At the sound of a horn blare, I glanced up to see a green Chevy Nova flying down the left-hand turn lane. Perhaps its bug-eyed driver hadn‚Äôt noticed the red light, or perhaps he didn‚Äôt care. Either way, I had just enough time to push my wife behind me, just enough time to brace for impact. With a great crumpling, I found myself ground under the vehicle‚Äôs polished metal grille.

¬†

I felt my bones grind and splinter, my liver burst. Drowning on lifeblood, I watched the world cloud over. Dying, I tried to speak Beatrice‚Äôs name, succeeding only in vomiting blood and bile onto the asphalt.¬†

¬†

Then I was gone, breeze-borne into oblivion.¬†

¬†

\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*

¬†

When next my eyes opened, I beheld neither Heaven nor Hell‚Äîno harp-strumming angels, no demons cavorting around a lake of fire. Instead, I found myself strapped to a metal table in one of Investutech‚Äôs psychology labs, with a shorthaired Asian American doctor attempting to blind me with a penlight.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs awake, Dr. Landon,‚Äù the man announced.

¬†

In the background stood my erstwhile tour guide‚Äîsmiling benevolently, sweat beads dotting his brow. ‚ÄúWelcome back, my friend,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI trust that you remember me.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWhaaa‚Ä¶haaapened?‚Äù I wheezed, my voice like a broken lawnmower. My skin was cold. I felt metal rods inside of me, where my bones had been. My outfit consisted of a hospital gown over thick layers of bandages. Even without drugs, there was no discomfort. It was like all of my pain receptors had been switched off.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no other way to tell you but to leap right in,‚Äù said Landon, struggling for a soothing tone. ‚ÄúYou were run over by a car in the middle of an intersection. You pushed your wife to safety, but lost your life in the process. In fact, your funeral started five minutes ago. They‚Äôre burying an empty coffin, however, as you signed your body over to us.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYouuu‚Ä¶brought meee baack.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWe sure did. In fact, you‚Äôve become the culmination of all our work at this facility. Most of your organs were ruined, so our tissue engineering division grew you new ones. A good portion of your skeleton was shattered, so we grafted steel bones into your physique. After that, with a strenuous application of galvanism, we actually brought the life spark back to your body. Your heart‚Äôs beating, and your neurons fire again. Now, if we can just figure out a way to stop the decay process, you‚Äôll be good as new. You may even return to your wife someday.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúAh‚Äôm decaaaying?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúUnfortunately, yes. It seems that your body doesn‚Äôt realize that it‚Äôs alive again. But our biomedical engineers are on the case, positing thermoregulation strategies even now. They should have your body generating heat again in no time.‚Äù¬†

¬†

‚ÄúWhaaas wrong wiith my voiiiice?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWell, my friend, you did crack your head pretty hard on that crosswalk. Obviously, the trauma affected your brain‚Äôs language center. Once we stop the decay, perhaps we‚Äôll look into repairing it.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWhyee am I straaapped doown?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs just a precaution. We‚Äôve never tried something like this before, and had no idea what you‚Äôd be like upon waking. Dr. Lee, free our guest from his bonds, will you?‚Äù

¬†

The doctor did as instructed, allowing me to test my reflexes. They seemed unnaturally slow, as if the connection between my mind and musculature was on a time delay. After what felt like an hour, I¬†*finally*¬†slid my legs over the table and lurched to standing.

¬†

‚ÄúSteady, steady,‚Äù Dr. Lee cautioned. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want you toppling over.‚Äù

¬†

Attempting to walk, I found my legs insensible. Indeed, I toppled forward. Fortunately, Dr. Lee was kind enough to catch me.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúI warned you about that,‚Äù he grumbled, straining to brace me up. ‚ÄúNext time, we‚Äôll‚Ä¶arggh!‚Äù

¬†

His screams were deafening. Groggily, I realized the source of his discomfort. For some reason, my body‚Äîoperating on pure instinct‚Äîhad me biting deep into Lee‚Äôs neck, gnawing frantically, my mouth filling with arterial blood. I was repulsed, yet couldn‚Äôt stop myself. A powerful appetite suffused me; it seemed it would never abate.¬†

¬†

Eventually, Lee‚Äôs screams faded. Landon tugged the corpse from my grip and I lurched in pursuit, tripping into a face plant. Losing consciousness, I heard the door slam behind them, locking me in my cell.¬†

¬†

\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*

¬†

For a while, I lurked in solitude, though I sensed observers just beyond the one-way glass. Time lost all meaning, as I no longer required sleep. Though I drank nothing, I felt no thirst, only that damnable hunger, that yearning for human flesh.¬†¬†¬†

¬†

With no entertainment options, I spent my time relearning to walk. It was more of a shamble, actually, as my knees refused to bend. Afterwards, I watched my body putrefy.¬†

¬†

First, my lower abdomen turned green. Then, in an embarrassing display, every bodily fluid, every bit of fecal matter, poured out of me. My face swelled balloonlike: mouth, lips, and tongue practically bursting. The swelling made even slurred speech impossible, garbling my every vocalization into soft moaning.¬†

¬†

My veins sprouted red tendrils, which later went green. Blisters erupted everywhere, suppurating pale, yellow fluid. Even my skin and hair began sloughing away. I won‚Äôt even mention the smell.

¬†

\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*

¬†

When Dr. Landon finally reappeared, this time flanked by two armed guards, I was in full-on undead mode. Landon offered no reaction to my appearance, but his eyes were sad. Gone was the jovial tour guide I remembered, replaced by a man who looked two decades older. Nauseous, the guards squinted at me, Glock 22s at the ready.

¬†

‚ÄúGuuuuuhhhh,‚Äù I said, the best salutation I could manage under the circumstances.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúGuh right back,‚Äù replied Landon. He hesitated for a moment, his face slackening sorrowfully. Regaining his composure, he said, ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶I have some bad news, buddy. Because you slaughtered Dr. Lee, no scientist will go near you. This means that all efforts to stop, and even reverse, your decay have been suspended. In fact, Investutech‚Äôs board of directors has proposed returning you to the grave, allowing us to study your brain postmortem. Hopefully, we‚Äôll be able to identify what prompted your blood lust and correct it before our next test subject arrives.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúNnnnnn.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but that‚Äôs the situation. The final decision has yet to arrive, but I wouldn‚Äôt get your hopes up. The next time we enter your cell, it‚Äôll most likely be to put you down. If it‚Äôs any consolation, though, your wife knows nothing of this. To her, you‚Äôve been dead¬†all this time. If Beatrice saw you now, who knows what it would do to her?‚Äù

¬†

The doctor‚Äôs practiced indifference disintegrated, as hoarse sobs burst through his quivering lips. Spilling tears, he exited the room, with both escorts trailing behind him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry!‚Äù Landon called back, just before the door closed.

¬†

Starving and depressed, I threw myself from wall to wall.¬†*I should‚Äôve eaten all three of them when I had the chance*, I reasoned.¬†*I‚Äôm already deadish. What could their guns possibly do to me?*¬†Beneath the stained, tattered mess of my hospital gown, most of my bandages had peeled away. With every wall collision, my putrid body discharged flesh chunks, which only increased my agitation. Eventually, I collapsed, howling at the top of what was left of my lungs.

¬†

\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*

¬†

Time crawled interminably. My body dried out‚Äîdarkening, acquiring a texture like cottage cheese‚Äîas its terrible death stench subsided. Internally, I visualized maggots wriggling throughout my organs, feasting on necrotic tissue.¬†

¬†

My shambling slowed, every step now a struggle. I have no idea what kept me ambulatory, kept my tormented spirit inside its moldering frame. Perhaps dark sorcery was involved.

¬†

Finally, Dr. Landon reappeared, accompanied by four guards this time, all with weapons drawn. ‚ÄúWell, my boy, the end has come,‚Äù he informed me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd have brought a priest to pray over your immortal soul, but lab security doesn‚Äôt permit faith-mongers. Once again, I‚Äôd like to apologize for your situation. Sometimes good intentions breed monsters; sometimes all you can do is cut your losses and try to learn from your mistakes. Goodbye, my friend.‚Äù

¬†

The guards opened fire, sending a bullet spray through my torso, legs and arms. Feeling no pain, I stepped forward to meet them, as fragments of my living corpse splattered the floor behind me.

¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not working!‚Äù shouted one guard‚Äîa mulleted, red-faced ginger‚Äîright before I tore his head off.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúMmmmmwwwwah,‚Äù I moaned, reveling in the blood spray, wondering where my prodigious strength came from. It almost equaled my hunger.¬†

¬†

The next guard, I ripped his gun away, along with the arm holding it. In shock, his eyes rolling back into his skull, the brawny fellow dropped to his knees.¬†

¬†

I cracked the third guard‚Äôs cranium clean open. Consuming warm blood and squishy clumps of cerebral cortex, I would‚Äôve slobbered, had my salivary glands still been operational.¬†

¬†

Dr. Landon, grasping the situation‚Äôs severity, turned on his heels and sprinted out of the room, hooking a right down the corridor. Naturally, I gave pursuit, pausing only to disembowel the fourth guard.¬†

¬†

Bloodlust lent new strength to my shamble. Resembling a mentally disabled child skipping, I positively flew down the hall. Catching up to Landon, I found him collapsed, hand to chest, gasping with an ashen face. Before the heart attack could claim him, I dashed his brains onto the floor and began to feed.¬†

¬†

With the doctor‚Äôs corpse picked clean, I grabbed his security clearance card and went back for the guards. Not that I was still hungry, mind you, but when visiting a buffet, you expect to gorge yourself.

¬†

\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*

¬†

Sirens blared overhead. Startled, I paused, clenching a dripping tendon between my teeth. They‚Äôd be coming for me, I realized, most likely in numbers I couldn‚Äôt fight through. Still, I had Landon‚Äôs key card and a memory of a fellow detainee: Ruben, the Nonlinear.

¬†

Two doors down the hall, I buzzed myself in. Ruben raised his eyes as I entered. I knew that this time he was really seeing me.

¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre finally here,‚Äù he said, unafraid.¬†

¬†

1h7kldy,https://www.reddit.com/r/joinmeatthecampfire/comments/1h7kldy/afterlife_death/,Afterlife Death,"‚ÄúThis¬†can‚Äôt be right,‚Äù I said, my eyes glued to my iMac, my coffee-lifting arm frozen midair. I was in the study, wherein I‚Äôd spent the better part of a month scrutinizing job listings, afore a desktop buried under bite-sized candy bar wrappers.

¬†

‚ÄúWhat can‚Äôt be right?‚Äù asked my wife, Beatrice, from just over my shoulder. Since my layoff, her pretty face had sprouted three new wrinkles‚Äîdeep ones‚Äîand her incessant nagging was the only thing keeping me from the couch, from watching ESPN until my eyes bled. Her job as a telecom sales rep barely covered her wardrobe requirements, after all, and our savings would only stretch so far before we lost the house.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúThis listing. No way can it be legitimate.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it say?‚Äù

¬†

I swiveled in my seat, to stare into those chestnut-colored eyes of hers. It seemed that she‚Äôd been crying. Anxiously, she finger-scrunched her black bob cut.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúIt says that the research and development division of some company‚ÄîInvestutech, I guess it‚Äôs called‚Äîwill pay $10,000 to anyone who lets the company claim their body after death.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúSo they pay you now, even though it might take you decades to die?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúIt appears so.‚Äù

¬†

Softly laughing, she shook her skeptical head. ‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs¬†*gotta be*¬†a scam. But then again, it can‚Äôt hurt to call the number.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre serious? You want me to call these guys?‚Äù¬†

¬†

Before I could blink, Beatrice had the phone in my hand.¬†¬†

¬†

\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*

¬†

Investutech‚Äôs R&D facility epitomized modern architecture: a massive cube of steel and glass, unadorned and soulless. In its lobby, I met Dr. Vern Landon, Lab Supervisor. A short, bald fellow disappearing into his own liver spots, the good doctor shook my hand as if attempting to crush a spider between our palms.

¬†

‚ÄúThanks for coming down,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI know we‚Äôre somewhat off the beaten path, but that‚Äôs how corporate prefers it.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no problem.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here about the Internet listing, I understand.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶it‚Äôs some kind of scam, right?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúQuite the opposite, my friend. At this establishment, we seek nothing less than world-shattering scientific innovation. In this pursuit, we use every tool obtainable, even the dead ones. To those of a scientific bent, a fresh corpse offers a cornucopia of potential knowledge.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúSome experiments are too risky to use a living human as a test subject, and lab monkeys don‚Äôt always cut the mustard. Perhaps you‚Äôd like an example. Well, when developing a medical device, we can insert it into a deceased man or woman to ensure that everything fits where it‚Äôs supposed to. We also harvest organs for tissue engineering projects.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúTissue engineering?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYeah, buddy. Right now, we‚Äôre learning to create artificial and bioartificial organs for patients awaiting transplants. We also use cadavers in all sorts of genetic engineering projects.‚Äù¬†¬†

¬†

Gently gripping my arm, Dr. Landon herded me down the corridor. ‚ÄúCome along now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you the grand tour.‚Äù

¬†

We passed a cafeteria, wherein a handful of sad-faced individuals in lab coats sat at Formica tables, silently consuming their lunches. As we walked, my guide began orating:

¬†

‚ÄúInvestutech is the number one innovator in a wide range of fields‚Äîfrom mainstream consumer technology to the wildest of fringe sciences. In fact, there are facilities like this spread all across the United States, answerable only to Investutech‚Äôs board of directors. At this location alone, we have laboratories dedicated not only to biomedical engineering, but also to physics, biology, and even psychology. We are engaged in many exciting projects here, which I‚Äôm unfortunately unable to speak of. Here‚Äôs the elevator. Why don‚Äôt we hop aboard?‚Äù

¬†

\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*

¬†

While I didn‚Äôt get the whole run of the facility, I saw enough to be suitably impressed. Many doors were closed to us, requiring security clearance denied to visitors. I did, however, get to see a particle accelerator, located in an extensive, circular tunnel beneath the facility. The device‚Äôs beam pipe resembled something from a sci-fi flick, as if light cycle races could take place inside it. Naturally, I requested to see the thing in action‚Äîpropelling particles at nearly the speed of light‚Äîbut the doctor assured me it wasn‚Äôt possible.

¬†

The labs I visited were practically identical: workbenches and cabinets, sinks and tables, notebooks filled with incomprehensible jottings. In some corners, I saw containers marked with radioactive waste tags.¬†

¬†

In one laboratory, I was introduced to the jubilant Dr. Hegseth. Rotund and mottled, the man handed me a pill bottle labeled¬†*6/7.9*.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù I asked.

¬†

‚ÄúHave you ever gone to the movies after getting good and smashed at the nearest bar?‚Äù¬†

¬†

‚ÄúWhy, yes, I suppose I have.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great, isn‚Äôt it? In fact, the practice has gotten me through many an evening with the missus. The only drawback is the inevitable bathroom break, during which you could be missing the movie‚Äôs best scenes.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶what‚Äôs your point?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWell, each of those pills affects your system like a six-pack of strong beer. You can get as drunk as you like and never have to pee once. Pop a pill or two and you‚Äôre ready to sit through even the most insipid romantic comedy. Best of all, you won‚Äôt be burning off your date‚Äôs eyelashes with a blast of dragon breath.‚Äù

¬†

Thinking it over, I had to admit that the innovation intrigued me.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúKeep the bottle,‚Äù Dr. Hegseth said. ‚ÄúThey hit the market next month.‚Äù

¬†

Dr. Landon led me further down the corridor. Passing a number of simulation-running supercomputers, we arrived at the psychologists‚Äô labs: austere rooms featuring one-way mirrors and hidden cameras, allowing one to observe the behavior of human test subjects. Only one room was occupied. Imagine my surprise when Dr. Landon whipped out his security card and ushered me inside it.

¬†

In one corner of the room, sitting with his knees pressing his chest, was a bearded man in a hockey jersey and soiled blue jeans. He stared without seeing, rarely blinking, spittle spilling from his mouth corners.¬†*Does he even register my presence?*¬†I wondered. For a moment, his face seemed to contort into a terror mask‚Ä¶but then his mouth slackened again, and I had to wonder if I‚Äôd imagined the expression change.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúThis is Ruben,‚Äù my guide informed me. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the last of our Nonlinears.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúNonlinears?‚Äù I asked.

¬†

‚ÄúHow can I explain this to you? Basically, our brains are filled with these cells called neurons‚Äîaround 100 billion of them, supposedly‚Äîwhich process and transmit information all day long. Each neuron is electrochemically linked to at least 20,000 other neurons, sending and receiving signals through synapse connections. If not for them, our minds wouldn‚Äôt function properly.

¬†

‚ÄúWith the Nonlinears, we did a little brain tinkering, blasting their temporal lobes with intense dopamine bombardments to unlink the neurons associated with linear time perception. We weren‚Äôt sure what would happen, but the results defied all hypotheses.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù I asked, astounded.

¬†

‚ÄúWe discovered that by unlinking these selected neurons, we altered their time perception beyond anything we could‚Äôve imagined. In fact, the tragic bastards ended up living every moment of their lives from that point onward simultaneously, all the way up to their deaths.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs amazing.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd think so, but experiencing a lifetime of sensations all at once is too much for¬†*anyone*¬†to process. That‚Äôs why Ruben doesn‚Äôt move. We feed him and clean him because he‚Äôs trying to do as little as possible, to limit his movement and sensations to a manageable level. He‚Äôll likely remain that way until he expires, the poor guy.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúSo, what happened to the rest of the Nonlinears?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúSome had immediate heart attacks, the sensation onslaught being too intense for their autonomic nervous systems. Some succumbed to brain aneurisms. The rest committed suicide in the most gruesome way imaginable, bashing their heads against the walls until their skulls caved in.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúGood lord.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúOnly Ruben had the foresight to claim a corner for his own. Who knows what‚Äôs happening in that manic brain of his? Every communication attempt has been a failure thus far, just like the experiment itself.‚Äù¬†

¬†

The doctor ushered me out. ‚ÄúWell, that about concludes the tour. I could show you the bacteriology and virology labs, but you‚Äôd have to put on a biocontaminant suit before entering, and then take a chemical shower, followed by a regular shower, before leaving. It‚Äôs not worth the effort, trust me.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúNo problem. My mind‚Äôs blown already.‚Äù¬†¬†

¬†

‚ÄúOf course it is,‚Äù he chuckled. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶have you made a decision? You‚Äôve seen what we do here. Will you sell us your corpse?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúFor ten grand, it‚Äôs a no brainer,‚Äù I replied.

¬†

‚ÄúGreat! Step into my office and we‚Äôll fill out all of the necessary paperwork. We‚Äôll cut you a check and let you get back to your life.‚Äù

¬†

\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*

¬†

Two weeks later, my wife and I were eating portabello tatin at a quaint French bistro. Sucking down Pierre Ponnelle Pinot Noir by the glassful, we contemplated a getaway cruise to the Bahamas.¬†

¬†

The check had cleared, and life was grand. No longer did we argue about money; no longer did I power through bags of miniature candy bars at my desk, searching in vain for a job that never existed. The ten grand would run out eventually, but until then I wasn‚Äôt going to let life get me down.

¬†

My wife made a joke. Laughing uproariously, I accidentally knocked over my wine. Dabbing it up with a napkin, I regretted popping a¬†*6/7.9*¬†pill before dinner, which had left me buzzed immaculate, just a stone‚Äôs throw away from drunk. I didn‚Äôt want to embarrass Beatrice, not when things were going so well.¬†

¬†

Neither of us desired dessert, so with our plates mostly emptied, I signaled for the check. Tipping the waiter a magnanimous twenty-five percent, I took my wife by the elbow and escorted her from the restaurant, into the sun-drenched day. There was a park across the street, a grass field framed with benches, containing no less than twelve picnic tables. To prolong our love‚Äôs rekindling, I suggested that we grab a bench, to watch a Hispanic family play croquet.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúThat sounds nice, dear,‚Äù Beatrice cooed, giving my hand a tender squeeze. I felt a decade younger, like it was our first date all over again, and it was going better than I‚Äôd hoped for. When the little green man appeared at the other end of the crosswalk, we strode forward leisurely, eyeing each other, not the surrounding traffic.¬†

¬†

Just as we passed the median strip, tragedy struck. At the sound of a horn blare, I glanced up to see a green Chevy Nova flying down the left-hand turn lane. Perhaps its bug-eyed driver hadn‚Äôt noticed the red light, or perhaps he didn‚Äôt care. Either way, I had just enough time to push my wife behind me, just enough time to brace for impact. With a great crumpling, I found myself ground under the vehicle‚Äôs polished metal grille.

¬†

I felt my bones grind and splinter, my liver burst. Drowning on lifeblood, I watched the world cloud over. Dying, I tried to speak Beatrice‚Äôs name, succeeding only in vomiting blood and bile onto the asphalt.¬†

¬†

Then I was gone, breeze-borne into oblivion.¬†

¬†

\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*

¬†

When next my eyes opened, I beheld neither Heaven nor Hell‚Äîno harp-strumming angels, no demons cavorting around a lake of fire. Instead, I found myself strapped to a metal table in one of Investutech‚Äôs psychology labs, with a shorthaired Asian American doctor attempting to blind me with a penlight.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs awake, Dr. Landon,‚Äù the man announced.

¬†

In the background stood my erstwhile tour guide‚Äîsmiling benevolently, sweat beads dotting his brow. ‚ÄúWelcome back, my friend,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI trust that you remember me.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWhaaa‚Ä¶haaapened?‚Äù I wheezed, my voice like a broken lawnmower. My skin was cold. I felt metal rods inside of me, where my bones had been. My outfit consisted of a hospital gown over thick layers of bandages. Even without drugs, there was no discomfort. It was like all of my pain receptors had been switched off.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no other way to tell you but to leap right in,‚Äù said Landon, struggling for a soothing tone. ‚ÄúYou were run over by a car in the middle of an intersection. You pushed your wife to safety, but lost your life in the process. In fact, your funeral started five minutes ago. They‚Äôre burying an empty coffin, however, as you signed your body over to us.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYouuu‚Ä¶brought meee baack.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWe sure did. In fact, you‚Äôve become the culmination of all our work at this facility. Most of your organs were ruined, so our tissue engineering division grew you new ones. A good portion of your skeleton was shattered, so we grafted steel bones into your physique. After that, with a strenuous application of galvanism, we actually brought the life spark back to your body. Your heart‚Äôs beating, and your neurons fire again. Now, if we can just figure out a way to stop the decay process, you‚Äôll be good as new. You may even return to your wife someday.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúAh‚Äôm decaaaying?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúUnfortunately, yes. It seems that your body doesn‚Äôt realize that it‚Äôs alive again. But our biomedical engineers are on the case, positing thermoregulation strategies even now. They should have your body generating heat again in no time.‚Äù¬†

¬†

‚ÄúWhaaas wrong wiith my voiiiice?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWell, my friend, you did crack your head pretty hard on that crosswalk. Obviously, the trauma affected your brain‚Äôs language center. Once we stop the decay, perhaps we‚Äôll look into repairing it.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWhyee am I straaapped doown?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs just a precaution. We‚Äôve never tried something like this before, and had no idea what you‚Äôd be like upon waking. Dr. Lee, free our guest from his bonds, will you?‚Äù

¬†

The doctor did as instructed, allowing me to test my reflexes. They seemed unnaturally slow, as if the connection between my mind and musculature was on a time delay. After what felt like an hour, I¬†*finally*¬†slid my legs over the table and lurched to standing.

¬†

‚ÄúSteady, steady,‚Äù Dr. Lee cautioned. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want you toppling over.‚Äù

¬†

Attempting to walk, I found my legs insensible. Indeed, I toppled forward. Fortunately, Dr. Lee was kind enough to catch me.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúI warned you about that,‚Äù he grumbled, straining to brace me up. ‚ÄúNext time, we‚Äôll‚Ä¶arggh!‚Äù

¬†

His screams were deafening. Groggily, I realized the source of his discomfort. For some reason, my body‚Äîoperating on pure instinct‚Äîhad me biting deep into Lee‚Äôs neck, gnawing frantically, my mouth filling with arterial blood. I was repulsed, yet couldn‚Äôt stop myself. A powerful appetite suffused me; it seemed it would never abate.¬†

¬†

Eventually, Lee‚Äôs screams faded. Landon tugged the corpse from my grip and I lurched in pursuit, tripping into a face plant. Losing consciousness, I heard the door slam behind them, locking me in my cell.¬†

¬†

\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*

¬†

For a while, I lurked in solitude, though I sensed observers just beyond the one-way glass. Time lost all meaning, as I no longer required sleep. Though I drank nothing, I felt no thirst, only that damnable hunger, that yearning for human flesh.¬†¬†¬†

¬†

With no entertainment options, I spent my time relearning to walk. It was more of a shamble, actually, as my knees refused to bend. Afterwards, I watched my body putrefy.¬†

¬†

First, my lower abdomen turned green. Then, in an embarrassing display, every bodily fluid, every bit of fecal matter, poured out of me. My face swelled balloonlike: mouth, lips, and tongue practically bursting. The swelling made even slurred speech impossible, garbling my every vocalization into soft moaning.¬†

¬†

My veins sprouted red tendrils, which later went green. Blisters erupted everywhere, suppurating pale, yellow fluid. Even my skin and hair began sloughing away. I won‚Äôt even mention the smell.

¬†

\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*

¬†

When Dr. Landon finally reappeared, this time flanked by two armed guards, I was in full-on undead mode. Landon offered no reaction to my appearance, but his eyes were sad. Gone was the jovial tour guide I remembered, replaced by a man who looked two decades older. Nauseous, the guards squinted at me, Glock 22s at the ready.

¬†

‚ÄúGuuuuuhhhh,‚Äù I said, the best salutation I could manage under the circumstances.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúGuh right back,‚Äù replied Landon. He hesitated for a moment, his face slackening sorrowfully. Regaining his composure, he said, ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶I have some bad news, buddy. Because you slaughtered Dr. Lee, no scientist will go near you. This means that all efforts to stop, and even reverse, your decay have been suspended. In fact, Investutech‚Äôs board of directors has proposed returning you to the grave, allowing us to study your brain postmortem. Hopefully, we‚Äôll be able to identify what prompted your blood lust and correct it before our next test subject arrives.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúNnnnnn.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but that‚Äôs the situation. The final decision has yet to arrive, but I wouldn‚Äôt get your hopes up. The next time we enter your cell, it‚Äôll most likely be to put you down. If it‚Äôs any consolation, though, your wife knows nothing of this. To her, you‚Äôve been dead¬†all this time. If Beatrice saw you now, who knows what it would do to her?‚Äù

¬†

The doctor‚Äôs practiced indifference disintegrated, as hoarse sobs burst through his quivering lips. Spilling tears, he exited the room, with both escorts trailing behind him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry!‚Äù Landon called back, just before the door closed.

¬†

Starving and depressed, I threw myself from wall to wall.¬†*I should‚Äôve eaten all three of them when I had the chance*, I reasoned.¬†*I‚Äôm already deadish. What could their guns possibly do to me?*¬†Beneath the stained, tattered mess of my hospital gown, most of my bandages had peeled away. With every wall collision, my putrid body discharged flesh chunks, which only increased my agitation. Eventually, I collapsed, howling at the top of what was left of my lungs.

¬†

\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*

¬†

Time crawled interminably. My body dried out‚Äîdarkening, acquiring a texture like cottage cheese‚Äîas its terrible death stench subsided. Internally, I visualized maggots wriggling throughout my organs, feasting on necrotic tissue.¬†

¬†

My shambling slowed, every step now a struggle. I have no idea what kept me ambulatory, kept my tormented spirit inside its moldering frame. Perhaps dark sorcery was involved.

¬†

Finally, Dr. Landon reappeared, accompanied by four guards this time, all with weapons drawn. ‚ÄúWell, my boy, the end has come,‚Äù he informed me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd have brought a priest to pray over your immortal soul, but lab security doesn‚Äôt permit faith-mongers. Once again, I‚Äôd like to apologize for your situation. Sometimes good intentions breed monsters; sometimes all you can do is cut your losses and try to learn from your mistakes. Goodbye, my friend.‚Äù

¬†

The guards opened fire, sending a bullet spray through my torso, legs and arms. Feeling no pain, I stepped forward to meet them, as fragments of my living corpse splattered the floor behind me.

¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not working!‚Äù shouted one guard‚Äîa mulleted, red-faced ginger‚Äîright before I tore his head off.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúMmmmmwwwwah,‚Äù I moaned, reveling in the blood spray, wondering where my prodigious strength came from. It almost equaled my hunger.¬†

¬†

The next guard, I ripped his gun away, along with the arm holding it. In shock, his eyes rolling back into his skull, the brawny fellow dropped to his knees.¬†

¬†

I cracked the third guard‚Äôs cranium clean open. Consuming warm blood and squishy clumps of cerebral cortex, I would‚Äôve slobbered, had my salivary glands still been operational.¬†

¬†

Dr. Landon, grasping the situation‚Äôs severity, turned on his heels and sprinted out of the room, hooking a right down the corridor. Naturally, I gave pursuit, pausing only to disembowel the fourth guard.¬†

¬†

Bloodlust lent new strength to my shamble. Resembling a mentally disabled child skipping, I positively flew down the hall. Catching up to Landon, I found him collapsed, hand to chest, gasping with an ashen face. Before the heart attack could claim him, I dashed his brains onto the floor and began to feed.¬†

¬†

With the doctor‚Äôs corpse picked clean, I grabbed his security clearance card and went back for the guards. Not that I was still hungry, mind you, but when visiting a buffet, you expect to gorge yourself.

¬†

\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\*

¬†

Sirens blared overhead. Startled, I paused, clenching a dripping tendon between my teeth. They‚Äôd be coming for me, I realized, most likely in numbers I couldn‚Äôt fight through. Still, I had Landon‚Äôs key card and a memory of a fellow detainee: Ruben, the Nonlinear.

¬†

Two doors down the hall, I buzzed myself in. Ruben raised his eyes as I entered. I knew that this time he was really seeing me.

¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre finally here,‚Äù he said, unafraid.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúYnnnnnn,‚Äù I confirmed, closing the intervening distance.¬†

¬†

My chin slick with the blood of my captors, I leaned over the Nonlinear. As my teeth met his flesh, he had just enough time to thank me.

1h7kg3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Efficient-Camel-1241/comments/1h7kg3z/assorted_shit_interactions_ive_had_recently/,Assorted shit interactions I've had recently ,"I was just going to edit my last post here with these, but there's way too much ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

A week ago, I burnt myself on the new coffee machines we have at work (they haven't had time to kind of chill out a bit with use so when you burn yourself on these things- you BURN), and a customer started getting angry when I had to take a bit to wrap it up in a cold press to try get the burn out. This asshole must have been waiting for all of 30 seconds while I did this. He literally heard me yell in pain. I get to the register and he just rolls his eyes and goes ""finally."" Like how the hell do you hear someone yell in pain and still lack that much empathy you're pissed off you didn't get served before they treated their goddamn injury?

2 days ago, there was a technical issue with one of the monitors, and we had to wait for our manager to come down and fix it. We had the actual till with money in that one that was down (as we only have one rather than 2 for each monitor). It had been down for maybe 15 minutes, and I serve this guy who comes up and orders, tries to pay with cash. 

""Sorry sir, but we can't accept cash right now as we're having technical issues and I can't access change to give you, do you have card you can pay with so you're not waiting for this to be fixed?"" ""Are you fucking kidding me? You do realise that it's illegal to not accept cash right?"" (Which is not true for the record, not in Australia at leastü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), we then make a show of trying to get the till open even with the monitor down for like 2 minutes, before it turns out that THIS ASSHAT HAD A CARD HE COULD HAVE USED THE WHOLE FUCKING TIME. It would have taken less time to make your goddamn milkshake if you'd just stopped being a complete Darren and harassing us for no fucking reason 

Then, just yesterday, I had this lady come up and buy a drink from me. Through the whole interaction she was rude as hell, but I kept it together while she scowled and complained at the fact that we didn't have coke zero we could sell her like it was my damn fault the drink shipment hadn't come in yet. She ended up just getting a normal coke, it being $5.20. She handed me a 10 dollar note for it, saying she had a 20 cent piece to give me so I could just give her a 5 back rather than a handful of change. I put the 10 in the till, waited for her to hand me the 20 cents, then handed her back her change. 

She then starts accusing me of short-changing her, saying she gave me 50. I say that did not happen, because it just fucking didn't? I pull out the 10 dollar note that she gave me to SHOW her, and she just keeps glaring at me and saying she needed more. I'm starting to get annoyed as hell at this point, but I'm STILL not openly rude, I just say ""this is the 10 you gave me, I'm not trying to short-change you here ma'am. You just didn't give me 50"". She says ""yes I did"" and storms off. I'm stressed out by this point, so I go to the bathroom to try re-regulate a bit so I don't completely lose my shit at the next customer who's potentially rude to me. 

As I go around the corner, a lady from the information desk has come up and is staring at me like I've done something horifically wrong as I leave for a minute to the bathroom, then when I come back I'm told by a coworker that she needs to take down details for the lady I served because this fuckwit has gone and complained to the information desk saying she wanted my manager because I took her money. I was apparently also 'incredibly rude' to her as well üôÑ

This comment is what really made me make my last post, because it's so fucking exhausting dealing with so much bullshit and then having people have the GALL to fucking call you rude when you aren't performing like they think you should when you're narrowly keeping from yelling and/or crying because you are tired of dealing with this shit

I really hope that the tolerable interactions pick up more soon, because I'm so over it at this point man. I'm going to start uni next year and do shit I actually want to do because if I'm stuck in this job for more then a year (which I'll need to be if I want to get somewhere better because they all want minimum 3 years of experience and FUCK that), I will go crazy. I'm excited to have something with better prospects then this nonsense. I still need the money if I want to life fully independently, but hopefully by the time I start Uni I will have saved enough up at least",1,1733434265.0,u_Efficient-Camel-1241,0,0.99,False

I have been learning how to do espresso for some time now, and have learned quite a lot, but one thing I think is limiting my routine is this very old, kinda no-name grinder my girlfriend has.
Model is Graef CM800 I believe.

While it is not a baad grinder, I wanted to get something more modern, a.k.a. single dosing, flat burr grinder.

My budget tops out around 1500 euros, so please please please tell me what you think a good grinder up to this price would be? Hint: it doesn't have to hit the price ceiling if it's a great bang for buck grinder, though I'd ideally like the 700ish+ section and not really into the super budget options.

My preference is usually medium, medium dark and dark roasts. 90% of the time it goes as a cappuccino, but more like a machiatone (which is basically a cappuccino with a lot less milk, to keep the coffee somewhat punchy). Mostly going for that Italian flavor profile, but of course would like to leave some options and try out the other spectrum if possible (changing burrs? etc..).

What I could narrow down myself, was the Mazzer Philos. Another I might have considered is the Varia VS6 (though might not be ideal due to no auger, somewhat questionable quality, settings being easily disturbed). But I just don't know if I'm missing some other great options.

What I care for in a grinder:

- a lot of fine adjustments in grind settings

- good build quality

- able to slow-feed it (proper auger's a plus)

- low retention

- easy to maintain

What I dont care for in a grinder:

- variable RPM

- lots of power (dark roasts mainly)

- ionizer (I use RDT anyway)

Hopefully I didn't bore you by now :) and HUGE THANKS to anyone who might have some ideas for me.",4,1733433862.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

1h7k8up,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFIB/comments/1h7k8up/afib/,Afib,"I have recently been diagnosed with Afib, though no one seems to know the cause (if one exists). So let me give some context, I'm 31. I work out 3 times a week with 30 minutes of cardio weekly. I am a casual drinker (at most, one 6 pack on a weekend, maybe 1 beer on a week day). I don't smoke tobacco, but maybe smoke 1-2 bowls of weed daily. I used to have 1 V8 energy drink and then an 8 ounce cup of coffee a while later in the morning, and on Fridays, I would have a Redbull at night also. I suppose I have my fair share of general anxiety, but I have the least stressful job I have ever had and don't really have any other major stressors. I've had panic attacks in the past, but none major within the last 3 years since switching to my current job.

Okay, with all that said about 3 months ago, I had my first episode in the middle of the night around 1. Chest pains and tigntness in the center of my chest woke me from my sleep, along with being very dizzy to the point of almost fainting. I felt like I had to cough to relieve the tightness and pain. My wife took me to the hospital because these symptoms were not easing up and were unlike anything I had ever experienced. I was in Afib for about 4 hours, and during this time my heart rate was fluctuating from low 60s to sometimes in the 150s. They gave me diltiazem, which seemed to help get my heart rate back into a normal bpm range and eventually my heart went back into normal sinus rhythm. They ran tests, drew blood, and did imaging, but they said everything was normal and never really found a cause. The ER Dr put me on diltiazem for 6 weeks, and I was on it until I went to see my family‚Äôs preferred cardiologist. In the meantime, I stopped drinking alcohol completely, stopped drinking caffeine, cut smoking to 1 bowl/day, etc. The diltiazem made me feel very sluggish, taking my resting heart rate as low as 40 bpm at times. I only had one small episode while taking diltiazem, but it was after taking a few small sips of coffee. I didn't have a way to record it at the time, but I have since gotten a watch and a Kardia EKG monitor. 


When I saw my cardiologist, he took me off of diltiazem and wanted to see what would happen with small restrictions to beer and caffeine. He said no more than 3 beers a day, only 2 small cups of coffee per day, and no energy drinks. He gave me his number and said to call him if anything happened. He also said if I have an episode, try to sit down and rest or take a nap. He said I shouldn't go to the ER unless I pass out or have severe chest pains. It‚Äôs been a month since then, and I have been well within my restrictions. I had only had 1 small episode, which I recorded on my watch and Kardia monitor. There was no pain associated with it, and I didn‚Äôt pass out - I was able to stay calm and let it pass.

BUT last night around 8, I had 1 weird chest feeling accompanied by some pain. I decided to get up and get my Kardia EKG monitor to see if I was having an Afib episode. I wanted to sit at the dinner table to get an accurate reading on my EKG monitor, because sometimes if I‚Äôm not sitting up straight and sitting still it says it can‚Äôt get an accurate reading. As I got up to get everything together, I felt very dizzy. I moved to the table to quickly sit down. In a matter of seconds, I fainted, fell to the floor, hit my cheek bone/head on the floor and was out for 10-20 seconds completely unresponsive. My wife called 911, and an ambulance arrived 10 minutes later. They helped me walk outside, and they put me on the gurney. They loaded me up, put an IV in and were about to take off, but my heart rate was jumping all over the place. I was going in and out of awareness until I fainted again for about 10 seconds. The EMT said my heart rate dropped to 37 bpm. I remained in Afib for 3 hours while in the hospital. They ran tests again while I was in Afib, but still seemed confused because besides the Afib itself, everything else seemed to be normal. I was eventually given metoprolol, and about 45 minutes later my heart went back into normal sinus rhythm and I was allowed to go home shortly after. 

It's the day after as I‚Äôm typing this, and my head is killing me and my chest feels sore. I have already contacted my cardiologist and am awaiting his instructions. Though I can't help but wonder what caused the episode, if anything. Yesterday, I ate normally, only had 8oz of coffee in the morning, didn‚Äôt workout, and drank plenty of water throughout the day. Last night, I only had 1/2 a bowl of weed, sipped on 1 shot of whiskey over an hours time, felt no stress or anxiety, etc. To me, it seems strange to start having these episodes randomly with no direct cause.

Pros:
- physically attracted to him
- lots of things in common 
- he‚Äôs intelligent / intelligent conversation 
- he‚Äôs funny
- very kind words about me that were lovely to hear someone recognise (non superficial) 
- can talk for hours and hours and not feel bored 
- we align on a lot of core values 


Question marks;
- his mum was calling him at one point on the date to check in with him about how it was going, he frequently spoke about her also 
- a few undertones that his family are from a more privileged background than I and he made a few passing comments about where I am from and that I ‚Äúneeded to get out of there‚Äù ‚Äúmust have been hard around here‚Äù 
- quite blunt 
- brought up the fact he had to travel ‚Äúall this way‚Äù to be here, pay for parking and he would have expected me to have picked a better place he could eat (we had to go somewhere else as I thought it was just going to be coffee rather than a meal so my bad) 
- we share travel as a shared interest, he said he was well travelled which he is and when my experiences were similar he was kind of dismissive off-hand and was like oh but I‚Äôve travelled way more and actually spent real time out there and been back loads of times- was a bit random and felt like he was trying to one up me 
- said some random off hand comments about how where he‚Äôs from people need to speak plainly and honestly and that might be different for where I‚Äôve come from, some weird negative comments aswell about his dad 
- I did bring up some of the comments above and said it sounded a bit condescending but he apologised a lot, then said he didn‚Äôt mean it that way, and later on said he wonders if I‚Äôm perceiving it like that from ‚Äúpast experiences‚Äù 
- he kept saying I was misinterpreting his humour - e.g I said something about not wanting to get something on my dress as it‚Äôs my best new dress and he goes oh THATS your best dress? ..then was like ha ha joke 

Nothing in isolation felt hugely terrible - I did have a good time - but all of it together I was a bit like hmmm I don‚Äôt know how to feel.

I started dating my girlfriend (19 years) about two months ago. We meet in college, in a group project. Never expected that but hahah, anyway let's call her S.

I share apartment with my girl best friend (also 20 years old, let's call her N) and two other male friends. N is my best friends since childhood: our moms were friends, and we grew up together. She is like a sister to me, she helped me about some heavy stuff at home, school, and more things, just as I did to her. I love her as family, and even if she gets angry easily she's a kind person generally.

S and N get along great, or so I thought. N spends some nights out and doesn't sleep in her room, so she let S use her room whenever she's out and S comes to the apartment. N also likes to cook, and sometimes prepares lunch for me and the other two guys. When I started dating S, N also made food for her to take home. And they sometimes go to coffee together, so I was really happy the most important women on my life were connecting. We hang up a couple of times, and N and I use to go to the library and drinking together alongside our other friends some days a week (depending on our schedules and such).

 Yesterday, N approached me and asked me about talk about something important, so we went to smoke in the balcony. She told me some things have been missing from her room, and that she's sure that she didn't misplaced them, so she asked me to ask S about it. She seemed kinda nervous asking that. At first I was slightly pissed off that she considered my girlfriend stealing, but I told her that no problem, that I'll ask S.

When I asked my girlfriend I expected her to deny it since I didn't think she could do such a thing. I was wrong. S told me she just grabbed some lipglosses and make up she liked and forgot to return them, and when I said to her to actually return the things, she made a grimace and changed the topic. She returned the items after I forced her to, but it rubbed me in the wrong. 

We got into a heated argument during this conversation, where she yelled at me she didn't want me to be friends with N and I should cut N off, because we were too close and N was probably trying to get on my pants which really angered me. She said me defending N proved her point, and then I told her ""of course I care more about N. We've been friends since childhood, and she supported me my entire life. She has been kind to you, and you repaid her by stealing her things and calling her a home wrecker"". I don't let anyone disrespect my friends at all. After that she gave me all the make up she borrowed and I went to my apartment. S is not responding texts, and we aren't currently speaking. It's just been a day, but it makes me nervous.

I defended N because I strongly believe she didn't deserve my gf (or anyone else) burrowing her make up or other personal things without consulting it to her.

 N noticed I was slightly depressed and I  told her everything, and she now feels guilty about this argument and apologised to me. She said we are a good couple and I should really try to speak to S and mend things, and N also told me she understood if we stopped hanging out together as much as we used to now.

The thing is, I love my girlfriend and this situation hurts me deeply. But as long as I love my girlfriend, I can't just turn my back to N, that wouldn't be fair. I'm thinking about my relationship because I don't know if I can be with someone who doesn't respect my friends, specially N. Or if I even love S as much as to cut N off, as S requested during the argument.

Just to make clear: I never loved, I don't love and I won't love N in a romantic way as S suggested during our argument. I don't know, I just can't see her that way. 

I feel terrible for saying I cared more about N that her, and I even feel even more bad because it's true. I mean, I just have known my girlfriend for 6 months (2 months dating), and N 20 years.... So I think I wasn't in the wrong, as much as it sounded badly.

Well, I explained this to one of my other male close friends and he told me it was horrible to say I cared about S less that another woman.

I just feel really confused, and I wanted to know if aitah for saying I cared less about S than N? 

Advice would be great, and other perspectives. I'm a total mess right now, and I didn't leave my room since 3 pm.",0,1733433367.0,AITAH,3,0.5,False

Treatlerism is, as far as I understand, the idea that activism and care ends when inconvenience starts. That Americans in particular don't care who gets hurt as long as the treats keep flowing. As long as we get plastic doodads and coffee and chocolate, those third world children being mutilated brutally can go fuck themselves. 

Idk if i have it quite right because I cannot find any actual resources on this, but it seems a very fitting term for consumer culture and how consumers lack empathy.",7,1733433173.0,Anticonsumption,5,0.82,False

1h7jyyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1h7jyyz/my_dog_is_not_ready_for_the_rainbow_road_and_its/,My dog is not ready for the rainbow road and it's completely disrupting my home life,"Yesterday I got home with my kids around 3:40pm. We stopped at the store to pick up a few packs of Publix M&M cookies for a class party at my son's school the next morning. My son often has friends come over around this time, so when the doorbell rang, I thought nothing of it. When I heard a grown man's voice from the next room, I stepped out of the kitchen to see who it was, kind of worried about an adult being at the door when my kid answered it. It was our next door neighbor wanting to ask me something about a tree on the property line. We chatted for a minute, said our niceties, and bid goodbye. 

When I went back to the kitchen, my 15 year old dog had snagged the Publix bag off the table, ripped into the cookies, and ate them. 13 cookies in one pack and was scarfing 3 of them from the second pack. 

Just that fast. And then we dealt with pet poison control for the chocolate, a sick dog that ended up being okay, puke that ruined our new day bed, diarrhea all over the yard, and more puke that we kept cleaning as it came.

And that's the life we live with her. Every day. All day long. 

In my dog's elderly years, she has developed OCD, tremendous anxiety, and really poor behaviors that wreck our daily lives. We're constantly overstimulated, constantly overwhelmed, and constantly dealing with her actions. 

She wasn't always like this. She used to be the kind of dog that you could leave food out on a coffee table and she wouldn't eat it. People would compliment her when seeing us out on walks. She was a pleasant dog for guests to meet. Never had a problem with her in the slightest. 

But a few years ago, she started experiencing cognitive decline. It started with her being unable to sleep at night. It took 6 months, but we got it under control with trazadone. 

From there, and potentially from the trazadone, she started becoming obsessed with stealing food. People often have a hard time understanding what I mean by obsessed. Like she's just poorly behaved and being sneaky? No I mean incessantly getting in the way whenever there is food out. It doesn't even matter if food is out. She paws at and scratches the pantry door because she knows food is in there. 

If we're cooking, she's jumping up on the island to try to get what we're preparing. If we're eating, she jumps on the table or our laps to take food. She barely registers it when we tell her ""no"" or try to redirect her. To keep her from literally trying to steal food off of our plate while we eat, we put her in the office next to our dining room. She will bark incessantly while we eat. 

To help with the barking, we will give her a treat ball. But it only occupies her for a few minutes. If we make the treat ball too difficult, she'll get anxiety. And when she gets anxiety, she pees. 

Like walking around whining and barking while pee is spraying out of her, getting on her fur, and getting on the floor. 

She's also obsessed with toilets. She feels the need to lick toilets. And it's a weird behavior. She licks the toilet with her tail wagging lightning fast. Maybe we should clean our toilets? We do. She still licks them. I also have an 11-year-old son, and he has preteen aged friends and the toilet isn't always going to be perfectly clean. 

So shut the bathroom door, right? Close her out, right? Well, there's now deep scratches into the door because she paws at the door trying to get in. If she gets stuck there freaking out about the door, she'll end up peeing if we don't redirect her. 

We give her a lot of treat balls. It's treat balls all day long, but they're easy treat balls. She has no interest in going for walks anymore. She just drags behind, pulling us back at a slow, slow pace. Then when we turn around, she sled dogs it back to the house. 

Because she's old and in pain? 

Maybe but the vet says she's in great health. At her annual checkup around six months ago, the vet was so impressed that a 15 year old German Shepherd was as active and mobile and sturdy as she was that she called the other vet in the office to come see. 

They said, ""Wow we need to know your secret. We've never seen a German Shepherd with hips like hers at this age!"" 

And all I can think is no...no she can't be perfectly healthy. She can't be fine. She needs to be winding down. She needs to be getting close.

I've had dogs my entire life. They are family to me. To just put her down is like putting down anyone else in the family. I need it to be ethical and valid and reasonable. I cannot do it out of inconvenience. 

Last night my son was in tears because he was worried about the dog. He knows that chocolate is toxic for dogs, and after watching her throw up, he was really worried she was going to die. 

So how could I decide to put her down and look my son in the face? 

But I don't know what else to do. We've tried more trazadone and giving it to her in the morning in addition to her nightly dose. It just made her loopy and ""drunk."" She would lose her footing and stumble and fall over. It was sad. 

We tried klonopin. It made her depressed and uncoordinated. She was struggling to keep food in her mouth because it kept falling out.

We tried gabapentin and she developed these weird seizure-like tremors. 

We tried Prozac but you can't mix trazadone and Prozac. She stopped sleeping and lost her appetite altogether. So we stopped Prozac before we could tell if it would work and spent over a week losing sleep while we waited for it to leave her system to go back on trazadone.  

At night when you want to relax, you can't. She runs back and forth around the house. She chews on her food container. She goes to the kitchen to jump on the counter to look for food to snag. She tries to get into the pantry. She goes to the bathroom door. And back. And forth. Over. And over. And you can't focus on a TV show or have a conversation or do anything without the incessant running around, the galloping sound of her trying to look for something to get into. 

She has no desire for affection anymore. 

It's just nonstop obnoxious behaviors until she gets her nighttime trazadone and then passes out for the night. 

She's also mostly deaf. 

Anyways, I just need to get this off my chest because I feel guilty, conflicted, anxious, frustrated, and confused. This has been going on for years. She first stopped sleeping when she was 12 and a half. Now she's 15 and we're just constantly dealing with these behaviors. 

I'm not sure what else to do. It's not fair to her to live like this either. But I don't feel like a good parent not figuring it out for her. Especially if her physical body is doing so well.",1,1733433100.0,TrueOffMyChest,4,0.6,False

This old Europiccola sat in my Mom's basement for almost 50 years before I restored & upgraded it. Slowly, I've been putting together a setup that scratches my itch for process while also delivering some absolutely stellar espresso. Having been a barista in a couple artsy-fartsy coffee shops using really nice equipment and fantastic beans, it is really nice taking a tiny little low-budget setup like this and pulling (in my opinion) better shots at home.   
Yes, I know about the DF54 and I should probably have a pressure gauge and a better temp gauge on the Europiccola, but I have yet to hit the limits of this setup and I am not sad about that at all. Neither is my wallet. 

Anyway, thank you for looking. I love this old machine so dang much!

1h7jm2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1h7jm2p/i_feel_alone_in_my_marriage_any_advice/,I feel alone in my marriage. Any advice?,"Me [36F] and my husband [35M] have been married for 7 years. We have 2 kids under 5, own a beautiful house and we both have a fulltime job in IT.

We used to be happy but it seems the birth of our second child last year is taking a toll on our marriage.

Long story short; before 2023 we were each others best friends, nr 1 supporters of each others personal goals, enjoyed achieving our goals as a couple and had a very balanced life (family time/ social time/ alone time was very well balanced). 

In 2023 we bought our first home and settled in just before I gave birth to our second child. In 2024 we struggled a lot finding our ‚Äúnew‚Äù routine as a family of 4 and I even struggled mentally for a short period, being close to post partum depression. Both our moms used to babysit 1 day per week, but around summer both had to quit due to health constraints. We rely on daycare most of the week and I‚Äôm off on Friday. The kids have been sick multiple periods this year, weeks after another and couldn‚Äôt go to school or daycare. So we were stuck at home with each other for weeks in a row, with no sleep (sick baby) and for multiple periods. My husband has had 3 periods where he was close to exhaustion. And I no longer enjoy weekends. We have been on a date 2 times this year and haven‚Äôt really got any time to spend together without kids. We tried finding a nanny, neighbor or someone who could babysit but without any luck.

We now barely communicate, do our daily routine and that‚Äôs it. I really miss our social life, but whenever I mention a birthday or lunch with our friends he sighs and gets a headache of the idea alone. I never invite people over because he is always tired and not really a nice vibe to be around. We used to have fun with family dinners but those are no longer fun too. Last night my parents in law came over for dinner and he gaslighted me in front of them over something silly (I made them coffee, he didn‚Äôt notice and he made them coffee too. Waste of coffee he said..) and he made a big deal out of it. The entire mood was ruined and he‚Äôs ignoring me now. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt have energy to talk or discuss anything, so we‚Äôll talk next week‚Äù. I feel embarrassed because we used to be a team and never ever gaslighted each other, let alone in front of family. To be honest, I have a temper at times towards him as well, less patience than before and sometimes don‚Äôt feel like talking to him either. It goes both ways of course, but I‚Äôll never openly show this around family. 

Actually I feel so alone and don‚Äôt really know what to do. 

Is our marriage dying? Are we drifting apart? Anyone who experienced something similar, what would you advise? 

TL;DR after 7 yrs of marriage I feel disconnected from my husband and don‚Äôt know how to navigate through our imbalanced home routines and absence of balanced personal/work/social/alone time. Any advice is more than welcome!

1h7jm0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1h7jm0b/crippling_anxietyinsecurity_caused_by_my_parents/,Crippling anxiety/insecurity caused by my parents,"Hello, I‚Äôm 25M. I don‚Äôt really know if I‚Äôm right about anything I‚Äôm about to say. And I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm right but just being overly dramatic about it. So I‚Äôm going to type out the feelings I‚Äôm having and if you decide to read through and have any insight or advice I‚Äôd really appreciate it.

So I am thankfully starting to get over a lot of my anxiety and insecurities thanks to my fiance always being so loving, understanding, and supportive. But I‚Äôm weighing whether or not I should confront my parents, and more specifically my father about these things via letter or if I should just let it go and move on.

When I was young I had all the confidence in the world. I had no problem walking up to any adult and starting a conversation as a child. One day as if over night it seemed like I‚Äôd turned into a completely different person. Now all kids have anxiety about something or another when they‚Äôre young but my anxiety has become so strong over the years that it has almost taken my life on multiple occasions and had I never met my spouse I believe it would‚Äôve taken my life by now.

My ADHD is probably the biggest contributor to my anxiety. Now I‚Äôm sure hundreds of interactions with hundreds of different people all added to my anxiety but as far as people go, my parents have played the biggest role in my growing anxiety. And to be fair, I genuinely doubt they could even understand how their actions have affected me growing up. 

Know that ADHD affects everyone differently but it is not as simple as ‚ÄúOh someone with ADHD just has trouble paying attention sometimes.‚Äù ADHD affects my memory and my emotions. It amplifies any and all emotions I have by what feels like 10 times. If I‚Äôm sad, I want to die. If I‚Äôm mad, I want to kill. When people tell me their name I often will have to ask again at some point because I have zero short term memory. Unless information brought to me is interesting to me or traumatic to me then that information will leave my mind within five minutes. Because of that I have struggled in school and in work on a scale most people cannot even imagine and yet I‚Äôve been told my whole life I just need to study harder or work harder. Thankfully I‚Äôm on ADHD medicine now and it has changed my life completely for the better. 

I‚Äôve been compared to my sister my entire life. Whether my parents will admit it or not, I have been. My sister is a decent person and has not done anything too terrible to me. She abused me when I was very young but I believe that‚Äôs just an older sibling/older sister thing. She was diagnosed with ADHD in the 2000s and I can 100% guarantee you if she saw a psychiatrist today she‚Äôd be rediagnosed with OCD and autism instead. She‚Äôs always done perfect in school and in life, hasn‚Äôt made any mistakes and has had no major hurtles in life. The biggest problem she‚Äôs ever faced was her high school boyfriend of a few weeks cheating on her. She has been  constantly praised by our parent our entire lives and I have been constantly criticized. She lived at home bills free and got her bachelors and masters like it was nothing. I Moved out at 19, flunked out of college twice and worked hard physical labor blue collar jobs until now. She had mom and dad and our step father help her pay for her first vehicle which didn‚Äôt have any problems whatsoever for the entire time she owned it and I bought and went through 6 shit boxes on my own by the time I was 23. She met the love of her life her very first week of college and I spent 4 years alone in my apartment being rejected or just straight up ghosted by almost every woman I‚Äôve ever asked out until I met my spouse. She‚Äôs received so much love and praise from our parents. My father and my mother have separately told me they were proud of me just one single time. My dad once when I got accepted at to a university and my mom once when she saw me pick up a bottle for an old lady that dropped it.

My father has at least once every six months since I stopped going to college told me I need to go back. He told me my whole life he wouldn‚Äôt care what I did in life as long as I graduated high school but I guess he meant to say college all those times because he can‚Äôt seem to let it go. Not to mention this man took 7 years, almost 200k in student loans that he still hasn‚Äôt paid off just to get an art degree which in the early 2000s was apparently enough to get you a job in a federal courthouse that pine pays him almost $90k a year. And I think he genuinely believes you can do the same thing now in 2024.

I‚Äôve probably gone to his house to help him with some chore of his almost every week of my adult life. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I have no problem helping my parent out at all. But this man regularly calls me over to his house to do things like take out his trash or take out the cats litter, or hangout with him while he does something that requires no extra help. He‚Äôll often call me over there to ‚Äúhang out‚Äù and we‚Äôll hang for a bit and then comes the real reason he needed me which is always that his back is hurting and he wants to ask if I can walk his bag of trash the 50 feet from his kitchen to the outside garbage. And this man is only 53. He‚Äôs not old enough and does not have the health problems to need help taking out the trash. And yet I always come through for him, probably just seeking his approval whereas my sister only comes to see him on holidays and yet even still she is treated better than me and respected more than me. When my sister got married he immediately started bombarding her asking when she plans to have children. The very first time I told my father I planned to propose to my girlfriend and showed him the ring he scolded me for spending more than $500 on the ring. No congratulations. No I‚Äôm so happy for you. Just criticism for spending some money on the person I love most in this world. I mean the dude practically had an orgasm when my sisters husband told him he was going to propose. 

And more so about the constant needing me to help him. I‚Äôm 25 with a fianc√© and my own life. I have my own home, my own job, my own responsibilities. I don‚Äôt have the time to drive 20 minutes just to come take out your trash. And if anything I‚Äôm worried for the man because I‚Äôm not going to live in my home state my whole life. A time will come soon that I won‚Äôt be able to see him at all for months at a time. And if it‚Äôs true that he really does need me help for such little tasks then what am I to do? No one other than me would take care of him when the time comes but I‚Äôm not prepared to be taking care of my dad before I‚Äôm even 30.

When I got my first job that paid more than minimum wage he scolded me and was furious with me because his brother who he hates worked there. When I quit that job and got another job that paid more with more hours he asked me how that job was any different from my last since it was still no college degree needed physical labor. When I broke my leg at that job and had to wear a boot he didn‚Äôt decrease the amount of physical favors he asked of me in the slightest. In fact him and my mother both acted as if I hadn‚Äôt broken my leg at all let alone broken it from being over worked. Matter of fact my father actually told me it was probably mostly due to my weight. 

My weight is a huge factor in my anxiety. I‚Äôve been bullied and ridiculed for my weight my whole life. What really pisses me off though is that when I go back and look at pictures of my younger self I wasn‚Äôt even fat. I barely even had a beer belly. All those years I was made to believe I was morbidly obese and now unfortunately I am 350lbs and it‚Äôs pretty fucking hard to lose weight once you‚Äôre at a certain weight. He‚Äôs always given me crap about my weight as if I was feeding myself. I didn‚Äôt have a job until I was 17 and therefore couldn‚Äôt buy my own fucking food until I was 17 so even if I was fat back then which I wasn‚Äôt, it wouldn‚Äôt have been my fault anyway. Now I have my him still bringing up my weight constantly and telling me what he does to keep the weight off when he clearly has some sort of high metabolism. And also, his ‚Äúadvice‚Äù of doing what he does which is not eating breakfast or lunch everyday while simultaneously drinking a half gallon of coffee a day will kill someone just as fast as being overweight. Both him and my stepmom eat almost worse than I do. I know they do with how many times I‚Äôve gone to pick them up fast food because they were too lazy to do it themselves and I was too affection starved to say no. I know it‚Äôs always coming from a place of love and wanting to see your son healthy but every time he brings it up it just makes it harder for me to lose it. 

I have bad sleep apnea too. Bad enough that when I finally saw a doctor for it, I was told that with the hours and the job I was working that it had probably already taken 5 years off of my life. I‚Äôm sure my weight has made it worse but his brother has it and my mom has it so it runs in the family and sleep apnea also literally makes it harder for the body to loose weight even if you‚Äôre starving yourself. 

And my biggest insecurity of all. I‚Äôm being honest here. I have a small penis. And for anyone reading who has been insecure about their size please know that I‚Äôve been with 5 women total which may not be much but it has never once been an issue for me or for them. But anyway. It‚Äôs already the butt of so many jokes in movies and shows but my whole life my father has loved to brag about how well endowed he is. Imagine how much a young boy who‚Äôs insecure about his size becomes after constantly hearing about how fucking big his dad‚Äôs is. So many years of wasted time opportunities I missed all because I was so insecure about something that ultimately doesn‚Äôt matter that much. Also, now he has never done anything like this before I was over the age of 18 but the man tries to tell me his past sexual escapades as if I‚Äôm his best friend. I don‚Äôt want to hear about my dad‚Äôs past sex life at all. I especially don‚Äôt wanna hear about stuff like the first time he slept with my stepmother. Like wtf.

And to top all of it off, he leaves me feeling insane. He‚Äôs not a terrible father. He doesn‚Äôt abuse me. He‚Äôd help me financially if I was in a bind. He demands I give him a birthday and Christmas list every year even though I‚Äôm 25 now. He obviously cares about me and does a lot for me. But even still, my dad is very judgmental. The only things that can be cool are things that are cool to him essentially. I remember like 2 years ago I had asked for a certain movie for Christmas and he straight up told me he wouldn‚Äôt get it cause it was lame even though he‚Äôs never even seen the movie. And I feel like dude I‚Äôm a grown man, I don‚Äôt need any Christmas presents from anyone so if you‚Äôre going to ask me what I want and I tell you something then either get it or don‚Äôt ask me at all. 

I don‚Äôt even know what to think half the time. Is he being manipulative? Is he just delusional? Am I? I want to write him a letter expressing all these feelings but I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to talk about all of this in person with him without either him turning it around on me or me just getting so emotional I cannot compose myself. I know I should‚Äôve voiced these opinions to him as they came but my anxiety has kept me from expressing myself and now I have all these emotions I‚Äôve held in ready to burst out. I cannot keep living like this and I‚Äôm just trying to find the best way to go about stopping his behavior towards me.

So sorry for this insanely long post. If you‚Äôve read this far, thank you!!!

1h7jgyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1h7jgyb/theres_hope_still/,There's hope still! ,"After 4 months of serious job searching (and an occasional application here or there for about 3 months before that), I'm happy to share that I finally got offers! 

I mostly want to share this because of all the disillusionment and hopelessness going around about the current job market, which undoubtedly IS tough, but it's not completely hopeless. I also went about my job search in a way that contradicted many of the tips that I commonly got throughout the process, and I want to encourage others to do what feels right to them.

https://preview.redd.it/4bnieq2gd35e1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=37f82c717cc0e48de67a692cb1eb0504e9bdca70

What I did:

* I did some informational interviewing and networking, which I focused on for the first 2 months of my job search. After that, I admit I kind of burnt out. I got two job interviews from referrals, one of which converted into a full-time offer. I also had two referrals that did not result in a job interview. 
* I figured out what kind of jobs I really wanted to do and which level was attainable for me. This ties in with talking to people who come from similar educational backgrounds to gauge what I was reasonably qualified for, as I am a recent PhD graduate and thus simultaneously under- and overqualified for many positions. 
* I customized my CV to every application, however, since I basically narrowed down my search to two different jobs, customization rarely took me more than 30min. I applied to a total of 7 positons requesting a cover letter and I wrote these without AI based on the job description and company website. I typically spent about 1h on a cover letter. 
* I had job alerts for my target industry and target positions set up on LinkedIn and Indeed and I don't think I applied to any job that was listed for more than 1 week. 

* I did pay for LinkedIn premium for a couple of months. The only function I found really useful was ""Mark as Top Job"", which I used for jobs I thought were a great match for me. This got me 2 interviews and converted to 1 full-time and one contractor offer. 

What I didn't do:

* I didn't ""spray and pray"", applying to a wide range of different jobs. I also did not try to enforce a target number of jobs to apply to each day/week (I think my maximum was 3 applications in one week). 
* I didn't spend a pre-defined amount of time every week on applications. Between my job alerts and occasional searches on Linkedin in my downtime, I would only save jobs that I thought were really interesting and realistic for me and try to get down to 
* I didn't apply to jobs that I didn't fit close to all ""required"" criteria and I very rarely applied to jobs that asked for years of specific experience I don't have. In the current market as a recent grad, I did not think this made a lot of sense in my situation.
* I didn't approach people I had no direct ties with on Linkedin. I relied on my existing network (people I'd worked with or met in person during events) to introduce me to people in their network. I also did not send invites to strangers or accept those I received. 
* I didn't ask people I barely knew to refer me. Instead, I focused on making real connections during in-person informational interviews, mostly over coffee, during which I tried to be very open about what I was looking for. All my referrals came from people who, sometimes months after meeting them, would contact me with an opening at their company that I could be interested in and offered to refer me without me asking them. 

 Caveats:

As a long-term grad student, I am used to getting paid below the poverty line and with no dependents, my expenses were very low to begin with. I also live with a partner who has a regular, albeit fluctuating income, and we are in an MCOL area. So while my job search was mentally tough and I didn't have money to spare for non-necessities, I was never in danger of losing housing or not being able to afford basic food. None of the offers I got are perfect and all of them are towards the lower end of my salary expectations, but in this market, and especially with no ""real"" work experience, I'm not complaining. 

I know everyone's journey is different, but sometimes following your gut instead of all the well-meaning advice works just as well if the latter doesn't resonate with you. ",1,1733431849.0,jobs,0,1.0,False

1h7jfuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h7jfuc/i_shouldnt_have_looked_into_his_mind/,I shouldn't have looked into his mind.,"I wasn‚Äôt always like this. A year ago, I was just another teenager trying to survive high school. Sure, I had a secret‚Äîa strange ability I couldn‚Äôt explain‚Äîbut I kept it buried deep. I didn‚Äôt use it unless I had to.

My mom always said I was ""too sensitive,"" that I could ""read people."" She didn‚Äôt know how right she was. I could really read them. Their thoughts, their fears, their memories‚Äîthey were all there, like books I could flip through if I focused hard enough. I didn‚Äôt ask for it. I didn‚Äôt want it. But I had it, and I learned the hard way that some books are better left unopened.

For years, I practiced control. I‚Äôd only dip into someone‚Äôs thoughts when I felt threatened, like the time a boy in my math class started following me home. I saw what he was planning before he could act, and I took a different route that day. Small things like that kept me safe and that gave me some comfort.

But then, I met him.

It was a Tuesday, and I was at the park near my house. I liked to sit on the swings and pretend I was normal, just another kid enjoying the breeze and the sunlight. That‚Äôs when I saw him. He was sitting on a bench near the playground, sipping coffee from a paper cup.

At first, he looked harmless‚Äîjust another guy killing time. But something about him didn‚Äôt sit right. He wasn‚Äôt watching the joggers or the pigeons. He was watching the children. His gaze lingered too long, his fingers tapping an erratic rhythm on his cup.

I told myself not to do it. Not to look. I could feel the itch in the back of my mind, the way his thoughts brushed against mine like static electricity. But I knew better. Reading minds is a lot like opening doors: once you go in, you don‚Äôt always like what you find.

Still, I couldn‚Äôt stop myself. It was like an instinct, a compulsion. I reached out gently, just to skim the surface.

And then I fell.

His mind wasn‚Äôt like the others I‚Äôd read. It was dark, tangled, chaotic. Images slammed into me like waves: a blood-streaked floor, a child‚Äôs shoe lying abandoned, a locked basement door. I heard faint screams, felt the damp chill of a concrete room. And I saw her‚Äîa little girl, maybe six, with blond curls and wide, terrified eyes. He was planning to take her. He‚Äôd already chosen her. Her name was Stephanie.

I yanked myself out of his thoughts, my chest heaving, my head spinning. That‚Äôs when he turned. His eyes, hidden behind dark sunglasses, locked onto mine. He smiled. Not the friendly kind of smile, but the kind that sent chills crawling down my spine.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have done that,‚Äù he said softly. His voice carried across the playground, low and deliberate.

I froze, my legs trembling as I tried to look away. But I couldn‚Äôt. His gaze pinned me there, like a predator sizing up his prey.

I stumbled off the swing and ran. I didn‚Äôt stop until I was home, locking every door, closing every curtain. My mind was racing. I wanted to tell someone, anyone, but what could I say? ‚ÄúHi, I think this guy I met at the park is a killer. Oh, and I know this because I can read minds.‚Äù Yeah, that would go over well.

For a while, I thought I was safe. Days passed without any sign of him. But I recieved a note on my windowsill, written in neat, slanted handwriting: Stay out of my head.

Now, every time I close my eyes, I feel him there, just on the edge of my thoughts. He‚Äôs not just watching me. He‚Äôs inside me, clawing at my mind, unraveling me from the inside out.

I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can hold on. But one thing‚Äôs for sure: I should never have looked.",3,1733431768.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

‚ÄúSo, run this through again.‚Äù Sam asked, walking to the hangar now derisively known as the Hekatian Quarter. It's occupants, thus far, had done little more than train, exercise, and some odd jobs around the base. That was likely to change, in light of the ambush the other day.

‚ÄúAlright. This hangar is, officially, leased to the United Nations Command. They maintain the right to use it in certain ways without consulting the base commanders, although the US can of course object, in which case the UN has to back down.‚Äù Danny replied, taking the lead of the small party of three. Lt Skinner was the last member, still adjusting his beret to match the others.

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd the United Nations, in turn, leased this to the Commonwealth, so their guys can operate on their own laws whilst on the base.""

‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs legally Commonwealth territory?‚Äù Sam asked, trying to be sure.

‚Äú*Allegedly*. Personally, I think that sounds like a crock of shit, and it's still American, but that doesn't matter so long as everyone agrees to pretend that its true. Anything done is legally in the clear until the Americans complain, and would you believe, they all conveniently have their fingers in their ears.‚Äù 

The trio were getting close to the hangar, a ugly blocky building surrounded by a chain link fence topped with barbed wire. It all had the appearance of a prison, though it was mostly about keeping people *out*. A small gatehouse was the only entrance this side, manned by a British and Hekatian soldier that lounged about inside. At the approach of the trio, both straightened up, and saluted.

‚ÄúSir. Do you all have your IDs?‚Äù The Human asked, as the salute was returned. His counterpart stood silently, dressed in a tunic dyed UN blue, rather than the iconic heavy battle armour.

‚ÄúYep.‚Äù Danny pulled out a small ID card, Sam and Dave presenting the same. The man took it, examining them, while also scanning them with a small device. There was a slight beep, and he nodded.

‚ÄúGood to go, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you. Busy day?‚Äù

‚ÄúVery busy, sir.‚Äù 

The gate was raised, the pair stepping through into the fenced perimeter. Hekatians were performing physical training, doing work on vehicles, or just idling around. A few were playing some sort of card game equivalent in the shade, which Sam was somewhat curious about. During the war, he'd never much thought to ask Tergelyx about the cultural things Hekatians did on their home planets, but admittedly, there had been other things on his mind. Maybe he'd ask around.

‚ÄúWhat state is the guy in?‚Äù Sam asked, referring to the target of their visit. A prisoner that had beeen captured in an ambush a few days ago, one that had left Corporal Baccup still in a hospital bed on base, and killed a local EOD contractor.

‚ÄúImproved. They‚Äôve had to amputate an arm, and they reckon he‚Äôs likely to struggle with walking again. Nerve damage. Probably will have to get a prosthetic, but I suspect the Commonwealth doesn‚Äôt feel like shelling out for him.‚Äù Danny replied, carrying on towards a side door into the hangar. More security greeted them inside, Hekatians in full battle armour and clutching proper plasma rifles.

‚ÄúProbably not.‚Äù 

The ritual of security checks repeated again, though this time it took far longer. Both Sam and Danny were patted down, confirming they only carried a self-defence pistol into the building. Then they were given the nod, and allowed to descend into a basement.

‚ÄúThis pre-war, or-‚Äú Sam asked, looking around. There were many fresh-looking internal walls. The basement had been designated as the holding area for any Hekatian remnants captured in the vicinity, which until now had been rather slim. 

‚ÄúPre, same as the hangar. They built all of this post-Contact, this basement was meant to store shit. Course, when the invasion happened, this base fell largely without a fight, so it was intact when the war ended. Rumour has it the first troops in after the end of the war found the Hekatians had used this hangar as a prison, but I don't know if that's true or not.""

‚ÄúGreat, I‚Äôm glad this is where we chose to do interrogations.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo am I.‚Äù Danny replied. ‚ÄúLike I said. Legal grey area. At least, it is as far as the Americans care. Alternative is flying him to Ascension, and then it's not exactly like we get to quiz him.‚Äù

""Isn't he flying there anyway?"" Dave spoke up before Sam got a chance to ask.

""Eventually, once he's fit to travel."" 

The pair entered a small room, a rather professional-looking hospital room, albeit a little cramped. A Hekatian prisonr lay unconscious in bed, his limbs cuffed, as he was attended to by a pair of Hekatain doctors. Neither of them paid attention to the entrance of new Humans, continuing to examine their patient. But that wasn‚Äôt the thing that most grabbed Sam‚Äôs attention. No, that was Corporal Patanjali, standing in the room. Judging by Danny‚Äôs reaction, he wasn‚Äôt the only one surprised.

‚ÄúThe fuck are *you* doing here?‚Äù Danny asked. Dave also performed a double take.

‚ÄúSir, I was asked to attend the interrogation on behalf of our forces. I thought you were aware.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy the hell would they ask you? Who asked you to?‚Äù Dave followed up.

‚ÄúBattalion commander, sir. I‚Äôm very sorry, I thought he would have passed word to you.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt answer the Lt‚Äôs question, Corporal.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have a portable translator, Sergeant. It's not great, not as good as the ones the Hekatians have plugged in, but it's good enough to understand. Command wanted me to piggyback the interrogation in case there was anything the Hekatians withheld.‚Äù

""Really?""

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true, Sir."" Patanjali flashed the device, a small compact one that fit into the palm of his hand, connected to a pair of dangling earphones plugged in. ""Personal use. Command knows I have it, they just wanted me to record verify the official transcript.""

‚ÄúDid they withhold anything?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing of note with the prisoner.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen evidently there was no point you being here. I‚Äôll assume they recorded it too, and will give it to us, *and* their recording will be a lot better quality.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up with him now?‚Äù Sam asked, trying to change the topic in a productive direction, as he nodded towards the still unconscious prisoner. ‚ÄúWent to bed after they finished?‚Äù

‚ÄúPut under. They tried interviewing him prior to some of the surgery, thought he might be more cooperative. He wasn't.""

‚ÄúJesus.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe made a lot of references to the Hekatian equivalent in the process.‚Äù Sam swore he could detect a smirk on Patanjali‚Äôs face as he said that.

‚ÄúWhat did he say?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing immediately actionable, he was put under for a leg amputation before they got to asking about that stuff. Mostly info on who he was and what he was doing out in the woods. Real interesting shit.‚Äù

""Like?""

""Some big shit there, I'll tell you that.""

""Get to the point."" Sam snapped.

‚ÄúSergeant, this guy isn‚Äôt a remnant. His buddies are, but he isn‚Äôt military. He‚Äôs from the fucking Reconstruction Authority. Some son of a Noble House, one of the ones that we already got around to stripping of their shit, picked up the RA job fixing broken buildings and shit. Then he somehow bailed without anyone noticing, then he found the remnants and joined them. He‚Äôs not some holdout squatting in the woods for years, he‚Äôs *worse*, he‚Äôs an active traitor. The guy doing the interrogation really lost his shit there, I don't know much about him but I think he's a dyed in the wool anti-Imperium rebel. Finding out the guy you're talking to is a noble and a traitor, I mean shit. It's like if Stalin stumbled across a missing prince during the Great Purge.""

""Yeah, shit. That's not good."" Danny muttered, though Sam couldn't quite see the full issue.

""Frankly, based on what he said to the prisoner, I think he was about to go Russian style, but the doctors objected rather firmly. That was one bit they didn't include in the official translation, I can tell you that.""

""So all the info we got is he was a idiot construction worker that decided to run around in the hills? No info on how he managed to find them, when we can‚Äôt? No info on enemy strength, equipment, area of operations?""

‚ÄúSarge, I think you‚Äôre missing the implications of that piece of information. I agree, I would have liked more information, but we'll probably get the rest when he's awake. But that is rather significant.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow so?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt suggests the reconstruction program, whose entire goddamn point was to show that the Imperium was gone and the Commonwealth represented Hekatians, has a bunch of Hekatians in it that much preferred the Imperium.‚Äù

*Oh*.

‚ÄúIf word on that got out, it could cause riots overnight."" Dave said, shaking his head. ""People will lose their shit if they find out that the people repairing all the damage from the war think that the problem with the war was *they* didn't win. And I‚Äôd be willing to bet that he found his way to the remnants because he wasn‚Äôt the only one that felt that way.‚Äù

Sam sighed, putting his head in his hands.

‚ÄúGreat. Just great. You know, when I objected to them putting Hekatian troops here, I didn‚Äôt think-‚Äú Sam began, before being cut off by Danny.

‚ÄúCorrect, Sam, you didn‚Äôt think. *This* debacle has nothing to do with the deployment of troops. This debacle is the result of the bit *everyone* thinks is a good idea, having Hekatians rebuild the damage.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine. But you realise, if this gets out, it's gonna ignite a firestorm about those troops.‚Äù

Danny shrugged, happy to concede that.

‚ÄúIf we can get back on track.‚Äù Dave cleared his throat.

""Yes."" Danny muttered. ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a clear course of action we have to take. Namely, that no one here breathes a *word* to anyone about this. Word *cannot* get out about this guy being RA. I assume you‚Äôre set to brief battalion command about this, Corporal?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, with you present sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine. Then we make it crystal clear this brief is only going to the battalion commander, no one else. Maximum secrecy. They can make their decisions on who to brief, but I don‚Äôt want a leak of info to be on *my* conscience.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat I think we can all agree on.‚Äù Sam replied.

‚ÄúI also agree, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn the meantime, I want this Hekatian back in interrogation the moment he is awake, *and* to give me information I can use to get the bastards that put one of my Corporals in a hospital. Frankly, if that means we have to do the interrogation ourselves, then we will.‚Äù

‚ÄúAye.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, Corporal, I want you to compile any notes you have and get ready to brief command. Sergeant, I believe the guy‚Äôs weapon was passed to the armoury for examination, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYep.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Go find Witchell later, and ask him what he found, if he‚Äôs not busy kicking Rainer to death or something. Lt, if you wouldn't mind running around to find whoever's running shit with the Hekatians, and making clear just how little word needs to get out until a verdict comes down from on high?""

""Got it.""

‚ÄúRight, I will be off, since I now have one hell of a meeting to prepare for."" Danny said, quickly setting off. Sam followed, as Corporal Patanjali began fiddling with his phone, and Dave went to chat with the medics.

As they began to climb the stairs, Danny spoke again. ‚ÄúWell, that went worse than I thought.‚Äù

‚ÄúAgreed.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one question I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs going to answer for me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the hell kind of *coincidence* is it that we ended up with a extra Corporal, that we simply couldn‚Äôt get rid of due to a apparently bureaucratic error, and then that Corporal turns out to be able to understand Halxian at a complex level?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what are the chances that said Corporal is getting special orders from our commanders to monitor important shit like this?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù Danny stopped, looking around the base. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it when Command takes an interest in us. It never ends well.‚Äù

---

There was a lot of gunfire echoing through the Community Activity Centre, mixed with shouting and the occasional scream of pain. But that was unsurprising, it was movie night after all.

‚ÄúOhhh!‚Äù The roar, half excitement, half shock at a particularly visceral kill, came from about a dozen of the assembled soldiers, though there were at least 50 assembled in the seats. Sam looked over them briefly, but couldn‚Äôt find the man he was looking for. And he didn‚Äôt want to interrupt whatever it was to ask.

He wandered around the rest of the common area. There were sofas packed densely amongst pool tables, though a large quantity of said sofas had been pilfered for the movie corner. The tradition, a joint American-UN one, had been a rousing success, though it was perhaps helped by the fact the building also had a bar.

There were some present in the building just sitting and chatting in corners, some sleeping. Of particular note, Corporal Goose sat alone, currently pouring over the contents of a box.

‚ÄúEvening, sergeant.‚Äù The man behind the bar, a gruff American, nodded after recognising the rank slide on Sam‚Äôs uniform. ‚ÄúAnything?‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, looking for someone. Maybe later.‚Äù Sam carried on walking, deciding to try Goose instead. He wandered over, Goos still oblivious to his approach.

‚ÄúEvening Corporal.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, aye Sarge.‚Äù Goose jumped in his seat, causing the box he had been rifling through to rattle.

‚ÄúWhat you got in there?‚Äù

‚ÄúPackage from home.‚Äù

‚ÄúMean like, what‚Äôs *in* it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. Uhh‚Ä¶‚Äù Corporal Goose pulled a guilty face, as if he‚Äôd been caught with something he shouldn‚Äôt have. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs uhh, well‚Ä¶ you know tabletop games?‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶ Corporal, is this your way of telling me you got your girlfriend to ship your warhammer collection over?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes Sarge.‚Äù

‚ÄúFair enough I suppose. Is this just for display, or-‚Äú

‚ÄúNo, me, Etty, and Turner from 2 Section all have stuff for games. They mostly play against the Yanks, or other companies, but now I can actually join in. We run them all here, just waiting for the rest to show.‚Äù

‚ÄúNever would have pegged Etty as one for tabletop. What‚Äôs he play?‚Äù

‚ÄúOrks.‚Äù Considering his driving style at times, that probably made sense. Goose paused for a moment. ‚ÄúSays it reminds him of a game he used to play growing up. Have you‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúInheriting an under-appreciated World War 2 model collection from my dad. You‚Äôd be saddened how many unpainted T-34s he has.‚Äù

‚ÄúShame.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you, then?‚Äù Goose didn‚Äôt seem to catch on at first, so Sam clarified. ‚ÄúWho you play?‚Äù

‚ÄúTau, Sarge.‚Äù The guilty expression returned. ‚ÄúTurner bullies me for it.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood for her. Don‚Äôt suppose you‚Äôve seen Witchell, the armourer, around?‚Äù Sam would have gone looking earlier, but he had decided to check in on Corporal Baccup. The man was mostly fine, but taking the opportunity to rest a bit, as was the rest of the unit, given they had been pulled from duty. Soon he would be out and about again, and they could get back to work.

‚ÄúUhhh‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt think so?‚Äù Goose paused for a moment, reaching in and pulling out a highly painted model of a mech as he thought. ‚ÄúWait, no! Saw ‚Äòem about 10 minutes ago, he was heading towards the office buildings. That uhhh‚Ä¶ anger management thing.‚Äù

That explained quite why Sam had so much trouble finding the company armourer. The poor man had practically been driven insane by various unreasonable requests being directed at him, finally culminating in a dramatic outburst after Lt Rainer had attempted to force him to ‚Äúrepair‚Äù a automatic grenade launcher that had somehow been badly mistreated to the point it caught fire and pieces began to melt. Sam *still* didn‚Äôt know what had happened there, and he didn‚Äôt much blame the armourer for calling the Lt multiple words that were not fit to repeat. 

Unsurprisingly, Rainer had taken it very poorly. Also unsurprisingly, nearly everyone had agreed that Witchell *had* overstepped, but also that they didn‚Äôt particularly want to punish him. So he was sent to anger management instead, which Sam understood to practically be more of a support group for victims of military incompetence.

‚ÄúDamnit. Thanks for the tip.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo trouble Sarge. You‚Äôre welcome to come watch next time we‚Äôre doing something!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see about that.‚Äù

Speaking of the devil, as Sam made his way to the exit, he saw his least favourite Lt had entered the recreational area. Rainer took a look at the movie playing, and immediately began to loudly commentate.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dead. She‚Äôs dead. He‚Äôs dead. He‚Äôs dead.‚Äù Rainer said, pointing at specific actors in the scene.

‚ÄúPiss off, Lt, we‚Äôre trying to watch the movie.‚Äù Dani replied, not taking her eyes off the screen. There were murmours of support from the gathered viewers.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just saying.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd we don‚Äôt care.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs also dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo he isn‚Äôt!‚Äù An American yelled back.

‚ÄúYes, he is!‚Äù

‚ÄúTom Cruise is not dead. Stop saying that he‚Äôs dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe is!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, he‚Äôs not.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, he-‚Äú

‚ÄúLt, I think it‚Äôs time for you to go.‚Äù Sam spoke up, having now reached the man‚Äôs side.

‚ÄúI just got here, Sergeant. I have the right to attend.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd I have the right to ask you to get out.‚Äù The man behind the bar yelled over. The movie had now been paused, out of frustration.

‚ÄúFine.‚Äù Rainer shook his head, following Sam out of the room. ‚ÄúHey, Sam, wait up.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm good.‚Äù Sam replied, accelerating his pace and heading outside, into the cold night air. He did not particularly like dealing with Rainer's lack of tact: there was a reason he had languished as an Lt postwar, as so many others received promotions. Frankly, Sam wasn't even sure why the man was in the army, given how obviously dead his career was. 

Regardless, other duties. There were a small base patrol vehicle on the road, moving along, and so Sam broke into a sprint, trying to grab the driver‚Äôs attention. It ground to a halt, an electric version of the infantry squad vehicles. The driver, a tired-looking young American, raised his eyebrow at being hailed by a running Brit in regular dress uniform. The vehicle was crammed, but Sam could see some space. In the worst case, he'd happily hold on for dear life if it got him where he was going faster.

‚ÄúYou good?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, man. Just need a lift across the base if you can. You passing the uhh‚Ä¶ fuck, what‚Äôs it called. Big office building, all the classes and group shit goes on-‚Äú

‚ÄúOh, yeah. I know. Yeah we‚Äôre passing by, hop in.‚Äù

‚ÄúTa.‚Äù Sam replied, jumping into the back in the only spare seat. Next to him was another soldier, a bit more alert but still evidently wishing he got a different shift. His rifle sat lazily across his lap, as he looked across the lit up base.

‚ÄúYou want some dip, man?‚Äù The soldier asked, turning to Sam and pulling out a small tin. The vehicle set off, at a sedate pace.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm good.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù A female soldier in a different row of seats chuckled at the insistence, and Sam got the impression this was routine.

‚ÄúVery.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo I know you from somewhere?‚Äù The man said, between taking a pinch of tobacco and inserting it into his mouth.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think so.‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, I‚Äôve seen your face somewhere. Somewhere. Not sure.‚Äù The man shook his head, dismissing the thought. ‚ÄúYou know anything about the transfer programme?‚Äù

‚ÄúTransfer programme?‚Äù

‚ÄúKearney here‚Äôs obsessed with trying to get to Britain. Thinks they‚Äôre gonna take him. What would the Brits want with a dip-addled psycho, eh Kearney?‚Äù The female soldier laughed as she talked, nodding his head back. The other occupants snorted audibly.

‚ÄúFuck you too, Burch.‚Äù

‚ÄúI dunno much about all that, you‚Äôd have to talk to whoever our guy is on base."" Sam admitted. ""That‚Äôs the uhhh‚Ä¶ the thing where you get a fast track to citizenship right?‚Äù

‚ÄúLive out your US active duty career, spend 2 years with you guys, get citizenship real quick. Yeah. I got a girl already over there, she just wants me to be over soon as I can. Don't have long left of active duty here.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds familiar.‚Äù That particular program was one of the many efforts by other countries to poach American personnel as future soldiers of whichever nation. Sam recalled the offers made to air force and navy personnel were particularly attractive, but they were happy to take anyone.

The American government weren‚Äôt too happy with the arrangement, of course, but it had already seen enough participants sign up that trying to do anything more than quiet protest would likely cause a whole lot of troops to practically abandon any remaining duties until they got to leave for Britain. There were rumours of secret caps on soldiers, backdoor monetary compensation, and so on, but whatever the arrangement, it still remained attractive to Britain.

‚ÄúYou reckon I can get it, though?‚Äù

‚ÄúMate, I don‚Äôt know shit about the program, but they‚Äôd probably take you anyway. You serve in the war?‚Äù

‚ÄúBattle of Vegas.‚Äù A small amount of what could have been pride entered the man's voice.

‚ÄúYeah, they‚Äôd find something for you then. Speak to, uhh‚Ä¶ ask around for me tomorrow, Sergeant Heppell, I‚Äôll figure out who you need to speak to.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks, man.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo trouble.‚Äù

They rode in continued silence, unti they reached the building Sam was looking for. The vehicle halted, and he clambered out.

‚ÄúThanks for the lift.‚Äù

‚ÄúHappy to.‚Äù The driver said, the other occupants waving goodbye. Sam returned the wave, jogging into the building. He proceeded rapidly through the halls, boots clacking as he searched for the right room. Eventually, a paper sign glued to the door betrayed his target, and he halted, taking a moment to check his uniform was all correct. Then he knocked, and a few seconds later a smiling American in a suit opened the door. Civilian, probably.

‚ÄúAh, another Brit, come in, we-‚Äú

‚ÄúSorry, mate. I‚Äôm not here for the class. I‚Äôm here for Staff Sergeant Witchell, can I borrow him for a moment?‚Äù

The man nodded, turning around and revealing the dozing Witchell in a foldable chair, surrounded by officers that looked in varying states of anguish. One leaned over, and shook him slightly.

Witchell bolted upright, before looking to the door and seeing a soldier in British uniform and wearing a UN beret. This seemed to cause some sort of fear response in him, before he recognised the face, and sighed in probable relief.

‚ÄúWon‚Äôt be too long, I promise.‚Äù Sam said, and Witchell nodded, walking over to greet him. Before he could close the door behind him, Sam heard the conversation restarting, a Major apparently being asked about some sort of slapping incident. Sam ushered Witchell around a corner, so they wouldn‚Äôt be blocking the way. And, more importantly so they wouldn‚Äôt be overheard.

‚ÄúSorry, I didn‚Äôt want to disturb your nap. Just need to know if you got an update on that rifle we found.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe rifle?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe AR type I found with the Hekatian prisoner?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, that one. Yeah, sorry, I have so many of these fucking things to deal with. Hold on.‚Äù Witchell pulled out his phone, looking through his notes. ‚ÄúThe joys of spreadsheet apps, I can never fucking escape work.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the shit this time?‚Äù

‚ÄúRainer, as usual. Half his soldiers are as bad as him. This time, it‚Äôs rifle parts. Just not cleaning shit properly, so it‚Äôs breaking and jamming and needs replacement. I swear he‚Äôs running a punishment platoon, except they‚Äôre here to punish the rest of us.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell me about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou heard about the grenade launcher, right?‚Äù Witchell carried on before Sam could interject. ‚ÄúThey melted that thing and asked me to fix it. We‚Äôre not even supposed to have them, I don‚Äôt have the bloody ammo for an automatic smart grenade launcher. I mean, I have the regular ammo for a 40 mil grenade machine gun, not the special shit for a Mk 47. Where they even got it, you know-‚Äú

‚ÄúFocus.‚Äù Sam said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just here about the rifle.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, I know, but it‚Äôs driving me mad. My money is on them trading for it with some yanks and then the yanks intentionally left out the whole bit about the lubricant. You know, use the *right goddamn lube* or else it catches fire. Bet you that the yanks left that out because they knew the consequences would be funny. I have pictures.‚Äù Witchell tabbed out to his photo app, scrolling through for a moment. ‚ÄúYeah, see.‚Äù

Sam looked at the photo. True to Witchell‚Äôs word, the grenade machine gun before him was melted, a collection of parts best used as scrap. He‚Äôd heard the story, but hadn‚Äôt seen the results.

‚ÄúJesus.‚Äù

‚ÄúYep. They wanted me to fix that. How the hell do they think I‚Äôm supposed to do that? I mean, jeez, and people wonder why I got sent to anger management, th-‚Äú

‚ÄúThe rifle?‚Äù Sam was rather impatient now.

‚ÄúSorry. Sorry. Got a bit distracted. Here.‚Äù Witchell finally got to the point. ‚ÄúOkay, owner made an attempt to file off the serial numbers, but they didn‚Äôt do a good enough job. Plugged it into some registeries, asked around, last trace was as the issue weapon of a police unit in Kansas, went missing. Assumption from the people I talked to was that it was in the hands of a guy that got ambushed and killed some time last year.‚Äù

‚ÄúAmbushed? Any info on that report?‚Äù Sam was slightly alarmed by that detail. Were they dealing with something far larger here?

‚ÄúIt was at KC."" *That explained it*. At least that meant it wasn't likely to be remnants that killed those cops. ""Rumour has it the owner was one of the guys hung over the stands, but I can‚Äôt be arsed digging into that one. Of course, could also be bullshit, gun got stolen or misappropriated away. But I don't know, all I do know is, cop gun somehow ends up in unauthorised hands down in KC, then months later in the hands of your little batch of remnants. Question is, who did they kill or buy it from?‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm.‚Äù

‚ÄúWould be nice to get hands on the weapons of the rest of them, to maybe get a better idea. You said they had plasma *and* bullets?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all we could tell. Did a sweep after and only found 5.56 cartridges, but they took their weapons.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh well. Has he gotten interrogated yet?‚Äù

Sam thought about the earlier revelation, and decided quite which lie he would tell.

‚ÄúNo, not yet. Medical still in progress.‚Äù

‚ÄúShame. There is a question I‚Äôd like them to ask, when he's able to, though.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo on?‚Äù Sam asked, curious. Maybe it would be a useful line of inquiry.

‚ÄúWell, I wanna know what was up with his gear. Obviously, I got a hold of it after he was brought in, along with the rifle. And, well, it was a mess. No weapon cleaning gear, his pouches were loaded in a real stupid way, he didn‚Äôt even pack his first aid kit well.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, he stuffed his reloads into his pockets, then had shit *on top* of them. If he wanted to reload his gun, he would have had to reach in to a pocket, pull out his loose bandages, pull out a snack, *then* he could get to his ammo. Real stupid. He would have been trained by the Imperium, then he spends two years running around the woods, but he brings a single water bottle and no purification tablets out for a patrol that turns into an ambush? Or an ambush that, presumably, involves a long walk back from and to their base, considering we couldn‚Äôt find the bastards. Either this guy was the *dumbest*, luckiest bastard they had, or something isn‚Äôt right.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe he just didn‚Äôt have any tablets to spare.‚Äù Sam half muttered, trying not to give away the real answer now he knew it.

‚ÄúThen bring another water bottle. These are like, literal *rookie* mistakes, Sam, you‚Äôd know that better than anyone. I‚Äôd love to know how the hell he survived training, the war, then two whole years without learning how to use the weapons of his enemy or pack a pouch.‚Äù 

""Then maybe someone else inspected it, before you saw it. Took shit out and didn't put it back.""

""Nah. If so, then there's gonna be hell to pay as soon as I find out who."" Witchell shook his head vigorously, before launching into another point. ‚ÄúThen he goes and gets excited in the middle of battle, charges straight into a waiting unit of troops, including an IFV, while his buddies hang back. Even if he‚Äôd gotten you, he‚Äôd still have been mulched. It's like he had no clue what he was doing. I don‚Äôt get it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho knows.‚Äù Sam replied. ‚ÄúNot our department, I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll figure it out one day.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúWord of advice, anyway.‚Äù Sam added. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd suggest you keep this whole thing on the down low. What you saw with the weapon, I mean. Because it‚Äôs probably going in the evidence locker.‚Äù

The evidence locker was the euphemism used to describe the weapons that were being diverted to local militias, the cover story being they were simply weapons that had been recovered during operations and would be dealt with appropriately. Currently, the vast majority of them were being concealed inside a spare Boxer module in the garage. Having the rifle moved in there wasn‚Äôt really important, it was more that the implication of it being stored there meant Witchell was unlikely to share his observations. Otherwise, other people might put together the strange details he had noted.

Ironically, this was the one time the moniker was appropriate.

‚ÄúIs it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, probably. Not sure.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, far as anyone else is concerned, you don‚Äôt know shit about that guy, and the rifle is no longer with you for examination. Got it?‚Äù

‚ÄúCrystal. That everything?‚Äù

‚ÄúShould be.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcellent."" Witchell smiled. ""I got another hour of this. It‚Äôs fantastic, I feel like it‚Äôs a support group for victims of incompetence. Maybe you should give it a go.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm good, mate.‚Äù

‚ÄúI dunno, probably would help you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm good.‚Äù

Witchell didn‚Äôt press the issue, nodding and returning to the anger management room. Sam left the building, once again in the night air. There was a slight rustle of wind in the air, but not enough to dissuade him from a jog back. Good to get the exercise in, anyway, now that he didn't need to be particularly urgent.

It wasn‚Äôt too long before he was on the approach towards the UN section of the base, his run only interrupted by the passing of the patrol vehicle from earlier, whose aid he politely declined this time. There were some soldiers milling around, but mostly everyone was indoors.

The first mortar round came arcing in from the nearby suburbs, as Sam was just crossing the road. He had heard the sound before it landed, and thrown himself to the ground, covering his head as it hit at what could only barely be a hundred metres away. Shrapnel spewed into the air around the impact, a terrifying rain of steel as Sam cringed closer against the ground, thankfully feeling no debris hit him. 

There was silence for a moment, everyone seeming to digest what had just happened, before the base suddenly exploded into activity, alarms blaring and troops suddenly storming out. At least he wasn‚Äôt supposed to be on alert duty tonight, so it wasn‚Äôt Sam‚Äôs job to respond. He picked himself off the ground, briefly stopping to collect the piece of shrapnel that had landed just 5 metres away from him, and ponder the consequences had he been just a little further along. Then the second mortar round came in, thankfully quite a lot further away, and Sam decided it was a bad idea to contemplate the possibility of death right now.

He decided to run for the garage, given it was underground and therefore a good shelter. Sprinting along, he could see the readied Boxers of the alert platoon emerge, their passengers racing to board and start the hunt for the source. There was a rattle of gunfire from the barracks roof, and other places, seemingly aimed into the sky, whilst yet another round came raining in. Something fell out of the air *other* than a shell, maybe a drone, maybe not, but Sam was too busy to pay much attention. He did note the third shell came in on another trajectory, though, so he guessed someone was correcting fire, probably trying to hit the barracks. Sam wasn't sure how it would hold up to a direct impact, and didn't want to check.

The fourth came, but it was off target, and the alert units were rolling towards the gate right now. If the attackers had any sense, and Sam feared they would have more than he liked, they would currently be getting the hell out before they got caught. If you could even call this an attack, because frankly it smelt more of a probe. Get a rough sense of where shells land, bug out, watch from around the corner what the response will be. Either way, as he slipped inside the garage and into it's concrete protection, he had a suspicion this wouldn‚Äôt be the last time they had explosives landing inside the wire.

His workday began at dawn with the rising sun and ended when the sun dipped below the horizon. Sundays and holidays were days when he worked fewer hours so he could attend his local church and enjoy a round of cards at the bar, exchanging updates and news. He never felt the need for periodic breaks to unwind or recharge. Even though his work was physically demanding, and livestock alignments and harvest mishaps caused mental concern, he never took sick days. His honest earnings, while meagre, provided a comfortable lifestyle, allowing him to educate his children and care for his family.

# Daily Sustenance and Simple Pleasures

His lunch breaks were a treat, thanks to the simplicity and genuineness of the ingredients. The delicious homemade pies and hearty sandwiches, wrapped in cloth, were satisfying and made with unaltered ingredients. In winter, his thermos kept coffee warm, while in summer, it held a cool orange drink to quench his thirst. He didn‚Äôt throw away containers and wrappers but brought them home to be washed and reused.

Produce was local, ripe, and flavourful but not available year-round. The community would take the seasonal abundance and preserve it with sugar, olive oil, and salt for the scarce winter months. Food didn‚Äôt come with barcodes or mysterious ingredients and best-before dates were in the mind of the preparer. Expiry dates only occurred on those rare occasions when a jar became contaminated and started to smell funny.

# Technology and Sustainability

While nothing was high-tech or fancy, everything was durable and repairable. If something broke, a skilled mechanic with the right service manuals could fix it. If a part was no longer available, it could be machined.

He found joy and solace in the chirping of birds, the buzz of insects, and the presence of creatures that shared his land. When he wasn‚Äôt shuffling a deck of cards, his favourite pastime was aiming stones at a makeshift target while silently planning for the next tilling, sowing, or harvest.

# Community and Connection

His social life revolved around the local church and the friends he met on Sundays at the bar. His sources of information were the local newspaper, the pulpit, and the town grapevine. His online shopping consisted of picking up the phone to call the local shop to inquire about product availability or delivery times. Same-day delivery would only happen if he went to pick up an item himself; next-day delivery would occur only if it coincided with the delivery man‚Äôs weekly route.

# Family Life and Entertainment

Dinner was a time for heartfelt conversations with his wife and children about their day. Problems were shared, and achievements were celebrated. The family gathered around their TV, which had a few channels that transmitted for several hours each evening. The broadcasts were local, truthful, and positive, prioritizing community values over audience share.

# Community Spirit

The church bells were the community‚Äôs alert system that brought out the community in times of happiness or sadness. Whether to celebrate or to grieve, the community came together whenever the situation called for it. They set aside any differences for these occasions and many times, these events provided an opportunity for enemies to bury the hatchet and revive their friendships.

# The Changing Times

He and his wife taught their children everything they knew and worked hard to educate them so they would have more options and opportunities. However, the children believed that life beyond the farm was better‚Ä¶ They left for factory jobs or desk jobs‚Ä¶ And‚Ä¶",1,1733431581.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a 25F and he is 26M.,"I‚Äôm living in a dorm, met a guy that lives here and we instantly clicked. We started to meet very regularly as friends, do weird things together and have fun. After 2-3 weeks of hanging out, he told me he liked me and I told him that I‚Äôm not empty towards him as well. I also told that I‚Äôm not ready to be in relationship & he told me that he wants to be in relationship but okay with my decision but still wants to be monogamous-meaning we will only date each other. I agreed and did respect this. 

We started to hang out everyday that it almost started to feel like an addiction. Then we started to argue around him calling one of my best friend attractive, calling me a slur accidentally and asking multiple times to have sex even though i said no + gave him an explanation? I started get resentful but tried to not point fingers at him. What I like to do is simply take my distance when I‚Äôm upset or angry, and he is triggered by that. My schedule is so so busy, and it is my final assignment week. We started to argue again, I told him that let‚Äôs put this aside to be able to study (for both of us) and reflect more before arguing. He would come to my room unannounced either to bring me coffee or have a discussion which turns into argument. I told him let‚Äôs not see each other couple days until I finish my assignments because I‚Äôm unable to focus when I see him or argue. I‚Äôm obviously upset that he is pressuring me, all the things happened but also trying to catch my deadlines. I‚Äôm burned out and feel like he does not respect my boundaries. 

The other day, he came to my room after I told him I don‚Äôt wanna talk and I‚Äôm studying, I spent 3 hours to calm him down and couldn‚Äôt study. I told him I need more than couple days to have space in this dating thing, I need to reflect if I wanna be with him or not. He agreed and told that seeing me doesn‚Äôt help. Next day again he started appearing. Then at night, he called me and said ‚Äúa person told me you are seeing other people from dating apps‚Äù which is not true. We argued and I hanged up the call because he started accusing me of bunch of different things. Later, he came to my door very drunk and refused to leave. For 3 hours straight, I tried to take him to his room, told him to stop and that I‚Äôm uncomfortable. He refused to leave me alone and cried that he misses me a lot. 

I really care about him but this makes me feel stupid. I don‚Äôt know if I want to date him anymore, especially after him putting me in uncomfortable situations. But I would love to have him in my life as friend in future. These are all negative things happened lately, he also showed me that he is a very giving person before but I question if he is for me.

Me(20) and my boyfriend (20) have been together not even 2 months. He has had some relationship issues in the past that cause him to have pretty severe trust issues. I have shown him nothing but trust in the months I‚Äôve known him, but he still doubts me. He‚Äôs semi-controlling. For instance, he doesn‚Äôt like me having certain girl friends, doesn‚Äôt let me go to the gym by myself, persists on having my location 24/7, wants me to stay on the phone constantly when we aren‚Äôt together so he knows ‚Äúi‚Äôm not with another guy,‚Äù and gets mad when I go out of town to see my family because I could be doing ‚Äúfuck shit‚Äù instead of actually seeing them. I have turned my location on for him to stop freaking out, but it seems like it‚Äôs done nothing for him. He constantly calls if I go somewhere that seems abnormal like thrift stores, local coffee shops, etc. 

The main reason I‚Äôm writing this is because I have a certain guy friend that I‚Äôve known for quite some while. This guy friend and I have never done anything sexual, flirty, talked about a relationship; it‚Äôs just been a causal friendship with us occasionally talking about our day, jobs, etc. He says he doesn‚Äôt trust this guy after he has already eliminated so many people in my life already. I really don‚Äôt feel like ruining a genuine friendship over a fresh relationship but I want to make him happy. I let him see our texts and offered to let him meet this guy so he knows nothing is going on. 

At first, he accepted that idea and said he would feel more comfortable with me and him remaining friends if he knew him. I brought it up that he could sometime soon and he totally went back on his word. I‚Äôm confused because he switches up so fast. I understand that my boyfriend has boundaries and this could possibly make him uncomfortable, but I‚Äôve done nothing but reassurance him through every possible effort to let him see it‚Äôs nothing more than a text here and there about life. I mainly am wondering what I should do at this point. I‚Äôve already lost so many people because of him, some I can understand the reasoning behind, but others, it makes no sense. 

He is giving me ultimatums and telling me he‚Äôll break up with me if I don‚Äôt stop. I don‚Äôt see how this is fair to me and I‚Äôve been given a timeframe in which I need to ‚Äúact‚Äù on this.

**SPOILER WARNING: Since this is a rewatch, it's assumed that anyone in these discussions has already seen the entire show, so all spoilers are allowed.**


Day 74 brings us to ""Blood and Sand,"" which sends the team to San Felix Island, where they gain seemingly magical porting abilities back to the CBI office! The body of a young woman is found washed up on the beach. Despite the grim scene, Jane is in good spirits, enjoying the sea and the air. While exploring, he meets a rancher. While the island residents argue over where the woman came from, Jane finds a piece of driftwood and tosses it into the sea to test a theory.


Title relevance: The victim is found on the beach, and she was killed for finding the man who stabbed her father.

Location: San Felix Island


Notable guest stars: Debra Mooney (from Grey's Anatomy), Jonathan Schmock (from Blossom)


Notable scenes: 
- Jane finds his driftwood back on shore, which he takes as evidence that the girl, Talia, came from the island.
- While Grace and Rigsby look into the victim's history with Child and Family Services, Grace loses her temper with the woman's cavalier attitude and knocks over her coffee on her desk before storming out.
- Jane finds a note in the victim's notebook that leads them to a fishing boat. Jane spots plans for a dock expansion in the man's office.
- Jane and Lisbon then go to talk to a rancher, and Jane disappears to go talk to the ranch hands, where he dangles the idea that the rancher has no idea what he's doing. He talks to a man named Jed who has his arm in a cast.
- While tracking down one of Talia's old foster friends, Grace gets aggressive with the man, and he strikes her on the face.
- The team learns that Sarah and Rigsby are dating.
- Jane has tea and cake at the island tea shop and talks to the elderly owner. She tells him about a custom of throwing a flower into the sea to send a message to your loved ones who have passed.
- Jane visits Gardiner, the man who discovered Talia's body, at the butterfly sanctuary.
- Rigsby digs up the case of Talia's father's murder, done by a man named Edward Fish, who disappeared.
- Jane stages a big group reading, setting them all up to give their fingerprints, which causes Gardiner to flee. Lisbon arrests him, and Jane reveals he's Edward Fish.
- The case isn't solved, however, as Jane catches the ranch hand Jed knowing a detail about Talia's father's murder. Grace treats Jed with scorn while Rigsby tries to fake sympathy for him.
- Jane goes to the beach and tosses a flower into the ocean, presumably to send a message to his dead family.

Let me get this clear first I have still not overcome procrastination. Right now at 1:30am I am typing this instead of sleeping and doing what I had planned to do tommorrow waking up early. But here I am telling myself that I am going to sacrifice it for the same of another brother(sister) like me to help them(and I can type as fast as I can think if not faster). Who knows maybe its just an excuse. On a side not I have sometimes got the thought that thinking about other more than yourself is a disease. I could have blamed it as a symtpom of procrastination like you see someone who needs help you help them as a solid excuse to procrastinate but then when I used to not procrastinate and do like a ton of things from doing street plays against drugs charity work in rotract, exercise like a world class triathletes(When I did not know such a sport existed) go to Karate classes and spend also practice all the training you see in Chinese martial arts movies and van damme movies(like punching underwater)  and play cricket I still had time to like help many people at the same time(and AFAIR that time people like just took your help not excuse  or ""You think you know what I am going through"" drama they just took advice help got better and they were out of my life cause I was just doing so many things many still my freinds today and even with zero communication for decades if we meets there is love like we were always best buddies)

Side note over.

So if you did not procastinate reading this long ass comment then here goes.

Procrastination is a choice. YOu choose to procrastinate. That is a fact. So you are not born with it. Yes now I am not discounting why you feel like that cause I still believe that at some point people do get that ephiphany of what exactly their going through and you feel like that because procrastination is a symptom of something else like a disorder or ADD or whatever you call it.

What I have learned over the years and when people used to take my advice that everything is a habit you make a choice many times it becomes  habit.

And also that going against anything that is stopping like maybe you have an underlying condition but you have to fight that.

You must have seen those motivational videos of crippled people going to the gym a guy with palsy becomes a bodybuilder. With Cerebral palsy and what they found he had better control on his body that when he was not lifting weights.

So just fight it and I think the best way to transform mentally is to transform physically. give up unhealthy foods for example a diet give up coffee tea, any stimulants give up pot, just procrastinate consumng it.

Thats easy for us. Just keep some water nearby so say fuck instead of making coffee I am just going to drink some water I am too fucking lazy.

The next step might be hard but go to a gym you actually don't need to go to a gym per se but you need to work out. The best is pushups squats and pullups With pushups do the yogic Surya namaskara and what you call Hindu squats.

If you can't do anything then just do this

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tncBsU\_zuJA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tncBsU_zuJA)

Start with 1 per day.

Now this will transform your mind increase focus and its peer reviewed study proven [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4097921/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4097921/)

SO I have helped many before with this exercise. The video above also works but it is a slight variation from what I have learned(in early 90s when there was no interent) is you hold the ears differnetly. So you hold your hand in a knocking position. Wait I have already spent enough time so let me spend some time taking photos.(i thought I would finish typing this in like under a minute But I had to search for that video and waste time trying to search for the right way to hold the ear and 20 minuts have passed)

Here goes

Hold your ear lobe like I am holding the tip of the scalper

Just do this do 1 do two. Fight yourself scream if you have to. Worked for me once. Now Full disclosure I forgot about it. I guess thats the perk of trying to help people you get blessed. You just scream and do 1 and they say then relax but here is how you trick you mind.

Once you do 1 don't fucking stop...Procrastinate stopping and try doing 2 or 3 or 4.

Trust me whatever you are born with you will stop procrastinating atleast.

Its like those handicap peope who are climbing mount everest or lifting weights. If you think this is a handicap like some in the comments who are saying it is then still that doesn't mean you can't over come it. And like I said before the procrastination is not the ""handicap"" its some underlying condition.

For me It took me many years to realize this and let me tell you that it doens't happen like instantly when you are like me something has to happen to you in my case toxic people and just lazing around eating like 10000 calories cause I was used to eating that much cause I used to train like a super athlete. When I stopped training I continued eating put on weight and what got me was my affari with mary jane.

Even though  ended the affair in 6 months it was only after everything else I let go (which was easy once you are fucked by mary jane) It started hitting me like years later that is when you realize that you can't just let go and get back up again like you used to because of the affair with Mary Jane.

Lot of research and I found it is linked with depression but not everyone reacts the same way to depression so it seasy to ""argue""

So yeah if you want your life back do this quit everything procrastinate it. Eat a clean diet go on a jucie diet or something and then do this squat [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tncBsU\_zuJA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tncBsU_zuJA) start with one don't stop once you have started do it regulary hopefully you might  get your life back.

OHYES And stop watching porn and try to reduce Wanking if are doing any of those. Like Porn stop it 100% wanking well don't over do it like avoid it completely if you can don't do it as a habit if you feel really horny and have a hard on that won't go down and no partner to have sex then I think wanking is healthy.

Thank you for posting this If you had not posted this I would not have replied such a long as message and would not have remembered this squat that I know helped a lot of people and I was surprised to find today that peer reviewed published studies have proven this too.

I am writing regarding your company's perplexing design decision for the Windows Forms ScrollBar control, which has just cost me valuable development time.

After spending time debugging why my scrollbar appeared maxed out while my mouse's horizontal scroll wheel could still access additional content, I discovered this ""feature."" I had to modify perfectly logical code because someone at Microsoft decided that having developers specify the content size as Maximum was more intuitive than having Maximum mean, well, maximum.

Since this decision was made under your leadership when Windows Forms was released with .NET 1.0, I believe you owe me compensation for:

* 1 hour of debugging time
* 2 cups of coffee consumed during said debugging
* 3 gray hairs developed while questioning my sanity
* Several minutes spent explaining to my rubber duck why Maximum ‚â† maximum

Our office is a complete dump.  The kitchens are never cleaned.  The fridges are never cleared out.  There are no coffee machines (we had to buy our own).  We had to beg leadership to provide us a filtered water station and the one they brought in is trash.  Parking is available, but you have to pay for it and it's not cheap.  

The culture is incredibly stiff around here.  Though they claimed we had a ""limited"" out of state remote work policy, now there is a complete moratorium from anyone working anywhere other than the state of Colorado.  Some departments are fully remote, while other leaders have mandated their teams be hybrid.  That's generally okay with me, but they seem relatively inflexible about remote work.  And given that our office is terrible and the commute in is not exactly easy, more flexibility would be desired for sure.

Some examples include:

Reporting the broken garage door after a power outage

Reporting a power outage

Signing up for the Internet

Fixing the intercom


He claims I ‚Äúnag‚Äù him about these tasks, but I don‚Äôt think I do. For example, when I started unlocking the front door, he asked why I didn‚Äôt ring. I said the intercom is down (answering his question), but later he said this was nagging as I could have rang the doorbell.

The problem is, I‚Äôm not well-versed in technical or official tasks (I have ADHD, mild social anxiety, and little technical knowledge), but I also work a lot. I leave at 7 a.m., come back at 5 p.m. or later, and sometimes work weekends. Meanwhile, he works normally every couple of days and usually has a lot of downtime, including free days. I think it‚Äôs unfair that he expects me to handle these tasks when he has more time. He doesn‚Äôt do much more at home‚Äîhe waits to do chores when I‚Äôm doing them or when he needs something done.

He also refuses to clean in small increments and comments on its futility when I do it. He says I should organize my time better and get a less stressful job if I want to have time for fun and for home tasks. I actually like my job and think it‚Äôs unfair to expect me to change careers because he‚Äôs unwilling to contribute more at home or because he wants me to be around much more.

I suggested contributing proportionally to our household spending since I earn more than him (about twice as much). I started paying double into a shared account, but he refused to use it, saying he couldn‚Äôt match me. For a while, I paid into it, and the money just sat there unused - somehow we are spending it now. When I said that okay, let's pay equally for everything, he laughed and refused to track shared finances, saying I was adding more work for him and how that is unfair.

On top of this, he says I stress myself out because of my job. Recently, he mocked me for being ‚Äúdizzy, feeling bad, and panicking‚Äù and blamed it on my work. This really hurt because I‚Äôve been under a lot of pressure lately and have a history of panic attacks. Meanwhile, he stays up until 2-4 a.m., eats cakes and chips regularly at night (aside from meals we eat together during the day), and has been feeling bad himself- but he claims to have to do house stuff and to not be able to visit doctors. When I mentioned his habits might be why he feels bad, he dismissed it, as he had always had them. He acts as if he self sacrifices not taking time to deal with health, but I wish he just would.

As for his contributions, for example, he promised to assemble a chair for me but didn‚Äôt do it, claiming he‚Äôs been feeling bad all week. However, during the same week, he was fully ready to go to his grandfather‚Äôs and remount his 75-inch TV.

A week prior I reorganized the whole kitchen in a day, and even he was surprised, but did not praise me or act happy, rather felt he now needs to reorganize another room, and he started but didn't finish.

He does organize our health benefits (just paying once a month), but I would do it if he didn‚Äôt. Honestly, I would handle most of these tasks myself, but I worry he‚Äôd get mad at how I do them, since I‚Äôd just get something ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù instead of finding the best deal. He spends hours comparing deals for small discounts, which I feel is a time sink but seems important to him.

On top of everything, he often resents me for not thinking about him proactively. For example, while I was at his work, I left 2/3 of a pastry for him while I ate 1/3. He later got mad, saying he didn‚Äôt have time to eat because everyone needed him, even though he could‚Äôve said something and taken a break. I often ask him if he wants tea or coffee or a sandwich, but he tells me he can make it himself and usually says no.

This dynamic makes me feel unappreciated. I fear we‚Äôll grow apart as I resent him more and more. I am upset and feel stuck, is there something I should be doing differently?",1,1733430186.0,relationship_advice,30,0.67,False

The problem is I don‚Äôt know too much about him. He doesn‚Äôt speak much English and I only speak kitchen Spanish. I know he likes going to the gym, and that‚Äôs about the extent of it. He‚Äôs 27, I think. Any suggestions? ",3,1733430060.0,GiftIdeas,1,1.0,False

I added a teaspoon of coffee grounds yesterday, water deeply once a week and lightly twice a week. Temperature is kept between 70¬∞F and 80¬∞F and I recently moved it more into the sun. There is a grow light for all my peppers as well. 

It could just be the amount of fruits, the serrano is loaded with about 50 peppers one to three inches long. I did have 4 yellow leaves which have fallen, all from the lower main stem. ",3,1733430033.0,HotPeppers,4,1.0,False

1h7iotx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1h7iotx/jury_duty/,Jury duty,"Monday before Thanksgiving I'm the 1st in line at the courthouse. I had to be dropped off, but coffee and cigarettes pass the time. I'd been there before to push back serving, so I knew where the line was going to form.

About 45 minutes before they open, a second person comes up, older boomer man. But instead of saying anything, he just stands right in front of the door- pulling on it didn't work for him. No big, he's gonna have to move when security gives us the run down outside. The next 10 people were all about the same age, just forming a clump with the first guy. I just roll my eyes as they're complaining about nonsense.

By the time there's 20 just clumped together, the guard comes out and tells them to form a line. ""Ah, right behind her"", and points to me. 1st boomer to show up looked bit flustered, and made a huffing noise. A couple of them whine, ""We were here waiting first though!""... 

Finally chimed in, ""Funny, I didn't see you up here at 5:30 when I got here."" I'm only slightly annoyed, but mostly entertained by their flustered antics. Got a few dirty looks, but that's bound to happen with my hair and patched jacket. The line outside literally has no impact on how long we were there that day, anyhow.

1h7imx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vasectomy/comments/1h7imx4/threw_up_during_the_procedure/,Threw up during the procedure...  ,"I had the procedure done Monday 12/2 in office (traditional scalpel). The morning of I was feeling nauseous  but wasn't overly nervous about the procedure. My older children were in school, had someone to watch the baby with help lined up next few days, decided to just get it done. Was also trying to make sure I got it done this month under my HDHP insurance. 

Ate a small breakfast bar and really only had coffee and water prior. During prep the nurse told me to remove my sweatshirt because many times people feel hot after the injection. Procedure starts, get the first injection to the nuts, and next thing I know I am profusely sweating bullets and felt like I was going to vomit. 

The nurses left the room when the procedure started and was just me and the doc. I immediately tell him I feel like I am going to get sick and need something. He's calling for the nurses repeatedly and nobody was answering. I then start to panic that I'm about to puke as the doctor was mid procedure and nothing he could personally do. After like 5x call outs a nurse finally comes in, I feel relief, but then she starts slowly slapping on gloves and I couldn't hold it anymore, turn to my side and vomited off the table, on my shirt, and all onto the floor. It was a f'ing mess. 

Nurses put ice packs on the back of my neck and on my head which immediately helped. Regained my senses and doc finished the first nut. Asked if I wanted to reschedule the other side but told him to finish the job. No longer felt sick. No issue with the second nut injection and after another 5 minutes it was all over. As I was leaving and scheduling my 2 week follow up and in the waiting room I started getting dizzy and sweating bullets again. Almost passed out. Nurses had come out and had to ice me down again and give me another 15 minutes to compose myself. I unfortunately drove myself to the visit and had to drive myself home. 

I was extremely embarrassed but the doc said this happens and is a fight or flight response. The needle to the nuts hurt like a mother f'er. He did say to me someone one time shit themselves on the table, so I guess it could always be worse. I am also relieved I did not throw up forward onto my open nut suck and get myself infected. I'm 72 hours post op now and everything is fine. Minimal post op pain and recovery has been a lot smoother than the procedure. I'm thinking I may have had a stomach bug that compounded the issue. The whole situation sucked but kinda makes for a funny story. 

TL;DR - Needle to the nuts caused my to puke. It can happen, but I might have also been sick. Good luck to everyone!

1h7ij26,https://i.redd.it/eff7qlfu735e1.jpeg,Can someone explain the meal plan options to me?,"So, I'm shelling out actual money for a meal plan that magically transforms my $1 into $0.76‚Äîbecause apparently inflation isn't doing enough already. Then, I take my newly discounted Monopoly money over to Paws & Go, where I can snag a breakfast bar for the low, low price of $4. The same bar that costs $0.35 at literally any grocery store. So not only am I paying extra for the privilege of reduced facility hours, but I also get the bonus experience of being double ripped off. I must be missing something, right? Like maybe there's a hidden fee for audacity?
