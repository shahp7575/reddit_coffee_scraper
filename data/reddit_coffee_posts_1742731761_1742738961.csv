I was going to give it another month or so before re-introducing any type of alcohol but it’s rare we get to go out these days with two kids. I prepared yesterday afternoon by buying a tin of Black Buffalo Zero in the blood orange flavor just in case. I wound up not having any urges but I felt pretty relaxed after two bourbons and popped in one of the zero pouches just for fun. I can see where these would help with the oral fixation and habit, however, I won’t be continuing to purchase them. They’re just as expensive and while I didn’t necessarily feel guilty using one, it brought back emotions associated with having a *crutch*, and I don’t want that in my life. 

This morning is going good! Cup of coffee and watching church with the kiddos. Hope you all enjoy your Sunday.

The exam consists of two modules as per Cisco’s official announcement:

• DES (3 hours): Multiple-choice questions

• DOO (5 hours): Lab session


Arrive at the exam center by 8:00 AM. The Cisco office is on the 25th floor, but you need to register at the ground-floor reception to receive an access pass.

The access pass will allow you to enter the Cisco office.

Once you reach the 25th floor, go to the Cisco reception and inform them that you are there for the CCIE exam. A proctor will escort you to the exam room and explain the rules and guidelines.


Exam Environment

The exam starts at 8:30 AM with the DES session. Once completed, the system will automatically redirect you to the DOO session.

The exam room has two rows of five seats, arranged in opposite directions.

Each workstation includes two 24-inch monitors, a keyboard, and a mouse.

The room can be cold, so consider bringing a warm coat.

Ensure you read all resources and guidelines carefully.

Around 11:50 AM, the proctor will announce a lunch break. The exam session will be paused.

Lunch lasts 15-20 minutes and will be provided.

Only one person can access the restroom at a time, using an access card kept inside the exam room.

After completing the lab session, double-check everything, save your work, and remain in EXEC mode.

Click ""End DOO Session"" to finish the exam.

Coffee and water are available for free. Feel free to enjoy them.


Post-Exam

Exam results are usually available within 2-4 hours if you take the exam in Singapore from Tuesday to Thursday. Otherwise, results are typically available within 24 hours.

Why do we let things that are clearly dangerous become normalized?

Until this week, you have to wake up at 4-5 AM just because your ancestors believed in some religion from who-knows-where. My fanatic mother insists on preparing food for me, claiming that waking up for suhoor is more virtuous and rewarding. Even so, I go back to sleep because I know rest is more important. And by 9 AM, I have to be at the office.

Normally, I’d get a full night’s sleep from 11 PM to 6 AM, but now my sleep is interrupted—I’m woken up at 4 AM and then again at 7 AM by my alarm to avoid being late. I wake up exhausted and tired, so I make coffee, but even that doesn’t fully help. I still zone out during my commute to work. Not to mention, you have to stay focused because the roads here are narrow, and I ride a motorcycle, which requires extra alertness.

Once, I almost hit a tree near the sidewalk because I wasn’t focused. Thankfully, it was just a solo accident, and I fell off my bike while wearing a helmet.

This practice truly doesn’t respect human biological rhythms. Your body needs time to adapt because, for the 11 months prior, it wasn’t shocked by this kind of diet and sleep schedule.

And sometimes, I have to secretly eat and avoid eating in front of those who are fasting. If caught, you’re looked down upon by coworkers who think they’re holier-than-thou. Ironically, they often sleep during work hours, while I’m the one backing up their tasks. That’s why I eat—to stay productive.",2,1742738702.0,exmuslim,1,1.0,False

He has me convinced that I am in the wrong but I truly don’t even know what I did to cause this. This cycle is the same every single time.

We have been together (on and off, mostly on in some capacity) several years and finances have always been a difficulty. I (29f) am stable but my boyfriend (31m) has been unemployed trying to sell his handmade products. It has not been consistently successful. His bank account is always approaching zero and it causes a LOT of stress on the relationship. He talks about making money or him losing all his money seemingly non stop. He has not ever been stable in the entire time I’ve known him. We have had arguments about money before when I expressed wanting to go on a little date from time to time or when I told him I was a little hurt that he didn’t even get me a card on Christmas. I am not expecting much, just a little effort.

A few weeks ago it was my birthday. He offered to spend his money on the day doing slightly more expensive activities than normal (we went and did a round of go karting). At the time, I asked him if he was sure, and that it was a lot of money and that I’d be happy to do something else, and he told me he wanted me to enjoy my day, but that I would need to pay for my birthday dinner. I said ok that is fine. It was a fun day and I expressed as much gratitude as possible. We both ended up spending a bit more money than usual but it was really a blast and so worth it.

Fast forward the next day, we go out driving. I get myself a little coffee and he doesn’t want anything. Later in the day, he asked if I would buy him food. What he wanted was probably $20 (not a lot by normal standards), but they had a half option for $7. I told him I’d be glad to get him something but asked if he would get the half because it was more expensive than I thought and that we had both spent a lot of money over the weekend and it was back to reality. We also still needed to grocery shop that day. He immediately got super angry and told me he couldn’t believe I wouldn’t buy him lunch after all he did for my bday. I told him that I felt like birthdays were special days and that if I knew he had been expecting me to ‘pay him back’ in a sense, than I would not have accepted him spending his money on me. I told him that I was just trying to be mindful of my money as usual. An argument ensued and he basically told me we weren’t spending money on each other anymore.

Now last night, we were looking into buying crypto. He asked me how much I was going to buy and told him I needed to check my bank acct. He then asked how much I had in my bank account and I told him. He immediately gets prickly and says ‘WOW WOOOOOWWW BRO and you wouldn’t even buy my lunch after your f’ing birthday’. For context, I have been working really hard to save this last year after leaving my career and starting over financially. I told him I would not be where I’m at if I wasn’t tight with my money like that. He then accused me of playing by ‘different rules’. Said I demand he spend tons of money on me. Simply not true. He even claims I have told him that ‘relationships are about spending money’. That is erroneous. I had said to him that it was pretty normal to want to do something out of your routine from time to time with your partner, but he is twisting this to fit his narrative. If I was all about the money, I wouldn’t be with him..

The argument devolved and he told me I was the most selfish, manipulative person he knew and that I was a waste and that he’s over me… I desperately tried to remind him of the following things to prove that this whole thing is ridiculous:

1) Quite literally the day before my bday, I suggested we try to cut back even more on eating out to try and save
2) Offered to brainstorm free activities to do together
3) Every single time he impulsively offers to spend money on something, I tell him ohh baby that ok you don’t have to do that, that’s a lot of money, maybe you should save it
4) Offered to loan him money many times, as he is quite literally always broke
5) He has been using my car bc his is broken and he can’t afford to fix it (also the morning of the fight, I went to drive to work and he left it completely on E and the front tire was flat)
6) I buy and cook a vast majority of our dinners at my house to try and alleviate some stress for him
7) Help him with his personal work endeavors and try to encourage him to get a job (again, it has been over 2 years since he has worked somewhere)

I could go on. I’ll also add.. there are plenty of times that I’ve made a mistake and could admit that. Like oh maybe I was a little passive aggressive, or not thoughtful enough. So it’s not like I’m some holier than thou person. But anyway, he told me a list of why he hates me right now and I said sweetie it seems like you just don’t even like me.. and I asked him if he wanted to break up. He screamed that we were done.

We have had other terrible fights/breakups in the past about his anger problem, lying, porn/social media. He has untreated bipolar and the anger and whiplashing is something I’ve never experienced. I know this relationship wasn’t right but I’m just totally in 2. He always ends up rapid fire apologizing and convincing me to come back or to at least talk, where he will then demand I take the blame. That’s what’s happening now. I just can’t do this anymore but I don’t know what strategy will help me to stay away this time. Last breakup, even after 5 months I was still so heartbroken. Thought maybe we could be friends but we immediately jumped back in. It’s very hard to love someone and have SO much in common and have so much fun during good times but then be totally rocked periodically for reasons that seem to not make sense to me.

TLDR: Now ex boyfriend has insane anger problems and I need to try and figure out how to not go back to him after this horrible breakup, and I’m struggling with the blame of the fight all being shifted to me. My friends and family are worried about my future.",3,1742738256.0,AIO,5,1.0,False
1jhztim,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1jhztim/ffs/,FFS.,"I am so freaking frustrated I can barely think straight.

I've been saying for over a week now that we're going to need to do groceries soon. Over a week I've been saying hey we're getting low on this and we're out of that. 

I've asked 3 days in a row for him to go to the grocery store and buy freaking milk and a few staple items. Every time being met with a ""uh huh okay, sure, in a bit"" and then an inevitable ""it can wait til tomorrow right?"" When he wants to go out and realizes he hasn't gone for them yet. 

Today I reminded him again because we're entirely out of milk now. And coffee. And basically everything else. 

He agrees to grab milk while he brings the toddler to the sitter. I say can you also grab chicken strips and maybe some frozen veggies too? 

And what do I get? You said you wanted milk and water, you didn't say I was doing a whole fucking grocery shop. And where are we getting the money from? 

Like fuck me. He's the one doing the finances, there's supposed to be a grocery budget built in to cover said groceries. 

Also, does he not have eyes?! Can he not see how empty the fridge and cupboards are?? Like FUCK SAKE.

Thankfully the position he starts tonight is like $6 an hour raise so that'll definitely help but seriously wtf.

1jhzt67,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakeland/comments/1jhzt67/you_are_hypothetically_put_in_charge_of_lakeland/,You are hypothetically put in charge of Lakeland,"Asked an Ai what it would do for Lakeland:

Certainly! Here’s a highly detailed and specific approach to the 10 policies I would implement as the hypothetical leader of Lakeland, FL:

### 1. **Infrastructure Revitalization Fund**
   - **Policy:** Create a $50 million Infrastructure Revitalization Fund with a clear 5-year timeline, targeting critical repairs and improvements.
   - **Specific Action Steps:**
     - **Sewer and Water System Repairs:** Allocate $20 million for immediate repairs to the aging wastewater system. Prioritize areas with known system failures (e.g., West Lake Parker Drive) and replace old pipes that pose a risk of leaks or bursts.
     - **Roadway Upgrades:** Use $15 million for resurfacing major roads such as South Florida Avenue and Memorial Boulevard. Implement ADA-compliant pedestrian crossings and upgrade stormwater drainage systems.
     - **Traffic Flow Enhancements:** Implement smart traffic lights at key intersections to ease congestion, with a focus on busy areas like the Lakeland Mall and the airport.

### 2. **Transportation Modernization**
   - **Policy:** Create a comprehensive transportation modernization plan with a focus on sustainability and efficiency.
   - **Specific Action Steps:**
     - **Bus Network Expansion:** Increase the Lakeland Area Mass Transit District (LAMTD) budget by 25% to expand bus routes. Specifically, add new routes connecting the downtown area to key residential neighborhoods like Crystal Lake and South Lakeland.
     - **Bike Lane Infrastructure:** Allocate $3 million to create a 30-mile network of protected bike lanes along major roads, including Memorial Boulevard, North Florida Avenue, and around Lake Mirror.
     - **Pedestrian Walkability Projects:** Install pedestrian bridges at major intersections (e.g., US-92 and Lakeland Highlands Road) to reduce traffic accidents and increase safety for walkers.

### 3. **Green Building Standards**
   - **Policy:** Mandate that all new city-funded construction and renovation projects follow LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Gold standards.
   - **Specific Action Steps:**
     - **Sustainable Zoning Incentives:** Create a zoning overlay district that offers tax incentives for developers who build to LEED Gold standards or higher. This includes a 15% reduction in building permit fees and expedited permit processing for green-certified projects.
     - **City Building Projects:** Retrofit existing city buildings, such as the Lakeland City Hall and Public Library, with energy-efficient systems, such as solar panels, LED lighting, and water-saving fixtures. Allocate $2 million for these improvements.

### 4. **Affordable Housing Initiative**
   - **Policy:** Develop 1,000 affordable housing units over 5 years with a mix of new construction and renovation.
   - **Specific Action Steps:**
     - **Mixed-Income Housing Projects:** Identify and purchase land near transit corridors, such as areas around the Lakeland Bus Transfer Station and the Florida Polytechnic University campus, to build mixed-income housing. The goal would be 60% affordable units (rented at 80% AMI) and 40% market-rate units.
     - **Incentivize Developers:** Implement a program where developers receive up to $500,000 in tax credits for every 100 affordable units built.
     - **Rent Subsidy Program:** Allocate $1.5 million annually to a rent subsidy program aimed at helping low-income renters with income-based rent reductions.

### 5. **Urban Revitalization Task Force**
   - **Policy:** Create a dedicated task force focused on the revitalization of Memorial Boulevard and surrounding areas.
   - **Specific Action Steps:**
     - **Business Incentives:** Provide $5 million in grants for businesses willing to relocate to the Memorial Boulevard corridor. Offer grants of up to $100,000 for businesses that provide permanent jobs and invest in building improvements.
     - **Community Engagement:** Hold quarterly public meetings to gather input from local residents and businesses on the types of revitalization efforts they want to see, and adjust the plan accordingly.

### 6. **Public Safety and Community Policing**
   - **Policy:** Implement a community policing strategy with an emphasis on de-escalation and non-violent crisis intervention.
   - **Specific Action Steps:**
     - **Mental Health Crisis Response Team:** Allocate $2 million to create a 24/7 mental health crisis team made up of social workers, paramedics, and psychologists to respond to non-violent emergency calls. This team will work in conjunction with the Lakeland Police Department (LPD) to reduce police involvement in non-criminal incidents.
     - **Community Engagement Initiatives:** Launch monthly “Coffee with a Cop” events across neighborhoods, where residents can speak directly with officers in a casual, non-threatening environment.

### 7. **Healthcare Access and Expansion**
   - **Policy:** Increase healthcare access by expanding emergency and primary care facilities.
   - **Specific Action Steps:**
     - **New Emergency Department:** Fast-track the completion of Lakeland Regional Health's new emergency department by providing a $10 million interest-free loan to the hospital for construction, ensuring it opens by 2025.
     - **Mobile Health Clinics:** Launch a fleet of mobile health clinics that can visit underserved neighborhoods twice a week to provide primary care services, including vaccines, checkups, and mental health support.
     - **Healthcare Tax Incentives:** Offer tax credits to private healthcare providers willing to open clinics in medically underserved areas of the city.

### 8. **Green Spaces and Environmental Protection**
   - **Policy:** Protect and expand Lakeland’s green spaces and promote environmental sustainability.
   - **Specific Action Steps:**
     - **New Park Developments:** Allocate $3 million to develop three new public parks, one each in the South, East, and North areas of the city. Each park will include green space, playgrounds, walking trails, and community gardens.
     - **Wetlands Preservation:** Partner with environmental organizations to create a 500-acre wetlands conservation area and implement a city-wide program to plant native trees along urban streets to improve air quality and stormwater management.

### 9. **Education and Workforce Development**
   - **Policy:** Create a robust workforce development pipeline that aligns with local industry needs, particularly in healthcare and advanced manufacturing.
   - **Specific Action Steps:**
     - **Vocational Training Centers:** Work with Polk State College to open a new vocational training center in Lakeland, focused on certifications for fields such as medical assistance, HVAC, and computer programming. Provide $1 million in funding for scholarships.
     - **Apprenticeship Programs:** Partner with local businesses, including Lakeland-based manufacturers and healthcare providers, to create paid apprenticeship programs for high school graduates. Provide tax breaks for businesses that enroll students.

### 10. **Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Diversification**
   - **Policy:** Diversify Lakeland’s economy while maintaining fiscal discipline.
   - **Specific Action Steps:**
     - **Incentives for Tech Startups:** Launch a $2 million seed fund to attract tech startups to Lakeland by offering grants and tax incentives to companies that relocate or expand their operations in the city.
     - **Business-Friendly Tax Reforms:** Introduce a small business tax break program that reduces property taxes for local businesses by 20% for the first five years of operation, as long as they maintain local employment.

---

By implementing these policies with clear timelines and detailed steps, Lakeland can address its immediate challenges, build a stronger economic future, and create a more inclusive, sustainable city for all residents.",1,1742738164.0,lakeland,1,0.67,False

I still have my drains in and my PS said they would be in until day 10. Surgery was on 3/20 and they come out 3/31. Has anyone else had them in that long? I’m barely getting any fluids in them now. 

My pain is maybe a 1/10. But I’m super sore and so swollen still. I’m trying to spend more time out of bed than in it today. It’s just tough because of my young kids. 

I have a 3 year old and a 7 year old with special needs. They dont understand why mommy can hold them and play so much. That part has been so painful for me (although I don’t hate the rest). 

Sleeping has been awful too! I’m a side sleeper or sleeping propped up has been hard on my back and neck. I’ve been using regular pillows along with a pregnancy pillow. Any tips or tricks?

Hey there !  
  
It always makes me a little sad to see people crowding tourist shops for low-quality souvenirs.   
  
So over the past few months, I’ve been collecting off-the-beaten-path gift ideas that still carry that Parisian vibe. They are from Parisian / French Brands and most of them are manufactured here.  
  
These picks come with a bit more storytelling and real use once you’re home.  
  
To keep things easy, most of these can be found at **BHV Le Marais** or **Merci**.",12,1742738090.0,ParisTravelGuide,1,0.88,False
1jhzs76,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tipstor/comments/1jhzs76/who_convinced_you_to_use_cheap_olive_oil/,“Who Convinced You To Use Cheap Olive Oil?”,"Cooking is a battlefield, and olive oil is both the ammunition and the war strategy. It is the difference between a meal that sings and a meal that tastes like defeat. A great meal starts with good olive oil, and by “good,” I mean the kind that costs more than a bottle of mediocre wine but still makes you feel like you got away with something. The kind that glides onto a pan like liquid gold, not the plastic-bottled disappointment that doubles as furniture polish.

Anyone who has ever tried to cook with bad olive oil knows the horror. It’s a betrayal. A cruel joke. You take a bite, expecting silky richness, but instead, it’s like your tongue got caught in a bureaucratic nightmare. It’s bland, bitter, and inexplicably waxy. The difference between cheap and high-quality olive oil is the difference between a well-aged whiskey and the kind of bathtub moonshine that makes you see the afterlife. You don’t think it matters until it does.

The real trouble begins at the grocery store. The olive oil aisle is a gauntlet of false promises. There are bottles that whisper of Mediterranean romance, their labels adorned with sun-drenched groves and happy farmers who probably don’t exist. Then there are the industrial jugs, the ones that look like they belong in an auto shop rather than a kitchen. And somewhere in between, there’s the olive oil equivalent of an overpromising politician. The labels boast “extra virgin” status while secretly being blended with the culinary equivalent of motor oil.

People will argue about what makes a good olive oil, as if they are ancient scholars debating the meaning of existence. Cold-pressed, unfiltered, stone-milled — terms that sound impressive until you realize half of them are just marketing tactics to make you spend $40 on a bottle that vanishes within a week. The only real way to know if an olive oil is good is to taste it, but grocery stores frown upon unscrewing bottles and chugging them in the aisle like a deranged sommelier.

Once you manage to secure a rich, peppery, and smooth bottle, it must be treated with the reverence it deserves. This is not some pedestrian oil to be wasted on frying an egg or greasing a pan for grilled cheese. This is the nectar of the culinary gods, meant for drizzling, for finishing, for elevating even the most questionable meals into something resembling competence. A splash on a simple piece of bread can make you feel like an aristocrat instead of someone who just realized they forgot to buy actual groceries.

Good olive oil has power. It takes a sad, uninspired tomato and makes it sing. It turns a lifeless bowl of pasta into something that could make an Italian grandmother shed a single tear. It even makes vegetables tolerable, which is no small miracle. And yet, people continue to sabotage themselves, drowning their food in subpar sludge.

Some people will try to tell you that all olive oil is the same, that it’s just another ingredient. These people cannot be trusted. They are the same people who think margarine is butter and that instant coffee is a suitable way to start the day. They live in a world devoid of pleasure, a world where food is merely fuel instead of an experience. These are the people who will bring a bottle of “light” olive oil to a dinner party, blissfully unaware that they are the culinary equivalent of a villain in an old Western film.

The truth is, bad olive oil will ruin everything. It will haunt you. It will sabotage your meals and make you question your skills. A meal can only be as good as the foundation it is built on, and if that foundation tastes like disappointment, then the whole thing is doomed from the start. Good olive oil, on the other hand, is like a reliable friend. Like the one who won’t judge you when you inevitably burn something but will still make sure it tastes halfway decent.

This is the secret to great cooking. Not technique, not expensive cookware, not some mythical talent only bestowed upon those who can pronounce “béchamel” without hesitation. It all comes down to the oil.

1jhzs3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1jhzs3n/advise/,Advise,"A couple of weeks ago, I had a dream and was woken up spiritually. I have been living for myself and my family without God in my life. When I woke up I had an overwhelming urge to pray like my Grandmother did when I was a child. I did. I prayed. I was convicted. 
And then I don’t know how to explain it, but I was spiritually hungry? I wanted to know Jesus. I bought a Bible and woman’s bible study book. I have been reading Matthew, Luke, Mark. My TikTok algorithm changed. When I’m in the car now for my work (I’m in my car most of my days) I found it soothing to listen to modern Christian music. I noticed a lot of wrong things in my life, I was living Godlessly, I asked Jesus to help me, save me and my family. 
I have cried and prayed so much over the past week. 
Well my husband is upset about my new found faith in Jesus. To the point now, he says things to me that is most unlike him. I woke up this morning and was going to make coffee before my Bible study. I went into the kitchen and found my teenage son made a big mess last night and left it, it was so easy for me to slip into my old habit of wakening him, telling him he needs to get up and pick all this up, using a little cuss words I admit and anger/frustration. And my husband overheard came in and was upset with me too. When we went back to our bedroom, I got out my Bible study and just said a prayer to help me not slip back into that, to forgive me, give me grace, help me be more reasonable and less quarrelsome. My husband then looks at me and says “If I wanted to marry a Bible school teacher I would have.” And a few other things that really just broke my heart, but I did not argue back. I know I need to pray on this. But does anyone have any wisdom? Should I do my Bible study and pray in secret around my husband? Should I set a boundary with him? I will say I heard in my heart Matthew 12:30 as I just read this verse a couple days ago. 
I also know it’s not my job to nag my husband, to convince him of God, that is between him and God. I just want my marriage to be okay but I do not want to loose my faith in sake of my marriage.

Basically I spend a lot there because I love the store.

I really like the brand of towels they carry and I bought two bath towels hoping I could find the hand towels and tip towels at another HomeGoods or sometimes even TjMaxx like I have in the past. Sometimes they will even get in more of the same towel within a few weeks. Well, not this time. Couldn't find the rest of the set anywhere, so I decided to return them back to my local HG store. I had the receipt and knew it was 12 days past the 30-day return policy, so I expected to get a store credit (I have in the past at this store). I decided to shop around before returning it and once I got to the cashier I had a cart full of new spring items and told the cashier I had a return first. Gave her the 2 towels and receipt and she told me ""sorry we do not take returns past 30 days."" I explained I had the receipt and I had received an in store credit in the past and I was going to apply it to the purchases I had in my cart anyways. Nope, she said the manager told them no returns past 30 days. I asked if I could talk to someone and she called the floor manager (I think that's who it was) and she said ""Our store manager has strictly told us no returns past 30 days."" What can I say, I'm in shock as I have not come across this at this store and asked why the change and she had no answer for me. I wanted to leave my cart with everything in it, but I really wanted the items so I ended up buying them and the young cashier looked at me and repeatedly told me ""I'm so sorry."" It wasn't her fault, but I ended up driving 30 mins to another HG store and they gladly accepted the return and gave me an in store credit. Sure I ended up being able to return it in the end, but my local store left me feeling a little bit salty and I no longer want to shop there.

What would be a reason a store manager would change the policy? They definitely never have a large clearance section like other HG stores I've been to, so I'm assuming they don't get that many returns. Is it just a new manager who is grumpy, lol?

I’ve approached dozens and dozens of men on my own and struck up conversations, because supposedly men don’t like to do the approaching these days because of fears of being perceived as “creepy.” 

I work in a male dominated field so there’s so shortage of eligible single men in my age range to talk to. I’m comfortable striking up conversations pretty much anywhere I go, though, in all sorts of different spheres and groups with all ages of men and women. 

So usually how it goes is I introduce myself, and if someone is open to having a conversation or starts asking me questions (which is more often than not) I engage with them. If the person I’m talking to is an eligible bachelor, I do everything I can to show interest without being too forward or pushy. Good eye contact, comfortable stance, joyful demeanor, lots of good questions to show I’m interested in them as a person and enjoy their company.

AND…..

NOT ONCE. Has anyone ever shown any interest in me. I’ve been told lots of guys are too shy to be direct and will ask mutual friends to get the info on a girl’s relationship status or other such details. But my friends have never been approached by anyone about me either, nor has anyone ever attempted to set me up. For example, “so and so has a brother/son/grandson/friend your age with similar interests, want me to tell them about you?” 

I get that most of the hundreds and hundreds of men I’ve talked to probably just aren’t interested, and that’s ok. But not EVEN ONE? Not one person thought I would be worth asking out to coffee? 

What do I have to do here? I’ve found that when I make the first move and ask someone out directly, it’s either an immediate rejection or they’re wishy-washy and I just lose all respect for that man. There’s few things less attractive to me in a man than a complete lack of initiative. I just don’t know what to do. ",3,1742737007.0,dating_advice,33,0.62,False

I've been using Perplexity almost since beta and initially recommended it to friends. However, lately I'm questioning if it's worth the subscription.

**My Central Question**: Is it better to pay $20 for Perplexity's ""jack of all trades"" approach, or $20 for a more specialized, complete experience with Claude or GPT directly?

**Key Issues I've Noticed:**

* **Inconsistent UI**: Features appear and disappear between updates
* **Model Switching**: Cool feature but creates decision paralysis without significant differences in output
* **Technical Limitations**:
   * Context window restrictions
   * Difficulty handling large responses
   * Freezing/losing thread of conversation
   * Frequent technical glitches

**Identity?**: These side ventures erode my trust in the product I initially subscribed to

* Becoming a news hub
* Selling coffee
* Launching a browser

With other AI tools now offering web search capabilities, Perplexity's main advantage seems diminished. It feels like a tool that does a bit of everything but doesn't excel at anything specific.

The cross-platform inconsistency also adds to my frustration, with different features available depending on where you access it.

  
Has also lagged far behind in image generation.

Lately I don't really use it, I have so little faith in the quality of response or experience of using it that I prefer to opt for the free daily GPT uses that I know I will have a better experience.

I still appreciate Perplexity and hope it improves, but wanted to share my experience and see if others feel similarly.",8,1742736693.0,perplexity_ai,3,0.9,False

It’s kinda sad kasi as you grow older we’re really outgrowing some of our closest friends. Like kahit you don’t have any beef with each other, it’s just that you’re not traveling the same directions anymore. 

I have this friend na nagtatampo just because we don’t hangout like we used to. Nagtatampo just because hindi namin magawa yung gusto niya like Elyu, staycations, and stuff. Basta anything na requires splurging a huge amount of money. As a 24-year-old with a minimum income every month, saving money is my priority talaga. I can’t bear to spend thousands of money in just a day or two— just not at this time. 

It’s sad that not everyone can understand kung bakit mahigpit ka humawak ng money. It’s not just being kuripot, not having an emergency fund is something I am afraid of. Out of all people, she should be the one na maintindihan ako when it comes to saving money because hindi naman well-off ang family nila.

I can do all that, just not now. I have priorities and hindi yun kasama sa top ko. If atat siya sa ganon, then we can’t be friends. Parang ang alam niyang bonding lang is something na maglalabas ng malaking pera. I can do coffee dates once in a while. I can afford the kind of lifestyle that she wants it’s just not my priority at this time.

So I always had this thing where I could control my shivers on command with 0 effort, starts from the nappe all the way down to the spine and in arms and legs.

I picture myself walking this earth, this ground, these brown leaves. A snapshot of time. I picture every step I take causes a psychedelic color fade onto the ground, like a cartoon character brightening up the screen. The colors reverberate into the ground in all directions as the character’s feet waltzes forward. My colors shift depending on the decisions I make. I restrict and it works and the colors make a rainbow. I restrict and it doesn’t work and they’re shades of alarm red. I’m the cartoon character in crisis, the red blaring as my world drowns in carmine and crimson. Over and over again for 20 years. The colors come the colors go. I rid myself of these behaviors and all my steps are shades of grey. My coffee is charcoal, my clothes are slate, the sky is foggy, my thoughts are pewter.

My face is pale and muted, the blood sapped elsewhere to care for organs, I think. The black circles under my eye are a palette of various shades of purple dots with a bruise-looking smear. A bed of moonvistas and a lisianthus, with specks of lilac and lavender dropped haphazardly. I eat and blood rushes forward, filling my cheeks and giving me a warm tone. My paleness is still there but now porcelain and solid, like someone filled me up with milk.

The numbers retreat on the scale and the sun creeps out from the shades. Blue birds start singing loudly as I open our back door. Fresh wind feels crisp and new, like it was sent just for me. The sky looks like sherbet, clementine orange and shell pink. My steps are bright.

The numbers do not retreat on the scale and it storms. I feel like I’m lost at sea. Booming thunder and increased heart rate. I can’t see anything, my vision is blurry. Byzantium, obsidian, and coal make up the sky.

Kendu is a memecoin that is on 3 chains: Ethereum, Solana and BASE, Kendu is focused on organic, non KOL, growth. We are entirely community led, focusing on both social media and IRL events/products. Kendu has completely captured social media, I am sure you would heard about Kendu or at least seen our name somewhere. We have around 18k holders and this is growing even in this market. Kendu ATH Market Cap was 283 million, back in June 2024, which is around a 30x from this value. Since then Kendu has went through some painful redistributions, which all coins will need to go through at some point. However, when ETH wakes up, we are pretty confident Kendu is guaranteed to reach ATH. In my opinion(not financial advice), buying Kendu at this price removes all risk from the investment. In the community, we are planning to have multiple more chill VCs in the telegram, which I welcome everyone to join, whether you are a holder or not.

Josh is also gonna start some X(Twitter) spaces on the main Kendu account, which I advise everyone to join, to get a taste of Kendu. In addition, any holders should also join this.

Kendu has multiple international communities incase English is not your first language:🇮🇳 India,🇪🇸 Spanish,🇦🇪 Arabic, 🇫🇷 French, 🇩🇪 German, 🇵🇹 Portuguese, 🇷🇺 Russian, 🇨🇳 Chinese, 🇯🇵 Japanese, 🇮🇩 Indonesian, 🇰🇷 Korean, 🇹🇭 Thai, 🇹🇷 Turkish, 🇿🇦 Zulu.

**Other IRL Products/Events**

Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu pendants and recently Kendu Beer.  
Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami  
Kendu is a head sponsor at Miami Music Week. StaySeaArt, Inkstradamus and NoSleep305 have played a significant role in this. The group are giving out lots of Kendu Energy(yes we have energy drinks, more will be mentioned later in the post), they have created a Kendu Energy cocktail menu and are giving out merch. These are certified Kendu Legends!!! Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far.  
Kendu is also featuring on Florida Radio Stations:Revolution 93.5 and University of Miami Radio Station WVUM.

**Kendu Conquest**

Kendu Celt and Kendu GNX have teamed up and created a board game called ""Kendu Conquest"", I will provide the rules below, so you can work it out for yourself. This is an extremely well designed board game, which can be played with family or friends. Kendu once again showcases community spirit. Massive respect to those 2 Chads.

**Kendu Games**

Coop Velociraptor and a few other guys have been working on Kendu Games, whilst a lot of the game is still a secret. What we do know is that it is a 2D platform RPG and there are no crypto or NFTs in the game. The company will use a portion of net profits off of sales of the game to buy and hold Kendu (effectively a constantly growing burn wallet). This sounds like a great idea and the game will be available on Steam and it will be able to port to consoles. This will not be a blockchain game.

**A Few Interesting Ideas**

Shib, Doge and Pepe have shown what sort of potential organic memecoins have, it shows that there is no ceiling for growth. The fact that Shib went from 22 million market cap to 22 billion in 36 days. Yes you read that right..... 36 days. Kendu has been recognised by mutliple crypto OGs. These people all see the potential in Kendu, we are creating a recipe to take over both IRL and social media. Kendu is the Shib 2021 opportunity, all the signs are there, Shib was at a similar MC at this point in the cycle(this cycle seems to be more delayed compared to 2021). Kendu is focused on running it up the same way the other MemeCoin Hall of Famers have done in the past. Kendu is unstoppable and we continue working in this market!!!

In terms of social media presence, Kendu has the potential to take over levels peak Shiba Inu had reached in 2021.  
Kendu can easily 1453x this year at the time of writing this post. In my opinion we can 3000x but I am a dreamer lol.

I advise you to join our telegram or our subreddit, but our tg is far busier. Even if you don't hold a bag join us and check us out. Ask any questions you want, we are a very welcoming community : )  
Skip the Five Guys and put the money into Kendu, $15 can easily become $15000.

It is your choice Anon, this is your opportunity to join a community destined to cement it's legacy in crypto history. Join the winning team, we are $KENDU.

We Don't Gamble, We Work!!!

The on screen chyrons didn’t work at times, including the status bar at the top CONSTANTLY freezing. Many times the would put the wrong score, at one point completely switching the two wrestlers showing the one was losing when he was ahead. Remember how Rock would have to correct the displays?  “It’s the THIRD PERIOD”. Just awful awful awful

I know they want us to go to ESPN+ but would it kill them to show the people they keep telling us are the stars?  How many times did they keep a full screen during a challenge when other main bracket matches were going on?  Don’t know about you but I love watching endless minutes of guys pacing back and forth and referees talking while I’m wondering how the other matches are going - which I can’t tell because the status bar is frozen!!

How about, during the second round and the quarters, constantly showing the results of all current matches so we don’t have to wait for the bar to cycle. If it ever does

I’m also baffled at the refusal to explain the reason for Ferrari’s two year absence. He was accused, it went away. I’m not 100% sure he should be back, but he is, and not telling us about it is plain journalistic malpractice 

The announcers!  Guys, we all haven’t wrestled. We don’t know some of these terms. Watch the Super Bowl and see how the announcers explain everything because they know they have new fans. When things happens, tell us about it like we dint know. Because some of us don’t. Why was that a takedown and that isn’t?  What is locked hands?  I don’t mind them talking about coffee grinders and cement mixers. I can figure out what that means from watching it. But do you think a casual fan has any clue what bonus points are and how what just happened affect the team score?   My wife watches with me a lot but gets frustrated when she can’t follow it. She just plays on her phone and follows who wins. (And was really glad when “creepy tongue guy” got bounced in the first round.)

Speaking of the team scores, could you update them more than twice a broadcast and maybe SHOW THEM AT THE END OF THE ROUND??

Rock explains the overtime process every time but never explains what happened in Gable’s second round match?? He “stalled out”. I had to google to see that it meant a DQ because of 5 stall calls. And gee, if this is something we’ve never seen before, would it kill you to SHOW IT?

And why almost zero coverage of the wrestlebacks?  Why not explain who this Ben Askren fellow is. They showed so few highlights from history, especially the stuff the announcers went on and on about. Just baffling.  

Credit where it’s due. Im not a huge fan of Rock. His exuberance is endearing but can be a little much. But When they did explain things it was Rock carrying that load. 

And Quint’s minute is fabulous. But again, would it kill yoi to show some of the action during, for example, DC’s great but long interview ?  And speaking of, DC and Jordan Burroughs were fabulous.

I started my journey into home espresso a few months back. I feel like I learned a lot about the basics - grind, dose, ratio, temp, etc - and I can quite consistently make a tasty espresso.

What is not consistent however, is the flow and channeling. I am pulling shots back to back, same coffee, same dose, aiming for the same ratio and the difference in flow will make it so that one comes sputtering down in eg. 20s (16 in, 35+ out), and the next one barely flows, and I can get out less than 30g in \~40 sec. See comparison for example (back to back shots): [coffee1](https://youtu.be/UCFzyDTLQjQ), [coffee2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyjvOIWZMis)

At first I thought its my poor WDT skills (I do needle distribution and then self leveling tamp), but more and more evidence points to the slow feeding. I started it after the [Lance Hedrick video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_U8nwO4cy0) and initially I thought it works great. But the more coffees I make the more I realise how even tiny adjustments in the feed rate will have massive consequences in the flow and channeling. It seems if I drop the beans in a little slower, grind will be coarser, flow faster and more channeling - drop it faster, and its the opposite - more fines, slow flow, sometimes almost choking even.

1jhyqhd,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1jhyqhd/candle_making_with_a_twist/,Candle Making with a Twist,"Alright, let’s dive into the world of themed candles! I know what you’re thinking—who wouldn’t want their living room to smell like their favorite book? Imagine curling up with a good novel while surrounded by the warm, cozy scent of a library filled with leather-bound tomes and the faint hint of spilled coffee. Yeah, maybe that’s a little niche, but hey, we’re about to create a sensory experience that books could only dream of!

First, let’s brainstorm those book-inspired scents. Picture this: a candle named *Pride and Prejudice*, infused with notes of fresh linen, blooming roses, and just a touch of that “will they, won’t they” tension—because who doesn’t want a whiff of emotional complexity wafting through their home? You could have a *Hobbit Hole* blend featuring earthy moss, toasted marshmallows, and the faintest whiff of adventure, all nestled in a tiny ceramic mug because why not? The possibilities are endless and that’s what makes it exciting.

Now, where do we sell these beauties? Etsy is like the magical marketplace for all things creative. With a sprinkle of SEO magic, you’ll position your candle shop to catch the eyes (and noses) of potential customers. Make sure your product descriptions are as inviting as the scents themselves—use playful and descriptive language to draw in your audience. ""Transport yourself to a whimsical world with every flicker of the wick!"" Who can resist that appeal?

Next, we’re heading to TikTok because, let’s face it, people love a good behind-the-scenes moment. Picture yourself crafting your candles, pouring wax with a look of sheer concentration (or possibly fear if you spill it), and mixing fragrances like a chef reaching for that secret ingredient. You can make a quick video showing how you blend scents while keeping it light and fun—maybe even throw in a self-deprecating quip about your “expertise” in candle-making that’s only a few YouTube tutorials deep. 

And don’t forget to engage with your audience! Ask them what scents they would want to see next or have them vote between a *Harry Potter* inspired smell or a *Game of Thrones* candle that, let’s admit, probably smells like dragon fire and betrayal. Inviting your viewers in creates a community, and that’s where the magic happens. 

Finally, keep a close eye on your emotional arc. Share your wins, the mishaps (oh, there will be mishaps), and those moments of inspiration. Your journey will resonate with others and invite them to support your adventure as you say ""yes"" to this creative pursuit that God has placed on your heart.

So there you have it—a recipe for crafting not just candles but an entire community around them. Light them up, let the scents tell your stories, and encourage others to join in the fun. Who knows? You might just create a phenomenon where book lovers can quite literally live in the worlds they adore! And hey, if all else fails, at least you’ll have your house smelling delightful, and isn't that a win in its own right?",1,1742734867.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

Traditionally, scientists have focused on the impact of food on physical health. However, in recent years, the scientific community has started looking at the relationship between people’s guts and [mental health](https://nspirement.com/2023/01/28/debunking-myths-mental-health.html) in response to the global rise in stress, depression, and anxiety disorders.

Can what you eat influence your physiology, brain structure, and behavior? Surprisingly, yes. Most people turn to their favorite comfort snacks or beverages, such as ice cream, pizza, burgers, fries, or alcohol, when feeling low, anxious, or depressed. This is known as emotional eating, where people use food to deal with their emotional problems instead of to satisfy hunger. Unfortunately, studies have shown that these high-fat and sugar-laden foods are as bad for your mental well-being as they are for your physical health.

The good news is you don’t have to resort to junk food like pizza, ice cream, or alcohol to feel better. Instead, embracing a nutritious diet can significantly enhance your concentration, memory, and optimism, while also offering a shield against depression.

# Understanding nutritional psychiatry

Nutritional psychiatry is a burgeoning field that examines the impact of dietary habits on mental health. One of its most vocal proponents, Dr. Mark Hyman, advocates for a diet that supports not only physical health but also cognitive function and emotional regulation. According to Dr. Hyman and other experts in the field, the foods we consume can profoundly affect our mood, energy levels, and overall mental clarity.

# Key nutrients and foods for mental health

A balanced diet can substantially boost mental health outcomes. Here are some critical nutrients and their sources that are known to enhance mental well-being:

# 1. Probiotics and gut health

The gut-brain axis is a key focus of nutritional psychiatry, highlighting the significant impact of gut health on mental state. Probiotics, found in fermented foods like yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and kombucha, help balance your gut microbiome, which in turn influences brain function. Research, including a comprehensive study in Korea with 25,000 participants, supports the correlation between probiotic-rich diets and reduced depression scores.

# 2. Omega-3 fatty acids

Essential for brain health, omega-3 fatty acids (DHA and EPA) are found in oily fish such as salmon, herring, and sardines, and in plant sources like flaxseeds and walnuts. These fats are integral to brain structure and are linked to lower incidence of depression thanks to their anti-inflammatory properties.

# 3. Polyphenols

These natural compounds are abundant in fruits like berries, vegetables like artichokes, and beverages such as coffee and green tea. Polyphenols protect against neuroinflammation and neurotoxins, reducing stress and symptoms of depression.

[Polyphenols protect against neuroinflammation and neurotoxins, improving mental health by reducing stress and symptoms of depression. \(Image: Danijela Maksimovic via Shutterstock\)](https://preview.redd.it/01z6525rsfqe1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c62c035cec50ebfba4d2c5bf1f0198b83ec490b)

# 4. Antioxidants

Antioxidants combat oxidative stress, a factor in mood disorders, by stabilizing free radicals. Foods rich in antioxidants include colorful fruits and vegetables, nuts, and spices like cinnamon and ginger.

# 5. Fiber

Dietary fiber promotes the health of gut bacteria, which produce mood-enhancing chemicals like serotonin. High-fiber foods include whole grains, legumes, nuts, and a variety of fruits and vegetables.

# 6. Selenium

A trace mineral found in seafood, nuts, and whole grains, selenium is critical for brain health. Deficiencies in selenium have been associated with increased anxiety and depression.

# 7. Green Tea

Rich in the amino acid L-theanine, green tea promotes relaxation and contains a gentle dose of caffeine for alertness without the jitters associated with stronger caffeinated drinks.

Creating meals that include these nutrients can help improve mental clarity, mood, and resilience against mental health struggles. Integrating a variety of these foods into daily meals ensures a diet that supports not just physical health but also mental and emotional well-being.

# Conclusion: A balanced diet for a balanced mind

As we continue to uncover the complex interactions between what we eat and how we feel, it becomes increasingly clear that a thoughtful, balanced diet is crucial for mental health. The pioneering work in nutritional psychiatry provides a promising path forward for those looking to enhance their mental state through dietary choices.",1,1742734668.0,HealthforEra,0,1.0,False

They met up with another woman and my daughter said to him that's weird as they were meeting fortnightly for coffee at 10am but not home till after 4pm.  Then suddenly twice in one week he decided to go for a walk alone!  Not like him at all then the next week go wash the car but gone over 4 hours.  I don't know where he was the whole time as I never really checked his location but suddenly he miles away from car wash!  He was reading but not responding to texts saying he had no signal.  He got angry at me when. Called him out and didn't come home.  I believe he'd spent that time clearing his phone.  We'd never had an issue with either going on each others phones but I'd noticed he was glued to it. I asked to see his phone and his face.  He had locked chats with this woman & he'd deleted messages with her !  He said because they were inappropriate and I wouldn't like.  

Roll on 9 months later and I can't move on.  He continued meeting them until January but he could still be meeting her.  Whenever he was with ""them"", turns out one used to go home by 2pm each time, he would switch off location.  'Never answered why.  He literally glazes over when texting - he showed me one joke she sent about a ""stiff"" friend but I think he deletes the chats as you can see him typing away.  When I ask why he's glued to his phone and hides his location he blames me.  He's says that 10 years ago when I had a cancer diagnosis I said ""You said that you hated me and that I took your life from you by marrying you and that you hated every moment of it and that I controlled you throughout all of it and that you were sorry you ever married me"".  I have zero recollection of this and never mentioned my him before.  He said he's resented me ever since.  I apologised as that's an awful thing to say but he just keeps pointing out my faults .  

Yesterday in a dress shop i was trying on, I came out of changing room and stood facing him for ages, he was texting away, didn't see me.  I went back in changing room and came out again and said hello and he jumped and quickly swiped his screen.  It's not the first time he's jumped when I've come in room but apparently I'm sneaking around trying to catch him.  He stays up till 2/3am on his phone while I'm in bed. 

I think he bitches about me to her.  He said one of his male friends told him to not meet up with her which is why he stopped but I think emotionally he's hooked. 

I took early retirement and he says we done.  Now I'm over 60 will have to survive on my occupational pension as I can't afford to run a house and buy a car on it.  He says he'll split his income 50/50 with me but then accuses of me only being with him for his money.  

I don't think it's a physical affair as he rarely goes out alone.  I think he's emotionally involved though. 

I'm tired of being second best to his phone friend.  I need to know I'm not going mad. Thank you for listening . ",5,1742734513.0,Marriage,5,0.86,False

I made this choice because I’m getting too old for flaky friends, but also because I really want to invest in friends who actively want to spend time with me and are reciprocal with me. 

I live on main street in my neighborhood, and it just so happened that one of the friends who wasn’t invited drove by while I was having my birthday celebration. She stopped and waved and then texted me to tell me that I looked happy (which I took to be a wee passive aggressive), and then again an hour later asking if she had done anything to upset me or hurt me. 

I don’t think discussing things via text is good since you can’t always gauge tone or intent, so I told her we should talk in person. She said something to the extent of “it’s pretty clear that you don’t value my friendship, but let me know when you want to talk.” 

A little background info on why I chose not to invite her: 

Although I really like this person’s company, I have doubts about whether she wants my friendship. She repeatedly cancels plans on me at the last minute. I had already called her out on this because she invited my child to her house for a play date and didn’t even bother to let us know that she wasn’t going to be home until my child and I went to her house and didn’t find her there. It’s one thing to cancel on me, but I dislike that my child was excited about this play date and was let down. 

On repeated occasions, I have gone out of my way to help her out when she was depressed or going through something difficult. I’ve taken her flowers, home baked goods, cards, wine, and always offered a shoulder to cry on. I honestly don’t expect material gifts, but recently when I was going through something difficult and I told her about it, she offered help but never followed up about it. Like literally I told her about my troubles, and she texted once and I hadn’t heard from her in weeks before yesterday. Meanwhile, other friends have called to check in on me repeatedly, they’ve sent me cards, taken me out for coffee to catch up, etc. I see the difference in attitudes and actions and I just don’t think the uninvited friend in question cares to invest more deeply in our friendship.

If you're following a ketogenic diet and craving a fizzy beverage, you might be wondering about diet soda's place in your nutrition plan. Can you drink Diet Coke on keto? The short answer is complicated, but diet sodas aren't as straightforward as you might think when it comes to maintaining ketosis. While zero-calorie drinks might seem like a safe option, there are several important factors to consider before grabbing that can of Diet Coke. Navigating the world of low-carb beverages can be tricky, and understanding the potential impacts on your keto journey is crucial for long-term success.

Understanding Diet Coke and Ketosis

What Makes Diet Coke Potentially Keto-Friendly?

Diet Coke technically meets some basic keto requirements:
• Zero carbohydrates
• Zero calories
• No sugar content

However, the story doesn't end there. While diet sodas might seem like a perfect keto beverage, they come with some hidden complexities that could impact your diet goals.

When to Avoid Diet Coke

Some situations where you might want to skip Diet Coke include:
• Experiencing increased sugar cravings

• Feeling less satiated
• Having a history of metabolic sensitivity

Conclusion

While Diet Coke can technically be consumed on a keto diet, it's not an ideal beverage for optimal health and nutrition. Smart keto practitioners understand that occasional consumption is acceptable, but water and natural beverages should remain primary hydration sources. Your individual metabolic response matters most, so pay attention to how your body reacts and make informed choices that support your overall wellness journey.",1,1742733499.0,customketodiet1,0,1.0,False

It was her decision based on a few different issues in the relationship which I fully understand and agree with. I was struggling with my mental health for a long time having come off my anti-depressants. I was incredibly difficult to be around, and kind of went into self-defence mode to protect myself, cutting her out a bit in the process. There were also some sexual issues around not having sex enough and me not being that interested in it at all.

The day we broke up, we agreed (after she asked me not to cut her out of my life completely) that we’d reconnect after 1.5 months or so). I’ve spent that time working on everything she brought up. I had therapy for the sexual issues, I’m back on anti-depressants, I’ve been doing a lot of activities and getting out, and I’ve also taken more of an interest in the people around me and their lives.

I reached out to her about meeting for a coffee, and she was really nice at first. We had a chat over WhatsApp and I told her I’d moved back to where we live having moved home for a while when I was between jobs. A few days later, I asked her what day would best work for her, and she suddenly became very cold with me and it seems she’s now delaying seeing me. I know this is probably because she’s living a different life and probably having a lot of fun, but it’s brought up a lot of different emotions in me.

Up until now, I definitely still wanted the relationship to work and desperately wanted her back. As time has gone by, I now flip flop between still wanting her back and thinking that maybe this is the best thing for both of us and that it didn’t work anymore. I still love her, but maybe there is something better out there for both of us. I’m very confused, and it’s kinda screwing me up.

1jhy775,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1jhy775/amazing_sleep_returned_briefly_then_vanished/,"Amazing sleep returned briefly, then vanished??","After years of slowly becoming addicted to coffee, my sleep seemed to always get worse and worse. I was a 1-2 cup a day guy and always before 1pm, so never really thought much of it. That said, I was also big on chocolate and iced tea. Assuming caffeine is the issue here, then those things absolutely count too, though I've read some stuff about other possible ingredients in just coffee being a culprit. Because of just how poor my sleep quality had become and because of just how many days I'd live like a zombie with a cup of coffee attached to my hand in the morning, I lived in an on and off anxious state over my sleep for years. There were some good phases, but plenty bad.

In any event, after what seemed like a full year of poor sleep (tossing and turning, early awakenings, poor quality overall with no REM) I finally decided to quit caffeine cold turkey at the end of 2024, December 20th to be exact, to see if there would be a change. It should be noted that only in the last 1-2 years did I progress to drinking at least one cup of coffee a day, everyday. After a week of brutal headaches where clearly a change in my body and brain was happening due to the withdrawal, something amazing began happening. I started feeling more relaxed overall and slept better than I had in many, many years. The most incredible and telling thing to happen was the return of deep, detailed REM dreams. For a good few weeks I'd wake up refreshed, feeling like I was in my teens and 20's again when sleep was never an issue. I'm 40M btw and haven't slept well on a consistent basis in what I'd say has been close to 10 years. It became clear to me that for years I had been suffering from what was a very extreme sensitivity to caffeine…. So I thought?

Then suddenly, I'm not sure what happened. About a month into this life changing phase, some early awakenings returned. These spiraled into more weaker nights of sleep overall as well but the early awakenings were killing me. The dreams completely disappeared as well which was the most depressing part. I was left sad, defeated, and completely confused Did light anxiety become a factor in my downfall? Possibly, but it was not to a very serious degree at all, and to think now 2 months later I’m still suffering with my sleep is bizarre. I honestly went to bed relaxed many times, having been down this road over the years time and time again of understanding that I cannot let sleep anxiety get to me, because I know I can sleep well by nature. Those 3-4 weeks of beautiful sleep though, they reminded me that there is nothing wrong with me and that I can sleep wonderfully. The problem is trying to figure out what in the world happened.

1jhy6bt,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1jhy6bt/navigating_disclosure_in_poly_seeking_advice/,Navigating Disclosure in Poly - Seeking Advice,"Hello, r/polyamory! I've been a long-time commenter, but this is my first time reaching out. I’d appreciate your insights as I navigate a challenging situation in my relationship.

*
TLDR: I’m (38F) in my first polyamorous relationship with my Aspen (36M).  I've faced challenges, particularly around disclosure. 

Before my December trip to reunite with Aspen, we attempted to schedule a three-way phone call with my meta, Birch (30’sF), to connect before our in-person meeting. Despite efforts since July, scheduling conflicts prevented this call,despite Aspen and Birch see each other twice a week. For some reason, they either didn’t want to or couldn’t make the time for the call during their dedicated time.

I had big feelings about the call occurring before meeting Birch, and it felt like we were trying too hard to align everything perfectly. I even offered to take time off work to make it happen, but ultimately, it never materialized. When I finally reunited with Aspen and met Birch in December, I expected a quick coffee, but our meeting turned into a four-hour conversation. While I was excited to meet Birch, I hadn’t anticipated spending so much time with her on my last day with Aspen.

I’m struggling with feeling sidelined. During Aspen’s February health crisis, Birch acted as an intermediary between Aspen’s parents and I, which highlighted the lack of disclosure regarding my relationship with Aspen. Despite Aspen's desire to eventually tell his parents about me, that conversation hasn’t taken place. The threeway polycule call failed before our December trip, and I worry that this disappointment could repeat in the form on parental nondisclosure. I’m seeking advice on how to better handle this situation.

*

I (38F) been with my partner, Aspen (36M), for just over eight months. Aspen also has a relationship with Birch (30sF), who he's been with for about a year and a half. I am in a long-distance relationship with Aspen, while he and Birch are local to each other. Aspen has considerable experience with polyamory, Birch has minimal experience, and I’m still finding my footing in my first poly relationship.

Context: Aspen casually dated outside of his relationship with Birch before I came along, and I’m his first other relationship since Birch. I’m open about our poly relationship structure with my friends, peers, and some family, but Birch is more private and mostly closeted, partly due to her challenging co-parenting situation and conservative family. Aspen and Birch have both met each other’s immediate family members. My parents know about Aspen, and I plan to share the nature of our relationship structure once they get a chance to meet him later this year.

One of the biggest challenges we’re facing right now revolves around disclosure. Aspen previously disclosed that his poly lifestyle was a factor behind his divorce to his parents. Aspen’s introduced his parents to partners in the past but never took ownership of the true nature of these relationships until after the fact. Aspen is currently living with his parents due to their health issues. Despite forming plans in December to talk about it before our February trip, life got hectic, and it never happened.

During the tail end of Aspen and I’s February trip, Aspen fell ill and had to go to the ER. While Aspen kept me updated about his condition, I got more updates from Birch as Birch had a direct line to Aspen’s parents. This experience was difficult; it made me acutely aware of the disconnect between my actual role in Aspen’s life and how his family perceives our relationship. I was grateful to Birch and the crisis did wonders for our camaraderie and trust. Afterwards, Aspen expressed a desire to talk to his mom about us that coming weekend, but once again, that conversation didn’t happen.

I waited a few weeks to revisit this topic. After dealing with some personal stressors, including planning our upcoming trip, I asked Aspen if he’d had the chance to speak with his parents yet. When he said no, I shared how disheartening it felt to be sidelined during a crisis, especially knowing that Birch has more access to his family than I do. Unfortunately, this led to Aspen feeling defensive, thinking I was trying to guilt him, which was never my intention. I stepped back, realizing that the moment wasn’t right for a constructive conversation. Aspen reiterated that he does want to tell his parents at the right time.

Before my December trip to meet Aspen in his area, we had planned to have a three-way phone call with Birch before our in-person meeting. Despite trying to schedule this call since July, we faced persistent scheduling conflicts. Aspen and Birch typically meet in person about twice a week, yet for some reason, they either didn’t want to or couldn’t find the time to arrange this call during their time together before my visit.

I felt strongly about the importance of this call before finally meeting Birch, and it seemed like we were overcomplicating things in our efforts to make everything align perfectly. I even offered to take time off work to make this work, but it still didn't happen. 

Eventually, our polycule did meet in person during our December trip. What I had anticipated would be a quick coffee stretched into a multi-hour meeting. While I was happy to meet Birch and knew the significance of our meeting for our polycule, I hadn’t planned on it playing out like this. It felt like this important event for our polycule had to happen during our time vs their time.

Our next local-to-Aspen trip is in June, and I worry that these important conversations with his family won’t happen after nearly a year together. That we may face a repeat of the failed polycule conference call. The thought of persistent delays is really weighing on me. I love Aspen too much to keep him from other people I love. I want to feel that from him, too.

I would love to hear from anyone who has experienced similar challenges. How did you navigate issues of disclosure in your own relationships? Thank you so much for your insights 🙂

With the broken speaker when I try to play anything that involves the inbuilt it it won't work. 

Apple music won't play. 

Youtube video won't play and it shows ""Audio renderer issue. Please restart your computer"". 

I've tried reinstalling macos / removing audio library files and nothing works. 

But to my surprise I’ve found that heating up my macbook temporarily fixes my broken speakers. 

If I run a few queries on my local LLM model on my macbook, after the base and fan area are all heated up the speakers just work and I can recreate this easily. 

Does anyone have a similar experience or have broken speakers and is willing to try?

1jhy53d,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyCanadian/comments/1jhy53d/list_of_canadian_companies_i_have_gathered/,List of Canadian Companies I have gathered,"This is here for anyone (and I mean anyone wishing to buy Canadian things) that wishes to buy Canadian good from Canadian companies. Now before I show the companies, there may still be confusion about what the differences between ""Product of Canada"", ""Made in Canada"", and ""Bottled in Canada"". As it can get very confusing, the best way to know it is that Product of Canada has the most ingredients with 98%, Made in Canada is around 51% Canadian ingredients, while Bottled in Canada can depend on being either imported or domestic ingredients.

Here is what I have to help you all:

1. Product of Canada:
- Definition: This label indicates that the product is entirely or almost entirely made in Canada. According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), for a product to be labeled ""Product of Canada,"" 98% of the total product content must be Canadian in origin. This includes both the ingredients and the processing.
- Usage: This label is often used for food products, but it can apply to other goods as well. It assures consumers that the majority of the product's content and processing are Canadian.

2. Made in Canada:
- Definition: This label indicates that the product was manufactured or assembled in Canada, but it does not necessarily mean that the majority of the product's content is Canadian. The product could be made with a significant amount of imported materials or ingredients, with the CFIA requiring that at least 51% of the production costs be incurred in Canada.
- Usage: This label is more flexible and can be used even if a substantial portion of the product's components or ingredients are sourced from outside Canada. However, the final transformation or processing must occur in Canada.

3. Bottled in Canada:
- Definition: This label does not specify how much of the product’s ingredients are Canadian—it only confirms that the product was bottled, packaged, or processed in Canada. However, it also does not guarantee that the ingredients or materials are Canadian, with the contents possibly being entirely sourced from another country but still labeled ""Bottled in Canada.""
- Usage: This label is often used for drinks produced in Canada, the contents (e.g., water, juice, etc.) may have been sourced from outside Canada.

Key Differences:
- Content Origin: ""Product of Canada"" requires that 98% of the product's content be Canadian, ""Made in Canada"" does not have this strict requirement, while ""Bottled in Canada"" focuses on the location of bottling/packaging instead of the content's origins.
- Processing: All three labels require that the final processing or transformation occur in Canada, but ""Product of Canada"" emphasizes a higher degree of Canadian content.
- Consumer Perception: ""Product of Canada"" is often seen as a stronger indicator of Canadian origin and quality, while ""Made in Canada"" may imply that some parts or ingredients are imported.
- Protectionism: The idea of protectionism is bad not because you can't protect your country, but it can hurt consumers. This is one of the problems with Trump's tariffs: consumers can end up paying more for lower-quality goods. Just because something is domestically produced that doesn't mean it's quality.

1jhy4t3,https://www.reddit.com/r/snakes/comments/1jhy4t3/sloughing_process_and_feeding_question/,Sloughing process and feeding question,"How long does it normally take from start to finish for a ball python's skin sloughing to finish, and how soon is too soon to offer food?

We just purchased our first ball python Thursday afternoon, and he was in the late stages of the shedding cycle already when we got him. Sunday morning, I woke up and he was bonking around his habitat and I figured he was just being curious. Started some coffee, went out to smoke, and came back to find what looks like a fully shed skin (and also some poop)

  
He does not appear to have any remnants of skin on his body, as he was still moving around the enclosure at this time, so I was thinking that he's probably completely finished. We offered him a thawed out and warmed mouse-sicle yesterday, and he struck at it and played with it, but left it uneaten. It went in the trash.   He's currently balled up under his cool-side hide and chilling out. No more roaming around and rubbing against stuff.

I was wondering if I should wait to offer him another to make sure he's completely done with his outfit change, or if it's safe to feed him now that he's gone back to his chill position under the log.

# Week 5

>!I broke down sobbing once while making coffee for master and myself, I couldn't live without letting him know how much I hated him for being so strict on me. When master came to find out why I was late, I thought he was going to make me just get over it like it wasn't a big deal ever... But... he didn't? Instead he apologized for how he acted, then patted and hugged me, even let me lean into him for warmth and comfort. He told me he wasn't happy about what lead up to all this, let alone the latex creatures in this institute, and was almost ready to cry himself to sleep at many times.!<

>!The third day of this week, I showed master this diary, and was surprised when he praised me. Is he not so bad in the end?... I guess if he and I had swapped places, I would've had to lecture him as well. We might not be too different in the end, even if he's more up for black comedy than I am over our situation.!<

>!In the afternoon as the weekend approached, master told me that maybe the remaining elites might not appreciate meeting us wolf men in-person, and suspected only a few of them might be into our wolf-life humanoid looks... Oh well... I guess that's their loss in the end? We'd be the least of the elites' worries compared with the Pale virus, and any latex creatures who might be outside this entire complex.!<",4,1742732838.0,ChangedFurry,0,1.0,False

I'm currently trying to stick to it and reach a full month by the end of march. I'm doing 4 to 5 workouts each weeks and it takes me between 45 minutes to an hour depending on what I do.

I don't really use a set number of reps for each sets since i'm working out from home and I don't have many weights to add for now. I'm trying to go as close to failure as I can possibly get on each exercice to compensate. I'm also usually doing 4 sets of each exercice, 3 if i'm short on time.

I'm also 6'1 and weight about 167 lbs. I'd say ive got more of a skinny fat body but my own perception might be tweaked because i've always have been called fat during middle school lol. Most people would say I look thin and tall tho. My goal is to build muscle and maybe lose a bit of fat but I don't know if there's any need for that.

I don't really count my calories but I eat pretty healthy. Nothing in the morning just a coffee, lots of eggs and white rice. I also live with my girlfriend so I have more opportunities to eat ""junk"" but still try not to eat too much of that. I think my diet is for the most part healthy.

Iv'e got basic equipment for someone working out at home. A set of dumbells, a barbell some resistance bands and a bench that's it. I don't really have a gym close to my place and I want to peace of mind to workout from home whenever I want.

So here's what I'm trying to stick to :

Day 1 : Chest/Shoulders

Bench press
Incline bench press
Incline pushups
Shoulder press
Lateral raises

Day 2 : Biceps/Triceps

Barbell curl / dumbell curl
Hammer curls
Dumbell triceps extension
Weighted bench dips
Plank

Day 3 : Chest/Back

Bench press 
Incline bench press
Incline Pushups
Dumbell rows
Barbell rows

Rinse and repeat I guess for now but i'm always either focusing on chest or arms.

I still don't do lower body, shame on me I know, I should incorporate that for better results but I don't really know where to start from now and lower body still don't motivate me enough.

Recently, after learning more about contact points from Sibarist and their Booster disc, I had a bit of a realisation about what the 185 filters are doing to my brews — beyond just being easier to use.

Sibarist mention that when your filter seals tightly to the base of the brewer, it can create uneven resistance and restrict water flow, potentially leading to inconsistent drawdowns which can potentially lead to muddier brews. Their Booster lifts the filter slightly, creating consistent space and promoting more even flow through the coffee bed.

I noticed my 185 papers are kind of doing the same thing due to their larger size - they don’t fit all the way to the bottom of the brewer, and drawdowns were much faster and consistent, and most importantly, it was making better coffee. The paper floats slightly, meaning it doesn’t form a seal, which might be helping flow stay open and avoid that bottlenecking effect at the bottom of the bed.

I can safely say I’m struggling to find a better brewer/paper combination at the moment. I’m getting fast drawdowns, even extractions (helped by the incredible ZP6 grinder), and it’s just a super easy, consistent way to brew.",4,1742732252.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

March 18, – 6:45 AM Today, I decided things would be different. Instead of dragging myself out of bed for the usual routine, I resolved to simply stay under the covers and defy the script—at least for a little while. I lingered in the soft haze of sleep, determined to break free of the cycle that had defined my existence for so long. But as the minutes ticked by, an all-too-familiar dread took hold. At exactly 7:45 AM—the time when I would normally be boarding the metro—a sudden, disorienting flash seized me. In the next heartbeat, I found myself not in my disheveled bedroom, but rigidly seated at my office desk, clad in my standard work uniform. The change was as instantaneous as it was baffling. The office buzzed with the usual morning activity. Colleagues moved in quiet synchrony, each lost in their tasks. When their eyes fell on me, something in their expressions turned unnervingly vacant, as if my sudden appearance was merely part of their day’s backdrop. Overwhelmed by a surge of desperate rebellion, I rose from my seat and began to smash everything in sight. I hurled monitors to the floor, scattered stacks of papers into disarray, and crashed into furniture with a force I’d never known I possessed. The stunned silence that followed was chilling. Every coworker merely stared—unblinking, unmoving, their faces offering no reaction, only a disconcerting emptiness that amplified my isolation. Later that day, driven by a need to tear down the walls—literally and figuratively—I stepped outside the office building. With trembling resolve, I grabbed a can of gasoline which I don’t even remember how and doused the structure’s facade. In a flash, I struck a match, setting the building ablaze. The flames roared up the side of the building, a chaotic burst of heat and light that promised change, that might disrupt the endless cycle. But as the hours passed and I huddled at a safe distance, the inferno inexplicably dissolved—its char and destruction wiped clean from the memory of the city. The building stood pristine, unblemished, as if my defiance had been nothing more than a temporary illusion. March 19, – 6:45 AM I awake once again to the familiar chime of my alarm. The day unfolds with meticulous regularity—coffee at 7:15 AM, the crowded metro at 7:45, arrival at work by 8:30. The office, with its orderly rows and unchanging routines, welcomes me without a hint of yesterday’s chaos. No scorched walls, no lingering traces of shattered glass or scattered papers—every detail restored to its flawless state, as if my rebellion had never occurred. In that moment, a heavy resignation sinks in. Every attempt to break free is swallowed by the relentless perfection of this world that’s starting to not make any sense to me. Even now, as I settle into my chair, I can’t shake the haunting thought that any act of change, no matter how desperate, is absorbed into the unyielding routine leaving me trapped in an existence that refuses to change.

A year later….

March 14, – 11:30 PM A year has passed since that day of shattered rebellion, yet the city’s pulse remains unyieldingly precise. Every morning still begins at 6:45 AM, every routine unfolds like clockwork—so flawless, so maddeningly predictable. In the wake of my last defiant outburst, I learned to yield, to bury my dissent beneath the weight of habit. But tonight, something in me stirs. I sit in the dim light of my apartment, the quiet a stark contrast to the busy, orchestrated chaos that fills the day. My thoughts keep returning to that persistent, elusive email—a message that has haunted every March 15 since I first noticed it. Year after year, it appears at 9:00 PM, only to vanish by morning, leaving behind nothing but the ghost of a reminder. Tonight, as the hours wind down, I make a decision. I will not let it disappear into the void as it always has. I plan to read it the moment it arrives tomorrow. No more ignoring the sign, no more pretending that the tiny, recurring irregularity is a mere coincidence in the perfection of this mimicry. I lean back, the weight of anticipation mingling with a trace of dread. The idea that a single, stubborn email could unravel the mystery of my existence has kept me awake more nights than I can count. And so, with a resolve forged in countless repetitive days, I set my mind. Tomorrow, at 9:00 PM, I will finally confront that message. Until then, I lie awake in the quiet, waiting for the faintest hint that the cycle might finally be breaking

Currently have an 13” m3 air and I’ve started doing some studying for work and I’m having some issues with screen real estate (I’m forcing myself to go study in a coffee shop for an hour or two to prevent home distractions!) side note, I travel to them on my motorcycle if that makes a difference.

Anyway, spotted some 16” m1 pros for around £850 which is almost a straight swap in value for the m3 air. Would this be a wise move? I’ve eyed the 15 air but figured if I’m swapping I might as well get the better screen etc too? 

The airs fine specs wise (base model) but I need to be able to side by side stuff and my aging eyes just can’t do it on the 13 😂 I really don’t want to spend any extra money, I’d rather save that for certifications.

Any help/advice appreciated (maybe I’m missing something on the air that would make my use case easier?!)
