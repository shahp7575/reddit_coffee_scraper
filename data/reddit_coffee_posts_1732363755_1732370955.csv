Title: A small New York town played host to Hollywood. Then something terrible happened

Summary:  HBO’s alleged role in a raging fire on the set of its miniseries “I Know this Much is True,” starring Mark Ruffalo, still upsets residents of a small New York town (Ellenville) who say they’ve been neglected amid finger-pointing over the fire’s cause. 

Meg James, Senior Entertainment Writer
Nov. 19


ELLENVILLE, N.Y. — Hollywood came to town, bringing bright lights, movie stars and a glint of glory.

In the foothills of the Catskill Mountains, Ellenville residents were thrilled when HBO began filming a Mark Ruffalo television series, “I Know This Much Is True,"" in the village known in the region for its maximum-security state prison. A casting call for extras in nearby Poughkeepsie drew nearly 3,000. At Ellenville's hospital, doctors and nurses doubled as background actors.

A Main Street landmark was spiffed up to depict a 1990s-era car dealership with gleaming props — Chevrolet Camaros and Corvettes — on loan from car buffs throughout the state. Patriotic flags fluttered in the May breeze. 

But after a long day of filming, a small fire began kindling inside the dealership about 2½ hours after the last of HBO’s crew had left for the night.

“It happened so fast,” recalled George Budd, Ellenville’s assistant fire chief and the first firefighter on scene just before 1 a.m. “I can still see it to this day. I bent over to put my bunker pants on, I stood up … and every window in the place just blew out. Then it became a hell show.” 

The May 9, 2019, blaze tore through the nearly 12,000-square-foot structure, burned for more than 12 hours and resulted in an estimated $15 million in property damage. No one was injured, but the disaster sparked finger-pointing, lawsuits and questions about accountability that still divide the small community in the Hudson River Valley. 
Five and a half years later, many in Ellenville remain bitter over HBO's alleged role in the fire and its aftermath. Small communities roll out the red carpet for filmmakers, but there's not always a happy Hollywood ending.

Ulster County fire investigators wrote in a report that equipment used by HBO caused the electrical fire, which they said ignited after crew members left sound equipment batteries charging overnight in the car dealership showroom. However, HBO for years blamed others for the start of the fire, although it did reach several confidential settlements, according to a Times review of fire reports, court filings and more than two dozen interviews.

HBO has denied the allegations and said the damage was due to ""the negligence and/or culpable conduct of a third party"" over which they were not responsible. HBO blamed a faulty battery for causing the electrical fire. It sued the battery maker and settled the case earlier this year.

“HBO has been producing shows on location all around the globe for decades, always with the utmost care and respect for the local environment and community,"" the company said in a statement. ""It was no different for this series. The fire was an unforeseen accident, and it took time to investigate it thoroughly.""

Ellenville officials estimated the fire wiped out more than two dozen jobs in the village of nearly 4,200 people about 90 miles north of New York City. 

Two families — whose nearby mobile homes were damaged by the heat and the water used by firefighters — say they are still waiting for HBO to acknowledge their plight and are seeking compensation for their alleged damages. They have remained in their unsafe structures, saying they have no place to go.

“When you buy a home, you have big plans to make things nice,” Pablo Ferrada Arias said one evening, as he stood outside his sage green and white trailer, its sides warped by the intense heat. “But they came to do the movie and destroyed everything.” 

Ellenville Police Chief Phil Mattracion said of HBO: “They moved on. 'Here today, gone tomorrow.' They have no vested interest in the town.”

For five months, a location scout had traveled New York's back roads, searching for a car lot with just the right look. 

“I saw it covered in snow, in the golden hour light, in all its 1950’s atomic era glory,” Sara Furey wrote in an Instagram post about her February 2019 discovery of the car dealership.

“It was a beautiful old historic Midcentury Modern building,” said Barbara Hoff, an Ellenville native who owns the local train depot and a vintage clothing and jewelry store. “It had been a car dealership forever — a landmark when you drove into town.""
Built in 1970, with glass walls and a semicircular showroom, the building was home to a Collier Motor Car dealership until 2009. But then General Motors slid into bankruptcy and abandoned franchise agreements, including in Ellenville. 

The property sat vacant for years, a reminder of hard times gripping America's rural communities. Eventually, it was turned into a used car lot. HBO paid the business owner, 613 Automotive Group, $107,000 so the network could use the dealership for the film shoot.

Eager for new industries, New York politicians have embraced generous cash rebates to attract filmmakers who can turn their cinematic lens on lush landscapes and quaint neighborhoods.

But there’s been a vigorous debate over New York's decision to steer $700 million a year to production companies. An audit in December found that taxpayers didn't get their money's worth — the state collected only 31 cents in tax benefit for every dollar it spent on rebates. Supporters of the film incentives try not to rock the boat and note the benefits to workers.

“We don't like the word ‘Hollywood’ because it creates this myth that doesn’t help people,” said Laurent Rejtö, founder of the Hudson Valley Film Commission. “Most of the people up here who work in the industry are blue-collar laborers.”

'This will happen': Mark Ruffalo moved mountains to make HBO's new Emmy hopeful
HBO’s production company, Calling Grace Productions, and the director of “I Know This Much Is True” hired local crews and extras for the nearly $90-million production that spent six months in 2019 filming throughout the Hudson River Valley.

HBO received a $24-million state tax credit for the project, according to its New York tax certificate (the credits cover up to 40% of qualified costs).

Those incentives helped bring Wally Lamb’s 1998 bestselling book to life. Previous producers and screenwriters tried and failed to pare Lamb’s 928-page novel into a movie about the dark and difficult lives of identical twins.

Ruffalo rescued the project, signing on as executive producer and star. HBO has long viewed Ruffalo (known to superhero fans as ""The Hulk"") as a marquee talent, and they agreed to make a six-part series. Ruffalo went on to win an Emmy Award in 2020 for his portrayal of both brothers: the hardened Dominick, who resents but also cherishes his softer twin, Thomas, who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia.
Ruffalo, during his acceptance speech, said the HBO series highlighted a larger question: “How are we going to deal and honor and take care of each other and our most vulnerable people?” Ruffalo asked as he clutched his gold statuette. ""We do that with love, we do that with compassion. ... If we have privilege, we have to fight for those who are less fortunate.”

Sixteen months earlier, Ruffalo and crew members had wrapped their second day of filming at Ellenville's dealership. Sound and location crew members were the last to leave, around 10 p.m.

After midnight, security guard Joseph Perrone sat alone in the parking lot in his Jeep Wrangler, listening to the radio while sipping coffee. HBO crew members told Perrone to prevent looky-loos from touching the props — 1990s-era Chevy muscle cars that ringed the dealership.

""What I heard was a 'pop.' I looked over my shoulder and seen an orange glow,"" Perrone said in an interview. ""From there it looked like fireballs flying from behind a desk and jumping onto a car. I don't mean like sparks, I mean full-on chunks of a flare.""

Perrone called 911. Firefighters were alerted at 12:56 a.m. Budd, the assistant fire chief, arrived within three minutes.

Three wailing sirens rousted Jessica Rios Rodriguez from bed. Her mobile home lies just steps away from the former dealership building. She and her partner rushed their daughter to safety and alerted their neighbor, Ferrada.

Firefighters raced to strap a hose on a hydrant but were foiled. ""The [expletive] hydrant won't open down here,"" bellowed one firefighter, according to a cellphone video.

Firefighters tried two other hydrants but encountered weak water pressure. Additional firefighters were summoned from two counties. Eventually tanker trucks rumbled to scoop water from a nearby pond. By this time, the fire had spread to the mechanics' shop in the back. There, dozens of 55-gallon drums were stored, several containing waste oil. 

As the oil ignited, huge explosions shook the site.

""Flames went 100 feet in the air, and I'm probably underestimating that,"" recalled Keith Hughes, a former Ulster County fire investigator. ""It was such a massive blaze.""
HBO-leased vehicles, including two rigs to power the set and film equipment, were parked in the back. They, too, caught fire. Rios' bedroom was less than 12 feet from one of the burning generator trucks.

Her partner, Daniel Perez, turned their garden hose on burning embers swirling around their home but a firefighter took it to try to quell the inferno next door. 

News of the fire quickly spread. Two friends, who'd loaned their classic Camaros to the production, made a beeline to Ellenville that morning.

""We pulled up and the fire was still going,"" said Kevin Leonard, who found his red Camaro IROC, which he'd first bought while in college, charred to a crisp. ""And there's some guy in a T-shirt just knocking down the building with an excavator. I was like: 'What the hell?'""

At 1:47 p.m. — 13 hours after it started — the fire was fully extinguished. 

Budd said he believes equipment brought in by HBO, including the generator truck, turned the fire into a fast-moving inferno. 

""It was crazy, just crazy, how fast the fire went through that building,"" he said.
Hughes and a fellow Ulster County fire investigator zeroed in on the sound mixer's equipment cart left in a corner of the showroom as the possible ""origin"" of the blaze. 
The cart had been loaded with sound electronics, battery charging stations, power strips, dozens of lithium ion batteries and coiled extension cords. It was parked a few feet from a pickup truck and a table with a space heater, coffee maker and Halloween decoration props, according to one investigator's report.

Remains of 75 lithium ion batteries were found amid the rubble. There were other flammables, too: aerosol cans with tips blown off and two scorched gallon-sized cans that were presumed to contain paint thinner or some other solvent used by HBO crews to decorate the showroom, the report said.

Hughes believes an HBO crew member left batteries charging overnight in a receptacle plugged into a wall outlet.

HBO crew members have testified they only used power from the generator truck, not from the dealership building, but Hughes points to a sizzled cord to counter that.
""They left the cart unattended, plugged in, charging batteries overnight,"" Hughes said in an interview, echoing deposition testimony he gave.

The material that sparked the blaze, fellow investigator David Thomas testified in a court deposition, was ""batteries and charging equipment, plugged into several power strips, plugged into an extension cord [that] was wrapped up on a cart ... plugged into the wall."" 

The county investigators reported the fire's cause as ""an unspecified electrical event,"" but in an interview Hughes said, ""It's HBO's fault, 100%."" 

HBO denies it was at fault. 

The New York company blamed a Torrance-based lithium ion battery company, whose lawyers pursued a theory that the blaze could have been intentionally set, court depositions show. There was no evidence of arson, the investigators said. 
Lawyer Wayne Lonstein, who has sued HBO on behalf of the families, suggested the fire may have been sparked by cigarettes Ruffalo was smoking for a scene several hours earlier, but HBO attorneys rejected the smoking conjecture, citing video of Ruffalo's smoking scenes. 

“The footage closest in time to when the fire occurred is still four and a half hours prior to the start of the fire,"" HBO lawyer Steven Montgomery wrote in a court filing. The judge denied Lonstein's efforts to target Ruffalo.

Security video from a nightclub across the highway showed the fire had burned undetected for at least eight minutes before Perrone discovered it, prompting an allegation by HBO's fire investigator that Perrone may have been sleeping on the job.
“Dude, that’s what the fire inspector that HBO hired told me,” location manager Stephen Grivno wrote a fellow crew member in a text message viewed by The Times. “But I don’t honestly know if he was like starting a rumor or what. .. It seemed like [the private investigator] was hired by HBO to cast suspicion on everybody else.""
Perrone has denied the allegations. 

""I'm nobody's scapegoat,"" Perrone said. ""I did nothing wrong, but some jerk decided to point a finger of speculation at me. From Day One, the finger pointing started — trying to avoid responsibility for the fire."" 

That summer, Perrone stopped getting security jobs.

The day after the fire, HBO's insurance adjuster clashed with village officials over the preservation of evidence.

HBO's adjuster, Crawford & Co., took Ellenville officials to task, saying they “observed individuals compromising the integrity of the fire scene... [including] a worker in an excavator destroying the particular area where the fire is believed to have originated by displacing debris,” according to Ellenville documents provided to The Times. 

Ellenville officials countered that they hadn't ordered heavy equipment but the building owner did, according to a witness statement included in an insurance company report. 

Then-building inspector Brian Schug responded that village personnel made ""every realistic effort"" to protect the public and firefighters.

HBO's ""carelessness destroyed a Village landmark and left nearly 30 people unemployed,"" he wrote in an email to Crawford & Co. and HBO's insurance company, Allianz.

Disputes over who was responsible delayed cleanup of a huge mound of fire debris fouled with toxic waste. 

""It's a very hard thing for a small community to have a trauma like that,"" said Steven L. Kelley, Ellenville Regional Hospital chief executive. ""And there was this pile of rubble still sitting there for about a year — reminding us how bad [the fire] was."" 

The debris pile — twisted metal, charred concrete, car frames and blown-out oil tanks — was a suspected source of toxins. The landowner installed a chain-link fence around it. Initially, the site was preserved for inspection by insurance experts. But in late 2019, Ellenville officials cited the property owner, 613 Automotive, for failing to clean up the pile, which contained ""oil, gasoline and asbestos"" and other contaminants, according to the citation.

Local politicians didn't help. A council meeting turned testy nine months after the fire when Lonstein and residents — including Rios and Ferrada — pleaded with village leaders to help resolve the potential health threat. That same month, contamination was still present on the site, according to a February 2020 New York spill report. 
A state inspector was called when an oil sheen developed in standing water after a heavy rain. 

Storm runoff drained down a shallow slope and into Rios’ backyard, the state report noted. It was possibly laced with toxic chemicals, including residue from the firefighting foam, which contains harmful chemicals known as PFAS (polyfluoroalkyl substances), the report said. After the fire, Rios said, her chickens died. So did the tree by their front door.

""Here you had a situation in which HBO turns its back on the owners of the property,” former Mayor Jeffrey Kaplan and an attorney for 613 Automotive said in defense of his client during the heated 2020 council meeting.

“The fire was devastating to Ellenville,” Rejtö, founder of the Hudson Valley Film Commission, said. “It created a lot of bickering and infighting between different people and the mayor — just the politics of it all.""

Rios' mobile home with baby blue siding had been her American dream. 
The 37-year-old Puerto Rico native worked two jobs, including as a teacher's assistant, to save money to buy the trailer for $20,000 in 2016 with her partner. The fire's intense heat melted and warped the siding and caused structural damage. Asphalt shingles liquefied, dripping tar stains down a back wall. Clothes, furniture and other possessions were ruined by the heavy smoke. 

Water firefighters sprayed over Rios' and Ferrada's homes caused further structural damage, and mold now seeps through the ceilings and walls, according to a negligence lawsuit the families filed against HBO.

In Ferrada's home, the ceiling sags, the walls buckle and floor vents are rusted. A portion of an exterior wall peeled away, and rooms tested positive for mold. He stretched thick plastic to seal off the worst bedroom, but the air is heavy, making it difficult to breathe inside.

Ferrada's daughter, who was 7 when the fire struck, used to live with him part time but developed asthma. Now, she stays with her mom.

He has a range of health issues, including high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, problems with his esophagus and depression. Blood tests have shown high levels of metals in his system.

“I’m tired — very tired,” Ferrada, a 46-year-old Chile native, said. “I lost too much here: I lost money, lost time with my daughter… I lost everything.”

A cardiologist expressed concern for Ferrada's health: ""Simply put you need to get out of there,"" Dr. Jack Wolfson wrote in an October report. ""It is more than dangerous, it's deadly. You are being poisoned.""

The former Ellenville building inspector, Schug, had issued a ""do not enter"" order for the dealership and homes. “They shouldn’t be there,” Schug said during the contentious 2020 council meeting, adding the homes were not “safe.”

The property owner, 613 Automotive, initiated eviction proceedings against the families after they stopped paying land rent after the fire because of the property damage and contaminants. The trailers (which the families own) are too old and damaged to be moved.

""We have no place to go,"" Rios said. 

Lonstein, a municipal judge and attorney whose family owns an office building south of the fire site, became involved soon after the fire when some of his employees complained of coughs and other ailments. He ordered environmental tests that showed the presence of asbestos, lead, barium and cadmium, among other toxins.
He became increasingly alarmed after seeing Ferrada's young daughter play in the snow near the debris pile months after the fire. As he dug into the case, he became angry after learning that the families had received no assistance.

""It comes down to this: If you hurt people, you take care of them,"" Lonstein said in an interview.

Trying to find a resolution more than a year after the fire, Lonstein reached out to then-state Sen. Jen Metzger, who champions environmental causes embraced by Ruffalo, who lives in a nearby county. 

Six months after the fire, Ruffalo had testified in Congress about the need to force companies to pay for health issues stemming from the spread of PFAS chemicals. 
Metzger traveled to Ellenville to meet with Ferrada and Rios in their blistered homes. The visit came a few days after Ruffalo won his Emmy for “I Know This Much Is True.""

Metzger had held a campaign fundraiser, headlined by Ruffalo, that month. He contributed $1,500, records show. She and her staff hoped they could enlist Ruffalo's help in getting HBO's attention.

“It’s a very bad situation,” Metzger wrote a few weeks later in an email sent to an environmental activist who works with Ruffalo. Metzger’s message summarized her and a staff member's visit to Ellenville.

""HBO, [alleged] perpetrators of the fire, left their mess for others to clean up,” Max Cordella, the staff member, wrote. The two families had young daughters and needed help, Cordella said, because ""their trailers are still not in livable condition but the families have no options so [they] remain.""

Cordella this month confirmed the Ruffalo outreach efforts. Metzger's staff first contacted HBO but network executives ""stopped responding,"" Cordella said. ""We were trying to help and thought that we may be able to get [the families' situation] on this sympathetic movie star's radar.""

""Nothing happened,"" Lonstein said. 

In an interview, Metzger — who now is Ulster County executive — expressed frustration at the ongoing plight of the families.

“The amount of money made off this film compared to the relative cost of doing the right thing is virtually meaningless to a company the size of HBO,"" Metzger said. ""People’s lives are at stake and that’s really all that matters.”

A representative for Ruffalo declined to comment. ""We empathize with anyone impacted and hope the matter resolves soon,” HBO said in its statement.
Several others who lost classic cars and equipment trucks said they struggled for months — and years — for compensation. 

""I never got reimbursed from HBO or Calling Grace,"" said Rich Shakerley, who lost his silver Camaro. He instead filed a claim against his own insurance policy. 
David Haddad, who owns a production equipment company, said he lost sleep for about a year amid his battle with HBO and its insurance company to cover the loss of his camera truck. ""HBO and their insurance provider went out of their way to handle this poorly,"" Haddad said. 

Calling Grace and its insurance company blamed Torrance-based IDX System Technology, which manufactured some of the lithium ion batteries, alleging the batteries malfunctioned — an allegation that IDX has denied.

Calling Grace sued IDX in 2021, saying it sustained losses of $1.9 million and its insurance policies had paid others ""in excess of $3.5 million for damages resulting from the fire."" 

Earlier this year, HBO and its insurance companies settled claims with various parties, including the property owner, 613 Automotive Group. 
HBO noted in its statement that the only remaining lawsuit is the one brought by the two families.

“All of this is a nightmare,” said Rios. “After the fire, people didn’t believe that we were living here — that we are still living here.”

In May 2022, Lonstein sued Ruffalo, HBO and 613 Automotive on behalf of the families seeking at least $2 million in damages. He also demanded that HBO provide a trust fund to cover their medical expenses for their ""increased risk of bodily injury due to this incident.” 

HBO's attorneys made settlement offers that were rejected by the families. The company is now seeking to dismiss the case, saying the ""plaintiffs have offered no proof that HBO and Calling Grace were responsible for exposing them to toxins that caused them damage.""

A trial has been scheduled for early next year. 

""They came here to film and everything was nice, but they didn't think about the consequences,"" Rios said in a recent interview. ""We are the consequences. HBO doesn't care, 613 Automotive doesn't care, Mark Ruffalo doesn't care, but this is about our health, our lives and our house. Somebody has to be responsible and that's why we are still fighting.""

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

I'm 33 live with my wife. Long story but we ended up buying a house next door to my parents (I was cheap for what it was and ticked more boxes than anything else). 

Before we moved in we talked about boundaries, which went down like a sack of shit. It would appear my mother has a total inability segregate a neighbourly relationship with a parental one.

During my childhood I felt smothered and did everything that was asked of me like a good little boy. I left school at 17 and bought a house at 22, earning a fair wage and finding I was extremely independent. Which I think my mum couldn't really bare.

Mum can be an oversharer, and can make inappropriate comments which I've always hated and put me on edge. Subsequently I am a very private person and keep myself to myself. This again feeds into the whole boundary thing.

During my early teens I was bullied pretty badly, but couldn't bare to confide in anyone, had the whole suicidal thoughts and dealt with crippling anxiety. I guess I now hold some resentment about this. I got myself out of this hole.

Most times I see my mum it blows up. A couple days ago I get home from work, cooking tea. Door bell goes, 'can I come in'. Comes charging in with loads of baby clothes and items (wife is due). This instantly gets my back up but okay just be civil. She then goes and does 4 trips between the houses bringing more and more stuff. Some of which we've already said we don't want. It's somewhat overwhelming with her going through each individual item. (I can tell the difference between a bib and some socks).

The conversation briefly moves onto work, I occasionally work away,, I may have to work away for a week in December. And I had previously told her there is a fair bit of work on in January, but I wouldn't be going due to being 4 weeks prior to due date. She then proceeds to tell me I shouldn't work away in January, I begin to get agitated but agree and acknowledge the point. She then begins labouring the point, repeating herself. At which point I am triggered and simply say 'do you think I'm stupid'. She then storms off in a huff.

I now feel hugely guilty, she thinks I'm an ungrateful, aggressive twat. I have the feelings of anxiety and dread, I end up replaying the scenario over and over. 

I definitely feel there are two sides to a coin and her optics are clearly different to mine. But I also feel she has no ability to view these situations with pragmatism and ask herself why I've responded in such a way. She is so intense.

This kind of scenario has happened multiple times. Ruining the run up to our wedding, moaning we weren't inviting her siblings (who she doesn't even like), and guilt tripping about a bit of cash she had given us toward the wedding. I responded that if the money came with conditions they can have it back. And then my father telling me he'd be wearing jeans to the wedding. All very petty stuff, but it builds into the bigger picture.

I feel that in the run up to the little one arriving this is happening again, either being consciously or subconsciously overbearing. Not respecting boundaries and then getting annoyed when I'm triggered. I appreciate being triggered isn't very rational, but I feel I am a product of my upbringing. Which neither of them seem to be able to understand.

It's all very complex, and it intertwined with her mother, mental health issues ect. I feel this is so complex it cannot really be unpicked.  I have had frank conversations before, but basically was told I shouldn't feel how I did (basically being gaslit). It was only weeks after mother did speak to the wife and said she needed to respect my feelings. 

I've since had a brief conversation with dad who basically has only heard one side of a story and said mum is looking to move. I feel I'm am being emotionally manipulated and made to feel awful. We are hardly terrible neighbours, we are quiet and respectful. I feel they are conflicted and cannot establish boundaries. Invite us over for tea as a son and daughter in law, great. But I don't need the door bell going and inviting yourself in all the time. You wouldn't do that with a neighbour. We both work fairly intense jobs  and need to decompress. Whereas mother has only really worked part time, and has been retired for years I'm am not sure she understands. A quick text or phone call arranging coffee in either property would be lovely (and gives a bit of time to mentally prepare), but it doesn't happen. We just get accosted and she then gets a cagey response.

Sorry for the complicated mess of an essay. I just don't really know how to continue. Should I just readdress all these issues and hope there is an element of self reflection?

Thankfully my wife is extremely supportive and trys to help me understand if I am being reasonable or not.",1,1732370101.0,toxicparents,0,1.0,False

So I am really struggling with my gerd. I was experiencing serious symtoms on an off in 2023 and now it's gone full blown since the start of 2024. I've had a CT scan done and barium swallow and so far no hiatal hernia from what they can see. Endoscopy (with colonoscopy)  is coming at some point in the coming months. Everything I eat is causing problems. This sub made me terrified of PPIs. Completely.  I was trying famotidine but it's really a chore to keep up with and timing. Putting so much effort into everything I'm eating is so difficult.  And every time when I eat things, even if they are gerd safe I suffer. I feel like my LES is weak and my stress and anxiety are making it even worse. I just picked up some nexium to try as omeprazole makes me feel like garbage. I need relief, I need to feel somewhat normal. My anxiety, stress, and GERD have resulted in me having CRIPPLING food anxiety. To the point where I have dropped 13 pounds in about a month. I just want to feel normal again. I miss my life before this started happening. I took every meal and snack for granted. I don't think I'm getting nighttime reflux but the postparandial reflux and heartburn are defeating me, one meal at a time 😭 I almost wish I could stop eating Completely for a few months just to heal and try to strengthen my LES. I'm trying breathing techniques and am hoping with a course of PPIs I can heal. I just need some normalcy back again. I eat low fat, I've cut out coffee, I don't over ear anymore, I stop eating 3 hours before bed, I have the pillow (which is not helping me sleep at all). I don't drink alcohol, i dont smoke. I just feel lost and trying all sorts of shot gun techniques to see if SOMETHING finally changes. 

TLDR; I'm just venting because I'm so frustrated and it's making me sad. This has been the most difficult period of my life hands down, and I'm only 30. This can't be my forever. ",1,1732369689.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

I apologized if I overstepped

Disclaimer: story is all over the place,"The title sounds unhinged I know but didn't know what else I could put. I'm sorry if I mix up some terms and stuff, never been to an English speaking country before and I'm not fluent.

So we're a friendgroup of 4. The youngest two are currently 16, I'm 17-18 and the oldest is turning 19. We've been friends since the youngest two was in 5th grade, bonded over the fact we all were in love with the game vampire village. Long story but in summary, our town has a lot of homicide/assault cases and I was very obsessed with these at age 11-12 iirc. I'd try everything to get my hands on case records and all and was generally stupid + creepy. This lead to my dumbass convincing the 3 other dumbasses to visit an abandoned mall. Yay. We convinced our parents (who as you can guess, didn't give a shit about us that much) that we were only going for camping. Letting your kids leave at a random evening for camping in a place where kidnapping cases weren't that rare, thanks mom! Anyways. We explored the mall for what felt like 40 minutes, it was around 9-10pm iirc. The youngest Neil (nickname btw) almost got snatched by a weird looking guy, the oldest had a baseball bat and she was the closest to Neil so she knocked him out with a few DEFINITELY not aggressive swings (gods bless her, she took karate classes at the time) and we turned in our heels and decided it was enough adventure for that day. This all happened before corona if you did the math already and I don't remember much of the details

There was this waffle place, we went to that place a lot since it was near our school. The usual cashier (?) was pretty friendly and he was basically our older brother figure and sometimes even helped with homeworks when there wasn't much people visiting. We'd hang out there after school. I'm going to call him Fries here cause I can. He was 26-something at the time and some another kid's (boys mostly) in my class pretty much looked up the the guy. Anyways after we did our definitely-not-panicked escape, we decided not to go home because it was still too early for a camping trip to end and only a few hours had passed. So we did the smart thing and went to his home which iirc, was pretty close like a 10 minutes walk. How did we even have his address? I genuinely don't remember that's confusing me too. He told us to head home at first but later gave in after our stubborn asses pressured him. Though we really put the guy at a thought spot, imagine someone finding our you - an adult - had 4 teens staying over. His at-the-time girlfriend probably got suspicious too but then gave Neil ice cream so she'd calm down, after that I think Asia (second youngest, another nickname) tried to explain what happened to his girlfriend. No, we didn't have guts to tell this to the police and Fries probably didn't want to explain why he had teenagers that aren't blood related to him staying over to the authorities. Anyways.

We went home early in the morning, all made shit about the nonexistent camping trip and decided to not talk about this. Plot twist, that guy now owns the waffle place. The place was a family business and now in his hands. Yay! Currently none of us are in the same school but still talk a lot and especially still meet up at the same waffle place. I just realized oldest doesn't have a nickname, she's Bat-man now. Man I sure am creative! We still talk to Fries, he's now married and his wife is 6 months pregnant. Yippe. A few days ago I was talking with some friends who are unrelated to the previous situation and over coffee in the waffle place again. Fries was in front so I had greeted him, asked he was doing ect. After sitting down whom I'll call Nose jokingly asked if I was cheating on my boyfriend (wtf). It annoyed me a lot but decided to ignore it. It was uncomfortable for say the least. Btw we're not the only kids friends with Fries, my boyfriend likes him too and the new middle schoolers in our old school love him (he gives out free drinks lol)

I just felt like yapping today considering nobody in our group brings this up and people are usually weirded out when an older guy is friends with a bunch of late teens. It doesn't always end up with the guy turning out as a p*do, there's good people in life too. This might have a bunch of holes and that's because it'd be much longer if I didn't purposefully left out some stuff + this happened like almost 7 years ago and my memory is like shit. And if Asia, Neil or Bat-man finds this, please tell ""Cucumber"" to give my necklace back I know he took it again and blocked me. ",1,1732369178.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Everything seems to be pissing me off recently....
Couple of examples are: a few weeks ago a guy in the office spilt a full cup of coffee on the carpet on a Tuesday at some point. The cleaner only works one day a week, on a Wednesday.
I opened the office early to let the cleaner in on the Wednesday and saw the stain. Cleaner turns up and I've known her about 5 years now. So I say to her do not clean that coffee stain, that's not your job. (In my opinion a work cleaner is there to vacuum, dust and empty the bins?) I also said if anyone asks you to clean that stain tell them to come see me.
Fast forward an hour and the guy who spilt the coffee said there's a coffee stain there that needs cleaning and she told him to do it himself (which he did)
Secondly, Friday just gone we had some unexpected visitors from a sister company turn up. The office manager organised a catering company to bring them buffet sandwiches.
About 14:00 we were told there were some left over sandwiches if we wanted them.
I'm just thinking you either buy every one in the company food or you just chuck the remainder in the bin?
It was a family run business up until 3 years ago until it was sold to a massive Dutch company. They're always sending surveys asking how happy we are at work in anonymous surveys but every time they do I end up getting pulled in the office after for a dressing down because I have an opinion.
It's basically the attitude of shut up and do your job mentally.

1gxzqwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATpreparation/comments/1gxzqwe/last_minute_testtaking_tips_for_cat_2024/,Last minute test-taking tips for CAT 2024,"Hello everyone:)
For starters, thanks for all the love on my ""2 cents"" posts. 

Coming to the main point, here are some things all the CAT takers tommorow can keep in mind:

1. In event of a change in exam pattern, EVERYONE who has any sort of a test-taking strategy in place as per the previous pattern will have to adapt. You're not the only one. So just go through the whole section, with the highest level of alertness and then take a few deep breaths and get to business. You'll be okay. Normalisation should take care of all the jitters the morning slot people face. In the end, it'll be the same DI and LR and time speed distance and alligations you will be solving.

2. I'll say it again. Before you begin a section, go through all the questions whilst being VERY ALERT. Then choose the RCs/DILR sets you will be attempting and go ahead. 

Back in my day in CAT 2021 DILR, I solved one easy DI set (4 questions) and then one of the tricky LR sets and had the solution completely on my note pad. Had a little less than 10 minutes left and I solved and marked the 4 questions of the second set. Then I relaxed for the last 4-5 minutes before quant started. Was satisfied with my DILR performance with guaranteed 8 correct questions. When I came back home and checked the Telegram groups, I realized that the second LR set I solved had 6 questions and not just 4. For no reason, I chose not to see if I left any questions and threw away my extra 6 marks and with it, a 99+ percentile overall and in DILR. 

3. Check all the equipment, especially the mouse.  If needed, ask them to replace. 

4. The on-screen calculator sometimes glitches and is not as flawless as the one you have in mocks. For me, at times, it entered whatever number I clicked on twice instead of once. It wasted around 4-5 crucial minutes in Quant. So keep an eye out for this. 

5. Get some black coffee in a 200ml coke bottle to the centre if you want. Well and good if allowed inside. If not, just drink a bit of it before you go in and toss the bottle. You can bring in some coke or sprite or whatever that helps you stay refreshed and alert. 

6. In case the paper seems easy, push yourself to solve more. Don't rely on you-know-who's 8-8-8 or 9-9-9 strategy. However, before a section ends, try to pause solving for a minute- minute and a half and take a few deep breaths and get ready for the next section. You want yourself to be calm and composed when you go through and select questions from the next section. 

So this was it. Thank you and hoping to see you all on the other side :)

All the best and good luck to everyone and I hope I get to help a lot of you in your WAT GD PI prep. 

P.S: Others are welcome to add more tips.

1gxzoyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/1gxzoyq/there_was_no_saving_perturabo/,There was no saving Perturabo ,"As the title says, and I am a little confused as to why people think there ever was. 

Perturabo is a bitter, arrogant, insecure man-child and this idea that he was under-appreciated and one 'Well done my boy' away from being some upstanding and righteous figure for the Imperium that would help stave off the rebels walking hand-in-throbbing-hand with Dorn, is absolute nonsense. 

Perty has two fatal flaws that make this line of thinking asinine. One of Perturabo's biggest problems is his self-awareness and perception of himself. No, not in the general sense, he is outright inbred levels of intelligent in that regard, but more in the self-awareness of his own genius and brilliance (which, I might sound like a hater, I am not, and to prove it, I'll give him full credits in saying that he is). He believes he is the smartest in the room, that no one can tell him something he does not already know and that no one's opinions on something carries as much weight as his, which is exactly the problem. Praise would not work on this asshole, because a lack of praise is a grievous insult to him and giving him praise is just you confirming what he already knew. And before you go down this path again, the dude had around 165 000 Iron Warriors worshipping the ground he walked on, thinking the world of him, and the first thing he did when meeting them was have 10% of them killed. And even if you gave him the benefit of the doubt and believe it was before the praise and getting to know them and blah blah blah, remember, he then proceeded to throw away thousands of their lives in gruelling and terrible campaigns that a super genius like him could've probably thought of a thousand ways to preserve lives but didn't because he was cranky and did not want to. 

Perturabo, despite his sons loving and venerating him due to it being something encoded in their fucking genetics, murders his sons and people around his general area so frequently that during the Battle of Phall, when shit was turning sideways, his crew had to pick a fucking name out of a hat (I made this up) to choose someone telling the genius who could get them out of a life-or-death situation that there is a life-or-death situation to begin with. Because they knew that he was going to kill whoever told him for this fuck up, HIS fuck up, and he then proceeded to do exactly that (I did not make this part up). This dude kills Iron Warriors at a rate that would make an Imperial Fist wet.

And yes, Horus won him to the dark side by actually giving him the praise he so longed for (From an equal, mind you, he used to be revered and venerated by thousands upon thousands of space marines and humans all the time but because he is an arrogant prick, it had to come from people he could dare call 'peers') and maybe you'd think that is proof that was all he needed. First of all, no, a large contributing factor to this is that he pretty much had no choice but to join (in his mind at least, the Emperor probably would not have cared to be honest) because he murder-destroyed his home-world to the point of no return (more on this later, I promise), and secondly, Horus' praise only ***KIND OF*** works. He is still skeptical and suspicious of it, despite liking it, so I could imagine that in a scenario where he actually had a choice, Perturabo most likely does not bite. When the praise he so long for finally does arrive from ***THE*** primarch of all primarchs, who hot-streaks nat20 charisma rolls on a regular basis, only partially works, then *maaaaaaybe* external praise **ISN'T** the solution here.

Perturabo's second problem is that he is so jaded and bitter, that he might as well be a coffee company located in China. No matter how much you suck him off, no matter how much you praise him, and venerate him, and lavish him in sycophancy enough to make Homelander hard, one moment where that isn't present, he will turn his back on you or kill you. Case in point, the one person (outside of maybe Magnus) who had a not-negative opinion of Perturabo as a person, who he had an actual, positive relationship with, his sister, rightfully criticises him for being a psycho ONCE. One moment of blunt and terrible truth in a sea of presumably good ones, is all it takes for this bitch to live out Tyrion Lannister's most wonted fantasy. If he could do that to her, why would any other relationship with his brothers or father not immediately falter the moment things turn sour (which is to be expected seeing as how they are all borderline immortal and thus some of these brouhahas are going to happen). You can praise Perturabo Tuesday through to Sunday, and he will hate you for not having done it that that Monday. A negative in his mind carries the weight of a million positives.

And just after this moment, where Perturabo is at his lowest, where for the first time in his long lived and successful career of Filicide, he has self-doubt and a moment of self-introspection. He did a bad bad thing, a boo-boo, a little bit of a fuck up, by killing billions and the one person who genuinely loved him like a sibling (again, except for maybe Magnus, who is also a fuck-up who could never be saved) and what does he do? Does he vow to do better? Does he rise and realise that he must change and-- nope! He instead becomes one of the most important (if not the most important) cog in a machine that orchestrates the worst war humanity has ever seen and essentially ensures its damnation. Based on his competency and ability, if the Horus Heresy is humanity's version of the Birth of Slaanesh, then Perturabo joining Horus is the equivalent to the final ball-slapping thrust at the parent-child eldar orgy that caused the birth of an evil god and turned out to doom an entire race. This man, much like Angron or Magnus, could never have been saved. Stop saying it. It is a lie!

Red Section: 35w folding PD charger, 100w 12k mAh power bank, medium length usb c cable (in case I need plug socket - will change to 100w cable) and MX Anywhere 2s Mouse.

Yellow Section: Galaxy Tab S9 (or +), MX Mechanical Mini keyboard ⌨️ and a compact stand (not shown)

Green Section: Sony MX 3 (or 4). As they fold so nicely into that pouch.

I'm going to use as a ""get out of the house to a coffee ☕ shop"" bag. Keeping to a minimalist life.",4,1732368203.0,GalaxyTab,0,0.83,False

So my question is what fragrance should I wear on this date? We are both pisces, love nature and the outdoors. Both live in Florida but come from cold weather climates.

Tom Ford black orchid 
SJP stash
Egyptian goddess 
Finery without a trace. Musky like EG
Alien
Cloud intense
YSL libre
Black opium
Mix bar no 9 bourbon vanilla
Philosophy fresh cream and cashmere.
LUSH sticky dates
Juliette has a gun, not another perfume
I would take any other recommendations happily, since I still have a day before the date. I like deep smokey, gourmand, spicy, warm, but I also love patchouli,  sandalwood, saffron. I was thinking about grabbing dossier amber saffron. Any advice appreciated. I'm out of the loop and want to make a good impression.  TIA",1,1732367976.0,Perfumes,5,0.67,False
1gxzg8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1gxzg8z/does_anyone_take_antidepressants_without_mood/,Does anyone take antidepressants without mood stabilizers? Has anyone tried all their bipolar medications without success? ,"TLDR: I have read some articles that say that monotherapy with antidepressants in bipolar 2 would not be bad, but, from what I read here and what I hear from doctors, antidepressants can make things worse and cause manic changes and make  the cycles get faster, but I don't know what else to take. I've already taken everything. 

--------

So 34F, bipolar 2 diagnosed at the beginning of the year. I've been taking all the meds I could since then and I'm still depressed. I'm starting to doubt my diagnosis.

I took antidepressants for many years and I don't know if the things I had were hypomania or just impulsivity and racing thoughts (and other things) due to something else. I have reasons to believe I had hypomania, including a post here a while back, someone said you look hypo as hell and lots of upvotes. But now that I'm depressed it seems like it never happened was another thing. Maybe I was just drinking too much coffee or something? 

 Antidepressants didn't improve much, but the problem is that I feel like I've been much worse since I started my bipolar treatment. I don't know if I'm wrong or not. I know I didn't cry as much,  I couldn't even cry actually. But I don't know if I was just as sad but couldn't cry. I don't remember.

The doctor mentioned trying to go back to SSRIs and leaving the bipolarity hypothesis in the background if Latuda didn't work.  The problem is that now I'm afraid that I'm bipolar and that taking antidepressants will make me go crazy or something. 

I read some articles about antidepressant monotherapy and they even pointed out that there is no reason to worry. That what they thought was causing the manic turn was perhaps just the course of the disease. But doctors that I follow and that I trust say that they prescribe it as a last resort. One of them doesn't even prescribe antidepressants if the person has a direct relative with schizophrenia/bipolar disorder/schizoaffective disorder (my case) even if there are not many other signs of bipolarity, due to the risk. 

Since I took it for several years, is it safe? Or would it actually be even worse? Does anyone take it? I've taken bupropion and I got really anxious. Could this be a sign of bipolar disorder? ",1,1732367973.0,bipolar2,0,1.0,False

My partner (cis male, bisexual) has been pushing me lately to look for new friends kay daw wala gid ko kuno na gasocialize sa mga old friends ko. My reason is daw ka one-sided na lang bi ka amon friendship kay ako na lang laban gapangamusta sa ila. Most of my friends abi kung wala sila pamilya na ila, nag migrate na ang iban sagwa Pinas. I try to understand them na lang kay its their lives and need man namon mag grow apart. 

Ang partner ko hindi man siya kahatag sang iya na whole time sa akon kay mga friends man siya kag very big iya na social circle. He's young (5 years younger) and nagtry ko mag upod one time sa iya na friendship circle and I feel very left out kay ang ila nasturyahan daw hindi ko ka relate gid. When I tried to mingle with them, ma feel ko gid ang awkwardness kay gatulok lang sila sa akon and I know hindi sila ka relate sa mga ginahambal ko. Hahahaha. It's okay, though. I totally understand. 

I've also tried mingling with some people here before to the point na we felt really close kag we had a connection (not romantically) but upon sharing my social media profiles, they began to treat me very differently and eventually ghosted me so I felt very very traumatized I had to delete my old Reddit account. Now nga pinilit na naman ko ka akon partner, I decided to create a new one. Hahaha

Background about me: 
- I am a Pisces 
- Been working for more than 13 years in the Freelancing/VA field (Specialty: Operations/Digital Marketing)
- Tech-savvy individual
- I do love going to cafes but I do not drink coffee (bawal sakon)
- Preference (Charot): I am a very introvert and awkward individual so I'm looking for extroverts who can really push me out of my comfort zone. Pero welcome gid maski introvert ka pa basta between us, ikaw ang mas extrovert. Charot lang. Hahahaha

Didn’t know where to went so came here. I am a recent international postgrad from LSE. I have been job hunting since September 26 and have applied to perhaps 150+ grad schemes. As you can imagine 95% were rejections. This does not just say include applying on a form, but doing a lot of ancillary leg work: 60+ coffee chats to get unique insights about the firm, attending 20+ webinars, going to recurring events at uni and having referrals for say 10% of the applied roles. Many of these companies it’s not just been one stupid app form but also 

1. 1 or more math/general tests 
2. Vidoe assessments 
3. Written answers 
4. Cover letter 

Forgot to mention: targeting strategy consulting in london 

I received interview invites from 
1 MAANG, 3 consulting firms (wow 4 in total) after all that legwork 

MAANG- waitlisted 
Have appeared for 2 consulting interviews and made it to final round for both,
Third is later 

Just had final round for the first one yesterday and totally botched up one of the case interviews. Not to mention one round usually has 2-4 interviews each. So one round is usually 2-3 hours. 

Anyway, fucked up that one interview but managed to recover. They said they woke respond end of the week but haven’t responded. Some candidates got R3 (which btw didn’t even exist they just decided to have one more round) 

Anyway- I m just feeling so hopeless, irritated, annoyed, angry at how much these companies take take and take and I don’t know what else to do to present myself and my skills. I FUCKING DONT KNOW WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING FOR. 

For strat consulting I also had to do a lot of case interview prep- which is honestly been the ONLY fun part. Nonetheless, I feel v hopeless. I don’t know how will I cope once recruiting season ends - at least right now companies are sure shot hiring. I feel
V depressed. Yoj are promised so much about the British economy but in reality it’s really really bad. In my home country I would get a job so easily. Despite having a Masters in economics from the LSE this has been my result. I just feel fed up, hopeless. Burnt out, tired and fucking angry with these firms. There really needs to be some regulation in how they treat people. 

Anyway- had an ugly cry today and feel better but still v burnt out. Just sick of companies not respecting my time and effort. 

Any words of hope and encouragement would be a much needed reprieve and very much appreciated.

We've been together for 6 years, married for 2. F38, M38. He’s genuinely a great guy. I can go out, hang out with friends—male or female—and he’s completely fine with it. He cooks, does laundry, and is always willing to help anyone at any time. He’s just… a good person.
 I can travel, be away for days, and he never gets upset. We’ve never fought, and I honestly have no bad words about him as a person. I love him. 

But here’s my problem. For years now, we barely talk in person. If we go for coffee(coffe bar, pub), it’s usually with someone else, never just the two of us. And when it is just us, he’s on his phone the entire time, scrolling Reddit or reading the news. 

We haven’t watched a movie together in so long that I can’t even remember the last time we did. He’s always in one room on his computer, and I’m in another watching TV. 
He’s never told me he loves me or that I’m beautiful in person—not even on our wedding day when he saw me for the first time in my dress. The most I’ve managed to get out of him is a goodnight or good morning kiss. 
He’s never hugged me on his own. When we’re intimate, he doesn’t initiate in a loving way; he just says, “Let’s go,” or sends me a text. There’s no affection or connection beforehand. 

He doesn’t ask me how I am—ever. If I go out, he never asks if I had a good time. I’ve been on work trips for 10 days at a time, and he hasn’t once asked me in person how it went. 

Over text or calls, it’s different—he’ll say he loves me or that he misses me, but in person, it’s like nothing. He barely talks to me, and every conversation feels forced. His responses are always just ""yes"" or ""no Example. 
Today we had lunch together, just the two of us, and we didn’t say a single word the entire meal. 

I’m sitting here crying while writing this because I feel so sad. I’m someone who loves hugs, kisses, jokes, and laughter, but for the past 3 years, I’ve had almost none of that. Whenever I tell him how I feel, he brushes it off like im overreacting. I’ve even had to beg him for a hug, and when he gives me one, it feels like it’s obligation. 

Has anyone else experienced something like this? Is there a way to improve our connection, or I just need accept that this is the way he is? Any advice please.",1,1732367805.0,relationship_advice,9,0.67,False

- I’m planning on starting with 40mcg a day for about a week or two and going to 80mcg if everything is good.

- Is it safe to take pre workout or should i not even take pre workout since i heard clen makes u pretty active if you take it before workouts.

- I have a decent amount of coffee everyday day, should i decrease that? since i wouldn’t want to increase my heart rate too high my mixing caffeine and clen.

- Is it ok if i stop taking it after reaching 90 kilos? what kind of effects can i see if i do stop, or should i continue taking it at a lower dosage?

1gxzbne,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1gxzbne/what_kind_of_business_with_300k/,What kind of business with $300k?,"Hi All, I live in San Diego and am 43 and work for the federal government but am so tired of all the headaches at times and I work extremely hard. I make about $195k and max out my 401k.  I seem to save about $50k cash each year right now. No kids and never married and at this pace with how bad dating in my city is I’m sure I’ll be single for the foreseeable future!

I currently own a home worth about 1.15 million and owe $225k on it.  I have $300k in my 401k which id like to leave alone and another $300k I saved on the side currently in VOO ETF.

I did the math and my living expenses are $70k a year being super conservative (with $1200 a month saved for house maintenance/remodel).  This makes me think I need about $100k of income minimum.

What would you do with $300k to get closer to financial independence?

I thought of the following but I don’t know if they’re a pipe dream:

1.  Expand my home to have a studio in the rear and live in it and rent the rest of the house but that still wouldn’t let me quit my job.

2. Partition my home (strategically) so I can use the majority of it as an air bnb… I still can’t quit my job.

3. Start a coffee shop or two near a high density development.. I read coffee shops may take $200k to open up and owners make $48k on average..

Maybe open a surf shop (can be inland) combined with coffee shop to make more profit and draw more people?

4. Open a surf academy near one of the inland wave pools.. Waco Texas has a wave pool even professional surfers are traveling to surf man made waves… although I’m sure it’s just a matter of time before others do just this if they haven’t already.

5. Sell my house and buy a 1 bedroom and put the remainder in VOO

6. Just leave my $300k in VOO and hope my stress levels go down with my federal job and let time do its thing and keep putting $50k a year in s&p 500


I’m somewhat risk adverse… I realize I could also put myself in an even more stressful situation with a coffee shop or other business but I also like control and hate being told what to do all the time in my current line of work.

Bottom line is my work life balance is awful right now and I want to surf more.. I’m happy to work hard especially if I can bring my passion into it (surfing is one of my passions) but want more flexibility and control but not be living totally on the edge either if I leave a stable job like I have now.

That first trip allowed us to discover major highlights such as Tokyo, Kyoto (and Nara), Osaka (and Himeji), as well as the islands of Naoshima and Teshima. These islands remain among the most beautiful places we’ve ever visited, and we highly recommend them. However, Hiroshima and Miyajima were out of reach during that trip due to the distance.

This time, our goals were twofold: to discover Hiroshima and its surroundings and to explore the natural beauty and culture of the Japanese Alps.

We incorporated many tips from Reddit and other platforms when organizing this trip. Additionally, we wanted to optimize travel to avoid spending too much time on transportation. The 7-day JR Pass turned out to be exceptionally cost-effective for us, given the numerous train journeys (Tokyo → Hiroshima → Takayama → Kanazawa). While in Tokyo, we had friends living there, which influenced our activities: strolling around, shopping, and meeting up with them for dinners and evenings out.

Lastly, to simplify our travel between destinations, we made use of luggage forwarding services. This allowed us to travel light between Takayama and Kanazawa by sending our main suitcases directly to Tokyo. We highly recommend this setup for multi-city trips in Japan. As for the bars and restaurant, check carrefuly in reservation are needed if you want to avoid queue or refusal of entry. To move around, even in small cities, use Google Maps. Lastly, my e-SIM worked everywhere (I used airalo).

Day 1: Thursday, November 7

Arrival in Tokyo

Morning:

- Picked up the JR Pass at Haneda Airport.
- Dropped off our luggage at The Blossom Hibiya, a high-end hotel with spacious rooms, excellent service, and fantastic value when booked in advance.
- Walked through Shinjuku Gyoen, a tranquil park filled with painters and school groups.

Lunch:
- Sakae Sushi, a good-quality omakase in the Ueno area at a reasonable price for lunch. This was also our first chance to reunite with friends.

Afternoon:
- Checked into the hotel and took time to rest.

Evening:

- Dinner: A casual ramen spot in our neighborhood.

Day 2: Friday, November 8 / Tokyo – Ebisu, Daikanyama, and Nakameguro

Morning and Afternoon:

- Lunch: Pizza Marumo, considered one of the best pizzas in the world, located in Ebisu. Reservations are recommended, but we managed to secure an outdoor table by arriving at noon.
- Explored the trendy neighborhoods of Daikanyama and Nakameguro, visiting boutique shops and strolling through a park atop Daikanyama.
- Stopped by Flugen in Harajuku, a coffee shop that transforms into a cocktail bar in the evening.

Evening:

- Dinner: Futago, a yakiniku restaurant in Shibuya offering delicious food and welcoming staff despite the lack of an English menu.
- Bars: Record Bar and Music Bar Lion, two intimate venues in Shibuya perfect for drinks and music.

Day 3: Saturday, November 9 / Tokyo – Harajuku and Electro Night

Morning and Afternoon:

- Strolled through Harajuku, shopping in vintage stores and discovering local fashion.

Evening:

- Cocktail bar memento mori that focus on cacao. Delicious.
- Dinner: Teppanyaki Sakura in Shinjuku, a high-end restaurant with an All-You-Can-Drink option. It’s slightly pricey but worth it for the exceptional quality.
- Night Out: Enter Shibuya, a small electro club located in a building Where a French dj was playing. Entry costs 2,000 yen, and the atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming.
- Late Night Breakfast: we took the first metro Ramen at Ichiran, open 24/7, with no lines at 5 a.m.

Day 4: Sunday, November 10 / Tokyo – Rest Day

- Day: Rested in the hotel after the late night.
- Evening: Dinner: Gyozas in a small, cozy restaurant in our area.

Day 5: Monday, November 11 / Tokyo → Hiroshima → Miyajima

- Morning: Took the Shinkansen to Hiroshima, arriving in the early afternoon. From there, we transferred to Miyajima via train and ferry.

- Afternoon: Took the cable car to the summit. Note: The last cable car leaves at 4:30 p.m., and queues can get long. We didn’t spend much time at the top, but it was worth it. Explored Miyajima’s center, discovering local specialties. Shops tend to close after sunset (around 5 p.m.), but a few remained open.

Seriously, learning some basic Japanese was a game changer compared to my first visit where I knew significantly less. Learning Katakana especially means you can read 'english words' in japanese like 'Hot Dog' and 'Iced Coffee'. Many drinks menus are in katakana and a surprising amount of food also uses katakana in the name.

  
On speaking and listening though - learning at least some basic phrases like 'I want this' 'what is this' 'bill please' 'paying separate' and 'how much is this' as well as numbers means your not fumbling around most of the time trying to figure out how to communicate basic things or figuring out how much things cost. 

  
That said, Tokyo especially is fairly accommodating as many menus use pictures, a lot of restaurants have english menus, though the prices were different compared to the japanese menus and some of them had different items available on them, the subways and busses generally use English although the further you depart from Tokyo the generally harder it is to navigate subways and busses.

Then there are the attitudes of people - generally, a lot of Japanese people were far friendlier to us when realizing that we learned some basic japanese, which actually scored us some free items at some restaurants and shops we visited, and while we couldn't have full blown conversations, knowing enough to answer and ask some basic questions helped overall with the feeling of isolation you can get when going abroad.

Now for some other useful tips...particularly about restrooms....

Be prepared for some of the worst toilet paper you've ever experienced. I'm talking 1-ply toilet tissue.

Buy or bring a very small hand towel to dry your hands with as many restrooms don't have places to dry your hands.

Bring a small anti viral hand soap as some restrooms don't even have soap in them. People just rinse their hands with water and walk off apparently.

1gxz1ao,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1gxz1ao/rf_chance_encounters/,[RF] Chance Encounters,"I first saw her at Maple Street Coffee on a Tuesday morning. She was reading Murakami's ""Norwegian Wood"" while absent-mindedly stirring her tea. I remember because I'd just finished that book myself. What were the odds?

When she appeared at the farmer's market that weekend, I couldn't help but smile at the coincidence. She wore the same oversized cardigan from the coffee shop, now paired with a canvas tote bag that slowly filled with heirloom tomatoes and fresh herbs. I wasn't following her—I always did my shopping there on Saturday mornings.

These serendipitous moments kept happening. The local library's poetry reading (I'd been meaning to attend one for months). The art house cinema's Kurosawa retrospective (anyone with good taste would be there). The neighborhood park during lunch hour (it was on my regular running route).

I began to notice the little things: how she tucked her hair behind her left ear when concentrating, her preference for earl grey tea, the way she always checked her phone before entering a building. It felt like the universe was showing me signs, weaving our paths together in this small city.

I started changing my routine slightly—nothing dramatic. If the coffee shop was crowded, I'd wait a few minutes for her usual table to free up, just so I could happen to pass by with a friendly nod. I switched my running schedule to match the lunch hour. I found myself choosing books from the same section she frequented at the library.

When I discovered she worked at the Morrison Building downtown, it felt like another piece of cosmic synchronicity. My therapy clients wouldn't mind if I moved their appointments to the coffee shop across the street—the ambiance was better there anyway.

Sometimes I'd catch myself wondering if I should say hello, strike up a conversation about Murakami or ask about her favorite Kurosawa film. But the timing never felt quite right. Perfect moments like these couldn't be forced. They had to unfold naturally, like everything else in our intertwined paths.

I even started a journal to document these meaningful coincidences. Each entry reinforced what I already knew—that there was something special happening here. Something profound that others might not understand.

It wasn't until I overheard her on the phone, voice trembling, describing a stranger who kept showing up everywhere, that I felt a cold knot form in my stomach. But that couldn't be about me. Could it? We were just two people whose lives naturally intersected in this small city.

Besides, I had documentation of my routines from before I ever saw her. The coffee shop receipts, the library card history, my running app data—all proof that these were my places first. Or at least some of them were. I think.

Weren't they?

Looking at my journal now, I notice my handwriting has grown more frantic, the pages filled with times, dates, locations. When did I start recording so many details? Why did I need to?

No. These are still just coincidences. They have to be.",1,1732366620.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Alexandra S. Levine posted on [*Forbes*](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandralevine/2022/04/27/how-tiktok-live-became-a-strip-club-filled-with-15-year-olds/?sh=7e1f452962d7) ""How TikTok Live Became ‘A Strip Club Filled With 15-Year-Olds’"" (Apr 27, 2022) with the intro\\kicker: ""Livestreams on the social media app are a popular place for men to lurk and for young girls — enticed by money and gifts — to perform sexually suggestive acts.

The piece started with MJ, a 14-year-old blond nymphet in a bralette with a Cash App account, who gets her bills paid by live-streaming for ≈ 2,000 men on TikTok.

>“You’re paying my bills,” MJ told the audience, running a finger over her mouth.

>“$35 for a flash,” one viewer responded. Another asked how much to send to her Cash App.

>As she posed and pursed her lips, her long blonde hair draped over her tight black bralette, some asked MJ to show them her feet.

>“I’m 68 and you owe me one,” one attendee told her as more requests piled on.

>These exchanges did not take place between adults at a nightclub; they took place on TikTok Live, where MJ, who said she was 14 years old, was broadcasting with friends to 2,000 strangers on a recent Saturday night.

Like MJ, other nubile nymphets are rewarded for their provocative performances with: ""\[...\] TikTok gifts, which can be redeemed for money, or off-platform payments to Venmo, PayPal or Cash App accounts that users list in their TikTok profiles.""

Leah Plunkett, an assistant dean at Harvard Law School, opined that nymphets performing ""activities"" for adults for money on TikTok is the digital equivalent of teen strip clubs:

>It’s “the digital equivalent of going down the street to a strip club filled with 15-year-olds,” says Leah Plunkett, an assistant dean at Harvard Law School and faculty associate at Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, focused on youth and media. Imagine a local joint putting a bunch of minors on a stage before a live adult audience that is actively giving them money to perform whatever G, PG or PG-13 activities they request, she said.

https://preview.redd.it/blesgucren2e1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=177ff6b415300bdbad3e663263960fc01ea05615

Levine listed some ""demands"" (e.g., teen girl-on-girl kissing and wrestling), that nymphets are asked to do in exchange for being ""showered with virtual \[TikTok\] gifts"":

>Some of the demands are explicit — like asking girls to kiss each other, spread their legs or flash the camera \[...\] Commenters say “outfit check” to get a complete look at a girl’s body; “pedicure check” to see their feet; “there’s a spider on your wall” to get girls to turn around and show their rears; and “play rock-paper-scissors” to encourage girls to flirt-fight or wrestle with each other. Phrases like “put your arms up” or “touch the ceiling” are often directed at girls in crop tops so viewers can see their breasts and stomachs. And many simply coax girls to show their tongues and belly buttons or do handstands and splits. In return, the girls are showered with virtual gifts, like flowers, hearts, ice cream cones and lollipops, that can be converted to cash.

Under the subheading ""Teenage quid pro quo"", Levine profiled Ella, another live-streaming TikTok teen, whom, after turning down the lights, creatively stripped for ""digital gifts"" in front of ≈ 3,000 viewers:

>Ella turned the lights down low and propped the phone up in front of her body — just beneath her chin, so her face was hidden — and picked up a pair of scissors.

>Very slowly, as Ariana Grande played and nearly 3,000 people looked on, she began snipping pieces of her white t-shirt. Strip by strip, hole by hole, with every cut revealing more of Ella’s chest and black bra, commenters clamored for more and digital gifts poured in — a steady stream of roses, fire, whipped coffee and other cartoonish prizes.

17-year-old Madison shared with Forbes that some of her teen friends earned almost $1,000 per month lustfully live streaming week after week on TikTok and that they cunningly avoid TikTok's age restrictions by simply lying about their ages:

>Madison, a 17-year-old from South Carolina, told Forbes that some of her underage friends had been earning $200 a week off the gifts they’d racked up in their TikTok livestreams. Although she can’t receive Live gifts yet because she signed up using her correct age \[...\]

Interestingly, we learned from Levine's piece that, in addition to lying about their ages, some teens suggestively put links to their money apps in their profiles (e.g., Venmo, PayPal or Cash App). TikTok isn't the only app with stripping nymphets: ""Snap, Instagram and YouTube — other popular destinations for children and teens — have also been criticized for exposing underage users to dangerous or unhealthy situations."" And apparently, there are a lot of sexually suggestive teen TikToks as ≈ 43 million videos were removed from the platform: ""\[...\] for policy violations related to minor safety."" To quote Mare of Mare of Easttown said, ""Teenage girls are fucking sneaky""

https://preview.redd.it/ifj9wngnen2e1.jpg?width=307&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b96f06b878ac10bcd20f944e721f3cedd6d674d4

Confusingly, Plunkett, of Harvard, added: “That is sexual exploitation. But that's exactly what TikTok is doing here,"" which raises some (rhetorical) questions. 

1. Isn't it sexual exploitation *and* sexual *self*\-exploitation when teens post sexually suggestive content (e.g., TikTok teens twerking in thongs) for free but for likes and followers? 
2. And what about 18-year-old teens? Does it magically cease to be sexual exploitation when the teens turn 18 and create OnlyFans accounts (e.g., Bhad Bhabie and Sami Sheen)? 
3. And why did Plunkett remove the stripping teens and leering men from the equation by saying ""that's exactly what TikTok is doing here""?

Hello Raleigh. I'm coming into town by car tomorrow to catch a plane. I'm planning to get to town early and mess around for a couple+ hours before going to the airport around 1pm. Eating would be good. I love greasy spoons, southern food, NCBBQ, fried fish, burgers, ham biscuits or any biscuits, breakfast burritos and tacos, gumbo, beans and rice, scrumptious healthy stuff, good coffee and sandwiches, whatever y'all got.

Ideally it would be a place chill enough to gather my head between travel modes and I don't have to stress about line length.

Does anyone have any suggestions? I know it's Sunday so that makes it hard. It can be some neighborhood spot, a Raleigh staple, or just a little place you like to go near the airport. Aside from driving around and maybe a park walk (ideas?) it will be what I remember Raleigh by.

1gxyzfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1gxyzfr/how_to_choose_the_right_furniture_for_your_living/,How to choose the right furniture for your living room?,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share my experience and insights about choosing the perfect furniture for your living room since I recently went through this whole process myself.

Let me tell you, picking the right furniture isn't as simple as just buying whatever looks good in the store. I learned this the hard way when I first moved into my apartment and rushed into buying pieces that didn't really work together.

The first thing you need to consider is the size of your space. I cannot stress this enough! Measure your living room and leave enough space for walking around comfortably. Trust me, nothing's worse than a cramped living room where you're constantly bumping into furniture.

The centerpiece of any living room is usually the sofa. I recently found this amazing collection of sofas that really helped me make my decision: https://athometouch.com/sofa. They have options for every style and budget, which made the whole process much easier.

Here's what I've learned about choosing furniture:

1. Consider your lifestyle: If you have kids or pets, you'll want durable, stain-resistant materials.
2. Think about comfort: Those Instagram-worthy minimalist pieces aren't always the most comfortable.
3. Color coordination is key: Pick a color scheme and stick to it.
4. Don't forget storage: Coffee tables and TV stands with storage space are lifesavers.

Another important aspect is the arrangement. I like to create conversation areas where people can easily chat without shouting across the room. My new sofa (which I got from here: https://athometouch.com/sofa) became the anchor point for my entire living room setup.

Lighting is also crucial - mix different types of lighting (overhead, table lamps, floor lamps) to create different moods. I learned that the right lighting can make even budget furniture look more expensive!

Don't feel pressured to buy everything at once. It's okay to take your time and add pieces gradually. This way, you can really think about what works best for your space and lifestyle.

One last tip: always read reviews and check return policies. Some furniture might look great online but feel completely different in person.

Hope this helps someone avoid the mistakes I made! Let me know if you have any questions - I'm happy to share more specific details about my experience.",1,1732366439.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

1gxyvve,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1gxyvve/tips_for_sorta_new_hire_on_bar/,tips for (sorta) new hire on bar,"i was hired in july and i picked things up pretty quickly. i wasnt as quick when i first started but i definitely am now (i do have my off days, which sucks because i feel like i’m being judged). and its especially harder because i was the first new hire in a year, and after me 2 new people were hired BUT they’ve been getting bar time a lot sooner than i have. i get scheduled opens, so i’m always working peak and i don’t get solo bar when we first open. sometimes i’ll get maybe 45 minutes to an hour on cafe bar depending on my shift. i’ve got sequencing down, but when theres an insane amount of drinks and its switching between hot and cold bar or mobiles for just brewed coffee it gets overwhelming. i’m just wondering what i could do to become more efficient, and how i can stop being so anxious every time i go on bar. also, when i was hired was when the beverage routine was changed, so its now shots first and then milk.


- for sequencing in my head i tell myself start 1, then start the 2nd, finish the first, and start the 3rd. which is a BIG help
- however when doing this, i get thrown off with brewed coffees. so i feel like i fall behind when grabbing a brewed coffee
- its the same thing for frappes, and sometimes the frappe consistency looks weird so i start second guessing myself
- i spilled a drink and that was especially overwhelming, i know it happens but when im just starting bar it feels like i don’t have room to make mistakes
- if i spill a drink and remake it, how do i stop falling behind? 
- how do incorporate brewed coffees (including cold brew, and iced coffee) into my beverage routine
- if i mess up and accidentally use reg espresso instead of blonde, do i restart the drink? i feel like unless the specifically asked for blonde its okay to mess that up (sometimes i’ll read blonde for the holiday drinks on the sticker and wont process it)
- i know the steps:
* queue shots
* pump syrup
* steam milk
and i know what goes into each drinks (please correct me if im wrong)
shots:
- americanos are 1,2,3,4 
- hot drinks is 1,1,2,2
- iced drinks are 1,2,3
syrups
- hot drinks 2,3,4,5
- cold drinks 3,4,6,7
for matcha 2,3,4 
frappes are all 2,3,4 

and i picked this up pretty quickly when i first started but sometimes i feel like im slowed down because im counting or i cant find the syrup bottle
i think its just my anxiety but any tips? i feel like i fell so far behind because i’m getting bar time now after so long compared to the new hires

1gxyu6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/1gxyu6m/chance_encounters/,Chance Encounters,"I first saw her at Maple Street Coffee on a Tuesday morning. She was reading Murakami's ""Norwegian Wood"" while absent-mindedly stirring her tea. I remember because I'd just finished that book myself. What were the odds?

When she appeared at the farmer's market that weekend, I couldn't help but smile at the coincidence. She wore the same oversized cardigan from the coffee shop, now paired with a canvas tote bag that slowly filled with heirloom tomatoes and fresh herbs. I wasn't following her—I always did my shopping there on Saturday mornings.

These serendipitous moments kept happening. The local library's poetry reading (I'd been meaning to attend one for months). The art house cinema's Kurosawa retrospective (anyone with good taste would be there). The neighborhood park during lunch hour (it was on my regular running route).

I began to notice the little things: how she tucked her hair behind her left ear when concentrating, her preference for earl grey tea, the way she always checked her phone before entering a building. It felt like the universe was showing me signs, weaving our paths together in this small city.

I started changing my routine slightly—nothing dramatic. If the coffee shop was crowded, I'd wait a few minutes for her usual table to free up, just so I could happen to pass by with a friendly nod. I switched my running schedule to match the lunch hour. I found myself choosing books from the same section she frequented at the library.

When I discovered she worked at the Morrison Building downtown, it felt like another piece of cosmic synchronicity. My therapy clients wouldn't mind if I moved their appointments to the coffee shop across the street—the ambiance was better there anyway.

It wasn't until I overheard her on the phone, voice trembling, describing a stranger who kept showing up everywhere, that I felt a cold knot form in my stomach. But that couldn't be about me. Could it? We were just two people whose lives naturally intersected in this small city.

Besides, I had documentation of my routines from before I ever saw her. The coffee shop receipts, the library card history, my running app data—all proof that these were my places first. Or at least some of them were. I think.

1gxyu3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1gxyu3c/am_i_being_too_hard_on_myself_how_to_let_go_of/,Am I being too hard on myself? How to let go of old me and focus on new ,"So I've been essentially out of touch with reality since around 2020, I have been travelling around the world with my (now ex) long term bf, but we were living like roommates, we travelled around turkey, egypt, north africa, middle east, but basically just drinking everyday and not really taking in the sights to see/experience. I guess alot of my drinking was ignoring the fact that the relationship was supposed to end a long time ago. We told ourselves we were having fun but it wasn't fun, isolating from family/friends, spending Christmas in foreign countries living in a shitty dirty hotel, living from a suitcase.

I started to cheat with other men, in an aim to find love/affection/romance/self validation. I cheated with old 'disgusting' men, who were clearly using me, and my drinking was getting out of control and making me do things I'd never do, and even seriously considered being a prostitute (that'll show you how out of touch with reality I was)  my days consisted of drinking, going to casinos, meeting old random men, often still drinking by 8am the next morning, in lobby areas of fancy hotels while people were having coffee with their work laptops. Shameful, I know.

  
I've basically been living out of a suitcase since 2020, in various shitty hotels across the world, not calling or staying in touch with family (whom I'm very close to) only a FB or Whatsapp message every few weeks or even once a month. I feel like I've ghosted my family, which has been super traumatic for me, but I haven't done that intentionally, and now I'm actively trying to reach out to loved ones as often as possible.

  
No contact with my old friends from home, you could call it isolating yourself. Doing nothing everyday, just drinking, going outside to a mall then home, wake up, hangover, drink, eat, mall, bla bla, you get it. No progress, no life, just almost living on auto pilot.

  
Fast forward now to 2024. 

I've become a resident of a country, have a home and finally have some stability. I'm in a new loving relationship with a man who helped me out of negative cycles (drinking excessively, sleeping with strange men, staying in my long term relo that was supposed to end years ago) 

I feel huge transitions but at the same time I feel like I've been thrown  back into normal life and it's supposed to be normal again but it's not. I've ended that relationship/situation with the long term bf almost a year ago.

I've slowly started to integrate into a normal life where I have a 'home' and a place to keep my belongings, and I start to feel 'stable' again for the first time since many years ago, I no longer live out of a suitcase in a  hotel, wearing dirty clothes, doing things I regret and having crazy ideas like becoming a prostitute, I now try to live a somewhat fulfilling life, foster my family relationships and try to have a healthy mindset and look forward. 

  
My problem is, I'm still struggling with integrating into 'normal' life. I earn money online so don't need to go to a job everyday, I have I guess social anxiety and I don't really have any friends because I've basically forgot how to even make friends since I've basically isolated myself from the life I had before, since 2020. I do things like gym and going to swim and reading and going for walks outdoors but my screen time is very high and I feel like I'm 'rotting in bed' most days and my drinking is starting to get more frequent again.

I feel so much pressure for me to be a certain way but I feel that period of my life is holding me back, almost like there's something stuck in my brain that isn't ready to be opened/closed yet.

  
Am I being too hard on myself? Do I need to reflect and heal on this period of my life before transitioning to this new version of myself?  If so, how do I begin to reflect and reassure myself that the version of 2020-2023 me is not me forever, and the actions I've done before don't dictate my entire future, how can I let go of those traumatic years and not allow them to define my future/present, I still feel 'trapped' in that persons mindset and if I'm honest I felt myself on the verge of like a mental breakdown a few weeks ago, and sometimes feel my mind taking control of me

I used to be an extremely active 'go getter' type person, loved working, had so many ideas for the future, my life looked promising, but these few years have messed everything up, but I'm determined to get back to the social butterfly, bright eyed, eager , positive me. 

  
Was it just being in an 8 year situation/relationship and all the drinking and isolating that f\*\*\*ed me up? How can I actively take steps to reflect, analyze, let go, and adequately plan the next steps and not get trapped in that vicious, self sabotage cycle that I seem to have developed? would therapy actually help? or is there any other steps I can take. For context if this matters, my father has schizophrenia, my mother has late diagnosed ADHD and mild autism, and depression, anxiety. 

  
I'm even considering herbal remedies or some sort of practice to help me because I feel really stuck in my old mind/ways and it's claustrophobic. I feel like I need a total mindset detox/restore/refresh

Swiping right or left is degrading and basically "" online people shopping"" with zero emotion. People are just living their lives and not meeting other singles at bars or normal events anymore. I know I'm not. We're all off doing our own thing, walking dogs, working out, books, coffee, dinner with friends and family, outdoor shit, indoor shit whatever! We are all "" waiting for love to happen!!"" that bullshit saying. Oh it'll just happen one day, so live your life! NOPE.

We are not meeting each other. We are not meeting OTHER SINGLES!

SO what I am proposing is we somehow agree to a set time for singles to meet during MUNDANE everyday errands and tasks. Everyone goes out to do this type of stuff. It is the one constant in every single persons life. 

So for example, Groceries. We all do them. If somehow we can all agree that at 1pm every Sat-Sun is "" singles groceries"" BAM! The grocery store is flooded with single people and maybe they're meeting!? And talking about what's for dinner that night!!!? Sure people don't want to be bothered doing groceries. So that's fine. Stay away from 1pm Sat- Sun.

Same with the gym. If we agree 8 pm Tuesdays- is a SINGLE work out time??? Wear all the skimpy tight clothing you want because there will be people ready to meet. Don't want to be bothered? Don't go to the gym Tuesdays at 8pm. Done.

Let's agree on some times, locations, anything. Tell everyone you can, start doing this, get this trending somehow.

None of this is set in stone. What do you guys think.

There are 5.5 MILLION PEOPLE on this sub. This shit is not working anymore. We need to get something going.

**What is Java Burn?**  
  
  
Java Burn is a powdered dietary supplement designed to be mixed with your daily coffee. Marketed as a tasteless, odorless formula, it blends seamlessly into your cup of joe without altering the flavor. It contains a mix of natural ingredients such as green tea extract, L-carnitine, and chromium, each known for its potential health benefits. Java Burn's unique selling point is its ability to boost metabolism and support weight loss while you enjoy your morning brew. **The Pros of Java Burn**

1. **Ease of Use** One of the standout benefits of Java Burn is its simplicity. Users only need to stir the powder into their coffee, making it a convenient addition to daily routines. There are no pills to swallow or elaborate preparation steps required.
2. **Natural Ingredients** Java Burn boasts a blend of natural components that have been scientifically linked to metabolism enhancement and fat oxidation. Key ingredients include:
   * **Green Tea Extract**: Known for its antioxidant properties and ability to support fat burning.
   * **L-Theanine**: Helps improve focus and reduce caffeine jitters.
   * **Chromium**: Aids in regulating blood sugar levels and curbing cravings.
3. **Energy Boost** Many users report feeling more energetic throughout the day, attributing this to the synergy between the caffeine in coffee and the ingredients in Java Burn.
4. **Weight Management Support** Customer testimonials frequently highlight noticeable changes in weight and body composition after consistent use, particularly when combined with a balanced diet and exercise.
5. **Non-GMO and Gluten-Free** Java Burn is designed to cater to a broad audience, including those with dietary restrictions. It is free of GMOs, gluten, and artificial additives.

**The Cons of Java Burn**

1. **Variable Results** Not everyone experiences the same benefits. While some users see significant changes in their energy and weight, others report minimal or no results, which could depend on individual metabolism and lifestyle factors.
2. **Dependence on Coffee** Java Burn is specifically formulated for coffee drinkers. If you’re not a fan of coffee, you may find it challenging to integrate this product into your routine.
3. **Price Point** At around $49 per pouch (with discounts on bulk purchases), Java Burn might be considered pricey for some consumers, especially if they don’t see the promised results.
4. **Limited Availability** Currently, Java Burn is only available through its official website, which could be inconvenient for those who prefer purchasing supplements from physical stores or third-party platforms.
5. **Possible Side Effects** A minority of users have reported side effects such as mild digestive discomfort or jitteriness, potentially due to the combination of caffeine and metabolism-boosting ingredients.

**Customer Reviews: The Good, The Neutral, and The Bad**  
  
**Positive Experiences**  
  
  
Sarah T., a 38-year-old teacher, shared her story:  
*""I’ve been using Java Burn for three months, and I’m thrilled with the results. I feel more energetic during the day, and I’ve lost 10 pounds without making drastic changes to my diet. The fact that it’s so easy to use makes it a no-brainer for me.""* **Mixed Feedback**  
  
  
John M., a fitness enthusiast, had this to say:  
*""Java Burn helped me maintain my energy levels during workouts, but I didn’t see much change in my weight. I think it works best as an energy booster rather than a weight-loss product.""* **Negative Feedback**  
  
  
Emily R., a stay-at-home mom, expressed her disappointment:  
*""I had high hopes for Java Burn, but after a month, I didn’t notice any difference. It might work for some, but it didn’t do much for me.""*  
  
**Final Verdict**  
  
Java Burn has its fair share of advantages, particularly for coffee lovers looking for an easy way to support their weight management goals. Its natural formula, energy-boosting effects, and compatibility with coffee make it a convenient choice. However, individual results vary, and it’s not a guaranteed solution for everyone.  
  
If you’re considering Java Burn, it’s essential to manage your expectations and consult with a healthcare professional, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medication. While many users rave about the product, others find the results less compelling. Ultimately, Java Burn may be worth a try if you’re already a coffee drinker looking for an additional health boost",1,1732365378.0,newyorkknicks,0,1.0,False

Java Burn has its fair share of advantages, particularly for coffee lovers looking for an easy way to support their weight management goals. Its natural formula, energy-boosting effects, and compatibility with coffee make it a convenient choice. However, individual results vary, and it’s not a guaranteed solution for everyone.

**What is Java Burn?**  
  
  
Java Burn is a powdered dietary supplement designed to be mixed with your daily coffee. Marketed as a tasteless, odorless formula, it blends seamlessly into your cup of joe without altering the flavor. It contains a mix of natural ingredients such as green tea extract, L-carnitine, and chromium, each known for its potential health benefits. Java Burn's unique selling point is its ability to boost metabolism and support weight loss while you enjoy your morning brew. **The Pros of Java Burn**

1. **Ease of Use** One of the standout benefits of Java Burn is its simplicity. Users only need to stir the powder into their coffee, making it a convenient addition to daily routines. There are no pills to swallow or elaborate preparation steps required.
2. **Natural Ingredients** Java Burn boasts a blend of natural components that have been scientifically linked to metabolism enhancement and fat oxidation. Key ingredients include:
   * **Green Tea Extract**: Known for its antioxidant properties and ability to support fat burning.
   * **L-Theanine**: Helps improve focus and reduce caffeine jitters.
   * **Chromium**: Aids in regulating blood sugar levels and curbing cravings.
3. **Energy Boost** Many users report feeling more energetic throughout the day, attributing this to the synergy between the caffeine in coffee and the ingredients in Java Burn.
4. **Weight Management Support** Customer testimonials frequently highlight noticeable changes in weight and body composition after consistent use, particularly when combined with a balanced diet and exercise.
5. **Non-GMO and Gluten-Free** Java Burn is designed to cater to a broad audience, including those with dietary restrictions. It is free of GMOs, gluten, and artificial additives.

**The Cons of Java Burn**

1. **Variable Results** Not everyone experiences the same benefits. While some users see significant changes in their energy and weight, others report minimal or no results, which could depend on individual metabolism and lifestyle factors.
2. **Dependence on Coffee** Java Burn is specifically formulated for coffee drinkers. If you’re not a fan of coffee, you may find it challenging to integrate this product into your routine.
3. **Price Point** At around $49 per pouch (with discounts on bulk purchases), Java Burn might be considered pricey for some consumers, especially if they don’t see the promised results.
4. **Limited Availability** Currently, Java Burn is only available through its official website, which could be inconvenient for those who prefer purchasing supplements from physical stores or third-party platforms.
5. **Possible Side Effects** A minority of users have reported side effects such as mild digestive discomfort or jitteriness, potentially due to the combination of caffeine and metabolism-boosting ingredients.

# What is Java Burn?

Java Burn is a powdered supplement formulated to mix with your daily coffee. Its main function is to supercharge metabolism and accelerate fat-burning processes. The key differentiator is its compatibility with coffee—leveraging caffeine’s natural properties while adding a blend of weight-loss-enhancing ingredients. Java Burn includes a mix of natural compounds known for their fat-burning potential and ability to regulate blood sugar.

# How Does Java Burn Work?

Java Burn works by increasing your metabolic rate. Combined with coffee, which naturally stimulates metabolism, the ingredients in Java Burn amplify this effect. Caffeine is a well-known stimulant that boosts energy expenditure even when you're at rest, while other components in Java Burn aid in appetite suppression, fat oxidation, and better blood sugar control. Together, they help create a calorie deficit, the cornerstone of effective weight loss.

# Key Ingredients in Java Burn

1. **Green Coffee Bean Extract**: Rich in chlorogenic acid, it boosts metabolism and limits carbohydrate absorption.
2. **Garcinia Cambogia**: Known for its appetite-suppressing properties and its ability to block fat production.
3. **Green Tea Extract**: High in antioxidants and enhances fat oxidation while providing a natural caffeine boost.
4. **Raspberry Ketones**: Helps in breaking down fat and supporting metabolism.
5. **Chromium Picolinate**: Regulates blood sugar levels, helping to curb cravings.
6. **L-Theanine**: Found in green tea, it balances the jittery effects of caffeine and promotes relaxation.

# Benefits of Java Burn

* **Boosts metabolism**: Speeds up the body's calorie-burning processes, even when you're resting.
* **Enhances fat oxidation**: Helps break down stored fat and utilize it as energy.
* **Reduces cravings**: Appetite suppression makes it easier to maintain a calorie deficit.
* **Energy boost**: Increased focus and physical energy, especially during workouts.
* **Balances blood sugar**: Ingredients like chromium picolinate aid in maintaining stable sugar levels.

# Dosage Instructions

Java Burn is designed to be mixed with one cup of coffee daily, preferably in the morning. Continued use over three to six months provides the best results for sustained fat loss and improved metabolism.

# Pros and Cons of Java Burn

# Pros:

* Easy to incorporate into your daily coffee routine.
* Natural, plant-based ingredients with proven fat-burning benefits.
* Enhances both energy levels and metabolism.
* Manufactured in an FDA-approved, GMP-certified facility.

# Cons:

# Conclusion

However, it works best when paired with a balanced diet and regular exercise. If you're looking for a convenient and effective metabolism booster, Java Burn may be the supplement for you.

The key differentiator is its compatibility with coffee—leveraging caffeine’s natural properties while adding a blend of weight-loss-enhancing ingredients. Java Burn includes a mix of natural compounds known for their fat-burning potential and ability to regulate blood sugar.

# How Does Java Burn Work?

Java Burn works by increasing your metabolic rate. Combined with coffee, which naturally stimulates metabolism, the ingredients in Java Burn amplify this effect. Caffeine is a well-known stimulant that boosts energy expenditure even when you're at rest, while other components in Java Burn aid in appetite suppression, fat oxidation, and better blood sugar control. Together, they help create a calorie deficit, the cornerstone of effective weight loss.

2. **Garcinia Cambogia**: Known for its appetite-suppressing properties and its ability to block fat production.
3. **Green Tea Extract**: High in antioxidants and enhances fat oxidation while providing a natural caffeine boost.
4. **Raspberry Ketones**: Helps in breaking down fat and supporting metabolism.
5. **Chromium Picolinate**: Regulates blood sugar levels, helping to curb cravings.

\- I jump on my indoor trampoline or take a brisk walk outside.  
\-  try to clean up most necessary things

\- doing some fun stuff lately belly dance online course and diamond painting.

I'm on the lookout for someone ordinary – someone who can be my partner-in-crime, my confidant, and maybe a bit more, if everything works out. But I'm not in a hurry. I believe in taking things slow, like taking our time to build a connection and get to know each other.

So, what exactly am I seeking? Well, I crave deep conversations and witty banter. I want someone who isn't afraid to open up to each other's emotional insecurities, trauma, let's just try to be real with each other, also someone who can match my curiosity and sense of humor (the darker the better). 

When it comes to interests, I appreciate art of all kinds, I have a deep appreciation for psychedelic art and music. I'm a big arsenal football club fan, also I'm a huge mental health advocate, let's be kind to each other. I enjoy watching critically acclaimed TV shows. I'm fueled by coffee and driven by guilt. Currently on a fitness journey, Trying to be regular at the gym and eating healthy, I would love it I f we could exchange healthy cooking recipes.

But enough about me – I'm very much interested in learning about you. Your likes, icks, tics and everything else. Let's even share our playlists. I would be more than happy it if you could give skin care and hair care tips. 

So, if you're up for intellectually stimulating conversations, sharing funny anecdotes, a genuine connection that transcends the superficial and dives deep into the essence of our beings or simply enjoying the silence of a comfortable conversation, I'm here for it all. Shoot me a DM if you relate and seek something similar.

I recently tried the Attikan Estate blend from Blue Tokai, and while I was disappointed with the taste when mixed with milk, I found it surprisingly good when brewed with just water.

I prefer dark-flavored coffee and usually drink it with milk (I love a milkshake-like taste). I've also tried Channi Brew, but I'm still looking for something bold, rich, and that pairs well with milk.

I'm having quite hard time keeping my cadence up for this faaaaast moving, quick-changing and extremely impersonal world, so therefore I've realized that apps are not my thing.. I can actually explain more about myself here. So yeah, let's give this a chance :))

I'd say I'm a funny, energetic ,sarcastic and yet chill, calm and somewhat depressive type of guy . I care about my looks, I know what I want from life, partner, work .. anything.. I have my matters in order. I know this sounds very disciplined and rigid but I have sooo much leeway for anything and everything.

I like to spend my time with loads of stuff like, having a pint with friends every now and then, going to gym 3 times a week, playing games, watching movies/series, playing guitar, reading books, lying down on the rug watching the ceiling while listening to Pink Floyd.. Idk there's loads of stuff :D

I also enjoy deep chats, philosophy and endless banter especially no-holds-barred type of banters are fun.. honestly any no-holds convo can turn into something funny LOL :D

I'd say I'm quite caring, protective, solution-oriented, open to communicate and more than anything straightforward guy .. but as you might've guessed already those just doesn't come from the day one.. feelings are feelings because we can't control them , right ?

Maybe we can walk in the parks holding hands talking about the movie we watched yesterday and analyse the characters ? We can read poets to each other and maybe learn different things every other day and share them? We can prank each other , come up with weird jokes to see the reaction :D .. all those lovely stuff.. live in a wee village and have late nite drives together ? We can go for an ice-cream at 3 am and settle for a terrible garage coffee LOL .. We can watch true-crime or horror but don't worry I'll watch family guy with you if that's too scary :D 

What I'm looking for ?

I'd say someone who has her life in somewhat order , who's in touch with her emotions, who's honest or should I say blunt (in a nice way :D ) , who's loyal and who's curious about things in life.. who knows what she wants.

I'd say I'm an ambivert so I like going out for gigs, stand-ups, pints with peeps, but also love to have a coz night in so would prefer someone who'd be okay with this kind of cadence.

Things I think could be deal-breaker for some people:

\- I'm Atheist. But I do respect to religions as long as the respect is mutual and it's not your total personality

\- Got 4 tattoos.

Other stuff :

188cm (6 2 )tall , 90 kg (200 pounds) , fit but no abs LOL \*crying in distance\* , green eyes, caucasian, brown hair (with a blonde undertone), beard and moustache

Ultimately I'm looking for something profound, deep and love-fueled... but yeah let's start by being friends, and then let's see where we can lead it !",2,1732364918.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I've found that stimulant-based treatments like Adderall XR worked great for my mental clarity. I would take it and the medication gave me a wakefulness and clarity that really was a blessing.

The opposite can be said of coffee. I used to drink a LOT of coffee and I realize now that the coffee may have been what has been making me feel like shit. My brain associates coffee with energy and wakefulness but when I drink coffee I'll end up feeling foggy or groggy.

As I said we are very close and attend the same school. Long story short 18F loves drinking and always mentions drinking and going out whenever we are together. Sometimes I feel like being friends with her is hard because if I ever hangout with her it means I will have to spend money on alcohol. 

I was invited by 18F to go to her friends house this Saturday to drink. I thought it would be nice to meet new people and so I agreed. I asked how their friends were and she said they are nice and there would be a lot of shots. She asked her friends if I could join this Saturday because she thinks I am funny when I am drunk so it would be very fun to have me at her friends house.

Yesterday, she decided to go and buy vodka between classes and I'm not going to lie I thought it would be funny to do it so we drank a little bit. I'm lightweight so I tried my hardest to survive my last class and she just said bye after class and left with her other friends. I went home drunk and then immediately fell asleep. When I woke up I felt very sick and had a horrible migraine. That is when I started questioning my life choices. I don't enjoy this! I don't want to drink every weekend and constantly be pressured to drink... 

I don't remember having a deep converstion with 18F ever since we became friends. Me, 18F and 20M once tried to go to movies just to do something different than just drinking and guess what, she decided to buy herself 3 bottles of vodka and drank it inside the movie theatre. I was so disappointed after. Sometimes I want to go to a cafe and have a hot chocolate or coffee and talk about different topics but I just know that hanging out with her means the conversation will somehow lead to when we will drink again.

She also invited all of us to Thailand next summer and asked us to collect money. I am starting a new major next year and I was really considering if I am going to actually have fun in this trip or be disappointed after collecting my money or if I should just save money to buy me a new PC, phone and supplies before I start my new year in college! I feel like I am getting sick of all this partying and drinking. I want to settle down and do something to educate myself and get back to my hobbies that I haven't been practising for a while. 

This morning, I decided to text her saying I was sick and that I am not coming to hangout with her. It was a half lie because I was sick.

I miss the times you would let me take care of you and make cute little gestures for you. I miss the time you allowed me to send you snacks. I miss the times you would let me give you my jacket because you were cold. I miss the times you would let me carry your bag because you were tired. I miss the time you allowed me to come over and take care of you when your period was really bad. I miss the times when you needed my help and I could help you. I miss the times I could help you heal and overcome your traumas. I miss the times when I was able to make you the happiest. I miss the times when I was able to give you all the love in the world. I miss the times we would say we would be together forever. I miss how hopeful you were about us and our future. I miss how you always used to say everything would work out for us. I miss the times you would miss me. I miss so much more than these. I miss everything about you. I miss everything about us. I miss every moment of the last three years we had, every moment ever since we sat next to each other in class that first time. I miss how caring we were even back then. I miss how you would feel so comfortable with me even back then that you would fall asleep on my shoulder in class. I miss how you would let me give you my sweatshirt when the class was cold and I could convince you I wasn't cold. I miss how we would go out to meet, or how I would come over and we would spend time together. I miss how you would tell me to call you cool instead of cute because it made you embarrassed. I miss how we made spotify playlists of songs that reminded us of each other. I miss how that one fan fiction about lu guang and cheng xiaoshi made me think of us and made me wish we would also be together like that one day. I miss how we slowly fell in love more and more with each other every day until we couldn't keep it inside. I miss how we overcame our fears to be together. I miss every happy memory we created after we finally got together after pining for each other for so long. I miss you and us so so so so much. Please don't let this missing be forever. Please tell me you still love me. Please tell me you miss me too. I know I should have thought of all of this before you had to leave me but.. please give me a chance to make it all right. Please tell me you can forgive me one last time and give the new me a chance, a chance to show you I can change, a chance to show you I would never hurt you like that again, a chance to show you I can make you happy like that again. Please tell me you can allow me to fix everything I broke. Please give me a chance to bring that spark and happiness back to our life. Please give me a chance to make things right this time. Please let us have these happy memories again. Please don't let everything end like this when we had so many dreams to live together. Please let me come back to your life. I miss you so very much my love.",1,1732364564.0,letters,1,1.0,False

Hey guys, sorry I don’t have a better picture use. I’m looking for a recommendation (Amazon links would be nice) on a reusable water bottle that can fit in the cup holder of the cab. I am an engineer for the LIRR and I only have this problem on our C3 Cab Car’s and our M3 and M7 multiple units. No issue with our DE/DM engines or our M9s. The cup holder in these two cabs is only wide enough to fit a standard soda can or a small cup of coffee you could buy from 7-Eleven or any convenience store. Even my slimmest YETI cup or my Adidas sports bottle does not fit in this cup holder because it’s too wide. I am not concerned about the quality of the insulation, because I don’t mind room temperature water. I just want something that can fit (again, no wider than a soda can) and will stay nice and sealed so it doesn’t leak in my bag.

","**A Future Written in Sunsets and Porch Swing Stories**

Imagine this: it’s the summer of 2054. We’re on the porch of a cozy house—one of those timeless places where the steps creak like old memories and the swing hums softly in the evening breeze. The sky is a canvas of gold and fire, and we’re there, painting it with laughter and shared stories. The kind of tales that weave themselves into your soul: travels that shaped us, mishaps that made us laugh, and quiet moments where no words were needed—just the warmth of each other’s company.

It’s not about grand adventures every day, but about finding magic in the ordinary—the way the sunset turns the edges of the world golden or how a shared silence can feel louder than words. Now, I’m here searching for the co-author of this future. Could it be you?

# A Little About Me

I’m a contradiction wrapped in curiosity. A writer of thoughts, a collector of sunsets, and a seeker of those fleeting moments that remind us how beautiful the world can be. Quiet at first, but if you’re patient, you’ll find someone who speaks in passions and listens like it’s the most important thing they could ever do.

Right now, I’m looking for **a friendship** that feels like the first chapter of a well-worn book—something natural, unforced, where we build a connection page by page. I believe the best stories begin with a spark of understanding, and maybe, just maybe, they grow into something more.

**Here’s what makes my story unique:**

🎵 **Music as a Muse:** Vinyl collections, road trip playlists, and songs that feel like home. Music has a way of connecting moments, and I love finding the soundtrack to life’s best memories. Got a favorite tune? Share it—I’m always ready to discover the melodies that move you.  
🌍 **Adventure in My Veins:** Whether it’s chasing the perfect golden-hour light, wandering through unfamiliar streets, or hiking trails that lead to breathtaking views, I’m all about exploring the world—both near and far. Life’s too short not to follow the whispers of adventure.  
📚 **Wordsmith at Heart:** Writing is my way of capturing the fleeting and the unforgettable. I love playing with words until they reflect the emotions I can’t quite say aloud. And recently, I’ve been dabbling in photography—turning moments into memories through a lens.  
🕹️ **Low-Key Gamer:** When the world feels too loud, there’s something comforting about a quiet night in with a good game or a classic movie marathon.

# What Sets Me Apart

I see life as a tapestry of little details: the way sunlight dances on leaves, the rhythm of rain on a quiet afternoon, or the poetry of a shared moment that feels too good to end. I’ll notice the way your eyes light up when you talk about something you love, and I’ll make a mental note of your favorite coffee order—not because I have to, but because I want to.

Loyalty is my cornerstone. I’ll show up, not just in the big moments, but in the small ones too—the random text when I know you’re having a rough day, the laughter when you need a distraction, or simply being there when you feel like the world isn’t. The best stories aren’t about grand gestures; they’re about the quiet consistency of someone who’s truly there for you.

I’m also a romantic—not in the cliché way, but in the way that makes you feel seen. Sweet gestures, thoughtful words, and a knack for making everyday moments feel special. I’m the kind of person who’ll leave you a note in your favorite book, point out constellations during a midnight drive, or turn a casual Sunday into something unforgettable.

And when it comes to connection, I value honesty above all. If something’s on your mind, I’ll always want to hear it. Because real stories—the ones worth telling—are built on truth, not games.

# What About You?

Are you the kind of person who finds beauty in the cracks of everyday life? Who laughs easily, dreams deeply, and values honesty like a rare gem? Maybe you’re someone who savors both the quiet moments and the spontaneous ones—a cozy evening in or a bold adventure out.

Let’s start as friends, as kindred spirits who share an appreciation for the world’s quirks and wonders. Maybe we’ll swap stories, exchange playlists, or even embark on an adventure or two. And if the story decides to write itself into something more, we’ll let it—after all, the best tales often begin with an unexpected chapter.

If this resonates, let’s start the first line of what could be an unforgettable story. One filled with porch swings, golden sunsets, and the kind of connection that makes you believe in the magic of “what if.” Let’s see where the words take us.",2,1732363846.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False
