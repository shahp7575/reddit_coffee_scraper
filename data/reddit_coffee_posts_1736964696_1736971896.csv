I don‚Äôt think I can talk about this to anyone so I‚Äôm pouring it here. 
Today 15th was pay day as most of us know. I paid all my bills, was short on food money but that I can manage by stretching our meals and I‚Äôm left after everything with 30‚Ç¨. What can I do with that? Eat lunch at work? I don‚Äôt anyway as I take my own food. Have coffees? Won‚Äôt be enough. I was hoping to sign for this workout class that costs 48‚Ç¨ but I can‚Äôt even afford that. 
That‚Äôs not why I started crying tho. 
I have been here in Finland for 11 years now. I speak Finnish I work a specialist job and has been an active member of the community. I love it here but man oh man how sometimes I get frustrated when I see how others live. So I know a lady who is also an immigrant living here for 11 years too never worked a day in her life even before moving here and she had the audacity to throw a big tantrum because she don‚Äôt feel that she needs to pay for dentist appointment she had.. this lady has been getting unemployment funding and apartment subsidy her whole stay here. What Kela doesn‚Äôt know is that she has been getting money from abroad too in a foreign bank account and is living way more than comfortable as no typical even highly educated specialist would have 4000‚Ç¨ after tax in Finland. I got a bit sad as this has flipped me off . I haven‚Äôt been able to see my family for two years now because I can‚Äôt afford flights while she‚Äôs going to London to get her Botox next week. I‚Äôm sorry I know this sounds terrible and I‚Äôm ashamed of having these feelings but I don‚Äôt know what else to do. Last week she needed help with her new Finnish bank‚Äôs app (which Kela doesn‚Äôt know about) so she asked me to help her. I wasn‚Äôt peeking or anything I was literally helping her and she gave me the rights to set it up for her and I saw she has over 10k in a savings account. 
I have been working for 11+ years and I have 0,29‚Ç¨ in my savings account. She genuinely think it is unfair for her to pay for dentist appointment. I don‚Äôt know what to say to her. I listened to her complaining and excused myself kindly cause I didn‚Äôt want to flip on her. I kinda know that what she‚Äôs doing is illegal (is it?) but honestly I don‚Äôt think she sees anything wrong with it‚Ä¶ I never and will never wish less on others and I‚Äôm not here to teach anyone a lesson.
Sorry for the rant but I don‚Äôt know why I got these feelings this strong. Maybe because I felt that because I work so hard everyday and do my part at least I should be able to afford to see my mom and nephews this summer which doesn‚Äôt seem like a possibility. I have no idea how to feel or what to do about all these emotions.. I‚Äôm sure hard work someday will pay off üíî

1i26d7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i26d7l/i_almost_cheated_on_my_fianc√©e_today/,I almost cheated on my Fianc√©e today...,"Throwaway account for discretion.

TLDR: I almost cheated on my Fianc√©e today by arranging to meet a guy through Grindr. I changed my mind, just before I stepped inside his apartment.

Context:
I (Male) am engaged to my Fianc√©e (Fem) and we get married in a few months. I love her so much, she is the reason I'm still here, and I cant wait to someday have our own family together.
Unfortunately she is not very sexually active. She in fact is quite frigid, despite being open about wanting kids someday (as do I). 
We have discussed things at great length over the years, such as why this might be, and whether she is attracted to me or not (she claims she is). She has never experienced any trauma, such as sexual abuse or anything of the sort, and is unable to provide an explanation to why she seemingly is not sexually active.
She hates the idea of masturbating herself, and also finds it gross when I masturbate beside her in bed, because I'm sexually built up. And generally doesn't like the fact I masturbate anyway. She doesn't engage in much intimacy in general. Usually when I lean in for a kiss, she responds with a peck on the lips and immediately draws away after. Whereas, I would usually be wanting a slightly longer more passionate kiss.
She has told me that my love language is touch, and hers are acts of generosity. She is so selfless and always offers to do things for me, which I think is sweet, and I always (through my love language) tell her how much I love her, and am never afraid to show affection.

The Affair Websites:
I am often left feeling lonely. And a few months back I joined AshleyMadison. I paid a lot of money and eventually I matched with a few women. One of which I ended up forming a friendship with. We texted and snapchatted, sexted A LOT, but also became friends, and talked about life in general. One day we arranged to meet up for a coffee as friends, and I secretly hoped something would happen. It ended up being a very innocent coffee and we went for a walk to a nearby castle, discussing life. Nothing happened, except for a very brief hug before we said goodbye. We are still in touch, but have agreed not to let anything happen between us. She understands that I was seeking a friend, and is happy to remain a friend. But she also said that she could tell I didn't really want to cheat, and that I should focus on my relationship. She's now in a relationship with someone else, and I regularly check in on her, and she also checks in on me.

Fast forward a few months to this week:
I joined Grindr.
I have been with my Fianc√©e most of my adult life, and therefore have never had a male partner. I am a closeted Bisexual (She knows) and have always fantasised about sexual encounters with men. I have told her about my some of my fantasies, including these.
I joined Grindr and began messaging men, as well as receiving lots of messages. Today after work I was sat in the car and one of them asked me to come over. After a lot of deliberation and pent up sexual frustration I drove to his apartment. He buzzed me in, and was waiting for me with the front door open and standing in a dressing gown.
Once I saw him, I just said ""I'm sorry, mate"" and went back to my car and drove home.
I don't know if I changed my mind because he wasn't quite as attractive facially as I had seen in his photos, or if it was because of guilt. 
I know for certain I was fearful of STDs, and I my adrenaline was through the roof.
With regards to my not being attracted to him in person, this wasn't something I had considered beforehand because I only saw NSFW pictures of him.

I am now home, in the bathroom typing this out. Overridden with guilt.
I just want to have my needs met. But I also want to continue staying in my relationship with my Fianc√©e. I feel as though I am stuck.
Part of me tries to justify that purely sex is just to meet my needs, and then I can still be a good husband and father to our future kids. It will never stop me loving them. But the guilt is very difficult to overcome

I've felt the soreness of working out many times before and this is not it. The weird part is I haven't don't anything that would cause my muscles to be sore, I haven't worked out or anything recently yet I've been experiencing this pain for 3 weeks now and it hasnt gone away. I just feel weak. I've never experienced this before so I looked up reasons that might cause this and started researching into fibromyalgia and it seems I might a lot of the symptoms and that these issues can apparently flare up later in life even tho its a chronic condition.

For example I've had issues with chronic headaches and migraines for nearly 5-6 years now but I just figured it was because I was unhealthy and drank a lot of soda beverages and coffee which caused caffein withdraw headaches or something. But even when I only drank water for a long period of time I would still experience these headaches.

I've also had a lot of issues with both depression and anxiety that hits me like a truck. I can be happy for a few days and then suddenly I feel depressed and fatigued for seemingly no reason. I thought this may be due to ADHD or bipolar but I've not been tested for anything like that so I wouldn't know.

I've always had issues sleeping since I was a kid, sometimes being restless in my sleep and waking up after like 4-5 hours and not being able to go back to sleep no matter what. My father has sleep apnea apparently which is something we both recently learned about and I figure I may have the same issues since I do find myself waking up gasping for breath sometimes. I've seen that sleep apnea can often coincide with fibromyalgia as well.

I may just be worrying over nothing from searching online about this but a lot of it is lining up with chronic conditions I've had, the exception being the muscle pains I'm suddenly plagued with. I also know it's probably relatively rare in my instance (I'm a 23yo Male). My family is very much a ""no doctors, just tough through it"" kind of people so I haven't been tested for anything since I was a kid but I'm thinking maybe I should just fork up the cash to get tested.

MASSIVE RANT/VENT!!!


Hi. I‚Äôm a 25 year old woman and I‚Äôm currently studying to be a nurse. 
I have spend the last 6 months taking the ‚Äòbasics‚Äô online and I just now started the physical school this Monday - and I‚Äôm already losing my mind and very much looking forward to the apprenticeship parts of this education. 

1. How come some people don‚Äôt seem to shower very often and care about hygiene? 
Although most of the students are women, the entire room reeks of sweat and unwashed hair. I notice that a lot of the people are also wearing the same clothes as they did on the first day, which I have determined based on the fact that the same stains are there, which was caused by the rain on Monday/the muddy grass we had to walk on during our ‚Äòchat to different people while going on a walk and make friends‚Äô. It hasn‚Äôt rained since. 
In this case, I am not talking about people who struggle with mental health and therefore have issues with personal hygiene, because I am in no way looking to mock that! 
I also know that I am probably a little too obsessed with my hygiene, showering and drowning myself in deodorant, creams and perfumes, but I just don‚Äôt understand how they can be comfortable leaving a cloud of unpleasantness behind them, when they walk past? 

2: Talking loudly on the phone and/or FaceTiming out loud with your kids during every single break or every time the teacher leaves for a moment? 
Has it really become acceptable to sit and have phone conversations and put the other person on speaker, while sitting inside a classroom with 20 other people, where some are trying to study? And why are there 3 people doing it at the same time, while some of the other students are also having loud conversations with each other? 

3: Why does everything eatable and drinkable have to smell so strong? 
I think it‚Äôs fine to bring coffee, a basic pastry, an apple and so on to class. But I don‚Äôt understand why more than ten people have to drink different kinds of energy drink all day long - they smell horrific, artificial and way too sweet. It actually gives me a headache, having to smell redbull and all the other brands for 8 hours a day, along with cheesy pasta, sausages, egg sandwiches and left overs of spicy meats. I may be mostly vegan and very boring with my food and drink, but why on earth bring the smelliest things in an inclosed room, when there is literally a cafeteria and other places to eat?

I realise that all of this make me seem very stuck up and possibly a horrible person and like I‚Äôm mocking people. This is not my intention, and I understand that it‚Äôs me who has Autism, ADHD and OCD, which no one there knows that I have - they are just acting and doing what is right for them, and I totally get that they have a right to do that. 
I simply just don‚Äôt know how to deal with it - I wake up dreading to go, because the combination of constant noise and mix of bad smells makes me so overstimulated, which leads to anxiety and I have panic attack every single evening this week, when I can finally ‚Äòrelax‚Äô. My relaxing time turns into a time of shaking, headaches, crying and feeling physically sick, and then finally the panic attacks which makes me think I‚Äôm gonna die for the time they last. I can‚Äôt find peace at all, I sleep badly and all I can think about while I‚Äôm in school is a combination of not being able to sit still and wanting to run out of the room as fast as I can and telling myself not to fall into anxiety and just ignore everything going on. 
I am aware that my ADHD also doesn‚Äôt help, because listening to a lecturer speak for so many hours is just impossible for me. But I KNOW it would be easier, if it wasn‚Äôt for all the other things happening as well. 

Have anyone experienced this? 
And if so, what helped you to shift your focus and actually be able to attend without feeling so horrible 24/7, both in the school and also after? 
I am feeling so stupid and childish for complaining about this, but I seriously don‚Äôt know what to do üò£",2,1736971358.0,autism,1,1.0,False

Ever found yourself slumping over your keyboard, back aching, and neck stiff after a long day at the office? You're not alone. But here's a secret: it doesn't have to be that way. In fact, there's a simple solution that could transform your workspace and your well-being - an ergonomic chair. So, why should you buy an ergonomic chair for your office? Let's dive in and find out together, shall we? Remember, your comfort and productivity are worth investing in, and today, we're going to explore just why that is. So, grab a cup of coffee, and let's get started on this ergonomic adventure!
  
  
## The Anatomy of an Ergonomic Chair

Ever tried to spend an entire day in a chair that‚Äôs just not right? Picture this: me, a proud member of the ‚ÄúToo Many Hours Spent at a Desk Club,‚Äù haphazardly plopping myself onto a chair that looked innocent enough. By midday, I felt like the Hunchback of Notre-Dame, all slouched and miserable. I‚Äôve learned my lesson since! 

An ergonomic chair is your bestie in the fight against office aches. Let‚Äôs break down why these chairs can be life-savers. For starters, adjustable height. This feature is simple yet revolutionary. Whether you‚Äôre tall like a giraffe or short like a garden gnome, you need a chair that can adapt to you, not the other way around. If not, well, hello, back pain!

Then, there‚Äôs the lumbar support. Think of this as the gentle hug your lower back never knew it wanted. It keeps your spine in its happy place, promoting good posture as you type away or scroll through memes during your lunch break. I've used chairs lacking lumbar support, and let‚Äôs just say my back started staging a protest.

Don‚Äôt forget those armrests! They shouldn‚Äôt feel like medieval torture devices, but rather a cozy spot for your arms to chill. Oh, and if you think you can survive without them, try typing with your arms dangling for hours‚Äîtrust me, it‚Äôs not pretty. So, do yourself a favor, and give those ergonomic chairs a shot! Who wouldn't want to be comfortable and stylish at the same time?

## The Science Behind Ergonomics

Have you ever found yourself slumped in your chair, shoulders hunched like a turtle retreating into its shell, while working through yet another mountain of emails? Yeah, I‚Äôve been there too. The science behind ergonomics is like that wise old friend who quietly nudges you to sit up straight and take care of your body, because, let‚Äôs face it, it ain‚Äôt getting any younger! Ergonomics is all about designing your workspace to fit YOU, making sure that your muscles and joints don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôve just run a marathon when you get off work.

When you sit in an ergonomic chair, it supports your lumbar spine, which is just a fancy way of talking about your lower back‚Äîthose poor, hard-working lumbar muscles that bear the brunt of too much slouching. And don‚Äôt even get me started on your neck and shoulders; if they could talk, they'd probably ask for a vacation in Barbados! Seriously, I learned from a physiotherapist that when we sit properly, we reduce the strain on our muscles and joints by up to 30%. That‚Äôs a lot less discomfort to deal with!

Honestly, once I understood that an ergonomic setup isn‚Äôt just some buzzword but actually science, it hit home for me. I started looking at my chair like a trusty steed, ready to carry me through long hours at work without riding me hard into the ground. I was so used to just ‚Äúmaking it work,‚Äù like a cat trying to squeeze into a box designed for a dog‚Äîit just didn‚Äôt cut it! Giving my body the support it deserves has been nothing short of a game changer.

## Ergonomic Chairs: A Game-Changer for Productivity

You ever find yourself slumped over your desk, staring at your screen like it‚Äôs a pop quiz you didn‚Äôt study for? Believe me, I‚Äôve been there too! A comfy chair can seriously change the game, especially when it comes to productivity. Once I swapped my old, creaky chair for an ergonomic one, it was like flipping a switch. Suddenly, I wasn‚Äôt just in my office; I was ready to conquer the world‚Äîor at least finish that daunting project.

Imagine this: I had a deadline breathing down my neck, and I was battling both exhaustion and discomfort. My posture? Let's just say it left a lot to be desired. Then, I settled into my new ergonomic chair, and let me tell you, it felt like being cradled by a supportive cloud. Not only did my back thank me later, but my brain seemed to wake up, too. I powered through the project, and the words flowed like a river instead of a trickle. 

Have you ever noticed how a comfortable chair can make a world of difference in your focus? It‚Äôs not just about looking like a boss in a fancy chair; it's about boosting your energy levels so you can tackle whatever comes your way. Trust me, investing in an ergonomic chair might just be the best decision you make for your productivity‚Äîand your back!

## The Long-Term Benefits of Ergonomic Chairs

When I first switched to an ergonomic chair, I thought I was indulging in some fancy office decor. But let me tell you, that fancy chair turned out to be my secret weapon against discomfort! Sure, it may look like just another piece of furniture, but investing in one is like investing in your own superhero cape‚Äîonly instead of fighting crime, you're battling back pain, poor posture, and all those pesky aches that come from sitting too long.

Picture this: I used to slouch in my old chair, feeling like a pretzel by midday. My back was constantly yelling, ‚ÄúHelp!‚Äù and I‚Äôd find myself taking frequent coffee breaks‚Äîmostly to stretch and walk around like a zombie. But since I‚Äôve embraced ergonomic bliss, it‚Äôs like my back threw a parade in my honor! I've noticed improved circulation, too, which I believe is my body thanking me for not torturing it anymore. 

Investing in an ergonomic chair might seem like a splurge, but think about it this way: it saves you from future doctor appointments and those awkward moments trying to find a comfy position on the couch after a long day. Plus, nobody wants to join the ‚ÄúBack Pain Club,‚Äù right? So, trust me, your future self will definitely thank you.

## Ergonomic Chairs: A Design Lover's Dream

When I first laid my eyes on an ergonomic chair, I felt like I had stumbled into a design lover's paradise. It was sleek, stylish, and dare I say, a little fancy! Have you ever fallen in love with a chair at first sight? Yup, I have. It was the kind of chair that could make you feel all-cool-and-hip while also whispering sweet nothings to your lower back. 

Now, ergonomic chairs come in all forms and materials. Some look like they jumped straight out of a spaceship while others seem to have a cozy vibe. I mean, I‚Äôve seen chairs that look like they were designed by a Dr. Seuss character ‚Äì but hey, if it works, it works! These gems not only promise comfort but also add a sprinkle of charm to your office space. 

Think about it: a chair can be a style statement! Whether it‚Äôs leather that smells like a fancy car or breathable mesh that keeps you cooler than a cucumber on a summer day, the options are endless. And let's not forget colors! You can go for something bold, like bright red, or mellow, like calming blue. Ultimately, your ergonomic chair can be more than a seat; it can be a piece of art that screams, ""I take my work seriously, but I still know how to have fun!""

## Making the Switch: Tips for Choosing Your Perfect Ergonomic Chair

Choosing the right ergonomic chair is like picking the perfect pizza topping‚Äîeverybody has their preference, but if you don‚Äôt put some thought into it, you might end up with something you can‚Äôt stand to sit on! When diving into the world of ergonomic chairs, the first thing to consider is your height and weight. It‚Äôs essential to select a chair that can support your size, kind of like finding a pair of shoes that won‚Äôt pinch your toes during a long day.

Next up, think about your specific needs. Do you have back pain? Or maybe your neck starts to ache after too many Zoom calls? Look for adjustable lumbar support and armrests that move up and down as if they were auditioning for a role in your ergonomics movie! 

Spend some time testing out the chairs‚Äîsit in them like you‚Äôre trying them on for size. And if you can‚Äôt bring that chair home right away, remember: the perfect chair waits for no one! You‚Äôre not just buying a chair; you‚Äôre making a commitment. So, make it count!

I‚Äôve been using an Aeropress as my only coffee maker for over a year now, and I‚Äôm looking to get a second coffee maker to explore more of the coffee world. My main goal is to be able to brew 2-4 cups at a time since the Aeropress can be a bit limiting for that.

I‚Äôm used to drinking milk-based beverages like lattes, but I want to start shifting towards enjoying filtered coffee. Because of this, I‚Äôm considering getting a pour-over coffee maker like the V60, Chemex, Origami, or Fellow Stagg.

In my country, the variety of coffee gear is somewhat limited, so these are the only options I‚Äôve found so far. I also don‚Äôt have a gooseneck kettle yet, so I‚Äôd need to get one as well‚Äîprobably one that can be used on a stovetop.

Do you have any recommendations on which pour-over maker to choose? Or tips for getting started with pour-over brewing?

We have a high needs dog that needs to be drilled daily, and gets a walk/hike/run by husband depending on the day and weather. Sometimes I‚Äôd like to be the one to walk her without baby, I haven‚Äôt done that since being pregnant and I miss it. 

For context, this is our first .. LO is 5 months old, EBF, cosleep/bedsharing + nurse to sleep, contact naps. I do have baby carriers, but he still doesn‚Äôt really like napping in them and will fight hard, requiring lots of shushing and bouncing. Sometimes I will cave and nurse to contact nap because I can‚Äôt handle him screaming üòî

I do nights solo, and rarely get relief in the AM. If I do, I‚Äôm rushing to make breakfast before my husband starts calls. He wakes up, works out for an hour each day, takes the dog for activity for an hour sometimes more. He‚Äôll make sure coffee is made, and make another tea right before he hops on, but I cannot count on him to help with meals. I‚Äôve begged, nagged .. he will change his ways for a day or two and go back to the same thing. He straight up won‚Äôt eat all day, this was a problem before baby and I‚Äôve stressed the importance of eating enough to maintain my supply but nothing ever changes. 

Before baby, I was the only cook and made our meals from scratch, we rarely get take out or eat processed foods. He works in tech 9-5 but his schedule can be flexible at times, often he has an hour or two lunch. I‚Äôve gotten very little help with making food since baby was born, I‚Äôm beyond frustrated. The only times I really get a ‚Äúbreak‚Äù from baby are making dinner before scrambling to get myself ready for bed time. 

Baby had a birth injury which has resulted in PPA/PPD. Once that was *finally* calming down, he‚Äôs had some bad eczema crop up that we‚Äôre trying to get a handle on. Since then, sleep has been atrocious. I‚Äôll get baby down between 730-9 and he will wake every 30-90 minutes starting around 11/12. Sometimes I have to resettle him for an hour because when I unlatch he‚Äôll try to scratch his face. This goes on repeat all night, with me being the only one. Husband says he needs to be able to sleep to function and earn income. He‚Äôll say ‚Äúhow can I help‚Äù but I‚Äôm a broken record .. the same things .. I need sleep, I need to eat, please help vacuum the dog hair, please help with basic things like laundry. I have to nag, not ask, for help, constantly. 

I‚Äôve told him I feel like I‚Äôm breaking, never getting a break isn‚Äôt sustainable. I thought I‚Äôd be in a better rhythm at this point, but I feel like the morning is a sprint and I can‚Äôt catch my breath. Since baby isnt sleeping at night, he‚Äôs taking very long contact naps during the day. I‚Äôd like to just get my basic needs met for hygiene and nourishment. I‚Äôve had a total of 5 one hour naps without baby since giving birth. 

Husband wants to be in bed by 930, stretches every night, reads + writes to wind down. 

This morning I had a melt down .. we have zero family and zero friends for support. The sleep deprivation is stacking up. He told me to ‚Äúknock it off‚Äù while in full crisis mode. I feel utterly defeated. 

Is this normal? If so, damn this is so hard. I‚Äôm ok with sacrificing for my child, but I‚Äôm so heartbroken that I can‚Äôt trust or rely on my husband for more help. ",2,1736971058.0,AttachmentParenting,1,1.0,False

I'm looking for the name of a game I played about a year ago that's about an investigator looking into a missing person's case. The case itself revolves around an alien that went missing, and the only lead they have is an object that the investigator has to inject their brain into in order to experience the alien's memories from their perspective to try and find clues as to where they are/went. I specifically remember one scene in the game early on, the alien is being taken into a coffee shop for a short talk, and instead of ordering coffee, they order orange juice. All the human models have their heads replaced with odd imagery, I believe.



Platform: PC  
  
Genre: Point and Click Adventure/Mystery  
Year of Release: I believe 2023  
  
Art Style: Grainy and polygonal. I believe the game was drawn in MS Paint? Though I could be wrong.  
  
Characters: An alien that integrated into human society, an investigator mind-diving into said alien's computer terminal, a helper agent who the investigator frequently speaks to, an AI for said computer terminal occasionally assisting the investigator  
  
Gameplay Mechanics: Maps and locations very frequently extend past the boundaries of the window's screen, and require scrolling. Occasionally traverses locations with wasd on a grid pattern, very very similar resemblance to older Shin Megami Tensei game movement.

Other: There was a boss fight in the game about taking down a rogue AI that thought itself to be a god. The boss itself was a game that required the user to move the cursor through a maze of damaging walls, and needed to avoid touching any of the walls to get to the boss.",1,1736970926.0,tipofmyjoystick,0,1.0,False

The melancholic, foggy malaise I sit with everyday is both troublesome and yet how I honor him.","7 weeks ago today, the day before Thanksgiving, I lost my second dad. [I've posted about him before for those curious.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1hdeu5q/i_understand_how_he_died_im_just_not_ready_to/).

He was my uncle officially, but he was a second dad to me, a best friend, the blood of my blood. I'm one of 6 kids and have both my parents. He felt as close to me as they all do. My dad is also one of 6 kids, but this brother was his soul mate. 

He passed suddenly of a heart attack. 57 years old. Dropped at his job one day. Two weeks of up and down health updates. He was trending up. Then that day, he trended down, down, down. I was on my way in with my little family for Thanksgiving, to see him in the hospital as I live 8 hours away. He died when I was 3 hours away.

The holidays were overall shattered for me. I kept as happy of a face as I could for my little ones. I made sure their Christmas was magical, and it was. But the heaviness was always lingering like a ghost. 

Christmas day, while walking past my backdoor, which leads to a set of stairs up my backyard to my parents' driveway, my idiot fucking brain convinced itself he pulled up in his iconic blue Jeep, and was coming down the stairs. Like he pulled the ultimate ""GOTCHA! I'm here!"" moment. 15 minutes later, I was sobbing in the shower at the realization that I would never see him come down those stairs again. 

The holidays this year were like a 12 day away from home event. Non stop socializing, traveling. We got back to our house January 1st and I immediately took the Christmas stuff down that weekend. My family had the flu, I avoided it. I took it down by myself. ""Wait a few days to let me help you, babe"" my coughing wife said. No, I need it gone now. I need to be rid of this reminder for now.

It's been two weeks since we've been home, and the general malaise I'm in is hard to describe. I can't feel up, and I don't get too down. I don't know that I feel anything, which is rare for me. I'm either very high or very low. Not ""I don't wanna live"" low, moreso ""everything fucking hurts"" low. I thought it would be more like that, and it's not. It's worse almost. 

I feel a bit catatonic honestly. I'm avoiding sentimentality that isn't directly to my kids or wife. Sentimental show, movie, song? I won't do it. Can't do it. 

I'm impervious to any of my usual emotional firestarters. There's a fucking authoritarian taking office in a few days who I oppose with every fiber of my nature, and the best I can muster is...whatever. I don't give a fuck. Fuck him, but also life is unfair and cruel. People will get what they deserve. This is yet another example. Oh well. I'm going to make coffee. 

""Look at pictures of him"". I can't and won't. Not yet. ""Read that letter he gave to you before you moved"" my brain whispers. Ha, nice try. 

I described it to my wife that it's like I'm stuck in standstill traffic. There is no backwards movement, but there is no forewords movement either. I'm not feeling any real joy for things, but I'm not feeling any real pain. 

My mind feels like it's settled on the matter. I've lost something too big to ever pretend things will go back to any normalcy. There is a before and after now. I'm in the after. I fucking hate it, but I'm helpless to change it. 

And honestly? The thought of ""moving on"" is disrespectful to not only him, but to me. I move on from ex girlfriends. I move on from graduating college. I move on from my team losing a huge game. I move on from losing headphones I just spent a lot of money on. 

Can you move on from a loss so great as this? 

This malaise is how I honor him. This burning anger at the cruelty and unfairness of life is how I honor him. The heaviness I now carry is how I honor him. 

If it means this is my life forever going forward, I'm ok with that. Or I'm at least resolved to the idea. If I knew God existed, or some supreme being was responsible for this, and knew I could take vengeance, I would. 

He doesn't, and I can't. So this is the next best thing maybe. 

Regardless, I'm fucking tired of the notion that I need to move on. Go forward. 

I wanna stay right here in this fucking traffic. It's the only way I know how to honor him and also give two giant middle fingers to life. You can't make me do anything I don't want to do. I will not move on. I will sit in it and bear it, but I will not pretend life can be normal again. 

It is not, and I am not. We are not.

We love you, Davey boy. If you're reading this, seeing this, seeing us, know we're all collectively miserable here on earth as an honor to your place in our lives. And nothing will change that.",2,1736970740.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

1i262om,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i262om/i_26m_am_feeling_bad_about_relationship_with_my/,I (26M) am feeling bad about relationship with my girlfriend (25F),"I have been seeing this girl since mid October. Her father owns a law office where she works. In terms of wealth, they are considered wealthy - as that office exists for 15+ years. On the other side, I was born and raised in a working class family, both parents worked regular jobs until we started running a small shop where we made money. Now I work as a SWE, and thank God we are also considered wealthy family but not ‚Äúold money‚Äù like hers( just a background of both families).

Our first date was a dinner at a nice restaurant as she said she doesn‚Äôt do ‚Äúcoffee dates‚Äù. From second date onwards she was subtly bragging about the ‚Äúhigh end life‚Äù she has been living, travels, expensive clothes and restaurants etc‚Ä¶ To be honest, I haven‚Äôt cared much because I tried to get to know her as a person first. Also, she did ask me about my work, hobbies etc‚Ä¶

Maybe three weeks into dating, she started to ask me about my job and SWE pay rates. That was a bit uncomfortable for me so I answered with general range.
For our first month anniversary, we agreed to exchange gifts. But she said she has already picked the gift I should give her, it was golden hoops earrings - and she bought me a Polo shirt.

A couple of weeks later she ‚Äúpicked‚Äù herself a Dior blush, and TH jacket to which I obliged to buy - since I got some bonuses ( my bad, I know).
In the meantime, I was paying for all our dates, trips etc.. 
While dates and dinners ( dinner at least once a week) were not a problem, and I believe a man should take care of those anyways, she wasn‚Äôt participating in covering any expenses of our trips ( not overseas, but in medium proximity to our hometown). That was weird to me as she declared herself as ‚Äúhigh value woman‚Äù, and I thought she would like to take care of at least something.

On a couple of occasions, even during trips, she wouldn‚Äôt bring her wallet at all - once she wanted to buy some beauty stuff, we went to the counter and she didn‚Äôt have a wallet in her purse ‚Ä¶

Even though she was talking about expensive clothes and trips with her family, I didn‚Äôt see much of it happening during these months. She was downplaying people who were buying stuff at ‚Äúlow value stores‚Äù as she would address them i.e. Zara, but when she went out shopping with her mom - they were mostly shopping there. Yet she was talking about Burberry coats etc.. and that story didn‚Äôt match the actions.

In the meantime, she told me she expected a gift each month - and not like a budget gift, rather a trip to expensive hotels, purses, coats etc ‚Ä¶ I was shocked completely, but a part of the thought ‚Äúshe was just kidding ‚Äú.

I started feeling as an ATM, and I sat her down last week and we talked. She said she doesn‚Äôt need money and trips to be happy with me, and we can ease off the costs - because she loves me. I really believed that. Less than 24hrs after, she suggested a weekend trip to an expensive hotel on the mountains so ‚Äúwe‚Äù could enjoy snow.

I told her she doesn‚Äôt stick to her story, to which she responded like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what the problem is. Are you a freelancer or do you have a contract and your salary is always the same‚Äù. And started enquiring about if my earnings tanked since October, ridiculous.

Buying her so many things were a mistake so early on, but I thought that a person who ‚Äúgrew up in luxury‚Äù, as she would say, would know that luxury comes and goes, and the person on who you can rely on in good and bad is the biggest luxury one can have.

This was her story as well, but her actions didn‚Äôt match one bit. 

TL/DR: Feeling like an ATM for the last two months. Girlfriend‚Äôs talk does not match her actions. Talk puts emphasis on subtle actions and respect, while actions only care about materialistic and super expensive stuff.

Without her family, she would not be able to cover her expenses at all, not even close.

I (23NB) am friend with a couple (""Noah"", 25NB and ""Lucy"" 25F). We have been friends for a year now and we met around a hobby we share. 

N and L got together last Nov. after 1yr of non official relationship.
During that year both N and L would sometimes come forward to ask advice about a situation between them. It wasn't super frequent, it must have happened a couple of times for each friend, and sometimes we even went out for a coffee and enjoyed those ""therapy"" times as usual hangouts.

Last Friday, N texted me, they were quite distraught, telling me L has been giving one-worded answers to their texts. (It's not the first time that happens as L is well known for ghosting you or being rude when she is upset about something.) I ask N what could have caused the issue, they explain the situation to me and I advise them to organise a date so they can spend positive time together.

Friday night, my partner J invited me to hangout on Sun. PM with N. 

FYI, Sun. was at first meant to be a day we spent all 4 together, however L sent us a very short and dry text telling us the date was canceled. When I tried to reschedule she declined and said there would never be another hangout again. I did not take that text as face value and just said I understood and I was there if she needed me. She left me on read.

So about sun., J explains the hangout was long planned as they had to lend some clothes to N for a project, but N asked if I could come as well so we could talk a bit. That night I hesitated to check up on L, however she had been aggressive both on Twitter and with Noah so I decided I did not have the strength to get yelled at that night and gave it a rest. (I also did not want to become a messenger for those two to communicate with e/o).

The hangout on Sun went great and N looked like they were feeling much better. On Monday night, N told me about their date. It went good at first, but turned sour late in the afternoon as N was getting a migraine and felt very tired. They asked to cut short the date, to which L answered ""No wonder you're tired, you've been so busy this weekend"" (they only went out with us) and they said it was actually not because of that, that they just felt sick, after which L got upset. She kept answering one-worded sentences and walking super fast to leave them behind.

N mentioned before that L might have been upset that we hung out together, so I decided to reach out in the end. She gave dry answers to my texts such as : ‚ÄúI don't know what you want us to talk about.‚Äù, ‚ÄúLOL we both know we're not friends‚Äù and when I disagreed and said we loved her she said ‚Äúbye, I'm having an attack again‚Äù (sorry, I'm limited by characters)

We've always treated N and L equally before so I'm lost and upset.
So AITA for waiting before sending a text?

There were some things about his previous relationship that came up at the start, but I feel like they‚Äôve been addressed.



From the beginning, he was very clear that he was interested in me and has talked to his friends and family about me. He often expresses how much he values our relationship, and we spend a lot of time together‚Äîhanging out, having sleepovers, and going on dates a few times a week.

About 2-3 weeks into dating, we talked about exclusivity, and he agreed right away, and we‚Äôve been exclusive ever since.



Lately, though, it‚Äôs been on my mind that he hasn‚Äôt officially asked me to be his girlfriend. I asked him about it a couple of days ago, and he said he‚Äôs still not at a point where he feels the ‚Äúsecurity and safety‚Äù he wants before taking that step. He mentioned that he worries about upsetting me and second-guesses his actions, like if he holds the door open for another girl, he wonders if I‚Äôll be upset by it. I‚Äôve told him I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve given him any reason to feel that way, but he still seems uncertain.



I feel like our relationship is really healthy, and I care about him a lot.

It's my first time posting here because I don't know where else to post and because as the subreddit says I went through something unexplained and felt real. So real that I cannot stop thinking of it. Last night when I was asleep I had a feeling that I should go to my garden for some fresh air. Now the garden is kinda big but I chose a spot that I usually don't frequent a lot. I saw a beem of light , circle like and it kept beeming in a weird way like the colors of old television when you first turn it on. I thought that I had a lot of smokes and I might be kinda high so I followed the beem and suddenly I found myself in my room again like I haven't left it. But the only difference is that it was evening so I heard my mother calling for me to take the ""children"". I saw three children of mine two girls and a boy that looked a lot like my aspects with a slight difference. I told my mother who were they and she suddenly looked older , hair all white and more facial aging. I was in shock and I kept the children close , she told me to go shopping for their food. And I saw myself as an observer go to the grocery store and pick stuff I never picked before. Even the grocery store is new as it's normally a coffee shop there. After this I went back to my body and felt the coldness of the yoghurts even an old man told me ""don't worry I see the way you're holding them they are as cold as you want them especially it's summer time"". Accordingly, the beem appeared again and I went rushing through it with a sense of an unexplainable regret or nostalgia to the children I've seen and the women that might be my wife even though I haven't yet encountered her but I felt her. I went through the beem again and I found myself in a house I don't know again as an observer. I noticed two people in a bedroom that has technology that I haven't seen before , more like advanced clocks on the wall and more digital. I've seen a women and a man she kept calling him my name. They went out of the bedroom and their girl aged in her twenties asked the man who holds my name and who seems older than who I am if he can drop her somewhere I couldn't hear.  A strong feeling of chest pain like a pressure is all surrounding me z like when you're in the ocean and the waves are strong came away and I suddenly woke up in my bed. I looked at the clock and it's mine , the bed is mine and I am me again but it's 10 am. First thing I felt is the urge to cry for missing a place I haven't seen and people I don't know. And the second feeling is of a thank God I'm alive. Now this is my first time doing such trip and I wasn't on any drugs or MDMA. I wanted to share my story or dream with you because I still cannot explain the feelings I still feel. Cheers,

Before that I had the grand idea to become a camgirl one night when I was what I would assume hypomanic (I thought that was the quickest way to get out of my abusive household). In addition to this I was tackling finals season, downing coffee daily, and smoking weed which wasn't helpful in terms of managing stress. What ensued was hellish and made me reminiscent of my first mental breakdown at 16 (same racing thoughts and then intense depression) that was similar and resulted in my PTSD diagnosis. I was put on SSRI's then and it was helpful but I had episodes of rage on it. When I was hospitalized they put me on Prozac, but I began to feel disconnected and more angry so I stopped.

When I brought myself to the ER because I was scared of how shitty/disconnected my mental state was they told me I might have Bipolar II. A mixed episode? I still don't know what that means. My middle sister got it around this age, my oldest sister is diagnosed, and my father probably has it based on how much of a mindfuck my childhood was (reckless behavior, drug abuse, mental instability, random business ideas, him being imprisoned). Its like i'm fitting the puzzle pieces together, but I didn't want to even have to be put in this position.

The regret and grief is immense. But so is the pain. This entire ordeal has been traumatic and still is. Not only am I facing a probable bipolar diagnosis, but I'm trying to get out of an abusive situation so I can have a better chance at stability. I'm 22 (recently had my birthday), but I never imagined my life and mental state could crumble that soon.

I am in pain and struggling trying to face the fact that this is probably my reality now. This is going to be a tough transition...but I want to get on track with going to therapy more and taking meds (praying they work for me), so I don't repeat my father's mistakes. I plan on finishing this degree, and this is rock bottom but I have hope/am holding myself accountable for climbing out of this. Life feels a bit hopeless and going ""mad"" is such an isolating experience. However, I have hope that I can manage this and enjoy life just as much as everyone else around me.

By the time she immigrated to America, she had to fight misogyny left-and-right, whether at work or from her ex-husband, my father.  By the time I was born and diagnosed with autism, Mom's idea of raising me was making me experience the exact same discrimination for my mental disabilities the same way she did for her gender, whether from her or the schools I used to go to.

I'm 35 right now and still live with my mother as my legal guardian, not only because of my disabilities, but also because Mom mentally fucked me up to the point that I'm too afraid of making my own decisions without her approval.  And I still have to deal with Mom's unstable mood swings when it comes to her taking care of me, the same way she did her family, the Soviet Union, and the many men in her life.

I also have an older sister who lives with her husband and son.  And she managed to block our mother off of multiple social media platforms, ex-communicating herself and her entire family from Mom, while still keeping in contact with her other relatives.  And knowing Mom's generational trauma and how much of it she passed down to us, it becomes perfectly understandable as to why.

It's also why I'm taking a ton of psychiatric medications every day of the week.  Right now, I'm taking Fanapt for my bipolar disorder, Fluoxetine for my OCD, Strattera for my ADHD, and Valsartan for my high blood pressure.  I'm also cutting down on coffee, and drinking more calming beverages like black, green, and chamomile tea, just to dramatically reduce my anxiety.

My (m28) girlfriend (f26) and I just recently moved into a new apartment building after a string of extremely disheartening experiences renting units from private landlords. We've been absolutely loving the unit so far and have been thinking this place could be our long-term home while we save for our next chapter in life.

In our kitchen, we have an Air Fryer, and a Coffee Maker plugged into the same wall outlet. We are only using the two available plugs with absolutely no extension cords or any extra electronics plugged in. Despite this, we recently discovered that when we use both devices at the same time, it overloads the fuse and we need to go reset it at the fuse box! Just for context, this happened the initial time, we discovered the problem, and then it happened once more the other day because we forgot!

I just received an email from the property management regarding ""safe use of wall outlets"" and a reminder to ""not overload any electrical outlets""...

So I guess I have a couple questions;

\- Are there potentially cameras within our unit that I should be worried about?

\- Do apartment buildings somehow have a way to monitor if individual units have issues with fuses?

or

\- Is this just an extremely conveniently timed email and I'm just being paranoid?",1,1736969573.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

1i25n4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1i25n4f/henry_the_martyr/,"Henry, The Martyr ","

When Henry perched himself atop that pine tree, I thought he‚Äôd just lost his damn mind. No amount of convincing from Jim or the sheriff could coax him down. He ascended into the canopy and never returned.

Never returned alive, at least.

He‚Äôd always been an eccentric. It wasn‚Äôt easy living next-door to Henry, but it certainly wasn‚Äôt dull, either. Between the small city of birdhouses he maintained around the perimeter of his two-story house, the free homebrewed mead that appeared on our doorstep the first of every month, and the early morning French Horn recitals, he was a handful.

I rather liked the ongoing spectacle, all things considered. Jim never really saw the humor in Henry‚Äôs mania. That said, crippling agoraphobia has prevented me from leaving the house for almost a year now, so my threshold for what qualifies as entertainment is quite a low bar to clear.

My husband was on his way to confront Henry about his newest hobby, metal detecting, when he first scaled that twenty-foot tall pine in our backyard. It wasn‚Äôt the act of metal detecting that bothered Jim - it was the many untended holes that vexed him. The sixty-something year old found himself too lost in paroxysms of archeological fervor to bother filling the quarries back up with soil after he made them. After days of steady excavation, it looked like Henry had been sweeping his property for landmines.

That morning, Jim saw the man creeping towards the edge of the forest thirty yards from our kitchen window, and he sprung into action. If I‚Äôm recalling correctly, he shouted something like, ‚Äú*I‚Äôm going to nip this in the bud*‚Äù as he jogged out the front door, which now carries a cruel cosmic irony when examined in retrospect.

The scene unfolded before me through the dusty lens of our den‚Äôs cheap telescope, which has a lovely panoramic view of the backyard and the thicket beyond from where we keep it.

As much as it pains me to admit it, fear of the space outside my house has turned me into a bit of a snoop.

Jim sauntered up to our neighbor, but Henry didn‚Äôt turn around to greet him. Nor did he stop lurching forward. He didn't even react to Jim, as far as I could tell. It was like he was moving in slow-motion autopilot. Although irritated, it wasn‚Äôt like my husband‚Äôs molten rage drove Henry to the top of that pine out of a concern for his safety.

No matter what Jim did or said, Henry remained locked in an impenetrable trance. A man on a mission.

He gave up on catching Henry‚Äôs attention by the time he had made it three quarters of the way up. As Jim started to walk back, I kept watching. Henry, the sleepwalker, never changed his pace. Each identical movement was eerily slow and deliberate. After reaching the apex, he positioned himself to face our home, extended both arms palms up in front of his chest, and became impossibly still. An unblinking gargoyle baking in the early morning summer sun.

At least, I thought he was stationary.

When I checked on him an hour later through the telescope, however, he had spun his torso about thirty degrees west. Arms still extended, eyes still open, but his body had turned. Concerned and captivated in equal measure, I began observing him continuously.

While I watched, nothing seemed to change, and I was becoming progressively unnerved by his uncanny stillness. But when I paused my vigil after about twenty minutes, something occurred to me - he *was* moving. I could tell when I brought my eye away from the telescope. Looking through the den window, his torso had clearly pivoted another fifteen degrees clockwise. The motion was just so slow that I found it hard to perceive in real time.

I put my eye back to the lens of the telescope.

Henry‚Äôs skin was developing a red sheen. His unblinking eyes were dry and tinged with brown specks, like overcooked egg whites.

That‚Äôs when I called the sheriff.

The grizzled southerner and his doe-eyed deputy arrived quickly, seeing as they were only a three-minute drive down the road. They stood at the base of that pine for an hour, but couldn‚Äôt find the language to persuade Henry down either. Flustered and out of patience, the sheriff told us he would involve the fire department tomorrow if Henry remained in the tree.

When night fell, I couldn‚Äôt visualize Henry through the telescope anymore. But I could *hear* him. From our bedroom window, faintly sobbing somewhere in the blackness.

I found myself posted up in the den before the sun even rose, my mind burning with curiosity. Black coffee trickled down my throat, warming my marrow. For a moment, I felt ashamed of the excitement rumbling around in my chest.

The more I reflected on the sensation, however, the more I understood it. Journalism used to be my life before the cumulative horrors I documented manifested as a crippling fear of the world. In the grand scheme of things, this stakeout was pathetic. It didn't hold a candle to what I had done before, in a past life. But fascination, not dread, drove me to do it, and that held value.

Henry had not moved from his steeple, and by the time the sun appeared over the horizon, he had stifled his tears. His biceps were red and swollen, likely muscle breakdown from keeping them outstretched in the same position for over twenty-four hours.

A little after eight, Jim made his way downstairs. He was unusually quiet. Initially, I attributed his silence to low-level distress, secondary to Henry‚Äôs unexplained behavior. When I finally noticed him, he was standing by the front door, away from the view of our neighbor‚Äôs macabre display.

I asked him if he was doing alright, and he replied with an affirmative grunt, so I left him be.

Around noon, I felt a theory crystallize in my skull. Henry was twisting around the tree‚Äôs axis with a pace and direction identical to yesterday's. He must be watching something, I thought. That‚Äôs when it hit me.

Henry was angling his eyes and his body to constantly face the sun.

My mind scrambled to process this observation, but Jim‚Äôs heavy breathing behind me broke my concentration. It scared the shit out of me because I didn‚Äôt hear him approach. Startled, I urged him to explain what the hell he was doing.

*‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶fixing clock,‚Äù* he replied.

Except there was no clock. In actuality, he had his face pressed to the window that was to the right of me. He was staring at something.

I didn‚Äôt want to believe it at first. But by the afternoon, I was forced to confront the realization. From where I sat in the den, I could see Henry‚Äôs back through the telescope, and when I moved my eye away, I could see Jim‚Äôs back, silently gazing forward.

Early that morning, he had been watching the sun rise from our front door, just the same as Henry had from atop the pine tree.

My husband was following the trajectory as well.

Before I could dial 9-1-1, the sheriff and his deputy appeared in my peripheral vision. My burst of relief was short-lived when I observed how they were walking. Their footfalls were languid and protracted, the same as Henry‚Äôs had been yesterday.

As their hands contacted two different pine trees in unison, I refocused the telescope on Henry. To my horror, they were not climbing the tree where my neighbor sat to rescue him.

The possessed men were scaling their own trees, each equidistant from Henry‚Äôs.

In a state of detached shock, I moved a shaky hand to my notebook to jot down one last detail I had noticed about Henry.

Tiny mushrooms had sprouted from his eye sockets, palms and his open mouth. A robin rested on his forehead, nibbling at the growing fungus.

A wave of primal terror washed over me, and I sprinted from the chair to my front door, pausing as my hand twisted the knob.

I tried to force myself through the threshold. My head pivoted back to Jim for motivation, who hadn‚Äôt moved an inch, in spite of the noise of the chair and the telescope crashing to the floor when I sprang up.

Unable to overcome my agoraphobia, I instead sat down on the doormat and placed my head in my hands.

Whatever Henry succumbed to, it had spread to the sheriff, the deputy, and my husband. I contemplated calling 9-1-1, but what if it just spread to emergency medical services as well?

I‚Äôm not sure how long I lingered there, catatonic. The blood-chilling wails of my husband returned my consciousness to my body.

It had become night.

The absence of natural light had made Jim into a messy human puddle on the kitchen floor.

I tiptoed over to my husband, doing my best to ignore the pangs of terror vibrating in my spine. He had simply crumbled where he stood when the sun set, kneeling unnaturally with his chest and torso leaning against the wall below our kitchen window.

Despite knowing he wasn‚Äôt, I asked if he was okay a handful of times, receiving no reply.

Standing over him, I tilted his shoulder, trying to see his face. Jim limply fell over in response. He was still crying softly, eyes open but producing no tears.

That‚Äôs when I noticed his chest wasn‚Äôt moving.

He wasn‚Äôt breathing.

When I found the courage to check, he had no pulse, and I lost consciousness.

I woke up a few hours later.

Through the telescope, I could see my husband perched on a pine tree of his own, arms outstretched and eyes still open. Hellish choreography modeled by Henry, mimicked by the sheriff, the deputy, and Jim.

My current theory is as follows: Henry must have accidentally unearthed something old and terrible digging holes in his backyard. A parasitic fungus lying dormant under the soil, infecting everyone who went near with inhaled spores once it was exposed.

I‚Äôm going to make it outside today. I'll grab a shovel from the garage, and I'll fill every single hole Henry made with layers of soil. Maybe I‚Äôll survive uninfected, but I suspect I will succumb to whatever this thing is as well.

It‚Äôs the least I can do to honor Jim‚Äôs memory.

I‚Äôm taking the time to document and post this for two reasons.

First and foremost, don‚Äôt end up like me. I hid from the world because it felt safer. But it wasn‚Äôt safer, it was just easier, and I wasted precious time.

Secondly, if you see anyone perched on a tree, eyes following the trajectory of the sun, burn the tree down or run. Whatever you do, cover your mouth, because that robin ate some of the fungus that grew from Henry, and may disseminate the spores as far as it can fly.

While we strolled down SF, found this adorable garage cafe. It‚Äôs Bird & Bear Coffee Company, named after the founder‚Äôs twin kids.

When I‚Äôm in SoCal, I occasionally host small coffee gatherings. After having a wonderful chat with the owner, we thought it would be fun to try it here in the bay area as well.

On MLK Monday 1/20, we are going to meet Bird & Bear‚Äôs coffee roastery in your immediate neighborhood across the bridge, West Oakland. Since they operate their store based off of their home garage, we decided to move to their roasting facility where they have more space available.

* When: MLK Monday 1/20, 11:00 am - 12:30 pm
* Where: Bird & Bear Coffee Company Roastery in West Oakland

75-minutes coffee gathering that includes ‚Äî

* Private coffee roastery tour
* Guided coffee cupping experience
* Led by Dan, co-founder of Bird & Bear Coffee Company

For those who are new to coffee cupping, it is a method for evaluating and tasting coffee that involves ‚Äî

* üëÄ Observing: Looking at the green beans for defects and the roasted beans
* üëÉ Smelling: Noticing the coffee‚Äôs aroma
* üëÖ Tasting: Sampling the coffee to experience its flavors and notes

Coffee cupping is a professional practice, but anyone can do it. It‚Äôs a great way to: develop your sense of taste, learn what coffees you like best, and share your thoughts with others.

When enjoying coffee, we often try one full cup at a time and rarely get a chance to compare different types of beans. It will be a fun and unique opportunity to step into coffee roasting facility‚Äôs behind the scene and learn how coffee professionals enjoy their coffee.

Participation: $50 per person

If anyone who wants to purchase beans to repeat quality coffee experience at home, Dan will offer 10% discount on your onsite purchase.

üëá More details available in the RSVP link in the comment thread

My friend is always spending money on luxury or extra stuff (which is completely fine it's her money) such as a new car, a luxury apartment, bi-weekly snowboarding excursions, gym memberships, concerts, eating out, but is always complaining about not having enough money. She'll suggest plans to go do something and say ""it'll only be $300"" like it's nothing, then the next day complain about being broke. 

On top of this, she will venmo request me for the smallest things and it makes it awkward to go out and do anything with her. 

I have developed a mindset that when going out with other friends or coworkers that we all take turns paying for each other (as long as it's nothing ridiculous, I'm talking like under $20) and it creates a really nice mutual understanding and avoids the awkward money talk that can happen. Any larger expenses I will happily pay back the money, and I've never once forgotten and have always been timely, so I don't have a history of not paying people back. I'll go out of my way to pay people back for the larger expenses as I don't want to put them in a tight spot. 

If I ever buy something for this friend, I'll receive neither a drink in return next time we go out nor mention of venmoing me (I would have to go out of my way to request it from her). But sure as hell if she buys something for me, I'll get a venmo request before we leave the cafe. Because of this I just never treat her to anything, as it feels so one-sided because I know she'll never do that for me. 

Recently, she was driving for a day trip, and in return I offered to pay for a couple of her meals, which she accepted. But when the trip started up, she said ""you'll have to pay me for gas,"" and I had to awkwardly mention the deal (which I had already paid for by that point), and she just didn't respond. It's getting to the point I dread going out to do anything with her because I know she'll make an uncomfortable comment about money. 

Her penny pinching is so noticeable that even her coworkers have told she has a ""poor person mindset"" which she just laughs about and agrees with. 

I just want to be able to get coffee with this friend, and be able to buy her a coffee and vice versa without money coming up and making it awkward. AIO for thinking this is frustrating? ",5,1736968860.0,AmIOverreacting,7,1.0,False

Seems to only happen at night. 

30/m, 6ft, 186lb, 3-4 alcoholic drinks a month, and I drink one cup of coffee every morning.  
  
My mom is pre-diabetic, so I figured that may have been my issue. Last week I decided to get bloodwork done and got everything tested (that I could). A1C, hemoglobin, liver, kidney function, and my other tests all came back normal. 

The last couple of months I've cut down on my fluid intake at night which has helped a little bit, but i'm still waking up \~2 times a night. I'm sure I could cut down a tad more on fluid intake (this is what my doctor suggested), but I feel dehydrated at night even with the amount I drink now?

I don't suspect sleep apnea, as I don't have any other symptoms linking to that - once I sleep, I wake up feeling fine. Plus the thought of getting a sleep test done seems exhausting (no pun intended), so I'm trying everything I can before diving into that.

How can I explain to them that they aren't?,"Sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, if anyone has any suggestions on where to post it I'll move my post there.

They essentially believe that ""Big Wi-Fi"" is covering up the fact that EMFs are dangerous. They've taken measures such as turning the Wi-Fi off at night.

From the light research I've done, this is what I've found:  
\- EMFs *can be* dangerous at high levels... but so is water.  
\- The levels of EMFs produced by Wi-Fi routers and other household appliances are well within safe levels of EMF absorption  
\- Studies that show EMF is dangerous are working with high levels of EMFs, much more than we'd absorb in our day to day lives  
\- Natural light is technically more dangerous in terms of radiation?  
\- The FCC regulates ALL wireless devices to ensure they produce safe levels of EMFs  
from the FCC website

>All wireless devices sold in the US go through a formal FCC approval process to ensure that they do not exceed the exposure limits when operating at the device‚Äôs highest possible power level.

and

>Some health and safety interest groups have interpreted certain reports to suggest that wireless device use may be linked to cancer and other illnesses, posing potentially greater risks for children than adults. While these assertions have gained increased public attention, currently no scientific evidence establishes a causal link between wireless device use and cancer or other illnesses

\- the most consistent evidence of EMFs being harmful is between ELFs and childhood lukemia, which were classified as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans."" Which sounds pretty bad, but *coffee* is also classified as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"" when it comes to kidney cancer.

>‚ÄúPossibly carcinogenic to humans‚Äù is a classification used to denote an agent for which there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and less than sufficient evidence for carcinogenicity in experimental animals. (WHO, 2002)

I admit I was skimming most sources, but that's what I got from about an hour or two of research. One of my hang ups is that, IF EMFs are harmful, it seems like the negative effect they would have would be negligible, and further more, taking measures such as turning off the Wi-Fi for only some of the time would have little to no effect. Like if you want to get away from EMFs you'd have to take out ALL the EMF producing stuff in your house, NEVER go into public, and so on... or retreat into the woods, live in a log cabin, and live off the grid for the rest of your life. I just can't comprehend living in that level of fear.

I believe my parents are getting most of their information from a specific guy and the book(s) he wrote, I'm not *exactly* sure who it is, but the things I've read about Dr. Dimitris J. Panagopoulos seem to fit what they believe. This interview seems to give a decent idea to what he thinks: [https://theemfguy.com/emf-dangers-panagopoulos/](https://theemfguy.com/emf-dangers-panagopoulos/)

This guy went to a (seemingly?) decent university in Canada, graduated with honors in Biochemistry, and apparently dedicated his PhD to researching the harmful effects of EMFs. You would think that this guy would be in the know with all that education, right? I just don't understand, if EMFs being dangerous is pseudoscience, why does the guy who dedicated his life to researching EMFs believe they are dangerous? Is he just a very well qualified grifter?

**The main thing I need help with is**, even though I've found plenty of data that goes against the pseudoscience, people like Dr. Dimitris are going to make it difficult to talk to my parents about this, as it makes them distrust a lot of sources that the data comes from. I do not have the tools, energy, or time to prove if Dr. Dimitris is or is not a trustworthy source. For all I know, *I* could be in the wrong here and there IS some grand conspiracy.

If anyone has any answers and/or sources that would help shine light on this subject for me and hopefully my parents, as well as disprove or discredit the pseudoscience, that would be greatly appreciated.

We liked the beach very much, tried some surfing and loved the sunset. I also loved the iced coffee from Soy Tico Soda. We also had a great new year‚Äôs eve at the beach and met some locals from San Jose. I love thunderstorms and we were literally inside of a tropical one.

**Cons**

Interbus (too expensive for s simple standart transport). Unlucky weather, we had a few sunny days, but most of the time it was cloudy and rainy. Everything was expensive, mediocre food for high prices, activities double the price of elsewhere. The place didn't feel authentic and most of the crowd there was like 20-something, looking for party, surfing and insta pictures. We didn't like the vibe at all.

# Monteverde (3 days)

Got a 4x4 after Santa Teresa and drove to Montverde, which was a long journey, but the roads are ok. We did expect worse roads tbh. We had a fantastic night next to Poas (Monte Armadillo hospedaje) on the way, with a great view, lovely owners and good food. Moved on towards Santa Elena and had a good time there as well (El Sol), with a very touristic night trip (still worth it) and a quite expensive hike at El Tigre (also worth it in the end).

**Pros**

Cloud forest, waterfalls and animals on the night tour

**Cons**

Expensive activities, payment for simple hiking, weather, zero sight to poas

# La Fortuna (4 days)

Continued to La Fortuna with the car aside the lake, lots of rain, but occasionally we had some sun. We had a flat tire that we fixed with the support of some locals at the gas station and finally arrived at our stay (La Finca Lodge). That place was fantastic (lots of wildlife around, sloths, birds..), however unluckily again we had 3 days of rain. We decided to hike the San Vicente Hideaway trail anyways, which was quite difficult, under that weather but worth it (not that expensive as well). We spent another full day at the Ecotermales Fortuna, which we also enjoyed.

**Pros**

Less touristic, hot springs and the nature around our lodge

**Cons**

Weather, food, no have seen the areal once

# Cahuita (5 days)

Finally, we went to Cahuita, which was our personal highlight. Not last because we had almost 5 sunny days there. Our apartment (Playa Negra Guesthouse) was fantastic. We saw many different animals directly in their garden (sloths, birds, frogs, iguanas) and found the best national park so far in Cahuita, even on a voluntary basis. We visited the beaches south, even with a great snorkeling spot and got finally some good local food, which was also not overpriced.

**Pros**

The Caribbean vibe, food, weather and people

**Cons**

Getting there

# TLDR;

Our Costa Rica trip had its ups and downs. Santa Teresa offered beautiful beaches and sunsets, but it felt overpriced and unauthentic, with a party-focused vibe we didn‚Äôt enjoy. Monteverde impressed us with its cloud forests and wildlife despite expensive activities and rainy weather. La Fortuna‚Äôs nature and hot springs were wonderful, but heavy rain and mediocre food were drawbacks. Cahuita was the highlight, with sunny days, vibrant Caribbean charm, amazing wildlife, and delicious, reasonably priced local food. While Costa Rica‚Äôs natural beauty stood out, the high costs and unpredictable weather left a mixed impression overall.

If a friend would ask me if he should visit Costa Rica, I would not give an instant yes tbh (letting the weather aside). You can get a similar experience for much less, so it‚Äôs not good value for money (especially for Europeans). I did expect to pay premium prices for premium experiences, but compared to other countries, we visited (Vietnam, Thailand, Maldives) it didn‚Äôt feel much premium at all. Also, we had the impression that some locals only wanted to squeeze the money out of us.",0,1736967524.0,CostaRicaTravel,1,0.5,False

* Plain wash of colour
* Use cling film, salt or rice to add texture
* Tea/coffee stain (not watercolour but similar technique, just get used teabag water and slosh it around lol)
* Spray page with water lightly then use paint and see the effect
* Use bubbles by mixing water washing up liquid and paint, blowing into it through a straw then pressing the bubbles to the page (again not watercolour but similar)
* Use ‚Äòblooms‚Äô - apply water or another colour to already wet watercolour (like wet-on-wet)
* Flick/splash paint to create splatter effect



ACRYLIC:

* Wet on wet
* A simple solid background colour that matches what your doing
* Create texture by splodging paint (I did this green splodged page with paint, it was so thick that it left like crusts of green that sounds weird but it was so nice)
* Sgraffito - scratching away acrylic whilst it‚Äôs wet to reveal what‚Äôs underneath and creates a pattern



* Rip pages out of books, magazines or newspapers (leave them whole or tear them up)
* Tear up random bits of coloured card
* Stippling, cross hatching or zentagle type things with biro or paint (they take a long time though)
* Just go loose with some markers and scribble random shapes (for some things they just work (just do polka dots if you‚Äôre like me and completely done with imagination and just wanna sleep)
* Sponge paint

I felt a little odd as I waited by the airport.¬† I held a sign and stood with the other drivers who were wearing suits like I was.¬† I tugged at my collar.¬† Cass said it would look nice for when I met their mom.¬† Cass had sent me a picture of her mother so I knew what she looked like when she came down the escalator.

I held up my sign that said ‚ÄúMrs. Yoshida‚Äù and she strutted toward me.¬† She had jet black hair like her two daughters but was slightly shorter and had more prominent Asian features.¬† Either she had her two children young or she was incredibly on top of her health.¬† Mrs. Yoshida looked amazing.¬† She dropped her bags in front of me and walked past.  
  
‚ÄúRight away, Mrs. Yoshida!‚Äù¬† I said as I grabbed the bags and slung them over both my shoulders.¬† Then I picked up the other two and followed her to the Lexus that Cass let me borrow.  
  
She got into the back without saying a word and I stuffed her bags in the trunk before joining her in the front seat.

‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt want to join me up here, Mrs. Yoshida?‚Äù¬† I asked.

‚ÄúJust drive, please.‚Äù

She kept her sunglasses on even inside.¬† I drove and said, ‚ÄúYour daughters are wonderful people.¬† You‚Äôre really raising them to be fine young women.‚Äù  
  
Mrs. Yoshida texted on the phone while I made it onto the highway.  
  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.¬† Obviously Samantha‚Äôs a total firecracker.¬† But I know she has a softside.¬† And Cass.¬† Oh my gosh.¬† I work with her and she‚Äôs so sweet while taking such a leadership role.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking a phone call.‚Äù  
  
Mrs. Yoshida picked up the phone and I instantly clammed up, not wanting to make a sound.¬† She didn‚Äôt even have to directly command me to quiet down.¬† As soon as she said that I took her lead.  
  
‚ÄúHey.¬† No, some driver won‚Äôt stop talking about how he wants to bang my daughters.¬† Yeah.¬† I didn‚Äôt say Paramount.¬† I said Netflix.¬† That‚Äôs not good enough.¬† Flattery.¬† Yeah, keep sucking my dick but even after I cum I‚Äôm going to say Netflix.‚Äù  
  
I kept driving but I couldn‚Äôt help but look back at her in the mirror. Her domineering demeanor.¬† The way she looked so elegant.¬† Her tight professional blouse was unable to hide her large breasts and her black blazer just framed them like a painting.  
  
‚ÄúStop.¬† No, not you, keep talking.¬† I‚Äôm talking to the driver.¬† STOP.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe!?¬† Oh, uh, yes, Ma‚Äôam!‚Äù¬† I said as I pulled off the highway.

‚ÄúPull over at this coffee shop.¬† No, I‚Äôm not accepting whatever the hell Dasani TV is.¬† We can get Netflix if you stopped being such a little bitch,‚Äù She leaned over and handed me a twenty dollar bill, ‚ÄúBuy me a matcha with an espresso shot.¬† Whatever‚Äôs left over just put in the tip jar,‚Äù Then back to the person she was talking to she said, ‚ÄúWho would you rather have squeezing your balls, the client or me?¬† That‚Äôs right, now say ‚ÄòThank you, Mommy.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, Mommy.‚Äù I mumbled.

She looked up at me with a confused expression.¬† I blushed and got out of the car, rushing over to get her matcha latte.

She spent the rest of the ride drinking from her matcha and yelling abuses at, I assume, her subordinates, clients, colleagues, and coworkers.¬† When we finally arrived, she went inside, leaving me to get the bags.¬† I came inside and dropped the bags down.¬† Mrs. Yoshida looked at me for one second and I knew I‚Äôd messed up.¬† She pointed to the stairs.

‚ÄúUp the stairs, first door on the left.¬† Put those in my room.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Mrs. Yoshida.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to be so formal,‚Äù Mrs. Yoshida said, ‚ÄúYou can call me ma‚Äôam or miss.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

I lugged the huge bags up the stairs and placed them in her room before coming back down.¬† Mrs. Yoshida was checking my handiwork, wiping her finger on the marble counter and inspecting for crumbs.

‚ÄúHuh,‚Äù Mrs. Yoshida said, ‚ÄúThe girls actually did a pretty good job.‚Äù

Yeah, *the girls.*¬† Before I went home last night, Cass asked me to make sure the house was spotless tomorrow before picking up her mom.¬† She said she couldn‚Äôt because she had school then work.¬† I didn‚Äôt want to do it but she batted her eyes and told me she‚Äôd give me a big reward if I did.¬† So I skipped class and scrubbed every inch of the house, before calling sick for work and going to pick their mom up.

Just then, I heard a car parking in the driveway.¬† It was Cass‚Äô white Audi.¬† She walked in wearing her work uniform.  
  
‚ÄúMom!¬† Hey!‚Äù¬† She went over and hugged her mother, ‚ÄúMommy!¬† I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre back!¬† I hope the drive was okay.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYes.¬† Your‚Ä¶ little friend was very helpful.‚Äù¬† She mused.  
  
Cass‚Äô eyes sparkled, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt he just the best?¬† Wait until you find out all the little tricks he can do.‚Äù¬† She reached out and pinched my cheeks.¬† I let out a diffusive laugh but didn‚Äôt brush her hand away.  
  
‚ÄúLeo‚Äôs still in the car, why don‚Äôt we all go out and get dinner?!¬† Celebrate you being back?‚Äù  
  
I saw Mrs. Yoshida‚Äôs eyes roll at the mention of Leo.¬† I couldn‚Äôt help but smirk.¬† Could the great and alpha Leo actually have his BS called out by Cass‚Äô mother?  
  
‚ÄúOkay, fine.‚Äù¬† She said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs all get back in the car and head to Sushi.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYay!‚Äù¬† Cass said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll text Sam to meet us over there!‚Äù¬† Then she turned to me and said, ‚ÄúCould you drive, Artie?¬† Leo and I are just so tired from work.‚Äù  
  
I had just driven a one hour round trip in traffic for basically no acknowledgment and had still not eaten all day, but I said sure.  
  
We drove to sushi with Mrs. Yoshida in shotgun with me.¬† Cass and Leo were whispering silently to each other.¬† While we couldn't make out the words we knew it was romantic from the way they were saying it.  
  
Miss Yoshida tsked as she looked at them in the rearview mirror.  
  
‚ÄúNot a fan?‚Äù I asked Miss Yoshida.  
  
‚ÄúI just wish that she would go out with a nice impressionable boy.¬† Someone like you.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúLike‚Ä¶ me?‚Äù¬† I asked, my heart skipping a beat.  
  
‚ÄúYes.¬† Save all the alphas for the bedroom, but have someone weak and servile in the kitchen.¬† Know what I mean?‚Äù  
  
I gulped, thinking of all the times I had been in the kitchen during her vacation getting a post-coital snack ready for Cass and Leo, ‚ÄúI think I do.‚Äù  
  
We all shuffled into the booth but when Sam met up with us she made me get up and pull up a chair.¬† They all talked with each other like a big happy family as if I wasn‚Äôt there, only they‚Äôd occasionally tell me to pass them something.  
  
I wasn‚Äôt noticed until Cass accidentally spilled some of Mrs. Yoshida‚Äôs sake bottle.  
  
‚ÄúNice one, bitch!‚Äù Said Sam.  
  
‚ÄúOh, shut up!¬† It‚Äôs not that bad!‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine girls, let‚Äôs just clean it.‚Äù  
  
A waitress rushed over with a towel but Mrs. Yoshida shooed her away, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.¬† We made the mess, we‚Äôll clean it up.‚Äù¬† She looked dutifully at Cass.¬† Cass‚Äô cheeks were red as she said, ‚ÄúYeah, we‚Äôre sorry.¬† We‚Äôll clean it up.‚Äù  
  
Then Cass handed me a stack of napkins. Everyone looked at me expectantly, and I realized that when they said ‚ÄòWe‚Äô what they actually meant was \*me.\*  
  
‚ÄúUhm, right away, Miss!‚Äù¬† I said.  
  
Then both Cass and Mrs. Yoshida said, ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù¬† As I got on my hands and knees to clean the stain, Mrs Yoshida exchanged a confused glance with Cass, ‚ÄúYou make him call you ‚ÄòMiss?‚Äô‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYeah!¬† I thought it was really cool and obviously it helped with his obedience.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúJust who is this man to you?‚Äù Mrs. Yoshida asked.  
  
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just Cass‚Äô little simp who follows her around and does everything she says.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúShut. Up. Sam.‚Äù¬† Cass said, ‚ÄúArtie‚Äôs just my friend who likes to be helpful.‚Äù  
  
Mrs. Yoshida gave Cass an impressed nod.¬† The check came.¬† I went back to my seat and Mrs. Yoshida took out her amex black card to pay.  
  
‚ÄúYou can just venmo me your share whenever, Artie.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThank you, miss!‚Äù¬† I said.  
  
We all went back and it was pretty late by that point.¬† Mrs. Yoshida sat at the tv, finally getting some rest from her long trip.  
  
‚ÄúMom!‚Äù Cass said, ‚ÄúLeo and Artie and I are going to be hanging out in my room, okay?‚Äù	‚ÄúYou know the rules!‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúMom!¬† Can‚Äôt I close the door?¬† Not only am I a full adult, Artie‚Äôs literally in there.¬† We‚Äôre not going to, like, get it on in front of Artie.¬† That would be gross!‚Äù  
  
Mrs. Yoshida let out a sigh, ‚ÄúOkay.¬† As long as Artie‚Äôs in there.‚Äù  
  
Cass clapped her little hands and then pulled Leo and me by the wrists as she closed the door behind her.  
  
‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what are we going to do?‚Äù I asked, ‚ÄúWatch a movie?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúUhm, no, Artie!‚Äù¬† Cass said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing me a huge favor just by being here!‚Äù  
  
Leo spanked her, grabbed a handful of her ass and then lunged at her with his lips.¬† He gave her a deep passionate kiss and then picked her up.¬† She squealed as he threw her on the bed.¬† My smile faded as I realized what they were about to do.¬† Could I really watch this?¬† My crush being fucked brutally by her big dicked boyfriend?  
  
‚ÄúArtie,‚Äù Cass snapped me out of my mind.¬† I looked at her.¬† Leo was nuzzling her neck, peppering her with sloppy kisses.¬† In between little gasps she said, ‚ÄúFace the corner.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù I said, stammering, ‚ÄúBut Miss Cass‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been good,‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúCome on, Cass,‚Äù Leo said as his hands started to explore her more, ‚ÄúLet the bitch watch.¬† He should learn how to fuck in case he ever grows a dick.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYes, Thank you, Mr. Leo.‚Äù  
  
As Leo gripped Cass‚Äô wrist, Cass snapped and pointed at the corner, ‚ÄúNose in the corner, mister!‚Äù  
  
I sighed, frustrated.¬† I placed my nose in the corner like I did when she would change in front of me.¬† I could hear the passionate grunts and moans as Leo fucked her inelegantly.¬† I could tell she appreciated it by her chorus of ‚ÄúFuck!‚Äù ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù¬† ‚ÄúFuck me harder!‚Äù  The pain of my chastity belt made me buckle further into the wall.  I let out soft moans as my penis tried to escape confinement  
  
They made a half-hearted attempt to keep their voice down but eventually they both finished strong.¬† They laid in bed for a while before I finally said, ‚ÄúCan I turn around?‚Äù  
  
Through deep panting, Cass said, ‚ÄúYeah.¬† Thanks for the help, Artie!¬† You‚Äôre the best!‚Äù  
  
I turned around.¬† Cass and Leo were naked with sheets covering them, ‚ÄúBefore you leave, pick up our clothes and place them in the load, please.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYes, Miss.¬† May you take off my chastity belt?‚Äù  
  
Cass shook her head as she snuggled into the crook of Leo‚Äôs arm, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got Constance‚Äô party tomorrow, remember?¬† But I will give you your reward!‚Äù

My reward!¬† The reason I did all this.¬† Cass pulled the sheets so that her pussy and some of her tits were covered, revealing her sweaty belly, ‚ÄúGive it a kiss!‚Äù

I placed my hands on the bed and placed my lips on Cass‚Äô wet belly.¬† Giving it a kiss for as long as she would let me.¬† Then she lightly grabbed my hair and pulled me off.

‚ÄúThank you, Miss Cass!‚Äù I said, excitedly.

‚ÄúMy mom texted me to send you to her room.¬† Don‚Äôt keep her waiting.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, miss.¬† Right away.‚Äù  
  
They looked at me from their bed as I picked up their dirty garments, including Leo‚Äôs boxers and Cass‚Äô panties and headed out of her room.  
  
I walked up the stairs and knocked on Mrs. Yoshida‚Äôs door, ‚ÄúCome in.‚Äù¬† I walked in and saw a topless Mrs. Yoshida facing away from me.¬† Her thong accentuated her pert ass.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm- I‚Äôm so sorry!¬† I‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
She looked at me flustered and started laughing.¬† Then she pointed to the spot in front of her and said ‚ÄúCome.‚Äù  
  
I stood in the spot she pointed to as she sat on the bed, rubbing some lotion on her hands.  
  
‚ÄúKneel.‚Äù  
  
I knelt.¬† She placed her hand on my cheek and lightly tapped it. Then she pulled her hand back farther and slapped me.¬† Not so hard that I cried out, but‚Ä¶ harder than a love tap.¬† I shook it off but stayed kneeling.  
  
‚ÄúThank me.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù  
  
She waited.  
  
‚ÄúThank you, Mrs. Yoshida.‚Äù  
  
Then she placed her hand back on my cheek and rubbed the raw mark. I tried not to look down because she had not given me permission to stare at her tits.  
  
‚ÄúI know what you are.‚Äù

Brad Pitt said he needed money for an emergency. :(,"A lot of guys fail to realize that women get scammed too.  Worse, most women get scammed by the true pros.

When you are evaluating your chances of being scammed you have to remember that there are lots of people, mostly men, who get up each morning, have a cup of coffee, kiss their wife, feed their dog, get the kids off to school and go in to work to scam Americans and Europeans.  They might be working romance scams, but they might be working tax, real estate, credit card, inheritance, healthcare, or any of scores of other scams.  If it can be sold online, and sometimes if it can't, scammers are working that industry.

Most of the time they are based out of India, Nigeria, or Bangladesh, but there are still many working in Russia and Eastern Europe.  Countries of the old British Empire have the edge.  They sit in cubicles, just like office workers in the United States or Germany, and move from tax scams to romance or real estate depending on what is rocking.

They are very sophisticated.  They have many profiles on dating apps, probably tens of millions, and the big apps really don't try to hard to stop them. And, when they do after women, it turns out they can often get more money.

This story feels like it‚Äôs about two main things:

# 1. Old Kier/Lumon vs. New Kier/Lumon

There are two characters who‚Äôve seen how Lumon has evolved: Burt and Ms. Cobel.

Burt hints at it when he quotes the ‚Äúold testament‚Äù of Kier to Irving. Irving‚Äôs quote sounds like a warning, but Burt‚Äôs feels more free and philosophical‚Äîlike he‚Äôs reminiscing about better days.

Then there‚Äôs Cobel. She‚Äôs got deep roots in this ‚Äúreligion,‚Äù probably because either she or her mom (most likely her mom) attended the Eagan school for girls. You can tell she despises what the company has turned into, especially in that scene where she confronts Milchick about printing the painting of the massacre. She definitely doesn‚Äôt approve of *new Lumon vibes*.

# 2. The Original Intent vs. The New Intent of Severance

I think Kier‚Äôs original goal for Severance was to help humanity by giving people skills they hadn‚Äôt learned. Imagine creating doctors, scientists, and other skilled professionals just by injecting them with someone else‚Äôs procedural knowledge‚Äîstuff they‚Äôve done so much it‚Äôs second nature.

Here‚Äôs where it gets interesting:

* The ""scary numbers"" probably represent something procedural they instinctively recognize but don‚Äôt consciously understand.
* Irving and Burt‚Äôs relationship could also be part of this‚Äîlike a residual awareness of someone else‚Äôs experiences or preferences.
* And Irving grabbing his keys and driving like he‚Äôs done it a million times? Another clue.

But *new Lumon*? They‚Äôve found a way to tweak this tech so the procedural skills take over consciously. This created Severance as we know it. Now, millionaires and politicians exploit it, using the tech for power. To keep the innies from figuring out the truth, they rewrote the ‚Äúreligious handbook‚Äù to make the system airtight‚Äîno cracks, no merging between innies and outies.

Cobel hates all of this. She‚Äôs old-school Kier, and she wants things to go back to what they were. That‚Äôs why she‚Äôs obsessed with reintegration and pushing Mark to rebel. She provokes him‚Äîlike throwing coffee mugs and yelling at him‚Äîto nudge him toward waking up.

# Ricken‚Äôs Role

Here‚Äôs my theory on Ricken: I think he‚Äôs an Eagan too. Maybe he‚Äôs rebelling against his family. That ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be like my father!‚Äù vibe in his book feels intentional.

And that book? I think it was planted on purpose to wake up the innies. Ricken might even be working with Cobel. We‚Äôve never seen them interact, but one of the trailers shows someone who looks like they could be related to Ricken, so maybe there‚Äôs a connection.

# The Helly Party Scene

This part throws me off a bit. Why was Cobel so angry at Helly?

* Maybe she was faking it, trying to provoke Helly into rebelling even harder.
* Or maybe things spun out of control, and she didn‚Äôt want it to end like that.
* It could also just be some personal grudge toward Helena herself.

# Final Thoughts

Anyway, this is where I‚Äôve landed after five watches. Let me know what you think‚Äîor if I‚Äôm completely off the mark!",2,1736966976.0,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,5,0.75,False

Help.

I've been trying to get into a relationship for years. Heck tried to get into superficial relationships for experience,  but couldn't. I am 25 years of age. This dates back to 2016. So yeah working for a long time. But haven't seen anything. In terms of looks i'd say pretty average. Prolly a 5 even. But god honest , seen people get chicks don't know how i wouldn't even wish them upon my enemy. 
As for dressing, i dress formal and casual. Use perfumes always fresh, and clean. A couple of months ago tried to get into another relationship. The girl is 21 years of age. She was giving signs, lmao sometimes she'd meow at me. But i wasn't alone. You see we work in the same building, its her and my friend. Close friend for, well since we started working in this company together. We'd go out every night with this friend of mine. Play video games, go out for coffee, movies.. etc... he had a GF at that time. As always i was single. He said hey why not try out your luck with let's name her Robin? Said ok can you be my wing man? Cause he had been in many relationships. He said go for it, just be you. Nothing much after. No more tips. I was being myself. Everything was fine, we were joking and planning schedule together. Then she turned. My friend broke up with his GF now his ex. And now they're together. 

Tired af.

I was covered in my usual arrangement of backpack, purse, coffee, and empty shopping bags as I stepped around patches of ice on the way to my car when a sound brought me to a halt. I looked up and saw flight after flight of Canada geese heading ... north east, after a quick calculation. It was an odd time of year for them to move in groups like this (not to mention the wrong direction entirely for southern Alberta in January) and I watched as more and more appeared from the crest of my house and smiled. Being a bird nerd, I took a moment to enjoy the sounds of their conversations as I imagined what they were talking about - who's turn it is in front, why is Frank going with the wrong group, someone tell Gertrude to get her tail in gear.

*They used to flock in thousands, you know. Millions. More birds than sky.*

I felt her presence behind me as a tingle on my scalp and a twitch in my neck muscles. It felt as always like a comforting hand on the shoulder, a bodyguard of the soul. Her voice came into my mind unbidden, as it often did when I was distracted.

""I wish I could have seen that"" I said to her in my mind.

*You would have lost your damn mind*¬†floated in my my head, with a hint of amusement.

""Will birds ever flock like that again? In millions, like in the stories I heard?""

A pregnant silence hung between us for a few moments.

*Yes, but not in your time, or your child's.*

""Damn. That would have been something else.""

*You see things every day that are magic to your ancestors.*

I take a deep breath and watch as the last flight honks and flaps its way overhead. ""True.""

The Morrigan is about to leave my side as I get into my car, but I hear her one last time while settling into my seat.

What are some suggestions for a generally comparable or slightly upgraded machines? We're not doing a lot of milk-based drinks so pulling a quality shot or three with some consistency is more important than the quality/ease of the steam wand. If it matters, I have most of the basic gear (Baratza Encore grinder, a tamper, a scale, a steam pitcher, and demitasses we like).  
  
Longer version: after pulling several thousand of shots over the last 12 years, I had gotten dialed in using the EC702's stock pressurized portafilters (didn't even realize a bottomless portafilter mod was a thing for the EC702 until now) to yield about as good a shot as I think the equipment was capable of handling. Which is to say, I know that exact setup quite well (and know coffee pretty well generally), but I have no other basis of comparison for other espresso machines.   
  
I'd be happy to upgrade a bit, but I'm not likely to spring for a significantly more expensive or more complicated machine for several reasons--(1) espresso isn't our main daily form coffee these days and is more of a treat, (2) our kitchen counter real estate isn't tiny but it's not unlimited, and (3) though I'll be the person using it >90% of the time (and I'm not afraid to dive and monkey a bit to get better results), I don't want a machine so complicated or temperamental that my wife won't be able to pull a shot that is at least palatable when she does occasionally use it. Something like the Gaggia Classic Pro (which I only know about because it's the budget pick on Wirecutter and now from seeing a few vintage posts on this sub about folks upgrading to it from the EC702) is probably about as pricey as we'd be looking to go, but I'm could be open to persuasion if paying a bit more would greatly increase the quality, ease, or consistency of use. Also certainly wouldn't be sad to be paying a bit less....

(These are the shadows of the penners's own tormented thoughts, his private scrawls, and nothing beyond. Therefore, if the reader should find these passages to be disjointed, let him not despair. All in this world lacks any true coherence‚Ä¶
In the end, even if you perceive yourself as possessed of perfect lucidity, it does not diminish the likelihood that, at any moment, without the slightest warning, you shall be stripped of reason, and not even recognize the fact‚Ä¶
We are all touched by madness, and no soul exists in perfect health. Sanity is but a phantom of the human mind.)

Having awoken one day from a sleep that was most unwholesome, feeling only a surge of relentless, cruel chill, and with a profound aversion to all action‚Äîstill caught betwixt slumber and wakefulness‚ÄîI did cast my gaze through the window, to observe the environs of this day's Wallsport, a place which possessed naught of distinction, save its close proximity to some village. And that day was not, it seemed, a herald of events of striking brilliance, nor of joyous celebration; for there was only a fetid and overcast sky. And all about were structures veiled in a fog of such density that nothing could be disc erned from the earth below, and I myself am situated on that uppermost level‚Äîor, rather, within that chamber, the fourth of its kind‚Äîif my memory does not betray me. Gray and nigh-black clouds did weave about, drawing a pattern as of some braid, in which was caught the gray tresses of a relentlessly hideous and abhorrent monstrosity‚Äîa semblance of humanity only partly perceived by my senses. As if some ghastly phantom, it did stir within my mind, denying even slumber, which now more closely resembles a plunge into the very abyss of forgetfulness. And that sensation itself, was most distressing; I dreaded to close my eyes, and shuddered at the slightest resistance from my orbs, as if some unseen hand did, involuntarily, touch my thin, bony shoulder, bringing forth a wave of sickness that did long endure. And even now, it seems so near. And I am tormented by thoughts‚Ä¶ I feel as if I am bound by another's will, and now, I desire‚ÄîI desire with a terrible longing, to journey to the station, for a moment haunts my soul in which I cast myself toward the rails, and feel myself crushed between the platform and the train‚Äîshould such a fate befall me. I perceive already, the agony of shattered bone, of crushed entrails, of torn sinews‚Ä¶ worse than any viscera dangling from a carcass‚Ä¶ and I am seized by a terrible urge to grasp my brushes and my paints, for I am unwilling to sacrifice this precious life. For it is not fitting to barter such worth for so trivial an end; unless to render it within the bounds of a painting. The torment within my head, does fill even me, its possessor, with a most dreadful amazement‚Ä¶ and terror‚Ä¶
These phantasmal thoughts do, at times, surge into my mind from some unseen origin, disrupting my accustomed affairs‚Äîbe they of domestic duty, labor, or study. They have ever been my unwelcome companions, and I understand fully that the very content of my contemplations is not of the norm; yet, my reason appears as my foe, ever seeking to wage war upon my cold nature, and craving that surge‚Äîthat surge of dangerous impetuosity‚Äîthat threatens to imprison my soul within the fetid confines of some asylum for the deranged, which I now fear as I fear the very fires of the inferno. How am I to avoid plummeting into that lowest abyss‚Ä¶?
Nonetheless, even within those surges of madness that were wrought by my thoughts, I could, with great effort, maintain a semblance of composure; and such was the case upon this day. Having turned, involuntarily, from the window, still observing as the clouds did smother all before me, I could not find any peace within my thoughts; but with a dismissive gesture, I did then venture into the kitchen. My repast differed naught from the commonplace; a simple omelet with a cup of coffee, and no more; and my appetite did not penetrate that door, which was secured against my very will. Therefore, I did not consume it with the ravenous hunger that would have possessed a man who had languished for days during the Great Depression (1929-1939), one who had recently lost his employment, and squandered all of his accumulated income, upon the provision of his own children. Thoughts whirled within my skull, like an unending vortex, and my reason became unmoored; my hands trembled in the attempt to focus upon a single point‚Äîyet, all endeavors were to no avail. Consumed by a most extraordinary disquiet, I did abandon my repast halfway through, leaving what remained upon the plate, not placing the dishes in the sink; and I did not again return to that place. My senses were now overwhelmed; my vision did grow dim, as I removed my chemise, and donned a brown checkered suit, of somewhat more presentable form, and did observe myself in the glass. To where was I bound, in such attire?... an expedition, of most particular importance, did await, together with my companions, and to arrive late would be most inexcusable; thus, I had risen early to prepare. Yet there was naught of reaction to my form upon my countenance; before me appeared but a face, that was pale as death itself, emaciated almost to the very bone, riddled with veins (most especially upon my temples). My form resembled a living skeleton‚Äîthough why this be, I know not. The bags beneath my eyes were turning to that blackest of shades, which had once inspired terror, but now, I held them in a profound indifference, for I had often seen the faces of others, amazed by my appearance, and uttering words that spoke of my likeness to a corpse. And in some manner, I am inclined to agree with them.
The thing I felt... a wild stench from the smoke from the enterprises, from which I felt like a passive smoker, standing next to heavy smokers, and inhaling this smoke, which disappeared with each of my breaths. My lungs seemed to refuse to fill with such air, and with such an aroma, which is why I had to cough several times in moments.
‚ÄúOh, God of mercy‚Ä¶,"" did a discordant bell peal within the confines of my skull, as I was brought to a standstill by such unexpectedness‚Äî""...what if‚Ä¶? What if we are destined for utter failure‚Ä¶? Yes‚Ä¶ the semblance of this environment, is a mere deception‚Ä¶ they harbor another design, most assuredly. Perhaps‚Ä¶ they are all in league with one another‚Ä¶ a conspiracy in which I am but an unwitting pawn, knowing naught of its true purpose. Can it be‚Ä¶ that they converse in some language utterly alien‚Ä¶? No‚Ä¶that is not possible. Ha-ha‚Ä¶it may be that I do not comprehend, but‚Ä¶they shall conceal nothing from my sight. M-hm‚Ä¶ they will conceal nothing‚Ä¶‚Äù.
As that last word was framed in my mind, I was at the very threshold, when the following thought did flood back, and it was not a thought that I did welcome:
‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ could it be that I have forgotten something‚Ä¶? Nay‚Ä¶ I could have forgotten nothing, for my gaze was watchful. Ah, yes‚Ä¶ the keys! Surely, I could not have left them within that lock‚Ä¶! What if, even now, some intruder has penetrated my abode‚Ä¶? Oh heavens‚Ä¶! Oh, heavens, that must not come to pass by any means‚Ä¶!‚Äù.
In the throes of an incomprehensible fit, did I lose all comprehension of the present moment; but that was but a fleeting shadow, for as my body did stir beneath the force of a howling wind‚Äîwhich did seem to take on the very nature of a tempest‚ÄîI awoke, yet, only opened my eyes, and could not feel, nor perceive, the presence of my own form. That invisible force did drag me back into the hall, no matter how I struggled with all that remained of my reason, and I felt as if I were imprisoned. But then, did I release myself, and regaining control of my flesh, found myself at the door of my chamber. There was no key within that lock; therefore, did I begin to rifle through my bag‚Äîwhich I had seized before my departure‚Äîand threw it over my shoulder, casting furtive glances at the yellowish, festering walls, adorned with dark colors that did resemble stains and blots that were dissolving everywhere‚Äîa sight that I did find most abhorrent. Then did I glance at the floor, which was covered by dark brown canvas, and I felt the cold touch of what I knew was metal, and I was quick to extract it; and it was‚Äîthe key. Oh‚Ä¶the relief was so immense that my deep sigh did seem as a great river, and it was as loud as the death rattle of a dying man. And it was then that I did fall silent and begin to gaze all around me. Not a soul‚Ä¶none had noticed‚Ä¶none were casting those suspicious glances. None would perceive the shadows of my thoughts. A reprieve, for a second.
Nevertheless, returning to a semblance of myself, I made for the stairs, old, and yet, not bereft of their former appearance, if one did not perceive the peeling paint. With every single step I took, it did seem as though my heart was about to burst from my very breast, and my breath was seized‚ÄîI was forced to stop, and pause, repeatedly. The ascent was not so great in length; but it appeared to me to be endless, and it did twist like a spiral before my very eyes. And after I had gathered myself, I once more stood before that door to the entrance, and, as I glanced, observing the hue (which now approached that of burgundy, but it was, in truth, brown, for the paint was peeling and falling upon the stone below), did I rush away, whilst glancing back‚Äîfearful that I should forget the path. A coincidence it was, and unexpected, that we were, with our group, bound for the station, and naught else, save to meet with them first; and a tremor did seize me, and my hands shook. And while I could proclaim that I was given to fits of unexpected agitation, to me, such things were mundane e, as was all else. I did never desire to take anything sinister to heart, for I had come to believe, that the shadows were not eternal. Then I traversed the crowds. The streets were possessed of both noise and a great inflexibility in their sound; merchants cried out, from some unknown source; the stalls did tremble in the gusts of the wind; and from some distance, I could discern: ‚ÄúBuy my bread! I have baked it myself!‚Äù. There was even one who did hawk tobacco. But one sensation, I could not deny‚Äîthe wild stench from the smoke of the manufactories, and I felt like a passive smoker‚Äîstanding next to one who did partake in such practice with great zeal, inhaling that smoke, which did depart with my each breath. My lungs did refuse to fill with such air, and with such a scent, which forced me to cough, repeatedly, in a short period of time. 
And there was one square, which remained the sole exception in Wallsport, bereft of name, its marker but a crude circle, and naught beyond, that was distinguished by its arcane embellishment. Stones of varied hues and shapes, arranged with meticulous precision into an ancient mosaic‚Äîencircled by a ring of gray bricks‚Äîdid glimmer as if possessed by some inner fire. And, it would seem, they composed a scene of a subject so shrouded in mystery that no mortal mind could unravel it: a man struck through the heart by a spear, wielded by a shadow, wrought of ebony stones, while at that very point of violent entry‚Äîand from which the weapon did emerge‚Äîa grim monument rose, crafted of bronze, depicting some monstrous entity with clocks, hung upon chain s, in its left hand‚Äîwhich far exceeded in size the breadth of its palm‚Äînay, perhaps, even its entire limb. Encompassing this mosaic and the looming monument was naught but a barren expanse; no dwellings, no taverns, no inns, and no trifling adornments did appear‚Äîonly this desolate space, that did disrupt the perimeter with three diverging paths. Rarely did any carriage traverse this square; to behold one seemed a feat most improbable, and when they did present themselves to the eye, they appeared but abominable visions, vanishing as swiftly as they came, when some unfortunate soul, broken by a torrent of rising dread, did turn abruptly. And that feeling was most vile, as it surged through me, accompanied by a frosty draft‚Äîor so it seemed‚Äîthat left me shivering from head to heel. From such turnings, I was oft seized by a burning sensation‚Äîmost peculiar‚Äîyet, with a quality that was painful, yet, not agonizing.
Still, I did cast my gaze upon it for a while‚Äî and, it would seem, admired those empty surroundings‚Äîembracing that long awaited silence, and then did turn towards the right, directly to that path which presented itself first to mine eyes. Thereupon, a few paces hence, the aspect of the streets changed, and the discordant clamor did re-establish itself, for the station was but a few miles distant, and as for the ticket‚Äîno worry was there to be had, for all was arranged, since, at the behest of my superiors, my colleagues and I were upon this ‚Äújourney of affairs,‚Äù to employ the local vernacular. I then recalled, that until now, I had never traversed such quarters‚Ä¶ had never been‚Ä¶ or, perchance, had been. Nay‚Ä¶I had been! A treachery of my own memory! And then did I emit what seemed a most profound sigh, and I once more perceived that river‚Äîa winding stream that flowed, not in a long thread, but in a spiraling descent. My steps did echo in my ears, amidst this din, and were, it did seem, far more resounding than the din itself; yet, well it was, that they did not deafen me‚Äîa blessing that I would not lose my hearing. And I did notice none, but went upon my path, which seemed at times, but a narrow tunnel; and naught else did I see beyond that, for all around me did blur, as if it were the vision of one who was sightless, who beheld a world that was far apart from this. Alas, I have not the slightest knowledge of how long I went, when I did finally arrive at the station, and survey all thereat. 
Through the putrid walls of that station, water did seem to seep, drop by agonizing drop, moistening the cement that did bind together a myriad of dark, earthy bricks‚Äîwhich appeared to be, at any moment, upon the precipice of collapse, ready to fall upon me. Such was my perception. The gates were so frail, that their very fastenings did struggle to maintain their hold; the sable paint‚Äîalas‚Äîdid not appear truly black, but rather did blend to the hue of tarnished copper, though‚Ä¶the color did change from time to time. To the right of the gate, upon a massive hook, hung an enormous bell, already about to shatter the failing metal beneath its mass, and when a guard did approach (though, he remained invisible), a chilling sound did erupt, and that nearly deafened me. It was unlike the sound of my footsteps.
Soon, with a creak that was like a needle in my ear, did the gates open, and I did proceed with a slow pace to the square. After presenting my tickets and the papers, I would have rushed directly to the platform, but my intentions were stayed by a hand that did abruptly seize my shoulder.
‚ÄúIntentionally‚Ä¶,‚Äù I did declare, ‚Äúdid you touch me‚Ä¶?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy, brother,‚Äù there followed a voice, that was most familiar, ‚Äúyou did not seem thus yesterday. Do you not recognize me?‚Äù
Those words were sufficient to make me turn to their speaker, and how great was my astonishment to perceive, before me, my four colleagues‚ÄîI had thought they would not arrive at the same t ime. It was strange that I had entertained the thought, that something might not proceed as was intended, or that I did not perceive‚Äîhad not perceived‚Äîthat such a thing might occur.
‚ÄúNeil‚Ä¶,‚Äù I did murmur in shame, lowering my head, ‚Äúyou, my companions, must forgive my folly‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat devil makes you seek forgiveness?!‚Äù Greg, who stood beside Neil, did exclaim, as he adjusted his flaxen rags, ‚ÄúYou are likely weary from yesterday; thus, you do grow foolish in your delirium!‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat am I raving of‚Ä¶?‚Äù
‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶‚Äù Neil did interject, ‚Äútrouble not yourself. He does exaggerate. Let us proceed‚Ä¶‚Äù
My gaze did become rigid (according to the feelings that did possess me), as Neil did pat me twice upon my shoulder, and then did we march towards the platform; and once we had left the door behind, there were visible only two deep pits at the perimeter. How should I tread, so as not to fall into them; and I desired‚ÄîI desired to see that image that was present to my sight as I awoke in the morning. I desired to‚Ä¶ no‚Äîthat is not to be. In no way, should such a thing come to pass. Oh, heavens‚Ä¶ what is this‚Ä¶ Is it truly I‚Ä¶ ? No‚Ä¶
One fleeting instant, and I was everywhere, and nowhere. Everywhere, yet, nowhere. In a chasm such as no mortal had ever witnessed, nor ever endured. All did dissolve before me, and gradually, a darkness did take hold before my gaze, and so did blacken my vision. My body no longer obeyed my will, and, it did seem that I was in some state that lay beyond understanding. That force did drag me again into some place‚Äîbut this time, it was into the void. From afar, or, perchance, close by, I could hear only the frenzied cries of those who passed, while some did beg for help in an attempt to escape that unknown place; yet, I was devoid of any perception of their plight. Neil and Greg‚Äîtheir cries did reach my ears, but I did not comprehend, for the sounds were as blurred as an echo, and I could perceive only the beating of my own heart, and the sound of convulsive inhalations. Naught could I hear beyond those sounds, and those very sounds did deafen all else. Then, suddenly‚Ä¶ silence‚Äîa deathly silence. A void of sound, and nothing more. Darkness, ‚Ä¶and nothing more.
And, in the passing of some moments, it did become clear that it would not retreat‚Ä¶never. Despair was born within my very chest. It was as if all of my plans were being destroyed in this chasm. And an even greater despair did seize me, as I reopened my eyes. There was naught around me, except soft walls, stitched in a large pattern of squares; and hearing did return, though I could not understand what had befallen me.
‚ÄúHold‚Ä¶on‚Ä¶,‚Äù a low, lisping voice did suddenly echo from some distance, ‚Äúwhat, precisely, is the matter?‚Äù
‚ÄúLikely, he did push a man,‚Äù another responded, ‚Äú...and the man was crushed betwixt that platform and the onrushing train‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶how?! How did he have the will to commit such an act?!‚Äù
‚ÄúLet us delve into his very skull and learn‚Ä¶‚Äù

I‚Äôm male, 44 uk based and previously a sufferer of severe cpps here‚Äôs my story. 

It started for me like many others with what felt like a UTI. Honestly felt like my bladder was on fire. 

At that time I went straight to the doctors and was prescribed antibiotics for the supposed uti. 

The antibiotics seemed to work at first, test results were done. Urine and bloods. 

Bloods were all fine, as was the urine and all symptoms went away after a few days. 

Two months later I had the exact same feeling. More antibiotics and tests. Again bloods were ok but this time there was microscopic blood in my urine. 

I was immediately booked for a cystoscopy, doctors circled with more drugs. My bladder seemed to recover. But this time I was also prescribed antibiotics fungal cream. 

A few weeks past and I had the exact same thing again. Though now the tip of my penis felt burning and swollen.

More tests. More microscopic blood in urine. Freaking out big time. 

It was at this point my cystoscopy date came. 

Not the greatest moment of my life but it‚Äôs ok, nothing to worry about.  

At the appointment you have to answer questions regarding your occupation. Writing comedy for a living is always a bit of a tricky thing to answer to anyone as people often give their opinions or stories. But having a camera down my wee hole whilst the urologist tells me ‚Äúthis would be a funny sitcom scene‚Äù was quite an experience. 

Cystoscopy was all clear, bladder cancer is actually incredibly rare for people my age. 

But my symptoms got worse. 

I started to feel the ball type feeling in my perineum. Sitting down was really tough. 
The tip of my penis still felt on fire. 
My urine flow was not the flowing stream it once was and my bladder started to inflame more and more. 

They put me on more antibiotics (cipro x6 weeks). Not good. Felt hollow or kinda like I was made of polystyrene. 

I started to feel like a rubber band was tighten around the base of my penis. It was awful. 

I spent weeks in beds. I had such a great doctor, but he just had no idea what was going on.  

I started to research this, like I would at work. Finding online publications but also small community groups online with actual people who seemed to be suffering the same. I came here. It was a breakthrough. 

I knew my problem was not going to be fixed with a magic pill. But this was something far deeper. 

I turned to physiotherapy. Firstly finding stretching vids online they helped a little. But then finding professional help. 

I found Karl Monahan at the pelvic pain matters clinic in London. I owe this guy so much. But at first his waiting list meant I was months away from any help. 

I googled more places and found Six physio in London. They also treated Male pelvic matters. Supposedly. 
A young physiotherapist there kinda had some idea but was appalling at after care. This condition needs more than just a 1 hour consultation. It needs bespoke care. I emailed him once or twice inbetween an appointment to ask a simple question and he straight out told me not to email him. Terrible for the price I‚Äôd paid. Uncaring tosspot. 

Eventually I went to the pelvic pain matters clinic . They explained so much. My body was a cup that was completely over flowing. I needed to stop and stop the brutal chaos it was under. 

THE HEALING BIT. 

This is an illness that often strikes people who lead busy lives and suffer from anxiety. Or people that have been in immense stress or even grief. It is an acute stress condition. 

This illness is your nervous system in complete distress and it‚Äôs coming out in the pelvic area.

The recovery to this illness is about resetting your system. Relaxing your entire body and breathing and gently stretching your pelvic area especially. 

This comes with watching how much activity you do. I often see here that people are trying to effort this away. Your effort should be in calming every ounce of you down. 

What you eat is important.  for me my bladder was so sensitive, I came to understand that it was my nerves being so sensitive to anything slightly irritable. No spicy food. Coffee or even sparkling water. No booze. (Do this right and you‚Äôll eat and drink all these things again.) 

The mild stretching and some pressure points stuff did work for me. But what really made me turn a corner was when I realised i need to completely rewrite and destress my body. 

Mild yoga. Can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm writing this tbh. But delicate stretching of the area and really breathing in to your pelvis is key. 

Do not over do anything. You can‚Äôt stretch this away or exercise it off. I was told to not do more than 4500 steps a day. Relaxation is everything. So many people don‚Äôt do this. Even the stretching vids on YouTube are actually too much. 

Go gentle! Or You‚Äôll just keep re triggering everything. 

Meditation. Full body awareness meditation. At least ten mins a day. Breath. Relax. Again. Breathe in to your pelvic floor. Best position for me was a gentle squat and deep breaths. Hold for 5 then slow release.

I found Setraline helped with my anxiety. 

I was constantly putting creams on the tip of my penis. I stopped all this. Actually it seemed the initial anti fungal cream had started an irritation. Only using Vaseline to give it a barrier from inevitable urine and enable it to recover. 

You are trying to relax the tightest of tight muscles here. They are contorting, seizing up and sending emergency signals to your brain. 

You will be ok. It‚Äôs the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever been through. I felt suicidal and helpless. The doctors and specialists knew so little. 

But thanks to people like Karl at pelvic pain matters I started to understand this. 

He has a lot of amazing videos on YouTube btw. Follow it. It takes time. You will one hundred percent have flare ups. But it will work.

Eventually I went to the pelvic pain matters clinic . They explained so much. My body was a cup that was completely over flowing. I needed to stop and stop the brutal chaos it was under. 

THE HEALING BIT. 

This is an illness that often strikes people who lead busy lives and suffer from anxiety. Or people that have been in immense stress or even grief. It is an acute stress condition. 

This illness is your nervous system in complete distress and it‚Äôs coming out in the pelvic area.

The recovery to this illness is about resetting your system. Relaxing your entire body and breathing and gently stretching your pelvic area especially. 

This comes with watching how much activity you do. I often see here that people are trying to effort this away. Your effort should be in calming every ounce of you down. 

What you eat is important.  for me my bladder was so sensitive, I came to understand that it was my nerves being so sensitive to anything slightly irritable. No spicy food. Coffee or even sparkling water. No booze. (Do this right and you‚Äôll eat and drink all these things again.) 

The mild stretching and some pressure points stuff did work for me. But what really made me turn a corner was when I realised i need to completely rewrite and destress my body. 

Mild yoga. Can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm writing this tbh. But delicate stretching of the area and really breathing in to your pelvis is key. 

Do not over do anything. You can‚Äôt stretch this away or exercise it off. I was told to not do more than 4500 steps a day. Relaxation is everything. So many people don‚Äôt do this. Even the stretching vids on YouTube are actually too much. 

Go gentle! Or You‚Äôll just keep re triggering everything. 

Meditation. Full body awareness meditation. At least ten mins a day. Breath. Relax. Again. Breathe in to your pelvic floor. Best position for me was a gentle squat and deep breaths. Hold for 5 then slow release.

I found Setraline helped with my anxiety. 

I was constantly putting creams on the tip of my penis. I stopped all this. Actually it seemed the initial anti fungal cream had started an irritation. Only using Vaseline to give it a barrier from inevitable urine and enable it to recover. 

You are trying to relax the tightest of tight muscles here. They are contorting, seizing up and sending emergency signals to your brain. 

You will be ok. It‚Äôs the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever been through. I felt suicidal and helpless. The doctors and specialists knew so little. 

But thanks to people like Karl at pelvic pain matters I started to understand this. 

He has a lot of amazing videos on YouTube btw. Follow it. It takes time. You will one hundred percent have flare ups. But it will work.

1i24ack,https://www.reddit.com/r/Prostatitis/comments/1i24ack/cpps_full_recovery_uk_male_44/,Cpps full recovery UK male 44,"Hi there, 

I‚Äôm male, 44 uk based and previously a sufferer of severe cpps here‚Äôs my story. 

It started for me like many others with what felt like a UTI. Honestly felt like my bladder was on fire. 

At that time I went straight to the doctors and was prescribed antibiotics for the supposed uti. 

The antibiotics seemed to work at first, test results were done. Urine and bloods. 

Bloods were all fine, as was the urine and all symptoms went away after a few days. 

Two months later I had the exact same feeling. More antibiotics and tests. Again bloods were ok but this time there was microscopic blood in my urine. 

I was immediately booked for a cystoscopy, doctors circled with more drugs. My bladder seemed to recover. But this time I was also prescribed antibiotics fungal cream. 

A few weeks past and I had the exact same thing again. Though now the tip of my penis felt burning and swollen.

More tests. More microscopic blood in urine. Freaking out big time. 

It was at this point my cystoscopy date came. 

Not the greatest moment of my life but it‚Äôs ok, nothing to worry about.  

At the appointment you have to answer questions regarding your occupation. Writing comedy for a living is always a bit of a tricky thing to answer to anyone as people often give their opinions or stories. But having a camera down my wee hole whilst the urologist tells me ‚Äúthis would be a funny sitcom scene‚Äù was quite an experience. 

Cystoscopy was all clear, bladder cancer is actually incredibly rare for people my age. 

But my symptoms got worse. 

I started to feel the ball type feeling in my perineum. Sitting down was really tough. 
The tip of my penis still felt on fire. 
My urine flow was not the flowing stream it once was and my bladder started to inflame more and more. 

They put me on more antibiotics (cipro x6 weeks). Not good. Felt hollow or kinda like I was made of polystyrene. 

I started to feel like a rubber band was tighten around the base of my penis. It was awful. 

I spent weeks in beds. I had such a great doctor, but he just had no idea what was going on.  

I started to research this, like I would at work. Finding online publications but also small community groups online with actual people who seemed to be suffering the same. I came here. It was a breakthrough. 

I knew my problem was not going to be fixed with a magic pill. But this was something far deeper. 

I turned to physiotherapy. Firstly finding stretching vids online they helped a little. But then finding professional help. 

I found Karl Monahan at the pelvic pain matters clinic in London. I owe this guy so much. But at first his waiting list meant I was months away from any help. 

I googled more places and found Six physio in London. They also treated Male pelvic matters. Supposedly.

But it is uncomfortable to have on for a decent period of time so I still spend 85-90% of my day laying in bed.

  
Prior to my injury, I would start my day off at 4:30am. Now I wake up around 5:30am and start work at 7am. I'm still trying to be patient with myself here because I don't like that one bit. Today, after breakfast, I actually had no will left to work at 7am so I went back to sleep, for the first time in years. I woke up around 9am, had some coffee and started to work my way into it.

  
On my X account, I was giving some advice to a stranger who was looking for advice on what to do when lacking motivation. My message said: 

""*Reflection is key here. I journal my thoughts, identify my top priority, and focus on tackling a very small step towards that priority to build momentum.* 

*Sometimes we gotta remind ourselves about our purpose. Why we do what we do*""

  
Ironically, that gave me a jolt of motivation, because I reminded myself of why I do what I do. No one is paying me to help others - in fact I am literally crippled and motivating others! I know I will find my joy back in this unfortunate situation, I always do. This is all part of the process.

1i24771,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i24771,Simple addition that improved my Robot Flow,"I initially bought my Robot as a ‚Äúsecond machine‚Äù. I figured I‚Äôd make shots in the afternoon or weekends with alternate interesting beans (I typically pull the same beans) and take it along on a couple family car trips, to the lake or mountains every year.. 

I was immediately sold on the espresso- better than any machine I‚Äôve owned, in a run of home espresso machines spanning 25yrs.. when I bought a Bellman steamer and realized I could steam milk without an espresso machine- the Semi-Auto got packed up and moved to the garage.. 

There are a few things you miss from an espresso machine.. warm cups, warm portafilter, and steam on-demand are high on the list‚Ä¶ a trade off for better espresso, a better brewing experience and easy clean up and near zero maintenance.. but still, I longed for a streamlined work flow, and wanted to get back to that ‚Äúsub 10 minute morning cappuccinos‚Äù routine I had with the semi-auto.. 

This little coffee cup warmer (and a Morning Dream/review to come) really improved my morning robot flow, eliminating little annoyances and getting me back to a nice quick morning routine.. 

https://www.amazon.com/Misby-Heating-Settings-Shut-Off-Ultra-Thin/dp/B0DGTT8R6D

The warmer is quite simple, cost <$30, gets pretty hot, and has a rudimentary timer that lets you set it to turn on in a chosen number of hours.. 

I will say- I do not brew light roasts, and I assumed I would be in the ‚Äúno pre-heat‚Äù camp in regards to Basket, but I could never get past grinding in to a cold basket.. i can‚Äôt say if the heating of the PF and Basket will be enough for people who demand thorough pre-heating, especially at the default heat. I also don‚Äôt like to steam my milk too hot, but at the same time, I don‚Äôt want a cold drink because it was made in a cold cup.. I was also annoyed at the hot water in the cup pre-heat and drying after routine‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a fussy Bitch.

The warmer can be set to turn on some number of hours From setting. So at 8pm I can set it for 10hrs, and it will turn on at 6am(earlier the better) to its default temp of 130¬∞f. This temp gives a nice gentle warming to the cup and basket. When I walk in the kitchen I move it to 180¬∞ and in a couple minutes it‚Äôs noticeably hotter.. more time at 180¬∞ would be better, but it is acceptable.. with 10+ minutes at 180¬∞ the cup reads 200¬∞ in its bottom with an IR thermometer.. with the portafilter and basket on the warmer, the PF is quite hot to the touch, but the handle is only warm‚Ä¶ if you split milk for 2 drinks, a minute or 2 on the warmer while steaming in 1 pitcher, makes sure your 2nd pitcher isn‚Äôt cold.. pulled shots can be parked back on the warmer while you steam your milk‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure there are other uses, especially for Pour Over.. 

The funny timer is probably a perk, because the unit will never turn on unless you pre-set it the night before, eliminating it being hot when you don‚Äôt intend to use it, like a standard outlet timer might.. 

The biggest negative on the warmer is the default temp of 130¬∞ when using the timer‚Ä¶

We have YOUNG kids: baby, toddler, preschooler. I want to be considerate of the other cruisers and not invade spaces that are intended to be peaceful/adult. I also want to make sure my kids enjoy their time too. They're well behaved and at all rowdy, but they babble and giggle and, let's be honest, the occasionally cry (we do have a baby, after all).

On the last cruise we were on with Holland America, there was a big viewing room at the front of the ship. It had big windows, coffee, treats, couches, board games, and a ""family friendly"" atmosphere (despite not being a cruise aimed toward kids). 

I didn't even think to check ahead of time, because every cruise I've been on have had these neutral spaces. 

Is there anywhere like that on the Ruby Princess? Where would you recommend hanging with young kids?

For some reason, other mothers ive talked to in person will agree with me and show the opposite or theyll agree,,, but then like- add onto it? like ""Yeah of course my child is the most important thing but.."" or ""and i also need to put my interests into consideration."" I understand the sentiment but for some reason it keeps making me unreasonably angry. Maybe because I never wanted anything other than this? It gets hard but once I had my kid I cant imagine having any other mindset. She is the most important thing. No buts. No ands. No what ifs. Maybe because I had abusive parents that made everything about them is the reason Im so angry over this? Im just really tired of having conversations with other moms where they basically brag about not doing something their kid needed or wanted because they need to just ""deal with it"" and whine about how theyre more important. I dont know. In my head thats what family does. They stick together and do whatever it is possible to support eachother even if its not exactly what you want to do.

Im not boasting or bragging about ignoring my kid cuz I ""need a day off"" or something like that. Or like, straight up just talking shit about a literal baby. Like, its a baby? Idk. Maybe thats clearer, maybe thats not. I do have my life outside my baby. I dont understand not loving her to the extent that Im not always thinking about how to make life better, how to properly co exist, etc. Theres so many parents I speak to who act and speak about their children as if they owe them something for being born.

First off, these aren't just sunglasses. No way. They're like the Swiss Army Knife of eyewear, if the Swiss Army Knife were also a sustainable fashion icon that would make even the most ardent tree-huggers do a double-take.

- **Sustainable Style**: You know how you feel after eating a big, healthy, green salad? That's your soul on Johnny Fly. The materials, my eco-concerned comrades, are biodegradable, ethically sourced, and they're giving plastic frames the side-eye they deserve.

- **Look and Feel**: Imagine Morgan Freeman's voice or the feel of fresh bed sheets, but for your face. Yes, that's what we're talking about. These frames aren't just visually stunning, they sit on your snout like a cloud on a calm day.

- **Lens Loot**: Oh, their lenses are not just tinted windows for your peepers. They've got UV protection, blue light filtration, and a polarized option that'll cut glare faster than a ninja in a butter factory.

Now, let's chuckle at some of those Johnny Fly contours that are snazzier than an otter with a pocket square:

- **The Classic Look**: Round lenses, anyone? John Lennon called. He wants his specs back...except, Johnny Fly's are like, WAY cooler because of, you know...sustainability and all that jazz.

- **The ‚ÄòI Mean Business‚Äô Design**: Picture a pair of these square-framed beauts perched on your nose, perfect for when you want to seriously consider whether to have caramel or hazelnut syrup in your coffee.

- **The Aviator Flair**: Those teardrop frames are not just for pilots and 80's cop shows anymore. They‚Äôre destiny for anyone who's ever fantasized about looking unfathomably cool while eating an ice cream cone in the park.

 - **Don't Go Out Of Fashion **: They've got the versatility of a chameleon at a paint mixing convention. They practically transcend the concept of time. You're investing in the future. Your grandkids will thank you - and they'll look epic, too.

So why Johnny Fly, you ask? It's not just about looking magnificent, though that's a pretty big plus. It's about investment pieces; those sunny pals for your face that just keep on giving. Wear 'em with pride, with conscience, and maybe, just maybe, with a touch of that swagger that says, ""I know where it's at."" And where it's at is Johnny Fly.

1i23xyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/amwfdating/comments/1i23xyz/34_m_england_uk_floating_on_water_close_to_a/,34 [M] England UK - floating on water close to a waterfall,"Honestly no clue why I wrote that in my title, it was the first thing that came into my head. Two weeks since the New Year has passed for many but my New Year isn‚Äôt due for another two weeks so I guess I‚Äôm here hoping to find someone in time for the Lunar New Year. British Chinese, 5‚Äô7 and slim if that matters. 

Hopeless romantic that‚Äôs trying to find their forever +1 that loves bad jokes and a travel partner, lover of coffee and good food, so exploring new cafes or restaurants are always on my list if I have the time. City breaks or weekend lie ins snuggling up in this cold weather or putting on something horror so you don‚Äôt leave my side, or I don‚Äôt leave your side ü§≠. Hoping to travel back to Asia this year, have a few countries I want to tick off my list!

And I guess anime and gaming will need to be thrown in the mix here, although lately I haven‚Äôt done too much of either, slowly working my way back into them. Love to cook, hate to bake, so if you can sort out the desserts, I‚Äôll sort out the dinner, deal?

Only looking for people in the UK, ideally north side of the UK, but happy to travel further down south.",0,1736965273.0,amwfdating,0,0.5,False

1i23xv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinancecanada/comments/1i23xv4/80000_in_debt_cp_or_bankruptcy/,"$80,000 in debt CP or Bankruptcy? ","I‚Äôm so torn on what to do. I‚Äôm 40. 3 kids. I rent, have a car no assets.  I could do CP at $400 a month for 5 yrs ( owing 24,000) or bankruptcy at $250 for 9 months 
What I‚Äôm stuck on is im starting a new job, second job. If I do bankruptcy I have to be careful to not make over $4850 a month. This new job working 3 times a week could make me go over this limit or set me just low this limit if I‚Äôm careful. 
Now if I do CP I can work as much as I want being able to make  $9,000 a month. I could do $1000 a month towards my CP and pay it off in 2 yrs. And I would still have more than enough to live comfortably. 
I don‚Äôt have a lavish lifestyle. I spend 60 on coffee a month.  My groceries are only what we need, I price match, pre plan meals for theweek and I rarely buy meat. I bake most of my children‚Äôs lunch stuff. I would call my home minimalistic. I don‚Äôt have Netflix or any other subscription, just internet at $40 a month. I drive an EV so it‚Äôs $25 for electricity. Basically my bills come to $3,479 a month. 
 I stopped paying my debt years ago. I was in a very abusive relationship with my children‚Äôs father, was not allowed to work or leave the house. He used my cards ran all of them up. Fled the house with my kids one evening when he was out of town and ever looked back. He left the country 1 yr ago. I‚Äôm trying to get my life back and just need all this debt taken care of so I can finally move on. 
Anyone have advice, input on what you would do?

I'm not familiar (at all) with beer so I'm not sure what qualities/tastes to look for. I know I'll be going some cinnamon and spicy notes in the chili so I'm leaning towards chocolate. 

Does anyone have some tips? A favorite? üôèüèΩ

1i23weq,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1i23weq/opinions_on_wedding_favors/,Opinions on Wedding Favors?," Hey Friends, 

Curious what you think my idea for wedding favors as I was planning on doing different ones for the men, women and children in attendance. 

**Women:** 2 Tubes of loose leaf tea (my favorite, so a personal touch) With teabag infusers and cutely decorated (twine bows with sprigs of babies breath) honey straws OR honey lollipops.

**Men:** Small jars (or mini burlap sacks/ resealable bags) of fresh coffee grounds w/ mini wooden spoons,  honey straws/ lollipops

**Nonbinary:** One tube of loose leaf and one tube of coffee, honey straws/lollipops

**Children:** Ring pops and playable mini videogame keychains (tetris, snake etc.)

Do you think this is reasonable? I am worried about doing gendered favors.  but I doubt all the men would be thrilled at little tubes of loose leaf tea. And the vast majority of the people in attendance are very conservative so I don't think they'll find it offensive.

I considered asking ""coffee or tea?"" as an RSVP question on the website to personalize them but I know as a general question most people prefer an iced coffee to an herbal tea. The tea is very personal to me and matches the antique/romantic wedding theme so I'm committed to it and wouldn't want to do away with it because only 4 people voted tea.

What are y'all's thoughts?",0,1736965165.0,weddingplanning,20,0.17,False

Hey everyone! I slept in today (oops), but I still wanted to stick to a cozy, productive routine. Here‚Äôs how I adjusted my day starting from noon:

üåû Late Morning/Afternoon (12:00 PM ‚Äì 1:30 PM)
	‚Ä¢	12:00 PM: Wake up, sip on lemon water, and do a quick self-care routine (brush teeth, wash face, moisturizer).
	‚Ä¢	12:15 PM: Gentle stretch or yoga (5-10 mins) to wake up.
	‚Ä¢	12:30 PM: Brunch: Oatmeal w/ almond butter, banana, chia seeds, & cinnamon + herbal tea or decaf coffee.
	‚Ä¢	1:00 PM: Tidy a small space (desk, bedside table) or create a playlist for the day.

‚ú® Afternoon (1:30 PM ‚Äì 3:00 PM)
	‚Ä¢	1:30 PM: Work on something creative or practical: journaling, drawing, or planning your week.
	‚Ä¢	I use the Pomodoro method: 25 mins work, 5 mins break.
	‚Ä¢	2:30 PM: Movement break: Take a short walk or follow a gentle YouTube workout. I focus on sensory grounding (pay attention to sounds, textures, and surroundings).

üí° Mid-Afternoon (3:00 PM ‚Äì 4:00 PM)
	‚Ä¢	Snack time: Apple slices + sunflower seed butter or nuts/dried fruit.
	‚Ä¢	Dive into a brainy activity:
	‚Ä¢	Learn something new (Duolingo, podcasts, or research).
	‚Ä¢	Organize a to-do list or brainstorm for a project.

üç¥ Early Evening (4:00 PM ‚Äì 5:30 PM)
	‚Ä¢	4:00 PM: Get hands-on: Cook or bake something fun (muffins are my fave!) or tidy up while listening to music.
	‚Ä¢	5:00 PM: Early dinner: Grilled chicken/tofu wrap w/ spinach, avocado, & hummus + steamed broccoli.

üå∏ Evening Recharge (5:30 PM ‚Äì 7:00 PM)
	‚Ä¢	Play with something sensory-friendly (kinetic sand, ASMR, or coloring).
	‚Ä¢	Take 10-15 minutes to rest if needed.

üõÅ Cozy Evening (7:00 PM ‚Äì 8:00 PM)
	‚Ä¢	Warm bath or skincare routine to wind down.
	‚Ä¢	Cozy clothes, dim lighting, and a comfort show or movie.
	‚Ä¢	End the day by journaling: Write 3 good things about today or set plans for tomorrow.

I would consider myself pretty in tune with my emotions and mental state. I have precognizance as well, but it‚Äôs usually pretty straightforward. Anyway here‚Äôs what happened:

My partner came to kiss me goodbye on his way out to work this morning, and I lay back down for another hour or so of sleep as I always do. I can hear him downstairs making his coffee and I start dozing off. I think I‚Äôm asleep at this point but I could‚Äôve been at the in between. My head starts vibrating really hard, like if you imagine the sound of a buzzing bee, or a phone vibrating on a hard surface. That‚Äôs what it felt like. It didn‚Äôt hurt, but it was very overwhelming and has never happened before. I‚Äôm trying to figure out what the heck that sound is and it turns to the sound of rushing water, and now I‚Äôm seeing myself in an ocean. Very calm. And now I‚Äôm underwater. Still calm. At peace truly. Next I hear the sound of wind chimes. They‚Äôre very loud at this point, but again I‚Äôm underwater and the sound of water faded to wind chimes. I look through the water and I just have this sense of the city of Nashville.

I am doing IF for 10 years. Eating food only within 16:00-22:00

Usually I am taking only coffe after waking up without any sugars or so.

Now I am thinking about trying pre-workout suplements instead of coffee(I hate coffee taste). Problem is that one dose (15g) contains 4g of maltodextrin(sugars). 

This will most probably break fasting. 

Is it so big problem? According to data received from supplier one dose of 15g contains 39kcal, from which is 5,55 BCAA and 4g of sugars.
