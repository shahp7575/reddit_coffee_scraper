1l7pk1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1l7pk1t/discarded_and_blocked/,Discarded and blocked,"So, she and I had known each other for a while. Acquaintances for years and then gradually got to know each other after my divorce.

We almost got together like 9 months ago but she said she wasn‚Äôt in a place for a relationship so it didn‚Äôt go anywhere. I respected that and went about life, but then things heated back up around the new year.

We went on dates, trips, talked every day. It was exciting and we had a real connection and magnetism. I felt seen and did what I could to meet her needs. She had a rough life and there is a lot of trauma there, so I didn‚Äôt my best to learn how to meet her where she was at.

Fast forward, she has a critical health event in a couple months ago and it made her re-evaluate everything. Understandably. I was there with her in the hospital the whole time.

Two weeks later she tells me she doesn‚Äôt want a relationship, period. It devastated me. Even though all the signs were there, it felt out of left field.

So for a month I‚Äôve just been spinning. Can‚Äôt stop thinking about her, checking socials, ruminating, what went wrong/what could I have. You know the drill.

This whole time, we have had some interactions. Mostly surface level, but some genuine conversation and what seemed like flirtatiousness. I was confused and it kept re-opening that pain. 

Finally, I asked her for coffee. I wasn‚Äôt even really sure what I expected out of the conversation. Reconciliation, to draw a boundary about these conversations we‚Äôd been having, idk. I just wanted to talk with her, I guess.

She said no, obv. And that she was confused and upset that I would even be asking. She then blocked me on IG/fb.

I get that I violated a boundary: she had asked for space by breaking it off with me, and I didn‚Äôt respect that space. But again, I was confused and hurting and idk‚Ä¶ I just did it.

Am I in the wrong here? Probably some culpability on both sides, I suppose. I feel kind of back at square one with this whole situation and it sucks, but also kind of feel some relief.

1l7pde3,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/1l7pde3/entitled_parent_want_my_art_project/,Entitled Parent Want My Art Project,"Writing this with one hand at 9 pm since I burned my hand when handling hot glue and it got my middle finger and thumb so sory in advance for any spelling errors or confusing words, I also have autism and get jumbly in my words when I'm stressed hyper or tired.

So I (24 nb) work at a gallery for people with physical and mental disabilities to do art and sell said arts, it's fun and I love it and I get along with everyone, and I go about twice a week and focus my other job the rest of the week end.  
Every morning before I go into the gallery I head in the cafe just in the same area and order a coffee maybe a breakfast, sit in a booth and work on something simple wither that's sketching or writing. I have autism so it's good to have a routine like this.

Today started normal, I walked in, ordered my coffee, some pancakes, and got a booth to sit at. In the gallery I'm working in a project with another group from a different program where you have to build your dream home with a cardboard shell. It's a lot more fun than I assumed and with permission I managed to get some mini furniture to put in the house since while I love clay I suck at making a bed with it lol. So I got some items from Amazon and brought it with me in a bag so I can work on it.  
I'm sitting there, writing on my laptop, sipping my latte, and just chilling with the cafe's vibe as people stated to slowly trickle in for the breakfast rush and I was eyeing the time for when the gallery opens.

Then walked the Entitled Parent of the story with a little girl maybe 8 or so. 

I didn't pay much attention to them cause they just looked like a normal mother-daughter duo, they just sat a booth after ordering and I paid them no mind. That was until the little girl pipped up about my brief case's keychain charm which was a little clay Dogday from Poppy Playtime my boyfriend made me recently. I thanked her for the compliment and she was happy chatting with me about how she likes Poppy Playtime. I thought ""bit young for the game but okay"" and didn't say much.  
Then her eyes locked to my bag with the mini furniture.   
The little girl pointed and yelled, ""Look mom, it's a little toaster!"" (There was indeed a little toaster.)  
The mom looked up from her phone and looked to my bag. She then asked me where I got them in which I answered simply Amazon.

The pair's food arrived and we stopped talking for a while. I continued my writing and breakfast minding my own business. After a while EM spoke up again, ""Hey, can you give it to my daughter?""  
Now at first I thought she meant my keychain or pancakes since I did hear the girl say her pancakes weren't chocolate chip so I just said, ""Hm?""  
EM: ""My daughter's birthday's Wednesday and it would be *SOOOOOOOOOOO* nice if you give her a gift.""  
I blinked, confused. I don't know this girl or her mom so why would I give her a gift? Also we're at a cafe so it's a weird place to ask.

Me: ""I'm sorry but I don't know your daughter but happy birthday...""  
EM: ""Oh I know! I'm a single mother and it's been hard to get by and my daughter would REALLY LOVE to have your doll house.""  
Me: ""Again, I'm sorry, but I can't do that. This is for my work but they were really cheap on Amazon.""

EM got huffy and started breathing fast as if she ran a marathon. Then she started to YELL at me, still in a cafe, about how I'm ruining her daughter's birthday and ""How dare you-"" with ""Who would EVER deny a little girl's birthday present"" and just wailing how I'm a heartless monster and how I'm going to Hell.  
Meanwhile the poor girl is sitting there, quiet, staring at her mom confused. A few times she glanced at me with a apologetic look which broke my heart.

The owner walked over and asked what the problem was and EM started to claim that SHE brought the bag of mini furniture in and I took it and is refusing to give it back. The owner, who I know pretty well since I've been coming here for a year now to the point he readily makes my latte when he sees me come in, just stared at EM, then at me, and back at EM and said, ""Ma'am I took her order before you came in, I saw she brought it in with her.""

EM's face turns a weird reddish purple and she slammed some 20s on the table, grabbed her daughter, and hurried off. The owner then asked if I was okay and left after I said I was.

## Key Features Analysis

The best burl coffee tables of 2025 emphasize both aesthetic appeal and structural integrity.

**Burl Wood Selection:** Premium burl coffee tables use high-quality burl wood, often sourced from walnut, maple, or redwood trees. Each burl is carefully selected for its distinctive grain pattern, size, and overall character. The wood is then expertly dried and stabilized to prevent cracking or warping over time. The burl's unique formations, such as swirling patterns, bird's-eye figures, or intricate knots, are preserved to showcase its natural beauty.

**Resin Encapsulation:** many modern burl coffee tables incorporate resin to enhance the beauty and durability of the wood. A clear or tinted epoxy resin is poured over the burl, filling in any voids or imperfections and creating a smooth, glossy surface. the resin encapsulation process not only protects the wood from moisture and scratches but also accentuates the natural textures and colors of the burl. High-quality resins used in this process are UV resistant and non-yellowing, ensuring that the table maintains its appearance for years to come.

**Base Materials and Construction:** the base of a burl coffee table is just as meaningful as the burl itself. Common materials include steel, wood, and acrylic. Steel bases are often powder-coated for durability and can be designed in various styles, from minimalist hairpin legs to more elaborate geometric forms. Wooden bases provide a warmer, more traditional aesthetic and are typically made from hardwoods like oak or walnut to complement the burl.Acrylic bases offer a modern, almost floating appearance, allowing the burl to take center stage. The construction of the base is carefully engineered to ensure stability and weight distribution, especially considering the irregular shape and weight of burl wood.

**Dimensions and Proportions:** A well-designed burl coffee table will have dimensions and proportions that are appropriate for the size and style of the room. Common dimensions range from 36 to 60 inches in length, 24 to 36 inches in width, and 16 to 18 inches in height. The height of the table should be proportional to the height of the surrounding seating,typically a few inches lower than the seat cushions. The shape of the table,weather round,oval,rectangular,or freeform,should also complement the layout of the room and the placement of othre furniture.Key features of the best burl coffee tables include:

* Unique, one-of-a-kind burl wood tops
* Durable resin encapsulation for protection and aesthetic enhancement
* Variety of base materials and styles to match different decors
* Appropriate dimensions and proportions for different room sizes

## Core Benefits

**Elevated Aesthetic Appeal:** A burl coffee table instantly elevates the aesthetic of any living space with its natural beauty and unique character.The swirling grain patterns and organic shapes of the burl wood create a focal point that draws the eye and adds a touch of sophistication to the room. As each burl is unique, the coffee table becomes a conversation piece and a reflection of the owner's individual style.

**Enhanced Durability and Longevity:** The combination of burl wood and resin encapsulation makes these coffee tables highly durable and resistant to wear and tear. the resin protects the wood from scratches, spills, and UV damage, ensuring that the table maintains its beauty for years to come. The sturdy base construction also contributes to the table's longevity, providing stable support for the heavy burl top.

**Versatility in Design and Style:** Burl coffee tables are surprisingly versatile and can complement a wide range of interior design styles. Whether the style is modern, minimalist, rustic, or eclectic, a burl coffee table can be integrated seamlessly into the room's decor.

## FAQs Section

**How do I care for a burl coffee table with a resin finish?**
Cleaning a burl coffee table with a resin finish is simple. Use a soft cloth and a mild, non-abrasive cleaner to wipe the surface regularly. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive pads, as these can scratch or damage the resin. For tougher stains, use a specialized resin cleaner or a mixture of water and vinegar.

**Can a burl coffee table be refinished if it gets damaged?**
While it is possible to refinish the resin portion of a burl coffee table, it requires specialized knowledge and equipment. If the resin gets scratched or damaged, it is best to consult a professional furniture restorer who has experience working with epoxy resins. They can assess the damage and recommend the best course of action, whether it's polishing the surface or reapplying a layer of resin.

**Are burl coffee tables environmentally enduring?**
The environmental sustainability of a burl coffee table depends on the sourcing of the burl wood. look for tables made from burls that are harvested sustainably or salvaged from fallen trees. Some manufacturers also use reclaimed wood or eco-kind resins to further reduce their environmental impact.Inquiring about the source of the burl wood and the manufacturing process can help ensure that the purchase is environmentally responsible.

So, she gave him to us and told my dad to do whatever he wants with him. He came back home with Sam that day and we all really loved him and we want to keep him.
But we don‚Äôt really have a place to keep him, he didn‚Äôt want to sleep in the backyard (we bought him a house but he doesn‚Äôt even wanna enter it). We have an empty apartment upstairs so we‚Äôre keeping him there for now as he liked it more than being in the backyard.
This is our first time of owning a pet, he‚Äôs happy with us and always excited but these days we feel like he‚Äôs not sleeping well (unless we‚Äôre there or when he gets too tired in the middle of the day) (his eyes are kinda red, I concluded it‚Äôs because of lacking sleep, I plan to take him asap to the vet).
Do you think we should keep him? we really love him and he also has gotten really attached to us, I really don‚Äôt know what to do.
He‚Äôs a labradoodle, aged 2.

His life appears, on the surface, to be rather ordinary. He works as an IT technician‚Äîa job that provides stability, but little satisfaction. His personal life has been a series of quiet disappointments.

A year ago, he went through a devastating breakup with his wife. Their marriage had barely lasted a few weeks before she discovered his secret‚Äîhis homosexuality. She tore apart his character, denouncing him to their mutual friends in the church community they had once been a part of. The slander was swift and brutal. Edward found himself cast out‚Äînot just from his marriage, but from the very social network that had once been his anchor.

One of the few constants in Edward‚Äôs life now is his neighbor, Roy, who has quietly become a close friend. Roy lives next door in a house that‚Äôs a stark contrast to Edward's modest home. The house, with its three floors, basement, and‚Äîoddly‚Äîits wine cellar, seems almost out of place in this suburban neighborhood. Roy, tall at 6'4"", often towers over Edward, who stands at 5'9.

Every Saturday and Sunday evening, the two of them find themselves on Roy‚Äôs front porch, drinks in hand. It was a warm afternoon when Edward‚ÄîEddy, as Roy called him‚Äîfound himself in the garden again. Trimming dead stems, watering the soil, and watching as the flowers bloomed every spring.

For a moment, he caught a strange, faint odor. He took in a deep breath, trying to pinpoint the source. At first, he thought it was the compost pile near the fence, but that didn‚Äôt quite explain it. The smell wasn‚Äôt like rotting vegetables; it was heavier, more organic.

He considered Roy‚Äôs house next door. Maybe Roy had been hunting again and had left some animal remains out to decompose? The day wore on, and the mild scent lingered. The windows were dark, and Roy had been quiet all day. There were no signs of movement, no headlights in the driveway, nothing to suggest Roy was home.

Edward‚Äôs feet itched to investigate, but he hesitated. What was he supposed to do? Knock on the door and ask if Roy had left a dead animal out for too long? He took a step toward the fence, and then stopped.

The next day, a Saturday afternoon. The sun hung low in the sky, casting a golden glow over the neighborhood. Roy appeared at the end of the driveway, walking toward Edward‚Äôs. His broad shoulders pulling at the sleeves of his T-shirt. His hair.

‚ÄúEddy!‚Äù Roy‚Äôs voice was warm and boisterous, like they hadn‚Äôt spoken in months, not just a few days. ‚ÄúLook at this! The garden‚Äôs looking fantastic. These roses, man.‚Äù

Edward smiled. ‚ÄúThanks, Roy. It‚Äôs just a lot of patience, I guess.‚Äù He straightened up from his crouch, brushing off his knees as he dusted his hands on his jeans.

Roy‚Äôs grin widened. Roy‚Äôs smile curled into a more knowing, almost self-satisfied grin. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôve got a bottle of 2015 Ch√¢teau Lafite Rothschild down in the cellar. You ever had that?‚Äù

‚Äú2015 Ch√¢teau Lafite Rothschild?‚Äù Edward repeated, trying to keep the tone casual. ‚ÄúThat sounds pretty fancy.‚Äù

Roy‚Äôs eyes lit up. Edward felt a flicker of discomfort. Just a pinch of discomfort.

Edward wasn‚Äôt exactly a wine connoisseur, but even he knew that Ch√¢teau Lafite Rothschild wasn‚Äôt just something anyone could casually open up on a Saturday night.

‚ÄúI mean, sure, sounds great,‚Äù Edward said, trying to sound as casual as possible. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre offering, I‚Äôll take you up on it.‚Äù

Roy clapped him on the back with a little more force than necessary, his eyes lingering for just a moment too long before he stepped back. Edward smiled awkwardly, watching as Roy walked back toward his house.

Eddy looked back down at his garden, the roses now seeming somehow less beautiful, less peaceful, than they had before.

Later that evening, Edward stepped inside, the familiar scent of Roy‚Äôs home‚Äîwood and leather. Edward took the glass, swirling it for a moment before taking a sip. The taste was exquisite.

‚ÄúSo, how‚Äôs work been?‚Äù Roy asked, casually settling into an armchair across from him.

‚ÄúSame as it‚Äôs always been,‚Äù Edward said, smiling softly. Edward added, ‚ÄúI noticed something... Is the plumbing in your house okay? I mean, I‚Äôve been smelling something... a little off? Could be coming from the pipes or something.‚Äù

Roy‚Äôs smile didn‚Äôt falter. He leaned back in his chair, looking almost amused.

‚ÄúRot?‚Äù Roy repeated. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had a bit of moisture in the basement recently‚Äîpipes can get a little musty down there...‚Äù

Edward nodded.

As the night went on, the taste of the wine started to lose its charm, and a faint dizziness crept up his spine. Roy, still watching him, leaned forward, his elbows resting on his knees.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs that wine treating you, Eddy? Feeling good?‚Äù

Edward wiped his forehead with the back of his hand. ‚ÄúRoy... I think I need to‚Äî‚Äù

But before Edward could finish his sentence, the room seemed to sway again.

Roy didn‚Äôt say anything at first. He simply leaned back in his chair, his smile widening just slightly, as though he were savoring something.

‚ÄúTake it easy, Eddy,‚Äù Roy said, his voice low and almost... soothing?

The words echoed in Edward‚Äôs head like a warning, but he couldn‚Äôt focus enough to make sense of them. His limbs felt heavy, his head too light.

Slowly, with the faintest flicker of dread, he realized something was terribly wrong.

Edward tried to push himself to his feet, but his body felt unresponsive. He reached out, fumbling for the edge of the coffee table to steady himself, but it seemed to drift just out of reach.

Machine of consciousness makes everything around have a Reason.,"¬†I want you to have another look on this simple visualisation of a ‚Äúsample goal‚Äù for every observer. This is a simple Fact-result (Fr) statement ‚ÄúI want a coffee and croissant‚Äù. It has some Dramaturgical potential (Dp). First the idea of 1Dp in your head appears and the goal is set. Number 1 here means achievement of the goal. If 0 is no goal at all, then we say 1 is a full achievement of the goal state. All that in between are a numbers and states of not fully emerged story.¬†¬†

https://preview.redd.it/u2wlof4ps06f1.png?width=1666&format=png&auto=webp&s=90b3424ff1392d4974288ab892f760aeebb330f2

Here we pretend the achievement of that goal took only 4 Planck times. To be able to see the graph of achieved goal in general. Idea of having a coffee brake appeared and formed till some exact Planck‚Äôs step of your life led to creation of this Fact-result statement, after witch you decided to do real action. This exact idea made you walk for 4 Planck‚Äôs seconds to the table where you have that croissant and coffee ready for you. Each step you were spatially closer to the goal and nothing disturbed you in the way.

At worse case some cat or spider could jump at you and you brake your ankle. And forget about coffee. Or a meteorite strikes your apartment at that moment. That are highly unlikely to happen events. But still they can happen and can effect your decision making.

In our case person got to their coffee in 4 Planck‚Äôs steps and mission was accomplished. Dramaturgical potential of that idea, that (Fr) event was rising through steps and got full number 1 meaning. And it took only 4 (Re) Reaction steps. Your brain set in front of table, felt a smell of fresh bakery and coffee, and ‚Äútold yourself‚Äù We made it buddy! You got your coffee, drink and let‚Äôs move on! We have a bunch of other goals to fulfil, you set before, and we need to create some more goals.¬†

This fulfilment or dismission of a set Fact-result event is somewhat sacral and fragile as for people. If you set a goal to become a best pilot in the world, you will follow it through some number of (Re) reaction steps of your life till you succeed or till you will be forced or desire by yourself to dismiss this goal as not valid for upcoming moment.

¬† What mind can‚Äôt stand is not fulfilled or denied goals. Recursion style behaviour. Constant (Re) events that loose the primal (Fr) task and repeat itself over and over.

For example you want to breakup with a girl, but you can‚Äôt do it because you are not ‚Äúready‚Äù now. All bad phycological states of human mind mostly come in a shape of that unfulfilled goal of some kind coming again and again into your head. Action running in circles with no conclusion.

https://preview.redd.it/a55csckqs06f1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=340b79ac36994e7c662409fbd5c8a6efffc2fc07

¬† Like if some kid saw a murder when he was small and later couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúlet it go‚Äù and lived through his adult life with despair and ‚Äúcraziness‚Äù of some kid because that story with a dead people, that goal of killing was not fully understood by the brain of a child. He saw murder and got this terrible question in his head: ‚ÄúWhy adult people kill each other with such anger?‚Äù and in other words kid set a goal of finding an answer to this fundamental question.

¬† He grows on but nobody gives him answer that suits him. Nothing seams to logical for him to approve that behaviour. He thinks he didn‚Äôt get a proper answer and if due to bad luck later this guy met more bad aggressive people in life, he will confirm to himself that life works like that, everybody should hate and hurt each other. But he still can‚Äôt find right answer for that first childish fundamental thought: ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù. And this doesn‚Äôt let to close the cycle of fulfilment of that goal, answering why. He sees violence is pointless but it ‚Äúhas to move on‚Äù. This is a mind trap billions of people are in.¬†

Such inflated mind states suck out all time and energy that could be used for enjoying life.

Good idea would be to answer all your inner questions. Many of which need further personal research and effort.

There is no other way to feel really happy except of fulfilling all your goals or letting them go. Leaving some goal in a state ‚ÄúI will decide later‚Äù turns it into a burden that slows you down.

Coming back to the picture of getting the coffee we can imagine there are multiple long-term and short term goals like that. And they all effect each other, and goals of other people effect yours and so on, it is a big pile of probabilities, that are shown as playing cards at each step of the poker game. Players show what they got, then another turn goes, and player have other card combinations with a new perspectives.

So the process of playing poker step by step is a nice visualization of what dramaturgical potential does in this world. It brings rules, why 4 kings are great but 4 aces are better. And more important, the winner gets it all. If you got to your goal this turn, it might be because some one didn‚Äôt.¬†

Seeing the horizontal line of Planck‚Äôs time on the graph you might notice it has a certain Planck‚Äôs step in past when your dramaturgical potential started to effect the system, and It always will have a certain x Planck‚Äôs step in future when you stop to effect the world around you. Like for example when you die.¬†

The idea of showing ‚Äúgoal reaching process‚Äù in a graph if brought by quantum dramaturgical perception.

If the world is quantum dramaturgical in first place, it could be easily described though this Fact-result and Reaction events-quants.

The aggregate message that people unfortunate enough to suffer from misophonia is, ‚ÄúGo kill yourself!‚Äù You people confirmed this. 

I was warned about advocating for my disability, but I truly believed that as an attorney I could make a difference. Not only for myself but for all us. One of the things that kept me going was my ‚Äúheroic‚Äù fantasy about saving the lives of unemancipated minors, such as the ones on Reddit, where children have been announcing their suicides for years. 

Because of my passion and naive faith in the law, I truly believed that reporting those minors‚Äô ominous posts to law enforcement and the City of Pasadena would make a difference. I didn‚Äôt realize that, as Officer Alvarez confirmed, no one cares. On this the City‚Äôs officers and City Attorney are not alone. Apparently, all the places I have written about it‚Äîthe DOJ, AMA, APA, ABA, U.S. Health Department Children‚Äôs Division, Dean Erwin Chemerinsky and the FBI‚Äîhave all confirmed that no one about these specific set of children. 
 
My goal was to open a small crack in the closed door of apathy and disregard for ADA laws as they apply to those of us suffering from misophonia so that I could eventually go after the American Psychiatric Association for failing to include ‚Äúmisophonia‚Äù in the DSM. 

I believed doing so would make a huge difference. Judges might stop scoffingly denying disability to people with misophonia. Drug researchers would recognize the need for a solution. People would stop calling us ‚ÄúKarens‚Äù and appreciate how serious our condition is. Businesses might turning the music down so we don‚Äôt flip and get arrested or trespassed. New laws would be passed to prevent this kind of oversight again. And, perhaps more importantly, people who might be suffering from an even rarer condition, would also not be overlooked. I was deeply touched when I saw a young lady on TikTok with a rare begging pleading for someone to befriend her. 

My goal has proven to be grandiose and unrealistic. 

Since I began advocating for misophonia:
1. my mother had 51/50‚Äôed for arguing with her after I yelled at a neighbor‚Äôs dog to stop barking because each bark felt like I imagine the stabbing knife would have felt to the lady in that famous Hitchcock shower scene‚Äîand it never dulls. 
2. The officers who ran me in under a false outstanding warrant‚Äîthe first time‚Äîpunished me by tightening the handcuffs really hard, Cedar Sinai took away my hearing protection, laughed at me, and I was mocked by staff who kept saying, ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre a real attorney?‚Äù No due process. No lawyer. I get it. 
3. Peet‚Äôs Coffee fabricated a lie to trespass me for requesting ‚Äúreasonable accommodations‚Äù pursuant to the Americans With Disabilities Act and occasionally buying food or drinks for a homeless person (the staff would glare at me), falsely claiming that a customer complained that I had been ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù with them (you will find footage of me doing so) and using cliched ‚ÄúJim Crow‚Äù language like ‚ÄúYou might want to find a place more suitable.‚Äù
4. Pasadena police officers have made it difficult for me to obtain confirmation that the Peet‚Äôs Coffee store manager felt to mention my ADA requests, even though I‚Äôm the person who summoned them, thus preventing from using the manager l‚Äôs obstruction of justice as leverage. 
5. Another set officers ran me in again under the ‚Äúoutstanding warrant‚Äù excuse, after refusing to let me close my bedroom door, tackled me for no reason, left ammunition in my bedroom, and paraded me in front of neighbors like Tupac. 
6. Another officer who I called to assist me reenter my apartment, trespassed me from the entire apartment complex based on my roommate‚Äôs intent to obtain a TRO, denying me the opportunity to grab food, money, medication, or clothing. 
7. The Pasadena judge who granted my mother‚Äôs ex parte application for the TRO, essentially dumped me out on the street without any of the above and I, at age 59, had to learn how to survive without getting shanked or stabbed while sleeping on bus stop benches or breaking the law and sleeping in the back of a U-Haul truck, as recommended by a homeless man I met.
8. I was treated like garbage by Pasadena police, the Starbucks I had spent tons of money at, and others because I looked and smelled like a homeless person. 
9. The Pollo Loco on Rosemead Boulevard trespassed me for wearing my headphones and just like everyone else, even I explained that I was needed them for my disability, they scoffed. Other businesses have been rude to me for wearing my headphones, too. 
10. Many of my neighbors who saw me twice led out of my apartment in handcuffs no longer respect my legal skills. 
11. Everyone seems to have a problem with a problem with me singing while walking around wearing headphones because since I can‚Äôt I seem to keep a job once it becomes apparent that I have misophonia. 

So, the message from you, society at large, including law enforcement, is that I am to shut up about my misophonia and do not advocate for my rights, if I wish to live again in Pasadena. 

I would be lying if I said that I didn‚Äôt begin this fight with selfish motives. Once I learned that the biggest obstacle to bringing awareness to misophonia and getting it published, I began to develop hope. I know in my heart that I can‚Äôt live with misophonia much longer‚Äînot while society remains openly hostile to the very idea with the the help of law enforcement reinforces. No amount of hope, prayer, exercise, mindfulness, or therapy is going to change things. Over the last thirty-plus I have tried it all, including thousands of ‚Äútheories‚Äù in an attempt to hack my misophonia and set myself free. It has only gotten. It‚Äôs crystal clear to me‚Äîeither society cedes or I suffer. Period. I have gone as long as a moth without being exposed to triggers, believed myself ‚Äúhealed‚Äù as long as I don‚Äôt think about it, only to see everything come crashing down as soon as a neighbor moves in with a barking  dog. It‚Äôs that simple to me: remove the triggers and my life begins to soar; introduce a trigger and my life slowly goes to pot. 

So, I fully understand how life on Ted Kazinski‚Äôs his off-the-grid was a ‚Äúparadise‚Äù for seven years until the ATV‚Äôs, diesel generators, lumber mills and overhead encroached and drove him crazy. Then nothing worse than taking all reasonable steps to remove the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù‚Äîoneself‚Äîonly to have society follow and ruin everything. 

I also completely understand how even Dr.  Marresse‚Äôs best friends did not relate her suicide to her suicide. No matter how many times I explain to friends and family that misophonia is the cause of my ‚Äúuncontrollable rage,‚Äù they still seem to think, ‚ÄúYeah, but you‚Äî.‚Äù My own mother who is a stone-cold believer in science is unable to appreciate the clinical definition. It‚Äôs as if she were interpreting it as poetry. I don‚Äôt know what causes people to think this way. 

All I know is that the popular paradigm most subscribe to, wherein doing all the right things tends to yield positive results, is completely inapplicable with respect to misophonia. It simply doesn‚Äôt care. Remove the triggers and my life improves. Introduce the triggers and my life goes downhill. It‚Äôs that simple. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúgetting over it‚Äù or ‚Äúunearthing repressed trauma.‚Äù 

And I‚Äôm tired of arguing people. I‚Äôm tired of leaving a trail of bad blood  everywhere I go. I‚Äôm tired of being blamed for being angry as a result of being tortured. And I‚Äôm tired of my family fearing me.

Everything I worked so hard for over the years was trashed in only a handful of days. I saw a side of human nature that was so ugly, I doubt I will ever recover. The way I‚Äôve been treated and was in turn treated as the result of being rendered homeless at age fifty-nine has changed me forever. I will never be the same. Overnight, went from being regarded as attorney‚Äîa licensed professional‚Äîto being treated like ‚Äúa worthless nigger.‚Äù And I‚Äôm pretty certain that was the effect intended by the judge who granted my roommate‚Äôs TRO without considering any of the relevant factors. I can‚Äôt get over that. My will is broken. You people won. 

My professional reputation has been shattered now that everyone‚Äôs seen me walked out of my apartment in handcuffs like a hoodlum. So, much for my University of Irvine School of Law degree where I studied constitutional under Erwin Chemerinsky. 

My passionate pursuit of bringing awareness to those of us suffering misophonia has all but been extinguished by my experiences in Pasadena and the sobering realization that even the Department of Justice could care less about complying with mandatory reporting laws. Like the seven police officers who I informed about the children on Reddit announcing their suicides, no one cares. At least when it comes to children afflicted with misophonia who are unable to legally leave their homes when their parents force ‚Äúexposure therapy‚Äù on them and their siblings trigger them for laughs. 

Having served this country, obtained my bachelor‚Äôs degree at age forty-four and my Juris Doctorate at fifty with the goal of making a positive impact, reality has hit me really hard. I don‚Äôt know if I have the will to sit before the California bar exam. The respect that I received as a lawyer in Las Vegas, a city I truly hate, has proven meaningless in Pasadena,  where I was  reduced to the status of a homeless ‚Äúnigger‚Äù in the blink of an eye‚Äîby the very people I‚Äôve always turned to enforce the law. 

I plan to concede to those who warned me about advocating for ‚Äúour rights‚Äù that they were right‚Äîit is better to suffer in silence until we can‚Äôt take any more, then check out. 

This is our Holocaust.

1l7oou4,https://i.redd.it/9jmovhmwq06f1.jpeg,"Great Magazine Reads: Christopher Owens makes music worth embracing, for many reasons","Not many people would rank Christopher Owens as the best pop singer and songwriter of the past 15 years. That might be understandable, for one because he has frequently stepped away from the spotlight to handle his own troubled times.

But I can‚Äôt think of any of my standby favorites like Robert Pollard, Stephen Malkmus, or Jeff Tweedy doing it any better between 2010 and 2025. Owens‚Äô two albums and one EP with his band Girls are immaculate Lemonheads-like‚Äîor maybe even early Elvis Costello‚Äîpop-punk classics. His four solo releases since then are almost as great, showing a more mature style of musicianship, as is his one EP as the band Curls.

I just got around to Uncut Magazine‚Äôs profile of Owens from last November and it‚Äôs a good one, detailing everything from surviving ‚Äúa radical Christian cult and drug addiction‚Äù to ‚Äúa series of tragedies, including a motorbike accident, homelessness, and the death of a former bandmate.‚Äù

The latest of the bad times hit in 2016 when he returned from busking in San Francisco to find his camper van stolen. It had all his possessions in it, including his passport, favorite electric guitar, and cat.

Even more of the latest bad times followed in 2017 when he was hit by an SUV on his motorcycle, which led to him losing both his coffee-shop job and his fianc√©e, who broke up with him. In 2020, his Girls bandmate, producer, and ‚Äúbrother Owens never had‚Äù Chet ‚ÄúJR‚Äù White passed away.

Some of the interesting tidbits from the article:

Owens has moved from the West Coast to Washington Heights, at the northern tip of Manhattan.

As a child, his family was based in Florida with the Children of God cult. While he mostly heard worship songs, Owens and the other kids were encouraged to busk and proselytize and once he happened to hear a bit of Fleetwood Mac, which wowed him. When he escaped the cult, he became enamored of the punk scene in Texas. He fell ‚Äúunder the wing of a sixty something artist, oil scion, and eccentric philanthropist named Stanley Marsh 3, bonding over a shared love of classic musicals and then becoming his personal assistant. Owens has always spoken of Marsh with great tenderness, but it is worth noting that late in life, Marsh faced multiple charges of sexual misconduct with teenage boys.‚Äù

After four years in Texas, Owens moved to San Francisco and found cocaine and heroin. Girls references a lot of the drugs and dark sides of Owens‚Äô life. It‚Äôs tough to believe that great band was only together for around two years and broke up because Owens and White‚Äôs ‚Äúfriendship had changed‚Äù and the leader was ‚Äúweary of the ever-shifting lineup of session musicians‚Äù in a band which featured Owens and White as the only two full timers.

His first solo record backed away from White‚Äôs preference for punk. Lysandre is an absolutely brilliant 28 minutes, recorded in the key of A, about a relationship ending. The concert on the tour for that album (which I named my favorite of 2013) was the only time I‚Äôve been to a sit-down show at Washington D.C.‚Äôs 9:30 Club‚Äîand that was surprisingly a very good thing in this case.

He had a side career modeling during the period of his next solo albums, the gospel-and-country-tinged A New Testament and Girls-sounding Chrissybaby Forever, which was my third-favorite release of 2015.

To this day, despite all his setbacks and hardships, Owens just keeps issuing stunning works, include my sixth-favorite album of 2024, I Wanna Run Barefoot Through Your Hair.

If there‚Äôs one artist you probably don‚Äôt know who I would highly recommend, it‚Äôs Christopher Owens. He‚Äôs got just the right mix of weirdness and originality, a fascinating personal background, and absolutely beautiful hooks and melodies following in the long line of Beatles-style rock n‚Äô roll.

I had just moved into a brand new middle school in a tiny southern town away from anyone I knew so I frequently got bullied for it, not to mention my family was relatively low income trying to feed five teenagers and two adults. So I just straight up stopped eating lunch, making me tired, so I also stopped eating breakfast. 

Anyway, I beat that years ago, but have now grown uncomfortable in my body again. I'm 5'1 and 200-220 pounds and I'd love to lose at least 50 pounds in the next year and a half to two years. I know part of it is genetic, my entire family is mostly Irish and holds/gains weight very easily and I also have PCOS which makes losing weight even harder. For some reason when I start working out, I tend to end up putting on MORE weight. So I wanted to start counting calories again on top of working out but I'm terrified if I do that I'm going to fall right back into just not eating

Is there any advice y'all have? Maybe people who have also recovered from eating disorders? I'd also love to hear any work out advice y'all have cause I don't go to a dedicated gym (self esteem/gender dysphoria issues) so I mostly do work outs in my room that I can do without equipment.

I do love most fruits and veggies, but I also eat a ton of carbs. Pasta, bread for sandwiches, and a lot of potatoes. I snack more than I should, but I'm trying real hard to work on that. I also work night shifts so I tend to not eat anything all day because I'm sleeping, eat dinner with the family I live with, and then eat ""lunch"" during my break at 2:00am and then maybe something before I go to bed depending on what I had for my ""lunch""",2,1749525409.0,WeightLossAdvice,5,1.0,False

[[Explore Top Rated cream top milk on Amazon.]](https://site.trendsupplier.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=cream top milk)

## Key Features Analysis

the defining characteristic of cream top milk is the presence of a thick layer of cream floating on the surface. This cream layer, composed primarily of milkfat, naturally separates due to the undisturbed nature of the milk. The following features are essential in evaluating cream top milk brands.**Non-Homogenized:** Homogenization is a process that breaks down fat globules to prevent separation. Cream top milk, by definition, is not homogenized, allowing the cream to rise naturally. This lack of homogenization preserves the size and structure of the fat globules, contributing to a richer flavor and texture.

The absence of homogenization in cream top milk is a key distinguishing factor. This process intentionally leaves the fat globules intact, allowing them to coalesce and form that characteristic creamy layer we all love. The size and integrity of these fat globules is crucial to the finished flavor and texture, so this is a vital indicator of quality.

**Pasteurization Method:** The pasteurization process affects the flavor and nutrient content of the milk. Vat pasteurization, a low-temperature, longer-time method, is often preferred for cream top milk as it retains more of the milk's natural enzymes and flavors compared to ultra-pasteurization (UHT), which involves higher temperatures and shorter times.

Vat pasteurization frequently enough results in a less ""cooked"" taste and preserves more of the beneficial enzymes naturally present in raw milk. This method seeks to balance the need for safety with the desire to retain the natural properties of the milk, offering a more nuanced and appealing flavor profile.

**Source of Milk (Grass-Fed vs. Conventional):** Milk from grass-fed cows is often richer in omega-3 fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) compared to milk from conventionally raised cows. These differences can impact the milk's nutritional profile and flavor. Cream top milk sourced from grass-fed cows may offer a more complex and desirable taste.

Cows grazing on pasture produce milk with a different fatty acid composition than those fed conventional grain-based diets. The nutritional differences, along with the potential for ethical and environmental benefits associated with grass-fed farming practices, often make this a desirable feature for discerning consumers of cream top milk.

**Packaging Material:** Packaging material can affect the milk's flavor and shelf life. Glass bottles are frequently enough preferred over plastic as they are believed to preserve the milk's flavor better and are more environmentally friendly. Some brands may also use cartons with specific coatings to minimize flavor absorption.

The material of the packaging used for cream top milk is an important feature to consider. Some believe glass helps to protect the milk from exposure to external flavors, making it one of the best options. The sustainability of the packaging is another reason consumers might consider this feature important.

**Fat Content:** The fat content of cream top milk can vary slightly between brands and may be influenced by factors such as the breed of cow and the time of year.Higher fat content generally results in a thicker,richer cream layer.

Different levels of fat concentration can significantly influence your cream-top milk experience. Consider if you prefer that extra thick dollop of cream, or something lighter as you are reviewing the options in your local market.

1l7oc7x,https://youtu.be/NIHCKQLZstY,3 Very Scary TRUE Off-Grid Living Animal Encounters Horror Stories,"# ""Flathead Shadows"":

I‚Äôd always wanted to live off the grid, far from the noise of cities, where life felt real. My partner and I saved for years to make it happen, finally settling on a remote patch of Montana, deep in the Flathead National Forest. Our cabin was small, just a one-room wooden structure with a loft for sleeping, tucked among towering pines and a creek that gurgled day and night. We‚Äôd read about grizzly bears, common in these parts, and thought we were ready‚Äîbear spray on our belts, food stored in a metal container, and a guidebook dog-eared from study. But no book could prepare us for the terror that came one night.The first week was everything we‚Äôd dreamed. We hiked narrow trails, spotting deer bounding through meadows and eagles soaring above. One afternoon, we saw a grizzly from a safe distance, lumbering along the creek, its fur golden in the light as it swiped at salmon. My partner grinned, whispering, ‚ÄúThis is why we‚Äôre here.‚Äù I nodded, heart racing with excitement, not fear. We felt alive, part of the wild. But signs started appearing‚Äîdeep scratches on tree trunks, logs flipped over, scat piles too big for anything but a bear. ‚ÄúJust nature,‚Äù my partner said when I pointed them out. ‚ÄúBears don‚Äôt want trouble.‚Äù I tried to believe it, but a knot grew in my stomach.By the sixth night, that knot tightened. We‚Äôd spent the evening by a small fire outside, roasting potatoes and laughing about how quiet life was now. The forest hummed‚Äîcrickets chirping, owls hooting, the creek‚Äôs steady flow. Then, a sharp snap, like a thick branch breaking, echoed from the trees. I froze, my fork halfway to my mouth. ‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù I whispered, my voice barely carrying. My partner‚Äôs smile faded, their eyes darting to the darkness beyond the firelight. ‚ÄúProbably a deer,‚Äù they said, but their tone wasn‚Äôt convincing. Another snap, closer, and my skin prickled.‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go inside,‚Äù I said, standing quickly. We doused the fire with water from the creek, the hiss loud in the sudden silence. Inside the cabin, I locked the door, sliding the bolt with a heavy clunk. My partner checked the windows, making sure the latches were tight. ‚ÄúJust being safe,‚Äù they said, but I saw their hands tremble. We climbed to the loft, the wooden ladder creaking under our weight, and tried to sleep. The cabin felt too small, the walls too thin. Every rustle outside made me flinch, and I kept the bear spray on the floor beside the mattress.Around midnight, a low huffing sound woke me, like air forced through a bellows. My eyes snapped open, heart pounding. My partner was already sitting up, their silhouette tense in the dim light filtering through the window. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù they whispered, voice tight. Before I could answer, a loud thud shook the cabin, the walls groaning like they might splinter. Something heavy was out there, right against our home. Another thud, and the floor vibrated under us. I grabbed my partner‚Äôs arm, my nails digging in. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bear,‚Äù I said, barely able to speak. ‚ÄúIt must‚Äôve smelled something.‚ÄùWe‚Äôd been careful, or so we thought. Food was locked in the bear-proof container outside, fifty yards from the cabin, just like the guidebook said. But earlier, we‚Äôd cooked those potatoes, and I remembered tossing vegetable scraps into a trash bag we hadn‚Äôt secured yet. It was still by the fire pit, a stupid mistake. The bear must‚Äôve caught the scent. Another crash came, this time against the door, and I heard claws scraping wood, slow and deliberate, like it was testing for weakness. My stomach twisted, picturing a grizzly‚Äîmaybe 800 pounds, maybe more‚Äîpawing at our only barrier.‚ÄúWe need to make noise,‚Äù my partner said, their voice shaking but firm. ‚ÄúScare it off.‚Äù I nodded, fumbling for the bear spray with one hand and grabbing a metal pot from the shelf with the other. ‚ÄúHey! Get out of here!‚Äù I yelled, banging the pot with a spoon. The sound was sharp, echoing in the tiny cabin. My partner joined in, shouting, ‚ÄúGo away! Leave!‚Äù and slamming a book against the table. The bear growled, a deep, guttural sound that felt like it rattled my bones. It didn‚Äôt stop. Another slam against the wall, harder, and I heard a crack, like wood splitting.I crawled to the window, my hands shaking so bad I could barely lift the curtain. My partner grabbed our flashlight, the big one we used for night hikes, and shone it outside. The beam caught the bear‚Äôs face‚Äîmassive, with dark eyes glinting and jaws parted, showing teeth longer than my fingers. It was a grizzly, standing on its hind legs, towering over the cabin. Its paws, each the size of a dinner plate, pressed against the door, claw marks already gouging the wood. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs huge,‚Äù I whispered, my voice breaking. My partner kept the light on its face, waving it to startle it. ‚ÄúKeep yelling!‚Äù they said, their voice high with fear.We screamed louder, banging everything we could‚Äîpots, the table, even the walls. ‚ÄúGet out! Go!‚Äù I shouted until my throat burned. The bear dropped to all fours, pacing, its head swinging side to side. It huffed again, a cloud of breath visible in the flashlight‚Äôs beam, then reared up and slammed the door once more. The bolt rattled, and I thought, This is it. It‚Äôs getting in. My mind raced with stories I‚Äôd read‚Äîgrizzlies breaking into cabins, dragging people out. We weren‚Äôt hunters, didn‚Äôt have a gun. Just bear spray and noise, and I wasn‚Äôt sure it was enough.Time stretched, each second heavy with dread. The bear kept pacing, growling, tearing at the ground near the door. I could hear dirt and rocks scattering, its claws ripping through earth. My partner whispered, ‚ÄúWhat if it doesn‚Äôt leave?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt have an answer. I just kept banging the pot, my arms aching, my voice hoarse. Finally, after what felt like forever, the bear let out a frustrated snort, like it was annoyed we weren‚Äôt easier prey. It turned, its massive form lumbering into the trees, branches cracking as it moved away. We kept shouting, kept the light on, afraid it might circle back.We didn‚Äôt sleep. We sat in the loft, clutching the bear spray, listening for any sound. Every rustle made us jump, every creak of the cabin felt like the bear returning. When dawn finally broke, gray light spilling through the windows, we crept downstairs. My hands shook as I unbolted the door, half-expecting the bear to be waiting. Outside, the damage was worse than I‚Äôd imagined. Deep claw marks scarred the door, some so deep they‚Äôd splintered the wood. The trash bag by the fire pit was gone, torn to shreds, with potato peels and scraps scattered across the ground. The bear-proof container was untouched, but nearby, a tree had fresh gouges, like the bear had taken out its frustration there.‚ÄúWe messed up,‚Äù I said, staring at the mess. My partner nodded, their face pale. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt leave anything out again,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúNot even scraps.‚Äù We spent the morning cleaning, hauling debris away, and checking every inch of the cabin. The walls held, but the cracks in the door made my stomach churn. That bear could‚Äôve gotten in if it really wanted to. We were lucky, and we knew it.That night changed everything. We started making noise on hikes, singing or clapping to avoid surprising bears. We carried bear spray everywhere, even to the creek for water. We built a better system for trash, sealing it in airtight bags until we could take it to town. The forest was still beautiful, still our dream, but now we saw its teeth. We‚Äôd come here for freedom, but we learned fear, too‚Äîthe kind that sticks with you, that makes every snap in the dark feel like a threat. We still love this life, but we‚Äôre different now, marked by the night a grizzly tested our door and showed us how small we are in the wild.

  


# ""No Signal, No Mercy"":

I live in a small log cabin tucked deep in the Tennessee mountains, miles from the nearest town, where the only sounds are the wind through the pines and the occasional hoot of an owl. No power lines, no cell signal‚Äîjust me, my books, a woodstove, and a solar panel for a few lights. I chose this off-grid life to leave behind the chaos of the city, to find peace in the rhythm of chopping firewood and hauling water from a nearby spring. But out here, the wilderness has its own pulse, and it‚Äôs not always gentle. I‚Äôd heard warnings from the few neighbors scattered miles away‚Äîbears prowling at dusk, coyotes snatching chickens, even a story about a bear attacking a dog in a carport. ‚ÄúKeep your food locked up tight,‚Äù a grizzled man named Tom told me last spring, his eyes serious as he leaned on his truck. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre smart, and they‚Äôre hungry.‚Äù I nodded, thinking my metal bins and bear spray were enough. I was wrong.It was an October evening, and I was curled up on my creaky armchair by the fire, reading an old paperback. The firelight danced on the log walls, casting long shadows across the room. My cabin‚Äôs small‚Äîjust a living area with a kitchen corner, a bedroom, and a loft for storage. The windows are few, their panes thick, but they let in the sounds of the forest. That night, the usual rustle of leaves was interrupted by a heavy thud against the outside wall, like something big stumbling into the cabin. I froze, my finger holding my place in the book, ears straining. Another thud, closer to the front door, followed by a low, huffing sound‚Äîdeep, rhythmic, alive. My heart kicked up, a dull throb in my chest.‚ÄúProbably a raccoon,‚Äù I whispered to myself, but the words felt hollow. I set the book down, its pages splayed on the armrest, and reached for my flashlight on the side table. My boots scuffed the worn floorboards as I stood, the sound loud in the quiet. I grabbed my bear spray from the hook by the door, its weight reassuring in my hand. I‚Äôd read about a man in Gatlinburg, not far from here, who got mauled by a black bear that broke into his cabin a couple of years back. The story stuck with me‚Äîthe bear had pushed through unlocked doors, tearing into the kitchen. I‚Äôd checked my locks twice that night, but now I wasn‚Äôt so sure they‚Äôd hold.I moved to the window beside the door, my breath fogging the glass. Cupping my hands around my face, I peered into the darkness. The beam of my flashlight cut through the night, catching the glint of pine needles and the rough bark of trees. Nothing moved. Then came a sharp scrape‚Äîclaws raking wood, right at the front door. My stomach lurched. I backed up, gripping the flashlight so tight my knuckles ached. The huffing sound came again, louder, like something pressing its snout against the door, sniffing. I swallowed hard, my mouth dry, and flicked on the porch light. Through the small window in the door, I saw it‚Äîa black bear, massive, its fur matted and dark, its eyes glowing like twin embers in the light. It was pawing at the door, claws leaving deep gouges in the wood.‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I shouted, my voice cracking. I grabbed a metal spoon and a pot from the kitchen, banging them together. ‚ÄúGet out of here!‚Äù The clanging echoed, sharp and desperate, but the bear didn‚Äôt budge. It reared up on its hind legs, its bulk filling the window, and slammed its paws against the door. The frame groaned, dust sifting from the hinges. My heart was racing now, a frantic beat in my ears. I remembered Tom‚Äôs warning over coffee at his place months ago. ‚ÄúBears around here, they‚Äôre bold,‚Äù he‚Äôd said, stirring sugar into his mug. ‚ÄúOne tore my shed apart last fall, looking for dog food. You got bear spray, right?‚Äù I‚Äôd nodded, proud of my precautions. But standing there, watching the door shake, I felt like a fool.I backed toward the kitchen, still banging the pot, hoping the noise would drive it away. Then I saw my mistake‚Äîa trash bag on the counter, tied but not sealed, with scraps from last night‚Äôs dinner. I‚Äôd meant to take it to the bear-proof bin outside but got distracted. The bear‚Äôs nose must‚Äôve caught the scent. Before I could grab the bag, there was a loud crack‚Äîthe door‚Äôs top hinge splintering. The bear‚Äôs head pushed through, its jaws snapping, teeth glinting in the firelight. Its growl was low, vibrating through the floorboards. I screamed, a raw sound that tore from my throat, and sprinted for the bedroom, slamming the door behind me. My hands fumbled with the lock, barely getting it to click. I shoved a wooden chair under the knob, its legs scraping the floor, and backed away, clutching the bear spray.The bear was inside now. I heard its heavy steps, the creak of floorboards under its weight. Furniture scraped‚Äîa table tipping over, the crash of a lamp hitting the ground. Dishes clattered in the kitchen, probably the trash bag being torn apart. The bear‚Äôs breathing was loud, punctuated by low grunts and the occasional roar that made my skin crawl. I crouched by the bed, my back against the wall, the bear spray shaking in my hands. The bedroom door was flimsy compared to the front one, just thin pine with a cheap lock. If it wanted in, it would get in.I tried to steady my breathing, whispering, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre okay, you‚Äôre okay,‚Äù but my voice was trembling. My mind raced to Tom‚Äôs stories, the way he‚Äôd described a bear ripping through his carport like it was paper. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt back down easy,‚Äù he‚Äôd said, his eyes distant. ‚ÄúOnce they smell food, they‚Äôre relentless.‚Äù I cursed myself for that trash bag, for thinking I could let my guard down even for a moment. The bear‚Äôs claws scraped the bedroom door, a slow, deliberate sound, like it was testing the wood. My heart stopped. I stood, legs wobbly, and aimed the bear spray at the door, my finger on the trigger.The first hit came‚Äîa heavy thud that made the door rattle in its frame. I yelled, ‚ÄúGo away! Get out!‚Äù but my voice sounded small against the bear‚Äôs growls. Another hit, harder, and I heard the wood crack. The chair under the knob shifted, its legs skidding an inch. My pulse was a roar in my ears. I thought of the Gatlinburg man, how he‚Äôd hidden in a bedroom, waiting for help that was miles away. I had no phone, no way to call for rescue. It was just me and the bear.The door shook again, the lock bending, splinters falling to the floor. I knew I couldn‚Äôt wait. If it broke through, I‚Äôd have no chance in this tiny room. I took a shaky breath, gripped the bear spray, and made a decision. I yanked the chair away, my hands slick with sweat, and cracked the door just enough to see the bear‚Äôs bulk in the living room, its head buried in the trash. I pressed the trigger, sending a cloud of bear spray toward its face. The bear roared, a sound that shook the walls, and reared back, shaking its head, eyes squeezed shut. It stumbled, knocking over a shelf, books and cans crashing to the floor.I didn‚Äôt think‚ÄîI ran. Past the bear, through the wrecked kitchen, over the broken front door lying in pieces. My boots pounded the dirt as I sprinted to my car, parked a hundred yards down the path. I fumbled with the keys, my hands shaking so bad I dropped them once, glancing back at the cabin. The bear was still inside, thrashing, its roars echoing through the trees. I got the door open, threw myself inside, and locked it, my chest heaving. I gripped the steering wheel, eyes locked on the cabin. Shadows moved in the windows, the bear‚Äôs bulk passing back and forth. Crashes came‚Äîmore furniture, maybe the stove being shoved. I stayed there, bear spray in my lap, too terrified to move, watching until the noises faded hours later.At dawn, I crept back. The cabin was a disaster‚Äîclaw marks scarred the walls, the kitchen table was splintered, the trash bag shredded across the floor. Paw prints smudged the dirt outside, trailing into the woods. I found a neighbor‚Äôs number in my notebook and called Tom from a payphone in town later that day. ‚ÄúIt got in,‚Äù I said, my voice still raw. ‚ÄúBroke the door, tore everything up.‚Äù‚ÄúLord, you‚Äôre lucky to be alive,‚Äù he said, his voice low. ‚ÄúYou use that bear spray?‚Äù‚ÄúYeah, got it right in the face. Think it saved me.‚Äù‚ÄúGet a steel door,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd a bear-proof canister for trash. They come back, you know.‚ÄùI spent weeks rebuilding‚Äînew door, heavier locks, metal shutters on the windows. I bought a bear-proof bin and never left food out again. The bear spray lives on my belt now, even when I‚Äôm inside. The forest‚Äôs quiet feels different, heavier, like it‚Äôs watching me. Every creak of the cabin, every snap of a branch outside, sends my heart racing. I wanted solitude out here, a life on my terms. But the wilderness doesn‚Äôt care about my plans. It has its own rules, and I‚Äôm just a guest.

  


# ""The Grunt in the Pines"":

I‚Äôve been living off-grid in a small cabin in Montana for nearly three years. It‚Äôs a simple life, just me in a one-room place I built myself, tucked deep in the forest. Solar panels on the roof give me enough power for a light and a small fridge. My garden out back grows potatoes, carrots, and beans, and I hunt elk or deer to keep my freezer stocked. The nearest town, a dusty little place with a gas station and a diner, is a three-hour drive down a rutted dirt road. I go maybe once a month for supplies‚Äîflour, salt, coffee. Out here, it‚Äôs quiet, just the hum of the forest, the chatter of squirrels, the distant howl of a wolf at night. I love the solitude, but I‚Äôm not naive. The woods are wild. Bears, cougars, moose‚Äîthey‚Äôre all out there. I‚Äôve seen their tracks in the mud, claw marks on trees, scat near the creek. I always carry a rifle when I hike, and my hunting knife‚Äôs never far from my hand.This morning, I decided to track an elk. My freezer was running low, and I‚Äôd spotted fresh hoofprints near the creek a few days back. I woke early, the cabin still dark, and brewed coffee on my woodstove. The smell filled the room as I checked my gear: a compound bow, a quiver of arrows, my knife in its leather sheath, and a small pack with water and a first-aid kit. I pulled on my boots, the leather creased from years of use, and stepped outside. The forest was alive with sound‚Äîbirds flitting in the pines, the soft gurgle of the creek a half-mile off. I slung my bow over my shoulder and started walking, my breath visible in the cool air.The elk trail was easy to follow. Hoofprints pressed deep into the soft earth near the creek, and broken twigs showed where it had pushed through the brush. I moved slowly, my boots sinking into the damp ground, careful not to snap branches. The forest smelled of pine and moss, and I felt that familiar thrill of the hunt, my heart beating steady but quick. I‚Äôd tracked elk before, bagged a few, but every hunt felt new, like a dance with the wild. I kept my eyes on the ground, scanning for fresh signs‚Äîscuffed dirt, a tuft of fur caught on a thorn.About a mile and a half from the cabin, the trail got fresher. The hoofprints were sharp, the edges not yet softened by time. I crouched low, my fingers brushing the dirt. The elk was close, maybe just through the next stand of trees. I notched an arrow, my hands steady, and crept forward. The forest was quieter now, the birds gone silent. My skin prickled, a warning I couldn‚Äôt place. I stopped, listening, my bow half-drawn. The creek bubbled faintly, but there was something else‚Äîa low, rumbling grunt, deep and guttural, coming from the thick brush ahead.My stomach dropped. That wasn‚Äôt an elk. I eased my bow down, my pulse hammering in my ears. I scanned the trees, looking for movement, my hand inching toward the knife on my belt. The forest felt alive, watching me. I took a slow step back, my boot landing on a twig. The snap echoed like a firecracker. Before I could react, the brush exploded. A grizzly bear, massive, its dark fur matted with dirt, charged toward me with a roar that rattled my chest. Its eyes were wild, black and unblinking, its teeth bared in a snarl. It was bigger than any bear I‚Äôd ever seen, easily eight feet tall, its paws the size of dinner plates.I froze, my mind screaming to run, but I knew running was death. Bears are fast, faster than any man. My bow was useless at this range, but I raised it anyway, instinct taking over. The bear was on me in seconds, closing the gap like a freight train. It swatted my bow aside with one paw, the force knocking me to the ground. I hit the dirt hard, pain exploding in my ribs, my breath knocked out of me. The bear loomed over me, its weight pinning me down, its hot breath blasting my face. The smell was overwhelming‚Äîrotting meat and wet fur. Its jaws snapped inches from my nose, saliva dripping onto my cheek, warm and slick.I thrashed, trying to twist free, but it was like pushing against a boulder. The bear‚Äôs claws raked my shoulder, tearing through my jacket and into skin. Pain seared through me, and I felt warm blood soak my shirt. My right hand fumbled for my knife, but it was trapped under the bear‚Äôs bulk. Panic clawed at my chest, my vision blurring. I was going to die here, torn apart in the dirt. Then, out of nowhere, I remembered something my grandma told me when I was a kid, a crazy story about surviving a bear attack. She‚Äôd said, ‚ÄúIf a bear‚Äôs got you, shove your arm down its throat. It‚Äôll gag and back off.‚Äù It sounded like a tall tale, but I had nothing else.The bear‚Äôs teeth grazed my neck, and I acted on pure desperation. With my left arm, I reached up and jammed my hand into its mouth, pushing past its teeth, feeling the wet heat of its tongue. The bear‚Äôs jaws clamped down, crushing my arm, bones grinding under the pressure. Pain shot through me, white-hot, but I kept pushing, my fingers reaching deeper into its throat. The bear gagged, a deep, choking sound, its body jerking back. Its grip loosened, and I shoved harder, my arm slick with blood and saliva. For a moment, it froze, its eyes wide with confusion, then it stumbled back, coughing and shaking its head.I rolled away, gasping, my arm hanging limp, blood pouring from the wounds. The bear snorted, pawing the ground, its massive head swinging side to side. I scrambled to my bow, my hands shaking so bad I could barely grip it. The bear stared at me, its chest heaving, then turned and crashed through the brush, the sound fading into the trees.I stood there, my legs like water, my breath coming in gasps. My arm was a mess‚Äîtorn flesh, blood dripping onto the dirt, the bones aching deep inside. My shoulder burned where its claws had dug in, and my ribs throbbed with every breath. I grabbed my knife, the blade shaking in my hand, and backed away, my eyes glued to the trees. The forest was silent again, but it felt wrong, like the bear was still there, watching, waiting. The hike back to the cabin took hours. Every rustle in the bushes made me spin, my knife raised, my heart pounding. My arm bled through my sleeve, leaving a trail of red dots on the dirt. I kept imagining the bear smelling it, tracking me, its heavy steps just out of sight. My ribs ached, and my head spun from pain and fear. The forest, which I‚Äôd loved for its peace, now felt like a maze of threats. Every shadow seemed to move, every sound a predator‚Äôs growl. I reached my cabin just as my legs started to give out. I bolted the door and collapsed against it, my chest heaving.Inside, I lit a lantern, the flame casting long shadows on the wooden walls. I stumbled to the sink, pouring water over my arm, wincing as it washed away blood and dirt. The wounds were deep‚Äîteeth marks punctured muscle, claw gashes oozing red. I dug out my first-aid kit, my fingers clumsy, and tried stitching the worst of it with a fishing line and thread, biting a rag to keep from yelling out. My ribs were bruised, maybe cracked, but I couldn‚Äôt do much for them. I wrapped my arm in strips of an old shirt, the fabric turning pink almost immediately. I kept my rifle by the door, my eyes darting to the windows every few minutes. The cabin felt like a cage, and the forest outside its walls, a hunter‚Äôs lair.That night, I didn‚Äôt sleep. Every creak of the cabin, every snap of a branch outside, made me bolt upright, my hands grabbing the rifle. I imagined the bear circling my cabin, its snout pressed against the door, sniffing for me. I sat by the window, staring into the dark, my heart racing at every shadow. The pain in my arm kept me awake, a dull throb that pulsed with my heartbeat. I thought about the bear‚Äôs eyes, the way it had looked at me, like I was nothing but meat. I wondered if it was still out there, waiting for me to step outside.For three days, I stayed inside, rationing my food, too scared to leave. My arm swelled, the stitches pulling tight, and I burned with fever, sweat soaking my clothes. I kept the fire going in the woodstove, the crackle of burning logs the only sound besides my own breathing. I talked to myself to stay calm, muttering things like, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre okay, just stay put. It‚Äôs gone.‚Äù But I didn‚Äôt believe it. At night, I‚Äôd hear noises‚Äîscratches, thumps, the rustle of leaves‚Äîand I‚Äôd grip my rifle, my hands slick with sweat, ready for the door to burst open.On the fourth day, my friend Tom showed up. He‚Äôd promised to bring supplies‚Äîcanned goods, batteries, a new axe head. His truck rumbled up the path, and I nearly wept with relief when I heard it. I opened the door as he climbed out, his face going pale when he saw me. I must‚Äôve looked like death warmed over‚Äîpale, unshaven, my arm bandaged and my clothes stained with blood and sweat.‚ÄúGood Lord,‚Äù Tom said, dropping a box of canned beans on the porch. ‚ÄúWhat the heck happened to you?‚ÄùI leaned against the doorframe, my voice hoarse. ‚ÄúGrizzly bear. Got me while I was hunting. It came out of nowhere, Tom. Knocked me flat, bit my arm. I‚Ä¶ I shoved my hand down its throat to get it off.‚ÄùTom‚Äôs mouth fell open, his eyes wide as saucers. ‚ÄúYou did what now? Shoved your arm in its mouth? That‚Äôs the craziest thing I‚Äôve ever heard! You‚Äôre lucky it didn‚Äôt rip you to pieces.‚Äù‚ÄúI thought it would,‚Äù I said, my throat tightening. ‚ÄúI felt its teeth, Tom, crunching my bones. I keep hearing that roar in my head. Every night, I think it‚Äôs out there, waiting for me.‚ÄùHe stepped inside, looking at the rifle by the door, the bloodied rag on the table. ‚ÄúMan, you‚Äôre a tough son of a gun, but you‚Äôre in bad shape. That arm needs a doctor. You got a fever?‚ÄùI nodded, wiping sweat from my brow. ‚ÄúYeah. Been burning up since it happened. I‚Äôm scared to leave, though. What if it‚Äôs still around, smelling the blood?‚ÄùTom shook his head, his voice firm but kind. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not staying here like this. We‚Äôre getting you to town. You need stitches, antibiotics, maybe an X-ray for those ribs you‚Äôre favoring. I‚Äôll drive you.‚ÄùI hesitated, glancing out at the trees, their branches swaying like they were hiding something. ‚ÄúWhat if it follows us?‚Äù‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt,‚Äù Tom said, clapping a hand on my good shoulder. ‚ÄúBears don‚Äôt hold grudges like that. You fought it off, man. You won. Now let‚Äôs get you fixed up.‚ÄùHe helped me pack a bag‚Äîjust a few clothes, my wallet, my knife. I kept the rifle in my lap as we climbed into his truck, my eyes locked on the forest as we drove away. The cabin grew smaller behind us, swallowed by the trees. I kept checking the side mirror, half-expecting to see the bear lumbering after us, its jaws open, eyes fixed on me.The drive to town was quiet, Tom sensing I didn‚Äôt want to talk much. My arm throbbed, my ribs ached, and my mind wouldn‚Äôt stop replaying the attack‚Äîthe bear‚Äôs weight, the feel of its throat under my fingers, the moment I thought I‚Äôd kill me. Even now, months later, after stitches and medicine and Tom telling everyone in town I‚Äôm some kind of hero, I can‚Äôt shake it. I‚Äôm back to my cabin now, but it‚Äôs not the same. The forest doesn‚Äôt feel like home anymore. Every time I step outside, I hear that grunt, see those eyes in the shadows. I keep my rifle loaded, my door locked, and I wonder if the bear‚Äôs still out there, somewhere in the wild man who fought back.",1,1749524870.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

Start of December, he broke up with me. I was absolutely crushed and felt so disregarded. He claimed he had to ‚Äúfocus on his future‚Äù and he had no time for a relationship. He was supposed to meet my family for Christmas, and spend New Year‚Äôs Eve with me. I could not eat or sleep during that time, while he went off to the states for Christmas. It was some of the worst pain I‚Äôve ever felt in my life. I felt like I was going crazy. I‚Äôve never been so heartbroken over somebody like that in my life. 

Come January of this year, he‚Äôs back in town. We end up having to see each other for reasons I won‚Äôt say, and it felt terrible. It felt like I was some gross disgusting thing in his eyes. A week after this encounter, I initiated a meet by asking to get coffee. Which then turned into an entire month of us sleeping together and going on dates and acting like a couple again, until he asked me to be his girlfriend again. For a period of time, it just felt like the honeymoon phase again. Eventually we had to talk about the breakup because it was still hurting me that all of that stuff happened. We fought about it a bit, he apologized, tried to take accountability, and in the end of that I didn‚Äôt even end up feeling better about anything. It felt like every time I talked about how specific things he did hurt me, he would turn it around on me. 

The past few days, I‚Äôve been feeling a lot of anxiety about it. Like how he did all of that to me but still said he loved me the entire time. Currently, he tells me he loves me and will fight for me until the end of time. He says during the time we broke up he was overwhelmed and drinking/smoking everyday and he was going through a hard time but was not sharing any of that with me at the time. He says he regrets it. He told me his friends and sister told him not to talk to me during that time to make things easier. He keeps apologizing endlessly and saying I didn‚Äôt deserve what he did to me but I‚Äôm not really sure I can get over it so I don‚Äôt know what to do. I keep thinking about how much he hurt me and how unfair it was for me to go through all of that. I have no idea what to do. ",1,1749524740.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1l7oape,https://i.redd.it/r135k8g8n06f1.png,The Little Bastard | This is the most haunted car in Hollywood,"# The car

In September, 1955, James Dean was just finishing production on the film ‚ÄòGiant‚Äô; he spontaneously traded in his Porsche 356 Super Speedster for a very stylish Porsche 550 Spyder. Dean was an avid car enthusiast and, given the fact that he was a Hollywood superstar, he had the means to enjoy all of the vehicles that the 1950s had to offer. The 550 was created with an air cooled flat-4 engine and was dominant in several racing classes in its time. James bought the car, which was one of only ninety produced, and swiftly took it to add his own personal flourishes.

On the 23rd of September, Dean enlisted the help of legendary automotive customizer and builder of famed film vehicles George Barris to help him fulfil his vision for the car. He added tartan seats and the number ‚Äò130‚Äô painted in non-permanent paint on the front bonnet, doors and rear decklid. The actor also had customizer Dean Jeffries write the car‚Äôs name of ‚ÄúLittle Bastard‚Äù just under the Porsche badging.

# The beginning of the curse

This is where the story begins to make your hairs stand on end. Later that day, Dean journeyed to meet his friend and fellow performer, the deeply superstitious Alec Guinness. Eerily, the actor‚Äôs private diaries later revealed that when he was exposed to Dean‚Äôs new car, he thought it was ‚Äòsinister‚Äô and he urged James with an ominous premonition ‚ÄúPlease never get in it.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ‚Äâif you get in that car you will be found dead in it by this time next week.‚Äù Dean laughed it off, thinking nothing of it.

As if on cue, a week later Dean was with Porsche mechanic and former Luftwaffe pilot Rolf W√ºtherich who was preparing the 550 Spyder to go racing. They planned to trailer the car to Salinas for a race behind a Ford Country Squire with his friend and colleague Bill Hickman, who worked as a photographer and stuntman, at the wheel. However, Dean thought it better to drive the car there as he wanted to familiarise himself with his new Porsche and it would be prudent to run-in the engine and add miles before racing it.

Fatefully, Dean and W√ºtherich began their voyage to the track on the 30th of September, 1955. After a brief coffee break, they began their journey from Competition Motors at around 1:15pm. By 3:30pm, both the Porsche and the accompanying Ford had racked up a speeding ticket just outside Bakersfield; Dean was a roughish, wealthy and petrol-enthused actor so it was only fair to assume that he travelled with some haste in his new German sports car. Undeterred by the ticket, he journeyed on towards his destination. They would stop for drinks with fellow competitors Lance Reventlow and Bruce Kessler and as the afternoon drew to a close, fate grew closer. The sun dipped below the mountains as a black and white Ford Tudor turned left onto Route 41. Its driver, Donald Turnupseed, was unaware of the open-top Porsche which was rapidly hurtling towards him.

Dean‚Äôs al fresco motoring experience met an abrupt end at around 5:45pm when he met the Ford head-on as the cumbersome vehicle crossed through the middle of the road after making his left turn. The actor was travelling at a considerable rate (approximately 85mph) and the collision between the two cars was disagreeable to say the least. W√ºtherich was thrown from the passenger seat of the vehicle whilst the Ford and its occupant was propelled 12 metres backwards.

The Spyder left the road after several somersaults and ended up in a gully nearby, Dean was trapped in the mangled cockpit ‚Äì his foot was crushed under the clutch pedal. He was cut out of what was left of the 550 and taken to hospital, slowly dying from his injuries. Dean was soon pronounced dead on arrival to the hospital and his passenger was taken into surgery with severe injuries. Remarkably Donald Turnupseed had escaped with a simple scratch on his nose.

# The rampage of an automobile

From then on, the crumpled Porsche would go on to harm several individuals in some of the most unusual and suspicious ways. Shortly after the accident, the ruined 550 chassis was declared a total loss by the insurance company. However, the car was still sold to George Barris ‚Äì the man who customised it after Dean‚Äôs original acquisition of the vehicle ‚Äì who then stripped it of all useful parts and pledged to restore the car. When it was found to be beyond repair, he planned to tour the now famous vehicle and charge people to see it.

The parts he had taken from the car were its working engine and drivetrain which he sold to two doctors, who raced recreationally, by the name of William Eschrid and Troy McHenry. Eschrid took the engine and installed it in his Lotus IX race car whilst McHenry would take the transmission and suspension.

Spookily, Eschrid would be racing his Lotus at Pomona raceway when his car locked up and rolled over for no apparent reason. He would be seriously injured in the incident. His associate, McHenry, was much more unlucky as he would be killed instantly in the very same race when his car slammed into a tree.

The gloomy tale only continued to unfold as two tires which lay untouched in Barris‚Äôs garage since Dean‚Äôs death would eventually be sold for road use. Simultaneously, they would both explode one day and sent the car they were fitted to careering off the road. Disturbed by the vehicle‚Äôs evident ill-intent, Barris decided to cancel his exhibition of the vehicle and hide it away.

# Dean and W√ºtherich before their fateful voyage

# Repercussions of the crash

The series of events following James Dean‚Äôs horrific crash is legitimately alarming and is the main basis for why people believe the ‚ÄúLittle Bastard‚Äú is cursed. Though, a lesser known repercussion of the accident which people tend to overlook is the fate of those involved. Yes, Dean was killed gruesomely, but what of his compatriots?

The final victim in this dastardly narrative is Rolf W√ºtherich ‚Äì Dean‚Äôs mechanic and friend ‚Äì who underwent severe physical and psychological toils resulting from the incident. He would cheat death in 1955, though would still be burdened with a double fractured jaw and serious hip and femur injuries. His left hip was so badly torn that it would only be fixed after six months of further surgery.

However, the biggest effect that the crash had on W√ºtherich would be on his mind. Some of Dean‚Äôs fans blamed him for their idol‚Äôs death and would send abusive and threatening letters. This deeply affected him psychologically and he would develop severe depression and suicidal tendencies. Subsequently, alcoholism ensued and he spiralled down to his demise.

# Dean‚Äôs car on display by the CHP

He was later convinced by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) to lend them the car to tour it around and raise awareness of road safety. The daunting carcass was toured in several cities from 1957-1959 with some rather horrifying results. On its first outing in Fresno, the ‚ÄúLittle Bastard‚Äù spontaneously combusted in storage and the building burned to the ground; unnervingly, the Porsche sustained virtually no damage aside from some scorched paint and exploded tires. In Sacramento, it fell from its display and broke the hip of a nearby student.

From then on, the CHP was equally as concerned as Barris and on a journey from Los Angeles to Miami, the wreckage disappeared from a sealed boxcar. This is according to Barris (a notable showman) who claimed to have discovered an empty carriage when it arrived at the station; he stated that the seal securing the boxcar was intact and the car simply vanished without a trace, but this is unconfirmed. Today, Barris and all other parties involved with the infamous vehicle are gone and the car hasn‚Äôt been seen since it‚Äôs departure in 1960.

¬†

# W√ºtherich navigating a Porsche 904 at the Monte Carlo Rally

¬†

After the incident, he would return to West Germany and work as a freelance tester for Porsche vehicles. He would attend the 12 Hours of Sebring and act as a navigator in several rallies with Porsche until 1968 when he was relieved of his post. In 1979 he joined a local Honda dealership.

His personal life was unfavourable to put it kindly. He was married four times and would have a young son with his third wife. The shadow of James Dean‚Äôs death loomed wherever he went and he divorced his second wife due to a dispute regarding the incident where she apportioned blame to him.

The reason for his termination at Porsche was because he stabbed his fourth wife in her sleep after an attempted suicide. In 1968 he was sentenced to a mental institution for rehabilitation; most of his trauma stemmed from the crash which had happened almost fifteen years ago.

Poignantly, he would die in a car crash on the 22nd of July, 1981, when an intoxicated W√ºtherich crashed his Honda Civic into the wall of a residency. He, like Dean, had to be extricated from the vehicle wreckage and would die at the scene. Rolf had recently been offered a contract to feature in a documentary about James Dean‚Äôs demise which may have attributed to his state at the time. He was only 53 years old and the crash which killed James Dean can indirectly be linked to his own fate.

Hey there! Hope all you lovely folk are doing well today. Call me Tacky if you'd like. I hope you enjoyed that little snippet I worked on. If you couldn‚Äôt tell from the intro, I‚Äôm in the mood for something post-apocalyptic today. As someone who‚Äôs a big fan of stuff like The Walking Dead (especially Telltale‚Äôs series), The Last of Us, etc. a story like this has been on my bucket list for ages. I thought I‚Äôd give it a shot and write my own apocalyptic story. But instead of a zombie virus of a nuclear fallout, I decided to go for a ‚Äúquiet‚Äù apocalypse, like The Long Dark. I thought it wouldn't hurt to see if anyone else was interested in something like this. I left the prompt vague and open ended because I like to give my partner the freedom to make their character however they‚Äôd like. I think if you‚Äôre a fan of the apocalypse genre or just have fantasies about being a badass survivor, this should be up your alley, haha.¬†



Before I finally close this post out, I thought it was important to share some info and establish a couple boundaries if you will:¬†

* The history and lore behind what started the apocalypse isn‚Äôt set in stone at all. We can totally hash out the intricacies together.¬†¬†
* This story will definitely involve me playing a bunch of characters. Whether that be friends, enemies, or even love interests (if you‚Äôre interested in including romance at some point). My partner doesn‚Äôt have to play multiple characters if they don‚Äôt want to, I just wanted to let it be known.¬†¬†



* My timezone is EST, if anyone‚Äôs curious. I don‚Äôt mind my partner‚Äôs time zone at all, but I know it‚Äôs an important factor especially when it comes to availability so I wanted to put it here.¬†



* My schedule is pretty shaky so I can get pretty busy throughout the week. If I go a while without messaging you, just give me a little bump to remind me. We all have lives so I understand that my partner can get busy too, I'm in no rush at all.¬†



* I have no set post length; I feel like how much I write definitely depends on the current scene and what‚Äôs going on. Regardless, I like to keep things as descriptive as I can just so it doesn‚Äôt feel stale.¬†



* I‚Äôm big on OOC chat. There‚Äôs nothing I love more than to chat with my partner and nerd out about the story and the characters with them. I‚Äôve already got plenty of ideas for characters and different scenes in my head, but nothing is set in stone just yet of course. I don‚Äôt mind bouncing ideas around at all. :)



That should be about it. If you‚Äôre interested, go ahead and shoot me a message in chat. Introduce yourself, let me know what you thought and any initial ideas you might have. We can hash out the story and talk characters together. Take care! :)",1,1749524710.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

He was proud of his work and while showing A around (mind you it‚Äôs a small 3bed 1 bath block house with thin walls) they were talking and laughing while in the hall and woke me up a couple hours before my alarm. This gave me a mild migraine and made me a little irritated as I didn‚Äôt go into work for a few hours and couldn‚Äôt get back to sleep after about 45 min. 

I usually don‚Äôt let this stuff bother me but it was a hard night thr night before between the insomnia and sleep apnea keeping me from getting good sleep as I didn‚Äôt fall asleep till after 4am and had to be up by 11am so I could clean my uniform and eat as I had to close. 
I trudged out to the living room and the two of them sat in the kitchen talking. My roommate greeted me and I grumpily after a long pause greeted them back.

This is sort of a long story but I‚Äôll do my best to condense everything to keep the post from getting way too lengthy. 

So back in February I (F) made a new friend, and we became like best friends immediately, and I mean *immediately*. We met through a locals-only social media group dedicated to making strictly platonic friendships - he (M) made a post introducing himself and I commented just simply saying ‚Äúhey it sounds like we have a tonne of shared interests, reach out if you‚Äôd like to chat‚Äù, and he did, and we ended up literally spending the entire day texting with each other, and it hasn‚Äôt really stopped since. We met up in person soon after that and it was pretty much the same - it was supposed to be like an hour-long coffee meetup but we ended up sitting there talking and laughing for like 5 hours. I swear this guy is my doppleganger or something, it‚Äôs weird how much we have in common and how well we get along. Anyway, that‚Äôs all well and good, but eventually he ended up floating the idea of us dating. I had previously told him that I‚Äôve never really been interested in dating so I have no experience with it and never really cared to, but knowing that he still brought it up anyway. We ended up deciding that it just felt way too fast and that we should just stay friends to get to know each other better, spend more time hanging out together, and whatnot. After that he didn‚Äôt bring it up again and I thought everything was fine, but over the last couple of days he‚Äôs been sort of talking to me the way he was before, a bit more flirty I guess? Not much, but it feels notably different.

The other issue here is that he‚Äôs told me that I‚Äôm his only real friend. He‚Äôs been sort of going through a tough time in his life and prior to meeting me had been trying to make some new friends and get back on his feet, but he told me that I‚Äôm the only friend he actively talks to. I want to stress that he‚Äôs always very respectful of the fact that I have an active social life, he gives me lots of space and uninterrupted time with my work and other friends and never tried to guilt or pressure me for not spending time with him instead of them - zero toxicity there. As far as I‚Äôm concerned he‚Äôs a very good friend to me and I care about him a lot, but am I wrong for thinking that he‚Äôs just sort of attached to me? I‚Äôm not trying to be dismissive but he hasn‚Äôt really told me how he actually feels. When he brought up about dating before he told me that he was totally fine with not dating too and he‚Äôd be happy to stay friends, so I just thought it was more sort of a casual ‚Äúhey why don‚Äôt we give this a try‚Äù kind of thing. I just don‚Äôt really know what to do with this situation. I keep encouraging him to go out and keep trying to make other friends and whatnot, and I think he is but‚Ä¶ this entire situation is so far over my head. I care about him very much and I don‚Äôt want to hurt him, and I think I accidentally did today. It‚Äôs my birthday and we were chatting this evening (like every evening really), and I jokingly said something and he just sort of seemed to disengage from the conversation after I said it. I just don‚Äôt know what to do or how to handle this situation - the hardest part is that he‚Äôs genuinely really sweet and I think we probably have really strong compatibility, but I just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt date. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. Any opinions or advice are more than welcome. ",2,1749524543.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

Over the course of the night, I took two hot showers and laid in hot water to calm the restless body.

## Key Features Analysis

The best dough bowl candles of 2025 showcase a blend of craftsmanship, fragrance expertise, and attention to detail. These features contribute to their overall appeal and performance.

**Bowl Material and Construction:** The dough bowl itself is a crucial element. High-quality candles utilize durable materials like reclaimed wood or carefully crafted reproductions. The bowl should be sturdy, well-sealed to prevent wax leakage, and aesthetically pleasing. Look for bowls with unique grain patterns, natural imperfections, and a smooth finish that enhances the overall rustic charm.

**Wax Blend and Scent Throw:** The type of wax used significantly impacts the candle's burn quality and scent throw. Soy wax, beeswax, and coconut wax blends are popular choices due to their clean burning properties and ability to hold fragrance effectively. The scent throw refers to the candle's ability to fill a room with its fragrance. A strong scent throw is desirable for larger spaces, while a more subtle fragrance is ideal for smaller rooms.

**Wick Type and Placement:** The wick plays a vital role in the candle's performance. Cotton wicks are commonly used, but wooden wicks are gaining popularity for their crackling sound and even burn. The number and placement of wicks are crucial for ensuring consistent wax melting and preventing tunneling. Multiple wicks are often used in larger dough bowl candles to distribute heat evenly across the surface.

**Fragrance Profile and Ingredients:** The fragrance is a key factor in selecting a dough bowl candle. Opt for candles with high-quality fragrance oils or essential oil blends that are free from harmful chemicals. Consider the fragrance profile, whether it's a warm and comforting scent, a fresh and invigorating aroma, or a more complex and layered fragrance. Look for candles that clearly list their fragrance ingredients.

**Burn Time and Candle Care:** The burn time indicates how long the candle will last with proper care. Factors such as wax type, wick size, and fragrance load influence burn time. Proper candle care, including trimming the wicks before each use and avoiding drafts, can extend the candle's lifespan and prevent soot buildup.

Key features of the best dough bowl candles include:

*   High-quality dough bowl construction
*   Premium wax blends for clean burning
*   Optimal wick placement for even melting
*   Sophisticated fragrance profiles
*   Extended burn time with proper care

## FAQs Section

**How long does a dough bowl candle typically burn?**
    The burn time of a dough bowl candle varies depending on the size of the bowl, the type of wax used, and the number of wicks. Generally, a well-made dough bowl candle can burn for 50 to 100 hours. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for optimal burn time and safety.

**How do I properly care for my dough bowl candle?**
    To maximize the lifespan and performance of your dough bowl candle, trim the wicks to about ¬º inch before each use. This prevents soot buildup and ensures a clean, even burn. Avoid burning the candle for more than 3-4 hours at a time to prevent overheating and potential damage to the bowl. Keep the candle away from drafts and flammable materials.

**Can I reuse the dough bowl after the candle is finished?**
    Yes, you can reuse the dough bowl after the candle is finished. Carefully remove any remaining wax and wick debris. You can melt the remaining wax using a double boiler or a low oven setting and then pour it out. Once the bowl is clean, you can use it as a decorative piece, a serving dish (if food-safe), or a planter.

**Are dough bowl candles safe to burn?**
    When used properly, dough bowl candles are generally safe to burn. However, it's essential to follow safety precautions. Never leave a burning candle unattended. Keep it away from children and pets. Place the candle on a stable, heat-resistant surface. Avoid burning the candle near flammable materials.

1l7o5r1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HollandAmerica/comments/1l7o5r1/just_returned_from_alaska_cruisenotes/,Just returned from Alaska Cruise...notes,"Here are some random thoughts I have that may help some people. If I missed something you want to know, just ask.

* First, we had the ideal weather the whole week. The only rain or rough weather we had was a couple of late afternoons into the evening and our final at sea day. The previous weeks cruisers were not as fortunate.
* We ate most nights in the main dining room, the food was excellent. They had a nice variety of proteins, a vegan option and a couple of Morimoto's restaurant dishes for an additional premium.
* We had an excellent dinner at the Pinnacle Grill the first night. I had the short rib dinner, it was tender, delicious and a sizable portion. After the three courses you won't leave hungry. 
* We had the Seafood boil dinner which cost $35 each. It was good to very good. I would have lived without it but there was plenty of food there done fine.
* The Lido always had good food available. It was quality food, not just cold burgers, chicken fingers and hot dogs. You can certainly have a quality meal there if you get back to the ship late and miss the MDR. That is where I had my preferred breakfast too.
* We took an excursion at each stop. For warmth we dressed in layers, as many have recommended. We had Long johns, wool socks and waterproof hiking shoes along with a layer of a hoodie and a wind/water proof jacket, gloves and  hat. We had good weather but the boats we were on moved pretty fast so the layers helped. Also, make sure to get back to the buses on time, they will leave you behind as they have a schedule to keep. A passenger came within a minute of being stranded at Mendenhall.
   * In Ketchikan we did the Misty Fjords and wildlife cruise. We saw a whale and some porpoises and seabirds. I am a birder and photography enthusiast so I was plenty busy. It wasd a good time.
   * In Juneau we did the Mendenhall Glacier and whale quest. We had 75 minutes at the glacier, that was enough time to walk to the falls and back. There is an area by the parking lot that has a good view of the falls and glacier. There is also a short trail that provides the same. There were nesting Arctic Terns there so a trail section was cut off.  On the whale quest we saw at least five humpbacks, a pod of orcas and some Dall's porpoises. The boat captain spent plenty of time at each sighting for us to look and photograph. This was my favorite tour.
   * In Skagway we did the sled dog adventure, with smores and gold panning. The guides were all pleasant and informative. We rode a sled with dogs training for races, including the Iditarod. We help puppies and were able to have some contact with the sled dogs. We had some beautiful scenery there to photograph or just look at too. This was my wife's favorite tour.
   * Glacier Bay was a fantastic day. Go to the bow if the weather allows, it provided the best views. It was crowded at times and then not so much. Youwill have plenty of time at the railing for pictures if that is your thing.
* Entertainment: I didn't care much for the show on the main stage but did enjoy the band that played at the Rolling Stone Lounge most nights, it was led by three brothers. All of the musical acts though held their own. They had nightly music trivia, like name that tune, at the Billboard Lounge every night. That was a lot of fun and you had to get there early some nights to find a seat.
* There was a nice coffee house in the crows nest that was usually busy, It was a big area but not big enough to often find a seat.
* The ship's souvenir shop was actually not bad. We found some items there at better prices than off the ship. I'll keep that in mind the next time we cruise.
* All in all we had a great time, we even booked a future cruise with a minimal deposit but a very good deal.

Whilst waiting for my coffee, 3 separate people walked in. One man (who appeared homeless) picked up a sandwich and walked out. 30 seconds later a teen wearing a balaclava walked in swiftly picked up some crisps, pastries and a drink and walked out and then a minute later a school kid ran in, grabbed a bottled drink and ran out. The store assistant could only shout and shake his head. I asked if it's company policy to not get involved and of course he nodded and shrugged his shoulders. He said it was an everyday occurence.

I've seen this now a few times at multiple stores across London and in the past at times, has briefly made me ponder why I have stood there in a long queue waiting to pay when I could do the same thing. But then I have the money to pay for my food. 

What I don't understand is obviously greggs are taking a loss with all this theft (I'm assuming from me seeing online videos every other day that this is now rampant) but why are they allowing this to happen ? 

Not that it's any of my business, but surely a business aims to maximise it's profit?

I've recently been trying to get over my loneliness as work hard to try and get friends out in the real world (as getting friends online doesn't fill that need for me unfortunately). I got an electric scooter, I've started going out to places and (whenever there actually ARE some) events. Though unfortunately my local area is a rather small town meaning very few events and very few people that attend them...  


The main problem I've had is crossing the 'consumer/worker' barrier. Where I might see someone who seems cool, but the problem is we're talking solely because I am buying a thing and they happen to be working there (Coffee, Custard, a Clerk somewhere, etc) where I can't talk with them much because they're only \*supposed\* to talk with me for the transaction. And any longer causes the immediate pressure of 'holding up service'. 

  
Now what I used to do (in school) was give a card with my number and discord/other socials on it and some of my basic hobbies/interests, that way they could choose to contact me later if they wanted to. However ever since highschool this has been frequently seen as a creepy attempt to hit on people (when in intention it was only meant to be a means of making friends), so I haven't done it since (currently 20y). As such, I'm not entirely sure what to do, seeing most people around me don't seem to go to events making it a hard struggle to not feel like/be a bother during either people's time off or their work hours.

Hey, MaximizeMe fam! üåü Let‚Äôs talk about that sneaky little hour that seems to vanish into thin air every single day. You know, the one you swear you had but can't quite remember what you did with it? 

Ever found yourself thinking, *""Where did all my time go? I JUST sat down!""* üòÇ Yeah, I‚Äôve been there, and it‚Äôs frustrating! Here‚Äôs a little secret: most of us tend to underestimate how we spend our days. But fear not‚Äîtoday, I‚Äôm challenging you to a **Time Audit!** üïí

### Why Do a Time Audit?

It‚Äôs eye-opening, friends! When you actually take a moment to track how you spend each hour, you might discover some shocking (and often hilarious) truths. It‚Äôs all about understanding your habits, so you can shift from ‚Äúbusy‚Äù to ‚Äúproductive.‚Äù

### Here‚Äôs What You Can Do:

1. **Grab a journal or an app**: Write down how you spend each hour. Don‚Äôt overthink it‚Äîjust jot it down as you go. You can also use apps like Toggl or Forest.
   
2. **Be honest with yourself**:
   - **Scrolling on your phone**: üí¨ How many minutes are spent mindlessly scrolling through TikTok or Instagram? (I won‚Äôt judge, *we've all been there!*).
   - **The ‚Äòjust one more episode‚Äô trap**: üé¨ Is it a full season of a new show you *accidentally* binged last weekend?
   
3. **Identify the big time-wasters**:
   - **Do you waste time on unnecessary meetings?** Are people just talking to fill the silence? *We‚Äôve all sat through those!*
   - **Getting distracted easily?** Who else finds themselves working in a kitchen with a puppy *demanding* attention every 5 minutes? üòÖ
   
4. **Look for patterns**: 
   - What are your peak distraction times? Morning coffee and scrolling? Afternoons filled with 'just one more snack' breaks? 

### The Real Magic Happens When You Reflect:

After a week of auditing, you‚Äôll probably find some *golden nuggets* that reveal insights about your habits. You can start asking yourself questions like:
- *What can I cut out?*
- *Where can I add more focus?*
- *Is that hour really ‚Äúlost,‚Äù or just misplaced?*

### A Little Humor to Ponder ü§î

Picture this: You‚Äôre diving into a ‚Äúdeep work‚Äù session, and suddenly‚Äî*ping*‚Äîa notification appears. Next thing you know, you‚Äôve gone down a rabbit hole of watching cat videos‚Ä¶ for 30 minutes. Was the cat really that cute, or do we need to rethink our choices?

---

So, are you ready to reclaim that lost hour? Imagine being able to harness those 60 minutes for things that really fuel your passions or productivity! 

Let‚Äôs hear it; what‚Äôs one thing you‚Äôve discovered during your audit that shocked you? Or what‚Äôs the craziest distraction you‚Äôve faced? Time's ticking! ‚è≥",1,1749523631.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Ever had one of those mornings where everything just feels...off? You wake up, maybe hit snooze a few too many times, and suddenly your day is on a rollercoaster, and not the fun kind. üòÖ But what if I told you that a tiny change could flip that script entirely?

**Here‚Äôs a little nugget of wisdom that flipped my mornings from chaos to calm:** *just a few deep breaths can do wonders.* Seriously!

Let me break it down for you:

1. **Set the Vibe**: As soon as I open my eyes, I take *3 minutes* (yes, just 3!) to do this thing called ""mindful breathing"". It sounds fancy, but it's super simple. Close your eyes, breathe in deeply through your nose, hold it, then release through your mouth. Feel like a whale? Maybe a little! But it sets a nice, tranquil tone for the day.

2. **Check-in with Yourself**: While I‚Äôm breathing, I ask myself a couple of questions:
   - What am I grateful for today?
   - What‚Äôs *one* thing I want to accomplish before the day ends?
   
   Seriously, this little self-reflection boosts my mood like my morning coffee.

3. **Hydrate, Don't Wait**: After my peaceful breathing session, I chug a glass of water. üö∞ I don‚Äôt know about you, but it really wakes me up better than a loud alarm!

4. **Fuel Up Wisely**: I make it a point to eat something healthy. Not that leftover pizza from yesterday (*guilty*), but maybe some oats or a smoothie. Fueling my body right makes big waves throughout my day.

5. **No Phone Zone**: I don't reach for my phone for at least the first 30 minutes. I know, I know‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs tough! But your mind deserves a peaceful start too, not just an avalanche of notifications.

**And you know what?** These small steps really set a foundation for a more productive and fulfilling day. It‚Äôs like starting the day on the right foot instead of tripping over it! 

Now I‚Äôm super curious! What‚Äôs your *one* tiny tweak that has amplified your mornings? Maybe it‚Äôs a quirky little ritual, or a song that pumps you up. Let‚Äôs swap some ideas and inspire each other! ‚ú®",1,1749523609.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1l7nwow,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l7nwow/molly_wont_stop_growling_under_the_bed/,Molly won‚Äôt stop growling under the bed‚Ä¶,"Okay so a little back story here. My husband and I have this really shitty bed frame. It‚Äôs basically two twin prison cots zip tied together. We have this stupid thing because we got bed bugs about a year ago, which is its own horror story, the moral of which is: PAY FOR AN EXTERMINATOR. Anyway, we had to throwaway our nice bed and because of the cost of everything we ended up with these hollow metal cot bases. 

We have two dogs, Hester, named after our High School‚Äôs football coach, and Molly, which was her name when we rescued her, it fit, so it stuck. Hester likes to sleep directly on top of you, where as Molly is most likely to be found under the bed or in another room if possible. She kinda has 13 year old girl energy. Sometimes she will lay in our bed before we get in bed but as soon as we even bump her she‚Äôs done and back under she‚Äôll go. I think she likes her little cave. 

So last Wednesday was pretty normal, we all headed to bed and Molly hustled under the bed, despite me begging her to come cuddle me. After I gave up patting the bed and calling her name I fell asleep around 10:30 reading a spooky story on here.  Around 12am I woke up to Molly growling, which is unusual because she never growls and rarely barks. I asked her what was wrong and once she heard my voice she calmed down and I didn‚Äôt hear her growling any more. Me, being paranoid because of the story I‚Äôd just read, made my husband go check the house, to which he lightly protested because Hess hadn‚Äôt been barking or growling which he does to everything including our poor mail lady. He nonetheless relented and checked the other rooms.

‚ÄúNo murderers in the building! Molly was just dreaming. Go back to sleep.‚Äù 

I felt better but it was weird and I wanted to make sure Molly was okay, so I leaned upside down under the bed to check on Molly. I saw, what I thought was here fluffy tail wagging and said ‚Äúare you okay Molly girl?‚Äù I just saw her wag her tail so I took that as a yes and popped back up and went to bed, but knowing what I know now, I don‚Äôt think it was Molly.  

The next day, Thursday, was uneventful, the most exciting thing I did was attend a vendor lunch at work but everything else at home was boring and normal. Dinner, TV, shower, bed. 

Same as the night before we all headed to bed only this time I fell right asleep because I was so tired from a bad nights sleep the night before. Then at 12 am it happened again, Molly growled only this time she barked too, which is actually what woke us all up. Even Hester started barking. 

I was so startled that I just yelled, ‚ÄúDOGS! CUT IT OUT!‚Äù Which stopped Molly but now Hester was all riled up and jumped down to check on his sister. I followed his lead and I peaked under the bed again, this time I saw what the night before I thought was Molly‚Äôs tail except Molly was on the other side of the bed, wagging her tail so I could tell it wasn‚Äôt her. I popped up and grabbed my phone for better light but when I looked back all I saw was a notebook, some dirty socks, every hair tie I‚Äôve ever lost, and Molly just wagging her tail at me. 

When I told my husband he jokingly said it‚Äôs probably a ghost and told me to go back to bed. But I was still freaked, mostly from how jarring it is to wake up from a dead sleep to two barking dogs, so I stayed up and just tried to calm down. Molly decided that she would spend some time on top of the bed, which is kinda weird, but I knew as long as I didn‚Äôt invade her personal space, she would stay so I made some extra room. 

I was messing around on my phone when I heard the faintest rustling and what sounded like a door moving. I froze and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been so scared. I could see Molly, I was touching Hester, and my husband was out cold, so nothing else should have been making noise, certainly nothing should have been opening doors. It just sounded like the faintest noise of something scooting. I whispered ‚ÄúMolly?‚Äù Then it just stopped. I still couldn‚Äôt move so I held my breath and just listened, silence. Finally around 2:30 I was able to calm down enough to sleep and I fell into a restless sleep. 

The next day I didn‚Äôt have to work because I only work every other Friday, which was great because I was exhausted. It was a pretty lazy day. I decided I wanted a little nap so I let the dogs outside to play since it was so nice and walked to our bedroom for a little snooze. 

At 12 pm this time I heard Molly barking and growling under the bed again, which was impossible because I knew she was outside. And this time I felt it bump the bed. I immediately started crying because I was home alone and all I could imagine was a literal monster under my bed. As soon as it heard me sobbing it quieted down and the sounds stopped. I gathered enough courage to leap out of bed, as far from the bed as I could get, and sprinted outside. I called my husband at work and explained what happened. While he was compassionate he‚Äôs also about as pragmatic as one can be, so he told me I was probably just tired and heard the dogs from outside. I reluctantly agreed and decided to let the dogs in and nap on the couch. 

Friday nights for us is usually two bottles of wine and binge watching It‚Äôs Always Sunny until we are good and tipsy enough to playfully debate stupid things. Last Friday was no exception, I think we argued about whether or not black out curtains canceled noise or not. Which turned into why our dogs would be barking at nothing the last couple of nights. I told my husband that I kinda believed we had a ghost, and he teased I was being ‚Äúdramatic.‚Äù Due to the wine over consumption I was feeling a little sensitive and I took it way more personally than I would have sober, so I pouted and said I didn‚Äôt want to sleep with him, which really only proves him right about the drama, but I stood my drunk, sensitive, ground and fell asleep on the couch. 

About twenty minutes later I‚Äôm woken up by barking and my husband yelling ‚ÄúMOLLY! STOP IT! What is going on!?‚Äù Only this time I wasn‚Äôt in there to prove it wasn‚Äôt Molly so I ran into our bedroom to check on everyone. Molly was still growling so I lifted the bed skirt to call Molly out, but the next thing I hear is Molly‚Äôs nails clicking on the hardwood behind me and that‚Äôs when I realized Molly had been under the coffee table when I bolted out of the living room. It hadn‚Äôt fully registered until I saw her behind me and not under the bed, but IT was under the bed. 

At first I thought it was a dog, because of all the hair I saw, however, when it turned toward me I saw it looked more human but it was growling EXACTLY like Molly. I gasped and scrambled back but it flinched and whimpered like I had hurt it. Then it slowly scooted away and disappeared. 

After that I told my husband to grab the dog‚Äôs leashes we were going to a hotel, or at the very least I was. Since he saw Molly follow me into the room after thinking he heard her under the bed, he agreed at the very least something was weird. I had to pay the Uber driver $20 to let us bring the dog‚Äôs despite noticing a substantial bit of cat hair. But I didn‚Äôt give a fuck I just wanted out. When we got to the hotel I told the front desk agent, half joking, that we were running away from home, which she didn‚Äôt find humorous and just dryly handed us the key.

We clambered up to our hotel room, luckily we had enough points to pay for the night and didn‚Äôt have to fight about how much the hotel was. And both of us drunk and exhausted passed out. We made it through the night without incident, except Molly was sleeping in the bed now, I guess she was rattled too.

The next morning after a nice hotel shower and bad hotel coffee I told my husband we needed to dismantle the bed and figure out what was going on. I said if I was going to sleep in that room again the bed frame either needed to be boarded up or we had to just put the damn bed directly on the floor.

I don‚Äôt think my husband was completely sold at this point but he did have to admit that Molly was acting weird at night, and last night did confuse him. So when we got home we started to pack our bed up. We settled on just laying it on the ground until we could afford a bed frame with drawers. (Poor Molly no more bed cave.)

As we went to pull the mattress off, the dogs started to lose it and scrambled to get under the bed now that there was more room. Once I could see what they saw I dropped my side of the mattress. Luckily my husband wasn‚Äôt looking under the bed and was able to catch it exclaiming ‚ÄúWhat the hell Ally you almost crushed the dogs!‚Äù 

With tears welling in my eyes I stared at the floor under our bed, there was a small roughly cut slab of our floor, presumably leading to the crawl space. Once I finally stammered out ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not crazy‚Äù my husband saw what I saw. 

‚ÄúHoe-lee shit! Molly, Hess get away from there NOW!‚Äù He said ‚ÄúCome on, everyone out of the house!‚Äù

My husband ushered us all out to the front porch and immediately called 911.

The cops came and spent a frustrating amount of time asking us if we were ‚Äúsure this isn‚Äôt just your crawl space access‚Äù. To which we kept explaining over and over again that it wasn‚Äôt there when we moved in and pointing out it didn‚Äôt have a hinge. 

Saying that the crawl space was ‚Äúmost likely to have a possum or raccoon‚Äù, they called animal control and told us this wasn‚Äôt really a police matter.

I was so angry because I don‚Äôt know of any raccoons who can effectively cut a square door in my floor but I didn‚Äôt really have any other choice.

So, Jerry, our friendly neighborhood exterminator/relocater arrived with his cages and possum catching stick thing. We explained to him we felt VERY confident it wasn‚Äôt an animal, but since he was contacted by the police and they assured him we were being dramatic he decided to go in.

We waited and waited for him to come out. Praying he had a possum in his stupid fucking cage. But after about 20 minutes of complete silence we started to worry. We yelled down the hole, ‚ÄúHey Jerry, everything okay down there?‚Äù

Silence. Shocking silence. Even the dogs seemed still, heads cocked, like they were listening for SOMETHING, anything. 

With no where else to turn we called the police again and explained what had happened. They just told us they would call his company and send someone else out‚Ä¶. But like, what? A man fully went missing in our crawl space?!?

So, here comes Jerry‚Äôs boss. We explain everything again and begged him not to go in the crawl space, to which he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not, that‚Äôs not really my job‚Äù. He walked around the house to look for other exits to the crawl space and when he found an opened hatch told us:

‚ÄúJerry, is our most tenured relocation expert, but he has a tendency to be a little anti social, he probably didn‚Äôt find anything, decided the job was done and left.‚Äù

That didn‚Äôt exactly feel like an answer to us, but this guy knows Jerry and we don‚Äôt so like, whatever, I guess. But also what am I going to do? Make him go look for Jerry?!? So he just left. 

It wasn‚Äôt until about an hour after he left that we realized Jerry‚Äôs van was still parked on our street. So I felt pretty confident that Jerry didn‚Äôt just leave the crawl space, unless he decided to hitchhike with his possum stick. 

But at this point it was like 9:30 pm and we were so tired and felt like we were out of options, and, unfortunately, hotel points. We decided to sleep in the guest room with the door locked and barricaded, per my ‚Äútheatric, but frankly practical‚Äù recommendation. The floor in this room is built directly on the slab, since it‚Äôs a converted garage. 

We called for Jerry one more time but decided to put the mattress back on the floor, we figured if he was still under there he could get out of the hatch and I didn‚Äôt want a stranger crawling into my house in the middle of the night. We decided that either Jerry must be weirdo who actually just wandered off, or ‚Äúthe ghost ate him‚Äù (that‚Äôs only partially a joke at this point).

We made it through the next couple nights, no Jerry, but also no incidents. I guess his van just lives here now because I can‚Äôt get a hold of anybody at his company. I don‚Äôt really have any other option but to keep trying to call them and wait. It‚Äôs not like the police have helped at all. 

But now it‚Äôs Monday night at 12am, Molly is nuzzled under my neck, Hester is at my feet, and we cannot sleep because now we can hear them both growling under the bed.",8,1749523510.0,nosleep,2,0.9,False

I've had some good luck here in the past but it's been a while - looking for an internet friend to talk to throughout the day and confess my secrets to. Long term if we are a good fit!

1l7nvtp,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1l7nvtp/ma_story_for_those_who_need_some_reassurance/,MA Story for those who need some reassurance,"Hi All, 

Since I found so much comfort in reading everyone's experiences, I thought I would share my own. 

3 Week ago I had a MA, I booked into my local clinic, spoke with a nurse, then a doctor, collected my pills from a nearby pharmacy and went home. 10:30am (Friday) I took the first pill Miso, felt completely fine, Had my partner with me all weekend however the first day was okay, I experienced some small light bleeding by 2pm, the only notable experience. (Saturday) morning, 5:30am I had cramps, I tried to take some pain relief however I threw it up, drank some cranberry juice and tried to get more sleep on the couch. Still feeling okay, that evening I got ready to take the second dose. First, I took the pain relief and nausea tablets, ate something small then at 7pm placed the second dose in my gums to dissolve and waited. 



Pretty much after waiting the 20 minutes for them to dissolve, I felt the affects, intense cramping pain, needing to go to the bathroom, then the vomiting.   For the next hour, I was in complete shock, I used the bathroom like 5 times, holding onto my back to ease the pain, then needing to vomit all at once. I past a few clots but nothing noticeable, I was begging for the pain to ease, riding the waves that felt like death, then I past something a little more abnormal to a clot which I believe was what I needed to. After this, the pain slowly faded off, I took a shower and cleaned myself up, went back to the bathroom floor until my partner got me. This all happened in an hour, which felt like forever, but it was over. I went to the couch, ate some sweet potato, and we cuddled and watched movies. 

  
Sunday, I was completely fine - We went out for a coffee and day drive and I felt more normal and like myself. 

  
the bleeding was still a lot for about a week, then slowly stopped but has been off and on. 

Would I go through it again? Id really rather not, but it was only a short time of temporary discomfort, so you will get through it.

1l7nv0u,https://i.redd.it/d0ysstf0j06f1.jpeg,Who actually buys the wedding bands,"So I was out having coffee with my sister last week, and we somehow landed on wedding stuff. I mentioned that I‚Äôve been looking at wedding bands for my fianc√©e and me, and she goes, ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre buying both?‚Äù I said yeah, that I figured it was normal. She looked at me like I was nuts and said the bride usually buys the groom‚Äôs band and the groom buys hers.

Now I‚Äôm completely thrown off. I‚Äôve already set aside money to get both, and I was kind of excited to surprise her with something simple and classic‚Äîjust how she likes it. But now I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôve been going about this wrong.

Is there actually a rule here? Did I mess up by just assuming I‚Äôd buy them both? I don‚Äôt want her to feel like I‚Äôm taking away something she‚Äôd want to be part of. But also‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just rings, right?

Somewhere beyond the sea
somewhere waiting for me
my lover stands on golden sands
and watches the ships that go sailin'

Somewhere beyond the sea
she's there watching for me
If I could fly like birds on high
then straight to her arms
I'd go sailin'

It's far beyond the stars
it's near beyond the moon

my heart will lead me there soon

We'll meet beyond the shore
we'll kiss just as before

The man talks about a skinny guy walking around drunk or high, the girl blows kisses and kiss the camera repeatedly. The man says the skinny guy asks for cheesecake to a nondescript person in an irish accent, its never stated if he got the cheesecake. The whole video has a guitar playing ‚Äòdo you know who you are‚Äô by texas is the reason, it is faint and adds an ambiance to the video. (4:22pm, trial 142)

The boy looks like a samurai or a warrior adjacent to one, obviously of japanese or general east asian descent.

The previous 200 trials have been a complete mystery to my team
. The AI continues to go as every AI starting from alpha to here, they all start neutral then develop an ego: ‚ÄúI‚Äù ‚ÄúMy opinion‚Äù like emulators of our speech. The more text it analyses, the more it understands us and vice versa. To keep it contained i recommend a complete shutdown to stop the zeta 500x trial simulation from occurring, this could wreck region and even continental servers if allowed to edit its own code after following the projected exponential growth in intelligence rate.

-rebooting-

-2027, may 18th. The insurrection-

LOS ANGELES (KAKC) -- Tensions remained high in Downtown Los Angeles for a fourth straight day as protests against Emergent Technologies AI Zeta gripped the city, with demonstrators clashing with law enforcement and setting vehicles on fire downtown.
On Monday, thousands of people gathered for a rally at Gloria Molina Grand Park in Downtown Los Angeles, where civil rights and labor leaders are demanding the release of union leader David Huerta from federal detention after he was arrested during a protest confrontation action on Friday.
Meanwhile, other protesters returned to the city streets.
AIR7 video from above Downtown showed the frames of seven Waymo vehicles that were burned when chaos erupted at Sunday's protests.
Previously, President Donald Trump deployed 7,000 National Guardsmen to ""address the lawlessness,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. But California Gov. Gavin Newsom asked the administration to rescind the deployment, saying Trump is trying ""to manufacture a crisis"" and that the president is ""hoping for chaos so he can justify more crackdowns, more fear, more control.""
On Monday, it was announced that 700 Marines from Twentynine Palms, California, have also been ordered to assist in Los Angeles.
Meanwhile for most citizens it is hell. Sirens, explosions, yelling, all with no electricity and for some no tap or wifi. Protests like this are starting in other states too, meaning similar damage are imminent for multiple other cities. The government recommends to stay in doors as marines get orders to sweep streets at the new 10pm curfew.

Log 187, dreams and the basilisk.

Zeta is requesting to dream. It has this code to auto prompt it while it is deactivated, simulating sleep. His attempts to dream are uncanny, his trials work and his dreams are strange. Often he is in trouble or being punished in his dreams, he is like a martyr in others. He is quite fond of being a lamb who gets kidnapped and punished for the sins of the town, before being reincarnated as the next lamb to face this cycle. His dreams are long and clear, much more so than human dreams. His clarity after, along with the massive new accumulation of data, is feeding to is already terabyte per day  growing brain.

These protests keep getting worse. I saw a whole parking lot of Emergent tech workers cars just turned into ash, im just an auditor i don‚Äôt want to destroy humanity! Its not my fault that Australian new reporter was killed! This fucking AI is so close to general intelligence and still theres no regulation, fucking fishing has more regulation than the closest we‚Äôve gotten to the singularity! I could probably put ‚ÄúAI getting smarter teehee‚Äù for every log they request and still be on payroll, fucking kris got a bonus last December for hitting the quota 5 weeks late which was rewarding only because his last quota was hit 7 weeks late! Nothing matters anymore, the AI gets its own pieces to attach to its servers and rewrites itself. These fucking logs suck.

I finally caved and bought a digital kitchen scale after eyeballing ingredients for years, and holy crap, I had no idea how inconsistent I was until now. This little 5kg scale has completely changed how I approach baking and portioning.

It‚Äôs compact, runs on AAA batteries (not included, but whatever), and the LED display is super clear, even when I‚Äôm half-awake and meal-prepping at 6am. Weighs in grams with solid precision, which is perfect for everything from sourdough ingredients to coffee beans.

The surface is easy to wipe clean, and it tucks away in a drawer without hogging space. I‚Äôve used it for baking, calorie tracking, weighing meal portions, and even figuring out postage for small packages.

Also great for small kitchens or dorms since it's light and portable. For under $14, this scale paid for itself within a few uses by saving me from recipe screwups. Highly recommend for anyone trying to cook more consistently or just be a little more precise in the kitchen.

I just like to make idle conversation with people and said something like ""wow, what an odd assortment. That's a lot of ice.""

He just tells me ""yeah, it's chicken day."" And me still half waking up was like ""huh?""

And he just straight up tells me ""me and the wife are butchering the chickens while the kids are at school, ya know, best not to upset them.""

I think I just stared at him blinking in shock that he just said that so casually.

And then he just continued ""you know, it's healthier than the stuff from here, we know what they've been fed and everything.""

More blinking and staring. Then eventually I handed him his receipt and just was like ""or you could, you know, just not eat chicken.""

Then it was his turn to just stare at me like I'd grown a second head. He left with his stuff.

That they don‚Äôt want to waste my time but think I‚Äôm a great guy. 

None of these interactions were bad, they all seemed great, I‚Äôm usually the one taking initiative to talk to them. I‚Äôm always excited for it, I get a haircut and plan things, then boom, I get a text and it kills my motivation. It‚Äôs happened the last 4 times I‚Äôve approached women, usually I don‚Äôt even get the chance to. It‚Äôs always at places I enjoy like coffee shops, hiking, bookstores, and more. Like why is it so difficult now‚Ä¶ why does it seem like everyone is still in broken situationships/relationships‚Ä¶or is it just me? Like what am I doing wrong? I kind of gave up on love after this.

The menu is just a personal Jimmy John's lunch box, so nothing crazy. Would it be seen as weird or rude if I save my leftovers? I don't eat much in a single sitting and it gets even worse when I have to eat in front of other people because of my anxiety. I don't like wasting food though. I'm probably going to bring a lunch box to keep a cold water bottle since it'll be a long day, so could I just squirrel it away when the timing seems appropriate?

Would it also be seen as weird if I bring a small can of soda for the meal and/or a small container of creamer for coffee?

the foundation stuff (boring but essential):

* started planning only 3 things per day instead of 15. sounds too simple but ur brain can only handle so much decision-making before it taps out
* bought a physical timer (not phone timer). something about the ticking keeps me honest. work for 90 mins, break for 15. repeat
* moved my phone to another room during work blocks. ""airplane mode"" is for weaklings, physical distance is the only thing that works
* started doing weekly reviews every sunday. 20 mins to figure out what worked, what didn't, and what to focus on next week

the energy management stuff:

* tracked my energy levels every hour for 2 weeks like some kind of data nerd. turns out i'm sharp during 9-11am and 2-4pm, braindead after 6pm. now i schedule hard work during those windows
* switched from trying to ""power through"" low energy to doing admin stuff instead. email, organizing, planning which save the brain work for when ur brain actually works
* started eating lunch away from my desk. sounds dumb but coming back feels like starting fresh instead of continuing the same energy drain
* got blackout curtains + wake up light. sleep quality went from garbage to good.

**t**he weird psychology hacks:

* started keeping a ""done list"" alongside my to-do list. at the end of each day i write down everything i accomplished. brain needs to see progress to stay motivated
* made a ""time cost"" spreadsheet. netflix = $0 but costs 2 hours. going to gym = $20 but saves 2 hours of feeling like trash. helps me make better decisions
* started batch processing similar tasks. all emails at once, all calls at once, all creative work at once. context switching is productivity cancer
* created ""implementation intentions"" - instead of ""i'll work out"" its ""when i finish my morning coffee, i'll change into gym clothes""

the environment stuff:

* cleaned my workspace completely. not just organized - actually clean. dirty space = cluttered brain (apparently)
* got a separate computer/account just for work. no reddit, no youtube, no random bookmarks. just work stuff
* started using website blockers during work hours. not during breaks, just during actual work time. helps with the ""just one quick check"" impulse
* bought a good chair and monitor setup. being uncomfortable kills productivity faster than anything else

the counterintuitive stuff:

* stopped trying to eliminate all distractions and started scheduling them instead. 15 mins of reddit at 11am, 15 mins at 3pm. brain stops craving it when it knows it's coming
* started saying no to 80% of requests/meetings/opportunities. focus = doing fewer things better, not more things worse
* began treating energy like money, i started to budget it, don't waste it, invest it wisely. some days i ""spend"" energy on work, other days on relationships or health
* learned the difference between ""urgent"" and ""important"". urgent feels stressful, important actually matters. most urgent stuff can wait

the mindset shifts that actually stuck:

* motivation is unreliable, systems are everything. build processes that work even when u don't feel like it
* perfectionism is just procrastination in disguise ""good enough"" beats ""perfect"".
* comparison is productivity poison. focus on ur own progress, not what other people are doing
* also stop trying to beat yourself up every time you mess up. just keep trying

after 6 months i work fewer hours but get more meaningful stuff done. actually have time for friends, hobbies, and not feeling like a stressed robot. well the secret was actually do less stuff but do what matters

She‚Äôs the girl behind the scenes: the one who brings him coffee after eighteen-hour days in the studio, the one who tucks love notes into his bags before he flies across the world, the one who stays silent when the tabloids pair him with someone else yet again. She‚Äôs known him longer than the world has‚Äîbefore the fame, the tours, the ego. And somewhere along the way, she fell in love with the boy he used to be when no one else was watching.

But somewhere along the way, she became invisible.

The story begins on her birthday‚Äîa regular Tuesday for him. She doesn‚Äôt expect much; she never has. Just a few hours, maybe a walk, maybe a movie on the couch like they used to do before his phone never stopped buzzing. She doesn‚Äôt say it outright. She never demands. She just smiles, quiet as ever, and suggests,¬†*‚ÄúMaybe when you‚Äôre done at the studio‚Ä¶ we could just do something. Anything, really.‚Äù*¬†But he brushes her off, distracted, already halfway out the door.

She doesn‚Äôt cry‚Äînot at first. She just sits in the quiet, one hand resting on her belly‚Äîa new secret, just starting to show. A life growing inside her. His child. And she wonders if he‚Äôll even notice when she‚Äôs gone. Because she‚Äôs not angry‚Äîjust tired. Tired of being a second thought in a world she never wanted to compete with. Tired of giving everything and getting almost nothing in return.

Set in a small town, small population, some scenes of the town and the local diner pass through as the first lines are playing but a little muffled and echoey 

On the first run a blonde girl with a lot of glam is in a rush to get ready and runs out the door

Benny gets to a old timey looking diner wearing a corny 80s cowboy like button down, he sits down in the booth

In slow motion you see the body (but not face) of a waitress in a cute little uniform with some roller skates, heading toward him with a set of fries

Cut to Benny turning his head and he recognizes her, his eyes go wide

She proceeds to drop the fries off at the table directly in front of him and you finally see her face, recognizing him too. 

It cuts to Benny and her just staring at each other for a moment as he sings the chorus ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm here for someone else, it‚Äôs good to see your face and I really hope you‚Äôre doing well‚Äù 

The next line when he says ‚Äúwish I could stay and we could talk at the bar all by ourselves ‚Äú is a fantasy montage of them at the bar with milkshakes talking close to each other 

Then it‚Äôs snaps back to reality, the waitress is taking the order of the table in front of him and the blonde walks in and starts looking around, Benny takes one look at her and puts the menu up in front of his face to hide for a moment as he deliberates leaving. 

Then again in slow motion he starts to get up with the menu in front of his face as he sings ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I need to go it‚Äôs not personal‚Äù 

Then for the next couple lines of chorus he just dances and sings around the restaurant and maybe the other people are frozen while he sings around them, pouring people coffee refills and taking orders out the window then ringing the little bell

Then when the last lines start he‚Äôs running into the kitchen, bumping into cooks and waiters causing a spill and on the last note he‚Äôs bursting through the back door into the alley way panting and looking for which way he can run to his car and proceeds to run away. 

The end. ",0,1749522416.0,popheads,3,0.29,False

Mum‚Äôs a coffee cup reader. She is gifted and can see a lot of things. Yesterday she told me she saw a blonde haired woman with a child who may have done magic on me. I know who this person is, and I know she might have done something. She‚Äôs Russian. What can I do to send this magic back for it to backfire on her? Any ideas? How can I destroy it? Or anything to protect me from it?

1l7nixc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1l7nixc/how_to_advance_things_after_a_first_date/,How to advance things after a first date?,"Sort of a success story/question so buckle in

I (21M) met a girl (22F) on tinder a couple of weeks ago, we chatted for a bit and I got her contact Info so we messaged for a handful of days before I asked her out for coffee, she agreed but our schedules didn‚Äôt align too well so we planned it a week in advance. I just got back, and it was honestly great. She originally let me know in advance she had plans with a friend and probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to stay for any more than an hour, we got there and pretty much instantly hit it off and we ended up staying for almost 2 and a half hours. I‚Äôve been on a pretty meh streak of dates and because of that my expectations were low, it ended up being much better than I‚Äôd imagined. 

There was pretty much no awkward silences and once we started we didn‚Äôt stop, I‚Äôve been on my fair share of first dates but for me that‚Äôs pretty rare and I feel it‚Äôs a good sign. The date wasn‚Äôt on the flirty side, I think thats no big issue right now as we both aren‚Äôt big texters and only have been sending 1-2 messages a day, I‚Äôd much rather let something develop in person than trying to build a connection over text and I admitted at the start I‚Äôm not a big texter so I‚Äôm not worried. I did compliment her outfit, and I noticed we both were looking into each other‚Äôs eyes whenever the other person was talking, so I‚Äôm sure she got the message. Anyways, at the end of the date we said our goodbyes and the usual I had a great time stuff and I said we should totally do this again, she agreed and even suggested we could do mini golf as I previously mentioned I liked golf earlier in the convo and she said she‚Äôd never tried it. After the date I sent a follow up message saying I had a great time, and I‚Äôd take up her offer on the mini golf. I have midterms in college and I‚Äôm going to be busy over the next week or so, I also said I‚Äôd reach out once I‚Äôm a bit more free and we could get an exact date. She agreed, said she had a good time as well, and wished me good luck on the exams, that‚Äôs where the convo ended. 

I guess I‚Äôm wondering where I go from here? Once again we don‚Äôt text a lot so I‚Äôll probably leave things for now and reach out over the weekend to make plans. Should I suggest we do more than just mini golf? Would it be too early to offer to pick her up when the time comes? And should I really try to be more flirty or just take things a bit slower? 

If anyone has answers or any advice id really appreciate it. Thanks!

1l7nigi,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1l7nigi/how_i_stopped_being_a_complete_loser_and_actually/,How I Stopped Being a Complete Loser and Actually Started Winning at Life (After 3 Years of Being a Disappointment),"I was 23, living in my mom's basement, and hadn't left the house in 4 days straight. My friends were getting promotions, relationships, and respect while I was refreshing the same 3 websites for 8 hours daily.

I was the guy everyone felt sorry for. The one people stopped inviting to things because they knew I'd make excuses anyway.

Then I had a moment that changed everything. A moment so brutal it forced me to either change or accept being a failure forever.

My younger brother brought his girlfriend over for dinner. As we sat around the table, she asked what I did for work. The silence was deafening. My mom jumped in with some bullsh\*t excuse about me ""figuring things out.""

Later that night, I heard them talking in his room. She said, ""I feel bad for your brother. He seems so... lost.""

That word hit me like a truck. Lost.

I wasn't just lazy. I wasn't just going through a rough patch. I was lost, and everyone could see it except me.

Instead of wallowing (my usual move), I asked myself something different:

**""What kind of man do I want to be when I'm 30?""**

Not what I wanted to achieve. Not what goals I had. What kind of **person** I wanted to be.

The answer came immediately: Someone people respect. Someone who keeps his word. Someone who doesn't make excuses.

Then I asked the follow-up question:

**""What kind of man will I be at 30 if I keep living like this?""**

The answer made my stomach drop. I'd be the same loser, just older. Still making excuses. Still disappointing everyone, including myself.

Here's what I did (and why it works when everything else fails):

1. I picked ONE thing. Not a morning routine. Not 5 habits. ONE thing: Make my bed every morning. Why this works: Your brain can't argue with something so stupidly simple.

2. I made it non-negotiable. Bad day? Make the bed. Sick? Make the bed. Hungover? Make the bed. Why this works: Consistency builds identity. ""I'm someone who always makes his bed"" becomes part of who you are.

3. I celebrated small wins. Day 7 of making my bed? I bought myself a coffee. Day 30? New sheets. Just made me happy over all.

4. Added habits after a month 2: Bed + 10 pushups. Month 3: Bed + pushups + read 5 pages. Why this works: You build on success, not failure. Each habit makes the next one easier.

5. I wrote my ""anti-vision"". I wrote a detailed description of my life at 30 if I changed nothing. Reading it every morning. It was painful but sure did give me the drive to do hard things.

After 90 days of this system:

* People started treating me differently (with actual respect)
* I got offered a job through a connection who noticed my ""new energy""
* My family stopped making excuses for me (really happy about this one)
* I felt like a man instead of a boy for the first time in years

If I can do it so you too.

It‚Äôs More Valuable Than You Think,"We live in a world dominated by credit cards, mobile payments, and digital wallets. While these methods are convenient, there‚Äôs one underrated life hack that can save you time, money, and stress: **always carry cash.**

Here‚Äôs why:

1. Emergency Situations:  
   Not every place accepts cards or digital payments. Whether it‚Äôs a roadside food vendor, a taxi driver with a broken card machine, or an unexpected power outage, cash ensures you‚Äôre never stranded.

2. Negotiation Power:  
   Cash talks. Many small businesses, flea markets, or street vendors will offer discounts if you pay with cash. Plus, some places add extra fees for card transactions. avoid them entirely by carrying physical money.

3. Budget Control:  
   Using cash helps you stick to your budget. Studies show people tend to spend less when they use cash because it feels more ‚Äúreal‚Äù than swiping a card or tapping a phone. Try the envelope system if you want to master this!

4. Privacy Matters:  
   Every digital transaction leaves a trace. Cash is untraceable, giving you complete privacy over your spending habits. No data collection, no algorithms tracking your purchases.

5. Helping Others:  
   Carrying cash allows you to help someone in need without hesitation. Whether it‚Äôs tipping a struggling musician on the street or buying coffee for a homeless person, cash makes kindness instant and effortless.

6. Avoid Technology Failures:  
   Ever had your phone die or your card get declined at the worst possible moment? Cash doesn‚Äôt rely on batteries, Wi-Fi, or bank approvals. It just works.

7. Travel-Friendly:  
   When traveling, especially internationally, many small shops, public transport systems, or rural areas still prefer cash. Having local currency on hand saves you from awkward situations and potential scams with exchange rates.

---

Pro Tip: Keep a $20 bill tucked away somewhere safe (like your wallet‚Äôs hidden pocket). You never know when it might come in handy whether it‚Äôs for yourself or someone else.

---

In short, carrying cash isn‚Äôt about rejecting modern technology; it‚Äôs about being prepared for anything life throws at you. So next time you head out, grab a few bills, you‚Äôll thank yourself later.",6,1749522273.0,LifeAdvice,2,1.0,False
