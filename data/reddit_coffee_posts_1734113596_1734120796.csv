My prep involves a proper tamper, wdt tool, having the portafilter in the machine to heat up while the machine is heating and using a puck screen. With the bottomless portfilter the shot pulls very fast, unevenly and squirts all over the place. I used the Gaggia coffee beans and had them ground at the wholefoods grinder with the finest setting.

1hdl18t,https://www.reddit.com/r/bergerbelge/comments/1hdl18t/is_a_gornenedale_a_good_choice_for_my_needs/,Is a Gornenedale a good choice for my needs? ,"I'm considering adding another dog to my household and have been looking into Belgian Groenendaels. I am an expeince dog owner. I have had high intesity dogs for many years, mostly KNPV-line Dutch Shepherds and Malinois, but my current dogs are West German working-line GSDs. Both are intact males, ages 5 and 8, and are trained for PPD work. They are fully capable man-stoppers with extreme drives. They are also well-behaved, exceptionally trained, and fully adjusted to city life in a busy neighborhood.

Since they’re highly territorial, I’m cautious about introducing them to house guests unless the guests are dog-savvy and have met them several times. My younger dog isn’t very social and doesn’t enjoy outings, so he usually stays home unless we are doing a neighborhood walk or rural hike. My older dog, who has higher energy and more intense drives, is very social and accompanies me to work or runs errands in the city 2-3 days a week. Otherwise I work from home. He’s excellent on public transport and a perfect gentleman in busy environments. He is an  ideal coffee shop dog and I highly value that. 

We don’t do much high-energy physical activity outside of bite work, but they’re both mentally and physically stimulated. We walk and play fetch three times a week for 90 minutes. Most day though, I incorporate several short training sessions with tug or food rewards. We do a lot of fabcy prancy obedience training and free shaping. We go to rally classes but dont plan on trialing. Occasionally, they use the treadmill for exercise. They’re mischievous and require tight structure and supervision. Despite their high drives, they coexist peacefully with my three cats.

I’ve had serious working dogs for so long that I might be out of touch with what ""normal"" dog ownership looks like. 😅 After years of intense, high-drive dogs, I’m looking for something toned down—a dog that’s sweet, cuddly, and less intense compared to a Malinois or working-line GSD. Something that is just one step down.

I’ve been around a few Groenendaels and know some breeders and owners, but my sample size is small. I’ve seen traits I love and some that concern me, so I’m hoping to get more insight here. Here’s what I’m looking for:


Less intensity compared to a Malinois or working-line GSD—a dog that defaults to walking or trotting instead of sprinting everywhere. A generally peppy but relaxed personality that can settle easily. My next dog should be a good house dog who won’t need constant monitoring past age 3.  


A dog that’s trustworthy around respectful house guests when properly introduced—able to hang out on a place mat or interact calmly without me constantly refereeing.  


 A cuddly dog. My Dutchies/Mals were great cuddlers, but my GSDs are more “hang out next to you” types.  


Aloof with strangers in public but able to tolerate polite interactions with kids or adults when allowed. I don’t want a dog pulling me to meet people, but I also want them to navigate crowds calmly.  


Strong environmental stability. I live in a busy, dog-friendly city, so the dog must handle loud noises, slick floors, and bumpy rail cars without fear.  


Active enough to enjoy tug and fetch but not vibrating with energy. I want a dog that’s satisfied with walks and obedience training.  


A healthy dog with good longevity. I love my GSDs, but we’ve encountered health issues my Malinois didn’t have, and I know they likely won’t live as long.  


A dog in the 40-60 lb range.  


Absolutely no tolerance for dog aggression. I live a social life with frequent exposure to other dogs. While I don’t let my dogs play with others except close friends or family, I cannot have a dog prone to starting fights.


I’m fortunate to live near a working-line Groenendael breeder whose dogs I’ve seen train and trial. They’re lovely and comparable to high-drive Mals or GSDs, but I haven’t seen them off the field and don’t know if a working-line Groenendael fits my goals. I worry they may be too silmilar to my gsds. I’d likely look for dogs bred for AKC obedience, rally, or conformation that does not need to be satisfied by bitework. 

The Groenendaels I’ve met have been playful, gentle, and sweet with a polite disposition I love. However, a rally acquaintance of mine once got a Groenendael puppy from a show/obedience breeder that was a complete wash. The puppy was fearful of loud noises, new environments, and slick floors, with middling toy drive. My friend spent months building drive, but the dog would still shut down in the ring if something unexpected happened. While the puppy was sweet and playful, that would be a deal-breaker for me. I live in a loud, unpredictable environment where confidence and environmental stability are non-negotiable.

I’d love to hear from Groenendael owners about their experiences. Does this sound like the right breed for me, or should I just give up and look for another breed?

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

I think tea and coffee is minimum, and because it's close to Xmas and they're here all day adding biscuits and sausage rolls is normal! Am I right...or a little too British?

1hdkv43,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1hdkv43/anxious_about_meeting_meta_for_coffee/,Anxious about meeting meta for coffee,"Hi everyone,

I need some advice on how to ask my partner to hinge better. I recently began a new relationship with someone who I have known for a couple years now - I have also known his wife for the same amount of time. For the most part, my relationship with both of them was pretty much just acquaintance level. But a few months ago during an event I connected deeply and unexpectedly with my now partner and we began a relationship thereafter. I am his first relationship since they opened up their marriage a few years ago. 

My partner has told me that my meta would like to have him officially introduce me to them as his partner now that we have been together for a couple months. My partner and I are planning to go to an event together a few hours south of us this weekend and since we do not live in the same city, I will be driving down to meet with him in his town and then we will continue on from there and he will drive the rest of the way, and he proposed that before we continue on, I can have coffee with him and my meta so he can give her my official introduction as his partner. 

The issue is that I am finding myself quite anxious about this coffee date. I don’t know what exactly we are supposed to talk about if we are going to just be sitting down somewhere together the three of us for the first time. It is also weird because I have been distant acquaintances with my meta for a couple years now.

How do I communicate this anxiety to him? Since I am his first relationship since opening up their marriage, he has never had to hinge before, and I am also fairly new to being poly (I’ve been dating poly for just a little less than a year now) so although I feel like this isn’t probably the best way for this meeting to happen, I don’t know how best to communicate this.

Hi! Throw away account because my partner follows my other account. 

I just need some real truthful advice if I’m expecting too much or my thoughts are rational. 

I (F35) him (M42) we have been together for two years  started dating January 2022 and got married July 2024. So I’ve experience two birthdays with him and he’s experienced one with me(which was last weekend) 

He has been single for 8 years just sporadically dating but never anything more than 6 months and I was married for a little over 10 years before divorcing in early 2021. I want to mention even though my ex husband was an asshole he was always very good about birthdays and gifts. Would plan it out a month ahead and he always was very thoughtful about his birthday plans and normally it was a pretty cool surprise and that week out of the year he made me feel very special in a lot of ways. Alas, repetitive cheating, lying, and gaslighting over the course of the final year with no attempts of remorse or reconciliation lead to our divorce. 

Okay now to the current situation. On my husband’s birthdays he doesn’t expect anything big but I’ve tried to make them extra special in every way that I can. Remembering or writing down things he’s mentioned that he wants or wants to do through the year and making it happen or just coming up with fun random things to do. I’ve really tried to make it thoughtful. Last year I felt like he did good with my birthday. Got my favorite coffee and breakfast without me asking. Arranged a meal with friends(that I knew about) and did a fun activity. He had also prepared ahead of time and got me a thoughtful gift. It was a nice birthday. 

This year was different and I’m not sure if I’m wrong for thinking or feeling this way or if it is a rational feeling. 

Days leading up to my birthday there was a dinner planned with family(which is something I’ve done every year) but another plan that I’d asked to do with friends fell through because of a Christmas party that weekend at their work. That’s completely fine. Totally understand people are busy this time of year. I assumed(which maybe I shouldn’t have) that he would plan something with just us or do little things through the week to still make my birthday feel a bit special. I had mentioned a few times that I was happy about turning 35 and aging was getting me down. 
Getting closer to the day it was becoming more and more apparent that nothing was planned, and I was a bit bummed but kept it to myself and even before the day got there he would say things like “I should have done better” “I don’t know what you want to do” “I don’t know what I should do” “it’s just another day” when it wasn’t even my birthday yet. So I’d just say back “there is still time or don’t worry about it” because I was a bit disappointed but I didn’t want him to feel bad, but he still knew I was expecting something at least a bit thoughtful. So the day came and went and it was just underwhelming. He got me lunch that I asked for because I had a birthday coupon and we ate dinner at one of our usual restaurants. Then did some Christmas shopping upon his request on Friday. I kind of thought there might have been plans for Saturday but nope. Nothing. A bit underwhelming but I was kind of like whatever it’s fine trying to stay grateful. The part that really got me is I felt like he threw the gift he got me together the day before. An online gift card to Amazon and a few nicknack type of things that seemed very random and thoughtless. 

I’m a very adventurous person. I like to go out do things have experiences. I’ve mentioned several things I’ve wanted to do through the year or sent them to him. I’ve mentioned to save them in a folder to remember them but he when I asked if he saves them he responds with “I never think about it” I just left it all be because I don’t feel like it was worth an argument. But it’s been bothering me all week. I’m feeling under valued and not important. 

So. Am I being ungrateful? Or is it rational for me to be disappointed?

One thing I’ve always found challenging is the guesswork that often goes into site selection or determining whether a business will succeed in a specific area. I’ve had success in the past using isochrones (e.g., drive-time radii, population density models) to calculate optimal site locations, but I’m looking to take it to the next level.

Here’s what I’m trying to do:

Reverse-engineer market viability by defining the demographic, economic, and competitive thresholds a business needs to thrive. For example, a Brazilian steakhouse might require 150,000 residents within 30 miles earning a median income of $70,000+. Or, a boutique coffee shop might need 25,000 white collar laborers aged 25–45 working within a 10-mile radius with a certain disposable income level. I want to use population and market data to calculate opportunities in underserved areas where businesses like these don’t currently exist but are quantifiably viable.

My goal is to let the numbers do the heavy lifting so that I can invest in and launch businesses with near-zero risk. I’m exploring GIS tools, economic data platforms, large-scale web scraping, and predictive modeling, but I’m curious if anyone here has had success with a similar approach.",1,1734119844.0,Entrepreneurship,1,1.0,False

My husband (28m) and I got married earlier this year. We dated for 3 years before that. Ever since we've gotten married, he has stopped buying me flowers, cooking for me, buying me gifts or making any effort with me. I have been spending the last few months begging for dates and time together. 
I keep making attempts to connect and it keeps getting shot down. After pushing back a few times, he finally gives in and goes out to a restaurant with me. I was completely delusional to see things as they are and just thought he didn't know I wanted these things. I rarely questioned why he didn't want them in the first place.
We've had terrible fights over the last few months. I have trashed our apartment, screamed at the top of my voice, threatened to kill myself and spent several days not talking to him.
Today, he told me that he doesn't want to do anything with me. He's not interested in going out, going on trips, watching movies, or even talk to me. All he wants is to work, watch anime, watch the same 4 shows and order from the same 3 restaurants. 
He would do what I ask of him every now and then to keep me in his life. I asked what he wanted me for and he said he likes the warmth I bring (?!). He also said he enjoys the things I make him do but it will never be his idea.
I have gone through the last few months feeling unloved. He would let his parents treat me terribly. He has no hobbies, no friends and no life outside of work. I have never heard of a more boring person.
I have to pester him to do chores and to do things for me. Whenever he has a choice, he will always choose to do nothing/ say nothing. He is highly avoidant. He goes to therapy whenever we have a big fight.
I'm so scared to leave. My family will abandon me. I can't believe how much of an idiot I have been.

THINGS HE HAS DONE THAT HAVE BROKEN MY HEART
~ I have asked him to buy me coffee everyday for the last 4 days to see if he will do it. He didn't.
~ I suffer from plantar fascitis and he has never even googled it
~ My last birthday was 4 days before our wedding and he didn't buy me a gift or take me out. He wasn't busy with prep. He fell asleep without setting an alarm before our planned lunch.
~ I mentioned that I wanted to go to a concert and he said the tickets were sold out. They were not.
~ His family visited unannounced and he didn't say anything 
~ He used to cook for me all the time and he hasn't made 1 meal for me in the last 6 months
~ We go weeks without sex and he doesn't bring it up

I know I can't live with him and I'm heartbroken. I have accepted the crumbs he's left me for so long and not realised how much I'm suffering. I'm so scared.",1,1734119823.0,Marriage,3,0.67,False

-Female senior (18 yr old) in highschool

-I just moved to a new city and am currently struggling to fit in, I want to talk to people but can't because everyone's with their own cliques and groups. I often feel left out, due to me not knowing how to properly communicate with them. But still I wish I was able to have more friends.

-I talk with my family perfectly fine and I'm the most extroverted one. But when it comes to school, I'm very shy. No matter how hard I try to make friends, people don't click in with me. I'm passionate about gaming and art and I feel like there's not a lot of girls who are interested in the same stuff. I just wish I could fit in.

-In contrast to me now, back in my previous school, I was very social, I loved talking to others and I felt included, mainly because I lived there for my whole life so I am more familiar with the people there. I even talk to my best friends even though we're separated every single day to see how they are doing.

-I generally do well in school, but I'm super lazy and lethargic and I often play games (yes I am a nerd) at school because I cannot focus for the sake of God.

-I gained an interest in mbti during the covid pandemic, and I mistyped myself starting from this order: INTJ>ENTP>ISTP>INTP



FUN FACTS ABOUT ME:

-I play a lot of video games, mainly FPS, but also RPGs too

-I love kpop, and I myself am a Korean

-I am talented at art, I've been drawing ever since I was 4

-I loooove ducks, like I literally have a giant duck plushie on my bed

-Winter is my favorite season

-Cat person

-I love baby blue aesthetics, sky blue is my favorite color

-I failed my driver's license test (embarrassing lol)

-Single; never dated before and will never

-Tea>>>Coffee

-Dislikes spicy food (I CAN'T EAT KIMCHI, BUT MY PARENTS KEEP FORCING ME TO)

I've walked dogs, led pilates sessions, delivered food, and written essays, but my favorite part-time job used to be teaching art. I've always had a talent for photorealism which I'd never fully explored due to low demand and high production costs. Luckily, there are just enough people in my area interested in the style for my local art gallery to host a class. They pay me decently to teach two sessions a week, Monday and Thursday nights.



Five months ago, a woman named Daisy joined the class, and I was instantly taken with her for two reasons. The first was that she was around my age while the vast majority of my students were senior citizens. The second was that I thought she resembled her namesake; she had blonde hair and always wore a white coat that reminded me of petals. I remember wanting to be her friend, but also having a hard time reading her. She was extremely attentive, sometimes to the point of being unnerving. Whereas most of my pupils were elderly women who spent the whole class chatting with each other, Daisy sat front and center and stared at me every week, all class long. I was grateful that someone was actually watching my demonstrations, but the weight of her attention was so heavy that it sometimes felt like someone stepping on my chest. 



Another odd thing about Daisy was that while she was an excellent student, she had no interest in the weekly props. She followed my technical advice to a T, but she never drew or painted the flowers, wax fruit, or household items that I had chosen for each session. Instead, Daisy only ever painted men. Though a little odd, I didn't really mind—it wasn't as if the class had grades, and I was a big fan of portraiture myself. Daisy's first finished piece featured the bust of a man with olive skin, wavy brown hair, and brown eyes. It was pretty damn bad, which was great news for me, because it meant I actually had practical advice to offer her. 



A few weeks before I met Daisy, I noticed a new employee at the corner store near my apartment. My city is quite large, but I know my part of it well, so I suspected that the employee had recently moved here. Since it wasn't busy inside the store, I had a brief chat with him while I checked out. He was indeed a recent transplant, and he seemed shy but also very sweet. He never formally introduced himself, but his nametag read ""Anthony."" 



I would continue to see Anthony every week, sometimes even more frequently. Though our conversations were brief, I really liked the small pieces of himself that he revealed to me, and he was quite handsome as well. After about a month, I asked Anthony to grab dinner with me after his shift, and though tentative, he accepted. 



The evening was a success—we hit it off, Anthony lowered his guard a bit, and though I wasn't exactly sure if he shared the same romantic feelings that I did, I realized I would also be happy to have him as a friend. Although I liked him a lot, Anthony must've been the most private person I'd ever met. By the end of the date, I didn't know his last name, where he lived, or even his phone number. We did, however, set up another meeting for the following week, and I knew where to find him anyway. 



As the weeks passed, I found myself growing closer with both newcomers. Daisy was improving fast, and her portraits were starting to resemble actual humans more so than anime characters. After two months or so, her paintings were detailed enough that I realized something: Daisy wasn't just painting men, she was painting one specific man, over and over and over. When I realized this, I caught her after class one day and asked who the man was, figuring it was a character or celebrity.  



At first, she laughed, saying something like ""I was wondering when you'd ask!"", but her expression soon turned sombre, and she gave me an explanation that I hadn't been expecting. Apparently, Daisy was painting her late husband, Luca. The two had married young, but as Daisy explained, she had known him all her life, so it seemed like the natural thing to do. She said that he'd left her years ago, but she didn't mention the cause of death. 



""He hated photos,"" she said. ""He hardly ever let me take any. I think back on the years after I lost him, and I feel like there are all of these holes. All of these gaps in my memory where he should have been. When I paint him, I'm repairing those moments. I'm putting him where he should have been.""     



Moved by her story, I assured her that I would do everything I could to help her develop as an artist. I couldn't imagine being a widow at our age. Wanting to support her however I could, I offered that she stay after class if she ever needed to talk or wanted to use the classroom supplies. She was grateful. 



As the days got colder and shorter, I spent more and more time with Anthony. I learned a lot about his interests and views, and every new detail made me like him even more. He seemed to like me as well, but he remained emotionally distant. For some reason, I got the sense that he distrusted me, which was strange given that I'd been so open with him. 



While I got closer with Anthony, I also spent more time with Daisy, who would often stay late at the gallery to paint. She was undoubtedly my best student. Her paintings were quickly getting more realistic and complex. She painted candid, domestic scenes of her late husband—Luca taking a nap on the couch, Luca walking down the sidewalk with a coffee in his hand, Luca examining a painting in an art gallery. I asked why she didn't paint herself into any of her works, and she explained that the scenes were meant to be Luca through her eyes. She was in every painting, but as the viewer, not as a subject. 



I loved her paintings. She had a real talent for composition, and I was pleased by how she utilized my advice on color and shape. However, the more pieces Daisy completed, the more familiar her muse became to me. I'm not sure how it took me so long to notice, but after several months of teaching Daisy, I realized how much Anthony resembled Luca. Anthony, though handsome, is a pretty typical looking Italian-American guy. I'm not calling him average or uninteresting to look at, it's just that he doesn't have very unique facial features. As a result, I didn't even realize the similarities until Daisy was skilled enough to consistently incorporate tiny details into her paintings of Luca. 



The thing that tipped me off was a portrait of Luca laughing, in which I could clearly see his slightly crooked bottom teeth. I had noticed the exact same feature when Anthony laughed. I mentioned this to Daisy, saying that her muse bore an uncanny resemblance to a friend of mine. I expected her to find this mildly interesting and then move on, but instead, she stiffened. She asked me something so strange that I remember her exact words: 



""Does your friend have a hole in his head?"" 



Taken aback, I shook my head. 



""That's how he died, you know. Shot between the eyes like a dog."" After that morbid comment, Daisy asked me a few questions about my friend, such as where we'd met. After the impromptu questioning, she seemed to calm down a bit. Before she left for the night, she took a hold of my hand and stared right into my soul with those intense, lucid eyes of hers. 



""I like you. You've been good to me,"" she said. ""Please take care of yourself, alright?"" 



I didn't know how to respond to that. Daisy left shortly after, but our conversation haunted me for the next several days. There was something strange about Anthony, stranger than a man who simply took his privacy seriously. The fact that I still didn't know his last name after months of seeing him was just bizarre, and after my talk with Daisy, my imagination started spinning up all kinds of conspiracy theories. What if Anthony *was* Luca? What if he'd faked his death? But what reason could he have to do so? Maybe he ran away to be with a mistress, but if that were the case then why was he seeing me? I couldn't help but fixate on the situation, and it must have driven me to paranoia; after that conversation with Daisy, when I was in public, I sometimes got the sense that I was being watched. 



It was irrational, deep down I knew, but about a month ago, I stood Anthony up. If he had given me any way to contact him, I would've given him the courtesy of letting him know, but seeing as he clearly didn't trust me, I wasn't able to afford him that luxury. I also temporarily started going to another store for my groceries. I wasn't about to ghost him forever—I just needed a week or two to get my thoughts in order and figure out how to confront him about his secrecy. 



It was during this break that Daisy completed her best piece. The composition and tone were very different from her usual work; instead of a bright, happy scene, she had painted Luca in the middle of a dark, cluttered bedroom. She'd placed him right in the center of the canvas, standing up straight and looking directly at the viewer. She had perfectly captured this eerie mix of fear and surprise on his face. It was honestly an unnerving piece, but it was also really damn good. I had no clue what it was supposed to represent or why she'd drawn her beloved husband in such a way, but I somehow felt that it would be inappropriate to ask, especially if she hadn't meant for the painting to be creepy. 



On the day she finished the piece, Daisy gave me a hug and thanked me for all I'd done for her. I didn't think I'd really done anything, but she said I'd helped her ""feel whole again"", and I was glad to have done so. Before she left, I told her I was looking forward to her next painting, but after the completion of her *magnus opus*, Daisy stopped coming to class. At first I thought it was a fluke, but it soon became clear that for whatever reason, she would not be returning. I didn't realize how much I'd grown to enjoy her company until I'd lost it. When I looked out at my students and I couldn't find those blonde curls and that pristine white coat, I felt like there was a little hole in my heart. I wondered why she'd left me so abruptly, and if, God forbid, it had anything to do with my other mysterious friend. 



Two weeks ago, I sat alone in the gallery classroom on a rainy night. For the first time in a while, I was working on a painting of my own—a portrait of Daisy. I drew it from my perspective at the front of the room, looking out across the desks. My star student was front and center, staring at me as she always did with her big eyes and slight smile. I must've been doing something wrong, because something in the expression I painted was off. I had inadvertently made her look sinister, like she was plotting my demise more so than she was appreciating my demonstration. I decided to take a break, sitting back from the canvas to figure out where I'd messed up, when I noticed someone standing in the doorway to the classroom. I jumped to my feet in surprise when I recognized the figure. 



Luca—I mean, Anthony, was watching me quietly from the hall. I hadn't seen him in weeks, and I had never told him where I worked. When he saw me stand, he took a few steps into the room. 



""Please just give me a chance to explain. I only came here to talk,"" he assured me, but his words did nothing to lessen my panic. There was no one else in the building; I was all alone with a man who I had begun to suspect had something to do with Daisy's disappearance. As he talked, he slowly made his way closer, cornering me.



""I haven't been honest with you,"" he said. ""There's a reason I had to move here, the same reason I had to protect my identity. I didn't want to lie to you, I swear, but I didn't want to scare you or put you in danger. If I told you the truth right away, something … bad could've happened to you."" 



In the context of the moment, that sure sounded like a threat. I backed up, curious but still alarmed. ""Your name's not really Anthony, is it?"" 



He opened his mouth to respond, but just then, his eyes fell on my half-finished painting. After studying it in silence for a few seconds, he gasped. When he looked up at me, his expression was that of a man betrayed. There was a mix of shock and fear in his eyes that I'd seen before. 



""Oh my God …"" he whispered, and then, with no explanation, he turned around and hurried out of the room. 



That was the last time I ever spoke to him. I had no means of contacting him, and though I kept my eyes peeled for his face every time I went into public, he seemed to have disappeared entirely. I had been certain I'd never see him again until last night, when I saw a recent local news article with a very familiar face beneath the headline: *Man found shot to death in his bedroom.* ",3,1734119501.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

For over two decades, this event has been one of the most whispered-about tales in military circles. I’ve heard it discussed late at night on base, murmured over beers by soldiers who swore they knew someone who was there. Most would dismiss it as a tall tale, but for those of us who were involved—or close enough to the aftermath—this wasn’t some campfire story. It was real.

The first time I heard it resurface publicly, I was stunned. A leak on a shadowy corner of the web mentioned the “Kandahar Giant,” and I nearly dropped my coffee. The post detailed things only someone with clearance would know. The body size, the engagement details, the aftermath—it was all there, almost word-for-word as I remember it being debriefed to us. It confirmed what I’d known all along: this wasn’t some fabrication. And now, I feel compelled to set the record straight.

It happened in the summer of 2002. I was part of a small squad tasked with searching for a missing patrol in the mountains of Kandahar, Afghanistan. The unit had gone radio silent after a distress call, and command feared the worst. We were dropped at the base of a jagged, desolate range—a place that felt like stepping into another world. The locals avoided the area, and one of our interpreters mentioned strange stories of “giants” living deep in the caves. We brushed it off as folklore, but looking back, maybe we should’ve listened.

As we moved through the craggy terrain, the air grew heavy. Something was off, and we all felt it. Eventually, we stumbled upon the remains of the missing patrol. The scene was… gruesome. Their bodies were torn apart, their gear shredded like paper. Whatever had done this wasn’t human.

Before we could even process what we were seeing, it appeared. A figure emerged from the mouth of a cave, and every instinct in my body screamed to run. This thing was massive—easily 12 feet tall, with fiery red hair, leathery skin, and six fingers on each hand. It carried a spear that looked like it belonged in a museum, but it wasn’t some ancient artifact. It was a weapon, and it knew how to use it.

The engagement was chaos. We opened fire immediately, but it moved faster than anything that size should. I remember the sound of its roar, this deep, guttural noise that shook me to my core. Eventually, sustained fire brought it down, but even as it fell, it fought back with terrifying strength. When it finally went still, we all just stood there, stunned and shaken.

We radioed for evac, and that’s when things got even stranger. Within hours, a special ops team arrived, complete with scientists and a massive transport chopper. They loaded the body onto the aircraft and debriefed us in a way that made it clear: we were never to speak of this. “National security,” they said.

For years, I stayed silent. It wasn’t just fear of the consequences—it was the knowledge that no one would believe me. But this story spread, as stories like this always do. It became legend among soldiers, the kind of tale you hear over and over with just enough consistency to give you pause.

Now, with the leak, the truth is out. People are finally connecting the dots, and I feel a strange sense of relief. This isn’t just a story about a giant in the mountains. It’s about what else the world might be hiding, the things we aren’t supposed to know.

So, take this as you will. Call it a hoax, call me crazy. But if you’ve ever served, if you’ve ever heard the whispers late at night about “that thing in Kandahar,” then you already know the truth. Sometimes, the stories are real.",2,1734119441.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1hdkkia,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hdkkia,Confused about high HRV,"I (22F) have what seems to be a high hrv, averaging 135. The other day I got a notification from whoop saying I’m in the top 10% of my demographic. I also have low restorative sleep, averaging 20-30% when, to my understanding, it should be between 35-50% to be sufficient. I am hitting level 2+ stress early on in sleep. I get a lot of sleep, so quantity isn’t something I’m worried about, though I sometimes feel like I’m just flipping a coin on how energized I’ll be through the day. 
I know high hrv is supposed to be a good thing, but honestly I’m confused as to why I would have such a high one. I don’t limit screen time before bed. I drink my coffee in the afternoon. I have mental and physical health issues (both of which exercise does help). I am a university student at a challenging school entering finals and working on grad school applications. I am 5’3 and 135-140 lbs, so a little overweight. I’ve only started doing cardio and strength straining regularly in the last 4 weeks or so. I’m definitely not an elite athlete! I have a low resting hr too, including throughout the day, and low blood pressure (low enough that doctors have commented and had to redo readings but not low enough to be a diagnosed issue). I’ve begun working out regularly but I still don’t know how to balance pushing too hard and not pushing hard enough. Two weeks ago, I couldn’t start a slow jog without almost instantly hitting zone 5. Now I can run a 12.5 min mile and stay in zone 4. But then, two days ago, I had a solid recovery score (78%), went for my run, and afterwards found I spent 5 consecutive minutes in zone 5. I have a dedicated warm up and a dedicated cool down. 
I am quite confused by all of this information together, as it doesn’t seem very straightforward. I don’t know if it is more likely a weird body thing or a wrong whoop thing. I don’t know if it’s a talk to my doctor thing or a leave it be and it’ll work itself out thing.
The final straw that led me to post was today, waking up after terrible sleep, severe pain (chronic pelvic pain), barely being able to go to sleep in the first place because of terrible back pain, to a 92% recovery and a 142 hrv. 
I don’t understand what’s happening! Please let me know if any additional images are helpful.

Ever had a hot drink turn cold before you finish it? I've been there too. That's why I was excited to try out the Nextmug. It's a smart mug that keeps your drinks at the perfect temperature.

I've been using the Nextmug for a while now, and I'm impressed. It lets you pick how hot you want your drink - warm, hot, or piping. The mug keeps it at that temp for hours. It's super easy to use - just press a button to set it up. No need for an app or anything fancy.

The Nextmug looks good too. It has a nice ceramic finish on the outside, but it's tough stainless steel inside. It feels great to hold. The lid helps keep your drink hot and stops spills. I like that it shows the battery life and temp with LED lights.

One thing to note - the battery doesn't last all day. But it comes with a charging coaster, so you can keep it powered up at your desk.

# Bottom Line

If you love hot drinks and hate when they get cold, the Nextmug is great. It's easy to use and keeps your drink just how you like it.



# Overview of Nextmug – Temperature-Controlled, Self-Heating Coffee Mug

I recently tried the Nextmug and was impressed by its smart features. This self-heating mug keeps drinks at the perfect temperature for hours. I could choose between warm (130°F), hot (140°F), or piping (150°F) with a simple button press. No app needed - it's easy to use right out of the box.

The Nextmug has a sleek ceramic finish over a steel body. It feels nice to hold and looks good on my desk. The battery lasts a while, and LED lights show the charge level and current temp.

I like that it comes with a spill-resistant lid and charging coaster. The 14 oz size is just right for my morning coffee. While the battery life could be longer, it's still great for keeping drinks hot during my workday.

It's a bit pricey, but I think it's worth it for coffee lovers who hate lukewarm drinks. The Nextmug adds a nice touch to my daily routine.

# Optimal Temperature Control

I was impressed by this mug's ability to keep my coffee at just the right heat. It has three settings: Warm (130°F), Hot (140°F), and Piping (150°F). I could easily pick my preferred temperature with one button. The LED lights showed me the battery life and current temp. I liked that I didn't need an app to use it. The mug kept my drink hot for hours, which was great for my long work sessions. While the battery life could be longer, it still lasted through most of my day. The charging coaster was handy for topping up the battery when needed. Overall, this mug delivered on its promise of optimal temperature control for my hot drinks.

# Smart Mug Technology

I was impressed by the high-tech features packed into this mug. The built-in heating system lets me pick from three temperature settings: Warm (130°F), Hot (140°F), or Piping (150°F). I found the LED display handy for checking the battery life and current temperature at a glance. The mug keeps my coffee hot for hours, which is great when I'm busy working. I like that it's simple to use with just one button to control everything - no fiddling with apps required. The charging coaster is a nice touch too. While the tech is cool, the battery does add some weight to the mug. Still, I think the temperature control is worth it for enjoying hot drinks throughout the day.

# User-Friendly Interface

The interface on this mug is super simple to use. I love that I can control everything with just one button on the mug itself. No need to mess with apps or complicated settings. I just press the button to turn it on and cycle through the three temperature options. The LED lights are handy too. They show me the battery life and current temperature at a glance. I found it really easy to set my ideal temp in seconds. The ceramic finish feels nice to hold, and the handle is comfy in my hand. While I wish the battery lasted a bit longer, overall it's pretty straightforward to use and keep my drinks hot.

# Design and Durability

I was impressed by the Nextmug's sleek look and sturdy build. The ceramic matte finish feels nice in my hands, and the stainless steel body gives it a solid weight. I found the handle comfortable to grip. The mug's shape is practical yet stylish. It fits well in my car's cupholder.

The lid does a good job keeping spills at bay. I knocked it over once, and barely a drop escaped. After a few weeks of daily use, I haven't noticed any scratches or wear. The charging coaster is compact and blends in on my desk.

One small gripe - the mug is a bit heavy when full. But that's a fair trade-off for its durability. Overall, the Nextmug seems built to last through many hot drinks.

# Gift-Worthy Investment

I think this mug makes a great gift. It's perfect for coffee lovers who want their drinks to stay hot. The sleek design looks nice and feels good to hold. I've given it to friends and family, and they all loved it. It's especially good for people who work from home or have busy schedules. The price is a bit high, but the quality makes it worth it. Plus, it's a unique gift that stands out from typical presents. Just be aware that the battery life could be better. Overall, I'd say it's a thoughtful gift that most people would enjoy using daily.

# Pros and Cons

I've been using this smart mug for a while now, and it's changed my coffee-drinking experience. Let's break down what I like and don't like about the Nextmug.

# Pros

* Perfect temperature control: I can choose from three heat settings to keep my drink just right.
* Easy to use: The simple button controls make it a breeze to set my ideal temperature.
* Elegant design: The mug looks great and feels good in my hand.
* Useful features: I love the LED display that shows battery life and current temperature.
* Versatile: It works well for coffee, tea, or any hot drink I want to enjoy.
* Thoughtful accessories: The spill-resistant lid and charging coaster are nice touches.

# Cons

* Battery life: I wish it lasted longer before needing a recharge.
* Price: It costs more than a regular mug, which might not fit everyone's budget.
* Size: At 14 oz, it might be too small for some big coffee drinkers.
* Charging time: It takes a while to fully charge the mug.
* Weight: It's a bit heavier than a standard ceramic mug.

I've found the Nextmug to be a game-changer for my daily coffee routine. The ability to keep my drink at the perfect temperature for hours is amazing. I don't have to rush through my coffee or deal with it getting cold anymore. The mug's sleek design fits in well at home and at the office.

On the flip side, I do need to remember to charge it regularly, and I sometimes wish it held a bit more coffee. But for me, the pros outweigh the cons. It's a solid choice for anyone who loves their hot drinks to stay at just the right temperature.

# Customer Reviews

I've checked out the Nextmug and it's getting pretty good feedback from buyers. Most people seem happy with how well it keeps their coffee hot. The mug gets an average rating of 4.2 stars from over 3,500 reviews.

Users like that it looks like a normal mug but has the power to keep drinks warm. Many say it's easy to use and love not having to reheat their coffee. The battery life could be better though - some wish it lasted longer.

A few folks compared it to other smart mugs. They felt the Nextmug held up well against pricier options. Not everyone was thrilled with the charging base. A couple people had issues with the charger plug or found the instructions unclear.

Overall, most buyers are glad they got the Nextmug. It seems to do a good job keeping drinks at the right temp for coffee lovers.

# Conclusion

I've really enjoyed using this smart mug. It keeps my coffee at the perfect temperature for hours, which is a game-changer for busy mornings. The sleek black design looks great on my desk. While the battery life could be longer, it's still very useful. The easy-to-use charging base is a nice touch. I think it's worth the price for coffee lovers who hate cold cups. The Nextmug isn't perfect, but it's a solid choice if you want to enjoy hot drinks without rushed sipping or constant reheating.",1,1734118788.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

I'm having quite hard time keeping my cadence up for this faaaaast moving, quick-changing and extremely impersonal world, so therefore I've realized that apps are not my thing.. I can actually explain more about myself here. So yeah, let's give this another chance :))

I'd say I'm a funny, energetic, sarcastic, and yet chill, calm, and sometimes depressive type of guy (see. winter sadness lol ). I care about my looks, I know what I want from life, partner, work... I'm quite confident I'd say as much as one can be.. I have my matters in order. I know this sounds very disciplined and rigid but I have sooo much leeway for anything and everything.

I like to spend my time with loads of stuff like having a pint with friends every now and then, going to the gym 3 times a week but no abs \*cries and proceeds eating cookies\* , playing games (currenly playing POE 2 but also a fan of BF series), watching movies/series (drama,sci-fi,comedy you name it I love all and I'm a movie buff I'd say :D ) and I love animals so ask me anything about WWII and sharks ! haha, also like to  play guitar, reading books, lying down on the rug watching the ceiling while listening to Pink Floyd... Idk there's loads of stuff :D

I enjoy deep chats quite a lot, philosophy, and endless banter especially no-holds-barred type of banters are fun... honestly any no-holds convo can turn into something funny :lol :D

I'd say I'm quite caring, protective, solution-oriented, open to communicate, and quite straightforward guy... but as you might've guessed already those just don't come from day one... feelings are feelings because we can't control them, right?  
Maybe we can walk in the parks holding hands talking about the movie we watched yesterday and about the characters? We can read poems to each other and maybe learn different things every other day and share them? We can prank each other, come up with weird jokes to see others reaction :D... all those lovely stuff... live in a wee village outskirts of a big bustling city but not in it and have late-night drives together? We can go for an ice cream at 3 am and settle for a terrible garage coffee LOL...

What I'm looking for?

I'd say someone who has her life in somewhat order, who's in touch with her emotions, who's honest or should I say blunt (in a nice way :D), who's loyal, and who's curious about things in life... who knows what she wants, someone who's giving, caring and good at communication. we don't want to play guess games right ?

I'd say I'm an ambivert so I like going out for gigs, stand-ups, pints with peeps, but also need my alone time and indoors time so I love to have a cozy nights in so would prefer someone who'd be okay with this kind of cadence. But I should say I'm more leaning into spending time at home.

Things I think could be deal-breaker for some people:  
\- I'm Atheist. But I do respect religions as long as the respect is mutual and it's not your total personality.  
\- Got 4 tattoos.  
\- I'm Turkish originally. Apparently the least sophisticated thing about me is quite important for some.. so if you care about it there you go :))

Other stuff:

Maxwell’s Journal

The big ship has sunk. There were almost 100 people on board. Several of them have washed ashore here, and I’m sure more cover the shoreline of the local coast. The head priest has been running funerals all afternoon, and into the night.

It was a huge blow for all of us to see the captain’s body, as we had spent so much time with him onboard the ship. Most of the other bodies were identifiable by either face, or clothing worn. Bri did most of the work on that front.

On one hand I am glad we stayed behind. On the other, I am devastated that we weren’t there to help save the ship. Bri may be right that I have a bit of a hero complex after all.

I hope we can find a survivor. I want to know what happened. The ship was nearly unsinkable. What could have sank the damn thing?

46^(th) of Anael

The prototype was finished late tonight, and we all went home for a good night’s sleep. Most of my team are gods of one sort or another, and it amuses me that they still have to sleep. Albeit some sleep more than others. Tomorrow we will be testing the prototype on randomly summoned elementals.

Maxwell’s Journal

Today was tough. Lots of tests, lots of “feelings” around how much time the tests were taking. We were all frustrated by the time things are taking. I think Lemon had another good idea; we will be trying it in the morning.

\-

Maxwell awoke from a deep sleep, and crawled from the warm covers. The chilly morning air woke him all the way up, and he hurriedly dressed and went to the kitchen for coffee and breakfast.

Food and drink taken care of, he jogged to the church and entered the great library. Entering the conference room turned magical laboratory, he smelled the wonderful aroma of coffee once again.

“Glad someone already brewed some.” Max said, walking to the table where the brewing machine sat next to a tray of morning pastries. He poured himself a mug of the dark liquid, and grabbed a pastry at random, then turned to survey the room.

Half asleep with a thimble of coffee in hand, Lemon sat cross-legged on the main table mumbling to himself. Once he became aware of Max’s attention, he took a large swallow of the brew and yawned. “I’m glad you introduced me to this stuff.” He waived at the coffee machine. “It really helps in the mornings.”

“It truly is the nectar of the…morning, isn’t it?” Max responded, a slight smile playing across his lips. “Why are you here so early?”

“I never actually left last night. I was worried about a couple of the calculations, and ended up re-running them until I passed out.” The small small god answered, then yawned deeply. “At least I didn’t come up with a different result.”

The pair continued to chat while the rest of the crew slowly filed in.

When everyone had a coffee and snack, but before they could become sidetracked by other conversations, Max started the meeting, “I’m glad everyone could make it today!”

“Like we were going to miss the test.” Someone in the back said a bit too loud.

“That’s the kind of enthusiasm that I like to hear!” Max smiled. “The plan for today, unless anyone has an actual objection, it to start with a basic function test. After that is complete, we break for lunch. NOT a liquid lunch this time.”

Several people laughed.

“After lunch, we start with the half variants. If there is time afterwards, we will start work on the “Other” category of elementals that don’t match the basic types.” Max paused for a moment. “Any questions?”

“What is the flight speed of an—Ouch!” A voice from the back started, only to be shut down by an elbow from a neighbor.

“Which elemental system are we using? The four, five or six?” Lemon asked from the table.

“We will start with the four system, Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. Then add Metal and Wood from the Five Elements.” Max replied. “If we have time before lunch, we will add Darkness and Light, not that I’ve ever seen either, or know how to summon an elemental of either type.” He looked around the group, “Do any of you know how to summon one?” No one replied.

Max frowned, “In that case, we will ignore them. We will also ignore “Good” and “Evil” as neither have a summonable form. And no, angels and demons don’t count.” A hand in the back that had started to raise, dropped. “Any other questions? No? Good. Let’s go.”

The tests of the six elementals went smoothly, even if it took around an hour for each test, with multiple summons by multiple people, at different locations and at the same and different times.

Lunch was had, and work was resumed. Activating and dialing in the “half and half” or “mixed” elementals took much longer, and was put off for the next day part way through the first test: Earth.

Lemon sighed, “There are 30 combinations to go through. At an hour each, that’s 30 hours for a full test.”

Max shrugged, “What else can we do?”

“We summon 30 elementals at the same time, and seek them out with the rod.” Lemon stretched. “It isn’t a thorough as a full test, but it makes sure it works, and time is of the essence.”

“As long as the summoner isn’t a jerk, it should only take a couple of hours to complete.” Max cocked his head to the left, thinking. “I think we can do that. It’s not like we won’t be doing the same thing when we go looking for the one in Dragon.”

New Yorkers are no strangers to the power of first impressions, and having a sparkling smile is an essential part of making those moments count.

If you’re in NYC, look no further than **The Beam Bar**, where advanced treatments and personalized care come together to create smiles that shine.

# Why Choose Professional Teeth Whitening?

Teeth whitening is a cosmetic treatment designed to remove stains caused by lifestyle habits, diet, or aging.

3. **Safe and Comfortable Procedures**
   * Safety is a priority at **The Beam Bar**. We use protective measures to shield your gums and enamel, ensuring a pain-free experience with minimal sensitivity.

4. **Post-Treatment Care**

# Why Not DIY?

At-home teeth whitening kits might seem like a convenient and cost-effective choice, but they come with risks:

With **The Beam Bar**, you eliminate these concerns, ensuring a brighter, healthier smile every time.

1hdjuso,https://i.redd.it/y9w0vsa41o6e1.jpeg,3 month check in - take two,"Yesterday I posted my 3 month check in charts. Well, I hadn't finished my coffee and forgot to add my story. So here goes, along with some comparison pictures. 


I’m hitting the 3-month mark in my weight loss journey and feeling so proud of the progress I’ve made. Here's a breakdown of where I’m at:

•	SW: 253 lbs

•	CW: 223 lbs

•	GW: 154 lbs

•	Height: 5'5""

•	Medication: Tirzepatide compound

✨ Food
I’m in the ""eat what I want in moderation"" camp, but honestly, I’ve only been craving clean, wholesome foods! Here's what my meals look like:

•	Breakfast: Smoothie with Premier Protein powder, banana, collagen, and Miralax.

•	Lunch: Cottage cheese or Triple Zero yogurt with protein granola.

•	Snack: Cheese and nuts.

•	Dinner: A large serving of lean protein + veggies.

•	Evening: If I’m hungry, I’ll grab a Premier Protein shake.

Big wins:

•	Gave up Dr. Pepper on day 1 after drinking it for 50 years (5–6 cans a day! 😲).

•	Quit fast food, which was a daily habit for me.

✨ Drink
I drink half a cup of coffee in the morning with creamer and raw sugar, though I usually only get a sip or two before nausea kicks in. The rest of the day, I stay hydrated by filling my Stanley four times a day with water and Propel packets (1 packet per 40 oz). I also treat myself to one margarita a week (down from 2–3 a week, with 2 at a time!).

✨ Exercise
Just started weight training last week! I’ve gone twice so far, focusing on legs and abs since I’m prepping for rotator cuff surgery in a week.

✨ Dosing Regimen
I dose every 5–7 days based on food noise and appetite suppression. If needed, I increase my dosage by 0.5–1.0 mg depending on how I’m feeling.

✨ Side Effects
I’ve been lucky! The only issue is constipation, but I keep it in check with Miralax in my morning smoothie and Mag07 before bed. If needed, I’ll add a Colace in the evening.

✨ NSVs:

•	Most of my clothes are too big now and look sloppy (a good problem to have!).

•	Someone finally noticed and said I look like I’ve lost weight.

•	My husband has started taking Tirzepatide too.

•	I feel in control of my eating for the first time in a long time.

Feeling proud and motivated as I keep moving forward. Thanks to this group for the support and inspiration—you all are amazing! 💪💖

For context: we have 3 kids, I get the older two ready in the morning and she gets the youngest (daycare vs school).  I get up about an hour before her to dot his while she sleeps in with our youngest.  The tasks are:

Getting them up, teeth brushing and morning constitutionals, dressed, making breakfast, lunch, school snacks, waters for school, footwear on, hair brushed, then I go take a shower make a coffee and take them for school.

Wife and youngest wake up when I’m in the shower most days.

The oldest has a field trip where he will be walking around indoors today.  We live in the northeast so they were in boots for the last couple of weeks.  I put the oldest in shoes today because of the field trip.

I’m in the shower and mention that the oldest’s  normal shoes were messed up.  Without any context she just stated: “I want him in boots today.”  Annoyed that after having spent the last hour getting the kids ready I asked “Why?”  To which she replied “the playground is going to be muddy today.”

I told her, again annoyed and somewhat sudsy, “then go put him in boots.”  She heard my annoyance and asked why I was mad at her which started the argument in earnest.

Summing it up (as this is way too long for such an absolutely stupid argument-welcome to married life people-15 years and going strong): 

I think how she approached it (saying she wanted something different after I had just spent an hour doing a task) was rude.  She says her saying what she wanted, even though she had forgotten about the field trip is fine.  She also said that she didn’t realize boots could fit in his book bag.

At her request I’m adding: I think that a non rude way to handle it would be to ask why he’s in shoes, and she thinks that asking why is rude as it implies a mistake.

So, ESH?  AITAH.  She recommended we post this and while it is such a small thing it has grown legs, as these things often do 15 years into a relationship.

One quick add on: once done with his field trip he will spend time on the playground, so packing the boots separately was a good idea.",2,1734117278.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

I (22M)met a girl (23F) on a website that is all about sex (forums, photos, videos, chatting, blogs, etc...). In her profile she said that she is looking for friends-with-benefits kind of relationship. So I texted her. After just a few messages and photos send (civil photos) both ways, she wants to meet IRL. At first I suggested to go for a coffee or walk around the city and just talk, but now she sent me a message saying that she is okay with going for a drink/party straightaway and then to her place. To me it looks like she doesnt want to ""waste time"" with just talking and hanging out.

This just feels very suspicious, that she would say this before even meeting me IRL. I sent her my photo, and she still wants to go straight to her place after, even though I am an average looking guy. I am worried that there might be hidden motives. I am worried that I will get scammed, used, recorded or something like that. How do I go about this carefully? I hope I am just overreacting.

     As a small child I was kind of nervous. Had nightmares, was scared of new foods because I thought I would vomit, I was also very active and needed lots of stimulation and supervision. That all slowed down by the time I was a teen. Through those years I rarely felt anxious. I was spontaneous and blissfully ignorant of consequences. I just didn’t care. I would sneak out, lie, party, drink, smoke, trespass, take my mom’s car to joyride, etc.(I’m not saying any of these things were good) 

     Around 18/19 I started to experience some anxiety when I would smoke weed. It wasn’t great but I just pushed through it because it was a social thing with friends and I’d be totally fine when I was sober. I just kind of ignored it because never in my wildest dreams did I think it would get worse. Until one night, I ate a single sour patch kid edible. It wasn’t even strong, maybe 25mg but I lost it. I had my first in a series of panic attacks that would turn my world upside down. I was puking, shaking, crying and wishing I could turn back the clock so I never took the damn edible. That panic attack lasted 3/4 days. I called a therapist and started seeing her but I didn’t get much out of it. My insurance ran out and I stopped seeing her. 
     Shortly after that I had another panic attack. I took a trip to the Cayman Islands (a place I had been before) with my family. I panicked for 7 days straight. I didn’t eat, I didn’t bask in the sun, I didn’t enjoy that trip at all. I just tried to stay in my hotel room and chill tf out. When we finally got back home I went to the doctor and started on Paroxetine aka Paxil. I also started seeing another therapist. I’ve been with this therapist ever since. 
     I never intended to stay on any medication for very long. I’ve had more panic attacks since then but I keep taking my meds. I’ve increased and decreased the dose, I’ve tried weaning off multiple times, but then I get my anxiety and I get “scared straight” and end up back on the meds. I quit drinking and smoking immediately after starting the meds. I even scared myself off ALL medications except my SSRI. No Tylenol, no ibuprofen, no antibiotics, NOTHING. Because I am terrified of drug interactions. I also quit all forms of caffeine. No sodas, no chocolate, no coffee or energy drinks. 
     I am very aware that my anxiety of OTC medications is irrational, I’m also aware that my fear of the minuscule amount of caffeine in chocolate is irrational. But that doesn’t stop my brain from panicking. 
     I am 25 now, it’s been 6/7 years on this journey and I want to get off the fucking train already. But I feel trapped on it. Even with the therapy, and the meds I am fucking miserable. I feel like I am missing out on my twenties. I’m a hermit now. I can’t go to bars, loud places, movie theaters, I struggle with malls and other stores as well. I’m locked in. I was always the social butterfly making friends and chatting with anyone, now I’m a shell of who I used to be. 
     I put the brave face on for my family and friends. No one knows how deep this runs. They think I’m doing better than I once was but just because I’m not actively panicking doesn’t mean I’m okay. My family truly doesn’t understand mental health issues. I don’t want to worry them or bother them. 
     I look back at old pictures of me from when I was fearless, happy, and healthy. I miss her. It feels like that was a different lifetime that I’m constantly chasing and I’m constantly reminded that she is gone.

The average monthly income is like $150-200, but grocery prices are only about 1/5 of US prices and real estate is like 1/3 of a MCOL US city. I honestly don't understand how people survive back in my country. That said, I don't understand how Americans be broke either. Most of my friends are in a lot of CC debt, live with their parents and aren't doing anything about it.   
  
I've been in the US for 8 years and it's been pretty smooth sailing, even though I believe I'm very disadvantaged compared to a citizen. I can only work limited number of hours a week, jobs are extremely hard to get and I have no family here. I can seperate my life here in two parts, college and post-college. During college, I could only work 20 hrs on campus and 40 hours in the summer. Thankfully, a scholarship covered my tuition except for $1000 and my living expenses. I was making $12000 net a year. I found some shared housing on Facebook Marketplace for $600 inclusive. Sure I ate a lot of rotisserie chicken, rice and canned veggies ($200), but along with health insurance ($150), phone bill ($30) and eating out ($100), I was still saving like $50-150 a month. I'd work full time in the summers and saved enough to buy a car for $3200 (maybe not possible anymore). Sure it was hard and sometimes I'd slip, but I never got into CC debt. I had an enjoyable time as well; I travelled with Megabus, I had a girlfriend, I bought and played on my PS4; when friends invite me, I go out and eat. 

After college, I got a $4000 take-home job; rent a 1 BR ($1200), increased my food (plus eat out) budget to like $800. I take vacations, go out, buy gifts for my girlfriend, but still have so much money to spare even with lifestyle inflation. I can realistically save/invest like 25% of my income with no problem. And I am kinda known for being bougie in my friend group; I have a $400 coffee system, $900 headphones system, nice clothes, etc, but I always buy them from deal sites like slickdeals or frugal malefashion.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Today, many people are turning to online jobs as a way to work from home. The rise of technology has made it easier for individuals to earn money without stepping outside. If you are curious about what online jobs work from home entail, consider the various benefits that come with them. These opportunities can lead to a more flexible and balanced work-life. Let us take a closer look at these advantages.

### Flexibility in Working Hours

One of the greatest benefits of online jobs is the flexibility in working hours. When you work from home, you have the freedom to choose when you want to work. This is especially useful for parents or anyone with other commitments. You can create a schedule that fits your lifestyle, allowing for better management of both personal and professional tasks.

### Reduced Commuting Time

Working from home eliminates the need for daily commutes. Many people spend hours each day stuck in traffic or crammed into public transport. By working from home, you save time and energy. Instead of commuting, you can use that time to focus on your work, get a good breakfast, or simply relax in the morning. This can lead to increased productivity and overall satisfaction with your job.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/what-is-online-jobs-work-from-home  
  
### Cost Savings

Working from home can also lead to significant cost savings. Here are some expenses you can cut down:

- **Transportation Costs:** No fuel or public transport fees.
- **Work Attire:** You can dress casually, saving on clothing expenses.
- **Meals:** No need to buy lunch or coffee every day.
- **Childcare:** You may save on daycare if you can balance work and child-rearing.

These savings can add up, improving your overall financial situation.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/what-is-online-jobs-work-from-home  
  
### Increased Productivity

Many people find that they are more productive when working from home. The distractions of an office environment can be overwhelming, with constant chatter and interruptions. At home, you can create a workspace that suits your needs. Whether that means a quiet room, or a cozy corner of your living room, you have the power to design your ideal work environment. This can lead to better focus and higher-quality work output.

### Work-Life Balance

Another key benefit is the improved work-life balance that comes with online jobs. You can spend more time with family and friends since your work is right at home. This can lead to reduced stress and a happier life overall. You can integrate work around your life rather than vice versa, adapting to the needs of your day-to-day responsibilities. Whether it’s attending to family matters or pursuing personal projects, the balance can lead to positive mental health.

This means a wider selection of job opportunities tailored to your skills and interests. Whether you are a graphic designer, writer, software developer, or customer service representative, the choices are vast. You can often find roles that fit your expertise and pay scale, which may not be available locally.

### Skill Development

Working from home can also provide chances to develop new skills. Online jobs often require you to use various software tools or platforms. As you navigate through tasks, you can pick up new abilities that enhance your resume.

Essential Skills for Succeeding in Remote Work Environments
-----------------------------------------------------------

In today’s digital age, many people are shifting towards remote work. This change brings both opportunities and challenges. To thrive in such environments, several essential skills are crucial. Understanding and developing these skills can significantly enhance your performance and job satisfaction.

### Communication Skills

Effective communication is the backbone of remote work. When working from home, you won't have the luxury of face-to-face conversations. Therefore, being able to communicate clearly through email, instant messaging, and video calls is vital. Here are some key points:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/what-is-online-jobs-work-from-home  
  
- **Clarity:** Use straightforward language to avoid misunderstandings.
- **Active Listening:** Pay attention to your colleagues to ensure you fully understand their points.
- **Regular Updates:** Keep your team informed about your progress and any challenges you face.

### Time Management Skills

One of the significant advantages of remote work is the flexibility it offers. However, this can also lead to procrastination. To succeed, you need strong time management skills:

- **Set Clear Goals:** Break your tasks down into achievable goals. This will provide you with a clear direction.
- **Prioritize Tasks:** Identify which tasks are most crucial and tackle them first.
- **Use Tools:** Consider using apps or calendars to schedule your work and keep track of deadlines.

### Self-Motivation

Working from home means that you have fewer external motivators. To stay productive, you must cultivate self-motivation:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/what-is-online-jobs-work-from-home  
  
- **Create a Dedicated Workspace:** Set up a specific area in your home that is solely for work to help you focus.
- **Establish a Routine:** Maintaining a consistent work schedule can boost productivity.
- **Reward Yourself:** Set up a system where you treat yourself after completing tasks to maintain motivation.

### Technical Proficiency

Being comfortable with technology is another critical skill for remote work. You will likely use various software and tools to accomplish your tasks:

- **Familiarize Yourself with Common Tools:** Get to know software like Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and project management tools such as Trello or Asana.
- **Stay Updated:** Technology evolves rapidly. Stay informed about new tools and updates to existing software.
- **Seek Help:** Don’t hesitate to ask colleagues for technical assistance. Collaboration is essential in remote environments.

### Adaptability

The remote work landscape can change quickly due to new projects, collaborating with various teams, or even changes in your organization. Being adaptable will help you adjust to any situation:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/what-is-online-jobs-work-from-home  
  
- **Embrace Change:** When new tools or methods are introduced, try to approach them with a positive mindset.
- **Learn Continuously:** Engage in ongoing learning to keep your skills relevant and up to date.
- **Be Open to Feedback:** Constructive criticism can help you grow. Accept it gracefully and implement changes when necessary.

### Team Collaboration

Even though remote work offers independence, teamwork remains essential. Knowing how to collaborate effectively with your colleagues is necessary for achieving common goals:

- **Participate Actively:** Engage in team meetings and discussions. Your input can be beneficial to others.
- **Build Relationships:** Take time to connect with your colleagues, as strong relationships foster teamwork.
- **Respect Differences:** Be open-minded and appreciate the different backgrounds and work styles of your team members.

Thriving in a remote work environment requires you to hone a unique set of skills. Excellent communication, time management, and the ability to self-motivate are just a few of the important abilities you need. Additionally, being proficient with technology, adaptable to change, and capable of collaborating with teammates will lead to greater success in remote work situations. Mastering these skills will not only boost your performance but also enhance your overall work experience.

### Conclusion

Embracing online jobs that allow you to work from home offers a wealth of benefits that can transform your professional life. The flexibility to create your own schedule, the comfort of working in your own space, and the opportunity to eliminate commuting are just a few of the major advantages. These perks allow for a better work-life balance, ultimately leading to higher satisfaction both personally and professionally.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/what-is-online-jobs-work-from-home  
  
To thrive in remote work environments, it's essential to cultivate specific skills that are highly valued by employers.

Distillery: J mattinly 1845

Age:NAS

Proof:118

Mash bill: Undisclosed 

Nose: almond, dark chocolate, slight scent of ethanol 

Flavor notes: very earthy with notes of leather, roasted almonds, dark chocolate and black coffee

Finish: long sharp finish with slight burn with heavy almond notes 

Cost: gifted (MSRP $125) 

Overall: I think that this was a very enjoyable pour for a very good cause. It had very earthy notes to it along with a fair amount of wood and nutty flavors. 

on the nose, you definitely get the almond scent with a decent amount of oak. There’s a few other minor notes of cinnamon and brown sugar but the main scent is definitely almond and dark chocolate

as you take the first step, you are greeted with a very roasted almond note that develops into more of a fine leather and dark roast coffee flavor as that sits on your tongue for a little bit longer, it’s developed back into a dark chocolate covered almond style of note all around it’s a very sweet note, but can definitely be a little bold for some people

The finish was long and in my opinion very sharp. You definitely tasted the ethanol a lot more on the finish than you did in the actual tasting. You feel it around your upper chest area and I felt it take every turn in my chest. The finished did come with notes of Cinnamon.

The finished didn’t bother me too much, what bothered me more is the lack of transparency with the Nashville bill and the age I checked both the website and everywhere I could on the bottle I could not find an age statement and I could not find a mash bill but overlooking those three things this is definitely a bottle I would like to buy again however this was a limited release and I am lucky enough to have gotten bottle 61 out of 250

1hdj8n5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hdj8n5/time_looped_chapter_71/,Time Looped (Chapter 71),"“Danny?” Helen was barely able to say. “I thought…” she couldn’t make herself finish the sentence. Seeing him was difficult, causing her body to freeze up, unable to determine how to react.

“You passed the tutorial.” He looked around. “Congrats. I bet this is one loop you can’t wait to end.”

Slowly, Will put his mirror fragment back in his pocket. This wasn’t what he expected would happen. In all honesty, he wasn’t certain what to expect. Daniel had never been remotely truthful, even when he had helped, but having him return to life was beyond all expectations.

“You died…” Helen managed to say. “You stopped eternity.”

“My silly Helen.” Danny shook his head with a smile. “Eternity never stops. It just moved away for a while.”

Opening his arms, the former rogue made his way to the girl. It was an expected reaction. Even Will didn’t think he’d act any different. Just as the two were about to hug, however, two daggers appeared in Daniel’s hands, which he used to stab Helen on both sides of the neck.

 

**DOUBLE JAB**

**Damage increased by 1000%**

**Fatal wound inflicted**

 

Everyone could only stare as the lifeless body of the girl dropped to the ground. The attack had been so fast that she didn’t even have the time to be surprised. Even stranger, no mass loop breaking occurred.

“Fucker.” Jace reached down to grab any material nearby to craft a weapon. Before he could, a series of throwing knives sunk into most of his arms and torso. Half a dozen conditions were afflicted—each of them ominous in its own right—before the jock fell to the ground as well.

A couple of knives were also thrown Will’s way as well, but his rogue skills helped him evade them and leap back without taking any injuries.

“Looks like you’ve improved,” Danny said. “Don’t worry, they won’t remember a thing.” He looked around. “Been a while, Alex,” he said loudly. “No need to hide. We’re old buddies, after all. For real for real.”

There was no response.

Will frantically looked about for anything he could use as a weapon. The entire encounter, not to mention the boss battle, had completely depleted him. He wasn’t only exhausted, but completely weaponless. That left only one option.

A torrent of knives burst out from Danny, as if he were made of them. From a distance, one might almost think that he was holding a firehose. No normal person would be able to hold that many, let alone throw them at such speed, and yet that was precisely what he was doing.

Mirror copies of the goofball appeared in the surrounding area, but they weren’t the target of the attack. Rather, Danny seemed intent on throwing knives at nothing in particular until all of a sudden, all the mirror copies simultaneously shattered.

“Well, shit,” Danny said, almost in disbelief. “I’d thought he’d do a lot better. Guess I was wrong.” He turned to face Will. “Only one left.”

In his mind, Will explored what he could do. With attack out of the question, fleeing was the only option. The issue with that was that he was on the edge of the area and Danny had blocked the way in. No doubt it was calculated. A rogue’s greatest strength was mobility. Unfortunately, that was the same class that Danny had been. Interesting why eternity hadn’t stepped in. In the past, it hadn’t allowed for a class duplication.

Taking the gamble, Will leaped away from the other boy. As expected, a torrent of knives flew at him. From this distance, though, evading them was easy enough.

“You can’t run,” Danny shouted from behind. “You’re only increasing your pain.”

“Yeah, right.”

“I’ll just restart the loop. You’ll keep your rewards, your permanents, and even the coins. You’ll only miss the memories of me.”

At this point, Will couldn’t trust anything that came out of Daniel’s mouth. But even if what he claimed was true, it still didn’t sound like a good deal. If losing his memories related to the former rogue was so benign, why hadn’t he mentioned it before? This was the second time that Will had been specifically targeted. Getting the mirror fragment—as beneficial as that was—had almost gotten him squished between two mirrors. Now, the “favor” he had performed had somehow brought Danny back to life.

“How did you die?” Will asked, in an effort to gain some time. “Eternity doesn’t kill.”

“Not at your level,” the other replied, proving Will’s hunch right. Being locked alone in eternity for goodness knows how long without anyone to talk to must have been more than dreadful. Now that he was back in the world, Danny was eager to chat, even if on many levels he knew that he shouldn’t. “You’ll get there soon enough. Just give it time. It’s inevitable.”

Holding his breath, Will leaped beyond the invisible barrier that marked the end of the area. Nothing stopped him from doing so. There were no warnings, no surprise messages… it was as if nothing particular had happened. Despite that, one could instantly tell the difference. All the destruction caused by the goblin hordes had been left behind. No wonder that no one had come to the assistance of the people within the area. As far as everyone else was concerned, nothing of interest had occurred. It was as if eternity had only affected a small patch of the city. Would the effects slowly spread to be noticed by others? Or would they only become aware upon entering it? Will would never find out. Sooner or later, his loop would come to an end, even without Danny’s help, and then everything would restart.

Two more knives darted a few feet from his left shoulder, causing Will to leap to the right. Danny hadn’t given up.

“Only idiots go outside their area,” Danny shouted.

“You should know.”

“I see you haven’t met the archer. If you had, you’d be pissing your pants right now.”

“Says who?” Against any apparent logic, Will stopped.

Suspecting something, Danny did as well. Fifty feet separated the two—not enough to fight, but enough for each to keep the other from escaping, as long as they had weapons.

“I’ve seen what he's capable of,” Will said. “In fact, I’m counting on it.”

“You think the archer will team up with you against me?” Danny laughed. “And I thought you were the smart one in the group.”

“No.” Will smiled. “I know he won’t.”

Out of nowhere, an arrow pierced his head.

 

**Restarting eternity.**

 

The calm chaos of a starting school day surrounded Will. After everything that had happened in the previous loop, he had almost forgotten what it was like to be surrounded by normalcy. The honking of cars, the screams of children ashamed to be taken to school by their parents, and even the weird looks he got from everyone felt more than welcome.

“Don’t block the path, weirdo,” Jess said, as she and Ely passed by.

Will gave the girl a smile, causing her to instantly look away. Part of him even wanted to strike a conversation, as if this was just another day. Before he could, he felt someone’s hand on his shoulder.

“Bro!” Alex said, grinning like a madman. “That was lit! Passing the tutorial in one go!”

“Shh.” Will hushed him, looking around.

“For real, bro?” The goofball narrowed his eyes. “No one will care. If they do, we’ll just wait till they don’t.”

The logic was sound, but still felt wrong.

“And those rewards…” Alex gesticulated. “Lit fire!”

Will reached into his pocket. The mirror fragment was still there. The bigger question was whether Daniel was within it.

Two pinging sounds filled the air as both Will’s and Alex’s phones got a message. Typically, it was the goofball who reacted first.

“It’s Hel,” he said. “She’s calling us to the moose place.”

“It’s…” Will began. “Never mind,” he gave up. “Let’s go.”

Five minutes later, as everyone was rushing to school. The four loopers were sitting comfortably at what had become their gathering coffee shop. As in every loop, the barista casually asked why they weren’t in class, and got the usual lie as a reply.

Drinks were bought, along with a lot of overpriced pastries. Will, himself, went back to his favorite chocolate mousse. Not too long ago, he had sworn to himself that he’d take a break from the stuff. The end of the tutorial had changed his mind.

“I was planning to do this tonight,” Jace said. Like everyone else, he couldn’t get over the feeling of how different everything looked. To a certain degree, that only made him nervous. “Proper celebration—beers and everything.”

“I don’t drink.” Helen gave him an annoyed look.

“Beer isn’t drinking. It’s marking a good game, and the end of the fucking tutorial.”

Alex gave him two thumbs up, while Helen just placed her mirror fragment on the table. Looking closely, everyone could see a single message right in the middle of it: **1/4**.

On a hunch, Will took out his fragment as well and placed it in front of him. Immediately, a message appeared on it, just as the one in Helen’s mirror changed to **2/4**.

“It’s not over yet,” he said.

Jace and Alex did the same. Once all the mirror fragments were on the table, the numbers disappeared, replaced by a golden message.

 

**GROUP 5 – TUTORIAL COMPLETE**

**Overall ranking: 2nd place.**

 

**Eternity zone expanded.**

**Chat functionality enabled.**

 

“Second Place?” Alex asked. “For real?”

“I wonder who got number one,” Jace said in a serious tone of voice.

Eager to learn more, Will tapped on his fragment.

 

**KEY HOLDER status removed.**

**Everyone in the party can unlock hidden mirrors.**

**(1/7)**

 

**Free Roaming**

**Use your new skills to locate new challenges.**

**(2/7)**

 

**For each challenge completed, you’ll gain a boss reward, along with anything else you collect during your run.**

**(3/7)**

 

**If you leave the loop before the challenge is over, you have to start over from the beginning. All non-permanent skills and items will be lost.**

**(4/7)**

 

“This is what’s beyond the tutorial,” Helen said.

To some degree, it seemed expected. They had defeated a boss within a small area, so now they were free to do the same in larger ones. On the positive side, it didn’t look like the new “challenges” would be forced onto them. If they wanted, they could continue with the standard school loops and not get involved. Of course, after the adrenaline rush of the boss battle, no one was willing to return to the mundane.

“Anyone remember what happened after we killed the boss?” Will asked casually.

“What’s there to remember, Stoner?” Jace looked at him.

“I was expecting a bit… more,” Will lied. It seemed that indeed, no one remembered Daniel. Maybe that was a good thing. Knowing that he was out there somewhere while also being dead sent shivers down his spine.

“For real,” Alex agreed. “Ending was oof, like most tutorials.”

“You fuckers,” Jace laughed. “Write a complaint to eternity.”

“Guys,” Helen said. “Look at the hints.”

The note of concern in her voice put an end to the banter. Quickly, everyone tapped on their mirror fragments.

 

**Hint 1**

**You can exchange coins for items at merchant locations hidden throughout the eternity zone.**

 

**Hint 2**

**Some challenges limit the number of people that can participate.**

 

**Hint 3**

**Players can fight each other freely.**

 

There it was. Nothing was capable of creating such dread as the final hint. So far, the group had experienced a lot. They had faced scores of wolves, goblins, mirror images of their own classes, not to mention an assortment of strange and strong elite monsters, and even bosses. Yet all that paled in comparison to the enemies they could expect to face from now. There was nothing stronger than a bunch of other looped people, each of which had gone through the exact same thing that Will and the others had. From this moment onwards, the loops became that much more deadly.

1hdj83y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hdj83y,"Ruta Maya Beans (organic, medium roast, Costco online)","
I’ve been trying different beans with my new machine, and ordered these from Costco based on suggestions from some people here and the espresso reddit. 

I won’t be using these until next week when the beans currently in my hopper run out. Those would be Lavazza super crema 🤢. sorry,  I know many of you like them but I’m not a fan. I’ll update this post when I start making drinks with the Ruta maya. 

Some initial first impressions and observations:

- This is Costco, so naturally it comes in a huge bag…5 lbs in this case. I plan on dividing this into portions and vacuum sealing (and potentially freezing if needed). 

- This looks like more of a medium roast to me than Lavazza, which are noticeably darker and have a slight sheen to them (though nothing like the shine and oil slick of the actual dark roast beans I tried from Costco). These are a bit lighter and have a much more matte appearance. 

- They smell great. To my nose, super crema beans always had a strong underlying burnt smell which was quite off putting for me. When I opened this bag, it was more similar to when I opened a bag of specialty beans, just pleasant.

- if the comments I’ve read about inferring the roast date are true, these are EXTREMELY fresh. Someone else mentioned they spoke to a rep giving out samples, who confirmed that the Best Buy date is exactly one year after the roast date for this brand. The date stamped here is Dec 10, which happens to be the date I placed the order (which seems a little sus.) That means these were roasted 3-4 days ago, seems optimistic to me but they do appear fresh. Would be great if anyone else can confirm how the date is used here. 

Won’t know for sure until I try them, but so far these look very promising.  I know people on here love Lavazza, and I gave them a fair shake…just never really loved the taste of the drinks I got from it. It’s possible that’s partially user error,as these machines and espresso are new to me, but I tried all sorts of settings and just couldn’t get it right. 

Anyways I’ll update this after I get to actually try them thoroughly , just thought some on here would be interested in seeing what they look like as a few people had asked",1,1734115684.0,superautomatic,3,1.0,False

Just put on tray 15/41 and I am very happy with my results so far. I have been changing them weekly, however I lost some trays so I switched them earlier on some days. I have been wearing them 21-22 hours a day.

  
Here's my Invisalign routine to keep the trays clean and maintain healthy teeth/mouth, please give me recommendations if I can improve anything!

\- Floss, brush teeth with Pronamel toothpaste, and mouthwash with Listerine TotalCare Zero.

\- I eat 2 big meals a day so I brush after every meal. If I eat 3 I just mouthwash and floss, so I do not damage my enamel.

\- I use the Polident cleanser tabs every morning while I eat breakfast and rinse.

\- I only drink water with them in. I take them out for coffee and acidic drinks and only mouthwash afterwards

  
Some thoughts:

\- They hurt a lot in the beginning, especially the rubber bands. However, after 3-4 days the pain went away and each tray change becomes progressively less painful.

\- I used to be very obsessed with tracking my wear time via TrayMinder and comparing progress pics. However, I found that just making sure they're always in except when I am eating or drinking is sufficient and makes treatment time feel quicker because I am not constantly checking on the progress.

\- No one notices that I am wearing Invisalign unless I tell them and no one says anything if they do notice. 

\- I had a lisp for the first few days, but it went away quickly.

1hdj73p,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1hdj73p/time_looped_chapter_71/,[Time Looped] - Chapter 71,"“Danny?” Helen was barely able to say. “I thought…” she couldn’t make herself finish the sentence. Seeing him was difficult, causing her body to freeze up, unable to determine how to react.

“You passed the tutorial.” He looked around. “Congrats. I bet this is one loop you can’t wait to end.”

Slowly, Will put his mirror fragment back in his pocket. This wasn’t what he expected would happen. In all honesty, he wasn’t certain what to expect. Daniel had never been remotely truthful, even when he had helped, but having him return to life was beyond all expectations.

“You died…” Helen managed to say. “You stopped eternity.”

“My silly Helen.” Danny shook his head with a smile. “Eternity never stops. It just moved away for a while.”

Opening his arms, the former rogue made his way to the girl. It was an expected reaction. Even Will didn’t think he’d act any different. Just as the two were about to hug, however, two daggers appeared in Daniel’s hands, which he used to stab Helen on both sides of the neck.

 

**DOUBLE JAB**

**Damage increased by 1000%**

**Fatal wound inflicted**

 

Everyone could only stare as the lifeless body of the girl dropped to the ground. The attack had been so fast that she didn’t even have the time to be surprised. Even stranger, no mass loop breaking occurred.

“Fucker.” Jace reached down to grab any material nearby to craft a weapon. Before he could, a series of throwing knives sunk into most of his arms and torso. Half a dozen conditions were afflicted—each of them ominous in its own right—before the jock fell to the ground as well.

A couple of knives were also thrown Will’s way as well, but his rogue skills helped him evade them and leap back without taking any injuries.

“Looks like you’ve improved,” Danny said. “Don’t worry, they won’t remember a thing.” He looked around. “Been a while, Alex,” he said loudly. “No need to hide. We’re old buddies, after all. For real for real.”

There was no response.

Will frantically looked about for anything he could use as a weapon. The entire encounter, not to mention the boss battle, had completely depleted him. He wasn’t only exhausted, but completely weaponless. That left only one option.

A torrent of knives burst out from Danny, as if he were made of them. From a distance, one might almost think that he was holding a firehose. No normal person would be able to hold that many, let alone throw them at such speed, and yet that was precisely what he was doing.

Mirror copies of the goofball appeared in the surrounding area, but they weren’t the target of the attack. Rather, Danny seemed intent on throwing knives at nothing in particular until all of a sudden, all the mirror copies simultaneously shattered.

“Well, shit,” Danny said, almost in disbelief. “I’d thought he’d do a lot better. Guess I was wrong.” He turned to face Will. “Only one left.”

In his mind, Will explored what he could do. With attack out of the question, fleeing was the only option. The issue with that was that he was on the edge of the area and Danny had blocked the way in. No doubt it was calculated. A rogue’s greatest strength was mobility. Unfortunately, that was the same class that Danny had been. Interesting why eternity hadn’t stepped in. In the past, it hadn’t allowed for a class duplication.

Taking the gamble, Will leaped away from the other boy. As expected, a torrent of knives flew at him. From this distance, though, evading them was easy enough.

“You can’t run,” Danny shouted from behind. “You’re only increasing your pain.”

“Yeah, right.”

“I’ll just restart the loop. You’ll keep your rewards, your permanents, and even the coins. You’ll only miss the memories of me.”

At this point, Will couldn’t trust anything that came out of Daniel’s mouth. But even if what he claimed was true, it still didn’t sound like a good deal. If losing his memories related to the former rogue was so benign, why hadn’t he mentioned it before? This was the second time that Will had been specifically targeted. Getting the mirror fragment—as beneficial as that was—had almost gotten him squished between two mirrors. Now, the “favor” he had performed had somehow brought Danny back to life.

“How did you die?” Will asked, in an effort to gain some time. “Eternity doesn’t kill.”

“Not at your level,” the other replied, proving Will’s hunch right. Being locked alone in eternity for goodness knows how long without anyone to talk to must have been more than dreadful. Now that he was back in the world, Danny was eager to chat, even if on many levels he knew that he shouldn’t. “You’ll get there soon enough. Just give it time. It’s inevitable.”

Holding his breath, Will leaped beyond the invisible barrier that marked the end of the area. Nothing stopped him from doing so. There were no warnings, no surprise messages… it was as if nothing particular had happened. Despite that, one could instantly tell the difference. All the destruction caused by the goblin hordes had been left behind. No wonder that no one had come to the assistance of the people within the area. As far as everyone else was concerned, nothing of interest had occurred. It was as if eternity had only affected a small patch of the city. Would the effects slowly spread to be noticed by others? Or would they only become aware upon entering it? Will would never find out. Sooner or later, his loop would come to an end, even without Danny’s help, and then everything would restart.

Two more knives darted a few feet from his left shoulder, causing Will to leap to the right. Danny hadn’t given up.

“Only idiots go outside their area,” Danny shouted.

“You should know.”

“I see you haven’t met the archer. If you had, you’d be pissing your pants right now.”

“Says who?” Against any apparent logic, Will stopped.

Suspecting something, Danny did as well. Fifty feet separated the two—not enough to fight, but enough for each to keep the other from escaping, as long as they had weapons.

“I’ve seen what he's capable of,” Will said. “In fact, I’m counting on it.”

“You think the archer will team up with you against me?” Danny laughed. “And I thought you were the smart one in the group.”

“No.” Will smiled. “I know he won’t.”

Out of nowhere, an arrow pierced his head.

 

**Restarting eternity.**

 

The calm chaos of a starting school day surrounded Will. After everything that had happened in the previous loop, he had almost forgotten what it was like to be surrounded by normalcy. The honking of cars, the screams of children ashamed to be taken to school by their parents, and even the weird looks he got from everyone felt more than welcome.

“Don’t block the path, weirdo,” Jess said, as she and Ely passed by.

Will gave the girl a smile, causing her to instantly look away. Part of him even wanted to strike a conversation, as if this was just another day. Before he could, he felt someone’s hand on his shoulder.

“Bro!” Alex said, grinning like a madman. “That was lit! Passing the tutorial in one go!”

“Shh.” Will hushed him, looking around.

“For real, bro?” The goofball narrowed his eyes. “No one will care. If they do, we’ll just wait till they don’t.”

The logic was sound, but still felt wrong.

“And those rewards…” Alex gesticulated. “Lit fire!”

Will reached into his pocket. The mirror fragment was still there. The bigger question was whether Daniel was within it.

Two pinging sounds filled the air as both Will’s and Alex’s phones got a message. Typically, it was the goofball who reacted first.

“It’s Hel,” he said. “She’s calling us to the moose place.”

“It’s…” Will began. “Never mind,” he gave up. “Let’s go.”

Five minutes later, as everyone was rushing to school. The four loopers were sitting comfortably at what had become their gathering coffee shop. As in every loop, the barista casually asked why they weren’t in class, and got the usual lie as a reply.

Drinks were bought, along with a lot of overpriced pastries. Will, himself, went back to his favorite chocolate mousse. Not too long ago, he had sworn to himself that he’d take a break from the stuff. The end of the tutorial had changed his mind.

“I was planning to do this tonight,” Jace said. Like everyone else, he couldn’t get over the feeling of how different everything looked. To a certain degree, that only made him nervous. “Proper celebration—beers and everything.”

“I don’t drink.” Helen gave him an annoyed look.

“Beer isn’t drinking. It’s marking a good game, and the end of the fucking tutorial.”

Alex gave him two thumbs up, while Helen just placed her mirror fragment on the table. Looking closely, everyone could see a single message right in the middle of it: **1/4**.

On a hunch, Will took out his fragment as well and placed it in front of him. Immediately, a message appeared on it, just as the one in Helen’s mirror changed to **2/4**.

“It’s not over yet,” he said.

Jace and Alex did the same. Once all the mirror fragments were on the table, the numbers disappeared, replaced by a golden message.

 

**GROUP 5 – TUTORIAL COMPLETE**

**Overall ranking: 2nd place.**

 

**Eternity zone expanded.**

**Chat functionality enabled.**

 

“Second Place?” Alex asked. “For real?”

“I wonder who got number one,” Jace said in a serious tone of voice.

Eager to learn more, Will tapped on his fragment.

 

**KEY HOLDER status removed.**

**Everyone in the party can unlock hidden mirrors.**

**(1/7)**

 

**Free Roaming**

**Use your new skills to locate new challenges.**

**(2/7)**

 

**For each challenge completed, you’ll gain a boss reward, along with anything else you collect during your run.**

**(3/7)**

 

**If you leave the loop before the challenge is over, you have to start over from the beginning. All non-permanent skills and items will be lost.**

**(4/7)**

 

“This is what’s beyond the tutorial,” Helen said.

To some degree, it seemed expected. They had defeated a boss within a small area, so now they were free to do the same in larger ones. On the positive side, it didn’t look like the new “challenges” would be forced onto them. If they wanted, they could continue with the standard school loops and not get involved. Of course, after the adrenaline rush of the boss battle, no one was willing to return to the mundane.

“Anyone remember what happened after we killed the boss?” Will asked casually.

“What’s there to remember, Stoner?” Jace looked at him.

“I was expecting a bit… more,” Will lied. It seemed that indeed, no one remembered Daniel. Maybe that was a good thing. Knowing that he was out there somewhere while also being dead sent shivers down his spine.

“For real,” Alex agreed. “Ending was oof, like most tutorials.”

“You fuckers,” Jace laughed. “Write a complaint to eternity.”

“Guys,” Helen said. “Look at the hints.”

The note of concern in her voice put an end to the banter. Quickly, everyone tapped on their mirror fragments.

 

**Hint 1**

**You can exchange coins for items at merchant locations hidden throughout the eternity zone.**

 

**Hint 2**

**Some challenges limit the number of people that can participate.**

 

**Hint 3**

**Players can fight each other freely.**

 

There it was. Nothing was capable of creating such dread as the final hint. So far, the group had experienced a lot. They had faced scores of wolves, goblins, mirror images of their own classes, not to mention an assortment of strange and strong elite monsters, and even bosses. Yet all that paled in comparison to the enemies they could expect to face from now. There was nothing stronger than a bunch of other looped people, each of which had gone through the exact same thing that Will and the others had. From this moment onwards, the loops became that much more deadly.

Heya, all!



This marks the final chapter of the first part of the series. 

There will be a slight pause for the rest of the year (although I shall continue with my Reluctant dungeon series during that time)

Furthermore, I'd like to apologies for not being as active in responding to comments. I've been dealing with a real life emergency and will try to get back at responding as quick as possible.



Thank you for following this story!

Be well, enjoy a great New Year's celebration, and hope to see you in 2025 :D

So far the best contender for hot chocolate is Olde Tyme Pastries in Turlock, which is great, but I was hoping Modesto could maybe have a worthy competitor. 

Sadly, Queen Bean and Preservation let me down, they only make heated up chocolate milk — no offense to these small businesses, y’all make GREAT coffee! That’s their specialty, after all! Their cocoa is just… mid. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

I haven’t tried any other small business cafes in Modesto yet tho, so if anyone knows one with a solid cocoa game, please let me know!

And please no recs for big corporate conglomerates like Starbucks; I already know their cocoa is the worst ever, and even if it wasn’t, I prefer to support small businesses. ",2,1734115465.0,Modesto,5,0.75,False

1hdj444,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicMoldExposure/comments/1hdj444/how_i_cured_my_mold_toxicity_and_took_back_my_life/,How I cured my mold toxicity and took back my life,"Quick backstory on me: I lived in a house with black mold for years and didn’t realize it. About five years ago, I started getting flu-like symptoms every time I ate gluten, which was the first symptom I really noticed. At the time, I didn’t relate it to mold. Fast forward to earlier this year, I discovered mold around a door that had been sealed in my room. I believe the house probably has more mold, but I moved out in early September.

Over the last several years, my symptoms progressively worsened, typically manifesting as me being sick a couple of times a week. It just became my normal, and doctors never really had any answers for me. In the past year, the symptoms became debilitating. I was completely renovating the house with mold to flip it, so I was there all day, every day, which caused my symptoms to reach an all-time high. I experienced chronic fatigue, dehydration, depression—the whole collection of mold toxicity symptoms. It was awful, and life sucked. I was always sick and had so much work to do but couldn’t manage it because of all my health issues.

When I moved to a new place in September, I was determined to get better. I’ve never been overweight and was 180 pounds at my heaviest (I’m a 5'10"" male). However, I lost 20 pounds just from being sick and not wanting to eat. I never felt hungry and could easily go all day without eating. While losing weight might sound nice, I never felt healthy.

One night after moving into my new place, I decided to watch TV, and a documentary called *Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead* popped up. It’s about an Australian guy who has a chronic illness, is overweight, and wants to change. He moves to America and goes on a 60-day juice cleanse, drinking only juice. By the end, he cures his illness, loses a lot of weight, and even helps another guy with the same illness cure it through juicing.

The part that stuck out to me the most was when the Australian guy goes into a diner in middle America and starts talking to locals. He asks if they’ve ever juiced and whether they’d try it. One man, who was overweight and eating pie, said he could never juice. He admitted he had severe diabetes but couldn’t stop eating sweets. He thought he only had a few years left because of his eating habits. At that moment, I realized this guy was saying his addiction to instant gratification was more important than living. He literally could just stop eating sweets and wouldn’t have diabetes, but he couldn’t. That part hit me hard.

I told myself that I will never get diabetes, heart disease, or similar illnesses if I simply delay gratification. I might never taste a cinnamon roll again, but how long does ""taste"" really last? The reward for skipping that is health, happiness, and longevity.

So, I started juicing. The first three weeks were amazing—it felt like a cheat code. I had so much natural energy that I stayed up until 3 a.m. (I still drank one cup of coffee in the morning). I slept great and didn’t have any mold symptoms. I thought I had come out the other side and that things would be great moving forward.

One interesting thing I noticed: I think most of us are addicted to food. Before I started juicing, I would eat chips and processed food, and I could tell my body was rejecting it. Every time I ate something processed, my stomach would get upset, and I’d feel sick. But it tasted good, so I kept eating it. Once I stopped completely, I realized it’s like any other addiction, such as nicotine.

Now, when I drink a glass of fresh juice in the morning, I don’t feel hungry all day. I’ll make another juice in the evening just to get more nutrients. This experience also made me realize how, as a society, we don’t prioritize health at all. That’s why diets don’t work.

When people diet, they’re told to eat fewer calories—maybe 1,200 instead of 2,000—but they still eat processed food. The problem? Processed food is addictive, and you don’t realize it until you stop eating it. Imagine if cigarettes were always available, and you started smoking as a baby, never once stopping. You wouldn’t realize how addictive they are. Dieting is basically asking an addict to use less of the drug they’re addicted to. What people need to do is completely give up processed foods and eat real food. Because eventually people are just going to go back to eating the same way again.

Whatever you believe about how we came to be, nature provides everything we need not just to survive but to thrive. Man-made food is fake food, masquerading as real. Our bodies weren’t designed to eat it. Our external health reflects our internal health. Being ""skinny"" shouldn’t be about fitting into a smaller size; it should be about giving our body what it truly needs.

Here’s another documentary I found helpful: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aaxa7rxEbyk). If you want relief from mold symptoms and are open to drastic measures, follow what they do in the documentary. As long as you’re not currently being exposed to mold, this will greatly help.

Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago—I started feeling sick again and having a lot of bowel movements. I was confused because I was only drinking juice. After doing some research, I learned about the delayed detox response. Here’s a summary:

1. When you start a juice cleanse, your body first eliminates surface-level toxins. Over time, it starts addressing stored toxins in fat cells, tissues, or organs.
2. During a cleanse, the body burns fat, releasing stored toxins into the bloodstream. This can temporarily overwhelm the liver and kidneys, causing symptoms like fatigue or digestive issues.
3. Over weeks, the body digs deeper into older toxin stores, leading to a delayed detox response.

This explained why I felt sick again. My body was burning fat cells that had stored mold toxins, releasing them into my bloodstream. Thankfully, my body did a good job flushing them out.

Now, I’m in week two of the delayed detox and feel great again. I’ve also lost about 13 pounds since starting the cleanse. Maybe this will help others dealing with similar issues.",1,1734115393.0,ToxicMoldExposure,13,0.6,False
1hdj3j9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pessimism/comments/1hdj3j9/coping_mechanisms_are_misinterpreted_as_life_is/,Coping mechanisms are misinterpreted as ‘life is good’. ,"I cannot help but notice that humans misinterpret ‘cope’ for some general satisfaction with life. It seems to me that literally everything we do is just a coping mechanism for the struggle of life. Let’s just go through some some coping mechanisms that people mostly view as examples of ‘life being good’, and then list off what they’re really coping against: 

Coffee: the exhaustion of life - 
Drugs : the pain of life -
Music : either the pain or boredom of life -
Art in general : either the pain or boredom of life -
Sports : the boredom of life - 
Video games : the boredom of life - 
Exercise : the angst of life - 
Sex/masturbation : the pain of being horny - 
Philosophy/therapy : the mental anguish of life -
Religion : the fear of death -
Politics : the boredom of life 

Life isn’t “good”….it’s just a constant, never ending cope with the natural struggle of life. It’s pretty amazing how most people don’t see it for what it actually is. Although I do sort of envy people who don’t see it. 

Edit: don’t get me wrong, I love the cope…especially music! But it doesn’t mean that “life is good”. All it does is just confirm life is always a struggle, and you’re constantly coping with it.",14,1734115351.0,Pessimism,6,0.95,False

1hdizr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1hdizr0/wanting_to_move_out_getting_cold_feet/,"Wanting to move out, getting cold feet","I (25M) have been living with my mom and younger brother my entire life. Growing up I suffered a lot of trauma due to an abusive narcissistic father, and my mom had to grab us and basically leave him when I was around 13 for our safety and to have a better life. 

Since then, it’s just been us three and things were always pretty good, at least being free from his abuse. I mean we suffered a lot of loneliness as family never checked in on us, and I basically had to help care for my younger brother as my mom worked two jobs to support us. But I t was always just us three against the world it seemed… in our own safe, warm home.

Anywho, since COVID my relationship with my brother has really taken a toll on my mental health. He started getting very aggressive and abusive after starting to get into contact/hang around our father more (father wanted to “rekindle” their relationship but it was all a ploy to gain control… they no longer talk now). But that feeling of uneasiness and trauma triggers resurfaced ever since then, and he is an exact clone of my dad. I get so frustrated and upset knowing how safe I felt getting away from my abusive dad just to know live with his carbon copy clone with same behaviors.

Also, growing up I never had anything of my own. I had to share everything with my brother, yet never vice versa. Even when we had a bigger home and had our own bedrooms, he was still sleeping with me in my room because he was too scared to be in his own. To this day we share the master bedroom (which is pretty big) as our home is only 2 bedrooms, and having zero space to myself is killing me… especially when I want to be away from him in my own peace and he comes up to also lay in his bed. Zero privacy. He also never helps clean anything including the room or bathroom, and he is FILTHY.

But I just can’t take him anymore… The constant unprovoked verbal abuse, him destroying my belongings, etc. I’ve threatened to even press charges multiple times but he is so beyond psychotic he then threatens that he will lie and say I did something to him that I didn’t do, which I can’t risk because I’m a licensed health professional… My mom has tried everything to normalize him / get him to stop, but he doesn’t listen and continues to be abusive.

I want to go. I want my own place. I want to have my own four walls to do what I want, when I want, and be free from judgement and crazy people. I can afford it, and have already begun with the process in searching. 

But now there’s a lot of guilt settling in… I don’t want to leave my mom as we have a great relationship. I love spending time with her, and knowing that I won’t be waking up and having coffee on the couch with her every morning makes me so sad to think about. I don’t have many friends and definitely consider my mom to be my best friend, especially how much we’ve been through. But I can’t take my brother and the abuse anymore.

It just really makes me sad because that feeling of a safe, warm, cozy home us three had after escaping from my abusive father is long gone. It is now cold and dark… all because of my brother.


TLDR; Getting cold feet about moving out of my mom’s house. Wanting to leave for independence and escape an abusive younger sibling. Scared I’ll be lonely and miss seeing my mom, and my mom is my best friend. Upset because we already escaped an abusive parent just for my younger sibling to become his carbon copy.

Now on to my question for those with experience:
What are the steps to start? What licensing do I need? What supplies are essential? What’s the espresso machine that is required to handle more volume than an at home machine? What are things that you forgot but ended up really needing?
If someone could explain this to me like I’m 5 years old, I would greatly appreciate it. 
Thank you so much in advance, I know I’m asking for a lot here. ",2,1734114875.0,smallbusiness,2,1.0,False

I tracked it to 855 Knickerbocker / 258 Schaefer St and posted here to see if anyone knew anyone, yada yada. 

When I went to the AT&T store in my neighborhood (Flatbush) the manager suggested I try asking the cops to meet me at the pinged location and knocking on some doors.   
  
He said I'd need to walk into the precinct to do that, but there was one right around the corner. This was what a few other folks on here suggested and since I have much more time than money, I gave it a shot. 

So I went to the precinct in Flatbush, asked at the front desk, and the woman there told me that I had to go to the actual location where the phone was on FindMyiPhone, then call 911 and meet the cops. 

I hauled myself over to the address where my phone pinged, called 911, then waited in a coffee shop for about 45 minutes. 

When they finally arrived, they sprung into action. I've honestly never seen anything like it. 

These two officers were so completely dedicated to and focused on my problem, and honestly, I've never seen people make so many excuses for not doing their job with such skill and polish. 

Here's what happened:

1) They said: ""Did you see your phone get taken?"" No, I was pickpocketed. ""Oh, so you LOST your phone. If you didn't see someone steal it, you don't know it was stolen.""

Never mind that I put a reward message and a phone number on the ""Lost"" screen and saw it travel to two different apartments before coming to a stop. 

I told them ""if someone has property of yours that they know isn't theirs, isn't that stealing? And if they decline to return it after 8-12 hours, you can be pretty sure they're not going to, right?"" 

""Also, is pickpocketing considered a crime? Because by that rationale, everyone who gets their pockets picked actually just misplaced their phones and wallets.""

They weren't ready for this kind of skilled legal logic, so they just ignored the question.

2) They said: ""We can't go in this building knocking down doors without a warrant, that's going to open the police department up for all kinds of lawsuits.""

I told them ""I am not asking you to force your way into individual apartments, I'm asking you to stand in the hallway and knock on a door with me. Or let me knock and you just stand there and make sure I don't get stabbed.""

3) They said: ""There's nothing that says that the people are going to give up your phone, they could just say they don't have it and we can't do anything.""

True, but don't you guys regularly ask people questions without kicking the door in? And don't people self-incriminate all the time? I've sure been pulled over more than once and the cops said ""we'd like to search your vehicle,"" insinuating that I had to let them. They do that because sometimes people do let them do it without a warrant. 

There's also a chance that someone would be intimidated and say ""oh, uh, yeah, that phone, I found it last night, here it is."" Not the highest chance, but as long as you guys drove out here, let's give it the old ""college try.""   
  
Or more likely the old ""community college try.""

4) I said ""look, a bunch of people have been getting their phones stolen at shows in Brooklyn, this fits a definite pattern. Can't you do anything?""

I think we all know that answer.

What I could do, I was told, was go back to the venue, call 911 from there and then file a ""lost item"" report. But those two cops definitely couldn't do that because it wasn't in their precinct. 

I'm not sure what happens when they're chasing someone and that person enters another precinct. Do they screech to a halt like cops in the movies when they get to a state line? 

What they COULD do for me was stand there holding their nuts while I personally rummaged through the garbage cans outside. 

6) I asked them if they were aware that pickpockets were probably stealing so many phone from people BECAUSE of this approach. Like, wow, they DEFINITELY know they're not gonna get caught. 

7) I also asked them why they bothered coming outside in the cold. I had to leave my number so they could call me, couldn't they have just stayed in the car and said ""can't do nuttin' for ya, man"" over the phone and saved themselves some time?

8) If the person at the precinct in Flatbush had had any idea what they were talking about, I'd have saved some decent change on Uber rides and about four hours of my time. 

TL;DR: Fuck the police, and fuck me for thinking otherwise at first. 

There's no justice anymore, just grab what you can and share it to your friends and family. ",46,1734114823.0,Bushwick,17,0.91,False

I lived in EU for four years and have done enough traveling to feel comfortable to explore. BUTTTT it is my first time traveling SOLO. I am excited to spend some time alone, do whatever I like, and meet people as well along the way. Hopefully I do.. I don't think I can go 10 days not talking at all lol

This is my itinerary: 

**>>>> 4 nights in Madrid** (I am revisiting, done all touristy stuff before) + day trip to Segovia. 

* Any recent travelers to Hats, Cats, Newton hostel!!! Could you share your experience?
* I have must go places in mind but if you've done anything out of the ordinary please do share!
* Any food tours, cooking classes, walking tours?
* Apps like Meetup and Travel Buddy (?? I think) any success stories on those?
* Any eating alone at a bar/restaurant experiences? I do it often in the US but not quite sure what it would be like in Spain. 

**>>>> 1 night in Toledo.** I read on other threads that Toledo is a day trip kind of place but after Youtubing a bit, it felt peaceful so I decided to get a hotel for the night and enjoy the slow paced trip. 

* Any good spots to see the sunrise/sunset? I have Mirador Del Valle on my list already. 
* What do people do in Toledo mostly? Any walking tours (if so, which site)? Rooftop coffee shops/bars? Restaurant recommendations please! 
* Any good pastry shop would be appreciated. It'll be my birthday this day so I want to savor some good memorable sweets with wine.

**>>>> 4 nights in Seville** \+ maybe day trip to surrounding small city if I get bored.

* Generally, would you say it is safe? My hotel is about 15 mins out of the city center. Should have gotten a hostel which is right in the center and they look pretty awesome (ehh my mistake) 
* I have no plan, no idea what to do here just yet. Just planning to roam freely and enjoy sitting outside people watching. Any good tea places, food, churros?

**>>>> Final night in Madrid** before hopping back to the US

  
**Train tickets:** Would you say it would be too early to buy a month before? (MAD to Toledo; Toledo to Sevile; Seville to Madrid)?? 

**Drinks:** I read some strawberry wine/ vino de fresa , orange wine, cubatas are a must. I can't miss out on drinks, if you got a list, send it here!

Hi everyone, I’d really appreciate your advice on a friendship that’s been weighing on me for a while. I’ll try to summarise as best as I can.

I’ve been friends with X (25F) for a few years, and while she can be caring and supportive at times, our friendship has become maybe one-sided and overwhelming. I’ve been going through a lot this year - health issues, hospital visits, and family emergencies - and I’ve felt like she hasn’t been there for me that much. However, I've known her for 7 years and she's really been there for me previously, and I feel like she really gets me/understands me and is generally on the same wavelength most of the time. We've shared a lot and she's generally a very non-judgemental, funny, amazing person, in my opinion.

We're mostly online friends (originally met online) and she lives like 4 hours away from me in another city.

Here’s some context:

\- Earlier this year, I had a big milestone birthday (30F), which she forgot. She also left me on read for weeks beforehand and didn’t check in even when she knew I had hospital visits coming up, including an overnight stay.

\- I reached out to address my feelings, and she apologised, saying she thought I had left HER on read which is why she didn't reach out (even though she had ignored my messages). While we reconciled, things have still felt distant and off.

\- X often sends heavy, vague texts without context or follow-up, usually late at night. I find this overwhelming and emotionally draining because I don’t know how to help her, and she never really opens up about what’s going on. If she sent something like, 'Hey, I'm finding things really hard lately, can we go get coffee/watch a movie to distract me' or 'hey I'm struggling and need some advice on XYZ' but it's never like this.

\- She always tries to call me when I've repeatedly asked her to please text me or at least give me warning (like 'are you free to chat this evening' type thing). This might be a bit weird but I am utterly exhausted lately with all the medical stuff I have going on, which she knows, and when she calls it's often very overwhelming and calls usually last around 3 hours. She has, I think, undiagnosed/unmedicated ADHD (as do I!) but she won't get it treated. I even downloaded the ADHD referral form and letter, filled it out for her, and mailed it to her for her to give to her GP (like she asked me to), and she never did it.

\- I haven't actually seen her in person for almost 2 years now. We have both cancelled on each other lately, which isn't great (mainly due to each other having an illness or something)

Recently, she booked time off work to visit me in my city this month, but communication has been rocky. I don't know if I want to see her or not as I feel so overwhelmed. She called me twice the day before yesterday (I was in hospital appointments and physio so my phone was on DND). I text her, 'hey i saw you called, sorry i missed it, what's up?' no reply. Then yesterday she called me twice again, and I said 'hi bb can you please text instead? what's going on?' no reply.

Then, as I was falling alseep, I got a text from her at 1am: 'Hi do you know any anti suicidal exercises'.

I didn’t reply because I was almost asleep, and honestly, I didn’t know how to handle it. I feel awful, but I also feel like it was a lot to drop on me so late, especially given the way things have been between us. I also don't even know what an anti-suicidal exercise is. In the past I've sent her numbers to places, even found low cost therapy near her, but she didn't want to call them or go to therapy

I really don’t want to cut someone off if they're struggling, as I've gone through awful things myself, too - but I also feel really hurt by how this friendship has been lately. I’ve been trying to set boundaries around things like phone calls and vague messages, but I don’t know how to approach this situation without feeling guilty or making things worse. I really appreciate her as a person and her friendship over the years, but lately, it's been getting very tough. She is also quite reactive so if I reply something she might do something or not talk to me, or even block me. The last message was about the anti suicidal exercises and I don't know what to reply, but I'm getting increasingly anxious about it all.

How do I navigate this? Thank you so much

  
EDIT: I also want to add, I have PTSD for various things, including trauma from growing up with a family member who has BPD. Some of my trauma is from witnessing this person attempt S and SH frequently since I was about 8 years old. The worst one being when I was 12-13 years old and them saying 'I know you're trying to talk me out of it and help but you can't help me' and promptly attempting S, with me calling the ambulance etc. This is repeated a lot throughout my childhood/teens (even now sometimes!). My friend knows all of this and knows all of my traumas, too, so when she sends a text like that it really throws me as she knows all of my history ",1,1734114697.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Khi tụi mày đi ngoài đường mà có đau bụng muốn sắp mắc ỉa thì cứ kiếm nhà vệ sinh công cộng vô đi đại đi ( nhà vệ sinh công cộng bên đây sạch sẽ thơm tho không có dơ hầy như ở Vịt Lôm ) hoặc cửa hàng tiện lợi gần nhất, siêu thị, coffee shop, bên đây mỗi lần đi vô nhà vệ sinh nó thơm ngây nhất  . Vì sau tao nói như vậy về tốc độ ở xứ này nó có qui định chạy xe hàng lối không phải như vịt lôm là chen hàng sẵn sàng lấn len để về nhanh để về được nhà được ỉa trong bồn cầu thân iêu của mình đâu mà tụi mày sẽ ăn giấy phạt, như thời xưa tao có thể nói mắc ỉa mấy lần có lần ỉa trong quần khi về tới nhà, cũng có lần vừa về tới nhà là phọt ở trong cầu nhà mình hậu quả dọn thấy mẹ, ưu tiên nếu thấy mắc thì đi thà quê trong nhà cầu vscc còn hơn quê khi bị phọt cức ở ngoài đường. Về việc rác hầu như sáng nào tao cũng hay chuẩn bị cho mình 4 5 cái bọc đó là bọc đựng mấy cái rác lặt vãnh vd như bọc của bao thuốc lá, hộp thuốc lá vì tao hay hút thuốc, nắp chai chai nước bla bla giấy xàm lông, giấy tao hỉ mũi, đang trong mùa đông lạnh nên tao thường nghẹt mũi. 

Thứ 2 việc học ngôn ngữ và văn hóa thì này khỏi cần nói.

Qua xứ người ta, bất cứ nước nào cũng vậy Mỹ Đế, Châu Âu, Úc Đại Lợi, Tân Tây Lan, Nhựt Bổn Đại Hàn. thì việc học tiếng là việc dĩ nhiên nhưng mà muốn giao tiếp tốt thì chơi với người bản xứ càng nhiều nhưng phải chọn lọc nha, học tiếng với người bản xứ. thì tụi mày sẽ nói thông thạo nhanh thôi, tao từ lúc qua đây tuần nào cũng học với người Bản xứ bây giờ tao như giao tiếp nữa vấp nữa lưu loát. Có thể 3 tháng nữa là tao có thể 70% lưu loát phần tiếng. Còn văn hóa thì cứ hỏi thẳng với người bản xứ những việc nào mình nên làm, thí dụ như ở Vịt Nôm tụi mày ăn cơm ngồi chờm hởm ko sau, nhưng qua đây m hỏi người Nhựt là ăn cơm ngồi chờm hởm có sau không đại loại tao ví dụ là vậy. Để tránh ko bị nói là vô văn hóa "" Nhập Gia thì phải tùy tục"".

Thứ 3. Hạn chế tiếp xúc với đồng hương.

Chỗ tao có ông Senpai là người VN trong công việc thì tao sẽ giao tiếp, nhưng khi ra về hầu như tao không rủ ổng đi chơi. vì lí do sợ bị kỳ thị hoặc bị ngó tới ngó lui, hồi đợt rồi tao cũng miễn cưỡng chấp nhận đi Miyagi với ổng để ổng rủ hoài. Đi lần đó là hồi thứ 2 ổng ngõ ý rủ tao xuống Tokyo. Nhưng tao từ chối vì tao còn mấy cái plan cần làm bên xứ này đó làm project cho riêng tao, có sinh lời tao vẫn đóng thuế cho nước sở tại, vì đã cho tao cơ hội được làm con người.

Thứ 4. Bên xứ này đừng giúp đỡ người VN kể cả người nước ngoài

Nói tới đây thì nghe hơi vô cảm nhưng nó thực sự tốt cho tụi bây, Thà mày không giúp để tụi mày bớt phiền. Vì mày nói chuyện với 1 người lạ mày sẽ không biết nó đã đang làm gì đâu. Khi cảnh sát ập tới đi hỏi  mày nó mất thời gian mặc dù tụi bây đéo làm gì. Nên né là chính, khi đi ra ngoài đường gặp người nhờ mày giúp thì mày nên nhờ cảnh sát, việc giúp người dân khi khó khăn trên đường là việc của cảnh sát, chứ ko phải của mình. ( Còn tao giúp đỡ khách hàng của tao khi trong phạm vi làm việc của tao ) Ngoài công việc tao sẽ không giúp không trả lời luôn. Vì giúp bậy bạ nó phiền tao còn mấy miệng ăn ở Việt Nam Ba mẹ, anh em chó mèo, vợ tương lai, họ đang đợi tao mang đi ra khỏi cái quê nghèo đất khổ. 

Thứ 5. Ở nơi công cộng và trên tàu điện

Thông thường tao ít có ăn khi đi ngoài công cộng, Ở VN thì còn được ngậm ổ bánh mì buổi sáng khi chạy xe lúc đi làm trễ, bên đây thì ko được nó gây mất an toàn, cả dơ nữa. Nên việc này hầu như tao thức sớm tao ăn sáng trước rồi tắm rữa vệ sinh chạy đi làm. Ở trên tàu điện thì có 4 điều mày nên làm đó là 1 đọc sách & truyện 2 là đeo tai nghe bấm điện thoại, 3 là ngắm cảnh, 4 là vẽ tranh. Này ngẫu hứng của tao khi ngồi trên tàu điện, Nhưng đừng đem những thức ăn hay um xùm ảnh hưởng đến người khác là được. Đừng như những con khỉ đột, hay con khỉ trường sơn ở tokyo đội nón cối, làm mấy chuyện khác người. Tao nhìn thấy tao chỉ muôn kiếm cái quần đội để cho đỡ nhục. 

Những cách trên tao nói không phải là khôn lõi nhưng vì tụi bây mới sang nước người ta, nên cái gì mình cũng phải nhập gia tùy tục cho dễ sống, khi tụi mày có quốc tịch rồi, tụi mày được chính phủ nước nó bảo kê rồi muốn làm gì làm, còn mang quốc tịch VN thì nhục chết mẹ, chỉ có làm sau cho dân bản xứ nó có cái nhìn tốt đẹp về mình để mai mốt, dân Nhựt nó nhận biết đâu là Vietnamese đâu là Việt cộng. 

Nhớ làm sai xin lỗi rồi phải sửa, chứ đừng xin lỗi 1 cách vô cớ .

I heard a popping sound and my muscle cramped a bit. Next thing you know I am in pain, and it's radiating to my shoulder. I can't stand, walk, or sit without it hurting. The pain is so severe that I need to place my neck at a very specific angle. I also cannot lie down without it hurting.

Should I go to urgent care or rely on ice?

  
edit: the pain is making me cry. I think it's a 9 out of 10 on the pain scale",1,1734114046.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False
1hdilcx,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductInsider/comments/1hdilcx/my_3month_journey_with_orgain_collagen_peptides/,My 3-Month Journey with Orgain Collagen Peptides Powder: An Honest Review,"**Initial Experience**

I started using Orgain Collagen Peptides Powder three months ago, hoping to improve my overall wellness. The powder comes from grass-fed, pasture-raised bovine sources and contains Type I and III collagen peptides. Each serving provides 20g of collagen peptides and 18g of protein.

**Physical Changes**

After consistent use, I've noticed several positive changes:

**Skin Health**: My skin feels more hydrated and has a natural glow. I've observed improved elasticity and a reduction in fine lines.

**Hair and Nails**: My nails have become noticeably stronger and less prone to breaking. My hair feels softer and appears to grow faster than before.

**Joint Comfort**: The most surprising benefit has been the improvement in my joint comfort. As someone who spends long hours at a desk, I've experienced less knee and joint stiffness.

**Gut Health**: An unexpected bonus has been better digestive regularity. My gut health has improved significantly since starting this supplement.

**Product Features**

**Quality Ingredients**: The powder contains just one ingredient in the unflavored version - collagen peptides. It's free from:

* Gluten
* Soy
* Dairy
* Artificial preservatives
* GMOs
* Artificial flavors and colors

**Mixing Experience**

I've experimented with different ways to incorporate the powder:

**Hot Beverages**: Dissolves well in my morning coffee and tea, though thorough stirring is needed to prevent clumping.

**Cold Drinks**: Mixes decently in smoothies and protein shakes, but takes more effort to blend completely.

**Food Integration**: Works well when added to:

* Oatmeal
* Yogurt
* Baked goods
* Soups

**Value Consideration**

The price point is reasonable compared to other collagen supplements. The unflavored version provides 22 servings per container, and there's a subscribe-and-save option for 15% off.

**Areas for Improvement**

**Texture**: Sometimes leaves a slight chalky texture in beverages if not mixed thoroughly.

**Serving Size**: The two-scoop serving can be inconvenient to measure.

**Taste**: While marketed as unflavored, there's a subtle taste that some might notice, particularly in water.

**Mixability**: Can be challenging to dissolve completely in cold liquids.

**Storage and Usage Tips**

I've found these methods helpful:

* Store in a cool, dry place
* Use a blender for cold beverages
* Mix with hot liquid first before adding cold ingredients
* Stir thoroughly to prevent clumping

**Overall Health Impact**

Beyond the visible benefits, I've experienced:

* More consistent energy levels
* Better post-workout recovery
* Improved satiety between meals
* Enhanced overall wellness

There I had bought my preground coffee from a supermarket nearby and since it were my first packets of coffee, I looked for 'strong' coffee. I have seemed to have bought burnt coffee and the problem was not with my moka pot. I have realized this when I threw the coffee in some hot water and that by itself smelt burnt.

I today went to a nearby roaster and bought a little of everything that they got. some light roast, some medium roast and some dark roast. Now the coffee tastes fine. no burnt smell, no coffee smell either.

If I smell my coffee powder, I get a rather weird smell. somewhere between cardamom and coffee and rather stale and suffocating id say. The only other coffee I've smelled is the one we get around cafes. 

What smell should I actually be expecting from my powder and after the brew? please share your experiences...",4,1734113922.0,mokapot,7,0.83,False
1hdijq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1hdijq5/can_i_get_a_n/,Can I get a N🧊? ,"I went to my first work holiday party. I’ve never gone in the past and finally decided to show my face after four years. (I’m signed to an agency and have been off consecutive work since 2020.) 

I’ve been able to be around alcohol in party spaces since my accident and haven’t had any cravings, but this party actually made me nervous and that’s when the panic arose. It’s the first time the thought “ugh, a drink would calm me” entered my mind in ages. It scared me. I read so many books about this potentially happening and since I’ve always been around my friends and family, I got a false sense of security. Before I pulled up to the party, I checked my Apple Watch and my heart rate was 105. Crazy! But I didn’t drink! I let myself feel all the unpleasant emotions, awkwardly met some people, drank my water and NA beer and made new friends. I have a coffee date with another writer who also went to the same university as me? What are the odds! Plus the bartenders were so attentive the moment I asked for the NA menu and double checked with me every time. 

It was really a moment to see how I would be alone, without my partner or friends to keep an eye on me. Not that I needed it. I’m just really proud of myself. Drinking alone was my thing. And the fact that I could, but I choose not to when it is offered, is my best achievement so far.

I have developed a new compulsion that I am struggling with. I got a smart metre installed to get accurate billing for use of gas and electric. 

A few months later, I'm finding that it has really negatively impacted my mental health, or rather, has become a focus of my compulsions during a stressful few months. I find myself denying hot food because the cost of using the oven is high, or only allowing one coffee because boiling the kettle costs 2p a go.

I made a choice to turn it off, hoping that would help. But I have opened Pandora's box and am so aware of the cost of electricity and gas, that the now not knowing is preventing me from turning things on and hasn't helped.

The daft part, my logical self knows I wasn't spending a lot of money, it was well under budget. However, I am not sure how to switch this off in my own mind. Has anyone had a similar experience? Or have any ideas to help get past this? ",1,1734113795.0,OCD,0,1.0,False

It's 4:30 PM and I'm drinking with black Coffee with Espresso and smoking French Marlboro's. They're foetid. It's mid-March and I'm neither hot nor cold. A sottish looking Belluomo recognizes me from across the street and begins declaiming to us in a loud voice. I sense he's addressing me as the Genius from New England but I don't bother to translate fully his words. We neither address nor observe him and he passes away. I've been telling you that I wanted to go to Shakespeare & Co. I've told you three times now and I won't repeat myself. I feel an urge to cough, but I stifle it because I know how my cough embarrasses you. I haven't said a word all day. My throat. It was my idea to see Europe, but you were the one who made us go. You furtively eye me whenever I so much as move my eyes to read something or pick up the phone. You know better than to ask about that great Elephant, the Book, and I know this temporary elision will influence a bombastic announcement later, during the next argument. I breathe in deeply and tune my ears to the conversation of the young Girls in bloom at the table fronting us, in an attempt to exercise my penurious French. Their seating is markedly better than ours, and they sit next to a hedge spotted with early budding Mimosa, Lavender, and Fleur-de-Lis. And though the precocious Twilight is fairly overcast the Girls are tenented by a single beam of light that is golden, resilient, responsible, and gentle. I snap to attention and startle you with my best attempt at a smile.

Summary given in the description of the video:

""Shen Yu, you must sign the divorce agreement today. I can't stand by and watch you drag our daughter down. You’re a useless good-for-nothing, not worthy of my precious daughter."" In a villa in Shanghai, a middle-aged woman, her face twisted in anger, slammed a stack of divorce papers onto the coffee table.

At that moment, a man with delicate features sat quietly on the sofa, looking gentle and refined. His almond-shaped eyes, especially those peach blossom eyes, were so captivating that each glance seemed to draw people in.

He didn’t pay attention to the middle-aged woman. Instead, he turned his gaze to the stunning woman who was sitting against the wall in silence, not saying a word. She was none other than the rising star of the entertainment industry, the ""little queen"" of the music scene, and his wife, Lin Feiwan.

He spoke softly, his voice elegant and low, warm yet carrying a hint of weariness. ""Wanwan, do you want to divorce me?""

... Shen Yu had been in a parallel world for three years, married to the popular little queen Lin Feiwan for two years, happily living as a devoted househusband. Unfortunately, things didn't go as planned, and the divorce papers shattered his dreams.

After the divorce, Shen Yu originally planned to travel abroad to change his environment and relax. However, after a meal with his best friend, he was tricked into joining a reality dating show, ""Heartfelt Lovers,"" which his friend was leading.

Meanwhile, when the little queen Lin Feiwan found out about their divorce, she immediately joined a dating show to flaunt her new relationship, causing her to lose her composure.
