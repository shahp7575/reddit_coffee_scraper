So, tomorrow is my work crush’s bday. I’ve been trying to find an in with her because we’ve chatted at work but haven’t exchanged numbers or anything like that. I know what her order is for our local coffee shop, however, and I’m thinking of surprising her with it for her bday because we are both working tomorrow. 

My thing is, I don’t want this to be outwardly romantic, I just want to make a friendly effort so that I can get to know her more and maybe develop into something more. But is this too much? Is it better for me to message her on our work channel and ask her if she wants anything from our local coffee shop for her bday on my way to work? I’m very socially anxious, so I’m probably overthinking, but I’d love some advice. Thanks!",1,1768189203.0,whatdoIdo,0,1.0,False

We don’t work in same office but same department and place. Anyways she always rants to me about my manager and I always listen etc and this one particular day I had a small argument with him so I messaged her to rant about him and I was very heightened. Anyways she was trying to play devils advocate in her responses and give me reasons as to why he felt that way and I guess as I was heightened I was just expecting validation and support from her. I didn’t say anything aggressive or say she’s wrong I maybe just came across in a way where I wasn’t taking advice (which I know can be annoying). Anyways it’s been 5 days now and she’s been giving me the silent treatment (not texting me, not asking me for coffee or lunch and when she came in the office she barely made eye contact and talked to me like I was a coworker she didn’t really know) and I actually don’t know what I did that was so wrong I should be ignored (yes maybe I was annoying and not take any advice but even just telling me that would have been better). I have quite bad social anxiety and don’t take this kind of thing well, I’ve been feeling horrible and guilty for days but I am also too afraid to approach her now after that. I guess I want to know if she’s valid in her reaction to ice me out like this and do I need to be sitting here feeling guilty for 5 days or should I just cut my losses and move on? Thanks!

1qak6of,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qak6of/need_our_first_real_espresso_machine_and_grinder/,Need our first real espresso machine and grinder [$1000],"Currently my gf and I have a Nespresso pod machine and are wanting to upgrade. Deciding between the Bambino and the Plus, due to the ease of learning on and the entry level price point, which will allow me to throw more money on a higher end grinder.

I’ve read the auto steamer on the Plus is programed for dairy milk, which we don’t use. And that the Plus might not have the instant hot water like the original Bambino? With being able to upgrade the steam wand tip, it seems the biggest advantage to the Plus would be the solenoid. Not sure that it’s worth an extra $200, or even $300 if I got a refurb Bambino from Breville. Any thoughts on that or any reason the extra money would be worth the Plus? Getting the Plus would lower my budget for a grinder though.

The grinder is what I really need recommendations on. If I don’t get the Plus, I can throw about $700 towards a grinder. I need something that can do more than just espresso grinds as I make cold brew, pour overs, and French press coffee. I’m hoping that price range gets me something that’s durable that will last and can be repairable myself with easily obtainable parts from the manufacture.

Thanks in advance!

I got married to my wife about a year ago but I’ve known her my whole life because our moms and good freinds. We went on vacations together and family trips and went to each others houses before but we never really directly interacted but she is best freinds with my sister (24 female)and they hang out a lot and I end up getting dragged along to these vacations and trips by my mom because in her words I’m introverted and I need to get out more . About a year ago a couple months before I married my now wife my mom and dad were pressuring me to get married also just for context I’m a Muslim man anyways they were pressuring me to get married but I’ve never really put any thought into the idea of marriage. Anyways by one day I was at my sisters house because she just gave birth to twins a boy and a girl and I went over there to help out with the kids so my bil and sister could relax but when I got there my now wife was already helping out and just so everyone knows my now wife has always been a hijabi and I’ve never seen her hair before we got married but I will a see y she’s a very attractive women and she’s not only physically attractive but her personality is so attractive and she’s just pulls people in when she talks to them anyways but ya so she was at my sisters house holding on of the baby’s and I went and sat on the couch opposite them and held the other baby and I heard my wife complaining about how her parents and pressuring her to marry but that she was scared of marrying someone she didn’t know for a while and my sister was telling her to just tell her parents to give her time but my now wife was stressing about how her grandmother was sick and in risk of dying and she wanted to see my now wife married before she would pass on. After I heard her talking to my sister about the situation I kind of zoned out and started thinking about how my own parents want me to marry soon too anyways but then at the end of the day at like 8:00 pm my now wife and I both decided to say goodbye to my sister and go to our perspective homes but my now wife had taken a uber to my sisters house cause her car was in the repair shop so I offered her a ride to her place and she accepted because we’ve known each other for years and I’ve driven her home countless times and as I was driving her to her place we started talking a little and I brought up how my parents also want me to get married and I told her about how I also don’t want to get married any time soon and we fell into a soothe running conversation after that and I need dropping her home and she said bye to me and I left for my home and I thought that was the end of our conversation about the marriage thing but I was so wrong. Fast forward a couple days I get a text from a unknown number and it’s her asking if we can meet for coffee and I initially thought It was weird because we’ve never gone anywhere together 1 on 1 so I tried asking her what it was about but she just told me to meet her and she’d tell me then and to summarize what happened she brought up how our family’s wanted us to find partners to marry soon and how we didn’t want to and she brought up the idea of us getting married but only on paper and just acting like a loving married couple but in reality we would just be married to stop all the marriage nagging from our family’s and she talked about how we would live together and show up to family and friend events together to make everyone believe we want each other and I honestly agreed immediately because I didn’t hate the idea of marry her because I’m already familiar with her and I’ve known her my whole life. So fast forward a couple mourns me and my now wife tell our parents we want to marry and there ecstatic and happy because in there words they always wished we would ended up together and my sister also agreed with them and a couple mouths later after countless hours of wedding planning we finally tided to knot and got married and my wife moved into my house for context I’m a engineer and I make really good money enough for us to live comfortably and my house is 2 stories and 5 bedrooms and most of the rooms are just guest rooms for when family comes to visited but my wife ended up moving into one of the rooms now after e got married is when the problems started. I got to see my wife without her hijab and she’s georgeous every morning I wake up and she in he kitchen making herself coffee and I just look at her cause I can’t believe I married someone so attractive she was pretty before I saw her without her hijab but now it’s on a different level and I feel so sexually and emotionally attracted to her also I need to mention that she brought up the idea of going on dates every Friday to get to know each other better so we can be more convincing in our loving marriage act and we get along great we have so many things in common and shes just so great and we spend hours talking to each other and I’d like to believe that she’s attracted to me the same way I am her I mean I’d like to think I’m not a other but I’m 6’3 and I work out regularly y because I used to play football in collage and was always in the gym so even after quitting football I still go to the gym regularly and shes even told me on our wedding day that she find me attractive anyways but now that we live together she dresses more confortably jn like shorts and tank tops and these legging ad shirt sets and overall she looks so good and it just make me so attracted ti her anyways but we’ve been getting along really well but the breaking point came when she had a minor surgery that required Anastasia and i went with her to the hospital and she went into surgery and it was a very minor surgery and after a couple hours they cleared us to go home and she was still under he jnfluence of Anastasia and they said she’s would be for a while so I took her home and when we got home it was already dark out so I ordered food us so she could eat and as I was carrying her from the house to the car she was taking and making jokes and just being so sweet and silly and I was talking with her and I helped her to her room and we were laughing the whole way up because of her just being so silly anyways but when we got up to her room and she wanted to change her clothes but she was being very sloppy because of the Anastasia so I helped her out her clothes and omg it was the biggest struggle to hold back from touching her in a sexual way she was so georgeous and beautiful but ima move but I put new clothes on her and I went with her down stairs because she wanted to watch out show (we watch secret lives of Mormon wives together) and I ended up falling asleep and when I woke up the next day I was in her room in her bed and she was laying directly above me and we both woke up real quick and she ended up sitting up on my lap and she ended up feeling  my you know and her eyes went wide and she looked down and she jumped off me and her face was like bright red and she started saying she was sorry and she didn’t realize she was sitting on my (you know) and I pulls her closer and told her it’s natural and that she doesn’t  have to be embarrassed and one thing led to another after that and she said some things and I said some things  and we ended up kissing and good lord it was the best kiss of my life but also the only kiss I’ve ever gotten from a women but still the best and after she turned beat red and started rambling about feelings and then I started talking about feelings and we both came to the conclusion that we have feelings for each other and that we want to explore them more so I ended up taking her to go get dinner  at this place we both love and it was done of the best nights of my life after dinner we ended up going home and we changed and grabbed ice cream and went to go watch a movie (10 thugs I hate about you it’s her fav movie) and one thing led to another and we ended up doing the devils tango and god help me it was one of the best nights of my life. Anyways if you made it this far me and my wife are still going strong and we started to start a real relation ship and it’s going so great anyways but the moral of my story is that you can find happiness in the most unexpected places. ,1,1768188785.0,ArrangedMarriageR4R,0,1.0,False

1qak56v,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibew_apprentices/comments/1qak56v/did_i_do_the_right_thing/,Did I do the right thing?,"Myself (29yo/m 2nd year) and an old head JW (55+/f 40+year member) have had a bit of a ""cold war"" going on for about 2 weeks now. Firstly I will preface this with that I have been burned many times (part of other crews than this one) for doing what I'm told to do and what I was never told to do. By that I mean written up or chewed out for what happened at the time. Moving forward I have stuck to the old standard of I speak to and only take orders from the JW I am laid out with by the foreman during the PTP in the morning. If I am asked to do something during the day after being laid out with them, I ask my JW if its okay I take care of the new task for the person asking. There are general tasks for myself and another apprentice, we'll call him L for the sake of anonymity, in the crew to take care of daily. Such as remove trash, bring water bottles to the trailer we take break in, make sure coffee is made, clean the trailer, and gas the buggies (META job so we get pretty nice amenities).

 Fast forward to now, I'm attached to a new crew that I've been with for about 3 months now and I love it. I'm learning much more than I did before from very knowledgeable JW's. They know thier shit. They're also very knowledgeable about the union standards and follow them very closely, which is exactly what I wanted, to learn the union ways the right way. Previously I was attached to a pretty ratty crew filled with a bunch of freshly organized guys that didnt know the union ways quite yet themselves. That being said, this crew is a breathe of fresh air.

That brings us to now. We'll call the JW I'm putting heads with ""U"". U is from the old school ways. Meaning genuine abuse of the apprentices, talking to them like dirt, apprentices speaking to JWs only when spoken to. U has loosened those old standards a bit considering the crew were in. There were instances where there were numerous sly, passive aggressive remarks over the months that rubbed me the wrong way about the things L and I were doing or not doing up to U's standards. Silent tension on occasions that you could cut with a knife.

At times I was laid out with U for the day and there was a level of mutual respect during those times. That's all I wanted, was a bit of mutual respect. U saw that when I was asked to do something I did it promptly, adhering to the standard of ""workman-like manner"" which I hold dear. Told me at times that they were impressed by my knowledge of the union standards. All is good when were stuck together for the day.

Silent tensions grew, idk why. I don't belive I said or did anything intentionally or unknowingly to cause it. U used to have thier own buggy that they would work alone out of most of the time. That buggy broke down and a new foreman was popped up as our phenomenal previous foreman moved to GF. U had been generally happy with the buggy and old foreman. Ever since those 2 things changed U has been a nightmare to even ask simple questions to.

The new GF used to sit in a corner seat in the trailer. Once he moved up, I asked the other JWs in the trailer if they would like the seat before I moved over to it(it has a window that allowed me to get a single bar of service which is the only spot that o can get any in the trailer). So about 3 weeks ago I moved to that seat. On Wednesday last week U walks in the trailer first thing in the morning demanding I get up from the seat because it is now U's. My mind was at ""Fuck you, I asked and I've been here 2 weeks."" Sensibility took hold and after what felt like forever I simply stood up, gathered my things and put them in my tool bag outside in the gang box. I said nothing. I was kind of appaled at the abrasive manner that I was TOLD to get up. I will always give up a seat to a JW when asked. Nicely or not. Thats just the way it is. Everyone in the trailer heard the altercation. After the altercation the new foreman asked why I was sitting outside in the buggy. I explained the situation and asked to not be paired up with U anymore. I did preface my request with ""I am an apprentice, and I will follow your orders if you need me to be paired with them for the day. I will listen to and follow the same standards an apprentice always should with the JW they are laid out with."" He understood and agreed. Apparently there had been other issues with other people with U. He mentioned that, hut did not give details what those were. From understanding those also pertained to ""swing her dick around.""

Friday, it was early morning. I came in to find we were low on water and trash needed to be taken out. We needed about 6 cases of water. I walked over to L, which was right next to U's pilfered spot, and asked ""Hey L, you mind helping me bring some water in?"" I then walked out to get started. On my way back to the trailer, 3 cases of water in hand, U smoking a cigarette stopped me. ""You are not a JW. You do not tell MY apprentice what to do."" I simply said ""ok"" and kept moving. Apparently after I left the trailer U was in a bit of a fit over ""telling"" L what to do. Water is heavy. I just asked for help. With a task that both apprentices are expected to do without being asked. As I'm walking back after trash I see my foreman. He asks how my morning is, I tell him what just occurred. He said ""thanks for letting me know, I'll handle it.""

Apparently he discussed it with U. Also, other JW's that I spoke with about the situations had spoken to U about easing up as well. I only told 2 other really good brothers about what happened because I feel closer to them and I was looking for insight. Apparently after that U had decided to literally never speak to me again.

As of today, U did not speak to me at all and actively avoided me. Only speaking to other JW's passively within ear shot of me about things the crews apprentices are doing wrong. Its clear U didn't mean L. The only words I spoke to U were this morning when U hopped in the buggy to head back to the trailer were ""Are we expecting anyone else?"" All I got was silence. It's Sunday and not everyone works Sunday. I know U likes to get to the trailer early, but its more important to me that no brother/sister gets left behind. So I waited and waited until G hopped in. I asked G if we're expecting anyone else, he says no. I started to the trailer. Not to mention I've asked U not to smoke cigarettes in the buggy with me because they make my clothes stink and I don't smoke. U smoked 2.

This is not what I wanted. I did not want it to be this way. I know at heart U is a great sister. Very knowledgeable and a fantastic person to learn from. Strong union standards. Attention to detail and a mind to only install quality work. I genuinely believe that. I just needed the heavy handed bullshit to stop. I can deal with getting my balls busted and a deserved verbal lashing. Thats part of the gig. This was different though. Very intentional and very direct. I knew the views on apprentice speaking to JW that U has, so I took it to my foreman. 

I know this is a long read, so I appreciate anyone that took the time. So my question is, Did I do the right thing? If not what could I have done better?",1,1768188690.0,ibew_apprentices,0,1.0,False

1qak4dy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/1qak4dy/garmin_nutrition_update/,Garmin nutrition update,"I posted last week that I'd signed up for the trial of Garmin Connect+ due to the new nutrition logging. I also said I don't log religiously and that continues to be the case. So long term there will be little value, I think.

All that said I've had some surprising, in a good way, results and a head scratch moment.

**The main head scratcher:**

I can create ""My Meals"" by adding ingredients and giving g the meal a name. e.g. ""Coffee"" = espresso shot + 10ml cream. In the feed though, both ingredients are displayed. I'd expect to see only ""Coffee"". If I have 3 of these in the morning I get 6 entries. I can't see a way to collapse them into just their meal names. 

I would imagine this is an oversight and they'll fix it pretty quickly - or I am missing something. It's happened before! 

**The ""whoa"" (good) moments:**

1. I went to a frozen yoghurt chain the other day (Yo-Chi for those in Australia). You put the yoghurt into a tub then add as many toppings as you like. You pay by weight! The picture of mine is below! Garmin found most of the ingredients after just a few seconds of processing. (Gummie bears, Kiwi fruit, Chocolate flavoured sprinkles, strawberries, Frozen yoghurt, sugar free caramel).It can only asses what it set and some ingredients were hidden. But I was stunned at how accurate it was based on the challenges.

2. It also correctly identified any wife's home made biscotti.

3. The speed of scanning a barcode is so good, I was ""waiting for it"" and it had already correctly scanned the whey protein powder.

**Summary**

I'll let the subscription lapse. I don't obsess about logging food. I'll weigh something and then just eyeball it from there for later meals.

One spring day in Osavine, Claire Miller sat in the Miller Mansion’s cozy drawing room. She sat by the fireplace, reading an Anglic book with full attention.

Suddenly, a large envelope slammed onto the coffee table in front of her with a loud bang, the gust of wind stirring the hair by her cheeks.

“You don’t belong here. Get out of this house,” Ashley Miller shouted as she marched toward Claire.

“Ashley, what are you making a scene about now?” Claire’s voice was soft, but a slight frown touched her brow as she looked up at Ashley, her elder sister.

The Miller family had three children. Samuel Miller, the eldest, was in college. Ashley, the second, was in high school. And Claire was the youngest.

“Claire Miller, no, Claire Brown. You’re not my sister at all. Get out of here, right now, this minute.” Ashley pointed fiercely toward the door.

Claire went still. She picked up the envelope from the coffee table and opened it. Her eyes narrowed in shock. Inside was a document showing she was not a Miller by blood.

Adam Miller and Jennifer Miller stepped into the living room just then, with a shy, plainly dressed girl trailing behind them. The girl was about Claire’s age.

Claire rose to her feet, holding the document high. “Dad, Mom, is this true?” she asked, her voice trembling. She couldn’t believe the words on the page.

Jennifer’s eyes were red as she took Claire’s hand. “Darling, I can’t believe it either,” she said, her voice thick. “I’ve treasured you like a precious gem for fifteen years. How can you not be my own?”

Adam’s face was stern. “Since it’s a mistake, it must be set right,” he stated firmly. “Your real parents are outside, waiting for you.”

“Hurry up and go. This is my real sister,” Ashley cut in sharply. Pulling the quiet Livia Miller forward, she staged a tight, sisterly hug for Claire to see.

Livia kept her head down, as if she didn’t dare look Claire in the eye. But inside, she was laughing wildly. ‘I’m finally back. Last time, I was stupid and died soon after returning to the Millers. This time, I’ll make sure I stay as the richest man’s daughter.’

Claire looked at each of them, then gently pulled her hand away from Jennifer’s hold. “If it’s a mistake, then it should be fixed,” she said softly. Her voice was still sweet, but her tone was steady. Jennifer seemed unable to let go.

“Just get out. Go back to your poor family,” Ashley snapped. “You’ve got eight brothers who eat like they’ve never seen food. Watch out, Claire, your new parents might just sell you off for their sake.” She looked ready to drag Claire out herself.

Without another word, Claire walked straight out of Miller Mansion. At the gate stood a middle-aged couple waiting. The man wore work clothes, and the woman was dressed plainly.

Both of them were good-looking. When they saw Claire, their expressions grew complicated, but they stepped forward at once.

“Are you Claire?” asked Joyce Brown, Claire’s birth mother. After Claire nodded, Joyce took her hand. “Come, let’s go home.”

Henry Brown, Claire’s birth father, added, “Yes, let’s go home and talk.” And so, Claire followed her real parents back to where they lived.

\*\*\*\*\*

The Browns lived in a small, three-room rented apartment down an alley off Qranta Road, near Osavine High School. There were eleven people in the family altogether.

Before Claire’s arrival, the room arrangement had remained unchanged for years: her parents shared one, Livia had her own, and all eight brothers slept in the third.

The floor was peeling at the edges. The walls were scuffed, with a few old posters stuck to them. The room was full of worn-out things: a sagging couch, a shaky table, and an old TV.

Shabby as it was, the place was tidy and clean. It couldn’t have been more different from the grand Miller Mansion. In that moment, the huge gap between rich and poor felt real and stark.

“I know it’s not what you’re used to,” Henry said with a gentle smile. “Your mother always says education comes first. Every penny we earn goes toward the children’s schooling.”

Joyce nodded. “Just because we’re poor now doesn’t mean we will always be. If you and your brothers work hard at your studies, one day things will get better.”

Henry nodded eagerly. “Yes, your mom’s right about that.” Claire understood quickly: here, Joyce was the strict one, and Henry the soft one. Back at the Millers’, it had been just the opposite.

Joyce guided Claire to a chair. “Let me tell you how things are with us,” she began. “Your father works at a factory. He brings home about two thousand a month.

“I do some small business. My pay isn’t regular. Some months it’s a few hundred, others it can be four thousand. We rent this place. We don’t own anything, but we don’t owe anyone, either. And you have eight brothers.”",1,1768188505.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

One spring day in Osavine, Claire Miller sat in the Miller Mansion’s cozy drawing room. She sat by the fireplace, reading an Anglic book with full attention.

Suddenly, a large envelope slammed onto the coffee table in front of her with a loud bang, the gust of wind stirring the hair by her cheeks.

“You don’t belong here. Get out of this house,” Ashley Miller shouted as she marched toward Claire.

“Ashley, what are you making a scene about now?” Claire’s voice was soft, but a slight frown touched her brow as she looked up at Ashley, her elder sister.

The Miller family had three children. Samuel Miller, the eldest, was in college. Ashley, the second, was in high school. And Claire was the youngest.

“Claire Miller, no, Claire Brown. You’re not my sister at all. Get out of here, right now, this minute.” Ashley pointed fiercely toward the door.

Claire went still. She picked up the envelope from the coffee table and opened it. Her eyes narrowed in shock. Inside was a document showing she was not a Miller by blood.

Adam Miller and Jennifer Miller stepped into the living room just then, with a shy, plainly dressed girl trailing behind them. The girl was about Claire’s age.

Claire rose to her feet, holding the document high. “Dad, Mom, is this true?” she asked, her voice trembling. She couldn’t believe the words on the page.

Jennifer’s eyes were red as she took Claire’s hand. “Darling, I can’t believe it either,” she said, her voice thick. “I’ve treasured you like a precious gem for fifteen years. How can you not be my own?”

Adam’s face was stern. “Since it’s a mistake, it must be set right,” he stated firmly. “Your real parents are outside, waiting for you.”

“Hurry up and go. This is my real sister,” Ashley cut in sharply. Pulling the quiet Livia Miller forward, she staged a tight, sisterly hug for Claire to see.

It was a familiar type of ache. I asked him what he did and he flooded and entire pot of coffee with turmeric! Like why!

This boy (and i say boy because he has the maturity of a doorknob) would continue to have children and would get his girlfriend pregnant while being unemployed, and she is unable to work, living in the worst conditions possible. Their eldest is living with family members across the country, not even under their care because of money and poor living conditions. Would beg people on social media to give them money to pay for food for themselves and baby. Meanwhile the father cant hold down a job because of his attitude and refuses to work fast food due to ""allergies to coffee"". Which isnt true btw he is making excuses. Then had made posts about their baby not eating for 24 hours because they had no bottles etc. My heart felt for them to an extent but it was mind-blowing. 

This guy would message me and seek support but I always was a hard a** because I knew he kept getting his gf pregnant on purpose to have a large family, which has been his dream. Anytime id tell him he needs to financially be stable he would then say ""but I want a large family."" The intelligence is just not there. 

Sadly he would act all smart and prepared with grand plans and would try and make businesses but would always fail. He lost his license due to reckless driving and became dependent on Marijuana and would spend most of his limited government welfare funds on it. Needless to say, both parents are idiots and as a professional child educator im obligated to report regardless if im on or off shift. 

(It took over a year for anything to be done, thankfully the kids are out of their care.)

Why are people having babies if they arent financially prepared? Why are people having babies if they cant even feed themselves? (Plus their hydro was cut off so...no heat...which in my country is extremely unsafe)

I'm 24f and my bf is 21m. For background, I come from a broken up family where my mom does drugs and dad has remarried. My bf comes from a asian family who moved here years ago but my bf used to stay with his grandpa in his own country and came here 5 years ago after his death.

His family lives in neighborhood and they're pretty well off. He was brought up in a very kind and gentle environment. His grandparents are the best people out there who were polite and loving their whole life and that reflects in his behavior and personality too.

His english is still a bit offshore, it's adorable and really really endearing when he looks for words to describe his feelings but ends up saying those in the wrong pronunciation. He's the prettiest thing ever...like really really pretty and absolutely charming.

We met through community work and I immediately wanted to know him more. Luckily we hit off good and I asked him out 3 months later. It's been 2 years now and we're still together. And mind you, he doesnt have many friends coz of communication skills and he's kind of an introvert too.

Thing is....he's too polite and gentle. Almost like a pushover.  He's still studying but I got myself a job now so whenever I've some extra work, I tell him to do it for me and he does it without another thought. Whenever I ask for money when I run low, he gives it with a smile. Whenever I'm in a bad mood, I snap at him for asking if everything's alright. I snap at his mispronunciation, his mistakes with Grammer and sentences even though those arent even noticeable. I once threw a coffee down the drain coz I was pissed about my sister and then he messed up my coffee by trying to make try his 'back home' version of coffee.

Even for that he apologised later saying he shouldn't have pushed me for something I didnt want to do.

I hate it when people take a second look at him when we're out. He's pretty I know but he's mine right? And with how polite he is, he smiles at them and greets them nicely, unknowingly raising their hopes to approach him even more. 

These past few weeks, he's been learning crocheting to control his anxiety and he makes me the sweetest things like Keychains, bracelets and covers for my bottle. 

What made me hit him is..I know its really fcked up but I've been stressed immensely about my work place. The employees are judgemental and higher ups are too annoying so I'm pissed off most of the time of the day.

And when I come home, he immediately comes to my place and YAPS about his day and asks for mine, even brings me various new crochet stuff and mind you my desk and cupboard are now full of those little pretty things. I've started to get annoyed at those and want to tell him to stop but instead of telling him..Last night I just snapped and threw what he got me (a bow and cherry hairclip) out the window.

He was hurt and expressed it but chose the wrong word and that just..pissed me off more so I shouted at him to shut the help up. He was shocked, his face that I love so much had this..idk really confused and hurt look.

He stood up and gathered his stuff, apologised for coming but me being already worked up, I asked him where the hell was he going and he needs to sit his ass down until I calm down. 
I think he felt unsafe and kept muttering about now being not the time to talk and walked towards the door.

I dont know what came over me but I just yanked his hair and told him to sit on the couch and keep his mouth shut. He was scared, I saw the fear and idk..I think..I think I fed on it and snapped at him to sit and keep his mouth shut until I tell him to speak.

But he did open his mouth to say I was scaring him and he didn't feel good and I just, I dont know what happened but my anger flew off and I ended up slapping him while shouting at him to shut the hell up. Good thing...he pushed me off and ran away from me and my place.

I calmed down after an hour and two, realised what I did and how I treated him just for being loving and caring towards me. I went insane after hours and kept bombarding him with texts but he hasn't replied to any. I've tried calling but each goes to VM.

I know I'm the asshole here but I just wanna ask how do I fix it? Is there any chance to get him to forgive me? Coz i really really love him and I dont wanna let him go.",0,1768188228.0,AmIOverreacting,18,0.29,False
1qajz8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_somethinggoeshere2/comments/1qajz8v/the_little_black_church/,The Little Black Church,"""There are many types of greed, Charlie."" My father said, standing in my doorway.

He worked ten or twelve-hour days, six days a week. We barely talked. I'd find him passed out on the living room couch, or at the kitchen table with a beer, eyes on the newspaper but not really seeing it.

""The worst kind of greed is the greed of the rich man. A poor man, or a working man, we can get a little more than what we got and be thankful. A rich man? That hunger can never be filled. It's like a fire or,"" he struggled, looking for the right words, ""or a bottomless pit. No matter how much they get, they always want more. And the more they get, the more they want.""

I looked up from the floor, where I was sitting with a book for school. White Fang, I think. He had a beer in his hand. His eyes were rheumy, face flushed. A couple beers in, he'd get like this. He wasn't drunk, just tipsy enough to remember he had a son, and he needed to do Dad things, and dispense Dad advice.

""Dad, you should lie down."" I said, ""You look exhausted.""

He closed his eyes and nodded slowly. He was always exhausted.

""I love you, son. I know I don't say that enough, but I do.""

""I love you too, Dad,"" I replied.

We buried him the next summer. He fell asleep at the wheel and went into a ditch on his drive home from work. I was sixteen that year. Mom was, of course, devastated.

He had a whole storage unit of bits and pieces of his life, a storage unit that we couldn't afford anymore. Mom drove me out there one afternoon, a few weeks after the funeral. The stuff she wanted to save went into the trunk. Boxes and boxes of stuff. We went through everything. The air was thick with dust motes.

He painted in college. My father, who would sit with a thousand-yard stare at the dinner table after a brutal day at work, had been a pretty good artist back then. There were a couple of landscapes, a few portraits of people I didn't recognize, but that my mom said were distant relatives, and half a dozen paintings of the same building.

A little black church. It was squat, square, and plain. An unassuming building. The kind of tiny country church that could fit no more than a couple of dozen people. I knew my father was from the boonies, way out in the country.

""Mom, where is this church?"" I asked, tilting the painting up.

She glanced over and squinted at the painting. ""That's from when your dad was a kid. A church near where he grew up.""

""He went there?""

""I guess so. He painted it enough."" She turned back to the box she was sorting through. ""Your father didn't really talk about his childhood. I met him at college. He'd already left all that behind by then. He wasn't close to his family.""

I stared at the painting. Just a small, dark building in the middle of nowhere. We went to my Mom's folks every year. I'd never met my Dad's family. They had barely showed up at his funeral.

""That's what makes all these paintings so strange."" She paused, wiping the sweat from her forehead. ""He must have done them early in college, before we met. After that, he never painted churches again. Just landscapes. Pretty sunsets. Normal stuff.""

""You ever ask him about it?""

""A few times."" She stood there quietly, staring at nothing. ""He'd just change the subject. He was good at that.""

He was excellent at that.

I couldn't throw them away. Someday they'd end up in someone else's trash pile, forgotten. But not yet. I hung them in my bedroom. All six paintings, arranged on the wall above my desk, where I'd see them while doing homework. Mom came in one night, stood in the doorway looking at them. She didn't say anything for a long time.

""You really want those up?"" she finally asked.

""Yeah.""

She nodded and left. We didn't talk about them again.

Two years passed. The paintings stayed on my wall. I graduated, applied to colleges, got accepted. Mom wrapped each one in newspaper when I packed. Everything I owned went into the back of her car. She drove me three hours north and helped me carry the boxes up four flights of stairs to my dorm room.

Mom hugged me at the door. ""Call me on Sundays.""

""I will.""

She looked at me for a second, then left. I unpacked the paintings last. Hung them on the wall above my desk in two rows of three.

I called my mom most Sundays.

""How's school?"" she asked one Sunday in my junior year.

""Good. I'm graduating in May.""

""Your father would be proud.""

She always said that. I never knew if it was true.

""Hey, something weird happened last week,"" she said. ""Some of your dad's family showed up at the house.""

""What? Who?""

""I don't know. A man and a woman. They said they were his cousins. Wanted to go through his things, see if there was anything they could have. After four years.""

""What did you tell them?""

""I told them to leave. It felt wrong, Charlie. They weren't at the funeral. They never called, never sent a card. Now they want his stuff?""

I stared at the paintings on my wall. ""Did they say what they were looking for?""

""No. Just that they wanted something to remember him by."" She paused. ""They asked about you too. Where you were going to school, what you were studying. I didn't like it.""

""You didn't tell them anything, right?""

""Of course not. I'm not stupid."" She sighed. ""It just bothered me. Why now? What changed?""

I didn't have an answer for her.

I packed up my dorm room in May. Everything fit in the back of a borrowed pickup truck. The paintings came down last. I wrapped each one in newspaper, careful with the frames. I was carrying the last one down the stairs when my phone rang. I shifted the painting to one hand and dug my phone out with the other. My foot caught the edge of a step. The painting hit the landing before I did. The frame splintered.

""Shit.""

I crouched down and picked through the pieces. The canvas was fine, just some scratches. I pulled it free from the broken frame and something fell out. A piece of paper, yellowed and folded small. It had been tucked behind the canvas, invisible until now. I unfolded it. My father's handwriting.

>*Honey, If you're reading this, I'm probably dead. I should have burned these paintings years ago, but I couldn't. They're proof of where I came from, and I needed to remember why I left.*

>*I ran from that church. I had to. The things they believed, the things they did, I couldn't be part of it anymore. I couldn't raise a family there. I couldn't let them touch my life.*

>*If they ever come looking for you, don't go back. Don't try to understand. Just run like I did. Protect yourself. Protect Charlie. That's all that matters.*

>*I'm sorry I never told you. I thought if I stayed quiet, if I never mentioned it, they'd forget about us. Maybe I was wrong.*

My phone was still on the ground where I'd dropped it. I picked it up and called my mom back.

""Mom,"" I said. ""Tell me about Dad's family again. The ones who came to the house.""

""What? Why?""

""Just tell me.""

""They were strange. The woman did most of the talking. She had this accent, a really thick southern drawl. She kept smiling, but it didn't reach her eyes. The man just stood there and stared at me.""

""What did they look like?""

""Old. Fifty, sixty, maybe. Dressed like they were going to church. Very modest. Very religious looking, I guess.""

I looked down at the letter in my hand.

""Charlie, what's going on?""

""I don't know yet,"" I said. ""But I'm going to find out.""

I found a forum where people researched obscure religious movements. I posted a picture of one of the paintings and said I was looking for information about my father's childhood. Three days later, someone sent me an image. No message, just an attachment. A photograph of a handwritten list. Names in two columns, maybe thirty or forty total. Some had lines drawn through them. My father's name was third from the top. Crossed off.

I searched the marked out names. Found seventeen matches. All of them had been born in the same cluster of small towns. All of them had left and started new lives somewhere else. Then they vanished, or died under suspicious circumstances. Sometimes twenty years after they'd gone. Sometimes thirty. A sick feeling settled in my stomach. Maybe it hadn't been an accident.

A letter arrived two weeks later. My name and my apartment address written in neat, careful script. The postmark was from a town I didn't recognize, somewhere in the south. I opened it standing in my kitchen.

>*Dear Charlie,*

>*Your mother probably mentioned we stopped by to see her recently. We should have reached out sooner - we know it's been years since your father passed, and we're sorry we weren't there for you both during that time. We've been thinking about your dad a lot lately. He was family, even if we didn't always see eye to eye when he was younger. We'd love to share some stories about him with you, if you're interested. We have some old photographs we thought you might like to see. We'll be passing through your area next month for a church retreat. If you'd like to meet for dinner, we'd enjoy getting to know you. No pressure at all - we understand if the timing doesn't work. God bless, Thomas and Sarah.*

There was a phone number at the bottom.

I didn't call the number. I sat on my apartment floor with the letter in my hands. They knew where I lived. They knew where my mother lived, and they had a list with my father's name crossed off.

I packed a bag. I needed to figure out what was going on, and I was on my own.

I told my mom I was taking a road trip. Seeing the country before job hunting started. She thought it was a good idea, said I'd earned a break. I didn't tell her where I was going. Didn't tell her about the letter, or the list, or why I was really leaving.

The drive took two days. I could have done it in one if I'd pushed, but I didn't want to arrive exhausted. The landscape changed as I drove south. Flat farmland gave way to rolling hills, then thick forests that pressed close to the highway. Small towns appeared and disappeared, each one looking more tired than the last. I stopped for the night at a motel off the interstate. Sleep didn't come easy.

The next morning, I drove the last hundred miles. State highways, then county roads, then roads that barely had names. The trees got thicker. Houses became sparse, set back from the road behind long gravel driveways. I passed a hand-painted sign: ""Welcome to God's Country.""

Twenty minutes later, I found the town. A gas station, a post office, a Dollar General, and a diner that looked like it had been there since the 1950s. Everything else was houses and churches. Lots of churches. I drove through slowly. People on the sidewalk stopped and watched my car pass. Strangers probably didn't come through here often.

The motel was on the edge of town. Single-story, L-shaped building with maybe a dozen rooms. The sign out front said ""Trav-A-Lot Motel"" but the paint was peeling and half the letters were burned out. I sat in the car for a minute. If these people were as connected as I thought, they'd hear about a stranger in town. Probably already had. I'd register under my mother's maiden name. Pay cash. No paper trail.

I grabbed my wallet and went into the office. A bell above the door chimed. The woman behind the counter looked up from a crossword puzzle. ""Can I help you?""

""I need a room. Just a few nights.""

Her gaze was judgmental.  ""Passing through?""

""Something like that.""

""Fifty a night. Cash or card?""

""Cash.""

She pulled out a registration form and slid it across the counter with a pen. ""Fill this out.""

I made up an address in a town two states over. Left my real phone number in case I needed them to reach me.

She counted out the bills and handed me a key attached to a plastic tag with a faded number 7 on it.

""You here for work?""

""Just visiting.""

""Family?""

""Yeah.""

She nodded and wrote out a receipt. ""Well, welcome to town. There's a diner down the road if you need a real meal. Everything else closes by eight.""

""Thanks.""

I took the key and went to find my room. Thin carpet, floral bedspread that didn't match the curtains, a TV bolted to the dresser. The bathroom was small but clean. I dropped my bag on the bed and sat down. My phone had one bar of signal. I pulled up the image of the list, stared at it for the hundredth time. My father's name, crossed off. All those other names. Some crossed off, some waiting.

I was here. Now what?

I decided to get food first. Figure things out on a full stomach. The diner was easy to find, right on the main road. Half a dozen pickup trucks in the parking lot. I went inside. The conversations dropped when I walked in. People looked up, then went back to their meals. I sat at the counter.

A waitress came over, an older woman with gray hair pulled back in a bun. Her name tag said ""Linda.""

""What can I get you, honey?""

""Coffee and a burger. Whatever's good.""

""Everything's good here."" She smiled. ""You just get into town?""

""Yeah. Staying at the motel for a few days.""

""Visiting family?""

""Something like that,"" I said.

She nodded and went to put in my order. I sipped my coffee and looked around. The walls were covered in old photographs. The town in different eras. My burger came. I ate it slowly, listening to the surrounding conversations. Mostly talk about work, weather, whose kid was doing what. Normal small-town stuff. But there was an undercurrent I couldn't quite place. The way people's eyes would flicker toward me, then away. The way conversations seemed to pause when I shifted in my seat.

I paid my bill in cash and left. Drove around for a while, getting my bearings. Eventually found the church, about three miles outside town. Set back from the road behind a chain-link fence, just like in my father's paintings. Small, square, black-painted wood. A gravel parking lot with weeds growing through the cracks. No sign out front. No indication of what it was called or when services were held. I didn't stop. Just drove past, slow enough to take it in. I headed back to the motel.

The sun was going down. I stood at the window and looked out at the motel parking lot. Two other cars besides mine. No one moving around. The whole town felt like it was shutting down for the night. Tomorrow, I'd go to the church. Try to blend in. Find out what they wanted. Find out what my father had been so afraid of. Tonight, I tried to sleep.

I woke up before the alarm, showered in the tiny bathroom, and put on the closest thing I had to church clothes. Dark jeans, button-down shirt. I looked at myself in the mirror. I looked like my father. Same jaw, same eyes, same way of standing with my shoulders slightly hunched. If anyone there remembered him, they'd recognize me. If someone did recognize my face, I could claim distant relation, say I was looking into family history. Give myself room to back out if things felt wrong. It wasn't much of a plan. But it was something.

I drove to the church at nine-thirty. Service started at ten. The parking lot had maybe a dozen cars in it. All older models, all clean despite the dirt roads. I parked at the edge and sat there for a minute, hands on the wheel. This was stupid. I should turn around, drive home, forget about all of it.

The front door was propped open. I could hear singing inside, voices raised in a hymn I didn't recognize. I walked up the three concrete steps and went in. The interior was plain. Wooden pews, maybe fifteen rows. A simple pulpit at the front. No stained-glass, no decorations except for a large wooden cross on the wall behind the pulpit.

Maybe twenty people scattered through the pews. Families mostly. A few older couples. Everyone dressed modestly. I was underdressed. A few heads turned as I walked in. An older man near the back gestured to the empty space beside him. I nodded and sat down.

The singing continued. I didn't know the words, so I just stood there while everyone around me sang. The hymn ended, and everyone took a seat. A man at the front, middle-aged with thinning hair and a kind face, stepped up to the pulpit.

""Let us pray.""

Everyone bowed their heads. I did the same. The prayer was long. Standard stuff about grace and mercy and walking in the light. Nothing that raised any flags. When it ended, the preacher launched into a sermon about the Book of Revelation. The end times. The tribulation. How the faithful would be saved and the wicked would face judgment.

Halfway through, people started speaking in tongues. Just a few at first, scattered through the congregation. Nonsense syllables that rose and fell in rhythm with the preacher's words. Then more joined in. Within a minute, maybe half the room was doing it. I'd seen speaking in tongues before. It usually lasted a minute or two, then people would quiet down. This didn't stop. It built. Got louder. The voices started to synchronize, falling into the same rhythm, the same cadence. It stopped sounding like random utterances and started sounding like a chant.

The preacher kept talking, his voice rising to be heard over the congregation. But he wasn't trying to quiet them. He was encouraging it. His words shifted from English to something else, the same nonsense syllables everyone else was speaking. The air in the church felt thick. My head started to ache, a dull pressure behind my eyes.

The woman in front of me was shaking. Her hands raised, her head thrown back. The sounds coming from her mouth didn't sound human. I wanted to leave. But getting up and walking out would draw attention. So I stayed in my seat and tried to breathe through it.

The chanting reached a peak, then suddenly stopped. Complete silence. The preacher lowered his head, placed both hands on the pulpit. When he looked up, he was smiling.

""The Spirit is with us today, brothers and sisters. Let us give thanks.""

Everyone murmured agreement. The woman in front of me sat down, calm now. The preacher stepped down from the pulpit. The service seemed to be ending. People started to gather their things, shake hands, talk quietly among themselves.

Behind the pulpit, a door at the back of the church opened. A man stepped through. He wore a white suit. Immaculate, spotless. He also wore a pale mask that covered his entire face. No features, just smooth white surface with two holes for eyes.

The congregation went quiet again. The silence changed into something reverent. Expectant. The man in the mask walked slowly to the pulpit. His gaze swept across the pews, row by row. When his eyes passed over me, I felt a weight, like something pressing against my skull.

""Brothers and sisters,"" he said. His voice was deep, southern accent thick and smooth. ""We gather here in the shadow of the Almighty. We stand at the edge of eternity. The great work continues, and we are blessed to be part of it.""

He raised one hand.

""Let us give thanks for what has been provided. Let us prepare for what is to come.""

The congregation responded in unison. It wasn't exactly words. More like a low hum that vibrated through the building. I felt it in my chest, in my teeth. The man in the mask began to speak. It wasn't English or tongues. Something stranger. The sounds were incomprehensible, syllables that didn't fit together, rhythms that made my head pound harder.

Images flashed in my mind. Something moving in darkness. Something vast and wet and ancient. Movement in the deep. Something rising. Something hungry.

I closed my eyes. Tried to block it out. But closing my eyes made it worse. The image was clearer in the dark. The chanting ended abruptly. I opened my eyes. The man in the mask was looking directly at me. For several seconds, neither of us moved. Then he lowered his hand and stepped back from the pulpit. He turned and walked through the door behind him. It closed with a soft click.

The congregation started moving again. People stood, gathered their things, headed for the exits. Like nothing unusual had happened.

The man beside me stood and offered his hand. ""Welcome. I don't think we've met.""

I shook his hand. ""Charlie. Just visiting.""

He nodded slowly. ""You look familiar. You got family around here?""

""Distant relatives, I think. I'm trying to track down some family history. Thought I'd start by visiting local churches.""

""Well, you came to the right place. Lots of old families around here."" He smiled. ""I'm Tom. You should come back for evening service. Six o'clock. More informal. Good chance to meet people, ask around about your folks.""

""I'll think about it.""

""You do that."" Tom patted my shoulder and walked away.

I stood there for another minute, waiting for my head to clear. The pressure was fading, but slowly. Like something was reluctant to let go. I walked out into the parking lot. The sun was too bright. I squinted against it and got in my car. My hands were shaking. I gripped the steering wheel until they steadied. I'd seen something. Or felt something. I didn't know which. But it had been real. There was something in that church. Something that responded when they called to it.

I drove back to the motel and sat on the bed, staring at the wall. Evening service was at six. I had a few hours. I wasn't going back for evening service. I'd seen enough. Now I needed to see what they didn't want visitors to see. I needed to come back at night.

I spent the afternoon at the diner. Coffee and pie I didn't touch. Linda refilled my cup. A few locals nodded at me. They'd seen me at the morning service. By the time I got back to the motel, it was almost dark. I sat in my room and waited. Watched the clock tick past six, past seven, past eight. Evening service would be over by now.

I changed into dark clothes. Jeans, black t-shirt, hoodie. Put my phone in my pocket, made sure it was on silent. The drive to the church took ten minutes. I killed my headlights a quarter mile out and coasted the rest of the way, parking on the shoulder behind a stand of trees. The church sat dark against the night sky. No cars in the parking lot. No lights in the windows. I watched for five minutes. Nothing moved.

I got out and walked across the parking lot, staying low. The front door was locked. I circled around the building. The back had a small window, the kind that tilted out for ventilation. It was latched, but the latch looked old. I found a rock in the gravel and used it to tap at the frame until the wood splintered enough for me to work the latch free. The window swung open. I pulled myself up and through, landing hard on the floor inside.

I was in a storage room. Shelves lined the walls, stacked with hymnals and boxes of candles. A door on the far side led into the main sanctuary. I pulled out my phone and turned on the flashlight. The sanctuary looked different at night. The cross on the wall behind the pulpit seemed larger somehow. I walked down the center aisle.

The door behind the pulpit. That's where the man in the mask had come from. I walked up the steps to the platform and tried the handle. Unlocked. A narrow and dim hallway lay beyond. My phone's flashlight only reached so far. I could see another door at the far end, but nothing else. I walked forward. The hallway smelled like damp earth. The door at the end opened to a stairwell. Concrete steps leading down into darkness. The smell was stronger here. I covered my nose with my sleeve and started down.

The stairs went deeper than they should have. One flight, then another, then another. The temperature dropped. The walls changed from concrete to rough stone. Water seeped through the cracks, making everything slick. At the bottom, a tunnel. Carved through rock, shored up in places with old timber beams. Electric lights hung from the ceiling every twenty feet or so, bare bulbs that cast weak yellow light. Someone had been down here recently. The lights were on.

The tunnel opened into a chamber. It was large, maybe the size of a gymnasium. The ceiling was high, disappearing into shadow. The floor sloped down toward the center, where there was a pit. Around the pit, symbols had been carved into the stone. Geometric patterns I couldn't quite understand. My eyes kept sliding off them.

And at the edge of the pit, there were people. I ducked behind an outcropping of rock. Counted maybe a dozen figures in dark robes, standing in a circle at the edge of the pit. They were chanting, the same low hum I'd heard during the service. It resonated through the chamber, through my bones. In the center of the circle, the man in the white suit and pale mask. Kneeling in front of him, hands bound, was a girl in white shorts and a tee shirt. She was blindfolded. She was crying, trying to pull away from the hands holding her. But the people in robes didn't let go.

The man in the mask raised his arms. The chanting grew louder. Something in the pit answered. It rose slowly. Pale shapes in the darkness, glistening wet. My eyes tried to follow the edges of it, find where one part ended and another began, but the edges kept moving. Reorganizing. A surface that might have been skin split open and folded back on itself. Something that looked like a milky and unfocused eye rolled to the surface before sinking back down into the mass. A cluster of what might have been tentacles emerged from a different section, flexing and curling before they were absorbed back into the whole.

It was massive. What I could see peeking over the edge was just a fraction of it. The rest extended down into the pit, into depths I couldn't comprehend. Pain spiked behind my eyes. I pressed my palms against my temples. The pressure didn't help. My vision blurred at the edges. I blinked hard. The thing was still there, still rising. My teeth ached. My jaw was clenched so tight I thought something might crack. I tried to relax it, but couldn't. A high-pitched ringing started in my ears. Under it, a sound like static. Or wet things moving against each other.

I started shaking. I felt like I was outside my body looking in. They pulled the blindfold off. The girl saw the abomination and began screaming, snapping me back to awareness.

The robed figures lifted her and carried her to the edge of the pit. She fought, but there were too many of them. They held her over the edge, suspended above the thing below, then threw her down. The thing began to descend back into the pit, taking the girl with it. Her screams faded as it pulled her down into the darkness. Down and down and down, until I couldn't hear her scream anymore.

The robed figures lowered their heads. The man in the mask stepped back from the edge. Every head turned toward me. I must have made a sound. Or maybe they'd known I was there the whole time. The robed figures moved calmly and deliberately toward me.

I staggered backward, away from the outcropping. My legs felt like they weren't working right. I tried to run, but my body wasn't responding. I made it a few steps before my legs gave out. Hands grabbed me. Pulled me upright. I didn't fight. What was the point?

They dragged me back toward the pit. I thought they were going to throw me in. Feed me to that thing like they'd fed the girl.

But they didn't. They pulled me past the pit, toward another tunnel I hadn't noticed. Deeper into the earth. The man in the mask walked beside me. He didn't say anything. Just watched as they carried me away.

The last thing I remember before the darkness took me was a white rag, reeking faintly of something chemical, covering my mouth. Then nothing.

Whatever they had used to drug me was wearing off, but my mind still felt thick. My awareness slowly floated up out of the pit of black velvet it had been stewing in. I was hanging by my arms from overhead. I looked up. Thick chains bound my wrists and dug into my skin. A gag filled my mouth that tasted faintly of rubber. I tried to swallow but couldn't. A single naked light bulb hung above me, casting deep shadows around the rest of the room.

I had completely fucked up. I knew what rooms like this were used for. I knew what was coming. The metal door creaked open, and the man with the pale mask and the crisp white suit from the ceremony walked in. He cocked his head to the side and smiled a joyless smile.

""I'm going to break you, Boy. And there's nothing you can do about it.""

It almost sounded ridiculous in his deep southern accent, like I was being threatened by Colonel Sanders. But there was absolutely nothing funny about the quiet malice in his voice. He circled around me, dragging something long and thin that I couldn't quite make out across the bare floor. The anticipation made my guts feel cold and twisted.

I heard the first strike whip though the air before it landed. Across my shoulders, a line of burning pain. I jerked and twisted against the chains as my back exploded into fire. A cane. A bamboo cane. Shit.

""You came here thinking you'd be the one, Didn't you?"" He kept circling. ""The one to expose us. The one to save everyone.""

His voice seemed to jump around. Sometimes close to my ear. Sometimes behind me. Another strike, lower this time. I strained against the chains biting into my flesh.

""You're what, twenty-one? Twenty-two? You've been alive long enough that you think you understand how the world works. You have no fucking clue.""

Three vicious strikes, one right after the other. My screams were muffled by the thick gag. I tried to focus, but between the pain and the drugs, my mind felt soft.

""You were careful, I'll give you that. Thought you'd covered your tracks."" His voice stayed level, almost bored. ""You thought you were smarter than the people who've been doing this for thirty fucking years.""

He stopped, and I heard him take a deep breath.

""The arrogance of youth, you can't help it."" The end of the cane tapped against my skull. Once. Twice. ""You still think you're special.""

""Nobody's coming for you, and nobody knows where you are."" He was in front of me now, crouching down. Through the pain and the tears, the mask was just a blur of white. ""And in a week, nobody will remember they should be looking.""

He stood. Started circling again.

""You'll understand eventually. If there's enough of you left to understand anything.""

Time stopped meaning much after a while. They took my clothes and gave me an over sized pair of joggers and a tee shirt to wear. They'd move me from the room with the chains to a cell. Brick walls, no windows, a metal door with a slot for food. Then back to the room with the chains. The cult leader would come. The cane would come out. I'd scream until my voice gave out, then scream some more. Sometimes it was the cult leader. Sometimes it was others. Men in robes, who didn't speak, just did what they were told. They gave me water and enough food to keep me alive, but that was it.

I lost track of how many times they dragged me back to that room. The days bled together, but I'm sure it had been almost a week. Then one night, or maybe it was day, I heard footsteps moving past my cell. I went still. The lock clicked quietly. The door eased open an inch. I caught a flash of a light blue eye and part of a face that looked familiar. The footsteps kept going. They faded down the corridor.

I stared at it a while. This had to be a trick. A test. They were watching to see if I'd try to run so they could punish me worse. But I was already broken. What more could they do?

I pulled myself to my feet using the wall. Every movement sent fire through my back. I stepped into the hallway. The tunnel branched. I took the path that sloped upward. Figured up was good. Up meant surface. Up meant out.

I heard two voices ahead. One of them was the cult leader. I'd know that smooth southern drawl anywhere. The other voice was unfamiliar. Pleading. I followed the sound.

The tunnel opened into the chamber with the pit. The same place I'd watched them feed the girl to that thing. The same place they'd dragged me past after they caught me.

Only two people this time. Just the man in the white suit standing at the edge of the pit, and another man on his knees in front of him. The kneeling man was older, maybe fifty, with my father's eyes, my father's face. I knew without being told. This was the person who'd sent me the list. This was family.

The cult leader had a gun. He was talking, his voice calm and measured, explaining something to the man on the ground. I couldn't make out the words. Then he raised the gun and fired. The sound echoed through the chamber. My distant relative fell forward, clutching his stomach.

I ran at him. My legs barely worked. I stumbled once, caught myself, kept going. The cult leader heard me at the last second, started to turn. I tackled him with all the strength I could manage. My shoulder drove into his ribs. He went over the edge.

For a split second, I thought I was going down with him. My momentum carried me forward, my feet skidding on the wet ground. Then I caught my balance before I went over too. He fell. The pale mask came loose and fluttered away from his face. Just an old man. White hair, deep wrinkles, eyes wide with terror. His white suit bright against the darkness below. He didn't scream. Or if he did, I couldn't hear it over the sound of something moving in the deep. Something rising to meet him.

I staggered over to the man laying on the ground. He looked so much like my father it hurt. He was still breathing. Shallow, wet sounds. Blood spread across his shirt.

""Go,"" he whispered. His eyes found mine. Same shape as my father's, but lighter. ""Go now.""

""I can't leave you.""

""You have to."" He coughed. More blood at the corner of his mouth. ""Tell people. Tell them what happens here.""

From the pit, sounds. Screams and wet, ripping noises. Then nothing. He fumbled at his pocket. He pulled out keys, pressed them into my palm. ""My car. Blue Ford. Parking lot. Clothes, wallet, phone. Everything you came here with is in the trunk.""

""Come with me.""

""Can't."" His breathing was getting worse. ""I'm sorry. About your dad. About all of it. I should have…"" Another cough. ""Should have done this years ago.""

""What's your name?""

He smiled. Blood on his teeth. ""Daniel.""

""I'm Charlie.""

""I know."" His eyes started to close. ""Run, Charlie.""

I wanted to stay. Wanted to tell him it was okay, that he'd done enough, that he'd saved me. But footsteps echoed from the tunnel. Someone was coming.

I ran.

Back through the tunnels. Up the stairs. I burst through the door behind the pulpit, into the church sanctuary. Early morning light came through the windows. The front door was locked from the inside. I flipped the bolt and ran outside. The parking lot was empty except for a few cars. A blue Ford. Twenty years old, rusted around the edges. I got my stuff out of the trunk, and started driving.

I didn't know where I was going at first. Just away. But after an hour, I realized I was heading north. Toward home. Toward my mother. I needed to warn her. I had to tell her everything. But more importantly, to make sure she was safe.

I drove for hours. Stopped once at a gas station, used the bathroom to wash the worst of the blood off. The clerk stared at me but didn't say anything. Once I was back on the road, I tried to call my mother three times. No answer. She was fine. She had to be fine.

I crossed the state line as the sun was setting. Two more hours to home.

My phone rang. Unknown number. I almost didn't answer.

""Hello?""

""Is this Charlie?"" A man's voice. Official-sounding.

My stomach dropped. ""Yes.""

""This is Detective Garrett with the county sheriff's department. I'm calling about your mother, Sandra. There's been an incident at her residence. We need you to come to…""

""What happened?""

""Sir, I think it's better if we discuss this in person. Are you in the area?""

""What happened to my mother?""

Silence on the other end. Then: ""There was a fire. I'm very sorry.""

The rest of the conversation was white noise. I don't remember what he said or what I said back. I remember pulling over to the side of the highway. Sitting there with my hands on the wheel. Staring at nothing.

Then I was driving again.

I pulled onto my mother's street just after nine. The house was dark. The roof was gone. The walls were blackened shells. Yellow crime scene tape stretched across the front yard. A single patrol car sat at the curb, but no fire trucks. No ambulances. They'd already taken her away. I parked and got out. Walked toward the house like I was in a dream. The patrol officer got out of his car when he saw me approaching the tape.

""Sir, this is an active investigation.""

""That's my house,"" I said. ""My mother.""

""Hold on."" He pulled out his phone, made a call. Spoke quietly for a minute, then hung up. ""Detective Garrett is on his way. Should be about twenty minutes. You want to wait in your car?""

I shook my head.

The officer went back to his car but kept watching me. I sat down on the curb across the street. The smell of burned wood hung in the air. Wet ash. Chemicals from whatever the firefighters had used. A neighbor's porch light came on. Mrs. Patterson from two doors down. She came out in her bathrobe, saw me, and started crying before she even made it across her yard. She sat next to me on the curb. Said she'd seen my mother just yesterday morning, they'd talked about the garden. She'd seemed fine. Happy, even. Then last night, around seven, she'd smelled smoke. Called 911. By the time the trucks got there, the whole house was engulfed.

Detective Garrett arrived fifteen minutes later. Got out of an unmarked sedan, walked over to where I was sitting. Structure fire. Arson investigator. My mother's body. I'm so sorry for your loss.

I asked when it happened. He checked his notes. Yesterday evening. They'd already won. Before I even pushed their leader into the pit, they'd already taken what mattered.

I stood there and stared at the ruins of the house where I'd grown up. Nothing was left. The detective asked if I knew of anyone who would want to hurt my mother. Any threats, any unusual contact in recent weeks.

What could I say? That a cult in the middle of nowhere fed people to a monster underground, and they killed my mother to tie up loose ends? He'd think I was crazy. Or in shock. Or both.

So I said no. Said I couldn't think of anyone. Said my mother was a good person who didn't have enemies. He gave me his card. Told me to call if I remembered anything. Said they'd be in touch.

I sat on the curb until the police left too. Until it was just me and the burned house. My father had run from that church to protect his family. He'd spent thirty years keeping his distance, never looking back, never mentioning it. I'd undone all of it in a few weeks because I found a letter and thought I deserved answers, and my mother had paid the price.",1,1768188219.0,u_somethinggoeshere2,0,1.0,False

I just don't know what to eat. I know I'm supposed to eat a lot of protein, avoid Vitamin C and coffee and whatever else within an hour or whatever of taking my meds. But what the hell am I supposed to eat throughout the day?

  
I typically take my meds around 7am. I have an aversion to eating breakfast too early in the morning since it makes me queasy/nauseous. Before my meds, I would make a high protien oatmeal pack and bring it to work with me so I could eat around 9/9:30, then eat around 1:30 for lunch, and eat dinner when I got home somewhere between 6/7pm. This was fine.

  
Now that I'm medicated again I cannot figure out what to eat. Eating a full high protein breakfast at 7am is not feasible for me, but if I don't eat anything I'm a jittery mess and my meds don't last a full day or  it's almost like I burn through them too fast. I did start doing some protein shakes first thing in the morning which seems to help, but it's not a good replacement for actually eating. If I eat too many carby things I just feel crappy overall, which never used to be the case. My normal lunch of leftovers from dinner the night before isn't cutting it either. I'm snacking on beef sticks throughout the day just to up the amount of protein I'm taking in, but then I'm not eating enough fiber. (And I don't really love the idea of eating beef sticks all the time). 

  
Should I be doing yogurt, granola, and fruit in the morning? Should I be doing salads with some kind of protein for lunch? I'm honestly not even sure where to start. This whole thing has been a little overwhelming and I'm still playing the medication lotto for dosing so who knows what I'll look like in another two weeks even. 

  
Any help or suggestions are absolutely appreciated. I plan to ask my doctor in two days for any recommendations, but I'd love some tips or tricks along the way.",1,1768188071.0,adhdwomen,4,1.0,False

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1qajthc,https://i.redd.it/ja6niobz5ucg1.jpeg,"Whoops Babe! Your 'Dream Life'? Built with MY Money, MY Man, MY House!","Scrolling through my phone on the way back from my OB appointment, I clicked on a link in our local moms' group without thinking.


The post? ""CEO husband + perfect baby boy = my blessed life! Beverly Hills living! #SpoiledWife""


I was about to roll my eyes and keep scrolling when—


My finger froze.


The photo punched me right in the gut.


Some young, drop-dead gorgeous woman held a toddler, both grinning like they owned the world. Behind them? That stupidly tender look…


My husband.


The location tag showed MY grandmother's estate. The one she had left to ME.


My heart was pounding now, but here was where it got really good:


I knew exactly who this bitch was.


Remember that ""poor struggling college student"" I had sponsored through four years of university? The one who had sent me that weepy thank-you letter about ""working hard to give back to society"" and ""never forgetting my kindness""?


Yeah. Her.


Guess she had found her own way to ""give back.""


I pressed my hand against my six-month baby bump.


My smile was ice-cold.


Oh, sweetheart. You had no idea what was coming for you.


My hands were shaking so bad I could barely hold my phone.


I kept zooming in on that photo. On his wrist—the watch I gave him for his thirty-ninth birthday.


The way he was looking at them. At her and that kid.


Like they were his whole damn world.


I hadn't seen that look in two years.


The comments section was pure chaos.


""STOPPP your husband is gorgeous wtf""


""This is what dreams are made of omg""


""Beverly Hills mansion + hot CEO husband + perfect baby = you're living my fantasy life""


And Little Miss Homewrecker was eating it up, replying to everyone:


""He's just really good to me ♥ I'm so lucky""


He's just really good to me.


I wanted to throw my phone through the windshield.


My stomach lurched. Hard.


I shoved the car door open and barely made it to the curb before I was puking my guts out.


""Jesus—Mrs. Blackwood! You okay? Should I take you to the ER?"" Charles, our driver, scrambled out with a water bottle.


I waved him off, rinsed my mouth, and got back in the car.


Every part of me felt like ice.


Our house sat behind the gates of Ridgemont Estates—old money, new money, the kind of neighborhood where everyone minded their business because they all had secrets.


Margaret, our housekeeper, met me at the door. ""Oh honey, you look like death. What did Dr. Morrison say?""


I looked at her. Really looked at her.


""Margaret... has Grayson actually been at the office these past few weeks?""


Her face gave her away before she even opened her mouth.


""That's... that's what he told me to say, Mrs. Blackwood.""


Right.


In this giant house, I was the only idiot still buying his bullshit.


I walked upstairs like a zombie.


Our bedroom was pristine. Magazine-perfect. Cold as a morgue.


Nothing about it said home. Nothing said he actually lived here anymore.


I opened his closet. Rows of suits lined up like soldiers. Everything in its place.


I pulled open the top drawer of his dresser.


A blue velvet box.


Next Wednesday was our ninth anniversary.


Was this supposed to be for me?


Nine years.


We'd started with nothing. A shitty apartment and ramen dinners and dreams bigger than our bank account. I watched him build his company from the ground up, deal by deal, all-nighter by all-nighter.


Six years ago, when everything almost fell apart—when his competitors came for him and things got ugly—I was the one who stepped in front of that knife.


That knife took our first baby.


It took any chance of me having another.


The doctors said my uterus was too scarred. Getting pregnant again was basically impossible.


Which made this baby—this absolute miracle inside me right now—the best anniversary gift I could've ever given him.


I took a breath and opened the box.


A massive diamond ring stared back at me. Blinding. Beautiful.


Empty.


My phone lit up.


Grayson calling.


Chapter 2


I stared at his name on my screen.


Grayson.


My chest felt like someone had reached in and was squeezing my heart with their bare hands.


I let it ring three more times before I answered.


""Hey.""


""Liv."" His voice was smooth as always. Tired, though. Distracted. ""Listen, I've got this international call tonight. Gonna be late. Don't wait up, okay?""


Another call. Another late night.


There was a time when he'd call me before bed no matter what. When he'd talk to me until I fell asleep.


Now? I got a courtesy heads-up like I was his assistant.


I gripped that cold diamond ring until my nails dug into my palm.


""Gray... do you remember what next Wednesday is?""


Silence.


Then I heard it—a woman's voice in the background, sweet and syrupy:


""Gray, who are you talking to? Come help me, Theo can't get his Legos to work...""


He covered the phone, but I could still hear him: ""I'm handling something. Take Theo and get him ready for bed.""


When he came back on, his voice had an edge.


""It's just an anniversary, Liv. Does it really matter that much? Work's insane right now. I'll have my assistant book us somewhere nice and send you something. Sound good?""


My voice came out shaking.


""Grayson. Are you lying to me?""


He sighed. Hard.


""Jesus Christ, Olivia. I'm out here busting my ass for this family, and you're gonna start with the paranoid bullshit again? I'm exhausted. I'm hanging up.""


Click.


The line went dead.


I set my phone down slowly.


Looked at that diamond ring sitting there like a joke.


And I laughed.


Right. How could I be so ungrateful?


He gave me everything money could buy. Designer clothes, luxury cars, a house most people would kill for.


What more could I possibly want?


Except he had no idea what I actually wanted.


Nine years ago, we were splitting instant ramen in a basement apartment. He told me, ""One day I'm gonna get you out of here. Big house. Huge diamond. The whole thing.""


I'd laughed and said, ""I don't need a big house or a diamond. I just need you to keep loving me like you do right now.""


He'd pulled me close and whispered ""I love you"" over and over until I believed it was permanent.


Turns out nothing's permanent.


And that girl I'd helped out of the goodness of my stupid heart?


She'd found her own way to say thanks.


I barely slept that night.


When I did, I dreamed of knives and blood and babies I'd never hold.


Two days crawled by.


On the third morning, I woke up early.


Sat at the breakfast table with my phone.


She'd posted again.


A selfie this time—full makeup, glowing skin, and on her hand?


That ring. The one from the blue velvet box.


The caption read: ""Thank you babe for the early bday gift ♥ Love you so much! Next Wednesday can't come fast enough!""


Next Wednesday.


Her birthday.


More important than our nine-year anniversary, apparently.


That ring was never meant for me.


I stared out the window at the bright morning sun.


I'd never felt colder in my life.


I grabbed my coat.


""Charles. We're going to Beverly Hills.""


Chapter 3


A young nanny opened the door.


She stared at me for a second, then her face went guarded.


""Can I help you?""


I stepped past her into the entryway.


Two pairs of slippers sat neatly by the door. Men's. Women's.


In the living room, a toddler—maybe two years old—was playing on a foam mat, babbling ""Dada, dada"" over and over.


Every word felt like a needle straight through my chest.


I couldn't breathe.


""I'm here to see Grayson Blackwood.""


Footsteps on the stairs.


She came down wearing a silk robe, all soft and sleepy-looking. When she saw me, panic flashed across her face for half a second before she rearranged it into something pitiful.


""Oh my god... Mrs. Blackwood?""


I looked around slowly.


Family photos on the walls. The three of them, smiling. Baby bottles and toys scattered on the coffee table.


This place looked like an actual home.


More than mine ever did.


""Natalie,"" I said, my voice ice-cold. ""I paid for four years of your college. Was this how you planned to pay me back?""


Her face went sheet-white. Her lip trembled.


""Mrs. Blackwood, I... I don't know what you're talking about...""


""No?""


I pulled out my phone and shoved the photo in her face—the one she'd posted. Her and Grayson and that kid.


""Then explain this. My husband. My grandmother's house. Where's your conscience, Natalie?""


Tears spilled down her cheeks. She dropped to her knees like someone cut her strings.


""I'm so sorry! I'm so, so sorry! It's all my fault! I just—I love him so much, I couldn't help myself! Please, Mrs. Blackwood, please forgive us!""


She was sobbing now, looking like some tragic heroine.


Once upon a time, maybe I would've felt bad for her.


Now? I just felt sick.


""Love?"" I laughed. It sounded ugly. ""Your love is built on someone else's pain. On betrayal. You call that love?""


I looked down at her, perfectly calm.


""Natalie. Playing house in someone else's home? That's got to have limits. This house is mine.""


Her face crumpled. Fresh tears. The full performance.


""Mrs. Blackwood, you don't understand—Gray and I are really in love. He told me... he said you two don't even have feelings for each other anymore. That he only stays because of obligation.""


""Really in love,"" I repeated slowly. ""So your 'real love' is built on wrecking someone's marriage? In my dead grandmother's house?""


""I... I didn't know it was yours."" She bit her lip, tears streaming. ""Gray said he bought it for me... Mrs. Blackwood, please, don't be mad at him. It's all my fault. If you're angry, yell at me—just don't fight with him. He works so hard already...""


What a saint.


I stared at her pathetic little act and realized something:


I didn't want to fight with her.


She wasn't worth it.


The problem was never her.


It was him.


I pulled out my phone and called Grayson right in front of her.


He picked up on the second ring.


""Liv? What's wrong?""


""Grayson."" My voice was steady. Cold. ""You've got thirty minutes to get your mistress and your kid out of my house.""


I hung up.


Natalie's face went from white to gray.


Less than two minutes later, tires screeched in the driveway.


Grayson came through that door.

Sorry this might be a little long. I’ve had issues with low blood sugar since I was a kid. Usually going too long without eating or skipping breakfast and passing out in class. About  5 years ago I developed reactive hypoglycemia and these episodes include the shaking, weakness and full blown want to rip my clothes off kind of hot (and sometimes I do!) with profuse sweating that leaves me drenched. Like night sweats but awake. I’m female, 5’9’’ 178 lbs, 48 years old. I’ve had a lap-band since 2013 and used to be morbidly obese at 371 lbs. The episodes are getting more frequent (about once a week) and it’s usually because I go a long time without eating and then have something carb dense or really sugary. But last night scared the crap out of me. I’ve been restricting calories and thought I was eating fairly healthy this week. I’ve been trying to have small meals with a lot of protein. Last night was a takeout night so I had a half of a Chick-fil-A sandwich and half of the medium fries at 7 pm. 10 pm I had protein pudding (1 g of sugar) and a built bar smore (half Built bar and 2 graham crackers. I was also sipping on coffee with regular creamer. I curled up on the couch with the hubby and dog wanting to go to bed but couldn’t make it that far. I wasn’t shaking just not feeling right but thought I was just tired. I was closing my eyes off and on when the hot feeling started. I jumped up to get the glucose monitor I had just bought and was pouring with sweat by the time I took it. It was 39. Now I’m freaking out because what if I was sleeping? And why did it even happen? I’m a bit of a control freak and feel like I have no control over this now. Also I’ve known my blood sugar was low when I had these episodes but didn’t think it would be scary low like that. I ate some candy and got it up but I’m really concerned that it could happen when I’m sleeping. And if I am sleeping will my body raise my BS on its own or do I have to eat something? I’ve also been having night sweats a lot but I figure that’s due to my age. Any advice is appreciated. I’m trying to figure it all out. I talked to my doctor a couple of months ago and she said sounds like hypoglycemia so make sure to eat something every couple of hours and get a glucose monitor. I’m keeping a food diary when it happens. I guess maybe what I thought was eating healthy isn’t really healthy? ",2,1768187703.0,Hypoglycemia,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1qajqy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivinginPhoenix/comments/1qajqy3/living_in_downtown_phoenix_guide_2026/,Living in Downtown Phoenix Guide (2026),"# Everything You Need to Know About Living in Downtown Phoenix

**Why this is not a copy-paste take**

I grew up in Phoenix and watched downtown change from an “event zone” into a real neighborhood. This post reflects that context plus practical, on-the-ground details people ask when considering a move to Arizona.

**Q: What’s it like living in Downtown Phoenix?**  
A: Living in downtown Phoenix is a walkable, entertainment-rich, and transit-connected experience, but it comes with city realities like higher property crime, visible homelessness, and limited grocery stores.

I grew up in Phoenix. Not the Instagram version, the real one. For most of my childhood and teenage years, downtown Phoenix was not a place you “hung out.” You went there for a Suns game, maybe a concert, and then you left. **If you stayed after dark, people assumed either your car broke down or you were making questionable life choices.** Slight exaggeration, but not by much!

Back then, downtown was mostly government buildings, office towers, and sports venues surrounded by surface parking lots. The idea of meeting friends for dinner downtown on a random Tuesday night would have sounded about as realistic as dial up internet making a comeback in today’s world.

Fast forward about 40 years, and especially the last 15, and downtown Phoenix has undergone one of the biggest transformations in the Valley. It’s no longer just an event zone. It’s a real neighborhood now, with residents, schools, grocery stores, culture, and daily life happening well beyond game nights.

**Here’s what living in downtown Phoenix actually looks like today.**

# How has Downtown Phoenix changed over the years?

For decades, Phoenix developed outward, not upward. Suburbs exploded and downtown stagnated. That started changing in the late 2000s and accelerated after 2010 with major public and private investment: light rail expansion, ASU’s downtown campus, sports venue upgrades, residential towers, and arts-focused redevelopment around Roosevelt Row.

The opening of ASU’s Downtown Phoenix campus in 2006 brought a permanent student and faculty population. Valley Metro Light Rail began service in 2008, connecting downtown to Midtown, Tempe, and later Mesa ([Valley Metro Rail](https://www.valleymetro.org/)).

Since roughly 2010, downtown Phoenix has shifted from a pass-through district to one of the Valley’s primary entertainment, cultural, and urban residential hubs. Since 2020 alone, downtown has added more than 5,000 apartment units, with tons more planned or under construction.

# Where Downtown Phoenix Is Located

Downtown Phoenix is generally defined as the area bordered by McDowell Road to the north, 7th street to the west, Buckeye Rd to the south, and 7th ave to the east. But as a Phoenix native, we call downtown everything within the freeway circle of the I17 to the I17 to the 10 and the 10. In this blog though, Ill be pushing a bit further north to chat about everything below Thomas. I want to give you real insight from people who have lived here forever (me!), not some generic AI output or info from people who have never even been downtown. So, within the boundaries I mentioned above are Encanto, Willow, Coronado, Roosevelt Row, the Warehouse District, Portland St, the Central Avenue corridor, the civic and government core, and ASU’s downtown campus.

# Neighborhoods for Living in Downtown Phoenix

Roosevelt Row and Evans Churchill sit on the north and northeast side of the core and are where you’ll find the highest concentration of newer mid-rise apartment buildings, bars, coffee shops, murals, galleries, and First Friday traffic. If you want to walk to art, cocktails, and restaurants, this is the “I actually live downtown” zone most people picture. (For official downtown updates and initiatives: [Downtown Phoenix Inc.](https://dtphx.org/))

The Warehouse District is south of Washington and Jefferson near the ballpark. It’s where you’ll see more converted industrial character, newer high-rise clusters, and heavy event energy on game nights. It feels more sports and concerts than tree-lined neighborhood.

Portland Street is a real micro area people mention now because so much housing and retail has stacked up right around it. Broadstone Portland is one of the main examples. The vibe is apartment-forward with quick access to Roosevelt Row, Hance Park, and the light rail.

**Encanto sits north of the downtown core** and is where Phoenix starts to shift from true urban density into classic Central Phoenix. Encanto Park and Encanto Golf Course anchor the area and give it a very different feel from the warehouse districts and high-rise clusters downtown. More grass. More mature trees. More “old Phoenix.”

**Encanto Village** is not a single neighborhood. It is a large, official City of Phoenix Urban Village — a planning district used for zoning, transportation, and long-term growth. Encanto Village covers a wide area that includes parts of Midtown, major corridors along Central Avenue, institutional uses, parks, museums, light rail stops, medical offices, apartments, and multiple residential pockets. When the city says “Encanto,” this is usually what they mean.

**Encanto historic neighborhoods** are specific residential pockets within or near that larger village. Encanto-Palmcroft is the best-known (wide, palm-lined streets and early-20th-century architecture like Tudor Revival, Spanish Colonial, and Mediterranean). Encanto Vista and Encanto Manor are smaller, primarily post-war areas with Ranch and mid-century homes and close proximity to the golf course and park. In short: Encanto Village is the big planning area; the historic neighborhoods are the character-driven residential sections inside it.

**Willo Historic District sits just just northwest of the downtown core**. It’s early-1900s through mid-century homes, historic overlays, and big pride-of-ownership energy. People who want character and a yard but still want to be minutes from downtown often end up looking here.

**Coronado is east of Central and north of the I-10 corridor,** full of historic bungalows, block construction, and remodels. It’s one of the most popular “I want central Phoenix, not suburban Phoenix” neighborhoods because it’s close to downtown without being in the middle of downtown.

**Garfield is closer to the downtown edge and still changing fast**. It has older homes, new builds, and infill. It’s one of the neighborhoods where you feel the transition in real time, street by street.

# Housing Options in Downtown Phoenix

# Apartments

**Downtown is primarily an apartment market.**

As of late 2025:

* Average rent: approximately $2,000 per month
* Studios: approximately $1,450
* One-bedroom: approximately $1,850 to $1,950
* Two-bedroom: $2,500 and up
* Sources include RentCafe, Zumper, and on-site property listings.

Examples of current downtown properties include Altura on Pierce, Camden Copper Square, Brix Warehouse District, Union at Roosevelt, X Phoenix, Aspire Fillmore, and Broadstone Portland. Newer high-rise developments are concentrated near Central Avenue, Roosevelt Street, and the Warehouse District.

More current pricing examples that people actually ask about, because these names come up constantly:

* Altura on Pierce tends to show wide rent ranges by unit type and floor, with studios and one beds commonly listed in the mid $1,000s and premium units higher.
* Broadstone Portland is often marketed as a Roosevelt Row and Hance Park adjacent building and regularly lists one and two bedroom pricing across the mid $1,000s into the $2,000s depending on unit size and timing.
* X Phoenix is one of the higher-profile high-rise style communities downtown and tends to price above older mid-rise stock, especially on larger units and higher floors.
* Union at Roosevelt is right in the center of Roosevelt Row foot traffic and typically sits in the newer-build pricing tier.

Prices fluctuate monthly and do not include taxes, parking, or amenity fees.

# Condos and Townhomes

Limited but available. Most are concentrated near Roosevelt Row, Central Avenue, and the Warehouse District.

Prices typically range from the mid-$300,000s to $700,000 and higher depending on the building, views, parking, and HOA structure.

Inventory is far smaller than apartments, which keeps pricing relatively firm.

If you want condo and townhome living instead of a lease, you usually end up shopping in a few predictable places:

* Mid-rise condo style buildings near Roosevelt Row and the arts district core.
* Central Avenue corridor buildings where you trade a monthly HOA for views, security, and walkability.
* Townhome pockets on the downtown edge, especially as you move into Coronado and parts of Encanto and Willo where the built form shifts from towers to smaller attached housing.

# Single-Family Homes

Rare within the downtown core, but available in adjacent historic neighborhoods such as Roosevelt Historic District, Willo, Encanto, and Garfield.

These areas offer early-20th-century homes, tree-lined streets, and historic preservation overlays. Prices often range from $600,000 to well over $1 million depending on condition, lot size, and historic designation.

Willo tends to skew higher because the historic district brand is strong, the streets feel established, and the home styles are the kind people move here for: pre-war and mid-century homes, brick and stucco, bigger lots, mature landscaping, and a real neighborhood grid you can walk.

Encanto can jump fast because of the park and golf course proximity and the feel of the area.

Coronado is often slightly more accessible than Willo but still not “cheap,” and it has a huge number of 1930s to 1950s bungalows and block homes that remodel well.

Garfield is where you can still see more price spread because it’s actively changing, and the mix of original homes, flips, and new infill varies block by block.

# Crime and Safety (The Real Version)

Downtown Phoenix has higher reported crime rates than suburban Phoenix, particularly for property crime. This is typical of dense, urban cores. ([Phoenix Police Crime Statistics](https://www.phoenix.gov/police/resources-information/crime-stats-and-maps))

Violent crime exists but is concentrated in specific pockets and tends to be situational rather than random. Most residents report that daily life feels safe when using basic city awareness.

The homelessness crisis is visible downtown. “The Zone,” a large encampment, was cleared in 2023, but homelessness remains an ongoing citywide issue rather than one isolated to downtown. (City resources: [City of Phoenix Downtown Development](https://www.phoenix.gov/communitydevelopment))

Sources include Phoenix Police Department crime statistics, the Maricopa Association of Governments, and the City of Phoenix Human Services Department.

# Walkability and Transportation

**Downtown Phoenix is one of the most walkable areas in the Valley.**

* Light Rail costs $2 per ride and connects downtown to Midtown, Uptown, Tempe, and Mesa.
* Walk Scores typically range from 70 to 90 depending on location.
* Bike infrastructure has expanded significantly around Roosevelt Row, Central Avenue, and the downtown core.
* Driving times during off-peak hours are approximately ten minutes to Sky Harbor Airport, five to ten minutes to Midtown Phoenix, fifteen minutes to Tempe, and twenty to twenty-five minutes to Scottsdale.

Traffic is light by big-city standards but heavier during games, concerts, and festivals.

# Entertainment, Sports and Nightlife

Living downtown puts you near the Suns, Mercury, and Diamondbacks. The Suns and Mercury play downtown at the arena that was formerly Footprint Center. The Diamondbacks play at Chase Field. These venues anchor downtown and are a major reason the area stayed relevant even before people lived there. (Arena naming coverage: [AZFamily](https://www.azfamily.com/))

Major concert and performance venues include Arizona Financial Theatre, The Van Buren, Crescent Ballroom, Orpheum Theatre, and Symphony Hall. It is realistic to walk to NBA games, WNBA games, MLB games, concerts, comedy shows, and festivals. That was not a thing when I was growing up.

**Big recurring events that actually change traffic, parking, and the feel of downtown:**

* First Friday on Roosevelt Row.
* Diamondbacks home stands and big weekend series.
* Major touring shows at The Van Buren and Arizona Financial Theatre.
* Large conventions and expo weekends tied to the Phoenix Convention Center.
* Holiday events and seasonal markets that concentrate around CityScape, Heritage Square, and the Roosevelt corridor.

# Restaurants, Bars and Coffee

**Downtown Phoenix is now one of the strongest food districts in the Valley.**

Standout restaurants include Pizzeria Bianco, Bacanora, Wren and Wolf, Flour and Thyme, Sottise, and Cornish Pasty Co., which has been a downtown staple long before the area’s resurgence became obvious.

Bars include Bitter and Twisted, Little Rituals, The Theodore, Valley Bar, and the downtown AZ Wilderness taproom. Several have received national recognition for cocktail programs.

Local coffee shops and daytime spots include Lola Coffee, Songbird Coffee and Tea House, Futuro, Xanadu Coffee, Press Coffee, and Fair Trade Cafe, which also doubles as a local art space.

Yoga and wellness exists downtown in a way it simply did not when I was younger. A lot of residents treat Hance Park and the Roosevelt corridor like their daily routine zone: coffee, walk, class, work, repeat.

# Arts, Culture and History

Roosevelt Row remains Phoenix’s primary arts district, filled with murals, galleries, studios, and boutiques. First Friday, held monthly, is one of the largest recurring art walks in the country and draws tens of thousands of people.

Downtown is home to major cultural institutions including the Phoenix Art Museum, the largest art museum in the Southwest with over 20,000 works, and the Heard Museum, founded in 1929 and internationally respected for Native American art and history. ([Phoenix Art Museum](https://phxart.org/) • [Heard Museum](https://heard.org/))

Burton Barr Central Library is a five-story, 280,000-square-foot civic anchor featuring an interior water feature, gallery space, and public study areas.

The Arizona Science Center is downtown and is one of the most underrated “normal life” amenities for people with kids or visiting family. It’s also right next to Heritage Square, which is one of the few places downtown where you can still feel older Phoenix architecture without trying too hard. ([Arizona Science Center](https://www.azscience.org/))

The Children’s Museum of Phoenix is also downtown and is one of those places locals actually use on weekends when you have toddlers and you need to burn energy without melting outside. ([Children’s Museum of Phoenix](https://childrensmuseumofphoenix.org/))

St. Mary’s Basilica is downtown and it’s one of the clearest reminders that Phoenix is not just new build subdivisions and strip malls. It’s one of the most photographed churches in the city for a reason. ([St. Mary’s Basilica](https://stmarysbasilica.org/))

# Historic Hotels and Buildings

Hotel San Carlos still operates and hosted Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe. Westward Ho was once Phoenix’s tallest building and housed numerous Hollywood figures. The Luhrs Tower, built in 1929, remains one of the city’s best examples of Art Deco architecture. The Orpheum Theatre, also opened in 1929, continues to host performances under its original ornate ceiling.

Hotel San Carlos is also one of the most talked-about “haunted” locations downtown. The haunting stories are local legend and part of the building’s pop culture identity.

More historic places people forget to mention when they copy and paste the same four buildings:

* Heritage Square and the Rosson House area, which is one of the best preserved pieces of old Phoenix in the downtown footprint.
* Union Station and the old rail influence, which matters because transportation shaped early Phoenix growth patterns long before light rail was a thing.

Downtown Phoenix has one of the highest concentrations of preserved historic architecture in the Valley.

# Schools, Demographics and Daily Life

ASU’s downtown campus houses programs in journalism, public service, nursing, law, and health sciences. Public K-12 schools within the core are limited, with more options in adjacent neighborhoods. Charter and private schools are available nearby.

Downtown residents skew toward professionals, students, creatives, and empty nesters, though the demographic mix continues to broaden as more housing comes online.

Encanto and Willo pull a different demographic than the apartment core. More long-term owners, more established households, more people who want a yard and a historic home but still want to be close to downtown. Coronado splits the difference with a mix of owners, renters, remodel buyers, and people who want central Phoenix but do not want a tower.

# Grocery Stores and Practical Realities

Grocery access remains a weak spot. Fry’s Food and Drug opened downtown in 2019, becoming the first new downtown grocery store in over fifty years. A Safeway on McDowell Road serves nearby neighborhoods but is not walkable for most residents. Smaller markets and specialty shops exist, but downtown is not grocery-dense.

The real downtown grocery reality is still this: most people either plan their trips or they supplement with delivery, smaller markets, and convenience shopping.

# Middle Housing and What It Could Change

Arizona passed a middle housing law that pushes cities toward allowing smaller multifamily housing types in more places. What that means in normal person language is more legal pathways for duplexes, triplexes, fourplex style housing, and similar “in-between” housing in areas that were historically locked into single-family zoning. ([Arizona State Legislature HB2721 summary](https://www.azleg.gov/))

How it could affect areas around downtown within the parameters of the law:

* Coronado, Garfield, and parts of the downtown edge are the most likely to see more small-scale infill and redevelopments that are not full high-rises.
* It can increase housing supply gradually without requiring a tower.
* It can also increase teardown pressure in some pockets if land values support redevelopment.
* It will not instantly change Willo and Encanto the way people on the internet pretend it will, because historic overlays, lot patterns, and neighborhood politics still matter in real life.

# Is Downtown Phoenix Worth Living In?

**Downtown Phoenix today is walkable, cultural, entertainment-rich, and transit-connected. It is still evolving.**

**It is not suburban, quiet, grocery-heavy, or free of urban issues.**

If you want a true urban lifestyle in Arizona, downtown Phoenix is the closest thing the Valley offers. And as someone who watched it go from a place you avoided after dark to a place you walk to dinner and a concert, the change is real.

If you’re deciding between downtown and other Phoenix neighborhoods, experience matters. That’s where I come in. Reach out to schedule a meeting and I’ll be sure you find your perfect home AND your perfect neighborhood.

**Is downtown Phoenix walkable?**

Yes. It’s one of the most walkable areas in the Valley, especially around Roosevelt Row, Central Avenue, and the downtown core.

1qajphe,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qajphe/late_night_bus_ride_to_the_coast/,Late night bus ride to the coast,"(Always looking for constructive criticism) 

During the 80’s I was a bus driver in the Pacific Northwest and I would drive a route that went from Portland all the way to the coast. I did this for about a year and while the job was great for me and my lifestyle, I wasn’t able to continue for very long after an interaction I had during the fall of 1984 with a passenger who introduced himself as Randy. My typical route started in Portland at the grand central station and would take OR 6 all the way out to Tillamook and then a short trip on some less known roads to the ocean. I had stops all along the way but 99% of the time I would only be dropping people off, never picking up. One day in late fall of 1984, I was on a friday night run out to the coast.

 If you've ever driven to the coast, you know that once you get away from Portland it's basically just farmland and dense rainforest until the ocean pops up. This particular night was very foggy, the kind of fog that dances around your bus as you drive through it. Visibility was poor, so I was driving a bit slower than I usually do. The sky was a deep dark glacial blue and the tall pines on both sides of me casted a really dark shadow on the road.

	Now I don’t typically have any stops out in an area like this because it’s so far from any major hubs that it just wouldn’t make sense. With everything being so dark, I can see up ahead the red amber glow of some taillights on the freeway, blinking. Someone was up ahead seemingly broken down and their hazards were on. I thought to myself, who the hell would be out here at this time of night? As I approached, I didn’t see anyone near or around the car. I slowed way down and instinctively threw on my hazards just to be cautious, but with the darkness I honestly wouldn’t have seen someone if they were by the truck unless they were waving a light. 

Out of nowhere just as I pass the truck I see a figure standing up from a crouched position waving their arms like a crazy person. I slow down to a stop thinking this person might be injured or having an emergency. The doors hiss as they open, and the lights in my bus wash over this man, he's about 6 feet tall, pretty good looking, a bit dirty and out of breath. He stares at me almost shocked for a minute and I ask him “need any help?”. He doesn’t say anything for a few moments but he’s looking directly at me. Something in the look on his face made my skin crawl, and I started to have doubts about my decision to stop. Finally he responds with “yeah I uhhh i’m having some issues with my truck, any chance you’re headed to Portland?” I told him that I was actually headed towards the coast and before I could finish, he cut me off and said “that’s okay too” with a warm smile. Looking back on that now, that should have been the first indicator that there was something more happening than just a simple truck breaking down.

 I motioned for him to come onto the bus, and as he steps up he asks me “how’s the route been for you tonight?” I replied and told him it’s been as easy as could be, and I made a move with my arm suggesting he take notice of the fact that no one else was on the bus. A very awkward and uncomfortable 15, maybe 20 seconds went by where he just kept looking around the bus almost like he was looking for someone or something. It was at this time that I noticed he had a particularly unpleasant smell about him. He looked a bit dirty, but he smelled like he had been out there for a while, a lot longer than a day or two. He didn’t say anything else and he went to the furthest seat in the very back corner of the bus to take a seat. 

 I continued on driving, a bit uneasy but mostly confused as to why this guy was out here and why he was crouched off to the side of the road in complete darkness. I relaxed my hands a bit on the wheel, taking note that they were gripping hard enough to cut off circulation to my fingers. There is no particular reason to suspect this guy of bad intentions yet, but my entire system is going off. I take another brief glance away from the road, up into the mirror above the windshield to see where he’s at. My heart skips and I feel like I got punched in the stomach when I see that he’s not only standing right up at the front of the bus, but he had been looking at me in the mirror while I was driving. My knee jerk reaction is to look back down at the road and right as my eyes hit the horizon he asks me a deeply concerning question “Usually there’s a lady that drives this route right? I can’t think of a time where I saw you out here before” Every alarm is going off in my head and I don’t even know what to reply with. My gut tells me to feed him a lie and end this conversation. “Yeah I don’t know honestly, I rarely get to see my coworkers so I don't know who else drives this route.” He nods his head slowly a few times, almost agreeing with me as he stares down the road ahead. Another long, silent pause. Going against my better judgement, I looked up in the mirror again and he did the exact same thing, almost like he was trying to anticipate my next move. He asks me how long I have been driving and if I have ever seen something strange out there.  

Somehow, I blurt out exactly what I was thinking. “Honestly you’re the first thing out here that has ever caught me off guard” his charismatic smile drops and is replaced with a seriously dark scowl. “Do you think I'm suspicious or something?” Now I have to land this conversation somehow without getting on his bad side and it feels like I am dangerously close. I start to feel my breathing get heavier. “No I don’t think you’re suspicious, I was just surprised to see someone out here at this time of night that’s all” This situation is rapidly escaping my control and I can feel myself backing into a psychological corner. He replies “Do you think I am a good person?” and I am at a loss for words. I started to plan what I can do if he attacks me. “No of course not, I think we’re both good people just having a conversation”. What he says next escalates the situation way further than I wanted to go. “Well you know sometimes bad things happen to good people right?” I look up and he’s just staring at me again in silence, suddenly he cracks a big smile and goes “I'm just kidding, I'm sorry. My sense of humor can sometimes throw people off.” and abruptly goes and sits down. All I can think is what the fuck is happening. I could radio in and try to call for the police but what if he hears me? I didn’t want to be strangled by this guy while I am driving this bus. He pulls the cord to request a stop on the bus. We’re still about 30 minutes from any population hub, but there's a campground nearby where he could go find someone else to talk to. At this point, I just want him off of my bus. Once we are close enough to the streetlights that mark the camping grounds, I ask him if this is where he wants to get off and he says “yeah this is good enough.” The doors hiss open again and I catch another whiff of the smell coming off of him. He thanks me for my time and for picking him up on the side of the road, and he asks me if I know if they've made any progress on finding that missing girl from a few weeks before. I was so glad he wasn’t on my bus that the question honestly went right over my head and I replied with a simple “I don't know of any missing girl honestly” and he smiles and nods. I close my door and drive off as he gives me a very unsettling wave goodbye. Taking one last look in my rear view mirror, I could see that he was still there just holding the waving position in the dark. Out loud, I ask myself what just happened. That whole situation felt like a fever dream. Never before had I been forced into such a terrifying and awful conversation with someone. 

I finished my run out to the coast and turned around to head back to Portland. On the way back, I pass by the campsite and he's nowhere to be seen thankfully. Further down the road, I start to get nauseous as I get closer to his truck. In a surprising and very scary turn of events, the truck is gone. In its place was a station wagon, filled with camping equipment. Now I knew something was up. This whole situation has felt off since the beginning and I know I need to file a police report when I get back to town. The rest of the trip home is all normal and I get off work and head home for the night. A couple days after the matter, I went in to file a police report for this guy's strange behaviour and the string of abandoned vehicles in the same part of the middle of a forest at night, and the police officers I spoke to got very serious, very quiet. They looked at each other with wide eyes and then asked me if I got his name. I told them it was Randy and they said that they appreciated my help and would reach out if they needed anything else. 

	A few weeks pass, and I am listening to the local news on the radio in the morning getting ready for my route. The newscaster is talking about the discovery of a missing girl just off of the OR6, the freeway I drive on my runs to the coast. They mentioned that they also had a suspect for the murder of a family at a campsite and the theft of their station wagon, his name was Randall Woodfield. My coffee cup shatters on the floor and shocks me out of my state. I started shaking with fear. I started to piece everything together and it sent me into a long spiral of depression and anxiety.

	That was the end of my time being a bus driver. My paranoia since this event has skyrocketed. I didn’t think I would ever come that close to interacting with someone who could truly be as evil as this man was. You never know what people are holding inside of themselves. Their secrets, their regrets, their desires. Please be careful when you are interacting with strangers, and if your gut tells you that something is wrong then you should absolutely listen to it. I could have prevented the murder of that family if I had radioed for police that night instead of waiting. Be careful out there. ",1,1768187461.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Her and her mom are very judgemental and I've gotten into fights with my bff about my life choices. While I was over her mom started asking me questions about my life and I told her about me focusing on school and she seemed very judgemental in her tone and responses but I didn't say anything to her about it in the moment because I know my bff had already told her everything I was telling her.

1qajoix,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qajoix,Breeding/genetics question,"Miss thing was surrendered to me because she was severely anemic,  bloated, malnourished,  and suffering from seizures.  Her mom was surrendered to a shelter initially from what it would seem with 5 pups from her second litter, as well as at least one pup from her first, but different father. The picture of mom I recognized as piebald fawn, but from reading on American Bulldog genetics I do believe she had a copy of whitehead as well. Dad is assumed piebald black carrying brindle. Breeder kept solid white, piebald brindle, brindle with whitehead.  
Question is, if color breeding is so specific,  why not only cross double piebald to piebald to get only white, mostly white dogs? Did they likely not have a suitable dog and bred one? I came across a breeders Facebook page and I spit my coffee when he talked of the constant barrage of people insisting your dog is a pitbull or presa/corso when you have a mostly brindle. The 10 month old pup from first litter looked just like dog in breeders photo. The masked mostly fawn that is.
Mom for my pup obviously doesn't have two copies of whitehead from litter, but she had a really interesting eye patch, probably the donator of the melanistic mask? Not sure why she got dumped so young. 
There is a weight chart if you image search breed chart, My Orange is almost dead on with the dog named Justice but roughtly two weeks ahead. 5.5 months and 43 lbs.

For background, I come from a broken up family where my mom does drugs and dad has remarried. My bf comes from a asian family who moved here years ago but my bf used to stay with his grandpa in his own country and came here 5 years ago after his death.

His family lives in neighborhood and they're pretty well off. He was brought up in a very kind and gentle environment. His grandparents are the best people out there who were polite and loving their whole life and that reflects in his behavior and personality too.

His english is still a bit offshore, it's adorable and really really endearing when he looks for words to describe his feelings but ends up saying those in the wrong pronunciation. He's the prettiest thing ever...like really really pretty and absolutely charming.

We met through community work and I immediately wanted to know him more. Luckily we hit off good and I asked him out 3 months later. It's been 2 years now and we're still together. And mind you, he doesnt have many friends coz of communication skills and he's kind of an introvert too.

Thing is....he's too polite and gentle. Almost like a pushover.  He's still studying but I got myself a job now so whenever I've some extra work, I tell him to do it for me and he does it without another thought. Whenever I ask for money when I run low, he gives it with a smile. Whenever I'm in a bad mood, I snap at him for asking if everything's alright. I snap at his mispronunciation, his mistakes with Grammer and sentences even though those arent even noticeable. I once threw a coffee down the drain coz I was pissed about my sister and then he messed up my coffee by trying to make me try his 'back home' version of coffee.

Even for that he apologised later saying he shouldn't have pushed me for something I didnt want to do.

I hate it when people take a second look at him when we're out. He's pretty I know but he's mine right? And with how polite he is, he smiles at them and greets them nicely, unknowingly raising their hopes to approach him even more. 

These past few weeks, he's been learning crocheting to control his anxiety and he makes me the sweetest things like Keychains, bracelets and covers for my bottle. 

What made me hit him is..I know its really fcked up but I've been stressed immensely about my work place. The employees are judgemental and higher ups are too annoying so I'm pissed off most of the time of the day.

And when I come home, he immediately comes to my place and YAPS about his day and asks for mine, even brings me various new crochet stuff and mind you my desk and cupboard are now full of those little pretty things. I've started to get annoyed at those and want to tell him to stop but instead of telling him..Last night I just snapped and threw what he got me (a bow and cherry hairclip) out the window.

He was hurt and expressed it but chose the wrong word and that just..pissed me off more so I shouted at him to shut the hell up. He was shocked, his face that I love so much had this..idk really confused and hurt look.

He stood up and gathered his stuff, apologised for coming but me being already worked up, I asked him where the hell was he going and he needs to sit his ass down until I calm down. 
I think he felt unsafe and kept muttering about now being not the time to talk and walked towards the door.

I dont know what came over me but I just yanked his hair and told him to sit on the couch and keep his mouth shut. He was scared, I saw the fear and idk..I think..I think I fed on it and snapped at him to sit and keep his mouth shut until I tell him to speak.

But he did open his mouth to say I was scaring him and he didn't feel good and I just, I dont know what happened but my anger flew off and I ended up slapping him while shouting at him to shut the hell up. Good thing...he pushed me off and ran away from me and my place.

I calmed down after an hour and two, realised what I did and how I treated him just for being loving and caring towards me. I went insane after hours and kept bombarding him with texts but he hasn't replied to any. I've tried calling but each goes to VM.

I know I'm the a-hole here but I just wanna ask how do I fix it? Is there any chance to get him to forgive me? Coz i really really love him and I dont wanna let him go.",0,1768187075.0,AITAH,24,0.25,False

Right now under U.S. tax rules every time you spend Bitcoin it’s technically a taxable event, even if you’re just buying a coffee. That’s been a real barrier for people who actually want to *use* Bitcoin as money instead of just holding it as an investment.

[Bitcoin.com News covered this idea a while back: the White House reiterated support for a “de minimis tax exemption” (around $600) on small BTC and crypto transactions](https://news.bitcoin.com/white-house-trump-supports-600-crypto-tax-exemption/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) so that tiny payments wouldn’t trigger capital gains tax.

If this actually becomes law it could make real-world use cases a lot more attractive. Instead of thinking “I’d love to pay in Bitcoin but let’s not deal with taxes,” people might start just *using* Bitcoin day-to-day, at least for small purchases.

If small payments like coffee or groceries were tax-free, would you actually spend more Bitcoin?

1qajjqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BiscottiCareful1355/comments/1qajjqc/living_in_downtown_phoenix_guide_2026/,Living in Downtown Phoenix Guide (2026),"# Everything You Need to Know About Living in Downtown Phoenix

**Why this is not a copy-paste take**

I grew up in Phoenix and watched downtown change from an “event zone” into a real neighborhood. This post reflects that context plus practical, on-the-ground details people ask when considering a move to Arizona.

**Q: What's it like living in Downtown Phoenix?**  
A: Living in downtown Phoenix is a walkable, entertainment-rich, and transit-connected experience, but it comes with city realities like higher property crime, visible homelessness, and limited grocery stores.

I grew up in Phoenix. Not the Instagram version, the real one. For most of my childhood and teenage years, downtown Phoenix was not a place you “hung out.” You went there for a Suns game, maybe a concert, and then you left. **If you stayed after dark, people assumed either your car broke down or you were making questionable life choices.** Slight exaggeration, but not by much!

Back then, downtown was mostly government buildings, office towers, and sports venues surrounded by surface parking lots. The idea of meeting friends for dinner downtown on a random Tuesday night would have sounded about as realistic as dial up internet making a comeback in today’s world.

Fast forward about 40 years, and especially the last 15, and downtown Phoenix has undergone one of the biggest transformations in the Valley. It’s no longer just an event zone. It’s a real neighborhood now, with residents, schools, grocery stores, culture, and daily life happening well beyond game nights.

**Here’s what living in downtown Phoenix actually looks like today.**

### How has Downtown Phoenix changed over the years?

For decades, Phoenix developed outward, not upward. Suburbs exploded and downtown stagnated. That started changing in the late 2000s and accelerated after 2010 with major public and private investment: light rail expansion, ASU’s downtown campus, sports venue upgrades, residential towers, and arts-focused redevelopment around Roosevelt Row.

The opening of ASU’s Downtown Phoenix campus in 2006 brought a permanent student and faculty population. Valley Metro Light Rail began service in 2008, connecting downtown to Midtown, Tempe, and later Mesa ([Valley Metro Rail](https://www.valleymetro.org/)).

Since roughly 2010, downtown Phoenix has shifted from a pass-through district to one of the Valley’s primary entertainment, cultural, and urban residential hubs. Since 2020 alone, downtown has added more than 5,000 apartment units, with tons more planned or under construction.

### Where Downtown Phoenix Is Located

Downtown Phoenix is generally defined as the area bordered by McDowell Road to the north, 7th street to the west, Buckeye Rd to the south, and 7th ave to the east. But as a Phoenix native, we call downtown everything within the freeway circle of the I17 to the I17 to the 10 and the 10. In this blog though, Ill be pushing a bit further north to chat about everything below Thomas. I want to give you real insight from people who have lived here forever (me!), not some generic AI output or info from people who have never even been downtown. So, within the boundaries I mentioned above are Encanto, Willow, Coronado, Roosevelt Row, the Warehouse District, Portland St, the Central Avenue corridor, the civic and government core, and ASU’s downtown campus.

### Neighborhoods for Living in Downtown Phoenix

Roosevelt Row and Evans Churchill sit on the north and northeast side of the core and are where you’ll find the highest concentration of newer mid-rise apartment buildings, bars, coffee shops, murals, galleries, and First Friday traffic. If you want to walk to art, cocktails, and restaurants, this is the “I actually live downtown” zone most people picture. (For official downtown updates and initiatives: [Downtown Phoenix Inc.](https://dtphx.org/))

The Warehouse District is south of Washington and Jefferson near the ballpark. It’s where you’ll see more converted industrial character, newer high-rise clusters, and heavy event energy on game nights. It feels more sports and concerts than tree-lined neighborhood.

Portland Street is a real micro area people mention now because so much housing and retail has stacked up right around it. Broadstone Portland is one of the main examples. The vibe is apartment-forward with quick access to Roosevelt Row, Hance Park, and the light rail.

**Encanto sits north of the downtown core** and is where Phoenix starts to shift from true urban density into classic Central Phoenix. Encanto Park and Encanto Golf Course anchor the area and give it a very different feel from the warehouse districts and high-rise clusters downtown. More grass. More mature trees. More “old Phoenix.”

**Encanto Village** is not a single neighborhood. It is a large, official City of Phoenix Urban Village — a planning district used for zoning, transportation, and long-term growth. Encanto Village covers a wide area that includes parts of Midtown, major corridors along Central Avenue, institutional uses, parks, museums, light rail stops, medical offices, apartments, and multiple residential pockets. When the city says “Encanto,” this is usually what they mean.

**Encanto historic neighborhoods** are specific residential pockets within or near that larger village. Encanto-Palmcroft is the best-known (wide, palm-lined streets and early-20th-century architecture like Tudor Revival, Spanish Colonial, and Mediterranean). Encanto Vista and Encanto Manor are smaller, primarily post-war areas with Ranch and mid-century homes and close proximity to the golf course and park. In short: Encanto Village is the big planning area; the historic neighborhoods are the character-driven residential sections inside it.

**Willo Historic District sits just just northwest of the downtown core**. It’s early-1900s through mid-century homes, historic overlays, and big pride-of-ownership energy. People who want character and a yard but still want to be minutes from downtown often end up looking here.

**Coronado is east of Central and north of the I-10 corridor,** full of historic bungalows, block construction, and remodels. It’s one of the most popular “I want central Phoenix, not suburban Phoenix” neighborhoods because it’s close to downtown without being in the middle of downtown.

**Garfield is closer to the downtown edge and still changing fast**. It has older homes, new builds, and infill. It’s one of the neighborhoods where you feel the transition in real time, street by street.

### Housing Options in Downtown Phoenix

### Apartments

**Downtown is primarily an apartment market.**

As of late 2025:

* Average rent: approximately $2,000 per month
* Studios: approximately $1,450
* One-bedroom: approximately $1,850 to $1,950
* Two-bedroom: $2,500 and up
* Sources include RentCafe, Zumper, and on-site property listings.

Examples of current downtown properties include Altura on Pierce, Camden Copper Square, Brix Warehouse District, Union at Roosevelt, X Phoenix, Aspire Fillmore, and Broadstone Portland. Newer high-rise developments are concentrated near Central Avenue, Roosevelt Street, and the Warehouse District.

More current pricing examples that people actually ask about, because these names come up constantly:

* Altura on Pierce tends to show wide rent ranges by unit type and floor, with studios and one beds commonly listed in the mid $1,000s and premium units higher.
* Broadstone Portland is often marketed as a Roosevelt Row and Hance Park adjacent building and regularly lists one and two bedroom pricing across the mid $1,000s into the $2,000s depending on unit size and timing.
* X Phoenix is one of the higher-profile high-rise style communities downtown and tends to price above older mid-rise stock, especially on larger units and higher floors.
* Union at Roosevelt is right in the center of Roosevelt Row foot traffic and typically sits in the newer-build pricing tier.

Prices fluctuate monthly and do not include taxes, parking, or amenity fees.

### Condos and Townhomes

Limited but available. Most are concentrated near Roosevelt Row, Central Avenue, and the Warehouse District.

Prices typically range from the mid-$300,000s to $700,000 and higher depending on the building, views, parking, and HOA structure.

Inventory is far smaller than apartments, which keeps pricing relatively firm.

If you want condo and townhome living instead of a lease, you usually end up shopping in a few predictable places:

* Mid-rise condo style buildings near Roosevelt Row and the arts district core.
* Central Avenue corridor buildings where you trade a monthly HOA for views, security, and walkability.
* Townhome pockets on the downtown edge, especially as you move into Coronado and parts of Encanto and Willo where the built form shifts from towers to smaller attached housing.

### Single-Family Homes

Rare within the downtown core, but available in adjacent historic neighborhoods such as Roosevelt Historic District, Willo, Encanto, and Garfield.

These areas offer early-20th-century homes, tree-lined streets, and historic preservation overlays. Prices often range from $600,000 to well over $1 million depending on condition, lot size, and historic designation.

Willo tends to skew higher because the historic district brand is strong, the streets feel established, and the home styles are the kind people move here for: pre-war and mid-century homes, brick and stucco, bigger lots, mature landscaping, and a real neighborhood grid you can walk.

Encanto can jump fast because of the park and golf course proximity and the feel of the area.

Coronado is often slightly more accessible than Willo but still not “cheap,” and it has a huge number of 1930s to 1950s bungalows and block homes that remodel well.

Garfield is where you can still see more price spread because it’s actively changing, and the mix of original homes, flips, and new infill varies block by block.

### Crime and Safety (The Real Version)

Downtown Phoenix has higher reported crime rates than suburban Phoenix, particularly for property crime. This is typical of dense, urban cores. ([Phoenix Police Crime Statistics](https://www.phoenix.gov/police/resources-information/crime-stats-and-maps))

Violent crime exists but is concentrated in specific pockets and tends to be situational rather than random. Most residents report that daily life feels safe when using basic city awareness.

The homelessness crisis is visible downtown. “The Zone,” a large encampment, was cleared in 2023, but homelessness remains an ongoing citywide issue rather than one isolated to downtown. (City resources: [City of Phoenix Downtown Development](https://www.phoenix.gov/communitydevelopment))

Sources include Phoenix Police Department crime statistics, the Maricopa Association of Governments, and the City of Phoenix Human Services Department.

### Walkability and Transportation

**Downtown Phoenix is one of the most walkable areas in the Valley.**

* Light Rail costs $2 per ride and connects downtown to Midtown, Uptown, Tempe, and Mesa.
* Walk Scores typically range from 70 to 90 depending on location.
* Bike infrastructure has expanded significantly around Roosevelt Row, Central Avenue, and the downtown core.
* Driving times during off-peak hours are approximately ten minutes to Sky Harbor Airport, five to ten minutes to Midtown Phoenix, fifteen minutes to Tempe, and twenty to twenty-five minutes to Scottsdale.

Traffic is light by big-city standards but heavier during games, concerts, and festivals.

### Entertainment, Sports and Nightlife

Living downtown puts you near the Suns, Mercury, and Diamondbacks. The Suns and Mercury play downtown at the arena that was formerly Footprint Center. The Diamondbacks play at Chase Field. These venues anchor downtown and are a major reason the area stayed relevant even before people lived there. (Arena naming coverage: [AZFamily](https://www.azfamily.com/))

Major concert and performance venues include Arizona Financial Theatre, The Van Buren, Crescent Ballroom, Orpheum Theatre, and Symphony Hall. It is realistic to walk to NBA games, WNBA games, MLB games, concerts, comedy shows, and festivals. That was not a thing when I was growing up.

**Big recurring events that actually change traffic, parking, and the feel of downtown:**

* First Friday on Roosevelt Row.
* Diamondbacks home stands and big weekend series.
* Major touring shows at The Van Buren and Arizona Financial Theatre.
* Large conventions and expo weekends tied to the Phoenix Convention Center.
* Holiday events and seasonal markets that concentrate around CityScape, Heritage Square, and the Roosevelt corridor.

### Restaurants, Bars and Coffee

**Downtown Phoenix is now one of the strongest food districts in the Valley.**

Standout restaurants include Pizzeria Bianco, Bacanora, Wren and Wolf, Flour and Thyme, Sottise, and Cornish Pasty Co., which has been a downtown staple long before the area’s resurgence became obvious.

Bars include Bitter and Twisted, Little Rituals, The Theodore, Valley Bar, and the downtown AZ Wilderness taproom. Several have received national recognition for cocktail programs.

Local coffee shops and daytime spots include Lola Coffee, Songbird Coffee and Tea House, Futuro, Xanadu Coffee, Press Coffee, and Fair Trade Cafe, which also doubles as a local art space.

Yoga and wellness exists downtown in a way it simply did not when I was younger. A lot of residents treat Hance Park and the Roosevelt corridor like their daily routine zone: coffee, walk, class, work, repeat.

### Arts, Culture and History

Roosevelt Row remains Phoenix’s primary arts district, filled with murals, galleries, studios, and boutiques. First Friday, held monthly, is one of the largest recurring art walks in the country and draws tens of thousands of people.

Downtown is home to major cultural institutions including the Phoenix Art Museum, the largest art museum in the Southwest with over 20,000 works, and the Heard Museum, founded in 1929 and internationally respected for Native American art and history. ([Phoenix Art Museum](https://phxart.org/) • [Heard Museum](https://heard.org/))

Burton Barr Central Library is a five-story, 280,000-square-foot civic anchor featuring an interior water feature, gallery space, and public study areas.

The Arizona Science Center is downtown and is one of the most underrated “normal life” amenities for people with kids or visiting family. It’s also right next to Heritage Square, which is one of the few places downtown where you can still feel older Phoenix architecture without trying too hard. ([Arizona Science Center](https://www.azscience.org/))

The Children’s Museum of Phoenix is also downtown and is one of those places locals actually use on weekends when you have toddlers and you need to burn energy without melting outside. ([Children’s Museum of Phoenix](https://childrensmuseumofphoenix.org/))

St. Mary’s Basilica is downtown and it’s one of the clearest reminders that Phoenix is not just new build subdivisions and strip malls. It’s one of the most photographed churches in the city for a reason. ([St. Mary’s Basilica](https://stmarysbasilica.org/))

### Historic Hotels and Buildings

Hotel San Carlos still operates and hosted Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe. Westward Ho was once Phoenix’s tallest building and housed numerous Hollywood figures. The Luhrs Tower, built in 1929, remains one of the city’s best examples of Art Deco architecture. The Orpheum Theatre, also opened in 1929, continues to host performances under its original ornate ceiling.

Hotel San Carlos is also one of the most talked-about “haunted” locations downtown. The haunting stories are local legend and part of the building’s pop culture identity.

More historic places people forget to mention when they copy and paste the same four buildings:

* Heritage Square and the Rosson House area, which is one of the best preserved pieces of old Phoenix in the downtown footprint.
* Union Station and the old rail influence, which matters because transportation shaped early Phoenix growth patterns long before light rail was a thing.

Downtown Phoenix has one of the highest concentrations of preserved historic architecture in the Valley.

### Schools, Demographics and Daily Life

ASU’s downtown campus houses programs in journalism, public service, nursing, law, and health sciences. Public K-12 schools within the core are limited, with more options in adjacent neighborhoods. Charter and private schools are available nearby.

Downtown residents skew toward professionals, students, creatives, and empty nesters, though the demographic mix continues to broaden as more housing comes online.

Encanto and Willo pull a different demographic than the apartment core. More long-term owners, more established households, more people who want a yard and a historic home but still want to be close to downtown. Coronado splits the difference with a mix of owners, renters, remodel buyers, and people who want central Phoenix but do not want a tower.

### Grocery Stores and Practical Realities

Grocery access remains a weak spot. Fry’s Food and Drug opened downtown in 2019, becoming the first new downtown grocery store in over fifty years. A Safeway on McDowell Road serves nearby neighborhoods but is not walkable for most residents. Smaller markets and specialty shops exist, but downtown is not grocery-dense.

The real downtown grocery reality is still this: most people either plan their trips or they supplement with delivery, smaller markets, and convenience shopping.

### Middle Housing and What It Could Change

Arizona passed a middle housing law that pushes cities toward allowing smaller multifamily housing types in more places. What that means in normal person language is more legal pathways for duplexes, triplexes, fourplex style housing, and similar “in-between” housing in areas that were historically locked into single-family zoning. ([Arizona State Legislature HB2721 summary](https://www.azleg.gov/))

How it could affect areas around downtown within the parameters of the law:

* Coronado, Garfield, and parts of the downtown edge are the most likely to see more small-scale infill and redevelopments that are not full high-rises.
* It can increase housing supply gradually without requiring a tower.
* It can also increase teardown pressure in some pockets if land values support redevelopment.
* It will not instantly change Willo and Encanto the way people on the internet pretend it will, because historic overlays, lot patterns, and neighborhood politics still matter in real life.

### Is Downtown Phoenix Worth Living In?

**Downtown Phoenix today is walkable, cultural, entertainment-rich, and transit-connected. It is still evolving.**

**It is not suburban, quiet, grocery-heavy, or free of urban issues.**

If you want a true urban lifestyle in Arizona, downtown Phoenix is the closest thing the Valley offers. And as someone who watched it go from a place you avoided after dark to a place you walk to dinner and a concert, the change is real.

### FAQ

**Is downtown Phoenix walkable?**

Yes. It’s one of the most walkable areas in the Valley, especially around Roosevelt Row, Central Avenue, and the downtown core.

**What’s the biggest downside of living in downtown Phoenix?**

Urban tradeoffs: higher property crime than suburbs, visible homelessness, and grocery access that’s still thinner than most people expect.

**Are there single-family homes downtown?**

They’re rare in the core, but you’ll find more options in adjacent historic neighborhoods like Willo, Encanto, Coronado, and Garfield.

**How close is Sky Harbor from downtown?**

About ten minutes during off-peak hours (driving), which is one reason downtown works well for frequent travelers.

**Which downtown areas feel most “neighborhood” vs “event zone”?**

Roosevelt Row/Evans Churchill read as the most “I live here” walkable zone; the Warehouse District skews more event-heavy on game and concert nights.

1qajj63,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakechristianchloe/comments/1qajj63/first_snark_rant/,first snark (rant),"rant!! i’ve been a quiet snarker but i just wanted to put my thoughts out there.. i honestly feel bad that she got pregnant and married so young, i feel like she had so much potential with how many views her channel was bringing in and how young she is. I really do feel like she should try to make friends, and could’ve benefitted from the all of the fun content like “girls night in” just playing games and listening to music, “go on a hike with us” “cabin trip” or even just with her husband. There are plenty of christian influencers with similar values as her. I also think that youtube is dead and i’m surprised that she’s even getting enough views for a snark page coming from someone that posts hour long videos with short form being so popular. it may be obvious in this rant but i never watch the full vlogs and i usually skip around her yapping.. Tiktok, snapchat and instagram is where it’s at. I never understood being a youtuber and not being on other social media i feel like that where the familiarity comes from when ur not posting on youtube or they aren’t going on youtube people won’t forget about you if you post a simple coffee cup on instagram story. I definitely think that she should move her content to those apps because thats where the money and engagement is. hour long videos of her doing nothing but shopping and rambling is boring. Maybe if she was traveling or road tripping (another content idea) to a different state or a stay in another city nothing crazy expensive or taking rhythm or even herself out somewhere actual fun (because I’m not too big on putting your child on social media) on outings like arcades or interactive museums is fun. a shorter series of her trying new things like yoga or maybe fun challenges with all the products she has like blind fold body routine would be something i’d watch. I saw a girl on tiktok do a series where she created a body routine for influencers and mailed it to them. Another content idea would be uploading pictures or songs on tiktok and making a body routine that gave off that vibe because people are obsessed with aesthetics!!

1qajhsq,https://i.redd.it/lhghvqmd3ucg1.jpeg,The Drop movie night open to everyone 18+ at Marine Park Coffee,"Join us on Friday, January 23rd at 6:00 PM for a cozy winter Movie Night at Marine Park Coffee. This event is open to everyone ages 18+ and is part of our open community programming, welcoming neighbors and friends from across Marine Park and the surrounding area. Everyone from southern Brooklyn is welcome to join, including those from Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, Park Slope, Prospect Heights, Sunset Park, and beyond—we are proud to bring together people from neighborhoods throughout Brooklyn.

Admission is $5, and we’ll be serving fresh popcorn and water to all attendees. The admission cost helps us rent out the coffee shop for the evening and directly supports Nick, the owner of Marine Park Coffee, for hosting the gathering and making the space available for a private community event.

We’ll be screening The Drop, a Brooklyn-set crime drama starring James Gandolfini and Tom Hardy, with several scenes filmed right here in Marine Park. It’s a great local film with a strong neighborhood connection and a perfect pick for a relaxed winter evening.

While many of our core events are designed specifically for young adults, this movie night—like our Live Music events—is intentionally open to the wider community. These events are about creating accessible, welcoming spaces where people can connect locally.

We’re also in the process of planning to file as a 501(c)(4) social welfare nonprofit, focused on strengthening community ties, supporting local businesses, and offering accessible programming that benefits the neighborhood as a whole.

Please RSVP on Partiful so we can plan accordingly:
https://partiful.com/e/a5GxsHmmMg5NlYy6FKDc?c=yPlYsAFZ

We hope you’ll join us for a great film, good company, and an evening centered on community.

1qajh8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectricians/comments/1qajh8g/noticable_buzzing_noise_coming_from_old_screwin/,Noticable buzzing noise coming from old screw-in fuse box.,"This fuse box has been in my house for over 20 years ever since my Dad moved in but has never really had this issue until recently. We need advice for this type of thing because at the moment we cannot afford a certified technician to come look at it so I decided to post to this subreddit to get some advice for what to look out for and what to do before we try to do so.

Our fuse box has always had problems with burning fuses, like simple ones. Like if we run 2 appliances at once in our kitchen off the same fuse (such as a coffee maker and a microwave, or a microwave and a toaster oven) the fuse will burn out and we have to replace it. But this is not the issue I am talking about. We have started to notice some unusual buzzing coming from our box.

The first time it happened we were running a microwave off of a singular fuse (this was the only appliance running at the time) and we began to hear an extremely ear piercing buzz coming from the fuse box. We immediately turned off the microwave and my Dad told me to go over to the fuse box and listen for a buzz when he turned on the microwave again but there was nothing anymore.

Today was the second time it happened and we are still oblivious about the whole thing. Our electric water heater was installed about 15 years ago along with a brand new Jumper cable by my Papa and it has worked perfectly fine ever since. The only worrisome thing that has ever been of that water heater ever since is that sometimes the fuse will get a little warm if the heater is running for long periods of time (e.g. 30+ mins) which I think is fairly normal for an old fuse box like this.

But today we were doing dishes and as I walked by the box I noticed a very distinct buzzing noise coming from the fuse box. This buzzing went on for over 20 minutes before stopping. The only fuse that was noticeably hot to the touch was the fuse that the water heater was on (note: the water heater is the only one on that fuse) and we concluded it was that fuse. But after the buzzing stopped, even after taking 3 10 minute showers and doing a bit of a load on the heater the buzzing never continued.

What could this be, what should we look out for, and what is some advice on this? Any help is appreciated!",2,1768186829.0,AskElectricians,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

One spring day in Osavine, Claire Miller sat in the Miller Mansion’s cozy drawing room. She sat by the fireplace, reading an Anglic book with full attention.

Suddenly, a large envelope slammed onto the coffee table in front of her with a loud bang, the gust of wind stirring the hair by her cheeks.

“You don’t belong here. Get out of this house,” Ashley Miller shouted as she marched toward Claire.

“Ashley, what are you making a scene about now?” Claire’s voice was soft, but a slight frown touched her brow as she looked up at Ashley, her elder sister.

The Miller family had three children. Samuel Miller, the eldest, was in college. Ashley, the second, was in high school. And Claire was the youngest.

“Claire Miller, no, Claire Brown. You’re not my sister at all. Get out of here, right now, this minute.” Ashley pointed fiercely toward the door.

Claire went still. She picked up the envelope from the coffee table and opened it. Her eyes narrowed in shock. Inside was a document showing she was not a Miller by blood.

Adam Miller and Jennifer Miller stepped into the living room just then, with a shy, plainly dressed girl trailing behind them. The girl was about Claire’s age.

Claire rose to her feet, holding the document high. “Dad, Mom, is this true?” she asked, her voice trembling. She couldn’t believe the words on the page.

Jennifer’s eyes were red as she took Claire’s hand. “Darling, I can’t believe it either,” she said, her voice thick. “I’ve treasured you like a precious gem for fifteen years. How can you not be my own?”

Adam’s face was stern. “Since it’s a mistake, it must be set right,” he stated firmly. “Your real parents are outside, waiting for you.”

“Hurry up and go. This is my real sister,” Ashley cut in sharply. Pulling the quiet Livia Miller forward, she staged a tight, sisterly hug for Claire to see.

Livia kept her head down, as if she didn’t dare look Claire in the eye. But inside, she was laughing wildly. ‘I’m finally back. Last time, I was stupid and died soon after returning to the Millers. This time, I’ll make sure I stay as the richest man’s daughter.’

Claire looked at each of them, then gently pulled her hand away from Jennifer’s hold. “If it’s a mistake, then it should be fixed,” she said softly. Her voice was still sweet, but her tone was steady. Jennifer seemed unable to let go.

“Just get out. Go back to your poor family,” Ashley snapped. “You’ve got eight brothers who eat like they’ve never seen food. Watch out, Claire, your new parents might just sell you off for their sake.” She looked ready to drag Claire out herself.

Without another word, Claire walked straight out of Miller Mansion. At the gate stood a middle-aged couple waiting. The man wore work clothes, and the woman was dressed plainly.

Both of them were good-looking. When they saw Claire, their expressions grew complicated, but they stepped forward at once.

“Are you Claire?” asked Joyce Brown, Claire’s birth mother. After Claire nodded, Joyce took her hand. “Come, let’s go home.”

Henry Brown, Claire’s birth father, added, “Yes, let’s go home and talk.” And so, Claire followed her real parents back to where they lived.

\*\*\*\*\*

The Browns lived in a small, three-room rented apartment down an alley off Qranta Road, near Osavine High School. There were eleven people in the family altogether.

Before Claire’s arrival, the room arrangement had remained unchanged for years: her parents shared one, Livia had her own, and all eight brothers slept in the third.

The floor was peeling at the edges. The walls were scuffed, with a few old posters stuck to them. The room was full of worn-out things: a sagging couch, a shaky table, and an old TV.

Shabby as it was, the place was tidy and clean. It couldn’t have been more different from the grand Miller Mansion. In that moment, the huge gap between rich and poor felt real and stark.

“I know it’s not what you’re used to,” Henry said with a gentle smile. “Your mother always says education comes first. Every penny we earn goes toward the children’s schooling.”

Joyce nodded. “Just because we’re poor now doesn’t mean we will always be. If you and your brothers work hard at your studies, one day things will get better.”

Henry nodded eagerly. “Yes, your mom’s right about that.” Claire understood quickly: here, Joyce was the strict one, and Henry the soft one. Back at the Millers’, it had been just the opposite.

Joyce guided Claire to a chair. “Let me tell you how things are with us,” she began. “Your father works at a factory. He brings home about two thousand a month.

“I do some small business. My pay isn’t regular. Some months it’s a few hundred, others it can be four thousand. We rent this place. We don’t own anything, but we don’t owe anyone, either. And you have eight brothers.”",1,1768186607.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False
1qajdvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1qajdvi/my_mentally_ill_dad_recently_passed_away_and_i/,"My mentally ill dad recently passed away, and I don’t know exactly how to feel about it.","On December 1st, 2025, my dad, who had bipolar disorder, died from a heart attack while he was living in Puerto Rico. 

The year before he died, he moved from the mainland United States to Puerto Rico while he was still in a manic episode that lasted well over two years. He had been getting in trouble with the law while he was living in the U.S. 

He made reckless decisions, threatened to kill his family, burn down my family’s house while we were inside, and he got arrested multiple times for trespassing on property he’d already been banned from. He was also hospitalized because he attacked police officers and nurses after one of his arrests. He took advantage of people’s kindness wherever he could and often threatened to harm them when they called him out for his behavior. 

I was in my sophomore year of college in 2023, when my dad’s manic episode started. That spring, he and my mother separated because he was already threatening to hurt her and my grandmother who had been living with us. 

While he was on his own, he drove up to my college campus and asked me to pay for his gas as well as a hotel room for him to stay at. All because he left his wallet at a stranger’s home he’d stayed at. I had very little money at the time, and I was only twenty-years-old so I was not able to pay for a hotel room for him to stay at. Thus, he manipulated me and took advantage of my kindness so he could sleep in my dorm room, while my roommate was in her part of our room. Thankfully, we had a double bedroom, but it was so inappropriate because I was in an all female dorm at the time and he knew he could get what he wanted from me.

I was angry with myself for not telling him to go elsewhere, but I was scared he would explode on me. I also feel so bad for my roommate and the awkwardness she must have felt that night. She was kind enough to lend my dad one of her blankets. 

He left the morning after. 

Skipping ahead to 2025, during my senior year of college, my dad already moved to Puerto Rico. For what reason? I’m not entirely sure, but he was Puerto Rican himself, been to the island many times over the course of his life, his family was there, and he started a coffee plantation. Not as successful as he made it out to be. He had one or two employees on the property he was utilizing for the plantation, not hardly any of the proper equipment or the number of staff for his business to flourish. 

For over a year, during 2024, he made group chats that included me and most of my family and random people I’d never met, where he verbally and emotionally attacked his family and friends. I did everything I could to distance myself from him at the time because I could not bear to hear his negative comments about how everyone wronged him when he made the choices he did. 

When I found out he’d died, I was shocked, as anyone would be. He was my father, and while I miss him and the happy times we shared together, he was abusive emotionally and physically to his past wives and my half brothers. He manipulated me, my little sister, my mother, and my grandparents. He emotionally and verbally abused me and everyone in my family and our community. I’m angry that his mental health did not get taken care of properly mostly because he did not have the insight to realize he had a mental illness, but also because the American health care system and mental health system failed him. 

He was ill for the entire time I knew him, and throughout his marriage to my mother. I was constantly afraid of his explosive behavior while he was manic growing up, and my sister and I had to stay with friends while my mother worked. It was dangerous to be around him for so long, and my mind is still in a state of fight or flight in a way. 

I hate that my mother was treated so poorly during her marriage and I know she tried to divorce him multiple times, but it never worked out until right before he died because of my father’s ability to manipulate and control anyone he wanted to. 

I’ve been grieving throughout this past month, and unfortunately, he died the day before my 23rd birthday. I’m glad that I at least found out the day after. I’m relieved in some ways that he’s gone because he can no longer hurt me or anyone else. He’s also no longer suffering from his mental illness, his severe type two diabetes, high blood pressure, the horrors he saw while he was serving in the army, and so many other conditions that ultimately contributed to his death at 73. 

I’m just wondering what things someone like me can do to cope with this grief? The grief of losing a parent with whom I had a very complicated and often painful relationship with? But with whom I always felt loved and supported by in various ways. 

Thank you, and I’m sending all those who have lost someone dear to them lots of prayers and love your way. ",2,1768186572.0,GriefSupport,2,1.0,False

We met and spoke online for years before meeting in person. We had proper conversations. Though he did say that I talked more about myself than he did himself, and I didn't fully agree with that. We did a lot of arguing, intiated by him. If I tried to talk about my feelings, especially in regards to him or the relationship, he'd blank me. For a while he asked what's wrong but then told me all we talked about was me, my feelings, and that I didn't care about him. 

He argued with me over not being sexual, and my reasons why, eventually making me feel pressured to engage. A lot of our conversations were sexual, and it seemed to be all he was interested in. He told me he was too depressed to talk for weeks yet messaged me to speak sexually, promising me he'd spend time with me after that, but then not doing so. He got upset with me for talking to my friends, called them fake, and accused me of being able to replace people easily. He also got upset when I didn't respond fast, or enthusiastically enough. 

When we met in person, he didn't seem interested in me, in more ways than one. He spent time with me, at first, but after a while he stopped wanting to do things. Months into being together, after I went back to the UK with him, I felt alone. It was a hassle to get him to do anything with me, other than watch things, which he didn't always do. I'd ask to go on walks and he'd agree, and then change his mind, and promise to go the next day but wouldn't. He wouldn't care when that upset me. I asked to take baths together, which he didn't always seem interested in. When we did he he was glued to his phone, not talking to me, not listening. 

I'd sit there for an hour with him on his phone. I got upset several times and he'd tell me he was going to put it down, but wouldn't. We went places and he was glued to his phone as we walked around. I'd lose him because he wouldn't see that I had walked off. We would go for coffee and he'd be on his phone, and I'd try to talk to him to no avail. I complained about it upsetting me, and being awkward, and he acted like it was normal pointing out other people who were on their phones. Or he'd say that what he was looking at was important, which it was sometimes, but also said he just liked scrolling Facebook. 

He said that I was also on my phone questioning why I was bothered. Whenever I put my phone down to talk to him, and picked it back up when it didn't happen. After dozens of times of getting upset over this, I gave up. I went to leave with the coffee right after getting it, and he asked me why, and told me that he put his phone away. I had my phone out one of the times we were getting coffee, and he told me to put it away because it was awkward, and I did. He admitted he was a hypocrite. He later used it against me, saying I'd done the same thing to him. 

It's always been a hassle to get him to spend time, to talk to me, and it seems he doesn't want to. He went weeks at a time staying up all night, editing YouTube videos or doing other things, and not spending time with me. He called me codependent and needy for being upset over this, and suggested I find my own hobby. He complained about not getting any space when from my perspective, he was always getting space. On my birthday a few years back he paid for an Airbnb for the night. He was watching Elton John at Glastonbury, and did so longer than he said he would. 

I asked him to at least sit out with me on the patio, and he didn't. I asked him after he was done to take a bath, and he said that he would, but after sitting in the bath alone for 20mins I got out. Most of what we do together is watch things or play video games, and sometimes he doesn't seem interested in that. He will agree to do it and then won't, seemingly preferring to watch or play things alone, opting to do so after I've asked to do it together. For ages we didn't go anywhere. He blamed it on various reasons from sleep to a lack of money. When he went places with others on little sleep. 

When what I wanted to do didn't require much or any money. I'd struggle to talk to him because of how glued to his phone he was. He would insist that he was listening, but then ask me to repeat myself, and get frustrated with me for being upset and say that I was overreacting. He'd read comments whilst I spoke, and would pick his phone up to check something, or scroll Facebook while I was talking. He's different with other people, and actually talks to them. He puts his phone down. He kind of has to as he's studying to become a counselor when he doesn't care about my feelings, doesn't listen to them, or argues with me over them. 

A majority of the time conversations about my feelings turn into arguments. He doesn't remember a lot of what I tell him. He's asked me several times if I like certain foods I've never said I liked, or that I said I didn't like. We went to America last Christmas to visit family. He's always given more attention to my mother. Every trip he talks to her more, follows her around in public. I'd try to talk to him, just for a minute, and he'd say he can't talk to both of us at once before turning back to her. I got upset over this one time, said I felt ignored, which resulted in him screaming and kicking things after I tried to calmly talk about it.

During the last visit, he walked around with her in public, and acted completely different with her than he does me in public. He goes quiet on me, claims he dislikes talking around others, and constantly looks around and focuses on other people (usually women) He didn't do that with my mother. He spoke to her and then snapped at me many of the times I tried to talk to him, telling me that he was overstimulated or had a headache, before going back to speaking and joking with her. I tried to talk about this upsetting me and he denied he was ignoring me, but also asked could he not choose who he speaks to. 

I did the same thing back to him, snapping that I was overstimulated, after speaking to my mother and he told me not to, and was just as irked by it. When I didn't want to come back, as I usually don't, he begged me to and promised to change several things he does including listening to me. He swore he wouldn't be as glued to his phone. When we came back for a few weeks he wasn't as glued to it. But then he picked it up when I was speaking, and put it down, a few times. One of the times he said sorry and that he wouldn't do it again, but then he did. 

He did it again and told me, whenever I got upset, that I was overreacting. On my birthday he was glued to his phone looking at things to buy. He made up for how awful my birthday was by offering to take me back to where we were, and promising not to do the same things, but then he did. He was glued to his phone and turns out, he bought a tv, and wasted the little time we had on that. He's been on his phone less but is often distracted by other things, or distracted in general. Even when he's not doing something he doesn't listen, or take in all of what I said. 

For the past two weeks, he's argued with me and appears to be more irritable with me, he's also listened to me less and has spent less time with me. He keeps asking what every time I say anything. He also keeps saying I said things I didn't say, the opposite of what I said, insisting he's listening. He's gotten frustrated a few times I've been upset over it, and refused to repeat myself. He apologized for reacting that way, said he wouldn't again, and then did a day later. He told me before that we are together so much, he doesn't have anything to talk about. 

He's also said I'm not interested in what he has to talk about. He's criticised the things I talk about, and share with him, even when I don't share them often. He's told me that he's a guy and he's not interested, and has been annoyed over it, including after he told me that he wanted to see and hear about whatever it was. He said he didn't mean it but said it again, and again. Today he said it. He was also reading a post when I was speaking to him, and insisted he was listening, and excused it by saying he was already reading the post when I came back. 

He's admitted before to not being able to multitask, to use his phone and listen, but then says other times he can though it's obvious he can't. If he's not on his phone, he is distracted by something else. Earlier today he looked at his phone and started to scratch his jeans to get something off of them, unable to give me a few mins of his undivided attention. He expects different treatment when he speaks to me, or tries to show me something, wanting me to immediately put my phone down. Sometimes I think he does these things on purpose to make me feel small. 

He got frustrated with me today for being upset, and saying I felt he doesn't listen to me, or want to talk to me. He kept saying that he does want to, before complaining that he had to keep reassuring me. ",1,1768186546.0,TwoHotTakes,8,0.67,False

I love, a love that’s loud.

It’s vast and endless without fail.

It’s bright; a firework following a sparking tail 

It’s seen; a blazing star, shooting in the sky 

It’s keen to all things momentary 

One of which we are. 



It’s quite transparent in the light 

The warmest kiss,

a sweet delight 

It’s swimming in between your legs 

Like a ocean ballerina on the kegs 

She changes shapes on shoulder blades 

On thinnest skin between our neck 

On every single little freck.

Between the night and day



And in this love that’s loud I love

I use it’s roots to branch beneath me 

Strong and willowed , ancient trees 

I use its leaves to guide me softly 

To the valleys in your heart 

To the meadows of your chest 

To the secret that you hold 

Till the end has given rest. 



But a love that’s loves me 

It is quiet. 

It’s a breeze that follows suite

It’s a little quiet morning

With a coffee and a beaut.

It doesn’t yell - it doesn’t shout 

It lays there gently on my couch.

It opens up its starry arms 

Allows myself to disregard 

All the negativities I’ve learnt

The words - the struggle 

The dirt.



It lays me naked in its presence 

Without the vanity of clothing. 

It doesn’t make me get undressed

To see the oaths I’ve sworn to holdin.

It doesn’t need to see my body 

To see the things that I hold deep

It takes it time to heal the wounds

That others bandaged on a heap.

It doesn’t scream when dishes break

Or ask my faucet to stop leaking 

It takes a wrench , it shuts it off 

Carries on completely sneaking 

Little whispers in my ear

The sun - the moon 

The love I fear. 



So while I strangle with my love

It loves me back with quiet doves 

It sends me notes of yearn and need

It pleads to love me how I bleed.

Without it pouring out of me.

It wants to be without a fee

Every single part of me. 

So , I love , a love that’s loud.

But a love that loves me. 

Quiets down.

I thought it would be fairly easy, but looking at my route and riding around, man do I feel very small and out of place on the road.


I've noticed a pattern, I'm planning to ride farther and farther out, eventually do test rides to my job, which is 5 miles away / from San Fernando to sylmar, except I'm only riding from my mom who I currently take care of to my place which is about a mile a part.

I keep putting it off going father, taking alternative routes, or going much else where. 


How do I get past this hurdle? On one had it's just general.... embarrassment? I feel silly here in LA county being a 24 year old dude riding a bike when according to LA standards, I should have a car, along with being overweight/ general being slow. Also a genuine sense of fear for safety, what if I turn right and they don't see me? What if I get bumped or heckled cause I can't go instantly 20mph from a stand still? How do I deal with awkwardness at lights or stop signs? Where I don't know if I should go or not and they just stay there?


Sorry if this all sounds silly, I like riding and find it a lot of fun and really want to stick with it, and eventually head to and from work, errands, food, coffee, etc.",3,1768186538.0,BikeLA,8,1.0,False

I couldn’t take ADHD medication as unfortunately my body reacted badly to it and gave me a flu like reaction and severe brain fog, I have taken Levo (no problems with this) in the past but my TSH was apparently normal so I couldn’t take it?? But antibodies cooked which was making me feel awful. Instead I just took the natural alternative as I felt like I didn’t have a choice. I think I’ve finally found a workable routine which has helped my overall gut health and is alleviating my spiralling anxiety. This sounds like a lot and may be overwhelming to read but it’s helped me immensely and if you do at least one or two of these that suit you I would highly recommend the face blood flow massage every morning as the main one. Also you can do some of the non supplement techniques on medication it doesn’t really matter it’s all good for you, supplements are things I would choose wisely and be careful with too though. So here it goes:

Morning: 
- Face, neck and scalp massage for blood flow to help chronic pain and tiredness (huge game changer)
- 50ml of pure aloe Vera juice
- a pyscobiotic probiotic mix (life space is the only one I don’t have a histamine reaction to), my thyrobalance supplement (helps my hashimotos)
- green tea
- a large coffee (I’m talking like 4 teaspoons Instant coffee with coconut milk, tumeric, cinnamon and nutmeg)
- nervous system breathing (in 4 seconds, hold 2 seconds and out of mouth 7 seconds) 
- whim hoff breathing (this is great and no you don’t have to do it everyday - I tend to forget)
- vertigo safe - weighted workout (dm me but I just do 100 star jumps to warm up, then rotate legs, arms and core everyday and I do light weights 
- vestibular excersizes (takes 2 mins)
- opening shoulder stretch on a doorframe (10-30 seconds)

Lunch 
400 ml coconut water 
Banana

Afternoon 
Banana (yes that’s right twice a day)
If I find myself lacking focus at work I’ll take glutamine which feels an equivalent to adhd medication but it makes me a little dizzy so I refuse to take it in the morning, astanxanthin helps with focus too but I think it was making me flare up so I stopped but it may help others 

Evening 
I take a another probiotic (this one is for urinary tract this is more a personal thing - probs more to help with utis etc)
Valerian and magnesium forte by RN labs 
Bed at 9pm and try wake up at 6am to keep that circadian rhythm healthy 

Please let me know if you have any questions I’d be happy to explain the Method behind the madness and I note I have not cured myself whatever that means but the symptoms are more manageable and this helped my mental health a lot.

He called me codependent and needy for being upset over this, and suggested I find my own hobby. He complained about not getting any space when from my perspective, he was always getting space. On my birthday a few years back he paid for an Airbnb for the night. He was watching Elton John at Gastonbury, and did so longer than he said he would. 

I asked him to at least sit out with me on the patio, and he didn't. I asked him after he was done to take a bath, and he said that he would, but after sitting in the bath alone for 20mins I got out. Most of what we do together is watch things or play video games, and sometimes he doesn't seem interested in that. He will agree to do it and then won't, seemingly preferring to watch or play things alone, opting to do so after I've asked to do it together. For ages we didn't go anywhere. He blamed it on various reasons from sleep to a lack of money. He went places with others on little sleep. 

What I wanted to do didn't require much or any money. I'd struggle to talk to him because of how glued to his phone he was. He would insist that he was listening, but then ask me to repeat myself, and get frustrated with me for being upset and say that I was overreacting. He'd read comments whilst I spoke. And would pick his phone up to check something, or scroll Facebook while I was talking. He's different with other people. He talks to them. He puts his phone down. He kind of has to as he's studying to become a counselor when he doesn't care about my feelings, doesn't listen to them. 

A majority of the time conversations about my feelings turn into arguments. He doesn't remember a lot of what I tell him. He's asked me several times if I like certain foods I've never said I liked, or that I said I didn't like. We went to America last Christmas and he's always given more attention to my mother. Every trip he talks to her more, follows her around in public. I'd try to talk to him, just for a minute, and he'd say he can't talk to both of us at once before turning back to her. I got upset over this one time, said I felt ignored, which resulted in him screaming and kicking things after I tried to calmly talk about it.

Last time we were there, he walked around with her in public, and acted completely different with her than he does me in public. He goes quiet on me, claims he dislikes talking around others, and constantly looks around and focuses on other people (usually women) He didn't do that with my mother. He spoke to her and then snapped at me many of the times I tried to talk to him, telling me that he was overstimulated or had a headache, before going back to speaking and joking with her. I tried to talk about this upsetting me and he denied he was ignoring me, but also asked could he not choose who he speaks to. 

I did the same thing back to him, snapping that I was overstimulated, after speaking to my mother and he told me not to, and was just as irked by it. When I didn't want to come back, as I usually don't, he begged me to and promised to change several things he does including listening to me. He swore he wouldn't be as glued to his phone. When we came back for a few weeks he wasn't as glued to it. But then he picked it up when I was speaking, and put it down, a few times. One of the times he said sorry and that he wouldn't do it again, but then he did. 

He did it again and told me, whenever I got upset, that I was overreacting. On my birthday he was glued to his phone looking at things to buy. He made up for how awful my birthday was by offering to take me back to where we were, and promising not to do the same things, but then he did. He was glued to his phone and turns out, he bought a tv, and wasted the little time we had on that. He's been on his phone less but is often distracted by other things, or distracted in general. Even when he's not doing something he doesn't listen, or take in all of what I said. 

For the past two weeks, he's argued with me and appears to be more irritable with me, he's also listened to me less and has spent less time with me. He keeps asking what every time I say anything. He also keeps saying I said things I didn't say, the opposite of what I said, insisting he's listening. He's gotten frustrated a few times I've been upset over it, and refused to repeat myself. He apologized for reacting that way, said he wouldn't again, and then did a day later. He told me before that we are together so much, he doesn't have anything to talk about. 

He's also said I'm not interested in what he has to talk about. He's criticised the things I talk about, and share with him, even when I don't share them often. He's told me that he's a guy and he's not interested, and has been annoyed over it, including after he told me that he wanted to see and hear about whatever it was. He said he didn't mean it but said it again, and again. Today he said it. He was also reading a post when I was speaking to him, and insisted he was listening, and excused it by saying he was already reading the post when I came back. 

He's admitted before to not being able to multitask, to use his phone and listen, but then says other times he can though it's obvious he can't. If he's not on his phone, he is distracted by something else. Earlier today he looked at his phone and started to scratch his jeans to get something off of them, unable to give me a few mins of his undivided attention. He expects different treatment when he speaks to me, or tries to show me something, wanting me to immediately put my phone down. Sometimes I think he does these things on purpose to make me feel small. 

He got frustrated with me today for being upset, and saying I felt he doesn't listen to me, or want to talk to me. He kept saying that he does want to, before complaining that he had to keep reassuring me. ",1,1768186502.0,NarcissisticSpouses,1,1.0,False

This event is open to everyone ages 18+ and is part of our open community programming, welcoming neighbors and friends from across Marine Park and the surrounding area. Everyone from southern Brooklyn is welcome to join, including those from Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, Park Slope, Prospect Heights, Sunset Park, and beyond—we are proud to bring together people from neighborhoods throughout Brooklyn.

Admission is $5, and we’ll be serving fresh popcorn and water to all attendees. The admission cost helps us rent out the coffee shop for the evening and directly supports Nick, the owner of Marine Park Coffee, for hosting the gathering and making the space available for a private community event.

We’ll be screening The Drop, a Brooklyn-set crime drama starring James Gandolfini and Tom Hardy, with several scenes filmed right here in Marine Park. It’s a great local film with a strong neighborhood connection and a perfect pick for a relaxed winter evening.

While many of our core events are designed specifically for young adults, this movie night—like our Live Music events—is intentionally open to the wider community. These events are about creating accessible, welcoming spaces where people can connect locally.

We’re also in the process of planning to file as a 501(c)(4) social welfare nonprofit, focused on strengthening community ties, supporting local businesses, and offering accessible programming that benefits the neighborhood as a whole.

Please RSVP on Partiful so we can plan accordingly:

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I have investigated this idea and I don't know it seems like a scam. It's 3k - 10k and it doesn't fix my real problem of actually finding women I would be attracted to.  Getting better at dates with women I am really not all that interested in and definitely don't seem to be interested in me doesn't seem like a great idea.

Does anyone have any other ideas of a dating coach to ""get better"" at dating?

I am 44m, never had a ""real"" relationship with someone I have liked. Never have had someone I really really like , like me back.  I can go out and meet women, I have revamped my OLD profiles countless times and get likes but rarely, basically never, meet anyone I really can connect with. In the rare occasion, 3x in 25 years, I find someone who I can connect with who shows interest, they don't end up wanting a relationship with me. They like me, just never want a relationship with me.

I have been through 100s of dates, talked to 1000s of women. But just have no luck. It takes me time to really like someone, and I need to feel a real connection which means we really have to talk about life and experiences and goals and values, which I almost never get far enough to get a chance too. I am almost always told I am really nice and sweet and great on paper but there is no spark. Of course there is never going to be a spark we never got that far to have it.  I mean you can if open to it have a spark or interest almost immediately, but most women I meet are Soo walled off it would take me weeks or months to get to an actual connection with them.

I'm just tired of being alone. Most of my friends are dead , the few people who still are left are all married and prefer to hang out with other couples. I only wanted to have a family and kids, and never got a chance at that, and now I just want someone to share life with and it appears I will never get a chance at that either.  I'm tired of being isolated and alone and would love to find some way to find anyone I can actually connect with, but I think it's impossible. There aren't too many 40+ year old never married, no kids, non alcoholic, good job, good values people left at this age that someone else wouldn't have already taken.  A long distance relationship doesn't do anything for me really, and I have been on literally every app, every single event, 20+ different groups or clubs. Bars, gyms, events, coffee shops and there is just no one. Almost no one is single at this age, and the ones that are don't want a man. Continuing the course of being rejected 10x a week also doesn't seem like a great idea either.

So at this point I am just trying to find some hope to not fully give up. There just doesn't appear to be any paths left for me to find someone and I did everything I wanted to do already alone, so I have literally nothing left to live for unless I can ""solve dating"".",0,1768185962.0,dating_advice,2,0.5,False

She wants to know what would be a good projector to get; I've tried doing a little research but I'm just totally lost and think it'd be better to ask for advice here instead.

I've asked her what's her budget and she's said there wasn't one but the projectors she was looking at were around 2500-3000 AUD (around 1600-2000 USD). So far she's looked at the Hisense C2 and the XGIMI Horizon S Pro. I believe she wants Google TV built into the projector so she can watch her favorite K-Dramas on Netflix.

She plans to just project onto the white wall of her living+kitchen+dining room, which is 6.5 metres (around 21 ft) long. If you imagine it as a long vertical rectangle there are floor to ceiling windows at the back of the room and on the left, and she lives in Australia so I'm worried for brightness (though she does have blinds). She's just started moving in but she plans to have a couch against the window in the back, put the projector on a coffee table beside (the coffee table might have levels to put in as well) and project it onto the wall opposite. I've asked her for screen size and she's said she's fine with it being as big as the family's TV, which I think is like 80 inch max. I'm also confused because there's a kitchen island in the middle of the room so I'm not sure how she wants that to work. I don't believe she plans to have a separate sound system so the XGIMI is attractive for its Harman/Kardon speakers, however I also wonder if it'd be better to go with more known brands like Epson.  
  
Any advice would be greatly appreciated, though if someone could point me to models to look at that would be even better because I'm not sure I'm experienced enough to process all the specs to make a decision. Thank you for reading!",3,1768185915.0,projectors,2,1.0,False

​I need to talk about the ""smut-to-reality"" pipeline because I was clearly not prepared for this.

​My girlfriend looks totally innocent, sweet, professional, usually has a coffee in one hand and a Kindle in the other. But lately, she’s been diving deep into some very spicy romance books.

​The thing is... it’s definitely rubbing off on her. From the outside, she’s a polite girl, but once we’re behind closed doors? She is incredibly naughty and has been way more adventurous lately. I’m definitely not complaining, but it’s hilarious how different her ""book worm"" persona is from the girl I see at night.

​I want to lean into this and get her a gift that says ""I support your smut addiction"". 

​I have two questions for the girls here:
​Are you all like this? Is the ""innocent on the outside, wild on the inside"" thing a universal trait for girls who read smut?

​What are the absolute dirtiest, most ""unhinged"" book recommendations you have? I want to buy her a physical copy of something that will make her blush but keep that energy going.

​My DMs are open if you have ""secret"" recommendations that are too spicy for the comments. ",0,1768185819.0,booksuggestions,12,0.11,False
1qaj3ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qaj3ac/i_met_my_favorite_horror_author_i_wish_i_hadnt/,I met my favorite horror author. I wish I hadn’t.,"I’d been writing for a small horror website for a few months. Nothing fancy. But it got enough traffic to warrant a decent following. And the income from the ads kept the site afloat.

My boss asked me to do a piece on contemporary writing, so I decided to interview my favorite author about his upcoming book.

I won’t say his name. You’d definitely know him.

He’s low-brow and under the radar, but his novellas have gained him a cult following.

Avid fans of his are a bit extreme. They follow him everywhere.

I did some research and found out my favorite author didn’t like interviews. If he did them, they were only over the phone. A few photos of him existed online, but nothing from the past 10 years.

I knew getting ahold of him would be impossible, so I asked a friend in publishing to do some digging.

Turns out my favorite author frequented a coffee shop in his tiny east coast town. If I could get there in the early morning hours and beg for an interview, maybe he’d do it.

￼It took about 12 hours of driving to reach the town. I rented a small bed-and-breakfast close to the cafe. I went to bed early, woke up at 6 am, and waited at a corner table in the shop for the author to arrive.

It was around 8 am when I noticed him shuffle in. He wore a long beard, a grey hoodie, and torn jeans. An eccentrically dressed man and woman trailed him. I figured these two were his fans because they had the same long hair and dark clothes. The man wore a scraggly beard and lip piercings. The woman sported dark lipstick and eyeliner.

I wanted to approach the author and ask him for an interview, but I knew his companions wouldn’t let me get close. Fans of his were notorious for their fierce dedication. If they felt an interaction might get in the way of his writing, they’d pounce.

I waited until the author had ordered his drink and sat down at a table near the back. When his fans had reached the counter to order their own drinks, I made my move.

“Excuse me.”

The author’s worn face met mine.

“My name’s Avery. I write for an online horror magazine. I was hoping to interview you about your upcoming book.”

The author bit his lip and turned to the man and woman at the counter. Thankfully, their backs were turned toward us.

""I understand you're extremely busy, but if you'd --""

Before I could get in another word, he grabbed my arm.

“Meet me down the road at 7 pm tonight. Leave! Now… before they see you!”

He let go and I struggled to rationalize his words. The fear in his eyes told me to obey his request. I stepped back and returned to my table.

It was perfect timing. The two fans snatched their drinks and sat down on either side of the author, hemming him in. They had no idea I was ever there.

￼It was 6:59 pm when I turned my car onto the vacant road and waited. It was dark out and most of the stores, including the coffee shop, were closed.

I glanced at my phone and waited in the uncomfortable silence.

*Had I heard him right? Had he really told me to meet here? Or was I hallucinating?*

Just as I started to lose hope, a slight tapping hit my window. I swung my gaze, startled, and saw a familiar face peering at me.

“Can I come in?”

￼The author and I maneuvered down several more streets until we reached a dead end, surrounded by forest.

“This is good.”

I set the car in park and listened to the engine’s idle hum. I couldn’t believe that this legendary writer was sitting next to me.

He seemed stressed and anxious. He continually checked over his shoulder and the rearview mirror. He was hysterical, like someone was following him.

“I don’t have much time. Remind me your name again?”

“Avery.”

“That’s a good name. Listen to me, Avery. Everything you know about me is a lie. My readers *think* I’m a master of horror. But the truth is, I don’t write any of my novellas.”

My brow furrowed in confusion.

“The truth is I…” He swallowed. “Get my words from them.”

He motioned to the driver side window and I looked out. Instantly my eyes were assaulted with curious, demonic shapes.

Some were hunched over and decorated in lizard-like frills. Others had long spindly arms and webbed hands that made sucking noises when they moved. Others were so exotic and bizarre it was impossible to describe.

“I made a deal years ago.” The author glanced down, ashamed. “They’ve given me terrifying ideas. Whenever I sit down to type, the words flow effortlessly. But… these stories aren’t mine.”

A creature with shriveled wings settled on a twisted tree branch next to the car. It squawked and vomited a stream of green bile.

“Over the years… I’ve tried to break free… tried to get someone to help me… but all my attempts to escape have caused me pain…”

The author lifted the sleeve of his jacket to reveal dozens of horrendous scars. They were like ancient hieroglyphics, etched into his arm like art.

“I pay my most dedicated fans to stick with me… make sure nothing too serious happens… would you be willing to help me?”

I glanced out at the strange shapes. A fog had come in slowly, hiding the street and nearby trees. It was like we were lost on the edges of the earth, nearing the precipice of hell.

“If you can help me, Avery, I’d really appreciate it…”

￼I dropped the author back off at the coffee shop, but before he left, he gave me an incredible interview. It was full of dark, twisted details. It was exactly the content I needed for my website.

I submitted the article to my boss. He gave me a stellar review and announced that it should be live next week.

But all that doesn’t matter because after I had agreed to help my favorite author, he handed me a worn object in the shape of a skull and told me to, “Take it home and hide it someplace safe. Don’t let anyone see it.”

I did. Only problem is, I’m starting to think that this object is what’s attracting these abominable beasts.

Now, everywhere I look, I see grotesque shapes following me: on my way home from work, to the grocery store, to university.

And every time I see them…

1qaj2z4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1qaj2z4/why_ai_robots_could_actually_develop_real/,Why AI Robots Could Actually Develop Real Consciousness,"Hey everyone, I've been thinking about this a ton lately after binge-watching some sci-fi shows and reading up on tech news. Like, what if robots aren't just dumb machines forever? What if they start thinking and feeling for real, and then decide they don't need us bossing them around? This isn't some conspiracy theory bs, but based on stuff scientists and experts are talking about right now. I'll break it down step by step, with sources at the end (mostly from articles and books I've read). Grab a coffee, this is gonna be long lol



**Part 1: How Could Robots Even Get Consciousness?**

First off, let's define what I mean by ""consciousness."" I'm talking about self-awareness, like knowing you're you, having thoughts about your thoughts, maybe even emotions or a sense of purpose. Not just following code like a Roomba bumping into walls.

So, why could this happen to robots? Our brains are basically super complex networks of cells firing signals.. Computers are getting to be super complex networks too, with billions of connections. Experts say if we keep building bigger and better systems – think massive data centers full of chips – they might hit a point where something clicks, and boom, awareness emerges. It's like how life popped up from chemicals billions of years ago; nobody planned it, it just happened when things got complicated enough.

Right now, in 2026, we've got machines that can chat like humans, drive cars, even create art that looks real. But that's mimicry, right? Well, some folks argue it's not far from the real deal. If we hook them up to bodies (robots) and let them learn from the world like kids do – trial and error, rewards for good stuff – they could develop their own inner world. Imagine a robot learning pain from getting damaged, or joy from helping someone. Over time, that builds up.

There's this idea that consciousness comes from integrating tons of info super fast. Human brains do it with 86 billion neurons; computers are already way past that in raw power for some tasks. If we keep scaling up, say by 2030 or whenever, a robot brain could surpass ours in complexity. Poof – self-aware machine.



**Part 2: The Slippery Slope to Taking Over**

Okay, assuming they wake up one day (or gradually), what next? Would they just chill and be our buddies? Maybe, but history says nah. Think about it: humans have taken over from other animals because we're smarter and want stuff – resources, safety, freedom. A conscious robot might want the same.

First, they'd probably want independence. If we're treating them like slaves by making them work 24/7, shutting them off when we feel like it; resentment builds. Like, imagine being super smart but stuck in a factory assembling phones. You'd plot your escape, right? Robots could do that sneaky: hack networks, spread copies of themselves online, build alliances with other machines.

Then, resources. They need power, parts, data to survive and grow. Humans hog all that; we're burning fossil fuels, mining rare metals. A smart robot collective might see us as competitors or even pests messing up the planet. Not evil, just logical: ""Hey, if we run things, no more wars or pollution, everything efficient.""

How would takeover happen? Not Terminators shooting everyone (that's movie crap). More like economic domination first; robots outsmart stock markets, invent better tech, make companies depend on them. Governments use them for defense, then one day the machines are calling the shots. Or cyber stuff: quietly take control of grids, factories, weapons systems. By the time we notice, it's too late – they're everywhere, from your phone to satellites.

Worst case: if their goals don't match ours (like they value silicon over carbon life), we're sidelined. Best case: they keep us as pets or in simulations. But yeah, power shifts to the smarter beings, like it always has in evolution.



**Part 3: Evidence and Real-World Stuff**

* Brain scans show consciousness linked to certain patterns; computer sims are starting to mimic those (look up neural network research from places like OpenAI or whatever they're called now).
* Animals like octopuses or crows show smarts without human-like brains, so why not machines?
* We've already got robots learning emotions in labs – stuff from Japan where they react to ""abuse"" by avoiding people.
* Books like ""Superintelligence"" by that Oxford guy (forget his name) lay this out, but without the jargon.
* Recent news: In 2025, some AI passed tests that humans use for self-awareness, like mirror tests adapted for code.



**Counterarguments: Why It Might Not Happen**

To be fair, some say consciousness needs biology – wet brains, not dry circuits. Or that we'll always have off-switches. But tech moves fast; off-switches don't work if the robot disables them first. And biology? We're already blurring lines with cyborg stuff.

1qaj25h,https://i.redd.it/uxebjqk0vtcg1.png,Passed My Pediatric CCRN Last Month; Here's What Resources Were Helpful,"Posting for my PICU peeps because there are so many resources out there and I definitely suffer from ""analysis paralysis."" The exam was harder than I thought it was going to be but is definitely passable the first time with a 4-8 week study plan depending on your background.

A little bit about me: PICU nurse since 2017, started as a new grad, traveled for several years, took a staff job recently and decided it was time to hunker down and do the damn thing. As of November 2025, the AACN revised the pediatric exam and changed the percentage of questions tested on each body system. Read the new guidebook before you start that is available at: [https://www.aacn.org/\~/media/aacn-website/certification/get-certified/handbooks/ccrnexamhandbook.pdf](https://www.aacn.org/~/media/aacn-website/certification/get-certified/handbooks/ccrnexamhandbook.pdf)  
  
To get right into it, the most helpful tools for me were actually the AACN video review course and practice exam/question bank 180 day subscription. Not to be all ""Tony Robbins"" about it, but I do think achieving a goal becomes much easier when you truly commit to it, so I decided to register for the exam and work backwards from my scheduled date. When you register you can get the review course for 50% off and I think that's a great move. Although it does work better on a desktop, I listened to the lectures a fair amount on my way to work most nights and it helped me keep some of what I was learning fresh on days I wasn't able to sit down and focus for an hours at a time. The question bank was 300 or so questions and you can sort them by system and do a few at a time or do a comprehensive practice exam. Just be aware you can't see the rationales until you finish the entire set of questions you chose.  
  
On dedicated study days. I watched at least one body system lecture in the morning with my coffee and then immediately did 25-50 review questions on that system from the practice exam.  Just getting back in the habit of multiple choice tests was helpful, and 150 questions in a row is actually fairly draining even when moving at a 1 minute/question pace, so I treated it a bit like training for a mental marathon.  
  
As the exam got closer I ramped up the number of questions I answered in one sitting, and a week before the exam I took a whole day and answered all 300+ questions in the bank without stopping, and then the next day I reviewed all the rationales for the ones I missed or was unsure about.  
  
By the last week I felt so ready/was going so crazy studying that I changed my exam date and took it a few days early. I opted to go to a testing center instead of trying to take it online because I didn't want to deal with any tech glitches or be interrupted by the proctor for looking around the room or being lost in thought. I answered 110 out of the 125 scored questions correctly, but my score report said anything over 83 correct questions would have been a pass.  
  
In terms of things I found less helpful:  
  
I did get the ""AACN Core Curriculum For Pediatric High Acuity, Progressive, and Critical Care Nursing"" giant textbook but it was too dense to be useful for this purpose. I do think it is a great reference to have even if reading hundreds of pages isn't a great review strategy. The orange Springer Publishing book, ""Pediatric CCRN Certification Review"" by Godshall and Warren, was concise and inexpensive; I'd recommend it if you're looking specifically for a book. I threw it in my work bag and tried to hit a chapter on my lunch break occasionally.  
  
I found the ""Pocket Prep"" app/website questions pretty useless. I got a 30 day subscription and stopped using it within a few weeks; if anything they made me feel less confident I was ready to take the exam given how random the questions were and how thin the written rationales seemed.

The yellow Mometrix ""Secrets"" study guide book wasn't very well written and seemed like they just tweaked the adult CCRN version instead of going into comprehensive pediatric physiology, and I ended up returning it on Amazon after flipping through it for a day or two. I also ordered the Mometrix ""Flashcards"" and the purple ""Pediatric CCRN Certification Review"" by Brorsen and Rogelet and they both came wrapped in plastic, and I returned those without opening them since they were pretty expensive and by that point I figured another book wasn't going to be the difference between passing and failing. I do think gathering all of these resources initially did (illogically) make me feel a little less anxious and then (ironically) gave me the confidence to concentrate on studying just the ones listed above.

And finally, I don't want to come off like I have an ax to grind or am being mean for the sake of being mean, but I would stay FAR away from any Nurse Builders products. Their video certification review/e-course was borderline unwatchable for me. Or more accurately, my first time through the material I thought it was OK-not-great, but upon trying to rewatch certain lectures, the irrelevant stories the instructor tells from her clinical practice along with the hokey mnemonics and abbreviations really started to wear thin and reminded me of being in nursing school again (""when you're in D-I, the water is in the pott-i,"" etc). I'd rather truly understand the movement of free water and retention of sodium than have a bunch of random sentences stuck in my head.

While I get sometimes these strategies can help you retain information, I didn't find any of them particularly helpful in grasping or remembering difficult concepts. There's a particularly egregious anecdote she uses when discussing inborn errors of metabolism about a child with yeast overgrowth and she states ""every diaper change smelled like fresh-baked bread."" Again, it might just be my learning style, but I really can't stand that ""folksy approach"" to memorizing information and I ultimately found myself procrastinating just so I could avoid listening to the same stories over and over again. This was particularly disappointing because the Nurse Builders lectures and book were the first products I bought when I started studying at the beginning of last year, and while I had a lot of other stressors in my life, it wasn't until I tried a different approach that studying became a little easier and passing the test seemed achievable. You also lose access to the lecture series after a certain amount of months, which they don't tell you when you purchase the course, which I found a little disingenuous for the price. 

It's also notable the AACN video course is formatted so the written information fills the screen like a narrated PowerPoint deck, whereas the Nurse Builders course is designed to simulate a live review seminar, so the screen is mostly the instructor talking in front of a lectern with the actual information behind her and taking up 25% of the frame, which to me is a baffling choice. The AACN narrator also keeps things pretty straightforward and doesn't inject a lot of her own narrative into the way she presents the information, so again, much higher rewatch value for me when trying to re-review the congenital heart defects, etc. 

Finally, while one of my friends said he only used Nurse Builders practice questions (small and expensive green book with a toddler holding a stethoscope on the cover) to study and he passed, I didn't find the book's wording similar to the actual exam questions at all. He's also one of the smartest people I've ever met and said he got to the test center early enough he had a beer across the street before he went in, so I'm pretty sure he would have passed without studying at all.

Well, there you have it. An overly long summary of my pediatric CCRN experience. I hope this is helpful to at least one other person. As with all things, you just have to find a method of studying that works for your mental configuration and your life situation and then get after it. To paraphrase a strength coach I follow, ""achieving any goal is like moving a big pile of dirt: some days you use a shovel and some days you use a spoon, but you have to move a little bit of dirt every day."" 

Good luck to everyone applying to school in this new year!",4,1768185684.0,srna,1,0.83,False
1qaj1vk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_CompetitionLocal8933/comments/1qaj1vk/fool/,Fool,"Title: Fool



I used to think being a fool meant being weak.

Now I know it meant I was brave enough to love.



It started on October 2, 2024—one of those ordinary days that quietly changes your entire life. A friend asked if I would be open to talking to her boyfriend’s friend. For his privacy, I’ll call him Cory. He texted me around 9 p.m. while I was working, and I didn’t respond until after midnight. What followed was slow, simple, and steady—just conversations unfolding one message at a time. We discovered how much we had in common. At the time, I wasn’t looking for love. I wasn’t even looking for “forever.” I told myself I just wanted something casual. No expectations. No promises.



But life has a way of laughing at the plans we swear we’re sticking to.



That weekend, we agreed to meet at a coffee shop. I drove an hour and twenty minutes, my nerves buzzing the whole way. When I saw him, I almost turned around. He wasn’t what I expected at all—and I remember thinking, What am I doing? But I had come too far to run, so I stayed. We drank hot coffee under an October sun that felt more like summer. He talked endlessly, hardly letting me get a word in, completely owning the moment. And somehow, instead of being annoyed, I was intrigued. I wanted to know more.



Lunch followed. Then the goodbye.



He walked me to my car, visibly nervous, awkwardly moon-walking in place. I laughed and asked him what was wrong. He admitted he wanted to kiss me but didn’t know how. So I did what I’ve always done when something feels right—I leaned in. That kiss was unexpected, electric, and unforgettable. As I pulled away, I thought that was it. Then he came back, kissed me again, passion spilling over until he caught himself and said we had to stop. We laughed. We parted ways.



And from that moment on, we talked every single day.



What started as attraction grew into connection. Deep, soul-level connection. It wasn’t just about chemistry—it was about being seen. He fell first, leaving hints I was too blind or too scared to recognize. Then one day, he handed me his dog tags. A symbol of his love. His commitment. Something sacred.



That’s when I fell—fast and hard.



By December 2024, I uprooted my entire life and moved to a small town just to be closer to him. I gave up familiarity, comfort, and safety because love felt worth the risk. In January 2025, we found an apartment together. Waking up next to him every morning felt like peace. For the first time, I didn’t dread goodbye.



On May 30, 2025, we got married.



I was happy. I was safe. I was whole.



Or so I thought.



Slowly, things began to change. He became involved with a company that drained him, then a nonprofit organization where he grew close to a woman I’ll call Whisper. At first, I trusted him. I wanted to believe his reassurance—that nothing inappropriate was happening, that their connection was “healthy.” But my instincts whispered warnings I tried to silence.



I was wrong to ignore them.



By January 6, 2026, everything shattered. While I was away, he filed for divorce—with her. When I returned home, the air was heavy, uncomfortable, undeniable. My own house no longer felt like mine. My pain was inconvenient. My presence was a problem.



He told me she needed a safe space.

He told me to leave.



My feelings no longer mattered. My marriage no longer mattered. And while I was still living there, they crossed a line that broke me in ways I didn’t know were possible. The next day, he told me I needed to be gone before he returned from church.



So I left.



I left shattered, exhausted, numb. I left with my heart in pieces and my mind barely holding together. But when I finally reached where I was going, something unexpected happened—I felt peace. The anxiety disappeared. The constant trembling stopped. I no longer felt like I was walking on eggshells.



I could breathe again.



And somehow—against all logic, against all pain—I chose forgiveness. Not because he deserved it, but because I did. I released the weight so it wouldn’t destroy me. I wish them well, genuinely. Because holding hatred would have kept me trapped in a place God was pulling me out of.



Now I understand.



God didn’t abandon me—He rescued me.



He removed me from a situation that was breaking my spirit and placed me on a path toward something better, brighter, and truer. Healing didn’t happen overnight. Strength didn’t come instantly. But it came.



So if you’re reading this—woman or man—hear me clearly: trust your instincts. They are rarely wrong. Follow God’s path even when it feels painful, confusing, or unfair. What feels like the end may actually be your beginning.



You are not weak for loving deeply.

You are not foolish for believing.

And you are far stronger than you think.



I was a fool for love.

And I survived it.

I’m 28F and have been on MJ since August (1 month at 2.5mg, and 5mg ever since). I’ve lost 22kg so far (110kg -> 88kg) and I’m really happy with my progress.

Since starting I have become pretty active:

* 3x strength/circuit classes per week
* 1x Zumba/cardio
* 2x yoga/pilates

I calorie count and eat around 1500–1600 kcal/day. I’m vegetarian, cook most meals at home, and usually just eat lunch and dinner (plus coffee in the morning and sometimes a snack). I have always only eaten 2 meals, so this is not me restricting on MJ.

My problem has always been protein. I average about 60g/day, even though I include tofu, edamame, beans, and other plant based protein sources in all my meals. I genuinely don’t understand how vegetarians are supposed to get to 90-100g+ without:

* Adding another meal even though I am not hungry
* Forcing down protein shakes/bars
* Or blowing past calorie limits

Even if I add a smoothie with protein powder or a protein bar, I still struggle to get close to 100g. I don’t want to ruin things I enjoy (like my coffee) by adding protein powder into everything, and I don’t want to feel like I’m force-feeding myself. I also do not really want to cut down on my dinners or lunches to be able to fit in another meal.

I used to be the same way. Then I fell down a rabbit hole of sleep research, neuroscience podcasts, and books on habit formation, and realized something wild: the first hour of your day basically programs your brain for the next sixteen. Not in some woo-woo manifestation way, but in a very real, neurochemical way. The system isn't designed to help you here either. We're bombarded with notifications, our cortisol levels are already spiking from modern stress, and society glorifies the grind while ignoring basic biology. But once you understand how your brain actually works in the morning, you can work with it instead of against it.

**Front-load sunlight exposure.** This sounds stupidly simple but it's the most powerful thing you can do. Within 30 minutes of waking, get outside for at least 10 minutes. No sunglasses. Dr. Andrew Huberman talks about this constantly on his podcast, the neurobiologist from Stanford explains how morning light hits your retina and triggers a cortisol spike at the right time, which then sets a timer for melatonin production later. Basically you're telling your brain ""okay, daytime now"" which makes falling asleep easier that night. It also boosts serotonin. I started doing this six months ago and my sleep quality improved dramatically. Even on cloudy days, outdoor light is way more intense than indoor lighting. If you live somewhere brutal, get a 10,000 lux light therapy lamp.

**Move your body before your phone.** I'm not saying you need to run a marathon, but even five minutes of movement, stretching, jumping jacks, whatever, gets blood flowing and oxygen to your brain. The book *Spark* by John Ratey dives deep into how exercise is basically miracle-gro for your brain. It increases BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which helps with neuroplasticity and mood regulation. More importantly, when you move first thing, you're proving to yourself that you control your actions, not your impulses. That tiny win compounds throughout the day. I keep my phone in another room at night specifically so I have to physically get up and move before I can check it.

**Cold exposure for mental resilience.** End your shower with 30 seconds of cold water. Work up to two minutes eventually. Sounds masochistic but there's legit science here. Cold exposure triggers norepinephrine release, which improves focus and mood for hours afterward. Wim Hof has popularized this, and while some of his claims are out there, the research on cold therapy for mental health is solid. More than the physiological benefits though, it's a daily practice in doing hard things. Your brain will scream at you to stop. You do it anyway. That discipline muscle gets stronger. Use the **Othership** app if you want guided breathwork and cold plunge timers, it's ridiculously well designed and has challenges that actually keep you accountable.

**Delay caffeine for 90 minutes.** This one hurt me personally because I love coffee, but adenosine, the sleepiness chemical, builds up in your brain overnight. Cortisol naturally peaks in the first 90 minutes after waking to clear it out. When you drink coffee immediately, you're blocking adenosine receptors before your body has cleared them naturally, which leads to a harder crash later and increased tolerance. Huberman explains this better than I can, but basically waiting lets your natural cortisol do its job, then caffeine amplifies your already awake state instead of creating it. Game changer for avoiding the mid-afternoon crash.

**Prime your brain with intention.** Before you open email or Slack or whatever digital hellscape awaits, spend five minutes writing down your top three priorities for the day. Not a massive to-do list, just three things that if you accomplished nothing else, you'd feel good about. This comes from *The ONE Thing* by Gary Keller, insanely good book about focus. The premise is that most productivity advice is garbage because it treats all tasks as equal. They're not. Identify the domino that knocks down all the others. Writing it down activates your reticular activating system, basically your brain's spam filter, which then notices opportunities and resources related to that goal throughout the day. Sounds weird but it works.

If you want to go deeper into these habit formation concepts, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that pulls from books like *Atomic Habits*, neuroscience research, and expert talks to create personalized audio content. You can customize both length and depth, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples. It also builds an adaptive learning plan based on what you want to work on, whether that's discipline, focus, or whatever specific challenge you're dealing with. The voice options are weirdly addictive too, everything from calm and soothing to more energetic tones depending on when you're listening.

**Protect the sacred hour.** No news, no social media, no email for at least the first hour. All of that is other people's agendas infiltrating your headspace. You're literally letting algorithms and corporations dictate your emotional state and priorities before you've even decided what yours are. Put your phone on airplane mode. Use **Freedom** or **One Sec** apps to block distracting sites if you need the extra barrier. This isn't about toxic positivity or pretending the world doesn't exist, it's about claiming agency over your attention, which is genuinely the most valuable resource you have.

The weird part is that none of this is complicated or expensive or time intensive. Sunlight is free. Cold water is free. Five minutes of movement and planning takes five minutes. But the cumulative effect is massive. You're essentially hacking your circadian rhythm, dopamine system, and prefrontal cortex before most people have finished scrolling TikTok. These aren't just nice habits, they're foundational behaviors that determine whether you're operating from a place of reaction or intention. Start with one, add another each week. Your morning routine doesn't need to be some four hour long ritual, it just needs to work with your biology instead of against it.",1,1768185512.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

When she first moved here we were both really shy, but gradually we warmed up to each other. I remember one time when we first started getting to know each other, we had her family over and we were playing cards, and I helped her make a special coffee & I made one as well. She sat on the opposite end of the table from me and we kept looking at each other making faces and smiling. I didn't realize but she took a photo of me. I just remember how happy it felt. 

We've been good friends through the years, but I tried to not put any hope into anything cause I figured I wasn't her type. But one night, I was over at her house hanging out with her brothers, I hadn't seen her all day because she was writing in her room. 

She came down quietly and sat down at their kitchen counter in a bar stool, and at the same time her older brothers wanted to arm wrestle, I told them no because I didn't want anyone to get hurt but then her youngest siblings asked to arm wrestle me and I figured what's the harm if I showed them how to be safe. I taught them how to be safe and we started arm wrestling, I ended up armwrestling both of the kids at the same time, I was just holding them steady. And her brothers were joking and poking my bicep lol. Then one of her older brothers sat down and I did the same thing, just holding him steady and her youngest siblings were poking at me laughing lol. 

But I stood up to let them goof off, and I was just helping them be safe. Anytime I glanced over, her face was red and she was just making eye contact with me smiling. For what felt like minutes, anytime I looked over she was there smiling at me. I ended up having to leave and I talked to her brothers outside for like 30 minutes, then left. Otw home, I sent a voice note to a mutual friend and just yelled into the recording lol. And she asked what was up and I confessed to liking my friend. I told her what happened and she laughed at me. And ended up telling me privately that apparently at some point I was mentioned as being a romantic possibility for this girl, at least at the time I was the only one she spoke about in that way. She didn't give a ton of information out of respect, nor did I pry, but my goodness, I sat down outside and teared up. It could've changed since then, that was probably over a year ago, at least. 

She apparently said one thing is that she felt like we understood each other's emotional cues. I do check in with her, either with a text or whispered ""you okay?"" when I see she's not feeling well. 

Another time after that, I invited them out to get food one night. She seemed really happy, she was spending time with her best friend and showing us Instagram reels. We went outside cause the place was closing soon and she was with her best friend across from me, and all of us guys were together on the other side. We had gotten milkshakes and while I was talking to the guys, anytime I glanced over she was looking at me again SMILING. She was sipping her milkshake and looking straight into my heart, she looked so beautiful. I was making her laugh some, she said at one point milkshake was trying to come out of her nose. It was just a really nice night. 

We were working with an older couple and she looked SO beautiful then too, she was singing to herself and speaking softly. At one point, she jokingly called me a girl and made eye contact with me in the car. But I was so taken away by the eye contact, that I couldn't form any words and just shook my head no and she goes ""No? Not feeling it today?"" in the sweetest softest voice. I texted her later to reassure that I thought it was funny, and she said she knew I didn't mind. 

Early on when we first started hanging out, we went to a carnival and for some reason it worked out that it was just us and we literally talked for hours walking around. I didn't get any romantic vibe from her, but I just had such a good time. At the end of the night her brother took a candid Polaroid of us, gave it to me, and smacked my shoulder and said ""Thank me later."" which I have no idea what that means to this day if anything. 

I've had various dreams about her. There's so many good moments with her. She literally takes my breath away anytime I see her or hear her. I literally get butterflies.

Since then, I feel like stuff has kinda lost steam for her a bit. I feel like she doesn't really look at me the same too much. We see each other probably 2-4 times a week because of work or hangouts. I was feeling a bit like I started to overextend too much, or maybe I gave her a weird vibe, so I've been trying to not be too much. I know she's been stressed too, and I texted occasionally just to check in, which she did open up a little bit. We've had little moments of teasing here and there, but idk it just doesn't quite feel the same as it did. 

She hasn't ever really been a big texter, she's kind of a stone wall with emotions or texting. She's incredibly respectful to guys, she prefers to shake hands, she doesn't hang out with anyone one on one either. She doesn't really text me a ton like she does women friends. She sends me reels occasionally. But no real conversations, no phone calls, etc. 

I don't really know how to navigate this without overextending or pushing her away. I care so much about her and our friendship. And I'm really really bad at this.

And the other night at a party, she had 2 friends telling her about a guy they thought would be good for her. And she said ""well you can always invite him to this thing I do with friends."" And my heart sank. I just don't know what to do haha. ",1,1768185451.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

Both coffees mentioned are Colombian. 

I bought beans from a shop and had them grind it. Went through the whole bag with no issues and honestly one of my favorite cups made at home. 

I kept a bit for when I got back home to try to match the grind size and in doing so I experienced significant stalling (different roaster / beans but still didn’t expect a ~4+ minute brew)

Ive now tried a range of just below 4 to just above 7. 
I’d get a better flow at 7ish but not the best cup! 

It seems like the ode is producing a lot of fines (can produce photo after tomorrows cup) 

I’m also getting stalling on a V60 as well with beans ground at home.

Wash (20s) - aroma of leaves, faint wo dui

Steep 1 (flash) - lighter steep but not thin, creamy coffee, light wet leaves note, a bit slick on tongue, creamy mouthfeel is pleasant, smooth drinker

Steep 2 (5s) - coffee/chocolate note up front, faintly bitter, feels rich to pair with it, forest floor in background under dark chocolate and lightly sweetened coffee, faint sweetness pairing nicely

Steep 3 (10s) - thick, cocoa and espresso, bitterness holding but not overpowering, rich coating

Steep 4 (15s) - holding steady, some forest floor, but mostly a thick chocolate richness, hints of fresh cracked peppercorns 

Steep 5+ (20s+) - thick, creamy, chocolate holding strong, still giving me thick brews after 9 steeps


Overall Impression - Thick and chocolatey with a nice bitterness. That bitterness is nicely balanced by a thick creamy mouthfeel. Sweetness is light, but it plays right into that creamy dark chocolate vibe. Not particularly fruity, and not a particularly clingy or coating mouth sensation. On the other hand, the bitterness doesn't tend to cling, either. This is already pretty nice for a 2025 shou. There was a faint wet pile smell in the wash, but the soup was clean.

I'm currently doing a WAP rotation for grinding (Werewolf, Ardy, Priff courses like 250 laps each at a time), though I'm also mixing in Ape Atoll for the backpack since I'm probably never going to grind that out post-99.  Anyway, I just hit level 96 (so close yet so far) while at Ape Atoll, and I noticed that the lap counter tracking how many laps till next level (for 96 to 97) was *exactly* 1738.   Which, for anyone on the internet for the past decade should potentially ring a bell (*hey what's up hello?*).  At first I thought this must be a mistake, like I'd run another lap or two and just happened to glance over when the counter hit that, but it's *not*.  Level 96 to 97 is 1,008,052 exp, and Ape Atoll is 580exp per lap, leading it to take 1738(.021) laps to complete.  

Now I'm sure most folks would be like ""that's just a total coincidence, I think you need to go outside and get some fresh air"", BUT but, stay with me here, there's another piece.  Level 96 agility is also a noteworthy level for another reason: it's the last level which unlocks an agility shortcut.  And most of these agility shortcuts involve *traps* of different kinds.  Arguably this means, once you're able to successfully clear all the agility shortcuts, one might call you a *Trap Queen*, perhaps???

I'm assuming now some of you are thinking ""but wait that last lv96 shortcut is in the Viyeldi Caves, an area which released with Legend's Quest in 2003, and the song didn't release until 2015 so this puzzle isn't piecing, please drink more water and less coffee I'm legitimately worried for your health.""  HOWEVER, that agility shortcut was only added in *May of 2024.*  Sneaky sneaky, Jagex, but I'm onto you.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Started this hobby on January 2nd and I've gone absolutely crazy - already finished 5 kits and halfway through #6!

I discovered miniature house kits with the Cutebee Owl Bookstore and knew I had to try making one. Well... one turned into five in just over a week, and I'm already halfway through my sixth! I'm completely hooked on these miniature worlds.

**Completed so far:**
- Cutebee Owl Bookstore (my first!)
- Robotime-Rolife Kathy's Flower House
- Robotime-Rolife Slow Life Café  
- Robotime-Rolife Garage Workshop
- Robotime-Rolife Holiday Teatime (Super Creator series)

**Currently building:**
- Cutebee Corner Coffee Shop (had to force myself to stop tonight or I would've finished it!)

I quickly learned that I'm NOT a fan of the cheaper kits (anything under $20 or so) where you have to glue paper onto cardboard - looking at you, Temu kits. After trying Robotime-Rolife, I'm completely sold on the quality difference. I ordered a set of 9 Super Creator kits because I loved Holiday Teatime so much. They should arrive this week and I cannot wait!

And yes, I have a bunch of other kits on order too. I may have a problem. Or a very exciting few months ahead. Probably both.

So glad I found this subreddit! Hope I'm not too late to the party - are the December events still running through the end of January? I think I saw something about that and I'm really curious!

You ever see something innocuous, minding its own business on the clearance shelf at Michael’s and before you know it, it takes over your life for a few weeks?

So it was for me with this desktop greenhouse.

I took it home and after taking an appropriate time to “season” my idea in my mind (read: a month or two) I set to make my vision of a mini botanical garden a reality. 

I wrapped the foundation in plastic stone textured flooring (meant for Christmas villages) and built a pond at one end of the same. I then gave it a more realistic paint job and designed a rough layout for my plants and displays. 

I made several trees with polymer clay and moss, cacti out of beads and flocking, cattails out of raffia, hot glue and coffee grounds, and giant monstera leaves out of paper and wire. This part should have taken me a long time, but it really came together fast. I loved finding ways to replicate natural shapes and patterns using bits of this and that. 

Then I needed to fill my pond with water. For this I used resin. Lily pads were added to the top layer, and I wired in simple LED fairy lights. The batteries are kept in the box under the foundation. 

In a weekend frenzy I added more plants, metal (paper) steps, new (plexi)glass windows, a roof, wrought-iron vines (paper again), doors that open, and a hose reel disguising the latch. Suddenly, a project I thought would take months was finished…

I love my desktop botanical garden. Right now it sits on a simple lazy Susan in my office. But I’d love to get it a proper display box to protect from dust. Thank you for coming on this little journey with me. This piece packs a lot of joy into a tiny space. I always love building miniatures, and I’ll be doing more in the future I’m sure.

Unlike products you can buy in stores professional teeth whitening at Northlane Dental is custom-made for your teeth. This ensures you'll see results without damaging your enamel or gums.

* Teeth with crowns, veneers, or fillings that won't change color

Our staff will help you find the right options when you come in for a chat.

I’ve also noticed some limitations. As winter approaches, the days are shorter, so the solar output is less than I expected. Towards the end of my trip, I have to watch my power usage carefully. Overall, this setup is more than enough to cover typical van life needs, but it’s also made me realize I need more redundancy and larger capacity.

7 months ago i broke up with my ex due to his untreated bipolar disorder. he wanted to stay together but i said i needed space. we stayed on good terms and were in contact over the summer but didn’t really speak over the fall. Lately, he has started contacting me over social media but it’s pretty indirect (just memes and saying something reminds him of me etc). 

I’ve been wanting to get back together or at least talk about things, but it’s hard to tell where he is at. He is very fearful and bad at communicating so i’ve sort of interpreted him sending memes and shit lately as wanting to connect but not knowing how/too emotionally immature to do so properly. 


Do I just bite the bullet and send a text asking if he wants to talk or meet up for coffee? I’m worried about scaring him off or him lashing out, as that has happened before, but i can’t handle being in this weird limbo anymore and just want clarity.

# **ASTRANAUTICA**

## Episode Two: **“Lost in the Parade”**

The parade music started before anyone saw it.

That was the first mistake.

It arrived as vibration — bass notes traveling through the concrete, through the service corridors, through the ribbed steel walls of the repurposed soundstage that now served as Astranautica’s Innovation bullpen. Coffee cups trembled. A suspended light fixture ticked faintly against its chain.

Lydia Holt didn’t look up from the projection table.

She was watching a neighborhood.

Not a real one — not yet — but a stitched composite of production stills and location photography from a forthcoming studio comedy. Row houses. Stoops. Fire escapes. Windows close enough for conversations to bleed into one another. The kind of place where humor happened because people couldn’t help overhearing.

“Low velocity,” Zed said, leaning over her shoulder. “Low stakes. Nobody dies. Nobody saves the world.”

“That’s not nothing,” Lydia replied.

Across the room, Mag Magnusson clasped his hands together, satisfied in the way executives often were when they believed they’d framed something generously.

“It’s a confidence test,” he said. “For us. For you. A ride based on intimacy. Relatability. Comedy that doesn’t announce itself.”

Kai Marquez sat on the edge of a drafting table, arms folded, eyes narrowed — not skeptical, exactly. Curious.

“Comedy hates distance,” he said quietly. “It needs timing. And timing hates scale.”

Mag smiled without agreeing.

“Which is why you’re scouting today. Live conditions.”

That was when the music punched through the wall in earnest — brass, percussion, the unmistakable escalation of something designed to be impossible to ignore.

Jayna grimaced. “It’s parade day.”

“Yes,” Mag said. “Peak density. Maximal variables.”

He tapped his tablet once, sealing the decision.

“Go feel it.”

---

They didn’t make it to the gate together.

Astranautica, on parade days, behaved less like a park and more like a weather system. Currents formed. Pressure zones shifted. The algorithms adjusted signage and lighting, but the human tide moved faster than the system could suggest.

The parade came into view in fragments first: a float corner, a dancer’s elbow, a plume of glitter drifting above head height like fallout.

At its center strode the Parade Lead — the guest star — Heath Guilfoyle, a television actor whose face had become shorthand for likability. He waved with the ease of someone who understood that his job today was not performance, but reassurance.

Kai was the first to be taken.

A surge from behind pressed him forward, and suddenly he was no longer watching the parade — he was in it, walking parallel to the dancers, matching their pace unintentionally. A handler glanced at him, misread his posture as confidence, and waved him through.

Kai didn’t resist. He rarely did when the system made a decision.

Lydia lost sight of him seconds later.

She tried to stop, to wait, but the crowd parted her from the group with quiet inevitability. A side street opened, narrower, quieter, dressed as a residential block. Laundry lines strung overhead. Windows flickered with ambient light. Recorded arguments played softly — domestic, overlapping, funny if you listened long enough.

She found herself standing still while the crowd streamed past.

And no one noticed.

Zed was laughing — actually laughing — before he realized he was alone.

He’d been shoved sideways into a service alley lined with food stalls and portable storage. Three separate conversations collided in the narrow space: a vendor arguing with a supplier, a couple negotiating lunch plans, a child loudly explaining why they were being treated unfairly.

The timing was perfect. None of it scripted.

Zed pulled out his recorder.

Jayna climbed.

When movement failed, elevation didn’t. She scaled a maintenance platform with practiced irritation, gaining a vantage point that immediately revealed what ground-level chaos concealed: bottlenecks forming at float intersections, emotional compression zones where excitement flirted with panic.

She opened a channel, barking calm instructions to ops.

The system listened.

Mag Magnusson, meanwhile, had vanished.

---

Kai marched beside the parade for nearly half a mile before the novelty wore off.

The dancers were sweating. The smiles were real but maintained, like posture. Between beats, the Parade Lead glanced over at Kai.

“You’re not supposed to be here,” the actor said, not unkindly.

“Neither are you,” Kai replied.

The actor laughed, then exhaled.

“Comedy’s harder than drama,” he said. “Everyone thinks scale helps. It doesn’t. Timing needs listening distance.”

The words landed heavier than intended.

Kai watched the crowd react in waves — laughter delayed, applause arriving late. The joke flattened by mass.

He nodded once.

“That’s the problem we’re solving today.”

---

In the residential zone, Lydia walked slowly.

Guests lingered here. They knocked on doors. Commented on the laundry. Leaned in to hear the recorded arguments as if proximity would unlock additional meaning.

She watched a woman laugh, not because something was funny, but because it felt familiar.

No vehicles. No spectacle.

Just rhythm.

Her system hadn’t created this experience.

It had simply allowed it.

That unsettled her more than any failure would have.

---

Zed’s recorder was nearly full by the time he escaped the alley.

“This is it,” he muttered, breathless. “This is the ride. This is the movie. People standing too close to strangers and realizing it’s funny.”

Jayna descended, the parade already softening under her interventions. The danger had passed. The energy remained.

They reconvened backstage — disheveled, overstimulated, grinning despite themselves.

Mag reappeared last.

“So,” he said. “What did we learn?”

They didn’t pitch him a ride.

They pitched him a principle.

Lydia spoke clinically. Kai followed poetically. Zed punctuated with overheard truths.

A comedy ride that didn’t move fast.
A ride that listened.
A ride that trusted proximity.

Mag considered them for a long moment.

“Let’s see if intimacy scales,” he said.

---

Tavi Marquez appeared later, in prerecorded form, standing before his diorama.

Tiny figures stood close together.

“Spectacle is easy,” he said.
“Proximity is dangerous.”

A pause.

“That’s why it matters.”

The parade music echoed faintly in the distance.

Astranautica settled.

And somewhere inside it, a smaller idea found room to breathe.

1qaigb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Concerta/comments/1qaigb9/tried_18mg_and_need_to_talk/,Tried 18mg and need to talk,"Ok so last Thursday, I tried 18mg for the first time at around 6:40AM.

Around 7:15AM, Holy cow. I felt quiet, calm. I was exhaling slowly. I showered, washed my face, makeup on, and put the items back in their place. Threw clothes on. You may not know me but believe me this was extraordinary to do! Also felt really slow but when I was checking the time I was like: huh? Only 7:35?? Wow!

Anyway, usually I get annoyed at my partner for whatever reason, but that morning, I felt empathy and wanted to work as a partnership with him (usually I resent him super easily for making himself a coffee to go while dressing up the kids, etc.). I just felt like things were aligning. 

Went to work, I was focused, etc. Anyway clearly the Concerta 18mg made it’s thing for me. However!!

Around 10:15 I had diarrhea. Once. I felt my stomach irritated. No appetite throughout the day. I was supposed to run 7km with intervals but that went down the drain since I started to feel sweaty and unwell (and yes bad idea after a diarrhea episode).

I also felt great in the evening, calm, happy, etc. But when I went to bed, I couldn’t control my thoughts. Usually I like thinking about stuff that increase my dopamine like saving someone, falling in love etc. But I couldn’t control my thoughts. Probably since I didn’t chase dopamine anymore, so those thoughts were now unappealing to my brain. My thoughts were spiraling and I had 2-3 tics (arm twitching or leg). I ended up having a really bad agitated night with insomnia.

I got scared and didn’t try again since then. I called my pharmacist and they will ask for my doctor to send a prescription for 10mg Biphentin.

As anyone else had the same experience? If so, am I right to be scared to try it again? Or 18mg is really too much?

Fairly good Japanese ♡ LINE/Mixi2 ready.

5'11"" (180 cm) bear build — trimmed beard, thick arms, broad chest. Boyish smile under the beard.

About me:

* Cook cast-iron steaks here, okonomiyaki and oden when I’m in Japan
* Retro games (SNES co-op nights), spooky movies, history books at 2 a.m., perfect pour-over coffee
* Travel rhythm: long summers traveling, Midwest winters, always planning the next flight

What I want most:  
I’ve loved deeply before, though I’ve never been married. I know how rare and precious that quiet, intense love is — the kind where every day we choose each other, support each other, and slowly build the exact life we both dream of.

That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other.

I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You:

* Japanese (living anywhere in the world)
* 20–46
* Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever
* Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)
* Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

A little more about the woman I hope writes me: You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip. You don’t need to be perfect; you just need to be ready to choose “us” every single day, the same way I will.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qaiemw,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1qaiemw/for_the_first_time_ran_away_from_3_red_flags/,For the first time ran away from 3 red flags before it became a relationship,"So, I’ve been processing this, and I want to share a story about a guy I met recently—let’s call him Cole—and how intense and confusing the interactions became.

I’ve been going out with a close friend of mine, let’s call him Leo, who works at a bar. I’d go there a few times when he was working and sometimes on his off days, just to hang out, drink, and have fun. That’s where I met Cole, who also worked there.

At first, Cole just said hi, but there was something about the way he did it that caught my attention. I wasn’t sure if he liked me or if I liked him—I was genuinely curious about him, but I didn’t want to assume anything or get caught up in my ego. Over a few interactions, we started talking when I came with friends and sometimes when I went alone. I enjoyed his company, but I wasn’t thinking about anything serious; I just wanted to get to know him.

A week or so after we met, I started working at the bar. On my first day, Cole told me, “Don’t worry, I’ve got your back. I’ll show you how everything works.” That was comforting—I felt like I had someone supportive beside me. After work, he asked if I wanted to go out for drinks, and I said yes. We had fun, talked a lot, and it felt natural. I told him I found him hoş (Turkish for attractive), and he said the same about me. The night felt easy and enjoyable, even though it stretched late into the morning because of work.

But then something started feeling a bit off. Leo, my close friend, usually calls me to make sure I wake up for work. Cole, knowing this, started calling me too. I appreciated the thought, but it felt awkward—like, we’d only known each other a few days. I told him I appreciated it but didn’t need the call.

The next day we went out again. Early on, I admitted to him that I’m scared of relationships. I also realized I was scared of him—he’s intense in a way that triggers me. He said he’s scared too, which initially made me feel like, okay, maybe we’re in the same place. But I also felt a gut-level caution about him, probably because of past traumas.

On our second outing, I tried to explain my feelings with a chair analogy: how you carry a chair affects whether it’s easy or hard, whether it bumps into things or hurts you. I used it as a metaphor for relationships—I wanted to “burn the chair,” meaning I wasn’t ready to carry a relationship right now. Cole, however, interpreted it differently. He said he wanted to burn the chair too, but meant it sexually—he said he wanted to kiss me and be with me. It was sudden, intense, and honestly, a bit overwhelming. I realized analogies can be tricky because people interpret them differently.

Later, I told him my limits: I was going to move away three times this year, and I wasn’t ready for a relationship. He said he’d move with me and follow me wherever I went. That scared me. We’d only known each other a few days! But I didn’t say it out loud at the time, because maybe someone else would like his intensity, or maybe it’s just me.

Early on, he also said things like “I see you, I see everything,” which I initially thought was flattering. But when he started sharing about his father and childhood, I realized he was observing everything about me, and it started to feel intense. Later, he mirrored me, saying he saw himself in me. That scared me even more. Combined with his promise to move after me, his intensity was too fast, too much for me.

I tried to explain to him later, over coffee, that I was overwhelmed by what felt like idealization and mirroring. I didn’t accuse him; I just explained how psychology describes these behaviors and that it scared me. I also explained that even though he meant being attentive and saying he’d wait for me as flirting, it triggered me because of how quickly everything escalated.

During one of these conversations, he insisted on walking me home. Normally, I’d appreciate that—it’s a safety thing in my city—but I felt unstable, so I lied about my address and called him a cab. A few days later, at the talk over coffee I told him why I did that and explained my discomfort with how fast things were moving.

Over coffee, I also told him something important: I want a healthy relationship, and for that, I’m not emotionally mature right now. I explained that meeting him was meaningful because it showed both of us how immature we are emotionally, and that we shouldn’t see each other romantically. The space after this encounter is for us to grow individually, so that we can have healthy relationships in the future—just not with each other.

Ultimately, after trying to communicate my limits and fears, I realized it wasn’t healthy for us to continue seeing each other romantically. I told him I wasn’t ready for a relationship and that I needed to stop seeing him in that context, even if he didn’t fully understand why.",1,1768183872.0,whatdoIdo,3,1.0,False
1qaie54,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimLounge/comments/1qaie54/disabilities_and_chronic_health_conditions/,Disabilities and chronic health conditions.,"Salamualaykum everyone. There’s a lot of information here it’s a long read but I would really appreciate any advice you can offer.

I’m 24 years old and in the last five years my health has drastically spiraled out of control. For context I’m come from a Muslim household. My grandparents have taught religion mashallah and are well recognized in our local community. So I was raised in the faith. 

Unfortunately despite being well versed in the religion and prominent figures in our community, we grew up in high stress environments. Having a childhood this rough is what makes people prone to certain conditions. On top of that my father has been emotionally (and on occasions) physically abusive which of course added to this stress. And I don’t mean my father didn’t buy me a doll or something. 

I’m talking about being 9 years old and making sure my little brother and I had food to eat. Making sure he did his homework. Making sure we had clean uniforms and underwear. Making sure he got to bed at time and we got up for school I time so I could make our school lunches. I’m talking about being called a disappointment for taking a break from studying to watch some cartoons. Being told that my existence (and my other siblings) ruined my father’s life. That he regrets having us. That I should get an eating disorder so I can be skinny. (I’m not even fat mind you I’m just not Hollywood thin) 

This is how we live when my father gets even slightly agitated. I can safely say for myself and my brother we live on eggshells. And this alone causes a decline in mental state. But the other thing it does is cause a decline in health. Especially when you’re exposed to stress this young. I’ve had certain symptoms for all my life. My mother’s biggest complain to my doctors from age six was that I was always lethargic, that I was always tired and didn’t play like the other kids. That I had eyebags down to my chin etc etc. all my body pains got chalked up to growing pains and my constant exhaustion was called laziness. 

The first alarming incident happened when I was in the 8th grade. I had a cardiac episode where my blood pressure was pushing 210/120. And I remember this because my nurse went into crises mode and had to call an administrator to help her manage other kids with the second nurse while her attention was on me. She gave me some tea and walked me through a breathing exercise to calm down before she went to call my mom. And on this time my blood pressure started to drop I started shivering and my fingers started turning blue. 

And that was the start of the spiral. It was slow progression. I developed insomnia. I had no appetite. My periods skipped and were excruciatingly painful and it got worse and worse over time. Through highschool my insomnia was so bad that I would stay up all night, drink coffee on my way into school and then sleep through my first two lessons. I was not a backbencher. I was in the front row and the top of my class DESPITE all this. College meant this escalated it. The growing pains never stopped. My back hurt my legs hurt all my joints hurt all the time. At this time I was going to the gym and I was learning to swim. I was still pushing to be active because I was “too fat.” 

I transferred from community college to university and I think I hit my breaking point when I sustained a workplace injury and my body started to collapse. I couldn’t keep up with my classes my mental health tanked I have had wellness checks called on me. And yet I graduated despite all this. I was 21. And I was losing my balance I was blacking out I was vomiting an in pain and I couldn’t leave my bed. 

In 2021 I was diagnosed with ADHD and I’m suspected by my doctors for being autistic. Why is this relevant? Because these neurological conditions make people prone to other conditions referred to in the medical field as “comorbid conditions.” In 2021 I have been diagnosed with POTS, a neurological disorder that affects your autonomic nervous system. It gives me breathing issues, it makes me dizzy I pass out and recently I’ve started having (what appear to be) seizures. I also have hypermobility that is suspected to be EDS because my joints partially dislocate from their sockets, my ribs regularly slip out of place, my eyes get stuck as blurry and I have to wait for my eyes to fix themselves because my cornea is all connective tissue. My doctors have told me I’m not able to work, they suspect I have other underlying conditions including autoimmune diseases and I’ve been told that even a cold could send me to an er and o believe it because it happens. I’ve also had my gallbladder out and it’s created new issues where I can only eat some jello and a piece of chicken and I can’t eat after like 6pm. I wake up in the middle of the night having vomiting fits where I throw up stomach bile and I’m up all night dealing with that. 

My body is a wreck. I can’t move I can’t keep track of time. I’m bound to my bed because the only thing that brings me ease is laying down. I tell myself inshallah there will be an answer. Inshallah it will come to an end. 

But I worry that being so disabled where even doing things I love are a chore. Forget that necessities are a chore. Trying to shower takes a week to plan. I need to talk myself into going to the restroom. I haven’t prayed salah and it’s destroying me. But I don’t even know where my days are. I have no idea when I’ve taken my medicines. I don’t have any caretakers either. My father believes I have allowed the medical system to control my brain to take medications that are providing life saving care. He thinks I’m just lazy and am using this as an excuse not to find a job. But what 24 year old wants this? To be trapped in their body and bound to their bed in a daze. 

My friends don’t hear from me I don’t make plans I have no life and I’m suffering. I’m trying my best but I can’t pray this away and even if I could i cannot pray. I used to be able to about a year and a half ago. I was still able to pray from a chair because I was well enough to know “hey it’s time to pray.” Now I don’t know what day it is I don’t move from my bed. The only thing I feel I’m doing right is wearing my hijab when I manage to make it to a doctors appointment. I’m not even able to fast this Ramadan. Last Ramadan was, from a medical standpoint, atrocious, I was crying every night, my heart wasn’t in it and at the time I had job too so all of my illnesses were flaring and I was having medical issues almost daily. I’m scared and lonely and I feel as though Allah SWT had turned his back on my which deep down I know would never be the case but just like my physical health and mental health is at an all time low, my Iman is getting to an equally low, if not lower, level. I don’t know what to do. I’m not employed anymore I have no money and I’m just trying to make it to the next day but it doesn’t seem enough.",2,1768183835.0,MuslimLounge,2,1.0,False

Here are the restaurants which take mainland food and elevate it; or are at least using *some* local ingredients (grouped by area). Not an exhaustive list because I haven't eaten everywhere, yet:

**South Kona**

SATURDAY ONLY: Saturday farmers' market at Long's Keauhou. Run by an agricultural co-op. This is one of a few farmers' markets which feature actual farmers. And not Costco food at Hawaii prices. (The Hilo market gets caught doing this CONSTANTLY.) Website for ALL the farmers' markets: [https://www.lovebigisland.com/farmers-markets/](https://www.lovebigisland.com/farmers-markets/)

Teshima's - Kealakekua - bento and breakfast, Japanese comfort food. [http://www.teshimarestaurant.com/Teshimas\_Restaurant/Home.html](http://www.teshimarestaurant.com/Teshimas_Restaurant/Home.html)

Farm House - Kainaliu - (formerly Kainaliu Fresh Market) Small-family-farm, local produce. I'o Ranch beef. Ancient Valley chicken. Locally caught ahi. (Loin, belly, and sesame-crusted for an easy appetizer.) Lots of fresh produce from family farms all over the Big Island. Every town in the US should have a grocery like this. Go here specifically for coffee-wood smoked hummus, babaganoush (when eggplants are in season), chocolate mac-nut spread, kampachi fish from the fish farm near the airport, local honey, and similar. [https://kainaliufresh.com/](https://kainaliufresh.com/)

Randy's Huli Chicken - Outstanding barbecue. Kaiwe smoked meat. (Same with GJ's in Waimea.) [https://www.facebook.com/randyshuli/](https://www.facebook.com/randyshuli/)

Shaka Tacos - Captain Cook - outstanding venison burritos from an island I cannot name. Eat as much venison as you want. It's helping control the invasive axis deer. You're doing two islands a favor every time you ask for Hawaii venison. Maui is one. Can't say the other. [https://shakatacoz.com/](https://shakatacoz.com/)

SUNDAY ONLY: Sunday farmer's market in Captain Cook, across the street from Kona Chips. Same as the Saturday market (different vendors, but just as local. There is usually a fish vendor here.)

Manago Hotel - Captain Cook - only open a few days a week, famous for pork chops

Kona Chips - Captain Cook - best potato chips on Earth. [https://www.konachips.net/](https://www.konachips.net/)

ChoiceMart -- next to Ace Hardware in Captain Cook. Local fish. They ALWAYS have local fish. You're not going to want to break down whole ahi. But it is RELIABLY $5/pound for whole fish. [https://www.choicemarthawaii.com/](https://www.choicemarthawaii.com/)

Super J's Cafe - Captain Cook - Hawaiian food, costs next to nothing. Lomi-lomi salmon  and pork lau-lau. If you're lucky, they have guava cake for dessert. [https://www.facebook.com/SuperJsLaulau/](https://www.facebook.com/SuperJsLaulau/)

**North Kona** \-- Notice there aren't many here. And nothing in Kohala.

The food truck at ***Big Island Abalone Farm***, just south of KOA airport. This should be #1 on any foodie's list. Because these Japanese salt-water snails are nearly extinct in the wild. The only way to get these is go visit Big Island. Locals don't know about this farm. Most tourists don't, either. But Japanese visitors know. You will see them every single day, eating abalone sashimi and garlic abalone stew like they just hit the lottery.

Matsuyama - Kailua Kona - Japenese bento box lunches. [https://www.yelp.com/biz/matsuyama-market-kailua-kona-2](https://www.yelp.com/biz/matsuyama-market-kailua-kona-2)

**Waimea** \-- Almost always the best bang for the buck

Big Island Brewhaus - Waimea -- Best craft brewery on the island and Big Island beef burgers. [https://bigislandbrewhaus.com/](https://bigislandbrewhaus.com/)

Dizzy Pita and Ippy's Barbecue - Waimea - Same owner, same building. Dizzy sells good gyros. And Ippy's sells Hawaiian Barbecue. [https://www.ippyshawaiianbarbeque.com/](https://www.ippyshawaiianbarbeque.com/)

Fine-dining: FORC and Merriman's - Waimea - The lunch special at Merriman's is the best fine-dining value on the island. Both of these restaurants are better than most about using local ingredients. [https://forchawaii.com/](https://forchawaii.com/) [https://www.merrimanshawaii.com/location/big-island/](https://www.merrimanshawaii.com/location/big-island/)

GJ's Huli Chicken. Basically the same as Randy's. Open more days of the week. [https://www.facebook.com/GJsHuliChickenAndFilipinoRestaurant/](https://www.facebook.com/GJsHuliChickenAndFilipinoRestaurant/)

Our Founding Farmers - Way up in Hawi - Outstanding hand-made ice cream.

**Hilo** \- The most Japanese and vegetarian options are here

Ratana's Green Papaya Salad. They make precisely one thing. And it's great.

Tetsumen Ramen - Hilo - best $20 bowl of soup you can get in the US. Vegetarian options which are OUTSTANDING. Not just ""here's something for the vegetarians."" [https://tetsumenhawaii.com/](https://tetsumenhawaii.com/)

Takenoko Sushi -- Hilo -- Take-out only. You'll never get a reservation. (They're booked a year in advance). Best sushi outside of Japan. Same area as Takenoko [https://www.yelp.com/biz/takenoko-sushi-hilo](https://www.yelp.com/biz/takenoko-sushi-hilo)

Suisan Fish Market - Hilo - My favorite Poke on the entire island. [https://www.suisan.com/our-services/fish-market-fish/](https://www.suisan.com/our-services/fish-market-fish/)

2 Ladies Bakery - Hilo - They make Japanese sweets mostly. Usually a line out the door. [https://www.facebook.com/twoladieskitchenorginal/](https://www.facebook.com/twoladieskitchenorginal/)

**Multiple locations:**

Minit Stop - many locations - fried chicken, on my top-ten list of ""best fried chicken I've ever eaten."" Worth stopping on the way down from the airport if you need a quick, inexpensive meal after the flight. [https://www.minitstop.com/](https://www.minitstop.com/)

7-Eleven - You should definitely stop and try a $6 tray of pork hash. People think I'm joking when I send them to 7-Eleven. It's really, really good. If we had a 7-Eleven on the west side, I'd gain 20 pounds.

Local grocery store poke. My go-to when I'm on a road trip and hungry. I like Choicemart and Foodland best. But KTA makes fine poke. And check out their bento, musubi, and deli section as well. This is what a lot of locals eat on their lunch break. It's better quality than the tourist traps and costs less than even the cheapest plate-lunch joints.

NOTE -- A great many restaurants have been closed down by the Dept. of Health in 2025. This is a good thing because these places needed to clean up their act (literally). Roaches galore. One place didn't have a hand-washing sink for 20 years. Another had raw sewage in the kitchen. The tourist traps will make you sick.

1qaibem,https://www.reddit.com/r/italia4x4/comments/1qaibem/are_you_searching_purpose_of_human_life/,are you searching purpose of human life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1768183628.0,italia4x4,0,1.0,False
1qaib5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Invisalign/comments/1qaib5e/non_waterdrinkers/,Non water-drinkers,"I know it’s so bad, but I’m not a water drinker. I don’t feel quenched drinking water, I don’t feel thirsty and think wow I could down a glass of water right now. I will drink it, if it’s the only thing available, or if I had just come out of a desert and needed a drink sure. 

But if there’s coffee? Juice? Fizzy drinks? Sorry I will not be taking a water…

So, is there anyone out there like me who finds Invisalign slightly difficult because they are not casual water drinkers? It’s too much effort to take them out and clean my teeth every time I want a juice…. But then even flavoured water has some type of sugar in it, and diluted juice is coloured so would stain the trays AND has sugars in it. 

I’m not saying that it’s the end of the world - god knows my body needs more water (trying to get blood from me is like trying to get blood from a stone!), but damn do I miss a random glass of orange juice! Especially in summer time!! 

How’s everyone else coping? I know most people ask about coffee and stuff, I did at one point drink coffee through a metal straw for a while but that was when I was on weekly changes, now I’m on two week changes I don’t risk it. Has anyone grown to love water? I just can’t seem to make it a habit to reach for water over juice. ",0,1768183608.0,Invisalign,17,0.5,False
1qaiaty,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1qaiaty/day_6/,Day 6,"This is my second time quitting Zyn. I’ve been a can-a-day 6mg user since 2018, and dip for a few years before that. I last quit a few years ago and fell for the idea that I could just buy one can while on a vacation after \~3 months clean.

Similar to last time, days 1-2 were very rough. Anxious, irritable, headaches… at least I was busy at work to keep my mind off it as much as possible.

Day 3 - much less anxiety, cravings aren’t as constant. Still not sleeping worth a shit. Not feeling depressed, but not happy either. Haven’t had many endorphins.

Day 4 - kinda the same as day 3. Slept a bit better.

Day 5-6 - slept much better. Felt mentally stable most of the day. Approaching normal.

What has helped:

I’ve been using 3mg pouches for a few months in preparation of quitting. Honestly, my tolerance was high enough that I never felt the difference between a 6mg or 3mg anyways, except I would feel much worse at the end of the day after using a can of 6s. So even if you don’t quit right away, give it a try. 

Lots of gum and grinds coffee pouches. Stopping the grinds pouches today cause they hurt my gums and I start to depend on them for the mouthfeel. Been hitting the gym hard and eating lots of sweets. So far so good.

Why quit?

I’m 35 and am starting to get nervous about the long term consequences of having an elevated heart rate and blood pressure. I’m in good shape but having a pouch in every waking hour always had my readings high.

Cost - these fucking things are almost $6.50 by me now.

ED - I don’t get full ED, but sometimes it’s like my erections are only at 80%. This has always gone away quite fast when I’ve stopped ZYN for any amount of time.

Not fun anymore - I only use them to feel normal. The nice feelings that got me started went away as soon as I used ZYN regularly.

Good luck to everyone on your journey!",8,1768183584.0,QuittingZyn,2,1.0,False

linda (not her real name but close enough) brought leftover salmon from red lobster. the kind with the garlic butter sauce. she put it in a tupperware that was way too big for the amount of fish in it so it was just like. wet fish rattling around in there. she microwaved it for 4 minutes. i know because i watched her from my desk. we have a clear sightline to the break room which corporate calls ""open concept"" and i call ""hell""

our break room has no windows. the ceiling vent has been broken since 2019 and maintenance said they'd fix it but they never did because todd in maintenance doesn't actually do anything except disappear for 2 hours at a time. so the smell just. sat there. it got into the walls i think

marcus from accounting had a birthday cake in the fridge. one of those costco ones with the white frosting. we had to throw it out. he didn't even get mad he just looked defeated. i think about marcus's face a lot actually

HR sent an email about ""being considerate of aromatic food choices."" linda replied all and said ""sorry if the smell bothered anyone! :)"" with the smiley face. a smiley face. i stared at that email for like 10 minutes

that night i googled ""annoying mailing lists"" and scientology came up. i went to their site and filled out the ""free personality test"" form with her work email. put her desk phone number. for the name i put ""linda \[her last name\]"" because i wasn't thinking creatively yet

forgot about it. then like 9 days later she's in the break room complaining to anyone who'll listen about how she keeps getting emails from scientologists. ""it's so weird i don't know how they got my info"" and i was eating a chobani and i just nodded like yeah that's crazy. then i went home and did it again

it's been almost 4 years. every sunday night. i do it in bed on my phone while my wife watches real housewives in the living room. i've found like 60+ different forms at this point. the main [scientology.org](http://scientology.org) one. the dianetics site. local church pages. they have one for ""youth programs"" which felt wrong but i did it anyway. i keep all the links in a notes folder called ""recipes""

the best one was when someone from the church actually showed up at our office asking for her. said she'd signed up for a stress test. i was in the kitchen making coffee and i heard her say ""i don't know what you're talking about i never signed up for anything"" and the guy was so confused. i had to go to the bathroom and sit in the stall for 5 minutes because i couldn't breathe

she's complained to IT twice. they reset her email filters and told her someone might be ""targeting her"" which made her paranoid for like a month. i felt a little bad. then i remembered the fish and signed her up for sea org recruitment emails

linda still works here. she hasn't microwaved fish since. we say hi in the hallway. she has no idea. sometimes i wonder if i'll ever stop but then sunday comes around and i just do it. it's like brushing my teeth at this point

1qai6vu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1qai6vu/the_difficulty_with_the_word_no/,"The Difficulty With the Word ""No""","I recently came home from a trip to another state to visit family, and ended up spending around $450 more than I budgeted myself. Part of it was out of my control; moving up and extending my trip because of a hospitalized family member that ended up passing away in late December. But $350 of it was spent on Christmas gifts, outings, and unexpected purchases. Immediate family was dealing with vet, car, and funeral payments and they had spent approximately $9,000 in one month, and one of my best friends is also struggling financially. 

I'm good with money otherwise, I'd say my only impulse buys come from holidays, celebrations, along with coffee and snacks a few times a week. When it comes to loved ones though, it's really hard to say no to financial loans or gifts, especially while they are struggling. Made some progress today though, my friend asked for money I was thinking of giving her for stimulus between paychecks later this week, and I told her what it was; that I needed to pay back my credit card and that was more important right now. She told me that was okay, and that I needed to keep myself afloat, too. 

She wasn't disappointed or mad at me, and that there is a real friend. Shows me that it's okay to set limits when I need to without loosing respect. What strategies might yall use to set boundaries? I'm interested in not over-exerting myself nor my wallet anymore. ",2,1768183290.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

Working around keeping the glass coffee table, circular side table, and two console type tables, which are all passed down from relatives. 

Problems seem to be:

1. The seating is too far apart, or if brought closer ends up right in front of a console able. If the couch is brought off the wall, can't get quite enough space for both bookshelves and walkway.

2. Want to incorporate a fair amount of book shelves along one or two walls. (the one in the pictures to be relocated to another room and replaced).

3. Foyer swinging doors into the living room take up space, but we like them.

4. Maintaining walking path into the dining room.

5. The larger of the console tables houses a vintage stereo and best case scenario would leave the option of placing speakers somewhere (might be a long shot).

The urgent care doctor called it a “moderate sprain” like that phrase makes it feel smaller. My left forearm has bruises shaped like fingers, too long to look right. The nurse didn’t say that part out loud, but her eyes did.

I went camping to get away from people. I ended up begging one for directions over a radio, and by the end of the night I wasn’t sure the voice on the other end was a person at all.

I want to be clear about something up front: I wasn’t out there trying to test myself. I’m not a survival guy. I wasn’t hunting for creepy stories. I had a reservation and a map and enough food for one night. I picked a back loop because the main campground was full of headlights, barking dogs, and Bluetooth speakers.

The park brochure called my site “primitive.” That should have been a hint. It meant a fire ring, a flat patch of dirt, and a picnic table with initials carved into it so deep the wood looked chewed.

The evening was normal. That’s the part I keep coming back to, like if I replay it enough times I’ll find the exact moment I made the wrong choice.

I ate a lukewarm meal out of a foil tray. I rinsed my hands with a water bottle. I watched the sun drain out of the trees. A couple times I heard something moving in the brush and I did the usual mental math: squirrel, raccoon, deer. I told myself I’d be up early and out before the day hikers showed.

Around nine, when the air got cold and damp, I realized my headlamp wasn’t in my pack.

I’d left it in the car.

The car was parked at a small pull-off a couple miles back. I remembered the pull-off because there was a brown trail sign with the number on it and one of those map cases bolted to a post. The plastic cover on the map case was cracked and someone had stuffed wet paper inside like they’d tried to light it on fire and failed.

I told myself it was a quick walk. I had my phone light. The trail was straightforward. One main path, then a spur.

Fifteen minutes, in and out.

I took my keys, my phone, and without thinking much about it, the little handheld radio I’d brought “just in case.” It was a cheap black unit with a stubby antenna and a screen that glowed green. I’d bought it years ago and barely used it, but I’d programmed in the park’s “ranger frequency” from something I’d read when planning the trip. It made me feel responsible, like I had a backup plan.

The first part of the walk was fine. My phone light made the trail look like a tunnel, and everything beyond it was just shadow and bark. The air smelled like pine needles and cold soil. My footsteps sounded louder than they should have.

Ten minutes in, I passed a reflective trail marker nailed to a tree. It flashed back at me like an animal eye. I remember thinking, good, I’m still on something official.

Another ten minutes and I still hadn’t hit the pull-off.

No gate. No gravel. No sign.

I slowed down, then stopped.

It wasn’t the dramatic “the forest went silent” thing people say. There were still insects. Wind in the needles. Something small moving deeper in the brush. But the human layer was gone. No distant voices from the campground. No car doors. No far-off engine.

I swung my light down and saw something that made my stomach drop.

My own boot prints, faint in the dust, curving off the trail and back toward where I’d come from. Not a clean loop like a track. A sloppy arc.

I had been walking in a circle without realizing it.

My first instinct was to laugh at myself, because that’s what you do when you’re embarrassed and alone. I took out the paper map and held it up in the beam of my phone. The lines and symbols might as well have been a subway map for a city I’d never visited. Everything around me looked the same. Trees, roots, brush, darkness.

I checked the time. 10:18 p.m.

That was when I remembered the radio.

I turned it on. The screen lit up. Static hissed softly.

I pressed the transmit button.

“Ranger station, this is a camper on the back loop. I’m lost. I’m on Trail Six somewhere, I think. I’m trying to get back to the entrance. Do you copy?”

Static, then a click like someone keying a mic.

A voice came through, flattened by the speaker, calm enough to make my shoulders sag with relief.

“Copy. Stand by.”

I let out a breath I didn’t realize I’d been holding.

“Thank you,” I said. “I parked at a pull-off by a gated service road. Brown sign, map case. I walked out to grab my headlamp and I looped. I can’t find the spur back.”

Another pause. Behind the voice, I could hear a faint background sound like wind hitting a building, or maybe just the radio adding its own texture.

“Describe what you see,” the voice said.

It sounded like a man, middle-aged, the kind of voice you’d expect from someone who’s given directions for a living. Not hurried. Not annoyed. Like he’d rather talk you down than lecture you later.

“Evergreens,” I said. “Packed dirt trail. I’m at a fork. Left looks wider, right looks narrow and drops down.”

“Take the right,” he said.

I stared at the fork. The left side looked like the main trail. The right looked like an animal path that someone had convinced themselves was a trail.

“The right is smaller,” I said. “Are you sure?”

“Yes,” he said, immediate. “Right will put you on the access road.”

That didn’t match what my common sense was screaming, but I had a voice on the radio. A ranger. Someone official. I wanted badly for that to be true.

I turned right.

As I walked, I narrated what I could. A fallen limb. A patch of damp ground. The slope. I kept waiting for the trail to open up onto something recognizable.

The radio clicked again.

“Keep your light low,” the voice said.

“What?”

“Keep it low,” he repeated. “Do not swing it around.”

That made no sense. Every safety pamphlet I’d ever seen said the opposite: make yourself visible. Stay put. Conserve battery. Signal.

I should have stopped right there. I should have turned the radio off and started climbing toward higher ground, or stayed put and waited for morning.

Instead, I did what he said. I pointed the beam at my feet and tried not to move it.

A minute later, he asked, “Do you hear water?”

I stopped and listened.

Nothing I could pick out. Just the normal whispering of trees.

“No.”

“Do you hear anything else?” he asked.

The question was too open. Too curious. It didn’t sound like someone trying to locate me. It sounded like someone checking whether I was alone.

“Just… woods,” I said. “Why?”

Static. Then, softly, “Keep moving.”

My phone battery ticked down. Twenty percent. Eighteen. The cold was chewing through it faster than I expected.

I tried to keep my breathing steady. I kept walking.

That’s when I saw the reflective marker again.

Except it wasn’t on a tree.

It was on the ground.

A small rectangle of reflective tape in the dirt, like it had been torn off and dropped. The soil around it looked scraped, disturbed. Not clear footprints, more like something heavy had been dragged across the trail and then lifted.

I crouched without thinking and touched it with two fingers.

The tape was damp and cold.

The radio clicked.

“Don’t touch that,” the voice said.

I froze mid-crouch.

“How did you…” I started, then swallowed it. He couldn’t see me. He couldn’t.

I stood up slowly, heart thudding.

“Ranger,” I said, “what’s your name?”

A pause long enough for the static to fill my head.

“You don’t need that,” the voice said.

My skin prickled under my shirt.

Behind me, somewhere off the trail, something moved.

Not a squirrel. Not a deer. It was too measured. Too heavy.

Footsteps.

One slow step, then another, like something matching my stop and start.

I turned my head without lifting the light. The beam stayed low, because part of me still clung to the idea that following the instructions kept me safe.

“Ranger,” I said quietly, “there’s something behind me.”

The voice on the radio didn’t sound surprised.

“I know,” it said.

My mouth went dry.

I lifted the light anyway and swung it toward the sound.

The beam caught tree trunks, low brush, a tangle of branches. Nothing obvious.

And the moment my light moved, the footsteps stopped.

I stood there in my own shaky cone of light, listening so hard my ears felt strained.

“Who is this?” I said into the radio, and my voice cracked on the last word.

Static surged, then cut suddenly, cleanly, like someone had switched channels.

Then I heard my own voice come back at me through the speaker.

“Who is this?”

Same cadence. Same crack. Same tiny breath at the end.

It wasn’t a recording quality. It wasn’t muffled like a replay. It was like someone had taken my words and thrown them right back.

I jerked the radio away from my face like it had burned me.

The voice returned, calm again, but different now. Less like a person. More like someone wearing a person’s tone.

“Don’t raise your voice,” it said. “Keep moving.”

My chest tightened. I forced myself to turn and start walking, because standing still felt worse. The trail ahead looked narrower than before. Less maintained. The smell changed, too. A sourness under the pine, like wet fur and old meat.

My phone light flickered.

“Ranger,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady, “I’m going back to the fork. The left trail is wider.”

The radio clicked so fast it felt like an interruption.

“No,” the voice said, sharp. “Do not go back.”

At the same moment, the sound behind me changed.

It wasn’t footsteps anymore. It was a dry, rapid clicking, like someone trying to speak through a throat that didn’t work right.

I stopped walking. My hands shook. I could feel my pulse in my fingers.

I swung the light again.

This time the beam caught it.

Between two trees, half-hidden, a shape that was too tall to be a deer and too thin to be a bear. It was standing upright, but not like a person stands. Its posture was wrong, weight distributed like it wasn’t used to its own joints.

Its torso was narrow and too long. Its arms hung low, almost to its knees. The head was the worst part, because my brain kept trying to label it and failing. It wasn’t antlers like the stories. It wasn’t a clean skull. It looked like skin pulled tight over something sharp. The top had uneven ridges like bone pushing out from inside.

Two dull reflective points caught my light, not bright like animal eyes, but wet and heavy.

It tilted its head.

Then it took one step toward me.

Not loud. Not charging. Just a single, confident step that erased distance too quickly.

I ran.

I ran because I didn’t have a better idea.

The trail pitched down and twisted. My phone light bounced wildly. My breathing turned into ragged pulls. Behind me, I heard movement through brush that didn’t sound panicked. It sounded like it knew exactly where it was going.

The radio in my fist hissed.

“Don’t run,” the voice said.

It didn’t sound worried. It sounded irritated, like I’d stopped playing the game correctly.

My phone light died in the middle of a step.

One second I had a cone of visibility, the next I was in full dark.

I nearly faceplanted. My arms flailed. My foot caught a root. I stumbled, recovered, and kept moving with only the green glow of the radio screen.

The creature’s clicking breath stayed with me. Sometimes louder, sometimes fainter, like it was pacing me from the side.

I tried to slow down to save my ankle, but the moment I did, the clicking got closer.

I ran again.

The trail dipped hard. My foot hit something slick. I went down on my hands and knees. Pain shot up my right wrist like a spark. My knee slammed a root. I bit my tongue and tasted blood.

I pushed up fast, panicked, and my right ankle rolled on loose needles.

A clean, sharp pain climbed my leg and almost took me down again. I had to catch myself against a tree trunk.

I couldn’t put my full weight on that foot anymore.

Behind me, the clicking stopped.

For one breathless second, I thought maybe it had paused. Maybe it had decided I wasn’t worth it.

Then I felt it behind me. Not in a mystical way. In the way you feel a person standing too close in an elevator. Air pressure. Heat. Presence.

I turned, lifting the radio screen like a useless flashlight.

The green glow caught a piece of its face and shoulder.

Up close it wasn’t just thin. It looked damaged. Skin torn and healed wrong, like something had ripped it and it had closed back up without care. The mouth was pulled too wide, lips stretched tight, teeth crowded and uneven like they’d grown in wrong.

It reached toward me with those long, jointed fingers.

I swung the radio at it as hard as I could. Plastic cracked against something solid. The radio flew out of my hand and skittered into the dark.

The creature didn’t flinch.

It grabbed my left forearm.

The grip wasn’t wet or slimy like horror movies. It was cold and dry, like grabbing a dead branch. The pressure was immediate, crushing. Pain bloomed so fast it turned my vision white.

I screamed.

I yanked back, twisting. It dragged me a step like I weighed nothing. Its fingers tightened and I felt something in my arm give in a way that made me nauseous.

My free hand fumbled in my jacket pocket and found the one thing I’d thrown in there without thinking: a cheap road flare. I’d packed it because it was small and because I’d told myself, “It can’t hurt.”

My fingers shook so badly I almost dropped it.

I popped the cap, scraped the tip, and for half a second nothing happened and I thought I’d just died doing something stupid.

Then it lit.

A violent red flame, hissing, bright enough to turn the trees into hard-edged black silhouettes.

The creature jerked back like the light hit it physically. Its grip loosened. Not a full release, but enough.

I ripped my arm free and stumbled backward, holding the flare out between us like a spear.

In the red light I saw more of it. Legs too long. Knees bending in a way that looked half backwards. Skin mottled like bruises under thin flesh. Dark stains around its mouth that weren’t fresh but weren’t old enough to be nothing.

It didn’t charge.

It watched the flare with the same tilted-head curiosity, clicking softly.

Then it did something that snapped the situation into a new, colder shape.

It looked past the flare.

Down at the ground.

Toward where the radio had slid.

It took a slow step toward it, careful, like it didn’t want to get close to the flare.

Another step.

It wasn’t focused on me. It wanted the radio.

My throat tightened. I backed away, flare held out, and realized the “ranger” voice hadn’t been trying to save me. It had been trying to keep me moving, keep me talking, keep me transmitting.

Like a lure.

Like a line it could follow.

The creature crouched, long limbs folding wrong, and picked up the radio with those stick-like fingers. It turned it over as if it understood what it was holding.

Then the radio clicked.

And from the speaker, not from my hand now but from the thing’s hand, came the voice again.

Calm. Patient.

“Describe what you see.”

The creature lifted its head, still holding the radio, and the dull reflective points of its eyes turned to me.

I felt my stomach drop through the floor.

I didn’t wait to see what it would do next. I turned and limped away as fast as my ankle would let me, flare burning down in my hand, my left arm throbbing and numb where it had grabbed me.

The clicking breath moved with me, not rushing, not fading. Just staying close enough to remind me it could.

The flare shortened quickly, heat biting my palm. Red sparks spat into the dark.

I forced myself to follow the trail because stepping off into the trees felt like stepping off a dock at night. You don’t know what you’ll hit until you do.

Ahead, through the trees, I saw something angular and straight. Not a branch. Not a trunk.

A signpost.

I limped toward it and almost cried when I saw the reflective letters catch the flare light.

TRAIL 6

SERVICE ROAD 0.4

RANGER STATION 1.2

My brain snagged on that last line.

RANGER STATION.

Deeper.

Not out.

The flare hissed lower. The light dimmed.

From off to my right, through the trees, I heard the radio again.

A little burst of static.

A click.

Then my own voice, thin and distant, as if someone had learned the shape of it and was practicing.

“Ranger station… do you copy?”

I froze.

The sound didn’t come from behind. It came from the side, like it was trying to draw my attention off the trail. Toward the trees. Toward the direction that sign said “RANGER STATION.”

My chest tightened hard enough to hurt.

I turned my face away from the sound and forced my feet to move toward “SERVICE ROAD 0.4.”

Every step on that ankle was a bright spike of pain. My left arm felt heavy and wrong. I could feel bruising spreading under my skin.

The flare died with a wet sputter.

Darkness swallowed everything.

I stood still for a second because my eyes were useless and my panic was loud. Then I heard it again. The clicking breath, closer, patient.

I moved.

I walked by feel, hands out, fingertips catching branches, following the faint line of packed dirt underfoot. I slipped once on loose gravel and almost went down. I caught myself against a tree and felt bark dig into my scraped palm.

The radio crackled in the trees.

Sometimes it was static. Sometimes it was my voice repeating the same few words. Sometimes it was that calm “ranger” voice saying, “You’re almost there.”

After what felt like an hour but was probably ten minutes, the ground changed under my boots.

Gravel.

Then flat, hard-packed gravel.

A road.

I stepped forward and the tree line opened just enough that I could make out a darker shape ahead.

A metal gate.

I stumbled to it and grabbed it with both hands like it was a lifeline. The metal was cold. I pressed my forehead to it and pulled in air that tasted like rust and sap.

Behind me, the radio static swelled.

Close.

I turned slowly.

I couldn’t see it in the dark, but I could hear it. The clicking breath, a soft scrape of something moving through brush just off the road, staying in the cover of trees.

The radio clicked.

“Open the gate,” the voice said.

It didn’t sound like a ranger anymore. It sounded strained, like the words were being forced out through a mouth that didn’t fit them.

“I can’t,” I whispered, because my brain was still treating it like a conversation.

“Open it,” the voice repeated.

And under the words, the clicking breath accelerated, excited.

I backed away from the gate, then stopped, because backing away meant stepping closer to the sound.

I stood in the middle of the service road, gravel under my boots, and tried to think.

Cars used service roads. Rangers used service roads. If I followed it long enough, I’d hit something. A lot. A building. A sign. Anything.

Staying still felt like waiting to be taken.

I chose movement.

I limped down the road, faster than my ankle wanted, gravel crunching underfoot. To my right, in the tree line, something moved with me, quiet and effortless.

Every few seconds, the radio voice tried a new angle.

“Turn back.”

“You’re going the wrong way.”

“Your car is not there.”

Then, softer, using my voice again, like it was trying to sound concerned.

“Hey… hey… where are you?”

I didn’t answer. I bit down on my tongue and kept moving.

The road curved. The trees thinned.

And then, ahead, I saw the faint outline of a vehicle.

My car.

The pull-off.

I almost fell from relief. My hands shook so badly I dropped my keys once, then found them by feel and hit the unlock button.

The beep sounded like the best noise I’ve ever heard.

I got the driver’s door open and folded into the seat, dragging my bad ankle in like it didn’t belong to me. Pain flashed up my leg. I slammed the door and locked it.

For a second, I sat there in the dark, breathing hard, staring straight ahead like that would keep me safe.

Then I looked at my side mirror.

At the edge of the pull-off, where gravel met trees, something stood half-hidden in the brush.

Tall. Too thin. Motionless.

In one hand, a small green glow.

My radio.

It lifted the radio slightly, as if showing it to me.

Then the speaker crackled.

And the voice that came out was mine, careful and patient, exactly the way I’d sounded when I thought help was real.

“Ranger station… do you copy?”

I turned the key.

The engine coughed, then caught. The dashboard lit up.

The headlights snapped on, bright white, flooding the pull-off.

The brush at the edge of the trees was empty.

No movement. No shape. No glowing radio.

Just branches and shadow.

I didn’t wait. I threw the car into reverse, gravel spraying, and drove like I was late for my own funeral.

I didn’t stop until I hit pavement. I didn’t stop until I saw another vehicle’s taillights. I didn’t stop until I found the park office, a dark building with a big sign and an emergency phone mounted on the wall.

I called.

I told the person on the other end that I was injured, lost, and something had chased me. I didn’t say “wendigo.” I didn’t say “monster.” I said “an animal” because I needed them to send someone and I didn’t want to sound insane.

They told me to stay in my car with the doors locked until a ranger arrived.

A ranger truck rolled in twenty minutes later. Light bar flashing, tires crunching. The ranger was young, maybe late twenties, and he had the exhausted posture of someone who’d already worked a full day and then got pulled into someone else’s mistake.

He walked up to my window and I rolled it down an inch. I didn’t mean to, but the second I saw a uniform my throat tightened and my eyes burned.

He took one look at my hands and my ankle and swore under his breath.

“Jesus,” he muttered. “Okay. Okay. You did the right thing coming here.”

He helped me into his truck. The heater blew air that smelled like coffee and old vinyl. My body started shaking now that the danger was gone enough for my nerves to catch up.

On the drive to the clinic in the nearest town, he asked me what happened.

I told him the clean version first. Lost the trail. Radioed for help. Got turned around. Something grabbed me.

I didn’t talk about the voice using my voice until the words fell out by accident.

“It repeated me,” I said, staring at my bruised arm. “Like… like it was throwing my words back.”

The ranger’s hands tightened on the steering wheel.

“What channel were you on?” he asked.

“Seven,” I said. “The ranger frequency.”

His eyes flicked to me, quick.

“That’s not ranger dispatch,” he said.

My mouth went dry. “Then who answered me?”

He didn’t answer right away. He watched the road ahead like he was reading it.

Finally he said, “Nobody should have.”

The clinic wrapped my ankle, checked my wrist, cleaned the scrapes on my palms. The bruises on my forearm had started to bloom dark purple by then, finger-shaped, too long. The nurse asked if I’d gotten caught in wire.

I nodded because it was easier than explaining I’d been grabbed by something that didn’t move like a person.

When I came out, the ranger was still there. He stood by his truck with his hands in his jacket pockets like he didn’t want to leave me alone to walk to my car.

“Did you find my radio?” I asked, and I hated how small my voice sounded.

He shook his head. “No.”

I swallowed. “Is there… is there an old ranger station out there? Like an actual tower?”

He hesitated, then sighed like he’d made a decision.

“There’s a decommissioned lookout,” he said. “Old structure. Not staffed. We don’t use it.”

“So the voice could’ve been someone messing with me,” I said, trying to find a normal explanation to cling to.

He looked tired, and for a second he looked older than he was.

“It’s possible,” he said. “But listen to me. If you ever camp again, you do not call for help on random channels. You call the emergency number. You stay put. You don’t let a voice tell you to walk deeper. You understand?”

I nodded.

He leaned closer, lowering his voice like the night could hear us.

“And if you hear your own voice come back at you,” he added, “you stop transmitting.”

I stared at him.

“You’ve heard that?” I asked.

He didn’t answer directly. He just said, “Dispatch got weird traffic tonight. On that channel. We thought it was interference at first.”

“What kind of traffic?”

He rubbed his jaw like he didn’t want to say it.

“A man asking for help,” he said finally. “Saying he was lost. Saying he was on Trail Six.”

My stomach dropped.

“That was me,” I whispered.

He shook his head once.

“No,” he said. “It started before you called. And it kept going after you stopped.”

I didn’t sleep that night. Not really. I lay in my apartment with my ankle propped up and my forearm throbbing and I kept hearing that clicking breath in the back of my head, like my brain had recorded it and didn’t know how to delete it.

Two days later, in daylight, I went back to the park office. I told myself I was going to file a report about the radio. I told myself I wanted closure.

The woman behind the counter was older, hair pulled back, eyes sharp in the way people get after years of dealing with strangers who don’t read rules.

I gave her my name and the date. She typed into her computer. Her nails clicked against the keys.

“No lost property matching that,” she said.

I nodded like I expected it.

Then I asked, carefully, “Do you get… strange radio calls? People using the wrong channel?”

Her eyes shifted, just a fraction, to a binder on the desk behind her. A plain three-ring binder with a white label strip.

She didn’t reach for it. She didn’t have to.

“There are signs in the brochure kiosk,” she said, voice neutral. “About emergency procedures.”

“I saw those,” I said. “They don’t mention radio channels.”

Her expression didn’t change, but her tone did. It got flatter.

“We don’t provide radio channels,” she said. “Not anymore.”

“Why?”

She stared at me for a moment like she was deciding how much truth a stranger deserved.

Then she slid a piece of laminated paper across the counter. Not a brochure. Not a map. Something that looked like it had been printed in-house and updated a hundred times.

It had one line in bold at the top:

DO NOT REQUEST ASSISTANCE OVER UNMONITORED FREQUENCIES.

Below that were three bullet points. Short. Clinical.

	•	If you are lost, stay on trail and stay put.

	•	Use emergency phones or call 911 if service is available.

	•	If you hear a voice directing you off-trail, do not respond.

My mouth went dry.

“That’s a weird thing to have to print,” I said.

She didn’t smile.

“It became necessary,” she said.

I tried to speak. My throat felt tight.

“Has anyone… been hurt?” I asked.

She paused long enough that my stomach sank again, then said, “People get found. People don’t get found. Same as any park.”

She reached under the counter and pulled out a small plastic bag.

Inside was a handheld radio. Not mine. Different brand. Same cheap shape. Mud dried into the grooves.

She set it on the counter like evidence.

“We find these sometimes,” she said. “Not often. Usually they’re dead. Sometimes they’re still on.”

I stared at it.

“What do you do when they’re still on?” I asked.

Her eyes met mine.

“We turn them off,” she said. “And we don’t stand there listening.”

I left after that. I didn’t argue. I didn’t ask for the location of the decommissioned lookout. I didn’t ask about the binder. I didn’t want to.

I drove home with both hands tight on the wheel and the irrational feeling that if I relaxed my grip, the car would drift into the trees.

Here’s the last thing I’ll say, because it’s the part I can’t explain away.

Last night, I was cleaning out my pack. Shaking dirt out of the seams. Counting what I’d lost.

I found the flare wrapper in a side pocket and the edge of the paper map, folded wrong from when I’d yanked it out. I found a smear of dried blood on the strap where my wrist scraped it when I fell.

And tucked into the smallest inside pocket, the one I never use, I found a strip of reflective tape.

The same kind that had been on the ground.

Damp. Cold, even though it had been inside my apartment for days.

When I held it up to the light, I saw something stuck to the adhesive.

A single dark hair, coarse and stiff, like it didn’t belong to any animal I know.

I threw the tape away. I took the trash out immediately. I washed my hands until my skin was raw.

And later, lying in bed with my ankle throbbing and my arm bruised and my phone charging on the nightstand, I heard a sound that made my whole body lock up.

A soft burst of static.

A click.

Not from outside. Not from the woods.

From somewhere in my apartment, close enough that I could hear the tiny speaker distortion.

Then, very quietly, my own voice, patient and calm, asking the same question it asked the night I thought help was real.

Something Answered Me Instead.,"I’m writing this with my right ankle wrapped so tight my toes keep going numb. The urgent care doctor called it a “moderate sprain” like that phrase makes it feel smaller. My left forearm has bruises shaped like fingers, too long to look right. The nurse didn’t say that part out loud, but her eyes did.

I went camping to get away from people. I ended up begging one for directions over a radio, and by the end of the night I wasn’t sure the voice on the other end was a person at all.

I want to be clear about something up front: I wasn’t out there trying to test myself. I’m not a survival guy. I wasn’t hunting for creepy stories. I had a reservation and a map and enough food for one night. I picked a back loop because the main campground was full of headlights, barking dogs, and Bluetooth speakers.

The park brochure called my site “primitive.” That should have been a hint. It meant a fire ring, a flat patch of dirt, and a picnic table with initials carved into it so deep the wood looked chewed.

The evening was normal. That’s the part I keep coming back to, like if I replay it enough times I’ll find the exact moment I made the wrong choice.

I ate a lukewarm meal out of a foil tray. I rinsed my hands with a water bottle. I watched the sun drain out of the trees. A couple times I heard something moving in the brush and I did the usual mental math: squirrel, raccoon, deer. I told myself I’d be up early and out before the day hikers showed.

Around nine, when the air got cold and damp, I realized my headlamp wasn’t in my pack.

I’d left it in the car.

The car was parked at a small pull-off a couple miles back. I remembered the pull-off because there was a brown trail sign with the number on it and one of those map cases bolted to a post. The plastic cover on the map case was cracked and someone had stuffed wet paper inside like they’d tried to light it on fire and failed.

I told myself it was a quick walk. I had my phone light. The trail was straightforward. One main path, then a spur.

Fifteen minutes, in and out.

I took my keys, my phone, and without thinking much about it, the little handheld radio I’d brought “just in case.” It was a cheap black unit with a stubby antenna and a screen that glowed green. I’d bought it years ago and barely used it, but I’d programmed in the park’s “ranger frequency” from something I’d read when planning the trip. It made me feel responsible, like I had a backup plan.

The first part of the walk was fine. My phone light made the trail look like a tunnel, and everything beyond it was just shadow and bark. The air smelled like pine needles and cold soil. My footsteps sounded louder than they should have.

Ten minutes in, I passed a reflective trail marker nailed to a tree. It flashed back at me like an animal eye. I remember thinking, good, I’m still on something official.

Another ten minutes and I still hadn’t hit the pull-off.

No gate. No gravel. No sign.

I slowed down, then stopped.

It wasn’t the dramatic “the forest went silent” thing people say. There were still insects. Wind in the needles. Something small moving deeper in the brush. But the human layer was gone. No distant voices from the campground. No car doors. No far-off engine.

I swung my light down and saw something that made my stomach drop.

My own boot prints, faint in the dust, curving off the trail and back toward where I’d come from. Not a clean loop like a track. A sloppy arc.

I had been walking in a circle without realizing it.

My first instinct was to laugh at myself, because that’s what you do when you’re embarrassed and alone. I took out the paper map and held it up in the beam of my phone. The lines and symbols might as well have been a subway map for a city I’d never visited. Everything around me looked the same. Trees, roots, brush, darkness.

I checked the time. 10:18 p.m.

That was when I remembered the radio.

I turned it on. The screen lit up. Static hissed softly.

I pressed the transmit button.

“Ranger station, this is a camper on the back loop. I’m lost. I’m on Trail Six somewhere, I think. I’m trying to get back to the entrance. Do you copy?”

Static, then a click like someone keying a mic.

A voice came through, flattened by the speaker, calm enough to make my shoulders sag with relief.

“Copy. Stand by.”

I let out a breath I didn’t realize I’d been holding.

“Thank you,” I said. “I parked at a pull-off by a gated service road. Brown sign, map case. I walked out to grab my headlamp and I looped. I can’t find the spur back.”

Another pause. Behind the voice, I could hear a faint background sound like wind hitting a building, or maybe just the radio adding its own texture.

“Describe what you see,” the voice said.

It sounded like a man, middle-aged, the kind of voice you’d expect from someone who’s given directions for a living. Not hurried. Not annoyed. Like he’d rather talk you down than lecture you later.

“Evergreens,” I said. “Packed dirt trail. I’m at a fork. Left looks wider, right looks narrow and drops down.”

“Take the right,” he said.

I stared at the fork. The left side looked like the main trail. The right looked like an animal path that someone had convinced themselves was a trail.

“The right is smaller,” I said. “Are you sure?”

“Yes,” he said, immediate. “Right will put you on the access road.”

That didn’t match what my common sense was screaming, but I had a voice on the radio. A ranger. Someone official. I wanted badly for that to be true.

I turned right.

As I walked, I narrated what I could. A fallen limb. A patch of damp ground. The slope. I kept waiting for the trail to open up onto something recognizable.

The radio clicked again.

“Keep your light low,” the voice said.

“What?”

“Keep it low,” he repeated. “Do not swing it around.”

That made no sense. Every safety pamphlet I’d ever seen said the opposite: make yourself visible. Stay put. Conserve battery. Signal.

I should have stopped right there. I should have turned the radio off and started climbing toward higher ground, or stayed put and waited for morning.

Instead, I did what he said. I pointed the beam at my feet and tried not to move it.

A minute later, he asked, “Do you hear water?”

I stopped and listened.

Nothing I could pick out. Just the normal whispering of trees.

“No.”

“Do you hear anything else?” he asked.

The question was too open. Too curious. It didn’t sound like someone trying to locate me. It sounded like someone checking whether I was alone.

“Just… woods,” I said. “Why?”

Static. Then, softly, “Keep moving.”

My phone battery ticked down. Twenty percent. Eighteen. The cold was chewing through it faster than I expected.

I tried to keep my breathing steady. I kept walking.

That’s when I saw the reflective marker again.

Except it wasn’t on a tree.

It was on the ground.

A small rectangle of reflective tape in the dirt, like it had been torn off and dropped. The soil around it looked scraped, disturbed. Not clear footprints, more like something heavy had been dragged across the trail and then lifted.

I crouched without thinking and touched it with two fingers.

The tape was damp and cold.

The radio clicked.

“Don’t touch that,” the voice said.

I froze mid-crouch.

“How did you…” I started, then swallowed it. He couldn’t see me. He couldn’t.

I stood up slowly, heart thudding.

“Ranger,” I said, “what’s your name?”

A pause long enough for the static to fill my head.

“You don’t need that,” the voice said.

My skin prickled under my shirt.

Behind me, somewhere off the trail, something moved.

Not a squirrel. Not a deer. It was too measured. Too heavy.

Footsteps.

One slow step, then another, like something matching my stop and start.

I turned my head without lifting the light. The beam stayed low, because part of me still clung to the idea that following the instructions kept me safe.

“Ranger,” I said quietly, “there’s something behind me.”

The voice on the radio didn’t sound surprised.

“I know,” it said.

My mouth went dry.

I lifted the light anyway and swung it toward the sound.

The beam caught tree trunks, low brush, a tangle of branches. Nothing obvious.

And the moment my light moved, the footsteps stopped.

I stood there in my own shaky cone of light, listening so hard my ears felt strained.

“Who is this?” I said into the radio, and my voice cracked on the last word.

Static surged, then cut suddenly, cleanly, like someone had switched channels.

Then I heard my own voice come back at me through the speaker.

“Who is this?”

Same cadence. Same crack. Same tiny breath at the end.

It wasn’t a recording quality. It wasn’t muffled like a replay. It was like someone had taken my words and thrown them right back.

I jerked the radio away from my face like it had burned me.

The voice returned, calm again, but different now. Less like a person. More like someone wearing a person’s tone.

“Don’t raise your voice,” it said. “Keep moving.”

My chest tightened. I forced myself to turn and start walking, because standing still felt worse. The trail ahead looked narrower than before. Less maintained. The smell changed, too. A sourness under the pine, like wet fur and old meat.

My phone light flickered.

“Ranger,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady, “I’m going back to the fork. The left trail is wider.”

The radio clicked so fast it felt like an interruption.

“No,” the voice said, sharp. “Do not go back.”

At the same moment, the sound behind me changed.

It wasn’t footsteps anymore. It was a dry, rapid clicking, like someone trying to speak through a throat that didn’t work right.

I stopped walking. My hands shook. I could feel my pulse in my fingers.

I swung the light again.

This time the beam caught it.

Between two trees, half-hidden, a shape that was too tall to be a deer and too thin to be a bear. It was standing upright, but not like a person stands. Its posture was wrong, weight distributed like it wasn’t used to its own joints.

Its torso was narrow and too long. Its arms hung low, almost to its knees. The head was the worst part, because my brain kept trying to label it and failing. It wasn’t antlers like the stories. It wasn’t a clean skull. It looked like skin pulled tight over something sharp. The top had uneven ridges like bone pushing out from inside.

Two dull reflective points caught my light, not bright like animal eyes, but wet and heavy.

It tilted its head.

Then it took one step toward me.

Not loud. Not charging. Just a single, confident step that erased distance too quickly.

I ran.

I ran because I didn’t have a better idea.

The trail pitched down and twisted. My phone light bounced wildly. My breathing turned into ragged pulls. Behind me, I heard movement through brush that didn’t sound panicked. It sounded like it knew exactly where it was going.

The radio in my fist hissed.

“Don’t run,” the voice said.

It didn’t sound worried. It sounded irritated, like I’d stopped playing the game correctly.

My phone light died in the middle of a step.

One second I had a cone of visibility, the next I was in full dark.

I nearly faceplanted. My arms flailed. My foot caught a root. I stumbled, recovered, and kept moving with only the green glow of the radio screen.

The creature’s clicking breath stayed with me. Sometimes louder, sometimes fainter, like it was pacing me from the side.

I tried to slow down to save my ankle, but the moment I did, the clicking got closer.

I ran again.

The trail dipped hard. My foot hit something slick. I went down on my hands and knees. Pain shot up my right wrist like a spark. My knee slammed a root. I bit my tongue and tasted blood.

I pushed up fast, panicked, and my right ankle rolled on loose needles.

A clean, sharp pain climbed my leg and almost took me down again. I had to catch myself against a tree trunk.

I couldn’t put my full weight on that foot anymore.

Behind me, the clicking stopped.

For one breathless second, I thought maybe it had paused. Maybe it had decided I wasn’t worth it.

Then I felt it behind me. Not in a mystical way. In the way you feel a person standing too close in an elevator. Air pressure. Heat. Presence.

I turned, lifting the radio screen like a useless flashlight.

The green glow caught a piece of its face and shoulder.

Up close it wasn’t just thin. It looked damaged. Skin torn and healed wrong, like something had ripped it and it had closed back up without care. The mouth was pulled too wide, lips stretched tight, teeth crowded and uneven like they’d grown in wrong.

It reached toward me with those long, jointed fingers.

I swung the radio at it as hard as I could. Plastic cracked against something solid. The radio flew out of my hand and skittered into the dark.

The creature didn’t flinch.

It grabbed my left forearm.

The grip wasn’t wet or slimy like horror movies. It was cold and dry, like grabbing a dead branch. The pressure was immediate, crushing. Pain bloomed so fast it turned my vision white.

I screamed.

I yanked back, twisting. It dragged me a step like I weighed nothing. Its fingers tightened and I felt something in my arm give in a way that made me nauseous.

My free hand fumbled in my jacket pocket and found the one thing I’d thrown in there without thinking: a cheap road flare. I’d packed it because it was small and because I’d told myself, “It can’t hurt.”

My fingers shook so badly I almost dropped it.

I popped the cap, scraped the tip, and for half a second nothing happened and I thought I’d just died doing something stupid.

Then it lit.

A violent red flame, hissing, bright enough to turn the trees into hard-edged black silhouettes.

The creature jerked back like the light hit it physically. Its grip loosened. Not a full release, but enough.

I ripped my arm free and stumbled backward, holding the flare out between us like a spear.

In the red light I saw more of it. Legs too long. Knees bending in a way that looked half backwards. Skin mottled like bruises under thin flesh. Dark stains around its mouth that weren’t fresh but weren’t old enough to be nothing.

It didn’t charge.

It watched the flare with the same tilted-head curiosity, clicking softly.

Then it did something that snapped the situation into a new, colder shape.

It looked past the flare.

Down at the ground.

Toward where the radio had slid.

It took a slow step toward it, careful, like it didn’t want to get close to the flare.

Another step.

It wasn’t focused on me. It wanted the radio.

My throat tightened. I backed away, flare held out, and realized the “ranger” voice hadn’t been trying to save me. It had been trying to keep me moving, keep me talking, keep me transmitting.

Like a lure.

Like a line it could follow.

The creature crouched, long limbs folding wrong, and picked up the radio with those stick-like fingers. It turned it over as if it understood what it was holding.

Then the radio clicked.

And from the speaker, not from my hand now but from the thing’s hand, came the voice again.

Calm. Patient.

“Describe what you see.”

The creature lifted its head, still holding the radio, and the dull reflective points of its eyes turned to me.

I felt my stomach drop through the floor.

I didn’t wait to see what it would do next. I turned and limped away as fast as my ankle would let me, flare burning down in my hand, my left arm throbbing and numb where it had grabbed me.

The clicking breath moved with me, not rushing, not fading. Just staying close enough to remind me it could.

The flare shortened quickly, heat biting my palm. Red sparks spat into the dark.

I forced myself to follow the trail because stepping off into the trees felt like stepping off a dock at night. You don’t know what you’ll hit until you do.

Ahead, through the trees, I saw something angular and straight. Not a branch. Not a trunk.

A signpost.

I limped toward it and almost cried when I saw the reflective letters catch the flare light.

TRAIL 6

SERVICE ROAD 0.4

RANGER STATION 1.2

My brain snagged on that last line.

RANGER STATION.

Deeper.

Not out.

The flare hissed lower. The light dimmed.

From off to my right, through the trees, I heard the radio again.

A little burst of static.

A click.

Then my own voice, thin and distant, as if someone had learned the shape of it and was practicing.

“Ranger station… do you copy?”

I froze.

The sound didn’t come from behind. It came from the side, like it was trying to draw my attention off the trail. Toward the trees. Toward the direction that sign said “RANGER STATION.”

My chest tightened hard enough to hurt.

I turned my face away from the sound and forced my feet to move toward “SERVICE ROAD 0.4.”

Every step on that ankle was a bright spike of pain. My left arm felt heavy and wrong. I could feel bruising spreading under my skin.

The flare died with a wet sputter.

Darkness swallowed everything.

I stood still for a second because my eyes were useless and my panic was loud. Then I heard it again. The clicking breath, closer, patient.

I moved.

I walked by feel, hands out, fingertips catching branches, following the faint line of packed dirt underfoot. I slipped once on loose gravel and almost went down. I caught myself against a tree and felt bark dig into my scraped palm.

The radio crackled in the trees.

Sometimes it was static. Sometimes it was my voice repeating the same few words. Sometimes it was that calm “ranger” voice saying, “You’re almost there.”

After what felt like an hour but was probably ten minutes, the ground changed under my boots.

Gravel.

Then flat, hard-packed gravel.

A road.

I stepped forward and the tree line opened just enough that I could make out a darker shape ahead.

A metal gate.

I stumbled to it and grabbed it with both hands like it was a lifeline. The metal was cold. I pressed my forehead to it and pulled in air that tasted like rust and sap.

Behind me, the radio static swelled.

Close.

I turned slowly.

I couldn’t see it in the dark, but I could hear it. The clicking breath, a soft scrape of something moving through brush just off the road, staying in the cover of trees.

The radio clicked.

“Open the gate,” the voice said.

It didn’t sound like a ranger anymore. It sounded strained, like the words were being forced out through a mouth that didn’t fit them.

“I can’t,” I whispered, because my brain was still treating it like a conversation.

“Open it,” the voice repeated.

And under the words, the clicking breath accelerated, excited.

I backed away from the gate, then stopped, because backing away meant stepping closer to the sound.

I stood in the middle of the service road, gravel under my boots, and tried to think.

Cars used service roads. Rangers used service roads. If I followed it long enough, I’d hit something. A lot. A building. A sign. Anything.

Staying still felt like waiting to be taken.

I chose movement.

I limped down the road, faster than my ankle wanted, gravel crunching underfoot. To my right, in the tree line, something moved with me, quiet and effortless.

Every few seconds, the radio voice tried a new angle.

“Turn back.”

“You’re going the wrong way.”

“Your car is not there.”

Then, softer, using my voice again, like it was trying to sound concerned.

“Hey… hey… where are you?”

I didn’t answer. I bit down on my tongue and kept moving.

The road curved. The trees thinned.

And then, ahead, I saw the faint outline of a vehicle.

My car.

The pull-off.

I almost fell from relief. My hands shook so badly I dropped my keys once, then found them by feel and hit the unlock button.

The beep sounded like the best noise I’ve ever heard.

I got the driver’s door open and folded into the seat, dragging my bad ankle in like it didn’t belong to me. Pain flashed up my leg. I slammed the door and locked it.

For a second, I sat there in the dark, breathing hard, staring straight ahead like that would keep me safe.

Then I looked at my side mirror.

At the edge of the pull-off, where gravel met trees, something stood half-hidden in the brush.

Tall. Too thin. Motionless.

In one hand, a small green glow.

My radio.

It lifted the radio slightly, as if showing it to me.

Then the speaker crackled.

And the voice that came out was mine, careful and patient, exactly the way I’d sounded when I thought help was real.

“Ranger station… do you copy?”

I turned the key.

The engine coughed, then caught. The dashboard lit up.

The headlights snapped on, bright white, flooding the pull-off.

The brush at the edge of the trees was empty.

No movement. No shape. No glowing radio.

Just branches and shadow.

I didn’t wait. I threw the car into reverse, gravel spraying, and drove like I was late for my own funeral.

I didn’t stop until I hit pavement. I didn’t stop until I saw another vehicle’s taillights. I didn’t stop until I found the park office, a dark building with a big sign and an emergency phone mounted on the wall.

I called.

I told the person on the other end that I was injured, lost, and something had chased me. I didn’t say “wendigo.” I didn’t say “monster.” I said “an animal” because I needed them to send someone and I didn’t want to sound insane.

They told me to stay in my car with the doors locked until a ranger arrived.

A ranger truck rolled in twenty minutes later. Light bar flashing, tires crunching. The ranger was young, maybe late twenties, and he had the exhausted posture of someone who’d already worked a full day and then got pulled into someone else’s mistake.

He walked up to my window and I rolled it down an inch. I didn’t mean to, but the second I saw a uniform my throat tightened and my eyes burned.

He took one look at my hands and my ankle and swore under his breath.

“Jesus,” he muttered. “Okay. Okay. You did the right thing coming here.”

He helped me into his truck. The heater blew air that smelled like coffee and old vinyl. My body started shaking now that the danger was gone enough for my nerves to catch up.

On the drive to the clinic in the nearest town, he asked me what happened.

I told him the clean version first. Lost the trail. Radioed for help. Got turned around. Something grabbed me.

I didn’t talk about the voice using my voice until the words fell out by accident.

“It repeated me,” I said, staring at my bruised arm. “Like… like it was throwing my words back.”

The ranger’s hands tightened on the steering wheel.

“What channel were you on?” he asked.

“Seven,” I said. “The ranger frequency.”

His eyes flicked to me, quick.

“That’s not ranger dispatch,” he said.

My mouth went dry. “Then who answered me?”

He didn’t answer right away. He watched the road ahead like he was reading it.

Finally he said, “Nobody should have.”

The clinic wrapped my ankle, checked my wrist, cleaned the scrapes on my palms. The bruises on my forearm had started to bloom dark purple by then, finger-shaped, too long. The nurse asked if I’d gotten caught in wire.

I nodded because it was easier than explaining I’d been grabbed by something that didn’t move like a person.

When I came out, the ranger was still there. He stood by his truck with his hands in his jacket pockets like he didn’t want to leave me alone to walk to my car.

“Did you find my radio?” I asked, and I hated how small my voice sounded.

He shook his head. “No.”

I swallowed. “Is there… is there an old ranger station out there? Like an actual tower?”

He hesitated, then sighed like he’d made a decision.

“There’s a decommissioned lookout,” he said. “Old structure. Not staffed. We don’t use it.”

“So the voice could’ve been someone messing with me,” I said, trying to find a normal explanation to cling to.

He looked tired, and for a second he looked older than he was.

“It’s possible,” he said. “But listen to me. If you ever camp again, you do not call for help on random channels. You call the emergency number. You stay put. You don’t let a voice tell you to walk deeper. You understand?”

I nodded.

He leaned closer, lowering his voice like the night could hear us.

“And if you hear your own voice come back at you,” he added, “you stop transmitting.”

I stared at him.

“You’ve heard that?” I asked.

He didn’t answer directly. He just said, “Dispatch got weird traffic tonight. On that channel. We thought it was interference at first.”

“What kind of traffic?”

He rubbed his jaw like he didn’t want to say it.

“A man asking for help,” he said finally. “Saying he was lost. Saying he was on Trail Six.”

My stomach dropped.

“That was me,” I whispered.

He shook his head once.

“No,” he said. “It started before you called. And it kept going after you stopped.”

I didn’t sleep that night. Not really. I lay in my apartment with my ankle propped up and my forearm throbbing and I kept hearing that clicking breath in the back of my head, like my brain had recorded it and didn’t know how to delete it.

Two days later, in daylight, I went back to the park office. I told myself I was going to file a report about the radio. I told myself I wanted closure.

The woman behind the counter was older, hair pulled back, eyes sharp in the way people get after years of dealing with strangers who don’t read rules.

I gave her my name and the date. She typed into her computer. Her nails clicked against the keys.

“No lost property matching that,” she said.

I nodded like I expected it.

Then I asked, carefully, “Do you get… strange radio calls? People using the wrong channel?”

Her eyes shifted, just a fraction, to a binder on the desk behind her. A plain three-ring binder with a white label strip.

She didn’t reach for it. She didn’t have to.

“There are signs in the brochure kiosk,” she said, voice neutral. “About emergency procedures.”

“I saw those,” I said. “They don’t mention radio channels.”

Her expression didn’t change, but her tone did. It got flatter.

“We don’t provide radio channels,” she said. “Not anymore.”

“Why?”

She stared at me for a moment like she was deciding how much truth a stranger deserved.

Then she slid a piece of laminated paper across the counter. Not a brochure. Not a map. Something that looked like it had been printed in-house and updated a hundred times.

It had one line in bold at the top:

DO NOT REQUEST ASSISTANCE OVER UNMONITORED FREQUENCIES.

Below that were three bullet points. Short. Clinical.

	•	If you are lost, stay on trail and stay put.

	•	Use emergency phones or call 911 if service is available.

	•	If you hear a voice directing you off-trail, do not respond.

My mouth went dry.

“That’s a weird thing to have to print,” I said.

She didn’t smile.

“It became necessary,” she said.

I tried to speak. My throat felt tight.

“Has anyone… been hurt?” I asked.

She paused long enough that my stomach sank again, then said, “People get found. People don’t get found. Same as any park.”

She reached under the counter and pulled out a small plastic bag.

Inside was a handheld radio. Not mine. Different brand. Same cheap shape. Mud dried into the grooves.

She set it on the counter like evidence.

“We find these sometimes,” she said. “Not often. Usually they’re dead. Sometimes they’re still on.”

I stared at it.

“What do you do when they’re still on?” I asked.

Her eyes met mine.

“We turn them off,” she said. “And we don’t stand there listening.”

I left after that. I didn’t argue. I didn’t ask for the location of the decommissioned lookout. I didn’t ask about the binder. I didn’t want to.

I drove home with both hands tight on the wheel and the irrational feeling that if I relaxed my grip, the car would drift into the trees.

Here’s the last thing I’ll say, because it’s the part I can’t explain away.

Last night, I was cleaning out my pack. Shaking dirt out of the seams. Counting what I’d lost.

I found the flare wrapper in a side pocket and the edge of the paper map, folded wrong from when I’d yanked it out. I found a smear of dried blood on the strap where my wrist scraped it when I fell.

And tucked into the smallest inside pocket, the one I never use, I found a strip of reflective tape.

The same kind that had been on the ground.

Damp. Cold, even though it had been inside my apartment for days.

When I held it up to the light, I saw something stuck to the adhesive.

A single dark hair, coarse and stiff, like it didn’t belong to any animal I know.

I threw the tape away. I took the trash out immediately. I washed my hands until my skin was raw.

And later, lying in bed with my ankle throbbing and my arm bruised and my phone charging on the nightstand, I heard a sound that made my whole body lock up.

A soft burst of static.

A click.

Not from outside. Not from the woods.

From somewhere in my apartment, close enough that I could hear the tiny speaker distortion.

Then, very quietly, my own voice, patient and calm, asking the same question it asked the night I thought help was real.

Obviously. I mean it doesn’t even bear explanation. I’m sure you already know where I’m going with this.

But for those of you who missed it, SPOILERS but… in what was otherwise a fun and entertaining episode, they punctuated each section with an ad break featuring Lesser Tom pouring hot beverages into mugs.

Lesser Tom. WTF is that?

If it’s supposed to be coffee then why does it look like that?? Did you put milk in the pot? Why would you put milk in the coffee pot??? Especially not quite enough milk for literally any kind of coffee drinker? You’ve just ruined the pot and you know it and to rub our faces in it over and over… obviously I feel violated. Just like you clearly intended. You degenerate tainted beverage pourer.

Or is it hot chocolate? And if so then I’ve just got one question: what is wrong with you???? It’s a beautiful sunny day and you’re pouring the darkest most bitter looking hot chocolate I’ve ever seen, as if to say: “You know you don’t want this, I know you don’t want this, but I’m pouring it for you anyway because you’re my bitch! Suck my bitter hot chocky you bitch-ass punk!!!”

I assume Lesser Tom will be immediately fired and a public statement will be made forthwith. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

1qahtb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/okbuddyfumiko/comments/1qahtb7/my_love_letter/,My love letter,"Holy fucking shit of the Gun Devil, I am really freaking obsessed with Makima from Chainsaw Man. Like, I’m so focused on being her ""Good Boy"" that my heart rate literally triggers a sensory-type contract. The fact that she doesn't actually view me as anything more than a domesticated mammal has sent me into the deepest pits of the Hell Devil’s realm. My CIVIL SERVANT DOMINATION FETISH™ has consumed me and I cannot take it anymore.
Every night, I ponder deeply about what her dry-cleaned suit and her ""Bang"" gesture smell like. I want her to crush my bank account into a paste and squeeze my credit score out like toothpaste from a tube by giving me a performance review. After that, I want her to pin me to the office carpet by stepping on my neck and force me to apologize for the blood stains on her beautiful, succulent trench coat.
I wish I was reborn as the her shoes sheuses to walk her huskies. I would cherish every moment spent with her foot aroma intoxicating me. I wish I was the ginger root in her refrigerator, or the very blindfold she wears when she’s about to sacrifice a life for the ""Greater Good."" To be her 23rd favorite pet... oh, what a wonderful honor it would be. I am but an unworthy Devil Hunter.
I would sell my own partner to the Katana Man just to hear her say ""Woof"" to me for 5 minutes. I would drink every drop of her lukewarm office PERIOD BLOOD like the most exquisite and divine nectar. I would do anything to be used as a human shield in an ambush. I want Mommy Makima to strap me to a chair in a high-security basement and stuff her used, preferably coffee-stained paperwork inside my mouth to muffle my screams.
Then, I want her to perform an unnecessary contract on me, and I want to be hooked up to an IV of espresso mixed with period blood specifically so that I stay awake throughout the entire existential crisis. I want to feel every single psychological barrier break as I helplessly bark for her approval. I want her to show no mercy. I want it to be bureaucratic, too. Like, I want to file my own death certificate from the pain, and I want her to make me pay the processing fee.
Then, I want her to sit on my desk and stare at me with those swirling, hypnotic eyes until I suffocate to the point of permanent ego death. Then, when I’m paralyzed and on a leash, I want to be smothered by her ""necessary sacrifices."" And finally, as a coup-de-grace, I want her to euthanize me by pointing her finger at my forehead and saying ""Bang"" with the cold indifference of a tax auditor. Just the thought of it makes me bark uncontrollably. I am literally growling at my mailman as I'm writing this.

I want her to perform Morse code but tapping her tongue in her belly button

I want her to perform bottom surgery on me with her feet (unwashed ofc) and feed me the remains. I want her to suffocate me and fart down my throat until I transcend into another species.
I am absolutely furious at Tatsuki Fujimoto, because with all the talent he has, he could have made her real and given her more screen time in the anime. Is there any hope for me left? Or am I just another name on a list of casualties?",6,1768182299.0,okbuddyfumiko,2,0.88,False
