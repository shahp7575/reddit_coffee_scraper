1h112fo,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1h112fo/inappropriate_behaviour/,Inappropriate behaviour?,"TL, DR Young F colleague complimenting husband and inviting him to places alone and telling him she misses him. I think she is inappropriate, he says she's just like that.  
  
Hello, we are a couple of married 50+ (married in 2001) and I recently discovered that a younger colleague of my husband is interacting inappropriately with him (she's 35).  
I had a feeling that she was too attached to him since she joined the company, I can't explain why, because I had never met her but just hearing what my husband said about her and their calls it seemed that she was too willing too see him and too available. All the colleagues work remotely except for when they need to meet.  
She joined the company 2 years ago and I have never addressed the ""issue"" because I was simply dismissing my feeling.  
Then, a couple of months ago the colleagues decided to go to theater together and as soon as the organizer said that my husband would go, she replied she would go too. My husband asked me if I was interested in the show, too, and I said that I would go.  
After a couple of days, many people changed their mind so it would have been me, my husband and her BUT she didn't know that I was going yet. So, for her it would have been she and my husband at the theater alone.  
But she did not say: oh, ok, this is not a team event anymore, so we can cancel it.  
No, she would have gone to the show with my hubby alone. Then, after a few minutes she discovered I was going too and didn't say anything nor changed her mind.  
But her behavior made me thinking: she was willing to go with a married man alone, and my gut feeling came back.  
We went to the show, then home. I didn't like her in person but I admit I can be biased.  
The day after I asked my husband: did she give you the money for the ticket? I don't think it's appropriate to pay for her ticket, considering that she makes a lot of money, too.  
And he replied that yes, she had paid him back.  
I don't know why, because this is THE FIRST TIME in my life that I check somebody's phone, but I didn't trust him and I read their whatsapp chat and discovered that the day after she told him that she had to pay for her ticket and he replied: oh, don't worry. You will pay me back in the future with a beer or coffee.  
Reminder: they are colleagues so when they are together for work, it's the company that pays. So, this could look like an invitation or something.  
I froze.  
I then read the whole chat back to the beginning and discovered that she wrote him multiple times telling him how much she admires him as a mentor, and that she misses him when he is not at company organized social events etc.  
They frequently organize dinners etc and maybe he won't go, and every time he replies he will not attend, she says: Oh, I will miss you so much.  
They went to a convention a few weeks ago and she wrote him she would like to go to an exhibition with him after the convention. There were 4 people at the convention but she did NOT invite the others, she just invited him. And he went. And then he called me and told me about the exhibition but he lied to me, telling me that all four of them were there.  
When I read the chat, I confronted my husband and apologized for reading it but told him that in my opinion she is giving him signals of being available even if she is not really ""aggressive"" in her behavior.  
In this occasion he admitted his lie and told me that he preferred to tell me that all the 4 colleagues were there because he knew I would be jealous.   
I am not the jealous type, never been. He travels a lot for work and he could have done whatever he wanted with colleagues or prostitutes or other women because I don't check on him and he is frequently travelling.  
Therefore, I don't accept his explanation because, to me, she is behaving inappropriately and even if he is not cheating on me, he should act more distant with her.  
He agrees with me but keeps saying that he never thought she was inappropriate and that the fact the he paid for her theater ticket was just an act of kindness.   
I could accept him paying for her and I certainly have nothing against him going to an exhibition with her after work, but I can't accept the lies because he deliberately decided to lie to me about both things, just to ""keep me quiet"" (in his mind, because I would never make a scene about that!).  
Now they are going to another event again and I have to trust him but I have anxiety.  
I want her to stop behaving like this with him and I don't know what to do.  
He now agrees that he should act more distant but I can't trust him after what I read on the chat.  
I don't even know why I am writing here. I don't have any friends to whom talk about this and I don't want to exaggerate something that maybe it's just an innocent behavior on her part...

1h10zzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/wildcampingintheuk/comments/1h10zzi/a_year_of_wild_camping_all_the_gear_i_used/,A year of wild camping - all the gear I used,"https://preview.redd.it/zdg6oa402f3e1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=95813ba01006b002568b3e785fb09f1e1a494f85

Some friends and I challenged ourselves to go wild camping every month for a year. We sort of managed it, due to calendar conflicts we did a three night camp to cover some months. We managed to camp across December, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, November in Surrey, Suffolk, Dartmoor and Somerset.  


https://preview.redd.it/iv4xipye2f3e1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c778e1b6847828d29674016eae1bfbd408bb202

I used this sub to get a lot of gear tips and other advice, so after a lot of lurking thought I'd post to share my experience, for those looking at similar gear and setups to me. A lot of the time when I research a product I come to reddit to see if it's recommended or not.

I'm a bit sick of YouTube influencers clearly just promoting whatever shit they've been sent with an affiliate link. I can't promise I've done a lot of thorough gear testing, but I'll be honest.

I'm also interested to hear recommendations people may have to improve my setup.

Please feel free to ask me about what I like or not, and let me know how your kit compares.

**Me**

Thirty something sedentary lifesystle but not entirely inactive. Familiar with camping but don't get to go much and never invested much. I get really cold.

Camps are about enjoying half decent food either socially or in solitude. I like a bit of exercise but I'm not competing on long distance or ultralight. Happy to go heavy for comfort. Don't really want to spend much on the best gear, but want reliable gear.  


https://preview.redd.it/1ghjhufb4f3e1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a98147b20db3bd39d782d6aa6c5de5f2a17211c4

In a social camp I want to stay up late, I want to be able to chat, drink and eat lots.

In a solo camp I want to be unseen and comfortable. Hearty food and a lie down, usually with headphones.

I shop mostly online. I've used alpkit a few times due to their sales. Go outdoors probably the most common physical store I've used. Recently discovered decathlon, which seems good for cheap clothing.

https://preview.redd.it/ho1ex3j72f3e1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f4ee0ddde475c2eeb86cba3a548b8f32683d0b37

**MO**

Most camps were quite social with 4 members. We usually meet about 0900 then hike until midday, finding a convenient pub, then hiking until sunset. Then we sit around drinking and shit talking until midnight.

We always end up pitching in near darkness, which I'm mocked for complaining about. My preference is to identify a spot in good light even if we don't pitch up immediately, so we don't accidentally pitch near an unseen path - this happened once. However, we tend to walk into darkness. Usually that means we've walked far enough for it not to be a problem.

**Bags**

* Deuter Aircontact 65+10L - I got this about 25 years ago. I thought it was pretty modern but realised it was quite heavy. Nothing wrong with it at all, but for our 3 nighter I got concerned about going lighter.
* Osprey Kestrel 58L. Fantastic bag, much lighter than my previous and the main compartment has both a drawstring top and a large suitcase style zip. Downsizing bag helped me control my overpacking habit. I like my tech and photography so I usually have 3kg of additional kit, if you don't do this you can easily go for a smaller version.
* Dry sacks - I have a bunch of osprey and OEX dry sacks I use to organise my gear. I know people say to use one large liner as things like your sleeping bag will fill the space better, but personally I prefer being able to open my bag (I mentioned the large zip on the osprey 68l) and pull out exactly what I need without a kit explosion. I've been soaked through before and never had my gear get wet. IKEA now do some cheap dry sacks that feel pretty rugged but are on the smaller side, not got them wet yet but currently have one for toiletries, nice because they're clear so good when you have lots of small items.

**Shelter**

* Vango banshee 200 - classic, reliable. I nearly got a phoxx ii but the banshee seemed easier for outer pitching first. I keep the inner and outer attached. I put the poles against the frame of my pack and the tent itself squished down small in a dry sack. I'd choose this tent if it's cold, lots of heavy rain or multiple nights. I keep my gear except boots in the main compartment with plenty of room. A couple of my buddies have the phoxx and I'm always quite envious, particularly when you look at the price. I don't think the outer pitch first makes a big difference given how quick both are to setup.
* DD hammocks ultralight tarp - amazing tarp. Really helps cut down on weight. I've used this shelter the most. Gunyah or tarp tent configurations are my preference, they're great with foul weather. Only difficult experience was in a foggy valley where I found ridiculous amounts of condensation in the tarp tent. Easy to be social with a lean-to or Gunyah. I usually pair this with a DD magic carpet to avoid ground moisture.
* Alpkit Elan - Only used it once so far, but I really liked this and it suits my desire to be stealthy on solo camps. I can fit my kit inside but can't access my kit with it zipped up, which was problematic. Not suitable for a social camp. I paired with a tarp so I could sit in the rain, cook and keep my boots dry.
* Dutch army poncho tarp - I got this because the DD super light doesn't come in multicam and I wanted a shelter to use with the elan. Leaked at the seams, weighs a tonne. Wouldn't use again.
* Alpkit Hunka XL - I've used this when tarp camping in the rain to protect my leviathan. Does the job, can even fit my gear if necessary. I would prefer it to have a zip as getting in and out is difficult.
* Brasher telescopic walking pole - cheapest I could find. It does what it needs to. I always carry it for use with a tarp. You can find a stick in the woods usually, but the soft handle is good for a tarp tent. It's a tad short for a gunyah, but works well enough. I also use it on boggy terrain to feel out safe places to walk.

**Sleep system**

* Gelert X-treme lite 800 - it's about 15 years old, works fine in summer, pretty light. Haven't used it on a night where I was worried about the cold.
* OEX Leviathan 900. Down. I worry about damp/condensation - I did get it damp once and the impact was noticable in that spot. Otherwise very warm, often too warm if you're wearing thermals. Got it for about £100 in a gooutdoors sale so lookout for those. I'd highly recommend if you're sleeping out of summer and you can get it on sale. I store it in the mesh bag it comes in, but when in my bag I compress it in a 15L dry sack. Though I've been too warm some nights, that's more from me figuring out my sleepwear. I've used it to sit out in the snow and watch the stars. I'd trust this in any UK cold extremes.
* OEX Furnace 8 - I use the liner mainly to keep my bag clean as this is a lot easier to throw in the wash. Adds some warmth. I slept at 0c with this and the leviathan and had to remove clothes.
* Snugpak Jungle Blanket - got this primarily for sitting out at night, it's good and resists wind and light rain well. Good in lieu of a sleeping bag on warmer nights. Definitely a luxury though - for the weight and size you'd be better off wearing proper clothes, but you don't get that warm cosy feeling.
* Deeplee camping mat - got this for £20 last minute on Amazon for our  first camp. I planned to replace it with something nicer when it popped. It hasn't popped yet and it's pretty comfortable and warm. Maybe it's a bit heavy around 800g but I'm happy for the price. I cut off the pillow to save some space/weight because it was the wrong size to be useful. It's easy enough to inflate by mouth but makes a weird sound that my companions mock and then everyone stands around making muntjack mating sounds.
* Trekology Aluft 2.0 - it's fine. Better than just using a jumper or the pillow built into the mat. Expensive relative to comfort.

**Cooking & Water**

* Alpkit Bruler - I like this but I've found spirit burners to be mixed in performance. I find the size to be awkward for the pots I have. I got fed up on my third dartmoor night because my water just didn't get hot enough for me.
* Lixada 650ml titanium pot - my favourite bit of cookware. Just big enough to do a ration pack and a plenty of coffee/hot chocolate water. Can go over any fuel source. Used it directly on fires quite a bit.
* Alpkit Brukit - Jet Boil knock off. Works great for heating water, can use it with mess tins, pans, etc. Only downside is it's really bulky for what it offers. But I like the reliability of it. I really wish the metal fins at the base were removable so you could stick the pot directly on a fire or other heat source. This is currently my go to, but I think I'm going to replace it with a 750ml titanium pot like above, paired with an ultralight stove like the Kraku.
* Wildo fold-a-cup - I've been using this because it's a convenient size, fitting in the brukit. Bit small when you want a big mug of hot chocolate though. I've tried various other mugs and thermos type cups but not found anything I prefer for the size/weight.
* REDCAMP portable stove - knock off firebox type thing. I really liked this, but it's heavy - particularly if you're carrying wood too. Only worth it if you'll definitely be pitched up for a long summer night with some steaks. There are lighter options, but they cost quite a bit.
* Lifeventure Superlight Spork - has always been enough for my needs.
* ESEE Izula - not really for cooking, but wasn't sure where to put this. I sometimes use it to cut steak but mostly paracord or sharpen sticks for sausages. I've had it about 15 years and it's great.
* Katadyn BeFree - I've used this a few times now with no issues and drinking water from a stream is somehow more refreshing. I worry the bottle will tear one day but nothing suggests it will. I'd rather replace with something like a sawyer squeeze I think.

**Food & Drink**

* MRE mains - for various reasons we have easy access to these. I really enjoy them but they can be heavy. Anything with beef or chicken is a good morale booster. My standard. If you can get them cheap, I suggest stocking up.
* Wayfarer meals - these are pretty much the same as the MREs but more expensive with less choice. Nothing wrong with them, heavy.
* Firepot meals - great food, low weight, but expensive. Gluten and Vegan options. I'd definitely take these on multiday trips.
* ""Plastic festival drinks pouches"" - for drinks, save some weight with these cheap and reusable containers.
* Mulled wine - Easy one to do over a stove or fire. You can get bags of spices from the supermarket, enhance it with extra oranges and cinnamon.
* Cocktails - Old fashioneds are my go to, I premix them but bring fresh oranges to garnish.
* Steak - Lots of the rural villages we park at have a butchers, really easy to put some salt, rosemary and oil in a bag with beef or lamb at the start of the walk then put it on a stove later on. Wrap it in foil and put it on a fire if you need.

**Comfort**

* OEX stool - not much better than sitting on the ground or a log. Good bedside table. Not worth the weight.
* TARKA camping chair - £15 aliexpress, had to try. Loads better than the stool.. but again, not worth the weight most of the time.

**Clothing**

* Lixada down booties - nice idea but far too warm to sleep in. Good if you're going to be sat still for extended periods.
* Sealskinz waterproof socks - a must have! My boots got soaked on a multi night camp. I had dry socks but if I'd worn them they would get soaked through from the boots. I wore the dry socks and my feet were kept nice and dry. Rarely use but always carry.
* Cheap sunglasses - not much to say, almost always use them. I found a cheap pair I keep in my bag.
* SCARPA Cyrus Mid GTX - great boot, very waterproof. I worried a bit about the height being too low, but support has always felt good. These have taken me all around the world - sun, snow and rain. I have noticed after 18 months the stitching is beginning to fray, which I am concerned about.
* Gloves - take gloves, warm and waterproof. I failed to take gloves on dartmoor in spring because it was pretty warm. But the wind and the rain really got to me at one point. Never again. I have a thick waterproof pair, but more commonly wear Forclaz MT900 mittens which are really practical. Honestly though, any gloves when you need them.
* Hot hands - I usually keep a couple of these in my bag, good on a cold morning, but I also use them sat outside in an evening. I like them over the fuel based ones because they can wait ready for use as required, but they don't fele environmentally friendly.
* Whitby warmer - this is a fuel based warmer, there's a zippo version too. Works really well, I've found filling it will last for 24-36 hours. I once fell asleep with it in my hoodie pocket and got quite a severe burn.
* Mountain warehouse merino base layers - one for day, one for night. Thin, light, relatively cheap. I'm always cold in the morning so put them on, after 30 minutes of walking I'm sweating, so try to avoid wearing too many layers when you set off.
* Fjallraven Vidda - tough, light rain proof, handy pockets, etc.

Java Burn, a recently introduced supplement, has ignited curiosity with its unique approach – targeting the power of your morning coffee for a potential metabolic boost. This in-depth exploration delves into all aspects of Java Burn, empowering you to make an informed decision about incorporating it into your weight loss routine.  

# Demystifying Java Burn: What is it Exactly?

Java Burn is a dietary supplement designed to work synergistically with your morning cup of joe. Packaged in convenient single-serving packets, this powder boasts a blend of natural ingredients aimed at enhancing your body's natural metabolic processes.  

# What Makes Java Burn Stand Out?

In a market saturated with weight loss supplements, Java Burn sets itself apart by leveraging the power of your existing coffee routine. Simply by adding a packet of the supplement to your daily coffee, you can potentially unlock a multitude of benefits:

* **Metabolic Enhancement:** Java Burn claims to stimulate your metabolism, potentially leading to a more efficient calorie-burning system.

# Unveiling the Science Behind Java Burn

While the exact scientific evidence supporting Java Burn's claims is still under development, let's explore the potential mechanisms of action behind some of its key ingredients:

**1. Green Tea Extract:** A well-known powerhouse, green tea is lauded for its metabolism-boosting properties. The presence of caffeine and catechins may contribute to increased thermogenesis (heat production) in the body, leading to potentially higher calorie burn.  

**2. Green Coffee Bean Extract:** Similar to green tea, green coffee bean extract boasts chlorogenic acid, a natural compound with potential anti-obesity effects. This extract may help regulate blood sugar levels and slow down the absorption of carbohydrates.  

**3. L-Carnitine:** This amino acid plays a crucial role in transporting fatty acids into your cells' mitochondria, the powerhouses where fat is burned for energy. Java Burn's inclusion of L-Carnitine may enhance this process, potentially increasing fat utilization.  

**4. Chromium:** This essential mineral is involved in regulating blood sugar levels. Chromium deficiency has been linked to increased belly fat storage. By including chromium, Java Burn may contribute to healthy blood sugar metabolism and potentially indirectly promote fat loss.  

**5. Additional Ingredients:** Java Burn incorporates a blend of vitamins (D, B6, and B12) that may enhance the overall efficacy of the formula and support general well-being.  

It's important to remember that individual results may vary, and a healthy diet and consistent exercise remain the cornerstones of successful weight management.

**Exploring the Safety of Java Burn:**

Naturally, safety is a paramount concern when considering any new supplement. Java Burn is formulated using all-natural ingredients and claims to be manufactured in GMP-certified facilities.  

**However, consulting with your healthcare provider before starting Java Burn is crucial, especially if you have any pre-existing medical conditions, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding.**

Your doctor can advise on potential interactions with any medications you're currently taking and ensure Java Burn aligns with your overall health plan.

# Unveiling the Practicalities of Java Burn:

**How to Use Java Burn:**

The simplicity of Java Burn's use is a major plus. Simply tear open a single-serve packet and add the powder to your morning coffee. Stir well, and enjoy your potentially metabolism-boosting cup of joe!

**Dosage and Consistency:**

The recommended dosage for Java Burn is one packet per day, consistently incorporated into your morning coffee routine. For optimal results, it's advised to maintain consistency for at least three months.  

**Taste and Texture:**

Java Burn is designed to be flavorless and dissolve completely into your coffee, ensuring no alteration to your favorite morning beverage.

Nina

It was almost four o’clock in the morning by the time I finally returned to my dorm.

Jessica and Lori were already asleep in their rooms judging from how dark and quiet everything was. The suite was a mess from the party and we would no doubt be spending the next day cleaning, but I was too hungover and tired to care at the moment. It appeared as though Lori and Jessica must have changed my sheets for me though, which I would have to thank them for in the morning. I wouldn’t have been able to sleep on the same sheets that Justin and Lisa had sex on.

As I laid in bed trying to sleep, I was kept awake by my regrets. Had I just given my virginity to a near-stranger? A playboy? All to get revenge against Justin and Lisa? I had never been so impulsive like this, especially when it came to love. Right now, I felt embarrassed and ashamed of this blunder. Enzo was incredibly attractive and the sex was wonderful, but right now, I just wanted to forget about it.

When I woke the next morning, my head pounded and my stomach hurt from all of the alcohol from the night before. I groaned and rolled out of bed, ignoring my appearance as I stumbled into the kitchen in my oversized t-shirt and shorts. I just needed some coffee.
“You know, you could’ve at least told us where you went last night,” Lori said from her usual spot at the kitchen island. She had a cup of coffee in front of her and was reading A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.

“I’m sorry,” I replied, my face turning red as I remembered what happened after the party. “I just needed to get out.”

“Why didn’t you tell us that you and Justin were a thing?” Jessica suddenly said, emerging from her room with a towel around her hair while she wore a fluffy pink robe and bunny slippers. She folded her arms and glared at me, pushing out her lower lip in a pout.

I hung my head low as I poured myself a cup of coffee. I tried to hide it as the tears started to well up, but it was no use. Jessica rushed over to me and wrapped her arms around me while Lori watched with a sorry expression on her face.

“I’m sorry,” I said between sobs. “H-He told me he just wanted to wait until the right time to make our relationship public. I t-thought he was just being a gentleman.”

“Men are trash,” Lori replied. “Most of them, anyway. Don’t beat yourself up over it. You can do way better than Justin Thurlow.”

Jessica nodded and rubbed my back, agreeing with Lori. “Yeah,” she said. “Screw boys. You’re smart and hot and you’re gonna be a doctor! Who needs boys? C’mon, let’s go get some breakfast.”

Jessica and Lori were right. Boys were just a waste of time, and I had more important things to think about. I changed into my usual jeans and hoodie, brushed and braided my hair, and went with my roommates to the dining hall.
“Oh my god!” Jessica exclaimed as we approached the dining hall. She squealed and pointed at none other than Enzo coming out the door.

Jessica’s excitement garnered the attention of other nearby girls, who also squealed and waved as Enzo approached. I grabbed my hair and used it to shield my face. I just wanted to shrink down into myself. Why did I have to run into Enzo right now, the morning after we had a one night stand?

To make matters worse, he approached us and stood in front of us. Even Lori seemed a bit excited at his presence.

Did he even remember our night together, or was he confused by how strangely I was acting?
“Hi, Enzo!” Jessica said, twirling a bit of her blonde hair around her finger. “Are you excited for the homecoming game today?”
I kept my gaze fixed on the ground, letting my bangs fall into my face, but I could feel Enzo’s stern gaze on me.

“Yeah,” he replied. “Although, it’s not as exciting when we always know we’re gonna crush the other team. I hope they put up a good fight.”

Jessica giggled like a giddy schoolgirl. I took a chance and glanced up, hoping to see Enzo walking away, but was met instead by his strong gaze fixed on me. He looked far less animalistic now; maybe his appearance last night was just a trick of the light, or a result of the alcohol.

Enzo had his arms folded across his muscular chest as he looked at me. He looked almost disapproving. Was he upset that I walked out on him last night? It hardly seemed likely, given his reputation, but my heart still ached a bit.

“You ready for practice, Enzo?” another guy said, striding up to us. He looked Jessica up and down hungrily, then glanced at me before looking at Enzo.

Enzo nodded and stuck his hands in his pockets, his brown eyes still on me.
“Yeah. Let’s go.”

Later that afternoon, after we had cleaned up the dorm, I was in my room studying for an upcoming biology exam when Jessica came into my room. She was wearing a pleated pink mini skirt, a fuzzy white sweater, and white sneakers with leg warmers. She had a full face of makeup on and her hair was curled perfectly.

“Oh my god, you’re not ready yet?” she said, storming over to me and snapping my book shut unceremoniously.

“Hey!” I said, throwing my pen down on my desk. “I was studying.”

“Studying can wait,” Jessica replied. “Come on, let’s go to the hockey game! I heard some rumors that Enzo is planning on using some new moves.”

My heart leapt up into my throat. “I’m not going,” I said, opening my book up to the page I was on. Jessica clearly didn’t like my response, because she stamped her foot on the ground angrily.

“Aw, come on!” she whined. “You’re not really gonna make me go alone, are you?”

I didn’t have the heart to tell my friend the truth about where I was last night. If she knew that I slept with Enzo, she would be heartbroken. Jessica had been pining away for Enzo since our first semester. He had never given her too much attention, but still she went to all of his games, cheered him on, and even watched all the livestreams of his tournaments online. She always talked about how he was a genius, how his physical abilities were godlike, how he easily won every game he competed in.

“Come on,” Jessica whined again. “Please? For me?” She batted her eyelashes and stuck her lower lip out.

I sighed and closed my book again, rubbing my tired eyes. “Alright,” I replied, although I really just wanted to hide in my room and never see the star hockey player again. “I’ll go. But you owe me.”

Jessica grinned and pranced out of the room while I got ready. I wanted to blend in, so I just wore a hoodie with the university logo on it and jeans. Jessica seemed a bit disappointed in my outfit choice, but didn’t say anything as we made our way to the hockey arena. The whole way there, Jessica prattled on about Enzo.

“His body is just so perfect,” she said. “All of those muscles just make me wanna bite him!”
I hated to admit it, but hearing Jessica talk about Enzo made the memories of last night come flooding back; his muscular body, the way he touched and kissed me, how he felt inside of me… It made my body tingle.

I tried to shake the thoughts out of my mind the best I could as we got in line to enter the arena, but I just couldn’t. The feeling of Enzo’s strong eyes on me as we laid in bed together, our limbs intertwined, was burned into my memory.

I only hoped that I could leave this game without being seen by Enzo or Justin.

I did read through the wiki some, but I thought I'd ask here for a more personalised opinion. I'm headed to Paris in either January or February, I'm still deciding when exactly.

I have Axial Spondyloarthritis, which is in the same family as Rheumatoid Arthritis. It's not at an extreme level yet, but I do have constant low-level pain that increases with long periods of walking or standing. I'm comfortable walking and standing, as long as I can have a short break every now and then, but as Paris is said to be best explored on foot I'm having a bit of difficulty figuring out what exactly I'd be able to do.

I'll be staying outside of Paris with a friend, I'm not sure of his area's name right now but he said it's ""40 minutes from Paris"". However we'll happily make the trip to Paris or the surrounding areas for day trips.

Some examples of things I love: parks/nature/gardens, art, museums, coffee shops/cafes, history (just to name a few). 

Some examples of things my friend recommended:

* Chambord Castle
* Provins
* Carcassone
* Castle Country
* Chartres Cathedral
* Notre-Dame
* Catacombs

I know these involve a LOT of walking. Does anyone perhaps have any advice regarding resting areas, or activities that won't be too physically demanding? I'm looking at more budget options, but am willing to splurge once or twice.

I am using grind setting 4, the medium roasted Costa beans, semi skimmed milk. 

What am I doing wrong? My old cheap tassimo pod machine tasted better than this.

I used to have rosacea and back then I noticed (non-sedative) antihistamines worked for me to treat it. I took one pill a day and that worked for a while until I noticed the pills caused my heart to skip beats etc. That was scary so I stopped using them. Fast forward three years, I had some gastro-intestinal issues which forced me to stop eating gluten and corn, and to stop drinking coffee. I think this is the biggest part because I remember how I used to flush directly after coffee. Since an allergy pill used to help me, and since I dont see rosacea anymore I guess I could have some mild allergy or intolerance to these foods, and some of you might also have that.

Another thing I did during this time was to start an extremely **simple** face routine. In the morning I wash my face with only water and then I put on sunscreen. Before bed I wash my face with a mild soap and put on very small amounts of some mild moisturizing cream labeled ""for dry skin"". Thats it.

It could be food related or dirty skin that helps feed the demodex mites, or a combination of the two. Who knows. I wish all of you good luck!

I have a Jura A1(15171) that I am not able to get any good coffee out of. I bought the machine second hand just recently. The machine had a small defect, so I got the machine for a good price. I have narrowed the problem down to coffee dose from the grinder. If I grind 10g with a separate grinder and insert the ground coffee into the chute, I get good coffee out. When I use the internal grinder, I get watery sour coffee no matter how I adjust the grind settings. I have compared the grind fineness and dose to our Jura E80 (15083) at work. Both machines have the same Aroma G3 grinder: 

[https://www.jura-ersatzteile-shop.de/mahlwerk-mahleinheit-aroma-g3-kpl-230-volt-revidiert-39279](https://www.jura-ersatzteile-shop.de/mahlwerk-mahleinheit-aroma-g3-kpl-230-volt-revidiert-39279)

I have adjusted the fineness by collecting dry ground coffee from the A1 at different grind settings to do a visual comparison to the dry ground coffee I normally use on the E80.

Result:

A1 grinds 5.4g in 3.6s (1.5g/s)

E80 grinds 9g in 5.3s (1.7g/s)

(Both machines set to max coffee strength)

The problem seems to be with the grind time? Note: I believe both these old machines have a maximum dose of 10g. I also contacted Jura customer service to ask about this. He insisted that the grind time is fixed and that it cannot be ""wrong"". 

  
Could anyone with an A1 measure the grind time? I measured it using slow motion (1/8 speed) video on my phone.

Any advice to not let it affect our relationship? Please provide tips.,Hey guys me and my partner were friends for over two years before we got together she is my best friend. I love her dearly we are now engaged it’s over a year that we have been romantically together. But since we have been romantically in a relationship she has been unemployed twice. First time was when we first got together it was about three months of no income and she temporarily lost her car because she couldn’t make repayments. She then borrowed mine. I feel like since we’ve been together I’ve been pushed into the financial breadwinner role. I’ve never been a rich person. But I am a hard worker and I love taking care of her. I worry that she isn’t being assertive enough with finding a job. I feel like I work full time and come home and when the house chores aren’t done and the house is falling apart so I feel it’s expected of me to cover all bases. We are an unconventional couple and I look masculine but we are both usually equal partners in every way. That’s at least what I had hoped and expected when we got together. I can understand losing work but being unemployed for three months at the start of our relationship and then again recently coming to two months. It has caused a lot of stress on me and our relationship. I feel resentful of her. I hate feeling that way. Whenever I bring this up with her or ask how her job search is going. She gets angry at upset at me and tells me she is trying everything. I know she is depressed and has lost motivation. I usually bring her a coffee each morning and make lunch or breakfast for her. I even offer to go on works with her during my work break or before work so that she has the motivation to get up. It’s hard I have depression myself so carrying someone else up the hill is difficult when I’m trying to hold it together for both of us. She will make statements about getting married overseas and having babies etc but it rubs me the wrong way because I know we will never have that life with her debts and lack of income. I am now paying off my own debts in order to sustain us.  I don’t care about who earns more money etc I just wish she made the effort to look after me as well. I’ve been in relationships previously where exes were unemployed and studying or expected me to pay for things. When we were friends and even on our first date she took the leadership planned the date and even paid for me I was shocked because women I’ve been with never usually do that. But I worry she’s become too relaxed with this situation. But I feel if I pressure her then we will continue to fight. I don’t feel like I have the best quality of life because I’m focusing on her needs being met and not mine. I love her and I do want to marry her. I feel shallow and ashamed that I wish my partner paid for things in our relationship and took care of me equally. She has so many great qualities and I admit I’ve always been more ambitious than her and I was always okay with that. We have been arguing so much because I feel extremely burnt out. I think she’s disappointed we haven’t had as much sex or fun recently. But we haven’t had the money or time together because I’m working so hard for us. So when I come home the last thing I want to do is go back out and be full of energy. Idk any tips or help. ,1,1732699850.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

I have a Delongi Stilosa that's about 2 years old. Gets light daily use (about 3 coffees a day on average), but recently seems to be struggling to push water through the portafilter.

If you’re not already using them, you’re missing out on a super easy way to share curated content and connect with your followers on a deeper level.

So, what even *are* Instagram Guides? Basically, they let you organize posts, products, or places into one neat little package. Think of it like making a mini-blog post directly on Insta. Your followers can scroll through your recommendations or themed posts without jumping all over your profile. Pretty sweet, right?

# Types of Instagram Guides

1. **Places** – Perfect for travel recs, cool hangout spots, or even your favorite local coffee shops.
2. **Products** – Got a shop? Love a product? This one’s for you. You can showcase stuff from your own store or things you’ve bought and loved.
3. **Posts** – This one’s my fave. You can take a bunch of your own or saved posts and turn them into a guide with a specific theme, like “Top 10 Tips for Photography” or “Best Recipes for Lazy Cooks.”

# How to Create One

It’s super easy, I promise:

1. Go to your profile, tap the little **‘+’** icon at the top right, and select **‘Guide’**.
2. Pick your guide type – Places, Products, or Posts.
3. Add the content you wanna include – posts, locations, or whatever.
4. Write a catchy title and a little blurb for each item. Keep it simple but useful.
5. Hit publish, and boom! You’ve got yourself an Instagram Guide.

# Pro Tips for Using Guides

* **Stick to what your audience loves.** If your followers are into travel, make a guide about hidden gems in your city. If they’re into fitness, share your top workout gear.
* **Don’t overthink it.** Sometimes just organizing your favorite posts into a guide makes a big impact.
* **Ask for engagement.** At the end of your guide, ask your audience for their thoughts, favs, or suggestions.

Honestly, I’ve been using Guides for a few months now, and they’re such a game-changer for engagement. It’s also a cool way to repurpose older posts or recommend stuff you’re into without feeling spammy.

Have you tried making a Guide yet? If so, drop your tips below! Or if you’re thinking about trying it but still have questions, ask away—I’ve got you. 😊",1,1732699287.0,InstagramBro,0,1.0,False

I don't have a college degree because I had really strong anxiety about failing, so I always skipped classes and dropped out of subjects. I was always afraid of being seen as ""incompetent"" so I guess that's what prevented me from finishing anything. Basically I had this whole identity of ""being smart"" and was reinforced by my getting good grades without much effort. That was freshman year, but when sophomore year came and things became challenging, that's when things started falling apart.

I shifted to another college program just to simply escape the previous one and no it did not go well. In fact it went badly. I hated every second of it, but I really tried to finish it and when I was almost there, the pandemic happened. I was already brute-forcing my way into finishing my new college program so when classes were already suspended, I just gave up. It was another chance to escape so I escaped.

Then I found healthygamer. I got to reflect on myself and understand more what was going on — why I was running away all the time. I learned more about myself and what I wanted. 

So I tried again. I got myself a part-time job but after a year, I dropped it. Why did I drop it? I was ashamed because I was only working at a small coffee shop. What triggered it? My dad told me so. He specifically told me ""I'm ashamed for you because your friends can see you that you're only working as a vendor at a coffee shop."" A few weeks after his statement, I quit. Again, there was this whole identity of ""being smart.""

So I decided to go back to college again, thinking I'd get better chances of a ""respectable"" job if I have a degree. I still hated having to wake up early to go to school. I still couldn't be bothered to do it, so I tried online schooling. I chose the major I want, and I'm still in the progress of going through it though my motivation to finish it is decreasing because the resources are pretty low quality. And the staffs of the online school seem to not care so much about the education at all. I get this gut feeling that I'm not really learning much at all, but I'm not really sure anymore as I type this, this could just be another manifestation of my ""being smart"" identity.

But anyway, I think I have to explain the title now. Why do I feel like I'm trapped by my family?

Well, I'm really still trying my best to finish my current degree (the online one), and on top of that, after learning about childhood trauma and getting to a place where I feel more confident about myself, I was really starting to prioritize myself and I was starting to build a life for myself. I don't know what kind of sick game life is playing but all of a sudden, I had to become ""caretaker"" for my niece because her current caretaker got sick. I had to fill in a role just to keep someone else afloat. 

Actually, this has been my role all my life. I was a parentified kid so I pretty much sacrificed a lot of my childhood to become an adult fast. I am aware of it now so I was really trying my best to build a life for myself this time, but something always happens that prevents me from thriving, and it's always family-related.

To give context, my mom has a disability, my dad works all day. We have two dogs (not bought by me) so I have to take care of them too. We don't have a maid. We used to but my mom dismissed her. So basically I became the maid and the parent of my parents.

So my niece's parents also both works all day and are now living with us. My younger sister will be working too, soon. So I am left with the responsibility alone to take care of a child that is not mine (I'm not compensated for it, too). On top  of that, I'm also still expected to clean the house, take care of the dogs, and cook them dinner for when they get home. 

Honestly I'm willing to drop all these responsibilities, but I can't make myself to. I feel so resentful and frustrated  because I was finally trying but my external circumstances pushed me back into my little dark corner. It's like I'm not allowed to thrive. My parents are toxic, no amount of talking to them ever made them care. They see me as a burden then, they still see me as a burden now. I feel like I'm battered and bruised by my circumstances. I feel powerless because I can't speak out for myself although I know this is already unfair. I'm barely keeping myself afloat, and then my family decides to dump their problems on me. What's worse is that they already know I'm struggling, and are complaining about it, but aren't doing anything to help me. They know I'm struggling to get a degree and don't have any job, but they still thought about leaving the caretaking duties to me.

I know no amount of complaining will help me out of my situation, but I'm so dejected. Why is it that every time I try, my circumstances keep pushing back? What do I do in this situation? I have nothing left for myself anymore. How do I stop people from using me?",3,1732699207.0,Healthygamergg,1,1.0,False
1h10e8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h10e8c/i_know_what_i_saw_my_husband_finally_saw_it_too/,I know what I saw. My husband finally saw it too.,"The newborn phase is hard. Most parents will tell you “hard” is an understatement. In reality you spend most of your time dirty and delirious, desperately trying to avoid nodding off into your third or fourth morning cup of coffee. You’re already dealing with constant worry, inconsolable screaming, endless poopy diapers, and wondering what each stain on your shirt is. You have no hope of getting a full night's sleep. You hardly have time to eat, let alone cook. A shower suddenly becomes the height of luxury. What I’m trying to get at is, it’s easy to believe your mind may be playing tricks on you when you see something in the shadows in the dead of night while you have a newborn, but this isn’t my imagination, and I need to know if any other new parents have seen this too.

Well before my due date we set up the baby monitor. We left the monitor on at night in order to get used to the screen’s persistent glow cutting through the darkness of our room. I’m a night owl, frequently staying up until two or three in the morning, so I spent many nights glancing at the screen and never noticed anything unusual. 

The same was true for the first few months of my daughter’s life while she slept in the bassinet beside our bed. But on her first night alone in her room I noticed a particularly dark spot in the corner that seemed to pulse, as if it were alive. As if it were breathing. I squinted. I zoomed the camera in. I even went into the room and peeked at the corner myself. I didn’t find anything out of the ordinary until I glanced back down at the screen and saw that the spot had moved from the corner to the middle of the room and was now a distinct, humanoid, silhouette. And it was looking in my direction. 

Fear engulfed me immediately. I stared at the figure on the screen as it stared at me. I had trouble tearing my eyes away, frozen in terror, but knew I had to look up. I had to see it for myself. But when I looked up, nothing was there.

I rushed over and scooped up my daughter, bringing her back to her bassinet in our room, and when I looked back at the monitor as I plugged it in, I noticed the figure was gone. What was still lingering was the chill that had been sent up my spine, and an unshakable feeling that I was being watched. I spent the rest of the night staring at the door, as if I was waiting for someone to come barging through it.

It was a week before my husband could convince me to let our daughter sleep in her room again. 

“You’re tired, you’re stressed. You probably just saw a shadow,” he kept repeating. I finally gave in just to make him drop it. 

I spent the entire night sitting up in bed, eyes glued to the monitor, scanning constantly for pulsating shadows, but none showed up. After a few nights with no overnight visitors, I began to relax. After a few weeks I started to believe that my husband must’ve been right; it must’ve been a figment of my imagination. But last night I rolled over to take one last peek before going to sleep for the night, expecting to see my daughter sleeping in her crib, but she wasn’t in her crib at all. She wasn’t even in the room. The shadow was standing right over her empty cot. Its “head” snapped up, in the direction of the camera, as if this thing was trying to look into it. To look at me.

I immediately smacked my husband awake and shoved the monitor in front of his face.

“Where’s the baby??” I yelled as he rubbed his eyes trying to come quickly back to consciousness. 

“What are you talking about?” He yawned, finally focusing on the monitor, eyes suddenly going wide and moving to scan my undoubtedly unhinged expression. “What’s that thing?” he asked me, not waiting for the answer as he sprung out of bed, running into her room as I scanned every corner of ours, as if she could’ve magically teleported in here on her own. I didn’t see her anywhere, so I followed my husband, hesitantly for some reason, and made my way to the nursery doorway, monitor in hand. On it I could see my husband frantically searching high and low in the room but, more importantly, I could see the figure looming over his each and every move, reaching out, trying to touch him, when my husband suddenly whipped around, panting, as if he expected someone to be there and yet saw nothing. But I could see it.

From the doorway I glanced up at them, but instead of seeing my husband I was met with the face of the thing, inches from my own, with deep, black eyes staring into my soul itself. The skin was covered in boils so full they could burst at any moment. Giant jagged yellow teeth leaked drool over stretched, cracked, lips. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t think. It opened its mouth and I expected my ears to be met with a disgusting gurgling but instead a sweeping crescendo of infant cries engulfed me. Not just one infant, but many, all screeching in perfect harmony, transfixing me with their heart shattering sounds. The screams became an all encompassing roar, growing louder and louder, before suddenly stopping all together, the beast vanishing right before my eyes.

I then heard a quieter, familiar cry from my daughter’s crib. She lay there, squirming a bit, beginning to fuss, and my husband and I exchanged confused looks before he picked her up and brought her back to our room.

I don’t think I’ll ever be letting her sleep in that room again.

The thing that’s really bothering me, though, is that something feels just the slightest bit off about my daughter. Like she’s changed in some way?

Build Changes after update

Legendary Perk Swap
- Taking One For The Team [for] Endurance 4
- This would bring my END from 6 to 11, allowing more perks. Considering a lot of these perks will be scaling with their corresponding stat, this will give me some resistance where Unyielding lacks that boost.

END 11 (After Update)
- Fireproof 3
- Life Giver 2
- Thru Hiker 2
- Iron Stomach 1
- Natural Resistance 1
- Radicool 1
- Startched Genes 1

I am unsure about Thru Hiker as a perk card given I have it on my armor. I've taken the three pieces of armor off of my person to see how they compare to the Grocer's Backpack, and I don't think I can live without the 90% weight reduction. It's not even close. The downside is that I don't get to reduce my chem weight. It looks as though I'll have to opt out for a Chemist's Backpack mod to accommodate.

INT 8 (After Update)
- Nerd Rage! 3
- Gunsmith 3
- First Aid 1
- Scrapper 1

I almost missed this change at first, but Forst Aid being reduced to a rank 1 Perk card left with me space to fill. I couldn't find any notable perks to slot in, so I ultimately decided that Gunsmith 3 would be nice to have. I mean, that Quad do be breaking my shit rather quickly after back to back events. 

LCK 15 (After Update)
- Better Criticals 3
- Bloody Mess 3
- Critical Savvy 3
- Grim Reaper's Sprint 3
- Ricochet 2 or Quick Hands 2?
- Serendipity 1

I thought Startched Genes being moved would hurt the build, but I think it actually helps it quite a bit. I've made room for what I think might be the best option. Of course, this is subject to change as we find out more on how the changes have affected some of the cards. 

Honorable Mention

LCK
- Four Leaf Clover
As you can see with my team stats, I sit at a solid 35 Luck. 31 is all that required to crit every other shot. I am unsure how recharging the crit bar from misses will benefit the build, but only time will tell when we get our hands on it. If someone has a theory, please feel free to share your thoughts.

All in all, I think this upcoming update is going to give this build a nice glow up. More Endurance gives more health and the opportunity to slot in more resistances, which is always welcome on a bloodied build. Space was made for a bit more flexibility in both Intelligence and Luck, also very nice. 

The issue I've been stumped with that has left me indecisive is, after everything I've shared with you all, by going with Thru Hiker as an Endurance perk, what do you believe would be best for the three pieces of armor that share the same effect (chest, and both arms)? I want to say Sentinels, but I'm not sure. I'm basically a human turret once I find a good vantage point, so moving, much less sprinting, isn't all that important to me. That and the backpack situation. Do you think the Chemist's Backpack is what I should go for? It would cover both  bases for my food and aid tabs. 

P.S. Sorry for the formatting. I'm typing in mobile, and I am unsure how to get everything exactly how I'd like. Reddit doesn't seem to like dead space between lines unless it has a bullet point. ",1,1732698747.0,fo76,2,1.0,False

My listening skills are better simply because I have been exposed to the language for quite some time. I am 15 hours into the speaking level which is 60 hours and then after that it'll be 60 hours reading and 60 hours writing. I am enjoying the learning journey very much and I am not setting myself hard objectives e.g. I want to be fluent in x amount of years but it's more about building this habit of learning a new language and I take any improvement along the way :)

Now, it's all about building vocabulary right now for managing common life situations. Already now there are times where I simply do not find myself in the situation(s) that allow me to apply the learned content. I work in the office 2-3x/week so there's limited opportunity there (it's a workplace after all), of course in my free time I use it wherever I go (coffee shop, restaurants..) but that's about it, really. I live alone too which doesn't help either. 

I am thinking that reading and writing later will be easier e.g. street signs, books and writing can be applied easily with Line chats etc. 

I am just worried that I will be stuck in a certain level of proficiency simply because of a lack of application possibilities. I am not going to strike up long conversations with strangers, so I guess it'll be the coworkers in the office then. I guess befriending Thais will be hugely beneficial. Maybe I am just overthinking 😅

Is there anything you suggest me to do apart from attending the school e.g. watching certain YouTube videos with English subtitles that talk about an easy subject, or maybe a series?

1h109rw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1h109rw/one_week_in_meeting_him_only_once_suddenly_were/,"One week in (meeting him only once), suddenly we're official ","I met this guy who is 11 years older than me (I'm in mid twenties) through a dating app. It's been a week since we last met because of his busy work schedule. He owns a business and frequently goes on business trips, so he works all day. To be honest, I don’t find him particularly attractive, but I like him for his maturity, stability, and security. He’s very direct about his intentions, saying he’s looking for a life partner and doesn’t want to play games.
From the first date, he told me that he liked me and was interested in me. He immediately asked me to be his girlfriend, which took me by surprise. Before we met, he asked me about sexual things, which I didn’t mind discussing, as we’re not getting any younger. He asked if I was a sexual person, and I told him that I had been romantically intimate with my ex and that I would only engage in sexual activity with my boyfriend.

Over the course of the week, he kept telling me how much he liked me, wanted to take care of me, and how badly he wanted me to be his girlfriend. He even wanted to buy me gifts, let me drive his other car, and mentioned that I should move into his place soon. He asked me questions about when I want to get married and how many kids I’d like to have. We discussed these things in just one week. He also invited me to accompany him on his business trip to the US this weekend, but I couldn’t go because I don’t have a visa yet. He then invited me to join him in his home country for Christmas.

Yesterday, we had a conversation where he repeatedly asked me to be his girlfriend, saying that we were already acting like a couple through our text messages. I told him that I needed more time to get to know him better and see him more, but he couldn’t find time because of his busy schedule. He told me that we would work things out, and that he has a lifetime to get to know me. He said he believed that we would work out and promised he would teach me how to love him over time, as he already loved me because I gave him peace and calm in the midst of his busy work life.

In the past week, we’ve had three arguments due to miscommunication. He tends to be quite dominant, and I’m an independent woman, which sometimes causes friction. Despite the disagreements, he kept being persistent about wanting me to be his girlfriend. Eventually, I gave in, possibly because of his negotiation skills. When he asked me if I was interested in being his girlfriend, I said yes, thinking that I see potential relationship with him but was still unsure if I was ready or truly like him. However, he took it as a yes right away, and I didn’t correct him because I thought I’d give it a try, especially since he was the only person I’d met on the app who was clear and direct about what he wanted.

Today is our second day as an official couple, but I’m already having doubts. Yesterday afternoon, we became official, and then last night we talked on the phone. He seemed down, so I asked him what was wrong. He told me that he missed me and wanted to make love with me. I was shocked because I had told him before that I would only engage in sexual activity if he were my boyfriend. He reassured me that he wanted us to be official, not because of sex, but because he wanted to introduce me as his girlfriend. Later, he called again to apologize, saying that he would never bring it up again. He explained that, as a man, it was natural for him to feel that way towards his girlfriend, and he was sorry if he made me uncomfortable.

Tonight, things took another turn. He texted me that he had an early flight tomorrow for a business trip, and he wanted to meet me before he left. He's working in his office and said he needed to sleep but wanted to rest in my room for an hour or two. I told him I wasn’t comfortable inviting anyone over since I rent a room and there’s a family living here. Plus, my room is small and not soundproof. I suggested that he could pick me up and we could hang out at his place instead, but he said he wasn’t planning to go home and wanted to sleep here beside me. After about 30 minutes, he texted again, saying he needed to go home because he had to sleep and that we wouldn’t be meeting anymore. He suggested we try to meet tomorrow night instead.

Additionally, he had mentioned earlier that he had a flight to a province at 4 a.m. for business and that it was near my place, so he wanted to stop by for an hour or two before heading to the airport. However, I told him I wasn’t comfortable with that, and after our conversation, he decided not to come over and said he would meet me tomorrow instead.

Now, I’m having second thoughts about whether I should continue giving him a chance, stay in the relationship, and get to know him better, or if I should stop and prolong this relationship. I’m unsure of what to do. I think he's controlling too.

Edit: By the way, I haven't received anything from him except for a 2 dollar coffee. He offered to buy me things, but I never accepted because I earn enough to support my wants. I don’t want to depend on him financially even I marry him eventually. Also, we haven’t had sex yet.",3,1732698600.0,TrueOffMyChest,6,0.8,False

We met up for coffee when another friend of mine told him (his name's Vaughn) I'd been going out specifically to meet new people regularly.

The main issue he had was overcoming the fear of what to say when meeting new people. I said it's always good to explore several topics using a brief story and then seeing which topics grab the other persons attention.

For example, it's always safe to talk about a travelling experience and when you finish, pay attention to what the other person asks you about it. Then ask them about the same thing in their experience with travelling and other topics.

After the catch up, Vaughn texted me a couple weeks later - he had gone out and started talking to new people and met his now (Fast forward a year) wife.

It was really rewarding and I hope other people can experience the difference it makes to get out there and meet new people.

1h1070k,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1h1070k/what_is_the_best_home_coffee_machine/,What Is The Best Home Coffee Machine?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been on a mission to find the perfect home coffee machine, and I thought I'd share my journey with you all. After trying countless machines and spending way too much money on coffee shop drinks, I finally found what works best.

First off, let me tell you why I started this search. I was spending roughly $5-6 daily on coffee shop runs, which adds up to about $150 monthly! That's when I decided to invest in a quality home coffee maker.

Through my research and personal experience, I've found that the best home coffee machines combine convenience, quality, and value. You don't need to spend a fortune to get barista-quality coffee at home. I've compiled some top picks that you can check out here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine

What I've learned is that the ""best"" machine really depends on your specific needs. Do you need something that makes espresso? Or are you more of a drip coffee person? Here's what to consider:

1. Brewing Method
- Drip coffee makers are great for everyday use
- Espresso machines for those fancy drinks
- Pod machines for ultimate convenience
- French press for rich, bold flavor

2. Capacity
- Single-serve for solo drinkers
- 12-cup carafes for families or offices

3. Features to Look For
- Programmable timer
- Temperature control
- Strength settings
- Built-in grinder
- Auto shut-off

One thing that really surprised me was how much better coffee tastes when you use the right machine. I used to think coffee was just coffee, but the difference is mind-blowing!

The sweet spot for price seems to be between $100-300. Anything cheaper might not last long, and anything more expensive often includes features you might never use.

I've found some incredible deals on coffee machines that tick all these boxes. You can browse through the current best-sellers and their reviews here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine

Pro Tips I've Learned:
- Clean your machine regularly
- Use filtered water
- Buy whole beans and grind them fresh
- Measure your coffee properly
- Replace parts when needed

Remember, a good coffee machine is an investment that pays for itself. Just think about how much you're spending at coffee shops!

The machine I personally ended up choosing has saved me hundreds of dollars and gives me better coffee than most cafes. Plus, there's something really satisfying about making your perfect cup at home.

Hope this helps you find your perfect coffee companion! Feel free to ask any questions in the comments - I'm always happy to chat about coffee!",1,1732698238.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

What is a reason for making people go to the office regularly?  
  
My social circle's consistent experience is that the days we spend on-site are the least productive. Meaningless in-person meetings that eat up your time and break your productivity, you see people so you socialise, you take longer and more frequent coffee/tea/smoking breaks.

I also imagine maintaining the office space has a considerable financial overhead.

I often find in job description the implicit reason being ""work culture"" and ""team cohesion"", however, we (my professional social circle at least) have been experiencing the opposite effect. Is it a matter of lack of trust, or a need of micromanagement and maintaining a feel of hierarchy? This would correlate well with the ""home working by income"" statistics from Forbes, if we assume higher wage implies higher up in the hierarchy.

I would be interested to hear from someone who is in a position involved in making these decisions and policies.

We’re going to go over a few things today that should put you in the driver’s seat for good. 


Since I posted my last post, I keep getting questions like: 

""Can I send you my story?""
""What if the 3D is testing me?""
""So I just need to believe?""
""Can you tell me what you manifested?""

First thing first, all of these are doubts. 
You should not be asking questions, especially since the answers are in my post. You are prolonging the process when you keep asking and not applying.

When you question, you are placing your awareness on the specific thing you are questioning. 

""Can I send you my story?"" = placing your awareness on the current circumstances by repeating it over and over in comment sections, to friends, family, self.  You don’t need to send me your story when I already told you what to do. Circumstances don’t matter and what I told you to do applies to EVERY situation. Drop the old story like bag full of roaches and start affirming the new story. I don’t need to know that your ex cheated, I don’t need to know that your house is flooding and you’re sitting on the roof as you type, I don’t need to know that you’ve been affirming for x amount of months.  All of this keeps the old story in place. 

""What if the 3D is testing me?""= Placing your awareness on the 3D. Which is a big NO! You just validated your old life by acknowledging 3D. You should only be thinking from the new one. You should never, ever be focused on what is in front of you if it’s not what you want. Again. IF IT IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT tell it to fuck off.  Focusing on being tested does what? You guess it! It  creates more tests. 

""So I just need to believe?"" = placing your awareness on needing to do something to get something, which in turn, creates limitations. I told you in my last post that you don’t need to believe and that you don’t need to do anything to have what you want. Why is that so hard to understand? I never believed my dad would leave me as a child, but he did. 😂 Not everything in front of you is your fault. It’s the meaning you place on it that gives it power. The 3D is going to keep throwing you situations as you continue to live. Even the people who are manifesting masters have things happen to them throughout their day to day life. The difference between you and them is that they think around it while you think about it. You don’t want it? Don’t think about it.  The brain is powerful people. Research it if you need to. 

Also, again, you don’t need to do anything. I know that sounds scary to a person who has had to do a lot to get what they currently have but that’s because you allowed yourself to think that you have to. But in order to get yourself to a point where all you have to do is think about it and it’s yours, you’re going to have to erase the old data chip and insert the new one. How do you do that? Your thoughts. Remember, your brain is powerful. It can remember things that happened to you years ago, it can conjure ideas, it can learn a foreign language, it can tell you how to get from your house to the grocery store without GPS, it can hold so much information. And it can hold onto it very tightly. We need to tell it to kick some stuff to the curb because now we want it to know the new story. 

Ever wonder why you can think about an old person, place, or thing and automatically come up with words for it. For example, if I asked you to think about your ex, you might automatically think: ""asshole, mean, cheater, never loved me, etc…"" 

All of that is stuck in your brain and it’s because of what you experienced with that person and who you told yourself they were. 


SO… let’s get more into belief. 

Let’s say you are broke. I’m talking, -$600 in your bank account and you want to manifest having $1,000,000.  The ONLY thing you should be doing is thinking from the brain of someone who has $1,000,000. 

Therefore, if I now have $1,000,000, I don’t need to constantly check my bank account, i don’t need to cry over getting a $20 Netflix bill, I don’t need to even believe I have it! As an identified millionaire, I just KNOW I have it….because why? 

I have it. That’s it. I have the $1,000,000. I’m happy.  I don’t need to question, doubt, cry, whine, search….

It’s not…I believe I have the one million dollars, therefore I have it. 
It is…I know I have the $1,000,000 because I have the $1,000,000. 

An ""I have"" statement implies it is yours. It is of you. It is of your having. 

""I have pizza in the oven."" 

If I have pizza in the oven, I don’t need to believe I have pizza in the oven. I’m telling you do, so i do. 

Here’s a good one. I’m going to a party that requires me to wear one thing that is red. In my head, I start to imagine my wardrobe and think to myself: 

""Oh! I have red shoes."" I don’t need to believe I have red shoes, I don’t need to go home and check and see if the shoes are red, I don’t need to ask ""what if I don’t have red shoes."" Why? Because I have red shoes.  These are the thoughts of a person who has red shoes. 

Do you understand? For those of you who are still going to try to ask questions in the comment section, I’ll give you another one: 

If I am in NO CONTACT with SP (a specific person), and I would like to be in contact with SP, what do you think you should be doing? You should be thinking from the brain of the version of you who is in constant contact with SP, right? Therefore, if I am in constant communication with SP, right now, at this very moment, I don’t need to be believing that I talking to them. I KNOW I am talking them. Why? Because we are talking. 😑 

Come on now. Half the situations you are in, you never sat there and truly believed it would happen. Half of the celebrity world got rejection after rejection but they persisted in the thought/ knowing that it would happen to them or that it is happening. Probably by saying, ""I’m gonna be a star one day.""  Or even visualizing , or writing about it in school assignments. 

The next question I see a lot: 

‘Can you tell me what you’ve manifested?’  Which is placing your awareness on needing to see proof before you can know that you too can have what you want. Aka ‘checking.’  Let me check to make sure you can do it and then I’ll see if I can. When you are checking, you are saying that ‘I don’t have it, because I don’t see it.""  It the ‘lemme make sure it’s there before I know it’s mine."" And In this case you are saying, ""I won’t be able to know that I can create my reality until I see enough success stories."" And then you might find that you keep looking for success story after success story. Why? Because you placed your awareness on it so much that you keep creating more searching and no answers. Newsflash, you’re the answer. 

I told you what you needed to do. Why are not applying? You could have had your manifestation yesterday but you keep needing to get answers. And when you keep searching for answers, you place your awareness on searching/needing and again whatever you place your focus on, you create more of. That’s it.

I can see that it’s hard for a lot of you to just understand that you’re creating. If you need proof that you’re creating, just look at your circumstances. I’m sure you can point out at least one or two. At some point, something happened in your life or someone told you something and you placed awareness and a meaning on it. Meaning, every time you thought about that ‘something’ or every time you came into a similar situation to a previous one, you either assumed (With your thoughts) what would happen, or you gave it a meaning. 

Example: You text SP. They don’t text you back for 2 hours. You start to assume (think) they’re doing something behind your back. This thought pops up every time SP is: not replying back, arriving a few minutes late, posting on their story and not responding to you, following other people of the opposite sex on social media, the list goes on.  You might even find that you start searching for evidence that SP is up to no good. See how your insecurities just manifested? 

Let’s say you get rejected from your dream job and you automatically begin to assume/ think you aren’t good enough or qualified. And then let’s say you apply for a house but it gets sold to Nancy. So you think, why her and not me? And then let’s say, you get cheated on by SP and start to wonder why you weren’t good enough. Let all those ""rejection"" scenarios sink in. 

Next, you want to buy a new car so you go online, see the price, and say, ""I don’t have enough money, I cant afford that."" And then let’s say a few weeks later you get into a car accident and automatically think you’re fucked because you can’t handle dishing out anymore money. 

Do you see what all these situations have in common? Each one contains affirmations or ""thoughts.’ Yes, an affirmation can be negative because a thought can be negative. 

1. Situation: Sp not texting back after 2 hours? 
Your affirmation (thought): He/she is doing something behind my back. Then you see them on Instagram and they’re not replying to your text. Your affirmation: why is SP not texting back? Then SP follows someone of the opposite sex. Your affirmation or assumption: SP doesn’t want me, I’m clearly not SP’s type, yeah, you get the idea. 

When you hold that thought, when you place your focus on that thought time and time again, you are persisting in it and creating more and more of it.  And then you carry this into your next relationship, thus creating the same circumstances with different people.

2. Situation: Rejection from your dream job (or any rejection)
Your affirmation (thought): I’m not good enough, they chose someone else, this keeps happening, what will I do? 

A person in this situation just doubted their worth, said that they are not chosen, affirmed that whenever they are in situations that involve multiple contenders, they are always get rejected. Do you see how that carries on into multiple situations throughout your life? 

The last situation, about money, is pretty straightforward. Every time you tell yourself you can’t afford it (Even if you can’t in that moment), every time you say I don’t have enough, guess what? You just might find that money is a constant issue for you. 

Now, don’t get me wrong. I understand that your situation in front of you looks fucked. I understand things are appearing hard, and I know that having to convince yourself that everything is okay when it’s not, is rough. But that’s literally the game. THAT. IS. THE. GAME. To beat the game, you have to play it. If you choose not to play, the game will play for you. Therefore you can’t complain if you lose. But…the good news is, you are always given the option to take over the controller. But you have to be able to look around and see that the whole city around you is burning and know that you’re still going to win. 

You ever played a video game? Think of this as VR. Pretend that your desired life is   The life you have whenever you put on VR glasses. You put them on for a second (the act of imagining) and everything is great: You have SP, Money, good Friends, and large home. But then you take them off and go, ""ah, back to reality."" 
You need to be able to see the virtual reality even when the glasses come off. That means, you need to be fucking delusional. 

SP acting nonchalant? You should be thinking SP treats you like royalty.
Bank account looking dry? You should be thinking you just got a $50,000 deposit and are about to start looking up vacation spots. 
Got rejected from your dream job? You should be thinking holy fucking shit, I just landed the job of my dreams. 

These are your Virtual reality glasses. Wear them until the VR has to become the RR (real reality). 

Now, before you do anything above. If you are not in the position of knowing how powerful you are, you need to get with the program. Even though I did some research before jumping in, everything you need is in this post, so you don’t really need to go source hopping. Instead, test your power. Start small. Affirm to yourself for a least a week to see something specific or for someone to give you something small like….free coffee or a French fry from McDonald’s, idk. Just make it small, insignificant and something you don’t necessarily give a fuck about. My recommendations: 

A scooby doo van (yes, a scooby doo van),  a chocolate wrapped in a specific color, a free coffee, A certain colored cat. 

What you are going to do is tell yourself over and over that you see it. 

""I see a scooby doo van""
""I see a red chocolate.""
I see a blue cat.""

Say it with no care in the world. Say it in your mind, say it on your way to the store, say it before bed, say it out loud, say it whenever.  

Now here’s where you don’t want to mess up: 
Don’t look for it. Don’t count the days. Don’t ask where is it or how it’s going to show up, don’t tell your best friend that you’re trying to manifest it, and don’t think that just because I didn’t come this week, that manifesting is not real. When you say it’s not working, then it’s not. 
Just like when you say you have it, you have it. 


Which brings me to the point of people saying that they give up. 
Give up what? You give up manifesting? You’re manifesting already. Everyday. Your thoughts create regardless so you can’t give up. Ohhhh wait, you’re saying ""I give up trying to get it."" 
Trying to get what? There’s no trying.  If you keep going into this thinking you’re trying, you’re going to keep being in the ‘trying.""

If I have SP, why would I be trying to get them? 
If I have red shoes, why would I be trying to get red shoes?

I have it. 

Ohhhh, wait, wait!  You mean, you’re give up on not seeing it with your two eyes? 
Gotcha. 

So you’re saying, I need to see $1,000,000 to know I have it. 
I need to see that text from SP to know It’s there. 

You sound like someone who doesn’t really have it. And based on what you just said, I now know you don’t have it. 

I just bought the brand new IPAD pro a few days ago ( which was on my manifestation list btw, got it for cheap. 🤗) Which means I have it right? 
Never have I ever thought to myself or said to myself: lemme go home and look at it and then I’ll know that I have it. 😐 Does that make sense? 

It is all a knowing. Just knowing. And getting your brain on the same track as you. So how do you get to know something? The same way you know your ABC’s, the same way you know how to cook really good steak, the same way you know how to tie your shoes. Repetition. 

Tell yourself. Tell yourself and stop coming back here telling us that you’re tired. 
 You should never be tired. The only thing you should be tired of is the circumstances you’re in. 

It should not be hard. You should not feel like you just ran a marathon or competed in a heavyweight boxing match. You should not feel like you just walked the Sahara desert barefoot or climbed Mount Everest. You’re literally just thinking. You can’t get tired of thinking because you’re thinking every single day. 

The rest of us don’t wanna hear how tired you are. Go be tired somewhere else. Likely in those undesirable circumstances you keep wanting to stay in. 

If you don’t have what you want, it’s because of you. Plain and simple. If you don’t have what you want it’s because you’re doubting, checking, wavering, reacting, not persisting, searching, wondering, hoping, wishing, repeating the old story, whining, thinking your circumstances are too dire, giving up, etc…

Stop stalking your SP or wondering why they’re doing the opposite of what you want. 

Stop checking your bank account and being depressed about being broke. 

Stop letting a rejection mean you’re a reject. 

Stop giving anything you don’t want the time of day. 

Look at it, laugh, and tell yourself you have it. 



Also, a lot of you seem to think that a few doubts or fears has completely ruined everything. If it happens, shoo it away and continue to affirm. 

If you find yourself about to spiral, jump into EFT tapping or breath work. However, you should be doing eft tapping or breath work or meditating if you are constantly allowing your thoughts to paralyze you. Your thoughts should not be breaking you down. In my last post, I stated that I used sleep affirmations to keep me from spiraling. If you don’t feel like tapping or meditating during the day, use the sleep tapes to reprogram your subconscious. Choose a sleep tape that is going to address the fears. If the thought of having your manifestation or trusting that i\you have it is creating opposing thoughts that you can’t shoot down with affirmations, you should be listening to tapes that address worthiness. 

I highly recommend the 8hr sleep tape by Dylan James titled: I am the best. But he has many more so find one that is fitted to your opposing thoughts. 


Lastly, I wanted to talk about movement and always thinking in your favor. 
Movement is real. But you should not be out here looking for it. 

An example of movement can be: 

You’re manifesting money but your coworker tells you they just won $20,000,000.  Or SP reaches out to you after you affirm for them to, but then they stop responding. 

A lot of people will view things like this as messing up or doing something wrong. You might react, you might feel like you fucked up, you might complain online. 

I’m going to tell you what you should be doing when movement presents itself:

Affirm. 

Don’t react, don’t think that you only got a partial manifestation, don’t even claim that it exists. You should constantly keep affirming until the exact thing you wanted shows up, and even then, you should still keep your affirmations on a loop. 

Movement doesn’t mean shit. It means you need to keep affirming. 

The 3D shouldn’t even been something you acknowledge until what you want is yours. 

Finally, you should always be thinking in your favor. Always. 
No thought should ever oppose your best interest or what you want. 
People say they wanna live their best lives but settle. Stop letting other people decide for you. You decide how everything is going to play out, 

I saw a post here yesterday that said SP reached out. ""But we’re not getting back together, we are just meeting up to talk.""

Says who? 

You should be thinking for the best result. The result you want. 

If I’m meeting up with SP, it’s because SP and I are getting back together. 

Done. Stop opening up pathways for anything other than what you want to happen. You’re leaving doors open for rejection, for maybes, for a perhaps. And when you do that, you leave room open for a NO. 

In your reality, there is no, ""No.""  I know that sounds vain but that’s because you have lived your whole life accepting NO and were probably a people pleaser. 

You need to be waking up and deciding what’s going to play out for your life. I don’t care if you don’t truly hold the knowing quite yet. Say it until you do or keep allowing people to say it for you.  

You may not get a ""yes’ everyday even if you are affirming for it but you better act like you did. 

Walk away from every single situation as if you won. 

This is an everyday thing. If you are the person you say you are when affirming, you have to wake up and be that person everyday. Not one day out of the week. Not one month, not one year. Every single day. This is what consistency and discipline looks like for those of you who have never tried either one. 

That’s not to say you can’t cry or be human but you need to maintain the knowing that you are who you say you are and you have what you say you have. 

For those of you who are wanting to change an SP but they’re in your face. You have two options: 

1. Go no contact and affirm for the version of them you want. 
2. Ignore what they’re doing and affirm. 

That’s it.  I know a lot of you can’t just up and move away from the person so that’s why option 2 is there. But if it were up to me, option one would be the only one. 

For those of you scared of option one, SP is not going anywhere and if you’re afraid to lose them you’re overly attached anyway. For some of you, SP is so bad that you’re not losing anything special. What are you losing exactly? Tell me? Right. 

But anyway, it’s not necessary to go cold turkey. Just keep ignoring and affirming. 

There’s nothing more to it. 

If I were to summarize this whole post, do you know what I would tell all of you? 

Ignore and affirm (or script, or visualize). Whatever works best for you. 

Affirmations are just reminders and how do you normally remind yourself of something? With a thought. There’s no secret formula. You don’t have to make your affirmations sound glandular. 

How have you been thinking your whole life? Your thoughts aren’t yells or screams or long drawn out sentences/paragraphs. 

You have been creating with normal thoughts on autopilot 
All you’re doing is taking your brain off autopilot and putting the thoughts into your mind yourself. 

A lot of you might think that I’m some master manifestor (and I do affirm that I am one, as you should too) but I’m human just like you. I have my days, doubts come up, and I’m still knowing into being some things on my list.  Don’t compare yours to others. Stop asking people for proof, stop asking people how to do it, stop asking what their affirmations are and if there’s a right way to say them. 

Your affirmation should be a simple sentence that is from the brain of the person who has it. 

You want a BMW

I have a BMW. 
I’m so happy to have a BMW. 
My BMW is so amazing. 

You’re not going to feel like it’s yours
You’re not going to believe it’s yours
You’re simply going hold the knowing that it is yours by affirming. 

Say it in your mind and when you have the capability, say it out loud. 

Forget about time. That’s where a lot of you mess up. Focusing on how long. If you are applying. It should not take long but if you’re concerned with the ins and outs, you keep delaying it. 

Now…..enough with the questions.

1h0zozn,https://www.reddit.com/r/cheating_stories/comments/1h0zozn/my_23_f_ex_bought_me_24_m_a_ps5_and_cheated_on_me/,My (23 F) ex bought me (24 M) a PS5 and cheated on me in the same day.,"(To give context I found out she was cheating on me 5 days ago)

My birthday is around the corner (December 2nd) weeks prior I was repeatedly hinting to my girlfriend (Now ex) that I wanted a PS5, and 5 days ago I was surprised when my girlfriend came back home after getting her hair done with a PS5 in hand. Even though I was dropping hints I had never actually expected she'd go through with it and buy me one. I was even working extra shifts, trying to save up for other things, but I joked about the PS5 because, why not? Who wouldn't want one? I didn’t even expect a response, honestly.

But then, she showed up that evening, with her hair freshly done and holding a PS5 box I couldn’t believe it. My hands shook as I held it, staring at the sleek white box. A *new*​​ one. Not used, not refurbished.

And let me tell you, I enjoyed every second of removing the PS5 from that box. We set up the console and I downloaded a few games (BO6, Black Myth Wukong, and RE Village just to list a few). The night was going well. Then, as I sat back on the couch, I noticed her phone on the coffee table. It buzzed, the screen lighting up with a notification. My eyes caught the name     ""​Joshua""

I tried not to look. I really did. But my curiosity got the best of me. I w*​*asn’t even trying to snoop, it was just there, right in front of me. I reached for my drink, *​*m*​*y eyes drifting to the phone. The text that appeared was —*I can’t wait to*​ *see you later, baby*​ 😉*.*

After reading that text I was beyond furious, but I kept my composure. Minutes later my girlfriend walked out into the living room and I asked her if she had any plans for the rest of the day and she said something along the lines of ""I'm about to go hang out with a few of my girl friends, hopefully the play station will keep you busy. See you later babe"" and just before she was about to leave I said ""Tell Joshua I said hi"" we had a on call argument for half an hour about how he was just a friend and I should respect her privacy. 

Anyways I kicked her out of the house and she's coming to pick her stuff up the day after Thanksgiving. I'm not even going to help her, I'm just going to sit back, playing games on my PS5 and not even speak to her.

TLDR: My girlfriend cheats on me with a guy named Joshua after just buying me a PS5 I confronted her as she was leaving to meet up with him, and we had a half an hour long argument on the phone. She's coming over the day after Thanksgiving to grab her stuff and I'm just going to be playing video games.",17,1732695952.0,cheating_stories,25,0.91,False

1h0zm44,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h0zm44/date_took_a_wrong_turn_once_the_topic_of/,Date Took A Wrong Turn Once The Topic of Starbucks Came In..,"So I (26m) don’t normally date women who are younger than me, due to me finding it difficult to genuinely connect with even if it’s just to hook up. Then comes this girl (23f) who is kinda cute and I thought why the hell not.

The date started off easy, taking a walk talking about cultures, her bisexuality, and some kinky topics. I thought this should be quite smooth. 

She suggested stopping by for a bit coffee, and I joked saying “I hope you are not going to suggest Starbucks“. Mainly because I think it’s outrageous to charge 8 Euros for a shitty coffee. Then she mentions it is because of their part in the Israel x Palestine. 

I was not aware of this, and asked what exactly they did and I am curious to know. This is when shit started spiralling, she called me “someone with no values”, “shitty man who does not care about others” 

I asked her please educate me, as I am open to learning and want to know why. And she mentions it is not her job to do so.

Obviously, I was not going to sit and take this just because my current events is not as up to date as her. We had a quite a bit of an argument in the middle of the street. I pretty much shut her up by mentioning some of these below points:

“There’s people being killed (religious hate) in my country (on a much smaller scale, obviously she didn’t know about it). So are their lives worth less coz they are not the main news that pops up.”

“The least you can do is spread awareness regarding this, but choosing not to do so doesn’t make you any better”

And couple of other things. Long story short, she called me a dick and didn’t even want me to drop her back home (couldn’t care less, it was cold af, but as a man it’s my duty to offer)

So just made me wonder, should be well versed in the hot news topics in order to be a good person? I think I already know the answer but wanted to get some opinions.

1h0zlp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1h0zlp5/need_to_take_a_break/,Need to take a break ,"My husband and I almost never talk. He works from home, sits at his computer all day and wears his headphones where he listens to podcasts. His headphones on, means I can't speak to him and it's like a wall between us, anything I say has to be repeated twice, it's discouraging.  He takes the kids to school, gets back, makes his coffee, never asks me if I'd like one too, works, gets up at noon to break his intermittent fasting, boils 5 eggs, eats them (the entire kitchen stinks), he doesn't wipe down the countertop, or the stove, there's egg water everywhere, coffee powder everywhere from the freshly ground coffee, etc. He even leaves the spoon he uses on the counter and doesn't throw it in the sink.

He then gets up from the computer to pick up the kids from school, except if I let him know that I can do it or he has a call and I need to do it. He'll eat whatever I've made for lunch, without commenting on the food, never thanks me for it and gets back to work.

If I don't start a conversation about the kids or politics, he won't. The kids go to him if they need to ask him a question for their homework, he's nice to them. I help them with their homework too (different languages) and make them dinner and we hang out (he doesn't). They then have dinner, he often doesn't eat with us often and after they're ready for bed, he'll go in after I do to stay with them until they fall asleep. On Sundays, he'll take them to Church for Sunday school and Mass, I've stopped. I'm expected to make lunch on Sundays, again, he'll eat it without commenting on the food. He won't load the dishwasher, we have to ask him to take out the trash several times, before he actually does it. He pretends he doesn't see it, although he's in the kitchen several times a day of course.

I know that money issues stress him out, he was used to me contributing more and very little being required of him, but everyone contributes to their families without being passive aggressive. I don't even ask him for money when the kids need new clothes or shoes and I'm constantly buying them these needs (it's a harsh winter where we live).

His work station is in our small bedroom, his trash is everywhere, his smelly socks are everywhere and it's all next to my side of the bed. I need an open window to sleep well (even if just slightly), he needs several blankets and keeps sweating under them. Needless to say, I can't sleep well in the room, because he won't open the winsdow or clean up the trash from his desk and next to my side of the bed. I couldn't breathe during the summer and so moved to the couch and I've been sleeping on the couch ever since. The quality of sleep is horrible and I'm constantly tired.

My Mother had a serious health issue last week and he really stood by me, was supportive and even cried when we were most scared for her health. I felt like that brought us a little closer and back together, but it's all back to normal again. I do all the shopping, he pays two bills, i.e. rent and school. I'm expected to pay everything else (all the other bills). He's constantly passive aggressive.

I feel like I'm done and that I deserve to have my space. My mother lives with us (for many reasons), but has her own private area (a huge room, her own bathroom and toilet), she helps us a lot. I still feel like I have 4 kids... (I only have two), but it's like I need to take care of everyone and everything and I don't even have my own space in my home. I feel like renting out a smaller apartment just for me and moving out, even if just for a couple of months so we can figure out how we can move forward. I love the kids and know that this would destroy them, they freak out if I travel for just a few days for work. They're 9 and 11 yo and they see divorced parents around us and it scares them. I'm a good mother, I am attentive, always put the kids first, buy them tonnes of books and make sure they're happy, healthy and well fed. The tension between us doesn't help the kids and I try to camouflage it as much as possible.

Being responsible for the whole household could be the wake up call, but of course I'll be the one who left and let go. He won't admit that he drove me to my breaking point or that the fact that he ignores me and my needs has pushed me towards it. I feel ignored, not loved and unappreciated. Please ask me questions and give me your take or advice, he's a good man at heart, but I feel so much resentment and that I am required to lead on my own. Thank you and please be kind, my mental health can't take any attacks.",0,1732695535.0,Divorce,0,0.5,False
